I can‚Äôt tell you how many people‚Äôs derank just for this event that‚Äôs why I have stopped playing as a killer for this event because it is just not worth it playing against 4 Dwight‚Äôs who have about 1000 hours in dbd 
---
---
---
I would use nurses instead of spirit fury because wraith is a stealth killer
---
It‚Äôs up to you but in my opinion I go easy in that situation. It‚Äôs best to just have fun and 3v1s are never fair nor fun. I usually play pretty chill so that the survivors don‚Äôt have an awful time because someone failed to load in. On the survivor side, there is nothing more annoying than being put in a sweaty 3v1 game so I can feel for them
---
Neon hair get nerfed by the q times this event, now killers just dodge you
---
The absolute entitlement of this comment holy bananas.
---
Howdy
---
Oh god this is turning quickly into downvote fest 
---
How far do people sit from their tv/monitor that Claude is actually hard to see? 
---
Everybody is entitled to their opinion, I just feel like I should not have to change my character for somebody else. I play against people I dislike all of the time, never once have I dodged the game or asked someone to switch because that is just stupid.
---

---
Imagine somebody  has only leveled up one character and you ask them to switch to another that had no other perks just because they "can't really see" your character. No and thanks.
---
Would love to see them!
---
Accept my fate? Naww I'll leave and join a new game so I don't get full team Mori'd. Killers who run ebony mori in like rank 12 games need to chill. Kills don't make you cool fam, you are just stealing kills from your boss the entity lol
---
**F**
---
Good ideas but you dealing with clowns that still havent allowed hatches to close 
---
I mean you can if you want.
---
in germany we do that
---
If they facecamp you it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre better than them lol
---
Eh. I'm okay with most of their speeds. I understand that they have to be faster than us, otherwise they'd never kill us. But I can find a weakness in most of the killers. I can't outrun, out hide or outsmart any hill Billy players and I guess I just found out why. He gets notified any time I'm near completing one. Which.... Makes more sense.
---
Why‚Äôs this unintentional? She nodded for you to leave. 
---
\&gt;Running Self Care

I'll camp if I see idiots swarming the hook and pip every time. Granted it's always the savee that dies but fuck u if your toxic about it after.

It's cause apparently the only way to survive billy is never getting seen lol 
---
Have you heard  
---
of this thing  
---
called Ambidextrous?
---
You obviously don't understand something. For me at least, ebony moris aren't for the kills. They aren't for the fear and torment. It's for fun. The game is more relaxed and fun for the killer when they have an ebony mori.
---
Also, it's a rank 6 game, but y'know, that's whatever.
---
Tf lol, predators hunt xenomorphs for fun
---
You obviously need to talk to people more nicely. And no I don't want nice easy games for killers. The whole point of survivor is to try and escape.
---
Cool. Maybe write a blog post about this story ?
---
&gt;*that someone is calling your game knowledge trash level.
---
Only reason I bring it up, is because you would have to be salty to start your response with a downvote, when I am obviously not doing that to you. 
---
Cheers mate. You need some integrity, but you are at least easy to read, so you don't have to admit to being wrong for us to get it. 
---
That too
---
Can we please get traction on this? This shouldn't even be a difficult thing to implement. Like dedicated servers if we get enough people actually asking they might seriously consider this. 
---
As characters get added it's becoming more and more difficult to max any single character out, let alone all the killers+a survivor. 
---
I don't like the iridescent shards from bloodwebs however, and I feel like the numbers should be tuned a bit. I think iridescent shards should remain fairly rare as their primary source of income (I imagine) is micro-transactions. 
---
Play survivor to find out what they do to dodge you.
---
why even use red on black... :D
---
When it's a Hag, using urban is good, but I absolutely hate people who crouch walk from halfway across the map to get me. I usually go into struggle by the time they get here. I appreciate the Megs more.
---
Yeah season rewards are massively outdated. 25k blood points = 1 games rewards as killer or 2 survivor games. I think they need to up the max cap and balance this better for rank 5-8 200k is nothing. a daily quest is 25-60k lol
---
I've had my fair share of instances when I would just love to call it quit on the game. Nowadays I only play with my friends cause it makes the experience a little less stressfull as you and your friends share the same sentiment towards camping killers and such.
---
The perk idea is great 
---
She swung as I jumped through the hatch, trying to grab me out last second to hook.
---
While I like the idea of getting more shards, getting some per blood web completion is just *too* much. I want more but I don‚Äôt want to be swimming in them. Plus, more shards will result in higher store prices.
---
The end of season rewards however, that‚Äôs spot on. Overwatch did it since it‚Äôs very first competitive season, makes me wonder why DbD never had it to begin with.
---
Bro what do you got against him?
---
Movement speed has less to do with a killer being decent in a chase than it might seem. Freddy his 115% movent speed, but still has the worst chase game out any of the killers. The Hillbilly also has 115% but other than his ability to break pallets and instadown survivors, he doesn't have much to help him in a pallet loop. His strength comes from his map presence, not his chase potential.
---
LOL. Sure, when there's a trillion posts a day complaining about lobby dodgers a comment saying a Killer was being polite in offering an alternative to being dodged is "entitled." Whatever you're smoking, keep it away from me. I like having brain cells. The Killer wasn't salty, they probably have a shit monitor or shit lighting that makes it really hard to see and prefer not to handicap themselves and wanted to be nice and offer an alternative to just outright dodging. The Survivor said no, in the most toxic way possible at that, so the Killer dodged.
---
Just because you're an entitled brat doesn't mean everyone else is, too.
---
Of course you'll pip that's why babies camp it's an easy win you can achieve for not even playing the game.  That being said the very specific situation you outlined is called Survivor caused camping and that's a little different and on them.  Though I would switch targets to the farmer personally because it's not the person on hooks fault they're a potato farming douchebag.
---
At the chest area could you please add more visual clothing? It just bothers me :P. But you don‚Äôt have too if it‚Äôs a little too much.
---
Cuuu7te üñ§üíô
---
People saying this game is grindy crack me up.
---
You don't have to prestige every character, just one. You can get the perks you want from the store.
---
Name another game where you can prestige a character or weapon .... and NEVER even use that character or weapon! 
---
no
---
No
---
I get Gen-Rushed to shit. I bring NOED to clean up 
---
Nah fam
---
this should be tagged salt
---
Why tho
---
Woah woah woah, broken keys are just free bond, what're you on about?
---
Yeah not sure why he posted this here. Maybe he thought it would get him a lot of upvotes or something. 
---
I think he was trying to pick him up, and didn't realise he was already jumping in.
---
yes it is
---
It‚Äôs as if you whispered ‚Äúshhh, stay low and she won‚Äôt find us‚Äù. Instead he yells ‚ÄúYEAH! I‚ÄôM FREE BITCH!!‚Äù and runs off. A great scene for a comedy.
---
No matter where he posts it. All you can see is a bunch of lowlifes trying their best to make someones day worse. 
---
OP I dont know you, and I dont have any right to say this but by this video you appear to be a piece of shit and deserve that shit to be served back at you.
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. You have no idea how many games I‚Äôve loaded into, only to see I‚Äôm Claudette or Nea..
---
It was a joke, jesus.
---
The devs don‚Äôt want face camping in the game. Thats why they make you lose points for doing it. Why not go further and prevent Myers from face camping with it. You‚Äôre getting mad when your strategy is called out for its stupidity.
---
It is true. I do get very rare items per bloodweb so yeah. Even ultra-rare comes within 1-2 bloodwebs after each other.
---
If you're a killer that needs rare addons to succeed, prestige is worth it. Survivors, benefit from it by getting an insta heal every bloodweb pretty much.
---
&gt; Imagine getting upset that someone gave you -1 imaginary internet points
---
Howdy! ü§†
---
This would be EPIC
---
why doesnt he smack someone?
---
look at ur recent players
---
I feel even worse for people that have had it as killer. Thankfully, it's only happened to me as a survivor, probably because I tend to put my controller down during the waiting times.
---
Picture of just MM?
---
The devs don‚Äôt want face camping in the game.
---
Git gud
---
This is actually the best post I have ever seen on this subreddit all of these are things that should be in the game already. I dont know how I feel about the perk change idea, but the other ideas are much needed. It amazes me that they made the concept of seasons and devotion with no rewards at all implemented.
---
Why did you create a bot account just to comment on this?
---
Howdy partner!
---
I think it could be more of a "Well we want this kind of percentage" and bhvr isn't having it in Asia psn, idunno if that's how it works or not but I imagine there's a conflict of interest somewhere.
---
Struggle.
---
'dieing state'? 'Movment'? The new killer is... Lack of a ability to spell.
---
Nope. It‚Äôs a visual glitch that a lot of people have been experiencing lately, they almost certainly DCed and the game just didn‚Äôt show it.
---
That's why I explain after they send a salty message in return then I tell them all the moments that they outplayed me or did well. :P
---
Oh no. Playing game. I'm shook.
---
Well you're at lower ranks, the killer might not even know that what they did was bad manners. Or they just wanted to get it over with because those games are so boring
---
Once you get higher up in ranks, it‚Äôs rare that you will get camped. Good killers usually don‚Äôt camp.
---
Haha! I guess I wrote something on the page on top of this one with a heavy hand and it indented on this sheet. What I wrote though idk
---
Tea bagging and clicking are what makes you toxic? Because neither of those things actually have an effect on anything. To your point though, I have never played with or against someone I would call toxic, unless you count survivors who can't hook rescue and let the killer farm me
---
How dare he, kill you when he knows that the ancient written rules of the surviors forbid thee
---
I like it, but they will never give you more Shards. That would mean less real money on DLC/skins.
---
spam ADADADAD and move desired way. forward or back while facing the other way. theres tutorials on yt I think
---
You got talent man!
---
oh
---
Unpopular opinion but,
---
If you have a problem just dc?
---
It basically ignores you're entire games work and is a douche move, but so is standing at a hatch for longer than a minute
---
&gt;Am I the only person that‚Äôs cool with DS and NoED?
---
I know I am tired of people whining about either. They are perks, tools to be used--I don't see how that plays a role in a person's merit as a player. If anything NoED make things exciting, survivors can't get cocky when this is being played. It shows the game isn't over and you need to speed things up. 
---
What episode was this?
---
You should see her in a cornfield on console, its as if the killer had only feet to play with
---
[removed]
---
there was a really fucking rude comment and now it's gone i think the spirit is trying to bully me
---
Lol, now you're just getting defensive because you've lost and anyone can see that. Not only do you keep using ad hominems to try and make me seem inferior, you also keep acting all omnipotent and somehow knowing what exactly I implied lol.
---
   This is an anti survivor post, and I'm not toxic. Running after knowing the killer is gonna break a pallet IS the correct thing to do and you've obviously never played survivor if you don't know this. Yes I play killer and no, ten seconds isn't going absolutely destroy your game.
---
  My sentences are clear... Yours? Not so much. 
---
Sink more hours into the game basically. Play killer and survivor to learn both sides better. 
---
When I was at 100ish hours, i still felt like I was new to the game. Now as im getting close to 400 i feel quite confident playing any role, any rank.
---
Becuase its not an achievement?, i mean i got to rank 1 before, just by leveling up the pig when she first came out. if there's gonna be a reward then perhaps the ranking system needs to be checked... Again
---
So After Laurie I said which means WGLF Dead Hard Deliverance and Breakdown. Lithe and Alert are from Feng Min. 
---
David‚Äôs two perks are interesting, yes but with their own natural weaknesses. WGLF doesn‚Äôt do anything in game besides provide BP. It assists in the grind but more often than not, you‚Äôre not getting its full value and even when you do, it‚Äôs not like the perk helps you in the trial. Dear Hard is also a good perk only in the sense that against a player of equal skill, it works once. A killer will remember you have DH and bait it out afterwards. Not to mention there are numerous times where people can count using the perk, getting exhausted, however still getting downed. 
---
Deliverance is like Adam‚Äôs other perks: Nice and balanced but not extremely powerful. Deliverance is like the better version of Slippery Meat. Yes it can help you Kobe but it not only has a pre-use stipulation meaning if you‚Äôre the first person hooked it‚Äôs useless, if you get camped, it‚Äôs useless as well, but it only helps during the first stage so if you‚Äôre in solo and can‚Äôt communicate with your team that you have it, you could be rescued and it‚Äôs gone too. Also there‚Äôs the post use drawback of being Broken for 60 seconds so if you use it and don‚Äôt have immediate safety, you‚Äôre just more prone to being downed again. 
---
Breakdown. This perk is actually just good. As long as you aren‚Äôt getting camped, you can gauge your next move accordingly afterwards. It obviously is decent in the fact that it‚Äôs use comes only when you are on the hook, like Kindred.  Breakdown will only ever work twice and that‚Äôs fine that you get it‚Äôs use in that time but I would put it far from ‚Äúgod Tier‚Äù or say it comes close to being godlike. 
---
Take a step back and look at the survivor teachables that we have gotten from our last three survivors, Jeff, Adam, and Kate. They range from okay to solid. Nowhere close to godtier. 
---
Its still un fun for the person being camped
---
He raises a good point
---
Yes, because all of them are garbage design wise and/or not fun to play against.
---
Huntress = Premium‚Ñ¢ Hitboxes and annoying humming
---
Pig = Dogshit gameplay
---
Spirshit = Annoying facial animations and voice effects, broken power and drops frames if you so dare to look back during a chase
---
Hag = Proximity camp master who will spam down half her traps around the hook and slow down matches to a crawl
---
Nurse and Susie are the only killers that aren't complete trash design wise. I mean Legion is shit too, but at least you have the Susie skin.
---
For the sake or shits and giggles, give up on free shards, you get them for free through devotion, as far as BHVR is concerned that's generous enough. As to why there is nothing? Half ass thought out season mechanic is my best guess.
---
*Now I won't kill you on purpose...*
---
Howdy gamers
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
still waiting?
---
Off yourself if you unironically think that.
---
Because that's true. 80% of female killers' design is garbage and the most broken and/or unfun killers are all female.
---
I feel like the killer should start to realise what he's been doing the pass few years and slowly change into a person who shoots out unicorns and laughs in rainbows longer he stands by a hooked survior
---
I meant your point was fair, not the game. The game most certainly is RNG, and the sooner new players are forced to accept that they'll die sometimes, the faster they'll become good teammates.
---
I just hope all your other drawings have more secret messages we can piece together !
---
I like it but it's not going to happen. The DBD devs have time and time again pushed out unwanted cosmetics in lieu of fixing any of the game biggest detractors, i.e. Rampant connectivity issues, numerous graphical bugs, and general game balance, to name a few. No chance in hell they'll subsidize the only "content" they've been pushing for months on end. 
---
Okay.
---
If it's not an achievement, then why even have it? Like you said, it's easy to do. There's no genuine skill discrepancies between low ranks and high ranks overall, higher ranks just tend to have more opportunity to play so progress further before resetting. 
---
They all dcd before they got hooked
---
KIllers get points for the lanterns too. So when you take it and die anyway, you wasted the lantern. 
---
It's bad man. Real bad.
---
This is honestly a really great idea.
---
As someone who religiously mains Claudette to utilize her tier three bloody clothing, I‚Äôve never thought to purchase any of her cosmetics from the shop because she‚Äôs next to invisible with them on.
---
Well i used a couple of ebony today mostly to end games quickly and get fast blood points.
---
Not really my intend to make it suck for the ones i was playing against
---
I usually run off for a while maybe pop a gen to show I'm not after the hatch then sneak back or frankly just give it. I don't have time for that bs
---
Why do people think SB is useless now? Did something get changed? 
---
Just played several matches today where survivors quit because they were about to be hooked. Its only 2 points for me. 
---
A Shit thing to do, hopefully they get caught of gaurd and get a ban for dc'ing in the future.
---
Ah, fair, I've got similar with the pig right now, she's still low level, so I don't have many perks to choose from (actually only got 3 perk slots for her atm!). Can't remember exactly what I run her with, but I know I've got iron grasp as a filler perk for her right now
---
Hell yeah to all of this. Mainly because they made it take months of playing to get an actually decent amount of shards.
---
Made an account just to upvote
---
&gt; tea bagging and clicking have no effect on you
---
Yeah sure, like getting insulted or flipping someone off have no effect on you. The point is to insult/taunt you, even if it doesn't affect, that doesn't make it less toxic. 
---
But yeah survivors are far more toxic, they'll either cry because they lose or taunt because they win. Killers are toxic usually when they win and even then that's pretty rare. 
---
I don't understand why they don't have any rewards anyways.. as far as I can think it's an advantage for both sides..
---
Ohhhh, course! Don't know how I forgot about that, tbh!
---
Like i've been called tunneler in games where i got my first kill when all of the survivors had already been hooked twice.
---
You are either a tunneller or a camper no matter what you do in this game xD
---
Nope I'm actually a rank 1 killer main with integrity that doesn't punish people for the boosted plays of others.  I don't need to stoop to camping or hard tunnel to win my games bro because I'm not a baby fresh off the boat.  If I see a farming dickhead survivor I switch to them and essentially it's a trade anyways you're still getting a hook.
---
Still faster to kill you lol
---
Oh no your points! 
---
You're likely to get at least 1-2 people who know how to make a save vs a Hag for instance. AKA crouch when near likely trap spots.
---
That would have been nice as well but I feel like her hair sticking up adds a bit of Japanese wackiness(forgot the name of the long neck spirits but wacky spirits like that) to her which was greatly needed. 
---
Without her hair up she is an onryo but also just an almost naked woman running around. Seeing her hair pip up along the landscape is scary.
---
Dude. I doubt your rank 1 for l;letting survivors go free so don't even lie. Survivor unhooks in front of me, they die, end of story. You are just an angry entitled survivor. You've made the mistake of lying to a legit rank 1 killer. You are nothing but a whining entitled little kid liar. Keep complaining. It wont make a difference. 
---
It's 3AM stop making me laugh üòÇ
---
No you‚Äôre not, it‚Äôs not like you asked for it. Plus why would you want to waste your add ons just because someone DCed on the loading screen? Not your problem man, they can just take the loss and move on to the next game. 
---
Ahaha that happened to me yesterday. I was the last alive, looking for the hatch. Everything's quiet as I'm urbaning around, deciding to check the exit Gates first. Minding my own business when a hatchet flies inches in front of my face
---
Its sad that you thought people were going to laugh along with you and applaud your bullying. Its not cool nor funny, its just annoying. So high five for that
---
Bro you're noob is showing.  Not only am I a rank 1 killer every month but I do so playing mostly the weakest killers in game ie Wraith, Trapper, Pig, etc...  I don't run NOED I don't camp and I don't hard tunnel.  But obviously from this conversation I can see how you "earned" your rank 1.  Playing killer is a joke these days with the removal of the pallet vacuum and rework of building spawns.  With smart decisions and mind games you can end chases reasonably fast there's no need to play such a rank 20 playstyle you obviously utilize to get your rank.
---
Practice in kyf
---
hopefully you remember me bc it was a positive experience haha :P what's your psn?
---
You are a liar. Also I do not camp, I only hit the survivor running towards the hook. Now u are making shit up. Dumb Americans man.
---
You are a whinny baby entitled lying American survivor who not only cries in chat, but also in reddit.
---
Initially I had it typed up where you had to stand completely still in order for it to not be able to see you, but figured that might be a bit much. 
---
I see your point, changing it back
---
:(
---
I have disgraced my keyboard, its time to end this
---
They only get another 10 seconds if they're terrible or it's late game and pallets are all gone. 
---
Seriously lol I‚Äôve seen this one a whole lotta times, at least it‚Äôs accurate
---
F
---
It only effects you if you let it
---
Sorry, affects
---
I'd be the survivor who gets stabbed by the unicorn all the way on the other side of the map while I'm minding my own business &gt;.&lt;
---
Snap
---
Dude everything I've said is 100% true.  This is getting really really sad.  And you've admitted to camping and tunneling farmed survivors.  If you want proof I'll happily send you a screenshot of my killer.  I play on PS4 username is  same as reddit Weirdodin.  Send me a message and I'll respond with a pic.  Then you can come on here and apologize publicly for accusing me of lying about rank.
---
the GoLdEn BluR LAd 
---
No.
---
Howdidily-Ho neighborinos!
---
It comes with its risks like being moried by rancor or tunnled with dying light
---
personally I think perk tiers are utter garbage. just let us buy the perk out right. 
---
ayyyy sent :P 
---
Jake, especially with a cowboy hat. I am a cowboy hat Jake main.
---
i love this
---
Ok... Why do we have Pile of shit with Michael Myers mask ingame when we can have this perfectly made model?
---
You're right people that stand there should get a ban... 
---
So enjoy your ban.
---
Play something else then and stop posting here.
---
The game was free back in August so it has a pretty healthy playerbase. Survivor matchmaking is fucking wrecked right now though. 
---
They gotta make up for that game what was it called? Garden of death? Eh who cares they just fott1a make that money
---
My favorite add-on to use and to play against &lt;3 Especially with the terror radius suppression
---
If you play all day everyday then sure. Just shoot for 3-6 coins since thats more realistic
---
RIP friends
---
And it only takes 12-ish seconds for them to heal up. I mean, big whoop, you injured one. That's not going to slow them down by much. Less so if they're healed by another Survivor. 
---
Nah, I asked the guy what it looked like on his end (survivor) and he said it was wild so I guess I was just t-posing the whole match. 
---
Best part is that hatchet she threw only got so close to me because it was a *complete dead miss* on the Bill.
---
Just wanna say, if the survivor on the hook is about to start struggling it *is* actually worth sprinting over and triggering traps anyways
---
Good idea 
---
Hahaha okay 
---
Is this what happens after Za Hando?
---
he just takin a break
---
In reality though our level of complaints isn‚Äôt going to make them go any slower. It‚Äôs a business not a high school relationship. They aren‚Äôt gonna pout and go slower because they got their feelings hurt.
---
At what point is that one survivor not worth it anymore.
---
I am guessing that you have empathy too?
---
Exactly, i actually do way worse when i play with friends because we don't take the matches serious and just messes around.
---
Of cource there's demolish groups out there, but most of them are so alturistic that they usually do nothing all game but save their friends. 
---
probably xD
---
Howdy üëâü§†üëâ
---
I feel like tonight has been especially bad
---
He should have just done the gens then!
---
Ah
---
Spongebob is a pathway to memes most will call...unnatural 
---
As killer? Try to wiggle them around a bit until you are standing on the hatch to block it.  Then alt+tab and go watch some Netflix.
---
I think I made that very clear. Looping in this game takes virtually no skill, and the amount of loops available borders on pathetic. You say some stupid shit like "killers are incredibly OP" and that just signals to me and every other person that is a legit rank 1 player that you have no idea what you're doing; if you made it to red ranks, it was by sheer game volume. 
---
Four solo players at rank 1 can embarrass a killer already, SWF just makes it faster and more painful. Even if you're playing the Nurse, who is widely considered the best killer in the game, you're still putting out substantially higher effort than the survivors due to how hard she is and how punishing her mistakes can be. 
---
Getting 2 gens is fair game??? At red ranks if you don't have ruin 3 gens are done in 3 minutes and i can do 2 gens in 5 minutes if im not interrupted. 2 gens is not fair game, if it was 4 gens it would be fair game. You escape through exit gates not hide until ur team dies and gets the gens and then escape
---
It‚Äôs funny you mention it because I‚Äôve been rank 1 survivor for as long as I can remember and with all the talk about deranking lately I decided I was gonna keep myself in purple ranks for this reset and what a difference it makes. I feel like I can play a wider variety of killers and builds while not completely sweating my fucking dick off. Survivors are good enough that I‚Äôm not just wiping the floor with them but your typical frustrating to go against SWF groups are all mostly sitting at rank 1. The last few weeks have been the most enjoyable time I‚Äôve had in this game in a little while. 
---
Dominance? Asserted
---
Hotel? Trivago
---
They actually can't jump lol okay ill try that next time 
---
Think about it. It's such a situational perk. Assume that you are working on a gen near a t wall. The killer comes for you. You start running for one of the windows in the t wall. Why would you even need to run at light speed for that? 
---
The only times it would be greatly helpful (more than any other exhaustion perks) is when the gen you are working on is far from any loop. But otherwise it is a bad perk. 
---
Dead hard is useful everytime in a chase. No other perk comes close. 
---
The whites of the eyes should be an off-white, and the shading should give them a rounder feeling. The color of the dirt doesn't say 'dirt', &amp; it should have more of a textured feeling to it.
---
You should also decide what your light source is &amp; where it is, because right now it seems a bit all over the place.
---
All in all once you explore more with textures and add more dramatic shadows and more logical highlights, it'll be looking pretty good. You've got a good start.
---
When they get 4 gens then they are worthy of a hatch escape but only doing 2 gens is a no no its to easy for them
---
Im letharface so he just stood there 
---
Error
---
Most of the time I just truck in there and pop all her traps and try to drag her off rather than go for the unhook.  The other survivors will take that time to get a safe unhook...
---
They never do.
---
Actually I had that bug earlier. Or something similar. I held the lantern all game, cause the poor clown didn't do to well in the forest, I got hooked in front of a gate, lost my lantern but thanks to a claduette with a firecracker I escaped. I still got 45 points though, i didn't get to go back for my lantern. It's only happened that once though.
---
As killer I can't break all the lanterns simply because I can't find more than two of them for some reason.
---
I don't think its ever been good.  It kills your mobility too much when you're trying to hold your SB.
---
If it works, it isn't stupid.
---
That Spirit got 3 kills and had someone DC with earning a crap load of blood points. Meaning that Spirit had plenty of chases, hits, downs, power use, and hooks. Those amounts of points don't happen without the Killer doing the work for them, but that Spirit was simply "basement camping" according to you.
---
You got beat for your team making bad plays. And looking at the wildly varying ranks for those Survivors, it feels like a 4 man SWF to boot making your beatdown that much worse.
---
Welcome to high ranks. You are suppose to be good at the game to be in them. Don't complain when you get challenged once in a while.
---
Honestly if you want my opinion, flashlights aren't even very useful anymore as is. Blinding at pallets doesn't work nearly as well as it used to due to the visual change (the new effect goes away quicker, or at least it feels like it does). Going for saves is *extremely* situational and requires the killer to A) be a in a bad position and B) be stupid enough to pick you up in an open area without taking a look around first. And besides...if they're looking to get a flashlight save, that means they're not doing gens, and that means they're wasting a lot of time if and when they screw up.
---
Broken keys with aura reading are more useful than flashlights to me, as a solo player. 48 meter bond means I can check to see if there's anyone around me (broadly speaking, 48 meters is a lot) to do a gen with, to heal/be healed, or if anyone's going for a hook save. I feel it's highly underrated. Sure you could run a toolbox/medkit instead, but I'm one of those types that doesn't generally bring an item in anyway.
---
Maps though...only time I run a map is when I'm sick of NoeD. I feel like they should just add totem tracking to the green map and call it a day. Maybe make it so everyone can see the aura by default too. They really are too situational for me.
---
Oh boy, if this went through it would be tuft if hair tombstone Myers every game.. I‚Äôd uninstall.

---
Either they make it 4 gens to prevent hatch camp or do 2 gens and hatch closes after 5 minutes if nothing is done and then doing a gen opens it again or brutal strength allows you to close the hatch 
---
You're rank 14, that's why.
---
Green ranks aren't worth playing. It's 90% Trappers who circle the hook endlessly and only ever chase the first person they hit.
---
I feel like I have pretty decent control over my emotions when I die in a video game. Maybe dark souls has calloused my soul
---
I mean, it is a little unbalanced because a killer needs a perfect game, 5 envelope offerings, breaking all lanterns and hooking each survivor on a different hook every time to just get close to 40 points. Whereas I make out with 45 points almost every survivor game. I usually get 20 points for killer every game though and they don‚Äôt last as long as my successful survivor games. 
---
It's just a game after all
---
Ive only had this game for 3 weeks so it's pretty annoying when I'm still sorta new, even though I've sunk 100 hours into it already.
---
I guess the question is, if he ran off would you have followed? The smarter thing to do would be never go to the hatch at all and just 99% al the gens by each other while you stood at the hatch. And then completed them all one after another. 
---
They looked at me funny
---
They don't bother me.  It's in the game, use it.  Streamers and content creators need to create drama and inspire their followers to feel something.  They're going to find something to pick and hate on, and it will spread through the masses.  This community has the largest group of babies I've ever seen outside of a moba.  Just play the game the way it is designed and enjoy the experience... it isn't that serious.
---
Guy dced start of match, wasn‚Äôt a swf. By basement camp I mean she downed me, put me in basement, then immediately returned and body blocked the exit, twice. They got a lot of the BPs farming with the last guy. Also, I‚Äôve been constantly playing against rank 2s, or with a rank 2 against. The balance rn is terrible.
---
~~congratulationsyouandeveryoneelsehasseenthis~~
---
You could just post your good save without the pity upvotes bait tacked on
---
Are you a serial liar?  You are claiming that you didn't post this 2 hours ago in this thread.  Copy and pasted again from your post 
---
This is only ok if you never criticize anyone else in the game , which obviously isn't going to happen. No one can say I'm free to do what I want, then turn around and complain about d strike, camping, noed, etc. Unless you've never criticized anyone ever, this argument doesn't make sense
---
Huh? There are like no Trappers in green rank. That's where my survivor is right now
---
howdy!
---
No I did not lie once but you have lied tons in this chat especially when the truth is right above you. Clearly u are the serial liar. Also you own a PS4, which is even sadder. PC master race. REKT!
---
I wish it was his nip slip overalls but other than that, he‚Äôs a sweetheart. 
---
You know when all you do is look at a picture but the stock glass breaking sound effect still plays in your head right on cue.
---
I really didn't have the good pics for him. But thanks 
---
I saw 18 within 30 yards of each other on the Freddy map when I got that glitch.
---
I think you don't understand what I'm saying? I'm not saying they should change characters, I'm saying that the fake-out was unnecessary.
---
You are beyond pathetic to lie about not posting something that is literally still in this thread for all to see.  Surprised you haven't went and deleted it yet.  You are a lying trolling piece of baby rank 20 camping shit.  I despise killers like you because people that play scummy like you make us real non crutch playing rank 1 killers all look like filth.  Learn to play and git gud noob then you can climb the ranks without the baby camps and tunnels.
---
I save my brown medkits to use with instaheals
---
Poor killer
---
Stop half-reading things, no one is defending the killer.
---
I don't think those demands from the killer were necessary. If a fake out is what it takes for him to stop holding the game hostage than so be it 
---
Just do gens and let the hooked player die. The camper will learn not to camp pretty fast if everyone does gens (unless he's in purple/red ranks)
---
They'll shut down the shards immediately cuz we all need bacon
---
Fuck the haters, well done
---
Id let her eat me
---
My couch is pretty far from my tv :( I miss survivors all the time. I'm also supposed to wear glasses but ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Absolutely you know I whip out the Stupid Sexy David plays too but my Nea is still bae 
---
If he didn‚Äôt respond enthusiastically to think, he‚Äôs not worth it.
---
Nurse is the easiest killer in the game.  The 2nd and 3rd time I played her (after I learned she had 2 blinks) were 4k perkless.
---
[Playing tier 4 Mikey be like](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a6A2WhUcNec&amp;t=42)
---
Thanks for attempting to explain, at any rate :)
---
If by "more skilled" you mean more DS, Adrenaline, Insta-heals, NOED, Moris, and Black Wards, then sure. 
---
I was saying that regardless of your rank you didn't earn it legitimately because you tunnel survivors off hook and camp which is exactly how rank 20's play.  Your rank may be 1 but your playstyle says 20 all over it.  One of us has lied consistently on here and it's the troll I'm inexplicably still feeding. 
---
Every killer already has a win rate of over 50%, why would you want to increase that? 
---
Ah yes, because the shrine is always so reliable and always gives me what I want. 
---
You are just a noob killer. That's why you are at rank 1 by tunneling. Play without it and tell me how many kills you get per game
---
Nah, spirit and hag are better than her but she sure af doesn‚Äôt need instadowns. 
---
It's preference really. I would say Sprint burst is best for people who want to be able to launch off a gen or after an unhook ASAP. The down side to the perk is your inability to run without blowing the perk, which can feel annoying but it genuinely doesn't feel like that gets in the way of my play very often, you really just adapt to it and play around having to go exhausted if you want to run anywhere.
---
That being said, I'm not someone who likes to get chased (more of a stealthy player), and lithe and balanced landing are probably a lot better for people hoping to keep the killer in a long chase or who want to be able to run around the map with no concerns about exhaustion.
---
It keeps telling me there‚Äôs an error 
---
I would love this!
---
Thanks for playing like that. I do that too. I have come across probably 4 killers like us on PS4. Everyone else is a fucking  tryhard bitch.
---
I really hope BHVR puts in the seasonal change at the very least. I would play more often!
---
Happened to me once. Turns out I'm not so hot playing as L1 Pig with no add-ons.
---
This is the single most irritating change they've made for some time.
---
Nurse because the only way to counter a good one is to use stealth, and all Killers except Doctor and Freddy are weak to that anyway.
---
Terror radius is a pretty big distance on some killers. What if you hook a survivor in a jungle gym and then get looped around it for the next 40 seconds by an overly-altruistic teammate. 
---
Yeah sadly it‚Äôs the rank. I‚Äôm rank 14 and I always try to never face camp. I also try not to tunnel. If I hit them by accident I leave them. 
---
Damn. You are sad. 
---
He is sad as hell. Better to not waste your time.
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where the void goes‚Äù
---
Yes.
---
He looks scared
---
I just said terror radius because with most killers that not that huge but it could also be within a 5,10 meter range.
---
And i didnt think of that tbh, maybe when the killer is within 10 meters and isnt showing enough movement that then this counter activates.
---
Blatant lies about gameplay against rank 15 shitstain survivors.
---
How pathetic can you get?
---
That shitty hitbox.
---
Nope. Play as you like.
---
When you consider how many trails everyone plays they should just write it off to bad luck. That's basically what I do when it happens to me.
---
Lol tell me about it.  So much face camping filth on console.  The event has made it so much worse for some reason.  
---
Even on the console? I think nurse is bewty
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross!
---
Honestly I let survivors go a lot. I had a game as Mikey a few weeks ago, they were the most potato group ever; double hooked everyone before I went for any kills, 5 gens left and never went to EW3; last guy just kind of looked up at me when I found him on a gen. Felt bad and let him get the two gens and carried him to the hatch. Turns out he was the rank 20 in a SWF and he had just got the game. 
---
So if you get me on Mikey on PS4 and your team gets fondled like that and you‚Äôre the last one alive and didn‚Äôt act like a toxic bag of ass during the game, I‚Äôm more than likely going to let you go, especially with a Kobe 
---
It ain't much but its honest work
---
The entire point of his idea was to prevent survivors from having a bad experience and dying literally the first time they get on the hook. It is unfair and ruins the game. I didn't listen to the responses that were made and I just responded to the original comment, so yeh
---
Lol why even hit skillchecks
---
If you wait long enough. I haven‚Äôt played Killer for almost 2 months because I‚Äôm trying to hit those brown ranks again
---
You didn‚Äôt bring the OP add ons knowing it‚Äôs a 3 man. Not your fault. It‚Äôs hard to kind of let one have the hatch if you have insta down. 
---
On PC it isn't even a discussion it's Nurse.  She completely bypasses all chase mechanics.
---
On Console it would have to be Billy best map pressure in game with a permanent instadown that isn't very difficult to use with practice.  Nurse would have won here too if only the frames weren't such shit.  I've got nothing but respect for nurse players on console.  You brave, crazy bastards.
---
1. Find survivor
---
2. Go behind a wall near them without them seeing you
---
3. Uncloak behind the wall and use your big boi speed to give em a snack and a jumpscare
---
And then if they get you in another game they go Judiths/Red Tuft of hair Myers and you die first. (And your whole team after)
---
No. Get better sure, but dont BM, it's useless, it shows you are an asshole and it can get some killers to snipe you.
---
What's the context though? There's nothing Fallout-related in the image.
---
‚ÄúBing bong boi on a suppressor‚Äù strategy right here
---
Your numbers are way too high. I think 250k would be a better reward for rank 1, and decrease accordingly. 
---
There doesnt have to be one, I guess I am just too used to everyone in Reddit knowing meme formats and all of that
---
hmmm ill try reposting it
---
i agree with the bloodweb past 50 and season rewards. except the shards from leveling past 50.
---
"over here officer thats them right there "
---
this dude is on a level of shitpost that I can't even *fathom* holy shit I'm in awe
---
I kinda wish they would. It'd give the [unused Firecracker add-ons](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Items#Unused_Items) a chance at seeing the light of day.
---
I like the perks but if you put them on a killer that are, perhaps, not exactly blind, it is way too powerful.
---
try it now
---
I don't know about Billy being the best on console.
---
Spirit has about his level of map pressure, and while she doesn't have an instant down, she's even more mobile and harder to outplay than Billy IMO (since he suffers from looping as much as any other Killer). She's a bit more add-on reliant than he is, but AFAIK this discussion isn't tossing add-ons out the window (and most people play with them anyway).
---
Not thicc enough
---
My name irl is Phill (or something along those lines) and even I don't call wraith that. You guys must be real close
---
Should have just done gens 
---
I call him Philly Cheesesteak when I terrorize my friends TBH
---
Why can‚Äôt the pig oink at the survivor until they die 
---
yea it is
---
It shouldn't work, but you're almost guaranteed 1-3 kills a match.
---
i love you
---
Hahahahahaha the classic near killer maymay, ithink you may have *killed* me with that epic le funny joke
---
Complaining about tunneling says more about you than the killer.
---
Wait... Is cheese steak a thing?!? What have I been missing.
---
Wraith can be terrifying honestly
---
4 second dream transition reduction is pretty scary, I want to give him some credit for downing people quickly, but he used that reduced terror radius to camp and tunnel people down. I think it's fair to be annoyed about that, especially during an event.
---
Yea, if you don‚Äôt think so then 
---
Bing Bong Your Opinion Is Wrong
---
Point taken, next time I'll draw him extra thicc
---
Wow he has make your choice? That‚Äôs a wasted perk by not going for the unhooking 
---
Howdy, partner.
---
Jesus Christ this. Everyone complained about it last year. The devs never learn.
---
Not sure how devs can make more people play killer. 
---
This event certainly doesn't help obviously though
---
I'm surprised I play casually (normally average 10-15 games a week) and I'm rank 8 surv right now, in the old system I would usually hit my skill ceiling going around rank 12 as I'm mediocre at looping, and can't juke.
---
I'm not playing much better, but now I keep pipping.
---
Everyone complaining about this is only PS4 so far maybe it's because PS4 triggers are a bit sensitive
---
Spirit is a top 4 killer imo.  Strong but she has a fairly large learning curve.  And if we're talking about getting looped she's only a 110% speed killer which makes her even more susceptible to loops.  She relies entirely on mind games and predictive phases in to hits.  Billy is much easier to play with a 2 second or whatever recharge time for gen to gen mobility.  Her recharge time is far worse and she can't make it end to end with her ability.  The insta down is a constant threat and not very hard to use and also makes many survivors panic and prematurely toss pallets.  Billy can be played with zero add ons and still be a beast which is a luxury not many killers can claim.  I'm with you in thinking she's pretty great but placing her over Billy is a bit of a stretch.
---
No lie, I've had the same situation word from word.
---
The counter is to bust out all the gens and he only gets one kill and depips.
---
It's a good idea, but if this were to happen I think we need to increase the rarity of some items. Slightly decrease the chances of Very Rares and Ultra Rares and make the Rare green Mori a purple Very Rare. 
---
I already kinda feel like, in the games current state with BBQ and Puddings/Streamers, that many items are more commonly used than originally intended.
---
I'm pretty sure they're aware of better ideas like this. But it will never happen because:
---
A) the long monotonous grind is one of the few core systems keeping players busy and coming back with something to work towards, mostly being dictated by luck. And I don't think I need to explain how the addiction works behind that.
---
B) Assuming we're keeping the current way to earn iri shards, players who play a shit ton will have too many iri shards and will probably have everything they will want from the shop in a little over a month and have a stack of shards saved up in a few more months for whatever new shit comes out. Even IF you discard the current method entirely you're all underestimating just how much certain people play this game. Especially when a system this naive and consumer friendly is on their side.
---
Never going to happen.
---
So he's blind but can see everything as normal except no survivors lol
---
If I get a safety pips I‚Äôm at least not mad. If I get one pip, it‚Äôs a win for me! I know pips don‚Äôt matter but it‚Äôs just a nice little validation. 
---
Old man Legion gonna stab ya
---
Agree to disagree then.
---
They're both very strong Killers regardless of who's best.
---
During the winter event I got several toxic messages on my PS4 so now all messages are disabled unless I'm already friends with you. I just wanna play the game and have fun. Not deal with childish players. 
---
Everyone will constantly assume everyone else is either new to the game or lacking in intelligence, mostly because the fact that we can't see what's going on in each other's heads makes us look stupid to each other. I wouldn't worry about people assuming the worst of you because they're going to do that anyway no matter what.
---
Is it lies or is it not impressive because they're bad rank 15s?  It seems you've hedged it to try and discredit both things at once.  Are you happy?  Try and relax.  Life is short.
---
I'm pretty sure you can do this by playing on a controller for DBD and slightly tilting a joystick, this also works for survivor.
---
Howdy, oh, hi Kate.  Dang she makes me a li‚Äôl rowdy.
---
‚ò£Ô∏è
---
the only thing i see wrong with this is that the grind is part of the appeal i think. there‚Äôs something addicting about it and the sooner people are able to complete everything (like all teachable perks on everyone), the more likely that person is to quit playing with getting bored. not saying everyone, of course, because this is a very dedicated community, but it‚Äôs just a possibility 
---
Actually, I wanted to make male versions of female killers. Since usually only guys are turned into hot girls. 
---
Ave, True to Caesar! 
---
1. You buy outfits with in game currency called shards 
---
2. They can probably tell by how you play. I would recommend playing the tutorial if you haven't already. I wouldn't be to worried about embarrassing you're self if you new you're stilled learning the game so just learn as you play. 
---
3.idk sorry
---
4.i think you're able to buy the new skins after the event
---
5. I would say just play who ever you want. But Claudette and meg have some good perks to teach other survivors and David has a perk that let's him get more blood points so you can lv. Up faster.
---
Yes
---
No way youre serious
---
I think this is great! If it wasn‚Äôt so easy to lose rank 1üò¢
---
4. Claudette is most beginner friendly in my opinion. All 3 of her teachables are extremely helpful. Self care- well that‚Äôs self explanatory. Botany helps you heal faster and empathy helps you see when and where a killer is if they are chasing an injured survivor. Empathy was by far the most helpful for me especially when I was on gens. I didn‚Äôt have to move my camera as much and worry about missing skill checks. As for the outfits honestly I‚Äôd just spend the money on a few you really like or buy the charity pack dlc and use your shards to buy perks off of the shrine. Don‚Äôt worry about embarrassing yourself we all do even us vets play like noobs at times.

Leatherface then probably that sexy bastard the Pig.
---

---
I've only ever played XBOX.
---
With that being said, I've been most successful with Spirit. Hag is a close second and she'd actually take first if she didn't get ABSOLUTELY THRASHED on occasion. I don't know what the trick is with her but when I play hag it's either 4k or depip every time
---
If you feel the stress is too much to shrug off, maybe video games isn't the best hobby. Not trying to be insensitive, but if you're taking a game super seriously, is it really a game?
---
4 people on survivor side.  1 on killer side.  your odds are terrible when there's 4...
---
only if it doesnt activate when:
---
- The Killer is in a chase 
---
- Any Exitgate is powered 
---
And make the Range about 5-10 meters, not Terror Radius, thats too much
---
I see nothing wrong here. Just a normal dbd hitbox 
---
I was talking about on live. If Gates are opened, the moment he stops camping, you get saved and run through it. 
---
You can't hold the game hostage on the lobby screen, it has a countdown timer. The fake-out was unnecessary and likely caused the players playing survivor to lose their offerings from a disconnect instead of just being lobby dodged. 
---
There's a right way and a wrong way to deal with things like this, and this was the wrong way to deal with it. OP should have been an adult and just said, 'No.'
---
Go from the shortest mori in the game to a mori that lasts four weeks.
---
That poor 1 person who voted for tapp LOL
---
Um...im guessing laurie? /s
---
It's the lack of points for the killer for the event.  They are embarrassed and won't change it because they don't like to admit they made a mistake.
---
I FOUND THIS TOO!!!  I thought they fixed it with the last patch because they said they fixed "several" windows, but I got stuck here trying to get away from a nurse.  Rough life.
---
Mama Huntress duh
---
Hags Mud Medusa plz. Eat survivor with face snakes. 
---
I want to see Huntress headbutting Dwight to death with her boar tusks.
---
God have mercy on the poor guy who gets murdered by Spirit in her weeb suit. 
---
yup, really stupid that it only works from the other side...
---
Let's break it down for you:
---
* You're full of shit saying Nurse is the easiest killer in the game. Hyperbole doesn't even come close to describing your pitiful attempt here
---
* Second or third game 4k perkless, refer to previous line
---
* Doing it against rank 15 survivors. I'm calling you trash and judging from your commentary that rank 15 is where you find yourself.
---
&gt; It seems you've hedged it
---
It seems you can't identify someone very clearly calling bullshit on you and insulting you to go with it. Do try and keep up.
---
it really depends where you are in my opinion. I know in Aussie servers green rank is ideal, it's balanced with humble but most of the time moderately good killers
---
Well definitely need a male hag. And huntress. But I just really like the trapper lol and it doesn‚Äôt even have to be sexy!
---
Aside from what has already been discussed in these comments, i personally feel like the ranking system being as flawed as it is plays a big part in people having experiences like yours.
---
It is extremely hard to *not* rank up as a killer, with high rank being more of a matter of time rather than skill, which in turn results in people being a far higher rank than they oughta be at their current skill level and getting matched with 2k+ hours people.
---
I have a good bit of experience in killer now and i manage pretty well up there, but believe me that it didn't use to be like that before and man was it miserable.
---
I finally got enough coins for the new Huntress outfit and no longer feel any pressure to do event objectives.
---
Also I had an amazing 3v1 Survivor game where (after the 3rd guy immediately disconnected once he was downed 15 seconds in) me and the Nea who tbagged with me for 15 seconds when we spawned together took turns doing gens and looping the Killer. I may have died at the end thanks to good old NOED, but it was worth it so that Nea could finish pulling that switch and run out of one those big doors.
---
thats not how you screenshot
---
In high school she was voted most likely not to touch a gen while the killer is chasing someone across map 
---
No, don't do this. Then, they will just sell Mori animations in the store and not fix the boring, uninteresting mori's of the original 3
---
Signed.
---
So killers need to run a perk to be able to counter DS. Survivors just need to find a totem to counter Noed.
---
I'm not disagreeing that the Coldwind tiles need changing, but I'm not sure I see the connection between those two things.
---
Could we make a petition for this? This is actually fantastic 
---
Obviously Clown.
---
"so many"
---
If you think 750k BP is a lot, you're insane. 
---
On top of that, 1 year at rank 1 would only give you 7200 iridescent shards which isn't enough to even buy a character?
---
Like what lol
---
What a unique build you got there. Exactly the same as 99% of the survivor playerbase.
---
The person I replied to said there was no counter. I didn't say Hexes are a good or balanced part of the game, I just gave an example of a counter.
---
Waited for an hour an a half the other night and got off without playing at all.  
---
Playing solo tonight and getting games within about 3-5 minutes.  Rank 5 getting matched with rank 15s 
---
Didn‚Äôt matter if it was 2/3/4 of us. Switching hosts,  re-readying up after a few minutes regularly.  Nothing seems to help. 
---
Honestly this has opened my mind too the possibilities of what I could do for meme value in this game
---
Nah, but you‚Äôre an asshole for using iri 
---

Surprisingly I actually win rank 8 games with wraith with make your choice 2, unbreakable spirit 2, nurses calling 1, and sloppy butcher 1.

Can you not buy any just with real money from the store like for example Rainbow 6 Siege, fortnite, overwatch e.c.t.

I‚Äôm currently long term deranking myself (just not playing Killer except for rituals) by not playing Killer for 2 months so I can bang out the Adept Killer achievements so I can finish my platinum; I consider DCing for no reason but to hunt baby players shitty, I consider what I‚Äôm doing the more...less shitty thing to do
---
Love him.. and lovely art style! 
---
I hope it was a Cannibal. Bubba loves his basement.
---
Thank you! :D That means alot!
---
Yeah but a killer who facecamps probably does not care about his rank anyway. They just want that 1 kill. They could have 50k points in a match but as long as they dont have that one kill that they waited like 2 minutes for then they are simply not satisfied.

Or you next-level them and recognize they're gonna play like monkeys trying to get their points and you use that against them because you don't care about the points.
---
Like fish in a barrel tbh.
---
Yeah, that's what I meant. :S
---
Also, thanks!
---
Cursed image
---
Kate then Feng
---
Yes I fully agree, as legion I try to double pip without killing anyone (I've done it twice so it IS possible) and I count one pip as a win as well as double pip, a zero pip or entity displeased is a loss in my opinion
---
Lol yeah isn't this zero-two
---
Hey so, personally, I think 3 options but you can still get only one after you complete the first rank 50 web would kinda keep it more in line with everything else. Two perks per web would kinda be huge. But 3 per web just makes you less of a slave to rng and seems more reasonable but idk. Other than that, good concepts, I agree most with the devotion rewards, season rewards would be nice but I'm sure they wouldn't give out shards for rank reset, but hey I'd love for bhvr to surprise me.
---
A lantern spawned inside a hook??????? I couldn't even use the hook like normal but at least I could break the lantern.
---
Lmao ‚ÄúSwitch characters so I can kill you gooder next time. Thx.‚Äù What in the fresh hell
---
His head looking like a Tic Tac
---
Cute drawing, though.
---
I never said *as* broken. I can agree that there is a difference of degrees. But one being worse does not mean the tiles are not a problem of a similar nature and that people who complain about Legion should also care about if they want to be consistent 
---
Howdy!
---
(Cowpoke cosmetics for all Survivors when?)
---
Lmao more like get bored -&gt; stop playing

Alright, gimme a minute to set up my grill.
---
*chainsaw noises*
---
I run haunted ground a thrill of the hunt on my spirit, usually by the time I get to the totem being worked on it gets finished and I get 1 kill maybe 
---
I like using Bond or Iron Will.
---
Also, I really like QnQ so I would not replace it, although lightweight is also very nice
---
I know it's not. It says in the title that it's Nea. It just gave me that vibe.
---
Thank you so much for this comment. Very useful and detailed.
---
Nice. I'll consider this discussion finished, as you've clearly run out of relevant things to say.
---
if you were awake you don't have that excuse, the lullaby isn't affected by perks/add-ons and is enough of an early warning.
---
It's fucking ridiculous man.  You basically are FORCED to play killer if you actually want to play Dead by Daylight during the event. 
---
And that being said....why is it still a problem? If there's a forced requirement to play killer to actually get a game. Then why are survivor wait times so bad?
---
Only BHVR.
---
I figure that's why most do it, but it screws the rest of your team over. If I'm really close, sure I'll walk really quick. If I'm far? I'll always use SB. The more teammates and the more hooks before death they have, the more likely you'll survive. Besides, I'd rather waste my sprint burst and save them before the killer get there than take so long to get there that the killer gets back right as I unhook them, which is what tends to happen when people crouch walk. 
---
Damn dude that‚Äôs an amazing drawing 
---
Roast who? I don‚Äôt see anyone in the picture. 
---
People have 5k play time, I have more than 1k so 
---
Knowing the devs, they probably won't do it. But if they did I'd like to see something similar to legacy fir those who've grinded p3 and all (ALL) the perks available.
---
I'm a 2016 player who barely missed the legacy date. ;-;
---
Just another reason to not get the Freddy dlc 
---
D A R N
---
Really?  I thought the lullaby was shorter too, never knew that.  Might just be that if we heard a lullaby, we were pretty much going straight into dream and pain.  Useful though, thanks.
---
That‚Äôs not how it works. For every survivor on a generator with you, you get a 10% debuff to YOUR repair speed. All prove thyself does is counter that. Therefore only making a 4 second difference. The exact same speed as it would be if you were just on different gens instead.
---
Honestly! The first time, I was like ‚ÄúDavid, you injured over there? You need heals bud- wtf, you‚Äôre on a totem?? Man, I‚Äôm getting the hell out of here..‚Äù
---
Wow, this is really awesome!
---
I've gotten so much salt by playing Spirit even halfway decently. Like I mind-game pretty well with other killers too, but doing it with Spirit seems to make people more upset than normal for some reason.
---
Nea is Bae!!!

Dude, I used a qualifier, if you can't shrug it off, do something else. I said nothing unreasonable, you're just getting tilted over nothing. I just mean if it really gets to you that much, do something you enjoy
---
They REALLY botched the hitboxes.  :(
---
Hey check out that post that was made of how often each perk is brought. NoED was a pretty high percent
---
&gt; Don't let Firecrackers spawn in chests please. If getting a Broken Key from a chest is like getting kicked in the balls then getting a Firecracker is like being kicked in the balls and given a nickle afterwards.
---
Lolwut? A Broken Key does nothing and a waste of space unless you escape with it. At least a Firecracker can be an insta-save or super clutch end game.
---
I'd rather have a Firecracker explode in my ass than getting a Broken Key from a chest.
---
Noticeable amount of players from PS4 base were banned today for exploiting the glitch 
---
With bing bing no less.

When Legion is played by Internet Explorer...
---
You're making a lot of assumptions in this discussion, though: 
---
\- Assuming that they aren't enjoying the game while also being angry or frusterated
---
\- Assuming that feeling frustrated or getting tilted means that the stress is 'too much to handle'
---
\- Assuming that it's unhealthy and abnormal to have feelings over a game, rather than the average experience
---
\- Assuming that when annoyed or angry with a game, that people don't already do exactly that: take a break and do something else, while still acknowledging that they were annoyed, angry, frustrated, or tilted by something that happened in the game before they decided to take a break.
---
I see what you mean, of course, but I do think that you should realize that it's perfectly normal for people to have feelings and that it doesn't mean they should find better hobbies? That's the only part that I'm objecting to. I don't like anyone telling other people how they should feel, or that their feelings are over-reactionary/wrong. Maybe their actions are wrong (example: continuing to play when they're tilted, reciprocating toxicity because they're upset), but their feelings are theirs and they are valid and shouldn't be diminished or undermined because you don't share them.
---
Closer*, because Michael Myers is the only true god
---
Ok, although nurse is very hard to use, and even harder on console, she is still the best killer if you can get used to her. It will take a while to get used to her though, especially on console. She is so drastically different than other killers, mastering her is like uncovering a whole different part of the game. 
---
Now, since nurse is very hard to use on console, I would suggest not starting out as her. If you don‚Äôt have any DLC, billy is probably going to be the best. 
---
With DLC, I would recommend spirit. I like to think of her as a lower-grade, easier to use nurse. With some add-ons she becomes really really good (looking at you, prayer beads bracelet). Some people have trouble using her though (honestly can‚Äôt tell you why, I basically had an instant connection with her when I started using her). 
---
A big part of being a good killer is learning how to prevent gen progress, stop loops, and track people. It will take many games but eventually you will get the hang of it and start hooking people left and right!
---
tag the devs. also, rank 20's shld get something small just to keep them going, sometimes new players can struggle at first and being unrewarded could be an oof for them
---
Oh smart smart yeah

ARE YOU A FELLOW HUNTRESS MAIN?

The game needs this I've been playing the game for 6 months and it's been a pain to level up my characters and get the perks I actually want most of the time I get perks like insidious and unrelenting which is so annoying that you have to waste 50K BP on useless perks 
---
I'm not reading that, you're making an assumption that I would

*halloween theme intensifies*
---
For the love of god, please no.
---
Stats, leaderboards, ladders, etc. will ruin this game. People will want to be shown near the top of the boards or improve their stats, which isn't a bad thing in general, but this game lives and dies on how fun it is.
---
If the boards go live then more people will be try-hard. That means more tunneling and camping, less altruism, more randoms trying to SWF (because SWF will boost your stats). That will suck any fun out of it.
---
When Fortnite went live with stats, way more people "thirsted" more than before. When EA NHL came out with CR (algorithm number based on win/loss), 90% of my friends that used to not give a shit about winning or losing, but about fun games, became salty fucking bitches about their CR.
---
DBD isn't an Esport. It doesn't need that bullshit. It's a fun game, but if everyone is try hard as a motherfucker then this game will die.
---
I literally never said it was okay. What is with people not reading posts all the way in this thread?
---
I the framrate for console is capped at 60fps and that's only for lower graphics games so it's normally 30fps. It's pretty much out of their hands I think.
---
Lets be honest they can't even push a single feature without breaking 10 other i dont think its gonna happen
---
There are add-ons for killers that will give you the exhaustion status effect üòí
---
Survivors also can't hide so it kind of balances each other out. Legion's main problem is that there is 0 counterplay, doesn't matter the tiles/maps/team. When they see you, it's over
---
&gt;I rather spend $10 and buy the Huntress skin. 
---
Thats what they want you to do. Thats why the events are tedious.
---
Killers breaking lanterns stun the progress and suvivors taking them stun it aswell. Its a simple tactic really.
---
That is a glitched hook it is always there even when it isn't. It's even better when it really is there and someone breaks it because it shows a broken hook with the hook still connected
---
Lol ikr?  With Hag I'm usually doing a hit-and-run when they start running in an untrapped area so I like Sloppy.  And hey, at least I get to keep one perk each game. 
---
The has Benn happening like before spirit 
---
*hex: sloppy butcher intensifies*
---
I guess it just comes down to taste (preference), at which point it would be stupid for me to continue arguing my preference since not everyone likes the same things.
---
It's called a "rant" &amp; they are going to do the shit regardless. Just will be nice when they finally get punished for all the bullshit they put us through. 
---
Now that I think of it there is only one shitter in dbd, and it‚Äôs on The Game. I guess that would explain why it looks run down too all hell.
---
Kate
---
I personally love running autodidact because it‚Äôs so satisfying after 3 skillchecks seeing the bar just instantly go up, especially when they have sloppy butcher and/or thantataphobpia. I know it‚Äôs not the best perk since it‚Äôs a lot of RNG, but it‚Äôs still one of my favorite survivor perks.
---
You should start a YouTube channel. Cry about your feelings and blog about it.
---
The Clown eating the survivor's pinky finger when using his ultra rare add-on. Just this one.
---
This is beautiful
---
Male Survivor: Jeff. Irresistible. Love me some thicc boy. Nice hair, face scar, badass makeup. 9/10 my sweet prince of beer bellies and death metal.
---
Female Survivor: Prolly Kate? I dunno. She's nice, love her hair, guitar is cool, interesting tattoo. 8/10 I have no cool joke for this one.
---
Male Killer: Clown. Back at it again with the thicc boys. He reeks of hunky jolly attitude and prolly knows a lot about perfume and a shit ton about bad jokes. 8/10 I'd smell his flower any day.
---
Female Killer: Pig. Hands down. Huntress is more conventionally attractive, having a human face and all, but Amanda is so tender and elegant. Adorable. 10/10 would oink again.
---
Lmfao are you offended? Did I hit a nerve? Does someone talking about your shitty play style bug you? Do you not see ALL the rants on reddit over these reasons and others? Should I expect to see your name there as well or just on mine? üòÖ
---
But that's only a percentage of the players at rank one. Not every Killer/Survivor is like that.
---
Legion being able to vault pallets is not what is wrong with him. 
---
Legion is fundamentally broken because he is balanced around Deep Wounds, which is a mechanic that doesn't function properly. 
---
Deep Wounds is built around the game *triggering and maintaining a chase*, i.e. the event scoring/chase music/etc. However, when you gain enough distance or break Loss, your timer starts ticking down and you have no choice but to start mending, despite the fact he is still very clearly chasing you.. the game just doesn't recognize that.
---
This is why you see some Legion players moonwalking, or looking at the ground.. they're still chasing you, following your blood and scratch marks, but because the game doesn't *count that* as being in a chase, you just bleed out.
---
*That's* the problem with Legion, not being able to vault quickly.
---
Are Coldwind tiles stupid? Yes, and they should be changed. But they are functioning as designed.
---
Legion, when played as designed (not abusing the "in chase" system) he's a low tier annoyance. However, played in a way that abuses the chase triggers, he becomes impossible to outplay because he stops playing by the rules of the game while the survivor has to still deal with the Deep Wounds timer. I cannot count the times I've had to run back TOWARDS Legion just so the chase triggers again and my bar stops depleting.
---
These two things you are comparing are not equal in any way. One works how it was designed (albeit stupidly), one is built on a mechanic that doesn't. Just ask anyone that has used Lithe in a chase and had it not go off because the game said "oh your not actually being chased".
---
add remember and just keep stabbing the obsesion w/o picking em up makes end game hell fun 
---
This needs to be told though to killers who bitch about gen repair speed being too fast. If doing gens is the counter to a camper, then gen speed should never be slowed down.
---
One time I was playing on The Game and the chase music started but nobody was there. Kinda broke my brain.
---
On ps4 almost all games have like 30 fps dbd can do nothing expect make the game run smoothly as possibly for ys
---
I can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer.
---
Seems like lagswitch
---
Can‚Äôt really be mad though I mean, that‚Äôs what the traps are for. I had this happen to me playing against a trapper recently and I just laughed because I knew I should have expected it. Has there ever been a trap placed that wasn‚Äôt annoying? Lmao it‚Äôs serving it‚Äôs purpose!
---
Just a way to say a full squad in SWF.
---
*thats super weird*
---
As someone who plays killer and survivor, I typically go easy. It always feels like a waste if I don't get the most out of a match, so I end up farming in these situations. Otherwise I'd walk out of there with 10k versus around 25k.
---
I can give you a extra one
---
I would say remove the safety pip, but then you would get situations where someone would depip because the killer camped them hard enough that they couldn't actually play the game
---
New killer add on
---
"Ethernet cable"
---
When pulled instant teleport to survivor 
---
I literally just played a game vs the hill Billy and used this tactic to stay alive for ages. Hahaha I'm not gonna memorize how every shape of the game is, but I get the general gist that I can theoretically run laps around the villians. Thank you for that.
---
Sloppy Butcher is better
---
I don't even have to tunnel. I can get rank 1 without even chasing. That is how skilled I am. I respect all the pallets and gens and kobes. I am Rank 1 with Freddy. I am beyond skill. You are rank 20. All killers who play on PS4 are rank 20. I get 5 kills per game. I am God. 
---
Implying the DS part was in any way a skillfull action that deserves respect.
---
Thana barely makes a difference, actually 
---
3,3% of all survivors know, what's the strongest perk in the game.  
---
Great stats, keep the work, I love them!
---
Ahh yah forgot to mention he was running that too
---
Go to derank with lvl 1 Wraith...party streamers get popped by survivors...oh boy here I go killing again.(On a side note this was my very last game of the night and they perfectly set up the last 4 gens grouped up as close as could be...1 hatched)
---
It was probably an accident the first time and you are a complete asshole.
---
r/deadbygaylight?
---
If you mean strongest, Nurse is factually the best killer in the game. The only played killer in serious tournaments for a reason. None cones even close to the Nurse.  
---
**If you meant best and greatest killer to play and enjoy your time with, obviously Legion!** Not really, but I want to jebait some people. The best allround solid killers that are also good design are probably Myers and Hillbilly. Others are good too, but either a bit too weak or so unique they break the games core playstyle a lot. (Spirit, Huntress,Hag)
---
nah he was toxic to the other teammates aswell before this
---
yes true. why don't all men be like this
---
I mean I vault a pallet mid lunge and it connects over the pallet I'll try to find a video of it
---
This is so sad can we nerf Freddie again
---
Yes please
---
yeah, the fact that it only adds a few seconds to action time. that is the counter argument. it is not that bad.
---
you clearly have never experienced tier 3 dying light if you think thana is rough
---
also Legion cannot sprint across the map. map pressure is legion's big weakness. feral frenzy has a pretty short duration. it only seems long because they're chaining hits on you which extends it. 
---
Wat. People actually die to that? Lol
---
Nvm I can't find a clip of it but if you do search it up you'll find a lot of ppl complaing episically on steam
---
Howdy partner
---
i want to agree with you but its fundamentally against my nature to side with twitch streamers who use their profile link as a name so instead ill praise mr agent on that skillful display worthy of being facecamped for
---
I don't think any male killer had a wife. 
---
Please never stop drawing these phenomenal works of art!
---
You ever just run NOED with play with your food and devour hope on speed th and go invisible? You can go from one side of the map to the other in no time at all
---
I'm on board for the season rewards, and especially the bloodweb. But I'm not sure about the Devotion. That seems wayy too OP. I mean, you can easily level up on that in one, two games max. That would be absolutely insane. Were it so easy..
---
I was gonna post a mini-rant about how they should just buff WGLF to track the killer's aura when unhooking or something similar instead of nerfing BBQ, and take this approach of buffing unused/weaker perks instead of just nerfing the most popular ones. But people have covered it numerous times in other threads. Suppressing urge now.
---
Having said that, your post is awesome and datasets are always appreciated. Few know how much work that shit takes. Do you have an estimate for how many Pigs you ran into? That's a crazy amount of NOED compared to say, Wraith, although it makes sense on both.
---
I just got the coins for huntress and stopped giving a care. It‚Äôll be a long time before I start leveling survivors for teachables.
---
I don‚Äôt know man, it‚Äôs been 8 months.
---
good drawing, love your drawings. can you try to draw the huntress again
---
Obviously it's harder to proc Dying Light. I brought it up to make a point about action time increases. Thana is negligible 
---
Not gonna lie, gives me a bit of a boner every single time I do it.
---
Gotcha. Fair point.
---
It's disgustingly effective. Great for a guaranteed win without addons. 
---
"I have 2000 hours on p3 claud and everytime i play killer i 4k at rank 20 so killers are op" -you probably
---
Most I‚Äôve gotten in a single match is 3 so far. Gimme dat survivor salt!
---
And 35k blood points!
---
What's the most efficient way to let people know that you're just farming? I tried to farm a game by grabbing a survivor and letting them wiggle out while I was near a gen and smacking it but they didn't seem to get the hint, or they were just ignoring me. I really need to max my bloodpoints for a prestige.
---
\*W E  L I V E  I N  A  S O C I E T Y\*
---
It's not a rant, it's a direct response to you fundamentally not understanding the real problem with Legion.
---
It was already pretty clear from your responses to other people that your post is an "I'm right, you can't prove me wrong" lump of idiocy, but I still gave you an explanation. You aren't here for discussion, you want a circle-jerk you clearly aren't getting.
---
So have fun with that.
---
Fair enough but that‚Äôs only one map. 
---
He doesnt, he just has the eyes, thats it. 
---
Horrible at chases?AGAINST A FUCKING LEGION?WHAT CAN YOU DO TO BE BETTER AT CHASES AGAINST A FUCKING LEGION WHO BREAKS THE CHASE MECHANICS AND MAKES THEM CONPLETELY WORTHLESS?
---
Because he is a better player than you are? Duh
---
Did you seriously come back after being whooped in this so hard you got knocked clean out of the conversation for a week? I haven‚Äôt whooped someone that hard since I slapped my pelvis into your moms cheeks. Anyone can see you lost and now you‚Äôre crawling back because you haven‚Äôt been able to think of anything else since because you‚Äôre so pathetic you can‚Äôt get over being dominated in an internet conversation. Buzz off kid, your mom and I have more business to attend to
---
Hey, it's awesome you made him work for you! When it comes right down to it, the only thing that really matters is if you enjoy playing the character or not.
---
this is amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
in the movie yeah Freddy was because he was a child murderer in the 70's and the 2010 edition he was a pedophile, I'm pretty sure a male killer was brutally murdered I can't remember who, the legion are part of a gang so it wasn't he/she.
---
was it the wraith or hillbilly?
---
She looks like Kate Winslet
---
Now make one with him shirtless 
---
Some more info:
---
I don't play Wraith, but I wanted to give him a shot since I was pumping him full of BP to get his perks. This was also my first game as a killer in quite awhile.
---
The whole game, they would Sabo hooks right as I approached them holding their friends. I managed to hook the first two, and with one gen left I got stuck downing one and having to leave them there because all nearby hooks were gone, and then their friend coming to heal when I went to find the other or watch the last gens.
---
I eventually downed both at the same time and, with no nearby hooks and also me knowing where the hatch was, I let them bleed out.
---
I'd like to see the hunter as a next drawing
---
I use budget DS, aka hoping my team pallets the killer carrying me. 
---
"if you don't like this hook, you can have this dirt" 
---
Lol, I'm sorry I don't spend my days browsing Reddit. Some of us have a job to attend. I wouldn't expect someone in, I'm assuming middle or high school, to get. Based on your lackluster choice of prepubescent-grade mom jokes, my guess seems accurate. 
---
Were you meaning to make a pun?
---
Yeah if you get camped early you'll lose a pip anyways. 
---
Tbf though the killer has the right to leave. He was just asking to give the player a chance to not wait another 20 min for a game. 
---
It's not that bad. I picked up the game in December, and I have one character at 50, and two in the low 40s. I don't play every day, mostly just a few hours a day on weekends.
---
None of the killers had a wife, and none of the males have been killed. They mostly just vanish after slaughtering a varying number of people.
---
It's okay. Lots of people suffer from scrub mentality causing irrational judgement.
---
Same makes the game 10 times better 
---
That‚Äôs actually really impressive, it would be awesome to see this in game.
---
I think you got opinion and fact mixed up
---
If you're attempting to get a rise out of me by "trolling", you're wasting your time. I'm just laughing at your pitiful attempts and watching you make a fool of yourself. Trust me when I say that I've heard worse than 3rd grade "I fucked your mom" jokes. 
---
&gt;As someone who plays both killer and survivor pretty evenly, if you can't even make 60/40 throws in favor of the survivor GO to the survivor, **just bring back the pallet vacuum**.
---
Cool story, bro. 
---
Just throw the pallet down early. 
---
Smart people don't heal vs Legion. Even at Rank 1 for every surv smart enough to stay injured,there are 10 who will heal against that killer.
---
I've got 700 hours in the game. I think most killers just don't realize what they're missing out on by wasting a perk slot on a totem that survivors spawn on 90% of the time
---
Mm just run that no mither, deliverance, ds, tenacity build. Big ol bait survivor 
---
it's a cool concept but it obscoletes wraith
---
As a killer main playing survivor just to farm for the event, I've been trying to educate killers while ranking up from 20 to 8 now. I loop most of them so many times because they respect the drop, and also most don't even seem to know what a safe pallet is, because they just run around instead of breaking it and it's like 30 more seconds before they realise bloodlust aint gonna catch up vaulting the pallet.
---
Oof man the comment section 
---
Howdy Pardner.
---
Hell yeah brother let behavior have it. Give'em fricken heck. Nah man game is filled with bugs and everyone hates them thats for sure, but the game is still addicting and fun to play. The game will never be perfect you just gotta take it for what it is. Especially since the devs have made it apparent they wont do anything to help.
---
Let me guess...you did it during the lobby wait times?
---
If someone uses flash light, I will tunnel until he\she is dead.
---
Can you please explain the rewards in overwatch and for what they can be used. I want to make a revised version of my concept that is more realistic
---
AMAZING
---
I know, it was a joke. 
---
M
---
Survivors will downvote. Dont let them win.
---
&gt;But I don't need to throw it early when I'm trying to maximize loops. I throw it at the perfect moment, get the stun, and I still get hit? wtf?
---
I hate getting hit through pallets as well ever since they removed vacuum but just the fact that you would recommend vacuum return tells me you are just a salty survivor pretending to play both roles. 
---
I just want devs to fix the issue instead of bringing back an even worse issue. 
---
Getting hit through pallets reduced substantially since they changed the killer stun moment when dropping a pallet. Sucks that it still happens but they need to keep trying to address the problem. 
---
Unless versing a killer bringing his best loadout possible and maybe even mori, survivor role is still too easy to request such absurd thing as pallet vacuum. 
---
They even went as far as making medium vault safe as possible for brainless survivors. 
---
Well getting the right load out on killer is quite important.
---
The killers job is to hook and kill anyway. Its about using the most optimal way to get the most kills.. Not to play so called ‚Äúfair‚Äù or abide to made up survivor rules.
---
Hell if this event has taught us anything is that if the killers had to abide to those rules and not have fun then this game would be dead
---
Damn she's Hexy...
---
&gt;That's the point, if you get to a pallet it doesn't matter how early you throw it, if you want the stun, you take the hit. The only way to avoid it is to drop it when the killer is far behind you and at that point it's a waste.
---
Why would you want the stun? Unless versing a Legion during his Frenzy. 
---
AFAIK pallets are meant to remove bloodlust. 
---
I am asking why he likes it, feel free to contribute though.
---
He gonna find another locker and he won't save ya!
---
It is similar to how TydeTyme the other day compared deranking to murder while making a point for breaking rules being sonething one should stand against. The point was valid in itself, but due to putting one thing way more extreme than the other into the same context it got memed and teared apart.
---
I'll give you another example of this:  
---
1. What that facecamping Leatherface did was mean.
---
2. What that Adolf Hitler did was mean.  
---
In this case the point of "being mean" is correct, yet due to the extremes being used people take issue with such a statement.
---
What video was that from again? I want to rewatch it
---
What software did you use?
---
They do often buff bad perks, nearly every patch, but theres a lot of bad perks still so they have some work to do lol

---
i have a better idea: 
---
when a hooked survivor is within a killer's terror radius or within a 10 meter range for more than 40 seconds while hooked, that hooked survivor starts whining and complaining about the killer on reddit as they die
---
Yeah, survivors can make it as hard as possible but for a good nurse player its still relatively easy depending on the map. 
---
Saboing hooks on the event is so dirty
---
no, if you want to have a good game, don't be a dick yourself. both sides are always to blame unless it's not a hostage situation or hacks/lagswitch.
---
What do you mean it's not like I got wooshed or anything baka
---
Oh no your arm is gone!
---
Rough night tonight. I finally got 3 coins, so for my blood pressure‚Äôs sake, I‚Äôm waiting it out until the event is over. 
---
The good players are in 4 man swf groups or have deranked themselves for ez wins.
---
It makes Prestige clothing worthless, I spent like 4-5 million bloopoints on those and you just come along and get them without any problems.
---
Not fair change to me.
---
Just DC for neg pips and better points in the next game lol
---
Oh i see youre a facecamper. Welcome. How is it looking at someones body for 2 minutes just to get 1 kill because you suck so much that you can only shift your full attention on only one thing at a time? What emotions do you feel when you finally get that kill after 2 minutes?
---
I mean if thats your way of experiencing fun then you are one sad soul lmao
---
Pallets do more than just that. The stun can give you enough time to hide or run to another loop. Also, a stun shows that you threw it down right at the time you should've. You wasted the most time you could have without being hit (of course now stuns usually mean getting hit) not just running to a pallet and randomly throwing it down instead of looping. 
---
Oh wow
---
Touch√©
---
Wtf hahahahahahah 
---
I think you're misunderstanding my suggestion. You would still have to unlock prestige III clothing before you could turn the in-game shop cosmetics to a bloody style as well. Much like an on/off switch that is only toggle-able once you have unlocked that prestige attire. You would still have to spend the four to five million BP to turn the items into the bloody variant.
---
Oh no, I straight out dispise the gameplay, only ever come back a few times a year when there is an event to see if the game got any better. The horror factor left me very quick but that would have been ok. The changes the devs made though... and those they didn't or can't.
---
No, 100% play both pretty evenly. 
---
Killer is literally in the best spot it has ever been. Not even pallets are safe. The one thing that is supposed to be safe is not safe. If you don't wanna trust me because I'm some rando on reddit (but believe you me west coast rank 1 survivors know me pretty well) listen to people like Tofu. 
---
Yeah if you get a coordinated 4 stack that knows how to run shack properly and abuses some nasty ass jungle gym set ups, you're still going to have a bad time. But to pretend that if you get random ass survivors at rank 1 and don't have a field day is absurd. 
---
Ranking up survivor is so mind-numbingly easy that you get immersed urban evaders who literally can't hold shift even if your stain is on them at rank 1. It's gotten so easy that I can leave the safety of Billy and occasionally meyers and venture off into F tier land and still 4k without much hassle. 
---
Killer is strong right now, combos like spirit fury/enduring, the healing nerf, perk buffs, etc. put killer in a strong spot. We don't need to also get free swings through pallets.
---
Unfortunately it‚Äôs just a bugged lobby and the only way to fix it is to back out and create a new one. 
---
A survivor once called me ‚Äúaids‚Äù. I ran ruin, discordance, dying light, and bbq &amp; chili. They didn‚Äôt get a single gen done. 
---
it really is embarrassing that I have to tell you why your correlation was very inappropriate for this sub, and frankly, unnecessary. this is not the thread (or the sub) for this kind of discussion, either. I am helping you save your integrity because what you wrote will not be perceived as the way you thought it would be. 
---
if you want to talk about in DMs, go ahead, but not here. I also suggest just discarding or editing the comments (as will I), not only because of the reason I just said, but because they are cringey, and could be triggers for other people.
---
Fair enough, I hope you can find a better game for you then ! :)
---
The tag is salt/rant maybe OP knows it‚Äôs fine to do it‚Äôs just annoying to deal with. 
---
i'm ready for this
---
Well, if your AIDs, you must've fucked them real good.
---
Stay ready for probably a couple more years
---
and just an FYI, I don't actually want them to bring back the vacuum. It was cancer. Just a vent. What I am pointing out though is that even though the vacuum was unfair as fuck, at least it was consistent. What we have now is a buggy mess of teleporting hitboxes and swings that miss by 3 feet, get stunned, but somehow magically down someone on the other side.
---
Anyone else not have this problem?
---
i knew behavior listened to the community but i cant believe they adopted my idea so quickly 
---
Adrenaline and dead hard 
---
This. This is what we need, more things to do in the end game
---
I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a fix for it but if I‚Äôm waiting more than like 20 seconds for it to fill then I just leave and start a new lobby 
---
Ace
---
that's a weak example you got there, man. you just compared two things that have nothing to do with each other. "mean" is an opinion. judging someone for something is a fact even if it's based on opinion. 
---
my example makes total sense because both are society things. someone decided it's bad to promote a channel and it deserves being judged and someone decided that it's bad to be someone you never chose to be and it deserves to be judged. it might be extreme but to me they both are the same cause none of these people actually harm anyone. 
---
people who "meme" on these things without fully comprehending these matters are just idiots. and it's not my or Tyde's fault they are. 
---
Lets be honest now... that was literally like one of the worst and pointless jokes ive ever heard
---
Feng Momo
---
Tbh I prefer brown toolboxes than brown medkits, but I always run selfcare or perks that help me go "hasty" when injured.

---
Self Care - Pretty self explanatory as the probably most used perk.
---
Decisive Strike - That extra escape can be vital.
---
Empathy - To track other survivors and the killer's movements.
---
Premonition - Little heads up when the killer is coming.
---
As you can see by me clearly holding the god damn map in the escape screen, I escaped while still holding my rainbow map and add-ons and the game just decided I didn't get to keep them anymore. What the actual fuck. I'm legit super pissed about this. I had to survive a tunneling face camping legion to get that map out the gate and I STILL lost it.
---
that's funny. i will edit it but solely cause it feels like i'll get banned even though neither your words nor the ban will ever explain to me what's wrong with my example cause i know for damn sure there is nothing. 
---
All out and secure the kills = lookkm at their faces while on hook
---
as a killer i win if i get my bp. kills are just a bonus
---
as a survivor i win if i get max chase points. generators are for nerds and tapp 
---
Sorry, what does NOED do again?
---
I enjoy playing killer when i want to mind game people. I like watching peoples reactions to my actions and try to think like they do so i can hunt them down and send them to the unholy entity. I like the feeling of accomplishment when you get all the perks you want for a certain character. I like playing with friends and having a laugh over stupid mistakes
---
Not him but make sure you're running loops and structures properly, even at Rank 1 you see killers making strange looping decisions and eating loops they shouldn't. 
---
Prestige ins't supposed to give you any rewards that enhance your gameplay.
---
I definitely go softer against 3-mans if it seems like they‚Äôre falling behind without a full team. I‚Äôm really new to the game so I know I‚Äôm not very good, and I can sort of tell when I‚Äôm doing too well due to an unfair advantage. I‚Äôll get a few smacks and hooks in but will secretly try to keep them alive: ignore them when they‚Äôre on death hook, have particularly bad chases with a lot of ‚Äúmissed‚Äù swings, etc. We‚Äôre all just here to have fun. :)
---
That being said, I‚Äôve gone against survivors that go out of their way to be toxic in spite of having an incomplete team from the start. They don‚Äôt need the handicap. ;)
---
I absolutely love your end commentüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Don't worry about it, good luck out there in the fog
---
excellent work! truly
---
The thought did struck me but I had to suppress the urge hehe.
---
That wasn't my point. Being able to loop a killer for four gens is indeed an acomplishment. Getting free by using DS however is as much of an accomplishment as holding M1 to do a gen.
---
God knows I need it. I've been trying to test the adrenaline perk but I either die or hatch it.
---
That's fucked. Try getting in touch with community managers etc, they should be able to reimburse you
---
OOF
---
He went nuts after realizing he had unknowingly been executing innocent people 
---
Oh God the Curtain Call poster. That's scary. 
---
Its not hitbox, its online ping lag. Dont play with hosts that have bad connection.
---
Maybe this can be avoided by showing rank colors (or the average if its varied) on the lobby screens? 
---
&gt;Hitboxes have 0 chance of being fixed at all until dedicated servers, vaccume pallets just compensate for the fact the killer is the only one who knows the actual distance between between the survivor and killer unless you have like 10 ping
---
Except the hit through pallets is 100% a hitbox issue that can be fixed without servers.
---
If you play killer and swing when a survivor is approaching a pallet, you can easily tell when you got an unfair hit or not and you have 0 ping. 
---
The issue being discussed here has nothing to do with ping. 
---
Finally
---
I mean yea, but if you‚Äôre playing with the intention of taking Aggro all game like the post is saying it‚Äôs basically a necessity unless you intend to die
---
You cannot break a chase unless the killer is bad or mindgames themselves. (Or the scratches are buggy again) In a real scenario you cannot break chase vs a decent killer.
---
J have no idea who they are or how to do that. Would they really bother over one player losing an item to a bug? I haven't heard great things about the people with authority in this game.
---
you can...
---
if me trying to help you save face, ontop of offering to exchange messages with you on my own time is seen as provoking, then I dont know what to tell you, but I hope your mood improves quickly.
---
Adrenaline is a good perk for sure, but it's a both of a situational one.
---
I'm by no means a fantastic survivor but I like to run:
---
We'll make it
---
Leader
---
Urban Evasion
---
Balanced landing
---
We'll make it and leader result in people healing me fast, and me healing others fast. Urban is good for sneaking, and balanced landing helps even without the speed boost (although quite a few maps don't have high ground for it to be used)
---
The devs have literally said the hitbox issues (not counting huntress axes  and pigs knife being longer than it looks) are due to latency making it so the killer is actually closer to the survivor than they look. The only reason this is a recent issue is because when they still had pallet vaccumes the survivor was essentially teleported across the gap which compensated.  
---
As long as the killer is the host this issue is here to stay
---
I assume you're a Nea main as well? I couldn't live without my Urban Evasion
---
Actually I'm a p3 Tapp main. Before that I was a Dwight scum
---
cool and cute art. good job. can you or have drawn others?
---
Vash...now that's a name I reckon ain't been mentioned 'round these parts for many a moon. You the Stampeding type? Sort of a, Typhoon of Humanoid proportions?
---
would rather not think about a male spirit with thinly wrapped junk doing the helicopter as he runs at me.
---
It would happen even if I had -300 ping. 
---
Poor Dwight. Embodiment of wrong place, wrong time.
---
Howdy Fuckers how ya'll doing
---
I run we'll make it  &amp; its infuriating when people rush to hooks just to get them before me, effectively denying fast heals and points for me.
---
Like bitch, you were the last one on the hook and I unhooked and healed you. You KNOW that I have we'll make it. Srsly 
---
I run a farming build to get me some of those sweet BP, but I also bring perks and medkits to maximize my usefulness for the team while doing that and on low ranks I barely ever get to use it. I probably had less than 3 games last month where I could manage to get 4 stacks on WGLF
---
morse code across the map with flashlight blinks
---
Yes ranks are joke
---
Call me crazy, but those look like the eyes of a default Dwight. 
---
And all this time, we thought Nea was the killer survivor.
---
The nerf legion needs 
---
Hate when ppl complain about getting hit through pallets before learning pallet respect and lunge distance. Ur just bad 
---
You threw it too late then. 
---
That's true. But you should be reimbursed. It'd look really bad for them if they fucked a player out of an ultra rare item
---
de-ranking should get punished by if you leave a match you get an increasing time penalty to join the next match (first 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day... or something like this). This would slow down the process, any maybe they should implement the you can't de-rank from 15 for rank 10 and 5 aswell making it more painful to de-rank. I guess the dedicated servers can come in handy for these aswell :)
---
Is the game download completely done? 
---
Playstation has the "feature" that you can enter certain games after they're downloaded to a specific point (e.g. 20 out of 40 gb).
---
If you take a look at the downloadlist you may see that DBD is still downloading, but there may be two different gb stats. 
---
If there's a ready to start game/application, then you can enter the game, but you're limited to certain things such as (options, galleries or in your case the tutorial).
---
You can play the tutorial for now, but check if DBD is fully downloaded yet.
---
True, problem is people are naturally garbage at killers. I literally don't care if a 4 stack with all toolboxes or flash lights join. If I kill at least one or two I'm good. If people are scared of SWF they should stick to survivors.
---
Im an idiot dont listen to me. It was still downloading......
---
man, the killer queue times were broken for months and you could see like 2-3 comments about that a week at most. I don't know for how long the survivor queue times are broken, but I assume that from the beginning of the event and I've already read about that like 10 times during the last hour if not more, because I don't count replies to the main complaining comment.
---
Stop bitching, everything broken for survivor usually gets fixed within days, 1 or 2 weeks at most, because survivors make up about 80% of the playerbase and bring more people to the game through SWF. It's always been like that and it's ok. They will probably prolong the event too
---
Now it is.... I'm an idiot
---
Yeah...it finished downloading... I'm an idiot...
---
Imagine playing bloody serial killer and u get offended by croutching and clicking sound lmaoo. 
---
I know that‚Äôs right. But oh well, it needed to be said!  Why are they so damn frightened?  Top tier players don‚Äôt leave because of a 4 man.  They know how to wreck... sorry that you can‚Äôt hahhah 
---

k
---
Holy shit, i just started out with maya.
---
That must take quite some experience to make. Very good work op.
---
If you're on PC then train for nurse/hillbilly : they ain't gonna escape that easily after some training
---
If you're on console then absolutely avoid nurse and try clown/spirit/hillbilly (If you are good enough).
---
At the end of the day you should try every killer: i'm a hag main and I love the game play.
---
Just have fun and ignore toxic cunts. 
---
A good killer can combat a swf. I agree with the dodges. People wait like 15 mins for a lobby to be disconnected. üôÑ
---
100% Legion. Pick-up all Frank's Mixtaoe while leveling. Enjoy your salt harvest and DCs
---
Your end of season blood points are honestly good as they are.
---
If you're looking for something to make the survivor's life miserable, I would go for Doctor, Hag or Pig, in that order.
---
Although Hag and Pig can be really hated because of their jumpscare potential, if you want to get really meta, Doctor should be your choice. He has a ranged disable that if applied 3 times makes survs reveal themselves unless they waste time snapping out of it.
---
If you really want to go full toxic, look for a 3 gen Doc build.
---
Doctor into 3 gen strat. Build him up with unnerving, distressing, ruin and overcharge. they will hate u for it.
---
If you want to win through plainly skills, go for hillbilly or nurse. they are pretty solid
---
Yeah, one of their teammates was just sitting by the hatch doing nothing the whole time (a Feng with event clothes and a lantern, go figure) so I downed her and killed her and let the person who was actually doing stuff go, but instead they just ran around. And I know they knew where the hatch was cause they saw Feng camping there when she was down and led me to her. 
---
Buddy. I think you need to calm down cause you're the only one bitching and making this a killer vs survivor thing while at it.  It's not that serious. 
---
The values are debatable (5k Iri for a devotions seems a bit much considering it‚Äôs equal to a dlc character). 
---
But these are some really good ideas. 
---
dead hard, adrenaline, borrowed time, iron will
---
1) Frank
---
2) Susie
---
3) Julie
---
4) Joey or whatever the fuck the super edge lord is named 
---
5) Legion
---
Best way to stop all that BS? 
---
Screw the "unspoken rules" don't let them put rules on you that aren't actual rules. Play how you want and get your points. Then skip the match chat. 
---
Nothing pisses off a toxic and salty survivor more than not being able to vent at you after the match. 
---
To answer your question, if you want to annoy them with a DLC killer try out Doc, Pig, or Leatherface. Shit, I'd even recommend Freddy if you take the time to level him up when you can get his good addon combos. Slow the game down and don't give loopers the satisfaction of the chase. Most importantly have fun because sounds like you currently are not and that's not acceptable.
---
Amazing. I didn't even see him in the gate til he was in the way. Had to rewatch that bit, what a guy.
---
If killer is so ez and common sense why not just play killer? 
---
Also. Borrowed Time is a thing.
---
 Maybe they left because team is stupid and not doing gens.
---
i'm not playing 1 shot killers. 
---
To be fair, there are also a lot of skins that you can't purchase with shards.
---
If there arent 4 survivors and it doesnt say searching for survivors in bottom right corner its bugged 
---
I would argue that in a good player's hands the spirit is almost as op as nurse and stronger than billy. Spirit mind games may be hard but once you learn them there is not much a survivor can do. If you stop running when she phases chances are you will not make it far.
---
&gt;The devs have literally said the hitbox issues (not counting huntress axes and pigs knife being longer than it looks) are due to latency making it so the killer is actually closer to the survivor than they look. The only reason this is a recent issue is because when they still had pallet vaccumes the survivor was essentially teleported across the gap which compensated.
---
&gt;As long as the killer is the host this issue is here to stay
---
Do you have any source of said comments?
---
Because when the vacuum was removed, almost every dev streams that followed had devs saying that the issue was the animation and the stun time. When dropping a pallet, your character goes back a few steps and because of this, it connects your hitbox with the very ending of a killer's lunge.
---

The twitch VOD for stream #106 is no longer available but here is the youtube version: [Dead by Daylight | Livestream #106 - Mid-Chapter patch discussion
---
](https://youtu.be/dt7PNEOJxos?t=1758). If it doesn't start play at the correct time, just skip to 29 minutes mark. 
---
So I repeat, even when playing as killer with 0 ping, you can still easily see when you got a hit that wouldn't connect if the survivor kept running so this has nothing to do with latency. 
---
So this game is just meant to be played as killer is that what you're saying? And clearly you can't even read. I said the killer face camps at the beginning of the game. And borrowed time? You're that afraid of borrowed time? I can tell you're a trash killer.
---
When the pallet is unsafe, yes you run to another loop immediately without waiting for the killer to break it. 
---
As someone who doesnt play often, it kinda sucks having to use the same character because i would lose badly trying out a new character at my rank
---
... Wat. Troll? 
---
Yeah go away you're an idiot.
---
Okay, but hear me out. I know you don't want to hear this, but most Legions aren't even remotely good or coordinated. If you practice more I guarantee you can stomp them way more.
---
You see how that argument doesn't hold up without numbers supporting it? Mayhaps in your anecdotal experience, SWF groups are bad, but livestreamers like Monto and Tru3 tend to agree that against a SWF, you're only as strong as their weakest party member. And that's not how the game is supposed to be. The killer kills, so by default, if there's a power gap, it should go to them. But, as SWF currently stands, you're at their mercy in many situations. And this only gets more truthful the higher in rank you are. 
---
But, hey, if you think you know more about the balance of the game than people who literally play it for a living (or at minimum to assist with their income) then by all means, feel free to give me point-by-point information on why you're right in this situation.

"Survivors get a minimum of 20 points just for getting their gens done, while the killer has to bust his ass all match to get 10 points? That's balanced alright. No way could this be tipped into either side's favor, at all. Nope. Especially not considering the fact that literally every SWF group is playing for the points right now. How could that ever affect the killer getting points?" 
---
That's you. That's how stupid you sound. Stop replying before you make things worse for yourself.

I don't play leatherface
---
My favorite thing to do is down a toxic staller then drop them right at the exit. Basically, [this](https://giphy.com/gifs/season-6-the-simpsons-6x12-l2Je3fAJ02BkvLYEE).
---
Pallet looping is not existent against legion my dude. It‚Äôs why he/she breaks the game. 
---
Sounds like you are easily found all tge time. Try to be a little more immersed do others too can take killer aggro
---
I feel your pain against swf. Like I get it is easier to play 4 against one person doing everything themselves. Im not at red ranks at all but some swf are really sweaty. I just hate that they trash talk when you dont hook them and trash talk you when you kill them. Its very offputting to be able to play as a killer. Like you win, be happy please. I tried my best but you have 4 pairs of eyes and ears everywhere so you have a better advantage over me. Please stop talking shit or being toxic.
---
Big oof. That's why you don't t-bag to be a cunt. Cuz then you end up on reddit.

I skip the chat most matches anymore, at most I will say GG and instantly leave. Highly recommend. Usually people who are really rude/taunting in the chat are either kids or just really immature adults. It's just a game.
---
Most annoying killer to play against right now is Legion for me. I find them fun to play as killer, but as a survivor it can be really tedious constantly having to mend. 
---
I'd swap Lithe for Sprint burst and maybe swap dance with me with windows of opportunity so you know you can run elsewhere and prolong the chase
---
I‚Äôve actually been practicing hillbilly! I get a lot of shit when I play him, but I gotta say, the mental picture of poor Max standing in a corner crying while Claudette clicks her flashlight at his back is so sad/funny I can‚Äôt even be mad.
---
Nurse‚Äôs fatigue animation straight up gives me motion sickness for some reason, so that‚Äôs right out. 
---
Easy, especially on console
---
I say get Freddy, I used to think he was lame but I've given him a chance and I love it
---
No no no, pls keep respecting pallets
---
When I play killer, I can still get ridiculous hits even though I‚Äôm the host. 
---
I had a game on PS4 a few days ago where a Freddy literally walked past other survivors to come for me, hooked me 3 times before he hit anyone else, I spectated afterwards and he let them do the gens and escape...
---
why do people even do that? and what are the chances are that he knew/was working with them?
---
A pink Ace is probably the easiest survivor to find, but for some reason I just always seem to find Ace before anyone else if there is one. 
---
The title doesn't clarify which daylight, so a month from now's daylight is totally acceptable. 
---
Waiting for bearded david
---
Yeah I rly want my bloody sunglasses Kate
---
Trapping a place they know Survivors are going to go to, such a dick move right?
---
This should be a thing. Especially devotion rewards.
---
Well, it is console. But then again, it depends are the rank 1's boosted or good. And then there is how much freddy you play and all that.
---
Aww thanks man
---
Self care (obvious)
---
Lithe or Balanced Landing (sprint burst is useless since you need to run often, anyway)
---
Alert (I am easily scared)
---
and Detective's Hunch (because I assume everyone runs NOED and make a beeline for any and all totems). If I use a map, I'll replace this with Prove Thyself (formerly Leader).
---
When you thought The Shape was the only killer in the match;
---
Says it in the post itself, only looping
---
And that's why I posted this, I don't know either
---
7 months.
---
I‚Äôm getting behind it it would make the game more fun 
---
What is this being messaged on? 
---
I've never had frames drop that low on my end 
---
I had a game as killer yesterday where three players went AFK. I let the last survivor farm in the 1 vs 1 we ended up in.
---
But for 3 vs 1? Fair game I say.
---

---
Oooh, I know it does‚ò∫ I was double checking, but aye have fun getting tunneled and camped. Obviously something you are doing is attracting the killer if you got tunneled 23 times in a row like you said.
---
I love having to deal with 4 decked out meta survivors as trapper with lv1-2 perks and brown addons
---
Survivors only need to max out one character once they get teachables (and can keep their items and addons between games), each killer needs difrent perks and all killers need a constant supply of addons
---
Great work. Please do submit it to the Forums as well, we really need the Devs to speak up about a reward system and get something similar implemented.
---
I hope this thread is a joke
---
The reason he can hit you is cuz of no dedicated servers
---
I'll try to record a few games next time I go online
---
Generally I queue up with my friends who are lower ranks due to lower queue times and also I get to play with my friends. Solo queuing in red ranks is suicide to brain cells.
---
feng min just a lil bit
---
Just over PlayStation chat
---
Imagine being correct but survivors don‚Äôt want to admit you‚Äôre right so you get downvoted into oblivion so they can protect their egos 
---
Unfortunately not, this time it was Hillbilly! 
---
https://youtu.be/9U_k7BAYc2Y
---
No sorry
---
Thank you and yes I'm on console I keep refusing to play because I left Rainbbow 6 because of team killing, Most issue I have is not being helped or embarrassing myself
---
More like gaming in a nutshell
---
The grind needs to be changed it's just way too much, your suggestions would help a ton.
---
Oh it‚Äôs console... ewww
---
I want to know the kind of nurses you're facing, the ones who know what they're doing would have 1-2 hooks before you have even a single Gen done, throw in some slugging and juggling and I don't see how you could consistently beat r1 nurse mains (emphasis on mains) 
---
I 4% off the hook, run away, hide. Claud found me, wanted to heal me.  *Claud fails skillcheck* killer instantly comes to us. *me ded*
---
Run ds with an insta heal if they wanna tunnel you atleast make it hell for them too
---
My frames are guaranteed to drop to 10 or less when I turn swing at the same time as well as perform break actions. 
---
actually impossible to hide without Iron Will if the killer isn't fucking terrible
---
And whenever he tries to play another killer he will get back to getting roasted because you don't learn how to play the game while playing legion, he is an autopilot.
---
the little smile picture makes it even better
---
Am I the only one or does that look broken
---
IIRC, they did actually help another company make a dbd clone. Let me find it, hold on. 
---
‰Ωï
---
At this point I don‚Äôt think they are recognising this ridiculous hit box as a problem. Dedicated servers won‚Äôt do anything either I bet
---
Cornblindness is already strong enough, it doesn't need a dang buff
---
Great idea but to generous you'd be taking away the grind aspect to much and this game is all about the grind I think it would be better to find a middle ground that would help you climb the ladder easier but still require you to climb it and not just allow you to launch yourself to the top
---
Downloading now.
---
They only get that from me if they either made me drop survivor or juked me more than twice
---
Just take your time, learn how to play killer and don't care about the 75 iq endgame chat.
---
If you can't for some reason there is a way to hide that chat entirely.
---
Found it, Indentity V. 
---
Downloading now. Someone else also suggested it. Thanks!
---
Did you know? They made a movie in 2018 about the shape from DBD. Pretty cool.
---
Here is a small rework:
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/an0aok/i_have_read_all_of_your_comments_regarding_my/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
I can‚Äôt even be bothered to make it that high id rather play league, somehow less toxic and more enjoyable than dbd. 
---
Oh damn shw still got SOME meat on dem bones~~
---
I feel attacked
---
Uhh she doesnt really look like feng 
---
I wouldn't really care about the framerate if it wasn't so important in tracking and swinging for Survivors doing donuts around me as I'm skipping around like a scratched up CD
---
i don't like other games so i don't really have a choice D:
---
Like op said, it‚Äôs fair enough, I‚Äôm not complaining. But don‚Äôt try and suggest changing someone‚Äôs play style just because you suck and can‚Äôt catch the survivor. 
---
&gt; then how the fuck are we supposed to loop? 
---
Drop it early, force killers to break the pallet. Not that hard.
---
Hm, interesting, the only other character I run is pink Dwight. RIP
---
I feel like it's gotten worse lately!  
---
Have to give you the upvote for the flair
---
Oh I will kill you. I hated that fucker more than Ace. Sorry not sorry. 
---
My max waittime as survivor has been like a minute when playing solo, 2 minutes when playing swf. Doesn't mean it's not an issue, just that we luckily haven't experienced the insane waittimes others are reporting.
---
No worries. I agree, if you get gen rushed to oblivion and finally catch the survivor I understand the facecamping. Like I said it‚Äôs just a game at the end of the day. 
---
Why can't the game look like that?
---
Jesus I am scared for life. 
---
The problem was that it looked like she made it through but really she didn't. That was a ping problem.
---
Looks solid, I would enjoy this in the game.
---
Lol ill reply to who i want thanks. In my view its not that imbalanced, gens dont get powered in plenty of games the vassel escape gives a lot of points but again its a lot harder to escape than destroy a vassel
---
Chest.
---
Yeah, I'm also keeping track of all perks used in the game. Only perk that is above NOED is Barbecue &amp; Chili. And thats a perk most people use because of the bloodpoints
---
Here's what I do to avoid red ranks while promoting a fun gamestyle, go for the 29,600 bp games, only 2 hook survivors and focus more on bp than kills. It slows down ranking by making sure you don't double pip and spreads a load of bloodpoints without the tedium of farming. 
---
&gt; I've got 700 hours
---
Lmao.
---
Freddys hitbox is dumb because he has a normal lunge but smaller weapon
---
As far as I know you don‚Äôt get any refund whatsoever
---
What is the "best" perk is all about preference and will depend on your playstyle. I personally almost never make a build without including Iron Will. It's like my holy grail perk but not everyone likes it.
---
If you tend to go for saves then I would keep We'll make it, but if you're not *that* alturistic I would've put on Lightweight instead.
---
yes, with the changes to Prove Thyself the genrush after changing the old bnp is an actual thing now. cause in-between there was no such thing. as in it was just people doing gens to escape. now the progression is very fast again. 
---
I've escaped with quite a few now after not rescuing my friends. üòé I may make a small batch of kits, including a small desktop model with base and support arm.
---
NANI?!?!
---
RIP friends, but hello to coins. üí±üí±üí±
---
Git out üòé
---
borrowed time.
---
If this happens, it would end a bit with people deppiping and decrease the grind. I love it.
---
Even if you hit esc before you open steam? Good to know though, that is an... interesting oversight.
---
Are you that 1 survivor that waits at the shack pallet?
---
Hey can I have a opinion on this forum? :rage:
---
You can see that she only saw the entity blocking the exist at the last second and was like
---
"Well fuck this is my life now"
---
Yeah, this were exactly my thoughts!
---
lmao i use moris for the fun of it. 
---
The idea of stopping others from getting points never really crossed my mind.
---
Well yeah, but chances are he was just so annoyed by this survivor that he really wanted him to die, not caring about the other ones since they didn't outplay him for so long.
---
As a frequent user of Spirit fury and Enduring, I‚Äôm all too happy to eat pallets :)
---
&gt;2. "DS" Decisive as exhausted perk is another BS...90% of time u will use decisive after losing chase in which u probably used sprint/dead hard/BL/Lithe...
---
Thats the whole point. You don't equip balanced landing if you already have sprint burst, Decisive Strike should be in the same category. If you want to use it, don't use other exhaustion perks
---
&gt;3. "ADRENALINE" nah
---
Why? This is such a small change that would give Freddy a little bit of extra strength. This change would only apply in 1 situation: the last generator gets fixed while you are playing against a freddy and you are injured and asleep. In all other scenarios, this would stay the same
---
&gt;5. "STREETWISE"...like rushing gens is not enough today.
---
It's not like it increases your speed. It just allows you to use your items a little longer
---
&gt;6. "Iron will" is OP enough now..no need to change
---
Yeah, this might be a bad idea
---
&gt;8. "Fire up" so Brutal strength ,Bamboozle wouldnt be needed anymore.
---
Fire Up would only be on the power of brutal strength at 4 gens complete and Bamboozle is good because it blocks windows. Fire Up would give a better vault speed than bamboozle at the end, but I still think it's a good change since this only comes into play at end game
---
I still think 750k bloodpoints once a month is a bit too high, that's more than spending 8k shards on the shrine in a week just for hitting rank 1 which most people know isn't too difficult.
---
Ah always love meal of those bitter-sweet survivor tears :D
---
You're completely right. So for the next update, everytime billy or leatherface chainsaw someone they instantly die since a flimsy survivor would never survive that.
---
If the survivor is waiting at the gate it'1 of 2 things
---
He's a hero and wants everyone to escape and isn't afraid of killing himself at the end of the match to save someone else
---
Or
---
He's just waiting the killer to come near and tea bag the shit outta him
---
We all know it's always the second option
---
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre a troll or just dumb
---
Then you haven't played killer enough. I get those bullshit hits all the time as killer, wondering how bad it would've looked on the survivor's side.
---
Weird logic you have there dude. 
---
- Facecamping is a valid strat, but looping for 4 gens is 'abusing the mechanics that the devs gave us'? Sure, mate. Sure.
---
- As much as you're right with the 'go for hurt man no stupid' part, being chased for 4 gens and not evading ain't stupid. Maybe they have fun in kiting the hunter, maybe they just wanna be chased themselves instead of having someone downed in 10 seconds. It's their choice. Plus, To successfully evade the hunter, you'll prob have to have to 2000IQ the hunter and that ain't easy.
---
- We all agree on survivors wanting hunters to win all the time is stupid, and with the same logic, i think we could all agree that hunters wanting survivors to die for you when they are strugging is just as stupid too.
---
&gt;you can also choose to go down after 2 gens seeing that killer is struggling. only a piece of shit killer will face camp you after this move. 
---
If you don't wanna get facecamped, you can always believe in the killer's morality and troll your teammates instead! Reeeeeeal smart. Clap clap.
---
I mean, i understand, you main killers and are therefore killer-biased. But in terms of right and wrong, you're wrong big-time.
---
And you're not really bright, aren't you? You can't tell satire apart from salt.
---
Even legion players know he's bullshit so they walk instead of running to balance out
---
Hmmmm yes,  research..... 
---
I stopped playing the game months ago (played once Legion was released) because the lack of this. I don't get the point of keep playing when you don't have, asides of the bloodweb, nothing more to do.
---
Yeah to be honest my long-paced replies are one of the most despised things here on this sub. Many people are either like "TL/DR" and give completely unreasonable replies, or simply lack the experience by having very...interesting opinions.
---
I wouldn't even mind them focusing on QoL-Updates till 2020, beginning with the Server-updated. Summer 2019 until the next winter should actually be enough to consider and push some certain changes through.
---
But I must definetly admit that they're doing better than they've ever been. I just hope they don't get corrupted like Blizzard and Bethesda did, still makes me sad to be honest. I just hope that BHVR keeps following the tracks they're doing right now, if so, they'll definetly do a pretty good job.
---
It might sound weird but my biggest worries don't reffer to the "stronger" Survivor-items being more frequent but some of the absurd strong Killer add-ons we have. Just imagine perma-EW3 Michaels, Bloody Coil + Iridiscent Stone Trapper, Iridiscent Head Huntress' , Calm + Order "Carter's Notes" Doctors, even more tuning-guide Billies (still dunno why it's green instead of purple tbh), 4 Blink Nurses, even cheesier Freddies...
---
I don't know if "challenging" is the term I personally would choose to be honest. Sure, it's not wrong. But I also think that especially Killers benefit from certain add-ons in an absurd manner. When those Killers are actually also experienced and aware of their gameplay, no flashlight, toolbox or med-kit in the world would save lots of Survivor, leading to frustration for lots of Survivors.
---
However I must say this could also be less of a thing with a more expanded match-making. I think everyone can agree that Rank 1 shouldn't be the "very ceiling of skill" in the game. Rank 1 yields gods but also lots of morons. That's like LoL or CSGO Elo not going beyond Gold. Which's obviously ridiculous.
---
A well-made MMR system and a expanded rank-system would make a much more frequent bloodpoint-gain definetly less of a problem I suppose. But I still also think we should have an unranked queue once we actually hit enough player-numbers to justify that.
---
And I wasn't simply talking about "make all the items twice as expensive reee" but simply something like -&gt; Green = 6k , Purple = 8k and ..Red? = 10k. I'm definetly for people leveling up faster but this also means they can potentially hoard more items/add-ons. Giving them the choice to enhance their gameplay at the cost of a slightly reduced leveling speed is actually not that unreasonable I think. I just want to evade the possibillity of people putting their ranked or devotion rewards into their mains and hoarding even more than necessary thanks to a more frequent bloodpoint gain.
---
Same bud, thanks for the detailed reply &lt;3
---
she did it back and forth a million times XD
---
This is absolutely amazing. I'd have this on my wall on a canvass. Great work mate. 
---
See, that's not good either, it's how all the hate spreads.
---
Killers camp / tunnel - &gt; survivors play in 4man SwF groups -&gt; killers run NOED -&gt; survivors run DS -&gt; killers find new ways to BM (hitting on hook) -&gt; survivors find new ways to BM (flashlight clicking) -&gt; killers/survivors cry on social media -&gt; survivors/killers tell them how OP their side is and that they should kill themselves -&gt; people become more toxic -&gt; people search online for ways to be more toxic -&gt; exploit
---
It's a really shitty chain, I don't want that
---
No? no0b3 is a good player at the game who doesnt promote toxicity and exploits anymore. And his streams are fit for all ages unlike ochido who aimed for 5 year olds 
---
Oh okey. 
---
Not all will though, and they're pretty sad if they do. I hate Legion's gameplay, though I do like their appearance and lore, but that hatred of playing against them doesn't blind me to the wonderful job HoneyBunny did here and upvoted.
---
Thank you! Maybe one day.. i really liked how she turned out, so i have her framed on top of my bed so she can protect me :3 
---
Well there‚Äôs nothing else you can do. Killers will never stop tunnelling it‚Äôs a play style I‚Äôve learnt to accept but if they wanna play like that Im not gonna sit here and just play nice lol
---
Territorial Imperative... 
---
That perk is the reason I don't go into the basement unless I'm saving someone or getting hooked 
---
I, as a survivor main but plays killer a fair bit as well, would not deliberately go down 2 gens in to avoid the possibility of a facecamp. You confuse survivors ability to run a killer around for 5 gens as a ‚Äòstrategy‚Äô instead of what it is, their goal in the game. 
---
Facecamping, while annoying is a strategy, running away from the killer is the survivors goal. This paired with the fact that hiding from the killer is almost impossible unless the killer stuffs himself up or the survivor makes some sort of god play, especially if they are injured.
---
In conclusion. Running around for 5 gens = survivor goal if killer keeps chasing, facecamping/tunneling = strategy
---
I mean, in a chase, I nearly always get though 4 or all 5 gens.
---
Outside a chase, I pose little threat, as I prefer fooling around or simply searching chests (before eventually just getting on a generator anyway, because I have to).
---
This means that it's actually bad for a killer to tunnel me to death before everyone else. Now, you might tell me that the killer might not know this, but to that I say: in all 23 of those games, only once was I discovered while repairing a generator
---
+ there has to be SOMETHING. There are 4 survivors in each lobby, after all
---
Maybe some general killer buffs would be nice, like making all of them 115% movement speed, but leave nurse unchanged. 
---
Wow, that's so sad. I thought that you got something like every other game does. Oh well.
---
You still get a decent amount of bloodpoints per game, so I guess that's a good thing...?
---
Thanks for the welcome btw. I will try hard to be a good player.
---
Noob3 is pretty self aware about his toxicity, he still does it though because that‚Äôs his claim to fame I believe
---
ping
---
I'm not even saying they can't tunnel. My point is, once again, that it was specifically ME 23 times IN A ROW. 
---
Don't take this the wrong way, I fully understand what you're trying to tell me
---
I do admit I was being a bit pedantic there.
---
However, your point is still kind of weak, as indicated by you trying to inflate what you have to say by spending not one, but two paragraphs insulting me c:
---
Breaking LOS does nothing in this game, because of scratch marks and any 'fast' actions coming with nice n loud sound cues; this means that, unless the killer falls asleep while chasing ya, they have at least one option to stay hot on your heels. Unless you want to turn a corner and crouch; better hope the killer's blind ;). On top of that, perks that make you better at hiding are far less effective than the ones that aid you in chases.
---
People should understand that the direction the game leans towards is **not** a conventional horror experience. Its more of a game of tag. 
---
I play on console. The hatch was near a window. Instead of jumping into the hatch (pressing R1) I slow vaulted through the window instead. Killer hit me, he had NOED ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

---
BP and shard amount has to be hard nerfed (like a third of what you're proposing at best)
---
Still would be great
---
Me after getting fucked over by bad fps etc on console: fuck this game 
---
Also me: *joins a lobby*
---
Thought it was Amanda for a second lol
---
There are perks in game that already increase movement speed, if them being above 110% movement speed would be an issue we would already know. It is so damn easy to loop some killers, survivors have every advantage. If a 5% movement speed change breaks the game, I dunno what to say. Game seems fundamentally broke. 
---
"I run BBQ for points!" XD
---
That's the thing, probably. If you loop them for 4/5 gens they just get tilted that they couldn't catch you, and will do absolutely everything to catch you and kill you.
---
And if they catch you off-guard for an easy first hit everytime while you're doing Ace stuff in the chests, that's just a really attractive offer to most of these tunneling killers.
---
Is it smart? Nope. Is tunneling smart in the first place? Almost never. They still do it though, either for those reasons, or for no reason at all. Maybe they just don't like you or your name or something?
---
[That's why there is a v2](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/an0aok/i_have_read_all_of_your_comments_regarding_my/) at least for the shard nerf
---
Yeah. Gotta Love me some fast as fuck huntress
---
23 times in a row is hella unlucky lol and some salty killers take offence to getting looped for long for some reason also what rank were you at?
---
r/woooosh
---
*P3 Claudette sweats nervously*
---
Gotta love a killer that has constant map assets blocking their ability while having to waste time reloading at lockers eh?
---

You have 0 experience in Game balance.. so discussion is over.
---
I'm pretty sure neither console existed at the time
---
It's rank 7 and I have 400 hours, this rarely happens. I can expect this behavior from rank 20s not rank 7s
---
I'm confused Grind Rewards Old isn't even correct, you don't get 3 perk choices at level 50.
---
Rank 1 survivors are worse than rank 20 survivors lmao 
---
Do any of us? Seems that is the devs job, and they seem rather poor at it. When survivors have SWF, Decisive strike, tools at the beginning of the game, self healing that negates the need of a valuable item, and many other other things that curve the game in their favor, the issue runs much deeper than 5% movement speed breaking the game. 
---
It's my previous concept. After some feedback from Reddit I changed it a bit
---
The shrine rewards for bp is undervalued 150k for 8k shards is not a good deal. 
---
Territorial Imperative you can at least have the ignorant bliss that you might be safe. With Rancor, instead you'll have the curse of seeing how close the killer is, and how the steadily increasing terror radius means you're trapped in the basement and you're about to get the hook.
---
Still want to see them.
---
You can expect nothing, because you don't seem to realize that they didn't know what you knew. Use Kindred if it bothers you that much. --&gt; info on where the others are and social pressure will likely do the trick.
---
Im a killer main on console and my best tip to avoid this is to be more patient. If you see him go towards you do not swing, wait a couple of seconds, make sure he is in plain sight and then hit. 
---
I dont think you should be able to buy bloodpoint boosters, but judging from the upvotes people think you should?  What's wrong with you guys.  You guys cry about "Greed" all the time but think pay 2 win mechanics added would be a good thing?!  
---
On that note, this game sells its cosmetics cheap as hell AND 75% of them can be bought with iridescent.  So I dont see where all this whining comes from, this game has benefited so much from the cosmetics, people dont even play the characters that cant get them because their too ugly.  Its frustrating coming from PoE where you will pay around 120$ for a cosmetic set.
---
Hag and Trapper only share the fact that they have traps. Hag has 110% because seh can teleport.

One time, this guy burnt an offering so all of us will spawn together ‚Äî little did he know that one of us had object of obsession. We were playing against a really good billy! He downed us within one second. Two disconnected and my friend and I died in the hook. The game lasted about, I shit you not, 1 min. #truestory 
---
Is that a motherloving *dbd* reference?
---
&gt;Imagine being upset that you got -1 internet points, and you continue getting -1 internet points because you continue to cry that someone gave you -1 imaginary internet points.
---
Seriously dude it's fucking Reddit Karma. Keep crying that someone (not even necessarily me, though you can be damn well sure I downvoted the crap out of your posts after you threw a temper tantrum) clicked a button to make some arbitrary number go down.
---
Female Frank and Male Julie pls /s
---
Self care, urban evasion, sprint burst, and I switch up the last perk a lot.. right now I‚Äôm using iron will and it works really well with urban evasion after I break line of sight with the killer!

Spooky. 
---
Hence why a Firecracker is slightly better but it still feels pretty bad.
---
Clown may not damage but he slows people down a whopping 15% which is massive because, unless a survivor has a perk that boosts speed, he is 30% faster than you for a solid bit. Hag may teleport but her traps do no damage and you can merely crouch over them, urban evasion is super popular and is a main reason why I would never want to play hag. Trappers traps snag you, hold you in place, and if placed properly demand you interact with them. 
---
VHS porn
---
I get insta queues when playing as survivor and a 5-10 minute wait to be a killer. Strange.
---
Fun fact: games can be shit and fun at the same time. 
---
Like cheap horror movies being shit but also fun to watch (some of them) 
---
the only thing I said is if the stun hitboxes are broken ( I didn't experience it at all while playing both sides, but I'm gonna take your word for it here) then you shouldn't rely on bugged stun and just drop it early, because what you said was basically 'stuns are broken so I stun instead of looping' which didn't make sense. 
---
However if you drop pallet early I'm still gonna love it, no matter if you stunned me or dropped it in front of me. You should always try to loop before dropping it, both standing behind the pallet waiting for killer to catch up to stun him and dropping it in advance when killer isn't right behind you are wrong. Or if you have enough distance between you and him to lose the chase or get to another pallet, just run through without touching it.
---
My eyes!
---
I don't think slightly smaller skill checks outweigh doing a gen ~30% faster. Brown Medkits have barely enough charges for a single self heal. If the Killer has any sort of healing slowdown (such as Sloppy Butcher which basically every Killer has now) then a Brown Medkit is pretty much worthless.
---
That's the change I want the most personally. The perk grind is absolutely horrible at low levels and at high levels. It's very punishing to new players and it would just be nice to at least have an extra perk chance to counter some of the bad rng.
---
I don't know which one cracked me up more - Mcote on the cursed tape or the "She's showing you the horses?" part. Great stuff. I subscribed. 
---
Also Hillbilly would have exhausion
---
yup definitely need this. I never actively bothered trying to stay in a high rank because there was no incentive. literally just play and don't look at pips/depips.
---
Wasn‚Äôt a solid 360 then, easy as that.
---
Or one in a useless position. 
---
Steam reviews in a nutshell.
---
It‚Äôs a circle jerk for him so you won‚Äôt get far.
---
I like this variant better, but I think both potentionally work if you're leaving the values as X/Y instead of specific numbers.  It would be neat to get X iridescent from every bloodweb you fill past 50, but I'm not sure what number would fit correctly there though, the original numbers you gave were kinda insane.
---
Rank 1 spirit actually, visual bug.
---
Behaviour wants to know your location
---
get outplayed.
---
My initial thoughts for that were that after you finished your main character on P3 you can afford a cosmetic item. However, that doesn't make any sense since the purpose of prestiging already is to get new cosmetics.
---
In general BHVR won't give shards that easily
---
I... wish I hadn't seen that up close. 
---
Is it way too much though?  It is if you are trying to buy the dlcs characters with iridescent, but the perk grind takes like 80 hours as a NEW player to get 4 survivors to 40, the another 80 for killer.  That's assuming you're not getting boosted by events as well.  
---
My hb still has like 22

Chuckles in resilience and iron will..

Howwwdyyyy!

I know that whenever I can I hook survivors within LOS of one of these vessels just so they can watch me break it.

Im rank 1 dude.But that doesnt matter 1 bit.You can go watch killer mains say the same thing as me.Take scott jund for example.Zubat as well.They must be rank 20's as well?
---
smite
---
Rewards are way to high. And blood web should stay the same. It doesn't take that long to achieve all the good perks in killers or survivors. What's the point if there's no grind? There's not a lot else to achieve in the game as it is. At least with the grind you have some progress to aim for. 
---
Or have my luck:
---
I have Sole Survivor, Tenacity, Unbreakable and Self Care. I have always refused to use Decisive Strike, but this build revolves around the killer thinking I have decisive strike and slugging me.
---
Anyways, played against a leatherface. They really seemed to want me because they kept chasing me at the start. I went down pretty early and got hooked. Insta facecamp. It's kind of sad really, all gens got completed while I was on the hook and I depipped. At least my team had an easy game (untill they got hit by NOED).
---
What can I say, we really got outplayed there
---
If you want pure salt the top two killers to choose from are Legion or Doctor. Choose Legion if you want more kills, or Doctor if you want more BP.
---
My good sir, you do know I am talking about on PS4, right?
---
I know, its always pretty interesting when a rank 3 Surv plays against a rank 12 Killer
---
i like the bloodweb idea and love the devotion rewards but i dont know about 750k for rank 1 seems like a bit much.
---
Got left behind by a fully healthy Jake against a Freddy without noed right in front of the gates
---
The best kind
---
Who the hell uses tier 1 ruin
---
I always wondered what it would be like if i had friends to play with.
---
Worse than ochido 
---
This shit happens to me every now and again. Most recently being yesterday with a key. I feel your pain.
---
Clown because he has no downside. ‚ÄúBut he has no map pressure‚Äù yeah okay neither do 90% of killers. He self reloads, has a THICC 115% movement speed, slows down survivors by 15%, and has anti chase perks that make it extremely difficult to loop him. He may not be OP, but what he is is reliable. Chuck your bottles and tear em down. 
---
Sorry for your loss
---
Implying literally anything in this game takes that much skill lmfao. Lets not pretend this game is EVER gonna be competitive...Coming from an FPS games to this is quite funny. You don't even have to aim precisely as killer because hitboxes are huge. Survivor is just about remembering routes /prioritization and so is killer. 
---
I do, personally. Slam the same point boost on any other perk and I‚Äôm running that instead. Even if it was Surveillance. 
---
Thought I might mention, me getting tunneled or camped doesn't NECESSARILY mean I died.
---
Like, a 3man SwF group got me off the hook against a camper, because I kept the killer busy all game and they thought I deserve it. I'm telling you this, because the killer had the balls to call Borrowed Time a crutch perk.
---
I've missed pretty obvious chainsaws as the Hillbilly, I guess I gave a good laugh to some dudes
---
Its a hit or miss in my experience. The other day I looped the killer for 3 mins or more (because I cleansed ruin), meanwhile my teammates let a person die on his first hook, while I was looping the other side of the map purposely. When the killer finally catches me I see both of them crouching on the edge of my side of the map... like wtf have you been doing. There s alot of survivors that are actually not good at the game in red ranks. Even worse when its down to you and another survivor, you can be sure he is hopping lockers... just play the game and move on, you dont lose any progress -.-
---
Wooooosh
---
Looks really good! Well done :)
---
"Spider clown, spider clown.
---
  Does whatever a spider clown does."
---
This event has made that so much worse.  People are just grabbing lanterns and hiding.  Soaking up the 500bp every 30 seconds.  Terrible event.  That will hopefully go away soon.
---
Ppl just love to hate 
---
&gt; Anyways, played against a leatherface.
---
But which survivor were you playing? You can easily get tunneled+facecamped just for playing a survivor with a mask
---
Damn nature, you scary!
---
Graphics error. They were modeled after hooks so here the graphic still blends in.
---
The number of hooks in the map is unaffected by this
---
It would be your own fault though for buying something you already own. You'd be 'scamming' yourself.
---
Imagine taking an opinion texted on a screen some oc that needs to be called out.
---
Lets hope not, these ideas are great!
---
The see-through walls are the worst thing in the game tbh. 
---
3 seconds is a bit much, it would be a better idea to just bring the vacuum back 
---
I like the mystery of never seeing Sally‚Äòs true face. 
---
Fr my man.
---
i used it, along with haunted grounds. Works everytime, they still try to search for ruin 1 and cleansed a haunted ground. now i have ruin 3 and is just better.
---
I know your pain, the amount of times my boyfriend has sandbagged me in this game is innumerable.
---
His favourite trick is to pull me off the hook near the killer and rely on borrowed time or the killer going after him... I've died so many times because he farmed me like this. 
---
Hearing his 'Well, shit' every time makes up for it though, doesn't mean I don't tease him about it
---
JuSt DC foR nEg pIps anD Better pOiNTS In THe Next gAME lOL
---
The worst part is, its not even worth it :/ the bonus BP are meh and for some reason they forget we are still actually trying to play the game and get out. Please do a fucking gen -.- not too mention 9/10 they end up getting caught looking for the hatch and die with like 5k points and no event points lol
---
I think there‚Äòs an issue with hitboxes staying on the window frame instead of moving with the character.
---
Something dedicated servers can‚Äòt fix btw. 
---
My boyfriend didn't even say "oh, shit" out loud. I was met with complete silence as I saw his escape icon pop up. I was like, "did you just leave me?!" and all I hear is "......I didn't mean to"
---
That's a *YOU* problem, buddy.
---
No, I love him very much so I'll never leave him.
---
Except to die. I got my sandbags, and my stacks, and escaped with a vessel.
---
A good killer not every killer.
---
Any plans of doing Susie? Or the other two? Very good as always :)!
---
\-rep, selfish survivor
---
I empathize because I've been there. I get freshly hooked in the basement with my girl and eventually she's about 1% meter away from death so I attempt to unhook myself. Miraculously, it works, and I'm apparently so elated by this divine yeet my brain shuts off for a split second. I start to shamble towards the stairs out of habit. Then my "oh I fucked up" internal alarm sounds as I instinctively whip around to look at my former hook sidekick floating away into space as she goes "uhhh hello?"
---
We'll never know if I would've made it in time even if I had tried, it was that close. I made it out of the basement with a straight shot to the exit gate, to add insult to injury.
---
My only excuse is I was pretty new to the game at the time, but I'll still never live it down as one of my greatest DBD failures. Legitimate temporary brain death. She claims she forgives me but you must know more than anyone how much it stings regardless. 
---
I'm honestly just happy I had the chance to confess to this sin, I feel like a great weight has been lifted.
---
Moris shouldn't even be in the game.
---
A good move is ask where they are at the start of the next match, slam a pallet or jump through a window a few times, and flee 
---
At least you feel guilty. My boyfriend, who has beeb playing for years, knows he's the best so all he could do was laugh. :( 
---
Yes it is.
---
People refer to it like it's the Killer version of Sprint Burst or Dead Hard (as in, a really powerful perk), when it is actually closer to Self Care; a fairly weak necessity.
---
It's treason then!
---
I meant, it depends on the killer your playing, other than your overall skill at playing killer. Being a good nurse is quite different to be playing a skilled freddy or bubba against a swf right?
---
It‚Äôs worse for killer. I play both all the time and notice it way more as killer. Most lag I face as survivor is the killers internet 
---
This game was released before ps4 pro was a thing lol
---
He's done that so many times accidentally. He smashes buttons as he runs for no reason, so I can't tell you the amount of times I'm on a gen, he runs up, slams a pallet, pauses, goes "ohp..." and runs away
---
I want to see Hag popping out of the bowl when you drop your pants in hopes of boarding the porcelain throne and taking a gigantic monch out of your tush for an instadown. 
---
In fact, I want toilet-themed moris for every killer including liscensed ones.
---
And have green keys be worth more since they literally see zero use!!! Please god
---
Why not heal against him? Just cuz his power can't down you?
---
The hex prevents survivors from seeing anything in regards to auras. So it wouldn‚Äôt really balanced if it wasn‚Äôt a hex. So you can‚Äôt see dying survivors or where they are hooked. So having that as a permanent thing would be stupid. So the way to counter it is to destroy the totem. The ONLY way it couldn‚Äôt be a totem would be to make it have a timer on the effect, and then it really isn‚Äôt that good.
---
r/lostredditors
---
but also
---
HELLO THERE
---
Excuse you?
---
PGTW is the best gen-defence perk in the game. 80 seconds-worth of regression in an instant. Overcharge is unreliable, but does 10% (or 32 seconds-worth of) regression each time.
---
Other gen-defence perks include: Surveillance, Discordance, Thanatophobia and Dying Light.
---
To see how powerful a gen-defence build can be, go check out Monto's videos on the subject.
---
Of course you don't
---
See, Bamboozle is overrated. Most Survivors don't know to abuse the god-windows, and even then, most are supported by a pallet.
---
Hag eating a David king's ass until he dies that is GENIUS 
---
Yeah I always wished they‚Äôd let us choose which item of clothing to prestige, at least out of the original clothing options. I have half my characters to P3 and I only really use the head cosmetic on each but some of them are just ugly
---
They get curious
---
This is all wrong. This is fair and balanced, so if you want the devs to add it, you need to make sure that it‚Äôs so fucking broken it‚Äôs unbelievable!
---
Cuz there is nothing else to play
---
Leatherface. Run insidious, noed, iron grasp, and agitation. Trust me you‚Äôll get lots of salt while using this build to basement camp. If you don‚Äôt want to do that LF is still a really good killer to run.
---
I have a really cheap $600 PC from 2016 that runs it perfectly. I am trying to upgrade to around $1200 but I am happy for the most part. I only really play Rainbow and DBD anyways
---
Good killer,  not every killer. And, a coordinated group can fall apart easily if a killer has good perks and applies pressure. 
---
Omg, is it weird now that I want to draw princess versions of all the survivors? Princess Meg, Princess Claudette, Princess Dwight...
---
About half of this was on Twitch, half was during lobby wait times, yes! (Also, while hanging on the hook.)
---
Thank you so much!
---
I once got cocky at the exit gate waiting for the last person to escape. Billy got me and I was the only person to die. I learned my lesson that day
---
Aww, I'm glad you like it! Almost every time I post something for another survivor, someone asks why there's no Feng Min, so I thought this would be a nice time to draw her.
---
Thank you!
---
I really appreciate that, thank you!
---
Aww, Baadog, you're so sweet. Thank you so much. :3
---
It already does override all survivor aura reading perks, doesn‚Äôt it? Are you not aware of this and suggest that this is how it should be or are you saying that it shouldn‚Äôt be a hex totem?
---
But she's very refined, so she won't teabag you at the exit gate. ...Or will she?
---
Thank yooooouuuuuuu!!!!!!
---
Can the rank for the best reward be from rank 2 to rank 1? Some people will inevitably depip and drop them down. I feel like if there was two ranks for the best reward then there's time to bounce back and it's less stressful. Also, they wouldn't stop playing a role after hitting rank 1 either because they would be too scared to lose it.
---
Supermodel Feng! Shortest supermodel in the world. Thank you! :3
---
Thanks!
---
Bless lol? Was just talking to my friends about how Jake is basically just a Disney princess with the animals and everything :p
---
aww, thank you! I really appreciate it.
---
Thank you! &lt;333
---
That's so flattering!! Thank you so much! I'm really glad you like it.
---
The reason these killers are dodging is probably because they aren‚Äôt killer mains, and are more likely people who prefer survivor and are just tired of waiting 10 years for a lobby. I‚Äôd probably say I enjoy killer over survivor despite me being a much better survivor, but since this event started I‚Äôve given up with playing killer mainly because this event is survivor sided, and I don‚Äôt feel as if I can be the only one that believes that.
---
Well she's smuggling an entire lantern under there, so yeah... :P
---
I currently run urban evasion, lightweight, decisive, and I switch between sprint burst and dead hard 
---
Aww, thanks!

Please tell me he got caught and killed.
---
Also, I'm really confused as to whether that BBQ-avoidance trick works or not. It seems like it sometimes does and sometimes doesn't; yesterday I saw someone's aura in a closet anyway, but as survivor, their aura disappears when they go in a closet (I use Empathy religiously)...
---
I'm not sure if I see that one, but for the first half of the drawing, she very strongly resembled Jennifer Connolly from Labyrinth... Had to mess with the eyebrows to fix that one!
---
Thanks for the free lesson but I still don't know what your first comment means.
---
I could see that! They definitely have very complementary looks going on right now!
---
PLEASE!!!!!! I would absolutely love it!!!
---
No it doesn't seem fair enough, it's not my fault for the killers inability to make a play, this is just enabling face camp and it's an horrible strategy
---
Jesus, that one practically writes itself!
---
No kidding, especially with BBQ (which 90% of killers seem to run, and understandably so).
---
Great ideas, please bhvr make it happen :P
---
Sadly, no! :( I added like 30 people with that name to Steam, seeing if any of them are our magical pony friend.
---
IT'S A TRAP!
---
So far, no, sadly. I'm still searching. I will \_always\_ search.
---
oooooooh you fucking.... OOOOOOOOOOH! You realise Nurse is one of the hardest to play characters? And you need a lot more skill to play her than somebody like Trapper? Jesus
---
&gt;for a good nurse player its
---
YOU JUST SAID IT TAKES NO SKILL TO PLAY HER
---
Oh I guarantee he felt a bit guilty especially because it was you. Him being experienced should only add to the guilt. But laughing it off is about the only emotionally mature response you can make and the best way to play it off, even if he felt like the biggest dunce on the inside.
---
It's supposed to work, probably just dead by daylight being itself.
---
I said it a million times before but Ill say it again.Perks,items or offerings dont make you better at the game.They give you unfair advantages sure but if you are trash you stay trash.
---
Disgusting.  
---
I mean the map, it is digusting. The hit is proportionally as disgusting as the map balance, so it is fine.
---
Ye ikr, what kind of sad sad person stays are the ranks where killers don‚Äôt sweat their ass off every game :,(
---
I‚Äôve never been one to use ruin. It gets destroyed within a few minutes every game. So I just stopped running it.
---
Hex: Devour Ass
---
A hex rooting it's power in the call of nature. 
---
Survivors spawn in with their Shit Gauge empty. As they perform objective actions, their Shit Gauge fills slowly. When full, the survivor must do a channel at a Toilet to Take a Shit within sixty seconds. If the timer runs out, they Shit Their Pants, immediately going into the dying state and screaming. This gives a Loud Noise notification to the killer to reveal their location. 
---
Toilets spawn similarly to Totems around the map, though more often in buildings. Survivors can Take a Shit at any time, completely draining their Shit Gauge, even if it isn't full. The channel for Taking a Shit takes around the time to search a Jigsaw box and it also has a fun little pants dropping animation. However, while the Hex is active, one Toilet on the map becomes an Infested Toilet. If survivors try to use it at any point, the Killer will be interrupted out of anything they're doing and teleported to the Toilet for a few seconds. An animation plays of them jumping out of the toilet and injuring the survivor. This does not drain Shit Gauge for the survivor. After the animation, the Killer goes back to where they were.
---
Didn‚Äôt say they weren‚Äôt equally dickish. Maybe asshole isn‚Äôt the word but iri is super tryhard and will frustrate most people, especially when it‚Äôs a 3 man and they‚Äôre pretty much fucked. 
---
If I‚Äôm disrespecting the killer, and they finally get me, I can‚Äôt even get mad because I know I was being rude.
---
Can we make a game together bc my God you're a genius
---
Well I would prefer a fair game
---
I chased someone forever the other night. Finally caught them....DS. Oh well, catch them again. They go down between a pallet and someone drops it on me when I pick them up. So I catch them again. Firework save. 
---
....So I catch them again. I drag their ass all the way to the door (which was at 2 lights by now), and drop them on the ground. Sadly, the person opening the door flees, so I pick them up and let them wiggle free. 
---
I was outplayed hardcore. I didn't deserve any kills that game. Entity can suck my nuts.
---
I was SWF and we met up and no lie within the first 20 seconds of the game my friend was down. We were talking and billy comes out of nowhere with his chainsaw and that was the first time I heard my friend scream like that. I almost died just because I was laughing too hard to do anything.
---
I'm too busy drawing the survivors taking shits sorry
---
Tbh Ace is so sexy that I would buy him three times. 
---
Yeah, I main her. 
---
Yah this is why I feel bad playing nurse. Unless I get destroyed on corn maps, I usually get most of the team. It's sad because there is no real way to counter nurse. This is why I'm now playing other killers, though that is hard because I'm rank 8.
---
&gt;When the survivor you just died
---
I like dieding my teammates. 
---
It‚Äôs kinda impossible to mind-game a legion at a pallet. Windows too honestly. Any competent legion will be able to track you regardless.
---
God forbid I go after the easy kill, just to appease to your feelings
---
When you think about a relatively widespread young user base without that much money to spend on cosmetics, it really isn‚Äôt that surprising that most aren‚Äôt willing to spend $10 on one skin in a game that used to release whole packs of skins as $6 DLCs. I‚Äôm simply not going to pour that much money into a game that is constantly riddled with game-breaking bugs each patch and doesn‚Äôt even have dedicated servers. While most skins can be bought with iridescent shards, the grind for them is insane if you don‚Äôt play for countless hours every single day, and by the time you get enough for one skin set you then have to factor whether it‚Äôs more useful for you to actually get that skin or use those shards in the shrine to get blood points so you don‚Äôt have to play 10 more games to get through maybe 2 bloodwebs.

***recover***
---
I know it happened to me yesterday that they called me trash I killed 4 of em only one survived but they still called me trash like really lol
---
 No u
---
...guilty. lol
---
beautiful !! üèÆ‚ú®
---
Lol 
---
Am a killer main , I disagree,  that gives too much potential for abuse.
---
Personally, the thing that would stop me face camping the most is if the other survivors ran off and starting doing gens all over the place, i'd abandon the hook FAST and start patrolling.  I think it's the most logical thing a survivor can do.
---
The only times I facecamp is if I can literally see survivors waiting for me to leave the hook. 
---
Last game I played, i had a SWF vs me, I managed to down and hook one, they still had to do 2 gens but all three survivors were trying to push for a rescue, one was crouched behind a wall on the right , another trying to run to my left  and a Nea was teabagging in front of me near a pallet to try to taunt me into a chase.....naturally am gonna defend the hook.
---
There's literally no reason for me to do anything else. If only one or two of them went to do Gens, I'd have left the hook .
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts. It's made me think a bit about what I like about the game and what I can add to the discussion.
---
*Speed* - Games are quite quick paced, and even if you have a bad one it's only about 10 minutes, which leads me on to....
---
*Variety* - obviously different killers support different strategies, but playing differently as a survivor against those strategies is also important, and I like that about DBD - no two games are the same (obligatory except the Cannibal always camps lol) leading on to
---
*New Innovations* - New characters come along often enough to keep the game fresh and offer new strategies to try or test against and finally....
---
*The special Events* - I saw the Hallowe'en doctor and decided that come hell or high water I was unlocking it. Then Moonrise happens and I see the Feng Min Qipao, and I'm 80 or so points away from my 3rd coin. I'm getting it after work whatever happens. 
---
did you use mixtape? they prob got mad at that since it is a OP addon but prob just being salty 
---
Lmao yes. You put twitch in your name don't complain about possible stream sniping.
---
I hate it when people d/c for no reason. I had a game today where the first two people I downed disconnected before I even hooked them. I just disconnected too because I new I either had to wait out 5 gens or the remaining survivors would probably leave too.
---
Facts
---
In my experience from watching survivors go into lockers while I'm being hooked, their aura is always visible for a split second once they enter the locker, so perhaps they entered too late &amp; thus appeared on your BBQ?
---
I mean, Bo4 is actually kinda fun ngl
---
*YES*
---
have you met my friend nurse
---
I have been trapped by this campfire since early access, in the fog for what feels like ages. I have seen and done terrible things as a result of the horrors that The Entity has inflicted upon me. I had almost forgotten what joys can be found in such a hopeless realm. Thank you and good luck in the fog. 
---
The problem that I'm seeing here is the devs will never implement it, because it's either too much work or WOULD RUIN THE BP ECONOMY REEEEE
---
At this point you are holding the game hostage as much as they are. Is the few extra points really worth that much? You‚Äôre concerned they are going to trash talk you? What, are you 10? Grow up
---
I really want to build my own $1200 rig but I have been heavily leaning to just getting one off of ibuypower and just paying $100 a month for it. 
---
Yes and it would sense that you've been rank 1 for quite a while. So instead of putting you in rank 10  it might choose rank 5-8 to even it out, by factoring in time spent in that rank
---
&gt; typically goes directly opposite of his spawn
---
Unless you know survivor spawns ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
It gets worse when he's wearing his ugly christmas sweater. He gets *Swole*^^TM
---
It's so good, but...it's so bad...but it's so good.
---
Damn you, Bhvr! You know I can't quit you,you slut
---
At that point it doesn‚Äôt seem like it even matters. The game does that now already on a random basis. Like I‚Äôm not trying to say I hate the idea, but it just doesn‚Äôt seem like it would work well
---
Phat ass not an feng min
---
Because calling out reposters are probably the most annoying thing you can do on reddit.

Get that Rainbow Map back (if you haven't already)!

This is my misplay. So we had a game against a Huntress, I was in a 3 stack SWF. So she's not to great, misses hatchets a lot, patrol camped the random to death on our team. So we get the gens done and my mate goes down and is slapped in the basement. There's no noed so I open a door and decide to go back, thinking I can body block and we can just dodge her shit throws. So she's not around and I unhook him, I go first up the stairs to block. She blocks the stairs and BOOM! Iridecent Heads! We went the whole fucking game with her not hitting a single one of us to her getting a three K for it. It hurt. 
---
I did this to someone last night because they kept taunting me and did almost exactly as described. Got messaged calling me a loser and saying it was going on YouTube, I said please do and let me know the title so I can go laugh at you with everyone else lol
---
&gt; People should understand that the direction the game leans towards is not a conventional horror experience. Its more of a game of tag.
---
I'll respond to this point, the rest of it is useless drivel where you clearly aren't getting the point. Be it willful or truly out of absentmindedness, I don't care.
---
The game *should* be a horror experience, and I think it was meant that way from the beginning, but the designers shit the bed so hard when creating it that they can't clean up their own mess without making an even bigger one. I don't know if you were around during the magic school bus area, but it took a long damn time for them to fix the infinite issue, and multiple iterations of a fix that still haven't completely solved the problem.
---
It would take substantial changes being made to the game, but going to a stealth-based system versus this "tag" method, as you put it, would make the game worthwhile to play. Being caught out as a survivor should be "oh shit I gotta get away and hide!" not "aw fuck really? Ok here's this loop circuit I guess I gotta start running..."
---
Legion isn‚Äôt OP, Freddy on the other hand.
---
Pretty much. A 110% Killer can be looped for very long. All the while him chasing you without Frenzy would also take even longer than him just frenzy chasing you despite you being injured.
---
Waiting for OP to sell these squad checking in!
---
God this is satisfying to watch
---
Is this loss
---
Bo4 is fun but there's a lot of bullshit. 
---
I used to play on PS4 and it wasn‚Äôt terrible but it was definitely usually &lt;30 FPS most of the time, I‚Äôve recently gotten a PS4 pro and it‚Äôs working wonders particularly with boost mode.
---
A really dumb Dwight. I was Shape on Red Forest and the gates were open with only Dwight left. He started running away from the gate and I already guessed where because I saw the hatch spawn in that center house area. So chased him over there. Naturally he beat me to it and started teabagging on it as you do. But then the idiot accidentally jumped into the locker that was right by the hatch so I grabbed him and hooked him. I still have a video of that I think. 
---
Really stupid though. He could have taken the gate or the hatch and fucked up on both.
---
Honorary mention to the Meg who started teabagging a hatch with 2 gens left when I was the Huntress. But she miscalculated the distance I was from her and I grabbed her out of it. Then she DC'd. Sad part is I was already planning on letting her have the hatch until she did that. Teabaggers get no mercy.
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
What are the legitimate issues?  No dedicated servers?  They said those are coming, and those are coming BECAUSE the community has been asking for them, so gtfo with "Devs who don't listen".  What else has the community been asking the devs to do that isnt a 50/50 split controversial balance issue like the noed and ds situation.  Clearly they look into these things, DS had a different itteration on the PBE but they didnt like it.  Self care was nerfed on pbe, people cried and they listened.  The hatch was closeable, 50/50 split on feelings where survivors hated it and killers loved it.  This game gets updated all the time, you're honestly being an entitled crybaby, i can tell by the way you downvote every one of my responses to you.  What silver spoon are you talking about, im providing you examples and you're just REEEEEEing in responses, give me some examples of current games that are selling you cosmetics for less than 10$ on average.  I work an entry level job part time and have absolutely no issue affording cosmetics i would like.
---
Howdy?
---
bought the outfits with cells so i can just play the game normally, ez
---
Legion.
---
Defenetly not Legion. Spirit or Hag are better choices. 
---
Still thankful that a Hilbilly decided to spare me one game and let me get some objective points before leaving apparently because they liked my name (Totem Tickler)
---
God bless that person
---
Nope, I only bring a mori

Me too :o

almost got grabbed lmao

Plz Bulk these ill buy one

---
I'm aware and I'll keep my lobbies. As long as the pings are good enough. I happily play 150ms and below. Anything higher than 150 and I duck out. But I really don't care who spawns in swf or not. As long as ping is reasonable. I play a game of killer and then survivor etc switching after every game. So I know how painful it is to be closed out of lobbies a lot. So I try and keep them if I can. 
---
Makes sense, thanks for your insight
---
Self care, iron will, sprint burst and urban evasion. The only one I can change around from time to time is self care, but usually I end up regretting it...

Dead by daylight and Ark for me.
---
Does *anyone* know how to competently play with you, or is it everyone's mission to get you killed?
---
wow my grindr would be always up
---
I was playing ole Mikey and I had one survivor hooked and was looking for the last one, with one gen left. Suddenly he escapes and the hatch was open. Now the thing was, his friend was hooked literally right in front of the hatch. Like a second of walking away. Turns out he didn't know that opening the hatch with a key makes you automatically jump in.
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt speak ****BAGUETTE****
---
I find it  a higher bullshit to fun ratio
---
Sometimes the insult generator malfunctions, this is usually characterized by something positive. ex) gg, good game, good job, ect.
---
Is he easy to learn
---
All fences. The survivor has to be basically touching the fence to get hit over it though. 
---
I am sorry my lord nea please forgive me
---
As someone who mostly plays killer sometimes I wonder how many times this has happened to survivors I'm going against only for me to completely miss them and continue to patrol gens.
---
Same. 90% of my misses are getting antsy going for a Great check and hitting it just a hair early. Always feels so embarassing.  
---
Is she easy to learn 
---
It kinda is someone's property when he/she makes it. And I'm not defending the person who made it but I'm just done with seeing this meme getting posted every week.
---
And no worries, if anything I was the one who wasn‚Äôt clear enough. 
---
And why did you post this?
---
Thank You for your service!
---
Appreciate the heads up. Didn‚Äôt know people would start downvoting me for trying out a killer I‚Äôd never even played before on here. Big Oof. 
---
I‚Äôll watch now.
---
All right next time you write the word "Thee" I'll be sure to dig up Shakespeare and beat you to death with him since he said that before you.
---
right here officer, yep thats him
---
"next"

You seem to not understand my point that, yes maybe the game is frequently updated, but almost every update has more bugs than the last. On numerous occasions I‚Äôve seen this community come up with amazing ways to help balance the game since it seems to be such a huge issue and often times I‚Äôve seen patches roll out that actively seek to do what the user base didn‚Äôt want. And the whole point about the cosmetics is that if this game‚Äôs devs want to sell them where they are, they should at least try to act like their game as a whole holds to the same quality standard as other games that sell cosmetics for that much or more. If you have a part time job and can afford the cosmetics than good for you, but I‚Äôm sorry that not everyone can afford that luxury and has bills to pay. My original reply was meant to be a civil disagreement on your point of view but clearly you took it as a hostile attack on you so don‚Äôt call me the crybaby here. Your behavior represents  a deeply woven toxicity in this community that doesn‚Äôt allow for civil discussion about any issue because you‚Äôre too caught up about winning an argument.  Have a nice day
---
Legion is bad because there isn't currently any counterplay against them. Survivors just have to rush generators. If you're being chased by legion and they don't switch targets, you're going down.  Legion is like nurse except nurse actually takes skill to get good with. I'm not going to complain about add ons because many killers have some broken top tier add ons and that's fine because survivors have insta heals and keys. Not all games are going to be fair, that's how DbD works. The key point is that Legion doesn't have counterplay, so using good add ons all but guarantees a 3k minimum. Also, most killers do worse on bigger maps but Legion's power is made significantly worse on bigger maps because there is a much lower chance that survivors will be near each other so Legion won't be able to injury multiple survivors in their frenzy, which is the only way to do well with Legion.
---
I think the amount of shard you get for devotion is to much TBH. And getting rank 1 is also very easy once you learn how to effectively do it. But anything would be nice, maybe make it 1500-2000 shard when you get lvl 100 and maybe 100K for getting rank one
---
legion has very little killing power but has high chase potential. There is no sneaking against legion is he smacks one person with his power and you are in a locker or sneaking in his terror radius you will he found. he ignores pallets and windows the main way for survivors to out play the killer because he beats that mechanic the only thing you can do qhen hit is run as far as you can as fast. there is no counter play so its not fun very braindead.
---
for tier list id say legion is low to mid tier but i dont think he is fun for either side.
---
Yesterday I played against a group that tried to play against unexperienced players (one of them used a second account on Rank 20 so he and his Rank 1 friend could be matched up with new killers. I got a 4k with Freddy and destroyed them. They were salty as fuck.
---
Hag - Trap everywhere and you will usually win without ever having to chase much.
---
Spirit- Tons of fun and definitely towards the top of the tier list, but requires learning mind games and getting accustomed to her power or using really strong add-ons.
---
Clown- Mid to top tier depending on how people play against him and map/perks. Fun, hilarious... I mean brutal Mori animation.
---
Legion - Half of your matches will have at least one DC and the others will probably complain about Legion. Unless you lose as him, then you are bad. Not fun to play for me.
---
If you really want to weigh in the teachable perks. I would suggest Hag just for the totem perks. They can be very useful on almost all killers and interchangeable with a lot of builds.
---
Aura perks, I apologize for the shitty phrasing
---
i think if you lose connection then you don‚Äôt get banned at all, only if you leave match. i could be wrong.
---
i believe there is a minimum daily quota for end game insult chat posting on this reddit.  
---
Bond still applies, I know that much. Like I said, if the hex part of it were removed, it would become an S+ tier perk, and be stupidly overpowered 
---
I said in the post that the hex part should not be removed
---
when you realise it took you a min to get the reference, i am ashamed at myself
---
["I am so great"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTxUKRkOoHM)
---
Kinda, he‚Äôs a really cheesy killer. I only said it meme. I‚Äôd honestly recommend clown or spirit because you can do more with their powers and you can make cool builds especially with spirit. Spirit is difficult at first but she is pretty strong once you get her down. Clown is tougher to learn but he‚Äôs ruthless in chases once you do learn him.
---
Personally I think you should get spirit. 
---
Yesterday i faced a killer who had a tombstone + increased t1 lunge lol
---
I want Legion's teachable perks, but I am not sure I actually want to play Legion.
---
This doesn't help you in any way, I just don't want to make my own thread about it.
---
I'm not trying to dispute that the game would be more interesting as a stealth game. 
---
I only play killer myself, and yes I was around during the school bus shenanigans era. It's just that at this point it's clear that the devs don't want this to be a stealth based horror game. If that were the case, we'd have no scratch marks, better sound design and no "sound bubble" mechanic.
---
I can honestly understand why they wouldn't take the "stealth game" approach tho. Stealth as a mechanic works real bad in multiplayer games, as you can't code people into having bad hearing/shit eyesight 
---
If it was a lagswith you would see the teammates walking into walls this is simply desync since as he goes down the teammates are moving just fine
---
That doesn't happen. At least not on a regular basis. Not even on a semi-regular basis 
---
Like, there are times where I throw a hatchet and it literally goes through a survivor's body, but I don't think that happening occasionally means there is some massive issue to fix like this OP acts
---
happens to me every time i play against legion kappa not kappa
---
All of it. It's kind of tricky tho 
---
Do you have an actual rebuttal or are you just going to post nonsense? 
---
Thank you thats what its called. Also people apparently downvoted whenever someone says it isn't a stretch for some reason.
---
A rather... irritable friend I play with from time to time was on a hook, and a Dwight ran up to him and proceeded to break a dull totem while the killer was nowhere near. In that time my friend went into Stage 2 and then after he got unhooked the killer returned and insta downed him. I then had to deal with his yelling for the next five minutes.
---
No, what I'm saying is that you're not truly mid-pallet 
---
What kind of response is that tf
---
this happened to me when i was trying to get my adept huntress,
---
i felt bad and was planning to give tap the hatch but so i hooked the other person just for him to die when it opened lol 
---
maybe an easier fix, since this isn‚Äôt going to happen, would be to have double blood point weekends like once a month. it‚Äôs not as much as this, but it‚Äôs something 
---
Im sorry, im not the one who started the hostilities saying i was born with a silver spoon for being able to afford 10$ for a cosmetic in a game that ive put hundred of hours into, and downvoted every single post of opposition rofl.  Again, you're not giving any examples of games that charge less for cosmetics, unless you're suggesting that dbd is the worst game that exists that sells them.
---
I think that, even though it is mostly a solo game, a big part of the experience comes from the teammates. 
---
I've had so many good teammates that tried their best to unhook me while struggling, just to get captured by the killer. I always thank them at the end.
---
If they could do that for a complete potato like myself, the least I should do is return the favor for the next bunch of teammates. 
---
I love seeing posts like this! Welcome to the dbd fandom :) I loved that you called the Hag a "dirt witch" haha c: just keep grinding (bc like this game is ALL GRINDING haha) and learning both sides of the game! Killer and survivor. The more you know about both sides, the better of a player you'll become. 
---
Why use Sole Survivor without Object of Obsession though?
---
Can you imagine Nightmare Freddy from FNAF in this game??
---
That would be hilarious. 
---
It would seem weird since you have really bad understanding of analogies

Cannibal should have his yellow speed and acceleration add-ons. They don't even work right now, so not only is Cannibal not great to begin with, 1 of his purple addons and 3 other major addons are uselss. He doesn't even have pink addons yet.

Aww, I think she looks pretty. xD But thank you!

Get outta here ya damn scum!
---
I pray every day that fnaf and DBD will not cross paths. It would be a curse upon this game.
---
You ever play a game without ruin?
---
&gt; I totally agree with you. The matches feel much, MUCH longer but they only last a couple of minutes. You don't need to sit down in a 30 minute match just to see the "DEFEAT" screen.
---
Yeah - this is another thing I like actually - if you're playing alone you are free to either watch your teammates or drop and move on. It's a nice touch. 
---
&gt;I like this point too. Between what perks and items you bring into the match, what killer you are facing, the perks that the killer brings into the match, the map and how the map is generated, it is almost a brand new game ever game.
---
Absolutely - and you highlighted how you build your survivor really well. I was just thinking about my current survivor build - Feng Min - Self care, Decisive Strike, Sprint Burst, Lithe.
---
I think that says a lot about how I approach the game - that I expect to be spotted and have to run, and I'm happy to be the bait while the others get things done.
---
no u
---
Haddonfield or Preschool (not sure if I‚Äôm spelling that right), with Spirit.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what it is about it, but I have trouble finding them while phasing in those maps. Maybe it‚Äôs because of the big open streets, they‚Äôre less likely to be sprinting around? I dunno. I hate it. Usually when I get those maps and I‚Äôm not catching anyone in the first few mins, I just spontaneously decide to let them farm.
---
Haddonfield  for every killer honestly

[huntress trying to find somewhere to throw a hatchet](https://t7.rbxcdn.com/318deed653f53d5fc09ac0ce8a212737)
---
As often as it happens to me as Survivor, and as rarely as it happens to me as Killer, I'm sure I miss 90% of them.
---
It's decent but she also starts with Ruin, and running Ruin alongside another hex perk is just asking for both of them to be found and destroyed.
---
Thats a fact of life for console players
---
Insidious bubba could care less to where you bring him. Though the swamp maps are total shit shows tbh.
---
These would all be nice. I feel like Kindred would be very strong for all survivors, but helpful for solo que survivors. Especially against camping killers, (maybe that negates Insidious with a baseline built in skill? Lame perk anyway.) Trapper needed this decision made on day 1.
---
I've had the same nonsense happen once when escaping with a green map. This sort of nonsense is the exception, not the rule. I would just advise you to keep calm and grind on. You'll see more rainbow maps with time.
---
Not for basement builds. 
---
&gt;remove the only fun part of the game
---
Lol
---
Say you get about 40k bp (offering + any bp perk like BBQ), still means about 50 games or so level 50 a new character...
---
It is a grind. Still haven't done clown, Kate and Jeff...I'm 400 hours in (relatively new myself)
---
That‚Äôs not what I hate.  I hate being blind for the entire chase.  I hate how his power encourages tunneling.  I hate how his perks quite literally tell him when survivors are doing gens, trying to hide, and trying to save their friend.  That is what I hate.

---
That would explain why several of the killers I've faced recently don't seem to have any follow through or know how to really chase. I guess it's Survivor mains queueing up to get games? Had a Wraith that literally just hit people into injured status and went off after somebody else the second you window vaulted/pallet dropped him once. 
---
I've used it and still had the Killer spawn 10 seconds away. I'm not convinced it actually works.
---
Edgy. It's probably not a bad idea to bring a Mori, though.
---
yeaw but still this map is bullshit 
---
Most new players tend to struggle as survivor because a lot of good survivor play relies on map knowledge, which obviously a new player doesn't have. Learning where pallets/windows are and learning how to loop optimally improves your chances of survival drastically. The meta is more about wasting the killer's time while your other teammates do generators rather than losing the killer. With some practice, killers won't seem so op.
---
Hag is decent at hex defending and godly if you use mint rag.
---
Legion takes all the skill in survivor play (properly looping tiles) and throws it out the window. You looped perfectly before throwing the pallet/vaulting the window? Doesn't matter, legion can just vault it and hit you anyway.
---
He essentially takes any skillful play (chases) out of the game, and to many survivors chases are the only fun part of the game, so it's not difficult to see why people hate playing against the legion. 
---
Beautiful!

Kate in a suit or armour is the cosmetic I never knew I needed

---
I would roast anyone.. but there isn't anyone there...
---
The pallet hitboxes also fuck the killer quite often, the pallet doesn‚Äôt hit them at all but they still get stunned. Also, FIX HUNTRESS AND HILLBILLY
---
4 times by the time all gens were done. I was determined to get the fucker
---
Thanks! Much appreciated!
---
if there are no hooks might as well slug them. It be like that.
---
Get clown because he‚Äôs thicc. But yea concerning your other topic... if a Claudette is using decisive strike then tunnel them until they die. It‚Äôs incredibly satisfying when they don‚Äôt even struggle on their last trip to the hook. You know you‚Äôve ruined their game at that point
---
They've already changed the Coldwind Farm Maps. The Pig Tree Loop has been made much shorter and windows on the infinite loops have been blocked off.   
---
Jungle Gyms are the same as other maps, you can see through those too. What makes the tiles on Coldwind so difficult?  
---
PS: This a sincere question, not being a schlong-nozzle.
---
I would uninstall if borrowed time was made stock the way it is now
---
yeah, I know. I just wonder how the devs would know that? cause if you report on PS4, you just tap the icons. so like, by chance if 20 people tapped on the "unsportsmanlike" report button, what does that tell the devs? 
---
not sure if it's only really ban-worthy if people send in videos, which I have no issues with cause I've done nothing wrong. 
---
Dang, and I thought the Huntress who used Iridescent Hatchets and the add-on that tracks you for 5s after being hit was bad enough. She spent the match missing and just chasing people. Got her first down hitting the person opening the exit gate.
---
It‚Äôs because the game has an exciting gameplay loop with enough variation to keep every game just different enough so that every match is fresh. All the different perks, maps, killers and variances in player skill/style make every game unique. In addition to that, it has a fantastic leveling/perk system that constantly keeps the player engaged as you always has something to work towards unlocking. 
---
Having said all that, the game is still a giant pile of shit years after release because it‚Äôs managed by one of the most incompetent dev teams I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs actually incredible how they were able to come up with the brilliant aforementioned stuff, but then be so awful at everything else. It‚Äôs almost like it was handled by two totally different teams. 
---
That‚Äôs actually hilarious. I play enough of both but for this event i‚Äôd obviously rather play survivor, but its so damn rough rn
---
Hillbilly Insanely powerful and easy to play as. 
---
Yeah well it takes some effort, since me, 550hours in DBD, never been higher than rank 10. I guess I'm still shit.
---
And what comes to "many ways to get shards", I only know one way, so please, tell me the others
---
meh, i just try to help my friends, and if the killer comes, i give them a free hit or two for points
---
They don‚Äôt stack like that, if you get a 32k game, you have BBQ, so you get 64k, with a bloody party streamer, you get 96k, not 128k
---
is reporting TOO MUCH something to get banned over? haha 
---
Im pretty positive it gives extra bp for scoring events, it does not multiply the ending deviousness score (it doesnt give you 8000√ó3, it just makes it easier to get to 8000 deviousness) meaning that your final score isnt 56000, and even if it did multiply it, judging from how bps and bbq works, it probably wouldn't multiply it by 56000. Pretty sure the max amount of bp you can earn wow 192,000 bp, because 5 bps and bbq. This does not include daily rituals obviously.
---
when the killer looks over the corn, then youll know
---
We are assuming that the system from the post is in-game
---
What a play by the *THICC* MAN
---
Sounds balanced to me definitely not op. 
---
32k from the match + 32k BBQ + 160k All players offering bloody party = 224k total.
---
Clown thicc
---
I don't think they pay attention to that. From what I saw they want you to submit a ticket thing with video. I'm still not aware of any bans except Ochido
---
You‚Äôre ugly and smell bad
---
Not that I wouldn't love getting double perks, but isn't this another band-aid fix? If we're going to fix the grind I feel like we need to add progressively more perks to bloodwebs each time a new killer/survivor is released, no?
---
Also I don't think there's any way BHVR will lessen the shard grind, as nice as that would be.
---
Red ranks I rarely ever see a camper. If killers camp they usually lose pretty quickly if survivors just do gens.
---
Me: This game is awful

Legion isn‚Äôt fun to play against. 
---
I don't remember him being this thin before.  I feel like they tinkered with the body shape and now he looks a bit emaciated.
---
Got it. The video makes sense, especially when someone is actually hacking or holding the game hostage. The devs must know that we are a salty fan base, otherwise lol 
---
Howdy partner! ü§†
---
The systems in the post are not in game, they're suggestions to ADD in game, and I'm very doubtful because BHVR devs are not famous for listening to their fanbase
---
Remove Legion, sure. Most of us can agree on that.
---
Stopped playing.  I jump into a survivor round now and again but outside of that just not worth the frustration.
---
Because Legion is unfun to play against. They have no counterplay and are just boring to fight. 
---
The more you care about something, the more critical you are of its flaws. We all want this game to succeed and grow, that's why we talk shit about it so much.

Self-care, Botany Knowledge, Pharmacy, and Streetwise. The cult of Pharmacy is superior to all other perk builds!
---
Both because legion isn't super fun to fight and because during this event people are dcing left and right.
---
This game sucks I‚Äôm gonna go back to it at the next *millisecond* see yall /s
---
I would very much like this
---
*fistbump* 
---
Fuck dem lanterns
---
Well fucking obviousely she is, she counters looping. Thats why she is the best killer. It doesn't take any skill out of the game, and it fucking surely doesn't give you a free win. She is still hard after 50 levels, high risk high reward type of playstyle. Plus she moves slower than a survivor, so you have to rely on your blinks to get hits in. 
---
Ok thanks I am going to get spirit once get to 9000 shards THX
---
Wdym? Most killers/survivors are forced to run super sweaty builds in order to have a chance at winning, you have to be extremely objective focused st high ranks, and even then it's usually not killer favored.
---
Then let's mention the leveling and perk system. It's fine, but those God damn bloodpoints gains are awful, like actually awful to the point the grind sucks so bad. I hate this damn grind. I just wanna play what survs/killers I want with the perks I want. Not RNG. 
---
How is Princess Ace not a go to? And don't forget Princess Billy
---
What‚Äôs this from again?
---
Except I am doing it right now. I haven't bought the DLC yet. Why do you think I would ask the question AFTER I would have bought it?
---
fellow zappy boi main
---
don't bring the vacuum back just fix the hitboxes
---
... LOGIC!
---
Thanks! It's nice to see a nice welcome in a game for a change. 
---
&gt; I loved that you called the Hag a "dirt witch" haha c: 
---
I keep forgetting the names of the killers, so I just identify them by something simple. 
---
That witch popped up from the ground on one game, so for me she is the "dirt witch" :P
---
*(Just so I can identify it from the other one that teleports, the one that screams a lot and has the face covered)*
---
It‚Äôs couldn‚Äôt care less
---
Ah ok. So it just adds the multiplier to each category instead of the entire score? I wasnt sure on that. My bad, thanks 
---
Ahhhh PTSD flashbacks of the time I got into a full No Mither Sabo Squad.
---
Perhaps stop joining random lobbies when you want to run SWF builds? What's the point of running a support your team perk set when there's no team to begin with? Find a SWF group, they'll appreciate you. What you're doing now is pointless.
---
Wow that's cool. I am glad we managed to get this far. I know not everything is possible the way we imagine it, but maybe we can inspire the team a bit.
---
Have a nice day! 
---
no mother
---
People have seen success by restarting the game and play a killer match.

As someone who regularly makes custom skins and models for Valve games like Team Fortress 2 or Counter-Strike, it really wouldn't take all that much work to implement a blood overlay on textures. Textures are completely flat, with some unused space in the file (in most cases, face maps are usually an exception). They could use a single bloody overlay for every cosmetic (if they were going the lazy route), and it would look decent, except for the occasional stretching of the texture on particular models. And, if you're wondering what blood on the blank parts of the texture would do, it would do nothing since the blank parts aren't rendered/aren't visible.
---
Or, maybe they make a unique blood texture for each cosmetic. If *one* person was working on it, sure, it'd take "alot of work", but maybe a competent team of 10 people who have designed the blood/bloody cosmetics before, it would take about 1-2 weeks, and that's on the high end. Implementation of the feature and testing might add another few days, because they already allow separate models for each cosmetic slot. And, a good amount of the cosmetics are retextures of already unique models, making the overlay route even easier.
---
TL:DR it wouldn't take much work.
---
‚ÄúFamily loves and depends on him‚Äù üòÇ
---
Yeah but it just comes down to practice. And obviously try to avoid being spotted but if you do get spotted, just run the killer as long as you possibly can.
---
First, we need to get this implemented, then we can negotiate
---
Yeah, good teammates are the best. One of my favorite matches last year came from when my boyfriend &amp; I queued up with another 2-man SWF in a lobby. We were on the Chapel map &amp; vs a Trapper &amp; we managed to pull off a four-man escape that involved most of us getting hooked, rescued from a hook, running to an open exit, healing, then going back for our fallen comrade, repeat. It was a really good time.
---
Gate is open, one guy getting facecamped by the killer, and two of us all healed up at the gate.
---
I signal to the Claudette to assist me with the unhook, and she follows suit. Once I'm actually near the hook, the Claydette makes a sharp turn back and leaves...
---
So I decided that I'd still go for the save. Get hit once, unhook, get downed, and get facecamped. All fine with me. Until....
---
The damn Jeff came back to rescue me without even healing!
---
You can guess how that went -.-
---
Fair point :)
---
Okey so assuming you‚Äôll get between 400 to 800 points per match and leveling up between 3 or 5 games (where you get iridescent shards, plus the devotion reward you‚Äôll be good. On the other side you have the rank reward which since you can‚Äôt get below rank 15 it would be fair to get rewarded from the lowest rank you get from killer or survivor, I mean if you‚Äôre saying you play enough to get to high ranks at least, well getting those rewards plus the bp I think is fair enough to keep the idea to choose the lowest so that is not that easy to get stuff anyway, let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs just helping players to get what nowadays takes even more time if you don‚Äôt want to spend money. (P.S. I played dbd for more than a year and a half now and I‚Äôm talking from what I saw from many players (friends most of it) where many of them had more than 3k hours and you know...they play a lot than me or as I used to)
---
I've been playing a lot more Killer than Survivor this event and the amount of times I've gone "UHHHHHHHHHHHH I'M GOING TO BE ACCUSED OF LAG SWITCHING" (shitty dorm WiFi yay) is impressive.
---
In particular the other day I had a game as Myers where a Survivor was on top of a hill and my mouse was bugging out so I attacked the hill below them. *And they went down.*
---
&gt;**UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH**
---
" Also I‚Äôm assuming your referring to noob3 for the 50 escape vids, he‚Äôs pretty good but his friend carried him and got him out practically every game. "
---
Vooshy (his friend) didn't get out 50 times. It was mainly operation get Noob3 out. Vooshy got out a lot too but their focus was to get Noob3 out.
---
Yeah I was thinking that too, but it still says I have 0/100. 
---
Thanks I‚Äôll give that a shot 
---
Bruh Cannibal could easily defeat Hillbilly.
---
At least not queen (community manager) saw this

---
Wraith and Trapper are the easiest to master.
---
I know he's not on your list, but, honestly, Myers is an insanely easy killer that provides decent results for fairly minimal amounts of learning. Having insta-downs makes the Killer's job *so* much easier (see: NOED) and that's why Myers returns such solid results. His power's not complex in the slightest (just stalk when you get the chance or if someone's dancing behind a pallet), plus his lunge range is ridiculous; you can be majorly sloppy with your lunging and still catch people. I could actually argue that Myers is a little bit boring to play, but he is pretty easy to do well at so there we go.
---
He has a whole bunch of builds if you want to mess around with the whole "L√©ry's Scratched Mirror jump fest bonanza" and is just generally really easy to use. The hardest part about Myers is making sure you get out of EW1 as fast as possible (bit luck dependent on you finding someone). He's naff at countering looping, but his long lunge and insta-downs means that you only have to win one loop to get the down, rather than two, and the extra lunge means you can clip them in instances where other killers would miss. His other drawback is that his teachable perks are basically awful, except for potentially Save The Best For Last on some killers, but even on those killers it certainly isn't essential.
---
From your list I'd pick Hag or Clown. Hag is harder to learn than Clown because you have to understand that you can't spend ages chasing people around without traps down, but I think Hag is more fun as a result. Clown is kinda fun, and the bottle throwing does require a bit of learning, but once you get that down then he gets a bit more generic as a Killer.
---
Yikes
---
NAH.
---
This was after a 4K where I wanted to let last guy live but he dced
---
Yeah. I just double checked cause just now I ‚Äúescaped with lantern‚Äù and still I‚Äôm at 0/100. Kinda lame 
---
Really!!!!!! plz keep it on topic. For the last time it's none of your business to ask my age.. THX PLZ keep it on topic. This is not an age thread this about dead by daylight....

More like [Getting event cosmetics] [Playing the game]

I luckily enjoy Killer more during this event and find it easier to get points as Killer overall, but it's so painful when I want to play with my mates or do some dailies and need to wait like 10 minutes to find a game. Yesterday I went into a SWF with some friends and a friend had to leave in like 20 minutes to go do something. We didn't find a match before he had to leave.
---
I swear sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm on r/SubredditSimulator when I see posts like this.
---
Trapper should hold all traps at a time (similar to have) and his bag add ons should be reworked to something else
---
Waiting for them dedicated servers. I've seen things similar happen in low ping games, though. I dunno, maybe it's not the hitbox but like let me put it this way, this wasn't happening before 2.5 came out (as much) and my pings have been roughly the same since before 2.5 so something funky is going on.
---
The game feels unplayable outside of at least due swf. We dont even voice most of the time. It's just we know we can all play decent and we actually play as a team. We still die plenty but it's at least not a total ****storm.

Stop spamming the sub ffs.

yep, I double pip more often than I single pip, which is more often than I safety or depip. 
---
Oh god no why god oh fuck no
---
Again, not that simple. Firstly, DBD's cosmetics aren't currently layers. The current cosmetics aren't layered on a body, they *are* the body. It's why you had issues like the gap in David's torso. Switching from shirtless David to David with a shirt doesn't add a shirt, it swaps his entire torso.
---
Even beyond that, there's such a wide variety of cosmetic shapes, thicknesses, and styles that simply applying a morphing mesh over them would look like absolute ass. It'd look fine on simpler pieces, but as soon as the style went away from the base you'd have issues. Changing from pants to a dress, or form fitting to ruffled, or having morning surface bits like the Blight cosmetics...
---
But thank you for proving my point about not understanding how much work it would be.
---
Chat was heartless when they refused to have Noob save that hero. R.I.P Vooshy your sacrifice will not be forgotten. 
---
Yeah I completely understand that, but I honestly just queue up with SWF because I want to play with my friends and just fuck around as we get no gens done. Everyone‚Äôs got their own prefs so don‚Äôt take what people say to heart.
---
Backstory:  Sabo Jakes sabotaged all the hooks in front of killer on another post.  Someone said it was a dirty tactic, positive upvotes.  This guy says it‚Äôs almost as dirty as running Ruin every last game.  Lots of downvotes.  Someone says ‚Äúor decisive‚Äù and they get upvotes and others tell them how Decisive is super toxic.  Found the killer mains, I guess.
---
All thats missing is billy's shitty ability to zoom around the map
---
Yeah, but you have to count all the DC's, campers and tunnelers etc. especially in low ranks
---
Let me know if it worked for you! So far 6 people have said it worked for them when I tell them. I always like to see if it‚Äôs a trend. 
---
For the last time keep it on topic THX... 
---
Adrenaline, too good not to run. 
---
We‚Äôre gonna live forever, more bp 
---
Small game, cause I like totems 
---
Fourth perk changes a lot but since the changes I‚Äôve been using prove thyself. Other times I‚Äôll use we‚Äôll make it for that faster healing after unhook or deliverance. 
---
I def wouldn't say I'm really good.   I did, however, have a good round this time!
---
Gee, wonder what's gonna pop out from those traps right after you've unhooked them.
---
"hallelujah starts playing in the background"
---
Yeah, I guess it will tone down the "seriousness" vibe of the game.
---
Like, you have Jason and Myers, some spirits from the other world and... a bear costume. 
---
ROFL.  
---
Listen man Insidious noed bubba could defeat billy even with the infinity gauntlet.
---
It's honestly whatever dude. If I'm being honest, I'm just not going to believe you without video evidence. And even then I don't care enough to watch 23 games. 
---
BEHAVIOR PLEASE NEW MASK. As much as I love Michael he seriously looks like a cartoon character in Dead by Daylight's more grungy settings. That white William Shatner mask makes him look like an indie game jumpscare character than an offical Killer. Maybe that's why he's so spooky.
---
&gt; I thought that "Exposed" just meant that the killer could see my aura but nope.
---
Behavior: GOT EM
---
Exposed sounds cool, but it's not intuitive. 
---
I'm gonna say somethings you would learn in time, but it'll speed you up a little bit.
---
&gt; I really HATE that some killers focus so much on one survivor making him/her unable to gather enough points
---
We call that "tunneling." Tunnel vision for the survivor.
---
&gt; I read somewhere that the maps are randomly generated and I do think they are.
---
You will see offerings to send you to a Realm. Realms consist of similar maps.
---
Maps are randomly chosen if there's no "map offering." If you play the offering then maps of that realm are randomly chosen (except for realms without variations).
---
Main objects like gens, hooks, pallets and totems are randomly placed. Some other objects follow the a basic guideline for that map (placement of cars/junk, mazes, haystacks, trees, etc.), but also contain a bit of randomization.
---
As you go on, you will learn the maps pretty well.
---
&gt;  Find the secret door and escape all the same!
---
Called Hatch or Black Lock.
---
A couple tips since this mechanic really annoys me: Luck is garbage. Don't ever Kobe (successfully getting yourself off the hook) unless you're in a dire situation. Luck doesn't affect chests right now, so don't play a Vigo's Jar of Salty Lips and then be disappointed with a Broken Key.
---
Good luck, have fun.
---
WGLF!
---
Wtf, is my wi-fi not working or is it just impossible to see posts in that sub
---
Ey howdy howdy bang bang
---
I thought this as a subreddit for Dead By Daylight, where we could talk as a community about game experiences?
---
Are we comparing decisive to ruin
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more the fact that my teammates let me down when this happens. 6/10 times I end up dying off of that first hook because my team is either too scared or too occupied to help 
---
Lol, it is better than dying. I‚Äôd rather DC and lose my points and start another game with a killer that has counter play rather than stay in with Legion. 
---
Why do you enjoy playing him??
---
"Hey Listen"
---
Dont forget your WingMan Ruin
---
just to slow the game down 
---
"just a little bit"
---
Dink &lt;3
---
Forgot about the ‚Äústrategy‚Äù thing hahaha anyway hope my opinion did get to a point ‚Äúif you want something, you need effort to get it‚Äù. I don‚Äôt usually add, but it would be nice to play if you want to :)
---
I only play survivor really, but I only see ruin about every fifth game. So yeah, not every killer uses it every single game.
---
it adds an incentive to get out of rank 15 and stop disconnecting
---
If I may ask, why is everyone hating him?
---
AND THIS TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT LONGER COMBINES WITH HEX: RUIN SO EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF!!!
---
It doesn't matter if it's 1 person or 10, lol. The amount of work it the same, it's just the time that would be different. And it's still an unnecessary amount of work for an irrelevant 'feature.' And the existing retextures are just that, re*textures.* Not even those use an overlay to change the model, it's its own texture.
---
Hell, even the existing prestige pieces are textures, the blood baked right in to the texture itself. If they'd wanted an overlay they'd have done it from the off, rather than having to design 3 unique bloody textures for every character.
---
Why can't survivors just climb over the walls
---
Si
---
AHH YOU MAKEY BUBBA BRAIN HURT.  
---
Yeah I'm not sure whats going on with that. I was able to wiggle out twice because of that lol
---
Haha no worries all good in the neighbourhood, and well I've uninstalled dbd already, otherwise would've been nice!
---
I don't think one screenshot of a 4k really proves anything about the state of the game though lol. don't really see why you're bringing arguments about game balance onto this post 
---
&gt; Hatchets haven‚Äôt gone through survivors in multiple patches so it‚Äôs likely just piss poor internet. 
---
Nope, mine is fine
---
&gt; It happens pretty well 1 or more times per match. 
---
Not for me so it's likely just piss poor internet 
---
&gt; It is a pretty big issue when a survivor gets completely screwed by the game and then it spirals into the killers favour because of a bug. It happens all the time. 
---
This is just not an accurate representation of reality.
---
tbh I should start making posts about all the bullshit missed hits I have or how Blood Lust actually ruins your frame rate
---
Ruin isn't even close to DS.  NOED is the killer DS.  
---
ds can only be used once...and by one survivor...and is easily avoided by juggling the survivor...
---
Ruin is RNG as to where the totem is, and can bring a game to slow crawl.
---
LMAO. If you think *that* was condescending you have some pretty thin skin. 
---
ofc they do , i ran into killers like that once or twice i always go down there , why make all gens and leave and have absolutly no thrill? sometimes the thrill chases you , sometimes you gotta chase the thrill man!
---
More info: The basement was in the killer shack so this is the guaranteed hook spawn near the basement. Apparently the event doesn't recognize this hook which is why it isn't an event hook. 
---
Since the event didn't recognize the hook it spawned the lantern in the same spot. I was able to break the lantern though.
---
This seems to confirm that lanterns spawn in unused hook spawn locations. That should help with finding them.
---
What are your thoughts on this then or what makes it confusing or worrisome? 
---
Just look at this. You didn‚Äôt even try to put any effort into it
---
Stop. Now.
---
Oh, I dont hate him, i watch his videos. But there's no doubt he complains a lot. I assume that's why some people dont like him
---
It‚Äôs because your OP legion and the game is trying to stop ya.
---
Downvotes deserved, upvotes deserved
---
Yeah, I just went with this assumption it's a case like (this)[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep]
---
I uh suppose those are ideas.
---
Delete Legion
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs so much a fear of being eaten but a fear of disappointing them, the creators of Texas Chainsaw Massacre described him as ‚Äú a big baby‚Äù that does what he‚Äôs told without question.
---
Lol just trying to get that achievement. Michael's my favorite.
---
Decisive strike can be used by all 4 survivors. The obsession can use it immediately where as everyone else has to wiggle to 35%.
---
Great idea.... nearly missed it hiding in amongst the shite memes.
---
Especially Rotten Fields. Corn everywhere 
---
To top it off bubba has a nice bulge. Lol
---
Did it's aura still light up while carrying a Survivor? Cause if so that's an even bigger bitch of a bug.
---
Lmao 
---
It did not.
---
Kill your parents it's the only way
---
I remember I learnt about the game at Launch, but as a teen with strict parents, couldn‚Äôt get it till 2018. 
---
I remember my first game was vs Freddy and everyone was mad at me for not waking them up lol. 
---
The Chad cannibal: doesn‚Äôt even need his own perks
---
The virgin hillbilly: uses the Chad cannibal‚Äôs perks
---
The other day I actually spawned with the killer looking at me within the terror radius. And I was the obsession of course. Shortest match of my life
---
The shards reward on the season rewards are pretty useless. If you stay at rank 1 for an entire year straight you get the equivalent of 1 shrine of secrets perk? Pretty lame imo
---
When you want your EW3 to be infinity +1
---
Fantastic leveling system you got to be fucking kidding me are we talking about the same game? 
---
I actually spawned with the killer staring at me barely out of lunge range the other day. I was also the obsession, because why not. 
---
Being Called a noob camper in 3 different languages every game never gets old.
---
I literally can't tell the difference between 30fps and 60fps
---
God **JOINED**
---
An old lady named Peggy who sits in a cubicle from 9-5 reading all the complaints 
---
She thicc thanks the setting us up man, I owe you.
---
I quit Realm Royale maybe hell do something to make me quit this game. I don't like DBD but I still play it. 
---
Why do people use autistic as an insult? Please stop.
---
Yep, I had a similar problem last night. All gens repaired, grabbed a lantern - saw the lantern in my upper corner (but no particle effects,) escaped. Gens counted, lantern didn't, 20 points instead of 45.
---
I also swear every legion has noed which is so fcking annoying 
---
I have 1200 hours in DBD and have spent many hours on this subject and this has to be the best ideas I've ever seen. 
---
I like the perk names the most.
---
I‚Äôd literally take NOED over sloppy butcher with legion
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs really annoying when that happens. But at the same time a lot of us don‚Äôt have time to waste. I have a pretty busy life and only get time for a couple matches a day, so if I‚Äôm hooked right away and it doesn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm getting saved soon I‚Äôll just let myself die on hook and move on. Otherwise I waste all my time on two rounds where I don‚Äôt enjoy myself. 
---
Might need a better/newer tv or monitor friend.
---
What are you trying to say here?  Do have a problem with people who are Autistic????
---
I don't think they'll do most of this shit because they want to make the game as grindy and hard to get shards as possible. Same with BP they don't want people to get to the point where they feel like they have everything because then they might stop playing. 
---
I think I just need new eyes lol
---
You stood 2 hours in the game doing nothing instead of playing. You didn't win anything. XD
---
When there is 2 or 3 people on a gen somehow someone always fucks it up, must be something psychological
---
I wish we got 30fps on console 
---
LOL...funny but so so true!
---
This with for honor and destiny 2
---
*tusken raider noises*
---
Well Noed is a fundamentally broken perk but there is no need to be that toxic
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just because my killer is low rank but it seems every other game I end up getting a cheeky kill I didn‚Äôt even deserve because someone tbags like an idiot in the exit gate and billy can 1 shot.
---
Once I downed a survivor near a locker and went to pick them up. I aimed my mouse horribly and accidentally opened the locker, no biggie. Went to pick him up again and accidentally opened the locker again. Both times was me just being an idiot so I was just like ‚Äúokay let me just actually position myself properly‚Äù. But by then the survivor noticed what was going on and they put themselves right in front of the locker and made me open it like 2 more goddamn times. Was hilarious but actually made me waste like 20 seconds, so well played 
---
I mean, four gens  for one hook. Seems like a good trade.
---
\&gt;Climbing walls.
---
\&gt;Same amount of effort as literally leaning over a palette. 
---
Killers can't hit through windows anymore. Nor can they lunge. Any mobility or logical use of one's arms is toxic for the game. Not like survivor mains crying about anything that gives a killer a slight edge, though. That's perfectly healthy for the game.
---
Agreed
---
Events should make people enjoy playing. I dread every DBD event because it basically turns into a HUGE shit fest. Nothing EVER works properly, and to put some icing on the cake this time you put survivors agains't each other more than before. People are getting their teammate caught so they can go grab the lantern they have. Utter rubbish of an event.
---
I mean if you aren't obese climbing a 10ft wall with a million little notches and breaks in it is honestly just as easy
---
Ahhhhhhhhh. Well regardless "loving family" lol. Know it's a meme but still.
---
You are much more wise than lots of rank 10s to be honest 
---
This is so good.
---
PS4 
---
U didnt do shit lol ur just lucky he missed a point blank chainsaw
---
I'd argue it's more likely in the middle-ish ranks for the DS user to be pretty bad. Half the time they use it on their first down with 5 gens still up, get away for 10 seconds then down again. It got to the point where I hardly dribble just to get them to use it early, unless they're actually good in a chase.
---
tanku.
---
Third seal already blocks aura perks
---
Good post. Also you‚Äôre grading analogy about the scoring system is spot on
---
I've been having shit like that happen with keys too. Even had a game where I escaped exit with key, had both addons on it (keep key if killed, keep key if open hatch) and lost the addon for opening it. Which..I ran out the gate, and still had the keyring so wtf?
---
I actually had to laugh pretty hard because of this post. Take my upvote
---
Well to be fair, the matriarch in his family does present it that way
---
Cool, that's good to hear
---
New killer... Cubicle Peggy. Mori - staples your whole body. 
---
I agree that the idea of Legion is really cool. I don't like how they implemented a lot of it as his back story and mechanics don't really make sense. Even his trailer made 0 sense as he has no hide or camouflage mechanisms.
---
For me when I play killer, I enjoy out playing my opponents in chases. Knowing my actions were better than theirs. Knowing there is no counter play to Legion, I don't enjoy running straight lines and pressing M1.
---
If you get tired of DCs and don't like Billy, but are looking for other fun killers I'd suggest Spirit. Has a similar speed mechanic, but has huge out play potential. 
---
Throw. The. Pallet. Down. Sooner. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL8e2ujXe8g
---
Stop fucking crying that you got hit because you insisted on looping that pallet x number of times instead of just throwing the fucking thing down and being guaranteed that you don't get hit. 
---
Yea I can‚Äôt even imagine how pissed I would get if I gave someone the hatch and they didn‚Äôt leave right away. But every time I‚Äôve given people hatch was because I thought they were a respectful and talented player who deserves it, I never give it to toxic players 
---
Exactly. The question is why, if so many survivors have to play killers to get games, do the ones that don‚Äôt switch over still have hour long queue times?
---
its just spooky hide and seek with some other stuff and its poorly optimized, the events arent exciting, bugs all over the place (invisible pallets bug makes me wanna fucking shoot myself).
---
despite all that its still pretty fun
---
Seriously. What the fuck even is "bloodpoint economy". What's wrong with having more BP? Survivors get better perks faster? But so do the killers. I see no issue lol.
---
Had two games in a row last night where people wiggled free because when I tried to hook them on a hook that I had already used once, I just wobbled back and forth in front of it for a bit instead of putting them on.  
---
Probably will still play more tonight. I love you, *bitch*. Fix this fucking game I'm not going to abandon it I've loved it since beta.
---
Most of the perks are pretty useless and the blood webs are so random they are not well designed at all. It gets even worse when you have bad teachables in your bloodwebs. Also a lot of add ons are useless or even hurt you. All those add ons for killer like speed limiter shouldn't even be in the game they are just absolutely terrible and add no value to the game. Maps and green keys are also pretty horrendous. Sabotaging toolboxes are pretty useless. 
---
Did you completely close out your application and restart the game that way? I‚Äôm on PS4 as well as my friends. 
---
Damn, hope she sees this post
---
Not queen i really hope this concept goes live it would reduce the grind a lot and make the game more enjoyable!
---
What rank are you out of curiosity? At rank 1 I'd say I see it closer to 4/5 games. Only killers I usually don't run it on are Billy and Nurse, unless I don't have it for others or I'm using a specific build that doesn't have room for it. I wouldn't call it sweaty though, except maybe a Nurse running it.

# HE IS HERE
---
We all need this on a t-shirt
---
  &gt;just a hair early  
---
  
---
Of course, they think you're a potato and missed the check by a mile. 
---
That‚Äôs why I play killer lol
---
I was replying to your second point you fucking dolt.
---
Getting hit through pallets and from far over windows is not something I can control. It‚Äôs due to killer being host.
---
Bloodlust was added to deal with infinite‚Äôs and double pallets. Neither exist anymore with the exception of the games double pallet spawns so please, tell me why we still need bloodlust.
---
I just said that killers do often miss hits that they shouldn‚Äôt have. Way to pick and choose comments. 
---
I‚Äôm using the experience of myself, streamers, and people I‚Äôve talked with in the past. You are using your own experiences and acting as though that is the only thing that exists.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main you fucking breadstick. 
---
DS does take more skill than ruin, but so far on console every match I am matched up with a ranks 5+ higher than I am.
---
Pretty good job so far
---
His hitboxes are broken. A third of the time the chainsaw doesn‚Äôt work lmfao
---
I love this.
---
How so? Let me spell it out for you again.
---
Killers say camping is fine because the counter is to punish them by just doing gens. These same people then go on to complain about gen repair speed being too fast and how it needs to be slowed down.
---
Do you not see the contradiction here? Slowing repair speed nerfs the counter to camping. What part of this is nonsense? 
---
It just gets you to the 8k cap in the category faster.  It doesn't actually increase the number you can earn in a game.  
---
It wouldn't make sense for Leatherface to be using Grandpa's Blood because it's Grandpa. They all respected Grandpa. Change that to something like BBQ Special with the same effects.
---
Behavior can't use the phrase "the saw is family" because it used in parts 2 and 3 respectively and they don't have the rights to it. sadly. I would have loved to have seen a chrome chainsaw with the phrase emblazoned on it but they couldn't use it because of copyright. 
---
Good shit though. 
---
I agree with the bag 100% for trapper great idea.  Kindred would be too strong though 
---
Blood point economy is just another phrase for "how long does it keep the playerbase grinding"
---
Where did you get that I tried as hard as possible? I literally said that I played how I do every other game. And I normally don't tryhard. I used iridescent head because I'd never used it before and I wanted to see what it was like. And it's not like I'm a god Huntress. I'm fairly new to her
---
PERKS: 
---
1) Water Cooler Torture - Talk to a survivor about your weekend, freezes their movement when in dying state for for 10/15/20 seconds 
---
2) Who Ate My Lunch? - Pick survivors upside down and shake them, causing them to lose blood points (negates unhooking of  1/2/3 survivor(s) per game), in hopes of them dropping your lunch they stole from a chest
---
3) Call Out Sick - Once survivors finish gens, the gates won't open. ever. you're out sick, so they will just have to wait till your back tomorrow 
---
i moved from ow to dbd and i used to think that was an improvement and uhhhhhhhhh no
---
This is beautiful 
---
I‚Äôve never tried this perk in a build but looking more into it, it looks pretty decent! 
---
Nah just pay someone to kill your parents as they come out to back ally after watching movie.
---
I honestly don't think he has one.
---
I also just wanted to say that I appreciate your posts! 
---
I do love a bit of adrenaline 
---
It's shit, but honestly. 
---
Why trade in one bucket of shit for another bucket of shit, unless it's fresher shit.
---
What console?
---
Ah yeah! Thanks lol
---
Yep. I've had one bad survivor feed me most of the pallets with 5 gens left. What they don't ever realize is how much it hurts when you're 1 gen left and the pallets are all gone. Tbh only bad survivors instadrop pallets. Hitboxes and lag are bad, but you get so much more time out of a pallet by looping it a few times.
---
I hate going against Legion so much...literally anti-fun.  At this point I just play normally until I get spotted, and then I stop trying.  The only counterplay to a Legion (unless the killer is a complete newbie) is to not be seen at any point during the match.
---
On the plus side, mending right in front of a Legion and not bothering to run away seems to confuse them and about 60% of the time they just leave me alone lol
---
I usually just use resilience and just wait to heal until adrenaline kicks in 
---
I was going to suggest the exact same thing!
---
Ok now it‚Äôs working. I restarted and then played one as the killer. Thanks!
---
I‚Äôve just been tempbanned on ps4 for using the prestige glitch. Not a big deal, was expecting this. The ban is just for 2 days, so hopefully I‚Äôll be able to play again the day after tomorrow

How dare you play the game to win?
---
when you prestige adam and keep leveling your p3 claudette but it's been 30 webs and you haven't even seen pebble tier 1
---
What‚Äôs LF
---
I got DS 1 about thirteen times in a row while trying to get to Pebble 3. Bloodweb RNG is wack. 
---
Every time I mend they hit somebody right next to me and then hit me again. I don‚Äôt even get to have a thrill of a chase because they immediately just run off and don‚Äôt come back until I happen to be finished.
---
If they remove the hook vacuum then I want a perk better than Mad Grit for dealing with body blockers.
---
If you think it's just mine then lol
---
Anyway, have a good day. This is silly squabbling 
---
Actually that makes sense. Thanks. I have a high level Hag too so might try it. Presumably it works better without running Ruin so people don't immediately go looking for totems?
---
Yeah yeah but isn't there anything that they can do to have a steady frame rate?
---
If you're playing as infinite tier3 Myers. I remember one time Puppers ran an instantdown build (noed, make your choice, haunted ground and rancor) on him and he got into tier3 when both make your choice and haunted ground were activated lol My brother also encountered an infinite tier3 Myers before with noed and play with your food and he was fast af.
---
Console or PC? I need friends to play SWF with too.

How dare you insult sir William of the hills

I usually get a lobby in 5-10 mins.

*stealth Killers cry*
---
This is one of the stupidest comments I've heard. You want Huntress you have an irredescent head every other web? Huntress is a great killer with great add ons. Irredescent heads are free wins for huntress. 
---
I mean, Alert does basically the same thing. 
---
I took it for ya &lt;3
---
Thanks! I don‚Äôt blame killers for trying to get sacrifices of course, or survivors for trying to get shit done while I‚Äôm hooked, but the amount of toxic players during these events definitely goes up. Just refreshing to play a match like this.

Thank you.
---
For my fellow English people who hate these country lists:
---
It's United Kingdom.
---
DO IT
---
God I hate Haddonfield as every killer I play.
---
You're missing out us PC players with shit PCs üòî
---
I just had SurveyMonkey generate that list. I hope it worked okay 
---
One important point that new people don't think about a lot - it's okay to be hooked! You've got 3 lives if you get saved well, so don't see getting hooked as necessarily a bad thing - some chases you just can't win. Just focus on getting off, healed, and out.
---
Oh god it's not you, it's awful country list design. I have to spend ages figuring out whether it's England, Great Britain, United Kingdom or anything inbetween.
---
Also PUBG
---
For me it's the opposite. I'm rank like 14 as survivor. Permanently. But I'm rank one killer.
---
Great, today the progression is glitched for me again and a restart doesn't fix it this time.
---
gens with no ruin go by 30 seconds at red ranks. Ruin is a hex and is usually popped by 30 seconds of the game by good survivors and not clueless baby survivor like yourself. You need to learn how to loop or do something that isnt holding down m1 like a noob.
---
If survivors that are experienced are crying about dbd survivors balance, theyre literally just shit at the game and are entitled babies who think they should live every game and rely on shit like decisive,ad toolboxes and insta heals lmfao.
---
The game is balanced around brown and yellow ranks. There are perks like prove thyself and toolboxes in the game when gens literally pop instantly lmfao. Its there for kids who blow up gens and need the crutches which is okay, but red rank survivors using them and still crying? Yikes. Balanced around babies. 
---
If people are still trying to argue decisive strike is still balanced, it says a lot about the IQ of your typical high rank survivor only player.
---
This is also coming from a player with 700+ hours survivor and less than 200 on killer.
---
Oh and also you cant tell if a non obsession player is running ds silly survivor lol.
---
*laughs in Coxcombed Clapper and Blink - Soot Wraith* 
---
I ain‚Äôt gay but I need me a bubba pillow
---
&gt;  but killer being nearby can also be conveyed by flailing your arms with no perks required.
---
No one really knows that tho outside this sub. Not even really here.
---
I disagree that it's not much of a boost. Part of the balance is that the survivors don't have inherent knowledge of what is the most optimal action at any given time and it's pretty common for multiple people to show up at the hook rather than stick on a generator. A player worried about that can run Kindred.
---
Frankly, I just don't see why it needs to be base kit in general. There's no game play problem occurring that it would solve
---
Short answer.  Baby killers.  Also it sounds like you're a fellow console player lol.  I can tell based on your description if killer play.
---
Nothing you said is true.... I won a game yesterday as a level 1 Jake with no perks. 
---
And regardless of how well you do, most of the time you end with enough Bloodpoints to level up your character within at least 1 to 2 games. Maybe you‚Äôre just bad at the game, no offense. 
---
Legion is pretty boring. I get the BP and don't do but other people do
---
Its stupidly easy to pip
---
Ehhh what??? 
---
I fucking hate this game but I love it so soooooo much
---
There are a lot more killers that are more.fun than him. Nurse for the sweat, Myers for the jumps cares, bubba's basement, gen pull spirit. I seriously recommend trying a new main.
---
Idk, I think ranking up as a killer is too easy. Like, I don't belong at the rank I'm at, but I keep going up? It's kind of ridiculous.
---
Yes the higher you are the harder it get but it's still fairly doable. Still some survivor cant loop well even at rank 1. You need to tunnel just a little bit. Not like a douche but just to secure the first kill and snowball on it.  
---
You break the rules - he breaks your sanity and probably your A hole
---
I actually love bringing healing items/perks to the matches. I feel that the simple action of healing buys so much time for the survivors, and slows the game for the killer.
---
I know it's ok to be hooked, but it's kinda ironic that even though I like healing, most of the time I'm the one being healed xD
---
I play others I jus like legion
---
Respect none!
---
Ds is skill less, stop yourself silly survivor. You need to get downed as survivor to use it. What does it say about you? And what is so skillful about holding down a button to melt a gen?
---
I wonder if survivors are all.. Lol nevermind.
---
WHAT
---
Never said camping was fine. You said that gens should continue to be this fast (a survivor on the exact same skill level as the killer can loop them for 4 gens, ds the 5th and adren away). Gens are currently to fast, you guys just like it because "muh FrEe WiNs"
---
I took it for you. I'm interested in seeing the results.
---
Only reason I'm glad I play on console.. I forgot the nurse was even in this game.
---
How does NOED work with his power? Does it instadown even when in frenzy?
---
&gt; Like, I don't belong at the rank I'm at, but I keep going up?
---
Same. I hate it. 
---
I love happy ends like these
---
why i always use the offering. spawning determines how the game goes for me. i dont even try if its a leatherface within 3 feet of me. just take me to your basement. 
---
I agree, that if you want to take a gamble and get a stun or want to loop x number of times because of autism, that it's perfectly fine if you get hit for risking it.
---
No /S you dumb fuck. 
---
I'm thinking I'll post them sometime tomorrow depending on how much activity there is
---
I was just thinking the other day on how I like the lantern effect on Feng's qipao 
---
I would be happy with logwood dye and tar being baseline. People sleep on those but they aren't too powerful.
---
No, considering at high ranks I can also win as perkless/no add on killers as well. That doesn't mean you faced good players, since rank doesn't matter in this game. It's super easy to make R1.
---
Now, even if you do face good players, then yeah maybe you're good.
---
But 1 bloodweb in 2 matches? When I earned 30k BP? That's awful. It's grind. And the grind is not fun. 
---
Right? I spent a while last night de-ranking by playing envelopes for survivors and going AFK. I don't care about the event points, I already have the huntress event skin and I don't play survivor with bright red cosmetics.
---
&gt;When people are stupid and think Thana is a bad perk on Legion.
---
Thanatophobia at maximum effectiveness adds 12s to generators.
---
Why would you waste 32s or more self-caring MULTIPLE times throughout a match just to remove 3% from what already is an insignificant penalty?
---
Are you sure I am the stupid one? 
---
I swear some people I‚Äôve met go ballistic at the sight of anything under 60fps 
---
me playing any game 
---
Sweeeet.
---
I haven‚Äôt used bw in a while but it‚Äôs amazing when it procs 
---
You‚Äôve not made a single claim that it was anyone‚Äôs opinion but your own, so yes I think it‚Äôs just yours. 
---
When Mom's home and you forgot to do the dishes...
---
The black girl, Claudette I think. *( The one that has self healing )*
---
I saw a tutorial on the best survivors and they recommended her from a bunch of others since that perk is useful when you unlock it for the other survivors. 
---
No DLCs yet, even though I am tempted to buy the SAW one since it is one of my favorite franchises. But I would like to explore the game basics for a while before I spend any money on the game.
---
all I‚Äôm saying is nothing should be done about repair speed unless is put into place to stop camping. If you don‚Äôt agree, then it certainly implies that you think camping is ok.
---
If you need to tunnel and camp to get the 2 kills then maybe its possible you're just not good :/
---
Thanks man!
---
Im rank 1 rank doesnt matter past rank 10 anyway. Pipping is a joke. You can play like shit not kill anyone and still pip
---
Made the edits! &lt;3
---
...You cannot be serious. If you actually think that, then wow.
---
I try to!! But I do think that they do run faster than the survivor, since you mostly depend on jumping around windows and crouch walking around so that the killer doesn't spot you. That's like... the part I still need to work on.
---
Welcome to rank 1 don't worry half the survivors are shit anyway 
---
It's my microphone day today :D
---
I mean, it is fun, but joining in at this point when everyone has mastered building and loadouts makes it hard to like for new players.
---
I used to be like you... young, wide-eyed, full of hope, seeing all the posts and thinking it‚Äôll never happen to me. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but one day... the queue will come, and it will be ready and stronger than before. 
---
I like it, but I still feel like the rewards for prestiging a character should be reworked, as is the increase in rare drops isn't really notable like it should be to begin with.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs shitty. If I‚Äôm playing solo I will usually run Kindred.
---
Awesome night....mmmmhmmmm
---
Killers are indeed faster than survivors. The only exception is the nurse but that's because she can blink through terrain. Just keep playing and learning the maps. You'll get better :)
---
Nothing is better then losing all game, then getting one hook near the gates and snowballing that into a 4man.
---
This assumes that the connection to the dedicated servers will be better than your connection to the killer. Knowing how things go with BHVR, I expect dedicated servers to make things worse before they get better. 
---
I absolutely do, I'm sorry, your majesty.
---
I use my good old muscle memory for pretty much everything in this game, works great...most of the time 
---
At least for me, the worst one is the Bunny girl. *(The one that throws axes)*
---
I got a quest with her and used it but everyone escaped in no time xD
---
Also she is the easiest one for me to evade, probably because of her humming.
---
I‚Äôve done that to swf usually 
---
Couldn't help bot noticed... Ruin + Sloppy, to slow the game down just a little bit. 
---
Juicy shots tho. 
---
RAAAAAAA

Did a steamer piss you off and now you think all of them are shitty? Just because a couple of streamers are assholes doesn‚Äôt mean they all are.
---
As for my treatment of them, it depends on how they act in-game. If they‚Äôre trying to mimic OchiDO, then I‚Äôll kill them ASAP and show them no mercy. If they‚Äôre just trying to play the game, then I‚Äôll treat them like a normal Survivor. 
---
Don't worry about rank. Trust me, the most fun you are gonna have is rank 10-8, that's where you get the least amount of SWF ganksquads and general survivor bullshit but people act like they have half a brain.
---
Loving the game but not playing it because you live in the middle of south America and never get less than 150 ms
---
Yeah I thought that might be a problem
---
 Ah well maybe I can spare myself some cancer and just uninstall.
---
Claudette is definitely the best choice for starting out. The game is fine without the DLCs, but they're all worth it - they each add a unique killer and survivor, and let you get unique perks from each killer/survivor. 
---
If you ever want to play some, PM me. I've played for a while and would love to help introduce you to some of the more complex mechanics and concepts.
---
I don't like body pillows simply because they always take a stronk woman like huntress and make her small. Or they put HillBilly in a dress?? Idk
---
I accidentally hit iceland instead of Ireland just to let you know 
---
Yeah, but nobody uses Alert. Anyone who wants to cut down on the grind of the game uses WGLF and BBQ, so giving essentially the whole playerbase Killer aura readings would severely impact that Insidious Leatherface camping the hook behind a tree.
---
Why would you taunt if no one can see you. 
---
You can try the deathmatch mode that has respawns and is meant for casual players,then try to move into the regular mode if you feel comfortable.
---
Part 2 is referenced to ingame, actually.
---
* The real names of Leatherface, The Hitchhiker and The Cook (Bubba Sawyer, Nubbins Sawyer and Drayton Sawyer respectively) are used in Leatherface's perk descriptions. The real names are not revealed until Part 2.
---
* The quotes from Chili and Award-Winning Chili use quotes from Drayton in Part 2. In addition, the name of the latter references the plot point of Part 2 that Drayton sells human-meat chili to the public and wins a interstate competition twice in a row for it.
---
I mean she is lowest risk killer in the game. That almost always goes hand to hand with being most powerful - the more powerful the character is, the more mistakes you can make and still win.
---
Looking forward to seeing the killer results
---
I'm with you on the core gameplay loop. Being chased (and chasing) is really fun. It has a lot of potential to outplay and mind game and a high skill cap.
---
That's not the only thing that's kept me playing, though: It's the grind. I want to unlock all the characters and all the perks. After playing for 2+ years, I *still* haven't unlocked everything that I can. (I'm trying to F2P most of it.) And they keep releasing more! Those damn devs have weaponized the mobile freemium strategy against us.
---
I shook my head out of disappointment 
---
*cough* Legion *cough*
---
Are you new to online games? Pvp games?
---
It's really not as dire as you make it sound.  I didn't use a single offering and got 3 coins in a couple hours, only actually escaped with the lantern maybe 4 times.
---
&gt;survivors are grabbing them right away despite not even getting blood for it
---
Unless something changed recently, you do get BP for holding the lantern, something like 500 BP every minute you hold onto it.  I also haven't seen people not being cooperative since finishing gens means everyone gets points. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Ah I see 
---
"Fuck this game. I would've thrown down that pallet if the fucking game wasn't lagging so hard. And of course my idiot teammates yank me off the hook instantly so I just get fucked again. Oh well, not like I would've gotten any BP anyway in this insufferable grind of a game."
---
... I think to myself as I queue for another lobby.
---
It may be server lag when the game is registering the the pallet stun. But think about it, this stuff happens far less often in actual chases. I'm also not complaining about getting hit and THEN getting the stun (sorry I know it was confusing). I'm talking about landing the stun on a lunge that- even if not thrown- would have been short- and then falling over while safely on the other side of the pallet. 
---
I have played killer so often and at least 4 times a game I say out loud to myself "I did not land that hit" on pallet swings but the game just hands it to me on a silver platter. 
---
My ping limit is 180. Anything over that and I won't want to play. My average ping is around 100 for my opponents. Would going lower really make that much more of a difference?
---
Every game I play at this point
---
Clearly because he doesn't know how to turne the camera around
---
Honestly i would completely understand their decision. Given that by "not palletloop once" means that you drop pallets without dragging the killers time, by "evading" meaning you went to shit behind a tree instead of doing your gen every time a glimpse of heartbeat occured, and knowing the type - not risking anything for your teammates. Included in that stereotype is also the assumption that you would already be long out the door if you saw one of your teammates getting downed after exits were up. 
---
I always get off the gen to point at them and pretty often it blows up when I do
---
TOO BAD!!!
---
Just a little bit ^^
---
Fortnite exists too
---
I think you get the point only if you brned the offering.
---
I'm a killer main, I already said that. My reasoning for saying that is DS requires a skill check, ruin doesn't.
---
The nurse is hands down miles better than Billy with no perks/add ons the nurse is still way better than a full geared Billy 
---
Camping is a problem but so is repair speed. There are solutions to camping, breakdown, bt, looping because you cant stop a survivor from looping you for 3 gens. But guess what? Theres nothing to stop survivors from getting every gen done before first down. You guys act like this is an issue so killers can get a nerf. 
---
And if you think me thinking gens are too fast mean i think camping is ok, that's blatantly untrue. Someone can loop you for 4 gens, ds and adren to get away and IM wrong for thinking gens are too fast?
---
You guys never think of the other side. If you cant deal with a killer you call it broken and ask for a nerf/ buff to yourself. And the devs listen.
---
Sorry that this is 8 days late.. But it is likely just a creative choice. They were all taken in at the same time its likely they became soul-tied in some way. Its possible this can be a small tie like everytime a member looks into a mirror they see other members or it can be a strong tie where they are all the same. Its possible I just think the entity would take advantage of having 4 of the same killer in 4 different trials
---
You only get bp if you brought an offering
---
Because you are the enemy of the people
---
But for real legion has no counter play and is 0 fun to play against
---
Evolve ironically had way better balance and was arguably more fun than DBD. If it wasn't so horribly mismanaged and now dead, I probably never would have known DBD existed. I respected good hunters because they took the time to learn their characters, their roles, and my own weakness. Each different Hunter was unique, just as the monsters were. On DBD? Survivors are just skins separated by teachable perks. The skill ceiling of this game (barring nurse and effective looping) is low as fuck too.
---
Sigh. But it's the only asymmetrical game I have that isn't Last Year, and that game has it's own issues.
---
The dress is beautiful but this doesn't look much like feng min lol. The hair (red) and face (she's Chinese) are wrong. 
---
Aah that makes sense.
---
You can hit a survivor while he's downing the palet, this is just stupid.
---
&gt;I mean she is lowest risk killer in the game
---
Ok im done
---
It's so true...
---
I had something similar but instead our teammate was running up a hill to unhook me and the moment she sees a hag trap pop out of the floor (she sprinted up) she opens the hatch to the left of my hook and leaves me
---
Proud OINK
---
Amanda best gril ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Consider yourself lucky, there are normally loads of them.
---
If you see one just make sure you're not the first guy on the hook.
---
¬§#"tgsdfaeg scg,h
---
Show me one message in which you‚Äôve said that these experiences belong to anyone other than yourself. I implore you to do so. 
---
Have you read my comment? If the hitbox stays back on the window frame, hits like these should appear. This was actually a problem with Medium Vaults when they got introduced so it might be fucked up for all vaults by now (wouldn't surprise me in this game at least). 
---
It doesn't necessarily has to do with latency. And if it is not a latency problem, dedicated servers will not help. 
---
Even in all hiragana, this is still wrong lmao
---
Multiple levels 
---
Hell yeah she is. Just finished a game where I rekt a surviour so hard he just messaged me saying he would ran out the gate with the trap on. I said okay he waited there for 5min and then ran out.
---
Downing a palet has always extended your hitbox, it has always been there. And for the second clip, the window acts like any other window, if it wasn't a window that makes you fall, the survivor would have been hit and it wouldn't have looked weird. It's just that the window interact in the same way as any other window.

The.... Correct side.... Of your weapon.... Excuse me but what? How often have you lunged out with a weapon and, through some form of space-time fuckery, warped your hand 180 degrees around, hitting them with the blunt side of your weapon (which would still hurt, with enough force) instead of hitting them with the bladed side (assuming this isn't simply a blunt weapon, like a sledgehammer, in which case "the correct side" has no real bearing.)?

---
This is why I‚Äôm rooting for the entity 
---
Was that last night? I just did that to someone last night lol. I think they thought they could crawl out in time, but I had a full stack of "Save the best for last", so pretty much immediately was able to pick them up. 
---
every new coin you get its 100 more points to get another coin
---
Discordance should have a limited range like Spies and Nurse's. Change my mind.
---
But to you it's not a joke either. So I don't think that you get the joke anyway.
---
*chunky Myers 
---
It's cause you played legion 
---
i never use noed, it rarely gets to endgame anyway (no, i don't use franks) 
---
Maybe if you remembered that the Killers don't have 11ft wingspans
---
Well, obviously! :) But why DBD of all games??
---
&gt;Mori
---
Ya, but it was my first one. I'm pretty new and was like, "Eh, to hell with it, let's go."
---
Errmmm... where are you getting 39k from?
---
The forst coin costs 100 points, with each subsequent coin costing 100 more.
---
100+200+300+400+500+600+700+800+900 = 4,500 (4.5k) points.
---
In before someone says something about it just being latency.
---
This was the beginning of the match, he was the first person I found as you can see from the 5 gens still being up :P
---
Chad hillbilly: 2nd best killer
---
Virgin cannibal: literally only played for BBQ or by facecampers
---
I do it on console.  I'm not saying you're gonna hit every one but as long as you aren't flat out missing skill checks entirely it isn't too bad to work through man.
---
Rancor just gives you a notification of all survivors' current location, as if they had made a loud noise. It's good not as strong as seeing auras. 
---
Who gives a fuck. We still got two weeks and some people already got them all
---
I started a whole ass portrait and got a good chunk of it done the other night- I think I had like a match an hour the wait times were so bad. But that drawing wasn‚Äôt dbd related so I don‚Äôt wanna post it lol
---
Howdy üî´ü§†üëå
---
console plebs when will they learn
---
Couldn‚Äôt handle the mind games
---
I drew him! I‚Äôll post an update later on 
---
I mean they are ideas. Not very good ones, but ideas.
---
I grinded out the 3 coins for my Huntress outfit it wasn't too bad, but the increase each coin makes getting the rest worth it. This grind only exists to create a wall in which people have to choose to spend money on the game or play a pretty large amount. I don't mind some special cosmetics being AC only because I like to support the game so they can keep giving us new killers, but they ruined this event for money. Defacing the spirit of The Pig.
---
Takes quite a while to learn escape routes, especially since it‚Äôs harder than it was before. Even making chases last longer takes practice. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it.
---
Watch a few streamers and see the routes they take, and try them for yourself.
---
Why would i lose to win 10 games when i could just wait and win 11 games? You have loser way of thinking. You can say i lost all you want but in reality i won and ur triggered :)
---
yes and no
---
Just play legion then it‚Äôs literally impossible to depip unless you have no arms
---
thank god you censored all the bad words on my good christian meme.
---
To be honest, this was the best cosmetic in Dead by Daylight. The huntress one was kinda "meh," and I outright hate the Ace cosmetic.
---
Looks like a survivor main trying to make killer perks lol
---
If you do this I assume you want my full attention as killer and I will gladly give it to you.
---
It is personal, it takes long to practice and learn everything... just watch streamers and youtubers. I recommend Noob3 (or something like that) and Monto :) and just watch, practice and die for Entity. I can't really help you much more with this problem
---
You know how to loop, presumably guessing you conserve and never waste pallets, and don't play toxic or BM.  You sound like exactly the type of survivor I like to play with soooooo many potatoes in this game.  I play on PS4 usually in a 2 man with same dude who can also play well or I'm solo.  If you're looking to squad up feel free to add me on PS4.  Username is Weirdodin.  We make nice plays 
---
Let's also make the last attack actually do damage.
---
Much as I like you're flair this is a retarded comment 
---
It takes practice to get the timing. At least, it doesn't take off when it tops like Billy.
---
Liked old version more, but I kinda understand that bhvr wouldn‚Äôt want to give us that much IS, of course. Either way it‚Äôs better than how things are now. Especially 3perks per web and rank reward. As a relatively new player I must say, the grind is real. I managed to grind and lvl survivors, but when I think about doing it AGAIN with killers...uugh, it‚Äôs the only thing that keeps me from playing as a killer honestly. 
---
I had one yesterday. Meat Factory and a Huntress. All of us spawn in the same spot. The camera stops spinning and immediately start hearing the lullaby. 3 teammates all take off running, I pause for a second and go, she will absolutely go after them now, nope she peaks around a corner and I get a hatchet to the face. I literally took zero steps and crouched behind a van and she was just a magnet for me.  I got hooked and just let myself die, I was so salty after that one. 
---
You're really fucking dumb. I said that you could win 10 games instead of waiting 2 hours to win one. Also, you're*
---
Not legion
---
done
---
I had the same problem when I was playing, got to high ranks too quickly then started getting destroyed easily, you said you‚Äôve watched videos but what I did was watch specific videos on loops. Watch videos that teach you to use the Killer shack, T-Walls and L-Walls because they don‚Äôt change from map to map. There will always be a killer shack and the T/L- Walls on every map bar just a few. Once I learned the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of looping them it became at loot easier for me. Other than that it‚Äôs just practice and hours.
---
Hopefully that helps 
---
same
---
30 fps isn't bad
---
My FPS plummets when I play Doctor for some reason. It‚Äôs a shame because he‚Äôs one of my favorite killers.
---
Survivors definitely 3 genned themselves which is their fault.  That being said I have played your doctor game before where they literally refuse to chase a single person even after getting a hit and will instead simply stand at the gens in treatment to keep everyone perpetually in tier 3 and drag out the game indefinitely until survivors literally suicide themselves at your feet to get the 20 minute cheese fest to end.  It really is quite obnoxious playstyle depending on how hard you turtled the game.  Regardless they are ordinarily to blame because they did it to themselves.
---
Good thing I‚Äôm trash lol. Thanks for the feedback man.
---
SWF especially between ranks 1-8 are toxic as hell, also if they were hitting you with insta heals 3 DS‚Äôs, and gen rushes you do not need to apologize to them and you certainly don‚Äôt have to gift them the hatch. My only tips would be either dodge a swf if you don‚Äôt feel confident going against them or to pick a new killer like hillbilly or clown because doc gets bullied pretty easily even by people who aren‚Äôt SWF especially at purple to red ranks. I hope this helps and I‚Äôm glad you did well against a well organized SWF.
---
Just practice how many seconds before you need to hit the button to hit greats. My TV has a lot of input lag but i still can hit greats consistently 
---
I can stop a noed from doing anything all. I haven‚Äôt seen it activate in over a week cuz we actually destroy totems. Sure my games last a little longer then 5 minutes but  not complaining. At least DS is in my control. The killer can‚Äôt stop us from taking his perks away
---
No, that‚Äôs gay
---
What did poor susie ever do to you
---
Oh I understand what you mean but if you look at the points I gained after I hit him, the chase and hit bat go up the exact same as they were previously empty due to him being my first encounter :p
---
No because I‚Äôm not a cunt to people trying to stream for fun 
---
Howdy! &gt; GG
---
Cosmetics are just a cheap tactic of making poor optimized games stronger.
---
Well i think he is still bugged, leatherface that is.  Does his chainsaw stop making noise when its fully charge?
---
Posts like this make me sad. We've all been there. And I'm not talking about getting blocked. I'm talking about being the blocker. Assuming it was an accident, it was an accident! I know when I've blocked someone by mistake I feel terrible about it. Now have it posted online so dozens of other ppl can call you a moron. Sucks you got blocked, but I feel worse for the Jake at this point. 
---
What has that to do with my comment? lol
---
OH NO
---
You got me ;) /s
---
Bond, dead hard, adrenaline, well make it/borrowed time
---
You can find teammates to heal you/coop with, dead hards the funnest exhaustion perk, adrenaline for those occasional wow moments and we'll make it is super underrated and borrowed time for exit gate campers 
---
Oh, my bad, meant to hit comment not reply. Mobile struggles. (Also was was a reference, just so you don't think I was being a dick lol)
---
Ahh fuck em. Don‚Äôt let cunts get ya down. Also as scummy as it is SWF will kill themselves on hook or just dc to give their buddy the hatch. Here‚Äôs hoping that the next time you face em you got a mori waiting.
---
Even with good ping this happens
---
Noed is only reliable to counter with a 4 man, has unlimited uses vs 1 of ds, and is good on shit and skilled killers while ds only does anything on good survivors 
---
Make the game unplayably frustrating 
---
There are some great vids on how to run jungle gyms and such. Ohtofu and king do really good ones
---
BBQ won't go off for many reasons. If you're higher rank it's unlikely that it means someone is nearby and it's much more likely they're in a locker or hiding behind a gen.
---
I'd recommend watching better streamers lol i love monto and puppers but their pathing is usually garbo.
---
Oh true, just wondering why it was posted only now
---
I always do a double crouch sorry if I mess up in a rare occurrence, usually by Huntress Lullaby or Madness II
---
Likewise, in any other situation where the above two example need not apply, when a survivor misses the check I‚Äôll just stand up and stare at them while the progression meter is frozen in disapproval
---
Not using survivor power of telepathy is done by choice. Can‚Äôt hold it against the killer cuz some folks don‚Äôt wanna play optimally. Killer doesn‚Äôt have a counter for comms
---
Xbox
---
I‚Äôll give him credit for hitting both, but he threw at a gen, very likely someone is sitting there, but pretty damn good
---
Definitely the worst event ever. They honestly didn‚Äôt think this through.  I can‚Äôt wait for feedback. I‚Äôve got a lot on my mind 
---
It would actually blow my mind if someone got a character to p3 and they missed more than 1 skill check. By that point you should have done enough skill checks to not get stressed by them. 
---
Lol I already got all 3 outfits this event surprisingly didn‚Äôt bug out for me at all.
---
Survivors dont deserve fair game, so dont show them any. 
---
Ehh a good few of of the perks are neat, a good quarter or more of them are useless though. The killers usually cycle through the same ten perks and the survivors have a bit more variety with exhaustion perks and the like. The game has a good UI. The bloodweb is cool although I hate how expensive it is for the survivors. I think the game is just frustrating in a lot of aspects, and that's what hooks you on it. 
---
Oh I don‚Äôt usually use reddit, I think the reason I installed it was to view r/DeadByDaylight but I just started posting recently so I wouldn‚Äôt use it to post back then
---
I had this idea that maybe for the first time you reach rank 1 you get a cosmetic face or something that can be equipped on any character and after that, each season you get shards and bloodpoints
---
Awesome! I will definitely do!
---
doing gens, you?
---
yeah, in the top ranks gens are done in a crazy short time - the record time i have seen 5 gens done is 4 minutes 8 seconds against a nurse that did hook two times in that time without ruin - its just insanely crazy
---
Tbh the only set I wanted was the Feng one anyhow, the Ace one looks meh and the huntress one is nothing compared to evil Halloween bunny :)
---
**Rule 3** - Shaming other players.
---
* Censor all usernames for posts and screenshots or video featuring other players in a negative light.
---
1. Next to your name it says legion main
---
2. Learn to counter 
---
So... Do the Killers have to escape the Survivor or.. Do they still have to do gens?
---
Good now I can have a gun to shoot myself when I miss my DS
---
I play more trapper and wraith than anybody at rank 1 and face swf all the time.  It can absolutely be done without nurse.
---
Puppers usually takes loops casually but if it‚Äôs a tunneler or camper he‚Äôll break their ankles for 5 whole gens. Monto can keep a good chase but sometimes he‚Äôs a lil boosted. 
---
When you don't even read the ultra rare descriptions
---
Im a survivor main so I have only done moris for the spirit and the hag and the moris are third person for both ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Hahahaha, whatever you say 
---
When you spawn in the middle of the street in haddonfield and hear Billy's chainsaw start up right away.
---
Gens start off done. Killers gotta break all the gens, but their break is slower, and the survivors repair is faster.
---
Are perks buffed?
---
It's because it's a great idea in the hands of incompetent morons that own the IP. 
---
Hahahaha, you did nothing wrong SWF has an inherent advantage (ignore people saying otherwise) as the simple advantage of voice comms easily replaces several perks a solo survivor would benefit from. If they 3 gen themseleves thats on them for not paying attention. People just have to accept you win some you lose some. The nature of the game is for the killer to kill in any way they deem necessary. And for survivors to survive anyway necessary. Ignore made up rules on both sides and play how you want and in whatever way is enjoyable for you.
---
Probably Yoshikage Kira's cousin or something
---
A great idea in the hands of Incompetent morons.
---
Insta down perks are barred, everything else is normal.
---
What program? I wanna learn this stuff so bad!
---
How much ammo does the survivor get?
---
You would wait 2 hours to win once, then you would win 10 more times. If you just hit him you could've won 20 games instead of 11. And geez, fix your grammar. 
---
There's almost always someone using DS so the obsession marker shouldn't be a dead giveaway 
---
If someone lets themselves die right away on the first hook, just report them. That's what I do. 
---
This is the only comment I needed to read. 
---
gods work
---
I was just saying what the description says
---
I looped a Hag last night for like 5 minutes. My team got one gen done. I was then insidious facecamped to death. I was salty. 
---
Have you not seen puppers put his sweat pants on? Dude plays the game for fun, but when he wants he'll run circles for 5 gens and still escape. As far as monto goes the dude will do goofy gimmick builds and still wreck on both sides though he definitely seems like a better killer than survivor.
---
Sweet thanks bro, us 3 remaining survivors will definitely get 5 gens done now. 
---
god i cannot wait to buy one of these
---
2 clips, and the item add-ons can add more clips. All add-ons are now different guns
---
Is it a reportable offence though?
---
Yea, I could never hit those hits :D
---
u/not_Queen_bhvr thoughts?
---
No, gen rushing would be way too much to handle. 
---
&gt; see the routes they take
---
Is memorizing routes really the only viable way to get through a chase?  It seems...unfun.
---
That's not what I meant though. You'll see the dying light icon if you're the obsession affected by the dying light. Never noticed it? It's in the same spot if you're affected by leader or prove thyself etc.
---
The game is fine, the developers are cancer.
---
Exactly. Fuck the derankers. 
---
&gt;If I'm the first target my chances at fat points is almost zero
---
So in other words, you're trash. 
---
By that I mean you should get to know tiles more and how to use them when their generated next to certain other tiles
---
But killer only hears this when the pebble hits floor cca 25 meters around him
---
Keep em coming! Some interesting stuff in there
---
&gt; - To get the other two sets it costs a total of 39K event points.
---
OP already got the first 3 coins (600pts). 
---
You are aware this is a TEAM game, yes? Just because they're not your actual friends or you can't speak with them doesn't mean you shouldn't work in their best interest.
---
Yeah my first time playing was fun until I got to that rank then it was very difficult with all the cry babies but then I learned how to play nurse

I don't have any problem winning with leatherface. The problem i have is the UI feels like shit with no feedback, and with how they have changed killers in the past to feel better to play (Trapper, Wraith, Hag) I think it is Leatherface's turn.
---
I honestly hate this game more than I hate myself and I still play basically everyday. I think it's because I'm holding out for a day when every problem gets magically fixed, frame rate stabilizes and dedicated servers rock up and i'll be able to play with stuff unlocked when that day comes.
---
What Processor do you have? I got a 1060 and get 135-144 FPS
---
No apology needed, even super shitty memes like this get tons of upvotes from dummies 
---
I love how the one thing all of the DbD community can agree on is that the game is a bit wank.
---
Ok
---
You wait to win that ONE round, and then you maybe win ten. But while you were waiting to win that ONE round, you could've done TEN or so in the same amount of time. And please, for the love of God, don't use fucking emojis. 
---
This is just god awful advice and only further widens the tribal divide between killers and survivors.

---
But we all don't have the power to do them
---
Getting camped? Looks like it's rootin tootin shootin time‚Ñ¢
---
I don‚Äôt see anyone
---
We don't want gens to be done in 15 seconds. I don't think that is too much to ask.
---
The best way to learn how to loop as survivor, is to play killer, and see how you try to catch them and how survivors loop you. 
---
Step 1. Play on PC
---
Step 2. Refer to step 1
---
A teammate sandbagged me by standing on a pallet so i couldn't drop it, they then proceeded to get hit twice while i was on the killer's shoulder
---
maybe get chased? doing gens makes the game go really fast, and you get less points when the game goes in an instant.
---
You know what would be funny? 
---
Some kind of telepathic killer that could let the survivors see a "phantom gen". 
---
Like, you think you are working on a gen with skill checks and everything but you are literally just crouching in the air. Once you complete the "phantom gen" it disappears. 
---
That way it would be a less of a "rush" and, yes, the survivors would be kind of just standing around waiting to be hooked. 
---
I enjoy messing around with Nurse but my favorite to play and easiest to get kills with is no-doubt the Clown.  On a good day I can get survivors with bottles in places they can't tell. they could be on the other side of a 2-T's looping spot and a bottle just creeps over the wall and lands on them. I've had people admit that my bottles are scary,
---
p.s cork topper and fingerless gloves op.
---
Well obviously, most people on this sub don't like legion because he breaks the fundemental game mechanics. 
---
You want to hear true horror? Playing as nurse, four brand new parts (pre-patch). Game was over in less than 3 minutes. I had Ruin up the whole game too.
---
I work in a data center and lemme tell you whenever I‚Äôm in there by myself in the morning disarming the alarms I get kind of spooked like someone‚Äôs watching me and is like watching me from in between the rows of servers so your idea makes me never wanna go back to work thanks 
---
literally...
---
It's because once you play at high FPS for so long, anything under 60 genuinely looks laggy.
---
where are my manners?  Howdy!
---
If you let go and its ~2 min into the match they watch for that. They say they have "backend analytics" that looks for that kind of stuff from those reports. 
---
Thats extremely weird.
---
That would be kind of broken, also spies is only useful if the others don't know you're bringing it. The buff for spies is good but its still not enough since calm spirit and bad crow spawns exists.
---
Lol, that really sucks. I can hear the psycho theme playing but instead of it being for the killer, its for the survivors
---
Oh right, killers just want to kumbaya with survivors. How could I forget? 
---
Killer starts dodging anytime 4 tapps show up in lobby. 
---
Killer trying to tunnel someone with 3 teammates chasing behind. 
---
NOED lights up *sounds of guns being loaded* killer running away.
---
Boom Boom Croissant.
---
Prove thyself is baseline for survivors. Lol the shame you fill when the other survivor looks at you then points to go away.
---
if they reduced the range and made it base kit that would be fine imo.  Its just such a useless perk compared to other tracking perks like BBQ, Discordance etc.
---
For me it's only Huntresses and Legions. 90% of the games I am getting are againts a huntress or a legion,10% is spirit.
---
If you don't get hired for modelling, I won't even know what to do.
---
WHO FUCKING CARES IF I COULD HAVE WON 10 MORE I could win 100 more and i still would have stayed LMAO It doesn't matter if you can win more it matters that you don't lose. You can win 10 but you lost the 1 on the other hand you win 1 but you didn't lose. Like im not a fucking loser like if you want to be a loser then go ahead stop fuckimg complaining on reddit like a bitch i don't care and nobody else does lol
---
I‚Äôd be fine with it. Maybe it would make the match last a little long since I have to actually acknowledge the birds exist
---
Both
---
Bro. I don't know what game you're playing but this isn't the My Little Pony game, this is PvP with consistently ruthless player killers. The sooner new players understand what they're in for, the sooner thru can accept it and move forward. 
---
For most players, there's never gonna be a time where a magic switch flips and you start escaping every single match.
---
It's fucking awful
---
But I need to play it
---
No, it throws the pebble 25 meters away from you
---
Yeah I wouldn't call that holding the game hostage. Not your fault that they didn't think out what gens to do.
---
If the last few gens are right next to each other what are you supposed to do, let them finish?
---
Good job.
---
They seem to focus on making it worse, not better. 
---
Yeah - spurts of bonus BP for hooking survivors and smashing vessels. I'm not sure the exact value since I've been doing the event as surv, who gets 1000 for picking up vessel, 500 every once and awhile for holding onto it, and 5k for escaping with it
---
I don't, I think she's trash at her job, ugly and a shit personality
---
People don't like the fact the legion forces people to play smarter rather than just running to the nearest pallet then dropping it and sit around it sad times all around if you don't adapt you get the stab plain and simple
---
He is in my opinion the most slept on killer in the game. He punishes mistakes so hard because often he can substitute a hit for an instadown. His power just feels unfinished to use with the cut-off audio and the lack of a proper indicator for when you let go, not to mention when you do let go it COMPLETELY drops the charge and slows you.
---
Great Job!
---
Heeheehee. Worst play was also one of my favorite games. I just got bubba and was still learning his chainsaw. Needless to say the 4 man swf was bullying me. I was new to the character so I wasn't totally annoyed but it still sucked. They were down to two gens when I finally downed someone. Fortunately for me I happened to be right next to the basement at the killer shack. After hooking the unfortunate souls I started heading out to try and hook someone else.
---
And guess what Happened???
---
All 3 of those altruistic assholes come running into the back of the shack to save their buddy. 
---
I promptly chainsawed all of them in the basement, including their just unhooked friend and win the match. Thats the only time I've gotten all four basement hooks at the same time. 
---
This was followed by salty survivor messages as if I was responsible for their stupidity. 
---
I used their tears to rim the glass of my rum and coke
---
I'm not really sure. I've had matches where I've only killed one survivor and gotten a pip up.
---
I hope you realise people do dodge lobbies for reasons other than those you think to stroke your own ego
---
Keep trying, I know you'll get it
---
Can't feel stressed at the prospect of DS if you don't pick them up! 
---
I just want a bloody, gruesome prison like Mob of the Dead
---
Imagine complaining about ruin instead of just powering through it.
---
an easier way is to simply speak the truth about balance.
---
its because the event is survivor sided so of course more people are gonna play survivor

Could always be a shout to try and play kfy (that's if enough of your friends have the game), this is how I started out playing.

Played plenty of kyf before I actually went in a played solo.

That must be what heroin is like
---
It says the survey is closed 
---
the video doesn't load for me can someone explain pls? I main clown but haven't played for a couple months (computer ded af)
---
Compairng Leatherface to Billy isn't exactly fair. Their powers do completely different things. Billy has great mobility, and an unreliable instadown, while Leatherface's power is more about punishing bad moves. It's like comparing Huntress and Clown.
---
It‚Äôs a glitch that made me hit him across the map. It‚Äôs a joke that his range has got buffed.
---
why are there even ‚Äúsides‚Äù of the community? How di people only play one side of the game? Feels like it would get old quick
---
Ruin is only useful when it lasts more than a minute, otherwise, it's usually a waste of a perk slot
---
Are you the guy that reposts memes a month after they died? The Meme Necromancer?
---
 What a boulder
---
report for taking the game hostage, those type of players should be banned
---
What about the add on?
---
I just thought of somethinf, does this is not happening increase the DS skillcheck size? 
---
Got PS4 pro recently, and the frames are definitely better than they were on my old PS4.
---
...and?
---
I have seen mostly michaels and leather faces for some odd reason 
---
You think she‚Äôs gunna answer your question when you just called her a shit developer and ugly? Please learn respect 
---
The point isn't "Oh no, the completion of generators", the point is "Oh no, the completion of 3 generators almost simultaneously taking me to the end game while I was in this chase!!"
---
At least I don't DC (I never DC, actually) but I'm rank 16 and have survived against the rank 15-20 Legions. + I had a fun game against a Susie recently.
---
It sounds like a different situation for more experienced players.
---
Wait, how‚Äôd you lose progress if you don‚Äôt own the game?
---
Oh my..
---
Big yeets
---
No. Just no. It‚Äôs also the game that‚Äôs gonna ‚Äúkill DBD‚Äù
---
It's still in the hot section and even has a bhvr response soo
---
Good point. Maybe after successfully hitting the first skill check you can then see the killer‚Äôs aura while still on the generator, but if you get off you would need to hit the first skill check again to see the aura again.
---
Bubba OP get reported!
---
Ah! I see now, my apologies for the misunderstanding. Think this could for sure have some interesting impacts on a game!
---
Its very easy to fall into an "us versus them" mentality in this game because most people prefer one side over the other. I, for example, haven't played survivor since huntress came out. It's just boring to me.
---
A lot of the toxicity comes from the people who play SWF, as it is easy to gang up and bully people who are playing solo or killer, and the fact the game is horribly balanced. It's hard to think highly of the other side when you get hit with some grade-A bullshit, or get flamed for using the best strategies at your disposal.
---
Another big thing is this game is *so close* to being good, but the devs are so fucking incompetent at times its a wonder they made a (mostly) working game to begin with. Every good step forwards there are 3 steps back, and it is frustrating.
---
Truthfully I don't have fun with this game. It isn't competitively viable, and there is no casual mode. The only reason I play anymore is to make survivors mad and get salty comments on my profile.
---
He‚Äôs saying the coins aren‚Äôt adding on at the end of games
---
This happened to me about two minutes ago. I looped a trapper around the kindergarten for the total of 4 1/2 gens (no ds anything, I was running a gen rush build like the proud Dwight I am). Then he hooked me, and face camped me with three traps and No ed. The chase was really fun though. 
---
As Billy I hooked a skilled P3 Claudette in the basement and when I came out saw scratch marks EVERYWHERE!! Not seeing anyone near the shack I go check them basement lockers and get one survivor. After hooking another slow exits the one in my LOS, hook her, and the last one does the same.
---
Post game the P3 Claudette says "All three of you.....   Kill yourselves." And ggs me.
---
As I said, we played on the free weekend.
---
I'll admit that I was quite happy to see how F13 turned out just to spite the idiots claiming DBD would die because of it.
---
Apparently, killers haven't heard of adapting like survivors had to with shitty insertion of slow vaults but I guess BHVR isn't willing to stick to its guns on an impactful change that might negatively affect killers for a while but is good for the game as a whole
---
Legion requires no skill to play and has no counter play. You literally can‚Äôt avoid getting hit if he‚Äôs on your butt. You can 360 him 2-3 times in a row and still get hit since he can swing multiple times like old machine gun build. He also isn‚Äôt fun because everyone loves mending 5+ times.
---
One can insta down one person the other can insta down multiple people in the same time frame. 
---
Check. Meet Mate. 
---
I only really know this because I‚Äôve played with this spirit before!
---
Cry some more
---
Not bad but I can do better. Legion is balanced and I like to run NOED and unrelenting on Legion along with Franks mixtape and stab wound study.
---
Typical response from someone who wants to get a rise out of someone. You are looking for a response. Watch any video from 2.5 ptb from "pro streamers" and you'll see the problem. P3 spirit at reds every season. There are plenty of killers whom have this problem, its not me. 
---
And btw, i play survivor too, im not good and still its easy to get 3 gen loops.
---
Well with a small sample size other than for fun it isn‚Äôt even close to a representative amount of the playerbase.
---
All the people that trash the game need to actually stop playing. They ruin the experience too much.
---
Looks like you were bamboozled
---
It's sad that there is a divide, and I don't see much reason for it either to be honest. It's kinda annoying. 
---
Yes, the game can be annoying as a killer - I've hit people and it just hasn't counted, I've had 3ks and still de-pipped, but I've also faced similar bullshit as a survivor. This "us vs them" mentality just perpetuates the toxicity to newer players and just degrades the community further, which honestly saddens me as as you said - the game is that close to goodness, and the community is a large factor of "goodness".
---
Based on the comments I'm seeing here, people are simply using SB wrong. If you're using SB and find yourself walking around everywhere trying to save your SB, then you're wasting it. The whole point of the perk is to use it as much as possible. The only time you should really be charging it is while doing gens/totems/chests or hiding from the killer. There are a few situations where you might elect to save it, but for the most part, you shouldn't be afraid to "waste" your sprint burst. That being said, I don't use that perk anymore either, but only because it doesn't match my play style. 
---
When your idea is so good it gets not only a positive developer reply but confirmation the others will see it. OP you are a got damn gentleman/lady and most definitely a Scholar Of our time. 
---
Yea I like that too! Their are times where 3 seconds after I get on a gen I get a skill check, maybe have like ‚Äúdifficult‚Äùskill check for you first skill check and that would trigger the perk?
---
Whoops, I‚Äôm dumb lol.
---
Progress loss is extremely rare nowadays (on PC) I‚Äôve never lost progress and I‚Äôve been here since day 1.
---
Get put in with a SWF group that gets wrecked by the killer stupid fast then curses you out and flames you for not getting the 5th...when you got the other 4 and unhooked at risk to yourself.
---
I was playing susie XD but I'm rank 8
---
Oh, that's something. I forgot about moris and ultra rare addons. Thanks bud.
---
Yes, don't play legion. lol
---
No its not very hard to hit it in a chase, but it is way easier to hit with leatherface.
---
Leatherface is the best killer in the game for punishing people for making dumb, cocky moves, so many times I get a 4 man at red ranks with him because survivors think they are more clever then they are. He does get a bad rap because most people who play him don't play him at his full potential, they here the camping memes and they decide that's how they're gonna play him.
---
I'm not trying to argue he is better then hillbilly, I know he isn't, I'm saying he isn't as bad as you think and his style of play is completely different.
---
I mean... they kinda already did.
---
Where my fellow Ace mains at?
---
technically thinking about another woman
---
Its a great perk vs. Hag or Spirit, but for every other killer you could probably run something more useful. 
---
3.9K i think you mean
---
Whatever you feel like playing. Prioritize having fun over getting kills
---
It would be impossible for it to be representative of the playerbase no matter what. It's only representative of this one forum. There are only barely 1,500 active users, so it's not a bad sample size for this community, but more would have been better, as always. The numbers had been locked in for awhile anyway so I doubt much could have changed 
---
Thank you ruin, ver- **DISTANT THUNDER**
---
These memes contributing to an irrational hatred towards Claudette are boring and played as hell. 
---
Ouch. Sometimes this game's just like that, sometimes it's the other way round. I wish you luck in your next game!
---
I completely understand. I'm more surprised when I don't get abuse than when I do, and that really shouldn't be the state of the community.
---
I don't go ballistic, but when I switch back to my PS4 to play games I didn't feel like re-buying for PC, it feels like somethings wrong and I just can't stand to play for longer than an hour when I know I can go on my PC and get amazing graphics and FPS.
---
Come to console, you'll see a blurry mess most of the time but at least you left the fuck alone and you can enjoy the demo version of DBD on your own
---
Wraith is supposed to be loud to warn survivors. Add on removes this
---
Yes. That's why no one actually uses iron grasp.
---
Unless they're doing a meme build. It's not even a good body block prevention perk now that mad grit exists.
---
That sounds about right, red rank survivors typically wait a lot longer
---
What‚Äôd you do?
---
Yeah. So? Survivors can get away from you in one mistake. Thats it. She is a good killer, the best. Because all of the others can be looped. 
---
That's more or less what I gathered mate. 
---
Why are there multiple posts of people humble-bragging about getting banned today?
---
dude that 360 was clean. honestly why game
---
900 hours of gameplay and I still make dumbass mistakes all the time. There's always room for improvement. It's all about learning the maps. Practice chases with friends in KYF if you can and don't get upset if you fall flat on your face in a matter of seconds because every once in a while it still happens to the best of us. Also use Kate's perk windows of opportunity to help you learn the maps faster.
---
Why?
---
[you can get it from here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NDFYHM7)
---
Tell us oh mighty one how exactly do we counter him??? 
---
if three survivors are on generators for the generally long amount of time to complete 3 generators simultaneously then the killer is doing something wrong.
---
Like maybe they're being looped but that is the killer's fault, break off the chase and go patrol gens.
---
Sb is Sprint Burst
---
Swf is Survive with friends
---
Noed is No One Escapes Death
---
DH is Dead Hard
---
Db is..... I got no fucking idea. I could also be wrong on anyone of these. Would like some confirmation.
---
Nice
---
They need to make killers easier so that u can just 4k ez and then give them all the bloodpoints.  Maybe u can include free gift cards from Amazon for them too.
---
Just wait until he fails a skillcheck
---
&gt;humble-bragging about getting banned today?
---
What's there to brag about ? Are you stupid or trolling?
---
This is it. We've peaked. I will never find better than this.
---
I mean you're a shitty person if you lose a friend cause yall like different games lol 
---
Just gonna say you got banned and not tell us why?
---
Not personal to me, but I know that there's going to be that one person out there who it's happened to.
---
You know what'd be funnier? A generator mimic. 
---
I gained a competitive advantage by getting bloody clothing without grinding for millions of bp 
---
Myers can sneak up on you easily and pig can too and make almost no noise, this add on really isn't that big of a deal if you actually look around
---
No it for sure isn't lol
---
I got my Feng outfit and I can also peacefully fuck off. ^^
---
Kinda, I was a 150 battle chad from the get go and all I would do was beat on Jason like a red headed step child until either they got killed or the match ended. 
---
F13 is so freaking slow and boring. Like hoooly crap, I got the game and I felt like I was dying of boredom. There‚Äôs this stupid stamina bar thing where when you run out you start tripping like a drunk dumbass and also, Jason can apparently teleport now. 
---
Compared to DBD which is a fast paced game filled with tension, F13 is incredibly slow, boring and just isn‚Äôt fun. 
---
I suppose that is one advantage of consoles lmao
---
This post is the essence of the "Reddit Killer". smh
---
Thank you so much. Found out about this game about a month ago from reddit. Found it already in my library from when it was free. Have loved every second of it!  So i just havent figured out the abbreviations yet and this post seemed friendly enough to bring up my ignorance. 
---
Ohh it was ds not db
---
Ah, not exactly worth it if you got banned lol. Maybe you should I dunno either level up your main or buy cosmetics. 
---
&gt;Are you stupid or trolling?
---
I‚Äôm not the one who got banned now am I?
---
My point is that nobody here cares you‚Äôve been banned.
---
Thanatophobia on legion is unheard of. 
---
Not get caught... stay hidden... outlive his frenzy... bring no mither 
---
Is no one gonna mention their boot selection!?
---
ruins every other experience cus the mindgame potential in this game is so high?
---
Not false. Bloody stats from developer stream #114. 
---
If you get around 15k it doesn't sound like you are stuck at all, that's pip territory my man. Doubt you are doing much wrong, seems like you are focusing on the objective enough. I'd say just look up guides on how to keep chases going, aka how to loop. Don't look at any advanced stuff like 360ing or whatever.
---
feel free to pay 37 dollars then. that's how much it costs to get unlimited responses 
---
also, it being given to PS4 players is meaningless as far as this particular community goes. reddit in general has a stronger PC preference than the general population. that's not some secret 
---
The rank 2 was probably in a group with friends. I wouldn‚Äôt pay attention to rank too much anyway.
---
pls make this a reality!
---
Ofc, sorry to hear that you got a bad experience.  The game can be frustrating at times. Especially as a new killer. Still one of my favourite games tho.

Whenever I think my colleagues at work are incompetent I remember BHVR and think "Eh, could be worse...". 
---
I fought base wiggle time is around 10 seconds
---
cause legion is toxic and should be removed from the game.
---
Loool literally the same way, I will complain and still play the game xD Honestly though, I love this game and I agree it has its ups and downs, but doesn't mean it is going to be a shitty game every time I enter a new lobby. 
---
Please remember to tag posts that are sexually suggestive as NSFW.

I would rather play 20 rounds than wait 2 hours so I could get a 4k. A 2 OR 3K IS ALSO A WIN, YOU FUCKING TOASTER. What do you gain from a 4k and 2 hours of waiting that I can't get by playing 20 rounds in that time.
---
&gt;stop fucking complaining on reddit like a bitch i don't care and nobody else does lol
---
First of all, you're the one complaining about a hatch standoff that YOU could've stopped, but nooo let's complain on reddit cause I reaaaaally need the 4k.
---
Second, you obviously DO CARE as you're the one who waited 2 hours just to get a 4k.
---
What region do you play on
---
It sounds like you're salty man, I'm just telling you your sample size makes this whole thing useless. Sorry to rain on your little parade.
---
Dude so salty
---
Yup, Iron Grasp T3 will give you two more seconds of wiggle time. The big deal with it however is the reduction in the shaking that you will feel from the survivor. Making you a bit more efficient with your carrying.
---
\&gt;They are Legion  
---
Hope thats enough for you now hate em. like we all do!
---
Yes. It would be awful to see swears on this christian subreddit about this family friendly video game
---
A little negative but I don‚Äôt think you deserve to be downvoted 
---
Fate/kaleid
---
Thanks dude.
---
lol it was just for fun. i didn't expect people to be swinging in screaming about shit, holy fuck
---
Balance
---
PAIN IS TEMPORARY, SO IS YOUR DEPIPPING, IT CAN LAST FOR AN HOUR, FOR A DAY, FOR A MONTH OR EVEN A YEAR. BUT IT WILL SUBSIDE AND YOU WILL BE THE GREATEST MYERS TO WALK THE EARTH. KEEP ON STALKING
---
Cindy was against the idea in the film :) so Feng is still pure
---
Being SWF also makes some leave if you've been playing more SWF?
---
Where does that talking point come from? Breaking off a chase early in the game to potentially walk halfway across the map to hopefully encounter a less capable survivor is not optimal. 
---
You got a point there.
---
I did pay full price for it on both consoles and got all DLC too. 
---
Regardless,  there are over 90 million PS4 owners while the PS4 sub only has 1.7 subscribers. Reddit is not even the jumping off point for gauging a community. Nice try though. 
---
i'm not salty. you're the one literally everywhere. what I said is true. the DBD player base is not the same as the subreddit user base so it's meaningless to point out the PS+ giveaway 
---
don't act like reddit at large doesn't have a PC preference 
---
My parents weren‚Äôt home Saturday and I got to play dbd for 16 hours straight.
---
every. single. game.
---
Yamaoka Estate as Pig... holy crap I hate that place as any killer but crouching as Pig to sneak up on someone working a gen or a trap box is WAY harder with all that bamboo and other obstacles
---
Nice Noed
---
Unlucky
---
Was actually trying to make her look a bit likea cross between Feng and [Constance Wu](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/ConstanceImage.jpg), who is one of my favorite actresses. I guess I need to keep practicing! :) Thank you for your input.
---
Yep. It‚Äôs bullshit
---
Indeed she look great in armor. 
---
2 day ban? that's fucking nothing compared to how much grind you just bypassed.
---
It's better than being looped for a full minute. I see people get tunnel vision all the time as a killer and then the other survivors pop gens and that's basically game over (unless running noed, etc)
---
I like this! Great build!
---
No, you are extremely confused. I never said anything about how much your or anyone else paid for the game. what the fuck are you talking about? the 37$ is how much it costs to make a survey that doesn't cap out at 100 responses
---
&gt;  there are over 90 million PS4 owners while the PS4 sub only has 1.7 subscribers. Reddit is not even the jumping off point for gauging a community. Nice try though. 
---
I never said it was. This was only about this one particular community, not DBD as a whole. Why do you think I called it the /r/DeadByDaylight demographics survey?
---
I hope you run Technician. 
---
Theres the idea floating around the community of a transforming killer, like the classic werewolf, but the terrible balancing and lack of interest in learning from OPs scare me away from helping like I used to
---
If you've only beun playing a few weeks ago, I wouldn't focus too much about ranking up just yet! The rank you're at is a good place to be encountering decent killers and learning all the nuances of the game. I've been playing for 5 months (been rank 1 survivor for about 3 seasons and rank 4 killer for 1 season) and still learning new things about the game!
---
BUT if you really want to rank up, look at your emblems at the end of every match. On average, What emblem are you the most deficient on? I assume BC you play a lot of Dwight that you do a lot of gens. Work on those aspects of your play more. 
---
One thing you'll need to get better at if you want to survive at higher ranks is chases. At rank reset and I'm sent back to yellow/green ranks, the amount of survivors who crouch around the entire game hiding at any sign of a heart beat is honestly so frustrating. They're the same survivors who, after getting found, are downed within 10 seconds. 
---
Hope that kinda helps! Just enjoy the game BC you'll get better and will be ranking up before you know it.
---
SCP-096 HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT!
---
Please explain. I'm not sure how he's toxic. 
---
Now someone quick post this on animemes
---
That's lovely, i hope you get to enjoy the game more! Ignore the toxicity (i know it's hard but that's as much as we can do)
---
If you can guarantee me, it's a fair deal. Thanks for the help, I will buy it!
---
Yeah, sure thing, wait for your 2 hour victory while I get 20 more in that same amount of time. "Loser". 
---
Dedicated servers will help the problem only a little. 90% of it is hitboxes, which have beem shit for so long that I doubt they'll ever fix them.
---
I‚Äôve said it three times in this post already, it was literally my first time ever playing legion. I didn‚Äôt know they were considered OP. I‚Äôd never had any problems playing against them.
---
This is gibberish.
---
You must have not played For Honor then.
---
r/thanksihateit
---
That‚Äôs amazing
---
Yes but i wouldn't recommend using it since its easy to get to hooks without perks.
---
I had a game today on the Game, with hooks only on the top floor. That was fun
---
You'd be surprised at how seriously people take gaming. It's not even funny. 
---
the powder f our lord and savior, father luck, Ace Visconti
---
Zzzz Zzzz Zzz oh shit i fell asleep what did you say im sorry i don't speak loser 
---
Yeah, there is no way killers get 18 seconds of carry time unless they get multiple his with that legion perk.  Its closer to 10 plus 1 per rank of iron grip.
---
&gt;Iridescent Head should spawn on average every other blood web.
---
You forgot your shitpost, here.
---
*Have you ever played against a huntress with iri head and belt, you toaster? *
---
Oh hey league of legends
---
His entire design is so heavily drug influenced it completely breaks the game. There's 2 ways you can play him. The way the devs intended you to play him, which by doing so he's so shit he becomes weaker than Freddy. Or the exploit tunneling way which (althought it's not overpowered) takes no skill and has no counterplay whatsoever. He is completely unfun to play from both sides and his entire design is no borked there is literally no way to fix him other than removing him from the game, which the devs will obviously never do. So unfortunately we're stuck with this abomination.
---
He does run DS and his popular videos he has Object of Obsession and a purple flashlight as well, pretty toxic but he‚Äôs not mean to anyone
---
Freddy is too far away for that to hit her
---
Okay, so you've already got the first 3 coins.
---
In that case, it's: 400+500+600+700+800+900 = 3,900 (3.9k) points.
---
You missed the decimal :)
---
Is the joke here that legion wouldn't ever use an add-on that isn't Frankie mix tape and cold dirt?
---
&gt;edited 7 minutes ago
---
I read your reply the first time and didn't see that part in it ‚Ä¶ at all. FYI always note what you edited especially after someone has replied. I have no interest in responding to you anymore because of that. You'll just edit your response.  Have a great day. 
---
I like running increased t1 lunge.  Play as jumpscare Myers until 1 gen pops.  I always have around 30 of the increase lunge so unless there was something else I needed to run its good insurance to toss on for the beginning stages.
---
You couldn't die? The entity was sick of you lol
---
Good to hear! You should add me on [steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/mike-steele) if you wanna play SWF or something or have any other questions
---
Thanos car 
---
yeah so just work on extending chases in that case! obviously if you can lose the killer that would be ideal, but even wasting the killers time for a minute is a win for your team
---
PS4?
---
Dead By Daylight was the game I truly fell in love with ever since it released on console. It‚Äôs really upsetting being locked away from some of the best cosmetics in the game, I honestly wouldn‚Äôt wish this on anyone. This whole situation is one sided and feels like a big ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to the Asian community. I don‚Äôt know man, people get pissed off when a DLC is delayed by 1-2 weeks, it‚Äôs been 8 months. 
---
Is it truly too much to ask to sacrifice the living to an ancient eldritch deity without having to witness such vulgarity?
---
Okay, but that part isn't what was edited in. That was always there, you just glazed over it
---
See, and now you're just making up bullshit to cover your ass.
---
Fucking gamers
---
I have lol, 100 ish hours.
---
In order to get the full Chinese New Year experience, you must see what it is like to play with a Chinese killer!
---
You would have had a GG if you played any other killer. You're also using the Cold Dirt-Frank's Mix Tape toxic build. It's infamous, if you plan on maining Legion like this, expect literally everone hating you. 
---
And I don't speak shit grammar. 
---
Don't throw this back on me. That was not there. 
---
no but tbh that is quite a joke in itself 
---
I played a rank 1 hag with the othet day with Mint Rag and Waterlogged shoe, they had no idea why they couldn't tele. Easiest game of my life 
---
Chalkmen 
---
ah, a man(or woman cause idk) of culture i see....
---
It's fun and useful but I have to admit it's not that good. Excluding the fact that it literally doesn't work against the likes of Wraith and MM it is pretty much just a baby training perk for if you can't hit Great skill checks. That being said it's a solid B / B- tier perk that can help against Ruin or just to generally speed the game up.
---
Legion and Nurse aren't comparable.
---
Nurse has counterplay. Legion doesn't.
---
I couldnt die. I just froze in that animation you see on the picture. But the game around kept going like nothing had happend. Except the killer just stared at me, prob cus my animation froze. Then after like 3-4 minutes when the bleeding timer didnt tick down. He just decided to dc.
---
lol yes it was. you can't even admit to the most minor of mistakes, christ
---

It's like when you start a new moba like LoL or Dota 2. You'll get trashed by smurf the first hundred games before understanding what's going on, then if you are strong enough you will get better and go on. Or stop the game.  
---
A bit easier than Moba at the first glance tho since at least you only have to learn how to play against ( or with ) a dozen killer or so, then learn how to play the map - which is more important later on as you will realize.
---
I am sorry to say but I don‚Äòt like playing at legion at all.. not gonna be toxic but i can see why people are upset (especially with bullshit addons)
---
* Do not publicly shame other players.

Where are you located, what platform are you playing, what rank are you? ALL of those play a role in determining the answer.

I suppose, i kinda base toxcity on whether you're going out of your way to ruin anothers time. While DS and purple flashlight are annoying, they are part of the game and aren't abusing exploits or anything.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not planning to use. Thank you
---
genrushing doesnt exist
---
Had something similar a while ago - shouldn't happen to often I guess, since it only happened once in endless games. 
---
I remember the outrage of NA when we had to wait and extra 2 weeks for the store.  This is insane 
---
That's even worse if you're healing against sloppy and thanatophobia against legion!  When you heal against legion you aren't really healing you're renting a very temporary heal as the moment he sees you he is guaranteed to tag you along with everyone else with his ability putting your dumbass right back into injured state anyway.  Thanatophobia and sloppy turn tour self care into ridiculous healing speed and that's like 45 seconds a pop you are wasting not repairing the gens for a heal you're gonna lose instantly anyways.  Thanatophobia barely makes an impact on gen repair speeds what's it add like a whopping 12 seconds?  You are losing games for your team if you spend them self caring against legions 
---
Sorry, didnt know. Usually browse when I get home 
---
Psshh. Why is everyone playing this game so toxic. Always complaining that people are playing and enjoying the game, don't they know that it might make new players leave the game? 
---
trying to correct the broken japanese is the trap

don't wanna get punished

I never got this whole Chinese killer bad ping thing tbh.
---
I just tried Legion for the first time and immediately (no hit even) got 2DC's. Farmed with the other 2 for a while and after that went straight back to Spirit. I'm just gonna pour some BP into Legion to unlock the perks and then ignore them.
---
uwu
---
Why is this getting downvoted? This is the exact same thing I‚Äôm thinking is wrong, this ‚Äúmomentum‚Äù they added was fine and works as it should, however in the middle of coding this they now have somehow forgot to include the survivors hit box with the momentum they gain from a window vault, so now we have momentum that makes us look like we make the window but the hit box is still at the window until the survivor fully finishes the vaulting animation, which is now longer than it was originally. Like only a millisecond longer but that‚Äôs all the killer needs to get a hit with latency included 
---
Just wait a sec and the ping will turn yellow or green. The connection has to stabilize. If not, it's probably you're fault cause everyone else got decent ping. 
---
I actually did admit that it was my bad,, before I noticed you edited your reply to add that part into it. So I have no problem admitting when I'm wrong. What I don't care for is people like you that edit their responses after the fact. That's why people leave notes for their edits. It's not a new concept poll boi. 
---
Loser isn't a language. Get fucking corrected, bitch. Use proper punctuation or you just sound like a 8 year old calling other people losers.
---
Oh and, I said that on purpose because you used "Loser" as a language. 
---
Nobody actually complains about gen-rush, like ever. It's always directed at BHVR and it's about how fast gens can go. Nobody is trying to shame survivors for gen rushing. 
---
Kill rushing, on the other hand....
---
Dead by Gamebugs.... 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter atm. It‚Äôs a huge complaint from a lot of people. Mainly I see from red ranks. Also, platform that seems to have the bad ping issue is PC. 
---
 glad to hear your enjoying. Just to let you know, there is always a box in the basement, whether or not its in the shack or in one of the buildings
---
remember to stab her in the pussy dwight
---
You don't have to have gen pressure but it's best to hit once then leave in many cases since that dumbass will prob go self care somewhere even in red ranks.
---
It‚Äôs a joke.
---
China is quite far away from the rest of the majority of players worldwide, therefore many people have latency issues when the host is located in China.
---
Oh no Legion isn't OP. He's just really badly designed making him very unfun to play against. The only way to play him well is by exploiting which has no counterplay whatsoever, making him a really boring killer to play both as and against. It's understandable why people DC against him.
---
Every time I see legion I just leave the game i‚Äôm done playing against him until he receives more penalties

Well I'm on Xbox One and the red ping issue has been effecting me as well. So it does matter. 
---
I didn't that in you fucking momo
---
and the goddamn fucking audacity to say that when you're lying about what the comment editor clock says
---
fucking goddamn amazing
---
That's nuts. I've only seen bugs related to funny montages never something like that.
---
Oh I know but generally you get people from your region. You don‚Äôt actually get chinese people if you‚Äôre from US/EU. 
---
I think a killer that can transform themselves to look like a survivor would be interesting 
---
Survivors wasting time healing is the #1 reason I win at high ranks. There‚Äôs no point if they can be immediately and easily injured again. 
---
On the contrary, when survivors don‚Äôt heal it causes me to waste time reapplying deep wounds. 
---
P. S.  I don‚Äôt moonwalk or run sloppy or FMT I‚Äôve had minimal success with these
---
It requires an equal amount of skill to patrolling generators, which is where the survivors have the advantage of jungle gyms.
---
[I agree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJHUbtR0yI8)
---
That argument makes no sense lmao. Just because someone doesn‚Äôt have friends that play dbd or want to use voice comms doesn‚Äôt mean they should just be fucked vs noed 
---
I want a 115% MS killer that's good in chase but not stupid like Legion or arguably Spirit.
---
Today I played SWF with my brother. We ended up against a Legion who annoyed us and the Claudette the entire game, we never saw the fourth guy. 
---
We still managed to get all the gens down, but my brother gets hooked at that exact moment. So Claudette and I head to save him while the other dude chills by the door. We successfully save my brother and run towards the door we thought he had opened, but nope, the guy decided to self care instead of securing everyone's escape.
---
In chat after the game when confronted he said "Remember, I come before you" which still doesn't make sense cause he too needed to get out through that bloody door....
---
I wish I had leatherface killers lol. Haven't seen one in about 2 weeks.
---
don't listen to the haters legion Is the truth
---
Are you getting lobbies instantly as Survivor? Its taking me 1-2 mins and then I get put in a lobby with 700 ping.
---
Many Nurse players are completely incompetent at playing any other killer, since Nurse plays a different game, so don't be bothered by it.
---
Stop caring about rank or winning, just focus on getting better, you'll realize rank means jack shit.
---
And for gameplay since Nurse players generally make common mistakes and in general:
---
1. Learn to cut corners better, strafe instead of holding W.
---
2. Learn to actually mindgame tiles, moonwalking, double backing etc.
---
3. Just eat the pallet, most pallets you're better off breaking and never respect them.
---
4. Myers specific: don't waste the EW3, you should be mainly using EW2, you will usually only hit EW3 twice or 3 times at most, each EW3 needs to secure at least 2 downs.
---
5. Learn to manage pressure, you don't need to be mobile to have pressure, prioritize downs first, then hooks, then injuries, if you see many survs in the same location you should slug etc.
---
6. Just play and get better over time, rank comes naturally as long as you don't play like a complete ape.
---
300 games, averaging at 20 minutes a game (inclusive of lobby, to be VERY GENEROUS)... Well it's only 100 hours of gameplay to pull in 15 days, 50 hours a week, or 6.67 hours/day minimum every day. More than a full time job in most places.
---
That's just stupid.
---
Neither am I? 
---
Listen, there's only two things that matter in this game: Individual skill and map layout. The skillcap for playing is pretty low, so once you get good, ultimately the only thing that matters is the layout of the map. If you realize this, maybe you'll stop blaming others for a lack of self awareness. SWF doesn't make people better players (the opposite, actually) and it has no effect on how many safe pallets/windows spawn into a map.
---
Anyway, enjoy your dying light mori moonwalking legion gameplay.
---
Honestly tho, say you don‚Äôt mind being tunneled or face camped and you‚Äôre the worst type of survivor ever. Say you don‚Äôt mind being looped and t-bagged and you‚Äôre an ez baby killer. This ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù is a joke
---
lol you complain about a perk over a stupid fucking bug?  just wow dawg.
---
I‚Äôm playing all I can for Feng‚Äôs and Huntress‚Äô Moonrise cosmetics, they‚Äôre literally all I‚Äôve got. I‚Äôm almost certain no one grinds for cosmetics. 
---
1 hour of an average job : $10
---
900 shards a day approx 8 matches each level : 4-6 hours a day. 
---
It‚Äôs a lost cause. I‚Äôm not asking for the cost‚Äôs to be reduced or XP increased, I would happily buy cosmetics, but I can‚Äôt.
---
Captaincastle? More like...CaptainASSHOLE...amirite?

In all seriousness tho stop being a dick for literally no reason lol.

New gamemodes are more unique and interesting to think about than new chapters.
---
obviously telling someone to kys because you're mad about the character they're playing is very normal and logical
---
At least you have to be good to do well as Spirit. Also Iron Will is meta and hard counters her so its alright.
---
I give you the opposite: do 2 gens, loop the killer for a full gen and lose him, commit to the last gen by myself for my fellow survivors and loop him again for half the map, then get Basement NOED'd and your teammates escape.
---
Emblem screen: -1
---
Couldn't get any save because the killer couldn't hook anybody, and the hook he got he facecamped. Of course, it was a Wraith.
---
It‚Äôs not being salty when a killer is so poorly designed you physically can‚Äôt enjoy the game regardless of if they 4K or 0k
---
Just wanted Feng's Outif. Survivor queue takes too long. Getting the envelope per web is too little. Too often i get a lobby with high ping 300+. I got my feng and huntress axe. Whatever else i get is okay. But im not gonna grind for hours in such a tedious manner.

IDK why people call it Kobe, but it is what it is.
---
What was the point of this post? I don‚Äôt see anything unusual :thinking:
---
Both have good stuff and flaws to them, I've had more fun playing F13 than I have with DBD, DBD is good but the community is horrible and playing tends to be more competitive than fun. I like that F13 brings a lot brooding horror and DBD is fast paced. 
---
Worst one for me was a player who missed a bunch of skill checks just while I was around (so god knows how many more were missed).  Had the first gen about 70% of the way through, she gets on to help me and misses three skill checks in a manner of 15 seconds.  Gen is now at 50% and the killer is right on top of us.  Awesome.
---
Some time later I got hit and she was healing me.  Missed two skill checks, I didn't get healed, and the killer is right on top of us again.
---
Finally I walked up to work on the last gen, saw her get on and I NOPE'd out of there immediately as I hear the failed skill check again.  Then one last time for comfort before she got downed and Mori'd.  First time I was ever so happy to see someone die at the hands of the killer.
---
Yeah. Camping/tunneling is VERY annoying, but I won't crucify you for just seeing it as another playstyle.
---
Personally, I find loops annoying, but a part of the game, so I don't mind them. It's fun to mind game on loops too. I don't like teabags, but I won't despise you for it either.
---
For some reason, all of the above makes me a reject from the community, but whatever.
---
How? Everyone escaped and got a ton of points. Everyone pipped. 
---
If you think it promotes a camping/mori playstyle then that could be why you are having trouble pipping.  You can definitely 2 pip with only 1 kill, it may even be possible without killing anyone.  Sacrifices are only 1 out of the 4 categories.  
---
You need 9 emblem points to pip. You get bronze Devout just from hooking each survivor once, and either bronze or silver Malicious from 2 hooking everyone with no kills.  That's 2 or 3 points of the 9 right there, then you need either iridescent Chaser or Gatekeeper plus silver or gold of the other.  Possibly just gold in both.  Those two go hand in hand though, and getting lots of hits spread out throughout the game to keep everyone injured/off generators can make this pretty achievable.
---
As you should be.
---
He bypassed weeks of grind and millions of bloodpoints saved for a 2 day ban. Unless they reset his prestige which they wont, he won.
---
I don‚Äôt mind playing against a Legion, even if they‚Äôre tunneling me with Frank‚Äôs and Stab Wound. So maybe you‚Äôre just a salty baby :)
---
* Screenshot highlighting that everyone disconnected.
---
Rank in the game means nothing tbh
---
Not that I'm saying it's bad that he does, a lot of survivors also play just to make the killers salty.
---
So, killers aren't supposed to use addons? Or tunnel? or Camp? Or chase? Or make survivors lives hard? C'mon.
---
telling someone to kys because of a video game character is next dimension salt are you serious right now
---
What? I told you dude i don't speak trash dude 
---
The killer was away for a min and when he came crack to face camp for some reason I tried killing myself oh hook just to escape in the face of the killer. I wasn‚Äôt happy...
---
Or the fact that I don‚Äôt mind being tunneled by a legion using franks and stab wound, or that I play legion (I don‚Äôt even tunnel and don‚Äôt like franks but still get flamed because it‚Äôs legion)

It's not 10 seconds but you'll see people counting to 10 anyway. That's because it's roughly 10 "Grunts" from the survivor before they wiggle off.

I'm nearly at my 4th coin, andtbh I don't find it too bad in terms of grind. I play a ton of dbd anyway, and since these coins can be earned (though rather slower on killer) through normal gameplay objectives, I think I'll have enough for another full set. I got Feng's which is what I really wanted, feel dubious but I'll probably get huntress', not interested at all in davids-- I mean aces.
---
People are toxic even when I don't play Legion. So I figure I may as well just play who I feel like.
---
Not really the same bug then, just similar then?
---
What?? Ur still here? Now ur just really salty 
---
People are toxic even when I don't play Legion. So I figure I may as well just play who I feel like. And just because someone plays a character you don't like doesn't really justify telling someone to kill themselves. I don't go around harassing Claudettes.
---
I mean, you're still here as well. 
---
What? I can't read it dude 
---
Holy shit!
---
It‚Äôs an issue that BHVR is aware of 
---
That's definitely something that goes through my mind when making the decision to camp or not. As long as Survivors keep bum-rushing the hook, camping is gonna work. And if it's someone especially slippery, then yeah camping that one can feel good. I had one team go do gens and all run out. They laughed at me (rightfully), but seriously it's very seldom it gets played that way. Usually I end up with at least 2 kills from them trying to get the rescue.
---
I told you dude i don't speak dumbass 
---
Honestly, I thought F13 was the more friendly game as well as being better gameplay wise.....until this recent patch. Now Jason is op as can be! If you're a slasher Jason even more so!
---
I had the same thing happen to me. Then the killer couldn‚Äôt use the R1 button for anything, ie checking lockers or picking up survivors. He dced after a while. I tried messaging him but he never responded. 
---
I have been tempted to just sit around and keep opening killer lobbies and dodging just because i know how much it will inconvenience swfs
---
Thank you so much! I really feel like it's worth to keep going knowing there's nice people playing.
---
I mean I don‚Äòt know how you play in general.. but yes, people are quite toxic in this game. close your chat and don‚Äòt read what they say &amp; play how you want (yes try closing the chat - 9/10 times you are gonna read some bullshit comments anyways)
---
What? Ur still salty?
---
If you look at the hooked survivor with the center of your screen unhooking should have priority. If that still doesnt work for whatever reason, holding the sprintbutton while walking to the hook fixes it. You cant selfcare while sprinting, unhooking works.
---
What? Ur still salty? 
---
Cannibal is the most powerful killer because he can put on black face and say the N-word.
---
Hmmm.... maybe I should just bake them into the power; Survivors are Exposed when he reveals them, and his add-ons reveal certain actions at any distance/within a large radius.
---
The whole chat's not there, before that he said GG, and I said "GG! Thanks for not being toxic, I'm still learning my killer".
---
rewards for being in red rank? hell yeah, would stop people depipping
---
Yeah sorry missed it xd
---
I figured that he should be able to semi-track people even if he can't see them, through smell (blood) and just what's around him, though I could see them being removed especially if he gets "It can smell us" backed into his passive.
---
You're not injured, you're in the dying state, so no. It also doesn't affect Overcharge or Snap Out of It skill checks. IMO, TiNH should be buffed to always be in effect, since it says you perform your best under extreme stress, but why would you not be in extreme stress all the time when killers are actively hunting you?
---
What do you mean? 
---
I had one where I was Pig and I got looped hard. FINALLY got the guy. Didn't do any serious camping that match, but with Pig traps, it's hard to get out so I eventually got a 4k. The looper was really mad at the end because his team got one gen done during several minutes of me trying to get him.
---
That‚Äôs why when you get to rank 1 everyone is much better at the game than everyone at even rank 10. 
---
I mean lets be real here obviously ur triggered because im better then you so now you have to reply to prove yourself that you're not salty so since this was a shit post for a unpopular opinion because i needed advice, how about i delete this post and then you can't reply and then i fucking win don't I? Because im preventing you from replying something you want to do. Mmmmm check mate gg ez ur move 
---
how do you even learn a braindead killer omegalul
---
which is a good thing, pallets are still strong despite this
---
Claudette is just a skin, legion is a killer with 0 counterplay except hide all game and hope they‚Äôre bad 
---
Pallets aren‚Äôt strong at all rn lol, it‚Äôs basically 50/50 if you get hit or not 
---
More perks and the season rewards seem reasonable but I highly doubt they'd agree with the devotion rewards as shards can be used to be buy most skins
---
Well. Here. I lost a friend because I play Dead By Daylight. Actually, he thinks whoever who plays DbD, it's just a poor, stupid, non-life person.
---
So sad...
---
To be honest I'm happy that I'm not longer his friend. 
---
Yeah sure, delete it, it would make this sub a better place. 
---
Except they aren‚Äôt 7-4 is where in my experience the best players are, rank one is like 90% immersed players who can‚Äôt loop
---
What? I told you dude i don't speak dumbass
---
not gonna lose friends over games, still gonna tell them if a game is shit or not though
---
From my personal experience it‚Äôs completely opposite. The games only get harder the higher of the rank you are. Means it‚Äôs doing something. 
---
I mean i don‚Äôt say it bc I dc as soon as I see its legion, but I‚Äôve seen people saying it plenty about legion and things like iri huntress. If you play like a dick people are gonna be dicks back 
---
So what are you gonna do? You already took the L for the hatch argument 
---
Welp you must be lucky because whenever I bother to hit rank one the games are just god awful to play getting sandbagged and having useless teams 
---
No, I'm pretty sure you did. 
---
So, my friends and I all played different games in the MOBA genre because we all despised the other games; I like DotA's balancing and hero design, and feel that LoL is a watered down kids version while Smite's camera just doesn't work for me. One of my friend's loves LoL, the other likes Smite.
---
We'd all rotate whatever game we were playing simply because we all wanted to play together and didn't have a specific game we all enjoyed... right up until HotS became a thing.
---
Problem was, we had a fourth friend who refused to play HotS despite the other three of us wanting to and he didn't have a problem with any other game. Dude eventually got so pissed at us for liking it for some reason (maybe he hated Blizzard before hating Blizzard was cool) he stopped talking to us.
---
What? I don't speak loser 
---
when you die to a 2 perk wraith OOF
---
I have contacted not_Queen about this issue. I‚Äôve been following this for a few months on the forums and made several posts, but I‚Äôve finally got the attention of the someone. Maybe there is hope after all.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/304788#Comment_304788
---
What anime is that?
---
If all you enjoy is the game anymore is salty steam comments (which I kind of doubt because that's hardly motivation enough to play the game) it sounds like you're the victim of the very us vs. them mentality you warned others about. 
---
From p2 to p3 I'm thinking the treatment was worse than the disease.
---
You learn that after half of a legion match. Theres nothing to learn, nothing to do to get better. Plays the same exact way every time.
---
Iron Grasp is to killers as Lightweight is to survivors. 
---
Useful but better options exist. It is a very solid perk however and those 2 seconds are essential when dealing with sabotaging or bodyblocking survivors. If you haven't got anything better don't feel bad about running it.
---
pebble time
---
As part of their meta build? Not necessarily. BBQ is only super strong on killers that can go across the map really quickly. Sure it gives info to someone like Wraith, but they can't really get to the person fast enough to make much of a difference compared to say Hillbilly
---
oh god please. this is ridiculous they are playing a fucking game. most people don't sit around and read salty people on the internet whine about a game character most people just think "oh neat" and play legion. and OP is being a sweetheart in the image. and you have the audacity to call them a dick?
---
&gt; Anyone who would actually kill themself over someone saying kys online doesn‚Äôt belong within a thousand miles of a computers 
---
or maybe people should be encouraged to not attack someone in such a vicious way over a fucking computer game? news flash: there are hurt, depressed people out there who shouldn't have to segregate like that. the onus should be on the assholes, not the ones being bullied 
---
What?
---
HillWilliam doesn't let these insults phase him, he's too busy sprinting off into the distance to chop your teammates up
---
What? 
---
you‚Äôve heard of T-posing, now get reading for: Hook-posing
---
Just so you know the killer perk Shadowborn increases your FOV, so it might help if you can manage to grab the teachable perk from Wraith and learn it on other killers.
---
You're very negative.
---
thank you üòä

Dude ur talking to a person that waited at the hatch for 2 hours üòÇ I've done it before all i do all day everyday is talk shit on the internet i do nothing with my life but win and trash talküòÇ you would rather lose then win and you have been replying to someone who isn't even reading ur textü§£ i mean i basically won gg ez take the L trash af

you got hit through a window yes and?

I play DBD to get bullied by killers then switch to f13 to bully the killer üëå
---
True lol, Thanks man.
---
&gt;but win
---
You lost like 10 times already
---
That‚Äôs like saying there‚Äôs no such thing as camping or tunneling as it‚Äôs the killers job to kill you. There‚Äôs a difference between doing the gens and rushing the gens.
---
Hackers are also just playing a game, but spend 5 mins on any site related to the game and you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs a cunt move, just like playing legion. And again, if you‚Äôre in such a bad spot in life you‚Äôd consider hurting yourself because GamerGuy99 say kys you need to be getting help from a professional, not going online 
---
Today my game froze on an unhook, could still move the camera but the killer was walking nonstop into the wall nearby. DC'd after an agonising 30 seconds. I thought it was his connection, though...
---
Enjoy ranks 10 for now is all I can advise. Play for bloodpoints, get unlockable on your chars etc ... You'll play with trash team mates VS sweaty killers later don't worry.
---
A day or two ago.
---
I hope the devs postpone the next killer and fix this major bugs. I'll upload it, and hopefully the devs will see it! :)
---
There's mouse and keyboard for consoles? Huh
---
Wait can't i block you and then you can't meaning i stopped you from replying mmm let's try it out if you don't hear from me again get shitted on bitch ü§£ i won again i fucking love winning you can't really so what are you gonna do? Lol
---
&gt; Hackers are also just playing a game, but spend 5 mins on any site related to the game and you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs a cunt move, just like playing legion.
---
This is such an absurd comparison, you have to be trolling 
---
&gt; And again, if you‚Äôre in such a bad spot in life you‚Äôd consider hurting yourself because GamerGuy99 say kys you need to be getting help from a professional, not going online 
---
How do you know they're not? I cannot believe that saying "don't tell people kys over a video game" is controversial to you.
---
Ye that sounds like a DC to me! 
---
I generally use BBQ on every killer I can, mainly for the bloodpoints bonus though. Gotta speed up that grinding
---
Blocking me now is just admitting to a loss. So you just lost again. 
---
&gt; OP is being a sweetheart in the image.
---
noooo stop
---
Go for it you got talent. How bout princess Nea. 
---
It really isn‚Äôt tho, both just ignore the rules of the game and make it 0 fun. Though hackers are at least funny every now and then, legion is just aids. 
---
And it doesn‚Äôt matter if you should or shouldn‚Äôt tell people to kys online, because it‚Äôs never gonna go away. People have been saying it since the dawn on vs games. 
---
*\*squeaks trying to say octoling boy\**
---
Now you have to BM killers with Shaggy
---
Eyyy dude see ya later bud i get the last word pussy this was easy af get shitted on bitch. I control this fucking thread what are you gonna? i can do whatever i want to this thread. 
---
It's certainly not meta on everyone, but BBQ is absolutely good on everyone. Just like new Surveillance, info on where the survivors are can be more powerful than you think. It's like a long range Whispers, even just having a general search area for survivors can shorten the time between chases a lot.
---
Delete my comments, then. 
---
thats what i am sayin btw.
---
Are you talking about the post someone did of the fastest possible gen completion which was roughly 15 seconds? 
---
Which requires everyone to have specific perks, addons, and a gen with 4 sides which not all maps have?
---
You're literally using the best case scenario which never happens unless there's a 4 stack on a very specific maps with lucky gen spawns. 
---
I've never even had a match in 600 hours where each person brought a brand new part even.....
---
9 times out of ten only 2 survivors even bring items at red ranks.
---
Okay. You have the emotional maturity of an 11 year old. I get it now.
---
It takes a while, idk maybe a minute 
---
I find the Doctor the most annoying out of them all. I like to play ‚Äòimmersed‚Äô and enjoy stealth - that all gets thrown out the window against him. 
---
Least fun to play against, IMO, is Legion. He‚Äôs not very annoying, it‚Äôs just the cycle of chase &gt; mend &gt; chase &gt; mend gets really boring and is unfun.
---
Yeah, her humming has a HUGE range (40ish meters?). It's nearly double the terror radius (heartbeat). Plenty of time to sneak away without leaving those damn trail marks.
---
Not necessarily. Back in the day when overwatch was popular I played a shit ton. Upwards of 50 there.
---
ya know its like telliing ppl to stick in a game they dont want and btw even if the button is removed they will just alt+ f4 and are outta there if ppl dont wanna play they wont.
---
We're you playing legion? 
---
This is my first time seeing what P3 wraith looks like and it looks so good ü§†
---
His sprint is on a pretty hefty cooldown with a short burst. And he's slower than any other killer. He can vault pallets, and windows but odds are when you do - at least against good survivors - you end up having to do it 2-3 times in order to catch anyone because they're just waiting for the double back. And if he takes too long trying to catch one person, gens get rushed if he's not running hex: ruin, thana. He still gets stomped by survivors fairly often. 
---
"I think we've done a pretty good job so far"
---
Actually, we have no way to know for sure. Yes, Survivors will not be held hostage by Killers lagging, but largely depending on how BHVR implements this, impossible hits will still be a thing (altho much less often if they actively try to fix it) and in certain situations Killers may still be favoured.
---
It has to be in the game for certain situations. For example, killer blocks the exit to basement locking survivors there indefinitely. 
---
There are adapters and XB is gonna get native support soon, when that comes devs will have a couple of options on how they want M+K working in their games
---
dont do this bandaid fix as it would make hits through pallet useless, just fix hitboxes already
---
Nah, I just understand if I ruin other experience on purpose they‚Äôre gonna be pissed 
---
A lot of killers think simultaneous load-in automatically means SWF, so they dodge. 
---
Youre using the worst case scenario where every survivor doesn't use perks or toolboxes or doesn't coop on a gen. Thats funny though since the higher I am at ranks the more items I see. Its either flashlights or toolboxes
---
But since I am wrong I'll leave it at that and go back to my game as killer since getting a match is  quick. 
---
Enjoy your lobby simulator
---
If they went into the game unless the player is in a situation where there are no other options for some reason then they shouldn't DC, just not wanting to play the game for some petty reason is not justification. and I know that would happen Im mostly just pissed after this result for every game.
---
I'd say go Myers and practise! There's a lot of tips online on how to use his Evil Within efficiently, like using a fleeing survivor to charge but wait for a close encounter to rank it up. Occasionally panicked survivors make mistakes, I try to move unpredictably and take advantage of that. 
---
When I'm not fooling around I get at least 3k. Still learning myself but the games are always entertaining! Go with what makes you happy as opposed to rank, I say.
---
If I steam roll them I normally play with them alittle leave them on the ground if I know their deathhook and run away so they can get up.. you lose alot of points from not having a 4th so I just make up with lots of chases and hits. So yeh I dont camp them and get my 2hooks
---
I don't get it? I'm assuming because I haven't played Myers much yet.
---
I was going to rescue my bud on the hook. Hag put a trap in front of the hook and I, very confidently, stated "Hold on I got this shit" and activated my flashlight to burn the trap way. I also didn't let go of the move stick.
---
We both died.
---
Yeah I don't really heal against legion just annoying having permanent thanataphobia for gen speed
---
God speed good Sir!
---
1 out of my 15 games, only one that the survivors tryed to justify it. Just proves how much people love legion.
---
Lost all interest in Last Year when I saw that the survivors get weapons
---
actually the first part is wrong. the sprint is fast as fuck even without addons and i can tell u that because i played him myself + the deep wound effect is a gurantee to down ppl eventually cause it ticks down like a madman same for the pig traps both are just not fair they should just give it more time like double the timer but meeh and btw you talk about rank 1 super SF teams nobody rushes gens around 15-4 i can tell cause i am at rank 4.
---
Legion is jsut a bit to powerfull if you are not rank 2-1 with a perfect build and understanding.
---
north america
---
not what I meant but I see what you mean
---
Claudette as Brenda makes total sense. Both are toxic(still my favs tho ;)
---
WOW good job this looks great man
---
Just have fun and enjoy the game. Rank doesnt matter and killers get pretty sweaty at rank 1 and its less fun imo. Just go at your own pace and learn as you go.
---
That many games? What are you doing to make them leave like that. That is just too many for it to be just ‚Äúsalty survivors‚Äù. Your causing it somehow.. some way..
---
The fuck? That hit?!
---
I have plenty of friends who really like F13 and you know what I do about it? *I don't care.* I tell them that I don't think F13 is that good but I also feel sorry that their game got ruined by lawsuits. They play DBD with me now (since F13 is kinda dead RIP) and they're really chill and we're all still friends instead of fighting over what bunch of 1s and 0s was better.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty good with him, I even got to rank 8 with only nurses calling 1, brutal strength 2, make your choice 2, and sloppy butcher 1
---
At the moment I‚Äôm playing hunters at only level 40 and I‚Äôm at rank 6, I didn‚Äôt expect to get to rank 6 with the huntress so I‚Äôm gonna prestige her to 3 too, same with Myers.
---
The ultra rare add-on makes tier 3 infinite, but takes a /lot/ of stalking to get there, and the bow doesn't do anything, as tier 3 is already infinite, besides make it take longer to get to tier 3.
---
BBQ and Chili God throw huntress. Huh. I guess I'm done with Reddit for today, I'm not gonna see anything more amazing.
---
I play both because my killer game too stronk. My advice dont play shitty make your goal to get them off gens more than defending hooks. My post games are much nicer doing that. Like I 4k and they are just like "holy hell gg that was some esports there" also put on funny names like Ive been playing as taylor swift and will talk to them in song quotes.. lol had 1/4 be salty and I was like " man... we used to be mad love.. but now we got bad blood." Or if I get wreked"I knew yall were trouble when you spawned in" just something so that when they get wreked they can still laugh with you. 
---
For a gureented nicer post game. Let the last person go. 
---
The strongest killers are ones who play survivors use that. You know what paths youd take. You know mind games and loops. 
---
Kinda wish I knew about this before I got the game
---
While I started with Survivor because it's easy and more easily identifiable I did eventually start playing Killer because I figured that it would be stupid to buy the game and all the DLC just to play only half of it.
---
Absolute truth
---
Lol you made her wait
---
Lol you made her white 
---
You're supposed to stop working on the gen when you don't hit a great. 
---
My last game in a nutshell. Dodge Billy chainsaw 4 times and then get hit by it when I'm 10 feet away from a window I vaulted. And then get facecamped and die feels great man.
---
Some of the most fun gameplay comes from saving someone from a face camper. With a little bit of teamwork and effort its possible. 
---
I play on PS4 since it was released there and honestly I‚Äôm happy it‚Äôs considered casual because it‚Äôs suppose to be fun as it‚Äôs a game
---
I play on my microwave, it actually gives me great connection. 
---
This is kinda the end result of killers having specific kits instead of being more freeform like Survivors.
---
None of Ruin's competitors are on par with it for slowing down the game, and since time is quantifiable it's pretty hard to buff something that functions differently yet neither surpasses Ruin nor under performs. And every killer wants more match time.
---
Nothing matches BBQ for points. Even if you took away the aura reading BBQ means more points which means you chew up more of your bloodweb per game which means you have a larger pool of addons (and therefor green or better addons) per match. And even if you went the otherway and took away the points Billy is one of the killers best oriented towards taking advantage of BBQ's aura reading.
---
With Enduring, there's nothing that defangs pallet stuns the same way. Just straight up nothing. Spirit's Fury isn't even all that useful if you don't also have Enduring.
---
Most of the other viable options are either redundant (ie MYC would be good for Billy if he didn't already have a one hit ability) or not helpful for Billy's kit (ie M&amp;A doesn't muffle chainsaws).
---
The only way that gets solved is either to completely redo Killers into being totally freeform characters, which is beyond the scope of DbD, or to identify every strength and weakness a killer might want to alter and crank out a bunch of individually viable options to deal with it.
---
What do we have here? Somebody decided to delete their post because they were salty and in the wrong, how surprising. Take the L, "loser".
---
I just switched from ps4 to pc because of the frame rate. I killer main. So far so good but one hell of a grind ahead... 
---
Such an angry comments section!
---
My dood, someone must not have told you, but anything relating to Legion twists the poor sensitive nipples of this here community.
---
I love my boy Joey, but I don't flaunt my affection for him here. Regardless, I admire that you've been responding to these people, it's been a nice distraction to read.
---
I hope you continue playing the game with the characters you want to play. I play on PS4 so I don't really have to worry about post game chat so much (messages still exist, but those are typically more humorous than anything), but, nonetheless, I recommend leaving the game ASAP when the match ends if you don't want to be bothered by some of the more rude players in the game.
---
Anyways, there's my comment; as unwarranted as it may be, I hope it wasn't a complete waste of my time. 
---
Have a great day.
---
That's not how numbers work.
---
&gt;BBQ is only super strong on killers that can go across the map really quickly.
---
To any new players reading this: He's wrong. Very wrong. 
---
As a killer I can spot bby survivors pretty easy. They tend to miss skillchecks alot. Dont know how to loop never look behind them in a chase throw down pallets immediately. I tend to treat them with kid gloves and will only kill them asap if they are doing more harm to their team by degressing gens for me or farming teammates.
---

How about hentai?
---
Last I heard gens were updated to be more effective to hide behind since you turn the same color. Did they change that?
---
FAKE!!!!STAGGED! not a one of them dced at mori
---
r/TIHI
---
J wish this was the case. It is so easy to rank up, the only way you won't get to rank 1 is if you don't know basic knowledge of being the killer. You can pip without even killing anyone 
---
They can't. Even without that button, all you have to do is close the game out. There's no way to prevent it from happening. 
---
Seems so. I've heard people say he's OP, I've seen people say he's worse than Freddy. I'm fairly sure people were super salty at the Nurse when she was released too.
---
What? I get tons of messages on console.

There are several seconds when the sparks prevent the gen from progressing, so you might as well do something.

Whaaaat??? Hey dude are you still there or did it actually work? IM A FUCKING WINNER 
---
I play on PS4 because it was offered as a free PS Plus game. I agree with the game being inferior to the PC version, pass or no pass. 
---
Despite the bugs, I love the gameplay loop and have lots of fun. Also there aren't many any other games to scratch the niche itch DbD does on the PS4.
---
I play PS4 
---
You know you're a survivor main if you want stuns to heal you a health state. That might be the absolute dumbest shit I've heard all week.
---
At red ranks on PC survivor, they are sweaty. Like, flooded sweaty.
---
I run slopppy butcher and Bloodhound because I like the pretty colours.
---
False saws will be the death of me 
---
Oh ok thank you hahah 
---
Did you try Survive with Friends? invite them to a SwF lobby then search for a game.

If I can be bisexual I can be bi-mained ok. But probably clown because I love the way he can stop loops.

Why is No0b3 in the same category as Ochido?

Haha

Lol yay for useless data

For sure. He's kind of a dick but he's got great content for this
---
I play on PS4 because 1) I don't have a good gaming PC and 2) All my friends are on PS4
---
Better than my xbox
---
I feel like I'm the john connor of xbox dbd
---
If you're reading this, you're the resistance
---
Spirit is really fun, but not as fun as the clown in my opinion. Once you get used to throwing bottles, you can really mess with people. I highly recommend the clown.
---
I play Legion and I let all the survs escape if someone dcs unless its a waste of time or they  all dcd on last hook
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. And there is only one way to play with friend or am I wrong ? Should we open some port or I don‚Äôt know to help connect with the killer ?
---
I‚Äôm very tired with this bug. I invite my friend, searching for lobby then boom I come in the lobby with 1 or 2 other people and my friend have ¬´¬†disconnected from host¬ª

Then again he get in the lobby with 2 other people and I have ¬´¬†disconnected from host¬†¬ª ...

I don‚Äôt know what to do, any help please ?

I got 5 coins within 2 day now i dont want any item so i stopped grinding.
