But the huntresse need his rabbit ear on his mask because i don't know how to said that. Weird. I don't know really like to draw but continue to be better.

poggers
---
Yeah, but then he'd only down one person instead of three at once, since after breaking the pallet, the Survivors would (or should, anyway) split up and scatter.
---
Bro it‚Äôs water off your back. I love getting hate messages from survivors it‚Äôs funny. And then you can just shit talk them back. I think more online games should just allow trashtalk
---
That makes more sense. Sometimes killers will go after someone thats out in the open or an easy hit. In that case there isn't too much they can do unless they drop that chase. But I assume you mean going out of there way to hunt down the hooked survivor that is the worst target possible. It is shitty when a killer does that.
---
I'd love some big antlers
---
Lmao
---
From my experience, most survivors fucking LOVE Michael. Whether or not they die it‚Äôs always a fun and spooky game.
---
Jesus ppl blow the SWF stuff way outta proportion. There are those super sweaty groups that try and as shit while playing together, but I‚Äôm willing to bet most groups are people just trying to have fun and Dick around with their friends. 
---
This message is from your local killer main that doesn‚Äôt like the SWFs in general, but I understand they aren‚Äôt all sweaty try hards.
---
I literally played a Huntress game 2 days ago where I hit a Steve and I saw a blood splash but he didn't get injured.
---
They have some pretty good stuff on their official site.
---
This makes sense it's so annoying .-.
---
It makes communities more toxic and very unfun. You may be more suited to being toxic and dealing with it but I hate toxic people. Usually I brush off insults and toxic behavior but its just so damn anoying when its 24/7 of toxic cunts.
---
Thanks :)
---
Needs more pustules. 
---
Srsly tho good job.
---
Wow. I can only imagine how good that felt
---
*Tea bagging at the exit gate then seeing blood warden activate*

What‚Äôs the name of your perk skins?
---
But you don't have to take damage for sprint burst.
---
[removed]
---
Yeah.. I've also noticed the return of the teleporting killer. You'll stun them, get hit, it'll knock them on the side you got downed on, they'll do the stun animation, then they'll teleport back to the other side. Complete bs if you ask me.
---
Woah, how did you get your perks to have color?

ngl I‚Äôm just gonna d/c and go on another game. I play this game to have fun and if I can tell the game‚Äôs not gonna be fun because of laggy killer, rubbish teammates or boring killer build etc I‚Äôm gonna get the hell out of that game...
---
I would pour a beer out for Deathgarden at launch but they would just use the can as another hunter skin.
---
It's the same reason when u feel a hit is bullshit
---
I sometimes do this as well, but for some reason, whenever I decide to give the killer a free kill, they end up being the most toxic pieces of shit in end game chat.
---
Last Year.
---
The material doesn't look comfortable..

Thanks

Imagine if they made a show with Ash from DBD

Evolve? Dead

Death garden? Dead

Deceit? Dead

Dead by daylight really is special it seems (other than the fact it has "dead" in it's name like 70% of these kinda games)

Thank you! And thanks for the suggestion - it does look a little high
---
I think prayerbeads will cancel out her terror radius not showing it tbh or has there been videos? I‚Äôm a console player so I don‚Äôt have ptb
---
I didn't misunderstand anything. I wasn't talking directly to you, as I figured you were aware of it. It was for new players, not you.
---
its literally not that bad. If you whine about NOED out of all things, then well yeah ofc im going you're bad since again, it's fairly easy to counter.
---
While the price seems a bit steep for the product in question, I honestly don't see how this could be considered cringy?
---
Did the same to a Claudette with Ghost Face. 
---
She and another teammate were waiting at the gate too and I pretended to go away, then I one shot her since she was still marked.
---
Never get too comfortable.
---
*‚ÄùHe‚Äôs a good killer‚Äù
---
Dear god no.... he‚Äôs not
---
My hoodie: DS, Unbreakable. Inner strength, head on.
---
And how is he not?
---
1. Survivors have a lot of pallets, most of which can be looped for a significant amount of time; strong windows on some maps, toolboxes, keys, Lithe, Balanced Landing, Borrowed Time, etc.
---
2. If you are getting hit shortly after using Dead Hard, you're using it wrong. You should be using it to guarantee a window vault/extra pallet loop without getting hit.
---
3. Wraith is one of the worst Killers in the game. Even with Ghost and Coxcombed Clapper, you can just look out for him. At best, he'll get one free hit, then you loop him like any other Killer.
---
Oops my mistake then.
---
Plague, negates my med kit and healing perks :(
---
hahahahaha
---
well you're ruining the fun for 4 other people in the game and i wish people like you didn't play team games. play a 1v1 game if you don't care about leaving everyone else stuck in a shit match
---
He has no pressure and his power is pretty mediocre for what it‚Äôs supposed to do. Clown will never be able to compete against an optimal team
---
Expensive and cheaply made hmmmmm
---
I wish this community could discuss anything without it devolving into an X vs Y unrelated topic. 
---
Perk discussion: Noed and Adrenaline get brought up somehow. 
---
Weak/Underperforming Killer buff: something about Spirit or Freddy comes up. 
---
Map design: ‚Äúwe need unfun loops in order to play‚Äù vs ‚Äúmaps should be flat 4head‚Äù
---
Gen speed adjustment: genrush 4head vs apply pressure 5head
---
People who do X thing in game is annoying: WELL WHAT ABOUT WHEN Y DOES SOMETHING UNRELATED 1111!1!1!1!1!1
---
I‚Äôm very thankful the devs aren‚Äôt taking anything ever said on the subreddit seriously in terms of feedback. They aren‚Äôt taking much feedback seriously so it‚Äôs a double edge.
---
I mean I think it makes the most sense but it should be a combo of kills and hooks because you shouldn't he punished if a survivor team gets too altruistic and you one hook them all.
---
Restart your console/pc. It was happening to me after the servers got fixed and I restarted about 3 times and it started working fine
---
You can adjust it so it's in between op and terrible.
---
I agree that they did a great job, but I really miss the old Freddy. I used to main him, but he plays so differently now, I've moved on to other killers.
---
The only reason I would ever bring franklens would be if I see a team bringing keys, flashlights, or toolboxes.
---
I find myself frustrated at way more survivor games than killer games... but then again I do solo queue
---
Show us your old freddy rework idea
---
His power is basically a automatic map pressure tool and can easily snowball unless survivors are 24/7 on each other healing
---
That makes sense lol
---
I really wish BHVR changed WGLF to actually do something instead of BP gains. BBQ has an actual functionality, and it is a good perk even without the BP gains...WGLF needs some extra aura reading.
---
Removed someone posted this before you https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e2762g/shrine_of_secrets_112619/
---
Extended invincibility frames.
---
Yeah thats what I thought as well, had some real toxic flashlights teams that I wish I could have punished
---
At level 3 Hope is low key better lmao.
---
Still like it though
---
Do what u want man but maybe don't be so self centered around the game
---
Is that actually a thing or could it be a connection issue?
---
Franklin's Demise, Iron Maiden, Self-Care, and WGLF
---
Comforting ding-dong.
---
I just play Freddy to have fun y u have to be mad
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if the pallet gets dropped right away. You chase 1 person and then what 2 gems pop. Cause no way you‚Äôre hooking a good survivor in less than 30 secs with clown. Good teams destroy him
---
Same! Except my lobby had a Rank 2 and a Rank 4 instead of the two Rank 7s. END ME.
---
Another Shrine, another week without Make Your Choice.
---
It can probably be considered taking the match hostage if you have the entire match recorded for evidence. (after you reported them the post trial screen or it does nothing)
---
And HIGHLY doubt their clip would be sufficient enough for a ban so wasted effort on their part.
---
then why dont you just suicide to the killer every game like that? you can insta kill yourself on hook basically and even though it may still fuck over your teammate, atleast you're fucking over one less person
---
Okay but remember in 2017 they tried to tell us Hag got more 4ks than Nurse
---
..Ever heard of Ruin? Or knowing when to give up chase to find someone easier? Or using power effectively? I dunno what to tell you, since i've had tremendous success against SWFs that were good.
---
Freddy can grab people off gens during the Dream Transition.
---
Skill Checks do not wake you up, but clocks do (any clock not just the furthest away)
---
Instead of an action speed penalty, Survivors suffer from more frequent, and harder skillchecks.
---
Freddy knows when he is and is not visible during the Dream Transition
---
I don't mean literally camping by staying at hook. I mean something like this: http://www.twitch.tv/ohtofu/v/513390639?sr=a&amp;t=19863s
---
I'm complaining about hag using her ability because it is literally made for camping like I said originally.
---
I sometimes get 4ks as killer and barely pip. I know it was worse before where people were black pipping with 4ks but recently I've seen some killers do really well 2 hooking every survivor they escape but they de-pip.  
---
As survivor while yes i barely 2 pip but I never de-pip either and sometimes I even pip when I feel like I shouldn't have.
---
Is pipping the issue or something else? I'm not sure. Just sharing my experience.
---
Lol ruin doesn‚Äôt matter against good players. Da fuck?
---
It looks that the killer wanted to farm or get an achievement
---
its normal
---
After a year of silence, they're adding what everybody always wanted: PvE against AI Spiders!
---
Slugging everyone and they DC. Imagine my surprise.
---
I haven't seen these SWF balance things that people have been talking about, but proximity chat sounds like it would give survs a somewhat unnecessary buff and red ranks would be even more hell then it already is.
---
playing in a way where I'm permanently in a chase and getting mad enough that i slugged to d/c. entitled survivor alert
---
Both survivor perks actually make teamplay worse. 
---
And Franklin's isn't even that good, only popular because of the hate-boners towards flashlights.
---
Like I said. Git gud with him. Not my fault you can't play him well at high ranks.
---
This mask is already a confirmed cosmetic. Look it up, it looks just like the picture.
---
Nhu uh. Nerf reason and logic they are overpowered.
---
*good*
---
Because Myers now can be pantsless...and the case is closed
---
Honestly, I would rather have a search option where you type in the perk you want to find and it narrows down the options until you find said perk, then select it that way.
---
THIS JUST HAPPENED WITH ME. LIKE, JUST NOW.   
---
I killed everyone with a tier 3. 1 tier 3, 4k, 5 gens left. It was the luckiest I ever got.   
---
The guy in chat actually said he was happy for me and that I did good, we complimented each other, said gg, and went our ways. Best match for me as Myers ever in DBD.
---
&gt;As significant as Legion being nerfed again?
---
Everything I've heard about legion on the PTB is that he's being buffed.
---
&gt;As the Nurse nerf? As the Spirit nerf?
---
Maybe? It's certainly subjective. They're seriously hurting one of the most popular and competitive perks survivors have.
---
&gt;As killers getting a pretty much useless killer (Demogorgon)
---
Demo has good pressure and an ability that helps in chases. If you're seriously struggling, you might want to look inward.
---
&gt;a Billy knock off killer
---
Just to be clear, you're whining about getting an alternate to one of the strongest killers in the game? 
---
&gt;or having three unplayable killers (clown, doc, pig)
---
I watch streamers do well with those killers. Again, I think your issue here is a personal one.
---
None of the shit you mentioned invalidates what people are saying about BL.
---
As a Myers main this is true
---
Is that a skin she‚Äôs gonna get when she comes out !
---
Wait what where can I get one
---
Git gud with a mediocre killer lol. He‚Äôs so good that‚Äôs why everyone uses him right? Yeah man all those really good streamers who get shit on when they play him should just get better. You‚Äôre clearly the best
---
Nope.
---
i downed 3 people right on top of each other. and everytime i downed one, another was in lunge range. why would i ever not slug there? to make the shit survivor feel better?
---
He probably tried to do an archive. Whole game played normally, so I wanted to suicide for him in the end, but instead he waited for me to get out of trap and didn't down, so I stepped into another one. After that he just let us go.
---
He's not good for *everyone.* It's literally like hag. If you don't get the playstyle, you're not going to do well with him. Not my fault he's not a fit for you.
---
Myers is always a fun game I feel he‚Äôs the perfect balanced killer
---
There are two types of megs, megmainsmallbrain and megmainbigbrain
---
As cringe as I remember I see.
---
Jesus you couldnt sound more cringe
---
Good for her
---
Franklins can be fun if you see you are going against sweaty toolbox/key SWF. It's not a good perk but it is situationally hilarious.
---
WGLF gives Bloodpoints. Bloodpoints good. Survivor want Bloodpoints. WGLF good.
---
Here's a downvote for you.
---
Haven't they one one already?
---
Thanks for the advice
---
"afraid"
---
More like "don't want to do a fuckton of work". All the killer animations like hooking, picking up survivors, getting stunned, etc function the same because of the human-shaped rigs. As are things like walking and swinging a weapon. It's a 3D rig they reskin with each killer. By doing something that isn't two legs and two arms, they couldn't use all the existing work and would have to create new animations, which is a lot of work. 
---
I imagine that Last Year possibly doesn't suffer from the goddamn spaghetti code that is DBD.
---
That‚Äôs why I always by the dlc without hesitation. I gotta collect them all!
---
Your the type of man to dip your toast in butter rather than butter it arnt you
---
Do you have an issue with Daddy?
---
You're welcome
---
If the opponent states they are female, switch daddy for mommy
---
It does seem like those antlers are cut and placed forward. I am guessing there is a width limit for killers so they don't clip through windows and doorframes.
---
That‚Äôs why I buy the DLCs immediately. Gotta collect them all!
---
Yes.
---
Is.... locker perk at bottom worth it? Only one I don't have nor do I know the name of.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not like he can take way too long during one chase, they‚Äôre always just too optimal according to him
---
Ngl I don‚Äôt think it makes much of a difference in points... like in your example if you‚Äôd have hooked them all you‚Äôd have only hooked them once each and not get many points for chase etc so would still black pip. And as for survivors in games that I‚Äôd leave they‚Äôd be dead anyways.
---
Yeah, the fact that it only gives extra points encourages farming your own teammates. Almost every time I'm unhooked in front of the Killer it's by someone using WGLF. I combined that perk with Deliverance and Borrowed Time to make it seem more worthwhile for both me and whoever I unhook.
---
Christ, you're right!
---
With the US rights for A Nightmare on Elm Street reverting back to the Craven Estate; BHVR must've lost the right to sell the DLC or make any cosmetics for the Chapter.
---
No-one can force BHVR to revoke people's access to the DLC, if they've already bought it. So this shouldn't mean too much.
---
It really is a thing unfortunately
---
&gt;Trapper: If an injured Survivor steps in a Bear Trap, they cannot escape on their own or they'll be put in the dying state.
---
So a purple addon for free yikes, trapper is near top tier if this becomes base kit imo
---
&gt;Wraith: A cloaked Wraith is completely invisible when more than 16m away
---
I could live with this
---
&gt;Doctor: Remove Treatment and Punishment mode. Doctor attacks with M1 and uses Shock Therapy with M2. His Static Field activates when he uses Shock Therapy and lasts for a short duration.
---
Remove doctor from the game thx
---
&gt;Cannibal: Breaking a pallet does not end Bubba's chainsaw frenzy, but it does reset his acceleration.
---
Free spirit fury enduring with an instadown yikes your high as fuck since survivors are locked in an animation for the pallet drop they always go down.
---
&gt;Clown: A fully charged bottle inflicts the Exposed status effect if it hits the Survivor directly, and a stronger Hindered effect if it does not.
---
Again your just giving people pink addons and calling it balanced. no.
---
&gt;Legion: Rework them lol I got nothing.
---
Delete them too thx.
---
On the DBD store. Be warned, it's expensive
---
Ya that was just him hitting her during her invincibility stage of being unhooked, if he swung a tiny bit later it would've downed her

SPIDER MOUTHS DON'T WORK THAT WAY.
---
I mean, er, I actually think this is cool and wonder what the spider's power or unique gimmick is. 
---
And I also feel kinda bad for Last Year. They were so worried about the game being buggy or not smooth at launch that they spent an extra YEAR in development, only to launch into the grave. From what I observed at launch, people played it a little, said "there's no progression" and bailed. So I hope they add some kinda progression.

---
Dang, first time I‚Äôve actually had more then half of the perks up, but the only one I don‚Äôt have this week is Franklin‚Äôs Demise. Time to enrage survivors :D
---
i think its p cool looking, if not a little cheap and uncomfy
---
I explained why, to make it so skill is more of a deciding factor than luck.
---
See the Pool example
---
"gg ez noob killer" that's one of the reasons why i don't play killer. im too sensitive.
---
I mean....duh.
---
Well, it's a mix of 3. The first is shineclear's Colorful Icon pack, the second is nebula pack with happy clown, and the last one (the wall with graffiti for bl) I don't remember the name of, unfortunately. I originally had the third one and the second one, because the third one was incomplete so I had to mix it with the second one. I'm moving over to shineclear's because I like it better.
---
What is Honing Stone changed to as Trapper gets it's effect as base?
---
This feels like a nerf to my finger as I now have to spam a button to keep my field active. (Also how long is a "short duration" exactly?)
---
What is Redhead's Pinky Finger changed to as Clown (essentially) gets its effect as base?
---
That's a funny way to say buff them with even more DLC perks while also nerfing them in unnecessary places. (seriously rework when)
---
I play for fun. I don't have enough time in my day to bleed out to death on the floor on DBD when I can leave and get into a game where the Killer will actually give me an interactive/fun experience.
---
You open by saying that you slugged all game. Do you think any of the other 4 people you were playing with were having fun?
---
 If you don't care about that, I don't see why people should care about your pip or fun either.
---
If you want to slug 1 guy to go for a chase sure, but if you find yourself slugging people for the entirety of the game that's another matter entirely.
---
Your post about your teeth is cringier than this sweater lol
---
I entirely agree minus the legion. I like the idea its just poorly done. Rework them but can doctor
---
Because survivors DC against Doc. I mean 3 letters into Doctor's name you can spell "DC" with 2 of them.
---
It‚Äôs good on huntress. It‚Äôs a good counter to survivors trying to counter bbq.
---
Ah understandable thank you for your reply :D
---
Who's "we"? Because the previous killer pip system (where only hooks/kills mattered) was awful.
---
I don't like this thing. Agree with me reddit and gove me karma
---
I was too excited over what it could have been to notice T_T
---
Did the game do that bad that they're shutting it down?
---
They need to add two things to that perk:
---
1) An additional stacking option that doesn't require farming your teammates. Doing totems or searching chests or something like that, encourage other objectives on the map, literally nothing bad will happen to the game if you add that.
---
2) Some basic aura reading. Nothing too crazy, maybe see survivors *within* 40m of the hooked person for 4s so you know if someone is already waiting for the save or not. 
---
Or scrap both WGLG+BBQ and make those stacking BP bonuses into a basic game mechanic.

People just not playing. They tried to relaunch it but it failed again
---
How it feels playing ghost face when you have shroud active
---
physical blood pools are separate from onis power
---
We‚Äôre not discussing do I know how to play him or not. He‚Äôs literally just trash. No one uses clown for a reason he has nothing going for him and if he wasn‚Äôt so bad people would give him a chance. Any killer can do good against low ranks
---
Repost.
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one.
---
It‚Äôs ok lol I just got my first save a couple ago to a baby wraith after 7 months

why waste points on self care, it sandbags your team.
---
The last perk I needed from David. Excellent.
---
Jeff.
---
Distortion let's you know if the Killer has Bitter Murmur, BBQ as well as Nurses Calling. Once you know that (after losing a token) you can adapt your playstyle accordingly.
---
Me too! I wasn't gonna play tonight but since self care is on there I have to
---
I made this
---
Some perks are too strong, no matter if there is counterplay to them. Ruin and Noed being examples. If you rely on those two, that‚Äòs all I need to know, too.
---
Matchmaking should be priority for devs tbh
---
I see someone complaining on here everyday that they should start doing it.  I dont think should switch back, Im just pointing out how nobody looks into anything or actually thinks
---
sounds
---
I was thinking more about the other survivors on ur team
---
I didn't buy Beast of Prey in the last shrine thinking BHVR will nerf that perk's snergy with the Legion's deep wound timer so I decided to wait for this...
---
..might have as well purchased it damnit
---
[Link](http://www.mediafire.com/file/x6tyly4d32mmdt5/The_Obsession_Perk_Pack_by_Geistra.zip/file)
---
I think so too. Just pulls me down, I was really excited to get back into it, just for it to continue exactly where it left off.
---
What going on with kindred?
---
Draw them in the itty bitty corner so they feel left out
---
I‚Äôm starting to see a lot more iron will + resilience.  Didn‚Äôt know it was that good lol
---
TBF she has good perks for her rank. All 3, 2 Hag teachables. I'm sure she doesn't have a difficult time against rank 17s.
---
Youre not?  You get the same amount of pip progression for 4 hooks regardless of who theyre on
---
Oh so survivors have to care about making the game fun but killers don‚Äôt? Gotcha
---
And a 3 man would be a 75% but everyone is lower than 75%. So there are games like that where the survivors destroy you, but they are few and far between for most good killers.
---
Hmmmm me no see red ranks
---
Truth
---
Generally as soon as you hear a: "hauh" make a sudden 45¬∞~ turn to either durrection. It isn't a guaranteed dodge but it is really all you can do in the open. Otherwise break line of sight and take harsh turns in jingle gyms.
---
Buff what exactly?
---
Thats me when they destroy hex ruin.
---
I don't believe so.
---
Now ur just missing the point to make ur narrative be about the killer which is another argument but dcs hurt other survivors the most
---
Ok. I only said that the killers have one thing that can turn a lost round into a won round. It did countless times and that's just facts. Aswell as the hatch can turn a lost round for one survivor (or more than one if there is a key) into a won round. Now yes the NOED can be broken (before the endgame begins) but the same way the hatch can be closed or the last two people slugged. It's a luck game with both of them since totem spawns are random aswell as the hatch.
---
I agree that the hatch is stupid and I think truetalents proposal of a new endgame is much better. But the same way NOED is stupid and should be removed/reworked. It's both times rewarding not playing good and that's just retarded.
---
But go on. Downvote my comments cause I'm stating my opinion. I'm wouldn't expect anything else from people in this community.
---
Factssssss
---
It will also activate (for you) when anybody gets hooked.
---
DBD's version of the ping system from Apex Legends would work really well in this game.
---
When I said low ranks I meant bad players sorry. Idc what a number says people playing optimally against a clown shut him down. He doesn‚Äôt have control of the match
---
Nah, thats called not being toxic. I was once like that, and have since become toxic to match. Whenever I do something that gets whine commonly, I just have my quips ready. If the lobby is cool, I just dont use them, but theres usually at least one mouthy survivor.
---
Its a shame that the options are to skip the chat (Why play against humans that you can't interact with? It may as well be bots at that point imo), be toxic too, or just quietly accept people being a dick over a video game.
---
I've seen this before either today or yesterday though. Same exact meme.
---
Yeah he hasn‚Äôt really gotten buffed so it‚Äôs either the popularity of the cosmetic or just a run of bad luck. I wouldn‚Äôt let this get you down though a lot has changed and the new chapter is coming in December so that‚Äôs more new content

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e27myu/survivor_teabagging_vs_iridescent_head_huntress/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
* Most crossposts are automatically removed, as they are typically unreleated to Dead by Daylight.
---
Cannibal change is a nerf. It will never lead to a down and actually causes a slower recovery than normal from destroying a pallet.
---
If you one hook and kill everyone you black pip. Its not the killer's fault for poor decisions of the survivors.
---
Yo. That's wild.
---
I messed it up and I had to change something
---
I'd love to play against you then.
---
No point in arguing against someone who refuses to listen to any points made, and not even try to consider his merit. Have a good one.
---
Because half the time my team doesn't care about healing me so they fuck off once I'm unhooked lol. Its rare that I meet teamplayers as a solo player
---
Ok yeah I won‚Äôt make the argument about that but why should I have to endure a shit game if it‚Äôs gonna be shit for all of us? Me leaving ain‚Äôt gonna make it more shit in most scenarios because the game is just unbalanced atm.
---
Insidious on pig.... that‚Äôs next level...üòê
---
Yeah since I (almost) always play solo it's going to be my new meta.
---
"Let me just slide on out..."
---
I use it with lithe and occasionally quick and quiet in every build. It‚Äôs extremely effective at losing the killer.
---
Billy and Huntress. Most balanced killers in chase and fun to loop
---
Everyone else I don‚Äôt like because they‚Äôre annoying in chase (Freddy, Clown) or simple M1 killers to loop (Pig, Wraith)
---
And fuck Ghostface and his bugged power
---
My guy spitting bare facts üò§
---
Its the "omg lag" spam you love, now in slideshow format!
---
Ah yes because I said I was amazing at the game lol. Your points aren‚Äôt true so idk what you‚Äôre trying to say. Imagine being an m1 killer where your power doesn‚Äôt even work lol.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e27o2e/solo_survivors_should_be_able_to_see_each_others/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I thought the previous one was only where hooks mattered. Because I've seen people used to get 4ks and de-pip
---
I don‚Äôt really know what there is to buff. Freddy is just a better Clown in ever way, in my opinion. His snares are better than the bottles because you can place them beforehand, use them freely, and don‚Äôt have to reload. 
---
I just don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôd buff. I‚Äôm no expert at the games mechanics though so somebody correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.
---
no, i want the d/c punishment to force people to play the game they queued up to play literally every single team game has that. when someone d/cs they take away a lot of the potential bp and rank. i also don't have all day to play this game which is why every games bp matters. if the game properly accounted for all the lost bp from d/cs and gave it to me, i wouldn't care. and look if you don't wana be slugged, 1) bring an anti slug perk and 2) DONT STAND IN FRONT OF ME IN MB1 RANGE AS I DOWN ONE GUY. i literally omly slugged because they told me to by giving me free downs
---
Oh, I thought you meant you get 4 individual hools and escape.  Anyways, that's not necessarily true, it depends on your rank.  You still get 4/6 of your hook pip progression per survivor, so you still get 16 points of pip progression which if I recall correctly is a gold, but I dont have it pulled up.
---
Honing Stone activates if the survivor is healthy or injured.  This requires the Survivor to already be injured
---
you also forget barbaque. i only got like 15-20k points in comparison to the 60ish k i woulda gotten otherwise
---
This was actually really funny, IDK what caused this, though.
---
had a game today that refused to unhook me because i was a ghost face main
---
Nope, you still have to pay full price for the DLC because the single recolor cosmetic from buying the DLC now costs $6.99
---
I never owned a Wii and I do it too
---
then bring a medkit, your not helping the team by self caring. PC players love to heal you, they just don't want to be dumb and heal under a hook without wmi
---
what
---
Pro gamers only
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
Wish my mic wasn't muted cause I was making some weird sounds during the whole thing.
---
But traps literally put you to injured automatically, are you saying you want to nerf traps to not injure?
---
it also set me back 4 sacrifices on my rift mission. the point is if you don't wana play, afk or suicide, but atleast don't d/c
---
That's what I'm trying to make sense of I guess. I believe if you get a 4k regardless (except maybe if Morries are used) then you should almost guarentee have a 2 pip.
---
how many times has this been an actual problem for you and not just a slight inconvenience? the only killer who could really abuse that system is the huntress, otherwise if you‚Äôre good enough, you can sneak in a few seconds on it, between hiding and such, until it opens. The game being harder at the end is the punishment for you not being better at the beginning.
---
Yeah. DBD is probably gonna win, but you can take one good look at MHW and see that it was a passion project for at least a few people. Just ignore the weapon design and it's wonderful. They've actually done a pretty good job so far.
---
I did thnx
---
Playing Clown since his release and boy it feels good to catch the survivors with those bottles
---
Love him, good asf
---
My personality traits as perks hoodie:

---
Your best teeth in the game post you made is a lot more cringe than this sweater.
---
We don't fucking know?
---
I'd like something where a random skill check pops up when you're not working on a generator or healing, and if you miss it, you go into the next stage. Every time it pops up, the odds of success get a little bit smaller.
---
WGLF encourages farming teammates. It also is missing the extra functionality that BBQ has.
---
the boogie chicklet tooth meme? why is it cringe its funny af xdxd
---
How else am I supposed to let everyone else know I'm Dead Hard?? &gt;.&gt;
---
I disagree.  The Survivors wouldn't get as much distance from Bubba than if he was forced to stop.  It depends on how it's implemented I suppose.  I think Bubba needs a rework
---
Ok, so im on console with a TV instead of a monitor set up so instead of playing on a sofa I play standing up. so instead of leaning forward I kinda hop around a bit and I swear to you it's the most gratifying feeling whenever you get hit. However when I get pallet stunned I fall back onto my bed (I play In my bedroom instead of the living room)
---
Why not let the unhooked or unhooker see the killers aura for 4 seconds if theyre not in X range
---
Don‚Äôt be fooled by Killer rank. I hover around there as a killer and I have 1000hrs. I just mostly play survivor. I know it‚Äôs messed up but it sure is fun playing 17s with Spirit stacked with tier 3 BBQ Discordance Ruin Overcharge
---
100% agreed that survivors need some built-in aura reading to level the playing-field between solo and SWF.
---
Additionally, they should just cave on communication and add voice chat to the game. Yes, it would be a shitshow, just like in every other game out there, which is why mute is a thing.
---
Finally, they should seriously nerf survivors in general. Ruin should just be the core gameplay of generator skill checks. Make the perk apply to healing instead.
---
Lorewise this pip progression makes sense, since the entity feeds on hope, so a quick match wouldnt necessarily be best.
---
No
---
it is a thing. it is to give survivors some what of a chance in cases like this when the killer just waits like that
---
Where is waifu Demogorgon?
---
&lt;3
---
Yeah Oni looks absolutely amazing.
---
Thanks for giving me a normal reply in a see of "DicK mE   DowN DaDdY"
---
It'll be a pretty nice substitute once it hits console. Same with Hunt: Showdown. The asymmetrical horror pool is gonna have some heavy hitters.
---
rank 6,6,8, and 5 btw.
---
No I'm saying this effect only applies if they were injured before they step in the trap
---
Your point is*... I disagree but maybe it‚Äôs just an opinion thing cos I don‚Äôt mind other people d/cing if I can understand why. In fact, I‚Äôm playing in between these messages and the killer just D/Cd because I was running him around for 3 gens and I just thought ‚Äúfair enough I feel bad for him‚Äù.
---
don't confuse imbalance unfun with you making the game less fun for everyone else in the game. want to complain about balance? sure but why punish the other players because of something the devs did? maybe the only killer someone has fun with is something everyone considers op so they all d/c. now that person can literally never even play the game he likes because he doesn't enjoy playing survivor or the other killers or lets take it to the extreme and everyone is always d/cing cuz of the balance so the game eventually dies
---
he blamed it on me for ‚Äúbodyblocking‚Äù the exit and he said he was trying to get the killer to me so I could get a flashlight blind but I warned him multiple times that leatherface would whip out his chainsaw and fuck his ass up but he ignored me anyway. Idk, this was just today lol
---
Sadly but yes that's true xd I guess bhvr needs to rework him but they have more important things to do now so we need to wait.
---
I just pointed out why it might‚Äôve been missing &gt;.&gt;
---
Idk how I was bodyblocking, I stood in the same place the entire time üò≠
---
hook them
---
Hook them?
---
Legit same. At least its on a free killer!
---
When im lunging around corners I even lean to account for that lmao
---
Ive read most of them. I was only interested in Jeff's story anyways. He left a dog when he was taken by the fog.
---
He doesn't need any shower, my mouth is the only thing he will ever need.
---
When I'm being a salty loser survivor boi, generally when I think a killer is trash it is because they facecamped and tunneled all game.
---
When the counter-strategy is "sit on gens and be bored as shit while someone else sits on a hook bored as shit", I'll usually opt for making suicide plays to... y'know... try and extract some fun out of the game.
---
If your strategy is terrible against players doing their best to win, but works well against players who are trying to enjoy the game (and still makes it unenjoyable), it is a trash cheese strat.
---
As a Myers main I smile
---
Well I can tell you some of the least fun killers to play against, at least for me are clown and trapper. Those games always just feel absurdly annoying and I rarely have fun in a match against one of the 2
---
Or their team DC‚Äôd and they also have no control over how good their team is. 
---
If I managed to be the last one left I definitely feel there should be a chance, but most killers I play against don‚Äôt even let that be a factor and just slug to victory.
---
Get better then
---
thats probably not possible without making some weird ass code to check for a past health state. The only way this would be possible is if traps didn't injure you immedietly but only upon being released and if you release yourself it does 1 health state of damage if injured or 1 health state regardless.
---
I don't play killer much but from my experience whenever I try my best to not tunnel/camp I usually only get 1 kill but that's probably since I suck at killer
---
That's so toxic no one should ever tell someone to put noed on. That's the biggest sin a survivor can make.
---
More like ol' unreliable when you get exhausted and go down at the same time
---
People think of different things when it comes to what skill floor means. Where you see a skill floor as a thresold or requirement to get value from a character, some people see it as the minimum value they can get from that character Picture a graph that goes to 1 to 10, measuring the amount of value you are contributing to a win.
---
For instance, in Overwatch you can pick a healer like Mercy, or Ana. Mercy has beam that locks on to players and heals for her; she is very simple to play and understand, so even with minimal skill the value she contributes to the team will never be below 5, a High skill floor.
---
Now Ana is a sniper who needs to aim her heal darts, and is very vulnerable to flanks, so a new player is very likely to not contribute much to her team, meaning with minimum skill as Ana the value she provides is 0-1, a LOW skill floor.
---
Skill Ceilings are the same but inverted. Mercy's contribution will never be rubbish, but in return her maximum potential is not very high. Her value will never go beyond 7, 7 is her skill ceiling. Ana's potential drastically goes up as a more skilled player masters her, where the value she can contribute goes up to 9-10, this is Ana's skill ceiling.
---
Sorry for the wall of text I just feel bad for this guy aith downvotes, the fact that there are TWO definitions of skill ceilings and floors means everyone gets confused. A skill floor being a measure of skill required is valid as well, though personally it is less intuitive to me.
---
And BHVR‚Äôs response is to change it so you can‚Äôt tell he‚Äôs a rank 18 until post game..... instead of fixing matchmaking.
---
I forget wich killer that is
---
I think that the game dying because someone refuses to play anything but broken killers is a bit excessive. Also I‚Äôm not getting confused I‚Äôm saying I d/c because of game imbalance. I‚Äôm not getting into an argument about overpowered because you can argue that a perfect swf can beat any killer but I‚Äôm saying I really think it‚Äôs not that awful to d/c if you‚Äôre not having fun and know the game‚Äôs not gonna be fun.
---
Bing bong*
---
Doesn't matter if she is not played anymore by all the people that mained her.
---
Eu penso que n√≥s fizemos um bom trabalho at√© agora
---
That's not hard to code in you know
---
Maybe people don't use him as much because there are also other killers?
---
He's very good if you can do a bit more than throw a bottle at a survivor and m1. His perks (aside from clownrophohia or smth like that) help a ton if you use them correctly.
---
If you gave every killer full gen control and perfect chase techniques and whatever the fuck you think is good for a killer the game would have no survivors.
---
I love belly boi and he is pretty much my main at this point since I have lots of fun and 3-4k constantly
---
I'm talking about in general. I could follow them far from the hook and they'd prioritize a gen over my health state lmao.
---
The only buff I really want to see is the add on ‚Äúrule set no 2‚Äù is in her base power. Survivors shouldn‚Äôt be able to see jigsaw boxes until the headset is powered on imo.
---
I am one lol I have the pink mask and skateboard
---
Yikes
---
Did not realize hanging out around hooked survivors was frowned upon. Won't do that anymore. But didn't do it that run for sure. They all just disconnected within seconds of each other .
---
I don't play a lot but when I was a rank 18 killer I got matched with a rank 18 player with almost 4000 hours, yes 4k, in the game, according to their profile. They were much better than I and they were toxic af. It's a weird system.
---
Oh okay, didn‚Äôt know this, ty for the information!
---
The Trapper played by Danny Devito
---
I mean as long as you're not camping or tunneling everything you do is up to you and your play style, for more experienced players putting traps on gens is a waste of time but its effective on the beginner ranks.
---
Imagine playing trapper at red ranks and 4k ing 70% of the time with no ruin.... no ed, bbq or any other reliance perks.
---
My room is knee high with the amount of sweat I exfoliate
---
I don't think you've ever played Billy. His chainsaw isn't just for "long range attacks". This billy is just really bad.
---
It likely is as it stopped many people from even trying the game out. It's sad that if it was released now no one would be surprised by the mtx.
---
It‚Äôs always good to play both sides. You start to understand what the other side goes through which makes for a healthy community.
---
Fair enough. I did literally just start playing yesterday
---
You've got to tell me what they said.
---
An optimal team is really hard to beat with most killers. At least he can shut down loops.
---
D A R N
---
And this is why OPs idea will never happen, unfortunately. Too much lobby dodging.
---
Well, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you as I have no idea wtf that means. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è People will be mad for a lot of different reasons, just try to enjoy learning the game though! Play both sides and you‚Äôll get a good understanding of things.
---
As someone who plays solo , this is something I really am happy about
---
Being full-price killed Evolve.
---
Perhaps you‚Äôre onto something ü§î would be hard to balance tho
---
When I'm breaking a pallet and the survivor has a flashlight, I want them to blind me. It means that I'm not losing that much distance even though I had to break the pallet.
---
Hope is god tier looping
---
What's that?
---
Except every time I do that the killer fakes going back to the other gate
---
Myers is the simplest, in my experience. Swings knife. Swings knife harder. If you screw up stalk you have to hit people twice instead of once. He‚Äôs good for learning the base game. Not a lot to keep track of.
---
You're thinking in such absolutes. Like the only thing that makes a killer "good" is if they can beat the best players every time. It's a question of playstyle and skill and less the killer.
---
Denied. Give ME karma.
---
If I know they have it and I‚Äôve done everything I want to do as survivor I usually just give them the kill because it‚Äôs a hard ass achievement to get
---
Yup, if you‚Äôre on PS4 and someone doesn‚Äôt get injured within the first 30 seconds, it‚Äôs a Ghostface.
---
If you decide to keep using trapper put traps on tall grass, put traps on windows like in the killer shack. Also idk if you've played some survivor but if yoy havent go play a bit so you can experience how survivors loop the killer and understand their routing, this will give you an idea of where to put traps. Not gonna lie a high end real red rank Trapper main is scary.
---
Good luck, hope you like the game and stay to experience morw of it.
---
PS the community is pretty toxic but dont let it bother you
---
Give them to the huntress I heard they trade cells for them sometimes...
---
That‚Äôs... literally what makes a killer good or not. If they can‚Äôt stand against good players they‚Äôre trash it‚Äôs simple. Any killer can do well against bad players so how am I wrong?
---
Why is there a chunk taken out of the Asian brain?
---
Sounds like (from the message and other comments) you didn't really do anything wrong. Probably just a bitchy SWF group, or an unlucky SWF group who had the lobby drop them on Playstation. (It's happened to me and my friend before, where my friends will just be randomly kicked from the game, and some times random survivors will get kicked.) 
---
Not your fault. Only thing I could see them bitch about there is their connection to you, since PS doesn't have dedicated servers yet, but it's their job to check their connection first- not yours.
---
It‚Äôs really strange. I reinstalled too and had no chance to recheck it. I did read the description, but just like the dedicated servers it was really finicky. I wasn‚Äôt sure who to believe in anymore LOL.
---
The Crapper played by Danny Devito
---
Applying hindered on a basic attafk is fucking broken. As is an incurable pig trap.
---
maybe? but i think a good starting point(atleast for the killer side) is a 25% increase to all bp for every d/c since theres 4 survivors and also if a survivor you never hooked d/cs, you get their stack of barbeque(at the very least they should make that change to barbeque). 25% per d/c may be too low or too high, but its a good starting point. the killer d/cing is where i see it being really hard to compesate the survivors adequately
---
Just level up The Pig.
---
Just got out of a thread where a dude said he'll simply disconnect if he "isn't having fun" in a match. People tried telling him it was unfair to the others, but he cared not.
---
It should be a 4 man you keep add ons you don‚Äôt have to run add on‚Äôs for survivor, but it drastically helps killers. If killers keep addons nearly every game, the balance of the game would shift. Someone could use the same overpowered addons every game whilst only having one of each.
---
Level her up.
---
And Pig.
---
I always bring reload add ons, I feel like they‚Äôre the most useful without being ‚Äúscummy‚Äù
---
You arent supposed to win this scenario. What part of 4v1 dont survivors understand? Its a similar argument to being able to wiggle off the killers shoulder easier. You guys constantly want ways to negate a killers hard work. 
---
Did the killer stop you from completing any gens? Too bad for him Hatch spawns.
---
Did the killer get to the hatch first? Too bad now that gates are powered. 
---
Now you guys want those gates to always spawn spread far apart? Its not enough that survivors get multiple chances to not lose? Even if the killer does amazingly vs the worst survivors in the game there is still 2 RNG opportunities for one of them to escape. If thats not a participation trophy i dont know what is.
---
Thinking like main killer, no thanks, because I would permanently have ninja builds for michael, hag and wraith x, d and many pink addons
---
Shit post that contributes nothing.
---
-from a Pig main.
---
After transitioning they're 40% more likely to kill themselves, instead of encouraging them and making a mental illness a fad you should treat it as a fucking mental illness you goddamn clowns.
---
Was a rank 20 killer a few weeks ago in my second game ever, was playing nurse because I know the learning curve is steep with her but if I can learn her early then I‚Äôll be in good shape, got placed into a match on Hawkins with rank 8-10 survivors
---
I shall make another meme then
---
VIBE CHECK
---
The acid pallet thing should probably be a very/ultra rare addon tbh.
---
I get a 4 man on Ormond and I get 4 messages calling me toxic for not letting the last guy have the hatch that I carried him past
---
This sounds like it has potential.
---
Except you have to walk around the entire time or else you waste it lmao
---
So it‚Äôs still working when yourself gets hooked? I thought they were getting rid of that and making it that only you can see when other survivors get hooked.
---
You can already see ranks on pc
---
Humanoid is not equivalent to human. It is simply referring to having a human like shape, i.e traditional standing upright on 2 legs, with a torso, 2 arms, and a head. Demogorgon fits that description.
---
Unless BHVR wants to go beyond and actually rework core mechanics like carrying survivors, hooking, breaking pallets, getting blinded, vaulting, etc. They are restricted to humanoid beings.
---
im alright with the top one because the nightmare is honestly such a good killer. i get 4ks almost every time i play him. he is underrated.
---
DBD just needs a damn graphics overhaul, especially lighting.
---
Hahaha no problem
---
Same here. I always ran Kindred anyway but now it‚Äôll never leave my kit
---
This kinda stuff always happens to me
---
I love throwing appreciation at good players. You provide a challenge, good sportsmanship, fun, entertainment? You get a praise!!! Who cares about win or lose? It's nice to be nice! :3
---
I just love it as spiteful perk and I think that's the point. Just use a perk slot to directly annoy the survivors.
---
That was everyone's misconception based on the wording they used in the patch notes, because in the patch notes they only write down what's changed.
---
I played the PTB and yep it's both now :)
---
I think Overwatch does something pretty similar to that which I really like
---
I‚Äôm sure it will work, there‚Äôs always one curious player!
---
I main killer, they need to add a little graphic at the end of the game indicating whos partied. Im only saying this because there are tons and tons of killers, and some streamers who always blame any amount of coordination on SWF goon squads. Plenty of people will bodyblock, go for pallet saves or just be a team player without having to be in a party. If the killer had to accept that they got booty blasted by 4 solo players,  they might start looking at how to improve their gameplay instead of blaming the party system for every single loss.
---
It's a bug. It's in console too.
---
After buying pig for the memes sure
---
It's true, bhvr did a good job on big boi Mikey and im glad cause he deserves it!!
---
Bad take bud.
---
That‚Äôs so awesome then, I‚Äôm way more excited about it now! :)
---
Professionals have ***STANDARDS***
---
Pain in the but. But then ur team should just get 3 genny done to punish them
---
We killer mains don't associate with those who knowingly kill baby dweets.
---
First I saw Jaws now this....
---
Please do predator, Jeepers creepers and Chucky. 
---
Not necessarily in that order, but do Jeepers creepers first.
---
i see you dont understand how to use the perk properly
---
Killer legit makes my vertigo go crazy, I don‚Äôt know how people do it omg
---
Ugh... Way too salty for my liking.
---
i would like to make a follow up response here that i played LF all the way till i got BBQ teachable and until i got BBQ to tier 3 for hag(getting hex: ruin teachable next) and now I'm playing hag and it feels like i was playing the game in super hard mode before and easy mode now. getting nonstop 4ks with hag and skyrocketing my rank. while playing LF for that long was miserable, i now feel like rock lee after he took his leg weights off in his fight against gaara
---
I like playing against ghostface the pig or the plague because the provide a nice challenge
---
The same thing happened to me today, using the wraith to "catch" someone in the generator and freeze me long enough for the survivors to repair two gens
---
I mean like idk about you but I don‚Äôt like SB because I have to move at like a mile an hour which then I might as well bring urban evasion which is don‚Äôt get me wrong. When they are in use they are good but when they‚Äôre not it‚Äôs just.. AAAAAAA anyway thanks for listening to my shitty opinion

##The Tyrant
---
*Music: [Chase](https://youtu.be/pFgQRMVraYM)*
---
###Primary Weapon: Fists
---
###Power: Brute Force
---
The Tyant has a **power gauge** that fills up over time. Once this gauge is full, The Tyrant can **break through** certain surfaces. These surfaces include walls made of various materials. To activate the ability, **Brute Force**: approach a wall with highlighted markings, and **hold down the Power button**. Upon activating Brute Force, The Tyrant is granted a **10%** speed boost for **5 seconds**. After using this ability, the power gauge must refill (40 seconds), before Brute Force can be used again.
---
###Power: Evolve
---
Upon completion of the final generator, The Tyrant evolves into an even deadlier weapon. Once **Evolve** is activated, The Tyrant loses his clothing, and grows a large **blade** from his right arm (as well as other mutations). Additionally, the recovery period for attacks is reduced by **50%**, and The Tyrant's movement speed is increased by **5%**.
---
*The Tyrant has no Terror Radius. Only his footsteps can be heard while he moves.*
---
###Perks
---
**Persistence**
---
Your tenacity is unmatched. Bloodlust increases **5/10/15%** faster during chases.
---
**Killing Machine**
---
You were bestowed with heightened senses. The sounds of Injured Survivors can be heard from an additional **2/4/6 meters**.
---
**Gonna Give it to Ya**
---
You are determined to obliterate your prey. The Exposed status effect is applied for **10/15/20 seconds** to each Survivor who is on a generator when it's completed.
---
##Claire Redfield
---
*Music: [Lobby](https://youtu.be/tc7vlcXYc1g)*
---
**Mixed Herbs**
---
An assortment of plants capable of curing various ailments. Green, Red, Blue, and Yellow herbs are sparsely scattered throughout the map. You can carry one of each type of herb at a time. **Green Herbs** function identically to Self-Care, and **Blue Herbs** allow you to cure **Infected**, **Mangled**, and **Hemorrhage** (the same as Mending). **Red and Yellow Herbs** can only be used when combined with a Green Herb, and increase healing speed by **10/15/20%** each. If you possess all four types of herbs, you can cure all status effects and restore all health states within **3 seconds**. Additionally, herbs can be used to heal other Survivors.
---
**Resourceful**
---
You are adept at utilizing elements of your surroundings. Once per match, you can cause a generator to erupt in smoke, greatly reducing visibility in a **6/8/10 meter** radius. The smoke screen stays up for **5 seconds**.
---
**Tough as Nails**
---
Pain only strengthens your resolve. The duration of the speed boost applied when hit by the Killer is increased by **1/1.5/2 seconds**.
---
##Leon S. Kennedy
---
*Music: [Lobby](https://youtu.be/zSGPoLCY0xU)*
---
**Rookie Cop**
---
You have above-average athleticism and endurance. You are able to roll **1/1.5/2 meters** in any direction. Using **Rookie Cop** applies the **Exhausted** status effect.
---
**First-Aid Spray**
---
A canister of high-quality disinfectant. Once per match, restore a health state in **4/3/2 seconds**. **First-Aid Spray** can also be used on other Survivors, including ones who are Dying.
---
**Handgun**
---
You carry a firearm with you at all times. Start trials with a **Handgun** loaded with **7/8/9 rounds**. The Handgun has a maximum range of **16 meters**, and can be fired every **.3 seconds**. You cannot move while aiming the Handgun. Shooting the Killer stuns them for **.2 seconds**, but Shooting them while they're carrying a Survivor has no effect. If the Killer is shot more than **4** times within **10 seconds**, they become immune to subsequent shots for **15 seconds**. Once the Hangun runs out of ammo, it's discarded.
---
My two favourite games meet! :)
---
They need to get outside of the box with the killers. Basically all the original killers are roughly the same size and they are basically a different occupation. Clown, doctor, priest ,miner. We need giant spiders beasts aliens and other things once another game has enough unique killers it will have its foot in the door to be a real competition just because it's different.
---
Sucks
---
Yeah. He is going to get nerfed soon. He just cannot be countered at the moment.
---
Bubba and Billy had an orgy and the Oni is the product of that. 
---
Also Rin watched.
---
If your talking gameplay, yes. If youre talking story and lore, I think not.
---
Billy
---
More like unreliable. Never works for me.
---
I button mash o right when I know it's her
---
Custom perk hoodies would be cool
---
It's tough. The perk itself is only going to help you plan your route, or maybe give you an idea of where to go if you unexpectedly end up in a chase and aren't familiar with your surroundings.
---
If you want to learn better looping skills, Fungoose is the best looper I've seen. He recently posted a video on looping the killer which I found very helpful. Keep in mind that this kind of looping requires a certain level of comfort with the map tiles, because there's a good deal of split second decision making when the killer chooses to do something.
---
https://youtu.be/k4aj0nEudnk
---
Lol I was trying to figure out if it was him who put the wrong acronym or me who was reading it wrong.
---
That's something you actually get burnt in your muscle memory if you play her a lot. All mechanics on her kit demand that you practice it until you're not even thinking about what you're doing which is pretty depressing all the time throughout
---
I agree. I have no strong opinion about it either way. It could be deleted tomorrow and I would be fine.
---
Have you ever even played Oni? Or you a killer main?
---
Ok scoops steve
---
I would leave it in: 3 kills, only one of the two addons can be maintained (random) and only a 50% chance of losing or maintaining it
---
Where do you find stats like that? I always wondered
---
Isn‚Äôt it supposed to be DemoGordon Ramsay?
---
&gt;Ladyboys
---
‡≤†œâ‡≤†
---
Stop bitching. The only reason BL was considered op was because it did too much for a exaustion perk, even when exausted.
---
You get bloodpoints for them DCing. Any more reward and you'll have even more SWFs DCing for the last person.
---
Shhhhhh don‚Äôt worry about it... I may have got it wrong but shhhh
---
Been thought she was bad
---
üôÑ
---
Because I asked a question? Sounds like you suck at reading because not once did I even talk or complain about Nurses changes. But feel free to keep patting yourself on the back.
---
Sounds fair, ultra rare add-ons would also be consumed regardless of how many kills they get
---
Bubba is best boy
---
How about a reload rework, such as you take 15 seconds to reload all of your bottles over time passively, but you can reload them one at a time. Any add ons that add bottles slightly increase the amount of time it takes to reload (slightly per bottle)
---
What. The. Fuck.
---
Huntress too?? Are these devs serious???
---
I like his power except for the fact that he gets it every 40 seconds. He can literally just be in a chase and break down a wall for no reason or downside and do it again later, eventually making all tile based loops dead zones and the only things that are safe are the environmental ones like garbage/cow trailer. Should be on a way longer cd.
---
&gt;Persistence
---
&gt;Your tenacity is unmatched. Bloodlust increases 5/10/15% faster during chases.
---
Neat i guess.
---
&gt;Killing Machine
---
&gt;You were bestowed with heightened senses. The sounds of Injured Survivors can be heard from an additional 2/4/6 meters.
---
Worthless
---
&gt;Gonna Give it to Ya
---
&gt;You are determined to obliterate your prey. The Exposed status effect is applied for 10/15/20 seconds to each Survivor who is on a generator when it's completed.
---
Honestly i like it. Could actually be combined with that demo perk that blocks stuff and bitter murmur to just shit on kids who do gens.
---
&gt;Mixed Herbs
---
Vigil and inner strength combined and worse. Nah.
---
&gt;Resourceful. You are adept at utilizing elements of your surroundings. Once per match, you can cause a generator to erupt in smoke, greatly reducing visibility in a 6/8/10 meter radius. The smoke screen stays up for 5 seconds.
---
But why?
---
&gt;You have above-average athleticism and endurance. You are able to roll 1/1.5/2 meters in any direction. Using Rookie Cop applies the Exhausted status effect.
---
So literally a worse deadhard
---
&gt;A canister of high-quality disinfectant. Once per match, restore a health state in 4/3/2 seconds. First-Aid Spray can also be used on other Survivors, including ones who are Dying.
---
So literally a worse inner strength
---
&gt;Handgun. You carry a firearm with you at all times.
---
stopped reading.
---
Ultra rare add-ons would be consumed regardless of how many kills they get
---
Because the dedicated servers are still being tested. They're not fully deployed yet.
---
Structural perfection is BUSTED if that % I'm seeing is how much the survivor is slowed down by. Either way, it's a good perk. Purity sounds like some good meme fun, and the killer overall looks cool as fuck. 10/10, would reccomend
---
On the other hand, he could be swf with someone
---
I loved object of obsession when I started playing because I didn‚Äôt realise the killer could see me. I thought he could just always see everybody, since I hadn‚Äôt played killer yet.
---
Just boring, thats it.
---
Lets be honest though. They never get 3 gennys done.
---
theres a pretty big difference between camping and "my bbq literally showed 1 person across the map so theres 2 people going for this save."
---
Got Spirit 2 weeks ago mainly for her perks so I'm still bad with her but decided to use my only Prayer Beads addon because of the incoming nerf as well as to see how it feels like to be of the opposite end and well...this is the result.
---
"kill 4 survivors with reverse bear traps during the endgame collapse. must be done in a single trial"
---
Literally 99% of slug DC's are to [give their buddy hatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dzehjw/tactical_disconnect_incoming/?st=k3gmmiqt&amp;sh=cb394482) when the killer wants a 4K.
---
Bleeding out at most takes 4 minutes. If you've been in a 10/15  minute game and would rather DC and forfeit all your BP out of spite that's on you.
---
Happy cake day
---
From winning the tournament for Earthrealm to immediately dying to shitty teammates in purgatory. Fun times. 
---
Why won‚Äôt Raiden save her. Oh right....he‚Äôs a bitch.
---
I run hope and adrenaline. I‚Äôm fast as fuck boiii
---
what did he say?
---
Simply outplayed
---
The harder you start the easier it will get. Hopefully
---
I have. Doesnt make it any less weird.
---
Assuming they don‚Äôt have bbq and just stand around though?
---
Definitely can't prove you wrong haha
---
Sometimes it just fucks up and the input lag is shit but when it works it works.
---
Us switch players are happy with any of these unobtainable perks. 
---
Now to wait for BBQ üòî
---
survivor entitlement intensifies
---
believe it or not the killer wants to rank up and have fun too. be mad.
---
I was just thinking that skin looks sick
---
Can you elaborate? I just unlocked SB and have started using it recently.
---
I mean they could just put an in games comm system. Thatd be nice.
---
spewing toxicity in post game chat doesn't fix anything. just spreads that nastiness you have inside you to other people.
---
I wish
---
RIP   thanks for the info
---
Dead Hard. It gives you another health state (by not going down) and to extend the loop.
---
I think it's generally frowned upon and seen as beginner/poor gameplay.
---
Balanced landing because it is the only perk of exhaustion that works even after being used (for now as they are going to nerf quickly because of that)
---
I can't remember exactly, but something about a cis gendered alpha male making the reply in the pic. It was way more than just that but that's the part I remembered.
---
Hes already overperforming /s
---
I stopped reading as soon as you said "this game is killer sided"
---
I personally wait at the exit gates till everybody escaped (so I don‚Äòt leave people behind should they be caught) but leave as soon as possible, I actually get super annoyed at my fellow teammates when the don‚Äôt leave and teabag (usually when I‚Äòm spectating because I‚Äòm bad at this game lmao).
---
However, I must confess, if the killer was super toxic that game I do stay and waste his time sometimes, teabagging them because fuck them :)
---
I feel so lame when I do this on stream üòÇ
---
Lol great job
---
I'm not in the least surprised
---
Piggie looking ready for a halloween slumber party, &lt;3
---
Great work!
---
Well, you can use the bottles to cut off loops at a distance with your only real channel being reloading, and the slow/blurry effect really fucks up navigating and prevents fast vaults, while Freddy's only does the latter to sleeping survivors.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Not saying Freddy isn't better since he can channel to place a trap mid-loop without slowing down and they act as great notifications if a survivor moves across a trap-littered map while asleep, and gets map-wide mobility that most use to great effect in tunneling/proxying while completely immune to BT.
---
But Clown is pretty decent at shutting down loops too.
---
I love the little chemical danger sign on it too. That's a great touch.
---
The problem here is that it's rank 1-20. So pros AND babies.
---
New players have no fucking idea what to do against Freddy, and he can slow the game down just enough to do well in high purple.
---
 last month was Hag and Trapper as the strongest killers, you think anyone uses Trapper past green ranks and gives 70% kill rates? Or second highest? 
---
Pre-Nurse was still one of the lowest in rankings... Literally no low rank player can use Omega Blink Nurse well despite it's power.
---
That‚Äôs when the last guy hides in a locker and debates his life choices
---
Nah, it's not just you. Lots of Meyers and Trappers are camping. I recently joined Dead By Daylight on Switch
---
Decisive strike, borrowed time, unbreakable. Or find some people to play with, if he‚Äôs face camping that means you have 2 minutes to do gens. 3 people escape 1 is the martyr
---
I'll just suicide now instead of DC.. We're gonna see a lot of youtube videos of people just running straight into the killer lmao
---
Wtf is this
---
&gt;Is anyone else getting a surplus in campers, and do you think the devs are ever going to do something about how unfun this makes the game?
---
They already done plenty, what else do you want? 
---
* Close proximity emblem punishments. Not strong enough (not even sure if it should be stronger) but its there.
---
* Invulnerability frames until the unhooked regain control of his character.
---
* Smoother unhooking animation. Before you were always committed to at least 30% of the animation, now you can just tap it to avoid grabs. 
---
* Along side smoother unhooking animation, you can go through the hooked survivor to bait out a hit on him instead of you. This is currently bugged but should be fixed in the next patch (December 3rd).
---
* Countless Borrowed Time buffs. Granted that BT suffered some indirect nerfs with Oblivious / Undetectable but hopefully it won't take long for devs to fix this.  
---
At some point the players skill, good timing and ability to coordinately unhook against a camper needs to come in play, you can't expect the devs to do everything for you. They provided multiple tools, use them. 
---
Something I would like to see is faster unhooking added somewhere (WGLF? BT?), this would leave you less exposed to grabs.
---
Devs can't mettle with camping too far, otherwise they will punish people that don't adopt this play style as their main play style not to mention end game scenario.
---
hey shut up
---
In my personal opinion where campers are less seen in ranks 15-10 my favorite rank to play both roles
---
Lol I meant, P3 . My bad.
---
In my opinion it‚Äôs a delay perk not an escape perk. Like with it I could possibly dead hard to a pallet and loop them for a bit and get downed.
---
probably
---
Even current legion?
---
&gt;Decisive strike, borrowed time, unbreakable. Or find some people to play with, if he‚Äôs face camping that means you have 2 minutes to do gens. 3 people escape 1 is the martyr
---
Not only that, with BT (preferably multiple BT) you can swap places on hook to buy more time and everyone gets to escape.
---
I mean if you say dumb shit don't get suprised when people call you out.
---
Call the waambulance
---
Wait until the new chapter comes out on December 3rd I think. Oni is veryyyyy good and I suggest you get him because he can easily 4K with his map pressure and mobility.
---
Pretty much this. As soon as you get away from potato ranks it happens less and less because it just doesn‚Äôt work most of the time strategically.
---
A toddlers skull has more teeth under it's teeth
---
 in the right hands :3 Of course
---
Cheers, I'll have a look. I've watched some of his stuff before but mainly killer videos
---
If you buy the whole chapter you waste your shards you already spent on the spirit. Your best bet is to buy auric cells and buy the survivor with those.
---
I mean he‚Äôs not wrong. As awesome as it was being able to down 3 people at once in 1 hit is ridiculous.
---
Yeah I guess. I don't run into it that often and everyone always just seems to use it when I'm chasing them out in the open.
---
It's not quite as big on Switch but matches aren't rare. I'm enjoying it as I don't have any other platform to play. Although there are hiccups when doing skill checks
---
I would be laughing my ass off, wow.
---
Well that‚Äôs because they might as well. There‚Äôs no other option so you might as well just delay.
---
I think keys are fair, for the hatch to even spawn you have to complete 1 more gen than the number of people you have. For example 4 people left = 5 gens to do. So either way you have to work for the hatch. It seems pretty fair even if it‚Äôs an easy escape. Without keys and the hatch, killers can just stand on a hill and watch both exit gates if it‚Äôs not a huge map.
---
Now that you said it, it‚Äôs not gonna happen. Now they‚Äôll classify it a ‚Äúfan concept‚Äù ;-;
---
Wake up and it's no longer a problem his power only works when your asleep and his teleport takes longer if everyone is awake
---
it was good meme, wish u only added the voice to ramsay scream tho.
---
Well duh it‚Äôs not just the snap of a finger, but they are a team dedicated to making a game-  they don‚Äôt stop making killers because it‚Äôs harder than just importing a model into the game.  And it has been an issue for me-  my killer queues take 15 to 20 minutes sometimes which is atrocious compared to other games.
---
I think it sounds like a blast, but surprisingly the rest of the RE community is pretty hostile to it. I guess at heart they're in it for the single player, I just hope they give it a chance, you know?
---
I‚Äôd like it if the person you unhook or you take a protection hit for gets a 3-5 second speed boost. That would make it ok and help with the whole ‚Äúneeds to be a safe unhook to get a stack‚Äù
---
How do you use that geforce shadowplay feature. Never works for me.
---
right but there are a ton of things that gave away that the oni was coming, the heartbeat going up super fast, the crows, and the oni yelling when he activated his power. 
---
i‚Äôm not saying it would be easy but it‚Äôs definitely counterable. it‚Äôs also not like this is going to happen a lot anyway.
---
Yeah, but just because it can happen doesn't mean it will. The stars have to align with the planets during the perfect solar eclipse right as an asteroid passes by the moon at 10:42 PM for this to happen. It's like Marth's Depip Squad. Just because SWF could play like that doesn't mean they did or will.
---
Ive been playing for about three weeks now (I finally gave up on F13 and remembered I got this as a free game on PS4) and I entered it with no notion of how to play. I've picked it up and am having a great time, but I had my first Freddy match and I got my shit cooked with that nightmare realm. I usually have some plan but I had no fucking idea how to combat it.
---
Exactly, my English is a potato x, D
---
Realistically the key is only a failsafe for when your team gets dominated and they werent gonna win anyway.
---
The only time they are kinda bullshit is 1 gen 3 survivors because you could of set up the perfect 3gen and killed someone but your pressure is gone becuase of an item
---
If 5 gens are completed and all 4 key escape then you probably weren't gonna kill more then 1, if any at all barring noed remember me blood warden shenanigans.
---
Just remove keys from the chest pool or keep dull keys in the pool but they take the hatch with them when they escape, so only they escape. Skellies brought in the match function as normal and remove the addon that keeps the key if opens the lock.
---
Cause brainlets such as yourself like to talk complain about everything in this game. Being defensive is what an argument is. If you aren't defending your side of the argument then you aren't arguing. Find another workaround to not mention the perks.
---
I think you can see offerings and names, not load outs? IIrc anyway
---
legion using steve as an umbrella
---
Lmao!
---
*Drinks*
---
‚ÄúI feel bad and guilty....‚Äù
---
lol downvoted for speaking facts. Oni was wayy to strong in PTB and does rightlfully need a nerf. Killer mains be wanting a 4k everygame.
---
Low tier meets low tier
---
Sprint...balanced landing is shxt bcuz you can be in an open field with  no high ground in sight and killer is near you....its useless there....Sprint burst can be used any and everywhere....just use fixated as well for maximum effort
---
I use TubeMate but there are many different apps/websites
---
oh no this whole thing has poor english I didnt check this what so ever
---
Wholesome
---
Get this on killer side too, only just joined the game and I'm matched with a butt ton of purples.
---
I do something similar as a survivor 360ing a killer.
---
this is literally what happened to me üòî
---
The backstory to the new survivor Yui.
---
Haha RIP xD I'm on Ps4 fam, if you need some pro tios just hmu lul üòÇ
---
I take that into account, yes. Some killers may have there own expectations for survivors but not the way survivors do for killers.
---
Then dont use Decisive, Balanced, Adrenaline, Borrowed, etc...
---
Steve‚Äôs moaning on the hook... so uncomfortable
---
A kill won't let you pip. Survivors pip even when dead of they did gens/ran the killer around.
---
I recommend watching Scott's video about Oni and looking for Tofu's opinion. Both are killers mains and they have quite substantial arguments to why Oni is on the OP side and should / will be nerfed before it hits live.
---
I like what they‚Äôve done with hitboxes
---
I feel like the Archives are gonna make the both sides understand each other  . It‚Äôs a forced game of playing the other side and they can understand why such things exist. Like tunnelling or A lot of swf matches . Again I could be wrong
---
Call me out? You only said that you didn't even read it. The only thing you called out is your own ignorance mate. You won't even acknowledge something that's not conform with your own opinion
---
I never asked
---
Just kidding lol. Glad you‚Äôre excited about it!
---
WHEEEEEW BOYEEE
---
Bruh if survivors could hold onto the killer while they‚Äôre down there‚Äôd  be a lot of memes to be done
---
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs coming back! I got his leg stun this bƒ´tch!‚Äù
---
We can actually see how anxious you were! Nice that you got out.
---
He needs tweaks, but god is he hard to change
---
And I bet your heart was pumping and palms sweating...lmaoo..this is why I love this game.
---
Ah yes the art of flip flop.
---
I like sprint burst but I hate having to save my running or accidentally triggering when I‚Äôm just going from point a to b
---
I was panicking so much lmao
---
People are often salty and terrible after matches. Take it all in stride. It only gets worse so I suggest growing some thick skin. Just being honest. Watch some YouTube videos if you want some pointers. Welcome to dead by deadbears.
---
True, for me it‚Äôs mainly experience but I just save it even if I‚Äôm going slow.
---
What game is that from?
---
On the new servers it's more like Ol' Terrible.
---
I swear I just about flatlined from all the stress
---
I'm slowly collecting all of Bubba's perks without ever buying him. One more to go.
---
With the killer's impressive 180 flick, I wouldn't be surprised if that Trapper landed the hit and secured the down after the edit.
---
Don't forget the Spongebob memes as if we're all prepubescent. I'd like to see more original memes. More video memes in particular as they take more effort.
---
Yeah. I actually found it funny. It was first hate message. I kind of want it embroidered and hung up on my wall.
---
So damn useful sometimes
---
Gen speeds am i right?
---
Yep. Faster for killer around 6CST PMand idk when that ends. Faster queue for survivor when it‚Äôs not killer sonic.
---
Gen speed is a legitimate problem. Add 10-15 seconds to the amount of time it takes to repair a gen. Generators take at most 80 seconds to repair (as long as you don‚Äôt miss a skill check), it less than that if you hit great skill checks and/or if you have a toolbox. Other than that I agree.
---
HELL YEAHH
---
The first of many im afraid lol.
---
If you want to get better at anything, you have to put ego aside. It only grows harder with age.
---
As someone who runs Plunderer's and gets keys about every other game, they're pretty bullshit.
---
THIRDED
---
Keys are more like noed, if survivors dont broke dull totems they can get a noed. If you dont notice that one or more survivors have a key and you keep patrolling generators, they may escape trough the hatch.
---
I‚Äôve literally said there are work arounds, just because something isn‚Äôt impossible to beat doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not too strong. And if those perks were as underwhelming as killer mains like to act like they are, they wouldn‚Äôt be part of every killers builds and nobody would feel the need to get hot and bothered when someone said they didn‚Äôt like them.
---
I think keys are as well balanced as moris and instant kills. Honestly speaking. If 3 survivors get hatch and deny the killer those 3 kills it is the same as using a mori on a survivor within the first two minutes of a match. Moris are the killers versions of keys basically.  Survivors have to get lucky enough for someone to have a key, find hatch, and actually coordinate everyone to it. Just like with Moris the killer just has to be lucky enough to find someone and hook them and find them once more and down them. I think if anything skeleton key should be open hatch until it is closed. A dull key should be only 1 survivor to get through then closes. Lastly, A broken key should be last survivor if killer closed hatch on them basically. That way the keys and Moris match up.
---
Only haters will say "Shrek doesn't belong in DBD."
---
It‚Äôs too weak buff it lol
---
I....am not excited to see Franklin's on here.
---
As someone who plays both sides:
---
Learn to power through it. Ruin is meant to waste time. Be it looking for it, or not doing gens because ruin is active.
---
You PS4? I'm down
---
Since BL is getting a nerf, I decided to swich to something else. Dead Hard never works for me, and SB makes you walk so... I've been using Lithe and I gotta say, its pretty good actually. You can drop a unsafe pallet, vault it and run to a safer pallet. The distance you create with a window+the speed burst is nice as well. I kinda like it
---
Well said.
---
Why? For pointing out that there is nothing in the video that needed skill? For pointing out that the killer needs to be nerfed? Sure.

It happens. My skin's thick enough not to take them seriously, but it's still not cool.
---
Now that I finally got into playing killer after 250 h playing survivor (I'm still a potato at both though) I'm gonna have to try this. Sounds like ut could be fun xD
---
It's kind of a necessity
---
I did this on purpose once, but not to win. I set it up to secure the 500 shock trophy. It was annoying for everyone involved.
---
Legion a story underground them with *"CRAWLING IN MY SKIN"* blaring.
---
In this case, it's the most recent communication from the devs, on the front page of this subreddit.
---
On the contrary; If they didn't, the game would be over in five minutes. You're in lobbies longer than in-game.
---
Eh, I don't care what items they are carrying as I don't particularly care about "winning" by getting a 4k. If they have been a little shit the entire game, then they better pucker up because I'm coming for that ass. Most of the time however, them getting away only delays their inevitable death later in the match. Just have a little confidence in your abilities and you might not feel the need to kick someone while they're essentially down.
---
That, much like the OP's screen name, is simply not quality content.
---
I‚Äôm going to need you to define each of those words individually
---
The only survivors who can escape are coordinated SWF with meta perks? 
---
No, I completely disagree with that statement. There are PLENTY of times when I solo queue and I escape the trial.
---
SO FUCKING LONG OMG it reaches almost past my butt, and good GOD is it a pain once it wants to start wrapping around things. So glad that it getting matted and tangled is in character or else I'd be losing my mind LOL
---
Franklin‚Äôs has some strategic merit on Hag and Trapper imo. The dropped item can be trapped and used as bait when the survivor comes back to grab it.
---
I put mine on Terraria but DBD deserves it aswell
---
dont forget le epic woman yelling at cat
---
They expected this,that‚Äôs why they added the heart beat to signify that your in the terror radius.
---
PS4 IS BETTER FUCK YOU
---
Garbage game is favored toward gay killers fuck you devs
---
They just need to reduce the amount of blood he gets for healthy hits and he should be fine.
---
Look at the arms go on that gen!
---
I'm not sure, did they last year?
---
The switch version is actually pretty good once you get use to the 30fps so I hope she enjoys it.
---
Also, leaning your head closer to the screen won't make it easier to hear survivor grunts if you have headphones on.
---
But just try and stop me.
---
What if the team was filled with potatoes and the last survivor was actually the only being useful and doing stuff the whole time? What now? Still deserves to ez kill him aswell?
---
Poor Bubba wants friends so bad he talks to the hardest person to make friends with LMAO
---
And LMAO yes, they are demonia platforms in the highest height of heel I could get because no one is gonna be scared of a 5'4 Myers. And I unfortunately don't have many pics yet, but there were many taken of me that I'm sure will pop up, and I can compile them in the future!
---
Whoa, you left out all the half naked Myers/certain character has a butt jokes. Those make up way too much of this sub.
---
It takes some sort of skill to get the ability, and yes it does take some sort of skill to maneuver to the survivors. Leatherface could do this with no skill, but you actually have to earn Oni‚Äôs ability.  He doesn‚Äôt need to be nerfed. He was probably louder on his way to them, than the wambulance on its way to pick you up.
---
What confuses me is the fact that I matter how many bottles you have reload time is the same. I think the more you have thrown, the longer it takes. Like 5 bottles = (whatever the time is now) but reloading one or two = less time. 
---
Obviously people would just stay topped up but in a chase you couldn‚Äôt really do that. Also, while doing a full reload you need to stop for some reason and chase you have 2-3 bottles in the chamber. 
---
Dunno if it would buff him TOO much but it might be... something? Dunno.
---
Not really. I split my time and have never used it. Some times you get wrecked as killer and sometimes you wreck but most of the time it's more balanced without it. Why do people want these games to last longer? Bloodpoints is the only thing that matters. Hook everyone, hook em again, and then get kills or they escape. It's way more fun that way. Everyone needs to stop taking this so personally and just work together to get bloodpoints.
---
I agree the bulk of the time the survivor makes an avoidable mistake, but sometimes, certain killers with a certain load out are basically uncounterable.
---
If Freddy could see everyone, he would be good (very rare addons are base set). His addons were strong, but not enough. Imagine full map visuals with MAX speed
---
I really don‚Äôt know how DBD still has some of the worst matchmaking I‚Äôve ever seen
---
LolüòÇ
---
Yup, starting on the 28th there will be a sale, I‚Äôm not sure of what exactly but DLC and some cosmetics will be on sale. Auric Cells packs never have been on sale though
---
I agree. Then whenever I come across a match without it, it feels like I'm flying! Lol
---
Epic
---
Why does adding something for one side mean there should be an equivalence for the other side?
---
Matches are pretty fast.
---
The only thing to be wary of is playing as the Demogorgon, last patch made him really laggy for some reason.
---
Killer main but playing killer stresses me out because if I mess up once or twice I lose the game. Really need to play the most optimally since I don't play top tier killers except for Spirit sometime with fun addons and perks. Otherwise I play Doc
---
Everything except Stranger Things and Oni will be 50% if i'm not mistaken
---
Literally just had two matches back to back with a double hatch escape
---
Random
---
Not at all though?  Like seriously, if you have any idea how data management works and consider the fact that they can easily apply BP multipliers, you‚Äôd know it‚Äôs not that hard to add as opposed to all the modeling, balancing, animating, etc. that goes into making a killer
---
Which I don't have a problem doing,. The only thing I'm concerned about is the particular situation of forever freddy which unfortunately has become 30 to 40 percent of my games. It isn't much of an option there unless you do it at the very start of the game.
---
I second this... my lunge range got twice as far
---
Aw, thank you. ^^ I faced some transphobia today, &amp; this response made me feel better.
---
Dude same, like I just want Medkits but I can never get them
---
Urban evasion. Hard to camp if the killer can't find you. Plus try using the fog addons. Even a little can make a difference
---
You're probably going to be disappointed then - especially against the swf teams I face
---
Darn.........
---
I happen to see more toolboxes in my games as killer. Can I have your lobbies pls
---
Idk why you tell him no point in arguing against someone who refuses to listen to any points made, when you are the one who is not listening. I mean People 4k with bubba and legion at red ranks, those that mean they are good killers? 
---
I mean you told the guy did you ever hear of ruin, and the guy told you ruin means shit against good survivors, and thats the truth, speaking as a red rank survivor, hell ranks mean nothing in dbd, and you being a red rank just proves that rank means shit, when you still don t have basic knowledge about the game. I mean ruin is litterally shit for good survivors. Out of 10 skillchecks i will at worst hit 8, and those 2 skillchecks i miss is because of teribble fps. I mean i do agree with you that clown is not that bad as people say, i used to main him, but now i am bubba main.
---
Think he means the BNP before they nerfed it again how you had to keep doing skill checks
---
If you‚Äôve played the dark souls games I feel like something similar to quelaag would be really cool! Then they wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with being super short and they could use a similar animation to the demogorgon for climbing through windows!
---
&gt;most of the time it's more balanced without it \[ruin\]
---
Balanced: It depends if a SWiF group is present. If so, the game is not balanced. Without ruin, you're getting gen-rushed.
---
Watch YouTube videos and practice, GL!
---
god i remember being paired with red rank killers as a baby survivor. that shit sucked.
---
Dont touch my dwight
---
27th near 12:00 PST I'd say. No idea for EST but prob not that big a difference
---
That's a lot of blood
---
Yes, I‚Äôm going to discredit your fallacious attempt at backing up fallacious data. Not sure what you expect there.
---
The rest of your post is pretty unorganized so I‚Äôll just go over Individual points.
---
My opinion is based on normative arguments and , just like you, the *experiences* of others. Not what I‚Äôve ‚Äúobserved‚Äù a.k.a. what reinforces my opinion, but rather normative and descriptive situations as well as what credible sources of information say and how they back this up beyond twisting the other side‚Äôs argument into something they can make points against, as you are now. I‚Äôm also very curious as to what 30-viewer streamers say the game is killer sided, and would love to see one that doesn‚Äôt have majority playtime on survivor by a significant difference.
---
No idea why you‚Äôre still bringing up kills when I‚Äôve said multiple times that rating efficacy on kills alone is, both in theory and in practice, not valuable information when presented alone. Apparently you‚Äôre still dwelling on the leatherface point which, as I‚Äôve already mentioned, you completely missed the intention of.
---
Median becomes more useful the more people it‚Äôs accounting for, not just the number of factors. This is just plain wrong. You also either totally missed my point again or are just choosing to stay ignorant so you have something to argue about, since the entire point of bringing up median was to show why the data is unreliable. Didn‚Äôt you, yourself, say that an average will factor in facecampers, afk‚Äôers, and the like? Then naturally it can be agreed that an average based on a single variable is not reliable or worth taking as fact like a median would be.
---
My interpretation of the statistics is that others aren‚Äôt considering anything but the numbers when making a conclusion based on them. You can‚Äôt really disagree with this since people are literally looking at the numbers and making conclusions to reinforce their opinions. You‚Äôve done it, plenty of others on that post did it, and many more will do it. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúdisagree‚Äù or ‚Äúagree‚Äù, this is ‚Äúis‚Äù or ‚Äúis not‚Äù.
---
I don‚Äôt see that chunk of text dedicated to you using a word, just a valid criticism of the point surrounding it. Whatever gives you that little bit of ground since you have none, though.
---
I did answer your question, and I have been answering it, multiple times, with multiple points. But since you need a very direct and simple answer:
---
Kills alone are not a valid measure of performance when presented without any other variable. 
---
You‚Äôre waving this 2.6 around as if it means the world when, in reality and with a bit of thought as to how the game works or what situations arise when playing, means nothing.
---
If we go along with your mental gymnastics and assume the statistics are totally valid and should be praised like the gospel, then solely for red ranks:
---
Of course killers in red ranks will have a higher number of kills because it‚Äôs harder for killers to pip than it is for survivors. Why is it harder? *Because the game is not killer sided.* Killers who don‚Äôt get 2-3 kills aren‚Äôt there because **they drop out of red ranks**. You yourself admitted that the ranking system needs tweaks to adjust for this. This is a clear cut example of someone choosing not to think about why a statistic may show as it is to reinforce their limited views; I mentioned the exact same thing when talking about the rank 1 survivor escape rates, but again, cognitive dissonance.
---
I‚Äôll do you a favor and avoid asking you to answer all of the questions you left out or address all of the points you misinterpreted/twisted because it would take hours for you to do every one.
---
Lmao "move survivors out of your way" like they flies or something
---
Oh right, whoops, thought that there was a time limit on the aura read. It‚Äôs a distance limit, my bad
---
I'd that 1200 or 0000?
---
1200
---
I made this before ghost face and plague were released but then I just thought of posting it on reddit, thanks for the feedback
---
For some reason self care has become the new hated perk amongst the survivors recently. I'm with you. And I don't always want to bring a medkit. Play the game a few days ago without it and had a toolbox for one of the challenges. Got unhooked by a Dwight who proceeded to disappear into the corn stalks while carrying a medkit without even trying to let me stay with him. Fuck that, I'll take care of myself.
---
That would be 0900 ET
---
Cant tell if this is bait
---
Depends what you consider camping. Staying near hook to look because the killer's BBQ didnt go off isnt camping. Or coming back to someone that unhooked near him
---
How dare you use Traps as the Trapper. ^/s
---
Seriously though Survivors will disconnect for practically any reason. (Certain Killer, Map, Perks, etc...) and if putting a possibly obvious bear trap next to a generator is the reason then entirely their fault for not walking around them or disarming them.
---
Yes, im talking about the instant repair bnp! of course mori is a little more tricky but when equip it, you pretty much have a free kill.
---
Comparing mori with a key is unacceptable for me.
---
Well the perk seems like a pseudo thrilling so you had the right idea :).
---
The leak said stranger things stuff is 30% off and all cosmetics pte stranger things is 30% off. All killers and survivors are 50% off other than that
---
I see what you mean sorta with a key you do have to do some work unless you hide all game.
---
I love that Claudette is in the bush.
---
My thought is they aren't really that good, because you're giving up the entire map. Had a game with someone who was camping hard, like just sitting there chopping at the person on the hook, and we just rotated in and switched places while everyone else cleared. I don't know maybe it would've worked if there wasn't a flashlight in the group.
---
Definitely watch see YouTube and just play as often as you can. The best way to get better is just persevere through it, even if your not good at it the more you play the better you'll get and most of all, just don't give up.
---
Ouch, that's really bad.
---
This is beautiful. I shall cherish this every time a harvest the soul of an innocent person. Thank you.
---
Okay. I said to other people, which he had seen since he replied to me that Clown requires a specific playstyle revolving around shutting down loops and herding survivors where you want them to go. His power is solid, and he is a good killer, maybe not high tier but he's not trash as people make him out to be. Saying that I don't know basic knowledge about the game is just trying to nullify me because 'He doesn't know the game ha ha' when I speak from my experience that no matter the rank nor group of survivors, Ruin slows the game down enough.
---
Wtf, man? You are totally missing the point.
---
Thank you!
---
It's better than your name androgynous edgelord.
---
I dont but it‚Äôs understandable if some people do. Kinda like how I move my head when I see an incoming sniper bullet.
---
How is it easier for a killer to find hatch? There are 4 survivors, often times playing in groups of 2-4. Don‚Äôt maps show where hatch is when it spawns with the right add ons? Survivors have equal or higher chance to find hatch as killer.
---
Myers is a smexy big boi, got a message saying "mori me daddy &lt;3"

#[**NEA'S A KILLER!!!!!!!1111**](/intensifies)
---
its misleading to try to prove a point that doesn't have a point at all.
---
SWF is unbalanced Periodt
---
I'm forward to this.
---
I always teabag, but mean it more in a "Hey, good game" sorta way. I don't think I've ever done it to rub it in that I'm escaping. I also do it when the killer and I lock eyes at a distance to acknowledge that I see them. 
---
Now, when I teabag a dead survivor teammate... That's because they sucked to play with (trying to sabotage teammates) and I'm glad they're dead. Fellow survivors are usually the worst part of this game.
---
tldr: we can't communicate and teabagging can mean many things.
---
Pharmacy botany is much better
---
Which cosmetic?
---
At this point you can't already have it , they have some recolours but they ain't the exact same .
---
okay but the first one is so cute
---
Oh, gross!
---
can you give any reasoning or logic as to why the game is killer sided besides out of context dev statistics?
---
I play doc a lot and I'll have to say that he really isn't that good for a few reasons. His power, for one, is really unreliable. Sometime it will stop the survivor, sometime it won't. And since its got travel time (cast for .75 then wait .5 for it to hit) its kinda unreliable. He's like a better legion that can snowball REALLY well if it happens. Also he's an m1 killer which really disadvantages him. He can hold a 3 gen well though but if survivors aren't too bad or you aren't playing on meatplant it shouldn't be too bad.
---
All sound op. Neat concepts though, I‚Äôll give you that
---
No I‚Äôm not. As a survivor you can still lose to a trash killer in this game. Just because you lose and call the killer trash, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre trash
---
Her perks are awful though. The only one that has a chance to have some use is the wiggle one. If perks arent good then they dont affect the meta.
---

Yep.
---
KEEP THESE COMICS COMING! I LOVE YOUR ART!
---
Today on things that never happened
---
Lol hes playing the game. If you play a game you should always being trying to win wtf.
---
What‚Äôs that
---
if a killer ever lets me escape, I usually go up to them before leaving, nod my head up and down, and tbag once or twice. I also do it in the beginning if I start off with another survivor, kinda like saying ‚Äúaye wassup!‚Äù. I‚Äôve never actually done it when locking eyes with a killer, personally if a survivor did that to me I‚Äôd just assume they‚Äôre being toxic and want me to chase them or something, but it‚Äôs cool to know that people use it to communicate rather than being straight up toxic
---
Excuse you, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is hot as fuck and I'd do him with or without drag
---
Great post, I agree with everything here. Especially the environments- it‚Äôs WAY too bright. I get we have to balance around actually being able to see those pesky Blendettes but I‚Äôm sure they could just brighten up clothes a little more and make the environment darker. I also loved what you said about flickering lights in indoor maps, that would be really cool
---
Quinton smiths perk, allows you to search a chest and get a green medkit 100% once per match
---
That sounds like a blast. They do that down here at the old green ranks too.
---
This but unironically.
---
While I AM an androgynous edgelord in real life, the screen name is just a reference to a cellphone game I haven't played in a year. Thank you, tho!
---
If your self care heal will be faster? No
---
Will the efficiency bluffs stack? Yes they should
---
Moris &gt; Keys
---
Sure, Keys suck but Moris are much more overpowered (minus yellow of course).
---
Regardless, you killed 3 so you overperformed based on the dev team‚Äôs standards.
---
yea my power is if they add these perks to the game bhvr hq gets burnt the fuck down by absolutely livid surviviors(and killers that also think these are stupid op)
---
If 3 survivors could often complete 4-5 generators, there would be no point in having a 4th survivor and it would makes the game super unbalanced.
---
And survivors in my experience have a decent if not high chance to finish 3 generators depending on their skill and killer perks.
---
EGC with multiple survivors left favors 1-3 getting out with teamwork, 4 if the killer is too close to the door.
---
EGC favors killer if doors are close, which is impossible on some maps, or it‚Äôs 1-2 survivors. Which seems balanced. Survivors should just a free out just because killer closed the hatch.

Both are bullshit. I think both sides should just reach across the isle on this one and forfeit both. Seems like an even trade for the betterment of the game as a whole.
---
your just wrong, why are u speaking. It increases healing speed not healing item speed it works on self care.
---
You devs are ugly as the killers
---
it works with self care, hes retarded dont mind him.
---
Rank 9 survivor, gets rank 17-20 teammates and killer, die trying to open exit gate, sigh
---
I'm remembering the scene in h18 where the kid was talking to him about how "you ever want a girl you cant have" and Michael is just standing over there like "lol"
---
damn, now I want to vent to Myers. he seems largely judgemental, but you better make sure you keep his interest üò≥
---
Very nice!
---
Nope
---
So I take it you're a rank one killer who always gets 4K's? If not then you're definitely a rank one idiot.
---
Yes. Self Care is 32 seconds,with Botany Knowledge it drops down to 24s seconds
---
Haha. This is hilarious. The stuff that killer mains say cracks me up always.
---
LF op
---
Exactly, it only comes into effect if you have self care but are using a medkit to heal.
---
So technically yes, their is a way in which these two perks work together but not in the sense your thinking. 
---
As someone else said the perk pharmacy would be a much better choice to synergize with bottonay knowledge as BK pretty much needs you to run a medkit to be of use.
---
DARN, He didnt do a satisfying backflip
---
Nice shitpost.
---
A ranged killer for 45 seconds
---
The game is killer sided. Let‚Äôs see. 4 against 1. 5 gens which are easy if you can play the game. You can stun the killer, you have 3 health states, you can *escape*... need I go in?
---
Im in the same boat, but this is probably just another side effect of being in first-person. It actually feels like YOU hunt that guy down if you let yourself get sucked in, so its only natural to lean forward to connect easier.
---
As a sidenote, i lost count on how many times i actually got jumpscared by random survivors running past me when im Pig, sometimes so surprising i actually had to silently scream.
---
Healing speed and self healing speed are considered 2 different things in the game. It's you who is wrong.
---
This is also from someone who **HAS** run the proposed loadout.

I fucking love this

It literally has been proven that it works my way, not yours. The only different things in the game are "Healing item speed" and "Healing speed"
---
I mean, yeah, of course I want to be chased when we lock eyes, otherwise I'd just slink around a corner. Matches where I never even see the killer are boring and happen way too often.
---
He got a 4k with wraith at rank 20 so killer is op, can literally go invisible.
---
Hagerina with noed and no kills? ggwp
---
I choose to believe his level of interest directly correlates to how high he's holding his knife. It's like those old gong shows where you get dragged off the stage by some prick with a hook on a stick if your act sucks, only here you get gutted. Fun!
---
I agree. You can‚Äôt balance a game with the pink/purple offerings/items/add ons. All are to either make life miserable for the killer or the survivors
---
I agree with you he is nowhere near trash, that place belongs to legion and sadly killer i main bubba. I would say he is mid tier right next to amanda in my opinion. Ruin does slow the game down because nobody wants to work through ruin. But If we are talking about good survivors, and i don t mean mediocore survivors, but good survivors, then really ruin is just a slight pain in the ass. I mean did you ever had a game where   1 - 2 gens pop before you get your first hook even with ruin, because that shit happens to everbody. I am also talking from my expirience as a survivor, for me ruin means nothing, rarely will clown down me under a minute, unless i make some stupid mistake. But hey like i said clown is still not bad as people say, he is good killer, but fails against good survivors, because his map preassure isn t there. So what i am saying is If you play vs 4 survivors that are good as me, you will at best get 2k, 3k If you are lucky.
---
What is the last word? Herd?
---
Sorry you‚Äôre wrong. I never run SC without botany, self caring is too damn slow without it.
---
Microtransactions is the right reason to crucify a game
---
You fucking monster

Black Friday as a matter of fact
---
Where are you from may i ask?
---
Quality shitpost.
---
We can't stop me
---
I think Nurse's lunge is actually *always* longer but I'm unsure.
---
Publishers are 100% at fault, not the devs. The devs were pushed into doing things they wouldn't normally have done because of the publishers. TRS is actually a really great little developer.
---
And the game absolutely got an unfair rap at launch
---
Dumb question but what show?
---
A close friend of mine only played in a 3 SWF "Team" (Not toxic, but still regular "cheating" chatting like *"hes chasing me at X"*).
---
He asked me shitton of Questions about Killer topics, just because he was forced into it shortly for archives. Hes not far FAR more understanding for my Killer Problems, and now plays Wraith 2 or 3 times each session to *"Not lose this Knowlegde from the other side"* as he put it.
---
I do it because I feel accomplish on hitting a survivor. 25% killer main, so i feel happy enough to let survivors go after my Barbecue stacks. :)
---
Will it be on the day of? Sorry I‚Äôm just getting really inpatient I need to have cowboy head jake lol
---
November 28th
---
Steve, Nancy Demogorgon 30% off with cells
---
Every other killer or survivor 50% off
---
All pre stranger things cosmetics 30% off
---
*"shed the royal garb and walk amongst your people"*
---
I believe so
---
Wow thank you üôè
---
According to Leaks By Daylight subreddit it will take place on the 28th of November.
---
Yea. I have kind of an unpopular opinion when it comes to add ons though. I think the base kit killer should be the focus of balance and add ons should all be like the new nurse add ons where they add a little bit of fun or gimmick. I dont think add ons should jump a killer from meh to absolutely unstoppable or that a killer should need add ons in order to be playable.
---
All of this is all still TOME 1.
---
Yes, all the challenges from all the tiers contribute to TOME 1's rift until it ends.
---
Why is it dumb? 
---
Anyway, its The Office. Great show, and you'll see that many, many memes you see around today are from this show. So give it a try
---
Yeah yeah tome PART 1 you got the point
---
Joe
---
That's not true, you just can't chain the first blink. You need to charge to the second blink to be able to get back on top of them.
---
Demogorgon, he has no eyes.
---
No idea
---
Just buy feng for 9k shards lol
---
When killers play nasty aka camp and tunnel then yeah, it's easy to win.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e2ae7g/has_there_been_some_weird_ass_change_for_the_xbox/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I always hear how the maps used to be darker and fog was thicker, wish it was still that way. I think Lery's needs to be much darker with a lot of flickering lights in the hallways and stuff. I love the look of the map but it is way too bright.
---
As a killer main doing archive challenges, nobody like Spirit unless they're playing it
---
Well who cares about survivors. They already added stupedly op perks
---
Isn‚Äôt that what perks are for
---
Same here
---
If you don‚Äôt like being face camped or one hooked run deliverance and decisive strike.
---
It ain‚Äôt a ship
---
Tapp fits this face so perfectly, its unreal
---
They actually removed that. Hatch now spawns regardless of generators completed. Oh, for the last survivor only though, to clarify.
---
Missed the opportunity for Shirtless Daddy Myers as a lego minifig. XD  
---
on the real, great job!
---
I ignored your question because the only logical answer from the perspective of winning the match is to tunnel the injured survivor into the ground. Doesn't make for fun gameplay for the survivor, but at least you get to walk away with a sense of "accomplishment".
---
It bothers me when people purposely destroy other people's enjoyment just for the sake of winning in something as trivial as a video game.
---
The generic Survivor also shown in "This isn¬¥t happening" etc.
---
I forgot I uploaded lmao 
---
Anyways wraith is emil_cosplay (insta)

Amanda is me cookiehchar (insta)
---
And cameraman my partner sora_lightsky (insta)
---
Just so y‚Äôall know this ain‚Äôt supposed to be a ship xd just a cute video of wraith comforting Amanda :&gt;
---
Spongebob is an icon though and has loads of meme potential, especially videos. 
---
People just haven't tapped into it well enough imo.
---
WhO iS jOe?
---
Getting a whole team out means 5 gens got done with 0 kills from the killer. At that point you already lost.
---
Whats this ment to prove to us? its you that wont shut the hell up about "baby killer cant 4k" &amp; "You cant get kills without X"
---
Most people are fine having average matches if other players arnt toxic tryhards about it
---
if this shows up twice i'm sorry, i had to repost because putting 'glitch' in the title got it flagged by the modbot
---
Head On. 'Nuff said.
---
The game still had vaults on it just not as many.
---
What does that last part say?
---
It's a very fun perk and can either throw killers off or even lose chase.
---
Ditto. Although survivor mains usually have at least some sort of argument
---
Its band
---
I will take your word for it, thanks!
---
I completely agree with that. Nurse is a great example, I think tier one Michael is too. They should allow different gameplay, not make something OP.
---
You literally spend half your day on reddit posting about how hard killers are and complaining about survivor whiners.  You literally represent the stereotypes I just talked about.  Notice how I didn't call for nerfs to killers, I pointing out how killers clearly have a huge advantage which makes sense considering it's a horror game, the point is for the survivors to be scared and I am.
---
You wouldn't think this though from killer posters and streamers who do nothing but whine 24/7 about pallets sprint burst and decisive.  Meanwhile I queue for survivor literally instantly and I've waited for killer queue for legit 20+ minutes before giving up.
---
Here you come and prove my point that the reason killers complain so much is because they're obnoxious people who don't have anyone to play games with.
---
I've actually tilted my body to one side or the other when I'm trying to look off to one side of my screen, i.e. when doing a house gen in Haddonfield
---
No eye dea

I really like this idea, could I use this in a fan made ideas compilation? You'd be credited

You‚Äôre using Claudette‚Äôs natural blending powers to become something more powerful. Something that dreads in the heart of every killer...

Imagine caring about rank in DBD LMAO.  One thing I don't like about this game so far is that it's an extremely simple game with a shit tonne of grinding and progression tagged on to add artificial "replayability".  The game should be competing with amnesia but instead it's competing with league of legends with the amount of grinding and micro-transactions and toxicity.
---
Sounded like it xD no need to downvote because of it. I mean your comment can be taken differently by how you typed it cx
---
Most likely, but playing against a spirit with Ruin is like trying to swim in a wheelchair
---
Are you getting crashes mid game, but they're fake crashes, just kinda boots you to the main menu and takes your offering and item/add-ons?
---
This shit has happened to me 3 times within the last five games and I lost a pip on this last one, not even gonna queue until I know whats up.
---
Obviously he cares, we we're all rank 14 at some point and thought we were good. Why don't you save your breath for something else you negative pos.

---
Claudette being Claudette makes her a Blendette. The bitch is really hard to see
---
where... where is the download? i must obtain these works of art
---
You‚Äôre out here askin the real questions yo.
---
I really want flickering lights in the hallways on Lery's and for the map to be much darker overall. Then it might actually be creepy instead of looking like I walk into the ER at midnight.
---
Try 6 more hours than this...
---
To each his own. Maybe this game is just not for you then.
---
it's a way for survivors to torment us and mock that we're not doing well. kinda like if a survivor stuns at a pallet and t-bags, it's kinda like a "haha you didn't hit me because your shit"
---
well, it just freakin did.
---
It‚Äôs because people are actually good at chases. They understand the hit boxes, they know the pallets, drops, and vaults. Then there‚Äôs the flashlight which is only good to lose stun distance. The fact is, with a coordinated team (not even SWF), a killer doesn‚Äôt have to hook 3 people a whole game. When survivors are good, it is hard. That‚Äôs why matchmaking (if somewhat shitty) exists. To even it out. I can get rank 4 while I‚Äôm rank 10.‚Äù, but the rank 12 escapes. It‚Äôs really a mix of skill, precision, and decisions to be good which therefore makes a killer pissed off and dc or actually be challenged. And you also have to find survivors, which can be hard if you have eyes on you. GF fixes that tho so :/
---
you're right actually. only the annoying survivors who know how to loop and escape pose any threat. the friday the 13th game in large part sucks because it doesn't cater to the killer (jason) nearly enough. that game's a nightmare for killer, unlike dbd
---
His bottle reload is too slow, thats excruciating coz his map pressure is already downright non-existent, unless you are playing on shelter woods. And on top of that bottle reload after every other chase makes you lose precious 4-5 seconds.
---
Altho, that said his power needs to be nerfed down just a notch to balance **if** and that is a big if, he gets some buff to have a map pressure. Coz man he can end chases in half time when compared to other mid tier killers.
---
Crane wanted to be with a girl. She didnt want him. He was walking down the road and the headless horseman ran up and scooped his head. The next time anyone saw the horseman it had cranes head. Basically more or less it's the story.
---
Because Billy is the fastest at crossing the map except for some (old) Nurse addon combinations that may not even be relevant since Nurse's blink was changed, so the gates can be further apart and still be 'too close', and when they're on the same wall he just charges back and forth.
---
Still sometimes the Killer can't cross the map to the other gate at all, I feel like there should be a point of balance where they have a minimum and maximum distance.
---
Moris are way stronger, the equivalent to the old Brand new part (insta-gen).
---
Moris should be optional on last hook and then removed completely. Keys need a rework, but I think they can be balanced
---
It's actually shorter after blink. Her attack animation is just weird.
---
She also used to be able to hit before she appeared on survivor's screen after blink, making her lunge look insane
---
Tear üò©üò©üò©.
---
Imagine caring about a game enough to b\*tch about it on reddit.
---
Well than, that's helpful I guess. A lot simpler than I was expecting
---
Harsh truth :(
---
I'm not very articulate in my words. Watch scooby doo and the headless horseman if you want a quick rundown.
---
SWF- not fun
---
Gen rush- not fun
---
Tea bagging- not fun
---
End game toxicity- not fun
---
Borrowed time- not fun
---
Decisive strike- not fun
---
Adrenaline- not fun
---
There are many things not fun that killers have to deal with. If you played killer you‚Äôd know that. Put it this way
---
You play world of Warcraft PvP. The most valuable target is the healer, so what do you do? You focus them..... you don‚Äôt say ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre low on mana and there‚Äôs two other targets, so let me leave the alone, so I don‚Äôt ruin their fun.‚Äù 
---
No you get rid of them. 
---
PvP games are meant to set players up against each other in a game where one wins and the other loses. If you want a ‚Äúfun‚Äù only game where people don‚Äôt try to achieve victory, then go play a PvE game. You sound like one of those guys that wants a trophy for everything
---
That's a very specific example and you know it doesn't usually play out like that. There are two gates for a reason, advocating for keys is cutting out an intended gameplay element.
---
I find it funny that at red ranks there isn‚Äôt a single killer below or even at the 50% marker in kill rate, which is exactly where a killer should be to be considered perfectly balanced, and yet people still want to nerf survivors.
---
I swear there's a bird nest in that beard.
---
Wow I had no idea that could multi-hit! That's brutal
---
I do this but with moonwalking! I can only moonwalk on the floor, usually killers will just moonwalk on my body and hook me though lol
---
I haven't gotten to get on since they switched the servers back on.
---
How are the killer que times?
---
Before it would take 5-10ish minutes to find a lobby to put me in an then about a min to find survivors. 
---
Is still like this or have servers sped this process up?
---
F13 used to be fun before all the Jason nerfs. Before that it was survivor nerfs. Now it's just bugs. It's sad.
---
&gt;TRS is actually a really great little developer.
---
As someone who literally played Evolve from Day 1 until its death and was *very* active in their very tight-nit community.
---
No. TRS was not a good company for Evolve. They couldn't balance their game well *at all* and had god-awful community management. A good hunter team was virtually impossible to beat because they refused to make Monsters stronger because less skilled hunters got rekt by them. The game was extremely niche and rather than making the game better for those that cared, they attempted to cater to those who wouldn't care. Every step of the way.
---
Slim was an awful character through and through.
---
Caira was the most OP medic in the game's history before Slim.
---
Lazarus was horrifically bugged through the game's entire lifespan.
---
Hank was absolutely the best support.
---
Wraith was gutted after launch and never given a decent buff afterwards.
---
Honestly, I do not see how anyone who was closely related to Evolve during its life could say that the developers made half-decent choices. Every interview TRS has pointed the finger at 2K for their shortcomings. It makes them look even worse.
---
***I LOVE Evolve. I LOVED TRS.***
---
But they were not good 4v1 asymmetrical developers. As ironic as that is considering how well L4D was pulled off.
---
Dude. If they are available individually, then it cant be a license problem, it's just the chapter missing on the store. Probably sony fuckin around.
---
As an Xbox nurse player with like 300 hours, imagine dominating over almost every single game. Sensitivity needs to be wayyy up for nurse to be even close to viable on there, but once you have it down, it can be a cakewalk and make your chases so much shorter. Perks like stridor really help, and the common flannel is a godsend. Hope this helps!
---
only time i'm ever a toxic killer, is to ensure that a toxic survivor who t-bags     is brought to justice. (yes it's a vicious cycle but i don't like the idea of them getting away with it as well as a win)
---
Ah damn, well what's done it's done

this is better than med pods

How would every 4 clenses makes a corrupt (on the last fountain used) but it doesn't heal you anymore?
---
Being sick still sucks, but you can clean out a whole team before 1 corrupt gets used. Then 1) adjust the death vomit timeframe or 2) have a hit ticker so she can only get between 3-4 "hits" with it.
---
Fountains don't make M1 useless and using a fountain doesn't win the game. Corruption is still worth getting but it has a harder cap.
---
#* puts on pink bandana* "I'm not a man anymore....I'm a woman!!"
---
Mocking the killer is just fun for them but it sometimes makes the killer feel bad
---

---

---
God I miss Evolve
---
Just now I had a match with a toxic Nea who I kinda ignored. It turned out to be really well because I brought a yellow mori and she was running to the side not with the hatch (nobody saw it but I heard it) so I downed her and mori her. It was funny because she only got 1 hook the whole time
---
Jump through the windows and use the pallets. I'm still kind of crappy myself against good killers. I'm pretty good against mediocre and bad killers though. So I get how to play to an extent. You just watch YouTube and run in circles.
---
Give an actual penalty for placing your power like every single killer has and Freddy would be manageable. You can literally drop snares everywhere with no slowdown or anything. What is the point of clown when Freddy can do that?
---
No I agree. She‚Äôs a sh*t character. We already have Feng and Kate and she really doesn‚Äôt go along with Oni much, if at all. She looks nothing like they make her look in advertisements and chapter releases and overall we could‚Äôve done without her.
---
Yes but I'm not the one whining about the game and then calling others out for it.
---
If you want gen Rush in the early game when you spawn dont do gens with the other survivors every one of the players have to go to a different gen and in the Best case you have 3 done worst case 1 gen is done
---
Myself and a few others have already stated two gates completely opposite of one another a perfectly fine as it is countered by whispers.
---
They think you're gonna hit them with decisive strike. If they "dribble" you like this then, if done properly, you won't get a chance to use it. At least, it used to work this way I believe. But that's their intention.
---
Killer is more and more stressful when the weakest killer has a 60% kill rate at red ranks.
---
Maybe come to the realization that the problem is with you.
---
This gave me a boner!
---
Oh shit, really? I thought they changed it to you only seeing Survivors and the Killer when other Survivors are hooked. Is it really both ways? I mean, I thought Kindred was a great solo information perk, but damn, that's going to be a mainstay in my lineup if that's true.
---
The Pig's are also pretty bad for the simple fact that very few of them stack with anything else. For example, there's only one addon for getting more RBT's. There's only one addon for increasing crouch speed. There's only one addon for RBT skill check difficulty, and so on and so forth. 
---
Bubba's addons are just shit. 
---
Both Legion's power and his addons are garbage. He needs a freddy-style rework.
---
Is this real
---
All my victims ran away..
---
Thank you! I will try turning sensitivity up :)
---
What thought in chase? If he places a snare you have to drop the pallet down. You cannot go for an additional loop because the slowdown gives him a free hit. Its the same exact thing as clown.
---
That stage 4 is a big yikes. Never a good idea to insert a mori in a killer's power
---
By camping you mean caught the survivor going for an unhook and then proceeding to watch the whole gang commit an elaborate suicide via hook diving, then yes, I pitched the mightiest of tents that day.
---
It should increase healing received by the unhooked survivor.
---
They will tell you it's because of que times. Tbh I'd rather never go into a lobby if I'm a rank 10 and I get thrown in with reds and purples. I've never been a red or purple rank killer and its nonsense. 400 hour killers go against 4000 hour survivors.
---
For what it's worth he's right, I can't remember waiting for more than five minutes on any evening and weekends there's practically no queue at all.
---
It‚Äôs the best when they do voice messages. That way you can hear the salt in their voice
---
Nerfed the hell out of Nurse by adding a dinging noise for when you refresh your blink. What a tragic nerf.

Jesus this freddy is sweating. Swing chains (probably with red paint brush), I'm assuming ruin (since there's two people injured, one man on hook and only one gen done), and sloppy butcher. This guy is so scared of getting gen rushed that he is running all the game delay he can afford on a killer who already has the map pressure and chase ability to deal with it.

Well it's just logical. In any video game. Most players are bad. Take League of Legends for example. MOST people that play league are at or under Silver 4 (NA). being Platinum is like top 20-10%( I forget what exactly but its high). So if you're a high elo League of Legends player on forums or reddits and you get downvoted or argued with by the majority and they turn out to be wrong it's because the majority of them are low rank / skill. Same logic applies to this game. Most of the people on here are bad but just like the league reddit where everyone is diamond+ everyone on here is multiple red rank 1 killer/surv player XD. fucking dumb ass hell I was right there with you my friend. Anyone who thought hawkins was survivor favored is legit trolling. I have two escapes on that map ever, and 1 of the times the pig let me escape and the other is the hatch.

Mention me again if the download link is down
---
Rat fink of course
---
even if i‚Äôm the last person and they drop me before the hook
---
Truly balanced.
---
I really hope you are being sarcastic, but my gut feeling is telling me otherwise
---
Shhh, no need to make sense
---
Oh no, not that, if he picks you up and takes two steps to hook, drops you, picks you up and takes two steps to hook etc etc then he is paranoid you'll hit him with Decisive Strike, which will immediately free you from his grasp and stun him. It's activated by a skill check, but it takes two or three seconds to happen. If he drops you quick, you'll never get a chance to hit that skill check and escape.
---
Crawl towards Killer to rat out their location.
---
So you should not save at all with 4 gens up?
---
i still dont see the issue with cross platform
---
when i play or see both they seem pretty slimier and the stats seemed to be backed up with experience
---
Doesn't that mean BBQ is just a normal perk that doesn't require its teachable to be unlocked? I've heard people say that is the case.
---
Freddy is easier to use than nurse, which skews the strength. The forever Freddy build is also disgusting, which will also skew the numbers. As others have pointed out nurse is harder to use in general, which will make her numbers look worse in most cases. But a really good nurse will be more successful than a really good Freddy because she can ignore loops.
---
i see how it can be frustrating but at the same time, who gives a shit? either way.
---
survivors t bagging bc they think they‚Äôre good and or cool are douchebags. period. if i‚Äôm  gonna be proud of something and not be humble it‚Äôs gonna be about my paycheck amount, car or something. if i ever ‚Äút bag‚Äù btw it‚Äôs meant as a thank you or ‚Äúgood shit‚Äù 
---
killers that cry about t baggers? why? theyre wasting their time pressing a key or button. and like i said they think they‚Äôre cool. usually those that gotta flaunt it, ain‚Äôt shit. 
---
that‚Äôs just me tho.
---
only time i could see getting pissed about it is if there was money on the line
---
ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It's an anti-slugging perk
---
It‚Äôs situational. Very good against a slugger.
---
well its not a tier list its just win rate
---
As a car guy, I am for this idea.
---
My mental image of a creepy Mechanic killer would be:
---
\- Tall, because it just makes sense  
---
\- Visible skin seems a bit dotted due to Oil stains, aswell as regulary showing scars from Cuts aswell Bruises  
---
\- walks/stands slightly hunched to the front (see TF2¬¥s Engineer), maybe even slightly to a side  
---
\- medium lenght(aka, shoulders), slick/silken, black hair with or without ponytail  
---
\- Thick Welding googles where you can see his eyes slightly shimmering red/orange/grey  
---
\- A thick U Beard/Hulk Hogan Beard  
---
\- Dark grey Jeans with a utility belt, both seem heavily used/scratched/oily  
---
\- A oily/dusty Tanktop with a Dark grey Jacked (not leather)  
---
\- Mechanic Gloves on both hands  
---
\- Weapon in left hand, some sort of Oil can in his right (Because i want a left handed Killer, lol)  
---
\- His oil would have a rather deep purple tinge because realistic black oil would be far to hard to see
---
I haven't seen it in any bloodweb, so either I'm very unlucky or it's just not there
---
I had a slight panic attack seeing the toolbox, thinking that hook was 99% sabo'd.
---
High risk high reqard, and only really works well in specific builds (That generally require SWF to really pull off.) It's fun to run though.
---
Its takes aboutvas long on Xbox so I imagine switch is worse
---
nope this guys was picking me up, walking half way across the map and dropping me then doing it again
---
Killing us with nostalgia? Something about him just screams "member the 90s?"
---
Depends on the killer, if they could have the game read the certain killer and then give you a specific exit gate spawn depending on the killer that would be cool. 
---
Like for Billy, Wraith, Hag, Huntress Demo the gates should be on each corners of the map cause of their ability to get across the map and take control easily. 
---
But still they shouldn't spawn on the same wall. It could be a 0.01% that it should happen cause it's not fair in any situation.
---
people act like this is a tier list 
---
its just overall kill rate
---
we all know nurse is the best in correct hands
---
hag can do so aswell but the stats just show that most nurse players cant get over 50% and most freddy players can get 3 or more a game
---
its not based on what we know its about how the community is preforming
---
Matchmaking: *I see this as an absolute win!*
---
But it tells them that it‚Äôs anti slug so why would they leave you on the ground?
---
You‚Äôd be surprised man, I just quit questioning killer logic sometimes.
---
Yea..that wasn‚Äôt a very fun match
---
You know the killer is going to face camp you when he catches you. Gotta keep the secret safe.
---
is the switch really 30 FPS? Why the hell is that thing still $300?
---
I think Passive sleeping is the culprit for most of the issues with Freddy. His snares are just upgraded version of Clowns power and make it literally impossible to ‚Äúloop‚Äù. Theres basically no chase interaction because the snares make it impossible to ‚Äúwin‚Äù a chase or do anything but insta drop the pallet because if you dont you get hit. You have to wake up in order to actually play the chase but even that barely makes a difference.
---
If there was a killer who was just 115% and has Freddy‚Äôs snares, they‚Äôd be ridiculous. Clown is the closest thing to that but when you compare the two Clown actually has checks and balances made in his power to make it not so broken compared to snares. Clown gets slowed down when he throws the bottle, he actually has to aim the bottle, the gas takes awhile to disperse, he has to reload his bottles after 4 throws and theres a cooldown between throws.
---
Compare that to Freddy‚Äôs 10 snares active at a time that have no cooldown and no reload time and no slowdown when placing. The snares also are placed on the ground, meaning that you will never ‚Äúmiss‚Äù a snare because the survivor is forced to path there. 
---
If you removed passive sleeping, then Freddy would actually have to get a hit in by playing a chase correctly in order to become ‚ÄúClown++++‚Äù
---
His speed shouldn‚Äôt be hindered while he throws bottles. Also his reload time take way too long
---
He actually first appeared in 1963. But I definitely see what you mean.
---
i bought f13 when it first came out for like $40 and i hated how the game played so i got a refund
---
I would genuinely love this! Although I don‚Äôt see how this could be brought into reality
---
Sort of. Playing Killer can be very stressful. I don't know what platform you play on but I would recommend to disable messaging or any features to help block the haters.
---
We need killers like you to help promote sportsmanship and to humble toxic survivors and to just humble people overall
---
with that malicious intent, it is shitty. but not the t baggin itself. the mockery in general. like they ain‚Äôt ever got worked on before. 
---
and if someone‚Äôs better than someone else in a game with no money on the line, just move on to the next. there‚Äôs always someone better and worse than us all.
---
idk maybe it‚Äôs because of certain personal problems i‚Äôll dealing with but there‚Äôs WAY more shit to get pissed at. 
---
like i said in my other comment...remember this next time it happens: t baggin at the gate or after a pallet is like mocking someone after their team hit a field goal in the first quarter the first game of preseason. lol. shit don‚Äôt mean anything
---
It can‚Äôt be. My killer queue times are almost instant.
---
A good trapper is always fun but really any killer that is camping IDC about tunneling as much
---
Billy isn't OP come on dude
---
Nah just a visual bug, fixed itself after the next game.
---
They have the /s in the comment
---
There is literally one person left in the video and the hatch is closed.
---
K didn‚Äôt know what that meant thanks
---
did you read what i said, i said billy is OP with insta saw. He is allowed to basically instantly break pallets and spam saw, its the only thing that needs to be changed with him.
---
I relate so much it hurts
---
Please don't tell me tier lists are back. They were banned for a reason
---
I agree with the first part. But technically... the killer is always at the hook notification when somebody gets hooked, so isn't that the BBQ functionality?
---
&gt;I feel it should have some extra BP gains in there too. 
---
WGLF exists. David's perks work really well together.
---
I think you deserve that for having those perks equipped.
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night, buddy. Moving on.
---
SWF is definitely bullshit and should be removed imo. Gen Rush? You mean completing the only objective in the game at this current time? Tea bagging and end game toxicity- grow some thicker skin? Borrowed time helps against a camping killer and Decisive strike helps against a tunneling killer. What is wrong with that? Adrenaline rewards the survivors for completing the objects while injured. High risk, High reward.
---
I do play killer, not as much as survivor though. I think the greater problem is the broken matchmaking. I'd rather play zero games than go up against red ranks as a rank 10 killer. But sure, focus on survivor perks and addons...
---
I understand the concept of PVP and PVE. Thanks, but you can keep your trophy along with all the cheesy pink addons and moris that killers can utilize. You sound like a sweaty spirit/nurse killer, no fun allowed.
---
I'm still new to the game and to the subreddit, if it's been posted before then I apologize.
---
Her skill floor is pretty high as well, its why she's the worst Killer at low ranks - people derp around with her, without really the skill to play her
---
Then u 4% and open with a key
---
Theres not much you can do against Freddy.
---
November 28th to December 5th
---
Every other killer or survivor 50% off with cells
---
All pre stranger things cosmetics 30% off with cells
---
how does it encourage farming teammates if you don't get a stack for unsafe hooks?
---
Painkiller he's a nice dude met him in overwatch
---
Also it takes around 20 minutes to find a match
---
That's literally what the new Kindred does though. Except instead of 4 seconds, it's the entire time the survivor is hooked.
---
You can do a lot, it's playing the game normally. Dream Snares are strong but can be defeated, Dream Pallets are easy to detect with enough time in the game.
---
Wait, Feng isn't free on PC?
---
The longer you stay the more XP you get. Approximately 10 min. should be enough.
---
Less you stay the less XP you receive.
---
You can idle in-game? It does the same trick. Even if it's a lazy move.
---
I wish survivors in dbd had the same opinion about self care that the dbd subreddit has. 
---
PC - purple/red ranks, almost every survivor has self care.
---
Really? Takes me like 20 seconds usually
---
Hell no i rather stick with balanced
---
What is the picture from?
---
The one upside is that if you loose to a bunch of high ranked survivors you can just blame matchmaking and if you win, well then you beat high ranked survivors. I dont really find it matters though. Half the time red rabled survivors are super boosted and green ranked survivors can kick my ass. If I stop being optimistic, the pain of being destroyed by a red swf group as a rank 9 will shred my soul into a million peices.
---
I was almost thinking it could work like a reverse bbq/dark sense, where a safe unhook triggers you seeing the killer for 5/6/7 seconds, it encourages team play and you only get the reward once you get the safe unhook message so it doesn't reward farming
---
The Victim mentality is crazy. Stats show that killers are overperforming and doing pretty well on average....well that means the stats are wrong and my anecdotes are right.
---
if reddit killers didnt have their data collected the kill rate would be even higher, probably a 3k average.
---
Lucky you. It actually takes me around 10 minutes to find a lobby as a survivor and I only managed to play killer once because of 20 minute wait time
---
Actually no. For killer it‚Äôs about 2 minutes and survivor it‚Äôs less than 1
---
fun fact 
---
i have seen and or know people that would pay to see demo-dog fuck Quentin in the ass
---
Hey man, I was around to play the pre-release beta, and played the shit out of the game from release until the relaunch (stopped playing just before that).
---
Before Wraith was nerfed, I was ranked in the top 10 for that monster in NA. I miss playing Wraith so much.
---
A game like that is hard to balance, and TRS didn't do a perfect job, but I don't have ill feelings towards them. The gaming community at large turned their backs on the game before they even had a chance to play it, and the bad publicity had the game sinking all the way until it died, and I blame THAT on 2K. If it wasn't for that, I think the game would have kept chugging along. Perhaps not as popular as DbD is now, but it would have survived.
---

How do you mean "with cells"
---
I've already touched him
---
*A l l  o v e r*
---
Nobody thinks of it this way, but Franklin's is a game slow down perk in a way. You mentioned it a few times - survivors can just go back and pick up their items. Which takes time. Or they can continue repairing without their toolbox, or look for teammate to heal and waste their time instead of healing themselves with medkit.
---
Fun Fact
---
*why*
---
I love when survivors don't cleanse lmao. I can easily find them and one shot them.
---
I cant understand something that isn‚Äôt true.
---
Do you play on other platforms?
---
Dream snares cannot be defeated when you‚Äôre asleep though. They guarentee a hit if the survivor attempts to play the loop.
---
Hmm... The letters seem to spell out FYLAK... what is the entity trying to tell us
---
as a killer I'm happy to get into a post game lobby where I lost and see nothing but "gg" from all the survivors, instead of the usual insults. I'll always say gg back. If someone can't even say gg to you without being offended, the problem is you.
---
You sound like a total badass dude
---
ExactlyüòÅ
---
I mean, same with DS. Killer picks you up, you DS them, you run a few meters ahead, killer follows your scratch marks and you go right back down again.

I read this as perfect orgasm and got confused.

Franklins uses up charges on the item, so for many medkits now, they won't be able to heal a survivor to full when picked up again.

I love susie. She seems super innocent.
---
Damn, I think I'm just lucky then. I have played since ps4 release only got 1 salty message. Killer main btw(Hag, Wraith and Nurse). 
---
I'm sorry that happened to you and your bf.
---
Or use it how I do - randomly placing it down because it looks cool and then leaving the map nearby so that other people can mess around with it too
---
damn that‚Äôs a lot of typos
---
So it means that I can save more by buying it using cells than buying it on Steam?

It certainly  doesnt  help. Played nurse in a kyf with host being in  4-5hr different  timezone. God it was a horrific  experience rubber banding or a blink strike missing due to ping

---
Dude, thus was on phone and i didnt want to go word to word making sure its all correct
---
So much wrong here.
---
&gt;This doesn't account for disconnects, moris, hook suicide...
---
First of all, we are comparing the differences in survivor survival rate by party size. As *all* of these factors affect *both* groups they are *not applicable* when comparing the *delta*. The difference between solo and 4 man survival is only around 8% and that is irrelevant of all points you made there. Now where those two points that have an 8 percent difference lay on the chart can be disputed, but the delta cannot as they are relative to one another under the same random variables
---
This is basic statistics.
---
&gt;You are picking and choosing what supports you're argument
---
I have literally used all statistics available, how is that picking and choosing? I'm supplying you with literally all known facts, you just don't like that the results contradict your bias
---
&gt;Play in red ranks without ruin or BBQ....
---
Okay? Survivors are using meta perks too. That's why it's called a meta. This is literally any game.
---
&gt;You are a FOOL like everyone else in this thread
---
If you go to a store and smell someone who stinks like an asshole, well they probably stink like an asshole. If you go everywhere and all you smell is asshole, you're the asshole
---
The only ‚Äúunfair‚Äù part is if no gens are complete and the hatch opens. 
---
That being said, it‚Äôs done this way so matches don‚Äôt last 50 min. Survivors will hide until killer DCs. 
---
And the goal of the killer is to kill by ‚Äúany means necessary‚Äù. If it bugs you, go tryhard and slug the 3rd. 
---
I will add that keys are pretty bs now that you can‚Äôt snatch survivors out of the hatch. Unless you have franklins, they escape.
---
Don't forget the meme's making fun of people making the same meme's
---
That is fucked up.
---
running it with iron will counters stridor tho :)
---
Dude, its rarley for balancing, here is what i mean [keys](https://twitter.com/foomongus/status/1199568014573654016?s=19)
---
You are gonna die, I swear it
---
A free heal STATE
---
Don‚Äôt copy peoples ideas!
---
Hatches are the reverse of moris.
---
Using a key to escape with your team is a pink mori. Escaping as the final survivor is a green mori. Escaping as the last survivor after the others have left via gates is a yellow mori.
---
Just like it sucks as a survivor to deal with the RNG of a killer deciding to bring a mori, the killers have to deal with keys. I think it's perfectly fair.
---
Also your objective as the killer is not to kill survivors, if it was the only thing measured score wise would be number of kills.
---
**The life of a Reddit Killer‚Ñ¢Ô∏è**

---
‚ÄúUgh I depipped! WTF BHVR. And the dwight got hatch. Killer is so underpowered. And I only got to play 1 match in an hour, god matchmaking is so bad.‚Äù
---
This is why I like Dead by Daylight over other games.  I mostly main killer.  My outcome is completely due to my own performance.  I can't blame anyone but myself.  I forgot to use the Pop Goes the Weasel.  I lost the survivor.  I spent too long chasing that one survivor.  It falls on me.  
---
I also find it highly amusing that the horror game I play is less stressful than most of the other games I play.
---
I saw that and felt the urge not to upvote. Glad i didnt.
---
Does report work?
---
I just love your art style. I want more!!
---
Upvoted because zappy boi
---
&gt;That's it, there is no other point I'm making.
---
But that "point" is saying nothing other than "yes there are players that can maintain a kill rate of a least 2 kills in red ranks". Even regardless again of the fact that it is not impossible to (safety-)pip without at least 2 kills and possible to depip with 3 or 4 kills and rank thus does not even necessarily favour kill rate, there is no statistical "mistake" here, and the fact that the killers that are red rank maintain a high kill rate says very clear things about (public match) balance.
---
The kill rate is above 50% across the board, so according to your logic, every average killer should end up in red ranks sooner or later. And if they can't maintain their kill rate there and drop out - and then again manage to hit that kill rate and re-enter red ranks, and drop out again, and so on - their red rank results (less than on average two kills) are of course counted toward red rank. These stats count match outcomes toward the rank a player was at the time the match started. So there should be tons and tons of less-than-two-kills outcomes counted toward red ranks from people dropping out of rank 4 because of it. But I've pointed out why that is not really relevant either.
---
I would say the other thing this data tells us is that getting shit on by one swf every 10 matches really sours how you feel you did, even if the other 9 matches were you killing potatoes. I know I'm guilty of this too sometimes
---
Just like Unbreakable except you're not injured all the time and you recover quicker.
---
Couldnt read ..   too many typos.  Unfortunately i gotta give you a downvote
---
Freddy is definitely not bad. A good Freddy can have insane map pressure with the gen teleport combined with stuff like pop and discordance, plus he has a pretty good selection of add ons to slow down the game. He can still get bullied by a good team, and is by no means overpowered, but he‚Äôs viable. Saying all that as a Freddy main myself btw. But yeah Nurse is still the best, I agree.
---
Then do it quick. No need for a liars death.
---
In other words you‚Äôre an asshole.
---
Well all 3 together is 1050, so it'd be the $10 pack of cells
---
I bet tinkerer would be great too.
---
If hatches are reverse moris then why do they spawn without any offering? And i see keys 10x more often then moris. And the one objective killer has is to kill, thats like saying a survivors objective is not to survive. And its not fair, niether are moris but atleast you get a warning before moris. And [here](https://twitter.com/foomongus/status/1199568014573654016?s=19) is what i mean
---
\*The Entity
---
Imo, make gens take just a lil bit longer to complete by default (not as much as ruin would make it take, but it would last throughout the match) and delete ruin. Would make everyone happy, killers for not having 1 perk slot locked to ruin and survivors for not having to deal with ruin anymore. Won't happen, but I at least think that would be for the best.
---
There were 4 gens completed. They activated adrenaline. 
---
Seems fair. Frustrating, but fair. 
---
Like I said, it‚Äôs really just bs when there‚Äôs no gens done and the last survivor keys.
---
&gt; TF2, Overwatch, CS:GO, Fortnite 
---
1/2 of the games I listed or two/forths.
---
&gt;Turns out people didnt really like microtransactions in a game they had to spend 40-60 dollars on until recently, 
---
That's kind of a terrible argument. When I asked you why you aren't up in arms your reaction is "Well people have gotten more complacent with it now."  
---
No, people just cared way too much about cosmetic microtransactions when Evolve did it, but hypocritically do not give two shits when other games, paid or not also do it.
---
Happy cake day!
---
This post again?!
---
if a billy with insta saw back scratches you there is nothing you can do, you say tires work but he doesnt get slowed down enough for it to matter.
---
Insta saw is just babys first billy game
---
C-C-C-COMBO
---
it does but only when we get reports but we never did for this. but now ik what is going on ill look for the post and of course remove it
---
This right here. 
---
Not to mention the hatch isn‚Äôt really as RNG as you‚Äôre making it out to be, maps usually only have a few locations for the hatch to spawn in 5-10 I would guess is pretty accurate, and a lot of maps like The preschool have a very solid chance for it to spawn in one location ie the furnace area.  That‚Äôs not to mention that the hatch prespawns if enough gens are done so you can find it before the last person is dead. 
---
All of this exists to make a more balanced experience for both killers and survivors. There are plenty of times in maps where killers can see both gates from a central location and survivors have no chance to open the door once the hatch is shut. Just like there are times survivors find a key and all get out.
---
It is applicable because if you added in the factors it would decrease both results.
---
Just like seeing what percent of all survivors survive against ruin/ cant survive against ruin.
---
survivors have several meta perks; more than two. 
---
pig and trapper have higher kill rates than nurse in red ranks, does that mean we need to nerf them NO, because this data has ZERO explanation. 
---
This vague ass data is supporting survivor bias, so of course the thread is gonna be filled with survivors you fuckwit.
---
So take you're condescending remarks somewhere else
---
What PC gets + Doc, Hag and I think Clown and Spirit
---
Lignama
---
I have ill will towards TRS due to their terrible development choices and their terrible community management.
---
Every suggestion I ever gave them on their primary forums they would later go on to add in Stage 2. Had they added literally any sort of reasonable development to the game prior to that, it could've lived.
---
Also their community was garbage and full of toxic people and they refused to fix it.
---
I am typing on mobile too it only takes a minute to look at what you are posting...while you type.
---
Yeah it doesn't work like that anymore because DS procs during pick up animation now.
---
Ruin doesn‚Äôt need a nerf.
---
People already do gens with Ruin, so...asking for a nerf is basically saying "remove that perk from the game"
---
i didn‚Äôt downvote it i agree with you i‚Äôm just saying that there‚Äôs a lot of typos
---
removed for repost this was already posted before https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/8y64gf/xenomorph_killer_concept_the_alien/
---
sometimes i‚Äôll see a survivor teabag at the killer from behind a pallets or at the gate and im like hah wow that bogus oh well lol
---
but when im playing killer im ready to throw myself into another dimension when they do it to me
---
but its amazing how often they think theyre close enough to get out but theyre  n o t   : )
---
I don't like the stats we got. No PC/XBONE/PS split like we had before and it's just called "RED RANKS" which says nothing. getting to rank 4 is much easier than getting to rank 1 and maintaining it
---
You should get awarded points purely off existing within the game.
---
This is actually a pretty good template for this, gh
---
just like to say I have took action on that post and next time any of you see a repost that someone else did please feel free to summon me with the proof and I will take action as soon as I see it or please report as a repost and the others will see and take care of it
---
Nay, sure ruin is annoying to play against but it‚Äôs super helpful. I actually think they should nerf gen speed
---
I play on PC and catch myself doing this all the time. Sometimes I also "lean" around corners.
---
OP: I feel cheated out of my blood points because survivors DC'd.

Survivor: I feel cheated out of my blood points because killer slugged.
---
This game is an interactive experience, like playing hide and seek and tag. Its why bloodpoints are based on objectives, not just escaping or killing. If you want people to play with you, then you have to uphold your end of the experience.
---
Don't be that guy that shows up to the theme party in a jeans and t-shirt. Its how you stop getting invited to parties.

why did you post this twice
---
I played a few games with Myers and bing bong and clearly saw teabagging survivors in the distance
---
I do this when I get pallet stunned too
---
You're right the point system is being improved every day and is 10x better than what it used to be, it will eventually be more balanced but killers have the pressure to gain points due to the historical context of the game. 
---
Whenever kills were entirely the determination of rank, soft camping was much more prevalent and viable. Promoting everyone's experience is what the new system does, the camping meta was boring for everyone.
---
I'm not giving excuses, I'm giving legitimate BHVR approved responses. If you view them as excuses instead of design philosophies, then I cant help you.
---
More like time...BHVR at this point probably has the money to make the game look AAA more or less...it would just take a good bit of time to make that change and the only effective way to do this with a game that has already launched is slowly putting in the changes overtime.
---
easy way not to get grabbed by prayer beads spirit, as told by my red rank teammates: just don‚Äôt do anything ever, at all, for any reason, ever. urban evade around the map waiting for everyone else to die so you can take hatch. it‚Äôs a great strategy
---
I've been saying this for years. Survivor pip progression is garbage. You have 4 people competing for the same emblems when they are supposed to be a team. Even with them completing for emblems it's still almost impossible to de pip. I actually cant remember the last time I de pipped as survivor. Its black pip at worst. Even in games where I get hard camped I can almost always do enough to safety. 
---
Then you have killer where 1 emblem you have no control over. If gens get done, which they will, you lose the 1st emblem( forgot the name of it) and its significantly harder to pip with killer as opposed to survivor. Never made much sense to me. Especially since playing killer is harder to begin with.
---
Me, a Myers with tombstone and hair: *Shambles at you like a crippled decrepit 200 year old and accidentally trips on a rock on my way to the exit gate while all the survivors laugh and spit on me and break my walker*
---
they cannot see you but they know you can see them that is how the perk works now
---
You can't see the killer but you can use it like a no cooldown premonition. The killer only shows up in your field of view so you can use that to figure out where they are.
---
‚ÄúHey welcome to the band‚Äù-Joe
---
Adrenaline FEELS better,  while Hope can yield better results.
---
And again - DbD is not supposed to be competitive. Rank is absolutely useless. So no need for that
---
I can see where you are coming from here. I feel as if the option for escape needs to be removed for survivors, and have it boil down to survive for x amont of time or last one standing, but the chances of that happening are laughably low. BHVR would have to completely rework the game at that piont. But, if survivors can't win and killers can't lose, well id like to believe that would lower the toxicity at least a little.
---
I wouldn't mind if it was like a reverse play with food. Start with 5 stacks, each hit removes a stack and once you run out of stacks the perk is done. Slows the starting game down enough for killers to get set up/ have pressure on the map but doesn't make the end game with less people impossible.
---
Sensational love it
---
Dude, i dont want moris to reward killers, i just dont want keys to reward survivors. In fact i would have the purple and red/pink key removed, and the ebony and ivory mori removed. But the keys are way more often and extremly irratating
---
Add Poised for no scratch marks during Adrenaline speed burst
---
You are correct that should have is should‚Äôve, and should have works, but because English is forsaken by all gods, should‚Äôve is used as past tense.
---
My apologies, I literally hadn't seen it before. Still pretty new to the game and didn't know this bug existed.
---
When your favorite survivor isn‚Äôt on there :(
---
What the hell happened?
---
I see what you‚Äôre doing, you just want to be 420 gotcha.
---
&gt; CSGO, team fortress 2 and fortnite are all f2p. But thats besides the point. 
---
Actually you're right, and I was wrong about CS:GO. My bad.
---
As far as Evolve, back in 2014, microtransactions and lootboxes were still *very* common. When Evolve launched, it launched with it's "Hunting Pass" with the promise of not all content, just the first pack, and then they made the foolish mistake of slapping all skin packs on the steam store in the "DLC" section. News outlets and misinformed gamers took one look at that and said "I have to buy over $80 of DLC just to get the full experience ON TOP of a $60 entry fee? Fuck that greedy shit".
---
In reality, Evolve had some of the least egregious microtransactions to date. For some reason, gamers and media crucified it for being "the last straw", except they murdered the game and then went back to lopping up CoD reskin sequels year after year, buying season passes and P2W content right alongside cosmetics.
---
I can't say that Evolve *didn't* have blatant microtransactions shoved in consumer's faces, but they were all cosmetic and the DLC was simply a Season Pass for the first chunk of characters. People didn't like that so they killed it. Evolve's DLC is literally no different than Rainbow Six Siege's today, Evolve just got fucked royally.

&gt;Having to always bring Whispers

You are missing the point. It's not required, it just gives you basically 100% chance to win.
---
Oh by the way, Happy Cake Day r/deadbydaylight
---
I don't gr it. Why did the guy wrote "wtf is this"?
---
i feel like it does not really need a buff and it does what it was always meant to do
---
Are you offending the lord?
---
Forgot to mention that the new affect will only work After the first 2 minutes are over
---
I have no idea, dude I shitpost for the sole purpose of griefing and then someone takes it too far.
---
I believe BL was made so much stronger because some maps, especially around the time it got buffed, it was pretty much useless aside from maybe 1 or 2 spots on the map. Now, there's maps where it's basically an exploit to use. However, despite being a good perk still, it's not really worth taking over, as most are saying, lithe because it just doesn't really do much on some maps.
---
Me: *sees a teammate that cleanse*
---
Also me ‚ÄúWhy do I hear intense heartbeats?‚Äù
---
I wouldn't consider hag a M1 killer since usually traps (mouse 2) play a really big role in getting the hit, to the point that most times it isn't even worth it to chase someone running in a direction with no traps.
---
Usually M1 killer tend to not relay that much on their power to catch people. If a M1 killer was a killer that can only damage by pressing M1, then that definition would also include Nurse and Spirit, which doesn't make that much sense
---
That is really good
---

---
Thanks, I didn't know that reposting was against the rules so I posted this to kinda shame them, like r/karmacourt 
---
You should add No Reposting to the rules tab on the side of the subreddit. I know it's in the full rules section but I think 99% of people won't actually read the full rules section and just glance at the sidebar
---
I...I think that crow threw an axe at you.
---
There is no way that this wasn't recorded in a non peer to peer connection match, killer would've crashed a long time ago if it was in the servers
---
go outside or something lol
---
Also, there are actually 3 groups of perks.
---
Tiers       1,         2 ,         3:
---
1. Yellow, Yellow, Green
---
2. Yellow, Green, Purple
---
3. Green, Purple, Purple
---
Why? cuz there are actually 5 rarities!
---
Brown, Yellow, Green, Purple, Pink(or red)
---
Brown is shown as Yellow and Pink(or red) is shown as Purple
---
Why?
---
They used to display, but there were problems with processing speeds back in the day (game couldn't handle 5 sprites, lol)
---
For example: You should‚Äôve asked if anybody wanted a grammar lesson.
---
this would make ruin one of the worst perks in the game
---
i didn't camp the body. they probably were "trying " to draw me away from the body, but i was literally downing them on top of each other. and by the time i had 3 downs looking like a human centipede, and i heard the 4th, i just kinda ran him down cuz why wouldn't i? then everyone d/c'd as i picked them up but they waited till they were the ones picked up to d/c
---
ok boomer.
---
stats dont mean shit. Survivor skill is largely inconsistent. I want to see you deal with brand new part gen rushers as clown lmao, see how much you can do even if you are able to end chases quickly
---
That's good feedback! Do you regularly hand out trash?
---
* I dont know about you,  but I call this an utter success*

He's not whining about the mask. He's whining about her face in game compared to her concept art. Mostly he's just whining.

Using Legion's Meg skin will considerably increase Feral Frenzy's movement speed
---
I spin around and make Feng nice and dizzy :)
---
We all know that most people just play as baby dweets to get hatch. I do respect baby survivors but most just tend to t beg when they drop a pallet.
---
I should‚Äôve just kept swiping instead of wasting a few minutes of my life correcting someone‚Äôs title, which can‚Äôt be edited.

Wait a min , I had the same team join me too , do tell me was Laurie the toxic one ?
---
I love to think this is what the killers do outside of the trials
---
DUDE YOURE A LEGEND.
---
ooohh ok
---
Holy shiet bro. Thanks a lot
---
Actual meta perk for soloQ Pog
---
thank you so much
---
Those numbers, nice.
---
As others have said, the answer is to do gens instead of going for the save.  Also, Kindred is an all around great perk, and is useful even if the killer is not camping, although I recognize that perks=/=counterplay. It's still worth looking into, especially since it's getting buffed next patch to be active when any survivor is on the hook, instead of just the user. Others have already talked about bt and ds.  Prove Thyself, which situationally allows you to finish gens faster, is also a decent perk against camping because it improves your ability to focus gens.
---
Serial campers also have a tendency to run NOED, so make sure you have something up your sleeve for that, too. You don't have to do totems to counter NOED, you can just memorize every totem you see, and then check them for NOED after gens are powered. Normally, I don't like this method of NOED countering and prefer to actually cleanse totems, but when the killer is camping, you're on the clock for two minutes. You probably don't have time to cleanse dulls in that situation.
---
what ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù are you talking about? just admit ur bad bro its really not that big of a deal the game is casual as all hell anyways. Its only a problem when you delude yourself into thinking its not you and its the games fault for your losses.
---
On switch killer que time are like 10 minutes max.
---
Happy to help!
---
It also reveals the killers sure when he's near the hook
---
No problem!
---
No sweat!
---
The hatch was created by a survivor it's in the lore I just don't remember who
---
Wow two for one! Garbage spills out of your mouth so naturally, does your ass gets jealous of the shit that comes out?
---
I'm sick of getting Entity Displeased on 3k's as Plague.

Have a good one.
---
Almost as if.. that's the whole point.. wow
---
To me he sounds like an elephant
---
3 years is not that much if you ask me lol
---
I feel like they should actually ban people or give them like disadvantages in game if they just DC because of a character they don‚Äôt like going against . It ruins the experience for both sides .
---
That‚Äôll be a good buff or also make totems undoable
---
110s mad

Quinton for sure

Rule#32  Enjoy the little things
---
Deathgarden was more of a miscarriage.
---
As a Nancy main, I could not scroll past this without giving it the medal it deserves
---
Of course it is not enough to *counter* the entire build. The slowdown will be there. If you could counter a build with one perk that would be pretty stupid. 
---
But it will definitely help you.
---
It has a funny knee and that's basically it.
---
Lol I‚Äôm sorry
---
Me playing killer, whining over being blind and loosing survivors later
---
[This](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hatch)
---
&gt;During one of their weekly Streams, Developers Dave and Ash revealed the¬†Hatch¬†having a deep connection with a particular Character. Said Character has been mentioned at least at some point in the Game.
---
&gt;Vigo¬†is a potential candidate, given his ability to create things and¬†"bend the Fog's irrefragable rules."
---
That perk is a shit when the dedicated servers, it never works, only works to catch up a pallet or a vault
---
I actually already saved up a million and use 100k and refill it to 950k before putting it back down to 900. Easy with BBQ
---
Shut up you fucking goon, I only meant when she has her ranged attack ready I would do more to stay out of chases.
---
I hardly play survivor. the number of times I've been the one let go in a game is unreal. It's like other killers know.
---
Do you not realize there's a huge amount of people that will intentionally not cleanse, so Plague can't get her red bile?
---
Bro...
---
Love this
---
Hahahahah
---
It is
---
Indeed
---
That's just taking advantage of how close they are to death. You have 2 healthy healthy survivors, one who still needs to be hooked 3 times and one who only needs to be hooked twice. Going after the weaker one is just smarter.
---
I know this is all a matter of opinion anyway, but imo *real* tunneling is when you would choose the same survivor every time, even when they're healthy and someone right next to them is injured and has the same amount of hooks. That's just pure hate for that survivor.
---
Show me the printer first!
---
Me when I come to DBD from deathgarden and expect killers to be powerful
---
Waiting 5-10 minutes to create your killer lobby and 5 more to find e everyone just to see people dc when you shock the reality into them with the doctor. At the first 15sec without landing a direct hit.
---
he is leterally seething behind his moniter
---
I just mean when you spend your saved up million blood points on the new chapter then you can do the challenges from the archives you saved because you get quite a few blood points from them and then save up another million to put into the characters.
---
O really hate when people tbag , but I don‚Äôt Tunnel or camp them for that , I find it boring and stupid
---
Imo he has extremely high skill requirements to get full use of his power, he is very addon reliable (which isn't that bad, yet it is annoying), he is very punishing and making a mistake can easily prolong the chase for an extremely long time, ruining the game for you, he has no surefire ways to shut down long loops like main building in grim pantry or Campbell's chapel
---
As he is not mobile, he has to rely on perks to apply pressure which also restricts your builds (I do not use one and the same meta build every game, so it is a nuisance for me).
---
Yeah, I have about 100k in the archives ready and I  will save my dailys too

I thought it was supposed to be Steve Harrington but the hair doesn't look like his.
---
Had a cocky feng with a flashlight click me all game and then when i got the 4k she called clown op lol.
---
I had a survivor lag out during a game, messaged me laughing and saying that *I* DC'd while I was still in the match. So I sent them a screenshot of the postgame screen that clearly showed three sacrifices with their gamertag showing the disconnected icon. They still said I quit. I swear, it was like a real depiction of that Patrick and Manray meme.
---
I hear the faintest "Wah", interesting.
---
This is exactly why I think he's a bit op
---
Looks like Freddy finally decided to chase his dreams and become the deadliest killer in the game, what an inspiration
---
Oh ok, so they know the directions but not the distance
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. I started by playing survivor only and while I still prefer it, I started playing killer for the Rift and really enjoy it! It‚Äôs also made me better at playing both sides and also understand why a killer may do certain things I find annoying as a survivor and vice versa.
---
18 vs rank 1's? Time to facecamp.
---
Switch version is currently $20 at Best Buy, it‚Äôs more than worth it my dude!
---
Dedicated servers.
---
Listen. I'm a killer main as well. Try survivor. Get to rank 1 on both sides, it really opens your eyes to how unbalanced and shitty the game is for both sides
---
Suggested it apparently itll cost to much for a new exo to make a spider killer..... or however that post malone song went
---
I remember seeing the Xenormorph idea some time ago and saw it recently here aswell, i thought the OP had credited the original author though, what an asshole
---
As someone who‚Äôs Colorblind it‚Äôs the easiest maps to see the scratch marks, so I rarely lose anyone on those. It‚Äôs just a pain to play trapper on them.
---
The game is very active on the switch and takes less than a minute to find a match
---
I mean no, you spend 32 seconds every heal with botany SC, thats not counting perks like sloppy or thana which will litterally make botany feel like its not even there.
---
You spend 30 secs going into the basement and searching a chest to get the medkit, you can do it at any point in time, and thats only basement chest.
---
if you are a decent player you will understand that taking over a min to heal 2 times is worse then taking 20~ secs to heal. and you really dont need to be healed constantly
---
But then the survivors can't genrush 5 gens in 1 and a half minutes with purple toolboxes for adrenaline and teabag at the exit gate!
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
As someone who has fully bought into the cult, the secret reason people like Dead Hard is... because it‚Äôs fun.
---
Overall, the best exhaustion is probably Sprint Burst, it‚Äôs literally just free distance at the start of a chase, but it‚Äôs so rewarding and enjoyable to make a play with Dead Hard that I just can‚Äôt make myself drop it, even with dedicated servers making it so shit right now.
---
And 3 unhooks on 4 level, 4 basement hooks in 1 trial, and other "cool" stuff
---
I agree with you that it's way easier for the killer to find the hatch. (Since he's faster and doesn't have to be careful while looking for it.)  
---
But many say that the EGC favors the killer and I wouldn't agree.  
---
If I see that a 1v1 is about to happen I'll try to hide next to an exit gate.  
---
As soon as the killer closes the hatch, I'll open the door and leave.   
---
Works for me in 4/5 cases, on red ranks (PC).
---
do you honestly think billys need turning addons? good billys can curve easily without addons like that. and no he doesnt get slowed down enough.
---
Magic
---
swf with my red survivor friend
---
still like "wtf how is survivor fun"
---
8 seconds i think is way too short, you would have to combo it with PGTW for it to make somewhat of an impact, i liked the idea though
---
Got this game like 3 hours ago. First match got put up against 15-14-13-10. Those may not be very good ranks, but as a rank 20 i was traumatized D:
---
Bullshit.
---
It honestly, at least imo, is way more fun than killer once you know what you're doing. The issue with going with someone whose rank is way different than yours is it takes the highest level, so it can basically lead to a rank 20 and rank 5 going against rank 5 killers, which is just gonna be death.
---
Some cool stuff, though I think the killer power is sort of odd, in the sense that a lot of what it does don't exactly work in tandem with one another, and the power itself is VERY similar to that of the Clown, where he has to charge up his bottles and then uses them to hinder survivor movement, along with add-ons that apply effects like blindness, that's another one you have on there. However, one thing that caught my eye was the "oil slick" effect caused to survivors that are *running.* The reason this caught my eye is two-fold: It's unique, and it's funny. I think trying to make the slippery element to large amounts of oil the true focus of the ability would give you a much more interesting tool set to play with. Also, a 10 second long charge that can't be canceled? Brutal, dude.
---
The perks I liked, some tight stuff across the board, though I do have to point out that **Rusty Metal** is pretty much **Iron Maiden** (minus the Exposed), **Surveillance**, and your ability to just kinda *look* at and hear the exit gate switches all in the same perk. Now, the limited range does make it a notably different perk, and it wouldn't be the first time similar perks have been made (**Brutal Strength** and **Fire Up** for example) but it's worth bringing up.
---
**Eye for an Eye** is and interesting one, the risk/reward is a neat aspect, but I think one thing that would really make it a truer risk is actually revealing the aura of the survivor for like 5 seconds after they break the totem. It's a small change but it could sometimes be enough to give the killer the information they need to punish that naughty behavior. I would also specify whether it's the *first* totem you touch that triggers the effect, or if the effect is triggered by pressing the active ability button after working on the totem for those 3/2/1 seconds.
---
this one has taken me the longest so far, but I‚Äôm proud of the result. My hands and back are aching, i couldn‚Äôt be happier that it‚Äôs finally finished. Hope you guys like it!
---
Did they REALLY think I was gonna spend shards on FREE survivor perks
---
It‚Äôs 24 seconds to heal with botany sc and no thana/sloppy. With thana/sloppy I don‚Äôt know the time off the top of my head but it definitely is noticeably not as long to heal with botany. 
---
So, 30 seconds going into the basement ontop of the time it takes to heal yourself? Not even counting the risk of going into the basement injured, how would that be better?
---
I agree you don‚Äôt need to heal constantly, neither perk setups are exactly optimal but pharmacy/botany is a lot more nich√© and situational than botany/sc.
---
Be proud knowing this meme is your life‚Äôs crowning achievement. Its all downhill from here
---
Nice
---
agreed
---
Thanks chief
---
I bet you‚Äôre the type that laughs hysterically when the killer dc‚Äôs
---
Really? That's insane how is it so low on switch but not on xbox or pc
---
I don't know what I think about the idea, personally.  That said, the generator would be in regress from being kicked and unable to be tapped.  Paired with Pop Goes the Weasel and you really screw the survivors.
---
I got 4 red ranks when I was rank 9 on the game with billy and killed 2 ppl but apparently it I got them just because I have sf and e even tho I didn't got to use it and I'm trush.
---
"I'm not crying, you're crying"
---
*cries*
---
‡≤•_‡≤•
---
Then that one was an idiot. Every real Huntress player knows the hit-boxes in this game are wonky and have experienced this often.
---
I see Harry Potter reference, I upvote
---
What? The perk only has a reward when you run it with another perk?
---
Are you retarded?
---
Repairing gens is the survivors job? If you get mad cuz you get gen rushed AND refuse to use ruin you're going to have a bad time unless you're   playing someone with great map pressure like billy. Playing killer atm is slowing the game down as long as possible. Ruin, thana, sloppy butcher, pop goes the weasel etc. If you wanna do fun build do it and just have fun even if you only get 1K if you wanna win you gotta play the meta perks and tunnel/camp. Who cares it's your job to kill survivors and how you do it is your business. Greetings a survivor main.
---
With your last question it's who you prefer so try both! Also ps4 can be quite toxic at times so don't get too upset if someone teabags you.
---
Fuck u m8
---
Ok so
---
1) The more DLC you have, the better (since you can get the dlc perks)
---
2) Playerbase on ps4 is ok, with about 5 minutes of reddit scrolling to find a survivor match, however from what I have heard, killer times are longer
---
3) Solo survivor is stressful at low ranks, but can occasionally be a godsend at higher ranks
---
4)Play both. See what side you prefer and learn what you don't like happening to you, this way you can prevent yourself becoming toxic
---
Don't do that
---
TEIR 4 UNLOCKED
---
Ez!
---
Have you ever cleansed hunted grounds and you get exposed? Such a surprise
---
But all those survivors are riddled with the pestilence, we need the cure!
---
You say entitled survivors but you seem like a entitled killer honestly even admitting you only play one side play both sides and learn from both of them
---
Most of the pallets are safe, there are infinites with BL and gen placement is bullshit.
---
When playing PTB I realized why SBMM that WORKS is really good...I 4ked without 1 gen being done and had to let them all strangle out just so I could down them all again...and I know Oni isnt that OP...
---
no i did :)
---
I agree yeah, just some general buffs around the base bottle mechanic would definitely help him out, however the idea of Clown snapping his fingers theatrically and suddenly weird dissonant circus music starts playing while the generators ooze gas is really fun to me. Adjustments I would make to tone it down would be:
---
A) Don't make gas *prevent* survivor actions, that's just mean. I could understand momentarily interrupting them as they scream and maybe also causing a small speed decrease, but not a full stop, that's needlessly mean. 
---
B) Don't make it so affecting survivors lowers the cooldown, that's weird, one idiot/asshole/troll could just run in and out of the clouds constantly to basically single-handedly reset the cooldown which... just doesn't even feel like a mechanic if I'm being honest, it just feels like it was added to be added.
---
C) Don't include tattooed middle finger, that's so unnecessarily brutal.
---
Que times now: it's been 84 years
---
Que times after this change: 2000 years later
---
Definitely watch some gameplay on the characters that are included in the nightmare edition and see if you‚Äôd be interested in them, but I‚Äôd say go for that since you‚Äôd be saving money altogether. I‚Äôm on Xbox so I can‚Äôt speak on the playerbase for ps4 but there‚Äôs a ton of people who play on Xbox so I assume it‚Äôs nearly the same for ps4. Some will say that it sucks to solo as survivor, with swf you obviously have the advantage of being able to communicate with your friends, but I mostly go solo as survivor and most of my games are great, sometimes you‚Äôll get shit teammates who can‚Äôt carry themselves and don‚Äôt do objectives and crouch in a corner because they‚Äôre too immersed. As for playing killer or survivor, 100% do both. I only played survivor for months, when I decided to try killer it was like a whole new world for me. Although I still prefer survivor, it overall improved my ability to play survivor since I could really put myself in the shoes of the killer.
---
Thank you for clarifying I wasn‚Äôt sure why but usually I do about 1 gen per game so
---
Fair enough
---
How would a group with 3 SWF be matched then?
---
Dead by Daylight runs at 30fps on Switch. Most games run at 60 without issue.

it just depends on location so for all we know it could be even worse for switch in your aera or better depending
---
*laughs as I can run faster than scratched mirror Myers for 2 minutes*
---
In patch notes I think there adding it
---
At least I'm not the only weird one
---
Yes it truly is a mistake when you don't bring ruin and have a gen pop by the time you move from spawn point to other side of map...
---
It does counter it. But the icon in the bottom right corner still flicks on and off when you look at the killer. So it's basically a reversed spine chill then. The killer can still see you though.

as long as you are exusted you do take stun time when falling. although they made it so when not exusted you do not make any sound falling and still get the speed bost

Hmmm...a red dragon is more likely to eat you once it hits it's juvenile age bracket then to be subservient or even allied with a human, this is the problem with all chromatic dragons.
---
Best to stick to Metallic dragons unless you plan on a life of evil, worthy of a chromatic dragon's time.

oh man...

Every time I play deceit there's always matches with noobs and veterans. Seems like its doing fine.
---
There were 3 diffent qualities of map offerings. 33%(brown),66%(yellow) and 100%(green).
---
please dont harrass them its not nice
---
Demogorgang for life bro!!! Good work!
---
I'm sorry what did you say?!
---
Exactly as it should be. Fuck that addon.
---
Except the killer won't slug because he knows you have no mither
---
They also include rank 20 nurses. I'm mid ranks and when I play nurse it's either a 4k or a 0k, not much give. I think in my first 10 games with her I might've gotten like 2-3 kills with her.
---
Prayer beads already ruins the experience for 4 survivors. What kind of game is it where you literally have zero indication (audio, visual, or otherwise) of the killer coming for you?
---
a HUGE amount of players. I've been told off for cleansing in post game chat.
---
Flashlight is easyer to do while killer breaks a pallet just initiate a chase and throw few pallets down...
---
Imagine being on the opposite end of this like ‚Äúplease entity I‚Äôm a rank 14 don‚Äôt put me with 3 P3 rank 11-8 Neas with 1 emergency medkit, 1 flashlight, and 1 engineers toolbox with brand new part.‚Äù Hahaaa...imagine...üò¢
---
More time is wasted since locker animation takes much longer
---
They launched into the grave primarily because of their own shitty descision making. Sure, taking an extra year is good. But what kind of insanity possessed them to take an exclusivity deal with *discord shop*?!?! Thats such a non entity that selling them the exclusivity didnt even create as much as a whimper, in the middle of the pc exclusivity discussion epic started. I hope Discord payed them a massive fee for those rights. But i doubt it.
---
You're playing the game wrong, mate :)
---
What does this perk do?
---
I LOVE a good killer, just hate getting grieved on hook because they didn‚Äôt like that I tried to survive :(
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, I got headed on as well‚Äù
---
Gen rushing isn't real. Rushing would mean doing the Gens a lot faster than normal. If no one is using a toolbox or perks like prove thyself then you can't really do them faster. I'm only saying that since a ton of people accused me/random people I played with of genrushing with literally no perks or items. Even one toolbox isn't gonna change much.
---
The hatch is stupid and should be removed/changed. NOED is stupid and should be removed/changed. Keys and moris are fine to use since they are rare. I think they should both be more rare, since you just gotta spend 1mil blood points and get 10 keys or moris and that's too much imo.
---
That people only say gg when they didn't lose goes both ways. I don't say it anymore to anyone since you usually get nothing back so why waste my time.
---
Gens should get a slight change. Make them take 10-15 seconds longer and I think that would be fine.
---
Farm maps got a rework. Not a huge one though. But maps in general should be reworked. So maps like the treatment theatre or the underground complex would get more balance aswell.
---
Not gonna talk about adrenaline or dstrike cause I'm sick of it.
---
If you want to succeed on high ranks in most rounds you'll have to run the meta. Same goes for survivors. Using non-meta perms will put you at a great disadvantage. And that's just how competitive games work. There is a meta in cod or csgo or lol. It's normal.
---
People in this community are assholes. A lot of them. Its also not just a survivor-thing. This community is toxic and it sucks. But youre not gonna change anything with this post.
---
Feel free to disagree but that's what I think about what you said. Have a great day.
---
Do they really care if he drifts away? Look at what happened with most of the killers.
---
I got EVERY bit of DLC for it on Xbox and even the pops, then I went and died, shame. I miss it too

You're an idiot
---
Her back story is pretty weak, it doesn‚Äôt really says much about her personality but just her achievements. Maybe it‚Äôs just not for me, but I like the ‚Äúsocial outcasts‚Äù type of character more, which is most of DBD‚Äôs characters
---
All the followers, sponsors, winning streaks, women empowerment, she‚Äôs feels a bit too successful for the survivor loser squad.
---
Swf is a joke..voice chat isn‚Äôt fair

What if it's Baby Driver? That'd be something else...
---
Spending 500 k almost everyday and get back to million the same day. I play to much lol
---
As my first foray into DBD, the switch version has still been plenty fun! My main qualms are long lobby times (which everyone seems to complain about anyway) and the occasional slow down. Do note that playing docked and handheld does affect the response timing (I usually tap skillcheck a little earlier docked cause of input lag). 
---
If you find the frame rate slowing down, exit and shut the game down before going back in. Seems to smoothen it out.
---
1. None of the DLC characters were available at launch.
---
2. Literally no difference from Rainbow Six Siege.
---
&lt;3 . good job!
---
DC wont change anything , ill just suicide on the hook instead , at least you have your bbq stack i guess
---
When is BHVR finally gonna roll out these changes that are supposedly going to make solo survivors as well informed as SWF survivors?
---
Get gud baby killer
---
Honestly. I remember an event where they were giving out gold monster skins and when I got them I was so happy. It was such a fun game with great maps and environments. Monsters were very unique and controls were so fluid and fun to play I kept coming back.
---
I'd personally say that as survivor this works way better than as killer.  
---
If you don't go full immersion mode you'd only need 1 exhaustion perk for safety.  
---
Or atleast it won't harm you / do you great.  
---
But besides that you basically don't need perks or items to perform well as survivor.  
---
Killer on the other side ... Well.  
---
I don't want this to be a: Killer This - Survivor That! - response.  
---
But if you don't run a game-slow-down perk (Ruin, Corrupt Intervention) perk as trapper and don't equip a bag - you're most likely in for a hard time on red ranks - because the game might be over within 4 minutes if you don't do super well / survivors dont fuck up big time.
---
Maybe you should stay away from rank 20 , its literaly the worst Killer
---
I am sure. you are definitely more suited in red ranks. that's what it's for
---
So far the only two games that have even attempted to make that convo are Friday the 13th (which is a completely different playstyle and is much more hide-and-seek oriented; not to mention it's at its best when folks are roleplaying) and Last Year (which I'd say is more like Left 4 Dead 2's VS mode with a single player trying to stop the others).  
---
Friday the 13th had an unfortunate freeze due to the lawsuit around the rights for the series.  Last Year had like... a burst of initial hype when all of the DBD streamers checked it out, but then barely anyone picked it up or remembered its existence since Discord bought a one-year exclusivity deal for it and Discord's attempts to be a storefront were even worse than Twitch's.  
---
That said, looking forward to Last Year coming to Steam.  Seems like it'll be fun.  But it's much more akin to Left 4 Dead 2's VS mode than being anything like DBD.
---
All it needs now is a " x 30 " because that's how many times I do it per match. Spot on.
---
3 players against a killer with a multi-hit one-shot have bad situational awareness and stand still in the open=OP killer?
---
Totems shouldn't spawn next to gens.  
---
Fight me.
---
I'd say there's more of a meta for Killers than survivors because of that for sure. I also think Killers require more perk building around their power too. and I guess we aren't in a total meta-less state because of the occasional hardstruck SWF who use those combos too, but for more than most of my solo Q games I can vouche for diversity.
---
Unpopular opinion: Playing powerful killers isn't helping you shit when you don't know what to do with them.
---
Nurse and spirit are so powerful because they're fairly hard. Nurse blinking is something you have to practice a lot. Spirit heavily relies on mindgaming, also, it takes a good amount of practice to know where survivors are while you're haunting (not as hard as blinking tho).
---
Dunno about freddy I didn't play him since his rework besides once.
---
'ok, survivor main'
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;#Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;#We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;# If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
 
---
&gt;# If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019
---
](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
If I'm the killer and this happened, I'll hook the chased person a bit further from the totem, and purposefully let them get saved then immediately go to the ruin spot. Lo &amp; behold, injured survivor on totem.
---
Yea I agree.  
---
When I play survivor, I like to equip not often used perks like Stake Out, Wake Up and similiar stuff.  
---
I still know how to loop, where the totem spawns are etc.  
---
But when I play killer (Which I prefer) I have to build arround certain killers.  
---
I can't just put Distressing on Plague/Hag, cut Ruin (or CI), add Mindbreaker, Third Seal and Lightborn and say: "This is going to be enjoyable!"
---
OMG feng is so cute. and poor quintin lol
---
I main trapper, and i hate having to run ruin all the time. Ruin's effects should be applied permanently, killersnshouldnt have to waste a perk slot on a nessecity for winning when surv don't.
---
Currently, I would say Sprint Burst, Balanced Landing and Lithe are tied for equally-viable Exhaustion perks with their own distinct benefits, and can be used on a personal-preference/playstyle basis, or in dependence on your other perks. Balanced Landing can even effectively be used alongside any of the other Exhaustion perks. Dead Hard is susceptible to lag and therefore too unreliable on the current dedicated server architecture. It's still good because it can still reliably be used for distance, but I wouldn't say it's worth using over the other Exhaustion perks (unless you are in a very low-latency region, like Korea).
---
Balanced Landing will be nerfed and then pretty much directly worse than the other Exhaustion perks. The dedicated server architecture might change, or at least how Dead Hard functions might be changed somehow to accomodate for that architecture. Sprint Burst is the overall best Exhaustion perk, being the most reliable and versatile, but the others are more reliably valuable specifically in chases. If Dead Hard will actually function reliably at some point, it will be the best chase perk, with Lithe a close second. Lithe can also be used to lose the killer and end chases, especially in combination with other perks, an extra utility Dead Hard doesn't have - apart from very rare scenarios like using DH to get to a hook or into position for a flashlight/pallet save just in the nick of time, it pretty much only serves the purpose of prolonging chases. Balanced Landing will be a flavour pick at best.
---
Head On kinda deserves to be mentioned, especially since it actually improved with dedicated servers, but it is more gimmicky and unreliable than all of the other Exhaustion perks, and basically needs to be run alongside Quick &amp; Quiet to have real in-chase utility.
---
Karma for looping you? So you think he got karma for playing the game the way survivors are supposed to and avoid getting downed by the killer? Lmao
---
Yall mind if i uhh... LONG
---
&gt; He was pretty cocky that entire match because he was good a looping me
---
He was being cocky because he was good at what a survivor is supposed to do.
---
Calm down child lol
---
I have watched this clip more then 15 times and I still don‚Äôt see the problem. She looks at you, throws the hatchet then looks at the meg
---
4pm GMT I believe
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what he said lmao
---
6h 37m from now
---
No, no, I would say it's "New member to the band"
---
ü§î
---
bless you
---
You the one thats butthurt whining like a lil bitch lol
---
It does seem like WGLF and BBQ &amp; Chili are basically equivalent perks, so it would make sense for WGLF to have an added effect if BBQ &amp; Chili is able to have both BP gains *and* an extra beneficial effect (aura reading) just from doing a basic expected function of the game. 
---
There are so many other perks that have effects that would be great when paired with WGLF so it‚Äôs hard not to be redundant or OP. I feel like WGLF should either allow the killer‚Äôs aura to be revealed or perhaps hide the unhooking notification and/or scratch marks for a certain period of time. Or it could allow the other survivors to see the unhooked survivor‚Äôs aura for a certain period of time so that they can be healed. Just anything to help the survivability of the unhooked survivor. 
---
BBQ &amp; Chili is a pretty strong perk, it seems reasonable for WGLF to be equally as strong.
---
Or you're getting two stacks for one save if the Killer is being a bit of a dick.
---
He meant he was getting cocky because he was good at looping. Not saying karma for looping, karma for being cocky and most likely a bit todic
---
Oof
---
How am I butthurt? For correcting someone on what they think karma is? Go back to your shit killers/survivors on the ps4 lmfao
---
Or they get two if the Killer hits them instead of the rescued survivor.
---
Ah yes, people tapping crouch against Killers, so deserving of sympathy and pity being such an oppressed minority. Poor souls, how can people treat our brave Killer Mains like this?
---
What game is that? I've  never heard about it
---
Most nintendo games*
---
Exactly lil crybaby bitch keep whining loser lol
---
To anybody that gets tilted, its a meme of a game so chill pls
---
Not many play Bubba wich is the reason why most survivors don't know how to play against him.
---
"Toxic TRYHARDS" imagine trying to play a game well
---
The fact that the MHW devs decided to implement Layered Armor versions of normal armors you unlock through gameplay and grind, due to popular demand, tells a lot. 
---
Heck, its nice to play a game where you're not greeted with BUY THIS SKIN NOW and other monetization. DbD's only missing lootboxes and true pay-2-win to be truly up there.
---
I would be fine with that though. It would become a situational aura reading perk, I would probably still run it on killers like Demo or Freddy and that is fine. Maybe it could get a very small buff as a compensation, but I would be happy to finally make way for other perks. It sucks to basically have 2 slots of your loadout decided before the start of the game because you need BBQ (if you aren't a player with hundreds of hours already) and you also need Ruin or Corrupt.
---
Dedicated Servers has been messing up grabs for everyone (on PC at least). You‚Äôre not alone
---
Up until she stabs you with a ruler.
---
Must be a p3 Claudette, because I didn't even see her there.
---
It is so much better. Priming a totem can happen anytime in the game, helps your team, and you completely bypass every healing slowdown perk as well as aura perks like Nurse's Calling or BBQ. Just hop into a locker after a chase, 8 seconds,done. And if the killer finds you in a locker he eats a D-Strike. 
---
Self-Care is so bad nowadays. Many people just don't have Stranger Things and those perks have not been in the Shrine yet.
---
This was actually 50000d chess by the huntress. She actually flung is straight up at the other end of the map, and then realized you weren‚Äôt in the right spot, so she ran to the house, went up the stairs and threw herself off it, knowing you‚Äôd move exactly how you did in the video to get hit. Fear that goddes huntress right there. Fear her forever more.
---
have you ever played against a curving billy?
---
That legit made me fucking jump.
---
H A R D E R D A D D Y
---
How do people come up with this shit lmao. Great meme
---
Myers has the best designed kit of any killer, change my mind.
---
Sounds like something a SYNTH would say
---
Take off self care for a while, i used to think the same. 
---
Its a dog shit perk, it waste way 2 much time. its not the worst perk but god is there so many better options.
---
#KAG2020
---
Nominating Death Garden real quick, the poor game needs some love.
---
Wraith and Leatherface both need reworks, to be honest. Pig, not really- I think she needs big changes, but not a rework.
---
God I hate claudette's that just hide the entire gqme and camp one of the exits waiting for you to close the hatch. Then you find them there teabagging as if you got beat by them in 4D chess. Disgusting.
---
Smol question for you folks: how would you feel about a detailed list of overused jokes as part of Rule 8 - Oversaturated Content? This would include jokes like "When you cleanse a hex totem thinking it's Ruin but it's actually Haunted Grounds", "Nea is the killer", "DAE think Quentin's face is ugly???", "Guys only want one thing and it's disgusting [insert Shirtless Myers]" etc. 
---
Just asking, pls no hard feelings.
---
This is cool asf, good job ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏èüëåüëåüëåüëå
---
Yeah let's make the lobby times even longer or even infinite if you're doing swf with 3 people
---
who cares. killer lobbys are instant and you didnt bring any good offerings or addons then you literally lost nothing other then a single pip (which is dumb, but its a single pip.) 
---
The survivors already got punished by having to wait 10-20 mins of waiting in a lobby just to play dumb and wait another 10-20 mins to do it again. 
---
DC punishment will literally do nothing but make everything worse, toxic survivors can just kill themselves on hook, and toxic killers can just slug you to death when you are last alive bc they know you cant DC.
---
I didn't say anything about Pig but alright.
---
Also survivors when their entire team died and their useless ass just camped the exit gate to be able to escape.
---
No, just after getting unhooked that is what I meant. But if you escape after unhooking with Inner Strength primed and jump into a locker, killer only has 2 choices: either he grabs you and eats a D-Strike or he gives you the heal.
---
How did you get that? All I see is "hew mewber to the heud"
---
I was thinking it meant "New member to the band" or "New member to the head"
---
Yeah i only just recently started watching him as montos vids are just the same shit
---
Why do i do this
---
I... I love this.
---
Supposedly "wholesome" memes/comics about killers being nice to baby survivors and vice versa is getting old too.
---
:)
---
&gt;The sluggening
---
What about it?
---
Ds is a shit perk rn. You have only 40-60seconds to use it. Also you need to wiggle to use it when 1.4patch comes out. Only tunnel campers got to taste ds.
---
You seem like the type of person that would cry if a killer tunnelled you
---
You named 2 and dead hard is hardly op, Any killer with a brain can hard counter dead hard and half the time lag makes dead hard useless, And you want me to talk about survivor nerfs? lmao. They have nerfed DS multiple times, Self-care, Sprint burst, Balanced landing, flashlights, Medkits, sabotaging, removed pallets from maps multiple times, Removed vacuum pallets, Made it a lot harder to get fast vaults on windows, Changed layouts of map tiles so they no longer had a safe pallet or put the window in a spot where it's basically impossible to fast vault in a chase, Nerfed WGLF which was literally only for getting bloodpoints ( look at bbq &amp; chilli, tier 1 perk WITH bonus bloodpoints, Yet not nerfed), Nerfed leader, Empathy, Nerfed survivors movement. So hows that for nerfs buddy. There's probably more I can't remember off the top of my head as well.
---
Remarkably pathetic and cringeworthy post.
---
well here is the issue. i dont think anyone has figured out a way to make him more fair without gutting him. he starts off so bad but when he gets his power he has SOOOO much.
---
EX: His pallet break speed, his loop potential, his pure speed, his lunge, his AOE, his tracking.
---
I think his biggest issue (and one of the issues with spirit) is that he doesnt get punished for mistakes, the devs seemed to just stop adding cooldowns to killers recently and its kinda scary.
---
even when you do punish him its only for 3-4 secs max then he is on your ass again, compared to when he punishes you which is insta death.
---
I fake a lot of lunges and it really helps, I know this technique \^\_\^ I have to admit tho that I have no idea how to effectively use his portals. Also his chases feel really really slow and pounces are useless on like half of loops(like Badham).
---
at first i was like "well ig she is thirsty, not sure why you would want to pick up wat-... oh"

Freddy's snares are better for chases than Clown's bottles because he doesn't slow down after dropping them. Clown does slow down after throwing a bottle for some reason. The only disadvantage snares have compared to bottles is that you need survivors to be asleep.
---
You hate to make a lot of gens before you can even use hatch, so no.
---
HE'S TOO DANGEROUS TO BE KEPT ALIVE
---
Spies from the Shadow's new rework lookin kinda scary
---
Yeah it really irks me when someone DC‚Äôs after being down their first time. Like.. one of us WILL save you from the hook! Don‚Äôt worry!
---
I like to keep these as pieces of the past. I'll use one every now and then but I will always keep one on my character
---
Dunno what kind of guessing games you play, but I usually mindgame and they work out perfectly fine.
---
Also, she's hard. Scratchmarks are not reliable when it comes to tracking survivors on the spot, you also have to pay attention to grass and sound, and sometimes you also have to predict where a survivor will probably run by checking the surroundings and identifying possible escape routes, all while not seeing the survivor. That makes it significantly harder than chasing with most other characters. To be honest, I think that spirits power is, after blink and billys chainsaw, the hardest to use in the game.
---
You can turn it however you want. Spirit is not a hard character when it comes to mechanics, but quite hard because you have to think in a bigger picture.
---
I feel like there has to be a tier below shitpost for those if they're going to be continued to be allowed. I want to filter those out but some shitposts are actually funny on this sub.

Dbd memes + prequel memes = N O I C E

They're probably teabagging whilst looking all over the place just to get your attention.

Good luck going against the drooling "all you need are good headphones LOL" circlejerk.
---
&gt;Because you got caught that means you should fuck your teammates over for the rest of the game?
---
I'm sorry to tell you but this won't change once DC penalties take place, they will just suicide on hook. If people don't want to play the match for whatever reason, they won't.
---
As all things should be.
---
i just want ruin and bbq ffs

I neeeeeeeed

Punishment for playing spirit tbh

Cute! I like your style :)

No you.

they wouldn't

Ah right, got it. Thanks!

It literally gives them a loud af global soundcue

I know, but if I try hard enough...

it might?

I'm a Nancy main but I never used Inner Strength but I was thinking about it. My build is DS, BL, Spine Chill and Detective Hunch or BT depending how I feel. I'm a killer main so any advise would be welcome

Ah level 1 discordance. A man of culture you are

I don‚Äôt see how a horror game like this can be permanently scary. It definitely is during first hours, but then you get used to the atmosphere.

Yeah, this whole NEVER NEVER EVER CLEANSE thing that the subreddit has is just bad advice. 1) There are plenty of times when cleansing is the right play, 2) not every killer player is a god tier player.

What are you even talking about? I am agreeing with the statistics. It is you who are denying their accuracy

I‚Äôm all for it; I don‚Äôt get much time to peruse, but when I do, it‚Äôs typically the same recycled thing over and over. It‚Äôd be nice to see some variety.
---
Just stop lol
---
It's tapered off. That's what happens when a meme becomes relevant though. Nothing to be upset over.
---
Ruin needs a buff or a rework. Its a gamble perk, its either There for the whole game or gone within 20 seconds. If you cant push ruin then learn to hit skillchecks, bring prove thyself, BNP toolboxes etc.
---
He was probably staying to get a flashlight save
---
Hiding in lockers still counter BBQ, but iron maiden counters the counter

Why is the second m in member written upside-down
---
Europe - evening around 5 mins for survivors, 7 for killers, night is always different but generally less than on evenings
---
ah okay. I was thinking no wonder killers be finding me in lockers lately, but it‚Äôs just me being trash at the game.
---
[Please?](https://youtu.be/DdCYMvaUcrA)
---
Considering they were both made by u/Dalbergg I'd say the odds are fairly high.
---
Perfect response, if you feel like chatting we can chat on discord or just reddit, but I'm interedted in how and why you do this stuff, you clesrly think its so much fun, and everyone loves what you love to do, im curious to things like do you ever struggle to come up with a comic thats worth drawing? Or is it more time that you need to work with.
---
Im just enjoying talking about this is all.
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking; probably didn‚Äôt pay attention to the EGC timer either.
---
I mean have you seen the killer stats, game seems pretty balanced atm
---
Did you just assume their gender?
---
No one mentioned this, blood pools are separate from blood orbs. Not relevant
---
Inaccurate, all 4 people disconnect when you have iredescent head
---
I got accused of hacking yesterday because a fucking swf in purple ranks didn't know that wraith when not moving is completely invisible.
---
Will i see auras if somebody has this perk and i not one who is hooked?
---
Cringy overused meme.
---
Player base is fairly decent but depends on region. You can play solo but if you want to play survivor I'd reccommend finding people to play with, killer is exclusively solo so ypu might have more fun with that. Only down side is that killer queue times tend to be a lot longer than survivor. I'd say buy the Nightmare edition because the DLC is pretty good for the most part although you can buy some killers and survivors with in game currency but it takes a while.
---
It stops being funny though when you see the same joke over and over again
---
Exact same joke? Yeah, but same subject matter is fine for a while
---
I wanted the rank 1 achivement and Crush SWF
---
It procs more often so you know people are committing to the generator
---
Technically the best killer in the game stats wise
---
Looks like RABtoons lol
---
Forever Freddy like that idea.
---
Damn dude that looks like a good game
---
But... I already own all these perks and 2 of those are free to use
---
For the teabagging to become somewhat friendlier, it would require for it to lose its negative connotation, which it won‚Äôt anytime soon. 
---
If you want to use it in another manner, don‚Äôt blame it on your opponent for not getting it. There‚Äôs only so much you can do to communicate in DBD and people will just assume that you‚Äôre being a dick.

---
At level 3 when two or more survivors touch a generator, it will remain lit for 12s even if they immediately let go.
---
At level 1 it will turn off after 8s if they aren't still repairing it.
---
yup, 60 seconds of untouchability
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
He deserves it.
---
The Switch is great, the problem lies with DbD being horribly optimized
---
Huntress started raising her hatchets and falling at the same time, which confused the game and made it use a wrong animation
---
Effectively, yes
---
It is only with the challenges I realised just how satisfying the trapper is to play. I mean I like deviousness, and use the hag a lot. But triggering traps is one thing, hearing that delicious snap sound from across the map is a whole different experience.
---
Plus the range of add-ons the trapper has gives you a wide variety of utility for trying different things.
---
Holy shit I love these so fucking much
---
Damn this is EPIC idea . . .
---
I lowkey forgot shark tale existed before seeing this
---
An adult or ancient red dragon can make for an interesting warlock patron, though. You'd probably have to sacrifice a small village to keep it from eating you, but hey, eldritch blast is pretty cool.
---
Myers is the most fun killer. 
---
 Leather face if u wanna grind BP.
---
Spirir if you wanna climb to red ranks
---
Just loop him 4head
---
And then they run to cleanse again after being sick for 0.5 seconds
---
I don't know, I had a quick browse and it was extremely cringey. I can see why the other person above thought it was tragic, lol. I saw a few screenshots of endgame chats and it had the classic "I'm taking screenshots to put on reddit" and I died a little inside.
---
Yo Holy shit, can we???
---
Just loop him 4 head
---
They're just sitting on the edge anyway, if you down them they'll still escape
---
Fucking same, they're totally my thing, idk what it is about them, they're just so like, majestic
---
you're probably the guy from console, I'm sorry but this is not meant for console, I have no idea how it's like there
---
if you're from pc tho, what region do you play? how long does it takes? what rank? normally it doesn't take much for me to find games
---
You can't tell what it is tho :0
---
I was waiting for that, thankfully didn't happen.
---
And people also seem to forget that corrupt purge can be disabled by stunning her, which is easy with pallets and Head on.
---
... Hopefully :(
---
awww this is so sweet
---
You can just pm me if you want to! \^\^  
---
Currently I'm pretty much out of ideas for comics, no interesting things have been happening in my games lately. Maybe I'll expand to things I see on twitch rather than just my own experiences.  
---
Luckily people have asked me to draw character portraits, so now I'm working on that!
---
But he didn't boop the snoot :(
---
I know, that‚Äôs why i said technically. But he is undeniably in a much better position than he was before the rework. Better than most killers imo
---
Almost perfect meme, Should have been "Perfect heal A state"
---
Bad idea. It's different from person to person on what they could consider 'oversaturated', and you'd need a way to decide on a case by case what was and was not. A lot of people get tired of memes that spring up after a week, and would probably start trying to flag shit for that rule the moment they started disliking certain jokes.
---
Looks like a color blind mode
---
&gt; and encourages doing totems
---
Well, it encourages doing totem (singular); afterwards, until you need it again, it encourages leaving totems up to use for later, sadly.
---
Me neither. It's probably why nobody is salty.
---
Friendly game chat and decent matchmaking. Wow. I'm honestly impressed.
---
"just leave" rings very true
---
Its where he doesnt use the stalk he just uses the no terror radius mode to injure everybody and catch them by surprise. Somebody actually donated him that build and now he claims as his own.
---
id imagine he was waiting for demo to grab jane so he could pick up meg
---
Nope all you need is to have the park equipped..
---
*The Entity already knows, dumbass* /s
---
The counter is to never cleanse and do the gen instead. Hence reinforcing the "no heal / do gen" meta.
---
He's got the sprit
---
Switch doesnt get the Nightmare edition??
---
i have a feeling you're fuckin with me. lol  
---
but thank you
---
Im just hungry for upvotes ;)
---
Would ya look who it is. Does it count if I upvote this post?
---
&gt;Dumbass survivors happened
---
Not necessarily, slugging is considered a strong play style for a reason.
---
Do we know the hour?
---
I AM from PC and from Europe,  rank 1 both killer and survivor(only solo).  Killer ques are fast (2 minutes or less),  survivor take ages (6-12 minutes)
---
you never know on here. and hey, im a smart ass lol. but i was jk. i just had 2, cunt hair and the gates open, hatch next to gate, figured either way ok i leave fine, get the skill check if i find a chest..better..nope, got murkd lol.
---
I wouldn't get rid of all of them. I'd leave it as "if interesting enough, might stay"
---
Some do find good ways to twist those
---
thanks again
---
thank you. appreciate it.
---
I feel like you‚Äôre being ignorant?

You,sir, are amazing

Corrupt purge with infectious fright is a nightmare for the survivors
---
UOH, UUOOOH, OOOOMMMYYYYGGOOOOOOOOOODDD, BABY IS TRIPLE, UOOOOOSMOSMOMOMOMOKE WEEED EVERYDAY SMOKE WEED EVERYDAY *air horn noises
---
Hag mains be like
---
Iron maiden + iridescent hatchet heads + deer skin gloves (pretty sure these give faster locker search speed) =one in the chamber
---
Spoiler alert, you're a big part of garbage in this community with post like this.
---
As other people say, play both roles and open your eyes. But most importantly, play for fun. Nobody cares if you get 4k or 0k. It's not a competitive game.
---
If I know survivors are waiting at gates I get up and make a drink while leaving myself in the middle of the map. 
---
They can waste as much their own ntime as they like.
---
I played nurse for like the 3rd time yesterday and I don‚Äôt know if survivors were trying to bully or help me but I ended up with a 4K and learnt a lot regardless so maybe thank you survivors? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
3h 44 from my comment I believe
---
It should help you WiGgLe ofF the killer's back.
---
This just buffs Pop Goes The Weasel even more
---
Do we know? They didn't clarify ( one of the multiple problems with these stats) so idk how we could discern this information.
---
It has to be if Behaviour got team working on it to also work on DbD Mobile
---
personnaly I prefer Corrupt Intervention :)
---
Ruin can't stop you if you do great skillchecks
---
Play Laurie with Unbreakable instead of DS. You'll always get slugged anyway
---
Make it not apply to wholesome memes or pretty good job so far please
---
Out of context? They are the context of this discussion after all.
---
There are lots of factors. The long list of survivor nerfs over the past 2 years. Broken hitboxes. Stuttering skillchecks. Even the fact that killers get double bloodpoints through a very strong perk while the survivor version of that is completely useless aside from the bloodpoints. And obviously these " out of context statistics" that show exactly that
---
Being isolated /alone isn't the only factor, but it's a big one. 
---
Meg had to give up her athletic dream to become a full time carer for her mother. That's both physical and mental stress. 
---
Nea was having trouble fitting in and finding her place, the arson attack a way for her to seem cool and edgy.
---
Kate was isolated on a regular schedule whenever she'd go into the woods, giving a perfect opportunity to take her and have it seem natural. 
---
Jane had an intensely stressful career and huge issues with her mother
---
David was isolated in the sense that he wasn't lonely, but was an aggressive, violent person. Also he was another person who's disappearance wasn't noticed. 
---
Adam was in another country, though he had begun to find his place. However, much like Kate, Adams more of a chance of opportunity seeing as in the Wreckage of the train, a missing body wouldn't be too weird.
---
30 fps isn't as bad as you think, I used to have a potato pc, which ran dbd on an average of 20 fps. Never really hindered me (except for when the doc was the killer).

Just checking the comments so see how many people are gonna shit on Self-care

yikes

Well casual matches based on skill so if you think you might be matched against many swfs then play rank it still a better solution then nothing isn‚Äôt it?

Wait, how many shards does a new killer cost? Don‚Äôt they cost like 10k or something?

Run and don‚Äôt come back this is in your best interest

---
ok thanks for sharing
---
This is horrible...people play the game different you know. I agree it's better not to cleanse though. Most people I play with don't cleanse but do at the end and i think that's also a mistake most times
---
Sad truth is they might not have even been neglected.  Just reaching out for more attention.  Such a sad creature.
---
On huntress it's great
---
Not really, i'd much rather verse a 4-man with flashlights than one with toolboxes. Flashlights require people to be in very close proximity to the survivor that got downed, force them to get off objectives to do so, and are very easily countered by baiting the pick-up animation so that they come scurrying out in front of you and you get a free hit, or just facing a wall.
---
If they wanna be annoying and blind you at pallets, they wasted a lot of time they could have used to make distance on you, and you can still hear them and get a general idea of where they are. There are very few instances where a flashlight can achieve something meaningful, and frankly if the survivor does manage to do so, it's the killer's fault. Meanwhile, they can bring toolboxes instead of flashlights and pump out gens like no tomorrow, or keys and just yeet themselves from the trial.
---
?
---
Your entitled to your opinion but your wrong i‚Äôm sorry
---
Playing survive with friends does not automatically make you toxic. I just like playing with my friends.
---
...Not exactly.. The loop part is a problem for every killer, but plague seems like a very good killer, whether survivors cleanse or don't.
---
Don't cleanse - Unlimited Exposed effect, cough like a bitch (2 times louder), big green smoke around you, infect objectives/lockers/pallets/windows when you use them, therefore Plague can constantly know every single one of your moves. Pair everything with Stridor / PWYF / BBQ / any, and you have the unescapable Plague.
---
Cleanse - You get infected right away, most likely because Plague finds you after you cleanse. You have the Unlimited Exposed effect once again, but now, you have to dodge a stream of hatchets flying in your direction.
---
Plague seems like the MVP of all killers on paper, but of course, there are huge variables such as pallet placement / gen placement / windows / maps with infinites etc.
---
Oh I know but the context before that like deranking with friends just to bully killers is toxic.
---
9k
---
The wraith does get true invisibility when he stands still lol
---
And because it‚Äôs the Switch, you can be safe knowing nobody can send her any toxic BS post-game chat.
---
I highly doubt I‚Äôll manage to get 6 or 7k before Oni comes out. I‚Äôm fucking terrible at this game
---
She used ZA WARUDO and stopped time. Fucking Dio
---
It‚Äôs sorted by alphabetical and but the different rarity‚Äôs separately sort them
---
sure it can, but they play dbd just to do that kind of things. The lamest motherfukers
---
Once I got a 4k as myers and 1 nice guy said "gg wp" I was so happy
---
Looks like you t-bag the killer. Better to crouch and look up to the killer. Prefered if you drop your item and have been a good sport all game.
---
Except she basically has full-game NOED, with bonus tracking...
---
Imagine running the flair of Best Girl^TM and declaring yourself a Nancy main.

Ahh I see! I always see comments where people say not to get any higher Tier for it and I never understood why, thank you! :)
---
The problem I'm seeing with that would be constantly updating the list whenever a new meme gets run into the ground.
---
I honestly think we just need a Memes By Daylight sub so we can discuss things here and have free reign on the funnys over there.
---
I feel like I‚Äôve already seen that art
---
If you‚Äôre comfortable looping while injured (which you should be at high ranks) DO NOT CLEANSE until late game. Then her counter is just basic looping
---
so it's sorted by rarity.
---
The default rule of any sorting states, that if you sort by "something" and two things have the same "something" and are named, you sort them alphabetically
---

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e2fmwc/ps4_fps_drops_with_certain_skins/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It helps when you're in a chase and you kick the gen but survivors can just tap the gen to stop it regressing
---
Just chase the killer and try to become chased that way. I did the quest this way and accidentally saved my team twice lol. I dont use flashlights so it took me 4-6 attempts.
---
He‚Äôs got us there
---
I learnt and got the game mostly because of it being promoted in Payday 2
---
Learn how to loop people while being injured? It works the exact same it‚Äôs better than being both injured and having to deal with her machine gun
---
And a Santa cosmetic that be awesome

Love your name lol

u/homieracoon

How so.
---
How do you send anything other than PS stickers via PS4?!
---
Oh my g*d he hot he terrifying,he hot he terrifying I‚Äôm have mix feelings this this is amazing I LOVE THIS
---
Your ancestors smile upon you
---
u see
---
Since this has gone far from the original issue by now I won't answer to a lot of this and get to the point.
---
I think what we are mainly disagreeing on is is how important the number of kills is compared to how the killer got these kills. And also how important the number of kills in comparison to getting a pip or not.
---
And I think that since the killers ultimate objective is to get kills and the survivors ultimate objectiveis to survive that the number of kills is the important measure to look at. And according to these stats they kill more than half the survivors more often than not.
---
Whether the killer facecamped to get his kills or not doesn't matter to him (because else he wouldn't do it) and also doesn't matter to the survivor who got facecamped. It is a strategy often used especially in lower to medium ranks, which is also counting on altruism to get the other survivors to try and make risky plays in a rescue attempt) and as long as the devs don't do something about this it is a valid one.
---
Now whether or not you get a pip of those kills is a different issue and I'm not arguing against changing something about that. I do think that survivors get pips quite easily and that it should be harder for them but a flawed ranking system, on my opinion, is not relevant for determining which side is favoured in the game.
---
Lmao just spray the spider
---
Who hurt you
---
&gt;Except she basically has full-game NOED, with bonus tracking...
---
Which still allows you to loop her for a lot longer than you normally would if she had corrupt.
---
Hope is a is better if you need more time. Adrenaline is a crutch perk that brings you another chance. Both combined is perfection.
---
(Hint: Hope beats noed)
---
You couldn't have googled how to spell iridescent or used spell check?
---
No, the killer with the highest amount of kills on average from data over 1 month. That's a stark difference. On top of that, it's a month where archives make people do stupid plays so the numbers seem a touch pointless.
---
On PS4 I get like 5-10fps
---
It still feels a bit like horror against stealth killers imo. 
---
Atleast moreso then with normal onces.
---
Ikr
---
I run Small Game along with Inner Strength for maximum profit.
---
Cause you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
---
Kanabo
---
or killed lol
---
It‚Äôs not a first person shooter where you need every millisecond on your side. I honestly think if 30fps was locked as the standard from the start people would be fine. It‚Äôs not nearly as nice, but it doesn‚Äôt really hinder the game
---
ngl, dropped my phone when i heard that hit connect, like damn
---
try not getting in front of him all the time
---
u know the word stealth?
---
swf must try it sometime
---
You are so correct
---
Saying yeet when throwing an axe makes it go further
---
EGC all bets are off at that point. Please go cry somewhere else.
---
I am hardly ever SWF but you can‚Äôt be stealthy once Legion hits someone he knows exactly where you are.
---
Playing the game makes you toxic
---
How the fudge did that happen?
---
Fair, to make a point though I always walk away from hook give them distance and a chance in that regard. Usually by the time they are unhooked I'm halfway across the map. If they can't hide by the time I get there. That's on them. I can understand the issue a bit better now tho as I'm sure most tunnelers aren't as nice.
---
thank u all for the kind words for us spirit mains. everyday a spirit main is brutally attacked by a group of Claudettes. dont stand for it anymore
---
‚ÄúJust let the killer win if you don‚Äôt your toxic‚Äù OP
---
That's actually a fact
---
I was leaning forward to get the hit, and my keyboard is on this shelf that rolls out from my desk. I leaned down on that hard, and it acted as a lever to topple the whole thing
---
#BRUH
---
Ghost face dropping on you like Batman!
---
Shes kinda weak
---
I once had a group , upon noticing I had Iron Maiden, just started spamming locker exits all at once. Post-game chat was pretty hostile toward me. To this day I'm not sure if they were just fucking around or actually throwing a fit because of Iron Maiden.
---
That's not what I meant. He asked how you could help. You can still escape though.
---
She's a 115 speed killer... Why is everyone under the impression that she's slower?
---
Except ruin already can be removed as it is a HEX perk you can remove TOTEMS anytime you find them but yeah end game is impossible if you just ignore the fact that it‚Äôs a hex perk because all totem spots are definitely perfectly hidden
---
I mean the eyes look like tbag and the shoes look like size 13 but other than that I love it. The body style is great
---
He commented on her backstory, never mention about her appearances nor perks. Be gone while knight.
---
hey bruh dont worry we gonna live furever oh yea- wait wut dont grab me ohnono*oof*
---
Squished like pancakes
---
I find the easiest way to lock down the hatch without having to slug someone is just take the time to find the hatch. If there's only 2 survivors left you should have enough time for that while pressuring gens.
---
Then just hook a survivor somewhere near the hatch, so you can be right on top of it by the time they die and stomp it shut before anyone can jump in.
---
Babysitter already does it though
---
As a killer when I see a survivor that clearly is playing with friends and he is not so experience, I let him do "plays " hoping he will like the game and have fun
---
no its clearly irri-decent head, small brain trapper main
---
Licensed content always bring new players to the game because of their fanbase of movies.
---
I'm actually very happy were getting an original. The licensed are cool and all, but I love the efforts they've put into their own characters so far
---
No one is butthurt except you my friend. They leave a comment then move on with their lives, you could keep coming back to ‚Äòtroll‚Äô.
---
I would say self care is the single most misused perk in the game. And when it is misused, it really hurts the team, while at the same time feeling like it's incredibly helpful the the individual using it.
---
She's one of the hardest killers in the game but that's because a lot of killers are pick up and play. Like you said, she's big picture, but really the picture is not that big game to game except against some optimal SWFs.
---
Especially if you play both sides, it's just about knowing a survivors option in that moment. And add-ons of course can pick up the slack.
---
I would say she is easy to control but if you have poor decision making in general, Spirit will highlight that fact.
---
A billy with curving addons, yes but he can't be be both
---
That still hinders him from getting a three-man down like that
---
We could get the shotgun Collar and give them blindness ? All I know is that I want the shotgun collar in the game
---
You can‚Äôt win in those situations
---
I have no idea why Meg didn‚Äôt turn so she could actually bolt for escape instead of the long death turn. If Adam has protected I think they all could‚Äôve won. Once I got a 4K by the EGC tho bc timer was broken
---
That's literally what the current ranking system is meant to do (in theory)
---
I love the switch version of DBD, the only thing that sucks is that you can't get the freddy or leather face chapters :(
---
I like the archives, but some of these are really hard,  can we please not unlock them 1 at a time?
---
hopefully you won't play the derp I did last night. tried to report me for "Holding the game hostage" because I was "Proximity hook camping".. I was like "wow, such a sore loser..." He just conveniently ignores I did generator rounds after hooking..
---
....how does that keep people from DCing?
---
Yeah but... why do you care? It‚Äôs a great feeling to have one of your favourite franchises introduced into the game, I was hella excited when Saw was teased but really... buy cosmetics if you want to support the game, they stated when the shop first came to be that 100% of its profits would go back into the games budget.
---
It's usually decently easy to tell when someone is genuinely new to the game. They're usually hiding on the edge of the map scared out of their goddamn mind.
---
But would they be add-ons like Freddy‚Äôs dream pallets? And could she have more than one of the same trap?
---
Nope, now its new ship, deal with it
---
(cute one btw)
---
If everyone around you is butthurt, then you‚Äôre the one who is butthurt
---
That was a M1, not a hatchet. The sound she makes is different. Also she walks in a straight line off the balcony, so she probably lagged out. On her client she probably turned around and hit you, and for some reason that hit was okay'd by the server even though she lost connection and kept walking. Then it tries to catch up and this happens.
---
Well what do you expect, you're at redranks. Is baby killer having a tuff time at red ranks? Boo hoo.
---
*sees new 4v1 predator game* "no I'm not crying"

I'm going to assume it's Last Year.  Just a guess based off other comments.

---
No, no one does that.
---
You can moon walk with survivor I saw someone do it in s YouTube video it‚Äôs just much more difficult
---
Yes that was totally intentional, that's why he was running to the gate last second
---
Lol I cant remember again I ever just shit on a killers ancestors and not let him get me in the end.
---
I would blame the person doing the unsafe unhook in any case, lol
---
I think it would be add-ons and maybe each add on has a different trap design. So if one add on gave them the exhaustion effect, it Would give them a different looking trap (p.s. saw is one of my favorite horror movie franchises).
---
The devs need to sort out the clipping with her default hair on her new jacket
---
I have seen survivors doing it, but only like 2 and it was on rank 1
---
No0b3 did it when he played with a controller, I can't remember which of the 2 videos it is in however
---
Oh. See, I have that, but if I try to put anything else in it just says 'this isn't supported'.

Watchful Eye: *You feel a connection to a dark, mysterious energy.*
---
When the Killer is further than 32/28/24 meters away from you and initiates a chade, their aura will be revealed to you for 3 seconds. Survivors within 8 meters of you will also see the Killer's aura when the perk activates. 
---
"Let's keep at it, that thing is occupied elsewhere."
---
Game Plan: *A dark force gives you guidance in this forsaken world.*
---
When you enter a chase with the Killer, auras of pallets and windows within 30 meters are shown to you. Goes on cooldown for 40/30/20 seconds when chase is broken.
---
"Relax, I have a plan, let's give it a go."
---
Motivation: *This dark energy bestows upon you a great power, that comes at a cost."
---
The aura of a survivor in the dying state that is fully recovered will be shown to you in white. Getting within 16/14/12 meters of the downed survivor and pressing the "Activate Ability" button will put the survivor in the healthy state.
---
Upon motivating a survivor, the Killer will receive  a notification to your location and your aura will be revealed to him for 25/20/15 seconds.
---
Motivation can only be used once per trial.
---
"Get the fuck up and run! I'll keep this bastard busy!"
---
Not only that but if all of her pools become corrupted at the same time, they all get cleared at once and it gives her corrupt purge as if she had used one fountain. If you can clear all her pools like that, it actually takes a lot of potential usage away from her.
---
Sounds cool. But let‚Äôs not add anything from 7 that‚Äôs trash
---
Am i the only one who hasn‚Äôt seen these jokes? I see a lot of the people yelling and then the cat ‚Äújust trying to learn the game‚Äù or whatever the fuck
---
Trapper can be very good and change the game in a instant , in my opinion is balanced and should stay where it is
---
Ok.... met could have easily ran straight to the exits, instead opted to sit back (probably to be healed for archive)... adam could have escape at any point chooses not to to opt for a flashlight blind or heal (again probably archive).
---
.... so that's 3 people who could've escaped and the only victim would have been jane...  weather they planned on getting end gamed or not doesnt matter, they allowed it to happen and had a very easy and clear opportunity to just leave.
---
you seem like a pretty decent player, just a tip (im no good myself so take it with a bit of salt) when the killer is lunging a ton you can let them swing through the pallet and keep running, you can get another loop or two through it
---
Sounds cool but dont add anything from 7 that‚Äôs trash
---
Camping? They were literally all there? Was he supposed to let them unhook and just walk out the gate? 
---
Fuck off dude just enjoy the clip of dumb people being punished for being dumb.
---
The Hags Bog Water
---
I think I saw it , but I would like a video with a camera on the controller
---
Pog.exe
---
Seems like they haven't seen a Wraith since his buff back last christmas lmao
---
Not a trapper main. Just been enjoying playing him recently.
---
Yeah thats what I do
---
Exept I just let em go I don't let wm do "plays"
---
Still mad about the Iron Maiden trap.
---
I do it even tho i play on pc
---
Probably make a seperate stickied post asking the subreddit? 
---
    
---
Imo don't do that. Unless the meme is over a year old.
---
Looks awesome!
---
Which one is that from? Haven‚Äôt watched the movies in a while and have forgotten most of the traps
---
r/whooosh
---
Wow dude you are so badass
---
I need to add some mlg sounds to this
---
hew mewber to the heud?
---
They were nice to you apparently.
---
props to them.
---
This is pretty common at low killer ranks. As you rank up you'll get lobbies much faster.
---
Saw 3D, The one where he kidnaps the guy who ‚Äú said‚Äú he was tested
---
Ive done it once before (u can see clip if u scrollthru my profile
---
They should increase gen times for SWF and completely get rid of Ruin. Problem solved.
---
Really? Why not?
---
We‚Äôre mad because your wrong and your being an ass about it. Adam could be the type of survivor that goes around to try and find the killer just to be chased. You could be right that op is lying, but we won‚Äôt ever know.
---
I think in 2.15 hours.
---
I agree, a good trapper can do well. I play on ps4 and I see him being played regularly so he isnt a killer who just fell into obscurity like clown, hag, or nurse on console
---
I guess I'm not immersed enough then
---
I must‚Äôve forgotten how to read then üòÖ
---
yet it's probably the most accurate in my experience
---
What if you combine it with head on? Lol
---
Is this rhetorical or would you like me to try?
---
Cant find it. The closest I get is a trap from the video game
---
He was literally hitting the guy on the hook. Then a survivor came and rescued. He took that opportunity to tunnel. Oh but they were all there! If he knew they were all there, why would he give them an opportunity to save by hitting him on the hook? **Think logically dude.**
---
Survivor mains act like this and then cry when you mori them lol
---
Good thing this isnt cursive lmao
---
Freddy, among the 3, is the one with the best map control. You need to be good at predicting survivor movements, while they try to predict yours. A good Freddy can use snares effectively to stop survivors between tiles, or looping the same tile. The biggest tip I have - is to start the game patrolling gens in a manner the reinacts chasing a survivor and place a snare between tiles. So when a survivor does flee between tiles they are forced to use dead hard to do it or it cancels their burst from another ability giving you a free hit before they reach the next pallet.
---
Also pushing survivors into generstors you can teleport to and get the jump or close distance to them.
---
Also fake pallets suck, good survivors just remember them via "huh that pallet wasn't there when I was awake" or they just see you placing them and communicstes it to their team.
---
I got this game yesterday played as the trapper and got t bagged every time I got with a pallet. I know not everyone is like that but man it was frustrating for my first game
---
Depending on the severity and frequency the timeouts occur I will still probably dc against the 2 things I dc against.
---
Be able to carry 3 traps at once, make it so survivors can't get out in one try, and make it to sabotaging traps take much longer or remove the ability to sabo them completely. I don't ever play trapper but he is in a bad spot and in desperate need for some attention
---
On PS4 the only one I don't like to play against is spirit, I haven't even buy spirit because of how much I dislike her
---
Look out, it's Michael Meowers!
---
I've been called a tunneler in these instances. Also have chssed people and they farmed without BT mid chase and when i downed the unhooked survivor I got chewed out. Why are you mad at me when your idiot teammate farms you mid chase? I see it all the time when I play survivor as well and its just like smdh
---
no mindgames are when both sides have the same odds to win. For exemple when you hide your red glow in a corner the survivor has to position himself by guessing which direction the killer is taking. That's a mindgame 'cause both have to take a decision by guessing.
---
Spirit phasing has 0 mindgames specially since most players use headset that allow you to locate survivor without seeing them.
---
Sometimes during a KYF the killer will know I have Head On and DS and they hate me because it‚Äôs either get stunned or get stunned for a slightly shorter time
---
I am waiting like hopping some challenges have changed
---
Ok twat
---
baby killers love to facecamp so that‚Äôs gonna be a hard no to let them down me, not bc they‚Äôre toxic or anything but bc they genuinely don‚Äôt know what else to do half the time
---
maybe explain to the person cleansing next time, instead of just being an agressive main. Or do you expect everyone to learn without being taught ?
---
wow super meta build. Incroyable
---
&gt;Yeah but... why do you care? It‚Äôs a great feeling to have one of your favourite franchises introduced into the game, I was hella excited when Saw was teased but really... buy cosmetics if you want to support the game, they stated when the shop first came to be that 100% of its profits would go back into the games budget.
---
I care because more players = more players?
---
I never said anything about op lying, but thanks for admitting you are mad :)
---
It‚Äôs random don‚Äôt look to much into it
---
Now I can't tell if predator would be somthin the wraith does cause I don't read lore much and his weapon but I have a feeling you might have had some inspiration by the name
---
I personally don‚Äôt mind anyone maiming them, I just personally don‚Äôt did their most effective Playstyle all that fun or interesting. I find their power to be very underwhelming to use because it‚Äôs basically M1 but Faster and Tracking. Their Fatigue is really unnecessary especially when you consider the fact that Survivors still get the Speed boost as if they were hit by a normal attack. I just wanted to know why someone might find their power to be fun to use and why they would play them. I can see form the downvoted though that people mistake me for some douchebag who is like ‚Äúimagine maining Legion‚Äù. I‚Äôm simply interested as to why someone enjoys them so much.
---
They said they're adding PvE on the Discord server.
---
You think he could've just missed the Adam right next to him and hit the hooked person instead? Either fucking way, who cares about camping during egc? For someone who tells me to "think logically" you sure don't seem to realize that camping during egc only really makes sense.
---
I mean, if you purposely chase the player that was just unhooked, rather than going for the person who did the unhooking..... 
---
A great thing some killers will do is down the already hooked survivor, but will leave them on the ground and chase someone else after. It's a good way to punish the survivors for being stupid, slow down gen progression, and still not be seen as a tunneler.
---
I stopped playing survivor in the morning because I one time woke up my family
---
Really? What are you? 13? It's a content creator and he can choose his titles. What's wrong with haters? Grow up and stop hating.
---
Out of the last 7 (Oni included) killers only 2 have been licenced ones. So what seems to be the problem? I for one welcome any new chapter they give us be it an original or a licenced one. I never understood why some people bitch about either one.
---
Well yeah. I remembered how Philip(The wraith) ripped out his boss‚Äôs spine when he found out what he was doing to all those people.
---
Fingers crossed!
---
please god
---
Weird flex but ok brah.
---
if you are injured and step in to a trap. you are down
---
Not necessarily. 
---
Stunning her removes her power, so Plagues with blood puke usually MEGA respect pallets. It can buy you some additional loop time per loop.
---
As long as you never get forced into a dead zone or a low wall loop, she can be easier to loop with her power than without it.
---
Her old model was pretty ugly, so yeah that was the joke.
---
Yeah I kinda wish you could chat, I've faced a lot of toxic killers that I would've talked trash to tbh
---
The most salt was the Dead Sea. So I was quote unquote camping because all the survivors were camping the hook (Jeff tried to pallet stun me I saw Bill through the window and Meg stuck her head out thru the door. ) so I had to camp again for Meg because she was getting camped as well. So then I chased this rlly good Bill, only 1 hit them he dc. He said I don‚Äôt want to lose to a trash camper. So I responded: So you‚Äôd rather give me points and lose a pip and points or you‚Äôd rather give me points and lose a pip and points just because you don‚Äôt want more points. I wasn‚Äôt even planning on letting him get camped because it was only Jeffy. Jeff ended up escaping w/o a hitch bc I‚Äôm blind
---
Or just merge we'll make it with weglf
---
I gotta find these icons these are so good
---
Thats how we rule!
---
lol had this happen to me the other day. Except the survivor ran past me and had me killed before I could escape.
---
Not as complex as I thought it would be.
---
yeah and when a new good perk comes out you want a nerf xD. What do you expect? Should I run deja vu? Survivors run the same perks because there aren't more than 8 good perks for survivors. I as a survivor have to run unbreakable to not get slugged, ds to counter tunneling and BT to make sure my team mates have a chance to escape camping and tunneling. I don't make always use of them but it is necessary.
---
that‚Äôs why you always gotta look for the open hand David
---
I'm assuming because of licensing with the copyright holders, I'm not totally sure
---
&gt; survivor
---
&gt; main
---
Wtf just pick the smallest/immersed ones and be happy, they dont have special ability like killers
---
That is extremely satisfying.
---
awfully pedantic of you
---
Never Gonna happen x,d
---
Freddy is hilariously creeping his way into memes as powerful now after all the killer mains had a reality check with the stats.
---
Getting out of a trap shouldn‚Äôt be random. It should be the same as doctors tier three madness and pigs reverse bear traps. Then you can adjust the time it takes to get out to help balance him.  Instead of instantly getting out or never getting out.
---
Does it help if you're a rank 15 baby killer üò≠
---
No, just send me to hell :( I still think about the one time I did it a lot.
---
Not to mention Behavior just released the statistics that prove the killers are over-performing at almost every level.  But no, we still have idiots who think the game is survivor biased.
---
The trap looks like the medieval times Iron Maiden. In the story, his wife gets trapped and burned alive for him lying about his story
---
Place portals early on near gens behind hidden walls or on hills. Don't use them all, and don't bother activating them. When you're in a really drawn out chase, just lay a portal down (hopefully near a gen) and just yeet yourself out. If the gens are nearly finished and you have portals to spare, then you can start placing them directly on gens to detect people working on them.
---
You can still use the pounce on many short loops, just a bit tricker.
---
She Was killed for no reason
---
I personally find their power extremely underwhelming. To me their power is just faster M1 with tracking but Successful Hits are worse yet still give Survivors Speed Boost. Vaulting Pallets is an interesting mechanic but because Feral Frenzy enforces you to either go after someone else or suffer a 4 Second Fatigue and then chase them down as a M1 Killer. I remember around the time before their Release People were begging the devs for secondary objectives for Survivors and I feel like this is the main reason for the Deep Wound Mechanic. But the Problem is that Deep Wounds will be nerfed and that people were asking for a secondary objective for Survivors that wouldn‚Äôt be tied to a Single Killer.
---
Wouldn't that just encourage survivors who farm in front of the killer to just run to the nearest sap they detect?
---
If you're a good SWF you'd probably be able to save from a camping killer. And the downing part wasn't necessary I just mean that don't bully the killer into demotivation.
---
if I‚Äôm left w only one other person and I know where the hatch is and I get found I run to the opposite corner of the map lol hope they know where it is too
---
Oh. That‚Äôs the brazen bull im pretty sure.
---
He is the most efficient at killing. Full stop..
---
The bias you talk about is akin with all killers. You're desperation is visible..
---
Would love to know how she ignored the grab then :P
---
It takes 80 seconds to complete a generator, and corrupt lasts for 2 minutes. 50% of a generator is 40 seconds. Do you really think survivors doing 40 seconds worth of generator progress in 2 minutes is "gen rushing"?
---
usually here it‚Äôs best to assume they have borrowed time and go for the unhooker. Other than the fact they‚Äôre doing an unsafe hook, they‚Äôre just farming some random guy or the fact the person may have DS, it‚Äôs not very enjoyable being hooked then instantly hooked again after because of a farming teammate. Usually go for the unhooker, they‚Äôre probably awful that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre doing such garbage unhooks or they‚Äôre intentionally farming. Either way it‚Äôs a win win for the killer ;) punish a farmer, get a free hook one the bad unhooker.
---

Hadn't played Killer in a while, picked it up once the Archives came. Was deranked all the way to 18.
---
The amount of tbagging swf's was heartbreaking, maybe once every 3 games I would get a flashlight mob doing squats when they first meet me.
---
They did always stop by the second minute as they realized I wouldn't be taunted into super safe chases or picking survivors up not facing a wall while giving them plenty of space to unhook and heal. PGC was always a quiet place too with just ggs all around.
---
You don't fight toxicity with toxicity. You fight it by showing them a good time.
---
they kinda buff (smallish) next patch. While someone is carried and you take a hit it'll count as protective hit - a stack then.
---
Alright, say camping is an optimal strategy during Endgame Collapse, tunnelling is not. The survivor you tunnel could be protected by Borrowed Time, like the one in this clip and the survivor could also have decisive. If that were the case they all would've escaped but OP is clearly playing against low rank survivors who have no idea what they're doing. 
---
One last thing. If you watch the beginning of the clip again, you will see no survivors in sight. The Jane only appeared after OP hit the survivor on the hook. This is no scenario where OP is chasing someone around the hook and it's evident. 
---
Can we come to an agreement?

Sorry for giving the wrong name

I'm sorry for your experience. But as you said not nearly everyone is like that. Some people are nice.

Yeah that would be almost impossible to do without farming with the survivors in red ranks.

---
Bhrv: True, we will do some adjustments and show better statistics in the upcoming patch, aswell as nerfing the pig.
---
That‚Äôs what I do. I applaud killers who attack me right after I‚Äôm unhooked unsafely by some maroon who thinks having heart is what matters instead of bringing BT.
---
That could've been funny if it didn't take to long to explain
---
That's cool
---
Praise away brother!
---
It's called hubris my man.  They didn't allow it to happen, their cockiness caused it to happen.  Key to a good killer is capitalizing on survivors mistakes.  You can't just ignore the human element of the game when it's convenient.  You can make whatever excuses you want, but a 4k is a 4k.  That simple.
---
Is that the Spirit??
---
Trappers biggest problems come from survivors finishing the game before he even gets started... but once he gets started.....oh man.
---
If you're not in a SWF a killer will probably be able to have a good time in the chase because it's easier to catch a slow survivor rather than a group.
---
Adam could have body blocked and 2/3 people could have gone out, I honestly don't know why people bother posting videos of them playing like absolute garbage and getting lucky that the enemy team was also garbage, the same shit always happens on the Rainbow Six Siege subreddit
---
he can't handle the truth of god tier freddy.
---
Your rank 15 so your fine :)

BUT AS SOON AS YOUR RANK 10
---
I understand the joke... No need to be an ass hole. Just wanted to clarify my user flair.
---
Sometimes there are shrine perks that are too good to pass on
---
Neas have a habit of running urban evasion around the map away from their dying hooked teammates until the hatch, then they sit there and self-care as the rest of the team bleeds out and then leaves. The longer you play, the more Neas you come across that seem to genuinely be working for the enemy team. 
---
It‚Äôs also a popular theory that she‚Äôs the entity, which Samination either came up with or made popular.
---
I tried combining this with the actual meme but all of the things I used before to make gifs on my phone are just being dumb so I decided to post it until I figure it out.
---
Sounds like good combo with Pop goes the Weasel, I‚Äôd this make this a meta perk still, but still good.

Yes, I had to catch my monitor in my lap, but my towers on the floor always, so it wasn‚Äôt at risk of falling

I kinda feel offended tho
---
Sweaty jake main
---
Something like that would be good
---
He'd make a better killer.
---
Never gonna give you up would be a tunneling perk
---
Never gonna let you down would disable the struggle bar and give some kind of bonus while carrying a survivor.
---
Never gonna run around would prevent looping somehow.
---
His power would be the rickroll, which tricks you in the downed state somehow
---
Her vomit is ranged. How do you possibly not get caught? She can spit that on objects and people. It‚Äôs impossible to not get caught and do objectives.
---
Rin, what did you do to Philip???
---
Hag -&gt; Leatherface -&gt; any of your choice.
---
I bought him... unfortunately...
---
I‚Äôve never t bagged in chases honestly, only killers who deserve that are the ones who play super scummy, other than that what‚Äôs the point in acting like that to them for no reason?
---
This has the same "git gud" energy as Dark souls.
---
Lol, thats quite alot funnier then her being ugly.
---
Whats the level 4?
---
He became the spirit
---
Bruh. No chill, man.

Just buy Pig lol. She's not very strong, but is one of the most fun Killers to play IMO.

Its as easy as 1 2 3 :)

Daily reminder: you can't loop a ranged attack
---
Knee-ah
---
I've legitimately removed Adrenaline from my perkset due to the killer meta.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main and I am a baby killer, but I kinda disagree. If you‚Äôre not playing against friends in a custom match, you‚Äôre not really owed help from random survivors.
---
I‚Äôm trying really hard to get good at the game. It‚Äôs frustrating, but it‚Äôll be satisfying.
---
The key to a good killer is playing optimally regardless of mistakes and always play like they wont make any... relying on random moments of mercy that weren't at all in the killer hands or raw error that the survivors gave, and the killer didn't achieve isnt being a good killer.
---
Earn it.
---
Dont rely on survivors to give you something get it your fucking self.
---
Good killer-wins a game and the survivors have no opportunity for winning themselves when he reaches his point.
---
Bad killer-doesnt win against optimal play... only manages to get 2 or more killer because of a mistake, not his own skill or outplay. Sheer dumb luck got him kills that wouldn't have happened.
---
Just saying dude playing based on sub optimal moments is gunna net you even more entity displeased, exit gate t bags 4 man escapes then your getting already.
---
Play for perfection or play at a weaker skill lvl. And fail to keep up when perfection comes along.
---
The one you currently live in now. His rework gave him a lot more to his base kit and a whole power rework.
---
I got Prove Thyself last week. I have all the characters, minus Clown and Kate, so choosing perks is easy.
---
sorry man but low rank new killers prolly still gonna camp even if everyone is playing solo, besides playing in a swf or solo doesn‚Äôt change your looping skill just your overall 4v1 advantage
---
this isnt cursive. just really poor handwriting.
---
Did you guys know that DC in that statistics counts as a kill too ?
---
With how he walked over and she turned to look, i was hoping she would start unbuckling his belt : \^)
---
Yeah, it was meant more as "help rather than bully"
---
Games where you don‚Äôt cleanse are boring and unfun, change my mind.
---
talking about reddit killers
---
tell us
---
And this is why I use meg mask
---
I‚Äôd much prefer them not give me an help.
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm for bullying though, whether you‚Äôre surv or killer.
---
I‚Äôm not flawless, i made that mistake before, but I‚Äôm not proud of it
---
Yes but that was 6 chapters ago. There was 4 originals after that and Ghost Face can also be considered an original since only the mask is licenced. He had his own unique lore. So the only true licenced killer in a long time has been The Demogorgon.
---
So out of the 18 killers in the game there's 5 (and a half) licenced ones. So your point is kinda invalid.
---
Why are you attacking the one who just got unhook. He was never agree with this decision. That why tunneling is so toxic you died and you can do nothing. Its the fault of survivor and killer. Why survivor you unhook the survivor when the killer is just here and killer, why are attacking the same survivor. Its sad for him. That why i never camp and i don't tunneling, if i tunneling, i just let the guy struggle. If you attack the same survivor that because you are weak mister the killer, you attack the injured survivor. And survivor toxic is toxic. Because they unhook you. Its just a game and i think everybody can play fair.
---
I don't agree.
---
2 kills USED to the safe goal for killers which resulted in one kill and facecamping the second survivor.
---
It was horrible for the survivors, and I say this as a killer main.
---
If kills themselves will judge about a killers doing, you'll see a raise in NOED, Ebony Moris, slugging and especially tunneling.
---
Also if you try to balance the game arround a 2 escape 2 kills scenario it would mean massive nerfs to killers. You don't often get "just" two kills. 
---
You either snowball (because of survivor mistakes, you doing really good or disconnects) or you get wrecked.
---
&gt; Right now killers are overperforming at most levels, the stats prove that.
---
They don't. If we look at the red rank kill stats (all the low rank stuff doesn't bother me) it shows you how good killers are performing in these ranks.
---
Which ... well. If you get less than 3Ks you'll depip and not stay in red ranks.
---
It's like saying: "Teen pregnancy falls to 0% above the age of 18/19."
---
What the stats are good at is showing how often killers tend to get picked in these ranks.
---
Their performance is tied to other factors not shown in these statistics.
---
Yeah do this most the time, because often they will hit you even when using the pallet, so it‚Äòs better just getting hit and let the pallet alive, than dropping it too.
---
Flapjack!

Worth the read lmao
---
That's an awful idea. Making a ranked and a casual would already push the best survs and killers to ranked and leave the less serious people or learners in casual. I don't love swf as a killer main, but not allowing it in ranked would be bad. You don't need to punish survivors who are going against the best killers with meta builds by making everyone go in solo Q.

Vigil should be reworked.

Its kinda hard to explain, but lets take the word "erotic" for example. Most people would pronounce the "e" like error, engine or electricity, but the "e" in that word has to be pronounced more like the "i" in ill, just make it a little longer. And the "a" isnt supposed to be pronounced like in "gay", more like in "arr", like a pirate, but make the "a" much shorter and faster.

I usually kill myself if the killers had a bad match and/or I‚Äôve looped them for three or more gens. I know how rough it is to get fucked by good survivors. It‚Äôs the same thing as giving the last survivor the hatch after you‚Äôve steamrolled.
---
It's mocking. It's basically trying to deliberately piss someone off for your own gain. Its disrespectful.
---
Yeah but endgame perks are more Aces up the sleeve if you get destroyed. Remember me, NOED, Blood Warden, Adrenaline, Left behind seem to be secret for until that final stretch. I see your point as well, just hoping the (mostly) unused perks get facelifts.
---
You dig through his account because he said ‚Äúyikes‚Äù to some stupid ass comment you made lmao.
---
Evolve deserved so much better
---
Franklin‚Äôs can be really good for the hag cause you can trap the item and if they don‚Äôt crouch to go get it they can trip the trap and you can teleport back to them and hit them again. Not a foolproof plan but can very well work especially in grassier/dark areas
---
WGLF is a much welcome for those aiming to get extra bloodpoints, and can easily be done without intentional farming
---
Had a t.tv call me a cunt on stream for this. Also made fun of me for being American. (He was from the UK)
---
Didn't even hook him, I slugged him. So the farmer would lose points. :/
---
i always just said knee-uh 
---
is it like n-eh-ar
---
Jesus..... it's a game
---
The only perk that could potentially make totems undoable would have to be a hex perk that rebuilds broken totems but if broken it doesn‚Äôt and would have to have a long 2 min plus cool down
---
All I ever see is the "when demogorgon hits a survivor" * insert funny picture with open mouth here *

Holy shit tldr

Away with the r, otherwise its pretty good.

Why is he slit apart like the spirit?? Why is his left arm so bulky?? Why does he have the hallowed blight effect??? Am I delirious again.
---
Which, if you read it, that's my point.
---
Sorry, it's there.
---
Ya true there are a lot of useless shit for both sides
---

But you‚Äôre forgiven! You‚Äôre much nicer than most people that do sexual comments here atleast! :D
---
I feel bad for upvoting that Xenomorph idea :(
---
Basically spinechill when insidious
---
I‚Äôm proud of him
---
Don't be sorry it's just way too long winded for me.  I'm sorry tbh, was a shit reply.
---
Not really. It takes one perk slot hat you could have used for a needed perk that will be used by a swf player.
---
Aye for messages part you can put it to where only friends can message you.
---
It's coming out today, level 3? Am I understanding correctly?
---
 No, he was good at looping SO he was being cocky about it. OP wasn‚Äôt saying that optimal looping is a cocky thing.
---
Holy crap. You need a snicker.
---
Ok, got it. 
---
(This didn't happen, but just curious) What if the killer didn't chase us at the end and he blocked the other gate as well. Would that count as both of them HTGH or still no?
---
Sorry to ask but how did he got him MORI while not being downed?

Truth.  Gonna have to go ancient mode and just break out a chess board in Dunkin' Donuts at this point.
---
6 or more insults....
---
Yeah, you totally missed the motherfucking point, dawg.
---
As a trapper main I approve lol
---
Been reading this, and Bubba and Legion are very similar to Clown in that you need to know when to leave a chase. They're pretty monstrous when you can do that.
---
To dismiss the statistics. Seeing it from a lot of people on this sub. 
---
It is a completely fair way to interpret the statistics. Do you remember the previous set of statistics?
---
The only bias shown in these stats is that it combines all 3 platforms. They previously gave much more detailed statistics, but they have now focused on the stats that have a direct correlation to killer power and killer popularity. Best and worst is only a summary - you can literally see exactly where the killers fall. 
---
The issue with the nurse is that she has the lowest kill rate on console of all the killers even pre nerf.
---
Freddy was never the worst killer. The pig was never the worst killer. Wraith was never the worst killer.
---
Clown, Plague and huntress consistently had the worst statistics, whilst the hag, billy and the trapper consistently had the best.
---
There is very little to be misunderstood. It is the community who gets carried away. The way they work to balance this asymmetrical game is by a '2 kills a game' format, so it is completely reasonable to interpret stats like these. 
---
The reworks mainly come from reports of players not having fun on both sides.
---
Anyone know how big the playerbase is on switch? I'm weary of getting any multiplayer game on switch because its online crowd seems minuscule compared to others.
---
I never do this type of unhook unless i know the killer has BBQ and i have borrowed time
---
Im just out here on fallout 4 for like 3 hours after playing 1 game of dbd
---
Never works for me, and I'm not play Claudette (for right now at least)
---
If it didn‚Äôt, it would definitely count as ‚Äúworking with the killer‚Äù and ‚Äúbodyblocking‚Äù so idk if it matters, really. I guess maybe it would and that would be what you would report the killer for? Not sure. Super specific situation. Ask your lawyer lol
---
I respect that. But some Nea mains are insane lol. At least you're not one of 'em.
---
I'm going to have to put that in chats now, either one happy pig fart boop snoot or camp.
---
Isn't Myers's fist clenched in this video? Or am I seeing it wrong?
---
I would give ANYTHING for any sort of crackdown on stale, repetitive posts  that plague this subreddit. I don't need a perfect solution, anything will suffice as long as people stop rehashing the same damn joke week after week after week but it's ok because they used a different episode of Spongebob this time.
---
Myers has an addons that allows him to kill while in evil within 3. Downside is it takes much longer to get to EW3 and a kill knocks him out of it
---
Lol, thx for humoring me.
---
Claudette
---
I‚Äôm stealing this shamelessly, fucking lol‚Äôd while I‚Äôm taking a shit at work
---
I retired to Absolver for a while and it was a great destressor, but the devs seem to have abandoned that game.  Gotta find something else.
---
‚ÄúDigging through someone‚Äôs account‚Äù it was their most recent post besides responding to me lmao
---
nah, it‚Äôs an interesting question :)
---
Where was the game on sale at?
---
[Yui Kimura's lore can be found here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e1yrgg/yui_kimura_lore_dead_by_daylight/)
---
Steal away! We're out here just trying to bool on Survivors.
---
I'd love it if certain characters had different animations for Myers's stab. Like I feel David would just haul off and punch Myers in the face instead of just tapping his shoulder.
---
It‚Äôs a better version of the stranger things format!
---
Keep struggling for those 861 points
---
Fallout 4, outlast 1 and 2, outer worlds, undertale, killing floor, detroit become human, spiderman, dark souls, borderlands 3, and minecraft are all amazing games
---
You get the damn point, you shouldn‚Äôt be so pissed at ‚Äúyikes‚Äù.
---
Baby yeed is so funny!
---
Why not just leave after the match. If words hurt you so much, don't read it. Have your fun during the game, finish the game, quick "gg" or nothing at all and leave. Im on console, I've just blocked messages from people who aren't on my friends list.
---
He speaks the truth
---
She's the entity not the killer /s
---
Wow that‚Äôs an awesome screen shot! Looks like promotional art for the game!
---
Wraith has the scariest stun noise, change my mind
---
Don‚Äôt need it. I‚Äôm not here for points, I‚Äôm here to have fun.
---
Kudos to you. Exactly my thoughts. 
---
It was fun back then but now everything is wrong or toxic or a crutch whatsoever.
---
I usually just ignore this at all tbh when i play solo or killer. 
---
Oh the survivor has DS, cool idc.
---
Oh the killer has ruin, nice.
---
Oh the survivor found the hatch before me, 
---
congrats.
---
Its whatsoever and just a game.
---
People just forgot to have fun and are really only looking for the next negative thing to talk about.
---
And when i do play swf with my friends( ha yes i do have those) oh boy we dont care at all, we killer deliver to other persons on purpose and more for the laughs. 
---
And sometimes the killer will understand how we play and starts to have fun with us instead of really trying to get that 4k or whatever you would imagine.
---
Its a game, have fun, dont be rude and accept game mechanics and in return you dont get negativity back.
---
r/stabbygang
---
&gt; there's a zinger (like the Legion as Thanos and Frank's+SWS+Nemesis+Beast of Prey are the stones
---
So....the damn old jokes that's already been beaten to death?  Oh yea, real quality material  there
---
&gt; Every other game usually has a different subreddit dedicated to memes but it's ALWAYS dead.
---
There's a reason for  that. Turns out when you don't have a captive audience and people actually have to opt-in to view shit posts, it doesn't make for good content. If anything, it would be better if Hex:memeless mode worked in opposite, you had to actively go out of your way to see the waves of shitposts that plague this subreddit.
---
They‚Äôre referring to how the survivor walks around loops and the environment in general. Not necessarily a technique, whoever might have been caught off guard by the route the survivor takes or they might be sarcastic and the survivor did something silly.
---
there is like three in my first post about her, but I think they're funny so they dont bother me!
---
Probably because she's really tall. It looks like she's slower, but she's not.
---
Well my friend (even though we are not really friends, but I wanted to give you an amicable title), as someone in the same age range who is just trying to make ends meet, and with little down time I have, I too just want to have fun.
---
I may not have played DBD for as long as you have, but in the months that I've played, despite trying to play "fairly", I still get curb-stomped and/or disrespected 90% of the games I play.
---
The experience has caused me to not take the game seriously... Like at all. Now I play silly, which I know defeats the intention of the game, and pisses off a lot people I play with and against, but I don't care, since these are the same people usually who try to ruin other people's games. But the people that are there for fun, usually become silly too, it's pretty fulfilling, and everyone who participates ends up with a decent score too.
---
I'm not telling you that you should do the same thing, but this is how I deal with it (because I still like the premise of the game). Whatever you decide, I hope brings you the most enjoyment possible.
---
As a side note I wish there was some secret handshake that killers/survivors that are good sports could do at the beginning of a match, so that everyone involved could play seriously, but with no hard feelings.
---
I'm good at looping killers while conserving as many pallets as I can. Dead hard allows me to extend a chase if I've made a mistake and I'm about to get caught (usually because of bloodlust 2-3)
---
I've gained minutes of looping with a single use of dead hard. Its an incredibly strong perk when used properly.
---
Looks like Ash finally found his chainsaw
---
Yah right especially Demo and the doctor
---
Definitely. I never use NOED unless I don‚Äôt  have a better slot (when I just prestige a killer or on a new killer). I don‚Äôt like being cheesy and banking on failing my objective in the first place. But to say using NOED makes you play with 3 perks is just a lie, it gives a shit ton of value if it activates or not which is why I think it‚Äôs too strong
---
She big tall
---
Overcome.adapt.improvise.
---
jokes on you. i tunnel and facecamp for literally no reason at all
---
My friend and I def agree, that if you use iri it should disable any add on that gives you more hatchets. Its a really cool mechanic when its one in a chamber
---
It‚Äôs just not many people are actually at rank 20 so to avoid 2 hour queues they keep increasing the range at which the ranks are found
---
Nah fam, my fantasy red dragons work to preserve all life on the planet and are led by [one thicc momma](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/heroesofthestorm/images/7/75/Alexstrasa_image_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20171104003908) so yeah imma go with the reds.
---
When I was a noob I left gen room on Badham. I went to get rid of a Demo portal and got rubberbanded right back into the room. Deadass thought I went into the portal
---
I only give the hatch to a baby survivor or let them go if two people DC'ed and they gave up entirely
---
I just bought legion so this feels real

---
That's the point, it's a game. OP is trying to have fun and the frankly disgusting levels of toxicity and vitriol in this community are ruining that for them, and many others. 
---
Also why comment this? All you're doing is trying to undermine the message of this post and belittle the OP. You're simultaneously a selfawarewolf and proving the OP's point about there being no fun left in this community.
---
I like this, this is good
---
Main reason why Aftercare is a mainstay on my loadout now.
---
60% of the time it works 100% of the time
---
Meanwhile outlast is just teabag simulator
---
# I‚Äôm not even joking, if you spam crouch, doesn‚Äôt matter the difficulty, the enemies can‚Äôt hurt you within melee range and, once within that range, stop chasing you until you stop teabagging. This was fixed in outlast 2 if I recall correctly.
---
I didn't even get through the last level of the archives because I was sick of grinding endlessly and not having fun to complete some of those ridiculous challenges. Behavior can have my $10 I'm done with the archives, I'd rather play the game than throw a bunch of matches to complete the challenges.
---
Or you can hit skillchecks 
---
That's also an option
---
&gt;Just hide the memes and move on with your life instead of worrying about how other people have fun.
---
Doesn't work on mobile, and people can still have fun, I even provided a link to a dedicated shit post subreddit for DBD!
---
But since you ignored my point, people don't actually enjoy memey content otherwise that subreddit would have a semblance of life to it. If a type of content needs to parasitically attach to a subreddit just to survive then it shouldn't exist in the first place.
---
I GO OUT OF TOWN FOR THANKSGIVING TODAY AND WON‚ÄôT BE ABLE TO PLAY THE NEW ARCHIVES PAGE UNTIL SUNDAY.
---
But technically he is because portals and interdimensional travel and all that sci-fi bullshit
---
From what people have said playing on the PTB it will have 2 funtions:
---
\-When YOU are hooked everyone will see all the other survivor auras + killer aura if he is close enough to the hook (as it works right now)
---
\-When A TEAMATE is hooked and you have the perk, ONLY YOU will see the other survivor auras + killer aura if he is close to the hook as if that survivor had it equipped.
---
This means kindred now will help a lot in figuring out who should go for the rescue and who should stay in their gen, not only that but counter any non stealth killer camping hooks.
---
I usually run Bond for info, but this change makes Kindred too good to pass up, might replace it.
---
How do you know how many hours you have played?
---
(Possibly) unpopular opinion...
---
The Victory system made more sense for killers than what we have now. I've had games where I 2k and just get a safety pip in green ranks now, whether due to bad map and tile RNG, really good survivors or just poor play on my part. I've also had games where nobody died but I still pipped.
---
Chaser and Gatekeeper emblems are the dumbest things ever made. At least the survivor ones make sense.
---
Remember it‚Äôs an instadown if your head hits the screen as your weapon hits them
---
And you're a streamer too? Why am I not surprised... tunneling is universally frowned upon be the majority of the community. Only killers who lack confidence in their abilities tunnel. I'm surprised you're willingly showcasing it to an audience, I'd be embarrassed.
---
Most of the time, that "valuable" item has already been 99% used up and they want to keep it if they escape. So you're tunneling someone for carrying what amounts to a cosmetic at that point. Big brain play, right there.
---
Arguing with you is a fruitless endeavor. You're never going to change the way you play (despite it being poor form) so this will likely be my last response. You do you boo, you're the reason people dc.
---
THE RANKING SYSTEM IS THE BROKEST IVE EVER SAW IT LATELY! WHY IN THE FUCK ARE YELLOW RANK KILLERS BEING PAIRED WITH PURPLE RANK SWF‚ÄôS?! THIS SHIT TOOK ME ALL THE WAY FROM 13 BACK TO A 16!!
---
Y‚Äôall forget about the metal dragon who literally turns into a human and forgets about being a dragon so it can start a family. My point? I want to bang a dragon. I blame r/furry_irl
---
Definitely, having it be open would be much more doable
---
It was great. I wish killers were actually scary in dbd.
---
You didn't teabag a hunter while delivering blood, you got the fuck out of there.
---
Scav gameplay was so much fun before they made shock ridiculous (that's when I quit, game became about hunters hitting Q instead of shooting you)
---
The nurse on average gets the lowest kill rates across red ranks - nobody is saying she is the worst in the game.
---
The challenges and archives are only likely to impact trapper statistics, but the rest are all effected equally. Sure all stats should eb taken with a grain of salt but I find it funny how so many people are trying to flat out deny them (maybe not you but your comment certainly came across that way)
---
It being over the past month has no impact apart from the fact that it provides the most up to date and recent statistics, therefore the most reliable.
---
&gt;Furthermore, merely getting 2 kills is not great info, as that could very well mean a de-pip in many scenarios, thus meaning players in red ranks would by default have to be doing a bit better than just getting 2 kills.
---
Pipping is based on points. Balance is based on kills. that is the point. They don't balance the game so that every killer and survivor comes out with an average of 16000 points - because those aren't the win conditions. And they balance to the win conditions - so the perfect balance (that the devs have stated they chase is 2 kills a game). Pipping and kills are separate - you are mixing the two up. It isn't a variable that affects kills. If the killer gets 2 kills great. They can still depip. A survivor can escape and still depip. That is how the true fun of the game comes from having full exciting games -  which is what the point system is for.
---
I can't agree with you if you believe that when there are so many variables like matchmaking, perks and rebalances throughout a single month that a single number - amount of kills per average - is a be all end all statistic for determining the power of characters.
---
Just because there are lots of variables within the set that can affect things doesn't mean the statistics aren't significant. This is stats 'on the whole'. So it doesn't matter how many outliers you account for on each side. Yes kills is a be all and end all stat for determining power. It is literally their job to kill. The factors come into play but they all add up to whether or not the killer meets this condition. 
---
Nobody is saying you shouldn‚Äôt take things into account when looking at stats. But these are good stats whether you like what they say or not. And a lot of people do not like what they say because it goes against a lot of what they have been complaining against. And believe me, when people complain they don‚Äôt take in any of these ‚Äòvariables‚Äô.
---
But these are literally the stats they use to balance thhe game. And they make sense. It all adds up. We can point out situations like the nurse which is high skill - which can lead to certain inconsistencies, but on the whole, it is very clear. Nobody is saying 'we can't assume billy is a good killer and well balanced because these statistics have only been on the past month'. It is hard evidence.
---
&gt;I'm suggesting moderation in face of statistics as it is incredibly easy to misinterpret them. This goes for anything from games to stock reports.
---
As someone who works with a lot of statistics I have to agree, but this isn't stock reports lmao. Stocks would be a lot more simple to predict if the parameters were this defined.
---
Steel dragon. I put that in there
---
You like to make assumptions and fling insults, but you know nothing about my "intentions".  It is more than common in this game to see people say GG after curbstomping you and you beat them a few games later and they spew enough hate to make Palpatine jealous. Just counting the number of GG's when won vs lost shows there is a problem with the mindset of the user base in general.
---
There are optimal ways to run tiles as a survivor, and experienced and competent players on both sides will know many of these routes. If line of sight is broken, you can abuse the fact that the killer will expect you to try and follow those optimal routes, and go for unconventional routes around the tile or even leave the tile entirely. You are taking "unique", non-optimal paths that however can allow you to confuse and even lose the killer, making distance on them because of it, or at least to prolong the run at the tile without using its window too much or wasting its pallet. The risk of using non-optimal paths is that if the killer catches on to you doing so, they might get a hit on you or force the pallet earlier than if you had simply followed the conventional path. Iron Will is pretty much necessary to do this while injured, otherwise the killer will often hear that you are following a different path.
---
TOME 3 WHEN TOME 3 WHEN TOME 3 WHEN
---
Hover over the game on the dashboard/My games and Apps, press start, go to official club, then the progress tab for stats
---
Say whatever you want about this game, but the art team they've got are freaking nailing it, I won't accept anyone saying otherwise.
---
Imagine if a killer who slugged everyone when gates were powers just dragged them all to the gate, opened it, and swung in the exit direction as a sort of ‚Äúslug race‚Äù, where they Mori the last one left.
---
I‚Äôm definitely a fan of proximity spawning, and them coming open. I also think it‚Äôd be nice if the animation when he stepped in his own trap was significantly shortly, like he steps it in and just immediately resets it and moves on. 
---
I don‚Äôt think disarming should go though or that deactivating the traps should take skill checks. Disarming takes a ton of time anyway and either requires a toolbox or sabo. The amount of time it trades for maybe denying the trapper 2 or 3 traps is fair. Skill checks are just not fun, they won‚Äôt impact high skill survivors and just make him more tedious to fight. I am good with the time it takes to deactivate one being slightly buffed.
---
Start off with 2 traps and put them in lockers like the Huntress' hatchets. Also make them a little darker by default.
---
Well yeah. That's because surviving isnt the goal of survivor, it's to either be productive with the time or create time for your team to be productive. Survival is just one category out of 4.
---
That sub is garbage
---
Omg I had no idea
---
&gt;First killer mains complain that survivors can just power through it
---
Wrong. People says they goes fast even with ruin since if you are even just decent, you can hit skill checks with ruin no problem and not even feel it. Like me and many others do, just ignore ruin altogether
---
&gt;and now they're complaining that it's necessary...so which is it?
---
Both. Some people, like this smartass op, cannot hit skill checks even if it's the only thing you do as a survivor, which buy at least 30s from this kind of people. Time is the most precious resource killer have and even if it sound abysmal, 30s are 1/3 of a gen
---
I guess you don't play both sides consistently if you say such nonsense
---
Next tier of challenges unlocks. So yeah, battle pass is involved (you can still unlock less attractive rewards without it, though).
---
I agree.  
---
It made more sense but it did promote the abuse of lame mechanics (Camping, Tunneling, Noed) and rewarded you for using them.
---
But the system we got now is shit aswell.  
---
Survivors played dogshit? You played really well? Got 4K? They didn't touch a gen because you got them that fast?  
---
Not enough chase/hook points. Depip.
---
My point was some cocky (I won't say survivor mains) people with an "all killer players are crybabies" mindset trying to say that killers are actually overperforming on red ranks because they achieve more than the given 2K goal, even though that's the only possibility to stay within red ranks.  
---
If you don't get atleast 3+ kills most of your matches, you won't be in the red ranks, thus you won't be showed in these stats.
---
"Shes not uncounterable you're just bad"
---
"Here's a good video that explains how she's uncounterable"
---
"I didnt ask lol, your just bad learn to play"
---
From the other players' perspectives there literally no difference between intentional or unintentional disconnects so I don't see any reason why it should be treated differently.
---
I would try to fix my connection issues if I were you. One thing people overlook if they have access to their router is whether or not its channel is set to receive the least amount of interference.
---
If you have a PS4 slim, it will connect to 5ghz routers. 5ghz is better than 2.4ghz becuase a whole bunch of things cause interference at 2.4ghz. 5ghz also has a lot more channels that don't overlap with each other.
---
The best solution is to run cable. Otherwise, set your wifi to the correct channel for your immediate area... the least used channel that doesn't overlap with another. There are plenty of wifi analyzers out there that can tell you how many networks nearby are using each channel.

I‚Äôm perfectly fine with not getting the hatch although it is annoying when the killer does not hook you and instead walks around to look for it just to shake his head no and hooks and closes it.
---
It's funny you accuse me of making assumptions, when you're entire point here is to assume that every GG you see is basically an insult. Am I wrong about that?

Games that are designed to be long drawn out stalemates by "3 genning" with all gens still up.  Fuuuuuuuuun times man.  Those games are cancer.  I've played scummy Trappers that have done this on Azarovs with the intent on creating 30 minute games.  Not the most considerate playstyle.

This is already a thing, nothing is going to stop killers from using strong perks/addons.
---
&gt;Also if you try to balance the game arround a 2 escape 2 kills scenario it would mean massive nerfs to killers.
---
That's what the devs want, yes that means nerfing killers, that's the point.
---
&gt;If we look at the red rank kill stats
---
Red ranks are are averaging a 70% kill rate, that blows the stated balance goal out of the water and is unbalanced as hell.  Red ranks are also the smallest subset of players and I don't think the game should be balanced around it.
---
&gt;If you get less than 3Ks you'll depip and not stay in red ranks.
---
Again, this is an inherent problem with the pip system.  2k should be enough for a pip on killers, that is in line with the dev's expectations.
---
&gt;Killers can't perform bad in red ranks. Because if they would perform bad in red ranks, they couldn't and wouldn't be in red ranks.
---
Isn't that the point of having ranks in the first place?  Only the best stay at the top.
---
&gt;Also killing 3-4 ppl isn't the killer "overperforming"
---
It does, devs want a 50% kill rate/game, right now it's far exceeding that.
---
&gt;What the stats are good at is showing how often killers tend to get picked in these ranks.
---
It's also showing their kill rates, you can't overlook that.  Yeah, there's a lot that goes in to a kill, but at all ranks killers are surpassing that 50% margin.
---
How do those masks work? Lol jk
---
Uff would be nice but hard to coordinate
---
I think a big issue was that unlike the DBD devs, the DG devs kept on listening to the bitching of Hunter mains and added buff after buff until it was almost impossible to escape a chase. If they hadn't taken away the instant execution feature, I would've stopped playing, but even with that taken away it was still super frustrating.
---
Honestly a useless perk. The idea is cool but its just not enough.
---
Reminds me of scooby doo monsters it‚Äôs a cool design
---
Now I wanna see clips of KYF groups just fucking around doing this shit.
---
You don't really need Trapper I've found, I've done it with Myers and it still seems pretty good.
---
Nurse is still the strongest killer in the game. All her rework is was punish bad players, a good nurse should still be able to get downs with almost the same efficiency as before.
---
Haha
---
Never noticed spirit‚Äôs fucked up big toe on one of her feet till now.
---
Been happening too on PC.
---
Run as survivor... whoops you didnt really run go back 16 spaces. Its awful when it happens near a vault cause it means the kilelr gets one or even 2 free hits, but when it happens running plain it might also confuse the killer as to where the fuck did you vanished to.
---
As killer... you suddently are chasing a survivor then he just houdini's out of existance and you wonder if somehow the survivor played you like a fiddle or if your eyes jsut fucked off to Narnia. Then other times you hit survivors throu a window who was half way to Kansas. 
---
Its freaking wild
---
Entity says it‚Äôs my turn on the trial
---
Time to stock up on burritos, Small Game and Inner Strength.
---
I dunno what to say to this, casually play the game and ignore other players?
---
Wow so you wanna make ruin worthless. That's it. Just because **you** cannot hit skill checks, which is easy by itself if you're decent
---
Make it like you suggested would make ruin the next monstrous shrine. 5 hit and no more ruin, wow.. especially when toolboxes exist, provethyself exist and gens are done in 80s. Is thanks people like **you** that ruin is mandatory. At least buy some time, many times it get destroyed in the first 30s
---
I would gladly take out ruin, an hex that can be destroyed in 15s and can spawn right next to survivors or the closest gen/jungle gym. But games lasts 5mins if I take it out, especially in big ass maps.
---
I recommend you to play consistently both sides since you just sound delusional by proposing that. Play survivor **and** killer at rank one and tell me how it goes (if you reach it ofc)
---
Punished for playing something the developers want you to play and possibly spend money on
---
Good logic /s
---
&gt; unhook 2 survivors during endgame
---
Fuck.
---
I think the issue is that, overall, excluding red ranks, the kill percentages are very high. If you noticed from the stats, red ranks actually were only five to ten percent higher than all ranks, which is concerning considering the devs set their mark for balance at 50%. Even 50% is a lot‚Äîthat‚Äôs two players who didn‚Äôt win. When all four players escape, only one person loses, which is the killer. Not justifying nor advocating for the position, just explaining where I believe people are coming from.
---
You can do it with anybody.  Trapper and Doc just happen to be the best at it but it's a bad strat.  The games take FOREVER.  This makes the bloodpoint gain dogshit since as a killer on average I could enter and win 2 games for the length it takes you to win 1 game with this strategy.  Also I'm not causing 5 people to have no fun so that's a bonus win.
---
Ooooor you can check the ping and decide to leave or not
---
That's like every game I play as Hag.
---
Pretty much. A downside I myself did not recognize.
---
It's not nonsense. Just the truth. Both sides are huge crybabies and the game is suffering because the devs try to cater.
---
this subreddit would have literally no content if that was the case. this isn't some vast, complicated game
---
See, at least someone isn't denying video evidence. Thanks man.
---
Doctor and LF can be really good 3 gens
---
If you wanna run some KYF games to practice, I and I‚Äôm sure some other folks would be happy to play a few rounds to help you memorize blink distances and stuff and not be toxic/mean.
---
Why should I rely on addons for a good killer? I want addons to change them up not make them good.
---
...for how long have you been on reddit? because im pretty sure every redditor takes reposts seriously
---
You can combine this with the perma tier 3 addon so you stay in tier 3.
---
Why should someone get punished for looping the killer? Karma has nothing to do with that.
---
Reminder that three gen strat exists, someone else brought it up and it made me realize this would be very difficult if not impossible to do a gen if the killer has this perk during three gen strat.
---
He really is still pretty fun. Playing 4D chess with trap placements is one of the most fun things in the game, shame you have to rush to get a kill fast to actually have enough time to start having fun with his gameplay.
---
According to the recent status BHVR gave us, there;s only *one* underperforming killer. So that's now a moot point.
---
I really like the art they're doing with these, have they always been doing it and I just now noticed or is this a new thing?
---
If I am ever lonely, I play this game. I am sure to get human interaction even if it is just salty people bitching at me for all kinds of shit.
---
but why would you count on your games being against survivors who aren't the best you won't improve that way
---
HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO SOME KILLER ADEPT ACHIEVEMENTS?! LIKE FOR SURVIVOR IT'S LIKE "LOL JUST ESCAPE" BUT FOR KILLER YOU HAVE TO GET MERCILESS WHICH IS SOMETIMES HARD EVEN WITH A META BUILD. WHAT THE SHIT.
---
This is wholesome
---
Agreed, at most he just needs some new options for add-ons.
---
Myers was bullied for too long
---
We're not bad
---
I'm still pretty damn awful in chases unless it's a brand new killer. I can sometimes 360, and exhaustion perks are amazing. I highly suggest getting Feng mins alert perk!! It's amazing for keeping tabs on the killer and tells you if they're heading your way.
---
Someone please explain
---
Not funny, didn‚Äôt laugh.
---
Does she other dead hard or balanced?
---
Where are the stand still mind games - a spirit
---
If you also make it so that you don‚Äôt leave scratch marks it would be good
---
You know it can be said for anyone? Literally anyone. Survivors included ofc
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
Emilia is adorable &lt;3
---
Technician is good where it‚Äôs at it‚Äôs a training perk that‚Äôs all it is
---
I mean statistics aren't supposed to show how "the best against the best" are doing, they're supposed to show what's really happening ingame, and full SWF is not representative of that experience.
---
I mean I somehow get it. BHVR most likely designed him first back in the day and they had all these ideas on how to counter the big bad killer. So they coded all these downsides in (Trapper is even one of the very few killers whose power is directly affected by luck. Or another good example is that - as far as I know - he is the only case in which survivors can bring a common item to *permanently* diminish his power).    
---
But they quickly moved away from this "interactivity" with all the other killers and now I feel the trapper is in need of rework.
---
If I find hatch on the way to the hook then entity clearly wants you alive.
---
Other than that you'd better pray for a DC if you want mercy.
---
FRIGGIN HATE WHEN YOU (FOR SOME REASON) DISCONNECT MID GAME.
---
I'm a spirit main myself so that's not completely without self-interest lohl
---
I lean, rock, and sometimes even jump when hooking a survivor. I feel stupid doing it but it's a subconscious movement now and I just can't help it.
---
Nobody‚Äôs gonna mention how accurate that wraith costume is? That‚Äôs OP
---
&gt;I think that the game dying because someone refuses to play anything but broken killers is a bit excessive.
---
Please leave and don't come back if you don't like the game
---
It's growing and the statement "the game is dying" is just a lie. 
---
Dw we won't miss you
---
still why would you count on your games being against survivors who arent the best?
---
If the killer gets a 4k in under 3 mins.....that is a you problem tbh.
---
OOOR, that's why you play two totem perks on spirit. It's still 33% chance survivors always gonna clean a good totem.
---
Claudette OP, nerf when?
---
NO CUNT, IT'S TRADITIONAL IN AMERICA, OUR NEXT HOLIDAY WILL BE CHRISTMAS!
---
Not a fun game. HATE IT when no one on my team does any gens while they camp!!! Like ffs, I'm going to die, go escape! Every camper I've gotten ( high rank so not a ton ) my team has all gathered nearby to try and help and we've lost
---
No one really says this
---
no scratch marks or blood for 180 seconds? fuck no. that's just broken
---
No joke though I felt bad for him because I looped him for WAY to long without dropping a single pallet because he predictably tried to stalk me thinking I was gonna drop a pallet. I main huntress as killer so I have the mindset of not dropping pallets early against those types of killers
---
Learn to loop man.  For the sake of your teamates just learn how to loop.  Being injured isn't a big deal once you can hold your own in a chase.  Feeding this chick her machine gun all game isn't the answer.
---
Last time they released stats 50% of survs were solo. About 5% were 4 man SWF. Dont remember the numbers for 2 and 3 man but it followed the trend. (Smaller percentage 3 than 2)
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Its probably you that basement camps
---
All you have to do is be cautious when going for save. You can hear his Chainsaw faintly, even if he's below in the basement. Just assume a Leatherface has Insidious.
---
Did you read it?
---
Yes please
---
I mained Clown for majority of my time on DBD. His base amount of bottles is fine. The slow when he releases does need to be removed (completely counter intuitive.) His reload speed needs a buff also. The secondary ability you added is a bit much but he does need more in his kit. He lacks any kind of map pressure and his power just makes people throw pallets early, therefore he has no chance to capitalize on survivor mistakes. It turns his power against him as survivors play safe and remove any kind of mind game potential (this is death on Autohaven maps due to the amount of pallets.) He does need a secondary ability as you pointed out, what that could be I'm not sure. One thing that will help in the meantime is removing his redstain for intoxicated survivors. This will at least give him some mind game potential at some unsafe pallets.
---
&gt; after seeing the second guy get downed in one hit, you should know not to go for the save
---
You'd think that'd be common sense. But I've had many team's get 3k by this and I just get hatch.
---
It would be nice and could give us something more interesting to look at then reddit while loading. However like you said it is low priority than getting more game stability, chapters etc.
---
Nothing about my post suggests I‚Äôm a baby or having a hard time. You‚Äôre simply trying to pick a fight and failing at it. The fact that you went through my post history shows how boring/sad your life is.
---
"instant" 10+ minute queues aren't instant
---
üòÇ This game can be crazy
---
make one for Ash instead.
---
WHERE IS THE F'N NEW ARCHIVE LEVEL? I NEED MORE CHALLENGES!
---
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST I WOULD HAVE SCREAMED.
---
He‚Äôs pretty much saying ‚Äúif someone throws a pallet down to body block you into the killer, reveals where you are to the killer by opening your locker, then the killer should tunnel and mori the person sandbagging.‚Äù I agree, but if I have to choose between getting 1 kill for a sandbagged, or a 3k because he made it easy, I‚Äôm going for the 3k, hopefully with that person included. Might give the hatch to the last person if there‚Äôs a DC, or they get nothing done.
---
My guess is he‚Äôs telling killers not to punish the survivor that gets farmed and go for the other one instead because it‚Äôs not fun.
---
That's what I'm saying lol
---
survivors queues are the instant ones
---
Yeah it‚Äôs literally the best cosmetics I‚Äôve seen also I don‚Äôt get why they don‚Äôt just make option to take the hood off and on it surely couldn‚Äôt be that hard to do since they now have a huge amount of money from stranger things dlc and also seem to improved a lot more with character design and clothing.
---
Nooooooo all i want is to reduce noise he make when he run because with undetectable, its useless because i can hear him from so far.
---
I agree
---
Altruism is an addictive drug...
---
^if you know what I mean
---
The same thing happened to me the other day. Four Time‚Äôs Up! kills made a failed game successful.
---
I do this all the time when someone is nice and I always hope that people say it back when I give them hatch. I love salty messages but wholesomeness is even better.
---
Sometimes fun outweighs bloodpoints. Just because you aren‚Äôt having fun doesn‚Äôt mean the killer isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not a bad strategy. It‚Äôs a good strategy that you don‚Äôt like. That‚Äôs an opinion not a fact. There is a DC option for a reason. If you don‚Äôt like it then quit.
---
THAT POOR BB KILLER. YOUR POOR, BORED TEAM. WHY DBD, FUCKING WHY?!
---
They did it for Jane and the Plague. But we only had licensed releases since then. Maybe they will only do it for original characters?
---
can i use this as a copypasta
---
or maybe, and bear with me here, they're DISCUSSING the game on a DISCUSSION board. isn't that what a subreddit is for? isn't that what the comments are for?
---
but in your narrow scope of view, anyone who disagrees needs to "fucking go outside".
---
Well, if you need a real explanation, killer's FOV can't see right under them when they look straight, and some tall killers can't see under them even if they look down. That's why "sitting at killer's legs" trick works sometimes.
---
Are.....are you saying there shouldn‚Äôt be a leave game button? So if someone has to suddenly go somewhere, they just have to kill the program from task manager or shut the computer down?
---
I don't count on anything mate I just play the hand that is dealt to me.
---
TODAY I GOT HOOKED AND WATCHED ALL 3 OF MY TEAMMATES SELF HEAL THEMSELVES, ALL WHILE THEY COULD SEE THE LOCATION OF EACH OTHER. NO ONE EVER CAME FOR ME.
---
I'm rank 15 and don't get paired with many 20s. Queue is 5 mins or lesz
---
fucking lol
---
yeah i guess you can act like they're just "discussing" a game and not having a fucking novel length meltdown because sometimes people tbag
---
His traps respawn after 3 minutes unless you have hangman‚Äôs trick which ya know isn‚Äôt the best use of a perk slot. It used to be permanently destroyed though before they changed it. I mean it‚Äôs one thing to have all these downsides when the game first released but he has had these same problems for over 3 years now. 
---
I don‚Äôt think a rework is necessary because they already have the code in the game to alleviate some of these issues. A rework on how survivors escape his traps would be nice actually
---
My high priestess of Babylon looking amazing as always
---
Exactly
---
[They did it for Ghost Face too, actually.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/68637/lore-the-ghost-face)

i think they said on another stream they have a plan on how to do it if I remember correctly
---
&gt;WOULD OF
---
Goddamnit I'm not even native English speaker and this annoys me to ludicrous extent
---
Ok, ok
---
Your right. Im bad in english.
---
Busted 3 pairs of cheeks and turned them into manginas. Let the last screwed survivor farm his challenge and dropped him near hatch. It felt.....good. It felt...right.
---
I never do this....what's happening to me Entity?!
---
Happened to me multiple times. I'm spamming attack button now when I try to grab somebody. Grab is broken on dedicated servers.

you really don't think this community isn't shit? you're literally exhibiting the behavior that OP is talking about. 
---
i'd bet a month's wages i could sift through your post history and see a ton of examples of you shitting on people instead of discussing the topic at hand. thankfully i don't have the time or energy to waste on such rubbish.
---
I seem to run into some of the same people often at high ranks but lobbies seem to take around 20 seconds to 3 minutes.
---
But I'm in Midwestern United States so the playerbase may differ in your location.
---
Yes. You're right with the keys. Actually didn't think about that. I still stand by my point that they should be more rare. 
---
They should rework the rng. But the way it is right now is still not unfair to either side since it can fuck both sides over.
---
If you don't play with meta perks you still can win. It's just gonna be more challenging. So if you want an easier experience, you'll have to play with meta perks. If you want some change then it'll be more challenging which can be refreshing also.

I don't know what else to tell you. Don't ever go into a Bubba's basement unless you know for a fact he's far away. It's simple.

I don't know if he'll be eligible next Halloween but my god they could probably make such a cool outfit for him.

Leaked new killer entrance, angel confirmed as new killer.

There is already an extremely loud notification that he has traveled through a portal. Seems like his footsteps don't need to be so loud.
---
Probably never lol
---
He does actually show mercy in this film though there's a scean where he is in a house with a girl who is watching the thing he just leaves her alone.
---
Thanks for posting this. So much insight
---
Rant?
---
you have no idea how toxic i am buddy and no one said otherwise. but all the shit he is sitting and crying about has literally always existed and regardless of anything else, writing this massive post instead of just ignoring people and playing how he wants is not healthy. it's insane. either stop playing or keep playing and ignore everyone. it doesn't fucking matter
---
holy shit this forum takes this epic vidya way too seriously
---
It's more like a wormhole. I don't think it's considered teleporting.
---
Ah, she does seem the bold type. As the saying goes, fortune favors the head on user.......or something like that.
---
Learn to play better possibly applies to SWFs but solo queue, which is the predominant mode of survivor gameplay by a large margin, relies less on team work and probably luck. I think survivors see a win as an individual escape rather than a group escape, which is strange because that dynamic can frustrate the assymetry because now, instead of one team winning and the other losing, there are now four potential losses on the survivor side versus one on the killer aide.
---
Probably like 7-12pm EST. Rank really determines your queue times though. As a green rank killer queues are very quick no matter the time of day right now. Purple rank survivor is a very different story. If you're in brown to yellow just try to get to green and it will be much faster.
---
can someone post the challenges?
---
I do that sometimes too
---
It would be cool if they added at least one of these for Yuri as it would fit her and give her a cute outfit.
---
I instantly find games as killer and wait ages for survivor, maybe it's a regional thing?

---
IF YOU EXPECT A INJURED SURV GO TO SAVE A PLAYER WITHOUT BT/DS IN THE BASEMENT WHILE YOU 2 ARE HEALED, DONT CRY THAT I DONT GO TO SAVE TOU WHEN YOU'RE DOWNED, OH AND ENJOY YOUR BAN FOR HELPING THE KILLER TO FIND ME BECAUSE YOU EXPECT ME TO DO SOMETHING
---
Yeah but im the guy who's trying to save everyone. So i try everything and i still save people. But i feel bad for the one that nobody will save so im thinking. But its not every game that will work like this.
---
Yep. Although Dead Hard is highly flexible and can help you at least loop a Killer one more time, I find myself using Sprint Burst way more often.
---
If your idea of fun is ruining the fun of 4 others for 30 minutes I think you need to take a long hard look at yourself.  
---
Again it isn't a good strategy for the reason put forward.  "Good Strategies" don't double to triple the average game length time.  Its horrific time consumption and inefficiency as result automatically removes this from the "good strategy" discussion.  
---
Lol!  Recommending Disconnects.  God damn that's trash dude.  Seriously weak.  But then again players that play to hold games hostage for 30 mins plus probably see those as a positive anyway.  Helps extend the duration of their troll boners.
---
THAT'S CALLED "THE DOUBLE BLIND ARCHIVE CHALLENGE." SINCE ANY COMPETENT KILLER CAN EASILY EVADE FLASHLIGHTS EXCEPT AT PALLETS, IT'S BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET WITHOUT PLAYING LIKE A TOXIC CUNT WHILE WASTING EVERY PALLET YOU CAN FIND. DON'T BLAME JAKE, BLAME BHVR. EVERY TIME A NEW TOME COMES OUT, EVERYONE IN SOLO QUEUE IS FUCKED FOR LIKE 3 WEEKS WHILE EVERYONE THROWS GAMES BECAUSE THEY'RE FOCUSED ON ARCHIVE CHALLENGES THAT DON'T ACTUALLY BENEFIT THE TEAM ANY.

I mean what? They are perfectly good Killer, so much so most people don't run the Spirit Fury + Enduring combo on them because they can afford to not have it due to how good their lunge is. plus the way STBFL works so utterly perfect on them is just disgusting.

if they change one thing on then it'd be their loud ass foot steps, they're a little silly.

I fill them all out, so I start survivor, then go killer when it pisses me off.
---
Basically be in a swf lobby make it to the end and tell your friend to get hooked have borrowed time take a hit for them pray you escape then tell another person to get hooked. Rinse and repeat. Seems honestly very situational and risky. Especially if you're in a higher ranked lobby.
---
It isn't just you
---
And hope that YOURE the person to unhook them.
---
Although it‚Äôs scummy I plan on taking a key with Left Behind and just biding my time until the team is dead and the hatch has spawned. Easiest way to get it done.
---
You don't, the devs are too stupid to realize it. Just farm with the killer.
---
I don't think I'm gonna complete this anytime soon. Some are stupidly hard.
---
Not even gonna bother with these tbh.
---
They nhave 100% played MW2
---
The challenges should be more like "Do that and don't use these meta perks"
---
I cannot stop laughing at this
---
I swear, sometimes it‚Äôs like BHVR doesn‚Äôt know how their own game works. It‚Äôs the same shit with some of the achievements in this game too, they outright require farming otherwise most people are going to be attempting them until the day they die. A lot of these are just too situational to get naturally in a game. 
---
For example: unhook 2 survivors in Endgame. This is isn‚Äôt even in the player attempting the challenge‚Äôs hands. If the killer doesn‚Äôt hook anyone during Endgame then you just wasted a game because you can‚Äôt get it. Shit like that that is completely out of the attempting player‚Äôs hands need to stop being put in this game. They are frustrating, not rewarding.
---
Just a few ideas for secondary abilities/additional gas effects:
---
Pallets dropped in gas clouds break automatically after 10 seconds.
---
Press secondary power button to attach a gas bottle to a generator. The next time survivor starts working on this gen, the bottle explodes and decreases the repair speed of affected survivors by 20% for 20 seconds.
---
Press secondary power button near a dying survivor to poison him with special muscle relaxants. Next time this survivor will be unhooked, he would be unable to interact with any objects except windows and pallets for 60 seconds. 
---
Survivors that remain in a gas cloud for more than 6 seconds will starts coughing and their total slowdown will be 25%. This effect would persist for an extra 3 seconds.
---
Not entirely. It just means that, that particular survivor just has to take a hit and stun her at a pallet instead.
---
no u
---
Low ranks you mean. I never play enough to even get below rank 10 and with the new system you can derank all the way to like rank 17 lmao.
---
I agree that it's mostly a non-issue. They might think people backing out of lobbies is a priority, though.
---
I just stay at rank 15. I get my 4 bbq hooks, max my deviousness, max my hunting, then just let them all go. If I get a toxic team I go try hard with a farm build. It's been going good so far.
---
As for solo survivor man that shit is rough. So much bullshit. I can see why ppl play swf.
---
 Teleportation is instantaneous. Thus I‚Äôd say Demo doesn‚Äôt qualify. Hag and Freddy are the ones who really teleport.
---
Fucking hell that egc 2 unhook is insane. I doubt I'll get any killers to help with my shit luck
---
That is limited, doesn't work in high wall loops, globally alerts survivors, has no tracking properties, has no linger effect on objects, and is easily canceled.
---
AFK Key Andy playstyle incoming.
---
Everytime this subject appears I also say we need more OC characters, my biggest complaint is about cosmetics and lore, BHVR have more freedom with OC, and they should be majority in the game.
---
I know but, on a David. Not expected.
---
Upvote so BHVR sees!
---
You did a pretty good job so far
---
"Also those stats are missing a lot more data to draw any realistic conclusion about the actual performance of killers across all ranks."
---
- I'm pretty darn sure one realistic conclusion is that going into a match as a survivor means you have less than 50% chance of winning across all ranks. Those aren't very good odds. 
---
"That doesn‚Äôt show any DC‚Äôs"
---
- It was stated elseware that games with DC games weren't included in these findings. 
---
"game length, chase time, gen completion speed, number of hooks to kill ratio, slugging, hatch escapes, pip to kill ratio, perk usage or anything else relevant."
---
- None of which matters. It's a kill rate, aka: survivor loss. 
---
- I think it's hilarious that killer mains are trying to excuse this whole ordeal, as though they just weren't given proof that the game DOES actually favor killers. Had the kill rates been lower than 50%, killer mains would have been up in arms about how they were just given proof that the game wasn't in their favor, but since that's not the case, all we get are excuses, and demands for any stat that they HOPE would prove otherwise. A wonderful example of cognitive dissonance.
---
It a good idea but he need something more. I think his power is to much predictible
---
Ah I forgot! Thanks for bringing it up.

It's pretty clutch when you want to squeeze out a little more time on objectives and also allows you to get to safe tiles from unsafe gens in a hurry.
---
Not just that, you *also* have to hope your teammates don't do the unhooks. This challenge is ridiculous.
---
I can vouch for this!
---
Speaking as a Plague player, I honestly want you not to cleanse. It makes it a lot easier on me.
---
I like how you kept taking weird ass paths bc of sheer panic lol
---
No my bf likes ro record me fucking playing and doing this and i get real into it too
---
Thats me right now I got him yesterday during the sales...First game 4K  
---
2nd game gen rushed and t-bagged by 3 red ranks while I'm level 10 :(
---
i honestly regret buying the pass after the level 4 ones got leaked. this challenge is not gonna be fun and there's more to come.
---
Problem isn't with gens, problem is with BHVR. They made this game with no idea that it would blow up to this size, and with the intention for it to be scary to play. They didnt design it at it's core to be something to master for extremely high levels of play, and refuse to do so now. Now, with many perks in the game being gen oriented, the chances of them even making a second game mode are so low its sad. If they were to rework gens, they would more than likely need to rework these perks, or at the very least recode all of them. Whats probably going to happen is they are going to keep pumping out new killers and survivors with ever decreasing powers and skills until the game dies. Literally the last 3 killers, Oni, Demagorgon, Ghostface, have literally been just a combo of past powers.
---
It is, forgot to mention that
---
It's the "glass bead" map add-on. 
---
Start reading the map, even for a split second, and press your skillcheck key (default space) and it will place the beacon.
---
I use it to tell people where they can go for heals, marking totems, generators, hatches, some occasions pallets, and when the killer starts a chase on me I spam it for a couple of seconds so people know.
---
Most underrated and unused add-on probably, but I love it.
---
His
---
At first I thought you were talking about how oblivious survivors can see you even when in chase (making the perk a hard counter to freddy and the new nemesis perk). 
---
as others have said,  object becomes like spinechill when you are undedectable, it will light up when they are looking in your direction, and you can see their aura, but all aura based parts of perks (except kindred) for the survivors are denied.
---
I KNOW ITS THE 27TH YOU STUPID SON OF A GUN, BUT ITS ALREADY 6PM HERE AND THE DAY IS ALMOST OVER.
---
And this is just level 3... Level 4 challenges are just completely dumb. 
---
Makes you feel like the devs don't play the same game.
---
It bothers me because the difficulty won't makes us progress in their already big time consuming rift levels. But also because it will encourage weird/toxic behavior and gameplay from both side to actually complete the objectives.  
---
I think in level 4, there's a killer challenge to kill every survivor in the basement. Okay, great. We'll have to endure big basement camping, it sure looks fun to do and to go against.
---
There's literally thousands ideas for great and fun challenge, yet they decide this...
---
Yo holy shit, post this somewhere where its gonna gain traction. I think you fixed swf
---
Challenges should be fun, most of these are just a boring slog and cause shitty gameplay.
---
It's not impossible, but rare. I've probably only done it 3 or 4 times since EGC was introduced, and I play almost every day. One of those times was definitely in a SWF.
---
That happened when I first started playing killer
---
Dammmmmn this sucks
---
I‚Äôll take the few minutes of chilling on my phone over the ten minutes of sweating against prayer beads any day tbh
---
Any killer can camp basement with insidious
---
I'm going basement bubba for that one actually. Don't forget the NOED challenge.
---
yep. They really screwed us with the 'within one trial' challenges. Most are complete crap.
---
The normal challenges are somewhat okay but will definitely feel too grindy. 40 generators or pallets? yeah it will get done but it'll feel grindy as hell and so will all the other challenges with unhooking, healing etc.
---
Sometimes when I play survivor, I get into a chase with the killer and then when the chase is over there's been 3 gens popped, the killer then insta downs someone else in a chase... Twice. I end up getting everyone else out but I wait at the exit gates and just constantly point at the hook because I felt bad they didn't get a kill all because of my stupid ass or an infinite loop.
---
Killer sometimes kills me, sometimes swipes at the actual gate. If they kill me then they thank me in the endgame chat and I tell them that they played pretty good. If they let me go, it's usually because I played pretty well and they wanted me to get out.
---
There was a time when the game translated both the wraith and the spirit as ‚ÄúThe spirit‚Äù
---
So we just started calling Spirit ‚ÄúSpirit‚Äù and wraith as ‚Äúthe bell guy‚Äù
---
You take shit to seriously. This is clearly a post how much easier killer is. 
---
Nerd.
---
Ain't got friends to do this, guess i aint getting past this tome
---
how would killers even know if you were running a key with that exact add-on?
---
I am saying endure it we all have too you just DCing is gonna throw all ur teams chances into a pit even if it looked like it already was over
---
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MY GOOD FRIEND AGITATION TRAPPER. FIND THAT BASEMENT AND BEAR TRAP ALL AROUND THAT SHIT. SURVIVORS PRACTICALLY CLIMB ONTO THE BASEMENT HOOKS TRYING TO SAVE ONE ANOTHER.
---
I will offering myself to be hooked during EGC for the next few weeks unless I have an escape challenge active. Good luck everyone.
---
I think it is clear to say that they will need to really consider how they do challenges going forward for the next "rift" after this one has ended. They can't really afford to keep making challenges like this and expect the community to stop talking about it.
---
i don't think they're too hard but i do think they take too much time. the ones i have an issue with are the extremely tedious ones like "unhook 25 survivors" and "break 40 pallets/generators"
---
it wouldn't be too bad if you could do multiple at once
---
May I ask how the hell you've only found 3 keys in your entire time playing? I get them almost every bloodweb and I always skip over them.
---
FUCK PEOPLE WHO DC, WHATEVER YOUR REASON IS, YOU‚ÄôRE STILL AN ASSHOLE
---
Which is far more than the stats showed here. I don't know why I'm getting downvoted.
---
Alright, I see some misinformation here, so let me correct you guys ~~like the nerd I am~~ before someone wastes strong add-ons (rly, I don't want to sound rude or anything like that, I just want to stop the wrong info from spreading)
---
\-There are 2 add-ons that let mori people while in EW3: Tombstone Piece (a purple one) and Judith's Tombstone (pink/ultra rare one). The main differences are that the ultra rare add-on reduces your movement speed and doesn't force you out of EW3 when killing someone, and a purple one drains the EW progress bar a bit and reverts you to EW2 after a mori.
---
\-The "perma tier 3" (that is, Fragrant Tuft Of Hair) add-on technically only stops the passive drain of EW, so killing someone with a Tombstone Piece *will* take you back to EW2 with, like, half the progress bar. Pairing it with an ultra rare Tombstone, however, will let you stay in EW3 for the rest of the game and mori everyone in your way.
---
\-To mori someone as Myers, you need to be pretty much in the grab range and the survivor can't be in the dying state; if you're too far you might swing your knife instead, down the guy and not be able to mori him.
---

---
**I don't intend this to be a real suggestion of a killer.**
---
I just wanted for it be a thing and made it into a thing, even tho it was an interesting process, trying to sort out what aspects of her could actually be translated into game mechanics, her being a character that is somewhat underdeveloped in her own history so far.
---
By the end, I explored her desire for blood which is one of her main traits, as long as the corrupted perception of love she has as the basis for her perks as anything else would end up coming from somewhere too abstract.
---
The worse part was trying to think out her power, as I am both aware that BHVR would never do a disguise killer, but also felt like it needed to be somewhat balanced and that is what I came up with, she would be able to disguise but would rely on perks/add-ons to lose her terror radius, but in return she can deny info for the survivors (hey wont see their fellows going down), she would lose her red stain, but would only be as fast as a survivor (?), see this is where one of my biggest problems trying to make a fan killer comes in... Idon't know how to balance these type of stuff.
---
I couldn't even bring myself to guess what her base mov. speed and terror radius would be for fear of making it sound too unbalanced, I want it to be fun and new, but also want it to feel fair, and as a casual player, II don't just dont know enough about the game to be able to think a way out of it, as much as I would love to keep tweaking and changing it to feel less of nuisance I wouldn't know how to.
---
At least I think I did a less bad of a job with the perks as, at least in concept they could be interesting ways to change the game mechanics (Yes, they are gimmicky, but I like gimmicky perks okay? ~~Boiled over so underrated~~), even if the numbers are off by a mile, which is very likely given my knowledge of the game.
---
I hope you can enjoy even a bit of what II hope did, and I will take criticism gladly, but I would ask you to remember that this is just fan content and not a real suggestion, I apologize for any spelling and grammar errors as English is not my main language
---
Good day Y'all
---
**And as I was writing this I noticed a mistake:** The cooldown on *Compassionate Desire* is 90 SECONDS, not MINUTES (you could probably figure it out, but who knows)
---
Honestly I had the most fun with tier 1 challenges. They gave me alternate objectives without feeling grindy. I even lost a game or two, but got my challenge done, and as a result felt okay because I had made progress.
---
Tier 2 challenges were just about as easy but lord were they grindy. I would throw games trying to immediately find the killer so I could drop pallets in a chase, or intentionally walk as close as I could to the basement even though I knew they would wiggle free in some vain attempt to just get them closer to try again.
---
Grind and chance encounters like unhooking someone who already unhooked you is not fun or engaging, and it actively ruins the game for everyone.
---
I managed that exactly once about a month or two ago. Had BT and a shitty nurse with NOED that hooked both other survivors, I was the last one left. Unhooked the first and second one with BT, I got killed but they escaped.
---
Since I already did that I am sure that this will never happen to me again. I will never complete that challenge unless the killer lets us farm.
---
what? what are you even saying right now? it's like you couldn't actually form a counter argument to me calling out your blatantly false claim and had to resort to whatever the fuck that was
---
Freddy is right in the middle, you can be good with him or you can be bad with him
---
Hew mewher to the heud
---
Says the survivor main assclown who bangs out gens in 4 minutes, leaves, then depips.
---
*indiscernable pig noises*
---
honestly if I haven‚Äôt been teabagging or using a flashlight and the killer DCs purely bc they couldn‚Äôt catch me for 3 gens I‚Äôm not gonna NOT laugh
---
Thats for the next lesson, this was her first so i didnt go too in depth
---
I think its fine.
---
Can be used as a fuck you spirit build of QNC, Iron will, Dance, Lucky.
---
Mad leatherface noises
---
Translation: "My fun is more important than your fun."
---
Go fuck yourself.
---
Killers already have enough of a disadvantage. 
---
If a survivor just does something as stupid as unhooking them as I took 2 steps away, I will just hit the wounded survivor. It wastes less of my time. If they waited 2 seconds for me to leave, they'd be fine.
---
There's a lot of stupid survivor unhooks. For example, if a survivor unhooks someone, and then hides.. Who do you think I am going to find as the killer?
---
The other one that I just won't chase, is a survivor that is walking away after unhooking, because they obviously have sprint burst. At high ranks, that's a minimum of 30 seconds of chasing just to get a single hit. Why would I bother chasing that? I WILL lose if I chase that. The only way in hell I will ever be that nice to survivors, despite them begging to be tunneled is if I'm playing nurse.
---
That is kind of lame, imo. I also play killer and would never do that, simply because I find it a bit cringey lol. Maybe people are just trying to joke around, but I don't want to drag things out longer than they have to be or rub anything in anyone's face. If I plan on killing someone, I don't give them false hope, I know what it's like to play Survivor and we all just want to move on to our next game haha. No hate towards anyone who does, I just don't personally care for it.
---
And here I thought the Rift was actually going at an ok pace with the tomes but I see that progress is about to slow down immensely. Totally not planned on BHVR's part though.
---
So here's how this is going to go down. The sub bitches about this for about a week, and rightfully so, then BHVR will change the challenges to look like they're listening even though when this shit was leaked, they still chose to release like this!
---
Or, they stay silent about this whole topic, Oni and Yui will distract us and by the end of that honeymoon phase the Rift will be approaching and people will feel forced to pay up.
---
Seriously, fuck this!
---
I'm sure they took the feedback, it just takes 2 years to fully process.
---
ur right he shouldn't defend his hooks when gates are powered and just let you waltz right out. fuggin idiot killers doing the only viable thing at that moment
---
My days I'm so over this.
---
My use of "stopping" survivors do their objectives was a poor term on my part yes, I meant basically makes it difficult for them. I know that's the point but I find there to be a lot of perks that heavily make it difficult, more so than the ones that survivors have to help them make it easier. I know not all killer perks are useful and I never stated that all were.
---
I KNOW wraith has no terror radius when cloaked, i pointed that out to show how he already has a heavy help as it is, and then can have add ons to further have no terror radius when uncloaked and also the add on to silence the bell. I added this in because I was talking about the round I just had. No I didnt lie about having played this game for a long time, you clearly misunderstood what I was saying. I know he isnt a hard killer in general, I brought him up as an example of how killer add ons can take a regular killer and help them so much to become very difficult, and you cant deny its difficult to play an invisible killer who is completely silent when visible also and the only means of knowing they're there is seeing the "invisible" figure which can be an easy miss when planning to another angle to look for them. 
---
Is that all? Because I really cba to explain my opinion to people who dont care to try and understand the perspective of and refuse to believe that someone has a different experience and view than they do.
---
oh my god you coward
---
Lol!  Survivor main asshole?  Barking up the wrong tree my man.  I'm a 50/50 player I don't main either side.  I play both sides objectively and I'm sorry but there is no defending not being an asshole when you set out to create 30 minute stalemates.  Zero consideration or respect for the opponents doing that shit.  I'm not a hypocrite I call out BM and scummy play on both sides and 3 genning from the first second of the game is scummy as shit.  You are creating intentional stalemates.
---
THE COMPANY IS BASED IN CANADA SO YOU'LL LIKELY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL 8 OR 9 SADLY
---
And yes you were rude. Disagree that's fine, but dont try and invalidate my experience and opinion by calling it a shitpost or a meme just because it's different to yours. Have a good day sir.
---
I used to see it more often. Maybe people stopped complaining about it since almost everyone agrees you aren't owed a free escape?
---
1 survivor outside the proper matchmaking ranks... talk about being screwed over.
---
Beautiful!!!!!!
---
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THING TO BE MAD ABOUT. YOU ARE A BRAVE SOUL
---
Huntress is the only killer where I‚Äôll sometimes say ‚Äúwow how did that NOT hit?‚Äù
---
I managed that about 2 months ago against a rank 17 huntress with noed. Will never happen again especially since they are changing the rank reset to not reset rank 1 to rank 10 and instead just reset back one color. I'd have to not play for 3 or more months to be able to get this.
---
I've never had people say this word-for-word, but I've had similar things happen.
---
I once had the last two survivors give up and crouch at my feet when there were still 3 gens to do. I killed them both and then they got mad because "I didn't farm" with them.
---
Just play the game how you want to and don't bother with what other people think.

&gt;I'm not liking the idea of are things like "unhook 25 survivors" and "break 40 pallets/damage gens 40 times" which are tedious as he'll unless you're farming.
---
Those are fine, they come in natural gameplay over time.
---
If I grow my nails out can I teleport?
---
All I can say is...
---
Plague Stick
---
I‚Äôve got 10,000 shards on console and thought about getting spirit since I do not have her but thought about getting franklins just to have. Is it worth picking up?
---
It‚Äôs the same principle as everyone wanting a participation ribbon even though there‚Äôs 3 dead and 0 gens done they want to get the hatch so they can consider it a win.
---
&gt; Honestly I had the most fun with tier 1 challenges. They gave me alternate objectives without feeling grindy
---
i 100% agree with this. i did make it more fun to play, to switch out perks with more situational ones i normally wouldn't roll with. 
---
&gt;Grind and chance encounters like unhooking someone who already unhooked you is not fun or engaging
---
i also agree with you on this one. my wife in i play SWF together, so we were able to get this one easily, but i can imagine solo players are just fucked.
---
So many of those are just going to encourage really shitty behaviour from both sides.
---
I almost never give the hatch, nor receive it.
---
Dude, they are just salty, don't pay much attention to it.
---
Until some asshole with "Small Game" takes all your totems. LOL!
---
Yes he clearly should have just walked to the other side of the map and allowed you to rescue the hooked survivor while the exit gates were powered....
---
The gates are open you can leave or deal with the likely scenario of killer camps as only option to secure a kill.
---
It just feel different when I play scoops ahoy boy over the other survivors
---
Lol!  Not even a little bit.  As a killer I see why this is scummy to do and as a survivor I've played against babykillers who have done this from the first second of the game and played those 30 minute matches.  Don't act like you don't understand what you're doing to the opponents when you pull this shit.  Practice objectivity play both sides.  You biased mains are a complete joke with how unaware and incapable of objective thought you are.  I don't do shit on either side that is designed to ruin the fun of the other.  There is plenty of room to win games without playing like a selfish dick man.
---
If you are still near the cone  hit box you will still get hit
---
For some reason ive never seen this format. It's so good. üòÇ
---
WELL WHAT ABOUT BORROWED TIME? WHAT ABOUT DSTRIKE? WHAT IF THEY ARENT DUMBASSES, BEFAUSE I AM AT RANK 4?
---
It also copied (with BHVR's blessing) the core gameplay loop of DBD. All the other ones are/were their own kind of asymmetrical game.
---
if you're on PC, shoot me a DM. maybe we can work it out
---
It's a valid startegy if the gates are open.
---
I give the hatch sometimes but if you teabagged me during the game or use flaslight 20 times don‚Äôt expect me to give you the hatch.
---
Nice job! I respect someone who can play nurse because I struggle! Seems to be a learning curve haha.
---
At least in my case, I'm not trying to rank up to where games are both harder to find and less enjoyable.
---
If I've downed someone, I know I could have hooked and sacrificed them. I _did_ win. I'm satisfied with my performance, and the loss in bloodpoints doesn't wound my ego. But ranking up too high can have a negative effect on the thing I use to relax.
---
So it costs me nothing to let somebody else get an extra medkit. I already have my BBQ stacks. I'll survive.
---
From what I've seen in the tome if you do the first 2 killer challenges then go left and do the survivor/killer challenge  you can select the  life giver challenge then the all better challenge and you'll finish the tome (get to the epilogue) and avoid the last minute hero challenge.
---
Didn‚Äôt they say something to the effect of ‚ÄúThe Rift can be completed based upon an hour of play each day‚Äù?
---
Even if not, these challenges are crazy and require either sheer luck or a large amount of grinding.
---
I bought the rift pass because I wanted to try it out, but if this is any indication of how tomes are going to work I‚Äôm definitely not going to purchase again.
---
The escape without being hooked without Spine Chill is complete bullshit. 
---
People thought there were immersed players before?! But I doubt it'll be an issue because I don't see anyone progressing that far.
---
Alright dead ass, I don't think it should be this hard to unlock Lore. The BP out put is so fucking low that you get more from playing one game and doing a daily in said game. The Rift tokens you also get is bullshit. I guarantee you by the time people get a game where they unhook two survivors in EGC (something literally is down to chance), they will get enough xp to get more than 5 rift tokens. It takes about 7 games to get 5 tokens at 800 xp each. There aint no way in hell that someone is getting that shit with in 7 games of trying to do it unless they are farming.
---
Lore should be discovered sure, but this isn't the way to do it.
---
In order to get the three entries for Trapper in this level you need to break 40 pallets and generators, catch a survivor in a bear trap 5 times in a single trial (most people I know farmed the last one, and you know damn well thats not changing), Hook 15 people in the basement (at *least* two games, and thats if the survivors are dumb enough to play in the basement all game), have two people hooked in the basement **at the same time** while using the perk monstrous shrine, now I have to use one of the worst killer perks in the game and play like a toxic ass hole camping the basement. Then you have to kill the Obsession 7 times, by any means, that doesnt sound that bad unless you don't have obsession perks, and unless they have one to change the obsession, you are just going to tunnel. Last is probably the most reasonable one in this level, and you just have to prevent gens opening with Unnerving Presence.
---
Those are not even the bad ones mind you.
---
Some of these Heal 4 health states of any survivor in one trial. While I like the idea of forcing players to change the way they play slightly for a challenge, I really don't think that forcing them to stop generator progress and run to survivors to heal them is a good challenge, as it stops the progress of the game.
---
What makes these missions worse is they are not even parallel with other challenges of the same level. Last Minute Hero requires two unhooks during EGC (insanely difficult), the next challenge is Hope Is All We Have, requiring you escape with the perk hope though the exit gate. Once. These both give you 50k BP and 5 Rift Tokens.
---
I genuinely don't think BHVR looks at this shit before sending it out.
---
These challenges are insanely difficult and the rewards are actually ass. The lore is nice, but we can dig in the games files and listen/watch the unlocks anyway.
---
Don't tell me pig got another nerf!
---
You can ‚Äúwin‚Äù in more than one way in this game and people‚Äôs view on it are different therefore there‚Äôs gonna be salt. Also people don‚Äôt like dying
---
I really appreciate that, unfortunately I'm on xbox.
---
Killer track wise, it honestly looks like the road to the end is pretty easy. The challenges that are most difficult (trap 5 survivors in one game) are simply off on their own dead end and do not specifically require to complete the level. Perhaps behavior was not intending for everyone to complete every challenge? Maybe they just need to change the log book entries to the challenges that are like ‚Äúhook 20 survivors‚Äù
---
Thought this perk activates when unhooked but was wrong either way trash perk needs a buff and there aren‚Äôt enough perks that make no scratch marks using this with dance with me or lithe could be okay ig also tunneling is not the best way to play but if you want to be a cunt and only do it go ahead and be shit.
---
I hope they go back and make more for the other characters, maybe when we get to their rifts.  They make great wallpapers.
---
i'm not sure how "hard" it is to perform, more like incredibly situational. you have to make it to the end game, there have to be enough of you to even perform this while also avoiding the killer. 
---
i run Borrowed Time, so yes it is easy to get safe unhooks, but two during the end game collapse? a lot of factors have to be in the right place at the right time
---
Adam‚Äôs whenever they get hooked first
---
You guys are fast...  
---
Read my other comment i explain how it is the least polished part of her as i lack the ability to do balance it properly.  
---
Perhaps if she could break into a dash after coming out of disguise? Or a secondary command that does something else...  
---
Also "He"?
---
I will be upset if they don't address these before/when Oni releases.
---
Even if you have the killer you are still gonna get a splinter
---
Usually in lower ranks queue time is ridiculous but the more you rank up the less time it takes.
---
I think they meant with just regular XP gains from matches, but even then that's 700 matches minimum.
---
/intensifies
---
tunneling is an ezpz 2k get gid
---
Ignore ppl like that. Trying to pick the brain of someone entitled really isn't worth it. 
---
I'll give hatch if the last person deserves it (wasn't toxic, and played well) in my eyes and I know I already got my pip, but that's me. Besides that no killer is obligated to give hatch.
---
Haven't even completed Level 1 yet lol
---
Absolutely yes yes yes. 
---
Oversaturation is a major problem and this sub clearly can't self moderate content
---
and it sucks because it is the second one. if you're a survivor main, good luck with that! i'm going to try to get the killer ones and work around it.
---
Yes, this is mainly what I'm referring to. If you cleanse at a fountain near a completed gen you force her to walk to an area of the map that she normally wouldn't go to. Then she spends time on her corruption to get back to uncompleted gens, plus time searching for someone.
---
Everyone seems to think she is going to insta-down 2 or 3 survivors every time she gets corruption.
---
Lemme guess spirit? Legion?
---
Only thing he can do but still very satisfying to watch
---
That's the one reason why stopped playing this like 2 or 3 months ago I use to play on xbox and would take like 10 mins no matter what time or what day makes no sense
---
Ik It just slightly annoyed me when I saw what splinter it was.
---
They're tedious. The 40 pallets and gens is okay I guess (I mean, how many pallets and gens are you breaking per match?) But the unhook 25 survs one is obnoxious if you're in solo que. If every survivor has this one, they're always going to want to be the unhooker. And all 3 survivors are racing to unhook, then that means there's no one on generators. I usually don't get more than 2 unhooks a match because I like focusing my objective and people usually go for the save.

Send me a DM if on PC and we'll do our best. :)

"You have friends therefore you're lesser than me"
---
To be fair, gates were being opened so there‚Äôs not much else he could do that wouldn‚Äôt be as viable as just parking next to the victim
---
I always get matches instantly
---
So long as it's for a Killer challenge, or if the Killer is going for Adept, I'm cool with getting hooked so they get the 4K. If the game's been intense and we've all played well, and I happen to be the last Survivor alive but I can't escape through the traditional exits in time, I'd appreciate getting the hatch as a sign of respect. Either way, even if I get hooked for no other reason than the Killer wanted the 4K for giggles, I don't get tilted 'cause at the end of the day, what I'd have gotten for the hatch escape would've only been a nice bonus and not something worth getting upset over.
---
You know damn well I am going to be playing killer to help people farm this shit.
---
I enjoy killer but I want people to actually play the game not beg me to hit their friend so they can heal them.

HOLY FUCK no wonder she died, it looks like she hasn't eaten in  200 centuries?

# TIME TO GO BIG BRAIN TIME
---
I would imagine you could deplete the keys by just using the aura reading too.
---
Buddy it's a joke akin to the likes of r/entitledparents. The entire point is to laugh at people who complain about losing due to some arbitrary made up rules about their side.
---
For the record it's only called r/entitledsurvivors because r/entitledkillers or r/entitleddbd didn't sound as good. We laugh at salty Killers too.
---
Keep being an entitled survivor who can't take a joke about r/entitledsurvivors
---
Bummer. sorry mate. Well, good luck with the challenges!
---
I legit don't understand how they got this so wrong.
---
I understand the Tomes aren't going to disappear with the current Rift, but the Tomes are necessary for the Rift unless you play the game a lot. But if you're a fan of the Lore, you're grinding and hoping for farm games, that's bullshit. It's not fun to want those things and farm games are not fun.
---
I have a monetary and time budget. The Archives is a giant swing and a miss. The cosmetics aren't that good, the time to complete is horrible without the Tomes, and the Tomes right now are a giant grind. The price is standard, that's fine, but combine everything together and it's shit.
---
Seriously BHVR, look at how Epic worked this season's Battle Pass. It went from a giant pain in the ass to easy to complete, challenges are there if you want to change it up and have a goal but not necessary, and lots of cosmetics for free and paid tracks.
---
There's still plenty of time to change it up, make it way less grindy and get the people like me to buy into your economy.
---
I think I'm more than willing to depip on my games so survivors can get these done. These honestly would not be bad if it wasn't for that "Single Trial" part.
---
My gf has the same issue, we have no idea how to solve it. Seems like it‚Äôs happening to a few people, there was a forum thread about it. BHVR doesn‚Äôt have a solution yet.
---
You did the math!
---
I never give hatch but the last person pretty much always gets hatch because i cant be bothered to slug for the 4 man.
---
I had two killers on console the other night give me hatch or let me open the exit door when I was the last one left. I made a point to message them thanks. I‚Äôm all about spreading the wholesome positivity lol
---
Nicely done! Definitely a creep factor and makes the game a little more scarier with the music!
---
So even though they basically went in there not even 5 seconds after he kept on unhooking them he‚Äôs a camper?
---
That's not at all what I mean, haha
---
Don‚Äôt due enduring foot fury good good
---
Those are among the dumbest and most annoying. The only one I laughed at was Demogordon Ramsay.
---
Good job mate
---
RNGesus giveth, RNGesus taketh.
---
Even though I play both sides, I like seeing 4-man escapes as well.
---
1v4 game favors the killer. What a surprise...... 
---
Yes, the difference is in coordination. 1 fully optimal killer = 4 fully optimal survivor + all of them being in coordination.
---
So, if at least one survivor screws up, team of the survivors is going to lose. That is how assertive games always worked.
---
Sure, you can tilt the balanced towards the survivor side to make it fair for casual games etc. However, optimal coordinated survivor team will not be equal (it hardly now is) to the killer, and would just straight up leave him very slim chance to win.
---
That was always been the problem of the asymmetric games. They are highly determined by the coordination of the team, and if it is not strong enough, you would have little to no chance to win (which is fair from the balancing standpoint).
---
I find it so boring to play a 20-30 minute match bc of this
---
It's a camp in name only when the exit gates are powered.  Only shame killers for camps when there are gens still up to defend.  Once all objectives are complete the rules change and most survivors accept this.
---
They need to rework their challenges. These challenges are harder than their achievements, it can take a lot of games to finish one of these challenges because it is a multiplayer game so things won't always go our way... The challenges are ridiculous.
---
I'M AT RANK 5, AND GOT A 4K IN BASEMENT YESTERDAY, SO I PROMISE IT IS ACHIEVABLE. IF YOU WANT TO BE MEAN FOR THE PURPOSES OF COMPLETING THE TOME CHALLENGE YOU COULD INSIDIOUS CAMP I GUESS.
---
What‚Äôs easier is borrowed time bill ruining your tunneling strat  git Gud
---
Me too! It doesn't take long for me to realize why I isolate myself!
---
This makes me irrationally angry.
---
Not like Angry angry but like. Angry that you did this.
---
I have all the DLCs and I still get the fucking splinters
---
oh yeah it is so hard to just wait 15 seconds omegalul
---
Disagree. When you have multiple options but choose the same option again, maybe tunnelish.
---
One time a meg I had just rescued decided to do a totem during my 7/8 totem challenge, kept nodding to tell her to let me do it but nope. She destroyed it but... the killer saw this apparently, decided not to chase me the guy in the open but instead chase the keg doing the totem. Next, when I was the last one left, the killer let me escape.
---
Asked why and they explained how they had the same challenge the night before, and understood the pain. Nice guy.
---
Are you on PC or console and are you in low ranks or high ranks?
---
Big rip
---
Damn she‚Äôs skinny
---
David would blow him and beg for mercy
---
I don't ever give it, but it probably started when hatch standoffs were a thing, and killers didn't feel like sitting around all game.
---
i expect a spike in the number of keys brought into matches

People who don't like dying should play a different game. Change my mind.
---
What's the Last Minute Hero challange you claim to be near impossible?
---
I haven't seen it yet, but I assume that the one about breaking 40 pallets/gens is one that doesn't unlock lore. My one complaint about the tome is that the rewards are uniform regardless of difficulty/time-wasting and the only exception is that challenges with lore give a bit more.
---
Plus if you're in a locker they can't slug you
---
personally am kinda forced to as I desperately want to finish the whole 70 levels for the charm lol. But bhvr really needs to take feedback on board with these next time. These challenges aren't challenging it's more annoying than anything else
---
Now that's some quality shitposting.
---
The corn field maps are the absolute worst IMO. They just look so drab, and the oversaturated yellows make it look like I'm playing in a cloud of piss.
---
"When you see a toxic survivor that unhook in front of the killer, (list of toxic behaviour), you should kill the toxic survivor". 
---
If someone is using nonstandard grammar, pick out the parts of the post that are clearest. Then examine the words around those parts, bearing in mind the context of the clear parts. It's typically not that difficult to understand what they're saying, if you try to. As opposed to reaching for the first unkind remark to come to mind.
---
Several of these might as well be dice rolls
---
Eh, what region?
---
Upstate New York?
---
overall its more of a good sport thing then anything, if your trying to rank up always kill.
---
If you see someone that was looping the fuck out of you and the rest of the team was dogshit, you give them the hatch to make up for matchmaking cucking them so they can pip.
---
I don't really bother anymore. They make you play in a way that's detrimental to yourself, and or your team.
---
Seriously. I watched it back like 10 times and couldn't figure out why the fuck I went that way.
---
Gimme a Feng mafia
---
Well the mori requires a killer to chase and down and hook the survivor. I‚Äôm not defending Moris. But imo keys and moris are just as bad. Keys require x amount of gens to be done. Moris require you to hook a survivor and then find them again after they get unhooked. They‚Äôre both over powered and both should be removed imo. Or reworked
---
But what if we buff NOED instead?
---
That is an awesome clip my guy.
---
Then they tbag like they're gods when the killer did the only thing he could.
---
BHVR ACTUALLY BANS PEOPLE WHO GET BAD REPORTS? YOU SURE?
---
I PLAY ON HADDONFIELD WITH A MOFO BILLY AND I WAS DESTROYING THIS TEAM. 5 GENS LEFT AND I START TO GET SURVIVORS ON THEIR SECOND HOOKS SO I START TO TAKE IT EASIER ON THEM CUZ IM A NICE BILLY.
---
ONE LIL FUCK I LEAVE ON THE GROUND BECAUSE I KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE FUN FOR ANYONE IF I JUST KEPT HOOKING THEM. HE GETS UP LATER ON. N-B-D. I LATER LEARN THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE WHEN HE WAS THE LAST SURVIVOR. I TRY TO LOOK FOR HIM AND THE HATCH, CATCH A LEAD, AND FOLLOW HIM TO SEE HIM TEABAGGING ME ON THE HATCH AND JUMPS THROUGH BEFORE I COULD CHAINSAW OVER.
---
LIL BITCH DIDN'T DO SHIT ALL GAME AND HAS THE AUDACITY TO TEABAG. FUCK
---
Yeah! How dare he try to get a single kill in the game that‚Äôs less than a minute from ending. Good thing they were toxic at the gates to let him know how selfish he was being.
---
Sounds like it!
---
No bc I hate him
---
I hope you also think sometimes about deliberately giving yourself to the killer so they can get a kill. Survivors shouldn't be the only ones who get benefits.
---
Sounds like a punk, he does
---
Yeah, but when 3 gens pop within the first couple of minutes, you've been gen-rushed!
---
&gt; I like the idea of forcing players to change the way they play slightly for a challenge
---
i wish i could upvote your comment more than once just for this alone. ***some*** of the challenges where you use different perks can make it more fun, but some of these are at best annoying, at worst ridiculous.
---
You to buddy. Hope it goes well
---
I dunno if this will help at all but I've started a campaign to only be positive while playing this game granted I play with friends but i have a be positive mandate if they join. Some matches test that I'm vocal in the negative as I stream DBD but in the end game lobby I thank the killers or survivors for the fun game. If the game wasn't fun I just leave. I guess the point I'm trying to make use forcing positive feedback has made the game more enjoyable
---
SHIT, YOU DIDN'T MENTION YOU HAD TO BE USING MONSTROUS SHRINE. NOW I'M PISSED TOO, THAT PERK SUCKS.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to put it on my fries!
---
Had to do it with the trapper challenges. 
---
I was like, *"Come on, step on my trap... I won't hurt you"*.
---
It's getting nerfed for a reason.
---
this didn't age well
---
You're just dealing with entitled survivor mains. Ignore the salt and move on.
---
He did the Monster Math.
---
A lot of these should remove the ‚Äúin a single match‚Äù line.  
---
I don‚Äôt mind saving people in EGC but 2 in a single match? I‚Äôll try the killer route first.
---
If you aren‚Äôt playing right now it‚Äôs out
---
I don‚Äôt know about that. I watch really good survivor streamers play solo queue and they still get slapped. At the end of the day it‚Äôs a team game and there is only so much you can do. I think ‚Äúlearning to play better‚Äù is an easy thing to say, and is usually thrown around in an unbalanced game, but the truth is that this game heavily favors killers based on those kill rates. Those are average kill rates as well. Good killers are probably far above that mark.
---
i used to be a "last player gets hatch" kind of killer, but i've become a capricious killer in my old age. i don't care about my rank, but i also don't care about hatch politics. i try to remember survivors who stick out for me and think of it now as a "thanks for a fun game" or "sorry you had a shit time" if i do and they're still alive
---
or if i just stank up a whole match i might bring a survivor to the exit as my own personal penance
---
in the same vein, i always thank a killer who lets me escape because there's no obligation for them to do it and i don't like the attitude some people have where they expect it or get mad if the killer give it to the 'wrong' person. it's a nice thing some people like to do and there's a bunch of entitled babies out there going full dudley dursley over it
---
I probably get 2-3 unhooks per survivor game and 8-10 pallet/gens per killer. Sure they take time but you can equip them and forget about it until it's finished. It's the "In one game get the stars to align" type ones I hate
---
Gens take 80s to do, and while you chase one guy, for more than 80s, three gens can pop. So when killers fail to maintain sustainable map pressure they call it bs, aka gen rush. It may seem like unfair gameplay, but when the survivors do it, they‚Äôre just doing what they‚Äôre supposed to do, it ain‚Äôt toxic 
---
-i play both sides, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm that much biased
---
I just rrstarted my switch and that seemed to fix it. I completely forgot that that was an option lol but yeah the bug is still annoying tho.

Come to think of it, should players be worried about being unable to finish the rift if all challenges are now stupid hard? I'm close to 35 right now and have 3 challenges left from tome 2. If tome 3 is ridiculous and tome 4 is even worse, I'm going to have a hard time getting rift progress.
---
Is Quentin the mailman?
---
Thankyou!!
---
P3 Claudette with Spine Chill, Urban Evasion, Left Behind, and Sole Survivor/Distortion letting everyone else die to grab hatch, they get downed they DC.
---
It's okay to camp if you're using it as a strat. If you're using it because someone tbags or something, then fuck that killer. I don't tbag the killer at pallets, but it's a stupid thing to camp if you're not using it as a strategy or during EGC. 
---
I can get 4ks and I can get 2ks by camping depending on how the survivors play, and if they actually played good, they won't complain most of the time. If they bumrush hook, then they will complain about me camping.
---
What do you mean by sale of rift tiers? As far as I can tell there's no way to pay money to advance your rift tiers.
---
Me neither, her feet were tricky to draw because they‚Äôre fucked up lmao
---
Seriously BHVR, pull your heads out of your asses. No one wants to deal with these grindy-ass/entirely luck-or-farm based challenges.
---
Supposing you aren't one of the standard trolls....
---
Genrushing is doing the generators over all else, such as ignoring a hooked individual, or breaking totems. Usually in the context of a survive with friends team, who actively plan and focus all gens to be complete by 4 mins in the match.  They usually then proceed to loose several members to noed and then bitch profusely that they shouldn't be punished for ignoring the secondary objective.
---
Wait are people really that sensitive?
---
The part you quoted me about the things contribute to kill ration is very much important, but I respect that you disagree with me. 
---
I also don‚Äôt know why you brought up anything about killer mains or survivor mains, I‚Äôm just pointing out how disconnected the data is in relevance to everyone‚Äôs reaction. I‚Äôve already said enough, I feel so I think we are just going to leave it at that.
---
Thanks so much, I think I get it a bit more now
---
Gen rush is the objective so its not a thing. I know its annoying and I get why it sucks as a killer.
---
Whoops, same hahaha, I‚Äôll have to try a complete restart as well. I didn‚Äôt realize switch had a actual turn off feature besides rest mode
---
Adam with deliverance is the one being carried to the hook
---
Out of the kindness of my heart, I will help survivors get their EGC safe unhooks by running an endgame build on Spirit.
---
Or just any killer with agitation/iron grasp..
---
Sp00py!
---
Loop the killer for as long as you can. If they are a baby you can probably do it for a long time.
---
At the end of the game let the killer sac you.
---
This way they get practice in mind gaming and looping, while still slightly getting punished by other people doing generators, and them not ending the chase.
---
In post game, if they are not toxic, try to give them some tips. Personally one of the best things I found was to watch other people.
---
With in my first like dozen games the first thing someone said to me in post game chat was "Get help" Sadly they didnt say much after that, but another survivor explained that I watch another killer, even just one or two games. Turns out Get Help was what I needed.
---
Safefly unhook 3 survivors in endgame collapse (must be done in a single trial)
---
Exactly!
---
Ok behavior where are the real challenges
---
I wished the devs understood how their own game worked
---
Yeah, if people even make it to the challenge, RIP solo survivors and killers have fun and fast paced matches. I wouldn't be surprised if people played Doctor just to out of spite. Lol.
---
Plague is stronger than all of them
---
Play stupid games; win stupid prizes.
---
i mean ruin is used to slow the game, and then noed is used as a backup perk to make sure you cannot lose
---
Spirit is what Wraith should have been from the beginning so I'm not surprised
---
Oh damn never mind you had a point there.  3 survivors all egc is pretty crazy.
---
Consider this, rewards are less then just doing a daily, so wtf?
---
You're right. I slowed it down and you can see her m1 for just a second as she's falling off the roof. When it happened in real time there was no stutter or lag and I didn't catch the m1. I was losing my mind during the match trying to figure out what happened lol
---
I did play on PC on low ranks like a month ago and everytime I start playing that game after like 10 matches I drop it again because of the insane long waiting times.
---
Never played a multiplayer game where you have to wait 15-30 minutes for a match that isn't even as long as the waiting times.
---
Uh, he just released and nobody has a problem with him, so?
---
thanks! i hate it!
---
What exactly is endgame? When does it start?
---
It was a graveyard smath.
---
r/unexpecteddnd
---
True. It depends on how you use SWF.
---
If you use it to just play the game normally, but just say "I found Ruin" "Someone heal me" "X is the Killer" then I personally think its fine. You are playing like you normally do, but you have a smaller bonus
---
However, using SWF to milk every ounce of information that you can and changing the way you play barbecue you are a more coordinated group is toxic.
---
I agree totally
---
Challenges should actually be challenging not straight up impossible in situations that happens once every blue moon
---
It can be, survive without been injured or not get found. Kill all survivors before last gen pop, use this perk and so on. Not this situational
---
Something like "unhook a survivor than unhooked you before" is the way to go, not this bs
---
Alright thanks, makes a bit more sense now
---
Don't shame killers for camping at all unless the killer isn't using it as a strategy. 
---
When I camp, the survivors who are more likely to complain are the SWFs that need a refill on their sippy cup and the survivors who think that they can save someone by unhooking right in front of me. I've had an actually good survivor say something along the lines of "He's just playing the game the way he wants to. It's your fault that you died anyway because you ran up to hook while he was camping."
---
I really like this concept for a chapter! I can tell you put a lot of work into this, and I can only dream that they would add this as a chapter! The Shining is one of my all time favorite movies/books, so I might be a little biased, but even down to the add ons, it's great! 10/10
---
I'm not concerned about the grinding one. Safely unhooking a shit tons of person will come down naturally. Same with doing gens. But most of the "do in one trial" ones are total bullshit. They require you to tally go out of your way to even attempt. Meaning, before you manage to do them, you will "throw away" most of your games by not playing efficiently, making all the upcoming pretty much problematics. Well sure, i'm being pessimistic but still.
---
Also, are they serious by making the first challenge for survivors the 25 unhooks ? Have fun unhooking whil all your teammates will be trying to do the same... &gt;.&gt; 
---
Plz BHVR, next time, start the tome with 2 differents survivors challenge AND 2 killers challenge. People won't be competing against each other THAT much, that way.
---
Who knows? Maybe they'll fix the matchmaking by Christmas?
---
Probably not though.
---
It‚Äôs 1v4. I play how I want and you do the same. I hate matches where I don‚Äôt get at least 1 kill yet I recognize it‚Äôs part of the game and I‚Äôm not always gonna have fun. I recognize as survivor I won‚Äôt always escape or everyone will die including me, and I won‚Äôt have fun. I accept that because it‚Äôs bound to happen no matter what in a 1v4 setting. Someone is getting the small end of a straw most of the time.
---
**you can bet your ass I‚Äôll do whatever I want whenever I want regardless of which side I‚Äôm on and I expect you to do the same.**
---
lol escape the trial twice, must be completed in one trail.
---
*equips noed*
---
LITERALLY FUCKING TODAY MOTHERFUCKER
---
Those are the 12 year olds that plague this game
---
Yeah, absolutely. I see no reason to go full immersion and draw out the game. I respect the Killer's time, and I expect the same, be it the hatch or the hook. Same goes for when I play Killer. No reason to draw out the match unnecessarily.
---
ditto but its been a lot longer than that for me. lol
---
welcome back üëå
---
In this case it starts when the exit gates are opened by you or the killer.
---
Could also start when you're the last survivor and The killer closes the hatch.
---
WHY THE FUCK DO KILLER ABILITIES PROC BORROWED TIME BUT NOT ANY OF THEIR OWN PERKS
---
LIKE I UNDERSTAND NOT WORKING FOR NOED/EXPOSED PERKS. TOTALLY FINE. THAT‚ÄôD MAKE LEGION/HUNTRESS SUPER ANNOYING. BUT CAN WE GET A LITTLE FUCKING CONSISTENCY.
---
I‚Äôm just not gonna bother doing most of these if I find them annoying, honestly.
---
those "within one trial" are stupid is just pure luck or playing like a douche to try to get them, the toxicity will grow with this challenges, for survivors  would be to open a door if the killer is chasing another guy and hide to see if the killer can hook 2 guys and try to rescue them, as for the killer challenges I expect camping for the basement hooks and camping for endgame NOED
---
As for the others... the grinding is real, if they dont want to change them at least make them all available not 1 by 1, if all of them are available the grind is not that bad you can play normally and start building this challenges
---
Luckily I rarely play survivor so in rank 20 they always dies no matter how much I try to protect them.
---
If I see someone with a flashlight in pre game I already look at walls.
---
This stuffs insane.
---
It's a joke dude, I play a crap ton of wraith and pig, it just both of them are very, very weak killers
---
Looks like you were wrong
---
He's looking like the Spirit now too lol.
---
Alright, thanks for the info :)
---
Spirit legit just: :&gt;
---
"Whuuuuuuut?"
---
You're back to camping Pony?  I knew you started off posting originally as a trash Insidious camper but then you seemed to start playing more survivor and I've seen you call out others for doing it to you.  You've regressed back to the dark side?  That is disappointing to hear man.  You were making progress it seemed.
---
but they will be unhooked while you carry the other person.

For real, when I started memes like this really influenced what I thought of different players. But after 200+ hours I've still never seen something like this

genrushing is a thing. it's when the survivors do shit like completely ignore totems and let other survivors sit on hooks forever and bring in 3 commodious toolboxes. that's not just doing the objective; that's going in with a particular playstyle in mind. which isn't to say there's anything necessarily wrong with it.
---
I watched a Monto game yesterday where he had 2 survivors in the basement at all times and everyone was always injured and even though he won, they still got 4 gens finished through Ruin. Imagine if he didn't have Ruin or if the survivors did what I described above - he could not have won even though he objectively outplayed them in a significant fashion.
---
that's an issue

as a killer you can get looped for gens while there's little to nothing you can do about it aganist good survivors. The game can arguably be killer sided if you use nurse and spirit with meta perks, but otherwise survivors can easily burn through gens before the killer has momentum. even veteran players come into situations where they have little control aganist a good swf team no matter how well they play. Please go play some killer matches and red or purple ranks and tell me how the game is killer sided.
---
Outer Speed + Aftermath means you can go 14+20=34% faster after four gens if you've been hit twice. You could chase down a killer who's trying to flee from you.
---
Or if Aftermath speed means gen speed, then Engineer + Aftermath means your third gen is going 15+10=25% faster. That's a purple toolbox, and you can _carry_ a purple toolbox additionally.
---
how do you just get dbd but your coming back.
---
Assuming you get your max of 3 unhooks without deviation, that's about 9 matches for one challenge. If every match is like 7 minutes (not including que time) you're spending an hour of play time on a single challenge and can't progress in the rift to get different challenges till you've finished your hour.
---
Ah, for some reason, while unknown and doesn't make sense, I thought these challenges were supposed to be somewhat enjoyable, but no.
---
 Same BP/Rift Fragments rewards for twice the work, guess it's time to farm
---
That's just from gaining experience, not doing archive stuff. Keep in mind, the tome stays open after the rift finishes. If you just do tomes 1 and 2, you'll probably finish the rift with normal game experience, then you can do the tomes at your own pace.
---
At this level of the tome, it's very clearly not meant for players to be completing a challenge every few matches, these ones are meant to last until we happen to get a chance to complete them. It's a bit shitty then that you can only have one selected at a time with them being so luck based at this point, you could have the opportunity to complete dozens of challenges but miss out because you have another one selected. Hopefully they do something where you can select multiple challenges at one time, maybe after the rift finishes or you reach the next tome level.

Typical camper
---
For the NOED one I'm probably gonna do the NOED + Blood Warden + Remember Me + Fire Up/Bitter Murmur endgame build.

*graveyard graph.

most of these aren't even challenges, they're just stupid coincidences
---
BHVR BOUT TO BRING MONSTROUS SHRINE‚Äôs PICKRATE UP BY AT LEAST 6000% LOL
---
I'm changing my killer name to "FARM YOUR EGC HOOKS" and letting people do this shit tomorrow for free. Fuck this challenge.
---
It's amazing how many of these more aggravating challenges would become fine and dandy if they removed the "Must be completed in a single trial" line of text.
---
Give me all sorts of bizarre, niche situations BHVR for these challenges if you want BHVR. But at least let me slowly accumulate credit to them over the course of several games. Forcing them to be done in a single match just warps games around them as 4 survivors fight for a goal that will probably only happen for a single person in a given scenario.
---
Also, for killer challenges, we have two perfect examples of what's good and what is asinine:
---
* 'Unnerving Encounter' - Prevent any Exit Gates from being opened using the perk Unnerving Presence'
---
This is a good challenge, because it's something you will want to try and be doing anyway, but it won't happen every game. It doesn't warp the main play style of a killer outside of perk selection, which I think is fine to get people to try perks they might otherwise look over. Play the game as you normally would, and get an extra reward when you completely win a game
---
* 'No One Escapes the Endgame' - Sacrifice 2 survivors to the Entity during the EGC using NOED
---
This is a more aggravating challenge. All the drama about NOED and feelings about using it aside, the scenario when it's achievable is something you want to avoid as a killer. If you're using NOED, and the EGC collapse is already active, 9 times out of 10 you can bet the survivors will quit while they're ahead and exit while you're busy hooking the first survivor.  Unless they find NOED near an exit gate they will probably skedaddle.  There are so many ways to do a challenge like this but not make it hair-pullingly frustrating. Make it be doable over multiple games is  the simplest one.
---
And then pray they aren‚Äôt already on death hook
---
And then pray that you get to them first especially since multiple people might be trying to finish the challenge
---
This subreddit in a nutshell tbh. If I see Sydney Prescott reposted again I'm going to roll my eyes into the back of my skull.
---
You do you buy I prefer to beat my opponents skillfully.  I don't cheese kills with baby camps or tunnels or broken addons.  When my games end I like knowing I outplayed my opponents and gave them no room to complain about it either since I play fair.  Bizarrely enough contrary to nearly everything I've read on this sub I get next to no post game salt from the opponents after my 4k's.  If you don't play like a dick they usually aren't dicks in response themselves.  Funny how that works.  You explained the mindset behind your approach to the game so I did the same.  You do you but that mindset creates a lot of needless toxicity.
---
Yes. It's pointless.
---
It still works
---
Rank doesnt equal skill, everyone says clown is shit and even official stats confirm it but yeah, lets listen to the Reddit rando - seems trustworthy
---
Yeah mate you are full of shit, if instead of shouting how balanced and good people would actually rate him in an unbiased way then maybe we could see a balanced roster of killers
---
Exactly, one trial challenges are bs. For example, catch 5 survs in bear traps in a single trial. This "challenge" does show your skill to some extend with trap placement, but ultimately, it all comes down to survivors being either sloopy or bad, and get caught which rarely happens in high ranks anyway. I'm just gonna complete most in friendly manner, meaning I'll let them escape while hopefully they fuel my challenges, just too frustrating to actually try and complete them "the normal way"
---
$1/100 auric cells per tier once you've paid to unlock the rift.   
---
By making the tome challenges unreasonably hard, it will require much more grinding to level up, which requires more play time.  It usually takes 2-3 games to earn one shard, and 10 shards per rift tier.   At even 5 minute games with ZERO matchmaking time, you are looking at 100-150 minutes per tier.  Add in matchmaking time and the more likely 8-10 minute game, you are looking at probably 3-4 hours of play for one rift tier.  Most people don't have that kind of time to dedicate to gaming, let alone a single game.  Create the problem. Sell the solution.
---
I bought the pass and I'm already struggling with some of the tier two challenges, this is seriously annoying. I liked how tier one made me adjust my playstyle slightly and try different perks, this is just awful. Guess I'll just have to spend my entire free time grinding these :/
---
I must be blind then lol
---
I had 2 games on Swamp where the hatch legit didn't spawn. Serious. I spent almost 10 minutes looking, both on Grim Pantry.
---
AT LEAST YOU HAVE A COOL GIRLFRIEND BASED ON YOUR USERNAME! TAKE YOUR RAGE AT DEAD HEARD AND TURN IT INTO LOVE FOR HER!
---
dude you are fucking weird. do you like keep a spreadsheet of all the people who play in ways and say things you don't like so you can reference back to it when you see them? what the fuck
---
I'm not necessarily talking about drawing out the game, though. I'm saying - you clearly do take advantage and appreciate killers taking you to the hatch so that they only get a 3k. I hope that, on occasion when you've opened the exit gate and could leave, you instead go to the killer and run to the nearest hook so they can kill you.
---
Nobody ever really does this and yet it's exactly the same idea as a killer giving the hatch. I do it occasionally when the killer would otherwise get a 0k. But while hatch is in some circles deemed to be 'normal' if not 'expected', the idea of a survivor giving themselves up is so rare as to seem crazy. When it's exactly the same.
---
Really love the artstyle! Reminds me of Courage the Cowardly Dog. :)

This is...really bad

Maybe we'll be lucky and they'll roll out some changes with the chapter patch.

I don't expect them to do so however.
---
If someone is on the hook at end game I will more often than not sacrifice myself so they can get out with BT.
---
Pretty sure that's what they said lol
---
I bet the killer's player is feeling great about this kill, it does feel satisfying.
---
this weirdodin dude is by far one of the most insane people on this forum. like, you talked about camping in the context of instant SWF saves, which he completely ignored, and then pulled out his "forum user spreadsheet" to reference back to something you said previously they didn't like so they could shame you for something utterly irrelevent
---
fucking nutjob
---
I still really want a poster of the Neon Nea / Legion banner artwork. That shit looked badass.
---
Tbh if I was called unviable this much I would probably do the same...
---
This is what killers would be doing if they had TikTok accounts.
---
No. I will head on stun you. Ez pz slap and clap I hope you are playing the clown ü§°
---
Camping has cured my depression, sir.
---
If you do the killer challenge first, then go straight  to very bottom and then all the way right to epilogue, it seems manageable. A lot if the other challenges I won't even attempt, fuck that.
---
Don't worry, level 4 will have unhook 3!
---
Nice teamwork
---
Yeah I know, Balance is the first problem this game encounter, still, it would be sick af
---
Yes they are
---
*sighs* I'll take it
---
oh my god you don't know how easy that is to counter
---
how cute. u r adorbz
---
I did this to a plague the first time I used Haddon field infinite. Felt so bad.
---
See I think the only time one should have a chance to be given the hatch is when you drop an item for me, or when someone DCs. Being an asshole removes this though. Tea bagging or flashlight clicking instantly deems you not worthy for the hatch.
---
However, there are times where I get quick 3k and I am walking around looking for the hatch and the poor survivor runs right into me, and clearly shits themselves. You know damn well I am downing them and giving them the hatch.
---
Cute Survivors almost always get the hatch.
---
Am I stupid or have they switched out one of the charms completely? We had one that lights up very brightly and that's gone now and replaced by a Claudette figure??
---
That would take a lot of time, and they would still have different stats, because not all killers have the same mechanics, so some will be easier and other will be harder, so they won't all get the same stats.
---
Im baby Jane and will report you if you kill
---
Me ez pz clap and slap
---
If you heard a bubba rev his chainsaw while in his terror radius and you were healing with 2 other teammates in the open, you would have more than enough time to react. If you guys chose to not move and then all get downed, bubba doesn‚Äôt become a top tier killer, you guys become bottom tier players.
---
5\* dude, i'm not crazy herf herf
---
Nah, thanks, we have enough balance issues already.
---
It's obvious that Freddy is too strong though. Killers shouldn't be getting that many kills.
---
I can't get any toxic killer messages if I do so bad as survivor they thank me for the easy kill
---
&gt; If I plan on killing someone, I don't give them false hope
---
The Entity has removed you from his friends list

To be fair it almost basically forces you to do iron grasp and agitation because you don't know where a Chase will end and how far they'll be from the basement.

---
Jesus fuck, 6 grabs?!

*Target Acquired, take the shot! "
---
I am level 43 and have't even been able to play that much since my english friend is over, so less then 1 hour each day for the past 2 weeks and I'm over halfway with like 50 days to go. So i don't think normal gameplay gives to little.
---
Oh wow, he thiccc
---
I SWEAR TO GOD, IM QUITTING THIS GAME UNTIL THEY MAKE THE TRUE FULLSCREEN FEATURE
---
Ok survivor main.
---
I feel like this is goodbye everyone but Meg. In 20 seconds that's an extra 100% distance covered if you're running in a straight line, never mind the additional vault speed.
---
But more generally, you're going to get a lobby dodging if someone brings a survivor whose power the rest don't like.
---
Oh I read it as 9 for some reason
---
You are probably right, those the dragons confuse me
---
Basically
---
I had a dude badmouthing me for not giving him a hatch because it was "a good game". It didn't really to begin with, their team played kinda badly.
---
Lmao sauce on the original video?
---
You‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs the very first one for killer too.

I play more killer than survivor though, lol. What an idiot.

So you want survivors to win every single match.

Honestly I am going to stop trying for the challenges and just play the game normally.
---
I will do the ones that dont require me to change everything, like destroy 40 pallets/gens but I am tired of playing trapper. It will be faster to just grind the games for the Rift Tokens anyway.

OH JUST PLAY KILLER THE RIGHT WAY! Bro, i should've thought of that at the time. You right, freddy is op now.
---
Or survivors don‚Äôt understand that stealth is one of their greatest tools. If you hear the corrupt purge sound then get sneaky.
---
Tapp neck scratch thing is fucking hilarious
---
If you play killer, why do you want killers only to be able to get 2k?
---
I‚Äôd be fine with the survivors being reskins if they just all shared perks/items.
---
I‚Äôd much prefer to dump more points into my killers to get better add ons and such for them.

I try to cleanse as little as possible but I‚Äôve never played Plague myself, so ... maybe I should finally check her out to experience the other side. Hehe

 [here's the one with the green screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuZP37qwzAE)

Just play an expose character and territorial guard the basement if you absolutely need to complete it lmao. I agree that the challenges shouldn't make your game unwinnable but its not uncompleteable like unhooking people in endgame collapse is.
---
&gt; gg piece of shit
---
You're no fun
---
Idk what you think this game is. Survivors don't collectively win or lose. You win if you pip and lose if you don't. Having two survivors escape doesn't mean "survivors win."
---
You obviously haven't been playing long.
---
Alright, the main thing is the pallet in the center is one of the MOST SAFE pallets in the game. In the event it is dropped, the killer MUST either break it, or leave. Otherwise, you can loop forever. Vaulting over the pallet will buy you more time. So, in the event the pallet is dropped, you can vault as long as you have the time. If the killer tries to go around, don't try to mind game them and continue vaulting the pallet, run the exact other way that they are, circling the tree. If they come close to you, vault the pallet, make sure you leave yourself some space. And if all else doesn't help, get a friend, with KYF, and try to see that. I had someone do that for me when I was learning.
---
You Should probably give a link just to make sure your being truthful.

\*Benny Hill theme plays\*
---
I play around 3 hours a day. Even longer on weekends. There is no possible way for me to level up quicker through normal gameplay.
---
&gt; you need to add the RNG of people disconnecting,
---
yesterday i started a match, as soon as i found someone, two people disconnected. i decided to let the remaining survivors farm, so i stood still and let the one guy flashlight me, only to have them DC as well. i eventually led the sole survivor to the hatch and moved on to my next match.

---
&gt; It's satire my dude...
---
yeah no fucking shit. I know that. You all know that. But you all *are misreading it completely*
---
&gt; poking fun at people who complain about survivors being underpowered or killers not playing by the "survivor rulebook for killers".
---
it's literally the opposite holy fucking shit
---
Wanna know how I know you're rank 15?
---
Even then it is better than self-care. It is much better to split that time and spend part of it without pressure doing a totem, and the other part in a locker. Self-care requires you to spend those 30 seconds right there when the killer still might be around, vulnerable to stuff like Nurses Calling. 
---
Running to a locker is the same as running somewhere safe to heal up, no matter what perk you are running. Lockers are everywhere. And totems are also easy AF to find. 
---
Botany Knowledge and a med kit is a good alternative, but it is affected by healing slowdowns and vulnerable to aura reading or Franklins. I have no problems with the combo though, it is still better than Self Care. Up to you if you use Inner or Botany, both have pros and cons.
---
Do you focus on leveling just 1 survivor yet? Red colored items/addons dont show up for me until like level 40+. 
---
When I started I would put alot of points into 1 survivor until they were level 50. Got the teachable perks I wanted, and then decided who my main was.

literally how

For Meg we can lower the numbers, nothing too hard to do. I just want people to stop spittin on survivors :c
---
I was planning on doing this too. 
---
But at 1 gen they started bodyblocking me, just cause (hadn‚Äôt hit anyone yet, just 1 pull from a gen) so I gabe up and started the hunt (got 32 broken pallets/gens in a single latch so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è can‚Äôt complain)
---
love it
---
I do it too
---
They didn‚Äôt ‚Äúget it wrong‚Äù from a business sense. They intentionally put these bullshit ones in to help drive auric cell sales for rift tiers. People see it and think ‚ÄúThis is going to take forever‚Äù and decide spending a few bucks to make up for the time to get the shards is worth it. They know people care about the cosmetics more than the lore sense the cosmetics are temporary while tomes are not.
---
Classic FOMO (fear of missing out) that live service games take advantage of.
---
r/doubledownwoooosh
---
I think it is my best idea, not to powerful, but useful ! And new ingame animation ! :D
---
I‚Äôm gonna take the extra time to annoyingly message all the survivors and ask if they‚Äôre doing challenges. I want everyone to complete the tome!
---
Everyone here has stated they play less than 3 hours and are still doing good. I only play for the challenges and earn plenty of extra rift fragments through the xp while grinding and im tier 60.
---
why do people who obviously only play survivor say shit like this? do you think you're actually fooling anyone?
---
No it hasn't always been blood cause my friend lost his prestige outfits after the December 2016 after the huge bug that happened, so he had them the whole time. But yeah maybe completing some extra challenges as the survivor/killer would unlock the Legacy for them (ex. Get 3 downs within 20 seconds as Myers in Tier 3)
---
shut up
---
A botany knowledge medkit though is so quick, no amount of perks will make it worse than self care or inner strength, and it can be done anywhere at any time. That's why I prefer it. Botany is a pretty slept on perk.
---
You know what I think you're right, the devs should just remove the killers and let the survivors spawn next to a gate with all the gens powered up.. sounds a little hard to me though so they might need to nerf gates.
---
Lmfao!!! 
---
This is so true!
---
not all heroes wear capes
---
I always struggle because its points weather they give me hatch or not
---
Every three matches nets you two fragments. You first survivor and first killer match should get you one fragment each. So to start the day and advance one tier you should have to play ~14 matches.
---
The sad part is the lore locked behind the herculian tasks.
---
It's crazy how arguably the worst killer gets so many cosmetics.
---
I will be trying to help them with it too but the worst part is, they may not even be running the challenge and you will pretty much not know. This is why there should be a pre-game chat that let's the killer read it as well. Like Identity V.
---
Fuck people who do that.
---
He is perfectly balanced, your wrong
---
good job ignoring everything i said
---
No. The stats dont mean shit, it includes rank 1 and rank 20. At rank 1 all killers have over a 60% kill rate. It also would have you believe nurse is bad, just because her stat is low. No, shes great it's just shes hard to play so people dont win with her often. Freddy is pretty simple to play, and his kit is strong. Of course his kill rate will be high. That doesnt mean he is overpowered. Killers should get 2-3 kills a game, and 4 if they play really well. I saw you said that you think pipping is winning. Well fun fact, as a rank 1 survivor, I die a lot, but still pip almost every match. Now the killer has gotten 3 kills but I still won. He also won. I'd assume at least one other survivor pipped, maybe 2. Now almost everyone won. As killer, its significantly harder to pip, and it almost always requires I get 2 or 3 kills, as if the gates get open, gens usually went too fast for me to win. Freddy is one of the few killers that can recover from 2 gens popping before your first hook. Hes strong, but does not need a nerf. Ghostface definitely doesnt need a nerf. Hes a great killer but he has no form of map pressure. Clown is scary good in chase, so is plague. Are they overpowered though? No, because they have no pressure. Ghostface is fine.
---
I miss Death Garden
---
That's only on red ranks though
---
Plus DCs count towards those numbers
---
Come join the oversaturated toxic people on PS4 and
---
You get instant lobby‚Äôs and all the squaddettes you can handle!!
---
70% kill rates mean nothing for balance. A 70% kill rate is a 49% chance of a 4k and a 24% chance of a 4k. 
---
Actually yeah, that is a bit strong. 50% kill rate sounds better.
---
It's takes me 5 minutes at most (usually 1 or 2 minutes) to find a match. My teammates as survivor are already trash and I am also trash. It's fun for me and I use it as a strategy and not to be a dick.
---
Well, i'm going to have to be "toxic" to do some of the challenges, i'm thinking insidious bubba and have a mori ready to kill the the obsession. I don't want to do this but this is the most efficient way to do it, they need to re-think about these challenges.
---
I agree I hate when killers pretend to let someone go and open the exit gate just to instantly down and hook them. Dick move bro, just let them go or kill them outright.
---
I noticed that totem spawns have been extremely poor after one of the most recent updates, even on maps that have spawn points i personally think are too strong. almost all of my spawns have been openly facing a gen, on/in shack, or the survivors spawn on it
---
i'm going to keep track for maybe 200 games and post the results
---
Most of them are easy but super tedious. A few are stupidly hard to the point of not being worth trying
---
to be fair it‚Äôs nothing to overpowered, hell maybe the player sometimes won‚Äôt notice
---
WHY ARE ADEPT ACHIEVEMENTS FOR KILLER SO MUCH HARDER THEN SURVIVOR!?!?!  SURVIVORS JUST HAVE TO ESCAPE BUT KILLERS GOTTA GET A MERCILESS!?!?!? BRUH JUST LET US GET A 4K FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I love Franks face in the third panel
---
Every game I use deliverance! Except once, I escape!
---
Gross but you started off a babykiller, makes sense you'd return to it.  Just be consistent at least is all I ask for.  Don't be a hypocrite and complain when killers do it to you because I've seen you do it numerous times and now that you're back to trash camping survivors you won't have a leg to stand on complaining about it when it happens to you.
---
I get it‚Äôs a joke but it‚Äôs still a garbage sub
---
Look at my next comment in this thread. I don't play killer for easy kills like what Freddy provides.
---
&gt;But since you ignored my point,
---
Just as you ignored mine.
---
&gt;people don't actually enjoy memey content
---
Then why do memes get thousands of upvotes and hundreds of comments every day on this sub? 
---
&gt;otherwise that subreddit would have a semblance of life to it. If a type of content needs to parasitically attach to a subreddit just to survive then it shouldn't exist in the first place.
---
Nah? That subreddit doesnt have life to it bc I have literally never heard of it in 3 years of being on this sub. No one who is looking for dbd content is going to think to search "coldwind farms" in their reddit search bar. They are going to search "dead by daylight" and find this sub.
---
It isnt "parasitic" in any way. This sub is not devoted to some high intellectual dbd discussion or anything. It is a sub for any and all things dead by daylight, including memes. Why would we fracture the community and split it in to smaller subs where less people get to see all of the content just to please you, when THOUSANDS of people who arent you upvote and enjoy the memes? Memes tend to get way more attention and love than serious commentary anyway. 
---
I enjoy both, and both have a place on this sub. But if you want the world to revolve around you, why dont you go make a "serious dbd discussion" sub and then you and the 7 other people with a stick up their ass can go over there?
---
That‚Äôs the one meme that has been used so much that I want to vomit when I see it along with the player level glitch showing people in the 50k range of devotion. I was rude to that guy and he deleted his post at 4am
---
AS I EXPLAINED TO SOMEONE ELSE, HE OBVIOUSLY WASN'T DOING HIS FLASHLIGHT CHALLENGE
---
I get pissed when I'm planning to hook and end up at one that the hatch is next to because I feel like an ass for hooking them now, so I got to let them go, it'd be rude not to.
---
Technically you just need to make the obsession dead for that one. You can sacrifice him by 3 hook, facecamp him, bleed him out, follow him for 5 gens with Rancor and one-punch-man him out of existence, etc.
---
Yup killers finna be toxic
---
I really hope BHVR changes the challenges so we can complete multiple challenges in one match this would make it so much better
---
i read all of your comments. you're just full of shit *yawn*
---
Your obviously new to the game.
---
Huh didn't think about that. Guess Billy it is then.
---
tier 60 out of 70,  with 53 days left, yea, the challanges arent all that important unless you want lore.
---
I'm afraid to see level 4. Just because all of these challenges are super tedious and only a handful are hard but the hardest ones are really fucking borderline unfair hard for anyone not red rank
---
You're*
---
Ironic that you can't even spell yet are claiming that.
---
That's happening to me too. Dedicated servers, amirite
---
Takes too long to level the pass imo. Other battle passes have boosters if you get the premium one to speed it up. Dbd however. Does not.
---
Ironic.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox tho
---
Which I do. Only thing that keeps me playing since im over 1k hours
---
‚Äú70% kill rate is a 49% chance at a 2k‚Äù
---
What kind of math gymnastics are you doing to get this conclusion?
---
Fair enough then
---
60% kill rate is too strong.
---
Cant believe I have to use monstrous shrine in a game.

Its based off of time so not really. It caps at like 605 per match.
---
If by some chance they don't change how nemesis and the new beast of prey works with him he might be somewhat viable. I agree though I do like playing legion from time to time since he's foot at farming bloodpoints and at the same time I usually don't rank up at all.
---
This has the exact same energy as that "going to the store" video
---
The 40 breaks is actually doable within 2 games. I got 38 in 2. 
---
But yeah. These challenges encourage stupid/toxic behavior, or are just unrealistic. Imo, it would have been better to not have any one trial challenges at all.
---
Your lucky!
---
That's what I thought... I get excited when I get 600+.
---
It‚Äôs not just red ranks, go look at the ‚Äúall ranks‚Äù graph they showed.
---
Freddy sits at 70, spirit at like 69, hag at 68-69, Ghostface and Myers are around 65.
---
Objectively speaking, that is tunneling. But the blame is still on the dumbass that unhooked, not the killer.
---
It‚Äôs 1 xp per second with a cap of 600 or ten minutes per match
---
Yea that part is really annoying. I just don't see how the devs thought these challenges were a good idea :/
---
That one is bugged, I didn't get a safe unhook but  I got it anyway
---
Plus emblem experience...
---
no
---
Does anyone else get a 3k when all the gens are done, and you feel way to tired to search for the hatch so you just open the main door for the last survivor
---
+Respect
---
Oh I had my ups and downs about it. Usually it was to farm points.  Well I used it to farm as many points from a person as I could . But i also left that dude on the floor too if I ready picked on him. Showed some remorse and prolonged the game at the same time. But on the other end of the spectrum, getting stabbed all match was horrible to watch. You just had to watch it happen.
---
Run like the wind.
---
Legion is dead, they just killed the rest of his memory.
---
So, what you're saying is you've played against me before? What's your steam username then?
---
Cool thanks.
---
yeah I've been on a streak where 2 survivors disconnect when downed, if it happens I just let the other 2 farm since when I play survivor I hate dcs
---
New Killer Confirmed
---
10 hours a week with the increasing difficulty though? doubtful. the tome is obviously designed to reach 70 for only really dedicated players
---
Ironic that you claim that yet also use an ad hominem.
---
Did you read it? Kills dont make a win, pips do, you said it yourself. You need more than 2 kills to pip. Survivors can die and pip. Therefore having a 75% kill rate is fine. Plus the stats are meaningless. Nurse has the lowest stats. Are you seriously going to tell me nurse is the worst killer off of that alone?
---
Not really because you're wrong. But you're entitled to think whatever you want buddy.
---
Tombstone Mori¬¥s at the gate are the most satisfying ones, as it is the ultimate penality for disrespect at the end.
---
Teabagging me 2-3 meters from the exit? Nah, your dead now, say bye to those escape points you denied yourself
---
I think the devs don't want to do that because it might give an advantage to people who aren't colorblind and use the mode.  
---
But they should add it in regardless.
---
yep this is the obvious fix
---
hello, entity? I just witnessed a murder
---
i'm just grateful it doesn't have to be within the same trial. but maybe that's in tier 4 of the tome
---
You need to sacrifice them 7 times or are you referring to the one where you have to hook them twice? welp, my answer still stand, bringing a mori is the most efficient way.
---
WHY THE FUCK DON‚ÄôT KILLERS WEAPONS ACTUALLY HAVE TO LAND FOR IT TO COUNT AS A HIT ANYMORE? IT SEEMS ANY SWING WITHIN A METER RADIUS IS GUARANTEED TO HIT
---
I don't mind doing challenges. I mind playing with or against people who are only focusing on challenges. However I can't blame them tbh
---
Theres no killer in the game as strong as spirit. Yes theres nurse but she has an extremly high skill cap. Spirit has no counterplay as freddy and ghostface do
---
Kingu Crimson!
---
Basic statistics. 0.7*0.7 =0.49. Assuming each kill is an independent event (which it isn't, but with this sample size it doesn't matter.
---
oh no not meanie pants ~logical fallacies~ oh nooo
---
I had a guy tell me off because he thought doc was OP and I told him eat an apple and he replied with ? . After that I told him an apple a day keeps the doctor away.
---
I did, but killers should be more challenging than that. 50% is better.
---
Except getting the first hit doesn't have much significance when Wraith gets dumpstered on a lot of tiles, and add-ons or perks shouldn't be the determining factor in a base kit's viability. Which is why Clown is such a subpar killer.    
---
Except I don't want 4ks handed to me? I just want the actual dogshit killers to be buffed, so that I can see something other than a Billy, Spirit, or Freddy for once, and so that the low tier killers are an actual threat like Myers or Huntress, rather than being simply a nuisance.
---
No I haven't played against you but I'm very active on this sub and have seen plenty of your comments and posts.  When I first noticed you it was mainly you bragging and laughing about Indisious Camps with Bubba and moris off hook and typical rank 17 stuff.  But then later I started seeing a change where your posts were more survivor oriented for a time and some specifically complaining about killers facecamping and bm'ing you.  Now by your own admission you're back to camping yourself.  Again haven't played you list observant and always remembered your name standing out on the sub.
---
By that logic no killer has counter play.
---
Welcome back to the Fog :D
---
Mustttt cleanseeee
---
So you admit having no foundation to your argument, thanks.
---
And hows that extactly?
---
Ive had some absolute ace killers whove let me go after being with a trash team
---
Misread that, my bad
---
ironic on how ur bring up grammar because ur argument isn‚Äôt valid
---
&gt; I mind playing with or against people who are only focusing on challenges
---
this hasn't been an issue at all in my experience. so far. i think it could potentially be now that it's getting super grindy. but before this my matches have been the same as they always have been and i have no idea where people have been getting this sense that the challenges have been causing games to be any different. especially since the complains attached to the tome challenges are the same shit people have been complaining about for years
---
‚ÄúYou guys see this??? He‚Äôs scratching his neck what the‚Äî‚Äú
---
You can't loop a killer forever, eventually you'll run out of pallets. Except for infinites I suppose.
---
Wait your actually on my side with this. I agree. Every killer has counter play. Infinites are good.
---
Nope, Forever Freddy, and Leatherface when I have had a rough day.
---
This hurts me inside. I actually want to see inside the head of the dev making these decisions though. How does buffing legions movement speed in his power help, when they are making his power absolutely useless at the same time?
---
&gt;Boost SWF
---
denied, next
---
Battle pass with challenges was the most stupid idea for DBD. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I don‚Äôt hate battle pass, I hate challenges that tied to battle pass. Challenges are already stupid IMO (I am not talking about DBD only, any game that has battle pass also has challenges which are stupid) and BHVR decided to put lore behind those challenges which is more stupid. Not everyone has enough time to complete all the challenges even if they were easy to complete. Now we have level 3 challenges which are more annoying than being hard. Also other games have a pool of challenges and it gives you certain amount of challenges each week. The most important point is those challenges can be completed within 1 week. But BHVR give same amount of time for both level 1 and level 3 challenges. Of course you can continue after the next level released, but then you‚Äôll have less time for level 4. I hope they find another way for tome 2(one without challenges), but if they can‚Äôt I hope they change it at least. Idk maybe they can give certain amount of hard and easy challenges combined each week instead of this ‚Äúlevels‚Äù and also they can put those lore in free battle pass, so everyone can get it.
---
If you want easy wins go smurf.
---
Bloody well done. I didn‚Äôt know I wanted cartoonified killers so badly.
---
Freddy  multiple killers in one. He can teleport, put traps, fake pallets. Think about how many killer only has 1 of those ability. 
---
For you killer main, (stfu) no I'm not crying to nerf anyone. I honestly just play the shit the dev put out.
---
It merely illustrates how you lack authority to counter my argument.
---
The Unnerving one screams hostage doc time to me.
---
Then share with us the strat dear gamer god.
---
Thats why I'm stopping to play dbd slowly.
---
There's always a nerf because of cry babies, on "both sides".
---
I find camping to be boring even if I‚Äôm the one camping
---
There is a fine line between "trying to win" and "tryhard". Here's an example for killers (since im a killer main :P)  
---
"Trying to Win": Basic build, most likely includes Ruin or Pop, playing a higher tier killer (Nurse, Spirit, Freddy, Ghost Face, etc) and slugging once in awhile to maintain pressure  
---
"Tryhard" 4 SLOWDOWN PERKS, 3 MAN SLUGS EVERY 0.2 SECONDS, TUNNELING 1 SURVIVOR INTO THE GROUND (even with DS), SPIRIT ONLY, PRAYER BEADS AND AMULET
---
Thats the best I got lmfao
---
Maybe instead of buffing solos we can nerf swf. Maybe add a few seconds for gens to be done for swf. I don't know enough to know if this is a good idea, but I'm just spitballing.
---
Or if we don't want to touch gameplay, maybe increased bloodpoints for the killer who faces swf. I like the idea of making the survivors more unique in this way but not sure if it is the best idea for game balance.
---
Lol you don't play because the game is becoming balanced.
---
This is extremely impressive, that borrowed time ran out quick lol nice video!
---
pretty good job so far
---
Jesus
---
I agree killer should be harder, but making killers fundamentally bad is not the way to do it. 50% kill rate is what everyone seems to assume is balanced, but 90% of games that I only get 2 kills in I will not pip, I will black pip. 2 kills is a stalemate. 3-4 is a win, and 1 or less is a loss. A 50% kill rate of balance makes it so killers cannot progress up the ranks. 60-70 is where I believe the best spot would be for them. You also continue to ignore the fact that kill rate is barely tied to winning at all, and the fact the stats are skewed.
---
The games designed where your going to get caught eventually. Infinites arent in the game anymore. Your "infinites" are just god loops. Youll still get caught eventually it just takes alot longer and god are broken as hell
---
Gonna farm all of these because BHVR is run by savants who think any of these are doable within an hour aka 5 games on console...at max im getting 2 saves a game, not 20 because 2 is rare enough when everyone is going for saves. Be prepared everyone for the rise of insidious basement leatherface because these challenges do nothing to promote anything good to come this next week.
---
This was literally posted a few days ago lmao
---
I've definetely noticed. The only items I see survivors bringing are medkits and flashlight, for the healing and blinding challenged. And literally the game I played after I made this post, all survivors were scavenging next to the person getting hooked, so they could get the unhook
---
Then you're playing for failure state instead of playing to win.
---
I'm guilty of this, but for the right reasons. If I run to the gate and they're almost done opening it, and I was gonna kill them anyway, I let them finish the gate for the extra points before I down them.
---
But tbf, sometimes this bites me in the ass because I've forgotten that they have Dead Hard.
---
50% kill rate means there's 25% chance to get a 2k and 6% for a 4k. I perfectly understand what it implies.
---
Meanwhile I'm still on tier one... guess not playing all that often has its benefits in some way at least.
---
*equips ebony mori and Hatred*
---
Nope, the game is a complete shit, tons of bugs everyday, tons of nerfs and buffs on both sides.
---
it's been a long time that we don't get a good balance.
---
I bet u gonna be the first to cry a river when the Oni comes out.
---
Okay, people who dont like dying should not play a different game. Your mind is now changed.
---
not a bad idea, as it would eliminate the 99% gate strat being constantly used (which could heighten Blood Warden's usability) but would have some other setbacks to gameflow, as survivors would have to rush hardcore to GTFO, which could apply even more pressure on the Killer.
---
I love how that neither grabs nor injures them. Great game.
---
No, they still exist with balanced landing and on a few loops if you're good.
---
plague counters no mither, you are usually kinda silent but start coughing when infected which nullifies the perk.
---
Dumb question: do the Tomes reset when the rift does (i.e 40ish days from now)?
---
if you knew you weren't going to be a dedicated player, you shouldn't have bought the pass ü§∑
---
So you didn‚Äôt ‚Äújust got dbd‚Äù.
---
Perfectly unbalanced, as all things should be.
---
blood warden would be the most boosted perk ever.
---
I just want to finish the challenges for the sake of doing the challenges not to get the rift rewards. Just because you can pay autric cells for it doesn't give it the right to be so damn hard. Those of you who want to pay, good for you. Must be nice having so much money to waste.
---
I had one that basicslly made me crawl after him. Then right as I got to the hatch he picked me up.
---
I mean I didmt expect him to. Hut I was pissed since I crawled for so long.
---
I feel like this one comes to a case of you MUST play with friends and you must ask the killer to help and hope they agree otherwise it simply will not happen
---
Lol, Oni is just a Billy that's easier to loop. But I suppose you think he's too strong or something.
---
They make me avoid red mistery boxes at all cost.
---
Heck yea a battle pass system in a game that already charged for DLC and cosmetics
---
Oni can't get his power unless you let him hit you. But go ahead and join everyone who always say new killers are too strong.
---
Roger roger
---
I hate when the survivors want to farm.  Often, if 1-2 survivors disco'd or suicided early I'd make it clear to the remaining players that they could just do the gens and leave. However I stopped because too often they'd take that to mean "HEY LET'S FARM FOR 10 MINUTES!!" I get they are trying to be nice but honestly I'd rather just move on to the next game.
---
Thanks mate, I really can't be arsed with survivor it's so boring.
---
Outplayed
---
Farmer Joe is back. I wish you could see the killers username in lobby. Make it a toggleable feature for those who don't want it, that way I could broadcast that you don't have to be afraid, I'll happily farm with you &lt;3
---
I cant, Everyone blocks their messages
---
Your right I‚Äôm just bad
---
Alright ya it was pretty rude I apologise.
---
I had a time where I went to grab someone and the game literally froze for a minute and they were still doing the gen and the gen finished up and when the animation stopped freezing he was long gone.
---
The point of survivors just being skins is diversity. The devs have said as much themselves. They want you to see all kinds of different survivors when you play.
---
They don't want a meta to develop where certain survivors are better than others, because then you would just see those survivors all the time. Sort of like how you see Nurse, Spirit and Billy all the time because they're the meta killers.
---
Killers complaining about survivors 
---
Survivors complaining about killers 
---
People who play both sides
---
You mean there are games with no ruin?
---
We can remplace press x by ez skillcheck because hold x if we leave stop hold x just for 1sec. It will be the same thing.
---
So cute
---
You said no infinites and now this seems to imply otherwise, huh.
---
I KEEP GETTING TEAMMATES THAT UNHOOK PEOPLE RIGHT AFTER THE KILLER PUTS THEM ON IT. BY THE TIME 2 MINUTES PASS, THERE‚ÄôS ONLY 3 PEOPLE LEFT. AND OF COURSE THE IDIOT DOING IT IS NEVER A GOOD PLAYER, SO THEY‚ÄôRE DOWNED 1 MINUTE LATER THEN DC
---
Idk some streamers are very bias to be honest. True seems very killer sided and from what I've seen from Scott he seems very survivor sided.
---
How does it run on switch?
---
no, that's a mith. but there are games with more hexes than ruin

Technically Freddy doesn't have claws. He has a glove made of knives, has hands are fairly normal human hands.
---
True
---
Yep I've heard that one
---
No you can still get caught
---
*eye brow wiggling intensifies*
---
I only (not all the time) give hatch when someone unhooks in front of me throwing the game for that player or if someone DCs at a crucial moment
---
Hate to say it but Camping during EGC is really a strategy why would he commit to a chase when he knows your going to come to him
---
I dont really care about maxing it out, theres just a few high tier things i want.
---
Rank doesn't matter to me, let's do it. My gt is CrRagnarok.
---
girls night
---
I've done this a few times, a recent one was a Nurse who got like 3-4 hooks the entire match and I felt bad so I made the come here motion and headed into the basement. They were learning Nurse and I told them they had some pretty good blinks and just needed a bit more practice.
---
BOUGHT THE GAME YESTERDAY.
---
KILLER QUEUES ARE 20 MINUTES LONG.
---
TIME TO CATCH UP ON SOME SHOWS I GUESS.
---
Looks like I‚Äôve gotta grind out some Jigsaw pieces on Myers. Jeez Louise.
---
I was actually able to get a few grabs the other day as Nurse, but that was probably just luck/low rank.
---
Of course, how else would you play Myers
---
Idk why but I feel like the entity made the father appear there just to break the oni. Like maybe thieves didnt steal the body, maybe there was no body &gt;.&gt;
---
Trust me, I know. Here‚Äôs how it goes for me..
---
‚ÄúOh, cool.. hex ruin.‚Äù
---
*finishes totem*
---
‚Äú.. fuck!‚Äù
---
It feels like if you're in red ranks you're fucked for that challenge. Red ranks never get to EGC unless you're the last survivor, and maybeee, two people survive to see the gates powered. 
---
Red rank killers are merciless, and you can't blame them because getting iridescent emblems in red ranks is hard, especially with the rampant DCing.
---
"As the Killer, heal 4 Survivors."
---
*Complete this challenge in a single trial.*
---
Not if you do it right. I can link you a current infinite if you'd like.
---
First step is admitting it.
---
I completed this challenge by pretending I was going to let the last survivor open the exit gate and leave... I ended up pulling them off the lever and hooking them
---
Not hatch necessarily, but as a killer, I sometimes go out of my way to depip myself but let others farm np and such but just not hooking them. I get a few thanks every then and there and get fun out of them by chasing them until they realise it
---
Since there are a lot of mentions, what are the leaked level 4 challenges?
---
4 Megs every game.  Fun.  Variety.  Oh the cosmetics...
---
That's true, i didnt think of that
---
it's either "fuck" for you or for the killer
---
Better run yo ass to the gardening section.
---
They won't. They're hard at work making more cosmetics.
---
Thank you for this.
---
Your ideas are basically countering a lot of killer perks because one killer perk can counter no mither?
---
I think it deserves a buff like fully silence you even when you are on the ground, but that distortion thing and perk countering idea are just a good way to make a 4man swf ruin every killer's game.
---
As someone who plays both sides I hate face camping but sometimes I understand it ( not endorsing it just understand it )
---
They only get worse.
---
Yeah, your additions seem pretty neat as well.
---
But does everyone do it right? No they dont
---
Yeah, or friend bonuses.
---
They made this for having a reason to play. I think. But i think you are right in this point. But not totally trash because player alway play like this. So it just make this more current.
---
Yea 5% speed is fucking huge, my God, huntress would never catch you at a loop.
---
I mostly play SWF and we never Tbag or flash spam
---
Meg would be the only survivor played
---
I feel in order to balance survivors having specific strengths they'd have to have weaknesses to like identity V. For example, Meg would repair generators 15% slower in exchange for vault speed (and the permanent move speed buff is way too much in my opinion). Though BHVR would never do anything like this considering how hard it would be to balance.
---
Then maybe they need to buff other killers to provide more options to the players instead of nerfing all of the decent killers.
---
I agree with this or at the very least have one that is more so survivor and one that is more so killer.
---
Have to think about when other survivors team up to unhook, potential for so many hits during this and chases. Then those who camp tend to tunnel also, so more chases, more hits and more downs. Allows for a kill faster so less people to do gens unless its smart survivors who see a camper and rush gens instead, but that doesn't happen too often. Then this slows the game down and it becomes a cycle until eventually survivors learn the killer is doing this and change their gameplay. That's still a lot of potential for bloodpoints. But regardless this forum has a rant flair so you cant complain if someone posts something to rant about or not, whether you find it important or not
---
Can it include those trash green keys because that seems fairly manageable and finally gives them some use.
---
I think it's worth bringing all of this stuff up and discussing it, so I'm glad you wrote a post like this. It is fundamentally disappointing to me to know that DbD has an unhealthy and dysfunctional community. It's embarrassing, frustrating and ultimately diminishes the social experience of a multiplayer game.
---
It makes me wonder what it is that online games value and how it affects how people approach them. There's the anonymity thing, and the raw ambition of achieving gameplay success and rising in ranks (and, in the youtube era, broadcasting and sharing that success). There's a lot of emphasis on ingenuity and gut reactions to immediately solve problems, and humiliating opponents to achieve irony and humor, and not any on compassion, respect, patience or understanding.
---
It seems there is very little patience or sportsmanship or even mentorship of beginners. It's a sad state to be in. I wonder if it's a personality style of cynicism or jadedness that's attracted to the darkness of the horror genre? Creative and fantasy games like The Sims seem to attract a much more vibrant, creative and interconnected community.
---
Either way, I think there are small steps to take, like supporting Youtube streamers and influencers (and fan-artists/cosplayers) who take the community in a positive direction, as well as trying to learn healthy communication skills (ignoring hate, showing respect, etc.)
---
I know for me, I stay in this game for its creative and multiplayer social aspect, though it is still a chronic disappointment that the majority of communications in this playerbase is abuse and bullying. For me the next "challenge" is taking the steps to move it towards a better direction.
---
In my opinion: Because despite Killers being the power role in the game, the devs have purposefully given them a lot of disadvantages like low vault speed, larger hitbox, camera perspective, the terror radius and just the amount of pallets on a map. This is all fine though, I mean it can't be too easy to catch people or the game would suck.
---
But add all that to the fact that it's 1 player versus 4 players, coupled with really short gen time, and you can see why the killer *needs* some kind of power to give them the advantage.  Survivors don't really have that need in the same way, since they already outnumber the killer and have far more potential for stealth.
---
But I don't think it's "ok" that there's a meta for killers and you only see a handful over and over again. I wish there was more killer diversity, and I tend to play less popular killers. But I definitely don't want to see that happen to survivors too.
---
I play with speakers, not even headphones, and get easy 3k and almost as easy 4k cause tracking with her is a joke, if i slap on headphones chases do end faster even on maps with hard visibility like the cornfields since.She is not hard, i ate shit with her 2 matches before my performance started imrpoving drastically, while with Nurse i still struggled to play her even before her rework (no addons just two blinks) after multiple matches.
---
Id personally like them to all be active at once. It would make it a bit less grindy and some of the harder ones wouldnt be such a ballache
---
Yeah, the more perspectives on it the better. Ones at both extremes of being a heavy survivor player and heavy killer player may know more about the gameplay of each side since they use it more, so a better understanding and more help with it
---
I'm rank 7 solo survivor about to just depip like crazy if I ever get a lobby.  Been waiting 10 plus minutes for a lobby now.  This is pathetic.
---
This rank system just needs to be reworked entirely.  There's no skillset to it on the survivor side.  You can lose every match you play and still reach red ranks just by playing the game.  What's the point?
---
Camping doesnt get many points regardless of what the survivors do but whatever
---
I main killer and I'm fine with survivors doing it at pallets.  It's a pretty good tactic to keep the killer's focus.  Sometimes it even works on me when I know for a fact they're just trying to distract me.  Killers play worse when mad / annoyed so there's at least some tactical advantage to teabagging in game.  At the gate, it's just BM.  Like, the game's over, just leave.
---
Usain Huntress
---
First they nerf our perks, then they nerf our lobby times.  Why am I still here?
---
Only gonna happen when people stop buying tiers and battle passes.
---
90 minutes. Ah yes.
---
Lul r u new or what?
---
Well now everyone's gonna play Meg
---
Perhaps
---
Camping alone maybe  not, but what comes alongside camping yes
---
Finally a reason to see more Quentins
---
 AIDS lol. I totally called it that too. Top 3 worst trophies I've ever had to get. I wish we had the option to murder that opponent lady instead. I swear any time I got a good run going she'd deliberately get near me so her birds would hit me.
---
I know but if you hold or spam to much your x, it will broke. That happen on my controller and i buy a new.
---
But people dont rant about campers for what the killer gains or loses, they rant about it because of what the survivor loses. Campers can end your game so fast so you depip and get little to no bloodpoints. That's why its frustrating, let alone takes the fun away. There definitely needs to be SOMETHING in place that provides a REAL penalty for being near the hook doing nothing (not counting when in a chase)
---
Awesome! Thanks for the quick reply!!
---
Thanks insidious, very cool
---
Pretty much what others said but I think you get a bonus for your first survivor and killer match of the day so try to play one game of each.
---
The new survivor story is written like a bad fanfiction.
---
Again?
---
I wonder if that accident happened because the bond between Frank, Julie, Susie and Joey was so close. Maybe the Entity intended to only take Frank, but sensing his strong connection to the others (if the Legion indeed sees themselves as inseparable best friends), it simply sprawled out and pulled them all in, knowing their capability towards evil was strongest when combined altogether
---
guess killers like scottjund and zubat arent serious killer mains and the spirit reddit killer is. Lol
---
Its all good , I should have known but I was to intrigued lol
---
2 dced when i did the challenge , so sad
---
Endgame collapse is too short tho... its 2 minutes when nobody is down or hooked.  Thats clearly not enough time.  Especially with remember me, and the extended gate time?  way too short
---
I'm just entering green ranks, why should I go against people who are mid purple? They have SO much more time on this game under their belt. Look at the loadouts too, think about me being a baby nurse, it's not just the ranks bud, but they add a lot onto those things.
---
Probably
---
Thank you! I struggle a lot too, don't worry mate
---
Thanks! :)

Exactly. I also didn‚Äôt mention we have to select and activate a challenge in order to complete it. I don‚Äôt think any other game which has battle pass system have this kind of thing. Other games gives weekly challenges and every time you play a game you can complete whichever you want. You can even complete multiple which is not the case for DBD. 
---
Simple solution: Each week we can get 2 weekly challenge sets, one for killer and one for survivor. Both sets consist of 1 master challenge, 2 hard challenges and 4 easy challenges. Easy challenges give 3 rift fragments, hards give 5 and master gives 10(which is one level in battle pass basically). Also you‚Äôll get 3 common challenges which can be completed on both sides, so you‚Äôll have the same challenges on both killer and survivor sets(such as earn 250k blood points)(In total 10 challenges for each sets). They don‚Äôt even need to make it rng based so while I have to repair 20 gens, someone else has to heal others for 10 health state as a week 1 challenge for instance. Maybe they need to increase the total level on the battle pass, but I believe a challenge system like this would be better for DBD, especially if they put the lore in the free battle pass.

I'm talking about the label so you could print it out at home
---
this is some weird tumblr shiz
---
This comment needs to be seen, I legit didnt see Meg til I saw this comment.
---
The only time I give the hatch is when the last survivor realizes how the coming chase is going to go and just goes down without a fight. I love it when people don't waste my time. Wiggle on shoulder or run away when I let you go though, and you're back to going on hook.
---
Yeah there's nothing particularly challenging about it. The only challenging part is testing your sanity and how much time you're willing to play this stupid fuckin game lmao.
---
Lol I was trying to farm Trapper rituals last night and I was chasing a Meg for about 3 minutes before she realized I wasn't trying to kill her. I had a good laugh about it.
---
I don't think that's what they were going for, but I *really* like this theory.
---
Not at all. But okay.
---
you're right.  i always tell people high fps is not even very helpful on dbd (with very very few exceptions like Huntress - and only sometimes)
---
buuuut i play on pc so ofc i play with unnecessarily high fps
---
I‚Äôm aware, but her counter play is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt cleanse‚Äù seems pretty stale to me
---
How do you get those things coming out and killing them? I
---
Quick question I notice hillbilly isn't in your killer list why?
---
I feel like they put zero thought into how these challenges will affect people's behavior game to game.
---
It‚Äôs always the claudettes that cleanse
---
MAY I ASK WHAT THE FUCK THAT NEW ARCHIVES TOME IS? WE WILL HAVE SO MANY TROLLS NOW... AND SOME OF THEM ARE THINGS NOONE WANTS TO DO OR CAN DO
---
well you can already play mobile.  it's a horrible experience, though.
---
Lowest rank you can derank to, not season reset penalties.
---
The guy that gave the reposter gold must be ashamed rn.
---
28 days have passed, so you're a bit behind.
---
If you complete 1 tier a day, with an extra tier on 6 days, you'll be fine.
---
If you want a killer to be weak then play Last Year or Friday the 13th.
---
I mentioned the ones that I see usually, I rarely ever see Billy‚Äôs as of late
---
This, it's not high fps that's important as much as consistent fps. You can have 3000 fps but if you get constant spikes it's gonna feel horrible.
---
Well you‚Äôre IQ seems pretty low and you seem to some what understand what‚Äôs happening. You just proved your own agreement wrong.
---
I had to kill a survivor with him for my daily last night. I hook the first person and they DC immediately, causing the other two to DC. I find the last person in a bear trap and use my yellow mori on her only two minutes from the start of the match lol. Gotta love it.
---
That WOULD add more things to do in the game, not a bad idea at all. Or maybe they can just add P4, P5, and P6?
---
Didn‚Äôt he get any kills from face camping?
---
Same, playing Xbox is like watching a slideshow about DbD
---
Let's be honest, that's some bullshit we've convinced ourselves so we don't lose our sanity.
---
Surviving is the goal, it's always been the goal. Do you throw games and fuck your teammates over because you haven't unhooked anyone yet? I doubt it. What about randomly getting in chases forcing teammates to come save you to satisfy the evader category? Nope.
---
Everyone in every game typically does what they think is best for the team to escape and survive. Surviving is the goal.
---
You're new around here ain't ya
---
I've been a fairly patient supporter of BHVR when people criticise the things they do or the changes they make, but the almost universally negative response to the challenges in this could put the company in a bad place with its playerbase if they ignore what people are saying.
---
The issues aren't just limited to the difficulty of the challenges. It's the reward/difficulty balance, the potential effects on gameplay changes, and the fact that the challenges make the game less fun.
---
I play DBD because I have a good time playing. Regardless if I am trying to accomplish the challenges or complete the rift, if people are changing up the nature of the games just to work on challenges, it's no longer going to be fun.
---
Years and years ago I had a manager who told me that if I had a problem with something, I shouldn't come to her without proposing some solutions of my own. So here's what I'd suggest:
---
Most of the issues that people have could be solved if the challenges did not have to be selected. If the progression "web" was ditched in favour for a "point total" to progress to the end of the tome, it would allow the more difficult challenges to be accomplished when the opportunity arises rather than trying to force them.
---
It would also allow challenges like "complete the equivalent of X generators" to be completed passively. BHVR could even increase the amount of gens required for the challenge (along with the reward) and no one would complain about it.
---
Since people wouldn't have to make major changes to their playstyle to accomplish challenges, the games would remain as is. When people can play how they want to, they continue enjoying the game.
---
This will probably get buried, but that's okay. As long as the community's collective voice is heard, that's the important part.
---
Great post! I too loved the idea of unlocking lore (I'm not fussed on most cosmetics), and I would have been tempted into the Rift Pass (and maybe a few paid Tiers) if I'd made good progress on the Rift while getting all the lore. Sadly, the concept I was sold does not match up with the actual experience.
---
If you compare against the PTB version, they've increased the requirements for Blindsided, Locked &amp; Found, Life Giver, Hungry Jaws, Property Damage, Buried Underground, Obsessive, Got You, and Iridescent Age - almost half of the challenges, and arguably the least ridiculous ones.
---
A Rift Tier takes over 2 hours of play per day, completion of *all* Tome challenges is *required* to move that closer to just 1 hour a day.
---
I can follow the reasoning behind making the Rift difficult to complete (i.e. in order to profit from selling Tiers), but locking lore behind increasingly ridiculous challenges just defies all logic.
---
How does this encourage long-term players to spend money and keep playing? Where's the attraction for new players when they're going to be farmed for Tome challenges every time a new page unlocks? What happens when the Tome is for Clown, or Ash? Anyone looking forward to using their powers and/or perks for several months?
---
I just don't understand why BHVR would do this to their fans and to their customers - we gave feedback and the devs just joked about challenge difficulty on their socials, where is the logic? When the Rift closes we'll still have ridiculous lore challenges, not to mention any ill will or upset from players who had convinced themselves that they were "on track" for Rift completion by playing an hour a day.
---
**I don't know about anyone else, but this has really soured me on the game. It feels like the community is just being made to suffer for suffering's sake.**
---
It‚Äôs not the worst If you have decent internet
---
&gt;And when i do play swf with my friends( ha yes i do have those) **oh boy we dont care at all, we killer deliver to other persons on purpose and more for the laughs**.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;And sometimes the killer will understand how we play and starts to have fun with us instead of really trying to get that 4k or whatever you would imagine.  
---
&gt;Its a game, have fun, dont be rude and accept game mechanics and in return you dont get negativity back.
---
I don't know if this sounds all that fun.
---
Sad thing is I get toxic messages.
---
At least let us work on more than 1 challenge at a time ffs.
---
So excited. Can't wait for the devs to make it easier for people who don't want to play the game to stop. Super excited for the wave of people a week or two after complaining that they got permabanned, and arguing that they "play games to have fun".
---
haha how is this cry baby "i'm a victim wahh" boring ass content upvoted?
---
"Compete with other survivors for a safe unhook as if you're the seagulls from Finding Nemo 25 times"
---
Yeah they can't be serious with these 'challenges'. Most of them are borderline ridiculous and extremely difficult to do, especially in such an erratic game like this one. If you don't farm with the killer, use scummy builds, and have hours of free time on your hands, you're not going to complete this. This level of the tome is hell on Earth for the majority of the playerbase. A couple of people mentioned that they made them this hard in order to make people buy auric cells for the rift. I can definitely see that. To save time and tons of unnecessary effort, people are going to do just that. This is all a cash grab.
---
Imagine seeing the nurse blink on you and start healing you
---
BUT YOU CAN SPEAK THE TRUTH WITHOUT BEING A DICK MY GUY
---
Adiris also hid her infection from the people and possibly infected many more in the process. I know she mostly just was trying to keep her people hopeful but her story definitely has a little bit of "person who gets bit by a zombie and hides it from the rest of the group" in it. So I'd say 95% a good person.
---
What dreams are made of!
---
OH DEAR, NO. I WILL NEVER DO THAT
---
I've been gone for a while,. üòÇ
---
Ah, another example of battle pass greed. Sheep will be Sheep I suppose. 
---
I suggest making a few friends and attempt this challenge.
---
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE A GENUINE AND DEEP CONTEMPT FOR THE PEOPLE HERE AND I DELIGHT IN MAKING IT KNOWN
---
No, I definitely am not, devotion 3 LV 72
---
It's not a guide line kiddo, it's what I personally think. If you want specific examples it's like calling out all of the Killers Perks "drop pallets early they have Spirit Fury and Enduring" calling the exact location of totems "Ruin is in the Harvester by the shack" and changing your perks so that you can keep track of the killer with information that is only helpful in SWF, like dropping a tracking perk for OoO and using that to call the location of traps and if the killer is mind gaming someone in a chase.
---
You can be tilted all you want but perks like OoO that are ass for solo queue and only used when your a sweaty SWF is broken. It's clearly not intended for the game as we dont have voice chat, and it ruins the game.
---
Your counter points like people running to hooks and getting caught is a meme nobody past green ranks actually believes that crap but people cam collectively agree that Sweaty SWF groups whose playstyle revolves around being in a group with voice communication is a unhealthy for the game.
---
You can bitch moan and complain about my opinion all you want but bottom line it's not healthy for an asymmetric PvP game that is balanced around the survivors not having clear ways to communicate to suddenly have the ability to do so.
---
I still hate it tho
---
Can we also get it so that on console we can only mash two buttons instead of using our joysticks to wiggle out? Like my good controller now drifts all the time because of it so if they made it like square and circle are the two mashing buttons, similar to pc, I would love it.
---
You‚Äôre saying the free content is a cash grab? Lol
---
But for real, the challenges aren‚Äôt insanely difficult, they are just fucking stupid.  They are borderline impossible at the beginning because everyone is doing them. And most of those people play extra potato.
---
HEY SURVIVOR CUNTS. YOU DON'T WANT ME TO FARM BASEMENT HOOKS BUT YOU'LL DC IF I PLAY NORMALLY AND TRY AND PUT YOU IN THE BASEMENT. GREAT WORK BHVR!
---
that‚Äôs sick, I wish my mom played video games. She is quite proficient at candy crush &amp; other Facebook games, however.
---
Ok, your personal opinion
---
Agittated lol?
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cleanse‚Äù fun counter-play. Not stale at all. Use your brain, baby killer
---
By saying gg wp
---
not at all. amused
---
It's true! It's true! And the other thing is, my sister had a baby and I took it over because she passed away, and then the baby lost its legs, and its arms and now he is nothing but a stump! But I still take care of it with my wife and it's growing and it's fairly happy. But it's difficult 'cause I've been working a second shift at the factory to put food on the table. But all the love and I see in that little guy's face makes worth it in the end. True story!
---
I have friends that play the game, but these challenges are not playing the game, it‚Äôs farming and hoping everyone agrees. 
---
Besides that point, if I continue to play it tells them that I support this nonsense, so I can‚Äôt in all good faith just farm the missions.
---
I don't think they can nerf Freddy at all right now. The nightmare on elm street rights are switching hands right now, DBD might need permission first too change anything on him, Freddy could be stuck in a similar situation as Jason, where they can't change Jason or his game.
---
"fake phasing" aka "doing nothing". Spirit players have such an outstanding skill level.
---
objective fact
---
Sure
---
Ok
---
TOME 3 CHALLENGES ARE ABSURD
---
THE ‚ÄúWITHIN ONE TRIAL‚Äù THING MAKES THEM BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU ARE PLAYING NORMALLY SO A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL THROW GAMES FOR THEM I CANT STAND THIS SHIT
---
If you buy the rift pass it gives you back auric cells and you can buy the levels with the points you earned. Make sure you play at least 1 survivor and 1 killer game per day and then grind a bit on the weekends. If you only play survivor or killer you wont get the extra daily 300 xp so play both once a day
---
There is nothing worse than accidentally leveling it up past level 1 on a P3 killer.
---
The free stuff isn‚Äôt the cash grab, but they are preying on those who will look at these challenges and knowingly cannot complete them, and hoping they buy levels to complete the pass.
---
Huntress or Clown.
---
The fact BHVR didn't already come up with this speaks to their incompetence.
---
how is it any different than almost any other killer? don't cleanse is just a way to say that she's loopable like almost every other killer. how is it more stale than trapper or legion?
---
As a survivor my only complaint (not much of one anyway)would be the gen teleport animation. Apparently a Freddy model appears out of the ground during the end of it, but Freddy can still cancel the port and it just disappears.
---
Not sure if that‚Äôs intentional, or an oversight.
---
" But it survivors have it too easy, then some minor coordination or comms, and the gen will be hell for the killers. Survivors would abuse nerfed killers with that, and the killers would be the one not worth playing at all. "  
---
Again, I never said anything about making it too easy for survivors. I said I want to reach that 50% ratio so the game is actually *fair* for survivors. You think it's fun to play as a survivor knowing your chance of escape is *less than 50%*? If one crappy player means your team gets snowballed, why would survivor be worth playing? Think about why DC'ing is such an issue. People loooooooove to think that it all has to do with a bad attitude when reality there's often not a point in staying in a snowball game where the killer gets an auto win because one player supremely messed it all up.   
---
"It is impossible to make the killer match both an individual optimal survivor, and an entire team of those at the same time."  
---
Neither is it ideal to make the game favor one side over the other and punish solo players.  
---
" You see the point? "  
---
No.  
---
"If one/two survivor were to determine the game, four of them would leave absolutely zero chance for the killer to do anything, let alone kill or just enjoy the game."  
---
And you fail to see the reverse of this. If ONE survivor determined the failure of the survivor team, it would kill the game for the other survivors. It's not worth playing that game.   
---
"Asymmetrical games were always hard to balance because of the trade off between solo and full team experience. One or the other, no in-between."  
---
'Hard' does not mean 'impossible'. There may not be a simple answer but favoring killers is certainly *not* the answer.   
---
"But then, you would have to heavily nerf the SWF"  
---
When are people going to give up on this moot argument? Seriously, stats they gave out months ago, less than 6% of games are 4-man SWF games. The number in the most recent release INCLUDE that 4%, and win rates for killers are STILL above 50%. In fact, the survival rate of parties with 4 member is still [UNDER 50%](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/). The beauty of it is that SWF actually gets the survival rate CLOSER to 50% than any other SWF combination, while still not crossing that line. It actually makes the game more *fair* for survivors. You've all lost this argument, SWF does not need nerfs, LET IT GOOOOOOO.
---
Is there a reason he isn't on switch?
---
Me trying to git gud at console Nurse.
---
I think the devs should make it so theres a visual queue when shes phasing, that'd be a nice touch.
---
Ah. I forgot you can buy levels like a dingus. 
---
Just pay us another $75 to skip everything. :)
---
Good action.
---
Did you do the icones of perk and abilitie yourself ?
---
Yes lol
---
oh shit sorry, i forgot that you have a better idea of my mood than i do
---
sorry my lord
---
Perhaps, but it does state that they only ventured into the fog to look for Frank.
---
It's kinda funny too since devs are meant to be against farming and verbally teaming up to gain more in the game but the challenges encourage that
---
It‚Äôll definitely be different for her. She‚Äôs more use to games on her phone, but she‚Äôs wanted a PS4 for awhile now. But we shall see
---
Indeed, no worries about forgetting that, in all honesty it shouldn‚Äôt even be an option, but here we are =).
---
In that case it sounds like it was definitely an accident on the Entity's part. I wonder what it offered them to get them to kill.
---
this is some dank copypasta, hold on
---
I can stand behind this, especially for an New Years event cosmetics or something.
---
I mean, you can just not do the challenges, its exactly the same game. You dont need to do them
---
Trapper, sabotage traps. Legion, spread out. Plague, don‚Äôt cleanse and be broken or cleanse and give her a projectile. Can‚Äôt sabo the pools can‚Äôt do anything except get broken. She‚Äôs literally different from every other killer. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs loopable‚Äù cool every killer is. Her counter-play specifically to her power is stale as all hell.
---
&gt;The fact that survivors are so diverse is because the players want to.
---
&gt;Otherwise everyone would play Claudette, she‚Äôs small, doesn‚Äôt make a lot of noice and is known as blendette so killer lose sight of her more easily.
---
If you aren't a stealthy player, you don't care about all this which is why the majority of the community plays whatever they feel like. 
---
Pretty much everyone starts as Claudette but once you realize DBD is more about running than hiding, you start branching out to shirtless Davids or Neon Neas.
---
I got bad news for you. Tome 4 leaked weeks ago, and it's fucking ridiculous
---
Same here. Except when it finished the grab animation I somehow got teleported into the basement with no survivor. Thanks BHVR..
---
jesus christ you people have to sweat every game every day? you cant run new builds for a while or try other strategies to complete them? i just did this one without even trying very hard, all it took was a potato team i went against. i just carried them over there with agitation. i do not understand the bitching over a challenge. just dont even bother with them or just get them passively over time. youve NEVER hooked two people at once? you cant play with one different perk? lmao just dont do them then
---
That's a good point.
---
Level 4 is 3 safe unhooks during egc... just sayin yeah ppl will definitely farm with killer for that
---
does she like horror? I hope she likes the game!
---
Lisa Sherwood
---
It's positive that you get a kill or get fed hook trades when you otherwise had no other options. You can be upset about it, but killers don't have much else to do once the gates are powered unless they have some way to track survivors.
---
Ghost face... oh wait
---
Thanks EA! :D
---
holy fuck you think something you don't have to buy, or engage in at all, and still benefit from a free pass is a money grab lmfao
---
On Steam (PC) you can open the "recent players tab" and you'll see the 3 other survivors and then a 4th name for the killer.
---
But you cared enough to voice your opinion instead of ignoring it so who really has the spicy armpits?
---
100% it was due to their bond that it occurred, it‚Äôs pretty much stated in the description that the three went looking for Frank after he didn‚Äôt show up for a while. Entity knowing it or not the bond they shared did end up keeping them together
---
Just copying what I said in another thread:
---
Honestly just get rid of ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù challenges. Then they can be as hard as you like and you can slowly chip away at them over time. The only really objectionable ones imo are the master challenges which have completely ridiculous requirements or are essentially luck based.
---
Like honestly you could make it four or five unhooks during egc and just remove the dumb ‚Äúin a single trial‚Äù requirement. It‚Äôll still take a long while to get probably, but it‚Äôll be attainable. As it stands I have no motivation to even try some of these challenges.
---
you just change your location or store country.  it's not available in the US but I have it.
---
I wanna say it‚Äôs keep the exit gates closed while using the perk. As in if you 4k with 1 gen up you get the challenge
---
By playing Legion in red ranks
---
Borrowed Time
---
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
---
And it‚Äôs free lmao.
---
I tried using a VPN but had no luck. I guess I'd have to do something else.
---
Ha, thanks dude!
---
you absolutely can complete them if you want to. were you under the impression this was for casual players or something?
---
Well thats why i said sometimes. Not all the killers want to do silly things and just focus on killing us. I would say its like every 8th killer from 10 does this.
---
 Then again even if the killers want to play their normal game, we just don include them then and have our own laughs. 
---
And for last it depends, if we recognize the killer really sweaty we do play normal tho
---
He's Clown with no Reload, Gen Teleportation,  map wide addon slowdowns, and a built in anti-BT mechanic.
---
They offer new content, players get excited, they offer awesome new lore, players get excited!
---
Then they hide it all behind outrageous missions, players no longer excited. I‚Äôll personally never be able to unlock half the lore with these ridiculous requirements, which is what I was looking forward too.
---
Who is it tho
---
&gt; Legion, spread out
---
wow how interactive and interesting lmfao
---
you have nothing, kid
---
git gud. she's just mid tier jesus fucking christ
---
Oh, so we're comparing playtimes now?
---
[https://imgur.com/a/HjTULc9](https://imgur.com/a/HjTULc9)
---
I got almost 2500 hours on the game, almost exclusively play killer (except friends ask me to play with them), I'm rank 1 every single season (I'm actively playing) and I got almost every achivement in the game, and I'm saying that, amongst all killers, spirit is one of the hardest. So it's my word against theirs. Who's correct now?
---
I love this
---
then don't fucking buy it? holy shit do you fuckers have no self control at all? has FOMO seriously rotted your brains to this extent?
---
David wasn't being toxic he was trying to distract the killer from the person on the ground long enough for them to get out.
---
He was just trying to take a hit.

And then you get t3 after 4 gens

Every single time. I simply can't imagine what these survivors are doing when DW is so safe at this point.
---
Survivors can't see your name though
---
My guess would be that it had to be something specifically for Frank since he basically determines what the rest of the group does, so going from there I‚Äôd say maybe something that Frank doesn‚Äôt have like a proper parental figure since his adoptive father really only kept him around for the paycheque and didn‚Äôt bother properly taking care of him.
---
And I forgot that you know better what I experience ingame
---
Sorry proffesor
---
gets downvoted for suggesting a way to complete it and having a normal discussion
---
this sub is super entitled its kinda sad
---
She does actually! She‚Äôs honestly the reason why I love horror so much. Growing up I‚Äôd always watch scary movies with her
---
I think a Huntress movie would be really scary. A Trapper one could be cool too!
---
How do I get two unhooks during egc as a solo survivor or even a swf? Console players cannot message the killer to ask for help on this one so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get it by 2025 if I keep at it!
---
i clearly do. you poor thing
---
Got 3 iridescent emblems last game as legion and it only gave me 1 of them towards my goal ofn15...
---
they dont even bring items most the time in my games. and its good practice for things you may not normally do. theres nothing wrong with difficult challenges
---
Man I wish the killers I main could win my standing still.
---
Billy brought a jigsaw piece, 200 iq
---
Um, who said I bought it? I haven‚Äôt bought it, merely disagreeing with the way the game is heading after years of being a loyal player and customer, I have many hobbies, maybe you need a few as well? So angry over an internet post.
---
&gt; How do I get two unhooks during egc as a solo survivor or even a swf?
---
have you seriously never done this before? it's not too uncommon for killers to not have anyone dead and have one hook while the gates are open. get that person down, and usually someone else will go down in their place or the same person will and you can get them too. you all are such cry babies who don't even want to try. entitled brats
---
Nurse because it would show her slowly descend in madness , it would be like joker or something
---
Where are the official stats? Are we talking about that chart? Because that seems to imply clown is good with a 60% kill rate. Everyone says Clown is shit because they can't adapt to his playstyle which is herding and ending loops faster, and don't want to give him a solid try. 
---
I literally said numerous times that Clown revolves around finding survivors, downing them with his power that often forces pallets to be dropped faster, and using the bottles to herd them away from running to X spot to avoid risking a hit, but it seems that it goes right over your head, and others who read it.
---
&gt; ~~Teabagging me 2-3 meters from the exit?~~ Nah, your dead now, say bye to those escape points you denied yourself 
---
The dude was taking a hit trying to distract from the downed survivor.
---
I agree with you 100 percent and upvoted for visability!
---
Yes you can. On ps4 you hold down the PlayStation button, go to where it says dead by daylight and current players. The players name who isn't in your lobby as a survivor is the killer. Click the name and message them.
---
holy fuck so you're screaming and crying over something that cost you nothing

entitled brat confirmed

&gt; maybe you need a few as well?

oh i have tons. wanna hear them?
---
Now both the noise AND the comment are cursed, way to go OP
---
It's haunted grounds
---
*naked and afraid*
---
I'm surprised I've never seen SWF do cleansing parties. If survivors wanted to spend the time they can flip all of the fountains within 2 minutes making everyone healthy. infect gen/locker/etc cleanse re-infect cleanse,etc run it with 3 other people you can hit every pool within 2 minutes.
---
Chill, it's only a game
---
That makes sense too. He did get everyone else to stab that security guy.
---
Feel like a big boy putting people down? Bet you have a big peeepee too.
---
Can we all agree survivors who instasave like that deserve to be outted to the killer in every match?
---
Sure, you can three gen. That still doesn't help the case, because people will figure it out and continuously run away from the basement and gens so you can't reach it. That happens EVERY time that I do a 3 gen.
---
I *wish* I could give this Reddit Silver.
---
Can you speak to killers in the lobby?
---
My way is to throw hatchets until they have the balls to stand still.
---
if you ask me getting as fucking offended as you and teh other reddit survivors are over this is the real cringe
---
oh my god someone played a way in a fucking video game you didn't like. better add this person to your creepy forum user spreadsheet so you can cry about it later!
---
Depends ig, I play survivor and killer and don‚Äôt like farming for either, but I have sympathy if they‚Äôre doing it for the tome or a daily
---
I'm not a fan of it.
---
I know why they do it, but honestly I don't like farming too much, I makes me lose interest and just feels like a farm simulator for me.
---
But I'm not a super consistent player, so I'm not very good and I know they'll probably let me go if I play along
---
No one:
---
"Casual players":
---
Make it a Susie and I'd be down to buy it, maybe give her white or red hair for it
---
im in console red ranks on xbox, but regardless thats just our own experiences and does not add up to the entire game experience as a whole. some people may find them boring but theyre totally optional and definitely do-able.  theres a lot of strategies to get them done. its only been a couple hours.
---
25 unhooks and 2 basement hooks (4 in 1 trial in 4 level) is not a Challenge, its luck or farm based bullshit
---
My first game with him was a nightmare....they all escaped. I was a hardcore noob lol
---
I didn‚Äôt think about that part lol üòÇ I‚Äôll just make her cleanse totems lol
---
I thought they awarded legacy in patch 1.3.0? It was locked before then
---
just fyi, that other person who replied to you, weirdodin, is going to make a note of this post and if they ever see you again they will bring this up in an attempt to undermine whatever you're saying
---
what about throwing games just so I can have a chance of completing a challenge
---
/u/frankwest21cp bro wtf
---
not true at all, there is some luck and skill involved there. go watch some youtube videos for ideas on how to do one like that.
---
So I play on PS4 and they can click your username and direct message you.
---
or you could just do them while you play?
---
I‚Äôm mandolorian, just watching and waiting with my borrowed time.

Oh.
---
The skill check practice includes ruin ones, doctor ones, the small ones that come up for brand new parts and overcharge. 
---
For the randomiser you pick what characters you have, perks, items and add ons and it selects a build for you
---
Section for all killer perks and a section for all survivor perks with what they do
---
Character profiles with their backstory and the list of teachable perks that they have. Helps when wanting to know which characters have which perks or when you stumble across an unknown perk in game and want to understand what it is, or if you simply forget
---
ItS ToO HaRd
---
yeah but it's easier to relate or enjoy playing survivor if they have actually different mechanics. It would make playing survivor alot deeper
---
My god, how?
---
Killers are more camping on console, bc u can‚Äôt be flamed if strangers can‚Äôt message u. And I hate itttttttt
---
I think it‚Äôs protected by a copyright owned by MTV.
---
Damn Blendettes
---
Having perks "Defaulted" to the specific survivors would make them all unique.  
---
I.E.:  
---
DS is only Laurie perk and nobody else can get it, and it's not a teachable.  
---
Lithe is a Feng Min Only  
---
Balanced - Nea
---
and so on. Same for killers. Why would that be better?  
---
No more whining "this is op with this killer and his ability", "survivors only use meta builds", survivors and killers would have to LEARN how to play using certain character, and there would be a larger variety of killers and survivors around the game.
---
This is just a thought, probably flawed, but if put time into and thought out, it could work.
---
The mori is him marrying the survivor and chopping his head off 'cause they won't give him a son
---
That‚Äôs not positive i‚Äôm talking about
---
The concept mostly applies at higher ranks and for experienced players who can loop the killer for a long time. If you cleanse, looping is no longer really an option, because she can hit you from range and through windows, over pallets, etc. Whereas if you don‚Äôt cleanse, yes, you‚Äôre injured, but good players will still be able to loop her for quite a while, as she‚Äôs essentially an m1 killer with no power at that point. Theoretically, this is why not cleansing is better, but not all survivors can loop well enough to actually make this happen all the time, so not cleansing can sometimes work in the Plague‚Äôs favor. It all depends on the team imo.
---
Doesn't work anymore
---
Why thank you
---
Then don‚Äôt 3 gen yourself don‚Äôt rush through gens so fast you screw yourselves

Imagine blinking when you can just parkour :D
---
Yay

Ooh you have kate
---
My favorite survivor
---
This, everyone is bombing hooks as am i. Me and this Dwight rushed into the basement for the unhook, he stepped into a trap and i got the unhook. We both ended up hooked in the basement.
---
I give hatch if im trying to complete a daily or challenge abd i finish it or have no way to, then i just give them hatch cause i dont care for pips that match
---
Mercy from god
---
Yeah, pisses me off. I get about 1/3 no hook noobs, but it's to be expected when ur a high rank like me, 1/3 campers and only a third are actually fun to play against bc they're decent, some of those utterly destroy high rank me though lol
---
I don't facecamp, but I camp close enough to give the survivors a false sense of hope that they have a chance of unhooking and I don't hook in the basement unless I'm really close to the basement. I do get annoyed when a survivor is basically spamming m1 to be like "don't unhook me" and 1 or 2 survivors come to jack off over how good they are then those survivors that do that complain in end game chat like "WAAA CAMPING KILLER YOU SUCK" when they fucked themselves over in the first place.
---
1: Kitsune masks existed long before anime and manga did. It‚Äôs origin is from japan and not from naruto. I haven‚Äôt even watched that show. 
---
2: The new killer is a samurai from japan, so that‚Äôs why I chose to make a kitsune legion skin. 
---
3: I chose a martial arts uniform not because I‚Äôm a weeabu (which I‚Äôm not) but because, again, JAPAN.
---
Actually true. It really depends for me..80% of the time it's fine and 20% it's godawful lol
---
Better then Ruin? Nah not at all Corrupt only works against survivors who will actually do gens against it but most of the time they just go immersed until the timer is up and unless you have Whispers you shit out of luck
---
Misleading title, I see no Yamaokas in there.
---
Most wholesome feeling ever
---
Blood has always been the prestige reward. Legacy was added as a bonus for those that had managed to prestige before they reworked the bloodwebs
---
i want him to cut my head off üò©üí¶
---
I've never thought about this and I don't think he would fully fit in the game, but it would be really awesome to have him, I really love Davy Jones and since he already has weird abilities in the movies it wouldn't be too hard to design a power for him
---
First off useless? It‚Äôs a great slow down perk and can get you early game chases and 8 seconds is a good amount of time to stop survivors from just tapping a gen you just kicked imagine Pop with this
---
I got idea how yo do any of it:
---
-play like a cunt
---
-get lucky
---
-farm with other side
---
Totally not that i expect

That‚Äôs if survivors 3 gen themselves
---
I know you just want to grab a Claudette by her neck with her pincers and murder her face with your tentacle beard. ;)
---
I had the opposite happen. Was playing a game with a ghost face and was the last survivor (team was trash) then as he got me down I wiggled and  got hooked and it was so close to being full. The ghost face messages me ‚Äúif you didn‚Äôt wiggle I would‚Äôve given you the hatch‚Äù like fuck off im not here to play your stupid games or follow your stupid little rules. Either give me the hatch or don‚Äôt.
---
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I was thinking the other guy was saying that you could get legacy prestige at game launch which I know isn't the case.
---
Agree with that
---
I've seen dozens of people say this. I remember even seeing people post on Reddit that killers who don't let the last survivor go are lame.
---
This especially heated up when BHVR was trying to figure out what to do with the hatch.
---
[Nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYt0WbDjJ4E)
---
I will try this now
---
Its a common grammatical error, whose to blame OP? I‚Äôm sure there grammar is usually fine.
---
Thanks for the reminder, i completly forgot about challenges!
---
Hope it helps!
---
Cool concept. I too am a fan of the remake.
---
I like the idea because I use the same perks and try to get the same perks for everyone and it gets repetitive
---
Sssh don't burst his bubble
---
Yeah, I wanted to use her and bought her. Then I found that out and was sad.
---
The totem is only activiated during EGC, and that's only if there is a dull totem somewhere on the map; so that means if survivors clense all totems on the map then you have no way of getting the challenge done.
---
I wonder if it needs to be active or not
---
What if the series was about all of them but just 1-2 episodes for each?
---
Thanks! Downloading it now. I've gotten to the point where I dont miss normal skill checks unless I'm looking at someone in the distance or scratching my nose, and I do get perfect sometimes but I need practice with ruin lol
---
You mean the past 3 resets? Not **every** reset.
---
&gt;Why are you making up "my point"
---
I'm not "making up your point", I'm telling you your point doesn't mean what you say it does.
---
&gt;Nothing in my logic suggests that.
---
Your logic: 1. red ranks contains only killers that can maintain that kill rate, 2. Anything less and you drop out of red ranks, 3. and no longer contribute to the stats
---
1. All average killers maintain the kill rate that you postulate is necessary to reach red ranks, as the stats tell us. So all average killers should end up in red ranks.
---
2. You only drop out of red ranks with depips if you are at rank 4 without pips.
---
3. Rank 4 depips contribute to red rank stats. Then you do not contribute to the red rank stats until you are back there, which you will be, logically.
---
&gt;a criteria for a category that obviously the people in that category will fulfill that criteria
---
The criteria is kills, not pips. People in red rank fulfil pip critera, which are not kill criteria. And killers globally fulfil the "at least 2 kills" criteria.
---
&gt;So to be clear, you're arguing that the fraction of players in red ranks that bounce in and out of rank 4 are statistically significant
---
No, you are doing that. You argue that "anything less and you drop out of red ranks and no longer contribute to the stats". With that statement, you are saying killers that cannot maintain that kill rate will drop out of red ranks and thus not contribute to the stats. But for that to happen, they have to have gotten to red ranks in the first place. So every killer that gets to red ranks but cannot maintain the "at least 2 kills" kill rate there has to necessarily drop out of red ranks. Since we have established that *all* killers average more than 2 kills, there will be tons and tons of killers inevitably ranking up due to maintaining that average kill rate (especially if we follow your logic that such a kill rate equals pips). So either countless average killers are still doing more than well enough in red ranks once they get there, or if they are not, they are getting there and dropping out again countless times. And that would statistically be significant, it would be tons of "less than 2 kills" depip-out-of-rank-4 results that should weigh the red rank average down a lot. So either that is not happening or the kill rate of killers that actually stay in red rank is even higher than the numbers to make up for the dropouts.
---
&gt;Do some reading on survivorship bias
---
Let's look at the inverse of these kill rates. They would necessitate survival rates in red ranks of 25-40%. But ranking up to red rank and maintaining red rank also "requires" surviving. So is there not a literal survivorship bias for survivors, that those that reach red rank should also have survival rates above 50%, because if you are not even surviving in half of your games, how are you getting to and maintaining red rank? And this would be a paradox, since the kill rate and survival rate cannot both be above 50%. And before you say "you don't need to survive in more than half of your games to get to nor to maintain red rank", then right back at you: "you don't need to always kill at least 2 survivors to get to nor to maintain red rank".
---
I agree that these stats do not tell us a whole lot about balance, and even less about core game balance (which I do think is survivor-favoured), but they do outright tell us that killers in red rank do kill more than 2 survivors on average. So even if I were to agree with you and say "well of course, to get to red rank they have to do so to begin with", the killers that *are* there *do* perform that well - they outperform the survivors there, on average. So it is entirely valid to use these stats to say "it is possible as a killer to perform well in red ranks, most of the players that get there do". Which breaks with the idea around here and elsewhere that playing killer in red ranks means you are getting bullied and lose all the time. If you get to red rank as killer, chances are you will perform well there, since on average a killer that gets there does. It can also be stated that globally, the game is statistically killer-sided.
---
It also justifies flash light clicking, teabagging, just about anything that isn‚Äôt legit cheating.
---
So it says the rift will close soon. Does it mean it will close forever or for a while cause that sucks if it does
---
You hate to see it....
---
They can be window/pallet/hook grabs as well, not just gens. So not as bad as it seems
---
Such a huge trolling
---
I think you can still finish the challenge even if the perk does not activate.
---
Similar to all the other perk challenges, as long as you have the perk slotted and you make 2 sacrifices during the end-game, you will complete the challenge regardless of NOED being active or not.
---
For Xbox there is a recent players tab if you press the home button. It wont tell you who the killer is but their GT will be there
---
Looks like BHVR just try to force ppl play this game more and more.
---
Latest emblem system force to play both sides ineffectively to prolong matches as much as possible, cause issues with core of the game they cant fix.
---
Level 3 challenges either just dumb grind (40 damage actions, escape in 10 trials, heal 15 times, etc), or forced farm (5 traps), or simply stupidly hard (grab 6 times? whoever do not finish it until Beads nerf, say bye-bye to ever complete it, 2 safe unhook in EGC, forcing to start EGC if someone in chase and trade hooks)
---
I'll probably wont even bother, Lore isnt so interesting so far to stress myself into such grind and sweat.
---
oh i have seen a few 
---
but not as much as there should be and none with sleepy boi
---
Even more reason for this not to be used
---
Hope it helps you! Pretty sure it has a high score thing too and levels? Cant really remember much
---
*take her to the moon for me...*
---
Map offering
---
&gt;ItS ToO HaRd
---
The killer challenges are alright since it only requires your input. Survivor challenges require other survivors and a willing killer that can camp someone to death or simply slug them. 
---
See the difference?
---
If you have not seen absolute best killers (Otz etc) playing against SWF and struggling to do well, then you would understand why it is the issue.
---
Similarly, DbD is seen competitive (at least more than Last Year, Friday etc). Compare it to some other competitive game. Ex. League of legends. Sure most of the people don‚Äôt even reach high ranks. Yet, it is still heavily balanced around the top 1% of players. Why?
---
Referring back to the DbD: Imagine killer power level as 1-2-3 or 4 sticks (each stick equals to one decent survivor).
---
If you make it 1, then even moderate teams will have no hard time beating the killer. Then, somewhere around 3 would be the answer? However, if you get the survivor lobby of reasonably experienced (know how to kite well, do gens effectively) and/or with communication, then it means survivor team will have a power level of 3-4. However, if the optimal survivor lobby is about 4, and the killer‚Äôs maximum potential is only 3, it would mean that the killer will eventually lose against that team (simply because of the power level we assigned). 
---
Hence, to play against the survivor lobby with power level = 4 fairly, killer should also have 4 (so the chances are intended 50%). However, now it would mean the the killer would stomp all the other lobbies of power level equal/below 3, but would have a fair fight against the lobby of power 4. However, if the killer is lower than 4, it would mean almost a guaranteed win for the survivors and the abuse of the killer in some ‚Äúrare occasions‚Äù (which happens quite often at the rank 1). 
---
You see. It is conceptually impossible to make it fair, simply because of the uneven power levels of the killer and survivors (But, unlike the killer, who‚Äôs effectiveness depends solely on themselves, survivor‚Äôs power level is highly affected by other players on the team over whom you have no direct influence, making it so difficult).
---
REPOST
---
Great now I‚Äôm crying. Thanks buddy.
---
bloodhunts (2x's XP) happen often.
---
I just kill the person who gets unhooked, I like to punish their whole team for farming. If they want me to kill someone in the first 3 minutes then I will
---
Like if ‚Äúcapitalizing on survivor‚Äôs mistakes‚Äù ever meant relying on them.  Nobody ever said to base yourself only on mistakes, it has been said however to take advantage of them whenever they do happen, as this and playing optimally are not mutually exclusive at all.
---
Yea something like that
---
Yeah, specially now that everyone is grinding hooks or kills or other challenges for the rift
---
yes
---
Okay, what the fuck Behavior. So many of these challenges encourage shitty gameplay behaviour (basement camping, noed, spine chill no hooks) or require ridiculous luck in order to finish them in a reasonable amount of games (2 egc unhooks). Give us challenges that require us to either play different but are reasonably doable in 5 or so games OR games that just reward us for playing without taking forever (like 10 unhooks across many games).
---
Ugh I just can‚Äôt do the survivor ones. So many hook saves!!!! The 40 pallet breaks is done in 2 rounds of Freddy and it‚Äôs fun
---
i got the ps4 one a while back and got hag and doc
---
i havent asked them
---
A clown outfit that makes him look a like a theatrical fat prince would fit both his cosmetic design and would be definitely interesting. 
---
Wish the skin of his Clown bottles would be turned into vintage bottles of English Wine.
---
I found a Trapper who wanted to do the challenge and was trying to get a Nancy to step in his trap. The Nancy didn't understand so I jumped in it for him lol
---
I played maybe 6 games before I went to work today. Out of that 6, four of them were Killers trying to farm. I like this change for now, Its very peaceful
---
That can be false but uncertain. Reminder that you can bring other perks to assist you and don't fully sometimes require to proceed the activity from the start like healing with Botany Knowledge or repairing generator with Dark Sense.
---
Again, this can be crucial but someone has to confirm this to be clear. This can be done by A. Doing the challenge anyway but have to proceed making it 2 sacrifices while Endgame has been activated and while Noed just required to be in the perk slot or B. 2 Sacrifices in Endgame while totem MUST be untouched.

---
oh thats dirty
---
I needed to do the blind challenge but I'm very bad at using the torch. The killer was ghost face who let me blind him for the challenge and then farmed with us.
---
Unless you play forever Freddy. If you play forever Freddy ur a *nerd*
---
HOLY SHIT! I didn't knew that
---
I had 2 rounds in the swap were I coudln't find it and I passed every area as Mikey. I guess that explains it.
---
"Pig = Upvote"
---
This isn‚Äôt an attack but tbh, I‚Äôve considered this idea before in my head and I really don‚Äôt think that there is any reason to implement it. For one, I want to be able to play my favourite character using a perk from somebody else. And secondly, a good perk build is significant in this game, so to limit it to other characters will make such builds pointless, regardless how meta it is. DBD is unbalanced but I have doubts that this is the solution we need.
---
Well, it's a totem based perk.
---
I just fear the outcome.
---
Take it this way, you hook someone and look around to see 2 or possibly more people standing nearby the hook and waiting for you to leave... would you? I damn well wouldn't if it meant that it would keep them from doing an objective.
---
Or the killer can just protect the 3 gens for the entirety of the game and force a 3 gen. Combine that with high rolling maps like Suffocation Pit or high rolling gen placements on Backwater Swamp where it‚Äôs nearly impossible for the survivors not to 3 gen themselves
---
NO YOU DONT, STOP IT
---
&gt;  I guarantee you by the time people get a game where they unhook two survivors in EGC (something literally is down to chance), they will get enough xp to get more than 5 rift tokens.
---
I do it fairly often. not every game, but there's no reason you should expect to be able to reliably do all these in the first game you play anyway. 
---
people keep biotching about how all these things are so hard that no one would be able to do them, but I've done them all many times before the rift existed. and so far, I've done the ones that were released with a week and a half to spare befoe the next tome comes out. and there's still like 50 days to go.
---
Fair enough. 
---
Maybe. Good input though!
---
I see what you did there
---
that's some James bond spy move shit right there.
---
I'm pretty sure that it will interact like most other perks since it does not specifically mention anything about it being broken.
---
Even in the worse case scenario, I am pretty sure as long as it activates atleast once then the challenge is available and usually NOED will activate during the game. The only issue is guaranteeing 2 sacrifices as survivors tend to leave immediately if the killer uses NOED. Might want to combine it with Remember me.
---
The demogorgon with christmas hat would be too adorable, I couldn‚Äôt play serious then probably running after him and die, but it‚Äôs so cute lol
---
Good idea.
---
Trapper. He's the face of DBD.
---
It's a one time only perk that blocks them.just at the start and is then gone, sure you maybe can do some good combinations but it's mostly a nothing perk and a waste.
---
Yeah 8 seconds are laughable, you're being busy walking/sneaking/running away anyway, what does it matter if you wait 8 seconds.
---
How would pop be affected by this? Pop reduces a certain amount immediately since the last change, if they tapping it or not, the progression is gone.
---
Oh! It‚Äôs one of those stories with a lesson in it I see.
---
Some killers who do that let them open the gate for extra points before throwing them on a hook.
---
What is a claw, but a knife hand?
---
They absolutely do not, *and they also don't care.*
---
As someone that‚Äôs had this used against me and used on me, rip my frenemy
---
I quit immediately, not getting reported/banned by another survivor.

That‚Äôs smart of you, every game now is nothing but Trapper. It‚Äôs starting to get repetitive. Would play killer, but tired of the teabags
---
but 
---
wait
---
im scared
---
Is it though? Survivors farming you for the unhook challenge, killers camping the basement? These things do happen but not as often as they are now for the missions.
---
EXACTLY! Unhooking in my face and then complaining about tunneling? Sorry mate, you just killed your friend and possibly yourself if you did such unhook.
---
But putting yourself in that situation should automatically put you at a loss.
---
It's like fuck off this ain't no charity loser get the pity dick out of your mouth and deal with it. 
---
I swear survivors have like over 500 rules that involve in, "if this happens then the killer should do this". "He needs to NOT do this if I do this". It's pathetic seeing survivors act that way. It makes the game unplayable at times.
---
Its all i can think of after a game where killer farmed and i got no unhooks cause literally  every one decided they deserved it more and then sandbagged me to get more unhooks
---
What was the price of greed? Everything.

I literally got carried by him for longer than the match was looking for the hatch. Id already given up, left to make a sandwich, came back and bros still looking for the hatch. Of course Im going to thank him.
---
The Legion or Plague.
---
Not home and I cant really check. Just wanted to know if anyone had a date
---
Yeah. But if no one wants to farm, then it turns into a total cesspool. I did the first killer regular and master challenges already, but now I'm on 15 basement hooks. What does this mean? Agitation and Iron Grasp and basement proxy camping. 
---
I don't like playing like a dick. But lore is gated behind these and I just want to do them as fast as possible. Honestly, challenges that required you to play X amount of games with a perk, or required chase time, or even that required you to take pallet stuns would be much better. Because they happen naturally. Not forced basement hooks.
---
Ganks are a bitch
---
How dare people do the objectives! /s
---
It is your opinion that kills are a bad measure of quality of performance, but you are in the minority in that opinion. The devs themselves have always reiterated that they balance the game based on the principle that on average there should be 2 escapes and 2 kills each round. The data suggests that more than 2 kills are happening each round so by BHVR's definition killers are over-performing.
---
I mean, I still haven't done the Plunderers Master Challenge because I was dumb enough to prestige the one character I had the perk with before checking if anyone else had it lmao.
---
I PLAY KILLER ON CONSOLE. I JUST WANT A GOOD WAY TO IDENTIFY I‚ÄôM DOWN TO CHALLENGE FARM.
---
Uhm... Maybe something more like... "When Feng leave a generator, the killer cannot kick it for 10 seconds" or something
---
agree

Hello, BHVR employee. Here is literally the first article that came up on Google when I typed in "westworld fallout shelter". Within it, you will see that Bethesda called out BHVR for wholesale copy-pasting the code, and confirmed it when they identified a bug in Westworld that was identical in an early version of Fallout Shelter.

---
Flashlight clicking is seen as a sign of agression, like the killer equivelent of cat calling. But instead of conatruction workers calling out a random woman on the street, it's a survivor taunting someone with a deadly weapon. It's generally not a good idea.
---
Yes ! Poor boy deserves more love &lt;3
---
One of my buddies suggested a match where we don't touch gens, but just play hide and seek.  Could be fun.
---
Same, I'll just try to do the normal ones and have the dumb ones selected if I have nothing else to do in the tome :/ too bad.

This is a great description, thanks

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, Goodluck winning a 3 man five gen

I like it. Seems like a good idea

Survivors don't need special abilities, end of story. Perks and tools are enough.
---
Might give this a try. Kind of get bored using the same perks sometimes

The Oni looks terrifying. I can't wait, but at the same time I think I'm gonna be screaming every time he's on me. Especially when he activates his rage mode.

Btw, I didn‚Äôt even hook camp nor tunnel and this person had DS, when I was about to hook somebody, they got rescued and with my BBQ, I found them and killed them, ladies and gentlemen, that is not tunneling
---
Its ok. Go to twitch.tv and watch some streams its like learning a new board game and watching other people play will help a lot

me too! i can‚Äôt wait to playyyy the new characters

That literally is tunneling by definition

Uhm I've been thinking about this for hours, Claudette can really get punished when she stay selfish, but imagine being injured, doing a gen in tall grass, after it's done you're almost half healed ! Same when the killer is around, he kinda lost you and you're hiding in tall grass, trying to dodge him, slowly healing at the same time, there's some potential I think.

For Meg, just lower the number to 2%, and voila !

SWF of 2 arent that big of a threat IMO

Being able to see the killers location permanently is really not balanced.
---
As for the 'ignore killer disbenefits', it could be reworded as. 'you are stubborn in your ways, regardless of situation, you will complete any task' . Complete all tasks at 90% speed, nothing will stop you (meaning skill checks and killer perks)
---
And make the wait times even longer? No thanks. I‚Äôd rather go against SWF than not play at all.

Farming Simulator: Dead By Daylight edition.
---
Reposting is 1 thing... trying to take credit is another level of shitter.
---
On PC I just ask people in the pregame chat box what they need to do. (obviously Killers are on their own)
---
Imo, if I haven't hooked the last survivor yet, they get hatch, otherwise, they die.
---
At that point if i see someone in a locker i msg them i need the achievement and that i will see them again i will let them farm and get the left 4 dead achievement. Worked for me
---
Definitely fun to experiment with what it gives you
---
*IT'S **SECONDS** GODAMMIT*
---
I mean, unless you literally have a little wheel of fortune you spin before every decision and you have absolutely zero thought process, then it's still a mind game.
---
I PLAYED 6 GAMES YESTERDAY WITHOUT A SINGLE KILL, WHY CAN THEY NOT FIND SURVIVORS IN MY OWN RANK AND GIVE ME SURVIVORS 6 OR 7 RANKS ABOVE ME
---
Quite possibly the most useless thing i have ever seen on here.
---
What the fuck is 5 seconds gonna do?
---
Thrilling Tremors - I agree give it a faster cool-down, maybe around 30 or 40 seconds
---
Monstrous Shrine - Issue with buffing the hook sacrifice time is that it would reward camping. Maybe make it spawn two basements instead of one, increasing the likelihood of a basement hook. Could perhaps give it a token based system that will grant the killer benefits for hooking survivors on specific hooks scattered around the map.
---
Hangmans Trick - I like your suggested change. Maybe have an additional effect like unhooker gets the oblivious status effect for 10/20/30 seconds after unhooking. Could bring synergy with perks like MYC.
---
Furtive Chase - Agree. 
---
I'm all Ears - Agree 
---
Fire Up - Agree with your first suggestion that it should be reversed to make you faster at the start and slower near end-game.
---
Dying Light - I think it does need a change since its been made from a tunneling perk to a perk that has barely any effect when needed most and becomes decent when you have practically won the game. Perhaps a full rework to the perk like slowing gen progression while a survivor is hooked or a buff to starting numbers that dwindle the more hooks a killer gets so that the first few hooks have a significant increase in slow down which has diminishing returns as you hook more and more survivors.
---
Third Seal - I think a buff to blindness is what is needed rather than a change to the perk. Perhaps making blindness remove the red-stain from a killer or actually impacting the survivors FOV.
---
Coulrophobia - I would remove the healing aspect from it and perhaps make it do something like make survivors scream if they are in your T.R for a period of time. Could make a decent tracking perk. Maybe make skill checks significantly harder while healing?
---
Surge - Somewhat of a nerf rather than a buff as killers like Myers would or 24m killers would lose out on this perk. If they buffed the regression from 8% to something like 15% or more then it would be significantly better.
---
Cruel Confinement - On the wall with your suggestion. Sounds like it would just be very frustrating for survivors. Perhaps make it permanently effect the area around a completed gen? would create dead zones for survivors, forcing them to stay away from gen finished areas and punish survivors trying to lead the killer away from other gens. It could also be converted into a chase based perk where vaulting windows will entity block them for a period of time, similar to bamboozle but for survivors. 
---
Mind Breaker - Make the exhaustion substantially longer like 20ish seconds for half a gen making it risky for survivors to work on gens. Currently it can just be walked off before a killer arrives basically making this perk useless 
---
BloodHound - Agree. 
---
Predator - I would suggest maybe increasing the sound of footsteps so it can be used during loops to track survivors. 
---
Shadowborn - Agree. 
---
Huntress Lullaby - Reducing the amount of hooks to like 3 would be nice since comparing it to other totem perks like Devour hope, the requirements and effects are just not worth it. 
---
Territorial Imperative - Agree
---
Beast Of Prey - I would suggest just removing the red stain during a chase all together. Making bloodlust come quicker would make chases less skill based. 
---
Lightborn - Cant really think of a change for this perk.
---
i don't think they cared about being seen by bbq considering they were running straight at me in my field of view like i didn't exist. I'm not going to just not punish that? dont stand in attack range of the killer in front of his face then complain that he downed you. slugging is only a dick move if i dont have another easy down in my face. i planned on hooking everyone as i downed them, but the survivors were playing like i HAD to and wouldn't down them for running at me like an idiot
---
That's assuming instant queues, which we all know doesn't happen.
---
Hey this is quite a nice idea. I didnt even think of that ! At least you get it. But yeah just giving a little thing to each survivor, not too game changing, just to make them more unique.
---
Even if the exhaustion stuff is already a thing with Quentin's Perk, it could be quite nice
---
Honestly i prefer snares still. 
---
Pallet freddy is just unstoppable late game if you never wake up / don't pay attention to what pallets are useable while awake. Snares are still better in most scenarios since it actually lets you end loops.  Pallets just prevent them from starting if they didn't pay attention or haven't been there yet.
---
It's bullshit, you even reach your hand out but then just have a stroke and smack them.
---
Or worse, the killer only gets 1 hook and it‚Äôs you who was hooked.
---
Bitches get stitches üòé
---
wow!!
---
I agree. For the moste part i played bubba. But after i got mine compleated i where friendly. Whit whom where left since when a bubba carry you to the basmen the dc are real.
---
Well, they unironically mains legion so it‚Äôs really no surprise they‚Äôve  been delirious before
---
Sometimes it's 25 and then I throw a party
---
Yeah I get that dont worry, dont take the number, take the concept, like I did with Tapp. Ignore Meg, i messed her up, what do you think of something  more like Tapp's ability ?
---
does green keys count? could use mediocre aura reading add ons to just dump them.
---
Don't give them ideas, pls &gt;.&lt;
---
I'm not a camper, tunneller, slugger, whatever else survivors wanna call me cuz i punished them for playing like apes. i didnt sit in a 10+ minute queue just to get literally nothing for that game cuz they got mad i didn't let them stand in front of me without downing then, so they quit
---
One again Im being attacked for presenting new ideas
---
The issue is that there's no way to know which pallet has been used unless you follow every survivor being chased but even if you know a pallet has been used and Freddy replaced it and you are awake there's nothing you can do
---
Maybe, but also maybe not. Not everyone gets saved before you can hook someone else.
---
Dream pallets are very weak. They definitely don‚Äôt need to be ‚Äúrevisited.‚Äù 
---
Also, there IS a counter. Two in fact.
---
1.Be awake
---
2.Keep track of pallets when you‚Äôre awake
---
Boom. Countered
---
"If you have not seen absolute best killers (Otz etc) playing against SWF and struggling to do well, then you would understand why it is the issue."  
---
Completely irrelevant. Most players won't be up against top tier killer players. The game is for everyone, and therefore should be balanced as such.   
---
"Yet, it is still heavily balanced around the top 1% of players. Why?"  
---
Says who? A claim like this requires a citation.   
---
"Imagine killer power level as 1-2-3 or 4 sticks (each stick equals to one decent survivor)."  
---
In what manner are these sticks? Is it a survivor's full potential at peak performance? Or the average survivor potential?   
---
You said yourself that killers need a power level of 4 to fairly play against a team of 4 survivors at their highest potential (paraphrasing here). Except we *already know* that the killer potential is *higher than 4 right now*. Why? Because right now survivors *do not have that 50% win rate*.  
---
Regardless, saying " It is conceptually impossible to make it fair" does not mean the game should automatically always favor the killers, which is a point I already made in my last post. It is not impossible to get those numbers closer to 50% than where they are. This entire subreddit is filled with killer mains screaming that the game favors survivors when it's been pointed out quite clearly that it's not true. People love putting killers in the so-called F-tier when in reality they were all over-performing (exception for newest nurse). That alone is sickening.
---
Im quite bad at balancing numbers, so this is more of a guess.
---
The "she is only fast as survivors" turned out to be too limiting as an after thought, yes.
---
Maybe if she gets a longer lunge when breaking out of disguise? If she comboes it with Acquired Taste it can end a surprise chase quite quickly.
---
~~Also you wrote Momo Yaoyorozu wrong~~
---
I dident realy try to beat the tome but since i saw i culd just finish it heck, why not.
---
I like to finish the killer first so i can hate me lyf as q survivor later.
---
First you need both addons to play forever Freddy, second pallets just work if you didn‚Äôt check places around you before you are in a chase and also if you force the loops(which is fine, is a way to play). Actually they don‚Äôt even help you to get survivors quickly since the best survivors usually force loops to the max.
---
I usually leave that to the Nancy's
---
That's fine but I'm still against the idea of the survivors being anything else but skins.
---
THIS SUB IS ONLY FOR MEMES IF YOU WANT A SERIOUS DISCUSSION YOU GET BOMBARDED BY ENTITLED SURVIVOR MAINS OR ENTITLED KILLER MAINS
---
yikes bruh
---
I used to buy every DLC on It's release date, but the game is unplayable the way It is.
---
So for the first time, I'm not buying it.Rather just wait for his nerf tho.
---
&gt;but even if you know a pallet has been used and Freddy replaced it and you are awake there's nothing you can do
---
But... thats nothing to do with freddy thats called being out of position? If you know those pallets are fake why did you run to them, or why did you run to an area without pallets? Going to an area while awake against a dream pallet freddy is just called being chased by any m1 killer.
---
I have been playing since release ~800 hours and have seen it plenty in screenshots, but never seen or used it in game lol!
---
why did you nerf your own idea? the other iteration was fine
---
And living a decent amount of time/killing moderately fast
---
Seriously it feels like it's every time. Drives me fucking nuts because I only pop gens when I'm trying to stop working on them
---
I love the happy endings
---
***oh yes...***
---
When you get pallet stunt the whole game.
---
Hey, you should do a concept for Ripley!
---
Also, I have a few completed character concepts of my own, but I'm not too savvy with Photoshop. Do you by any chance still have the file for the Alien concept? If so, I'd love if you could use it to create a template without the details for Xenomorph, and maybe link it in a drive, so I could use it. I would 100% credit you for the template.
---
shit devs strike again
---
"Don't call it a comeback...I been here for years...."
---
Too true. I had a game a few days ago where I just needed 3 gens left for that challenge. Ended up running the killer for all 5 gens.
---
WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG TO FIND MATCHES
---
As a killer i disagree, 1 or 2 pity kills is not a lot of points nor will it help me pip, but if the survivors try really hard to get the unhook endgame,and end up trading hooks in an attempt to all get out i usually fight back chase them all out and if that last guy is slugged and i know that last kill isnt gonna help me to the next pip i let them go.
---
ITS TRUE! ü§£
---
Yes. If I heard right then the challenges never go away, only the rewards from the rift will be unobtainable once the rift closes. Don‚Äôt quote me on that though.
---
I think Autodidact should apply to self-heals (Self-Care self-heals and Med-Kit heals of any kind), only that instead of granting tokens, a token should be consumed on every self-heal skill check, after granting the according heal progression. That way you wouldn't be able to farm tokens on self-heals, you would instead even lose them, but at least you would still get value out of Autodidact.
---
I also think its numbers should be buffed. At 5 tokens, you apply a 50% healing progression on a survivor, so half the total healing time. This regularly means that you have a time saving of 8 seconds (if a skill check actually appears). We'll Make It does that same thing, but a lot more reliably and without nearly as difficult a condition to have to first fulfil (not to mention that fulfilling Autodidact's condition inherently comes at a detriment, with the healing regression of the first two skill checks). And it's not even necessarily 8 seconds: if the skill check appears after you have already healed the survivor halfway (and that is again, if a skill check appears at all), you obviously aren't saving half the time on that heal. So those 8 seconds are best case scenario, outside of the incredibly unlikely scenario that you get a skill check in the first few seconds of the heal and then immediately another one. Autodidact's effect is "faster" against things that reduce healing speed, like Mangled, but even then it still depends on the random mechanic that are skill checks. I don't see any reason why Autodidact could not finish the entire healing bar upon getting a skill check at 5 tokens, so 100%. And hell, if that turns out to be OP against my expectations, they could just increase the amount of tokens required.
---
I try to say gg to killers after a good game, but they always have their settings at private. PS4 gang
---
Don't get me wrong, NOED is not used exclusively by bad killers. I use NOED on trapper with brutal strength, best for last, and fire up (would swap for blood warden if the entity wasn't a dick and kept not giving me it) for example to run an endgame build with traps on the gates. Ruin and NOED are pretty balanced perks but a lot of people use them like crutches instead of integrating them into their gen slow build or endgame build, just like how BBQ should be used in a tracking build.
---
REPORTING SOMETHING TO BHVR IS LIKE A FART IN THE WIND!
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e2n2sg/is_it_just_me_or_is_styptic_better_than_syringe/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
May the entity bless you!
---
if that happened to me I would be legit pissed off cause that essentially means all the work I put in as killer was for nothing.
---
Basically play Hostage Doc and get a 4K.
---
&gt; you need to break 40 pallets and generators
---
How dare BHVR expect the killer to break pallets and generators!
---
&gt; catch a survivor in a bear trap 5 times in a single trial
---
People who regularly play trapper will probably get this normally. But fully farmable as you said.
---
&gt; Hook 15 people in the basement
---
Yeah. At least 2 games. Or maybe 15 games. Either way, you're still playing games, right? Goddamned crybabies are complaining about a challenge to HOOK PEOPLE in a game about HOOKING PEOPLE.
---
&gt; have two people hooked in the basement at the same time while using the perk monstrous shrine
---
Okay, admittedly tougher than others, but you can easily run a Basement build including Monstrous Shrine (Which is a bad perk, but whatever) and complete this. Heck, you could easily farm this if you convince the survivors you're friendly and lead them to the basement... So it's farmable! Makes it 100% not difficult.
---
&gt; kill the Obsession 7 times
---
Either play an Obsession perk yourself or god forbid one of the survivors will be playing DS almost guaranteed. And nothing says you have to tunnel.
---
&gt; I really don't think that forcing them to stop generator progress and run to survivors to heal them is a good challenge
---
God forbid you run as a Healer in one game. Hell, you could even just focus on healing yourself 4 times in the trial and ignore the other 3 survivors.
---
&gt; These challenges are insanely difficult
---
Oh, okay... Get off yourself. These challenges are fucking easy and you're just a crybaby.
---
I play on ps4 and haven't had a problem finding matches. Try resetting your system or the game and see if that helps.
---
DONT WORRY THE TOXIC ACHIEVEMENTS WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU WHEN YOU GET BACK!
---
HAPPY FUCKING THANKSGIVING!!
---
i know, it was just an example of satisfying Myers Moris.
---
David here died the heroes death
---
Tbh I'd be playing Jane. That blind would be so frustrating for the killer
---
OH SHIT hahaha, we all knew this was about to come..yet bhvr didn't change SHIT
---
 i know, it was just an example of satisfying Myers Moris.
---
Listen. All American people asking for Japanese shit are weeabu. I don't make the rules I just enforce them.
---
This is fucking dumb lmao
---
For real. I'm normally a pretty forgiving person of devs because making games is hard and takes a lot more time than most people seem to realize. 
---
But this is just sad. There is no good excuse for this, these challenges are bullshit and there's no way they don't know that, but instead of doing it well they just commit to the shit.
---
If you don't want it to happen, just don't get stunned.
---
BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, and whatever else (I run Spirit Fury and recommend it for the shock value alone) will give you a passable build on nearly everybody. I do variations on this theme occasionally (Doctor's Monitor and Abuse, for example), but this is where I start from if I don't really know a killer well.
---
Why is this downvoted so much?
---
when i say ‚Äúfor bad killers‚Äù i souly mean 90% of the community who use it as crutch because first, it‚Äôs just so boring to come against a killer using both... i‚Äôd love to use fun perks as survivor but i have to run detectives hunch and at least some healing perk every game because first i need to find the right totem, then i need to evade the killer during this process and most probably heal
---
people think literally everything is toxic in this game. no matter what you do someone will think it's toxic. just play however you want to play the game. you can't avoid the babies and assholes. they're everywhere.
---
A spirit had 5 stacks of devour and TotH, so I totem tapped and nodded at her when she came to mori me
---
Let me know if you need some tips, I had to cheese the fuck out of T2 and I‚Äôm currently doing so for T3
---
Cant stand this subreddit and they're crap ideas. Literally the only good idea from the public was the person who recommended a dc charm for players who frequently dc. In terms of killers/survivors and perk changes just no, those ideas come from a biased place and really shouldn't be taken seriously
---
Im ok with that too, I am aware, but y'all kinda agressive when Im putting here a little concept i want to talk about. I dont want any of these, to be precise, i enjoy the game as it is, Im just daydreaming and sharing what my little brain came up with, like a lot of yall with shirtless Myers. My day went to this: "Tapp should really hold his neck instead of his belly when he is injured" from this. Crazy, overused, not well designed concept I get it folk. But jeez.
---
I already know all the killer stuff, all they already endure and everything.
---
Sticks represent reasonably skilled survivor (who can kite, and repair effectively). Not some ideal fully optimal survivor. 
---
League is balanced around the top tier because of the esports and it‚Äôs highly competitive nature (as in the best of the best dedicated players). 
---
Also, especially at low ranks, game will generally benefit killers rather than some clueless survivors, simply because the of their lack of any team coordination. If it were to favor survivors EVEN at the average joe (low rank) level, killers would significantly struggle against any remotely skilled team.... (which happened to the Last year, where you had to play, learn the basics and it would become very easy to counter any killer).
---
Which ones? Like, which ones in particular are gonna give you trouble?
---
I seriously regret buying the Rift Pass on day one now.  These challenges are fucking ridiculous.
---
Yeah I think you aint the only one dude. Lets just hope for more unique survivors animations then.
---
I totally hear you, friend.
---
I have also been playing since release (I used to be real keen on a game called Damned, and after buying it for ALL of my friends and desperately forcing everyone to play that terrible ((but also awesome!!!)) game with me time and time again, when DBD was finally announced everyone was sure to tell me about it! And we all still play DBD, that same group of weirdos).
---
I have maintained my pure love of this game. I am often bummed out by the amount of shittiness from some parts of the community, and I do lament that, but ultimately I have more fun with this game than could be outweighed by shitty buttheads. 
---
I play AGGRESSIVELY nice. Not "nice" let you do whatever and not kill you nice, but good sportsmanship, absolutely no rude behaviour, and always hoping to find like minded souls in the fog. It takes a bit of doing, but there are loads of chill people still floating around out there :) 
---
Anyway, mostly I just wanna tell you that I hear you and I appreciate you expressing your feelings on this. There's A LOT of discussion about this and that and balance and OP shit and just... it's exhausting. Like you, I just wanna chill and play this game. So I throw the salt out the window, I get blazed straight to Satan and I play just for fun &lt;3 And I hope you can too! But even if you can't, sometimes a game just has to be there for you for a while, and maybe you grow apart and it isn't the game for you anymore. And that's OK, there will always be others. In any case, big muddy hugs from ya Swamp Sister!
---
Farming is not a bannable offense. Its only bannable if you either do it to a select few and leave out another survivor or if you pretend to farm then suddenly turn and kill the survivors. Even then I doubt you will get banned for it as getting banned in dbd is rare unless a player is saying extreme remarks or actively cheating.
---
DC however is a bannable offense and that Meg could be reported for it. The next update is applying punishments towards DC'ing.
---
Farming‚Äôs boring af so I‚Äôll leave the lobby. Unless it‚Äôs a double bp event &amp; we‚Äôre all throwing down streamers, then that‚Äôs a good time üòé

No. I legitimately tried. I have gotten much worse for forgetting a comma. Let‚Äôs bring that down about 10% there bud.
---
LIKE THIS STUPID DISRUPT 25 CROWS. INSTEAD OF HELPING THE TEAM I RUN AROUND THE MAP FUCKING WITH THE CROWS LIKE SOME SIMPLETON.
---
Level hag for ruin, it was on the shrine recently so it wont be coming back soon and it will make your games go by way easier. You can skip leveling ghostface for his perks cause they are kinda iffy and the best one is thrilling tremors but its still not that good. Of course, if you want to play him disregard this.
---
Of the three you don't have the teachables you should look out for are Make your choice, Surveillance from the pig. All of the spirits perks are useable but if you had to pick one i'd choose spirit fury but it was on the shrine recently. Plague's Corrupt Intervention is a ruin replacement that gives 2 minutes of guaranteed slowdown since the survivors usually spawn near those gens and it allows you to patrol the other 4 that are usually close to you and get easy pressure for the first two minutes.
---
Of the characters you have, you can basically never click huntress or wraith because their perks are all god awful unless you want to use them. Nightmare is the stat based best killer in the game, and is in my personal top 3 so hes worth leveling regardless but if you don't like his playstyle you could just wait for his perks to come on the shrine. The only one you can skip is Fire Up, its kinda worthless.
---
Hillbilly's a good character but hes perks suck for the most part so if you can get enduring you can skip leveling him, but it was on the shrine the other week so again unlucky.
---
This is red ranks. If this was in general I‚Äôd understand but this is red ranks. Nobody first times Nurse in red ranks.

But then they got kindred.

Please tell me how to change my name on mobile!!  Do I need to link an account or?

"BuT ThE PInS ArE GOoD NoW!!"

For the pins to do literally ANYTHING you have to hit atleast 3 people in Feral. One to activate killer instinct, one to proc the add ons affect, and another, because if you chase the second one, your blindess/mangled/broken pin doesnt matter.
---
"Oh but feral is 0.2 faster now!"
---
Wow! He's 4% faster! That'll really make him good!
---
Smh
---
I wouldn't :I
---
As long as there's no "ez"
---
wow you get massive super ultra mega high 750k bloodpoints for completing all tier 3 challenges. Tvh 750k is nothing when you will probably need 100 games to finish all challenges. 7,5k per game.  To bad i'll be stuck on trying to get 2 EGC safe unhooks.
---
There are so many interesting challenges you could do but we get shitty challenges with no tought behind them. Yet again Behavious shows their incompetence.
---
It was a Huntress that chased me for 5 gens so yeah she's pretty bad. I posted the game [if you want to watch it](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e1h3fd/i_just_needed_to_repair_3_gens/)
---
Last survivor?
---
I always do a 360 before i hook them.
---
Wow mustve been a survivor main trying the challenges because wow
---
Though trapper is pretty basic, I've gone against some good ones. Trapper is my favorite killer to use aside from demogorgon. Don't know what it is.. I just like'im. &amp;&amp; no, I don't use NOED all the time. Thinking about it.. I've never used it with any other killer.
---
I run into a lot of ghostfaces with it... Now, that is a mother fucker. I still don't bitch to the killer. I just stick my head between my legs and kiss my ass goodbye.
---
It‚Äôs actually 40 and it‚Äôs not in one match (thank god)
---
Perhaps it should be a killer perk then.
---
The funny part is you are the one that unaware. Who are you to tell someone how to play the game? Is there a rule against 3 gen strategies? No. It‚Äôs not holding the game hostage. It‚Äôs defensive play that works. There are many ways to win and just because it doesn‚Äôt conform to your version of normal that makes it wrong? Ok boomer. If anything the survivors are holding hostage if they don‚Äôt try to get to the gens. I play both sides and know how to beat that strategy. Apparently you need to get better if it bothers you so much.
---
I'm not even the only person replying to you that remembers, haha.
---
And how long do gens take exactly... asking for a friend...
---
Friend, did you miss the part where this is something a friend group does together? That is to say: 4 friends decide to play DBD in a SWF group and sometimes have fun screwing each other over. That's something for THAT group of friends to decide. It's fine if you don't want to play that way, this person was just sharing an anecdote of a fun thing. You are not required to play the same way anyone else does, and if you are playing in a group with friends, then I hope you all are playing in ways that are fun for all of you.
---
I never seen this...is this todays new tome?
---
Just making sure you arent a new person who made these perks right?
---
YUP, SAME HERE BUDDY, MONDAY NIGHT ON PS4, I PLAYED KILLER BECAUSE SURVIVOR Q TIMES WERE 20MINS! 
---
THEN THE KILLER WOULD DODGE THE LOBBY OR WHILE LOADING IN SOMONE WOULD GET KICKED OR DC SENDING US ALL BACK TO REPEAT THE SAME FUCKING 20MIN WAIT!!! 
---
BHVR NEEDS TO MAKE CROSS PLATFORM HAPPEN AND FAST!
---
But it's not your business to tell them what to do and how to play? Don't throw a fit because you can't have it your way, some people are assholes and some just do it for fun. There's no point in arguing. Like I said if it bothers you so much that someone just spams the crouch button, you ain't gonna last long on this world without getting some form of Tourettes. Anyway, good luck with your next matches.
---
Interrupt/Grab counts:
---
- Grab during survivor vaulting (Pallet or Window). Survivor must be in wounded state.
---
- Grab during survivor entering/exiting a locker. Any health state.
---
- Grab survivor off of a Generator. Any health state.
---
- Grab during survivor unhooking another survivor. Any health state.
---
Grabbing OUT of a locker does not count. It must be mid-way through their animation of entering/exiting.
---
Also - 6 grabs is easily farmable. Show that you're friendly, bring the survivor to a locker, motion to the locker, and grab then release. They'll get the idea.
---
I'm not super comfortable downloading the file from a third party. Would rather wait for official release.

I've seen video of it and it looks pretty legit, apparently the latest patches play it at 60FPS.

Yep,the first killer challenge to be exact
---
Jesus... Please don't have a whole convo about something you don't know about. 
---
A curving billy is someone who can use Billy's chainsaw in a way to curve around objects and loops to hit Survivors, using the extra control you get right after you start chainsawing. Only good Billy's can do it well
---
That "boost" was from doing the rift on the PTR when it came out.
---
You killed two and got two disconnects.
---
Haha I had a wraith do that exact thing to me on the preschool map.
---
Yes both DCs did it in my arms
---
SEND THEM ALL A MESSAGE
---
Yeh I tried to tell them that dc'ing was gonna be punished but he proceeded to still complain about me "boosting" lmao
---
For killer perks, the best ones to look out for are;
---
Corrupt Intervention - An alternative to Ruin and can be very effective in trap based killers. Freddy can also work well with it as it gives him some time to place dream snares/pallets and use them.
---
Spirit fury - Excellent perk when combined with enduring as it allows you to instantly recover and break a pallet. Not very good by itself however and can be countered by good survivors. 
---
Haunted Grounds - Really fun perk that is great for both stealth killers and for trying to hide your other hex perks like ruin. I like to run it with Devour hope as it helps cover the perk while also providing a benefit similar to Devour hope.
---
Infectious Freight - Great perk if you like slugging other survivors while playing. Not very good on Freddy in my opinion due to oblivious removing the scream effect. 
---
Discordance is an amazing tracking perk as it allows you to identify where half the survivor team is at a given moment. If you do not use Ruin then it is very useful since survivors tend to group up on gens together
---
Pop Goes The Weasel - Amazing gen regression perk and probably the best slow down perk just behind ruin. Allows you to have some control over gen progression and can help if you plan on defending a set amount of gens.
---
Play Hag, trap up the basement area, pick a few nearby gens to patrol. Hag is AWESOME with basement play :D I am really excited to try this challenge on her!
---
It‚Äôs just a rehash of a meme with the same title but slightly different context.  Not an original title
---
I know no killer would take that.
---
Being a survivor doesn't mean you can't be a dick
---
Wait, is it hooks or sacrifices?
---
Jesus fucking christ....this thanksgiving is goong to be a stressful one
---
Escape block would be wayyyyy OP especially with Blood Warden and NOED. Plus, no way to counter play it. The second one is interesting but should be less time. Perhaps 30 seconds at Rank 3. The first perk seems a bit strangely worded
---
I play solo. So when I get members of an SWF group lead the killer directly to me by fast vaulting windows or dropping pallets, it sucks.
---
I have too but with the killer and your teammates, if they're randoms, going after the challenges, the game is going to play so differently it'll be even harder to do this challenge and other ones.
---
A true Meg head right there.
---
I started at 10 most of my started at there or a lil above, even though there's still 40+ days to do the rift
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e2nh0d/i_deal_with_this_bug_up_to_30_minutes_each_day_to/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Don't you think it would be easier if the killer was on board?
---
Chaotic good?
---
I would.
---
Tunneling is frowned upon but also they tbagged so...
---
For me that should be Hag with IG and Agitation and long range teleport add-ons.
---
Oh I see your meaning (cause of google) and yes... fuck the teabaggersüòÇ
---
At least that ones doable another one is ‚Äúsave 2 survivors during the EGC‚Äù
---
I don't see that mentioned in the comment we are replying to. I agree, that sucks.
---
Flood of bubbas coming
---
Yeah 3 survivors on a gen only takes then like 20ish seconds to pop it unless ruin is up.
---
You have 59 seconds to chill on that hook. The sooner you get unhooked means the sooner you can get rehooked.  Enjoy your invincibility.
---
I mean if you're talking about the xim Apex and chronus max users they can use them in this game too ? I'm sure a couple of people use them on huntress and nurse.

I highly recommend playing killer a bit more! It may help you to have a better understanding of how to play well as a survivor, even!
---
Facts
---
Pretty sure it's in their contract with the Entity. You could even say it's a teleportation claws.
---
Low key I‚Äôm a pretty nice killer. I like to let people get away but if I see a guy tbag I‚Äôm playing dirty
---
Based flower bush and floofy tree. 
---
You can squish like a 3rd of your model into the tree. :3
---
Dude. Mad grit is fucking great.  You can just swing away. I use a custom build called chopper MEYERS and I use Iron Grasp, Agitation, Mad Grit, and whatever else. Those 3 are the main. Then get perma 3 add on and just go ham swinging like a mad man lol
---
Sneaking as a Dwight?!?! What is this horse shit?!?! Go back to doing the gens and hiding in lockers bb. /s
---
I can‚Äôt wait to see him react to the Balanced Landing nerf
---
The only real balance is to delete all killers so we could probably escape /s
---
Why can't I stop laughing at this
---
Hahahaha yes!
---
It seemed to me that was what the post was implying, I can see how I may have misinterpretted it though so, I guess, apologies to OP if I did. 
---
Maybe I bit because I'd had a crappy experience earlier today. I totally got trolled by my team mates, sapped all my desire to play DbD today, I'm playing Hitman 2 now so I don't have to rely on other people.
---
xD
---
Okay. Not complaining about the perk, I'm referencing the quote that comes along with it.
---
*Otz sadness noises*
---
it requires 0 effort to be friendly in post game chat and it's a lot of fun :) I encourage everyone to be friendly! Even just tossing out a GG can make an impact &lt;3
---
I had a game where I thought the Hatch didn't spawned. Turned out it was tucked into the very corner of the map. I didn't had that hatch bug, thankfully.
---
why is it the trapper being the "woke" one in the image? tryna say killers are smarter than survivors or something??? huh bitch??/
---
Right! Man, I‚Äôll be the nicest, sweetest, and funniest killer you‚Äôll play against, but as soon as you‚Äôre being a little egotistical with those butt dances... Ima play a sour killer and strike my vengeance upon thee
---
Trash slugger.  Go play CoD
---
I have no idea since I could only see first person, but if I saw this I'd nope the fuck out.
---
That's pretty much the easiest way to not deal with the tedious challenges. My very first game I played, I took wraith and played Bing Bong man until survs figured out I wanted to break all the pallets and gens. Eventually one surv sat at a gen with me while I broke it over and over. 
---
Got the 40 in one game that way. Not about to sit here and waste hours on hours of my time grinding.
---
Could be her gun. Normal range but animation of shooting gun "Cooldown" could be reload
---
Score one for the boi in the sky!!
---
I love Spirit :3 I think she is really fun and VERY challenging to play against!
---
#
---
Oh He took a hit by god!
---
Honestly they should just make DC a sacrifice ingame playing the EGC neck snap animation.
---
Drives me nuts as a killer and survivor when people do this. It's a waste of time and pallets.
---
I'M SO FUCKING ANGRY.
---
I WAS GOING FOR THE EVIL INCARNATE TROPHY, MANAGED TO GET TO PERMA TIER 3 WITH ONE GEN LEFT. KILLED ONE GUY...NEXT DCS. THE LAST TWO JUST RUN TO LOCKERS AND STAY THERE. IF I PULL HIM OUT AND GET HIM ON HIS FEET, HE JUST RUNS BACK IN. EVENTUALLY ONE DCED AND THE OTHER GOT THE HATCH.
---
THEY CALLED ME SWEATY AND TRYHARD. I WORKED HARD TO TRY TO GET THE TROPHY. 
---
IM GUESSING EVEN IF THEY ALL DCED I WOULDNT HAVE GOT THE TROPHY.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇI hope they realize all they have to do is pressure multiple gens in a 3 gen lock
---
Guess we are gonna see some basement dwelling bubbas for a week...
---
Well, the other one was downed on the other side of the map and about to be mori-d, so pretty much haha
---
More like the others arent used enough because the system makes them useless.
---
Your perspective is superior to all (no jokeüòÇ)
---
I know this is a shock to some people but streamers are regular people like you and me, prone to bad days where they get annoyed or triggered by certain questions they've probably heard a million times before.
---
Geez this pun ;)
---
I don't understand why you got downvoted. You clearly nailed the issue. If people skip challenges to buy riff tiers, then bhvr has no reason to change them before the riff closes. The challenges are stupidly hard exactly to encourage buying riff passes. They can always tweak them or unlock the lore later when it doesn't affect the riff.
---
Just go for the unhooker, it makes sure that nobody is being singled out(gameplay/fun wise), and you get extra chase points and hit points.
---
Nope. They all died. I caught the last one on the gate because I'm not the type to slug for the 4k and I guess that's why they were so riled up.
---
I UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETIMES THE GAME JUST KICKS PEOPLE. I HATE IT CAUSE IT MAKES ME LOOK LIKE A DC-ER AND IVE NEVER DC-ED CAUSE I REFUSE TO FUCK THE GAME OVER LIKE THAT. BUT YOU CAN FUCKING TELL WHEN ITS AN INTENTIONAL DC. FUCK THOSE PEOPLE. IM SO GLAD THE PUNISHMENT SYSTEM IS COMING IN.
---
What claudette?
---
I was being sarcastic with the title
---
I agree. I dont mind not seeing the blood because in most cases survivors dont have iron will. Aura change would help a lot but i wouldnt break the whole game cuz you are supposed to see the auras.
---
Idek if Hag does. She might work just like a much quicker Demo considering she sinks into the ground when she teleports and pops back up. Definitely debatable
---
Demo definitely doesn't teleport though. He's just moving really fast between two points.
---
I asked them before Ieft results screen, they didn‚Äôt.
---
Mission status: S I C K
---
Man, I guess I'm famous. ü§™
---
I had a claudette do this to me. And they also run away when injured when im trying to do the heal others challenge.
---
Oh, if duty calls I‚Äôll slug for the 4k or for a specific person. However, if survivors are nice than I‚Äôm nice. I‚Äôm glad they all perishedüòÇüòÇ
---
Sometimes I close hatch when there's only one survivor left and let them open the exit gate while watching. Then I down them, pick them up and let them struggle out. Since the time is running out they're gonna get a kick out of it because they're afraid they won't make it, but they do, just barely. Sometimes I just feel dickishly nice I think.
---
If your trying to save someone on death hook from being tunneled then I think you're fine. But being somewhere safe and clicking is toxic.
---
AS A SURVIVOR MAIN THAT ONLY PLAYS KILLER LIKE ONCE A WEEK, THE NEW TOME SCARES ME. IM EXCITED TO GIVE IT A TRY BUT THE COMPLETIONIST IN ME IS INTIMIDATED. I WANT MY LORE DAMMIT.
---
Technically it is, but this way everyone can know how they can more efficiently help each other progress through the tome
---
Well, idk if PS4 has a ‚Äòrecent players‚Äô tab in the PS menu but when you‚Äôre in the lobby it‚Äôll show everyone under there. That‚Äôs how it is on Xbox at least
---
The bannable variant of farming is when a killer and one or more survivors work together to fuck over the rest of the survivors.
---
Power would be the worst in the game, but I like the first perk. Might make it 60 percent at tier 3 though.
---
Reworking the power and changing some timings on the perks.
---
It's weird cause one time the dc counted for me but the other it didn't .
---
Oof dude thats a sad backstory
---
How could he? ;-;
---
Best anti-camp ever
---
He should have other people with him for this Monto and him is my favourite SWF team maybe put Sat in there too
---
You can only actually get banned on pc anyway, don't know what you are on.  Always laugh when you get messages likes that on console because a survivor lost.
---
The last time I played Basement Hag I got called nearly every racial slur in the post game chat by the scrub tier SWF I 4k'd. ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Heh, it makes the first chase take super long, but it screws everyone else over later in the game.
---
Lmao I love Otz. This is an adorable encounter.
---
I get 5mins waiting for killer max and surv is instant. Less toxicity, lots of actually nice players. I do find lots of camping killers, but survs are a lot better than when I play on PC. I do get more frame rate drops tho.
---
I watched the game for a very long time before joining the actual game so I have a good understanding how to play but thanks for the tip
---
I had an injured Claudette teabag in front of my Ruin totem during a chase a while back. she was only like 5 feet ahead of me too, and 10 feet from a hook, when she decided this was a brilliant idea. 
---
As I hooked her right there, a gen pops, and BBQ shows the other 3 running from that direction, straight at the hook and at me, all shoulder to shoulder. 
---
naturally, the ensuing game of musical hooks went poorly for them, because what was I going to do? go vacation in Morocco? I then receive multiple messages trying to shame me for "cheating." and not a single one of them had borrowed time or Decisive strike.
---
And then they get caught by the killer before the sacrifice animation even finishes.
---
You go to your quick menu, go to ‚Äúdead by daylight‚Äù then ‚Äúcurrently playing with‚Äù and if the killer doesn‚Äôt show up then his profile is set to offline. But if you play solo, you‚Äôll need to make sure you message the killer and not your teammates so pay attention to your teammates names
---
I had three killers on console the other night give me hatch or let me open the exit door when I was the last one left. I made a point to message them thanks. I‚Äôm all about spreading the wholesome positivity lol
---
Nah, I don't agree. Some of these can be easily abused.
---
you can just grab them when they are vaulting, super easy
---
I saw somebody talking about this before and they said one of two things will happen, either the community will throw each other under the bus constantly, resulting in a massive rise in complaints OR the community will come together and there will be so much farming that the devs will say fuck it and make the challenges easier so people stop farming. Then again who knows maybe they are just gonna be bastards.
---
WHAT A 4HEAD!
---
But not really useful because they hear her pornstar moans every time she is slapped.
---
The survivor could be one of the camp counselors responsible for Jason's death. Also hex death curse should not be included for cleansing totems/opening the hatch(and the description should clarify that if it IS the case) or it would be op to the point of getting more nerfed than the pig.
---
I finished them already
---
Ok thx will do now
---
Posted it there, thanks for the recommendation.
---
I don't think DbD is uniquely toxic and divided. Sure, it's way up there on the scale, but plenty of other games are just as bad and still feature voice chat. That's what mute is for!
---
When one player reverts to screaming, everyone mutes them and then gets to continue on communicating and coordinating.
---
I think it's the only way to really balance SWF and Solo without breaking the game (i.e. giving survivors a built-in see-the-killer's-aura-always, highlighting the location of hex totems for survivors, etc.).
---
Mad grit + demodaddy to give survivors bleeding ears
---
It‚Äôs gotta be a SAFE save as well. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
In that case, every person you play with can report you and make anything up.  Literally means nothing.
---
How is that funny?
---
Most killers mains cry foul when you wiggle to at least attempt escape, when they were apparently wanting to give you the hatch instead but for the sake of wiggling and trying you hurt their ego and now they must hook you.
---
So survivors dont even try to save fragile killer egos and they still get shit for it?
---
I really regret buying the rift pass. What a complete joke. If they don‚Äôt fix these challenges for the next rift, I bet a lot of people won‚Äôt buy it this time around.
---
downloading now! excited to see what perks i haven‚Äôt experimented with and maybe find a new favorite
---
I've done it many times before. I recommend Spine chill so you unhook faster, Dead Hard for extra evasion, and Borrowed Time for obvious reasons. 
---
you might even consider Mettle Of Man, since the coming update supposedly fixes protection hits. Diversion could also help, and/or a SWF with one person working on distracting the kilelr while you unhook. 
---
It's far from impossible, it happens all the time. just dont expect to do it on your first game.
---
LAST TIME I CHECKED YOUR GETTING YOU FEELINGS HURT BY A DS JAKE
---
r/lostredditors
---
If only they just leave instead
---
r/woooosh
---
How.
---
WE HAVE DECIDED THAT MONSTROUS SHRINE IS BALANCED BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH PICK RATE
---
As a killer main this is a great idea. If I see this in game I‚Äôm down
---
Vigil and Wake Up need reworks desperately. Both should be late game perks, or buff Wake Up and the late game perk, and buff Vigil to protection from indefinite status effects as well.
---
Wtf does this have to do with dbd?! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And don't "whoooshhh" me there is nothing!
---
A soul for a soul
---
Break 40 pallets is kinda quick. I use fake pallet Freddy and the guys just drop everything. Then I pop every gen and otherwise play normally. Got it all in 2 games. I will never finish the save 25 survivors lol
---
You should get it back if they do it right away.
---
it's not that difficult. this sub is constantly ridiculing the massive number of survivors who tend to go for unsafe unhooks when they shouldn't. and it happens at high ranks waaaaaaaaaay more often than this sub likes to admit.
---
This is some pretty creative stuff! I'd like to see this implemented
---
Oh god. You mean the Boiler Room? It‚Äôs a shame, looks amazing in the movie, but in game it looks like ass and runs terribly.
---
This demi? Or another demi. Judging by the photos you added
---
Why are you waiting at the pallet? Just run away.
---
Your last question would like to borruw a quesyij mark from one of the preceeding questions.
---
whats the point of buying it later instead of earlier? i'm 63, almost 64
---
ESPECIALLY SINCE A SURVIVOR CAN LITERALLY GO AFK WHILE OTHER GET KILLED, THEN TAKE THE FREE HATCH AND GET A TROPHY
---
Your welcome
---
No. That‚Äôs the Pale Rose
---
Literally just make it so it doesn't need to be completed in one match and all would be fine.
---
Bro the game point is to KILL THE SURVIVORS
---
I think it was licensing issues irc
---
ITS HAPPENING TO KILLERS AT EVERY RANK, GREEN AND PURPLE KILLERS GO AGAINST RED SWFS THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME
---
I GO OUT OF MY WAY TO PLAY NON-SWEATY AND STILL GET BITCHED AT FOR TUNNELING WHAT THE FUCK
---
I only play somewhat toxic when I play with my Friend and he needs time to recover and heal so I try get the killers attention (although not with a flashlight). I‚Äôm a Killer Main and obviously find toxic behavior To be absolutely pathetic especially when out of malicious intent. Although doing it to give a teammate time is perfectly fine
---
And Grim Pantry‚Äôs main structure is one of the most obnoxiously strong in the game. Also has its strength increases considerable if the survivor has lithe or BL
---
It has, besides the main structure and the shack, two other strong spots for survivors as well. Then there‚Äôs the log loop, and the middle generally has about 2 strong pallets
---
Player test build time creates some of the worst glitches on the regular game. We had a crowed out player freeze on hook with his crows still circling and the killer had to wait out end game collapse for the game to end.....
---
Everyone is telling you than in the video he was trying to hit the guy doing the save and accidentally hit the one on the hook, yet apparently the entirity of reddit is wrong exept you and this one other guy. Makes sense.
---
This is why I‚Äôm starting on the killer challenges even though I main survivor. Fighting everyone for unhooks sounds horrible. Using the fact that everyone is fighting for unhooks as bait sounds wonderfully evil.
---
&gt; Unhook 2 survivors safely during EGC in a single trial
---
&gt; Unhook 3 survivors safely during EGC in a single trial
---
&gt; Sacrifice 2 survivors during EGC with NOED in a single trial
---
for example
---
Oh you're on entirely different servers than me then. Not sure how to help in this situation. I'm on US east servers so I get matches pretty regularly all the time. The queue times suck but it is what is ever since they changed the match making.
---
That would indeed be way better. 
---
Although I honestly wish that the challenges would just be: -Play X,X and X amount of survior games and play X,X and X amount of killer games. These amounts could f.e. be 10,25,50,100 and 200
---
Well, just step in his traps at the beginning, so he got his challenge and then play the game normal, doesnt hurt anybody...
---
Yeah, so? You need to do the tomes if you ever want to get to Tier 70 without playing all day and they're getting increasingly more annoying
---
Here's an example, Unhook 3 survivors in end game collapse must be safe unhooks in one match.
---
As I said, it‚Äôs a stretch. And thanks.
---
Some people do that on battle passes to make sure that they'll get the most of it. If they don't reach the final tier, well, it's no biggie because they spent no money. And if they do, they can just instantly buy it and get all the rewards.
---
Wait really? There's a detail whether he can kill you or not? I need to study this
---
It's called fashion baby look it up....
---
Otz once used that to murder someone as a EW3 Myers, it was sexy as hell.
---
I honestly can‚Äôt remember now. I‚Äôll have to check next time I‚Äôm online.
---
Because you play on console and she‚Äôs barely playable on console
---
Correction, he IS the spirit now
---
Nope its not fixed. As a Survivor you can still only guess and if you face a good spirit there is nothing you can do.
---
43 days left with 58 tiers left...it‚Äôll be really hard but you might be able to do it you play for 2-ish hours a day
---
FUCKKKKKK LEGION. that‚Äôs all
---
Its always been like this really. It just sucks being we have like 3 killers playing at any given moment and they all camp you :)
---
Holy instant downvote Batman lmao
---
Yes, if Michael has an open hand he has Mori or tombstone meaning he can kill healthy or injured survivors. If it‚Äôs closed he does not
---
IF A KILLER DC'S, SURVIVORS SHOULD NOT LOSE THEIR ITEMS, OFFERINGS, BLOODPOINTS, AND ARCHIVE ACHIEVEMENTS! ME AND SOME RANDOMS WERE LITERALLY RUNNING OUT OF THE GATE IN A MATCH WITH A HUNTRESS, AND JUST BEFORE ANYONE COULD ESCAPE SHE PULLED THE PLUG, I LOST EVERYTHING AND GAINED NOTHING. 
---
WHY WERE WE PUNISHED FOR PLAYING A GREAT GAME? SHE WAS A SIMILAR RANK AS ALL OF US!
---
Was it an old bloodweb?
---
i feel like it would suck to have to juggle two buttons on a controller just to wiggle bc what if you struggle to move your finger that fast?
---
I knew I wasn‚Äôt the only one who remembered
---
Bruh wtf killers just camp EGC hooks, you have to unhook two in a single match??
---
You can't be banged as long as you all are fair.
---
Yep :/
---
So many of you can‚Äôt crawl out in the most direct path it hurts
---
One gen is 80secs.
---
How about just making it optional? Like you either want to wiggle the joystick or press 2 certain buttons rapidly.
---
Hope you find it useful!
---
Grim pantry has 2 god loops. 3 if the killer isnt particularly good. One on top of the main building, and one below, not to mention the 2 pallets that go with both the upstairs and downstairs loop. And not even the pale rose is bad. There are multiple safe loops as well as 3 or 4 guaranteed pallet spawns on the boat. Swamp isnt bad it's just a bit annoying because there can be large dead zones
---
that would be a good option to have for sure!
---
What? What are you trying to say you want it to be? I can‚Äôt make sense of that
---
That‚Äôs pretty fucking annoying actually. Killers literally always camp EGC hooks, for even 1 to happen is hard
---
He‚Äôs more of a twitch streamer but Fungoose has some good survivor and killer games on YouTube. He basically explains his every move so he‚Äôs great for learning.
---
Pretty much, though I guess it is on the cheap end compared to other battle passes I've seen.  I.e. the $35 auric cell pack covers 40 levels.
---
Better hope you get a farming killer
---
I like impossibe skill check doc
---
Unhooking 2 survivors during EGC is hard, sure. It happens often enough but you‚Äôre not in control of when it happens and all.
---
Unhooking 3 survivors during EGC is not in this time. Nice try though.
---
Sacrifice 2 survivors during EGC with NOED is easy. Once NOED activates, slug remaining survivors, open the gate, hook survivors. Easy.
---
Any others? Or are you saying that out of all 19 challenges, 2 of them are difficult and therefore the whole tome is ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù?
---
Or are you just exaggerating?
---
I agree.
---
Na you still get those splinters even if you own every Killer \^\^
---
Tough for you doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs ridiculous. I can appreciate admitting some of these may be tough for you (I can‚Äôt grab a survivor to safe my life), but that doesn‚Äôt make the challenge ridiculous.
---
Yeah... Blinding the killer is so difficult. How dare BHVR...
---
What if I just want to play the game normally?
---
Put simply, I believe DBD would benefit immeasurably from a graphics overhaul, more atmospheric sound design, and additional gameplay elements. It would add so much to the whole experience, and keep people coming back for more. As it stands now, DBD can be a helluva lot of fun, but it becomes bland way faster than it should. While the game has stood tall amongst countless failed competitors, I can't help but feel it could be so much *more*.
---
When I imagine a truly terrifying and atmospheric horror experience, I tend to remember the basement levels from Resident Evil 4, with those nearly invincible regenerator creatures; or facing off against Pyramid Head in Silent Hill 2. To say the music and sound effects made those experiences suspenseful would be an understatement! In regards to DBD, I would love for each Killer to have unique chase music. I've grown tired of listening to the same themes on nearly every character. Individual tracks for both Killers and Survivors would be fantastic. It'd really give every character their own unique flavor.
---
By far the game's biggest weakness, aside from lack of gameplay variety, is the lighting. The maps just look so static. Dial down the exposure, up the contrast, and make environments darker. The flickering lights in some of the interiors should actually affect the surrounding surfaces, dynamically altering the lighting. You can imagine how terrifying facing a Killer in that kind of setting would be. Equally as important as dynamic lighting, are dynamic shadows. Thought-out placement of shadows is a necessity when trying to invoke stress and tension. All the greatest horror games use darkness as a central tool for establishing their armospheres. It's one of the most fundamental human fears, and is crucial for creating a truly unsettling experience.
---
Immersion is another huge weakness DBD suffers from. Once again, the game world just feels too static. The groundwork is definitely there though. To really start expanding on the foundation that's already been laid down, more animations have to be incorporated. Facial expressions should be added to all Survivors, so they actually look frightened or in pain. I've seen countless games implemenet universal facial animations, so this is certainly doable. Objects and clutter, like doors, curtains, and window shutters could be shown being blown by the wind. Rats, bugs, and other critters could scurry across surfaces. New particle effects could be implemented, like dynamic spider webs. There's limitless potential. Oh, and on the topic of animation, WE NEED GORE! Memento Mories should reward Killers with magnificent displays of dismemberment, decaptiation, and disembowelment. That would go a long way in adding some more "oomph" to the experience.
---
The last thing I wanted to talk about is variety. As I mentioned previously, that's the biggest problem with DBD. From a design perspective, there's not really anything that can be done in terms of actual game modes, but there are TONS of additions that would make the experience far less bland for both Killers and Survivors. While generators will always be the focal point of the game, adding in other wild cards would certainly spice things up. For instance, take some pages out of the Friday the 13th game's playbook. For starters, tons of new hiding spots and item containers could be implemented. Instead of just having red lockers as hiding spots, beds, wardrobes, closets, and wrecked vehicles would work beautifully. Similarly, items could be found in drawers, on shelves, and just lying around in buildings/houses. As for escape methods, having a vehicle on a few maps wouldn't hurt. Maybe Survivors would be able to find gas, a battery, and a key; again, just like in F13. Perhaps doors could replace pallets in certain places, forcing Killers to break them down. All these additions would go a long way in increasing the game's replayability and overall longevity.
---
Well, that's all I got atm. I really believe these additions would crank up the game's depth, as well as its overall quality. The playerbase would absolutely explode, and competition would become even more irrelivant. I obviously don't expect all of the things I proposed to happen, but I do hope, little-by-little, the devs work their way up to it. They've captured lightning in a bottle, and I really want to see DBD reach it's full potential.
---
There's a good chance since as it stands, Legion are the only killer(s) left who've yet to get Halloween Blight skins. I REALLY hope they do all four instead of just Frank &amp; Julie.
---
For hungry jaws (trap 4 in a single trial) I ended up "friending" the survivors.  Downed one, danced around swinging my knife.  Placed a couple of traps near their body and then picked them up and dropped them a few times.  They (and the other survivor's) came up and let me farm them for 4 traps and then I let them finish gens and escape while downing them a couple of times and helping them back up.  I'll do the same for any new ridiculous challenges.
---
That happened multiple times to me in one match yesterday as Legion.
---
Dedicated servers basically make it that much more difficult.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ we all wish lowkey, but how are you going to drum her with a toolbox AFTER end gameüòÇüòÇ
---
cranky because you can't figure out how to win against spirit ;)
---
Dbdgonewild would go fucking crazy with this, don't ask how I know this........
---
Gotta toss it straight into the air and bonk her after running out the gate.
---
If they've teabagged or flashclicked then I'd do it if I Can be bothered. If they play respectful or make great plays then it's definitely hatch for them.
---
That I'd prefer the challenges to be as follow:
---
- F.e. for survivor: Get Rift progress and bloodpoints for playing: - 10 games, 25 games, 50 games, 75 games, 100 games, 150 games and 200 games
---
And then the same for killer
---
Escape while unhooked happens all the time. Just takes some luck.
---
Unhook 2 during EGC is tough, sure. With you there.
---
Trap 5 is easy for anyone that plays Trapper normally. Or, just farm it. Survivors will willingly go into your traps if you show as friendly.
---
And you‚Äôre actually complaining about challenges that are succeeded by *just playing the game normally*? Really? You‚Äôre complaining you have to break pallets? Or get emblems?
---
It's generally done to regulate the speed of progress. For earlier levels of the current tome, it might have been possible to complete all of the survivor challenges in a few games if you could make progress on them all at the same time.
---
I'm not a fan of one active challenge at a time either. I feel like it could have been designed better, even if the challenges required a bit more work.
---
I mean battle passes aren‚Äôt really meant to be fully completed unless you want to try hard everyday so I‚Äôm just going to try my best and get the cosmetics I get I don‚Äôt feel cheated if I don‚Äôt complete it
---
This grind is time gated. It‚Äôs fucking stupid.
---
Honestly, dedicated servers need to be fixed. 
---
Another thing is that many perks such as Lightweight,No Mither, and Open Handed are bad or old. I would love to see some reworks for older perks.
---
I also feel some of the older killers such as trapper and wraith need a better and newer mori.
---
Don't forget about pig and doctor, they are 65% Kill rate in red ranks!
---
You can block them you know?
---
But what about all those other, uncompleted challenges?
---
Most likely so that people wouldn't farm all of them in a single trial which would very well happen.
---
Literally all they did was add no collision while phasing and she now has a vaulting animation (also some add-on changes). The guessing game is still there. No feedback for the survivor if she‚Äôs phasing or not. She‚Äôs still going to be un-fun to play against.
---
Probably a lot of people queueing up as survivor for the new tome challenges.
---
The problem here is that you need to do the challenges to unlock the lore pieces, which is the main reason to even buy the pass for me
---
if it's iphone, you can just change your app store location and directly dl it from the app store.
---
You're gonna be waiting a long time then
---
Nah fam. It‚Äôs spreading love in an already toxic community :) üñ§
---
I DON'T GET IT. I'VE SEEN POSTS SAYING THE STATS PROVE THAT X KILLER NEEDS A BUFF, BUT SAID KILLER IS SITTING AROUND A 60 -70% KILL RATE. MEANING SURVIVORS ONLY HAVE A 30-40% ESCAPE RATE. HOW DOES THAT PROVE THEY NEED A BUFF?
---
YES I'M A SURVIVOR MAIN, AND NO, I'M NOT A GOOD ONE. MY ISSUE IS THE MORE I PLAY THE GAME THE MORE I GET PUNISHED. I DO NOT PERFORM WELL IN CHASES, I RARELY EVER GET GREAT SKILL CHECKS FOR RUIN, AND YESTERDAY I PLAYED 12 GAMES OF DEAD BY DAYLIGHT AND ONLY ESCAPED 1 OF THEM. THE WORST PART IS, I STILL RANK UP FROM NEARLY EVERY ONE OF THOSE GAMES.
---
THIS GAME IS NOT FUN TO PLAY FOR SURVIVORS LIKE ME, EVEN WHEN I FEEL LIKE I PERFORM WELL IN CHASES, OR STAYING HIDDEN, OR "GEN RUSH" I WILL USUALLY DIE. AND THEN I RANK UP. AND GET PUT UP AGAINST EVEN BETTER KILLERS. AND I DO PROGRESSIVELY WORSE THE MORE I PLAY BECAUSE OF IT.
---
WHY DO I KEEP PLAYING? I HAVE NO CLUE MAN, LIKE I ENJOY THE GAME I GUESS? JUST NOT WHEN I PLAY IT? LIKE I WANT TO GET BETTER, BUT IT'S NEAR THIS TIME THAT I JUST PRAY FOR RANK RESET SO I COULD ACTUALLY SURVIVE FOR A FEW MATCHES. BUT NOW RANK RESET IS GETTING CHANGED, AND I'M IN RED RANKS, SO I'LL STILL BE PRETTY HIGH UP WHEN THEY DO RESET. AND I'LL JUST BE BACK TO DYING, RANKING UP MORE, GOING AGAINST KILLERS WITH THE SAME PERKS, MORIS, ONE SHOTS, ETC. THEN I'LL GO BACK AND CHILL IN THE SUBREDDIT WITH MY 12 DEATH STREAK FOR THAT DAY, LISTENING TO KILLERS BEGGING FOR BUFFS.
---
The Realm is alive with the sound of screaming!
---
The challenge is bugged. No matter how many you get, it will only count 1 per game. 
---
So good news, you only need 1 iridescent each game...bad news is you need 15 matches lol
---
Demi is great, I recommend checking him out
---
The only reason I can think of is because either they want to encourage buying tiers of the rift as much as possible or they're just really dense and don't understand what is and isn't reasonable, both of which have been getting tossed around a lot and it's really all I can think of as well.
---
C O D P I E C E
---
I own all the killers and haven't seen any splinters before.
---
Nurse isn't as bad because you can tell when shes using her power and you get feedback on which direction shes going and about where she'll land. This lets survivors read what shes doing and try to counter play her. 
---
Spirit's problem isn't that people don't know how to play against her, its that you don't get any feed back on when shes using her power and how shes using her power. This leaves survivors to have to guess on what the right play is. 
---
All the while she can see scratch marks, she can see moving grass, she can hear you (especially while injured), and if she messes up using her power she only has a short wait before being able to use it again anyway. 
---
Spirit has tons of ways to read how a survivor is trying to play her while shes phasing, survivors don't get any ways to read how shes playing while shes phasing.
---
Or just do what you want in your leisure time without paying attention to judgement about being a "tryhard" because its not a real thing.
---
Something something something old Legion is back...
---
There's no way that's possible.  Even averaging 2-3 hours a day I feel like I'm behind in progression (level 36).
---
Who says 1 hour a day? Because that‚Äôs a fucking lie.
---
Freddy Darn became Freddy, Damn.
---
If i had space for two perks in my sprint burst/Lightweight/fixated build that gets me face camped, i would.
---
That‚Äôs definitely a lot worse lol. These challenges can be done in under 100 games and you want the challenges to be 200? That‚Äôs outrageous, not everybody has time to play that often. The challenges should be difficult but doable. Somebody who plays casually should be able to get them if they really tried, without having to play the game for hours on end. 
---
Also, that isn‚Äôt even a challenge. Loading into a game for bloodpoints? That doesn‚Äôt make sense.
---
Idk why you were downvoted, you‚Äôre right, except its the survivors desperation instead of despair.
---
I really hope these change good lord.
---
that doesn't explain why it's so long as a killer too
---
Personally i do not mind swamp at all, killer or survivor, it adds plenty of tension to the game. Makes you rely on mind games rather than infinites.
---
Nah this dude is the spirit
---
Would it make the sound *bonk* when you do it?
---
I mean you do, thats why even if you stand still and never do anything, you still get some small amount of points.
---
I'd suggest playing with the killer you're most comfortable with and just use the BP on Leatherface.
---
unhooking 3 survivors during egc is not in this time, but it's going to be eventually, and is overall a part of the tomes since BHVR does not seem to have any plans on changing them
---
the NOED thing requires you to hit two people which doesn't happen all the time, and while you go, open the door, carry a survivor to the hook and actually go through the process the other one will surely have been revived 
---
as I've said, the other difficult ones are the flashlights but that just comes down to a matter of personal skill. I also dislike the ones where you have to grab people off of things
---
a tome is kinda worthless if you can't completely complete it, since I've seen someone on reddit do the math that every challenge undone is an hour+ of gameplay grind to make up for the tiers. So only two challenges already make you grind 2+ hours plus whatever it is that you have to grind for the day in general 
---
It's entirely possible that I'm exaggerating, but well, even if it did come down entirely to me being bad, I'm just glad I didn't buy it.
---
In my opinion challenges are supposed to provide a fun twist for the game, and make you try out stuff you don't usually in return for rewards. This just seems like a snorefest to me, where you just grind and grind.
---
It's called every time I get that map, I lose because there's nothing you can do especially when I always get the boat one
---
BHVR did, if I'm not mistaken
---
I kill only DLC survivors and duplicates..
---
"You're bad if you use anything good."
---
Okay, so I take it you never use DS, Spine Chill, Dead Hard, toolboxes or keys?
---
Imagine looking around for killer while repairing a Gen and you suddenly notice him Gen rushing with you
---
If you haven‚Äôt been playing this game long enough where sacrificing a couple of games isn‚Äôt worth changing up gameplay and breathing some fresh air into the game here and there... well maybe you haven‚Äôt been playing long enough. It will be the same game throughout the entirety of it‚Äòs lifespan so i kind of appreciate the chance for a unique objective to work towards, even if the challenges are admittedly stupid and promoting bad play-styles. To each their own opinion though.
---
I LOVE THE IDEA OF A SURVIVOR BEING LIKE ‚ÄúMAN, I‚ÄôM SO GLAD WE SURVIVED THAT CHASE AND FINISHED THE GENERATOR. NOW WE JUST NEED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE AND‚ÄîCROWS!!!‚Äù
---
8 seconds lol it like the old survilence usseles
---
I feel that the hook teleport mechanic is very similar to FK‚Äôs gen teleport.
---
RNG = good game design
---
/s
---
ISN‚ÄôT A 6000% INCREASE OF 0 STILL 0?
---
No offence but as a killer we have too much bs to deal with already
---
Maybe it's having difficulty finding people at a certain skill level? I can only speculate because I don't know the details of the situation. It could just be some intermittent network issues for all we know. It's fairly common for people to have to wait every now and then for games.
---
If you purposely attack the person who was just on the hook so you can re-place them back on the hook, rather than go for the asshole unhooking people stupidly, then you are technically tunneling. Like my comment said, there are ways to still punish the survivors for being dumb without actually punishing the survivor that had no choice in being unhooked by a farming player.
---
What is this wizardry you speak of!?! 
---
But I understand and agree. I generally avoid OP things off of my own principle but I just want to have a solid Nurse. It's a nice challenge learning her on console.
---
I know. Btw, I was Ghostface in the screenshot.
---
You forgot a key
---
By that logic, survivors don't ever Gen rush.
---
Survivors will never understand that logic, sir/ma'am.
---
Did the person survive too?
---
SURVIVORS ARE CUUUUUUNTS.
---
STINKY HAT
---
When I read the title I thought it was gonna be the overused Will Smith meme. ***Boi was I wrong***
---
I don't ever teabag or flashlight click intentionally (sometimes I accidentally RMB or am crouching around stuff to try and hide via Iron Will, however) in about 99% of cases, but if the killer is coming back/intent on tunneling or whatever then I just throw out a few cheeky teabags as they wipe their weapon post-hit and book it if they start chasing me.
---
It doesn't feel any different than bodyblocking or forcing the killer you hit you in an attempt to take aggro; maybe it's annoying as fuck, but it's not being done for the sake of being toxic (unless a full 4-man SWF is doing it unnecessarily just to tilt you with BT/DS over and over, of course) IMO.
---
Though I will occasionally also teabag a killer who facecamped while just shy of the escape trigger (and facing it, of course) just for the vindication.
---
Teabagging at pallets and shit is just stupid though.
---
I beg to differ about the endgame hooks, the main problem with that one is that once the gates are open, survivors usually start flocking out to avoid getting killed and the Killer starts camping or at the very least patrolling because hey, they want to secure a kill and I don't blame them.  
---
Plus it feels counter-intuitive to either have to rely on opening the gates while someone is hooked, or having the killer open the gates themselves. I've been at this for about an hour on and off, I'm genuinely trying my hardest by luck always seems to be against me, and that doesn't really feel like a challenge to me.
---
Oh no, an entire queue of people who aren't sweating profusely. How horrible, nobody could have fun there, where it's understood that you're not implicitly trying your hardest and people don't call you trash for not winning against any odds.
---
I give hatch so often it's bound to happen soon üòî
---
50 DBD GLITCH IN THE CODE, 50 DBD GLITCH
---
TAKE ONE DOWN, PATCH IT AROUND, 72 DBD GLITCH IN THE CODE!
---
I actually use a 0 perk meg with a flashlight I can't aim and bust gens on my friend til I steal the hatch when I play survivor so..... yes?
---
Disable SWF for casual.
---
Is it because like you said you can‚Äôt loop? There‚Äôs other ways to counter a killer than loop repeatedly.
---
The two survivors were out of his sight. It wouldn't make any sense for him to use his ability in that small area.
---
Another point I have is both survivors were no where near him. If he attempted to hit the survivor then we would've seen the survivor running away, then coming back to get the save. But we didn't see that. We saw OP standing behind the hooked survivor hitting him.
---
We also didn't see any scratch marks leading away from the hook and when the Jane took the opportunity to save, we see OP get awarded bloodpoints for finding a survivor. Stop denying the truth; there's so much evidence proving he was camping and slapping the guy on the hook.
---
It's just the decent thing to do. Don't have to, just nice.
---
Game have its up and downs. By survivor dont even try repair cuz there is a chance you get caught or as a killer dont even try to put somebody on the hook because you will be called a camper or tunneler even if you are not.
---
Yes!  That's a good idea.  I don't think that the Entity would just let them 'decide' to leave.  Sometimes people dc for the smallest of things &amp; it ruins the game for everyone else.
---
Pig only has a decent kill rate cus only people who know how to play her play her
---
no no no No No NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! What kind of challenges are these?!  The insanity of some of these!  The unhook during EGC is going to drive me off the rails.  Good luck to everyone.
---
They are blocked. Still its funny
---
I wish the devs didnt encourage sluggin, camping etc in these archive challenges
---
I can smell the salt. Fake phasing isnt that hard to counter just walk or crouch away somewhere dhe wouldn't expect
---
Uh, a wraith on the preschool map?  ...that may have been me.  I'M SO SORRY!
---
Maybe dont name and shame...
---
Im a surv. main but I never accuse somebody for tunneling. I do killer sometimes and I know how it feels. They just try to win the f*cking game
---
Not allowed to play strongest killers (even with Splinters) and lose. At least, a lot of people tell me to kill myself when I dare to.
---
New Survivor: Karen Karenson. All 3 perks prevents the killer from ever attacking her but always alerts them of her location. Prevents bloodpoints from being obtained. Perks exclusive to her.
---
Great job! Hope I can do the exact same.
---
I sympathize with having crummy wi-fi but frankly you shouldn't be playing a co-operative multiplayer game if you "often" crash mid game.
---
Thr point stands that they didnt get it for free, still took time and effort just as it would without the "boost".
---
Of course they did... idk how they are absolutely so wrong about the game THEY make.
---
Like what? Trying sneak away when the killer won't leave you?
---
Looks great!
---
I don't even know how to get the adept achievements anymore. I was trying to get adept cannibal; 4ked 3 games in a row and double pipped each game yet didn't get the achievement in any. But when I was going for the spirit adept, I only got a 3k and single pipped and got the achievement. It's so frustrating, I'm sick of playing Leatherface.
---
Look whose shitting it the tall grass
---
Ironic... You could save others from death... But not yourself...
---
while everbody else is trying to unhook :D
---
Maybe something from Mario. The toolbox crash and the tools scattering about like stars.
---
What the fuck is this?
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting popular and/or meme-ish number combinations, e.g. 420, 69, 666, ... (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
I legit got scared that was me. I looked in the last two perk slots: Brutal T3 and Pop T1. I don't play with traps that much adn I legit just played him for brutal. I'm the same killer rank. Posted recently enough that it could be me. Then I looked at the add ons, the console, the first two perks, and realized I didn't DC
---
You're right about the first three but the grindy ones are horrible because that kind of shit takes hooouuurrss to complete. If we could have all challenges we're unlocked tracking at the same time it would be fine but we can only track one at a time so challenges like that could take upwards of 10-20 matches to complete.
---
It was just an example to show him what I mean. 
---
It works in other games though. Take Rocket League. The challenges in there are: - Win X amount of matches. - Earn X amount of XP. - Score X amount of goals with X wheels (these don't change gameplay). - Play gamemode X multiple times.
---
In Rocket League there aren't challenges like: - Score X earial goals. - Get 5 saves in one game twice. Etc. If this was the case then the game would become more toxic and people wouldn't participate in normal gameplay, what is going on im dbd right now.
---
These challenges and the way people are playing atm makes me wanna quit. But I paid for the pass so ive basicly committed myself to this bs :)
---
Yesterday I got grabbed out of a locker before I even showed a pixel of touching it and going inside. Killer literally grabbed me before it opened
---
Isn't the Hag already a Wendigo?
---
Haha you're safe mate :p
---
Oh, sorry, I meant to address the "it appears to be trying to communicate" poster, because I felt that was an unkind response. I totally understand trying &amp; struggling.
---
I'm 29 so I feel you lol but I just neeed to get to Claudette's hair I don't care bout anything in the last tier.
---
Yes of course. For that you do need as system like the OP did.
---
I also toned up this phot like hella so there‚Äôs an explanation before you ask.
---
Do you work at Home Depot?
---
I often give hatch to avoid double pipping, I love the lower ranks. :)
---
This flair...
---
Any killer with 2 neurons could easily avoid flashlights, and the challenges aren't as close as you say to "just play the game lul". Those challenges force you to completely change your playstyle, not in a fun way, most of the times. 
---
But if you are a rank 1 Nea, against a R19 bubba with no add-ons or perks, I agree with you, the challenges will be very easy.
---
NOED was the speedboost /s
---
damn that would be pretty awesome
---
Oh well do I got a surprise for you
---
Instant downvote for putting this as "BHVR official". Take it away.
---
You're mashing your stick too hard. Gentle circles is all it takes to wiggle, you dont have to move side to side and you dont have to try to go as fast as possible. It's all the same speed.
---
Will fix.
---
Borrowed Time, and hope for a couple trades. You're not going to be the only one doing them, so I expect it'll happen easier than you think.
---
The 2 unhooks during EGC in one game should not exist.
---
You can outsmart a killer. And guess what? If you lose, you can always play another game. I just feel like you‚Äôre judging the maps on the lack of ability to escape.
---
I've been playing coming up on two years, the challenges just aren't fun to me. I mix up my own gameplay a lot by giving myself personal challenges as both killer and survivor. The ones in the Archive are just tedious, like the 15 unhooks or 10 heals in level 2. Those weren't really fun to me, I don't like leaving what I'm doing to go halfway across the map and hope another teammate doesn't get to the hook or heal before me.
---
Should be a feature tbh
---
Hope could just be put into Adrenaline.  
---
You are fueled by unexpected energy when on the verge of escape, filling you with hope and giving you wings.
---
**Instantly heal one Health State** and gain a **6**/**7**/**8**% Haste Status Effect for the rest of the trial when the Exit Gates are powered.
---
*Adrenaline* is on hold if you are disabled at the moment it should take effect and will activate when freed.
---
*Adrenaline* will **wake you up** if you are asleep when it triggers.
---
i‚Äôve already named the hamster :))
---
Well stop telling people that.Survivors with higher fps can destroy people playing on 30 fps.360s and window juking is so much easier if ur aims let alone ur frames cant keep up
---
Took me a second to get it, but gave me a good laugh.
---
You might want to practice in the tutorials, but I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs a case of turning your direction and view analog sticks in opposite directions
---
It promotes stupid plays. The 2 unhook rescues during EGC quest is REALLY easy, IF you play with friends and get hooked &amp; farmed on purpose. You'll die, but hey, here's 5 rift things and 25k bloodpoints
---
Well nurse is slow as hell. Spirit can be duked in phase walk easily. And I don't know about freddie
---
Agreed, but especially not at the very fucking beginning of the level.
---
I understand your point. However I've helped people with their challenges in other games, and it ruins the experience for me. This is how I see/experienced it:
---
This killer wants to complete challenges. I want to play a normal game. If I step in his traps and let him do his challenge these 3 things can possibly happen:
---
1. He is thankful and let's us escape. Aka we're basically farming. I want to play a normal match, and farming takes this away obviously. Therefore the game is ruined.
---
2. He's a dick, and kills us after, to either hop on to the next challenge, or he was faking doing a challenge. I can play lobby simulator for the next 5+ minutes again.
---
3. He's a reasonable person, and continues the game normally after we stepped in his traps. 
---
I personally don't find it worth the risk to do his challenges for him, while he's either to lazy or bad to do himself. They are called challenges for a reason after all
---
Im curious to see if they actually change antthing. Seems to be ALOT of outrage on here
---
same
---
I‚Äôm gonna do that now thanks for the idea
---
One of the challenges is gonna be playing a match at the fucking BHVR office
---
Don't get me wrong, the Swamp maps suck. But there are worse ones out there.
---
My top worst maps: Hawkins, Lerys, Game, AND THEN Swamp.
---
What does it do? I never seen it. Is it a teachable or jus one you get in the bw
---
As much as i love Otz but hes not that great as survivor, imo Tru3talent plays way better as survior (even i dont like his attitude sometimes)
---
ZubatLEL is a really good survivor imo.
---
Really hope Noob3 starts uploading again soon...
---
I think it‚Äôs because people are trying to rush the objectives. They‚Äôre meant to be completed over a course of 70+ days altogether. Let it come organically and it‚Äôll be much better i think. At least that‚Äôs what i do unless it‚Äôs a master challenge, those can be on the unfun side i agree.
---
Don't use this addon its garbage and useless, Nurse needs 2 Blinks, one to close the gap and one to correct your position.
---
Also she sucks not fun anymore because of the recharge mechanic so just play more fun Killers.
---
There is a reason she is the worst killer atm
---
U really copying this 1 reply around huh
---
Optimization, a full perk rebalance, including merging exceptionally weak/seldom-used ones, and ideally a few tentatively-added new mechanics to expand gameplay options/ encourage more enjoyable gameplay.

Doctor with impossible skillchecks would be even worse.

I think Legion is impossible to balance just because of how his power was designed. One buff I'd like to see is to their awareness, imagine this: Legion stays exactly the same, but now the other 3 members you're not playing as roam the map with a very simple AI. If they spot a survivor, they reveal their aura to you (or proc Killer Instinct) and run away. This wouldn't make them broken, it wouldn't change their power directly, and it would give more of a LEGION feel when playing as them.

How hard was the NOED challenge? Did the totem stay lit the whole time while you sacrificed them?

I don't enjoy making games into work, so I decline. If they really want a challenge that can be done quickly I'll give it, but wasting my time grinding virtual currency, no.

Thats what i do

Huntress would make for a legit movie. Spirit seems like the best for a series, since it could follow her haunting her manor in modern day, assuming this is a timeline Rin either returned to or stayed in, having never encountered the Entity.

For me it's :swamp, game, Hawkins, lery's (because most of the time it's a stealth killer Aka scary fun times)
---
God yes. At the absolute least, make it holding a button.

Players who just immerse all game or don't even bother trying to do gens are the worst.

Gen rushing is to focus on completing the game as fast as possible, regardless of what happens in the match. It means to ignore heals, ignore hooks, ignore chests totems - anything. It's a poor way to play, as the survivors rob themselves of pip's and points, as well as the Killer. It's a thing. But what most people call gen rushing is just poor pressure.

I wouldn‚Äôt complain to be honest, I want to get through these challenges as fast as I can

Hey look on the brightside with all the talk about difficulty and tediousness they might tone it down a little

It also doesn't help when I got 3 games back to back of ppl bring in Grandma's cook book
