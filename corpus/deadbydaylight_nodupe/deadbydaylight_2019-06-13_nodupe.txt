The only thing she really needs is reverting the terror radius to 28 and making rule set nr. 2 baseline.
---

---
Otherwise she's fine imo.
---
---
---
That many bp is maybe 1 prestige lmao
---
I have learned that a competent survivor can power through Unnerving Presence and hit more great skill checks than with Pop Goes The Weasel. With that it's a guaranteed 25% regression plus a bonus 5% if the miss the Overcharge skill check.
---
Oof? Wutchyu mean lol?
---
sigh I dream of this happening
---
You can use this TO your advantage. Phase for a split second to get the hair to stand up, then stop phasing and wait.
---
YOU BBQ AND TITTIES BITCH ASS CAMPING MOTHERFUCKER, I KNOW YOU SAW ME WHEN YOU HOOKED KATE, I KNOW YOU CAMPED HER TO DEATH WHEN I WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.  I KNOW YOU CAMPED ME TO DEATH ON A HOOK TEN FEET AWAY AFTER. GO STRAIGHT TO HELL
---
Ghostface in the game is basically an original character except he gets to use and iconic mask.
---
Go onto the Ps Store and search for Dead By Daylight, you should find the DLC for Lullaby for the Dark, it should be free, download that and restart dbd, you should have both David and Huntress.
---
Spies from the shadows, no matter who the killer is, you'll mostly get spies by around level 25 or lower
---
Monto’s got a lot of good killer content, and he often uses perk builds that aren’t meta so you can see a ton of variety and synergies etc
---
Dad?
---
Really? It's easy to hide from the killer when avoiding generators because you're looking for totems.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Otherwise pre-EGC Claudette using Urban Evasion around the map for 20+ minutes due to hatch standoffs would've never been a thing, and it was a thing despite Whispers **and** Iron Maiden existing.
---
Does it also make his power better?
---
This is so sad can we remove corn from the game
---
Oof that your on ps4
---
Assume he is always a tap away from T3, because if he hasn't literally just left it, he is.
---
Literally how emblems work tho.
---
YES  ghost face needed this. I’m excited to play him
---
Platform?
---
They were competing for first place at the Darwin awards.

On any killer.
---
PC
---
I hear this read in some slow southern redneck voice. I laughed haha
---
Or just make it so he isn't detected by them while his shroud is up. He shouldn't be running around cloaked all the time, so they should apply for most of the match besides when they would completely neuter his ability.
---
Oh lol. Yeah, I've never played PC in my life, mainly cause I have no clue how to use a keyboard xD. I mean I had a keyboard class in junior high but TBH I couldn't remember the keys and I cheated. But I plan on getting one eventually just cause I want Black Desert Online
---
Ghostface has such a dope design, I actually prefer it look over the OG scream robes
---
The only time I get jumpscared in this game anymore is when Myers T1 manages to get the jump on me when I become too complacent lmao
---
Unless it’s a killer that can get around the map quickly, it’s useless
---
Check out hybrid panda and ohtofu. I learned so much about the game watching their vods. They're also incredibly interactive and are happy to answer most questions you direct at them. Good luck in the fog!
---
Perfection
---
That sounds fair to me
---
Do you by any chance have his lore too?
---
😂😂😂
---
Kinda, but a couple things honestly need to be changed. Give her a vault animation, and remove collision while phasing, and I think she'd be in a great spot.
---
Schrödinger's pallet
---
I have no idea but I wanna know too.
---
Dang
---
Deadass used to run it all the time back when I was a rank 15 baby meg just starting out and for some reason I loved it
---
Until I realized how many better perks there were that I could use
---
Anything??
---
No.
---
Missed shot giving the boobs to nea, it fits kate much more tbh
---
That room is absolutely lethal for chasing survivors. I can't count how many times people run in there, and I just immediately lose them. Now if only they'd learn to not bolt and vault that window the second I look away.
---
That or I'll just suicide on my hook.
---
*Shh it's illegal to use the term Killer, they've been banished and our game is now Generator Simulator*
---
You say you want a strong killer, but you're also saying that some of his buffs shouldn't go through. Which is it?
---
Do you honestly think that if all of his buffs go through that he will be on par with the Nurse, Billy, Spirit? Because if not, then these buffs were enough and he should be buffed even more, not less.
---
These devs look for any reason to nerf killers. Threads like this only give them ammo to do so. There needs to be MORE strong killers in the game, not less.
---
Beast of Prey is my jam. Extra 4,000BP per match.
---
Please tell me you're not actually serious.
---
The hatch grab no longer exists. It was removed when the EGC was added.
---
Ahhhhhh, sorry for the misunderstanding. Believe it or not, camping wraiths is why I prefer playing killer now. At least I wont get camped, and I don't camp, so no fun is sucked out of anyone! I still play surv every now and then, but theres always a camping wraith, so I just go back to killer.
---
Btw Jane booty thicc, but not as thicc as Spirit's ass ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
You can see all the changes on the dbd forums, there's a post on this Reddit with a link to the thing
---
Hi, I'm sorta newish and I have a lot of difficulty with spirits as survivor. Do different killers have different wiggle meter amounts?
---
And what do you recommend to out play a spirit player? Out of my top 3 killers to face (bubba, spirit, and Billy) I have the most terrible with fighting spirit
---
[removed]
---
gtfo ;)
---
They said that was a bug that wasn’t supposed to exist so we can imagine it’ll get patched out.
---
You're the person that runs as soon as you hear a heartbeat when a gen is 95% done, aren't you?
---
This is what he should've been like the trailer showed
---
Not at all a factual statement, and I've been in every tier of ranks in the past month, currently sitting at 1 after it all.
---
Oinkvote
---
I don't think you understand what the word "internal" means
---
YOU KNOW I WOULD BE MORE SYMPATHETIC TO THIS IF HITTING THE HEALTHY GUY DIDN'T GIVE HIM A MASSIVE SPEED BOOST OFF TO ANOTHER LOOP WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY LOOPS THAT RESET BLOODLUST (LARGE BUILDINGS) OR TAKE BLOODLUST 3 AND ANOTHER MINUTE TO CATCH THE SURVIVOR (BALANCED LANDING LOOPS).
---
I DON'T WANT TO REWARD KILLERS WHO LEGITIMATELY FACECAMP, BUT IF I AM IN M1 RANGE WHILE SOMEONE IS BEING UNHOOKED, PERHAPS THE UNHOOKER SHOULD BE DENIED HEALTHY-TO-INJURED SPEED BOOST FOR 2-3 SECONDS SO IT'S WORTH HITTING THEM.  
---
THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER WAY TO DENY "SAFE UNHOOK" POINTS (AND WLGF STACK) WITHOUT HAVING TO HIT THE FARMED SURVIVOR WHILE THE OTHER GUY SPEEDS OFF DUE TO WEAPON-WIPE DELAY; LIKE MAYBE JUST *BEING IN M1 RANGE OF AN UNHOOKED SURVIVOR WITHOUT BEING STUNNED* BUT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS WOULD SCREW WITH BORROWED TIME (THOUGH TBH BORROWED TIME DOESN'T SAVE SOMEONE UNHOOKED IN THE KILLER'S FACE EXCEPT IN EGC EITHER).
---
MAYBE IF LETTING THE HOOKED SURVIVOR GO DIDN'T JUST LET THREE SURVIVORS HOP BACK ON SEPARATE GENERATORS AND POP THEM WHILE I'M CHASING THE FARMER; AT LEAST IF I REHOOK YOU, YOU HAVE TO BE SAVED AND HEALED AND LOSE A HOOK STATE WHILE I CAN ALSO CHASE THE OTHER GUY IMMEDIATELY AFTER.
---
MOMENTUM IS AN UPHILL STRUGGLE FOR KILLERS, SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE - AND SINCE NO ONE WANTS MORE M1 GENERATOR SIMULATOR IT ENDS UP BEING THE GUY WHO GOT HOOK FARMED WHO SACRIFICES.
---
Yes please
---
Everyone gets in on the love
---
Switch, Ps4 &amp; Xbox
---
Try move around all the map spaming m1
---
There is a brief cooldown for missed hits. Otherwise, the Unrelenting perk wouldn't exist and Mad Grit would be basically built-in.
---
She is not a permanent NOED killer when survivors are given the OPTION to disable to one-shot at any given time. So your statement is 100% misleading.
---
And no, it is not a pretty strong power even if you could do that. Because it comes at the cost of having to infect them all to begin with, and a good survivor will just play more carefully and lead a chase just fine. Highly doubt you play killer at any kind of competent level frankly.
---
Plague is a mid-low-tier killer for a reason.
---
FEW THINGS ARE MORE ANNOYING THAN A PALLET SAVE THOUGH.
---
[deleted]
---
Even if you 99 someone, if you initiate chase with them, you have to either get spotted, putting it on cooldown or hit them and waste it. And even if you 99’d someone and went for someone else, you have to wait for the cooldown.
---
Absolutely agree.
---
Did u get hit by someone using mad grit? Lul
---
whens double bloodpoints?
---
You can’t really get much more. BP caps at 1,000,000. ATMboi has a decent amount saved lol
---
yo whens double bloodpoints? is it tomorrow
---
Hag and hillbilly too
---
Léry's.
---
Only if Nea is also Frost
---
It’s 40 seconds and compared to Myers 60 base for all 4 people, it’s gonna be average. Great if you catch people with their pants down, but if you get them at a strong loop/structure you’re gonna waste your time.
---
If I recall correctly they said they were indeed making the season last longer and a reward for reaching rank 1. Can't remember any specifics about that though.
---
The real question is can hooked and downed survivors still knock him out of his stealth? Cuz if so that needs to be changed
---
They bugged him if you haven’t seen yet
---
I think they said he’s gonna he immune to OoO while stalking.
---
“How dare my teammates try to survive!”
---
Why not see it as an opportunity to take the aggro and help your teammate?
---
No overhand. He's a keeper!
---
object of obession shouldn't work against him in the ability but noooo
---
Out of all the silly shit I hear survivors cry about being OP I never thought I’d hear “the missed attack cooldown is too short wtf BHVR” lmao
---
After using the search function to find an answer myself, I found you can just pick one from the dropdown menu to the right side. If you don't find what you're looking for, pick any random one and edit it.
---
God damn what do people have against predator it’s so much better than you think
---
What's that from honestly?
---
I was downvoted to oblivion so maybe not
---
14-18th June.
---
OR, how about the teammate steer the killer another direction, allowing their teammates to, oh, I don't know, finish gens so everyone can survive, rather than making everyone abandon the gen and letting the killer break it, making even more work for everyone in order to survive?
---
Oh no.....that's just crazy talk! What WAS I thinking!?
---
Let me guess - YOU'RE "that guy" who gets all their teammates killed leading the killer to them, and then manage to miraculously survive, eh? 
---
SMH
---
Huge!
---
Her outfits don’t need to be sexy? And everyone I know loves this outfit along with myself. And they don’t release cosmetics all at once, only like once a week
---
She do be lookin kinda cute doe 😳😳😳 might date later
---
So when is this live?
---
They should make a pink add on that causes skill checks from the boxes not give a noise notification.
---
Replace this with Pig, Myers and Ghostface
---
Good shit BHVR. Listening to feedback, and actually implementing a quality change.
---
See? This is the power of a communities collective whining
---
I still don't get why they call him a jumpscare killer though, the survivor is notified when they're marked before they're hit, not really that scary, but whatever these are really cool changes.
---
Edit: if he can 99 percent like people are saying, then he'll have actual jumpscares, I can't wait
---
Friday I believe
---
The last skin was pretty nutty.
---
THAT'S THE THING, DON'T LET THE KILLER SEE YOU.  
---
EXCEPT THROUGH BBQ&amp;C, THEN *DO* LET THEM SEE YOU. YOUR BITCH SURVIVOR ASS SHOULD BE 40 METERS AWAY FROM THE HOOK.  
---
I SEE YOU IN THE OPEN? YOU WANT ME TO CHASE YOU BECAUSE THERE'S PROBABLY ANOTHER SURVIVOR WAITING TO UNHOOK BEHIND MY BACK.  
---
THERE'S THIS GENERATOR 80% REPAIRED COVERED IN SCRATCHMARKS AND TWO SURVIVORS DIDN'T SHOW UP ON BBQ? WELL I GUESS I WILL PATROL THE NEAREST THREE GENERATORS FOR A BIT.
---
RUN AWAY, HIDE, CHASING SOMEONE WHO IS PREPARED TO BE CHASED IS OFTEN A TERRIBLE DECISION.
---
Still not faster than survivors, so no crouch chasing, darn
---
Yoooo you met idubbbz?? That's cool
---
Thank Mathieu his outfit is more "Bloody" rather than looking like he just took a bath in organs.
---
*sees crouched speed increase* 
---
*angry oinks*
---
I personally feel as if its a problem with skill floors. Both a good nurse and a good spirit will probably decimate you but a bad spirit will generally do much better than a bad nurse. Don't get me wrong I'll take a Billy over either of them any day but I generally get more frustrated playing against Spirit than Nurse.
---
Oh shit not again
---
I had faith! It was rewarded! Thank you Dead By Daylight Team!
---
I'd imagine staring him directly in the face, even if it's just his head poking out, would be reasonable to disable stalking.
---
Whats your steam? Ill play rn
---
It should be:
---
&gt;When Switch Gameplay from E3 is shown, and it actually runs
---
Looks good 👍
---
I have been picking people off gens since spirit's ptb but you do have to nail the distance. Is it proper to go invis after first hit as wraith? Some seem to do that. 
---
I really just want wraith to have a new power because wraiths are cool to me and his cosmetics are dope.
---
I’ll get you, and I’ll make it look like a bloody accident.
---
I really hope he can be able to do that, it would be a nice buff! I hope no one thinks this is op
---
This actually looks great!
---
god damn love this game
---
THAT'S VALID, BUT I WAS IN THE RADIUS TO BE SEEN BY BBQ AND TITTIES AND CASUALLY MADE MY WAY TO THE HOOK, MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, EXPECTING A HILLBILLY TO BE DOING MORE IMPORTANT THINGS THAN CAMPING A KATE WHO IS OBVIOUSLY A BABY, ESPECIALLY SINCE SHE WAS IN PHASE 2.
---
AND HE HAS THE NERVE TO SIT THERE AND SHAKE HIS FUCKIN HEAD AT ME. WAS I IN THE WRONG FOR STICKING AROUND? ABSOLUTELY. WAS THIS GUY A DOUCHEBAG FOR NOT JUST DOWNING ME AND HOOKING ME INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR KATE TO DIE? I CERTAINLY FUCKING THINK SO.
---
That always sucks. I really enjoyed it. I think it was cool none the less
---
It’s a map of all lockers in the match
---
Please give Laurie some love.
---
IT DOESN'T SAVE MUCH TIME UNLESS YOU'RE DOING POORLY AND EVERYONE IS INJURED, IF YOU ARE INJURED AND THEY ARE INJURED IT TAKES 1.5 HEALS WORTH OF TIME INSTEAD OF 2 HEALS WORTH OF TIME.
---
  
---
ADRENALINE AND DS AND MOM MAY ONLY POP ONCE BUT THEY LOOK OUT FOR #1 AND GIVE AN ENTIRE HEALTH STATE IN EFFECT AND DISTANCE FROM THE KILLER (SPEED BOOST FROM ADRENALINE, MOM HIT BOOST, DS DISTANCE WHILE KILLER IS STUNNED).  
---
WE'LL MAKE IT HAS TO LET YOU HEAL TWO SURVIVORS TO EQUAL ONE OF THOSE PERKS, BUT YOU CAN ALREADY HEAL OTHER SURVIVORS SO IT DOESN'T ADD TO UTILITY, ONLY HASTENS IT. IF YOU'RE REALLY CONCERNED YOU CAN BRING AN EMERGENCY MED KIT WITH ADDONS.
---
If it caps at 1mil then how can he have 1.3mil saved?
---
No please, it's not too much, we don't want a weak ass killer
---
*Freddy crying intensifies*
---
Do you stream or anything? Would love to see what I could learn if you consistently play without Ruin.
---
At least it looks more like that than the last one!
---
Mobile games are shit anyways
---
No, shut it. You people are the reason Freddy was nerfed

---
also the reason he’s bout to be a god tier killer... hmm
---
Maybe we should wait until tomarrow to see how it plays?
---
Lol the picture you painted is advantageous to survivors. Killer breaking a chase to kick a gen and allowing survivors to regroup? That sounds great. 
---
Anyway, I just enjoy helping teammates. I can’t count the amount of times I’m injured and on death hook and a selfless survivor gets in between us and saves the day. I’ll always try to do the same if I feel a survivor needs to be saved.
---
Hopefully... Better camouflage, like the Pig's P3.
---
We do this with myers already, so it's not that powerful
---
GF is a licensed killer, so you can't use shards for him.
---
Do you mean the item descriptions? Or the character lore?
---
Somebody else asked for the item descriptions in this thread as well, I posted them there!
---
It is kind of like calm spirit against doctor. Sure you can run it every game to counter him, but you don't know what killer it will be
---
Character Lore

I was so about to correct you, but the mask is licensed, just not off of the movie. I forgot about that.
---
It isn't canon, all who know of the secret ninja suffer terrible fates.
---
Meaning it may be but let's not speak of it just in case. ;)
---
I would definitely like assassin Feng thou-
---
Ok thanks
---
Ah awesome, it’d be nice to keep my purple emblem a little longer because green is just straight up ugly lol
---
What about hooked and downed survivors taking him out of Night Stalk?
---
Nice try I am not falling for your trap. HIT.
---
It's an awfully long wall text to type, but it's viewable in the PTB. If you can't access that, there are youtube videos that read it out!
---
Thanks, I wasn’t aware of the videos. I’ll check em out
---
That's because they're vases. It's just covered in vases.
---
If pig mask here, i'm in!
---
The pig need to stay the pig
---
He says he has daily rituals and iridescent shards for the shrine saved
---
I still have retired offerings from the beta and 100+ of every item (aside from keys and maps) from before they added other rarities, lol
---
I'm never prestiging Claudette!
---
You'll scream
---
No worries! I've been seeing a good bit of confusion about this.
---
ENDGAME COLLAPSE WILL NEVER BE BALANCED UNTIL THEY FIX DOOR SPAWNS. THE KILLER CAN SEE BOTH DOORS FROM ONE SPOT 90% OF THE TIME AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN.
---
The idea is that ghost face should only be able to stalk if survivors aren't aware he's there, before survivors could detect him even though they had no idea he was there, they're just trying to make the detection true to heart
---
Makes sense
---
Looks like they're wearing their parent's oversized coats
---
I'm not sure why everyone was freaking out that this DLC character was broken (unplayable) and not very fun to play. This is a DLC character they plan to make money on so of course they're going to address these issues as soon as possible so people buy their products. Also the PTB is for testing so, duh. That being said I can't wait to see how these changes pan out.
---
The point thing is really stupid
---
Phillip and sally fuck more than rabbits
---
They said that this was intentional, in order to meet the minimum number of pallets for a map. If a map would have less than the minimum, the distance limit for pallets is removed, and they just start throwing them in anywhere.
---
There is a buffer and you have to directly have him in the center of your screen, no survivor is gonna accidentally detect him anymore
---
so basically identiy 5
---
Bet
---
Exactly
---
I can’t wait for other cosmetics for him
---
Faster crouch movement= faster teabag chases.
---
Yes
---
Self-care is amazing though.
---
You have two choices.
---
1: Use self-care and heal yourself.
---
2: Run around the map (likely without Plunderers, but even with) looking for a chest and hope to get a medkit (or run Pharmacy) if you haven't brought a medkit with you.
---
I can't even get heals from my fellow survivors while the killer is chasing the obsession on the other side of the map at least half the time, and getting them off a generator to heal me is also incredibly hit-or-miss; I can't even always get heals from people running We'll Make It.
---
The content from streamers like Noob3 that I've ingested so far and choices of Adrenaline makes this all the more noticeable at high ranks of play as well.
---
Not only does self-care not waste any effective time (1 survivor for 32 seconds vs. 2 survivors for 16 seconds) in an altruistic team on the rare occasion you get one, it saves a huge amount of time and angst on the majority of occasions that you don't.
---
I have old ass items too on my Claudette, but she’s already p3 so it doesn’t even matter
---
I'm in this to hear the voice actors for the original 4 do a few legion voice lines!
---
This lad just watermarked his meme with an r/ instead of a u/
---
He
---
I know what you mean, but abbreviating Object of Obsession is kinda hilarious.
---
"He's immune to OoO!"
---
Spooky Ghostface, can't even be OoO'd.
---
Ah i thought he meant he already did them and had that much saved up because of them. My bad.
---
lolol it took 10 seconds to see it,
---
keep proving me right lmao, toxic-ass anti-SJW rwnj
---
lgbt pride isn't any more political than black history month
---
"toxic" by your reaction to scream "SJW SJW SJW" at everything that's not compatible with your far-right worldview, that YOU YOURSELF are injecting into numerous apolitical posts on reddit, all lhe while here lambasting the same thing you do.  "Unreasonable" as evidence by your insane, irrational comment history and inability to discuss anything civilly, starting a discussion about Brenda from Scary Movie being some genuine mayocide activist and gems like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/btxemx/ek_snatches_my_friends_bracelet_ed_shouts_at_us/epg4wbo/?context=3).
---
If he's close enough for you to hear that you're already dead o-o
---
Almost as bad as the armchair devs who flood this place with, "Wow, BHVR actually did something good!!" as if they haven't been continually improving their game for a almost as long as it's been out. Jesus, this place is insufferable.
---
He looks like he's covered in tomato ketchup lol, actually disappointed they didn't make the blood look like it's dripping down his face instead of splattered, missed opportunity to make it look like one of those masks with a heart shaped pump everyone had for Halloween as a kid
---
Freddy is getting buffed tho
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
/s
---
We've only had two
---
I’d love Zombie and Scarecrow Ghostface too tbh.
---
Looks more like a Grim Reaper-type thing, to be honest.
---
Now we need the Burger King Myers.
---
Shit that's a pretty huge tell. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.
---
thats 100% a hentai scenario
---
Never
---
I'm new, can someone explain why we don't do that here?
---
I'm actually excited for this because now I can play dead by daylight when I'm skipping class
---
They've said they haven't gotten enough data on the issue to correct it yet. They don't seem to connect this to nobody using it due to the CD, either. It's a real shame, since it was amazing for the one whole month it worked well.
---
Great changes.
---
I'm interested and terrified on how you know this.
---
If I'm getting tunneled and farmed as survivor or a 4 flashlight bm swf team which is usually a couple rank 2s, a rank 3, and their rank 18 friend when I'm rank 12. Matchmaking is top notch on Xbox
---
Tapp doesn't have a sweater, you must have seen Adam
---
Wiki's are mostly made from templates, so they most likely just took Freddy's template. LF's most likely is a modified template as he doesn't have a realm.
---
Yeah I guess, she most likely passed out in a tanning bed for a few days, my bad my bad.
---
Pretty good picture so far.
---
if it's the game or I get farmed in the first 2 minutes of a match
---
Why can’t they just make hitboxes reflect models and design the weapons better?
---
If I was 1 of the 3 survivors, i wouldn't even be mad. shit I mean  we all fucked up big time
---
jrpgs are fine on mobile
---
honestly its console RPGs that are shit these days 
---
its really sad they had a huge fall from grace
---
Wait, there's nothing th-OH SHIT!!
---
Oh fuck. As a Spirit main, thanks for the heads-up!
---
Could also be HDD issue, then. Run diagnostics, verify game integrity, try reinstalling.
---
Not like anyone runs it anyway. It's like Calm Spirit against Doctor or Small Game against Trapper, sure it counters them but are you gonna run subpar perks every game just in case you see them?
---
Tapp doesn't have a sweater cosmetic. Are you sure it was him you saw?
---
Spine Chill no longer affects vaulting speed.
---
**(angry squealing)**
---
they really gotta give rewards for fast killings and combo killings, make this really worthwhile
---
Darn
---
lmao obviously I'm kidding. how is this getting downvoted you Reddit people are so over dramatic
---
cursed_streamers
---
You'd be surprised the reasons why people DC. Too many people quit the moment they're found first
---
you can and should at least turn off the chat from non-friends. good idea when playing competitive mp games
---
People: you can't just make 90 percent of a killers add-ons worthless
---
Bhvr making pig: observe
---
I agree, his Holloween one is amazing, but all of them we're, the rest are either another miner or that weird strong man costume. If like something that would be a bit different, like the Wraiths candle or clowns Santa, stuff like that
---
lol! so all black ppl look the same, eh? ;D
---
Please, I’m so sick of seeing “ggez baby killer” and the like
---
I want to hear the entitys mix tape man
---
I get it so much if I'm on a good run.
---
We need to give DBD more credit. They are trying with recent buffs etc.
---
You can tell it wasn’t rank 1 because the survivors didn’t DC as soon as they all went down lol
---
You need to play hag more man
---
Don't make WGLF better, just buff survivor bp gains as a whole. They really need it
---
mobile DBD? why? when? same account or different from your console one?
---
Is it a surprise survivor players like playing the victim?
---
It will succ the battery like there's no tomorrow tho

IM IN TEARS
---
Swap spade for bloody micropipettor on legion Claudette and I’m sold
---
Looks like OP wasn't invites to the patch notes club :p also he's getting way better than a buff, he's getting a total rework that, from the sounds of it, will make him the Unit he deserves to be :)
---
He looks like he's doing a pretty good job so far.
---
"wow he really got them there"
---
\&gt;sees basement
---
o.o looks like its really GG
---
If someone uses the puzzle piece offering I auto leave
---
Perks like deja vu and windows of opportunity are great for learning where things spawn. Excellent learning tools.
---
They changed all of the lighting affects not just from offerings. Lightborn and Shadowborn don't make the map darker or lighter.
---
It should work like sole survivor with gens so that when a person dies you get a boost
---
Well my intent wasn't to post suggestions on a link to their rework forum. If I do make a suggestion it very clear that that's what I'm doing.
---
I tend to ignore it and let strong loops go when I keep my cool, but the Dwight wasn't at a strong loop and failed the mindgame so basically ran into me.
---
After the first hook it was a matter of running an injured survivor who wasn't near a loop into the ground again, and then waiting for the inevitable troll at endgame.
---
Not all OoO users troll of course, but the ones who sit OoO on you as often as possible rather than quick glimpses tend to, and this one did.
---
I just waited for him to teabag at the other side of a window after he vaulted it, swung, profited from the death hook... And the only time I camped him was when two survivors were nearby according to BBQ&amp;C. &gt;:P
---
Dwight with the bike helmet, xmas sweater, and sweatpants and socks is God tier
---
The most impressive part was no disconnects.
---
Remember when Oblivion made Fallout and RPGs were good on console
---
All killers have the same wiggle meter.
---
Spirit can only see scratch marks when using her power, So in that regard you can just walk when ever you see her stop moving because that means she is using her power.
---
 
---
Just keep in mind that you can't know if she really is using her power or she just stopped moving so she can trick you to come to her side and hit you.
---
  While you are  In her heart beat radius You can't know if she is moving but when you are out of her radius you can hear a vacuum like sound that means she is moving and whenever it becomes louder that means she is closer to you,  She can also hear fast  Vault while using her power , that means you can slow vault and she won't get a notification. 
---
 Also keep in mind that she has a collusion when moving in ghost walk that means if you are moving in her way and she was using her power she will fell  you and that way she know that there is someone in front of her and stop moving so she can hit you.
---
I'm a fan of Myers and Freddy but she seems really fun
---
Mate i'm with you there i close my chat before i start playing killer. 
---
And exactly the reason i am, ALWAYS polite to killers no one needs to put up with this shit.
---
Damn Mcote, you met Idubbbz?
---
These mfs were prob laughing their asses.
---
That's good news.
---
Beware of the probable nerfs.
---
Nope, best thing if you want some like that is friday the 13th and last year: the nightmare(?)
---
I got cool clothes, why do I need bloody clothes?  Only thing I missed was the legacy prestige items
---
Mcote being the man as per usual.
---
Doctor plays a very obnoxious playstyle which I enjoy. He accumulates madness passively in heartbeat range if you're in shocking mode (and your attack in shock-mode gives a large burst of madness) which allows you to make skill checks harder, make survivor scream and reveal their location, and in madness 3 disables most interactions so you can stall the game out.
---
You basically want as large of a terror radius as possible with perks that synergize with a large terror radius (Unnerving Presence, Coulrophobia, etc.) and your mission is to effectively stall the game out long enough for you to get your hooks and kills.
---
If survivors manage to power through anyway I tend to 3-gen to close the game out (There's 7 generators that spawn. Survivors have to do 5, so if you find 3 close together gens and try to protect them as much as possible eventually when survivors do all other gens, when they need to do the last one, it'll be one of those 3 enabling you to have an easier time defending, especially with Overcharge.)
---
He'd get tunnelled to heck
---
I'm not saying anything about that, If they removed the option to make the map brighter or darker for a killer/surv advantage, there won't be an offering to have better field of view for a match. It doesn't add up.
---
WHY DO I HAVE TO BE SUCH AN IDIOT AND NOT GET THE DLC I WANTED BEFORE DOUBLE BP? LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE.
---
Agreed. The killer's normal FOV is far too small and often gives me a headache after just a few matches simply due to how small it is. It's not natural to have that narrow an FOV.
---
It's a place to gauge public reaction and get mass testing to find the not so obvious bugs. It is not a place to find out the the killer's main power is literally broken and unusable in 90% of cases due to a pretty obvious bug, which would cause any public reaction to the parts of the killer after starting the power worthless.
---
For example, the regression on the stalk meter down to nothing might have been fine, but it was impossible to tell because if you looked at the killer for a microsecond they lost their stealth, so who the hell even knows now. They might have over-tuned ghostface into a nerf phase shortly after launch with the stalk meter staying until hit/downed/marked, but who knows.
---
TL;DR: PTB is supposed to be for testing a working baseline and go from there, not something bugged from the literal first step of it's power. That's what internal testing is supposed to find and get fixed.
---
Reminds me of Johnnyboi_i when it comes to rocket league. I love his content, I love his casting. Cant stand his streams when people start spamming messages. Dont get me wrong it can be funny. But it also get annoying when you're trying to focus on the content. Worst is when hes doing a high level replay analysis and pauses it every 30-45 minutes to let the bot do its thing.
---
Unfortunately, kill your friends is the only custom game option. It doesn't work on matchmaking only with people you are friends with.
---
This. Distressing at higher ranks is a gift that survivors will love you for.
---
The whole page for Ghostface is a placeholder for him so that includes his realm which he doesn't have.
---
Yeah it's literally called "Killer Instinct" on Legions power explination. Really cool that they're making it just a general-ish Killer term/power instead of a Legion specific thing. It's a neat tracking method that gets around aura blocking stuff and could have some pretty cool applications in the future if they plan on reusing it for other Killers/perks.
---
How I see it, 45 seconds might sound like a lot, but it only applies to one survivor at a time, making this process of marking take quite a lot of time per survivor. Also, ghost face will either get you immediately after the mark because he was close or you will be looping him. By the time you get to a point where a pallet needs to be thrown down, his exposed effect will probably be close to or lower than half.
---
Like you said though, we'll see
---
This is the definition of chaotic good lol
---
Gracias.
---
Alright thank you so much
---
Nerf nurse, ok i can see where you might be coming from.
---
Nerf Spirit, i dont see anything overpowered in her kit apart from Maybe beads
---
Nerf Billy, hahahaha.... Heh heh...
---
It is tasty.
---
GOD METTLE OF MAN FUCKS ME IN THE ASS. LIKE, IT'S JUST SO MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE DEAD BUT NOPE, I DID THE ONE THING I'M SUPPOSED TO DO AND THEY JUST GET A FREE HIT BECAUSE WHY THE FUCK NOT, JUST BRING 3 SECOND CHANCES WHO GIVES A SHIT.
---
NEW DS IS LESS ANNOYING BUT STILL, WHEN THE GATES ARE OPEN AND THE ONLY INJURED DUDE IS THE UNHOOKED PERSON IT'S JUST LIKE, EGH.
---
Wait, really?! Did they bring the vaulting build back?!
---
All you’ve made clear is that you just wanted to complain. Like this thread is them buffing GF into a space he belongs into and all you’ve done is he negative like idk man but this ain’t it, chief.
---
I’ve almost got my Pig at P2 and still haven’t seen BBQ or Ruin above 1
---
Dwights sharing a locker, seems so natural.
---
God I hate spine chill with urban evasion.
---
Please tell me how you'd Nerf SWF.  Please.  I'm all ears.  Also tell me how the extras not in the SWF group would not get nerfed.
---
In Halloween 5 another girl kissed Myers while he was wearing another mask.
---
You deserve a veterans discount.
---
I'm waiting for a wave of noobs telling you that not cleansing is stoopid and they want you dead for spreading misinformation
---
STOP SITTING THERE ON THE GEN, INCHES AWAY, WHILE IM MOVING INTO PHASE TWO ON THE HOOK, ITS PAINFUL AF TO WATCH THIS HAPPEN.
---
I LOVE WE'LL MAKE IT. I RUN IT ALL THE TIME AND IT'S LIKE, SUPER NICE.
---
Are you suggesting that a species consisting only of females will some how find a way to reproduce?
---
&gt;ruin doesn't make any big difference in a game
---
Guys I found the rank 20
---
Cosmetics &gt; everything
---
That’s what he was talking about but I think it’s a brown leather jacket no ?
---
Life uh... finds a way.
---
Yes but Myers has to stalk you much longer, and he can't crouch or lean to be harder to spot.
---
IM FUCKING MAD BECAUSE MY PC THAT COULD RUN DBD GOT ITS GRAPHICS CARD DAMAGED AND I CANT PLAY FUUUUUUCK
---
You did a good job so far
---
Was wondering if he meant amanda with the mask and outfit or pajama amanda with no mask covered in needles....
---
Same. It feels just so much like the bad outshines the good in this community. I'm willing to admit that's really cynical, but it's hard not to be after dealing with two years of shit like this.
---
The really nice people are those who *actually* play both sides for the reason you mentioned. We know that the person playing Killer really deserves some slack no matter how the game goes.
---
If it helps you, that's awesome. :) I would much rather get bloodhound though!  I feel that's the really great tracking perks he has.
---
Oh, it just came out looking like you meant something else.
---
And then they got a ptb and still didn’t fix him till now...
---
I run that as well plus the addition of stridor my build is as one would call it you’ll never escape
---
But it's already like that without Predator my dude.
---
You did a pretty god job so far
---
Nurse over here is laughing her ass off not giving 2 shits. Kinda makes me wish I'd practice Nurse more but yeah this game just keeps getting stranger and stranger.
---
The "you can run but you can't hide" build.
---
*releases ghostface*
---
“I think we did a pretty good job so far”
---
I wish they would add a Mark Hoffman skin for Pig like the Legion skins.
---
I'll kill you my way
---
Yeah but bloodhound only works if there injured or if they have no mither for some reason
---
Idk just found in my pictures my bad brother
---
Yes that’s an amazing name for it
---
Absolutely unfortunately people just being an arseholes and worse is that people just accept that behaviour and say well that's the way it is. 
---
Even if a get a sweaty killer i'll always say gg and just leave. They tend to the same people that like to abuse the fuck out of killers for the jollies.
---
I’m hoping he’s strong enough to make it to the small pool of high rank killers. We won’t know till we see him in action but the thought of high rank diversity has me drooling ;)
---
IT IS NOT CAMPING THE HOOK WHEN YOUR TEAM IS ALL AROUND THE HOOK. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
---
I agree, still a M1 playtoy for survivors. They are still stronger.
---
That I can get behind. I think Killer is much harder than survivor and rightfully earns more points but survivor should be way more lucrative. 
---
Also? Have survivors reduce the grind in a way that isn't toxic. I've still been farmed even after the change to WGLF by people who don't expect the killer to do the smart thing and go for the weaker target.
---
Maybe the deal they had with freddy license wasn't worth their time until they had more revenue coming in to focus on him. I'm sure now that the game is well known they can work better license deals which would explain the time put in on the newer killers.
---
I don't really know I am just stretching for a reason.
---
Oh, ok. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
There's a lot of variability between the people who criticized it and the people who were melodramatically flailing around acting like BHVR releasing a weak Killer was a personal attack on Killer mains. Those people still look foolish.
---
I liked the idea one person on a criticism video had. This person made a comment in the comment section that said he should just have Michael’s ability to stalk even when detected, but the exposed status effect doesn’t take place until you reach bloodlust.
---
Depends on whether or not you're willing to spend more time with the character and that alone.
---
Oh ok, yeah I clearly need to reread that because I didn't interpret it well at all.
---
Yeah it’s 302. I can’t even log in though. How do I send a ticket in?
---
Unexpected bug. Set to be removed.
---
Thanks! :)
---
Now he seems like he'll be super fun to play, I'm excited!
---
If you don't escape before that bar is empty the entity will kill you
---
I was there.
---
I finally got it and it’s not as amazing as I thought it would be but it’s nice as a safety net in case you’re getting looped
---
It wasnt connection based. I’m a killer main and the lobby was &lt;100 ping. Pretty sure this was a glitch
---
Oh how lovely
---
And somehow they still got ruin
---
I played insidious Leatherface and hid around corners in houses in Haddonfield today, this was also the survivors reaction when they got chainsawed outta no where
---
Jumpscare Bubba=Best Bubba
---
Replace Freddy with pig
---
“Well, that ain’t good.”- Buster Feng
---
And then you bought a dlc
---
It's so survivors cant just hide for an eternity
---
wasn’t connection based, lobby was completely fine until then. Perfect connection.
---
EW1/2/3= Evil Within (Myer's power) tier 1/2/3. 3 is the temporary stage where he has longer lunges, normal terror, vaults faster, and makes all the survivors Exposed. (Tier 1 is shorter lunge, lower speed, 8m terror radius, immune to detection perks. Tier 2 is normal m1 killer stats but only 16m terror and faster vault I think)
---
So while Myers has a limited number of global, 60-second Exposed windows (because he can only build so much from each survivor), Ghostface stalks the specific survivor, seemingly with no limits to how many times he can Mark a survivor and with a 45 sec duration. Ghostface can be caught in the act, but then gets info on who revealed him.
---
They can dish it, but they certainly can't take it.
---
Oh yeah that’s a good thing. Me likey
---
JUST RUN SLOPPY BUTCHER ITS INFINITELY BETTER THAN BLOODHOUND
---
But useless otherwise.
---
So you always survive, able to rescue all your teammates from face campers, AND can keep aggro for the entire match without dying? EVERY GAME!? Nice!
---
US WTAITH MAINS HAVE CLASS I’M SORRY MRS I’M A RANK 1 NURSE MAIN
---
Asari
---
Actually predator makes it worse. Scratch marks already last long enough for you to maintain a chase. With Predator, you end up having too many scratch marks lasting for way too long, making things confusing as well when the survivor breaks LoS and you have a giant field of scratch marks going in every direction from when you were chasing them earlier.
---
Maybe a little bit higher crouch speed.
---
That’s the new end game collapse. Now once the exit gates are opened, or if you’re the last survivor and the killer closes the hatch (yes that’s a thing now) then egc is triggered starting a timer. If you don’t get out before it depletes (it’s depletes more slowly if someone is downed or hooked) then the entity is summoned from the ground and eats you :p
---
Bloodhound doesn't work on No Mither because No Mither doesn't leave pools of blood. You must be trolling.
---
Would you say it was a pretty good... job? So far??
---
I never knew you could hear him walking
---
I consistently wonder why there are so many children in this game.
---
Are you joking all predator does is make scratch marks tighter
---
Yeah
---
Lmao ok
---
Oh what a day, WHAT A LOVELY DAY!!! Yeah that’s good, that should prevent endgame dicklards from hiding
---
Base nurse is borderline fun to play against. Some maps she's still bullshit, but I genuinely enjoy playing against her with no add ons. 
---
Range or added blinks? Good luck, you need maybe 3 brain cells to win with it.
---
Yep, exactly why the implemented it. Rejoice!
---
I must be thinking of original Predator then when it just made scratch marks last several seconds longer, which was garbage and made shit way too god damn confusing.
---
Legion Dwight starts the trial in a locker.
---
I'm excited for the rework cause when it goes to ptb if we don't like it we can voice it before we are stuck with it
---
*Cries in chainsaw noise*
---
Having 5,000 bp rely on surviving, which isn't always your fault if you don't, is bs
---
Myers is so worth it!!
---
Leatherface for BBQ &amp; Chili.
---
Michael 🔪
---
HE NEVER FUCKING SKIPPED LEG DAY
---
this scene is the only reason i never rewatched saw 2
---
I'm still amazed at how well Bethesda got their games to run well while not looking like ass on switch, especially doom
---
Yeah same, I want to switch to PC but I’ve already got near a thousand hours, every meta perk for survivor, 700k bloodpoints, and a lot of cosmetics on my Xbox

---
Michael also isn't spending all game in Tier 1. At most, he's in Tier 1 for 40 seconds. So for Michael, it makes sense. But killers who spend all game crouched or invisible, it is designed that way for balance.
---
Another "you should just leave" moment  
---
That feng *seriously* miscalculated, if not straight up cucked herself
---
this is everything i wanted for my smol myers
---
Ya I'm actually trying to get a good loadout for Freddy in prep for his rework.
---
Those are not in the game and I don't think ever have been? I'm talking about the final art for the characters you can find in the art book, or those they show on stream sometimes. Not a old, outdated trailer from when the game and it's characters were envisioned almost entirely different.
---
Bro this should be an achievement for Leatherface.
---
That's the only time insidious is acceptable
---
Lots of the community liked the addition of EGC. The timer used to be 3 minutes in the PTB, and was shortened to 2 when it hit live.
---
They’re adding a second PTB to test the new changes.
---
It's better than that. Ghost is comparable to EW2 with Dead Rabbit (8m "terror radius" and moving at full speed) by default every time you use your stealth but with the added effect of no red stain. All while also having the ability to expose any single person if you can stalk them enough.
---
This might be too much of a buff. Kinda feels like power creep in a way.
---
BUT YOU JUST SAID THE ADDON THAT DOES THE SAME THING IS BAD (also get destroyed)
---
Definitely.
---
While I'm kinda glad they're trying to make the hair look more like hair and I'm super pleased they're removing the hair rubber banding; I didn't really think certain cosmetics needed or were improved by the change.
---
That said, it's just my personal opinion and I didn't buy any of the effected head cosmetics with auric cells, so I don't really think I personally have that much room to complain.
---
Don't
---
( insert Michael Rosen here ) NOICE
---
Can
---
IT HAS EXTRA STEPS LIKE 4 SECONDS ADDED TO BLOOD POOLS
---
(XD)
---
I really like territorial...
---
We coo
---
Great
---
Oh no, I didn't know this concerned all the characters and Jeff as well, I thought it was just some aesthetic changes. That's a shame. D:
---
Yeah now we just have toxic killers abusing it
---
I understand, and now see how that picture can be deceiving. I took another one at a further back angle but you couldn’t see the blood-points as well so I went for this one haha
---
Where's the actual part where the girl kisses him lmao I wanna see that
---
*furious bill noises*
---
18th last I heard.
---
The 18th my dude
---
The 18th
---
Pig doesn't rely on her stealth like Ghostface.
---
That
---
This makes me feel sad ..
---
Same. I keep watching streamers and YouTubers play and love it but when I play I usually get frustrated. Pretty sure I'm really bad also so that doesn't help QQ
---
Thank you so much! I really like drawing Leatherface camping, for some reason. He's in a lot of the projects I'm working on. Poor Meg...
---
Thank you so much!
---
I really appreciate that! Thank you very much. I do think hers turned out best out of the four, yeah.
---
I don't sell them, but I do give them away on my Twitch channel, RoryDiesALot. I do about 6 - 10 giveaways per week.
---
Thank you! I'm glad you like it!
---
I like to send pics to the killer of their killer. Usually bad ass pics I get from this subreddit (thanks for all the og content everyone).
---
Reminding the killer there are people having fun is my intent cause I hope they are having fun.
---
Normally, they're glass things that you hang on the wall with suction cups. But when I saw these frames, I thought they'd probably make good suncatchers. You do have to put them right up to a light source for them to glow, but they're pretty fun!
---
If the killer waits for more than one second to pick me up then I DC immediately
---
This is truly traumatic 🤔 never seen past the first film and yeah I'm OK now
---
Yeah he's secretly a really negative asshole like you, and he's just faking the positivity and joy for the fans. Ugh, the nerve of this guy...
---
Ah, what a great guy! I hope you had fun!
---
Windows stays decently on RNG heavy areas as well.  Sure, knowing all the possible spawn points of a window is good, knowing for a fact that window is actually open that round is rather important though if you are running a long series of loops.
---
It's from the discord, I believe
---
Pretty good job so far?
---
Same tbh. Although every time I watch a stream I get an urge to play and then do 2-3 rounds and then I get reminded why I was watching the stream in the first place
---
This is brutal. But I agree.
---
His lunge is normal in tier 2
---
 I remember I sent this meme to someone at 3am cause I couldn't sleep and they got all pissed once I won lol ahhh... Good times... Good times.
---
I use a bbq, ruin, lullaby and discordance build.  Mainly because I've been unlucky on my legion to get "real" perks.
---
noone cares
---
There was a post some months ago that the bloodpoints could reach like 320,000 for a perfect game with double bloodpoints. It made no mention of those perks, however, so I can't confirm additional bonuses.
---
In the chat box you can click on the speech bubble to the right hand side. It just closes the box same to reactivate it.
---
Myers is a great Character in general with okay perks. 
---
Leatherface isn’t that great but all 3 of his perks are not bad. Bbq and Chili is a Really good perk, Knocked out is alright and Franklins Demise is not bad unless of course no one brings anything.
---
Spirit and Nurse are The best killers alongside Billy.
---
Yeah, but it’s better than Tier 1. I should’ve also mentioned the huge speed increase between tier 1 and 2.
---
I'd rather not get knee-jerk buffs/nerfs due to initial outcry that over-tune things and requires a second or third pass months later for them to get to adjusting, especially if people weren't really able to test how a killer's power was supposed to work out initially due to a major bug.
---
The current changes might be all that is needed for ghostface and he won't end up like freddy where he breaks lower ranks and then is nerfed to the ground and gets a rework in 1.5 years.
---
You think this deserves anything more than a safety pip?
---
Nea is getting physics to some of her hairs I believe. They look a lot better too.
---
I dont get stressed.. i just relish in the fact that i still got twice as many BP as them, despite having a terrible match.
---
but no bunny feng :(
---
I like the way the new hairs look except for Claudette. They straight up butchered her hair in the update and im pretty sure im not touching it again if it goes through
---
Wow you seem negative.
---
Yes, there is a "shimmer" visual effect when the Wraith moves.
---
Listen here you nerd
---
100 k shhould be a normal game as a surv\\killer without any perks\\addons withh the current amount of grind ( Like what, 10k lvls to perk everyone in p3?)
---
But I like tar bottles.
---
Nice.
---
My legacy meg gets dodged a lot... even though i'm terrible.  I took like 2 years off.  Old school not always skill!
---
Thank you good sir
---
I mean... Can you confirm this? Also this feels like a joke because your complaining about someone spreading joy.
---
Arguably, deja vu also helps prevent three gen setups as well.
---
Take it from personal experience, artists can get pretty upset when people don’t credit them. Just remember to always credit an artist if you can.
---
I would use that body cosmetic with the original Ghostface mask
---
Huntress snipes are the best part of this game to me. Very nice.
---
HAHAHA. My absolute fav
---
Watching any of the dev streams youd know by now that Freddy is getting a lot of love after Ghostface release.
---
You gotta be shitting me.
---
Not really, since killers (as seen here) can just knock the hatch shut while the survivor is mid-jump.
---
I'll have to look at all the changes then. 
---
I mostly just play as default Nea because I'm not that big a fan of her non-beanie head cosmetics.
---
lmao wittle survivor bitch
---
The intent is noble, but honestly, a BP gain for going against SWF is like trying to put a band-aid on a severed limb.
---
Mastering killer takes time man. It's all about experience and having a good chase game. Knowing how to run certain tiles, what perks to run, when to abandon chases and how to apply pressure. 
---
Your post was very vague so I can't give you specifics, but a great DbD killer main and streamer ScottJund has a general killer guide on youtube. I suggest you check it out. 
---

EVERYTHING IS BAD, EVERYONE IS OUT TO GET YOU, TRUST NOBODY BUT YOURSELF AND ME
---
I would turn of chat for the time being. Watch some tutorials for perk builds, that will help a lot. in this community almost everything is toxic at one point or another so don’t worry about that. If ai were you i’d try out different killers until you find one that fits. Learn to use their ability to your advantage! Over time you’ll definitely be amazing, it’ll take practice. Focus on being able to find survivors and keeping up with them when they run from you. Learning the maps layout also helps a ton.
---
The fifth Legion is Stretch Armstrong.
---
You can’t. Either start all over or continue on said account.
---
Not saying they don’t exist just that they shouldn’t
---
Only way to use dlc is if ur main account is primary n u bought the actual add on pack through the Playstation store
---
Using cells is equalivate to using blood points n shards
---
Makes sense. I haven't played on console. Thanks for clarifying.
---
If they rewarded Killers for doing that then Killers who want to push their rank up will keep doing the sweatiest shit to speedrun games.   
---
And then BHVR would have to start nerfing and consistently slowing down the ability to close games out so fast.
---
Yes officer this post right here
---
After thinking about it more I think all the changes were necessary for his QoL. The fact the stalk meter doesn't deplete anymore is AMAZING I thought it was depleting super quickly. 20 seconds to 45 seconds for the marked target is a significant buff for him survivors will now actually be scared to get exposed. Movement speed for crouched being up helps a lot. The big changes to getting him out of his power will hopefully help him a lot.
---
WHY THE FUCK DO I ALWAYS DIE WHEN I'M RUNNING ALTRUISM DAVID!? I ALWAYS GET FUCKING TUNNELED! (PROBABLY BECAUSE OF DEAD HARD.)  I ALSO NEVER GET MY BORROWED/WE'LL MAKE IT HOOK SAVES BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS. FUCKING. FARM!
---
Equally as destructive is the mindset that companies are your friends. They aren't.
---
Aww man... Well thanks. I'm gonna be seeing a lot of GG EZ's from survivors for sure darn....
---
Plus Myer's isn't even purely stealth, you can also play him very aggressively as he can't have his ability stopped, it even helps in a chase with vaults and lunges
---
You were close enough to morí him and you failed us
---
Just play legion, you may not win but get satisfaction from them not having fun
---
But the problem is then I don’t have fun
---
Hits that weren’t earned, leatherface and tunneling
---
Oh, didn't know that, thanks for sharing
---
If survival category wasnt solely based on getting out, it would be nicer.  Like losing killer in a chase should be survival, not bold.
---
I disagree that killer is harder.  My worst killer games I still get more BP than my best survivor ones.  Sure sometimes they all get away, but I still roll in BP at the end.
---
Because this subreddit is mostly killer mains.
---
Killed all 4, but didn't use your power once?  Here, have 12,000 blood points.  Goes both ways buddy.
---
I really hate the bloody look on everyone but the cannibal. So I'd say don't waste the effort prestiging.
---
Yeah but its some that might make some people stay in a match against hardcore swf it's nice to have a candy after being slapped across the face
---
First game with the shape
---
Now this does put a smile on my face
---
I mean, we already have both dwight and ace.. xD
---
God forbid someone tries to make a living. He goes well and beyond and has proved countless times he does care about the game.
---
Yes, and Myers could make do without being detection immune as well, it's just a nice bonus. I still don't see what relevance this has to Ghostface though.
---
Oh my... just thinking about it... holy hell yes!
---
With that toxic attitude I can also assume you facecamp the person who just got off hook
---
It's odd. They try to encourage you to toy with survivors and to make a game more... I'd say enjoyable for them instead of camping one or tunneling them down. But sometimes the survivors are bad or make a really bad mistake and it makes the game end too fast. Then you get punished for it. It's disappointing at times, I know.
---
So what I gather is your team kept running straight to her and you were used as bait.
---
This.. Scorpz is amazing.. just try to ignore his community, they are toxic af.
---
Would you expect anything less from this community? ;p
---
Doesn’t make sense in lore but give him a rope so he can put survivors on hook
---
Found the toxic survivor
---
I am
---
WHY DO I READ THIS THREAD LIKE A PSYCHOSTICK VIDEO?! IT'S HILARIOUS AF BUT WHY?!?!?!!
---
Billy's add-ons make him incredibly strong, but without them, he's' fine imo.  
---
You can say the same about Nurse, though.
---
Same goes for Nurse
---
So Killer is weird and strats vary from killer to killer. I recommend play each killer and learning how each operates and which ones are strong at what. A lot of stuff i learned about map presence from Hag and looping from Billy and Wraith. I recomend watching Monto, Spacecoconut, Ohtofu, and Umbra.
---
I concur
---
Without them, yes. With them, no. And Nurse isn’t the topic, but she can be included
---
Play any killer you're good at with BBQ &amp; Chili, use puddings whenever you can.  
---
I usually get 1 million BP in about 3 hours or so.
---
Some killer add-ons are just bullshit, sadly.
---
They're going through and changing Nurse once the Ghostface and Freddy changes are all settled down, if they nerf her Billy better follow
---
Well the new Leather Pig is pretty much inspired by one of the outfits that Hoffman wears when 1st helping Jigsaw. Except it is Amanda wearing it instead.
---
There aren't any good perks on the shrine, but Tenacity with unbreakable or Quick and Quiet with Dance With Me can be pretty fun.  
---
Killer perks are pretty bad this week.
---
Killer gets more bloodpoints, it doesn't matter if you win or lose as long as you're doing something throughout the match, have some chases, kick some gens, break some pallets, etc. Bbq awards bonus bloodpoints for each hooked survivor as well so you can use that as a boost to both gameplay and BP earning.
---
Lets be honest, Nea would be baraka
---
first time i got a perfect game against a good team as doctor i was almost screaming it was wild
---
grats op
---
are you me?
---
It's 45. And he can pretty much use his power nonstop, right? 
---
Also nobody plays BASE Myers so that's a REALLY weird comparison
---
But I guess it doesn't matter, if these buffs happens to be too much they'll adjust some stuff back. No need to think too much about it
---
Should I get tenacity then or save my shards?
---
You get used to it :/
---
No Bad photoshop
---
The balancing in this game is so strange. Survivors have better perks and a general gameplay advantage (at higher levels), and I’m not even considering SWF here. Most Killers aren’t even competitive when you consider how insanely powerful Nurse is. But even with those advantages and disadvantages, Killers have such a clear BP gain advantage. I wonder how intentional this is.
---
That looks better than a rage quitting legion after I loop them for the entire game on wrecker's yard.
---
Waiting for the post to load like 🤔
---
I always 3hook people.  If they're on death hook, i slug them until everyone is on death hook then i finish them all off.  If they get out, they get out.. and i roll in my yummy BPs.   I do still 4k a lot though.
---
I just get to red ranks and stop playing until rank reset. Wish my experience was like yours.
---
I didn’t diss the game I dissed the fact that all these killers mains are petty about nothing and saying that survivors have the advantage when we obviously don’t
---
I would have given claudette the hatch for not having a flashlight xD
---
Monitor + Dead Rabbit for good times 😎
---
Are EW3 duration increasers really that common? I mostly run into Memorial/Tuft or Rabbit/Flower. I always assumed the stalk increase wasn’t worth the extra time added but I also hardly see Myers.
---
Ok...does this matter. I mean im not the guy who played you but this seems dumb.
---
Ahh ive treaded onto survivor main, small brain, grounds.
---
when you crop out the meme part of my meme to make me look like a shit person even though I was just trying to watermark my meme
---
[my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/by89w9/hot_and_spicy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)  for anyone that doesn’t believe me
---
These changes are AMAZING but something was really needed to be removed.
---
its the ability to detect ghostface while dying/hooked state...
---
 I honestly thought they would remove it no brainer... but oh well.. these new changes cover this.
---
Beat me to the punch 😋
---
Ey yo!! Pick up the phone!!!
---
Lag switching isn’t made by the game... It’s not because some player use it that the game is killer based.
---
Big brain big Jane
---
Let me guess? Tunneling trashcan?
---
Not Too Late &amp; Hex: Disclosed need some value buffs.
---
didn't expect it to run that great! Definately looking forward to the release
---
Nurse will still be te best killer tho.
---
Him and the Huntress should do a duet.
---
I got grabbed by an anal beads spirit today, so gonna say it still works.
---
Yeah baby, yeah!
---
*I hate myself for that*
---
That’s terrifying
---
I’m really glad we went from prequels to Jurassic seamlessly. This entire sub deserves cake.
---
For me, it was my first survivor game in the Swamp with zero clue of what to do. 
---
The pre-tutorial, bought the game on a whim, days.
---
I can't tell who met who
---
Heyyyy. Can i get a D E J A V Uless bloodweb and a 2 level of ruin
---
Entity: fuck kinda bloodweb?
---
BM means bad manners. She was being toxic by hanging out around the hatch purposefully fast vaulting the window to get my attention instead of just leaving, and as you saw it ultimately led to her downfall.
---
Got em now? Good, want again? Okey dokey here ya go.
---
Noed? Im just an idiot but what is it
---
oh, thank you♥️. the feng deserved it to be honest lol
---
These are all pretty nice and different from the norm. Search and Destroy would be amazing with Clown.
---
They have the license for the mask not for ghostface himself
---
These look amazing. :)
---
I've seen this meme used with dbd, Warframe, destiny, Nintendo, overwatch, and many other game characters.
---
Wait, so he chased you or tunneled you?
---
I'm confused.
---
The thing is the tip of her sword hit her before th pallet hit her
---
Yea if you lose to a camping killer then you have to question the ability of your team to do gens...
---
I remember picking it after the change and thinking they made it a solid location perk.
---
Fuck off, not everyone needs to be Rank 1 to be happy about their accomplishments.
---
Noone escapes death?
---
I can confirm Freddy is easier with newer survivors. Survivors that just think Freddy is OP because he's invisible when they're not asleep. Survivors in around rank 13-20 mostly don't know how to deal with Freddy and just thinks his OP.
---
Tunneled. A nea and Claudette tried running into him multiple times and he ignored them. Also after I got hooked he instantly came to the hook and tunneled again and again until finally I get hooked for the last time and there’s only 1 gen that got done
---
Flashlight him he hates that!!
---
I guess I don't get this - what did the person do that upset you and was "dishonorable"? Did he message you or something?
---
Just curious.
---
well they could think that the killer just left....nvm it takes 6 secs to get the terror radius away
---
Well killers do have to work harder and Barbecue &amp; Chilli is very common 
---
maybe make WGLF the opposite to Barbecue &amp; Chilli where the killer's aura is revealed to everyone unless he's in a 40 meter radius of the hook
---
#
---
no, that's not camping. it is frustrating but i wouldn't blame you. the survivors were idiots. 
---
but i wouldn't do the same as killer cause i like bloodpoints and pips and i'm tired of getting 4k and -pip just because i faced potatoes who don't know how to play. literally have to make the game longer to get my pips.
---
She's the second newest survivor, and only that because Ash was a sudden drop.
---
It hasn't been *so* much time.
---
Remember when spies was good for like a week
---
"This is going to get so many upvotes!!"
---
I've only ever DC'd twice. The first time was because the Huntress was holding the game hostage, and the second time was because the game refused to load (not the short freeze you sometimes get, either. I mean full on five minutes straight) besides that, I have never DC'd. I don't see the point in doing it. You aren't getting any bloodpoints, you're just making the game harder for your teammates, you lose your items and offering, and you just wasted your own time
---
Pog
---
Here's a game I had against A B C and D. I find and hook A. Then later A gets saved and I mori him. I find B and hook him. Then I chase C, down them. Then go down B and D. b disconects. I hook C and D.
---
I don't pip because this game decided that I HAVE to hook people 9 times. U didn't get enough chase, hits. Only thing keeping me from depipping is gen emblem.
---
If this leather face wanted to pip, hed have to have hooked 3, then let someone get up and unhook the rest.
---
This system is bad
---
You should focus on learning and improving instead of complaining and insulting your opponents.
---
This is like a Facebook group post cringe and I feel sick
---
None of them - get out there and play the game.
---
I mean, you can get ideas from them, but developing your own play style is most important.
---
MOTHER FUCKERS DONT REALIZE YOU CAN PLAY TO UNLOCK LEGION? UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE! FUCKING FREE WEEKEND PLAYERS!!!!!
---
Bad teammates, definitely. I'd rather go against a five blink Nurse with an ebony mori or an instadown Huntress than have to deal with three people who crouch at the corners of the map when there's five gens left
---
sounds pretty
---
Unpopular opinion: the oinkers are cringe ☕️🐸
---
Yeah woops my bad, I can’t complain when fucking rank 2s get in my game as a new player, please fuck off
---
YOU KNOW WHAT TAKES SET UP? GETTING GOOD AT THE GAME, SO IT DOESN'T GET TO ENDGAME, KEEP PRESSURE AND FUCKING DO YOUR JOB. DONT BITCH ABOUT GEN RUSH WHEN ITS THE OBJECTIVE MOTHERFUCKER GET THE FUCKING BALL ROLLING BEFORE YOU GET FUCKED IN THE BUTT BY SURVIVORS AND MOTHERFUCKER DONT USE FUCKING NOED THAT SHITS ANNOYING EVEN AS A FUCKING KILLER MAIN MOTHER FUCKER FUCKING FUCK YOU AND YOUR FUCKING NOED MOTHER FUCKER
---
ok so he's not the worst killer in the game now. Will see how it plays from here. It's a real fucking shame however they launched the PTB with him broken... I mean did they even once login and check him? It was apparent to anyone who tried him within 5 seconds of entering a trial he was fucking broken.
---
Also, if you want to buy perks, look for perks that unlock at level 40. It will save you time to get through those levels.
---
yeah it seems everyone kind of forgot about that
---
so wait, are we the baddies
---
He's not? Any xo.ptent survivor looks behind them in a chase. A point blank Myers is more dangerous since he gets the doubles lunge range and increased vault speed
---
Overreaction at it's finest
---
Leatherface.  BBQ is mandatory.
---
After I've had a rough game playing killer and the survivors are particularly toxic I like to look at their trophies to see if they play predominately survivor. The vast majority of them have had over 70% of the trophies unlocked with multiple adept killers and various killer achievments. These people should know better but they still act like complete assholes when they play survivor.
---
I hate to say this but they really 'did a pretty good job so far'
---
It means you can’t just spin the camera around while working on a gen and it automatically cancel our GF’s power.  Instead now you’ve actually gotta put him in the middle of your screen and hold it for a second or two
---
Even then you have to break a chase, not be blocked by obstacles, be close enough...
---
It's a shit perk
---
I mean that's what I'm saying. If Myers, a killer that doesn't really need that immunity because his ability can be used without stealth is allowed to have that immunity, I think ghostface should definitely have that ability built in. Particularly because of how strong spine chill is
---
I see this as an absolute win!
---
320k for killer, 256k for survivors I think.
---
You can’t say anything bad about killers or all of them will come at you with pitchforks and torches even thou you are right
---
Thanks, I will look into those perks. I usually use Wraith put I went for Hag instead so I had nothing lol
---
More likely were gonna get a roblox and fortnite chapter
---
Killers shouldn’t dodge or dc in the first place, stop catering to them hating on swf.
---
Hahahaha
---
sloppy butcher is available to you now. the three other perks i mentioned are teachables. spirit fury is from spirit, nurses calling is from nurse, and enduring is from hillbilly. 
---
a non-teachable perk build for her that's okay is make your choice, sloppy butcher, bitter murmur. last perk is up to you.. whispers and surveillance are both decent for keeping track of survivors.
---
I do play a lot of killer but I see your point, still vengeful griefing isn't the solution.
---
When game decides to F you up and gives you sprint burst, lithe, dead hard and balanced landing all in one game 🤣
---
I'd like a lot more than a candy after being beaten into a pulp.
---
GET OVER HERE
---
I know they shouldn't but alot do because it's not worth the extra effort that dodging to get a better lobby would give so giving just a little bit isnt going to be alot but just enough to stop it from making a 4 man wait another 30 mins
---
Yeah sure I do, you told me I had no reason to complain about being piledrived by experienced players as a newbie, what were you expecting? Me to say “ok, I guess rank being unfair in this case is fine?”
---
That’d be like saying giving survivors a bonus for playing solo?
---
*cries in Freddy*
---
I don't think it was meth she was taking.
---
Especially considering she went to a health clinic to get some drugs I assume she was just abusing drugs in general. She was more of a typical junkie than a super hardcore drug user
---
haha and thats without bbq
---
Omg 😂
---
3 am here and I misread that enough to believe burger king sold Myers socks.
---
Lawful Bastard
---
The only way you can play DLC characters on different accounts as if you bought the DLC fully purchasing it with auric cells will only get it for you on that specific profile.
---
Ochido
---
The fuck is that?!
---
Hahaha, however consider that i prefer to go after the unhooker of I'm nearby. And have never farmed a teammate. But also play legion for fun.
---
If you like playing Survivor and Killer equally, or you like playing Killer more, I would buy a Killer. Since Killers actually have unique powers, buying one of them is more valuable than getting a Survivor, which is ultimately just a skin. Basically, if you want a Survivor Perk, you can just buy it in the Shrine of Secrets, but you can't buy a Killer's power.
---
For Killers, I would definitely recommend The Spirit. She's a bit of a harder one to learn, admittedly, but she's also one of the best Killers in the game and it's so, so worth it. She has a lovely aesthetic, and her power is *a lot* of fun once you get used to it. Lots of mindgame potential, too, if you're into that (you should be :p). If you're on PC, my other recommendation would definitely be The Hag. Not quite as good as The Spirit, but still up there, and a lot of fun. The two of them both have good Teachable Perks as well, so you really can't go wrong.
---
Face camping is only going to hinder your bloodpoint gain. Even if they all escape just relax and focus on hitting them and defending gens. Face Camping ruins the game as if it happens to you then you’d be salty.
---
Well, I mean like, not really blind, so.... nor was it even a far shot
---
I still have winter party starters and the 3k gift box in my bloodweb lol
---
Tbh spirit fury and bbq show up on my blood webs pretty often 🤷‍♀️
---
Hahaha yes
---
buy thicc mama
---
I mean I guess we could just agree to disagree.
---
I actually laughed way harder than I should have
---
Have fun supporting serial killers
---
Maybe honestly. But i rarely t-bag or do the clicky clicky thing
---
McCote doesn't hover hand, what a legend.
---
That is a meg. This a screen shot I got from playing as hag. I saw something flash on screen recorded it and went back to find this horrible thing
---
I love that title
---
Ghostface was a halloween costume before the movies made it famous.  So BHVR got the mask license from them.
---
Is this game made by French people?
---
Came here to say this! Man the end of 2 makes me want a 3rd where he finally dies
---
Wait, there’s a second???
---
I see it now. It shocks me to my core. Thank you.
---
Or Nea. Nea in this outfit would be cool.
---
Dude I think you're taking this a little bit too seriously.
---
I'm saving a fictional character is not as bad as she seems as there are definitely reasons to attest to why she did what she did.
---
Never once did I ever state that the actions she committed was right or that she should have been forgiven for them.
---
What I stated was I felt sympathy because coming from a similar background with family abuse and emotional dependency I can at least understand the root of her actions.
---
And why she felt so broken during Saw 3.
---
If you honestly read me saying that a fictional character is not as bad as she seems or as bad as people present her. Then come to the conclusion that I'm supporting serial killers, you need a serious reality check.
---
For the love of God get off your damn high horse.
---
Yes! Sorry for the minor spoiler then
---
With heels.
---
I ALWAYS GET LERY'S WITH BILLY, WANNA SWAP?
---
Ignore that dude, he's just incapable of understanding the whole reason of playing a game is to have fun.
---
My first killer play was with Myers too, he's hands down my fave to play! Congrats on the 4k man :)
---
Thanks for the question! A cursed survivor must find another shrine on the map to work on if it fails. And thanks for enjoying this idea!
---
Shut up an take my money
---
FYI killers can also trigger endgame collapse by opening the doors themself or closing the hatch
---
But why tho?
---
He’s still an M1 killer, so the best perks are the one that end chases fast. Spirit fury, enduring is a must.
---
the only time I tunnel someone if they run into me like a dumbass or heal in the open using selfcare because they're 'safe'
---
As I said my issue it's not with whether she's a Killa my issue is that you honestly consider someone saying they are sympathetic of the hardships in a person's life and supporting and condoning their actions as one in the same.
---
I'll say it again get off your high horse.
---
no not at all, I appreciate you putting it on my radar. Do you happen to know the name by chance?
---
Get ready for it...Creep 2 lmao
---
Hahaha, I should have guessed
---
I believe it's on Netflix, If not its definitely on Shudder. Enjoy it though!
---
45 sec is good, think about it. Billy and leatherface “basicly” have an expose status effect the whole game.
---
LOOK HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOYHVR
---
Appreciate it!
---
I think its pretty cool, I have an OC as well but I'm still working out the kinks such as his power and unique perks
---
Goodbye
---
Not a problem!
---
Thanks!
---
It really depends on which killer you're playing, but one useful bit of advice that goes for all killers is to not be afraid to stop chasing a survivor to go after another one(s). Example, if you are chasing a David and you hit him, then he runs to a really strong loop, and has shown that he knows how to loop, instead of playing his game and wasting time, leave him and patrol the gens. Not only can you find much easier prey, you also force the David to play while injured, making it easier when you find him again since he doesn't have that free hit to run to a loop. You also force him to heal (if he can by himself) or seek out other survivors, which both wastes time for them. Another benefit from doing this is that you can injure/down more survivors, giving you even more time. You'll notice at the lower ranks that survivors play very paranoid while injured and will make more mistakes. Now, when I say this, I don't mean just injure your targets then immediately go after someone else. But you gotta know when it's worth it to stop a chase, or keep it going
---
there's a difference between offering more points in a category and multiplying your BP. The only things that will multiply your BP would be ANY BP offerings, BBQ &amp; Chili, and We're Gonna Live Forever.
---
Any other perk that is tied to BP, is specifically tied to multiplying said category in game and still caps out at 8k. This includes Distressing, Beast of Prey, Thrill of the Hunt, No One Left Behind, and Prove Thyself. And before you ask, this also applies to the specific killer add-ons that apply "bonus" BP to certain actions for using them.
---
this. don't listen to those saying doctor or legion earn more bp. all you need is a killer you're good/comfortable with and bbq
---
Self Care shouldn't be able to heal yourself - If you as a Survivor want to be healed, just find a nearby teammate.
---
Adrenaline shouldn't be able to jump you to the next health state - If you as a Survivor want to not be dying/injured, just don't get caught in the first place.
---
But they tagged Behavior too...
---
That was a typo...  XP
---
It's a Cannibal perk. 
---
Gain a token for each survivor you hook for the 1st time, each token is a 25% multiplier to total BP gains.
---
When hooking a survivor reveal the auras of survivors outside of 32 meters
---
Would you rather bleed to death instead of allowing the killer to end the match quicker? Interesting.
---
Yeah but if you have good trap coverage you can end the chases so quickly and it’s hard for survivors to know where you trap
---
Faster crouch speed and no red stain in stalking mode even when standing too, those are big ones imo
---
I’ll work on it!
---
Cartoonz is garbage at DbD man, I love his content but he's bad at this game lol 
---
Plus his videos are from when Freddy came out an may be before his first big Nerf.
---
*was loading gun with malicious intent before reading the I love his content part*
---
As a doctor main I try and 3-gen. 
---
Every match, 7 generators spawn on the map. Survivors have to power 5 of them.
---
Therefore, once they complete 4 generators, the 5th one they will need to power will be among 2 other generators. Hence once you have 1 generator left, there will be 3 different generators you must defend.
---
As Killer, and ESPECIALLY Doctor you can exploit this. As soon as the match starts I look around and try to figure out which cluster of 3 generators are the closest together. Once I have found my "ideal 3-gen" I play as normal, but prioritize defending those generators more than others while ignoring generators across the map.
---
Eventually, if they complete all other gens, they end up in a 3-gen scenario.  Doctor is absurdly good at 3-genning because of his stall and you can make survivors keep failing Overcharge skill checks (If you have it. Doctor perk) to rapidly regress generators by having them blow up over and over (Kick generator to overcharge it, survivor touches it and blows it up to regress it, you chase and hit him, go back to kick generator again, etc.) and such.
---
But yes 3-genning is helpful for any killer, although Doc seems to get the most advantage out of it. Having the objectives to defend close together is much better than 3 generators on different sides of the map preventing you from pressuring them.
---
Question: Would you use Monstrous Shrine if it's effect applied to ALL hooks?
---
If you people haven't noticed yet, matchmaking was changed again. Killer doesn't create lobby immediately but stands in queue like survivors do and solos join the lobby together as queue is filled. Just saying, cause as solo I'm tired of getting Dodge.
---
Alright I’m not going to details or explaining of Whether Freddy sucks or not.
---
I will say that Cartoonz isn’t that of a player in dbd.... He’s more a Rs6 or Back in the day For Honor kind of guy. 
---
Now I do like Cartoonz but he’s just not amazing at the game. There’s so many more people amazing at the game and no it’s not Ohm or H20, they are just entertaining not pro gamers at dbd. 
---
Want more of better people to watch I’d say Scottjund, Fungoose but they are on twitch. 
---
Ardetha is on YouTube.
---
The amount of times I have almost shat my pants when he suddenly just stands behind me is countless lol That is one scary dude!
---
Totally agree!!! And mettle of man should only activated afyer you're hooked for the 3rd time!!!
---
But how will Doctor's madness effect them?
---
Are you sure that’s not Leatherface wearing meg?
---
I mean don’t get so triggered people can like and dislike others that’s life. 
---
Also the guys right Cartoonz isn’t good at dbd he’s a lovely guy to watch. 
---
Don’t take the criticism of who you like so to heart it makes you mad. 
---
I hope you have a great day.
---
What about hooked and downed survivors being able to cancel your power? That absolutely needs to go.
---
I think it's a meg wearing another meg. *vomits I'm mouth* oh what have a found ; ;
---
I guess we just need to accept the idea that we wont be happy so we should just be happy.
---
She needs 3 bufss. This is 1.
---
Crouch speed
---
Rule Set No.2 in base kit
---
Addon rework
---
I hate and like this meme. Gj
---
Good to see people thinking with me
---
I love you
---
My opinions on a "casual" mode aside, I don't think that DBD could afford to split up its playerbase like this. People complain about queue times enough now as it is, imagine if there were only half as many people trying to find a game at any given time... if there were more people playing, *maybe* a casual vs ranked thing could be implemented, but it's just not logistically possible right now.
---
addon rewirk on top and it is a deal
---
Happy oinking
---
He means from the specific sides.
---
Like why would a killer want it to be more foggy? And why would survivors want it to be clearer? 
---
He doesn't think they should spawn in the specific side's bloodwebs not that they shouldn't spawn at all.
---
Where’s the goddamn fucking Blackmetal suit! This is a disgrace to the beautiful Blackmetal Jeff showing his inner taste to music and the shitty religions. 
---
On the side note fuck NOED join Satanism and I hope you have a good day OP. 
---
Also you down to headbang like Georgecorpsegridner?
---
SHIT YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO CLEANSE RIGHT AWAY. JUST MAKE A MENTAL NOTE OF WHERE DULL TOTEMS ARE AND IF IT TURNS OUT THE KILLER IS RUNNING NOED AFTER ALL GENS ARE POPPED, MAKE A BEELINE TO CHECK ALL TOTEMS REAL QUICK. CHANCES ARE YOU'LL FIND IT.
---
I FIND IT MILDLY ANNOYING WHEN I'M THE ONE GOING DOWN IN ENDGAME TO IT, BUT IT'S REALLY NOT HARD TO COUNTER. I USE IT ON SOME KILLERS AND PEOPLE ARE WAY TOO SALTY ABOUT IT MOST OF THE TIME.
---
I call it celebration, it’s sexual and violent...
---
I had to put up with mettle as trapper on the myers map yesterday. People got away thanks to it and they talked shit to me in post-game. I am so happy that the requirements for the perk are being changed in a way that will drastically cut down on its activation in games overall.
---
I can really understand why some killers just use noed without caring for the backlash. Survivors have so many second chance perks and items now that can really cost you kills.
---
A casual mode would make the game more accessible to new players. Thus increasing the player base.
---
Current Freddy isn't as bad as most think if you know how to play him right and not just target one player the entire match. He's like Doctor where you want to sleep everyone and go from target to target.
---
He still has major issues though, addons can help but they feel like bandaids. It's too easy to wake up and Freddy is completely helpless during the 7 second (Without addons) sleep transition, although usually survivors try to hold still or go immersive before you sleep them in my experience, and only panic once the actual transition starts. By that time you're right next to them and can usually get a free hit once the transition ends.
---
Shame they’re not buffing his perks
---
Oh god is the sun hot right now.....Yea I am pretty sure it is.

Monto makes dumb jokes and has fun with his videos but he's never childish. He *never* rages or even gets tilted. He's good at the game, he's good with the community, and he's funny. And with how popular he is, him making content designed to show how the game can just be fun without having to dedicate everything to winning is beneficial to the community given how much of a cesspool it has become.
---
You can press esc, then match details to see who played who. Just like when you press esc mid-game. (I dont know how it works for consoles but its probably the same)

Oh my god this is so true in so many levels hahaha.

Nowhere in OP's post have they told anyone to fuck off or been homophobic. You can take your extremely thinly veiled sarcasm and snark elsewhere.
---
I think Bill could cause issues for PC crossplay. I could be wrong but just making assumptions.
---

---
Unexpected cursed image
---
It's kind of funny that you'd tell OP not to facecamp as it would make others salty, while not focusing on the very real problem of higher ranked players being put in games with new people. Which, very obviously, would make those new players quite salty.
---
Wait what event?
---
Maybe it’s me but it’s the dumb jokes, the constant whining and blaming everything that I find very childish. I haven’t watched him in awhile but from the last time I watched him that’s all I can remember.
---
This is kinda how it works. They made her hitboxes smaller and broke her before,so they just reverted it to this . Smaller hitboxes resulted in hatchets going through survivors bodies.
---
Don’t you dare!
---
Me too, man. Me too. Cartoonz is so much fun to watch.
---
MORE SAFE PALLETS PLS I JUST WANT TO BE LOOPED FOR MORE 20 MINUTES
---
I actually wish that killers had the default ability to see downed survivors when within like 6 meters, and Deerstalker simply revealed them on the map. It shouldn't be impossible to find survivors if everyone got downed and you walked away for five seconds. Without a good pair of headphones I don't even understand how you are supposed to do it. Despite that, Deerstalker almost always just feels like a wasted perk slot. It's more of just an anti-frustration perk than one that actually helps you win. I want to like Deestalker, I just wish that there was a reason to run it other than eliminating an annoying mechanic that shouldn't be in the game to begin with.
---
When I spawn in as Pig and see a OOO I cry, I have to either kill her when she has a insta medkit MoM and other stuff, or I don't and my stealth is gone since she sees me.
---
Ghost Face: Spot me and get tunneled. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I disagree on 3 of those, and don't see how it helps on the last.
---
Wraiths shimmer is easier to see wandering through the fog.
---
Piggy maybe harder to spot crouched In the fog but it's also harder for her to notice the immersed blendettes with their spine chills.
---
Ghostface I haven't played yet, but I also dont see how it being foggy would help him with his stalking, much like Myers, it really just helps with not spotting his white ass face from a mile away.
---
So all in all, I disagree but If people think it helps them I can't stop them
---
Healing Speed caps at 100%

This guys a killer main ^
---
While I too love Slasher (although I have only seen the first two seasons) between Legion and Ghostface I feel we have enough of that kind of killer. 
---
That said they also said details soon. I doubt they’d do a season 4 teaser with DBD to release a chapter way before the new season would come out. 
---
Besides Stranger Things and Slasher what other Netflix shows do you think could make sense? House of Cards chapter with President Underwood killer (known as The Knocker) with Zoe survivor?
---
how is number 69 funny by any chhance omfg
---
It's a need to know basis.
---
If you want to sit in a corner and bleed out for several extra minutes, just change your name to "Slug me please".  I'm sure many will be happy to oblige.

Thanks bud
---
WGLF should be merged with Borrowed Time.
---
I dc if friends find the hatch so they can escape.
---
I've been watching him for a while but I'm not sure what you're referring to. I can think of very few instances of him whining or blaming. Considering the fact that he's almost always playing at a deficit because he's running some kind of joke gimmick build, I feel like if he was prone to whining it would be more noticable, because I don't like it when people do that either.
---
So it doesn't have to make physical contact to hit the survivor but instead just hit the general area? 
---
Also it just went through people once? That sounds like she was a pain in the ass to play, especially with the kind of frame issues that can occur. I don't really play her so honestly anything about her mechanics is lost on me.
---
As awesome as this is, let us not forget about Deathgarden. 
---
While I see that as less likely, if you told me a year ago Behavior got the Terminator license and didn’t put it in DBD I would’ve laughed at you.
---
The legend tells that the game is still uninstalled since this day.
---
Maybe I picked the wrong videos to watch but it seems like he was whining and blaming everything. And quite a bit of yelling if I recall correctly. But on that note I don’t think we’ll get to a statement which we both agree on. This argument is pretty pointless, he’s someone I don’t like but you do so that’s good.
---
I hope you enjoy your day man.
---
But you left your 4th haha
---
I can't stand the thought of knowing that any points I put into someone at level 50 will be wasted if I ever want to prestige, so I just get it out of the way asap.
---
Know that feel. GL mate, best to just not chat, I keep re-learning that the hard way.
---
What movie?
---
Fair enough, but tbh it is only scary 5he first few times in a  round then you expect it
---
That’s what cowards get
---
“Creep” it’s different, but basically horror.
---
They literally told me to fuck off, hence I told him he’s being kinda toxic, did you just miss that?
---
Cry me a river
---
Pretty good job finding him.
---
Oh, so that was in your comment thread? Yeah, sorry, I don't keep tabs on your comment threads, those don't come up in my inbox.
---
The common EW3 duration increaser, Blonde Hair, still increases EW3 for 10 seconds despite being a common addon
---
It's so annoying. You try to play by the Survivor book of good manners and as result you get 2 Kills, a Black Pip and you are the Baby Killer.
---
You get into the next game and play Pip oriented and get called sweaty try hard or tunneling camper.
---
I am a killer main myself and I allways go off on survivors doing toxic shit whenever I play survivor.  
---
They don't leave? Wait at the gate to teabag?  
---
Well, they don't expect to see a survivor flaming them for it.
---
Tru3 is alright but there are better options. Zubat being the first to come to mind.
---
Why not just rebind it to a single button and just have 1 button to mash? How would that hurt?
---
Such a under rated movie but a good example lol.
---
For two reasons:
---
1. People focused on one Survivor instead of trying to put multiple people to sleep
---
2. Memes
---
Safe unhooks at least need to be earned and there's only so many to go around, and protection hits are very inconsistent so I still think it will activate less. Either way it's much better than just mindlessly taking hits from the killer.
---
You either cleansed an unlit Dull Totem, which does nothing but give you Bloodpoints, or the killer was running more than one Hex perk and you cleansed that one instead. [Hex Ruin](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_Ruin) creates a Hex Totem but so does [Devour Hope](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_Devour_Hope), [The Third Seal](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_The_Third_Seal), [Haunted Ground](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_Haunted_Ground) (creates two), [Thrill of the Hunt](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_Thrill_of_the_Hunt), and [Huntress Lullaby](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_Huntress_Lullaby). [No One Escapes From Death](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_No_One_Escapes_Death) also creates one, but only after the exit gates are powered, and also needs a dull totem to activate, which is the benefit of cleansing Dull Totems. Luckily for you the only ones of these that really see play are Ruin, Devour Hope, Haunted Ground and NOED. The others range from mediocre to bad.
---
I love how everyone on Reddit just seems like the sweetest guys. Are all the toxic assholes I keep bumping into in game just not on Reddit or sum??

Wait for nerf after enough copies are sold
---
Hey, this is an old post, but I’ve had it saved for a while while I wait for more of these to be made. I’m just wondering, are you still planning on finishing these? I don’t want to force you to do anything or sound like I’m demanding, but I’m just curious.
---
That's from the perspective of spirit not playing against her.
---
Even dumb fengs are cute
---
[Didn’t get a hug from daddy](https://i.imgur.com/48WjMLJ.png)
---
Just double bloodpoints
---
If you use the same seed twice yeah, what I am talking about is encountering the same exact web/cave using the same seed, which again it wouldn't make sense that DbD uses seeds to begin with.
---
Completely agree. I was baffled why they did this with Ghostface, but even if BHVR aren't the quickest with fixing things, they at least always do try to address everything. They're pretty diligent people and they do care.
---
Unlike the developers of a certain other monster-fighting based franchise I could mention.
---
They really want to sell this character😂
---
Prove thyself doesn't increase healing speed anymore
---
Killing all four without using your power likely happens before a single gen pops, in which case you're only getting 9K BP at best.
---
Sounds someone got denied an escape and they came here to whine about it. 
---
BBQ is fine, it doesn’t need any nerfs. Let the Killer kill you so at least they can move on.
---
Why did you leave out the feet?
---
Casual mode existed with the name Quick Game. It was removed for lack of players
---
I love doofy.
---
40*
---
You can easily get 20-30K BP as Survivor, it just requires working on the equivalent of 2 gens, 2 hook rescues and 2-3 heal states on other survivors with a touch of evading the killer in chases.  
---
But most Survivors would rather Gen Rush hard, never getting into a chase or even seeing the killer, which at best means you worked for around 3.5 gens, so you only get around 9-13K BP.  
---
People don't like that Survivors want /more/ for not engaging with the game.
---
/r/whoosh
---
Do you mean cross platform? If that's the case, it just wouldn't be fair to console players. The game runs... not well, to say the least, on console, so anybody on PC would have a huge advantage.
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be.
---
Little known fact. Leatherface can use his chainsaw to kill survivors inside lockers. Giving him the full points of doing so and if you are in a tantrum you can still chainsaw through the locker during that stage. Making it less of a waste. It's not a bug or an exploit. Just a reference to the reboot where Leatherface would often chainsaw through objects
---
But it would help queue times allot, and i as a console player would like to have it
---
Pig is very hard to listen to but it's usually much louder than a survivor but she always gets closer than myers
---
Hmm only thing different is I use BBQ and chilli for points.
---
that's Tier 1 . it goes up to 32m when in Tier 3
---
Thank you, I couldn't remember exactly but I knew it was a good pairing for whispers for those pesky hook rushers.
---
Thanks
---
Freddy has some strong weaknesses that really impact his viability mixed in with his strengths
---
- He is incredibly weak to meta perks. Perks like borrowed time, adrenaline, Meta of Man, self-care hurt him more than other killers due to his dream world restrictions.
---
- Skill checks are very rng. Survivors can spend 40 seconds on a gen and not break-out or they can spend a couple of seconds on a gen and break out. What makes it worse is that people who use self-care get skill checks really easy meaning they can use it as a very easy way to break out the dream state.
---
- The 7 second transition prevents Freddy from protecting objectives. This includes hooked survivors, totems and gens. Gens can be done right in front of Freddys face and he cannot do anything about it. 
---
- He is susceptible to pallets due to his power not helping him with chasing survivors. 
---
- His dream world limits his vision making tracking more difficult for him
---
He does have his strengths and is great for slugging and can be great for map awareness if you have more than one survivor awake.
---
Well... to each their own, but the general consensus is that it wouldn't be a good idea. The level of play from PC to console is just so different. *Maybe* once console is better optimised, but... that is a slow, slow journey. With how DBD is right now, it would just kinda be an automatic win for PC winners every time, just because console performance is so poor.
---
What you want ≠ what would be healthy for the game, as much as it sucks. Trust me, I'd love it for the queue times, too, but right now the payoff wouldn't be worth it.
---
you can read my comment just under this one i explained how spirit can be more rewarding for a survivor to juke and how easier it is to do so
---
terrible by itself but strong with Lithe and Q&amp;Q, which i'm pretty sure that's the reason why they were so excited to get the perk
---
One of the first killers you should go for is The Spirit. She is a very strong killer, and one of her teachable perks, Spirit Fury, is also a great perk for majority of the killers. It helps deal with pallets. 
---
After destroying 4/3/2 pallets, the next pallet you are hit by will automatically be destroyed. Very good perk, and combine it with Enduring which is the strongest perk combo a killer can get
---
It kinda seems like Chucky.
---
I get your point but you have shitty pc's and good pc's too tho
---
What about OoO? this perk makes his ability non-existing and recently there's almos always a person with OoO in red ranks.
---
most killers and bhvr will just act like this isn't a thing sadly.
---
Moris had been nerfed years ago
---
There was a time where you could kill every survivor after the first down. Also ebony mori isnt that bad. As a survivor i get to struggle stage on my first hook very often or die on my second hook getting moried theb doesnt make much differenc. When i use ebony mori i only use them when i already hokked the survivor 2 times. Noone can complain about that. But this kind of offering would be to op. The chance for the possible offering would be 4 times higher and the effect can be abused so hard. 4 swf going in with brand new parts and all gens are done in 60 sec. Sometimes it happens to me as a killer that 3 gens are randomly done in the first 2 mins. Bad luck.
---
What the hell were they doing?
---
"I love my team" :)
---
most of the killers in this game need a fuckin rework lmao
---
These are amazing, especially MGS style detection indicator. This will allow you to lean out and start stalking,  when indicator appears, cancel lean. Rinse and repeat until close to full then run out and do last bit of stalk = easy down.
---
Now get some Scratched Mirror add-ons and Monitor &amp; Abuse perk, and go jumpscare some people. This works great on the lower ranks. &gt;:)
---
holding m2/pretending to hold m2 isn't fucking mindgaming, it's just forcing the survivor to completely guess to win lmao. why do spirit mains refer to it as mindgaming as if they're skilled or something?
---
Bbq and chilli gives more bloodpoints and is a good perk without the bloodpoints.
---
PainReliever and Ardetha for me.
---
What is an oinker
---
Like a fucking Ahegao face xd
---
It just wasn't meant to be. You don't need NOED  any way
---
Actually a good idea to giv some attention to lowtier perks but would destroy almost every perkbuild
---
But all totems are cleansed
---
The way Fortnite handles platform exclusive skins (or at least how they used to) is that to everyone on other platforms, it just looks like you're playing as one of the default characters. In dbd they could make Bill players just look like a randomly chosen base game survivor
---
New killer leak?
---
*Cries in console player*
---
That's actually not bad
---
They're looking so cool! You did a pretty good job so far.
---
Legion is rather cool to play against now imo.
---
Sameeeeee HybLove
---
Wow, she didn't DC :D  
---
But I had exactly the same situation as a Hag like two days ago :D
---
Use distortion. Hide in lockers during the match to preserve hiding your aura
---
I wouldn't because I actually want them to get unhooked so I can hook em more times
---
Because graphic designers also create perks.
---
I take this as a personal attack. Care to explain why you attack my people?
---
I would love to see pinhead and carrie but idk how she would work. Also jason is unlikely due to him having his own game.
---
Let me hide in this locker when I'm downed.
---
Lmao.
---
Huh. Never thought of this. Mathieu Cote kinda does look like Dwighty boi. So sad to see him return in FTWD and not the normal TWD
---
Even as someone who plays killer 95% of the time I think this would be a good addition
---
Id say the biggest difference as a survivor is you don't run into NEARLY as many nurses, and less huntresses. (At least good ones, hatchets are tougher to hit with a controller). As killer you gotta get used to the lower fps. Overall not a lot of differences, seems like players are a little more campy on console maybe
---
You aren't nice
---
Probably a bit broken, but I always thought one of her red addons should be to reduce the timer for every gen that pops while wearing a trap.
---
Alright so MoM is quite a heavily loved perk but I don’t have Ashe.
---
So for me I go Bt, Dh, Aftercare and Adrenaline. 
---
Dh and Adrenaline to keep me going. Aftercare to hopefully have teammates help with gens or get a read on where killer is (solo). Bt to save others hopefully.
---
The main reason why I run Adrenaline is because that’s 1 of 2 times I’ll usually accept a heal. The first time is usually when I’m on third hook or adrenaline heals me. I will admit sometime the time saved doesn’t matter because your team will just tbag waiting to heal but that doesn’t happen often.
---
There is no best perk build i guess but here are a few cool perk builds you might wanna try:
---
1 a chase build for multiple options in a chase:
---
Lithe, dead hard, balance landing, adrenaline
---
2 a solo survivor build: selfcare, deliverance, unbreakable,  alert
---
3 a medic build: selfcare, we will make it, emphaty, botany knowledge.
---
4 a sneak build to stay lowkey: urban evasion, iron will, diversion, quick and quiet
---
5. A team build only to buff your team : bond, leader, vigil, streetswise
---
6 My personal favorite just for a fun game is wat i call the Trigger build only with two perks: no Mither and object of obsession. Yea its maybe the worst perk build possible but so much fun to play lol
---
How would ones wrist hurt from pushing a button?
---
You think that would be a fairly popular perk?
---
I just see it as Shirtless Myers 2.0. Doesn't really hurt anybody and isn't ever really super intrusive outside of people memeing about it in posts that are usually related to her.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
---
- [/r/oinkers_] [We can not allow this! This a personal attack!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Oinkers_/comments/c03jge/we_can_not_allow_this_this_a_personal_attack/)

---
Yeah. I don’t think it’d be in everyone’s build, but would be used. Probably similar to the new DS or Deliverance or something. How many times are you the last Survivor alive and are unable to escape because you can’t open the gates fast enough?
---
Sounds like someone doesnt know jack.
---
My favourite build I run almost every solo game is:
---
× borrowed time, it helps a lot against camping/tunneling killers
---
× self care, just to heal myself up as much as I want and so I can take hits for others 
---
× balanced landing, it speaks for itself
---
× lightweight, cause it makes my tracks harder to follow
---
If I'm playing SWF with friends I usually run:
---
× adrenaline, it's just strong 
---
× borrowed time, the same reason as above 
---
× head on, it's a fun perk tbh 
---
× detective's hunch, so I can find all the totems cause I lot of killers like to run noed and and I don't want it to activate
---
Project harder
---
See?, nobody cares.
---
mori me daddy
---
Amanda is super cute. I’m mostly talking about from the film but yes Dbd as well
---
You can do it on mobile also
---
Quick quote that might interest you from Benedict Baker's Journal: "Maybe it is the will to survive that makes me even more alert to sounds. Sight is limited in this darkened part of the world. In this case their heartbeats. Not my own, but instead the killers’ as they close in on me. I just hope that they do not pick up on mine as my heart races for every thump I can hear even clearer."
---
I always predict bbq on nurses so i just get close or in a locker / bbq = denied
---
Alright, then Adrenaline should ONLY heal
---
Bruh... I have 15 skeleton keys on Nea just from using plunderer's and those are the ones I didn't use
---
The chance of finding keys while using plunderer's is ridiculously high
---
Also, deliverance has the condition to not be hooked first AND do a rescue
---
As Bing Bong boi main I can confirm, you can get looped forever. I still love my boy!
---
Yeah, we didn’t have any gens. The others wasted time saving me😥. The game went smoothly after I got away though.  
---
When I play Kate, it may be my imagination but I get targeted more. I lobby change with Feng Mins dressed like mine because I feel weird hurting them.
---
i don't really like watching killer play tho. I prefer the tension of the survivor view while being chased.
---
Isnt he like 5'3 or something?
---
OP almost vanishes.
---
easy to counter, but no one tries to... hmmm that souNds sO vEry Distinct
---
When it comes to DBD content creators, I generally can't watch another video of theirs after watching one for the day. Some are too loud or obnoxious, have editing that is way too over the top, nitpick or complain during the entire video, ect.
---
But Farmer John is different, at least for me. His editing is nice and to the point. Cutting out some of the more unimportant parts of the video so that the more interesting bits can be shown more prominently, no random sound effects taken from memes whenever something funny in the game happens, quick transitions, ect.
---
He does yell and be loud sometimes, but that isn't ALL the time. He doesn't take the game overly seriously and has commentary that isn't just complaining about what's going on in the game and more so cracking fun at the events going on.
---
Also helps that he does a decent amount of killer videos, which is a nice change of pace from most of the Survivor based content. The motion tracked animations at the end (and occasionally in the beginning and middle) of the video is neat.
---
In the end, he's just a very nice dude to watch and I recommend him for those who want a change of pace from some of the other content creators.
---
Congrats on the 30k dude, you earned it.
---
[Also here's a blank version if you wanna make your own meme with this.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/559180092207792130/588657840646782976/adamboardblank.png)
---
That makes it a whole lot clearer appreciate it.
---
That would just break the core character of him. After all, he's mainly just a tiny doll that murders people.
---
SO THATS WHY I PLAY HER
---
That could be true. When I do killer dailies, I don’t kill anyone unless it’s a “complete 2 sacrifices” one.
---
'cause he's actually for new players. Since they don't know how to loop. The fact that some hardcore players from high rank can't bully him does not change anything for inexperienced survivors.
---
if he's new he's not going to get M&amp;A that easily.
---
I may try Plague - there’s some error with my account that resets my rank every 1-2 weeks, so I’m always at low levels!
---
She’s still cute as hell. Also she was an ex Drugadict because Jigsaw changed her and Mark Hoffman (asshole) killed her. 
---
It’s just a joy seeing you linking around here.
---
A SURVIVOR ONCE BROUGHT OBJECT OF OBSESSION TO A GAME...
---
...BUT NOT UNBREAKABLE. 
---
I DON'T PERSONALLY UNDERSTAND THE MENTALITY OF THIS. IF THE KILLER DOESN'T HAVE IT ALREADY EQUIPPED YOU ARE GIVING THE KILLER DEER STALKER ON A FUCKING SILVER PLATTER, CUTLERY, CANDLES, AND A NICE BOTTLE OF RED FUCKING WINE TO GO ALONG WITH HIS MEAL!
---
AND THEN,  SAID SURVIVOR PROCEEDED TO SLANDER ME VERBALLY IN THE END CHAT.
---
*YOU* GAVE ME AN ADVANTAGE! 
---
DID YOU *HONESTLY* EXPECT ME *NOT* TO USE SAID ADVANTAGE?!
---
You may be forgiven, however the murder of a baby dwight is unforgivable.
---
oh and you know that i paid to play a meth addict and go around killing people ? it's a game lol
---
It’s been reworked in the PTB and is harder, if not nearly impossible, to get stacks for it now.
---
That's not how shit works.
---
Maybe he just thought my Feng was dressed cute then (that happened with another killer).  
---
I played well against a cannibal, and at some point I think he decided to let me finish the last gen. The game had been going on forever and I hadn’t been hooked. He looked at me while I opening the exit door and I was worried he was trying to build up hope and then chainsaw me, but he let me leave. I wish there was a thank you motion in the game.
---
Ok well I’m not saying my version has to be the one put into the game. Maybe if an actual version were implemented, conditions would be required. Idk.
---
I got Myers to P3 because he has no clothes in the cosmetic shop. I'm not going to prestige doctor beyond P1 because I spent £7,50 on his clothes and I'll be damned if I'm such an idiot that I wouldn't use the value every single game I play him.
---
Killers are too strong in chases???? Okay then I read enough today.
---
Nurse's is what I'm using on legion and most of the time I get cocky SWF so it feels really good to just speed up to them out of nowhere and down them, the only downside on spirit is that you can't see auras when in phase.
---
I main claudette so I get best of both worlds. Still sucks when they vanish from thin air though.
---
Also, as spirit, I've concluded that BBQ, nurse's, Ruin and Surveillance is the best bet.
---
F
---
Based on the text you wrote, I think you would like ZubatLEL too.
---
&gt; When you achieve a Good Skill Check while repairing and affected by Ruin, your repair progress should be reduced by 3%, 4%, or 5% and you should be able to automatically continue repairing and be granted your Good Skill Check Bloodpoints. 
---
Yes, it use to be like this and it was useless
---
\*Happy oinks\*
---
propably new perks that allow the killers to move faster around the map while outside of a chase or something like that would fix some probs ...just straight up buffing everyone would fuck up the low ranks i guess
---
I can't wait to laugh at them when they'll be trying to release dbd for mobile
---
We use the same fun healing build.
---
I'll keep that in mind! I'll hope to have Corrupt Intervention pop in tbe web too so that I can set up traps around the basement
---
The madmen actually did it.
---
Indeed I do.
---
You didn’t answer my question. Why would you a survivor need to know what perks the killer is using? And ever heard of a locker?
---
No it wouldnt lol
---
He would still be a doll that kills people. chucky has always been on the bigger side of dolls (like 2 feet tall, another foot wouldnt make him not chucky) and hes always had voodoo magic.
---
That's wiggle not struggle
---
The obky tipp i got for you. Take it ez when your mates dc see it as a Challenge and dont get mad because they leave :D. Dont focus on rank to much it really doesnt matter. As a usually rank 1 survivor and rank 1 killer i can tell you i rather stay in the midranks. On rank 1 people tryhard the shit out of their life genrush all time. Toxic Feedback from killers and survivors and noone can chill. I dont need bp no more so i cant tell how to deal with that. If you want more bp you should play killer anyways. A good match with hillbilly and bbq should bring you 50 k bp per match.
---
&gt; Corrupt Intervention
---
Yeah that and Hex: Ruin are basically a must for Hag/Trapper because they initially waste a lot of time on setting their traps. Perkless Trapper usually starts the action at 2 gens fixed
---
That's more popular than you think
---
How fast do you need to push it?
---
Steady rhythm? Like what
---
STOP QUITTING OUT WHEN YOU ARE THE FIRST ONE HIT, YOU LITTLE S***S
---
Farmer John is awesome and hilarious.
---
Lol I hoped it'd be the Trapper. I always imagine him sitting at a table in the corner of a cabin with an empty bottle and a gun
---
They still said they would not like it... we already have Jake &amp; Feng, who both have the same personality(MUST. SABO. HOOK.), why not 2 Dwights?
---
Yes, Love it!
---
and as usual in this subreddit full of killermains before you can even get an answer to the topic there is a salty killer main that cant stand other peoples opinions - yes killers are to strong in chases because of the bloodlust mechanic but whatever thats not the point of this thread... answer me to the topic or keep your mouth shut - there is enought salt in this subreddit already so i dont yours thank you
---
Forcing variety does not work, it just makes the game less fun. 
---
Also you mentioned SC, but the perk is absolutely worthless anyways, just thought that was funny.
---
This is risky however, at any given moment another survivor could spot you and ruin your strat. He's interesting
---
Are you saying you WOULDN'T want Mathieu? That is a very unwise desiOINKn, pasta-bake
---
I’m not a main of anything I play both sides a little bit more Survivor lately. 
---
I refuse to give an answer I rather laugh at stupidity in its face then give a answer to someone whose most likely stubborn and has his own opinion he won’t change.
---
Ussylis has a few survivor tutorials which are really helpful for new players.
---
Just wait 5 days untill Mettle of Man is nerfed into the ground. Untill then, play meta killers like Nurse, Billy and Spirit, because MoM isn't a big issue for them.
---
Mmmh, sweet, sweet blood points.
---
Must have been devour hope, i did get the lit totem
---
And if they can't against SWF, either SWF needs to be nerfed or those killers buffed.
---
yeah i was saying that , it just feels like she won't get changes for a long time
---
I guess you mis read my reply or you don't know how distortion works
---
Word!
---
Y3p. If you heal yourself behind boxes for example, where you are technically hidden,she can headshot you . Your hitbox is bigger than you can see.
---
Also yes she was changed and reverted,because noone could hit a hat hed anymore. Not even scottjund was able to pull  it off,because the hitboxes bugged.
---
I swear I dressed like this for 3 different Halloween’s as a kid
---
&gt; I didn’t diss the game
---
I think you need to re read your post title then.
---
Sidney... my knife in the dark...
---
SWf is here 'cause some players can't play a game without having their dick hold my their friends, They allow this to increase the playerbase. We know it's here, we know it's bullshit but that's it. 
---
I'm all for swf being nerf, but buffing killers to the Nurse level is absolutely not an option.
---
Abusing what? Contrary to what you survivor mains think killers don't get a magic "win" button that we can press whenever we want. This is either A. Op with shit internet and latency or B. A Lag switching killer.
---
Neither of them are part of the game nor are they "killer sided"
---
If there's a Ubisoft chapter the killer better be Caveria
---
Okay so I'm buying all perks on Jeff and I'm on the last page of perks, but the bloodwebs still haven't given me fuckin wglf. THAT WOULD MAKE MY LIFE SO MUCH EASIER but it keeps giving me good perks, like thanks but not right now lmao.
---
because they're ignorant and bad.
---
Wow!
---
no no no no no. I am in no way suggesting killers need to be buffed to nurse level. Most being a little but worse than billy would be fine.
---
lightborn without flashlights 💀
---
ikr?? I've already ruined the LS on one of my controllers :(
---
You know I forgot about this perk that I may have actually been hiked by this perk before. Hah.
---
Are the changes live?  
---
I won't believe it until I see it.
---
It’s the overuse. Just like Shirtless Myers, it was funny initially, but it’s just getting tiresome. Like, a change in memes would be good.
---
Desync for ya hopefully with dedicated server fix alot of stuff like this
---
Me and the rest of the amanda gang are coming
---
We have no terror radius so you will never know
---
And in basis: ur fuckt
---
Billy is your answer, i’m a pretty casual player and still get rank 1. 
---
I rock ruin/bbq/sloppy/nurses.
---
Run, my glorious leader! This is an area not safe, and i fear for you...
---
I love it all- except I think Ghostface would benefit from immunity from Detection Perks when in stealth mode. Right now, he should act like Tier 1 Michael, where stuff like Spine Chill doesn’t work. That’s the only thing I’d add, they’ve done a really good job.
---
I absolutely despise playing survivor.
---
Love watching it tho! :D
---
Total opposite with killer, if I'm not the one playing then I get bored pretty fast.
---
I have been saying this a dozen of times and got downvoted like hell every single time. Its like some extremely childish shit. The "Jane thicc ass" shit is really cringy aswell.
---
Try to play The Plague at high ranks and make everyone sick. You will have pretty much noed, because of their broken status, but you will still need to catch em.
---
Someone missed the livestream.
---
Try slowing down a few times in some matches and you'll see you really don't have to demolish the button to stay alive
---
Does WGLF actually do anything else besides give extra bloodpoints? I always thought it was weird that BBQ has a really neat ability stacked onto the bp gain but wglf doesn't do much else
---
Could be wrong, been a while since I've read the perk.
---
You are pretty much handed keys if you aren’t spending your BP right away each match.
---
I would rather have development time go towards something more pressing than a perk to add to a already ingame item.
---
you'll learn where things spawn anyway without those perks.
---
Okay Adam, come on, you gotta dab. Thereeeee ya go.
---
Uh oh.
---
\*Pizza time starts playing\*
---
!corn
---
The corn has been shucked 987182 times
---
Why tho, it works on every other stealth killer.
---
It's a perk that trades your own location info for information.
---
Yeah I feel you, honestly when you’ve got some free time go on youtube and look up “insta saw billy”
---
Monto/truetalent have some nice videos showing how to efficiently use him, you’ll learn how to mind game the loops too.
---
CAN I STOP GETTING FOUND FIRST PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. I EVEN WAIT FOR A FEW SECONDS BUT STILL SPAWN RIGHT NEXT TO TERROR RADIUS AND THE KILLER MAGICALLY HEADS MY WAY EVERYTIME I CRI.
---
I think you did a pretty good job with the photo XD
---
Both are self proclaimed masters of creating content but if you look a little but closer they only did a pretty good job so far. 👀
---
TO BE HONEST IT’S STILL NOT AS STRONG AS THE OLD DS.
---
This at least has some nice bloody patterns. Things like Hag and some of the survivors look like they just swam in tomato sauce.
---
Haha glad I helped ur day to be better ; )
---
Did he do a pretty good job?
---
The killer has a Terror Radius, not a heartbeat, so I'd imagine it's yours that starts to intensify as you get more terrified the closer he gets.
---
SPEEEEEED
---
I mean, if it was an effect for all cosmetics it would be worth it. But its just another skin.
---
Me: sees picture
---
Also me: this should be on r/deadbydalight
---
Therefore me: posts on r/deadbydalight
---
*yoinks*
---
OP did you pip? what BP you get?
---
I genuinely think that if I was Bubba here I'd purposefully not end the game by letting 1 or 2 wiggle off. It's stupid but ending the game as you did, even though you SHOULD, sends me back to the lobby with nothing to wait another 10-30 mins for a game.
---
But my achievement
---
Well luckily for you and this meme, I AM gay
---
It’s still on the PTB.
---
Wait, wut?
---
why xd
---
Feel sorry for your sad ass
---
Pretty good job so far
---
it does. you get a random seed number whenever you start a new world. I landed on the same seed twice
---
For sure
---
Double Bloodpoint weekend!
---
From June 14th, 2019 to June 18th, 2019
---
😎👍
---
😱🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
---
i’d really like to know what the post game chat consisted of
---
Exactly right it can be many reasons it also sounds like you are very respectful to the killer wont be toxic and teabag and shit and that could also be a reason killers like it when people are shit heads haha
---
Aight thanks! I forget that killers height are actually in this game sometimes haha
---
There was actually a statistic that came out a little while ago that says 69.9% of your statistic is wrong.
---
Here’s your criticism:
---
“I stopped playing a while back because it seems the devs don’t care.”
---
[How they feel after they loop the whole game, quadruple MOM and adrenaline, teabag, and then get to the post game chat to find a rank 20 killer with no perks.](https://imgur.com/IreQM2z)
---
Fuck off with your support of serial killers. Just because they had a hard background doesnt mean they should kill people . you're a fucking sociopath
---
Strong 2012 energy
---
Slugging (as long as you can keep em down), moris and tunneling/camping are the only counters for this perk on M1 killers :) This perk is so much fun!
---
I used to hate the rework idea for Mettle as a solo survivor but now I’ve been slowly starting to actively try and take more hits for people and it’s not as hard as I originally thought. It’s a good rework imo
---
&gt; Jake &amp; Feng, who both have the same personality(MUST. SABO. HOOK.)
---
Since when was Feng "must sabo hook"??? They have always stated she is a lone wolf and someone who just wants to win nothing about her sabotaging abilities.
---
They want the character name (Nea, Jake, etc.)
---
Happy pride month!
---
I love him, he’s a great guy and if you like popular DBD players like Monto, No0b3 and Puppers you’ll like him.
---
Kek
---
I don't swallow, but I can make an effort
---
Yea, I do that. When they taunt and T-bag me at the gate, I just turn around and go away to find some pallets to break, if there are any.
---
What killer spends all game crouched or invisible? Literally nobody because you can't win if you are always stealthed.
---
Also, Michael has Mirrors to stay in tier 1 so there's that.
---
Well killers cant take addons from the game like survivors with chests.
---
Chucky is in the game after all
---
But are the new changes on PTB?  
---
Cause I haven't seen anyone try him
---
Pig mains/fans
---
That gun though
---
just for that, good sir. ill unleash something you will never predict
---
THE SPANISH OINKUSITION
---
I want this.
---
Nurse if fun to play against duh. Especially the bad nurse
---
Yep, that's there
---
Is not that the devs don't fix things. It's that this entire community harps on the tiniest mistakes and is never grateful for anything. In all honesty if I was one of the devs I would've said fuck this fan base a while ago
---
Yeah I watch monto and noob3 alot. I learned quite a bit from their videos. Thanks for the advice!
---
IIRC someone won an auction to have their characteristics be put into the game, and they became Dwight. It was on a dev stream WAY back.
---
This would just limit how many different possible builds there are.
---
Play billy. You will never lose with him 😂
---
Chucky is leaked guys... the devs did another oopsie
---
The Man himself!
---
Not overpowered, but not underpowered. Perfectly balanced... you done good.
---
Like 3 taps per second, not very fast at all. You could rest your finger against the struggle button amd just kinda shake the controller gently so the button hits your finger and be good, that's what I do.
---
It's funny how people are all too eager to shit on BHVR and act like they don't do anything, then they give themself a pat on the back and act like BHVR was never going to buff/change some perks without their own "amazing" feedback.
---
A bunch of people? She barely killed that many. She killed at least like 8 out of like 70 something people in the entire franchise.
---
Read the linked post on the front page.
---
No it doesn't. Healing speed gained from the We'll Make It perk caps at 100%. Botany, Leader, We'll Make It and med kits all stack their speed values.
---
Everything stacks and there is no maximum healing speed
---
Kate's updated p3 looked like spaghetti sauce on the ptb, I get what you mean.
---
It's just unsporstsmanlike. It's like giving the middle finger to your opponent
---
Uhuh, available for testing today.  
---
So, no one has actually felt the changes yet.  
---
So yeah, I won't believe he's actually good until I see it.
---
Nope.
---
Behaviour are helping make the Strange Things mobile game nothing to do with DBD.

I don't think he's gonna be great anyway...

Sorry for the poor quality, it was like 1am!
---
I have to say for all The Spirit is marked as 'hard' and with me being a fairly new player (I only started yesterday morning) she was probably the one I got to understand the quickest and obviously did best with. I didn't get Adept sadly but I was consistently managing to chase and hook people with her power and it got me the 5k in all categories achievement.
---
Having a load of fun so far overall as both Survivor and Killer.
---
it’s just a pet peeve. Halloween has been my favorite film since childhood (and Michael has been my favorite character) and since the Halloween chapter was released in dbd there’s just been a flood of people making art of them looking like bimbos and I’m not sure why.
---
Because people enjoy the game lol
---
Seems super fun.
---
Noed on spirit is stupid already anyway
---
Does Presteige really offer rarer items more commonly?
---
That's a very apt explanation. Nothing else to add here.
---
Celebrating is different than shouting "loser" at the other team
---
I swear ever since I started rewatching Breaking Bad I've seen more and more BB memes pop up on reddit
---
I see where you're coming from but there's some differences. 
---
Remember that Michael has a reduced movement speed and lunge in tier 1 so he needs to be immune or he would never reach tier 2, whereas ghost face always moves at normal speed (the same as tier 2 Michael).
---
During the PTB everyone knows they're against ghost face, so everyone will run perks to specifically counter him. During the live game it's up to you what perks you bring. Are you always going to run calm spirit in case of a doctor? Perk builds can't be tailored to a particular killer so it's all about general viability.
---
Spine chill is useful against all killers imo, but even more useful against stealth killers. Ghost face needs to be detected or he will have an advantage to other killer has.
---
Probably because they haven’t seen the movies at all and just know the characters thanks to DBD so they haven’t seen Michael underneath the mask lol
---
I mean I think it makes sense. DBD has almost no sci-fi elements to it, while Deathgarden does. The best they could do is have a terminator with a human appearance that has some damage to reveal what's underneath, and even that would still look out of place.
---
If you know then killer is camping then just do gens and leave. Leatherface can camp way more effectively than Ghostface but it's not like it's OP.
---
Learn to play without Ruin. You'll be a better player as a result.
---
True, true- but the fact that Ghostface loses his power altogether when he’s seen gives the impression that he kinda needs the tools to sneak up undetected. Maybe it’s because I always run Spine Chill I forget that most people generally don’t, so it’s not a huge deal.
---
From my experience spin also seems to do faster progress, started spinning a few weeks ago and I've actually struggled out the killers grasp a few times
---
I can see why that would be good. I don’t have ruin teachable yet, but any tips on how to prevent gen rush without Ruin?
---
Guess you didnt read my post
---
Glenock gonna be like „i DOnT aGrEe wiTh THiS pIG UpVOte“
---
Idgaf
---
Okay my bad lol, I didn't know :k
---
I mean sure I guess but also Laurie isn’t even bleach blonde in game she’s what we call dirty dishwater blonde so you can see where the confusion begins
---
Now I realize I still feel extremely shaken about this moment
---
Me neither :(
---
Learn to find survivors and end chases as fast as possible. Don't protect hooks if you don't see a survivor nearby.
---
Basically, to stop them doing gens, you need to have one of them hooked and chase other one pretty much all the time. This way it's like 75% slow down (1 on hook, 1 in chase, 1 going for a save = maximum 1 on a gen)
---
*laughs in spine chill
---
Very good changes.

How I’m feeling trying to stream snipe my friend right now
---
I was going to congratulate you as I am too a killer main who has to put up with enormous amounts of bullshit 
---
But then I saw the 3rd perk you had on....
---
I don't understand why some survivors are so toxic towards killers, like hey bitch you don't have a game without us sooo...
---
Which still causes issue with Bill since the perks are teachable's on PC but are just general perks on console.
---
i used to believe both Territorial and Beast of Prey were the same animal  
---
but one is a wolf and one is a bear
---
You've neglected Play With Your Food, my friend
---
Yeah I don’t like to camp hooks until Endgame, but I guess most of this comes with time and experience. I appreciate the advice!
---
I’m a killer main and I honestly don’t understand why people hate it. It’s an extra hit = more points for me
---
I CAN'T HEAR YOUU. ALSO GETTING HIT BY NOED WHEN IT'S A BILLY WITH INSTACHAINSAW NO THANK YOU, THAT'S NOT A LATE GAME BUILD, THAT'S BEING SUPER INSECURE AND ANNOYING.
---
Give me that beast of prey, Max out hunting every game with no problem thanks to it.
---
It's pretty obvious that it's a lagswitch whenever this happens because you can see that connection is fine throughout, even when he vaulted the window, everything was smooth, no stuttering, no screwed up hitbox situation. Minor lags also only cause stutters where you teleport backwards over and over. For this to happen, according to devs, is if the survivor is completely disconnected from killer after the vault up to the point he/she gets hit, and this is one of the best spots to do it because after the vault, if survivor is not connected to killer, the survivor will keep running into the wall and killer can hit the survivor while they're still there. I've never said it's killer sided. All I've said is that lots of killers get this map and do this now and it's disgusting. Whether it's a magic win button or not, whatever it is, it's still bs.
---
Imagine Tinkerer on rework Freddy...
---
We have 2 second chance perks 2 don’t say we have so many also MOM is getting buffed so don’t be too happy last killers have more BS perks than survivors so don’t complain about those
---
Tunnel off the hook. Then Mori.

It usually starts at 8 p.m. EST where I am, so about 12 hours from now.
---
It’s about time that we have another killer that’s actually viable in the highest ranks. Once you hit red ranks, it’s mostly Nurse / Billy / Spirit / Huntress because they’re all strong killers by their own right with powerful killer powers, without the reliance on good add ons.
---
Here’s my theory. BHVR is scared to release powerful killers due to massive survivor backlash, so what they end up doing is nerfing the killers by making them add-on reliant. Upon doing so, you now have weak killers that are only “viable” when using their best add ons, usually. 
---
Plague being a perfect example of this. PTB Plague was arguably a top tier killer that was then nerfed to the point she can be looped into oblivion if she tries to hold her power in. This CAN be counteracted as they made movement speed with vile purge add ons, however, at that point why would anyone waste the add on slots? 
---
Instead you see plagues that instant-break survivors or have extremely long corrupt purges due to her “best” addons. Plague without these top tier add ons can usually be outplayed fairly easily.
---
It sounds like you're taking your hand off your controller so you can press way too hard and way too fast. You shouldn't be using your wrist to spam the button if you're spamming a button in a reasonable manner. You only need to tap it like 3 times per second (on PC keyboard controls at least) and you don't need to mash the button down. This isn't anything like the interrogation scenes in the MGS series where you genuinely do need to mash as fast as you can by holding the controller against your body and using your entire hand to press 1 button
---
It wasn't supposed to be good 😐
---
Plus the fact that nobody fucking plays Jake and when they do they are always sabotaging the hooks
---
thats exactly what i thought :D
---
Or in the Remake
---
Try moon walking when getting looped at walls. If u walk backwards around a wall when being looped at a pallet they can't see your red stain so u quickly turn around and ambush them. It doesn't work 100% but it can usually guarantee a hit.
---
Try using perks like sloppy Butcher or (if u have it) Thanataphobia. I recommend leveling all killers to 40 to get their perks before leveling your main killer so u can have all the perks on them. 
---
Trapper I recommend putting traps at pallets, windows, big grass and hide them near gens. I don't use him often but I see others do it that way.
---
Wraith it's a little hard to say cause I don't use him much either so someone correct me if I'm wrong but I usually try to get as close as possible before uncloaking so I don't have to run as far to hit them.
---
Tbh idk bout Billy, I hate using him. Same with nurse and hag, but with hag I'd assume it's the same as Trapper, just set them in spots that u know survivors will not expect them like haddonfield alleys and near gens, etc 
---
Doctor I recommend perks that have to do with skill checks and addons to do with terror radius rather than the actual shock. This is just my way tho. I like to use Overcharge, Distressing, Huntress Lullaby and Unnerving. It's like an impossible skill check loadout. Then with the extra big terror radius from Distressing, ur Shock Field will be even more effective and won't have to use Shock Therapy as much.
---
Huntress it's hard to say for me considering she's slower and it can be difficult for ppl to hit hatchet throws. But I can guess someone better will tell u about her.
---
Legion I like to use distressing so I have better distance on the blimp notifications, it's hard for them to hide if u can cover half the map lol. Also so u don't have to chase the last target as much u can use frenzy to chase your last target and get as close as possible before it runs out.
---
Can't say on Freddy sadly
---
Pig I just have one hint, don't try to mind game with the ambush dash. They can hear it activate and counter it. Instead use your crouch and sneak to where they are before uncrouching regularly. I've been playing her for just a week now and I haven't gotten less than a 3k. The tip I just told u comes in big help in Lery's and The Game maps since there's a lot of walls, I played one yesterday in Lery's ended up pulling 3 ppl off gens lol.
---
That's all I can think of right now. I'll make another comment if I think of anything else.
---
I Guess that hit you xd. Hope they fix this bullshit with dedicated servers
---
I don’t get this Nea is the Killer meme, can someone explain?
---
You would like pain reliever
---
It's because she is really ugly so when she came out people joked that she could be mistaken for the killer
---
More like poopy shapey hehehehshe
---
No jane you uncultured swine
---
A killer is a noob when he or she plays with perks and/or addons :v
---
They said that was an unintended bug and should be removed.
---
Thank you
---
Yes! Lithe is one of my main perks I use on all builds and Q&amp;Q is just fun to use for experiments or laughs. I was hunting for Dance With Me to use it for the build with both perks you mentioned.
---
/u/PrimevalRust I mean you are right. It's not logical to waste so much time to get one perk, but I wasn't stressing it out neither. I was checking almost every shrine each week which took me like 10 seconds with a phone or on PC. Missed it once and got it at second time :D It's pretty exciting no matter if it took long time or short :)
---
You are gay.
---
Legion and Pig main here. Legion is cool and fun to play by now! Just try him a lil bit! Yet you can gain pressure out of frenzy stabs, but his power is not OP anymore! Good luck friends 😉
---
Lmao cursed picture
---
"Oh I will juke the survivor and get them in the next fence openning" *there is no openning*
---
anime michael
---
I play A LOT of Huntress and it mostly comes down to ping, I've gone against friends and we'll compare clips of the hits and on my screen its perfect or its a bit off, on theirs its a mile. It really isnt hitboxes, but it is annoying to see as a survivor.
---
Mom says it’s my turn to play the killer
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but thats not the bloodweb icon, thats the raven wreath icon
---
It’s absolutely amazing for him as well, since he’s basically an m1 killer a fair amount of the time, he can make up for time lost in the chase by mopping up with an exposed stays effect later
---
You can also step away from the keyboard, find a pen, find some paper, and write all that shit down. The question for both scenarios is; why the fuck should you have to?
---
I think you did a pretty good job on this photo
---
Well done! Keep it up lad :)
---
Well the difference is Myers actively gains several buffs during his T3, such as longer lunge range and faster faults. Ghost face does not receive such buffs, he relies on ambush tactics
---
Go play Friday 13th and come back to me. Those are Devs that truly don't care
---
And Freddy is right next to her !
---
American Horror Story is Fox sadly
---
He is doing what is called a "Pro killer move".
---
*a ding ding ding*
---
He doesn’t get invited
---
as Noob3 says : i wonder when they tell us our hitboxes are the size of the map
---
Well played by that trapper
---
I ship it
---
Elaborate?
---
That Trapper big brain
---
Yeah fridays a mess but they can't really add anything new because of lawsuit stuff so i guess they gave up. But dbd has become very popular recently (reasons unknown) and the game still has lots of bugs.
---
It’s the crappers ancient Licensed cousin!
---
Although Behavior gets frustrating to deal with people still find the game fun and you know once in a while they do good. Like with the Ghostface buff.
---
Totally, but I do not understand why you tell me that, I do not see correlation
---
I mean if you find it cringy that's cool, just let people who enjoy it have fun with it. Not implying that you are but please don't be the fun police
---
SWF SHOULD HAVE THEIR OWN LOBBY!!
---
Freddy - try to keep all survivors in the dream world. Monitor and abuse is great with how the dream state works. Don't be afraid to slug one (down and leave there) towards the end, Even downed survivors are still in the dream state and you can see them from across the map. 
---
Also (at least on PS4) I've found you only have to hit them with the initial power to get them to dream state, chasing and holding it doesn't seem to do anything except maybe reduce the time slightly. Knowing this - when approaching multiple survivors at once - cast on each one then chase the last guy, the others will show up as soon as they are out of you radius.
---
Lets shows these killers what toxic really means😎
---
&gt; yes, i know how to loop...
---
I don't understand how bloodlust is an issue then.
---
&gt; and there is a reason why there is "waiting time" for killers while survivors get insta lobbies nowadays dont you think so?
---
Yeah, more people playing survivor than killer. That's nothing new though.
---
On topic: I think the devs should start properly punishing DCs, give an increasing match search cooldown like 10, 20, 30, 60 min cooldowns before you can search again if you DC.
---
Thanks! I love how supportive this community can be ❤️
---
Thanks, it’s great being part of a community that’s so supportive ❤️
---
The incredible thing is that after creating so many killers, they simply, just a couple of weeks from the official launch, put at our disposal something so poorly balanced, as if they had no experience making characters whatsoever
---
Bill ! Bill ! Bill ! Bill ! Bill!
---
Gonna complain about something that wasn’t authentic of course that’s common sense buddy  and why does running a distraction build matter??
---
While I wasn't able to find it, there was a statistics post made by another member showing that self care had a 20% use rate in about 100 games or something similar to that. Maybe someone will be able to help me out if they know which one I am talking about but I will get back to you.
---
Anyone else getting 4k sacrifices and getting entity displeased
---
there was nothing wrong with hitboxes in this clip
---
Outsmarted
---
but in fact it's shoopy papey so...
---
Lol moop
---
That's not what Peanits said?
---
Killers: I outplayed one survivor, wheres my 4k that I earned?
---
Survivors: Oh look another 3v1 because a team mate dc. Guess ill die. Oh look, Im on hook and no one is doing gens, guess I'll die. Oh look, 2 survivors have been sac'd on hook and the killer hasnt even hit me once yet. Guess ill die. 
---
If a killer loses, he either got outplayed or made too many mistakes. 
---
If a survivor loses, he either got outplayed, made a mistake *or never had a chance to survive because the game was thrown by a team mate completely out of the players control.*
---
You cant really compare the two sides in that way. Its like comparing scrabble to chess.
---
 [see this video for learning that kind of stuff!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYRKyFpyAys)
---
Never works when I see ppl use it, the pig always gets stunned or misses. Honestly I get more hits by being sneaky and just uncrouching than I do by ambushing
---
Oh yeah, the *drink* alright.
---
Tbh I never found the actress attractive. Thats just my opinion.
---
This is why no one plays killer
---
I think that killers need a buff
---
Testing with the public should be ‘is there a narrow corner case we missed’ or ‘is this tuned right’, not ‘does this basic part of it work right’.
---
It's fun with your friends and theres nothing else like it that is as fun..
---
 But they fix stupid things instead of what matters, killer mains cried and cried about MoM so they're gonna change it after it coming out 2 to 3 months ago.. but not stupid hit boxes? Constant dcs? The fact that exit doors spawn on the same wall? FIX HITBOXES, FIX BLOODLUST(ITS NOT NEEDED).. or the fact they have 2 killers in the game that are so over powered the nurse ignores all game mechanics , the fact that Billy has no cool downs and can constantly zip around the map...
---
Discovered him not too long ago when he had around 13K. Crazy to think he hit 30K so quickly. I’m happy for the guy :D
---
You did, you took the time out of your day to not only click on this post but respond to it.
---
I thought the point of the aforementioned challenge builds was that the challenge was enforced by addons?
---
I'm personally going to play a lot of Speed Limiter handsome chainsaw bois in the upcoming double points weekend.
---
Well done BHVR. I applaud how quickly you addressed the issue
---
Lmao
---
I feel like you don't know what the P in PTB stands for.
---
Holy fuck I'm going to try that.
---
Who wouldn't blame you. Hitboxes, both sides DC'ing, lag. It's killing the game, and their excuse it to wait 3 more months for dedicated servers to end world hunger too.
---
I kept popping stealth in chases because I thought that this was already a feature. Somehow the mindgames still worked out though.
---
Speed limiter addons after rank reset in Double bloodpoints= fun and points
---
True, I hate it when people accuse me of tunneling when I just happened to find that person. I also hate it when people call me a tunneler when I go to a hook after the person was freed and I only see the injured person, you're slower and lower on the food chain, I'm doing what a predator would do.
---
Seriously, it's just a guessing game for both parties. Not really skill based which I really don't like.
---
Yeah, even before I tried both sides I was never toxic to the killer. I tbag other survivors to say hello if they do it to me, but never the killer. It seems like something a child would do.
---
I think the worst thing I’ve done is wriggle free, then use a perk to recover from dying, then get lucky and pull myself off the hook. There were only two of us left doing 4 gens, but our luck finally ran out and the killer slashed me while hooked the entire time (other player was slugged) by then. It’s not toxic to be lucky, but I can see how it’d be annoying to the killer.
---
As killer, I’ve had someone tbag during a chase. It was more funny than annoying. They DCed after I hooked them.
---
The last event started at 00.00 UTC so im guessing this will be the same?? Maybe??
---
Other Redditors have said that OoO isn't supposed to affect him in Night Shroud, so it's supposedly a bug. Would be nice to be stealthy like Tier 1 Myers in Night Shroud and not be revealed.
---
Even if mew made the offering 25% rarer to make it the same thing. And something being nerfed doesnt make it balanced. What if for the DS nerf, they had reduced the stun time for the killer by 0.5 seconds and left everything else the same. The perk would still be very unbalanced.
---
Also, if Moris worked like how mew use them, say they could only be used on death hook, it would just be a cool way to kill survivors.
---
Although the killer does still have to have some skill for an ebony to do something while the survivor one wouldn't. I will admit to that. I've survived ebonies plenty of times but I know I couldn't 4k with the survivor one without perks that I dont normally run, such as noed or ruin
---
I feel like this:  [https://www.google.nl/search?q=Amanda+Young&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPlYf9x-biAhXELFAKHXS0CDkQ\_AUIECgB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969#imgrc=z3LXrHCMzTmkaM:](https://www.google.nl/search?q=Amanda+Young&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPlYf9x-biAhXELFAKHXS0CDkQ_AUIECgB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969#imgrc=z3LXrHCMzTmkaM:)  might change your mind. I know it did for me.
---
Id just like a mode where there is no swf. I play solo alot and sometimes people will prioritize eachother just because they are friends.
---
Uh? The new mobile game coming out in 2020 is being made by Finnish studio Next Games and Behaviour has nothing to do with the season 3 game.
---
Mathieu MCote even responded to this tweet:
---
https://twitter.com/mcote_bhvr/status/1139030572871950337?s=21
---
This is the shirtless Myers I really want.
---
Are you on xbox? Ill buy you one of them.
---
It sounds cursed... Why do I get gravity falls vibes off this
---
Lol, understandable that you'd think it is the bloodweb icon then. Doesn't change the quality of the meme tho. Good meme, keep em comming
---
Iwant the same thing, saying the conditions to reach a gen there as well
---
I remember when people said it would be meta on Nurse lol
---
What bp event?
---
I'm talking about in game lol. I'm a rank 7 survivor so they aren't the BEST but they are up there I suppose. But anyway, it's pretty easy to stop a pig who dashes when at a pallet. T-walls not so much but any pallet loop yes lol
---
Ah yes.
---
Mathieu Cot&amp;#233; my favourite member of BHVR
---
tfw you're a baby killer and rank reset overlaps with double bp weekend
---
;\_;
---
A shit Legion post on top of Daddy. And no mention of Artist either. Don't even get me started on your awful spelling error.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
At the bottom of the patch notes it states.
---
"Full patch notes will be posted tomorrow when the PTB update launches."
---
Im gonna snag dance with me cuz I dont wanna level kate but you do you
---
I know what she looks like lol. I just don't find her attractive. Its ok if you do. Oink!
---
SteamDB shows PTB wasn't updated in 9 days. So we have to wait, I think
---
That is okay brother, you do you and live happy OINK!
---
Yeah it’s very irritating, once we have good dedicated servers, the problem will be less apparent. It really isn’t hitboxes tho(don’t get me wrong, Hatchet hitboxes are still pretty big, but that’s not the issue here)
---
Or bioshock.
---
Nice. I feel bad sometimes. But in red ranks its fckn rare.
---
Chill nea
---
You play vs bad Piggies then, that's it.
---
Remember when they reworked Legion and Pig? It seemed like their ideas were from someone who haven't even played. Like they had just had the game described to them.
---
We will make them love Pig, by testing them.
---
Jokes on you, I already commented that 4hours ago.
---
Jokes on you, typing it out makes it correct
---
Double BP Weekend 14-18th June. Its mentioned further down the page in the link below
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/65822/year-3-anniversary-activity-schedule
---
Let the Oinkers Oink.
---
There’s a difference between fun and being a technological masterpiece.  Some people, myself included, find this game fun.
---
I'm having the same problem
---
I feel ya aint no chill on rank 1 people tryhard for their life
---
They also did state somewhere they want to change aura reading on most killers.
---
You imply that they **needed** the community to discover the problems with Ghostface. Which paints a shockingly bleak picture of their team's capabilities.
---
True
---
Same, both survivor and killer.
---
It was confirmed it was a bug so Lilkley was fixed
---
I kinda miss earlier Survivor seasons.
---
I implied nothing. My statements are exactly what I wrote and I mean exactly what I say. No implication here. 
---
Things happen as they try to put things into actual game servers, so they test them. Not a shocker that they found something wrong with GF. Good thing there’s a PTB rather than straight to live servers. 
---
Open your mind.
---
Duh. The game is gonna have bugs no matter what. As of now there’s nothing game breaking or anything that should totally ruin your enjoyment unless little tiny things affect you that much.
---
Im not saying its not fun i enjoyed it with friends but nothing has been fixed and the games getting worse.
---
I would like to ask if there will be a really noticable change after wasting 50 level of items and perks
---
&gt; Ghost Face will now receive a short Killer Instinct effect on the Survivor that revealed them
---
Does this mean he can activate it right in someone's face to get the buff?
---
Maybe just add this to Left Behind?
---
Forgot to add monstrous shrine, saw that shit perk 3 times in a row and finally bought it so it would stop showing up.
---
Oh well
---
If you got friends it’s the best game you could get very fun to play with friends
---
Oh okay thanks
---
It is broken. And never play by yourself. And as someone who does, I can't help but love it. Maybe its cos I'm a masochist.
---
Only have them in CS:GO but i could make some by playing i guess.
---
It reveals them with a legion reveal
---
Who does play the game or play by himself?
---
If you run a cultist Dwight build you will definitely make friends :)
---
His power will reveal suviviors who end his power
---
Lol I don't think that's the case. Everyone plays differently so killers have different strategies. One strategy might work for some ppl like ambush dash mind games and they might not work for others, just like simply uncrouching works for some ppl but not others. And that's not considering the survivors skill levels either. I don't think it's necessarily correct to say that all the pigs that can't do the ambush is bad pigs.

---
Then you don't understand the implication: Ghostface as he was introduced to the PTB initially was a horrifically poor killer. If the PTB was necessary for the devs to realize how horrifically poor he was, then that really doesn't speak well at all for the people responsible for design and balance.
---
You don't seem to understand that Ghostface did not undergo some minor tweaks but a significant overhaul. This begs the question: How did the people responsible for design and balance not realize their killer was junk when they first created him? Did they know but were simply rushed to get the killer pushed out or were they legitimately oblivious to his problems. You imply that they were oblivious.
---
DBD is a great game. Ignore the people who say only play with Friends. It is still fun by yourself, especially if you want to increase the difficulty.
---
This game is more deep than i thought in the first place. I thought perks were a paytowin option and there are way more killers nowadays
---
Insta downs aren't op thoigh look at all the people who don't cleanse vs plague
---
Oh. My. God.
---
Keep them.
---
okay the picture was already funny enough but these comments are funny as hell
---
I have like 2.5k hours on the game, it was worth it for me
---
Mettle of Man/Dead Hard/ Adrenaline/ Plunderer’s Instinct ... when I have potato teammates, plunderers is nice to get a key and get out in the Endgame Meta
---
Erm... I play the game by myself if that counts?
---
Cheers for the tips! I’ll definitely keep them in mind!
---
I meant the "as someone who does" part of yours, but nevermind xD
---
IIRC It is not inspired in Matt but rather someone else in BHVR, this has been said by Matt himself during Q&amp;As on dev streams.
---
You used the word "Never", though. If ambush never works, it's because the killer is not good.
---
in my country that means "a slut"
---
Will probably be updates at Like noon.
---
Again, there’s an reason I don’t understand the implication, it’s because I didn’t make one. 
---
The devs make a PTB in order to find problems. The final product is important, the initial one is not. Since you know so much about game design, let me explain that it’s much easier to introduce a weak killer with potential buff ideas than a strong killer with potential nerf ideas. This becomes even more true since their community will complain either way. 
---
Once again, I implied nothing. You took it as an implication instead of face value. That is your fault, not mine. Do not tell me that my words mean something that I did not say. That is the quickest way to get me to end a conversation.
---
let’s bring out those iri heads😎
---
Please I just want a peaceful double bp event. I’m tired of that tryharding shit...
---
Lmfao thanks for that
---
Its not tiny things tho hit boxes are broken the game runs at like 2fps there's no DC penalty no camping or tunnelling pentaly. There are loops that survivors can run for ever, new killers are underpowered old killers ard overpowered the game mode that lets you play with friends is a mess, you still can't leave a lobby with friends. Like just basic shit is not in the game.
---
Almost all of the threads that ask for info are things that can be found by searching the forums or googling. That's probably the reason why they get downvoted.
---
I don't really mind those threads, so I just sort by new. I don't care for all the meme stuff.
---
Or the spirt sounds.
---
While Survivor isn’t as good, the equivalent is 
---
We’re Gonna Live Forever / Borrowed Time / Prove Thyself / Exhaustion Perk of Choice
---
dont get frustrated when you fuck up, every killer player ever makes fuck ups, even the people who've played since launch make fuck ups or have a bad match.
---
so cute
---
"never" is just representing how it's hardly seen lol. It wasn't meant to be taken so literal.
---
Look where my Feng is looking. We were facing a Spirit, so it wasn't Myers. The crows didn't help either lol. Turns out it was just a hook.
---
Also, I was using a build focused on keeping people alive.
---
Just speaking my mind lol.. glad you agree
---
Game is fun, if you don't take it too seriously. It's "broken" only if you play for results, not for having fun in the process.
---
To fight boredom you can: play both sides, play different killers (their powers differ a lot), use different builds
---
Amazing to see a legacy trapper with those moves. Love it
---
This and the crapper are forces of chaotic good
---
"See,pulled a sneaky one on ya."
---
not saying all the non meme threads are interesting, but why downvoting it ? It's thanks to threads like it that you find informations on google then.
---
The middle ones happy because that survivor wouldn’t stop following them.
---
De-rank
---
Give em props, I wouldn't be butthurt lol.
---
Hit boxes are not broken. Devs have already said its a latency issue. The game now runs 60 FPS on all platforms including console. There is a camping and tunneling penalty, you lose tons of points and depip for doing either. Ghost Face and Plague are far from underpowered, they’re both mid tier at worst. The only overpowered killer is Nurse. They shortened loops, and spread out pallets, plus they got rid of many of the safe loops survivors relied on. Stop making things up.
---
This sub is basically just 90% memes, if you want actual discussion you should probably go to the official forum
---
Yes, if you level up to level 50 then there will be this skull in the middle of the blood web and you can get a bloody version of the default skin
---
Same here. I can’t start a lobby as killer. It acts like it’s searching for a few minutes then kicks me back to the title screen.
---
Where's that guy and his pig=upvote on every post concerning pig?
---
Yes i know i read the 7 pages of the PDF File, i never said it was an unfair delete, i am just sad about it, calm down and don't dislike this post xd
---
I do tend to get frustrated, last game I played as Billy, I missed a vital hit by millimetres when an injured survivor hopped a window, and that put me on a bad streak. That same game, I mistimed so much because I was so pissed off 😅 so this is pretty great advice 👍🏼
---
There's something to be said for having achievements. They're proof that you did something extraordinary, usually, and that's why they have value. 
---
Unless it's like introductory achievements like what Resident Evil does. "Close a door all by yourself"!
---
Explains the empathy, it's an underrated perk imp
---
I love it. It's a great endgame perk if you can get the last three generators close to one another. A lot of pressure can be applied to panicky survivors, especially if there's only three of them left.
---
But I'm sure they would make an exception for pig because of my following argument:
---
O
---
I
---
N
---
K
---
But the basement rave was no doubt legendary.
---
#GODDAMMIT!
---
sloppy butcher and nurse's calling should become more and more meta
---
Also while we're at it, give Killers a way to keep their addons (like survivors can keep their items) without using a Black Ward.
---
Also give Killers a way to find ultra-rare addons mid-trial, like survivors can from find ultra-rare items from chests, and ultra-rare offerings (or some equivalent to Ace in the Hole) with a perk.
---
Killers do need more bloodpoints to maintain their kit, given that even with addons they're not always in a good spot.
---
I'm getting into Survivor matches now at least
---
It sounds more Hebrew than anything to me, mostly due to the throatiness of the incantation. But it's hilarious that it means "Oh, Fuck!" in Polish.
---
It's been tested by someone in this subreddit that getting to P3 offers a SLIGHT increase in ultra rares.  Apart from the bloody cosmetics, I dont think it's worth it.
---
OH! OHHHHHH, SON! NICE!
---
See that'd be a perfect ideal. It's gonna take the "stomp all over you" good players like a week or so to get up to their rank so why not let em have their fun for longer? It just baffles me that a "season" lasts anywhere near this short.
---
French-Canadian
---
I could do both, but only one of them I might.
---
It's a SLIGHT increase.  Not worth it in my opinion.  And it only applies to ultra rares.
---
If you read why did you submit it anyway?  Why are you telling me to calm down? And I have the right to downvote haha
---
This would've been perfect with Myers chase sound effect lol dun dda du  daaa dun teee teee teee
---
Actually it's you're
---
I love bond and empathy.
---
If it's like previous Bloodhunts, it'll start tomorrow (14th of June) at 19:30 BST.
---
You really are a weird human being. 
---
It could be a joke. It could be due to the running joke of adding shirtless Myers to the game. Who knows?
---
wu sez am geh\*
---
*Haddonfield intro plays so loudly it tunes out all sound*
---
Well im not saying ambush doesn't work on looping but I am saying dashing works for some pigs but not all of them. And I will say just cause someone can't hit a dash attack doesn't make them bad considering there's more factors than just being bad like survivors know how to counter or they could get stuck, survivor jukes it etc. Besides, in my original comment everything I listed I said works for ME and I just gave the advice. So when u said that it's bad advice and that bad players can't hit ambush attacks of I'm going to defend my playstyle especially if it works for me.
---
Yeah, empathy has range, which is why I use it all the time. That and I don't have bond 😂
---
Is he a actually good now?
---
This, is the power of Cot&amp;#233;
---
I don’t even understand OPs meme.  Shouldn’t it be pics of other survivors he’s going to farm?
---
BTW I plan on playing killer most of the weekend.  So much easier to get stacks and BP as a killer imo.
---
Fuckin' FUCK!
---
That Claudette in the background tho.
---
"You're doing great son!"
---
ANYTHING???????!! Anything
---
if you think this game is a mess, play Friday the 13th. that game is a fucking disaster. 
---
This game really isn't that bad, to be honest.
---
yes!
---
That's my fetish.
---
THANK GOD
---
Im think about The Warrior
---
His image is like a mid-age knight with a greatsword but bloody and he lost all the reasoning,left only pure rage
---
Power:Berserker rage
---
His power will go around a Rage meter that grow gradually when chasing,and go up greatly when suffering in all form of stun(an amount of Rage gain isnt count by a stun but a time that he suffer from stun)
---
When he have enough rage he can change from a sword into a claymore that can use in 2 ways,Cleave and Downward Slash. Cleave done like a Cannibal's chainsaw but deal 1 state damage and swing only 1 time. Downward Slash gives him more lunge range and his attack can destroy pallet but his attack have more cooldown than the normal attack(like his blade is stick into the ground and take some times to pull them up)
---
The whole post in the forums was a joke xd i put 
---
Killer: Michael Myers
---
Skin Name: Psychotic Daddy
---
Mask: Daddy White Mask
---
Torso: Hot six pack
---
Knife: Butter Knife
---
i just wanted to have fun, they should just closed it, idk why they deleted it , that's why i just posted it on reddit. you don't have to be rude with this post , maybe my friend could do a skin for piggy too who knows???
---
Kurwa means both Fuck (the "I hurt myself" FUCK, not the action of copulation) and Slut in Polish
---
Yeah we gay. Keep scrolling.
---
Creepypasta about slenderman
---
First impressions from this image, why is he trying to be Markiplier?
---
And it didn't take years like Freddy
---
Oh, personally I'm not downvoting anything. I just suspect that's what's going on. People can only see so many "advice for a new player" or "best way to get BP" topics before they get tired of them. On other subs you'll also see downvoting of topics that come up regularly if there's no moderation of those kinds of things. 
---
As for why the memes are so popular here, you got me. Maybe the demographic of this sub is also the meme demographic.
---
I would say one of these is not like the others but...seems about right.
---
Wooow that resolution
---
Jokes on you, I only play killer.
---
Sure, but intent makes the difference
---
They are accurate for the user. 
---
Which is the most important part. It's a poor solution to an even poorer problem but it's a solution none the less. Here's an example of what it looked like, if you search for Huntress nerf around late September 2018 you'll find similar stuff
---
https://i.gyazo.com/3cc206a5f65721c7a29870def6933685.mp4
---
The way Huntress is now, is good, that's really all there is to say about it.
---
I'd say toggle EW1 that enables EW3 but without the vault speed, terror radius or global exposed but you're not wrong with dead rabbit.
---
I personally don't know if it's power creep but I imagine in high level play we're looking at one instant down on the second or third chase and no new way to deal with pallets or loops. And no way to apply pressure. He'll probably stomp beige ranks and then yellow ranks depending on your play region.
---
Imagine having every perk with diversion you could become the goat
---
I think you just made the point for yourself. If it’s available months later, they make money from those who don’t want to wait. Those who do wait get them with shards and would never have spent money anyway.
---
They are purely cosmetic skins.
---
Make it like how new gens work, and your gen scores are scaled to 9minutes if the game lasted less than that. If your game lasted 4:30 then you scores in other categories are doubled, if they it lasts 6minutes then scores are 50% more.
---
What claudette.....?  😁
---
WELL OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT AS STRONG AS THE OLD DS, BUT IT'S STILL ANNOYING WHEN SOMEONE DOES A DUMB HOOK SAVE BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THEY HAVE DS SO YOU CAN'T GRAB THEM ANYWAYS.
---
DADDY OMG PLS **** ** skdkgkg
---
But crouching and traps are also her power as well.
---
Besides it's no different than Billy's, Huntresses and Leatherfaces doing M1 attacks instead of chainsaw and hatchets. 
---
But anyway either way, crouching or ambushing, they both are strategies and bot are viable. Whichever ppl choose to use is on them.
---
*Halloween theme starts playing on recorder*
---
Myers makes me feel more unsettled and on edge just because he tends to jump scare me the most. 
---
Also Claudettes.
---
Camping isn’t the devs’ problem. People are always going to do it no matter what. Nothing they do is going to change that. Hillbilly can be looped very easily and his turning with his chainsaw is difficult so all it takes is a quick turn to avoid the insta-down. The killer shack is easily solved too—break the damn pallet or run bamboozle. Nurse I agree is overpowered but she’s extremely difficult to master. Stop asking people what they like about the game then telling them they’re wrong, it makes you look like an idiot.
---
You just said the devs don’t listen, then gave an example of the devs listening. And Legion is fine now, I don’t know what you’re talking about.
---
Would the killers respect you after the game or say it's to op though hmmm
---
Got a laugh out of me Haha, but yeah the format is a little hard to follow. Otherwise its great!
---
You would prob be his new god lol
---

Okay... one sec.
---
1. I want a strong killer, not a broken killer. My argument is that Survivors are going to complain about "no skill" because of how many benefits GF gets upon getting his power canceled.
---
The benefits are... a bit unnecessary, and I feel like this will fuel bad stealth and fuel Survivor complaints as a result.
---
You seem to be thinking strong killer = broken.
---
2. I think he will be on Nurse par. Or close to it. Or Legion, if the buffs go as I expect. He DEFINITELY does not need more buffs. However, if I'm wrong, more buffs would be acceptable.
---
3. What did you expect from devs who prioritize fun over balance? They want people to keep spending money, especially on cosmetics, the playerbase won't do that if the game isn't fun for them. The devs have even said fun is more important over balance.
---
However, a significant amount of buffs have been Killer-sided lately. Or for both sides. NOED buff, Ruin buff, EGC... Survivors got free hatch, Legion nerfs and Pig nerfs.
---
THIS GAME FUCKING SUCKS! FIX YOUR GOD-DAMNED HIT BOXES AND STOP BLAMING EVERYTHING ON LAG! STOP BLAMING THE 105 DEGREE LOS ANGELES WEATHER ON LAG! I DON'T WANT TO WAIT THREE FUCKING MONTHS TO FIX YOUR GAME!

Yep, the update has just gone out.

at least you know where one player is.

Stratched P3 Meyers and Santa Clown time.

If you mean live to the PTB, then as of like three minutes ago, yes.

We have found something stronger then the entity.

Go for it. Before buying i was watching youtube and streams too, but i decided to play myself and i don't regret it. Game is super fun and honestly it's the only game that i rather play alone than with friends. Also tomorrow starts x2 bloodpoint weekend so it might be a great opportunity for you to join and farm some points!
---
🙏🏽
---
What is bloodhunt
---
Idk how consoles handle the speed of The Legion or the gas of The Clown (In terms of fps) so I can't help in that aspect, what I can help with is by perks and how they play.
---
The Clown is one of the better killers when it comes to ending loops at pallets and windows due to his power, it doesn't always guarantee a hit and better survivors will know the limits they can go to with it but there are better survivors who are greedy and will try to make the most of it and will fuck up.
---
The Legion is one of the better killers for acquiring a first hit on a survivor (Wraith is a good one as well), but subsequent hits are hard due to him basically having no other real way of getting a hit other than perks. Speaking of perks:
---
The Clown has 1 Very Good Perk, **Bamboozle**, which to my knowledge destroys any infinite in the game. A Middling game slowing perk, **Pop Goes The Weasel**, although requires you to get a hook before it can be used. And a lesser perk, **Coulrophobia**, which can be good in builds built around a huge terror radius.
---
The Legion has 1 Very Good Perk, **Discordance**, which pretty much eliminates most of the power of gen rushing (2+ Survs on a gen, good against swf). Another somewhat swf counter perk, **Mad Grit**, which makes survivors blocking the hook against you completely useless. And finally **Iron Maiden**, if you hate the residents Dwights you play against for hiding in Lockers.
---
tomorrow of which year ?
---
Beacuse your points are invalid and you defending a dumb game
---
Indeed
---
Legion was weak, yet annoying to the playerbase. MANY people, including this subreddit, complained about Legion being OP. Especially old Frank's Mixtape. And how you would be downvoted into Oblivion if you said otherwise or tried to lost the significant counterplay to old Frenzy.
---
People would mass DC upon seeing Legion. Don't you remember?
---
I myself got many downvotes for saying something along those lines. 
---
If you are getting upvoted and Im getting downvoted, this subreddit has either become very killer sided, the Survivors have shut up, or this subreddit has simply... forgotten about the major hatred Legion got 24/7.
---
Actually me right now trying to get borrowed time
---
The way I see it is we have 2 MOM which barely counts because it rewards you for saving people and adrenaline 
---
Killers have NOED  Rancor end game collapse unrelenting Remember me and other perks
---
Yeah baaaby
---
I agree that both sides have to guess a lot in that situation, but I'd argue that Spirit has less of that.
---
Survivor has to guess whether or not she's vaulting because for some reason they didn't give her a vaulting animation (even tho she apparently had one on the ptb), passive phasing is completely random and you can sometimes get really lucky with it and get a hit for free. When you are phasing you can see scratches, look at the grass, hear footsteps and breathing/pained moans. 
---
Half of the time you can stand still and observe where the survivor is going to get a more accurate phase while they have no clue that you can see them.
---
Double bloodpoints
---
It's gonna take a lot of stabs and stuns to butter that bagel.
---
Well, that's exactly my point. Being down one survivor is terribly stressful in this game, so of I have a chance to put one out early, especially if it's before Ruin is gone, that makes it like 10 times worse on everyone else, and WAY more likely I'm getting a 4k.
---
no one cares
---
No they’re not. You can hate the game all you want but I and many others love it and that’s our opinions.
---
Because the Spirit and the Wraith’s names already translate to “The Ghost” in other languages.
---
Get 'em both.

---
Oh my god you’re insufferable and completely ignorant.
---
Impossible - according to this sub, touching a dull totem will immediately down all survivors
---
Lol. Added to the suspense!
---
I would definitely try it. This is literally the only game I consistently pick up and play. As someone who doesn’t usually care much for competitive online games and sticks to the longer story games, I still pick this game up several times a week. Heck, when I am unable to play or on vacation, I practically get withdrawal. 
---
It can be difficult and overwhelming at first so if you try it, keep that in mind,m in your early hours, but DBD is one of the only games I’ve experienced that (usually) gets better the more I play it. People complain about bugs and balance a lot but that’s to be expected in an asymmetrical game like this, and the Devs deserve a lot of credit as they do regularly try to provide updates, new content, and events. They’re one of the few Dev teams that really love their game.
---
Gay guys want him cuz he is cute af
---
I met him while playing Friday the 13th.   He didn't like me very well.  :(
---
Makes some decent DBD content though, better than most!
---
I don't like stranger things a lot, BUT i would love to see demogorgon as a killer and Nancy as survivor
---
Nope. Every time Michael has been unmasked as an adult throughout the entire series, he’s had dark hair. Additionally, the actor who played him as a child has dark hair as an adult (but young Michael also didn’t have bleach blonde hair). Laurie’s hair is never bleached blonde, she’s got a dirty blonde.

*sigh* my wife and I do it to eachother just for laughs.
---
I'm actually pretty happy with these changes! I wasn't expecting them to be THAT good! Nice job devs!
---
Lol this just made me think of how funny it would be to have a killer who doesn't use a weapon but instead punches or kicks people. I would enjoy this
---
Literally me outside my house every time I get teabagged at the exit gate.
---
Oof, father's day is Sunday
---
Bit of a necro but you can absolutely infect people on the hook. You have to aim at their feet or the area under their feet to start their infection timer but that's about it.
---
it's literally 2 buttons.
---
Are the hair changes in this patch ?
---
I think it's really good if you play solo, a lot of the time im making saves all game but when it's my turn nobody comes to save me. Also you can make some really good plays to save others with this, like intentionally getting yourself hooked instead because you know you can get off, can buy some time to let everyone and you escape.
---
Yes! I got it for free since I have PlayStation Plus but I've ended up buying every single killer, a few Cosmetics and a few survivers as well.
---
That it deadass half my build haha. I can 50% a gen, get awaY before the killer sees me, and then jump right back on it. I love stealth playstyles because I start freaking out if I'm hiding under the killer's nose and I don't know if they're going to see me or not.
---
No
---
Dude. Thats every killer on SWF. Every killer gets fucked by SWF.
---
Clown
---
I wouldn't use mom it's going to be Nerfed shortly, my build for try Harding is iron will, adrenaline, balanced and ds I really recommend iron will a ton of killers track by sound in higher ranks
---
Yes. But when he first came out, everyone thought Legion was garbarge and needed buffs. Which they got. Then that problem happened
---
Safe unhooks + protection hits made it extremely easy to get MoM up, specially if you had Borrowed Time.
---
Players need to remember that you also get "protection stacks" by getting hit near someone hooked, someone downed, while you are healing another survivor or while the killer is carrying someone.
---
As it was, you could just take a random hit at any point while the killer was carrying another survivor, disappear and heal. At a later point, you could take a hit while unhooking and this would be your last two stacks to get MoM up.
---
I totally get it why people might think it was hard to get MoM up but unless you are an immersed player, it wasn't.
---
Not saying this current version is perfect but definitely harder than the previous one and we all know the live version is borderline broken.
---
ty king
---
Same here. I'm a survivor main and I've had it activated way before the gens are done many times.  When I play killer, which has been a lot lately, it rarely comes into play when the exit gates are opened. I think its ridiculous another survivor perk is getting a nerf.
---
Should be midnight UTC, so 8pm EST

1000 IQ killer
---
But 3 hits? I mean ideally you would love to get stacks without getting hooked. Worst case scenario (you take 3 hits and get hooked every time) it's a wasted perk slot. Best case scenario, you don't get hooked and wasted a bunch of time GOING OUT OF YOUR WAY to go take hits and wasting EVEN MORE time to heal 3 times. There's no good trade offs. Protection hits aren't very organic and aren't directly an 'objective' while unhooking people is. I think you should have to work for the perk, I DON'T think you should have to waste time to get the perk to work
---
I haven't been able to play on my account in a week, gotta love bugs
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
I really like that it is so often because the lower ranks become a chore to play at when I start to get past 8 or 7 (killer and survivor).
---
Except if survivors circle around the hook and don't do generators, that's guaranteed to be a sacrifice and another chase. That alone pretty much amounts to 10K. I've played insiduous basement bubba and still gotten more than 6K even if they all do gens from start to finish and then run out without attemtping to save, which should really put into perspective how little 6K points are
---
Stop trying to shame the idea of strategizing around survivors making really dumb mistakes like circling the hook for a save, which gives the killer no incentive to leave
---
Yeah im all for having to actually work for your stacks, because it's a strong perk, but with this change i can't really see myself using it anymore. This game bugs out sometimes and a protection hit might not even register. I don't really take enough hits in a match to make this perk useful for me, if someone is being chased im working on a gen, not following them around waiting to slip in.
---
I'm gonna miss One Punch Freddy if this means you can't insta-gib them with Rancor anymore. Used to switch to that build every time I saw an Ash with a medkit in the lobby because 90% of the time he had MoM + an Instaheal and that was a level of bullshit I was not willing to put up with.
---
I'm not reading all that. 
---
But I will say I've never been able to get rid of the threat of NOED at multiple locations at the drop of a hat. So your statement is 100% misleading and just dumb honestly.
---
You’re still beautiful Meg
---
They want it in post game lobby though
---
&gt;But 3 hits? I mean ideally you would love to get stacks without getting hooked. Worst case scenario (you take 3 hits and get hooked every time) it's a wasted perk slot. Best case scenario, you don't get hooked and wasted a bunch of time GOING OUT OF YOUR WAY to go take hits and wasting EVEN MORE time to heal 3 times. There's no good trade offs. Protection hits aren't very organic and aren't directly an 'objective' while unhooking people is. I think you should have to work for the perk, I DON'T think you should have to waste time to get the perk to work
---
Like I said, don't honestly think this new version is perfect so we will have to wait and see how it ends up working. 
---
People thought protection hits + safe unhooking would be hard to get MoM up but as it turned out, it was easier than getting 3 M1s.
---
Hex: No One Escapes Death is a Killer perk that increases movement speed for the Killer and gives Survivors the Exposed (insta-down) effect once the Exit Gates are powered.
---
Thnx
---
The person on the hook shouldn't be allowed to alert the other survivors to Ghostface's presence. So the hooked survivor shouldn't be allowed to detect and break GF's ability when he's sneaking around. Only survivors on the ground should be able to. it should be similar to how when you're playing against the pig, if you go in for a save, you have no idea if that Pig is crouched around the corner waiting for you to pop MYC. It just feels broken to me if GF is crouching trying to stalk someone and a person on the hook sees him and breaks his power.
---
Yeah, but in a game where seeing him drag people on hooks is kinda crutial I can't imagine how that would work. I'm not saying he's not super strong on something, but it seems like so many thing would have to be done with the game just for him to work.
---
I either wake up super early to start playing or I constantly debate myself all day long if I should get in for a few games instead of just watching videos.
---
Same, sounds like Bill Cipher took control of the movie.
---
Overall, great changes. They addressed all the things I was hoping for :) I don’t think he will be top tier, but I would imagine that he will be a fun solid mid tier killer, which is fine. Can’t wait for the potential mind games :D
---
I liked Farmer John but the more I watched his videos the more I disliked him. It feels that the dude just shit talks other people way too much and it kinda put me off. His videos have nice editing and some good music, but it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth after watching them.
---
I feel like an idiot for saying this while in this thread everyone (or at least most people) is praising him, but I just wanted to state my opinion on him (didn't watched his recent videos, so he may have gotten better and I may be wrong too).
---
Yeah, if protection hits were consistent then i wouldn't think this was too bad, but it's still also going to be a huge time-waster too. Finding people to take hits for AND then going to heal yourself, rinse and repeat. Bleh.
---
Safe from everyone except huntress who can yeet hatchets your way and nurse who can blink up instead of the taking the stairs. Otherwise very safe.
---
Shit like this is like saying to someone “im vegan” no ones cares, it’s like me commenting “well unluckily for you and this meme I AM straight” no one cares just shut up.
---
Still you can see people coming from a mile away up there
---
Lmao rekt
---
If your question is " are you going to make more" then the answer is maybe 
---
For now as I said , I have exams , and after exams , I will have laziness lol
---
That’s what happens when your team takes away your chances at BP farming; depip happens to killer too without hooks so don’t feel to salty, just hold on for servers  and I bet we will start seeing changes within the coming months :)
---
I think the only exception to the "9 hooks pip" rule should be Moris, since those are a built-in feature to make killing a Survivor easier. But if a Survivor suicides or DCs it should count as 3 hooks. It's not my fault the Survivors don't go for hook saves.
---
i got outplayed
---
Sorry
---
Considering the other two spots for gens in that house I’ll take that any day.  Also the map had about 3 pallets so it was all kinds of messed up.
---
Mettle might as well be a damn killer perk at this point. 
---
"Hey come let me hit you so you can run away and waste time healing. And then do that 3 times. I know i may have to hit you one extra time after that but at least i get to see your aura at all times after you heal"
---
Nah, happens to me all the time on billy cause i suck at chainsaws, but still good at running people down XD  I still get boatloads of BP.
---
*urge to throw down on someone’s head intensifies*
---
Since Dbd is getting more and more annoying as killer ( for my part it became too easy at least ) , I think it would have been better if no one made an f13 game , not those two studios at least.
---
I played the beta , and then played 400h starting from day one ...F13 was good but yeah...the devs didn't anticipate this lawsuit thing.
---
Excuse me, but what add-ons are you running exactly were your chainsaw takes that long to charge?

---
I was gonna try to farm with her but was afraid she’d just kill me instead so I left... they were trying for adept too.
---
So is this entire sub what's your point?
---
You say that but people in this game have always taken everyone else's opinion depending on their hours/achievements in game "Oh you dont really play X killer, you dont have y and z achievement you can't really argue, Oh you can't talk for survivors you have never hit rank 1".
---
In the case of DBD, achivements do have a certain importance, at least in the discussion section it would seem. Also private profile = the devil.
---
&gt; The person on the hook shouldn't be allowed to alert the other survivors to Ghostface's presence
---
refer to my previous answer
---
The entity is a cold, heartless bastard
---
That’s a guy? Not hating but still...
---
i asked someone about this once, they stated it was just a meme. our match didn't take place against the stated killer, so i was unable to verify.
---
Come watch mee stream please? im playing dead by daylight and open to play with viewers?
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/xg\_hocko](https://www.twitch.tv/xg_hocko)
---
Just play how you want to with whoever you're feeling at the time. Regardless of whatever side you take,  you're taking a gamble that some people just wanna move on to what's next ASAP.
---
Did you get to see what killers were on the switch version?!
---
Honestly?? Lmao you’re right. Maybe it’s because of the game but a lot of people here act like cranky babies and don’t know how to have discussions or take jokes lol
---
I was watching True's stream of the new PTB update and from what I can tell it may be just a tiny (insignificant) bit louder than before. It sounds amazing compared to the live build where all sound just becomes a mess of loud noises when chasing someone.
---
Is that Dwight ?
---
No, I was holding it down.
---
Meg's ass was just too powerful.
---
I'd much more believe that than someone saying she is top tier.
---
Shes not terrible, but just because she is your main doesn't make her good.
---
a side note, even an activated RTB (Reverse Bear Trap) survivor can safely leave via the hatch
---
Don’t forget the hatch if there’s only one left!
---
Alright enough of dbd sub, thanks all
---
I donot understand what happened in this video. It looked like you chainsawed them and they duplicated themself.
---
so i just played a game where all three were locatwd nest to generators.  all six items were i survivors spawn.  its okay, if the odd were tirnwd around i still qould have lost
---
It's true. I just find it hilarious that what you're saying isn't even debatable and it's still downvoted. Mikey has always had dark brown hair. I also love the movies, and own each and every one on disc. 
---
So fucking stupid.
---
Happy oinks
---
Come on pc mate, console players are comparatively more cunty.
---
WE don't Condone that
---
Theres double blood points? Man Im out of touch
---
How do i stop gettin notifications for this sub? Im not subbed and i would not like to get notifications for it.
---
Your doing gods work with these vids.
---
No, play killer alittle bit it’ll help your perspective
---
Ghostface x Huntress... that would be epci, one little guy with a big thicc girl
---
You're right, yeah, but I'm just saying that I think the "look" they go for (especially with long hair) is that young Myers in H2, whether it's accurate or not. And I suppose you're right about Laurie too, it just always had a bleached (I guess lightened would be a better word for it?) look to me, especially towards the beginning of the movie, but I see what you mean about dirty blonde! 
---
I guess my point is a lot of artists don't look too deeply into it, lol
---
When you take the new guy under your wing and let him work the late night shift at the hardware store... 
---
😔
---
I'll wait to see it in action before I call it a complete failure, but I'm highly skeptical. Considering the VFX on the gen and 5+ seconds they had for the timer, the only survivors you are catching with that power are idiots.
---
Protip: Play survivor a bit and take notes of the most common spawn places in each map. Take note of what generators usually pop first in the map, that also tells you where your fellow survivors spawned too.
---
There are spawn points that are very consistent on each map, knowing them will help you decide which spots to check firts and maybe catch a survivor rushing to do gens from the start, catching a survivor within the first minute of the match plays a HUGE advantage for you in terms of map pressure.
---
Don't listen to this guy anyways. Playing by yourself is absolutely fine, you just gotta deal with dumb teammates sometimes. Chances are you'll make some friends while playing like I did and have a team to play with eventually. Absolutely buy this game it is a ton of fun
---
*NO*
---
I guess, but even in the rob zombie films, as an adult he’s got darker hair too. and really artists not looking into it are just being lazy tbh? I’m an artist and I always get references before drawing something, I don’t know many who don’t do that.
---
Y'hate t'see it
---
then you find out you taught them to well, and they start teabagging the killer vehemently and clicking their flashlight. Then start saying GGEZ in post game chat, then they start playing as Nea or Blendette.
---
Then you have to think about what you've created.
---
Seems like other people also have the right to downvote too.
---
(insert surprised pikachu face)
---
Run my king, run
---
No, the problem is it wastes an extreme amount of time finding them all, which opens survivors up to getting downed more often and keeps them from doing the gens like they're supposed to do. 
---
Basically, you're expected to waste 3-5 minutes finding and breaking all the totems just for the chance they have noed. Thats like if adrenaline kicked in after getting hooked twice, instantly healing you all the way and getting you off the hook, but the killer could stop it if he just destroyed some medical stations on the map hidden all around!
---
It's a crutch for killers who were playing bad.
---
It's fine the way it is. Getting protection hits is not that difficult and just requires you being willing to put yourself in danger when at full health. You can get it four ways:
---
- Bodyblocking someone running away from the killer.
---
- Taking a hit while the killer is carrying someone to the hook.
---
- Taking a hit in front of someone hooked (even if you aren't trying to unhook).
---
-  Taking a hit while standing over someone slugged.
---
If you get hit while healing someone.
---
Not to mention that sometimes you get a protection hit prompt at times when you aren't really protecting someone.
---
Getting stacks for safe unhooks is far too easy and there are already perks for rewarding you for safe unhooks. At least MoM rewards you for doing something different but even more altruistic.
---
YOU CAN PLAY TO UNLOCK LEGION? WHY THE FUCK DID NO ONE TELL ME?
---
I prefer Legion, I think Clown has FPS problems with his power when that pink cloud is released - however I'd just get them both to be honest.
---
Clown's good for ending chases and loops with his power, Legion is good for tracking down survivors via his power and getting quick hits.
---
Exactly... plus also bimbofying Laurie is literally missing the entire point of her character... they chose Jamie Lee because she was plain-looking in comparison to the other girls in the film (PJ Soles was a playboy bunny or something, for reference).

Not bad at all, charming even :3

I have corrupt intervention to serve the same purpose as ruin, I have BBQ already. I run discordance currently but with the add-on I should be able to use pop instead. For chase perk I use bamboozle because the faster vault is still effective in FF (minus pallet vaults) I will use pop, thank you for your contribution :)

Not being able to and refusing to waste my time are two very different matters.

I understood my thread fine. You just don't know how to use comparisons effectively unfortunately.

If you don't like that I ignored your negligible post because it was too long, learn to be concise. Your problem, not mine.

If you cancel Leatherface's chainsaw at max, you have like a 2-3 second fatigue in which you move slower and can't hit/interact, hence why I wasn't able to open the locker straight away

Omg I love cooking Dwight. The cosmetic name will be “Dining with Dwight”
---
wasn’t she a heroin addict? sorry it’s been forever since i’ve seen those movies
---
Didn’t get a gen done? I have to ask, did you pip or safety pip? If safety they must’ve been hook farming pretty bad
---
You bet you’re ass I’m gonna use that Strode Realty Key if I got it.
---
Hasn't happened yet. It will go live in a month or two
---
Nope
---
Time to run BT and DS again lol
---
I think it's more like he's saying, logically why wouldn't hooked survivors alert others that GF is nearby stalking.. not as a game balance mechanic, but as a flavor/lore topic
---
Not sure if you have read my other comments but my issue is how much time your wasting for very little pay off. 
---
&gt; Gaining stacks should be objective based, not run over to the guy who just got downed so i can take a hit while he's being carried and run away and hide and heal. That entire process just sounds ridiculous to me 
---
&gt; ideally you would love to get stacks without getting hooked. Worst case scenario (you take 3 hits and get hooked every time) it's a wasted perk slot. Best case scenario, you don't get hooked and wasted a bunch of time GOING OUT OF YOUR WAY to go take hits and wasting EVEN MORE time to heal 3 times. There's no good trade offs. Protection hits aren't very organic and aren't directly an 'objective' while unhooking people is. I think you should have to work for the perk, I DON'T think you should have to waste time to get the perk to work
---
What kind of bug are you experiencing? Also, what platform?

https://imgur.com/a/LabCgzO my pugapoo I got in April :) his name is Pugsley
---
Have fun, just please don't shove it down everyones throats
---
...I’ve been playing for a year and had no idea you could sabotage Trapper’s bear traps. I thought it was only hooks.
---
*laughs in nurse*
---
Jane is thicc tho, it literally is in the game
---
Seeds are the overall thing, you cannot find the same cave twice on the same seed. As in 2 individual caves in different locations on the same world.
---
But some Killers main said on Reddit that BHVR was afraid to make strong killers! :/
---
Glad the changes were made, feels like he's going to be super fun to play as and to play against! Currently in the PTB he was just boring for both parties.
---
It's an error, idk why I said bug. It gives me an error code when I load the game up on my account, but any other account works fine. Xbox
---
Alright, I just wanted to check
---
Honestly Ghostface has some core issues with his baseline design that I think will hamper him overall (namely how dumb his "counterplay" is and how easy it is to counter him with Spine Chill / Object of Obsession.) That being said a lot of the changes (ESPECIALLY the fact that the stalk bar doesn't passively decrease anymore) really increases Ghostface's viability in my eyes. He seems like a lot more fair and a lot better designed Myers now. No offence to Mikey but quite honestly he's way too strong with the ability to just stare at a Rank 20 Default Dwight and then instadown the Rank 1 P3 Claudette for zero effort. I think Ghostface has strengths and weaknesses when compared to Michael and I'm interested to see how he turns out.
---
My investment in Ghostface has gone from "never going to buy because I'll regret this more than Freddy" to "I'll see what the community thinks after a week or two."
---
His perks are still fucking godawful though. Lower Terror Radius while in a chase l u l. Reveal Survivors who sprint through windows outside of a chase l u l.
---
Will do kind sir!
---
I'd say he is better than alright he is quite good and experienced with every killer no noed crutch.  I agree though Zubat is very good to watch also.
---
Sweet, welcome to the toxic community XD
---
I've been waiting for quite awhile as well. It sucks
---
Umm... *Intense knocking*
---
There are unreasonable people who will complain no matter what the devs do, but that doesn't mean that every complaint is unreasonable.
---
I think some people are upset that they released GF to the PTB with major issues that really should have been caught by internal QA.  Yes, the PTB is a step in the testing process, but it's not the *first* step.  The more polished the initial PTB release is, the better the chances of getting meaningful balance feedback.
---
I don't think we needed the PTB to determine that survivors kicking GF out of Night Shroud by spinning the camera is broken.  Had that not been an issue that drew everyone's attention and ire we could've found other, mure nuanced, balance issues that will now have to wait for future balance patches or will never be fixed at all.
---
The devs are not *bad* for releasing the PTB that way and don't deserve to be flamed or insulted, but the criticism is valid and there's nothing wrong with articulating that civilly.
---
Every killer will camp and tunnel somehow harder than normal, and every teammate will be dead before I can do 1 gen.
---
Every game will have a Mori, and a DC, every killer will have ruin and NOED. 
---
Every team I face will all rush and escape with fewer than 13k BP each and all using party streamers. 
---
Every lobby will close for some reason, and when they don't, the ping will be high.
---
Every farm match, the killer will single me out to be killed, because I'm "not farming" even though it's better to farm chases than to farm pallet stuns and 100 point gen kicks. 
---
Every BP event.
---
I lose my fucking mind.
---
This "feature" is also present on current PTB, 3.0.0 build.
---
I'm only annoyed that people have to mention that every single post Jane is in. It's boring and old.
---
Not at all. I'm currently at a wendys. Destroying all the bacon.
---
That's true
---
I just went to hook a downed Survivor in the basement (Since the gen they were working on was near it) and barely got upstairs when suddenly i got  3 of them swarming over to save the Feng that was on the hook. As You can imagine,i managed to injure everyone then and downed everyone After a while. Then i happily watched the entity take them from The basement
---
You can buy any individual character for 500 auric cells, my guess is that's the price of the chapter but translated to actual money
---
Oh ok, been trying to learn abt the game and any changes that have happened cuz I pretty much just started playing but I've watched some before
---
u/The-Red-Rum: *Posts this*
---
u/The-Red-Rum: Why do I hear boss music?
---
Does I'm All Ears still show the auras of rushed locker entry? I presume not?
---
Nothing confirmed just yet, but as you said, it's got the same amount of content as the Leatherface DLC (Killer + 3 Perks). So I'd say it's going to have the same price ($4.99).
---
Took me a while to realize that too
---
Well I've played him on the PTB today and he's still not buffed enough. He's at Wraith/Leatherface level at best. Survivors still can see him at spots where he can't see them, he's map dependent as hell, his sounds still give him away, and hooked/downed survivors can STILL take away his power (he's the only killer with this UTTERLY RIDICULOUS counter - wtf what you thinking BVHR?).
---
Your worry that he'll be Nurse level was unfounded. There is no equal to a good Nurse in this game, and no killer with the dog-dumb weakness of having his power taken away from him if a survivor looks him for 1.5 seconds could EVER be compared to the Nurse. And Legion, even before his "rework" was no where close her any top tier or mid tier killer. He was always low tier, and still is low tier. He's a walking meme, and no one takes him serious nor fear him.
---
The Nurse is the standard for what every killer should be in any good asymmetrical game - where the power role has the actual power in the game (imagine that - a killer who is not at the mercy of survivors but instead puts fear into them), has a high skill cap, has a great base power, and depending on his/her own skill can defeat anyone and doesn't need overpowered addons to do it. That's how all killers should be in this game. But there are only two killers even close that and that's Spirit and Billy. All other killers are at the mercy of decent survivors and good addons/decent maps.
---
And the EGC is full of survivor buffs. All killers got was the ability to close the hatch... meanwhile the last survivor get to get the hatch even if ZERO gens are completed (utterly ridiculous again), and even if the killer closes the hatch both exit gates are powered leaving the killer to have to patrol two gets mostly on opposite sites of the map while the survivor can hide then open the gate with no problem. But hey, at leas there is a countdown right? A countdown that slows down when someone gets downed or hooked to 3 damn minutes. Imagine that - the killer gets punished for downing and hooking someone in the EGC. Do the survivors get punished for rescuing someone in the EGC? Nope, of course not. But killers get punished for doing THEIR job. Sounds fair.
---
Not to mention the Pig nerfs and the basement nerf in that shit-sandwich of a midseason patch. Do I need to go even further back to the Legion nerfs? The thana nerf? That some killer obsession perks were screwed up and haven't been fixed yet? Or the killer sounds being fucked with and not being fixed yet?
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/43561/trapper-is-still-garbage/ He has a lot of problems but having 3 counter perks is just icing on the shit cake that assures that if he ever becomes popular people will just hard counter him.
---
I think you misread it. Now it takes place WITHIN 48 meters. Meaning that when you are in a chase and someone faults a window, you will see their aura
---
&gt;  Nice melee hacks bud
---
....what?
---
It's almost like being able to completely remove a Killer's power with a completely random perk that isn't even baseline makes absolutely no sense and should be removed.
---
Seriously though the icon for Sabo is a broken bear trap how did you not realize you could sabo bear traps?
---
P.S. Hangman's Trick also makes Bear Traps regenerate faster after being saboed because reason.
---
Thank God. I was almost about to lose all hope
---
Someone last night accused me of hacking my range of melee hits with the wraith. I’m like, buddy, I just bought this game last week I have no idea what you’re talking about
---
is this photoshopped? please don't tell me they really made this mistake lmao
---
It should. It says "any Rushed Action."
---
i feel like it's hilarious that you searched through his cosmetics to see what the other nipple looked like
---
Is it live now?
---
Only if they rework some of the maps, like Haddonfield (more like Hadnofun). It’s terribly survivor sided.
---
Ugh, at least I'm not the only one. 40 minutes here, still no match. I remember the other PTBs were much better in terms of matchmaking.
---
You can rotate your survivor in the lobby now. They forgot that part
---
This is important, okay? Someone has to do the dirty work here. Just staying true to Flair
---
*crouches in a corner the whole match*
---
We dont know everything about it yet as it's a unfinished project, but currently he can teleport to gens, puts people in his terror radius to sleep over time like doc with madness, make dream pallets like docs fake pallets and make slowing snares to catch survivors.
---
Literally what's your point? What's your limit? 3 buttons, 4 buttons, is 5 buttons too many? Stop settling for mediocre in your life and strive to be better. If we all had your attitude then nothing in this world would improve.
---
Ahh the classic sex dungeon potato farm :,)
---
Only issue is that killer gets 1 vote vs 4 people each getting a vote
---
If you think I could, I would be complaining? Nah man, I ain't getting a 2000 dollar computer AND getting a router because of this. Shouldn't these communities be equal or is it just little kids being tryhards on console ruining it?
---
I find it weird when people complain about children in games when we all grew up playing games like GTA SA, Resident Evil etc. Just ignore them.
---
You can sabo traps with a plain toolbox too IIRC
---
😜 You caught me
---
lmao I love it because i specifically use the hallowed body for the nipple
---
If a few sentences are too long for you, then you must really struggle in life.
---
It is also ironic that you say my post was too long.  You original post was even longer! Ironically, you are making fun of your own post since by your own standards it must be WAYYYY too long.  Why should I not be concise if you are not concise???
---
You seem to not even understand your own post
---
yes
---
Why would there be. It begins on Tuesday
---
Oh fuck, you can’t see his nipple on PS4 because the quality is so crap... may have to switch to PC now
---
XD ,Yeah. Honestly Thinking they were probably a SWF group that got bored.
---
If people are dcing and stuff I can understand why, but I was playing pig against a 4 man swf with no ruin, wasnt playing in a toxic way and got a 2 man and this Claudette who I didn't even see all game sent this message, it's a bit funny and ironic.
---
Sure everyones excited about Ghostface but I'm so disappointed they're going through with MoM on just protection hits. I hate how fickle the protection hit detection is. Hell I would have preferred 3 safe unhooks over 3 protection hits.
---
Probably the latter ngl
---
Don't even need a 2k dollar pc get a 700 dollar one that will go for atleast 3 years. 
---
There are cunts everywhere but console has its own idiots
---
Disturbed Ward is the worst map for totem spawns. A full garden with anything in the middle lol.
---
Thank god lmao as funny as this would be, a bug like that is inexcusable lol
---
edit: nice photoshop lmao nice enough for me to believe it at least lol
---
But if you're in a locker your aura is hidden, does it activate the perk and not show aura? Currently travelling so I wont be able to test this
---
I just guess the addition of voice chat makes everything thing worse, I think it’s a great idea to make sure kids don’t get online access for games until a mature age where they don’t embarrass themselves. For everyone’s sake. Although I respect your opinion
---
EDIT: mature age = 13 1/2 imo, at that point your foolishness is on yourself
---
I do that that anyways when I play pig
---
Lmaooo nice one nea got got
---
I just wanna say, i mainly play ps4 but i have it on pc and it's amazingly better. Everything runs faster, prettier, smoother, loads faster. shits nuts....on pc just so ya know lol
---
It is on the first line of the changes
---
More powerful than the entity
---
Oh okay then that makes sense. If you have it at max can you wait and use your chainsaw whenever you want? Because that's what it sounds like.
---
O U T P L A Y E D
---
Why even go out of your way to message him?
---
Totally, makes sense, but wouldnt the scarcity of some addons mean that it wouldnt happen to often that youd get 4 of a kind? Good point though for sure.
---
Most of the time the PTBs also have 3 new survivor perks to test out which gives at least a bit more incentive to go in as survivor. Right now everyone just wants to play Ghostface
---
I'm not sure how they'll make survivor heads 360 to follow the camera but I feel like this is all I'd see
---
Also thanks! Feel free to check my post history I got a pretty good Jane shoop when she came out 🤣
---
Wouldn't the rank reset put you in the same level with people who were already in your rank range before the reset, since it affects everyone?
---
Maybe because the survivors were close together the hit boxes shrink? ( did I get that right or misinterpreted the patch notes?)
---
I would usually be the middle one running towards the mori survivor to get a good picture.
---
The issue has always been soloqueue not having a realistic chance to take out the dulls.  That works fine for SWF.  But crutched out noed gamers will get their mindless proc pretty much every game against randos.
---
Didn't you hear? MoM is only going to work on protection hits. After they announced the change, they went back at it and will be changing it to protection hits!!! Pretty sure it was in the last dev stream.
---
I grew up with violence in my video games thanks to my uncle and I wasn't a piece of shit to strangers when I was a kid. Parents today don't know how to raise their kids to respect others is all it is. Ignore those brats. I come across a young child every now and then with a potty mouth but I just think to myself what piece of shit parents do they have and I thank my mother for teaching me right from wrong.
---
I hate this meme and I hate people who keep saying this as if contradicts The idea of people complaining AT ALL, YES it's a test, then we give FEEDBACK, then they CHANGE STUFF.
---
That's a good point, I didn't even consider that we don't have a survivor this time around.
---
Hatch opens with 1 survivor left, even at 5 gens.
---
I guess I just don't understand the format for this meme
---
The hair changes were in the previous version updated to the PTB (and this one as well, of course), unless you're referring to something more specific.
---
When did this happen?
---
Hatch is killer sided now. To minimize it, it spawns with one survivor left regardless of gen count.
---
I always wonder if scooby doo was the first people that adopted ghostface in a cartoon.
---
Since the end game collapse patch, no matter how many gems are complete, it could be no gens, if there is only one person alive the hatch will spawn.
---
But there are no objectives for survivors outside of doing gens. BHVR seems to feel survivors are all 10 year olds who can't handle 2 or 3 objectives that each contribute to powering the gates and escaping. Many people who suggested secondary objectives and they've been ignored each and every time.
---
Unhooking another survivor isn't a requirement for escaping, it's just a way to get more points. So since doing gens is the only objective what do you propose? Taking a hit to protect someone doing gens? Taking a hit while on a gen yourself? I wouldn't mind the latter so much cause at least it's different.
---
Which chicken farm were you on?
---
Only the best
---
I would suck that nipple every time he wants daddy
---
and via the gate too with the new endgame collapse
---
Wow, shirtless Myers? Groundbreaking, bet nobody else thought of that before.
---
I’m sad.
---
You have to put the hens back in the coop first.
---
Argargarg-
---
*ENTITY DISPLEASED*
---
I’m unhappy.
---
Haha wow, that's a new hack-usation for me!!  Some people will go to crazy lengths to rationalize losing.  Points for imagination though!
---
I love you for finding this.
---
I dodge, because those guys who have names like that are gonna quit after being hit twice.
---
Shiiiiit I forgot.
---
Unrelent... HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Unrelenting and remember me are trash-tier perks. Rarely will you have a game where you can utilize RM to full stacks. It use to be good before egc nerfed it, but now it isn't. Unrelenting... I don't know how you think it's OP. It isn't machine gun anymore.
---
I want to switch to mode mode.
---
&gt;When did this happen?
---
When they added the ability to close the hatch and end game collapse.
---
I feel you friend
---
You get 150k BP at max. While for survivor you get about 100k-150k at max when streamers and cake/pudding is up. It's by preference honestly.
---
No the message before that was from a few months ago when he sent me another a**hole message
---
Michael's head could take it no longer. He had survived gunshots, being burnt alive, and being exposed to conditions no man could possibly live through. 
---
But these fucking survivors, man
---
You're not kidding when you say you're new, keep practicing
---
*Heavy breathing*
---
Since you're just jumping into killer, I'd highly suggest you go for Mikey and Pig, as Huntress has a bit of a learning curve, and Nurse even more so.
---
For Mike and Mandy, perk setups for M1 killers will do. Enduring+spirit fury will work wonders, as well as perks that proc on-hit; sloppy butcher, stbfl, remember me, etc. However, put some points into nurse to get nurses calling as a teachable, it'll work good for mikey and works even better on mandy as she can go into stealth and sneak up on those that try to heal.
---
Edit: missed a word, thx mobile
---
Billy is the easiest start with the highest potential, obvs learning nurse should be a goal of yours. You're going to want to get cannibal for barbeque, though. Hag has hex ruin and devour hope, doctor has monitor and abuse and overcharge. Nurse and billy also have great learnables. 
---
I've seen overcharge do well with nurse, and ruin and devour are good on anyone. Monitor and abuse works well for killers with already small terror radiuses like meyers and hag.
---
If you like playing around the obsession, meyers' perks are also good, but not as meta. Those are my recommendations.
---
it's not that serious. 
---
also you were comparing pressing TWO (2) BUTTONS to finding a pencil and paper and writing that shit down. one takes minimal effort, the other doesn't. lmao.
---
I’m sorry you had the privilege to know someone that substance abused and was perfectly capable of recovering ( assuming why you are taking it so deep on Reddit) but there is like someone else mentioned already... a Opioid crisis here in the states, a lot of addicts that take it for actual medical conditions sometimes have to seek treatment that is 3-6 hours away from their home on the East Coast because of all the hurricane seasons and flooding.
---
I never thought about that. The Plague map has like 6 lockers lined up on one side of the map. It would be put to good use.
---
He definitely is. Especially with his insane addons, best in the business. Kill healthy players, see through walls. That’s pretty insane..
---
What rank, add ons, perks, etc? Also, some people also consider Billy to be tier 1.
---
End game collapse patch causes the hatch to spawn on last survivor no matter what.
---
new mobile port looking good.
---
Before this update, nobody knew about OoO or its adorable abbreviation.  Now its inescapable.
---
Killer: Hag.
---
Because it seems more depressing.
---
They couldnt make it 2 protection hits? Damn. It needed some kind of nerf but jeez this is overkill.
---
It would be interesting to see survivors not being able to 360 view anymore. Much more horror survival based and you'd have to be more vigilant.
---
What’s the collapse thing is that the bar that goes over head and like starts to time down
---
Honestly, any rank, almost* any add-ons, Perks being BBQ, Nurses calling, Ruin, and Iron Grasp. Seems to get me 4k's every game
---
i just want some more fashion
---
i'm new to the game. what is Mori'ing?
---
He's just so easy to use. And there's so many different playstyles per map depending on what add-ons you're using
---
I thought you were talking about the fiery explosion to your right
---
I agree, I love what the devs are doing with this (because it's very important for ghost face and Myers) but I feel like there is gonna be some weird stuff going on
---
There’s definitely a pretty noticeable difference, though some maps don’t have a lot of misty areas. For example I think Gideon only has mist on the bottom floor.
---
You can close it.
---
CAN WE PLEASE FIX THE FUCKING GLITCH THAT PREVENTS ANY PROGRESS WHEN REPAIRING/HEALING AND PREVENTS YOU FROM WAKING SOMEONE UP?
---
JUST PLAYED A GAME WHERE I INITIATED THREE (3!) SEPARATE TIMES TO FINISH A GEN THAT WAS 95% DONE. ALL 3 ATTEMPTS GAVE ME NO PROGRESS AND GUESS WHAT, BY THEN BILLY WAS RIGHT ON MY ASS.
---
WHAT A CROCK OF SHIT GLITCH. IT LITERALLY PREVENTS US FROM DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO PLAY THE GAME. HOLY SHITTY QUALITY ASSURANCE BATMAN!
---
Unrelenting allows you to reswing when you the killer fuck up and remember me allows the gates to take longer to open and if you got enough stacks and close the hatch it’s over for the survivor and I never said the perks were op so don’t put fucking words in my mouth I said it was a second chance perks
---
It makes a difference for everyone, but it does max out. Also it's worse on some maps rather than others. It's super noticeable on Haddonfield and the other town map. Likewise for someone like trapper or hag, pi and now maybe even ghost face, it can be a buff for killers also
---
The only myers I like to play is tombstone myers. Just stalk them the entire game with Play with your food, then finish them all off once you finally got tier 3.
---
I would give a medal if I had coins, this is very true and I agree. Although I wonder if it is entirety the parents faults, kids are naive and listen to a lot, they could be taking example from people they have voice-chatted in the past and think that toxicity is the norm, Although I wouldn’t know right now. 
---
This comment made me think a little more, thanks for the smart comment and helped me realize that the people around the kid affects what he determines right and wrong is.
---
Got a match. It crashed and killed my pc from working
---
yes , i think they saw that she got so much potential so they removed the snapping trap when out of the gate
---
The big bad wolf
---
He’s definitely a strong Killer but he’s not Nurse tier at all.
---
If you are new to killer then I would suggest Myers or Pig. 
---
Pig has her traps to help slow down the game and has the basic stats as every other killer meaning she serves as a good baseline to practice chasing survivors and mind-gaming pallet loops. 
---
Myers is a much better killer than Pig due to his instant-down power and small terror radius. If you want to practice chasing with a much more stronger killer then Myers will be your best option. You can also practice slugging with him as his tier 3 gives him amazing snowball potential. 
---
Nurse and Huntress have large learning curves which might dissuade you from playing killer. they are really interesting to play and can be a lot of fun if you master their powers. You will have to commit some time to playing these killers to learn and adapt to their playstyles.
---
 - If you decide to play Pig then she will work with most perks. Current meta build for killer is; BBQ, Ruin, Enduring &amp; Spirit Fury as it helps alot for ending loops quicker and can burn pallets fast. 
---
- Make your choice and Surveillance both work well with her. Make your choice encourages you to return to the hook after a save has been made while Surveillance works well with your crouch ability and gives you an idea on what gens to apply presure to.
---
- Myers is similar to pig in that he works with most perks. 
---
- Monitor &amp; Abuse is an amazing perk for Myers as it basically removes his terror radius in tier 2 EW. This allows him to become a stealth killer and can allow him to easily get hits. 
---
- A popular build is; Ruin, Sloppy, Nurses &amp; Monitor. This allows you to find survivors who are healing easily and sneak up on them. 
---
- Huntress works well with Nurses calling, BBQ, Whispers &amp; ruin. 
---
- Nurses can allow her to snipe survivors who are healing. Same with BBQ for giving you an idea on where survivors are traveling. Many builds exist for Huntress but Nurses works really well on her.
---
- Nurse does best with perks that allow her to find survivors easy. 
---
- BBQ is amazing on her due to the ability to travel really fast. 
---
- Nurses calling works quite well for finding survivors. Helps with sugging survivors. 
---
- Make Your Choice works really well with her as it can easily net a down for her.
---
- Surveillance works aswell as survivors are likely to be playing immersed as to avoid you so tracking is key.
---
You took this down a very close minded alley my friend. This discussion isn't about other objectives. 
---
As for "unhooking is only for points and not an objective". The objective can't be completed if there's no one to do the objective. If no one ever saved, objective would never be completed. so as far as i can see, unhooking is an objective. Next, you seem to think that my arguement is that mettle MUST be objective based. Not what I'm saying, what i'm saying is you shouldn't have to be the opposite of productive to get it to activate. The thought of sprinting to a person every time they get downed just to take a hit is the stupidest shit i've ever heard. it doesn't even fit a playstyle. It's literally just, go be stupid and waste time a couple times and we'll let you take ONE extra hit. Here's a quote of mine from a different comment. I think it explains this new mettle pretty well:
---
&gt; Mettle might as well be a damn killer perk at this point.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;"Hey come let me hit you so you can run away and waste time healing. And then do that 3 times. I know i may have to hit you one extra time after that but at least i get to see your aura at all times after you heal"
---
Yeah I just use that for fun. It's hard to pull off anything more than killing 2 at a time with that build
---
They have already said the locker auras are getting fixed, I wouldn’t get used to the bbq hiding anymore with GF next week
---
No no no. He's better
---
I mean.  You're 100% wrong and you're not fact checking, just echo boxing other people's words.  Or you're willfully ignoring the fact that they update PTBs because 'game devs dont listen lolol'
---
MY MAN!
---
[Feng is someone who likes to focus in on what shes focusing on, demonstrating extreme focus.](https://i.redd.it/v4appfza9ty11.png)
---
You can catch some survivors up there if you're a stealth killer, or sometimes the survivors will potato out and you can just walk under the porch and they insta jump off
---
By the time i do that, then figure out my reply, theyve already left.  Too much time wasted
---
Once I was game map with that build. Literally all 4 of them was in the bathroom. Interesting game.
---
WE RISK SWINGING THROUGH PALLETS, AND SOMETIMES IT PAYS OFF OKAY?!
---
It's an action that let's the killer kill a survivor without having to hook them. It's usually enabled by a Memento Mori offering, but can also be enabled by perks like Devour Hope or Rankor. They usually have really cool animations that are fun to watch.
---
for real? i thought that was an insta-kill
---
For sure, crazy lunge, good vault times, on console he's the best killer hands down
---
&gt;fixed
---
Oh God... this was a bug... and we still wont be able to see auras from inside the locker?
---
Likely the same time on the 18th, which is 2:30 EST.
---
Lmao that sounds like a fun time😂 Whenever I use it I ALWAYS land on Coldwind or Ormond
---
That is exactly what I meant. Thanks!
---
Did the number of pallets get increased in PTB? Feels like every single loop has one. Makes balance terrible imo.
---
GF changes are awesome though.
---
LMAO
---
Yeah i see what you mean but coordinated swf would always get their way. It's a very rng based system regardless of swf. Idk interesting idea tho :)
---
DONT BE MEAN TO WRAITH, HE NEEDS A BUFF IN MY OPINION! DONT HURT ME PLEASE
---
What?  What sort of response even is that?
---
it was, but then they nerfed her in PTB and people hated it so they reversed some changes but not all
---
... That has absolutely zero to do with anything in my comment.
---
Not to mention that new players shouldn't (and pretty much can't) "adapt" to being put with higher ranked players. You're trying to justify a problem that shouldn't exist. The ranking system is there partly to separate people, anyway.
---
Well it's weird because survivors heads already turn when they look sooo idk maybe it's just a bit more obvious now? and i will :D
---
*honk honk*
---
Nurse: “Get in, loser! We’re going killing!”
---
Not you.
---
The only thing that truly upsets me is the hit box.
---
If someone commented it out of the blue, you would be right. However, it's completely in context to say it here, particularly as a joke in response to a meme.
---
Boi what are you on about.
---
They were very obviously not going to leave ghostface as is.  He was bugged and underpowered, regardless of what the community says, the bugs at least were going to get fixed.
---
They don't turn backwards and they don't turn when you're on a gen or cleansing. When you're chasing a survivor you can't tell if they're looking back at you or forward
---
Oh okay.
---
I'm a trapper main so I love Haddonfield :p
---
lol. I actually saw some dad on the internet trying to get the devs to change this addon to something else because he said it was inappropriate for his son. 
---
Violent deaths and big-chested girls with jiggle physics are alright (not to mention Jane’s thiccness) but porn is where he draws the line.
---
Came here for this comment
---
WHO SHOULD BE THE FIRST THEN? DONT GET ANGRY, JUST BE BETTER
---
You can tell in a chase, they turn their heads and upper torsos I. The direction they look. 
---
They never did it when interacting though, and I believe that's what's been updated.
---
Just close it lol
---
I didn't make you read my original post but I do agree that mine was far more worth the read than yours. 
---
I don't have trouble reading a few sentences, but reading something when there's no merit to it at all just seems like such a waste of time.
---
ahhh that makes sense so now the heads do turn when on gens?
---
It was tongue in cheek, and it clearly went way over your head. Your argument was stupid, like I said - what's your limit? Maybe you'd rather the devs not patch the game at all? Because you only have to do SOMETHING to work around it. Like I said, stupid. (lmao)
---
Does when does the hatch appear on the map but not open?
---
I think the whole concept of MoM was stupid from the get go, even though an entire perk is lost, honestly, I'm glad, I never want to experience it again. Though disappointed they couldn't change the effects and it's upsides instead of the conditions, but that's bhvr for you.
---
Seems like they could have made it 2 protection hits. 3 is too much.
---
Wow such skill &gt;_&gt;
---
All this over a fictional character lmfao
---
No he's smiling because unlike those other two, he hasn't been hooked yet
---
"And today we'll be tackling one of the most requested recepies, Pizzawhat's pizza recepie, a dish that in my days of minimum wage had the pleasure of delivering more than enjoying"
---
But the baby dwight was hiding in it...
---
Wow what an awesome video. Thanks for sharing!
---
That's the story of my friend with me, i think it's a phase cuz i am not toxic anymore
---
Look up "I'm hooked and I'm bleeding" it's a song someone made for dbd
---
Yeahh i think they were just trying to fill the old DS void of survivors having a 2nd chance perk. I mean i like the idea of working to enable being able to take an extra hit. Tbh i never had bad experiences against MoM but i know it needed to be changed for a lot of reasons. But i think safe unhooks should work for this perk
---
I have seen left and right but never behind lol
---
Baby dwight got pebbled then
---
As an example case: Let's say that you're green ranks (which is what I would say the deepest rank where being bad at chases is acceptable) you will need a total of 7 emblem points to safety pip.
---
You claim that you never ever got found, so that gives you a guaranteed iridescent unbroken which is 4 emblem points. You now only need 3 emblem points to safety pip.
---
The first of those 3 points you already get for free, because benevolent already starts out on bronze. The only way that you can lose that is by having two people put on hook while you did absolutely no altruism.
---
Repairing even one single generator gives you silver lightbringer. You now have your 7 points and get your safety pip.
---
Keep in mind also that I'm not even touching on the possible evader medals that you can get from stealth, because getting bronze stealth is also super easy.
---
If somebody doesn't get a single second of chase time in and they still couldn't even manage to repair a single generator then they deserve a depip. I agree with the developers on that. If you make it out alive but can't even manage a safety pip then you got carried and deserve to be at a lower rank.
---
A purple offering is the max. you can have in a game. Standard mist is 25%, with the purple one it's 100%.
---
Drop down from somewhere when getting chased and there you go. You just used balanced landing. There really isn’t much depth to it trust me, use it during a chase to get to safety of a pallet or window.
---
Dead hard is the only exhaustion perk that requires a bit of skill to use efficently but that is a whole different subject.
---
Is that Amanda Bynes?
---
People are afraid or rank 9s? Damn
---
Yo this guy trying to show his friend the meme and yall downvote him
---
*ABSOLUTELY ORGASMIC*
---
exactly
---
^ lmao, that’s reddit for you
---
Exactly!!! Rank reset just hit and I don’t care so we gonna get some BP people! Those who wanna have a regular OP add ons, facecamped, and tunneled to death game can exit to the left....
---
Mhanz
---
We survivors seee eeeverythiiiiing......
---
So play...nice.
---
While players who where at a similar level to you will be deranked along with you, most players return to their old ranks rather quickly. Also there is only 20 ranks in the game so alot of players after the rank reset end up in the 15-20 range regardless of skill.
---
boink
---
Did they send salty messages afterwards blaming you for camping etc even though it's clearly their fault.
---
Put a pic of the avatar used, cosmetics and all next tot he name.  
---
They can remake the end game screen to accommodate this, it hasn't changed since launch I think.
---
Omg i remember the first time i play killer, was with my friends that show me this game, i was playing myers and i put the red addons (tombstone xd) and i didn't knew nothing about the game and they started to looping me and then they 99% all the gens and then pop all at the same time, but i mori one (i put red mori too xd) and i was like "what just happened?" Was so funny cuz they are the 'toxic swf group' but thanks to them i am now main billy and nurse as killer, and i am pretty good as survivor.
---
Me and Amanda would never do that to the Oinkers. We prefer the Venus Fly trap way less of a mess.
---
This is my exact face when it works
---
Huntress and hag are also top tier and pretty fun.
---
I'm talking about generating two different worlds and them being the same
---
Nice my dude i am new with around close to 200 hours and still can't figure out the chainsaw
---
FUCK IT I KNOW IM A DAY LATE BUT I WAS BUSY YESTERDAY SO FUCK OFF. WHY THE HELL IS THIS GOD DAMN GAME SO UNSTABLE, I CANT GO 3 MATCHES WITHOUT CRASHING ITS FUCKING BULLSHIT. IDK IF ITS JUST ME OR BEHAVIOR BEING A SHITTY DEV COMPANY BUT FUCKS SAKE.
---
Give me that shit
---
I'm not complaining, it's just funny how an immersed Claudette who did gens all game says stuff like that...
---
This gives me some bloodborne Boss vibes. 10/10 -IGN
---
Make the mask a bit more covered with blood then we Gucci
---
It's really interesting. I never realized there was an intersection between horror and the gay community until DbD.
---
I hide in really I conventional places and and pretty good at mind gaming and disappearing. I like using stealth because the prospect of getting caught ramps up my adrenaline!
---
Doctor is still a BP generating machine. If you have Legion, he generates BP pretty quickly also.
---
For the memes, or maybe they need some salt for the fries
---
Imagine this: You lost your job, your wife cheated on you and are in the hospital because of a car accident. I would rather be that guy than a fucking face camper. There is seriously no reason to other than EGC being active.
---
Is this up on Xbox? And ps?
---
Ah I see the huntress Buffs looks bloddy amazing
---
Going out of your way to activate the perk shouldn't be what you aim for but more so play out the game naturally is what I think.
---
Cringe
---
I am just gonna saw it. Saw has some perfect locations to turn into maps for DBD the nerve gas house is 1000% one of them. It has a lot of rooms, cool traps around and it is epic. IIf BHVR ever wanted to do extra maps then this is the one.
---
God this is too relatable
---
I really wish there was some kind of in game mentoring system. I main hag and it drives me up the wall to play as survivor against her with people who don't have any idea what to do.
---
Ye can blood have him! next time you make a threat take something valueble, like poor Baby Dwights.
---
I’ve only been playing around 10 hours, after my first game I realised that as long as you don’t collide with anything, the chainsaw sprint can go on forever. You can rev the bar to keep it close to activating the sprint so that you can time it’s activation when you’re ready to strike properly, but the turning is really slow so you need to make sure you have a relatively direct path to your target. If they can make a sharp turn, you’re left very vulnerable and they have a large window of time to escape. I got kind of lucky here - I knew she had fled to the trees after she got out of the locker, I was trying to make her panic by keeping the chainsaw raised and let her think she was getting distance between us by the noise being further away, but I was watching her movements and saw a glimpse through the trees, picked my moment and bam! 
---
The chainsaw will swing automatically when you collide with a survivor, so you only need to worry about holding the power button down, and keeping your trajectory true!
---
Is this the Nintendo switch gameplay footage?
---
He looks like *he* ran into *you*
---
I'll stop shaming it when you stop encouraging it. 
---
It's cause and effect. Multiple survivors are going to the hook because the killer camps it. Usually one goes to unhook while the others do gens. Then if that survivor gets chased someone else goes and unhooks. But because of the camp that first survivor gets away and no unhook. Where as if you'd just chase that first survivor they would be hooked. And maybe one gen would be done and you have two survivors already hooked once. That sounds like a better strategy to me. But like I said play how you want. Just doesn't sound fun to me. And definitely isn't fun for the one survivor who is gonna get 2000 bp because they got hit twice sometimes only once.
---
I let a group or survivors win a game, I didn’t even try smacking them when I was close to them. I would even just stand and watch from a. Close distance sometimes, I just felt like being nice. Afterwards I got messages saying trash or get good, just a bunch of toxic messages and I was like wth! Lol dbd community really just enjoys talking smack so it’s not a big deal it’s just the way it goes
---
Look, I am a bad guy. But that goes to far even for me.
---
You should! You won't get any better if you aren't drawing! :)
---
it's two buttons
---
Mad cuz I wont play the game the way you would like?
---
Because some people just want a kill thats about
---
Then off into the distance behind the tractor, a Nurse is chasing down the Meg with those BP raining on her.   
---
Too be honest it's going to be fun tomorrow. Can't wait to get 2-3 of my Killers to P3 and probably max 1 of my survivors with every perk.
---
Mist used to be thick as shit and really cool looking. Not so much anymore.
---
I suppose because its relaxing for the killer and gets them salt.
---
Some people just like to receive angry responses from players who are annoyed about being camped. Similar to survivors who deliberately grief other survivors or who insult the killer post-game chat. 
---
Some people enjoy it because its more relaxing than playing normally. Although they effectively throw the game and will depip because of it, it removes the stresses of having to deal with pallet looping and time management as your only goal is to stand in front of a survivor. They just want to sit back and relax while guaranteeing one killer.
---
Oh god I could Grind some cheese on those abs.....

DAMMIT!!!
---
That trapper did a good job, he managed to get her in 1 go, usually it takes 2 swings to reach the survivor when I do it
---
Thanks.
---
This getting out of hand I will take it down if that's your wish.
---
RIP. Sorry to hear that it crashed for you after all that wait. I gave up trying to get into a match myself: 90 minutes, not a single lobby.
---
This is pretty cool too be honest wow. I mean the scarecrow skin is creepy but this, yea this is taking it to the next level.
---
She's not even ugly
---
Yes, yes you are
---
I definitely can, and I love hag, but I can only submit one entry for the contest, unfortunately. If there was no limit, I'd make designs for all the killers!
---
When I'm a survivor I'll leave for another lobby, when I'm killer I'll call their bluff. If they DC I'll usually play the match straight up, I feel like their teammates knew the risk when they readied up with some one like that.
---
Wow. This feels more "Wraith" than any of the wraith skins we currently have.  It's the skin our Bing Bong Boi deserves. Incredible job!
---
Bing bong for life
---
I haven’t played in a long time so I don’t know what bbq is. I’ll try and level up today. Is trapper any good?
---
Saw 2 was a good movie but almost EVERY death exept for Xavier and the opening were so easy to avoid: Don't look in the hole, check the stairs for traps, don't fight, inspect the trap, don't put your hands in, dont just sit down!
---
Safe until a killer works his way around back, forces you off the edge, and then goomba stomps you into the sidewalk.
---
Is bbq a perk? I haven’t played in ages so I have no idea. I only have the starter killers and the nurse
---
This doesn't help me figure it out. Too vague. 7/10 too much water.
---
Killers shouldn't keep their addons. Survivors also have to use up their items for their high impact tools like instaheals and keys. Ultrarares and even a few very rares are too powerful to be used multiple times.
---
Thank you! 
---
Wraith was my first killer and still my favorite, both mechanically and aesthetically. I always wanted him to be much spoopier!
---
PS4 here, after i finished my last game i struggled to connect to a new one so i reopened the application and now i can't get in because of connection errors.
---
Not to be that person but... You know... I still will...
---
Using "gay" as an insult feels very dated and not super appropriate during pride month.
---
I think PSN is down.
---
That's true, however, it could be that they are only calling it a "Chapter", because it pretty much overwrites a normal scheduled chapter release (Killer + Survivor + Map every 3 months). Ash was released outside of the schedule and in Leatherface's case there wasn't any schedule at all when he was released. I could be wrong of course, we will have to see.
---
In addition to Hamertoss’s explanation, if you ever want explanation on player-jargon and whatnot, there’s a link on the sidebar on the far right of the page to “Glossary of Common Terms”. Dead by Daylight has a LOT of slang and abbreviations so that page helps when you hear about “looping an LF that found you because TotH and getting away because of DH with the help of your SWF”
---
Yup, can't get on. Was just gonna hop on for the first time today too
---
Wasn't directed toward you.
---
Yeah they have a ton of game references, this has been posted before btw
---
Man I gotta practice this
---
Oh yeah, horror and the LGBT community are really intertwined a lot of the time interestingly enough. I’ve never met a fellow gay who hasn’t enjoyed horror to at least some degree, and a huge part of the horror community are either very supportive or part of the LGBT community itself. It’s nice though, knowing that for the most part, my favorite genre is welcoming 😂
---
I think is saw somewhere it’s starting 2pm est
---
IMO respecting pallets is only bad if you do it unnecessarily. If you can potentially get a hit by eating the pallet, you should go for it. If you respected a pallet when they weren't going to throw it, that's a mistake. But if you correctly dodge a stun, that's just good prediction and you've saved yourself time in a chase.
---
There is no such thing as genrushing. It's literally the only thing survivors can do. If the survivors aren't being chased, or going for saves that means the killer isn't applying enough pressure.
---
I'm gonna be honest I could write a whole essay on this topic.
---
hell yeah
---
I agree 100% and I’m sorry that you’re being downvoted to hell by the “oinkers”
---

---
*edit: just want to point out that maybe "balancing noed" doesnt need to be on the meme only because its debatable on whether it needs any changes or not.
---
Today I had two salt mails in 5 games : « Nice tunnel gimp » and « Reported you for bug use ». And 3 disconnects I think. It’s often the Dead Hard, MoM tryhards Meg with purple flashlight that send those too, pretty ironic. 
---
I play pretty normally, no camp or whatever. I take the salt mails as bonus points now, it’s when you really stomp them and the mail is the reward lol
---
Anyway don’t mind those messages or just switch off the option for people to message you if it’s too bothering.
---
Yup, BBQ and Chilli. Its one of leatherfaces teachable perks. Each time u hook a survivor you gain a bonus 25% bp up to a maximum of 50/75/100% depending on what level it is. It also shows all survivors auras that are further than 40 meters from you when you hook someone.
---
I dont even play Wraith but that design is fire
---
Sad. Still would love seeing hag in your vision
---
That eye in the middle of his chest is very neat
---
Is that suggestion for a description? If so, I dig it. Simple and to the point. XD
---
If you aren't planning on buying the dlcs then perhaps you should buy them but otherwise no. Dance with me is fun for builds but it's not really good. Tenacity is good combined with unbreakable but unbreakable alone does the job. Mad grit is super situational and remember me is crap after it's nerf
---
A little bit to the left of Ash on the ground
---
Ladies and gentlemen....
---
That's subjective.
---
A lot of people don't consider them top tier.
---
And even then: Hag was shit until they gave her and trapper the buffs.
---
Fun and interactive gaming experience
---
M’Myers :p
---
No but it could cause i’m a wraith main and probably would buy the shit out of this
---
If this post gets enough traction, I'd definitely submit more stuff just for fun/exposure. :]  I have ideas for Hag, Clown, Nurse, etc.  I decided to go with Wraith for my submission just because he's bae.
---
Awwww, you no like da bing-bong?
---
Imagine white knighting stupid things.
---
That’s a good idea!
---
Hey, great move! I can see you pulling off some REALLY impressive plays with Billy once you put more time into the game. You're doing the Entity proud!
---
This, and that some parents use video games to parent/distract/occupy their kids for them.
---
Thanks! I imagine he has to be able to see somehow with all that cloth on his face :P
---
Daaaaaaaaaaamn!!!!!! I LOVE this!!!!!!!
---
YOU'RE cringy.
---
:'(
---
I can definitely see this in the game
---
Holy shit this is incredible work.
---
Yup, level 35
---
At least you can even get into a game.
---
Dude I love this totem spot in general. Yeah it sucks to get as killer, and a blessing for survivors, but this totem spot is so laughably bad that I just fucking love it
---
imagine playing the killer and walking to a gen and then you see this. that’s what makes this game a horror game
---
very fun and interactive

Not really but kinda? Like it still has a rough charge up time without add-ons but the couple second fatigue isn't all that awful. So like you can't hold the chainsaw charge (iirc) but you can put it away a lot easier than Hillbilly.

Can't see anything online anywhere except for maybe 3 tweets
---
Honestly I don't find Freddy's daily's that hard because you literally just get them by playing Freddy. Getting Dream Chaser becomes a million times easier with Pill Bottle, and chases are already incredibly long because it's freddy.
---
^smacks ^lips trapper never looked so fine 😋
---
only tells me theirs no internet connection when starting it up, probably just server issues
---
If you’re in the UK or Europe psn is down  :(
---
Scratch Mirror Shirtless Myers is another good one if you are good with him. I normally get 31,000 BP plus the 4 stacks of bbq-chili and bps or survivor pudding and can get 60-80k each match
---
It’s even safer if you have Balanced Landing.
---
Sigh, was about to rack up some points I'll keep an eye on their Twitter page
---
Hex:Ruin, Barbecue and Chilli, A Nurse's Calling and Whispers are pretty standard on Huntress.
---
Sloppy Butcher, Bitter Murmur, Discordance, Agitation, Iron Maiden and Shadowborn are also good perks for her tho.
---
Yeah its really bad for some reason.
---
Didn't even know that was a thing until now. Thank you for giving it more popularity.
---
Mmm tbh I think the safest generator is in the house of pain.
---
XD but honestly i’d give up my hollowed blight wraith cosmetic for this
---
Dbd is at its best when it’s new survivors against new killers. It’s so cute yet honest. Welcome to dbd
---
* Made Nea 100% more terrifying
---
 This update "Survivors will now turn their heads where their camera is looking. This happens when a Survivor interacts with an object in the environment and when they are not downed or incapacitated." Feels like there's going to be some strange interactions is going to happen where you see the survivors head turn to a 180 degree angle while working on a totem like you see in those Horror Movies. We shall see.
---
Google Amanda Young.
---
It’s started at 3pm last time on the east coast when they said it would start at 8pm est
---
PGTW is gettin buffed, so i'd say it has 2 good perks
---
I did those things you did at 9 and also watched horror movies so I’d probably play this as well. Now the mom letting her kid swear, over the internet to another stranger is sad and disappointing. Different strokes different folks.
---
Oh no not the Stun VFX.
---
That doesn't look very safe
---
The PS4 services are down, you can check them in your settings and see for yourself.
---
The only acceptable huntress bug was when she was released and a generator explosion went off if she hit someone with a hatchet
---
What changes did they made?
---
I think their severs are going wonky.
---
Rancor and literally ignore them the entire match. I do it all the time as [One Punch Freddy](https://youtu.be/qDQulmpFYnI). (Freddy with Save The Best For Last, Play With Your Food, Monitor and Abuse, and Rancor. Ignore the obsession. Sleep him so the chase starts for PWYF, but don't hit him. Hit everyone else for max save the best for last stacks, then once gens are done instadown and mori the obsession if you can find him.)
---
Since they go straight from Healthy to Dying, they don't get any chance from Mettle Of Man (Not like it has any stacks since you never hit them until now) and there's no Borrowed time. Rancor lets you both instadown and then Mori the obsession, so he goes from Hero to Absolute Zero without any chance for an instaheal or rescue. 
---
Call me twisted but I love this build and I get real giddy when an Ash Williams is in my lobby because I can show the survivor just how much their "Tank Build" (Dead Hard, MoM, Instaheal, Adrenaline) actually protects them if the killer specifically builds to counter it.
---
I mean, they don't reward Survivors who rush gens?
---
At best you can get Iridescent in Lightbringer but then everything else suffers.  If you don't interact with the Killer at all you'll get little/no boldness nor the emblem that requires you to evade the Killer.  If you don't go for altruism plays then you miss out on another emblem.  Etc.
---
It might work at low ranks but not at the higher ones.
---
Now we just need Stripper Myers then he shall live.
---
Doing gens, you ?
---
Yep I'm getting the same error code as well feller.
---
So I was playing a match and this happened! the killer happened to be in the my friends list thought, I told him WTF and he replied saying that he couldn't hook me nor dropping me! even with the endgame collapse! he finally DC'd and the curse was lifted...
---

---
I do think the best way to reward Survivors with more BP is through perks, not a blanket increase. As many people have pointed out, the grind is much more significant for Killers, not to mention the need to incentivize more players to play Killer so we have enough lobbies.   
---
I'd like to see more BP perks like WGLF that reward different things, like long chases, objective completion, etc. That way you use the perk slot specifically for BP and the game encourages greater variety of playstyles.

Does double bloodpoints hit at 12AM on June 14th, or do I have to wait until the middle of the day?
---
Orphan of Kos vibe 😍
---
Damn. My killers are all low level since I mostly played survivor.
---
season 1 is mad trash, you’re in for a treat with season 2 and 3. season 3 really ramps up everything to 11
---
These are good changes hopefully he gets add ons that are very useful
---
It's fun. But the only huge negative factors I will say is most of the player base influencing you in a bad way that you kinda need to away from the toxicity. It's going to happen but the game is still fun regardless.
---
Gives me box cutter flashbacks
---
I should try that. Gotta give spirit like 5 more levels to get that, though. I basically got her hex and spirit fury then ignored her.

Does this start at 12am on June 14th?

The part where Ghostface throws the money is the playerbase throwing the money to buying Ghostface.
---
He is pretty good right now. You actually have to look straight at him now and him being able to remove the red stain and terror radius without crouching is scary.
---
Sounds like a Nero’s day at Disneyland song
---
They don't turn their head all the way around but you can still tell when they are looking behind them
---
Zzzboo
---
Wonder if he'll get an Op ebony add on that let's him see the aura of survivors with No drawback
---
It would be a different story if the Legion was a trap if you look closely onto Myers it's already too late for him.
---
Good drawing though I like it.
---
He seems better than Myers.
---
No spirit fury :( or I’m not sure if I have it
---
I’m pretty sure active RBT still go off if you run through the gate. You need to already have the trap on before the last gen pops for it to activate though.
---
Amazing, can't wait to be spooked by him at The Game

Rancor is simply amazing for utility. Not always in-match utility but long term gameplay. Got a Mori daily but don't have any Mori's on them? If you have Rancor you can just chase the obsession for 5 gens, then insta-down and mori to get your daily done. It's stupid as hell of a strat but then again so are Mori dailies.
---
then spirit fury activates
---
This, to me, is the number one issue with Ghostface. His power design is not well served by the majority of the maps in the game thus far. There are some hide and go seek maps he could do well in, but most maps are Coldwind, Autohaven, and McMillan, all of which are quite open and hard to hide in.
---
Actually no Hoffman Set her up to betray Jigsaw because she was there with the guy who killed Kramer’s baby but she didn’t say anything or wanted him to figure out but Hoffman knew. So he wrote her a note saying kill this person or I will tell Kramer which eventually led to her Death.
---
For once, Nea looks pretty.
---
No one: waiting at hatch as third survivor is mori'd
---
Me: running to watch trapper's muscles ripple during the mori
---
Theyre down :( and so are apex legends as well. Welp guess I'll just die then. (PS4)
---
your mom must hate you
---
Why did you DC though ?
---
Brown shirt/pants Claudette with no glasses
---
Shape. Exe has stopped working
---
I kinda lost some hope being that usually newly released killers wouldn't get a big of a buff like what Ghostface got because usually they buff them overtime but this was the first time I have ever witness a decent change onto a Killer in the PTB before a released.
---
that would destroy a lot of looping capabilities survivors have. Knowing to look behind you and only looking forward is a drastic difference.
---
The curse of DBD bugs.
---
Pretty good job
---
Has a blood hunt been announced?
---
Yeah he just got a bunch of buffs today.
---
I’ve got em all except adept nurse. Just. Can’t.
---
Been posted before just saying. Still makes me cringe when they dropped god pallet so fast
---
Reminds me of Silver Chariot Requiem
---
r/woooosh
---
9/10 that one survivor is probably thinking your hacking.
---
i would say no. it doesn't take that long to search a chest.
---
I know this whole thing is a meme but it's not the first strawpoll so: Do people really take these seriously? With 20k players on average for steam alone and like 50 votes in a poll?
---
What’s the order you’re supposed to read it in? I can’t even tell.
---
Curiosity? With that logic, why does it even show you the killer's build at the end of the match in the first place? And yeah I have, I was just saying I'm unlucky and I would probably get pulled or something.
---
I think Thrilling Tremors on the right Killer and build is a superb perk. Not a meta required perk, but one of the stronger ones to come out for Killers in a while. It's not a great perk for Ghostface though. Feels like a generic perk they were prepared to release with whatever Killer.
---
Ignore them. I’m gonna play how I want, if they think having some sort of name like that makes them special, then they are special. Besides, I guarantee with a name like “Nurse=DC”, killers will intentionally play Nurse just to troll them.
---
Jake
---
Pretty sure you have a good tunnel vision when you cannot even see the name of the guy you injure in that chase for a splitsecond.
---
I got the internet connection is required message when I was in the main menu but other than that one time, I can play the game.

---
Ok sorry I just wondered if when ghost face comes to console on the 18th those will be in it . Should of been more specific .
---
I think it means servers are down, sadly
---
Had a feeling they were down. Hmm.
---
Then Brutal Strenght
---
Yes, during the 3-year anniversary stream a couple of weeks ago.
---
That would be a good idea honestly but usually sometimes it doesn't really take that long to change Perk builds because usually everyone memorizes what the pictures look like so they can just switch it in 5-10 sec but for newly players it would be better.
---
this isnt even a leak someone literally posted it yesterday.

[Here is the forum post](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/68436/night-stalker-wraith-design-based-on-the-works-of-beksinski)  
---
I've gotten WAY more exposure here so far than I have there. That place seems quite dead. If anybody here has an account there and wanted to support the design, please leave a post!
---
Wouldn't be out of place in Darkwood.
---
I mean what were they supposed to do?
---
The killer is just adding some love taps to the survivor before he leaves. Then comes back to add some more love.
---
&gt;killer mains cried and cried about MoM so they're gonna change it after it coming out 2 to 3 months ago..
---
You don't need to be a killer main or a survivor main or a person who plays both sides to know that MoM is one of the most stupid perks ever added into the game(it has such terrible design that it comes close to old legion). It makes the weak killers weaker and promotes playing Billy, who most of us are already sick of seeing all the time. It also promotes bad play and has absolutely no counterplay, hell at least old ds and noed have a little bit of counterplay to them. It's not even going to get hard-core nerfed, you can still get stacks by unhooking teammates, meaning that you can still get it unless they decide to not add that.
---
&gt;but not stupid hit boxes?
---
The devs themselves have said that hit boxes are due to latency. I agree that hit boxes are broken to some degree, but it's also largely due to latency and connection. They said that they are working on fixing the killer weapon boxes interaction with the survivor, and dedicated servers will hopefully fix latency and connectivity. 
---
&gt;Constant dcs?
---
Agreed. We're going to have to wait for dedicated servers so that they can monitor dcs better. For the time being we're unfortunately going to have to deal with it. 
---
&gt;The fact that exit doors spawn on the same wall?
---
I completely agree on this one. If you are the last survivor and the killer closes the hatch, you're most likely going to die.
---
&gt;FIX BLOODLUST(ITS NOT NEEDED)..
---
I'm sorry, but this is one of the silliest things I've ever heard. If you really want bloodlust to get removed, then the devs are going to have to completely rework every map in the game. God windows like the Ironworks of misery window, suffocation pit window and many more. Maps as a whole will also have to be reworked like Haddonfield, badham preschool and disturbed ward. Hell they'll even have to remove the stagger buff from balanced landing since it can open up many super insane loops. Removing bloodlust would make the game a mess. It's really annoying to get bloodlusted at a normal pallet loop and that's where there is an issue with it but otherwise it's needed. 
---
&gt;or the fact they have 2 killers in the game that are so over powered the nurse ignores all game mechanics , the fact that Billy has no cool downs and can constantly zip around the map
---
Hillbilly is overpowered, really? He can get looped, just like any other killer in the game. He does not break any mechanic of the game.
---
Whats funny is that is the one survivir that was giving me trouble all game. I'm a rank 15 killer he was rank 7 survivor. He kept 360ing me and insta unhooking people.
---
Then completes the the last gen that was left at 99% because they know it's going to be a 3 gen.
---
In fact that's what i'm talking about xd
---
Art is pretty good and it’s a funny comic. You are gonna want to do a more uniform order of panels though. Left to right, top to bottom is typical for English speaking audiences but even right to left, top to bottom is the manga style and people would still respect it
---
Getting adept achievments used to be easier if I recall correctly. I just hate that the achievment is linked to the pip system. A DC usually costs you your achievment.
---
Yea I can understand that.
---
To make sure they actually get a kill, I guess. Takes way too long though, no benefit.
---
THE MATH DON'T MATTER BECAUSE MR. TRAPPER WILL MAKE YOU LEARN TODAY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU WASTE TIME IN HIS CLASS
---
I have this with rainbox six: siege and security camera's, I feel like taking out a gun and shooting them
---
So like, would they die?
---
Time to go back to the PTB then.
---
Yep man your going to get reported from the other survivors for looking into those flames for 10 sec. Oh then there's Myers
---
That’s fucking rad I love it !
---
Hes gonna stick in shirtless davids butt
---
Agreed.
---
Wraith with purple Swift Hunt and Windstorm is seriously solid. Leatherface is in a fickle place since he does have that one down ability but it’s a pain to use in high ranks. A good Trapper is annoying and turns any survivor back into a Rank 20 in regards to trap paranoia.
---
Am killer main, can confirm
---
Can't wait for the framerate to drop all of a sudden when it happens.
---
When *Gens Done + Dead Survivors ≥ 5*
---
i think that Leatherface will take the shit cake in that regard, Trapper is close but at least he can sort of block off loops so a survivor either goes to the loop and dies or the survivor doesn't go to the loop and dies. Leatherface is only good when there's nothing but air in front of him, only then his chainsaw is good
---
I can relate being a Ash main.
---
Wazzzuuuup
---
Lmao I remember this show
---
You called?
---
The entity is telling you no, but your body is telling you Yes.
---
Unfortunately, Trapper. He needs a little more value with his Kit. How he is now is great and can be fun, but to be viable I feel like he needs abit of strength. 
---
Refilling traps similar to huntress would be a start. Start with 3 traps and you can refill 3. Can only place a total of 9. When a trap is triggered, it is destroyed. Just my opinion.
---
Now launching Owlneck.exe
---
HOLY SHIT THIS IS EVERYTHING 😍😍
---
He looks like a skinny version of the Pthumerian Watchers
---
Im aware of the r6 issues but they removed clash fast after the glitch was found yet there was expolits with legion that are still in the game if i believe r6 has its issues but they fix them fast
---
I love it!
---
This is a cool design. Would be scared if i was playing DBD and saw that come running at me
---
Turned messaging off on my PS4 last night. I've been playing for almost two years now and this is the first time I've done it. It's been so rough recently, almost 90% of games, win or lose, I've been getting shitty messages.
---
Legitimately scares me more than any of his other skins
---
Thank you so much!!!! I only just realized what this meant (Im new-ish to Reddit).
---
It was a kyf and I was a little done with the chainsaws not hitting because I wasn't the host.
---
i decided to cease everyones suffering by ending the match right there.
---
Sadly that's what it's suppose to happen. So that's why you need to drop the pallet early and not really try to time it as much otherwise your going to get hit. For windows that's a different story.
---
I wish I had a gold but that's all I have. I hope your cosmetic gets made its one of the best ones I've seen.
---
I swear Legion feels slower than other killers even though he now has 115% speed. Like he feels SLOWER than before the buff! Maybe it's his height but as Freddy I feel pretty fast.
---
Clown, I also feel slow as balls even though once again he has normal killer movement speed.
---
Because myers is our daddy
---
I think they said something about a certain portion of testers being on test servers but my memory fails me
---
This show was my childhood. I wanna be famous!
---
That's extremely high praise! :D Thank you.
---
Fair enough
---
Thanks! That was definitely what I was going for haha.
---
Would actually be scary, great job 👍
---
Yes of killer has high ping there’s a good chance there’ll be some lag. Same with survivors. Depending on where you play but on console if I remember correctly it’s like don’t play if they have either 250 or 300 ping. 
---
But computer is different and more of a preference. But remember don’t bitch about lag etc. if you saw the connection in the first place because it’s not the killers fault you stayed.
---
Very cool
---
HE’S SO OP 😭😭 
---
Kinda love it though
---
Totally forgot about that one. Still not sure where he fits in the meta tho
---
Of course, you deserve it. You did an extremely good job designing this.
---
so atm the killer is always the host. if the ping is hight, it means that this is your connection to the killer. you are the only one suffering from this ping because the killer is, as the host, completely unaffected.
---
I mean sure they do have to work harder, but the number of games I've played where the killer gets only 1 kill, sometimes none at all, and still gets more base bloodpoints than every survivor is kind or ridiculous to me.
---
Worse than the Pig, most defininately worse than Myers, around Leatherface/Wraith as far as rank. He's high low tier at worse, lower mid-tier at best.
---
Just saw one of these holes in Badham, it was great! :D we all had a blast with it......even though it was just a hole lol. I say leave them in.

If your banned there is really nothing else for you for you to do then to send a report to the Help desk. But in some cases if your banned they aren't going to lift it that easily. Also for steam users it's going to keep the VAC ban permanently.

I was playing with my friend then all of a sudden he got banned out of nowhere

I swear a long, LONG, LONG time ago (back in closed beta days?) I fell out of the map a few times. I think it'd either say Escaped or Dead.

So are you talking about pre buff GF or buffed GF. Because I heard Buffed Ghostface was actually pretty decent
---
And work on a generator without blowing it up at the same time?

She gets a special cutscene if all survivors escape where she commits Seppuku
---
I never play Wraith, but that is amazing.

But if he has hair we couldn't see his beautiful sixpack so

NO

I laughed for 20 minutes atleast

Thank you but I play on PlayStation 4

I would suggest Kate if you already have deliverance. I bought Adam the other day and felt like I was getting targeted because of deliverance. Even had a wraith face camp me waiting for me to use it.

Looks great!

But how would the bell look like?

If any of you have an account on the DBD forums, please give [my submission post] (https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/68436/night-stalker-wraith-design-based-on-the-works-of-beksinski) some love over there as well so the devs can see! 
---
Thank you all for the amazing words and support!
---
Holy crap that’s amazing. A really spooky vibe, would fit really well on the Wraith and a lot of effort has clearly went into this.
---
So a lot of people are pointing out that a lot of killers cost bloodpoints to play well, which is why they get more bloodpoints. As somebody who plays a lot of wraith, playing without windstorm and/or swift hunt can be kind of a bitch, so I definitely get it that argument.
---
However I would like to point out that most killers can still get only one kill, sometimes none at all, and still get more base points than every single survivor in the lobby, which does seem a bit ridiculous to me.
---
Killers definitely should make more bloodpoints than survivors in my opinion, but I think the current gap that we have between survivor bloodpoint gain vs that of killer is kind of ridiculous.
---
This post and thread are all cancer. Im saying this as a jojo fans

Why is Noed so powerful, anyways? I've seen the past versions and they seem powerful, but the current version only seems good by the time you've already lost.
---
I have to agree with you here, mainly because of the fact that protection hits are iffy. If protection hits were guaranteed to register, then yes this works perfectly, but as they are now, not so great.
---
Damn! Love those! 
---
Like the perfect length/format for their descriptions too. I think I may just use these! Thank you!

Nice clip. Survivors are scary ; ; . Keeps baby ghost face up at night

---
I like how i got downvoted, this is probably the most toxic subreddit of all time..
---
Ikr, the guy playing doesnt know shit about the game
---
Personal experience does not mean he is good.
---
So it's just the way the pc does it. And it's deffo just lack of survs to killer ratio
---
I mean, we can all get to one same conclusion:
---
He is way better now then when he was first released on PTB xd
---
No, I was following that. Legion got a small lunge buff, but that was never the issue. The issue was Frank's. And Anti-Stab Wound Study. The builds that sprung forth (Thanatophobia, Stridor, Bloodhound) and cheap strategies that were revealed (Abusing chase mechanics to keep the DW timer going down even if you're still actively chasing them. Moonwalking as well.) aided in this as well. People also felt it took "no skill" to land Frenzy strikes because Legion had multiple chances to hit them before the stun kicked in.
---
Legion didn't get many buffs, players just discovered how to abuse what Legion already had. Some used those strategies, I always preferred to play Legion they were meant to be played and spread damage. I always loved sprinting around, I felt so fast whenever I was in Frenzy. The rush of speed was what made people love Legion.
---
That metal tube gives me major giger impressions
---
played about 15-killer &amp; 10-survivor games today, not a single one has ended without at lest one survivor being a cunt at the end.   
---
this community is the absolute worst.
---
$1200 OSHA fine
---
I feel this is sarcasm but if it isn't how does that make him good just because you killed everyone? I can 4k as Freddy and that doesn't make him good. Plus PTB matches aren't as serious as in the actual game as everyone is doing generators and trying to win. Until I get to play as him I'm going to assume he is around low tier or see gameplay of him.
---
I know and it is so anoying.
---
Did u check for Mikey, Ghostface, Pig or Wraith? No heartbeat means it's one of them. Careful next time u go there. That pallet will be your savior.

First of all, Welcome to the fog!  
---
Really smart of you to use the map to your advantage with you watching the survivor through the cracks on the wall to predict their next move. A killer with a good map knowledge is really scary to fight against.

I think they would probably make so you can't trigger it in a Chase to balance it out and not give GF a easy instadown but who knows they could change alot of things on his release.

---
You're ultimately right. But Survivors are, ultimately, the majority of the playerbase, they are considered more important as a result. And they keep the money flowing by buying cosmetics.
---
Devs have said fun is more important than balance. So, yeah. That's what their priorities are.
---
I'd love another viable Killer, as the ones currently have felt overbalanced (Legion before the cheap tactics were discovered, Plague) at their core.
---
No, they won't complain. They'll laugh at the easy BP. And they'll have fun because of the easy wins.
---
Easy to bully killers/Easy wins = Survivor fun = majority has fun = Survivors buy cosmetics and invest in the game = devs make money
---
Well keep doing it! I really love the design. Almost hopeful you’ll make more for the other killers
---
For real. Who am I supposed to kill now?
---
Boo.
---
awesome explanation. thanks for not BMing me for being new. I've seen that happen a few times, just didn't know it had it's own term

There are so many amazing skins fans are submitting I wish bhvr would just go and accept them all
---
Oh nice. Thank you, friend. that's very helpful
---
Nerf spirit: why? You know she can't see shit while phasing right? It's really easy to counter since the killer sounds are fucked up and can't hear survivors running/walking rn
---
Nerf nurse: maybe the add ons, that's it
---
Nerf Billy: hahah cute. Unless you're cornered he won't chainsaw you. Maybe with insta saw he can try something fancy but he get looped like everyone else. His advantage is just map control
---
Maybe buff the others to Billy level, not straight number buffs but actually making the maps more fair for both sides and every power be able to be used and played around in any situation. Be able to counter them as well as being an actual decent tool (pig's attackcoughcough)
---
So a question, I watch few streams for a bit, and ghostface it seems can just stalk while being in chase and being directly looked at, it doesn't kick him out of stalking mode. Is this a bug or a feature?
---
Yes Dwight is based off of Cote so the person who made this is uncultured
---
Legion used to be very suck, but now, it's easier to scape.
---
This is amazing!!!
---
fuck, you scared me
---
Took only 3 games last week for me to know he was trash in his debut. Played 8 games with him today thus far, will play more later this evening. Any Coldwind Farm map.. you can't see survivors through the corn but they can see you and take you out of stealth. Haddenfield? You won't be able to spot the survivors unless you get close enough and when you get close enough they hear your audio and run away or look at you. Backwater Swamp maps? Too open, not enough places to hide to get your stealth. Yamaoka Estate? Good luck getting close enough with all those hiding places. I haven't had other maps yet but I doubt they'll be better out of maybe the Crotus Asylum maps.
---
And I can't stress how utterly stupid it is for downed and hooked survivors to still take you out of your stealth which happens on all maps. You have to hide from not just the people you are stalking but anyone who is hooked and if you are on a map that doesn't have a lot of places that can shield you, you are going to be spotted by a hooked survivor and become just another M1 killer.
---
He's better than Freddy, Doctor, Legion, maybe Leatherface. That's it.
---
😭😭 error code 8012
---
I think now whenever you fall off the map it just teleports you back to a random position inside.
---
Nokk, wrong game, go back to the Rainbow HQ.
---
If i had gold you could fucking have it
---
Thought it was just me lol.
---
I'm a rank 13 killer, and a streamer (wont self plug) with a ttv name. I got bullied while streaming against a rank 7 and 6 who was playing with a rank 12 and 15. It's something I kind of expect at this point. What I didnt expect was for them to go into my stream and talk shit to me about how bad I did that game and told me I should stop streaming. How dare I try to enjoy this game or streaming I guess.
---
Glocktor
---
Same, none of that has anything to do with player skill.
---
Somebody is not very groovy!
---
How many marks did you get, can his power be used consistently multiple times in a match now?
---
Magical screenshot. I wholeheartedly approve.
---
He's still bad lol.
---
Sorry. Sometimes I forget the power of a properly placed "Boo".
---
I'll be more mindful of it in the future.
---
Same! I've seen a few that I would love to have, but having them would mean my own skin wasn't considered. I look forward to seeing what the devs pick, regardless :)
---
Yeppers - same here.

The only time I've ever used small game is when I first started playing and when I know that my friend's playing Trapper in KYF, and even then it's rare for me to use the perk.
---
You can stalk in a chase if the survivor runs in a line and never looks back to take away your shroud, but what survivor wouldn't look back at you for 1.5 seconds while running/looping you? Rank 15s? I'm a rank 1 killer and I don't get such silly survivors. Everyone knows that all you have to do is look at Ghostface and he's a M1 killer.
---
Ok so I played 3 matches with him,
---
2 of them were 4k's, the other 1 was 1/2k if im not wrong
---
What did I conclude:
---
 \- I can get more marks with him now (Like 10x times)
---
 \- Its way more stealthy than before, since u could just detect him with survivors 3rd view POV
---
 \- I used his power everytime I could, not like the other version.
---
 \- He is way funnier to play as, and even thought they say he's "OPAF", no, he is pretty balanced tbh, like I played survivors and it was just a match like the others.

BBQ is a Leatherface teachable perk.  If you hook everyone one time it giving you a 100% bonus to bloodpoints (essentially a free party streamer).  Also, when you hook someone it shows the auras of all the survivors who are far from the hook.  It’s a great perk.  Unlock it ASAP if you plan on sticking around for a while.
---
Trapper is an average killer, but trapping someone feels so rewarding.  If you play him, put a trap on the outside of shack window and one at the shack door with the pallet.  It’s a devasting setup at low ranks.  As a bonus, the basement sometimes spawns in the shack.  Once you figure out survivors patterns/habits and map control he is very strong ranks 10-20.
---
Hillbilly is probably the best killer across all platforms (outside of high rank PC nurses).  He can one shot, but more inportantly he can fly across the map.  
---
The huntress is A tier if you a master the hatchet.  The spirit is up there as well once you learn her ability.  Both require skill, but reward skill.
---
Doc is solid and arguably the best BP killer.
---
Myers is solid once you get to tier 2.  Use the doctors reachable perk “monitor and abuse” with Myers.  They can’t hear you coming.
---
Wraith can get steamrolled by a decent squad but it’s fun sneaking up on low rank survivors.
---
Freddy is strong against rank 12-20, but very weak at high ranks.  
---
Pig is decent at slowing the game down with her reverse bee traps.
---
Leatherface has solid teachable perks.  His one shot is easy to use if you catch a survivor out of position.  (He also has secret masks you can unlock)
---
I personally don’t enjoy clown.  He feels underwhelming to me.
---
I haven’t played with the plague, but I think she’s solid.
---
He's definitely better than he was.
---
The current PTB match searching time is pretty bad but trust me, its worth it.
---
Real shit.
---
BUT THE EGC ISN'T SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE LAST SURVIVOR, THE DOOR SPAWNS WERE THE SAME BEFORE EGC. EGC IS SO SURVIVORS CAN'T HOLD THE GAME HOSTAGE JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN'T ESCAPE. FIND THE HATCH BEFORE THE KILLER DOES OR BRING A KEY
---
No effort no opinion.
---
Not if its chest hair, silly goose!
---
Not OP, but not bad ma'man, just a good killer.
---
:D
---
I've been sitting here for am entire half hour searching for a fucking match. I might decide to just buy Ghostface and play him on the live servers.
---
I’ve had dirt. I don’t like dirt. It tastes like dirt!
---
I've been playing for over a year and have no idea lol.  I'll be following this lol
---
I answered him, but what I can also say is that something I do like about him is that he has good mindgame capability in the right circumstance/on the right map. And with Monitor and Abuse, if a hooked survivor cannot spot you, he can sneak up on people for some gen grabs.
---
I've seen some people here saying he's still weak... we will see in a while. Maybe I'm wrong.
---
I need to check if there is actually a nipple.
---
His fourth reddit birthday
---
Yeah. :/
---
Only thing I wouldn't give up is Hex: Ruin. I'm terrible at Hag so I went through hell to get it
---
While I fucking hate it as a survivor tunneling and camping are legit strats for their end goal. 
---
The toxic shit comes up when you have say a Pig that knocks down the entirety of your party and uses the reverse bear trap without hooking anyone to draw the inevitable loss out. 
---
Had that happen one time and was the last to get caught. She picked me up and ran me all the way to the hatch just to close it and then hook me.
---
The enduring change is a massive yikes from me, enduring was a great way to actually be a force in the chase as m1 killers, since the multiple ways they can easily be stunned is always painful to experience.
---
Ok retard. You dont deserve the word buddy before it.
---
Disclaimer: It’s too early to say. I haven’t even gotten to play him, 
---
But my current thoughts on him are:
---
He seems fun to play as and against. He’s definitely a noob stomper, but the only thing he can do to avoid being an M1 killer against god-level always aware survivors is the instadown exploit I previously mentioned.
---
💯
---
In the official forums one of the devs said that isn't a bug :/ , and is working well
---
&gt;And LMAO, I play on console. I'd honestly never like to deal with Billy and that saw + saw hitbox which ACTUALLY has zero counterplay without a pallet or vault. (People also still give up when going up against Legion by the way. XD)
---
Lol you're a bad survivor just by saying that. No matter how much you play, if you complain about hotbox when you don't even know what are you talking about it's hilarious! That hotbox issue you say are just animation+latency problem, don't just say hotbox when you don't know what they are. The hotboxes are fine
---
&gt;I'm also pretty darn sure, with months of experience on this game and hitting rank 1 as Killer multiple times under old system, I feel I know what I'm talking about...
---
With the previous quote I mentioned it actually doesn't mean anything. Ghostface would be at best under huntress in regards of power. They didn't even mentioned if the hooked survivor can still take him out of the power as it was previously. 
---
You'll still be able to see him and run while starring at him like you do with Myers with the difference he can't stalk in that case.
---
His picking ability is worthless since they can see his toe and trigger the mechanic instead, as I suggested, have to look at the mask (so when also he's able to see you) instead of any part of the body.
---
Even if for some miracle he's able to see you and stalk you enough you'll be able to run to the closest loop like everyone else, Billy included. So no, those buffs are not too much and actually should've been since the first ptb during the internal test team (which I think doesn't exist at this point) since the problem he had and still has would come up just in seconds while testing it!
---
&gt;Freddy, according to Tru3... nobody complained about him on the PTB. But when he went live, everyone immediately started complaining and he was swiftly nerfed to what he currently is now.
---
Yeah because exist people like you who thinks that Billy cannot be looped or played against using silly excuses. Survivors, or at least, the ones who mostly play that role and never or rarely use killer are bad players in general. To use an internet slang, casuals. The game was always been balanced around bad players, even now even they are doing some slight changes about that they keep trying to make bad players feel good. Guess who's the majority of them? Welp the ones who has a bigger number, from a marketing prospective I can't blame them but I actually can if I put any other big game that started with competitiveness in mind, for example Riot Games, small indie that created a game from a WoW mod now it's a several billions dollars company
---
Guess what, even there casual players exist but still balanced towards pro plays. I wonder why it's so famous and rich now mmh
---
In conclusion, before speaking about stuff you don't know you should look it up first
---
Is it still balanced when the survivors keep throwing themselves at you?
---
I added your descriptions to the forum post. Thank you so much! Glad that my design could inspire you to come up with them!!
---
A hex is a killer perk that is tied to a totem
---
Totems are those little skull things on the ground. 
---
If they have a lit candle in them then a perk is tied to it, breaking the totem deactivates the perk.
---
So basically as a killer you're gambling that your slightly stronger hex perk won't be disabled by a random survivor finding the totem it's tied to.
---
Patience is key my friend, after you try him (If you decide to wait) and after the match you get annoyed by matchmaking, just switch to live servers, besides, live servers are gonna have 2x BP tomorrow :D
---
[O, it's just you](https://i.imgur.com/5863VAy.jpg)
---
Oh my god that is absolutely divine
---
Let's hope you win! This Wraith is one of my favorite designs so far!
---
&gt;You can stalk in a chase if the survivor runs in a line and never looks back to take away your shroud
---
Nope, you get the stalk off basically no matter what they do lol. The buffer time is too high.
---
Because from the perspective of the survivor the only tool youre given to combat a spirit is prediction. The spirit has scratch marks, grass movement, the sound of grass moving, the sound of footsteps, the sound of breathing, and grunts of pain all in her favor and if a good spirit can utilize these the survivors cant do much of anything. If you can break los against a nurse she only has prediction, same as you.
---
It’s because he’s into nipple play and BDSM, but one fateful night he took it too far. Now the only thing left to remind him of his missing nipple is the scar in its place. Truly a sad story, but definitely an educational one.
---
Hey, that gives me an idea! A Divine cosmetic for Clown would be perfect! Imagine how gorgeous he would be with that hair.
---
Well, it'd be interesting to test it out nevertheless less. Maybe you should give it a shot!
---
ty babe
---
During the PTB, and especially in this situation, *everybody* is playing Killer. So there are probably just as many people on as normal, it's just that nobody is on as Survivor.
---
I'm gonna run Ruin, PGTW/Thrilling Tremors, Surveillance and Nurse's.
---
Adding to this comment.
---
Five Totems spawn in every game regardless if the has or doesn't have a Hex perk. Destroying the totem is basically an optional objective. Good player will destroy the totem for two reasons: Bloodpoints and removing the end game perk "Hex: No One Escapes Death"
---
yes please
---
I wish it wasn't a 360 view. Fucking survivors watch us killers like airborne hawks.
---
To be fair it could be unrelated, he’s kind of popular outside the DBD community too
---
What if you stalk in less than 1 second increments?
---
I'm ghostface...
---
Ok.
---
badham rework lookin good
---
Did you... did you think I shopped AWAY his only nipple?
---
I might be a Killer main, but I'm not a monster
---
I’m calling the police
---
Who's laughing now?
---
Billy is a good starting point. Best piece of advice I can offer as a long-time Billy main is to use your saw as often as you can. Downing a survivor with a saw saves maybe 15-45 seconds and every time you down a survivor you get a better feel for how the saw works.
---
Also, Hex: Ruin and BBQ &amp; Chili are the best Hillbilly perks in the game. Billy's power doesn't help very much when you're getting looped during a chase, so every second you can save starting a chase after hooking, and every second you can keep survivors off gens looking for the hex totem is invaluable. Good luck
---
His movespeed is slowed when stalking. The power also has a 30 second CD when broken.
---
Downes and hooked suviviors don't cancel it
---
Trapper, easily. Survivors can completely negate his power.
---
So he's good against people just messing around but he is just a M1 killer against people that are trying to win plus doesn't that mean once they find out who you are you are basically screwed because they will just keep trying to look at you to counter your ability? Sounds like Freddy 2.0 just better at noob stomping. But we could be completely wrong as they just released the patch today plus they could change him quite a bit on release.
---
Every map has five dull totems that don't do anything by themselves.  Using a Hex perk will cause one of those totems (two if it's Hex: Haunted Ground) to become hex totems, which will give the killer a passive effect described by the perk until defused. The game will let you know if you're currently being affected by a Hex by showing a totem icon on the far right.
---
Hex: No One Escapes Death is the one Hex perk that activates at the end of the game rather than from the start (and it lets the killer down people in one hit), so that's an incentive to defuse dull totems. If there's none left at the end of the game, NOED fizzes and nothing happens.
---
Now you're thinking with portals.
---
IF THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE COUGH YOUR SPELLED IT HORRIBLY WRONG
---
This post is late by a few months now. Legion was annoying
---
Oh i got it off the shrine and never used it
---
Yeah. I'll probably just switch back and play Bloodborne on my PS4 or something....Holy shit. I just got a lobby.
---
\*Hey sisters\*
---
Surveillance is an obvious winner for sure. I think Make Your Choice has potential as well
---
It's pretty good. In higher ranks it's not all that great, but I use it in my Billy build
---
*She, but otherwise, yeah that's pretty much it.
---
I AM SORRY THAT I'M NOT A NATIVE, ALSO &lt;3
---
The internet is a strange place with strange people.
---
The real question is where did his other nipple go? Hopefully the archives go into this very important bit of lore.
---
Downed and hooked suviviors don't take him out of his power though. I tested it. All killers are map dependent
---
Is it actually? I know it’s slowed when crouching but it seems the same when stalking during the gameplay I’ve seen. I wasn’t talking about getting the power broken.
---
So every perk will be connected to a totem?
---
So he is kinda like huntress because depending on circumstances he can be pretty good or just actually Trash. Also once they know it's a Ghostface you are less likely to get your ability off which sucks they'll also be more weary because they wouldn't want to get one shotted. Kinda like Huntress in some aspects which is interesting
---
Every Hex perk
---
Even after the changes? Why?
---
That was, without question, the best thing I've seen all day.
---
Only lit totems
---
I'm one of those who can't swing the camera around well due to being an uncoordinated fuck, so it wouldn't affect me but I can understand others who are used to it.
---
Not every Perk, only Hex Perks! That would be Perks that have Hex at the beginning of their names, such as Hex: Devour Hope or Hex: Ruin. A normal Killer Perk such as Distressing has nothing to do with Totems.
---
real life is the trial now
---
Survivors earn Adrenaline by completing objectives.  Killers "earn" NOED by failing to protect their objectives.  People really need to stop comparing Adrenaline with that crutch.
---
Hex perks have the strongest effects possible on game with NOED being the strongest.  Them being tied to a totem doesn't make them the weakest perks in the game.
---
Your claim that a single survivor is as strong as a killer is absolutely absurd.  You're a terrible killer if you actually believe that.  That is a personal problem of you believe that with a straight face.
---
Killers claim they want gens to pop slower.  A totem counter would do that.  It would encourage survivors to look for dulls instead of genrushing.  SWF already have totem counters anyways.  This just makes solo queue have a chance at cleansing the 5.  Killers just say jUsT cLeAnZe LuL!  They claim totems are objectives yet they want them untrackable.  That makes them not an objective as every other one in game is tracked for both sides.  You cannot have it both ways.
---
You know you have solid points? I replied the same way (kind of) but people still won't open Google and at least look it up 
---
My source? The actual patches through the entire DbD history. I've seen 1/15 that were buffs to killers.
---
Some stuff were shit for survivors side too, like the removal of being able to stun/flashlight save at any time or vault changes because they are lazy to do an actual decent map design. with a good design those changes would've not been released at all
---
I could speak about the killer FoV or the killer sounds that are always fucked and even now you can't hear shit if somebody are next to you. I still remember when they had too priority the sounds for survivors and low priority when killer had sounds issues (like now.. again).
---
GF will be under Huntress level at best since his power get countered by looking at him and not, silly idea I thought for like 10s, look at his mask to trigger the mechanic so he also will be able to see! Instead let's take a survivor perk, pig and Myers mix it up and make a shitty killer
---
SORRY THAT SOME PERKS LIKE MOM AND BT ARE THE BIGGEST CRUTCHES EVER AND THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT USE THEM ARE SHIT SURVIVORS THAT CANT LOOP THE KILLER FOR SHIT SO THEY RELY ON OP PERKS TO SAVE THEM
---
Why people are putting him so high ?
---
He doesn't have map pressure or an anti loop power.
---
He seems really map dependant ( good luck trying to sneak up on people on open maps like Autohaven Wreckers, Crotus Prenn Asylum or R
---
legion literally has no ability after getting that one hit In IF they get that hit let's not forget that legions power now depletes and stuns himself for 4(!!!) second vault speed Is an absolute joke and Is more helpful for the survivor than legion cuz they'll just hop back and run to the next corner while legion Is still In his horribly slow vaulting speed.
---
and let's not forget that all of legions addons suck now their best addon Is the purple one that reduces their stun by 0.6 sec... wow compare that to other purple addons for killers and let's not forget that the only perks that synergizes with the legion are trash (thanatophobia, hex third seal) and please stop acting like mending effects anything It's a way for survs to get some extra bp that's all It does now you will never ever down somebody with It and If you think that mending slows down the game then you are one of those people that say thanatophobia Is a good perk because gens need 5 sec more to pop
---
Legion might be a threat In trash ranks but red ranks he Is a joke I was fine with him pre ''rework'' now they are a joke with barely any powers, trash addons and no perks synergy
---
this is 1000 percent gonna win
---
I don’t know man Stu and Jane are my favorite Ghsotfaces
---
The day I can T-bag a killer as sheriff hopper is the day I can die happy
---
Not every perk requires a totem, if none of the totems have a candle on it is because the killer doesn't have any perk thats need a totem
---
He looks like he’s a Cthulhu spawn. This freaking awesome dude
---
They buffed I'm All Ears to work within the Killers terror radius. I am shocked that BHVR actually might have just made a good killer perk. 
---
The only hope now is that Thrilling &amp; Furtive receive some more love.
---
Watched it and it was actually pretty good, I liked it. Might try and keep up by watching his other videos now.
---
If someone is performing rushed actions inside your terror radius I feel like that makes the Perk inconsequential. I mean, you’ll already have a rough idea of where they are, and assuming they’re running they’re also leaving scratch marks, so it just seems like a waste to me
---
DAMN!! A Killer design that finally looks scary!
---
I love this!! So wicked!
---
Are you alive?
---
Yeah, I have the same thoughts. I'm concerned he's going to become a glorified scratch mirror Myers where in some Maps he will work great but on others like the Red Forest, he is entirely Screwed.
---
Could be lag on the killers side too. Since the killer hosts the game it can get kinda ridiculous sometimes. Dedicated servers soon should help with that
---
Certain killer perks are Hex Perks. 
---
Each map has 5 dull totems placed in them when the match starts. (Their locations are psuedo-random IIRC. Like there might be 20 pre-determined spots but 5 of them will have totems)
---
If the killer is running a Hex, the dull totem becomes lit. If survivors cleanse a lit totem, the perk deactivates. 
---
While most hex perks are easy to explain and work in a conventional manner there are a few unconventional hex perks that work differently.
---
Hex: No One Escapes Death (AKA NOED) doesn't do anything or show as visible until the generators or done or the hatch is shut. Once that happens one dull totem becomes lit, and NOED activates (Killer does one hit downs, etc.) If all 5 dull totems are destroyed NOED won't activate, and just like any other hex you can find the NOED totem (One random dull totem becomes lit) and destroy it to shut NOED off.
---
Hex: Haunted Grounds is another oddball. Instead of one Hex totem two totems appear lit, and it acts as a trap totem where destroying one of the lit totems makes the other turn dull and makes the entire team one-hit-downable for a bit. Usually you run it with other Hex's so it's a gamble for the survivors (and the killer) if they cleanse Ruin or end up activating Haunted Grounds instead. I hardly use Ruin and usually use Haunted Grounds by itself because in my experience survivors can't resist cleansing a lit totem. (Even if they're not affected by any other Hex perks)
---
Hex: Thrill Of The Hunt is designed to be ran with other Hex perks, and notifies the killer if someone is touching a lit totem. I personally don't like it because the notification is a generic explosion. As a Doctor main it's impossible to distinguish the notification compared to all the screams, failed skill checks, generators blowing up, fast vaults, etc.  
---
Thrill Of The Hunt also slows down totem cleansing progress for each totem remaining on the map, although this slow is removed instantly if Thrill Of The Hunt happens to get cleansed.
---
Yeah basicly the solo experience unless you get the retardet map of lerys 99% of time swf or not noed will activate if equipped
---
I only call lerys retardet due to many rooms just being copy paste onto each other and no real way to find a gen.
---
I love tapping that Kate and Feng Ming ass, though I tried tapping that Jane's ass and broke my hand.
---
I hope so!!
---
I will never rake surveillance off of my Spirit.  It’s too good and I’m always keeping pressure.
---
Thank you! "Scary" is certainly what I wanted to portray here.
---
Imagine rewarding players for trying hard and wanting to rank up.
---
People still hate him
---
Well I had two teammates dc last night after they saw susie which is why I asked.
---
That’s legitimately terrifying!  Excellent job!  I love how one shoulder is protruding above the other, really fits like the mangled theme of killers.  The snaking thing in his abdomen is also quite a good touch!  Love the weapon too!
---
Wraith he is before rework freddy but a bit better
---
Idk why peoples say trapper and bubba
---
Trapper is ok killer
---
And bubba have free 1hit down and its always good
---
You're free to your opinion of course but I think 3 safe unhooks is harder than (if hit detection worked right) 3 protection hits. 
---
On top of difficulty, being safe unhooks would globally limit MoM to 2 activations per match with is a huge Nerf to MoMs potential power.
---
I don't know it might remove some of the mind-game of a survivor during loops. 
---
Then again I can see your point. No reason to swap it out for Spirit Fury &amp; Enduring since it doesn't really make loops finish faster. When the sound is fixed as well the killer should be able to hear the survivors footsteps. 
---
On the Nurse, it's going to be incredibly strong.
---
This. Plus, you get another stack towards Spirit Fury for every pallet you force the survivors to put down.
---
he can mindgame witouth his red stain and walking forward, wich lets u track better the survivor
---
youre just preaching to the choir here my guy
---
Dude I love farmer John he is just cool
---
Hmm...maybe if you ran I’m All Ears with....Distressing was it? Or was it Unnerving Presence?
---
MOM deserves a huge nerf, honestly.
---
I've played him. He's still garbage. Just now instead of being exposed for 20 seconds and having to find one loop, survivors need to run to a junglegym or find \*gasp* two loops.
---
Ships now changed, now on intercept course
---
Yes it looks very cool. Can The devs take Fanmade designs and put them in the game for a price?
---
lmao had the same bug a few games ago
---
It can be anyone you want under that mask.... the decision lies within your heart.
---
I know, but he's no where near as bad anymore
---
Why is that downvoted
---
Where’s the “Face Camper” wraith design idea?
---
Binging with dwight. Sign me up for that
---
His mind games have a 30 seconds cooldown. And you can do the same mind games with Pig, but nobody put her high tier.
---
I mean, Legion isn't as bad anymore. IDK some people tend to check out. I don't DC but when I see a hillbilly I kinda stop giving a fuck and accept that I will die.
---
just look for the crows yourself
---
Servers down for PSN Network for over an hour.  Sucks ass
---
Holy cow. This looks professional af.
---
From what I’m looking at it wouldn’t be bad to take Spirits fury or Enduring or both since he’s a typical M1 killer. 
---
Only question is how good is MMA on this typical Stalker/Stealth Character. I haven’t played the ptb. But I do think he’ll do well with Enduring or Spirits mostly Enduring.
---
Apologies I misworded the perk buff.
---
Its 48 meters from the killer's location the aura is revealed during a rushed vault. Usually, survivors will only do a rush vault when they are being chased so it will likely only come in handy during then.
---
I would say Ruin is pretty mandatory, especially at high ranks. Generators go so fast without it. Sometimes you get unlucky and survivors delete your totem instantly, but better to take that gamble than instantly lose.
---
Couldn't go online for Bloodborne or Dark souls what the hell
---
Thanks for this! I’ll see about getting leather face and unlocking the perk. Hopefully they have a dlc bundle I can grab.
---
Ofcourse a myers would say that so he can grab your ass off the gen
---
I did get the point, you literally said he still looks behind himself.
---
Well Jill is a girl and that don’t look female lul. Stu would never do something like that. 
---
I think the decision lies with the maker of the picture, he’s the true decider!
---
Exactly, I think someone else put it perfectly before on another thread of mine, “I’m All Ears will be countered by people playing exactly how they have been.”
---
He is defetinly slowed while stalking. I dont get why this is such a problem. Myers, LF and Billy all have the same things
---
Why, do you NEED to know!?
---
True, you can always leave through exit gates with RBT on Kapp
---
I need this. I’m bing bong main.
---
If you break my traps, you break my heart.
---
I am a professional artist, so that's good to hear! xD
---
This is being submitted for a contest where will could potentially put it in for free :3
---
[Playstation confirmed](https://twitter.com/askps_uk/status/1139256859729321984?s=21)  they’re down
---
Hmm. I'll try that out later today. Stalking little by little might be a more successful method.
---
Plague tries to puke on Nea, Nea’s neck does a 180 and pukes right back on the plague stunning her for 3 seconds. New perk incoming
---
Oh well, even so it is not a problem.
---
Hex:Ruin, Surveillance, Enduring and Spirit Fury.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel, Thrilling Tremors, A Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher.
---
Yeah now the more I think about it, the perk still doesn't do much. Especially if it has its 60-second cool-down. 
---
Still, it's nice to see some effort from BHVR to make GF perks alittle bit better.
---
I was just reading over the thrill of the hunt and it said for every totem up earn a token,what's a token
---
Stu is a thot and a memer... personally, I like billy and Stu, but billy didn’t spend as much time in the costume as Stu, even if he was the brains (doubtful though? They share approximately 4.763 brain cells).  
---
Tbh i was inspired by the slashstreet boys parody of I want it that way (theirs is I’ll kill you that way) and I wanted to make a series of keychains with the slashers in their boyband outfits but alas... this is the only one I’ve done
---
Let me stop working on this gen cause my teammate is getting chased around the map.
---
Ah, someone noticed the shoulders! I definitely made them more askew for this design than he is in-game. I wanted him to look crooked.
---
🤤
---
**brofist**
---
OP is going to make the important guests at his family dinner uncomfortable with random facts about illegal puppy farms.
---
My friends have told me this would make it busted, but I had the idea that outside of your terror radius it works the same, but if a survivor is INSIDE your TR and they perform actions even without rushing them you’d still get like an audio cue at the least
---
That I shall, I don't even play wraith but damnit this is too damn good!
---
So you wouldnt get any money? i thought you would.
---
Well it also isn't just looping, part of the advantage of the survivors is basically having a much larger FoV in general compared to the killer.
---
I would love this and I’ve been wanting this for a while.

I wish it could be implemented similarly to events, in which reaching high ranks in a given month gives you 1 token of some currency (call them “Devotion Coins” or something) that can be exchanged for certain cosmetics in the shop. I think one basic cosmetic a month isn’t too bad and the rarer cosmetics could even be available for 3 tokens each, with the option remaining to pay in real cash if you want them sooner without grinding.
---
Oh, I misunderstood. I thought you were talking about bribing the devs! XD
---
I think the winner receives 10,000 auric cells, which I think is the equivalent of 100 real moneys. I'm not really in this for the rewards though.
---
Holy add this and take my money
---
He is slow. I dont think not as slow as Myers. Also, Plague has Isntadowns...Legion..LF...Myers...there are alot and none of them are top tier
---
Quality content right here. Damn you for making me laugh on class
---
Tokens don't really mean anything in game, they're just to keep track of something associated with a Perk. So with TotH, the Killer will start with five Totems, represented by a little 5 next to their Perk, visible only to them. Each time a Totem is destroyed, they will lose a token. The number of tokens then effects what the Perk does. For TotH, the Killer earns bonus Bloodpoints for each token left at the end of the game, and the Survivors suffer from a cleansing speed penalty that's worse the more tokens are left.
---
It's a system you'll see with a few different Perks like Barbecue &amp; Chili, Hex: Devour Hope, etc. Each one has different conditions for earning tokens, and the tokens have different effects. These tokens are not interchangeable, either. So if I have five tokens from Thrill of the Hunt because there are five Totems left, these tokens apply *only* to TotH's effects. They don't count as tokens for any other Perks.
---
Oh shit. Didn't even realize it was you, Panda. Haha. I should really look at people's names on here. Love your vids!!
---
Oh hahahaha, well nice of you. But i hope you win tho. Haven't seen the rest of the Designs, but my vote right now goes for this one.
---
It's 5 seconds for you to get them exposed. 1.5 for them to break you out of it. You'll have to have around a 4 second head start for them not to break you out of it. If you have built up the stalk to 4 seconds then yeah you can basically go after them at that point because they won't have enough time to remove it. They are toast at that point unless they have some safe pallets that can stall out the chase and/or a good t-wall. Getting to that 4 second mark is the issue. Takes being a bit sneaky. It's easier at the start of the game but once people know it's Ghostface everyone will be looking around for ya.
---
I didn't encounter anyone with Object of Obsession yet, have you? I wanted to know if that's still a counter to him or if it was fixed. I didn't notice anything about it in the patch notes.
---
I wonder if someday in the future, it might be possible to choose a hex perk and actually expect to keep it for a decent amount of time.
---
Or are we still gonna have totems "hidden" in plain view of a generator.
---
&gt;Survivors earn Adrenaline by completing objectives. Killers "earn" NOED by failing to protect their objectives. People really need to stop comparing Adrenaline with that crutch.
---
Ok both activates at the end of the game. Both gives an extra health state, 1 down or 1 free heal, both grants speed, one permanently the other for a short period of time, one can be denied the other can't. Yeah they can't be compared, adrenaline is way stronger just for the fact it can't be denied and all 4 can run it which means 4 heals while the killer still has to be looped and maybe hit the survivor and gives at best 1 kill if the other survivors have brain cells
---
&gt;Hex perks have the strongest effects possible on game with NOED being the strongest. Them being tied to a totem doesn't make them the weakest perks in the game.
---
Sure, try to use any hex totem in red ranks, even ruin the most common one, then tell me how much times pass before it get DENIED for the rest of the game
---
&gt;Your claim that a single survivor is as strong as a killer is absolutely absurd. You're a terrible killer if you actually believe that. That is a personal problem of you believe that with a straight face.
---
Sadly I play the game as supposed to be, both sides since you will be blinded otherwise. A single survivor isn't as strong as a killer, it's almost as strong as a killer especially due to map design. I don't have any personal problems since 90% of survivors are dumb and bad so they do mistakes 24/7. A single mistake by the killer make a survivor been able to loop the killer another time or get to a stronger loop making the chase be longer. A single mistake of one survivor costs almost nothing since another hit needs to be made, while the other 3 people will pimp the gens. In red ranks 3 gens are popped by the first hook depending on the map and survivor survivability. Luckily most people are bad, for reference about how the game would be unfairly broken in favor of survivors look it up on YouTube "depip squad" without any kind of communication, just doing the objectives they are supposed to do
---
&gt;Killers claim they want gens to pop slower. A totem counter would do that. It would encourage survivors to look for dulls instead of genrushing. SWF already have totem counters anyways. This just makes solo queue have a chance at cleansing the 5. Killers just say jUsT cLeAnZe LuL! They claim totems are objectives yet they want them untrackable. That makes them not an objective as every other one in game is tracked for both sides. You cannot have it both ways.
---
No, a totem lightbringer points will, not a counter giving you more info than the power role. guess what, they are doing that. You want to have another extra information when you already have even way too much. Devour hope 3 stacks, pops the info, noed, pop out. Hex destroyed, another pop out, the killer position when he picks up the survivor and now you want to know how many totems are left? Dude I think I gave you 3 to 4 counters to noed and you still want more.. maybe you're the one delusional if you say that with a straight face. 
---
I thought this was a survival horror game but maybe it's just me. Every killer perk have way too many counters compared to the survivor counterpart and you still want more. For Chtulu, BBQ have almost 10 counter at this point and it's one of the most used tracking/bp perks used. Really? At this point let's delete the killer role and put an AI
---
I like it, I dislike those songs way to poppy and upbeat for me personally. Billy seems to be the smart one while Stu is just some idiot but a memorable lovely idiot.
---
At least I have fun no matter what happens, I look at this game with no sides on Survivor or Killer. If you mori me me, Ill still be satisfied. If someone loops me and teabags me after 5 mins... I give em props. As long as I'm having fun, idrc. Have a good day Sir, and sorry for the late reply, I was at work.
---
Amd I honestly think safe hooks makes more sense since it limits it to 2 MoM activations in a match at most
---
Is that a wailing bell or are you just happy to see me?

Kate is for noob friendly perks. Adam is for situational perks. In my opinion, I would choose Adam. He has one of the *strongest* perks in the game. Make absolute sure you get Diversion.

Welcome to DbD. For future references just look it up every patch DbD had and how the game was at launch, just to be sure to have some tools.

Have fun and ignore the salty plebs

Or breathingeye90. I don’t remember rn
---
You should check them out! Some of them are very creative! I want everyone to have a fighting chance.
---
I always though wraith had some of the cooler cosmetics and potential for such good ones, it's too bad his game play is very low tier and not very exciting.
---
Yes i will! But where can i find them? 😂
---
Until you jump off the balcony and into a hag trap.
---
"Fixing NOED"?  
---
Whats wrong with it?
---
I do not think that would make the perk busted really. Considering that the perk still has counterplay in that survivors can adapt by not performing slow vaults in your terror radius. All locations can be reached without slow vaults. 
---
It would become a decent tracking perk with that suggestion.
---
If only Friday the 13th didnt have a legal rights shit storm
---
Indeed, it's just a giant middle finger for all the other players, no matter what side. It's unfun and can't wait for the dedicated servers and see them banned. Can't wait for the salty posts about it
---
it's Sam from iCarly, obviously.
---
yeah
---
This is better than the actual wraith skin.
---
They don’t have the rights to the movie, only to the mask.
---
I honestly enjoy it as a “party game” version of DbD, like sort of a DbD lite. It’s pretty fun when you don’t take it too seriously. I’m pretty bummed there won’t be anymore content. I would have loved to see Jason X.
---
True, but they should at least give her a jean jacket.

He's an M1 killer, to be sure, but I always manage to have pretty exciting rounds with him. The add-ons that make his bell totally silent and remove his terror radius make for some very fun matches. :P

Thanks kids.

Omfg gold. 💀
---
The only time I cleanse against a plague is when gates are powered and opened, and that’s just so I can take a hit if needbe to help someone escape, lmao
---
Agreed. I actually saved a post someone made here about what cosmetics you could use on Meg and Kate to make them look like Sid.
---
&gt;Killer perks are considerably stronger in general compared to survivor. There are only a handful of good perks available for survivor period. Most are pretty underwhelming
---
Ok let's make the list:
---
Monstrous shrine
---
Unnerving presence
---
Predator
---
Bloodhound
---
Shadowborn
---
Lightborn
---
Stridor
---
Spies from the shadows (bugged)
---
Hex thrill of the hunt
---
Beast of prey
---
Insidious
---
Unrelenting
---
Overwhelming presence (unless very specific builds, still weak)
---
Territorial imperative
---
Huntress lullaby, Hex huntress lullaby
---
Hangman's trick
---
Mad grit
---
Iron maiden
---
Fire up
---
Dark devotion
---
I might as well forgot some. Still as you can see just a handful are useful for the killer side too. And guess what, are mostly mechanics fix based like bamboozle, enduring, brutal strength etc
---
&gt;I verse red rank killers with noed regularly. Spirits, Billies, nurses lol. It's pretty gross. Every one of Adrenalines effects are temporary lasting an instant while NOED is permanent and applies to everyone so long as the totem is up. Claiming Adrenaline is stronger in light of that is absurd. 
---
Idk I don't see as many noed as you do. Are you sure you see the same colors as most people do? Red and green are pretty similar if you have a chromosome's issue. If you're a woman then my theory isn't valid so I don't know what to tell you, you're very unlucky and very stubborn to don't use any method I listed before on how to counter it. At this point you have every tool you need. I said noed is permanent, I listed their differences, I'm starting to think you didn't read what I wrote or you are really stupid. Guess why people at red ranks don't use noed (source: BHVR statistics), because it's pointless and useless against good survivors
---
This comment predicted ghost face
---
Comprehensive answer, I'll do you the solid of breaking it down.
---
This is the literal limit of my ability. All I can do is admit I'm crap. As I said in response to a different comment, yeah I've got a job and it eats my time like Pac-Man eats the dots. I've not got the opportunity to go and make a better player of myself, I have to put my job, and my ability to finance my home, first. I'm afraid this may boil down to the unfortunate truth of being grown up: My life isn't paid for any more, I've gotta do it myself.  
---
I'll be honest, I really can't stand the concept of "learning" from youtubers and streamers. As far as I can tell, none of them give a monkey's arse about helping anything. By all means, if there's one out there with a heart let me know, because if anything I can't even find a single exception. And I really don't want to spend ages in a lobby, sifting through half a million private accounts just so I can stitch together how all these guys with names in Cyrillic are either best friends or conjoined quadruplets in real life. And maybe its my antiquated feelings about honour, but I can't see myself backing down from a fight. I'm a "to the bitter end" kinda person.
---
See, that idea about starting with survivor games is quite a good one. Hadn't crossed my mind honestly, but the maths checks out. There's at least a 1 in 4 chance my survivor team has a god-tier player in whereas in the Killer role I'm really only playing the odds. I'm quite terrible at Survivor though (but hey, at least I can nail skill checks, thanks Rhythm Games), so that might be a cautious approach on that idea.
---
And lastly, I did see, but its one of those things where until I've got it in front of me, I can't see if it'll be any good or not. Maybe if there was a reason to rank up (other than to generally match with skill-equal players), then people who are good wouldn't hold out and stomp on low ranks for a cheap thrill. Honestly, I wouldn't mind a season simply lasting longer. That way there wouldn't be as much suffering.
---
Im dead.
---
That’s why pc is better
---
Holy shit, his eyes are feminine
---
As a killer main, that’s ridiculous behavior. I understand leaving a person or two slugged for a short time if someone else you can chase is close, or if you want to stop the hatch from spawning too early... but what you’re describing is intentionally toxic and just bad sportsmanship. I’m sorry someone was assholish enough to ruin four other people’s fun.
---
Thank you. I'm gonna try to get the attention of the devs with this post but i doubt they'll even pay attention lmao
---
Exactly, take that facecampers!
---
I like this
---
*Dead By Daylight: Castle Defender [Mobile]*
---
&gt; all while making a loud tiger sound... for some reason... 
---
they  played  that  sound  in  the  first movie  when  the  pig  kidnaps  someone.
---
Everyone has their killers that they feel they lose to all of the time. I have troubles with Billy, but it's probably because I don't adapt my play style enough when I'm against him rather than him being OP. I don't really feel like the Plague is OP, but you definitely have to play differently against her than other killers.
---
If you're playing solo, you don't have the ability to coordinate not to cleanse, so if others cleanse, the best thing to do is stay away from her. If they are cleansing, you'll probably want to as well, to give you an extra hit. I would recommend trying not to unless you're on death hook, going for lots of saves, or bodyblocking for someone else. If you have to though, you have to, but she is at her strongest when she has the corrupt purge.
---
Getting sick isn't the end of the world. I've spent entire games sick when playing against the Plague. It means that I can go for hook saves when the survivor is sick and my other teammates can stay healthy. It means I can work on infected gens without being detected as easily.
---
The vomit can also be avoided with practice. There are good tiles on most maps where you can avoid getting hit if you crouch. You can also use the vomit charge time to your advantage, as she slows down when charging and holding the vomit. Use this time to hide or get away.
---
It was pretty infuriating. I hadn’t played in a long while and had finally started climbing rank before that day. Took a bunch of losses in a row but that’s life. After that game I said fuck it and hung it up for the day.
---
Super cool
---
Yeah I kinda hate it, I liked looking at my survivor's face :c
---
To smell cheap.
---
The new Badham rework is looking good.
---
DbD community in a nutshell.
---
Sounds about right
---
I love Discordance for sure that’s an automatic perk but nurses eh I could care less for that. Just from seeing how he’s played and how he should play Nurses doesn’t seem like a perk for Ghostface imo of course.
---
This is not a buff. More like a convenience.
---
You will still get to see it when you're on the hook 🤣
---
I agree.
---
Yes and no. What you used to do to get the adept achievment, was slug the second last survivor and then look for the other one. But for the adept, you also need to make sure gens don't get done, so there are times where you are about to get a 4k before 2 gens got done. Hatch used to only spawn if at least 2 gens got done, but now it always spawns. And it is actually harder to get the final kill with 0, 1 or 2 generators done than it is to get the final kill with 3 or 4 generators done. Because with 3 or 4 generators done, you can start looking for the hatch before the second last guy dies on hook.
---
In the end, I feel like all you should need is a 4k. 1DC is enough to ruin your chances of getting the adept achievment
---
Noed isn't OP.  
---
Old Noed (Not being a hex) was OP.  
---
But 'new' NOED is easily counterable.  
---
Also the killer hasn't failed his objective (yet).  
---
If so, perks like Blood Warden, Remember Me and more would fall into the same category.  
---
They are just lategame oriented.  
---
I don't run NOED because I don't like it. I perceive it as average. It rarely comes into play because either:  
---
\-I kill the survivors before they do their last gen.  
---
\-They cleansed all the dulls.  
---
\-They cleansed NOED before I hit someone.  
---
\-They escaped before I got to them.  
---
\-I got to them and hit someone, but he was injured anyways (I guess I profited from the speed bonus, but I think people don't mind it that much. They care about the insta-down effect.)
---
And when it comes into play, I get one down/hook.  
---
But I know, we all remember these games where the exit gates are allready open and a killer with NOED facecamps 1 survivor.  
---
His SWFs decide to hook bomb/dive him and run into certain death. And then they blame 'crutch perk #1'.
---
I would say: Just cleanse the dulls. 
---
But to be honest that's wasted time. (Dont bother, just do gens instead).
---
If you aren't in a chase and NOED literally procs WHILE the killer is hitting you - you can just counter it with adrenaline or playing stealthy at the time when the last gen procs.
---
And don't go for risky unhooks if the killer is camping.
---
I never bother with Noed on red ranks, as killer or survivor. Nobody of my friend does either.
---
It's more of a noob-stomper perk.
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
I really want Jason in DBD alongside camp crystal lake map.
---
I don’t blame you. I wish everyone could just play the game and stop teabagging, flashlight clicking, face camping first hook, dropping hooks in the killers face, dropping survivors and slamming the hatch in their face, etc etc. I just wish people would just play as intended and have a good time.
---
I agree 100%. I have all of the killers adepts except freddy and plague, but damn were some of them excruciating to grind out. Needs to be changed to 4k for sure.
---
People just find him annoying because mending is " annoying" which it is but is to semi alot the game down but people hate constantly mending even though he has little besides that
---
Everyone wants to play killer in PTB. Of something new comes out you should expect people to try it out.
---
As a new player I have to ask: What the hell is OchiDO?
---
I just ignore the hatch and hang out near one of the exits. 90% of the time the killer will scour the map for the hatch and ignore the exit gates.
---
I find siblings are a great place to start
---
Stop. I can only get so erect.
---
I've heard from all the streams and YT vids I've watched at about 30 min.
---
BR- IF I SEE ONE MORE KILLER DOING THAT STUPID ASS TAUNTING AT THE END OF THE GAME FOR THE LAST SURVIVOR IM GONNA CRY. THAF GOD DAMN WRAITH HARD-CAMPED AND TUNNELED ALL GAME, WE STILL DID 4 GENS BUT YANOE DONT WANNA LEAVE PEOPLE FOR DEAD SO NO ESCAPEY. THEN I DIE FOR THE LAST DOWNED SURVIVOR TO MAKE SURE THEY GET UP (AND I DIED ON THE GROUND BC THE WRAITH DIDNT WANT THE HATCH TO OPEN THAT SELFISH BOI) BUT WHEN HE DOWNS HER HE LEAVES HER FOR AGES BEFORE FINALLY CLOSING THE HATCH, COMING TO PICK HER UP AND DROPPING HER BY THE EXIT. she was so confused and angry the poor Feng and she knew just as I did that he wouldn’t let her and he was taunting her, when he went invis by her she began opening the gate UNTIL HE GOT OUT SMACKED HER PICKED HER UP LET HER WRIGGLE FREE. She ran, poor thing, I mean she knew she wouldn’t get out but she ran. BUT NO HE WENT AFTER HER AND NOED’D HER ASS BACK DOWN AGAIN AND HOOKED HER LITERALLY SO THE ENTITY COULDNT STEAL HIS KILL SMHHHHH SO TOXIC MAN ;-;
---
&gt;Making mental retardation jokes and whatever weird dumbass thing you were saying about women is just cringe material
---
Called color blindness. Maybe my joke can be appreciated by people with an IQ higher than 70 since they teach you about chromosome's functions at the elementary schools. Are you that stupid???
---
&gt;I could make a meme list of all the horrible survivor perks and I guarantee you it would run longer than the killer side. That's simply redundant.
---
Please do! I wanna see it. Except the fact that there are more survivors than killers, they fixed and buffed a lot of survivor perks. Please I wanna see that
---
&gt;You made it pretty clear there won't be any intelligent discussion happening around here at this point with that stuff. Have a great day and enjoy getting rekt in your killer games since you think a single survivor is the power role.
---
I know, it's hard to discuss somebody who refuse reality and denies logic and want just to have an echo chamber and confirmation bias
---
No thanks. Love my ps4 too much.
---
Yeah it's just nice to have him be legitimately good. They can always fine tune him later, but I think most will be happy about him getting released in his current state.
---
30 mintutes give or take.
---
Wait, I heard he was still bad after the buffs? Is he actually enjoyable to play now?
---
* Reposts within the last 60 days are not permitted.
---
Not sure about OoO, some people have said it's fixed and others have said it's still broken ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Some of this is just the way the game is going to be played. In reality stuff like face camping is just going to happen. The shit part is half the time my teammates don’t move on accordingly. If I’m hung and Billy is right there go do a gen. I’ll take the loss and not feel bad if someone else escapes. But just standing there is BS and doesn’t help anyone. 
---
Dropping a hook in the killers face is a a legit strat. I understand how shitty it feels but it’s no different than stashing someone in the basement and hiding just to the side and letting your terror radius go away. It’s a bait and can benefit one side or the other.
---
It would be really tasteless imo. Real life killers aren't cool slasher villains.
---
Leatherface, Doctor or Trapper. They all need buffs but I don't think even a buff to LF would help him all that much. His power is just straight up bad.
---
This is the ultimate roller coaster. First I hear switch news I want it! Then I see gameplay and I don’t want it! Then I see the E3 video and I want it! Then I read this and I don’t want it. 
---
ARGH this is so stressful :(
---
It's not the same ;w; best way to spend time when sitting on the gen, admiring Meg's ugly face.
---
he’s decent. about the top of mid-tier, i’d say nurse, billy, huntress, spirit, ghostface
---
Oh no, your precious MoM crutch is more balanced now and takes effort to use
---
Oh, that’s more than acceptable.
---
this just in: an m1 instadown that i don't have to work for at all isn't op
---
Ever since I put on spirit fury, survivors just drop pallets early now :/
---
Leatherface is my guess. Trapper at the very least can use certain add-ons to boost him up and he dominates the 3 gen strat.
---
LF literally has nothing except camping and an unreliable insta-down. 
---
So I'm guessing the bottom 3 will be
---
Leatherface ---- Trapper ---- Doctor(depending on add-ons) or Wraith
---
yes. some people are saying myers is still better, but he basically contains all the levels of evil within in one power, he doesn’t have a terror radius when power is active, he stalks, and gives exposed status in SECONDS
---
Keep that same energy with surviving my guy...
---
How many hours do you have?
---
I personally think he's dead mid-tier. The ability to have a lot of people injured constantly is a useful time waster.
---
Well now I’m more stoked, cause Myers is my current main, but I’ve wanted Ghostface in the game since I first got it. I of course was pretty bummed by the feedback from the first PTB build.
---
Ah, yes.
---
He was nerfed, his cooldown is 10 seconds longer....
---
that’s actually from a fan made youtube intro, not  in the tv show. i didn’t know it until i searches ghostface and youtube, and the video actually contains many slashers. https://youtu.be/xnPz7aXfnvk
---
Indeed.
---
Freddy is actually the second adept I got, he was the second killer I tried out
---
It's a DbD youtuber, famous for DbD funny montages but also known as a very toxic survivor. Luckily enough he's no longer acting like that.
---
Almost as visible as the Wraith in the background
---
You aren't entitled to an escape either
---
This is fucking sick
---
I have all the achievements so I know the hell it is to get adepts on all killers, I'll be able to see if it's easier or not with ghostface's adept when he comes out. And I've gotten an adept achievement with a DC once, happened when I was playing Doc.
---
It might just be me but I see way more “I got camped ” posts than “I didn’t get a 4K” posts
---
I wanna be called the [Gamer Ghosts] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-yYfyjV-k0)
---
dont make it too obvious that you have it
---
I love happy endings
---
But you have to work for it?  
---
Hex spawns still suck in this game and NOED should be expected on certain killers.  
---
You still have to find, catch, hit/down and carry the survivors to the hooks.  
---
And then they can still escape. (If it isn't their last hook).  
---
It's a perk with counters (Adrenaline, Dull-Cleansing), that only activates if certain conditions are met (atleast 1 dull totem alive), and then it still requieres you to put the usual killer work in.  
---
All that at a time where survivors are able to leave/win the game.  
---
So you got a very short time span, if you got one totem and the totem doesn't get cleansed, to get an insta-down.  
---
I would call MoM OP. Old DS was OP. Before the Exhaustion nerf Sprint Burst was OP, too.  
---
And sometimes I agree with people that old NOED (Not being a hex) was too strong, too.  
---
But Hex: Noed is average.  
---
I know that survivors who don't put any effort to counterplay that perk at all perceive noed as OP, but they are simply wrong.
---
Pretty please let this be a thing. I want to exorcist as I work on a gen (like I normally do, thanks No Terror Radius Myers)
---
yeah I think it would be a great QoL change. it's important to be able to distinguish that notification from others.
---
even if I hate your build. you monster...
---
How many bloodpoints did u get lmao
---
yeah same. i saw an edited version of ghostface with the red devil cosmetic cape on but the red was black and it sorta looked like the costume from the movie so i hope they add that as a cosmetic
---
Perfection.
---
So not only are you a biased to death babykiller but also a pretentious dick too.  Bro we are beyond done.  Keep blaming all your losses on the almighty op survivor that hasn't existed in a year with the string of nerfs and killer buffs.  You're a joke
---
This is dope
---
This is too true
---
im not here to argue with someone that thinks adrenaline is a counter to noed lmao
---
I agree MoM should be nerfed, don't be a brat. I'm saying protection hits are fickle and that is why I'm disappointed.
---
Did you read the rest of my comments in this chain?
---
I ask myself whats gona Happen with hag traps
---
Well it does. You didn't argue at all so far.
---
I gave a lot of arguments to back my points up while you respond with stuff like:
---
"bUt ItS oP bEcAuSe I sAy So!"
---
Have a nice day buddy.
---
Implying his montages are funny
---
Homophobic where? Stop being a victim weirdo lol nowhere in any comment have I ever displayed homophobia
---
Deleted previous reply because I realized what you meant now
---
Disarming and sabotaging traps are two different things. Disarming allows the Trapper to pick up and re-place traps, but using sabo or a toolbox breaks the trap, leaving it broken and unusable for quite a while
---
That is amazing!!
---
The fact you call me baby killer when play a single role it's just dumb, shows me how ridiculous your points are. I don't blame or cry like someone else opening a discussion about FEELINGS but guess what, my facts don't care about your feelings. I can source everything I said and countered your arguments and explained my motivations. Yours were just a feelvsreal argument. Enjoy the game and keep being blind dude
---
how the FUCK IS ADRENALINE A COUNTER TO NOED IM CRYING
---
720p on dock 540p undocked
---
YEAH MAN COMMIT DONT DIP, COMMIT DONT DIP 😤😤
---
Based on how the subreddit views self-promo, you likely thought wrong
---
You're an idiot to assume that.  I've been playing both killer and survivor equally for over 2 years.  Your assumption is baseless that I play only one side.  It has as much merit as the rest of your points basically.
---
I can post again but not a link just a cut from it if y’all want, not really asking for anything just thought it was somewhat funny 🤷‍♂️
---
~~I want both to Mori me either way~~
---
Moment of silence for the redditor who suffered a stroke while writing this.
---
Wouldn’t want him in the game, but I would sure as shit love a sequel to the movie.
---
I got about 167K  
---
Would of been more but sadly i did not manage to max out objective and altruism :/
---
This could be a whole new, it looks so good and unique
---
Holy fuck that actually looks scary!
---
I do play killer and I get bullshit hits all the time.. stop assuming... always smack at pallets you're almost guaranteed a hit.
---
I honestly just wish we had gotten a survivor and a map, but I realize they only got the license for the mask (hence Ghost Face instead of Ghostface, and it being an original person under the mask), but it still would’ve been cool to get Sydney and maybe Stu’s house as a map.
---
*laughs in Vacuum*
---
I agree protection hits can be weird but safe unhooks can also be just as weird. If this perk were to get stacks from ‘safe unhooks’ like We’re Gonna Live Forever currently does then it would be just as easy to get MoM to work. Survivors would just be diving at the hook to get unhooks for MoM stacks when the killer is right next to the hook. And if that still counts as a ‘safe unhook’ toward MoM then you can imagine how that would work out. Killers would actually have more incentive to tunnel the survivor who was just unhooked then they would just slug them which makes for a bad experience on both sides
---
Face camping ruins the game just as rank does, since it obviously doesn’t do shit except cause longer q times, case in point for a dying game.
---
Spirit Fury without Enduring for that Myers. Hmm...
---
Nice farm game tho! Wish I could get one of these.
---
i HONESTLY would’ve been completely fine with an original survivor and original map. i just feel cheated of a chapter bc it took them 3 months to make one character?
---
But it's not fun if I can't exploit my laserbeam flashlight, loops and teabag without repercussion!
---
Truth, even an original survivor and map would’ve been cool. I get it, they just added Ash, but still.
---
Because ghost face is too powerful and most players want more of a challenge getting a stalk off
---
You're the one who called me babykiller assuming things. Ofc I assume too when you defend something that you can't! You can play since beta for all I care but you even ignore the 80% survivability and that people in red ranks don't use noed.. stats from BHVR!
---
It has way more merit than yours since are feel based
---
Yo, that is something I would love to to see in game! Awesome job! I personally like what you've done with the shoulders. Nice touch!
---
This cosmetic with a scarier bell sound would be terrifying.
---
As someone who plays survivor,
---
yeah that's about how it is
---
Ngl my butthole was clenched quite a bit there at the end
---
are you sure it wasn't a match with 2 killers? there were 5 gens after all
---
*[Childish Gambino loudly playing in the background]*
---
I’m gonna have so much fun with this...
---
Figured it out! When you have this subreddit open (or any posts in this subreddit), just below the "Create Post" button there is a little dropdown called "Community Options." If you expand this there is an option for "User Flair Preview" where you can add/ edit your flair options.
---
Technically 4, the killer counts. /s
---
True true...
---
Literally looks like professional concept art. Pretty kick ass work my dude. I hope this or the Vampire Gothic Doctor makes it. Both of you did such an amazing job.
---
PSN has been having problems for a few hours, it's not just DBD.
---
I mean, the entire video could've just been turned into the last 20's.
---
But it’s not fun if I can’t exploit my five blinks, ebony mori, and face camps without repercussion!
---
I actually kinda hoped it was, but no. Only one killer
---
That it is intended.
---
Diving the hook in front of the killer is a solid way to end up denying yourself a safe unhook.
---
Also, if MoM used safe unhooks, only 2 survivors per match could ever reach active MoM, which would functionally be a Nerf to the potential of 4 MoMs in a match. 
---
I'm not saying it *should* be safe unhooks, I'm saying I'd have preferred them changing it to safe unhooks, which still requires more effort than just being hit 3 times. And imo would be more of a Nerf, and be more consistent in counting. 
---
But hopefully you see that I'm not arguing against MoM getting any Nerf, just the protection hit decision.
---
That's everyone's defense when it comes to hillbilly he gets looped...  being able to zip across the map in a matter of seconds is very fucked up plus instadowns that he doesnt have to work for is insane, at least Myers has to work for his insta downs.... if survivors experience the exhausted status so should Billy. Just like evey other killers has to wait and build up there power it's not just given.
---
They're reworking a lot of the maps and have been slowly taking out  good loops blocking tons of windows... 
---
Until they nerf hillbilly and nurse I feel like survivors having an op perk is fair...
---
YOU THINK THIS IS MAKEUP?!
---
Yeah but i think people will know what i mean with a 3-men game
---
Giggity
---
I’m definitely going to believe that at face value without asking for anything else. Thank you.
---
What the hell is this??? I'm not supposed to be scared by Bing Bong Boi???
---
In all seriousness, fantastic job OP this costume is soooo dope
---
HEADON APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD!
---
I mean you didn't elaborate any point so far. 
---
You just keep saying that Noed is OP for reasons that aren't true.   
---
But I'll do you the favor and back this point up before I leave the conversation.  
---
It's like I said: Hex: Noed isn't that strong.  
---
But it's really annoying if you are ALLREADY in a chase WHILE the last generator procs.  
---
So if the killer is right behind your ass, the last gen procs and he swings his weapon at you, it can result in a frustrating insta-down.  
---
At this point you didn't have the time to hide from the killer. 
---
Your mates didn't have the time to cleanse the hex or open the gates.
---
If you didn't stand next to one of the 20+ pallets or vault windows, you didnt have the chance to react/do anything against him swinging at you at all.
---
So there is a quick and good use of that NOED insta-down.
---
Adrenaline however (besides healing) gives you a FIVE second 150% speed buff. That's 2 more seconds than sprint burst.  
---
This should you give enough of an advantage to quickly get to the next loop, pallet, vault window or even lose the killer.
---
Re-Positioning to a a good looping/window spot should give your mates enough time to open the gates/cleanse the totem if you aren't playing on rank 20-10.
---
When you see a mori pop and you’ve been hooked already, it’s time to pray
---
This looks badass
---
ash basically came out with the plague and jane though. like 2 months ago
---
Spoiler tag, salt/rant, confusing title, non sense meme, tf is goin on OP?
---
You obviously don’t go on r/dbdgonewild very often
---
The game is literally based around us vs them though.
---
I will say that mentality should be left in game and not even make it into endgame chat.
---
This show is the reason my username is what it is.
---
*L O O P*
---
Well not since the EGC sure but before that hatch change, curb stomping the survivors before they could manage to finish 2 gens did pretty much entitle the survivor to the 4k. So it's not really all that crazy to understand why some killers are peeved at hitting 3k before any gens popped only to see the last survivor get the hatch.
---
Actually scary
---
A thread about Plague being OP, LMFAO. 
---
What's next, a thread "Cannibal too OP, please nerf" ?
---
I need muh god mode to enjoy the game!
---
Why’s everyone looking at me like that?
---
Do you happen to have the moonlight offerings in your inventory that were discontinued? That would be interesting to see
---
the games I play where survivors bring 4 BPS the killer will either bring a mori/camp or wait for the game to load in before dcing
---
are you forgetting that noed also gives a speed boost? one that's permanent???
---
also, we're talking about endgame. there are likely not many pallets left and window loops just don't work well when the killer has an instadown through said windows and the speed boost.
---
and besides, teammates aren't gonna cleanse a totem that they don't know is there. because, you know, it doesn't tell you noed is active until AFTER someone gets hit.
---
Myers looking extra thicc
---
It depends if they DC before or after you hook them. If they do it before, you can already say goodbye to your adept
---
Thank you so much! I actually do work as a freelance concept artist, and many of my paid obligations went neglected while I was working on this! XD
---
THANK YOU!!! AND UNLESS THE COLLAPSE WAS STARTED BY THE EXIT GATES PEOPLE WHO USE NOED DONT DESERVE A WIN! IF IT WAS STARTED BY A HATCH CLOSE THEN OH WELL
---
Bro I was saying my POV. For me she is the most OP. I am not asking for a nerfs so don't put your words into my mouth. Thank you.
---
r/void
---
Like as fast as is comfortable, just try not to miss a press or hold too long. I think I usually do it at like [200 bpm](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;ei=ksICXZDMLc60rQGD6YuoBA&amp;q=metronome&amp;oq=metronome&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.12...0.0..100720...0.0..0.0.0.......0......gws-wiz.djt3U2_tasg)
---
Thank you! Yeah, I really wanted the shoulders to look more crooked. That's how I see the Wraith in my head, honestly, like even from his original design. I just wanted to exaggerate that a bit.
---
Very... succulent...meaty...juicy...tender... N I P
---
*Notices your open hand* owo whats this?
---
I remember going against a Vanity Mirror Myers and my SWF group (me too) were pissing our pants because he had the open hand in tier 2 and it seemed to be taking AGES for him to hit tier 3 and he was slow. I honestly thought he was running Tombstone and Tuft but nah.
---
I looked this guy up. A murderer from the 80's right? Dude looks like he could be in DbD. Fuckin' creep.
---
As a wraith main I approve
---
But as soon as any survivor spots you, you are alerted. As long as you keep the survivor you're targeting in view, you should be fine.
---
He seems way faster and viable now to me
---
Wraith mains have the best taste ;)
---
&gt; are you forgetting that noed also gives a speed boost? one that's permanent???
---
Nope, but 150% for 5 seconds will get you far in comparisson to 4% (which you get from NOED). That's less than a bloodlust I proc.
---
&gt; also, we're talking about endgame. there are likely not many pallets left and window loops just don't work well when the killer has an instadown through said windows and the speed boost. 
---
1-3 pallets should be enough if you know how to loop. And a lot of window loops (Houses, Barn, Shack, that mine-thing on the suffication pit and more) still work wonders.  
---
&gt; and besides, teammates aren't gonna cleanse a totem that they don't know is there. because, you know, it doesn't tell you noed is active until AFTER someone gets hit. 
---
Like I said: Against certain killers you should expect it on green, purp and/or red ranks.
---
And even if they don't: They'll still do their job and open them gates.  
---
And if you have adrenaline you should easily be able to get to a safe spot/escape.
---
But I am pretty sure that you won't change your opinion no matter what.  
---
Go rank a killer to purp/red ranks and start using NOED. Test how many games this "crutch perk" will easily hand to you, since it's just such an overpowered easy m1 perk.  
---
Or keep crying about an average perk used by bad-average killers to kill bad-average survivors.  
---
I'll leave here :)
---
I remember there being a silly exploit where VHs porn + Smelly Inner Soles for Clown resulted in you moving FASTER when reloading than when not reloading. Was patched though.
---
I'm talking about when it makes it's way into reddit and fourm posts which clouds people's better judgment for what's best for the game as a whole
---
Wdym? Also im getting downvoted?! This subreddit is really something else
---
B R I L L I A N T
---
If you're facecamping and you don't get a ton of gens popped on you and that is not your only kill that's kinda on the survivors... Can't comment on the 5 blinks as I can't play nurse and if you are face camping then ebony mori is 0 use to you
---
*Huntress maining intensifies*
---
In that case, I really hope this has good chances of winning. I'm a Myers main but if I wasn't i'd probably play Wraith because I love stealth characters and this outfit is right on part with the Blight outfit. Your art for Wraith reminds me so much of H.R. Gigers [artwork](https://www.wikiart.org/en/h-r-giger/necronom-iv-1976) who was the inspiration for the Xenomorph for the Alien movies and I love it a lot.
---
Why? You can see the bubble came from the direction of a hex totem....
---
Is this a Nea joke in 2019
---
Tomorrow
---
Don’t know why you’re being downvoted, it could reference that. Lots of Splicers wear rabbit masks.
---
Abusing? Please elaborate. Looks like the killer just making the optimal play to me
---
Another day, another ash meme.
---
Please never stop, the loss of the sfm memes still gets to me this very day :(
---
I want a nemesis character
---
link?
---
Thats incredible!
---
Yeah but good luck noticing that in the middle of a chase. For all I know it might be a generator blowing up or someone fast-vaulting. 
---
Perhaps the perk icon can blink or something to warn that a totem is being worked on.
---
I dont facecamp at all actually, unless ive been tbagged consistantly or something like that. I just hate those perks, no reason to get so mad son :) and if you checked my profile that would be the very first comment i ever put on this subreddit, so maybe you should sit down relax and grab yourself a beverage. This post had the Salt/Rant tag and i got all the salt i needed from a simple OMEGALUL, thank you
---
A bit over 2 hours from now. 
---
https://countle.com/lyygOXLh1
---
Ahhaha lol I was pretending to run like a survivor.
---
I’m sorry for your loss.
---
Why so modest? Instant 4k is what he deserves
---
After falling for a while it just resplendent your Y location to be above the hole again, with any momentum you eventually land next to it. Can get you ontop of things.
---
;
---
Credit the original artist, please
---
I see that. Sorry I just really hate MoM in general as it has destroyed a lot of games for me as killer. Not sure why a perk was added to give a survivor another health state under injured basically every game... pretty broken. As long as they make it take purposeful skill and thought to use then I guess I’ll be happy
---
i agree, it sounds really cool and i love cool sounds like that. i am also now a Ghostface main but only when he comes out because i sure as shit am not waiting 30 minutes in the PTB to play him
---
Isn't that what they're doing with the battlepass thing?
---
Thats an amazing play not abuse tf?
---
Omg that's so cool!
---
I'm all Ears also got a huge buff. It now activates for rushed actions within 48 meters of you, instead of outside of your terror radius, so it'll now work in chase.
---
A horror game. For the killers that is if this actually happens I am going to be scared.
---
Spine chill is ok, it definitely isn't meta, but it could be useful against more than just stealth killers. It is one of my personal favorites especially for unconventional uses. It could give you that extra second you need against freddy to finish something and it could tell you if a killer is actually coming towards you or if the heart beat is just from another survivor looping near by and you see the perk turn on and off while giving a little repair boost every other second. It also saves my ass against wraiths, pigs, and some times the spirit. It could also be useful if the killer has monitor and abuse, especially against an ew2 shape or a big cock no shock doc.
---
I would love to see this. It is amazing!
---
David for Leon.
---
they should switch to first person while in a locker. its weird that they dont, every other third person game does it. would really help with the atmosphere.
---
Not abuse. This guy made a good play.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
yup, that's the one. they call him "The Night Stalker". i didn't know if you had gotten inspired or anything. based on your answer, i guess the answer is no.
---
anyway, this is fantastic. thank you for sharing!
---
If you see the bubble coming from a totem it's safe to assume someone is touching your totem
---
It looks absolutely revolting.
---
I love it, 10/10.
---
That is actually so true whenever one of my friends plays the game they would try to copy me and seeing them successfully looping makes me proud.
---
same as LF
---
This is pretty funny.
---
Ty man
---
Pallets leaned up like this at the workplace are actually an OSHA violation lol.
---
Lol I usually do but before I get to them, the killer oftentimes has already kicked the hatch. Then maybe 1/4 the time I’m actually able to open it.
---
When she doesn't have Corrupt Purge, loop her like a M1 killer. When she has Corrupt Purge, use high walls loops against her and stun her with a pallet. A stun with a pallet remove her Corrupt Purge. Or you can just hide when you hear the Ding Dong that alert you that she has Corrupt Purge.
---
Imma cast expecto patronum with a flashlight
---
Sounds OP
---
This one. This is it
---
I would tunnel and camp anyone who played him lmao
---
Wraith needs some actual scary skins like this one! Amazing job I hope to see something like this in the game.
---
Ash mains unite
---
Solid play...what did you want him to do OP?
---
Update: Called it an abuse because that's how many survivors see it. I myself don't see it as anything wrong
---
Thank god this is happening. While I do like the buff and want to see it in action. His perks need help too many people have gone over how they can be useless or can be replaced by a better perk and half the reason I get killers is for perks. Even if the buff and killer is good the perks just make me feel like I'm getting less for my moner
---
If they’re being toxic then I’ll slug for it but if not I’ll respecc the last escape
---
360 view all the time, a panoramic camera
---
It could be like alien isolation. Imagine just seeing the Clown staring at you through the vent
---
*Scooby-Doo chase music plays*
---
On the bright side it's coded well enough that it doesn't let you drop forever and knows to respawn you. That honestly shows really good design, despite the missing patch of ground.
---
The only issue with Friday the 13th is getting the rights every time they want to add something being skins,characters and even maps. For DBD case they got the rights for the killers/survivors but it's a give and take situation every time they add anything that is licensed for that character. Same thing for Friday the 13th since its primarily focused on that movie and franchise so it kinda sucks that Friday the 13th doesnt get any super major updates because of rights.
---
Is there any duration of it? Like 1 minute or? Thanks for help.
---
Im sure its from fnaf balloon boy
---
*angry comment*
---
He will cost 9k Auric Cells so around $5.
---
Glados killer and Rattman survivor
---
Why waste moris on rankresets tho, that's just stupid
---
They did buff I'm all Ears. It now activates for rushed actions within 48 meters of you, rather than outside your terror radius.
---
"You got the buff you dont need it"- Wife
---
Not going to address the rest of it, but the pig could have been using dark devotion or tinkerer, for example.
---
The holy trinity
---
Doesnt it start 8pm est tomorrow rather than today?
---
So much yes!
---
I need this now
---
Yes, preach
---
*starts brooming* just a normal day of DBD *sigh*
---
&gt;It is 100% political, don't try to lie otherwise so you can excuse it. LGBT pride has to do with LGBT rights. And that is political. Period.
---
It has to do with LGBT people not being apologetic about who they are.  There are right-wing gay people (as delusional as they probably are) who celebrate it, some of whom are not even in favor of their own rights.  It is not political.
---
&gt; I also don't like how there isn't a White History Month. We have many cultures of our own, yet only one race gets a special month-long holiday just for them.
---
because black Americans are one culture, they aren't Congolese-Americans, as they can't trace their ancestry back.  March is both Irish-American history month as well as Greek-American history month, June is Caribbean-American history month, July is French-American history month, etc., etc.  Your ignorance is really staggering, "white culture" is not really a thing in the same sense historically.
---
&gt;You are literally giving the clear signs that you are a SJW. Going through my message history is one. "lolol" is another. "Toxic-ass" specifically as well. "-ass" is something I've seen from Millennials.
---
Again, you're trying to reduce everyone down to a caricature because it's easier for you to just do that than look at the substance of peoples' arguments, which is the only reason I stated what I did to you, using your own strategy against you.  You even use the term "problematic" which associated with SJWs, despite no one here using that word once, myself included.
---
&gt;This also isn't apolitical, the image from the OP literally has the word "liberal" in it.
---
You're the one who made the Scream/Brenda thread political.  You did exactly what you accused others of doing.
---
&gt;"Unreasonable" Yeah, you think facts I've stated otherwise is insane and irrational because it's not politically correct. Biology is anti-LGBT for you all, after all.
---
You haven't said anything factual.  Gender identity is not a biological concept, it's a social, cultural, psychological one.  You're thinking of sex, and despite what you may believe, modern science does not accept them as synonyms.
---
&gt;Also, nice! Using slurs now, now I KNOW you're a SJW! They all want to kill white people after all, figures you have no respect for Caucasians as well!
---
"Slur"?  The same as you hurling "SJW" at people with reckless abandon?  And no, "mayocide" is a joke, nobody's looking to kill white people.
---
I don't see why you looking for girl dick would irk me, friend.
---
I think most killers are satisfied with having a chance at winning
---
agreed. There are so many killer perks / items that i just don't know or can't remember, i just assume all of it is legitimate.
---
Ghostface is too powerful after the buff. This is the devs’ last attempt to write their wrongs.
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
I think it starts at 0:00 UTC Friday, which is 8pm EST Thursday. I found this countdown on a post earlier today, so I totally may be wrong but I’m fairly sure.
---
I appreciate this clone high reference &lt;3
---
This pmuch. If you can get away, good on you. If you don't.. good on me.
---
Honestly i'm happy with hooking everyone and a 3k, so if the last one slips out... whatever. 
---
If i find that hatch though.. i'm closing it.
---
Fortunately most retail establishments don't give a damn - one store in the area calls all the others when the inspectors drop by so they have plenty of time to clean up, and since they have to ask for permission to check the back you'll usually find the basics checked (they'd just say the inspector is here over the radio or something) in a crackdown.
---
They might get a minor fine but they don't care, mine left the emergency exits blocked all the time; ladders and shopping carts up front, freight in the back, janitor carts at the sides.
---
I guess you're playing as the All Spark. The very foundation of life itself. Should be an easy game.
---
Everybody saying don't cleanse but that isn't always true. Cleansing is fine sometimes it's just a judgement call as to when is the right time to do it.
---
But I want it and I want it now!
---
Not normal on console in case you were wondering.
---
I think they mentioned that some adding don’t have correct descriptions at the moment.
---
I hear ya, Ive played with MoM a bit and see how powerful it is, especially with multiple people running it in a match. I bought ash because I love evil dead and I'll gladly continue playing with ash regardless. I just find it disappointing to see the protection hits specifically because I wont run MoM at all like that.
---
Separately, I would have liked for active MoM to have the survivor revealed to the killer regardless of health state. And I'd have liked to see ash's other two perks get a bit of a buff. I agree MoM was too strong  and definitely needed to be knocked down a few pegs, but I can't help but feel like I'll never want to run any of ash's perks now which I find a bit sad.
---
Extremely unsafe. next to it there is just a pillar, killer can get around it pretty easily.
---
You can travel through walls but you have to recover after a while &gt;_-
---
Loading into a game with 3 people can still happen rarely due to a bug cuausing the match cancel not to trigger if they dc just at the right time as game transitions, its not exploitable or predictable by killer in the same way that 2 killer games happen sometimes, nobody caused it, just the game shit itself and now you have to deal with it.
---
Sounds interesting, but if it works outside of being the last remaining could be a very aids perk to play against
---
When a girl have a bigger bulge than you
---
This particular totem spawn that OP posts looks 200% better than most of my totem spawns.
---
I guess I never really thought of that.
---
Any perk that gives you additional map/team information is strong in DBD. Bond, Spine Chill, Empathy, Windows of Opportunity, Object of Obsession, Aftercare, etc. can be insanely powerful if you know what to do with the information the perk is giving you.  Some are stronger than others, but they all have a place among what I would consider "strong" perks.
---
I like how he looks at the bloodweb like “wtf?”

There was one case like that where when I was playing the cannibal I was just doing my daily then letting the survivors go. Then this 1 survivor with a TTV name, he was toxic beyond imaginable while his other friends were ok. He trashed me so hard after letting them go. The next match I got paired with him. Mori him early let the other 3 go. This went on for like 4 games until he went ape crazy lol.
---
I'm fine as long as I get 2 kills, I count it as a tie.
---

---
I am here and I am very angry!
---
I cant wait to use my pumpkin candy as a weapon and start killing survivors. This movie feels so underrated sometimes.
---
The real buff survivors need.
---
I’m just gonna head on killers and then look back at them until the stun is over 😂
---
Just like you aren’t entitled to escape. Just saying
---
You should summit this in the DBD fan art contest to get it in game
---
Also the Killer has cleansed all four medical cabinets that the survivors have to collect Adrenaline from in order to activate the perk.
---
I love how the camel just kept going like ingame the scratches are still shown so you still think the survivor is still running.
---
That's everyone's defense because it's true, how is a killer op if they are subject to the issues that killers have to deal with- pallets and windows? He is a pretty strong killer, but op is a stretch. Against good survivors id actually argue that hag and spirit are better than him since good survivors will almost never let you chainsaw them (unless you are running insta saw) or will let you chainsaw them but lose a couple of gens in the process (speaking from experience). Most of the maps in the game are large as fuck as well so his map control is more needed than op. 
---
They haven't really reworked or removed most of the broken loops, they're all still in the game. Ironworks of misery window,torment creek god window, God bus on autohaven wreckers maps, coal tower window, grim pantry boat, badham preschool and Haddonfield houses of pain, the cowshed in fractured cowshed, the infinite window of rancid abbatoir, the disturbed ward middle, Haddonfield in its entirety, mothers dwelling God window, suffocation pits God window, the shop in wretched shop and more. Entity blocker has also been bugged for a while so there's that as well. 
---
People in high ranks already play Billy all the time and it's just not fun to play him or play against him all the time. A lot of us love to play trapper, freddy, wraith and other weaker killers. MoM ruins that experience even more
---
I don’t think I ever ate dirt as a kid. I was just making an Over the Hedge reference

Gotta get the Engineers Toolbox + Socket Swivel too.
---
It doesn’t read well. Gives away the punchline before you even get to the joke. It would probably work better if people flipped the photo.
---
I’m pretty sure anniversary event starts on the 18th after the Bloodhunt event.
---
And after 30 minutes of wait, you run into fuckers thinking that running object of obsession or rpine chill is funny.
---
Sounds like a glitch
---
Walmart is kinda anal about it.  At least the one I used to work at.  The one I'm at now doesn't seem to care all that much.
---
Have no idea who this is
---
Oh, thanks for the info then. Glad to be corrected as would have missed a full day of the bonus as been taking a break from game until it starts and then plan to get the grind on.
---
/S

I’m sick of seeing posts like this that are just made to divide us

Sackboy? From lbp???
---
It's back online!
---
you can't simply get rid of it. the game split the community in half, made them fight, and gave them a lot of bullshit things to armsrace eachother. some people use them which makes the other side also use them which makes those who don't use them complain which makes people fight even more. if you remove those things, game'd become boring for many people so it's here to stay.
---
Why it there to make people leave the match

Its online bud
---
End game collapse? But it's so easy to avoid? Never been killed by that ever
---
I agree. I don’t think it should be useable until you’re the last.
---
People playing F13, ha. Also, people playing DBD, HA.
---
So there's a Bloodhunt this weekend?
---
Any time 😊
---
yeah but it's right outside the exit. also this killer was kinda camping around that spot and another door opened but I couldn't find it after circling around the map
---
you're not entited to 4e too. people keep diving the hook in the end-game vs noed tho, turning a 1k into a 4k and being like "oMg nOoB kIlLeR 4k ThAnKs To NoEd"
---
Because they made Legion slower in every other way for no reason. Feeling sluggish is stupid when agility is the fantasy of the character.
---
There's no one to blame for you dying to EGC except for yourself chief
---
I remember working on set for this, Quinn was super creepy walking jump scaring people in the costume.
---
I miss teh Myers music from tier 1
---
Outside the exit or in the bit before you leave? If it's there, the whole point of that is to stop people from sticking around to lock the killer and to stop survivors taking the game hostage. The alternative here is the killer stays there for half an hour and you hide and wait for him to leave, which would just drag out games.
---
Sadly I haven’t seen any of the evil dead movies so I’m not a fan. With that, I’ve grown to hate Ash Williams because of MoM lol I groan every time I see him in my lobby because of the obvious impending MoM I’ll have to deal with. Hopefully the update changes balance it fairly for both sides
---
Duuuude this happened to me twice
---
The Netflix Effect
---
If someone turned an exit switch on, time should be boosted for just like 10 seconds.
---
Yep. Starts tomorrow (the 14th) and ends on the 18th.
---
Good to see the new Exorcist chapter is coming along nicely.
---
She even opened the door for us

If it's of zero use in the same two things why include it?

Makes me love him even more
---
I think it might be a typo in that it actually increases the time the survivor stays marked. 
---
Its rarer variation moderately increases the time a survivor stays marked so I believe it's just a typo. It's likely that its effect will be the opposite of what its description is in that it will slightly increase the duration of a marked survivor.
---
"worn by ghostface who wants to have his presence known" in the description
---
rip
---
What does Cleansing means? Like destroying totems or what?
---
There'd be translation issues for versions of the game that are in different languages.
---
When I read piercing I assumed her extra damage or splash damage hatchets
---
He's not even op, completely counter able, but not weak like he originally was where survivors basically controlled your power. He's strong but there is counterplay to him. Had fun playing as him and even more fun playing against him. Much more like the movies now.
---
Yeah, Corrupt Purge duration is 1 minute without add-ons. But she can get her Corrupt Purge back if you keep cleansing.

A similar description exists for the green variation of the Cologne type add-on suggesting the brown variation is the same add-on but weaker.
---
Yeah, they even made a movie about him
---
What’s happening I’m new....?
---
Lol, definetely can see that guy matching dbd's Killer personality. and I gotta say I really like the drawing.
---
Now I'm gonna be that guy, but the knife Ghostface uses is a buck 120. that curve near the tip shouldn't be there.
---
You have two mins to leave if you stayed and died it’s your own fault there are two exit gates.
---
The rando bystander is just like “nice now kiss” XD
---
Survivors better like playing against the doctor, cuz he's going to rake in the bp
---
I don't get how you're supposed to counter his instadown stalk anymore.  I looked straight at him from like 5 ft away and both times I got the exposed status?
---
That’s the hole that leads to The Backrooms
---
Back online now, happy hunting!
---
He looks kinda depressed like he didn’t gat a single kill on holloween
---
he stole it from a flea market because he collects knives and isn’t married to one style
---
The straw through the mask holes is hilarious
---
Amazing, I need it now!
---
yeah but the killer was camping near where the gate was for like 2/3's of the match and I couldn't find the other gate
---
People browsing forums for games they don’t even like just to be petty because their personal life is unsatisfying, HA.
---
Literally go around the map in one direction and you’ll find it you have no one to blame but yourself
---
Thank you ^_^
---
You disgust me.
---
Started watching a streamer playing the map and I thought it was the Freddy rework at first.
---
Playing both sides the mentality is the same. Playing killer is way more stressful than survivor so I get killers getting tilted just like survivors getting tilted but this one sided bullshit is fucking retarded. You know survivors are just as guilty of being entitled to escape as killers are.
---
When they always ask where is the killer, instead of how is the killer
---
This would actually make wraith scary

---
Get with a group of like minded players and play SWF. Unfortunately there is a lot of BM and toxicity in this game. Pay no heed and move on. Wish I could help more.
---
If you get killed when the timer ends, that's entirely on you.
---
It's not really a nerf tbh. As some have said if you need three hits to escape a chase unless your being tunneled (thats an exception) maybe uhhh get good
---
I swear to god, this along with shirtless Myers, Nea’s the killer, Dwight in a locker, and thicc Jane has to be the most overused DBD memes ever.
---
It wasn't like that at one point, you did use to fall forever. Was terrible for killer because if a survivor managed to glitch their way out they could force the game to go on forever.
---
What time does it start?
---
You've got me all hot and bothered now.
---
Nice! But where do you guys get that information from?
---
This is truer than it is funnier lol
---
Please dont.
---
Workplace Safety Chapter confirmed.
---
Shit that's a really good idea. Devs please
---
I agree with the reply, just run about and find the other gate, in 2 minutes if not more you had no idea where the other gate is? Besides at higher ranks most people 99% the gate if someone is on a hook.
---
bring enduring jfc lmao
---
but better to get the pallet hit u than respecting that shit

It's just not worth it

That one event was around August when DBD was free on PS4 but I have no idea what that event was because I only had just gotten the game at that time
---
It's actually great
---
The Store: Digital Style!
---
I agree with your thing, but seeing a silver gold and platinum post that's negative is... interesting.
---
You're not entitled to anything in this game, and you don't have to please anyone. But if you treat players like ass, then don't expect better from them
---
I did though :/ might've not seen it cause I was trying to not get caught by the killer since I was injured and it was the spirit
---
I love it when a plan comes together.
---
Yeah I pretty new too lol, from what I’ve learned so far it seems like there’s a lot of toxicity on the Reddit, especially when it comes to killer mains and survivor mains. Idk it’s all childish stuff but it ruins the fun of the game and community
---
Yea I mean I dont mean these perks are neccesarily bad they just definetly aren't meta you know? Like if you use this you lose something else that maybe would have helped more. It's the same thing with a lot of killer perks. There's plenty of perks that personally I dont think are that bad but they aren't meta so nobody runs them.
---
I had some connection issues the past two days, might be just the consoles (though I play on PS4) but it may just be your connection too

---
Holy shit I never thought of this, I can throw a pebble into a locker so that the killer will check it. Thanks! Will do this in future games ;)
---
Looks like a beating heart. Any sound with it? Weird..PC or console?
---
I know I’ve definitely been the last alive and immediately after the the hatch opens the killer shuts it then guards both gates and I can’t leave which is annoying, I’ve died that way a few times now from thirsty killers.
---
the dev stream a few weeks ago
---
If he's camping his totem, that means he's not patrolling gens.  I also think it's kinda weird that a killer isn't allowed to know what his own totems are. 
---
 You're already blowing a perk slot on it, and while knowing does promote camping... camping totems is a pretty ineffective strat for winning anyway.  But not knowing makes shit like Haunted Ground a total gamble if you're running it with other hexes.
---
I have all but the plague. Yes this includes Freddy, which is only possible after rank resets
---
Hear..hear!
---
A lot of people in the community have the "us vs them" mentality which makes it impossible for the person to see the issues that affect the other side. It also creates a pretty toxic mindset and a very biased point of view
---
Best totem spot
---
Mine has done this once as well.  Dunno what caused it but my menu was stuck like that until I relaunched the game.
---
Looks like you did a fantastic job...so you had NOED(1) and 2 other Perk (1) 's ..u could have had a 4th slot filled and you didn't. guy is just salty....must be tough to go thru life like that.
---
Shirtless Myers is a state beyond human comprehension, we mere mortals are not yet ready for him.

So pretty much every sub Reddit for video games

*Sad piano
---
Just be fucking sick.  She can't "block" shit.  Just do the damn gens.  Cleanse at endgame, or if you absolutely need to save and know she's near the hook... Otherwise, just ignore her power.  She's only OP vs people who don't really understand the game.
---
Close enough
---
It’s the 14th-18th
---
Not really since a lot of video games don't have 2 sides but yeah
---
Nothing is going to happen. Chill. Takes way more than one report for anything to happen to you or NOBODY would be able to play the game after about a week of playtime.

I'd love to answer your question but I literally don't understsnd it. What do you mean 'in the same two things'?

---
You said five blinks and a mori. Then just had to sprinkle face camping in then you said how face camping is useless to add with the other two.
---

---
I know Te Walking Dead Game has a really friendly community in reddit, but there’s always gonna be some bad apples in there. It’s partially why I don’t go on Reddit too often anymore
---
The level of details on this is incredible. Keep up the good work, because this is my favorite Wraith design idea so far.
---
It's less of an abuse and more of a one time off glitch. Plus people will report you for anything so bans don't happen  from little reports like that.
---
You’re right, he isn’t patrolling gens. That’s a valid argument. I just prefer it stays unknown so if they have a hex build, they gotta stay on top of them all. Just a preference. 
---
Also, it’s not really blowing a perk spot. Most the hex stuff is really good, it’s just that they have a counter.
---
This. Personally, I'd just like a way to influence where hex totems spawn manually, so that the killer can have control and the "I just spawned in and my ruin halfway across the map instantly died" problem goes away.
---
Your idea is still a decent one though. Would make running haunted grounds better, you'd know exactly which totem was the real one and would be able to generally keep survivors away from that area instead of having to gamble on them hitting a trapped totem instead.
---
Its rank reset, so a lot of veteran players are on low ranks and enjoy fucking around till they get back to higher ranks. Also Voicecom SWFs use this to bully nooby killers.
---
i have been waiting in the ptb for like 2 hours total to get a killer game as ghostface
---
someone please play survivor save me from this hell
---
...because it was a direct response to the comment about exploiting facecamping, 5 blinks and ebony mori...
---
I GOT A GAME AFTER POSTING THAT COMMENT LETS GO BOYS

---
If killer wasnt camping you shoulf have escaped, if the killer was camping you shoulf have gone for the other door. Also you're not supposed to escape 10/10 matches.
---
Shirtless Myers is Pay to win
---
🌈Doesn't mean i don't support gay people. Everyone who votes no is gae, gay, not gay, gay.
---
I used to run a four hex build on Spirit that definitely would have benefitted from knowing, but I never really checked my totems unless TotH went off.  I don't really have an issue with how it is now except when your Ruin spawns right outside their first gen.  I would rather they fix spawn locations first
---
how come only whiny ass survivor mains use this meme format???
---
Low lights is bugged. Her nose caves inward when doing certain actions.
---
Maybe you don't know but a normal person can answer a comment without be salty and without smash his keyboard even if he doesn't agree with that comment. Btw with your first comment you just acted like the typical kind of player that have a toxic behaviour for the entire game and then try to justify everything he does with things like: "you use ds so...", "you looped so I camped", "lol MoM and dead hard git gud" end so on. Both killers and survivor sides have good and bad perks and this post was not talking about that at all. One day you will realize that there something better than spread salt all around you.
---
What do you mean? If you are thinking that killers dont have a chance check out fungoose, amazing dbd streamer who uses NO ADDONS and is amazing, though he rarely plays killer nowbecause of 1 hr queue times, so check out past broadcasts
---
\-12? HA nearly at -30

I noticed that; I wonder if it triggers on Quick and Quiet?

This made me laugh way too hard

I don't understand why it's so fucking funny

I think it depends on the managers tbh

GlenOck's followers... To think, Pig mains are now fighting each-other... Think about that &amp; tell me you don't just wanna walk into the ocean

I am truly honored to be able to provide arousing material for you. Thank you for the pleasure.
---
I'd gladly pay for these.
---
First time?
---
Yeah the spawns can be pretty bad. I’m dabbling in killer off and on but I have never used TotH. Does it show which totem is being cleansed or does it just flash the perk to let you know that some totem is getting cleansed?
---
I'm not scared of being banned im just wondering what the level of severity of it is.
---
Until Myers stalks you. owo

Yay thanks everyone!!!

Happy Pride Month BTW
---
I thought of something that might help a lot of things: make it so hex totems don’t light up until they’re triggered. Assign them to a random dull totem like NOED. Did a skill check prompt? Hex lights up. Someone starts working on a totem? Thrill of the Hunt lights up. Hook a survivor? Devour Hope lights up
---
Imagine rewarding Killers for speedrunning games and doing the bare minimum interaction with Survivors.
---
Excuse you?
---
If anyone is gonna be Boulder McPunch, it's gonna be David!

That would be an easy skin on the trapper.

Had that happen once, with someone dropping all pallets and blocking me in when doing gens. I saw the piece of shit in a lobby later that night. I’m usually very fair and nice, but I played hag and a Mori just for him. I also let everyone go. 
---
He DCs BTW. https://youtu.be/8EcXr1bdiGk
---
Lol I thought this was another Keanu meme.
---
You nailed it! Well done!
---
It has an audio que and a tiny explosion at the totem location kinda like when someone messes up a gen.
---
I would choose Morbid Angel or Emperor. Or Steely Dan.
---
Oh god this explains so much...
---
Use the power of friendship
---
True, true.
---
Try a full hex build with Spirit and prayer beads and just snatch people off totems all day.
---
Ok I will
---
Run through the house. Maybe you get more nuggets to spawn.
---
It didn’t work
---
Looks like a grave warden from dark souls 3. Here from /r/all so I don't know dead by daylight
---
I am leveling my Spirit actually so thank you for the idea lol. But yeah, I prefer the not knowing which totem is which. But I wouldn’t hate the idea of letting the killer know.
---
No it isn’t. He can tbag faster, making him better.
---
As a survivor main, I still totally agree lol
---
It doesn't seem to be much in the killers favor or to the survivors detriment, unless the survivors just can't play around Ruin at all.  So I don't think it would alter the game all that much if the killer knew which was which.  And like OP suggested, if the perk just flashed or something as you got near the totem, it would keep the killer from just instantly running to their Ruin if they are running multiple hexes.
---
please tell me you submitted this
---
Jason X makes me *so sad* because he and his map were both so close to being complete.

How many times did you "accidentally" abuse it?

I don't play mk11 but what could people possibly complain about? Mkx was very balanced and fun so I'd imagine mk11 is the same?

*Than.
---
And please dont get mad. Im helping you. No reason to get mad.
---
Also Ghostface can tbag faster, making him the superior croucher.
---
Who'd knew I'd learn about OSHA and pallets stacking from DBD haha
---
And I'll kill you that way
---
What, you don’t do both? How can you truly mindgame if you don’t play both?
---
Ready for this.......the female characters don’t show enough skin. That’s literally complained about almost everyday it’s pathetic.
---
I play mainly leatherface when I do play killer, because of BBQ, and sometimes I do pretty well without camping. But he is definitely nothing special and is easier to use if you just forget he has a chainsaw haha
---
But then they’d only be temporary, right?
---
What in the fuck.... people complained in mk9 that the female characters are oversexualized and show too much skin
---
Identity 5 is pretty fun though. The blind survivor makes the game so intense. All mind games and lack of information makes it quite tense
---
You know what, I have a solution for your problems: Wake Up!. Now stop complaining.
---
If you had none, you'd dc lol
---
He deleted his comment in shame
---
well technically...
---
Unironically love this
---
*depressed organ*
---
This would become the best skin in the game
---
imagine old exhaustion w/ sprintburst on killer
---
Might be a nat type issue?
---
Wait a minute... Storefront, shopping cart, And a pallet!? Dear god RUN GHOSTFACE IS NEAR YOU! I hope you weren't a cashier.
---
The fuck are pallets?
---
Imagine if they made a ghost face movie??
---
yeah totems are far too good in DbD. /s
---
Or a trappers trap
---
 Aas
---
Pretty much, but even more, calling yourself awesome for winning in such a manner would really make them mad as fuck.
---
Actually I think I'm gonna use that quote when I get called great/awesome/etc. in a sarcastic manner in the chat.
---
No. You're meant to hear a heartbeat, but now they just play loud, annoying music that makes it impossible to tell where the killer is.
---
Ironworks of misery window be like
---
I would want this just to spook other surviviors...
---
🔥
---
What exactly is the Killer Instinct effect? Something to do with auras right?

Okay now this, this I just love. This thing looks really alien, and it just looks too cool.

Well, at least they know them.

DJ KHALED - suffering from success
---
I found his channel when he uploaded a clown video. I immediately thought to myself after watching the video "he probably has like 250k subs, how did I not hear of him?"
---
Was surprised by the actual sub count but loved the content!
---
should replace "rich" with "op", its worth the misquote
---
Bill is from left 4 dead right? Isn't that also on consoles anyway?
---
From the beggining it was harder to get them.
---
Maybe David's was the hardest survivor's to get, (and i got it in a really dramatic way) but even before the 4ks was harder than surviving.
---
anyway, since it is not necessary to anything, I say you take it with pride that you managed to get those killer's adept achievements.
---
\*Survivors finish the gens\*  
---
"Why did boss music start playing?"
---
Which the devs intended. Unless they broke audio again, which isnt particularly unlikely, but I haven't noticed it any more than usual. It cant be adjusted the same reason FoV cant be adjusted. It would give people who didnt do it a disadvantage. The devs feel the music is fine, I feel the music is fine. Not arguing, I'd love to br able to turn music down, but music also gives cues to how close the killer is, and if you are in chase, etc. Imo, I get more info from the music than the heartbeat, but that's probably because i play more killer so i dont listen to a heartbeat usually anyway. I also play huntress so i may just be used to annoying pointless noise.

Yup
---
So controversial yet so brave
---
Bamboozle is a lifesaver
---
Meg looks like she would shoot herself on her foot.
---
I think its a lot harder to break him out of his power now but I really appreciate his buff. Definitely a good strong killer. Probably a Top tier with hillbilly and nurse
---
Your grind will be massive tomorrow if you want the BP bonus
---
What does DC mean in DBD?
---
They’d never go for it because of the creator
---
What's PTB?
---
Someone in the community down voted me everytime I make a post for whatever reason.
---
I had a killer body block staircase of basement as Wraith so nobody can could escape if they were to rescue. He never uncloaked but sat there
---
Been trying to get a match as host face for 30 minutes now. Think I'll be watching someone else play as him instead
---
I'm assuming where it will be like Doc where the addons are what makes or breaks him as there is likely an addon to make it faster or more subtle.
---
*Salty response to angry comment using entitlement more than facts*
---
Yeah I just googled him, welp there goes that idea
---
Enduring+spirit fury work well, and bbq for that intel and juicy bp. Nurse's Calling works in her favor because of her stealth, so pair that with sloppy butcher.
---
On my piggy, I have an Endgame/ignore obsession build; Rancor, Stbfl, Noed, and Im using bbq cause I don't got bloodwarden
---
Gespenst Gundyr
---
Unfortunately yes they did.
---
They also reduce their vault speed as well
---
Or ya know when the killer is an asshole and keeps you there until it runs out
---
gay because I even looked at this image
---
I one trick killer and only occasionally play survivor so I guess I don’t get a say in what needs to be balanced 🤣
---
With a buttery smooth 12 fps.
---
disconnect
---
What is lag switching?
---
No it would, you gave me an example of someone who doesn't look behind himself AS MUCH but he still does.
---
It would drastically lower the skill ceiling for sure
---
lmao
---
I laughed to much at this
---
Public Test Build
---
Ah
---
Thats why I threw in "add a few hooks and BBQ" Legion can get mid 20k easily at most doubling it to 40k or so with BBQ
---
Oh ok
---
"You wanted scary?"
---
"This will do."
---
They REALLY buffed him now... He can control the very fabric of space!!!
---
can the nurse blink down there?
---
Yeah - i mean it's hard to tell how you "Win" as a Killer.
---
As a survivor, if you escape, just you, *you* "win". 
---
As a Killer, well... it's open to interpretation.
---
I’d honestly love it as killer because it would be such a worthless survivor perk. They’d have to waste a perk slot on it
---
true, the buffs allow him to at least get some stalking off, but it really isnt all that strong.
---
Also, the Patch Notes said that stalk progress doesnt deplete anymore, but it still does
---
Good neutral reply, but I wasn’t trying to make a noed statement. I just picked three things that I see survivors complain about in post game chat.
---
do you get any error Message?
---
That's so you have to focus. It's also why the music in chase is loud, so survivors and the killer in chase can't hear other stuff so easily.
---
This is the first meme in a long time to make me laugh out loud
---
Or go to the other exit gate
---
Micheal: Jason what are you doing?
---
Jason: nothing, just chillin, killin
---
You literally have 2 minutes + any slowdown to leave, your fault for sticking around long enough for the timer to finish.
---
Do I even need to say it? Nea is the real killer.
---
Yeah and he originally was going to be in the game as well. Feelsbadman
---
It’s always yellow rank players that I see act like this... maybe I’m wrong but that’s all I see on here
---
Your girlfriend is a killer? Goddamn.
---
this is supposed to be making fun of killers right? because if it's supposed to be killer sided, you kinda messed up considering the original context
---
Probably the meta M1 build. BBQ/Ruin/Spirit Fury/Enduring
