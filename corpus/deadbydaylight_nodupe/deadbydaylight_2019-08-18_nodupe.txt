Stranger Things is as big, if not bigger, than Game of Thrones.
---

---
Everyone knows this show. So yea a Stranger Things chapter would be the best thing to ever happen to the game, popularity wise.
---
---
---
Pretty sure the "lore" takes the backseat in these scenarios.
---
Im all ears beats quick and quiet and dance with me
---
Tremors stops gen progress and lets you know where people are
---
Furtive chase is kinda meh but helps with mind games and combos with other perks nicely (remember me being my first thought) 
---
None of which I would say are unusable
---
Hope fully the maps indoors. I feel like we don't have many of them
---
&gt;hecking
---
   
---
YOU SWORE!!!
---
I've gotten every adept since they made it harder on my first try, except Plague which took 2 or 3 tries. If you're having trouble derank to 15 or w/e.
---
I'm at 97% trophy completion, most trophies are boostable with some patience and late night gaming sessions.
---
Report and send the pic, it’s an easy ban.
---
Was a joke anyhow. I agree he obviously should not be the character~
---
Everyone would go back to the game if they hear about so I hope ppl make a big deal of it, as to make memes in normal subreddits and maybe make it to hot, ima try when I get enough karma (I alredy have 457 karma and can’t post yet)
---
well should have hooked the dude.. sluggers get punished is todays lesson my dude
---
No, you even said yourself your friends would DC for this, so its not a one time thing, you're disagreeing with yourself, and now suddenly you agree dcing multiple times is bannable and you dont even need to report for it. Yes, you dont, reporting is for things such as verbal abuse, you can also report for dcing, but it wont matter. Unless you keep getting the same killer/swf team who dc, then it actually does. Its there for context, but whatever.
---
Please no.  We have too many tards playing this game as is.  People who like Stranger Things are braindead.
---
How do I upvote more then once?
---
I think (?) the devs have said something about once dedicated servers hit, survivors' bodies will become "husks" that will be hookable if they DC.
---
I blame Otz
---
mmMMMMMMMMMMMmrmrmrmrmrmmrrrrmmmm
---
Thank you!

Wait till you learn about mirrors
---
Nice alt scott
---
What trio even is this
---
This is my post though

---
Oh, so I was right. Thank God, this has been needed for quite a while now.
---
Oh my god, well done.
---
I'm sure that turned that Trapper's frown upside down.
---
well its pretty much fully confirmed at this point, so good luck with that.
---
Yeah, the survivors I play against loop. And maybe it helps with mind games, but it has a chance to help with 1 mind game every 40 seconds. Like I said, the perk concept is fine, the 40 second cooldown is ridiculous.
---
*X-Files theme intensifies*
---
Yea but Billy didn't kill anyone in the season so i don't know how it will fit
---
You are right, and the main reason for that is due to how much more current stranger things is than their other licenses.
---
Not to mention that (if the rumors are true) survivors' bodies will become "husks" and remain hookable, thus forcing them to accept that no, the DC button's purpose is *not* for stuff like this.
---
Again Wtf. This whole thread is about the person in this clip getting banned for DCing. It may be the only time hes ever done it. If he did it 50 times he would get banned. He wouldnt get banned for abusing the hatch, hed get banned he repeatedly disconnected, which is against the rules. The sole act of DCing for hatch is not. How are you not getting this
---
It would if they devs didn't give survivors a month and a half to make it to the exit gates during the collapse. The collapse is literally worthless unless you
---
A) spend the entire time taunting the killer far away from the gate 
---
B) open the gate when someone is getting hooked then mount an overzealous rescue operation that collapses because the killer just keeps hooking people
---
Honestly would it seriously harm the game if they actually put some real time pressure on survivors during the collapse?
---
As if the reason people have issues with SWF is because random ass strangers are playing with their friends.
---
I didn't say only for mind games.
---
It's more to get those fricking P3 Claudettes. 
---
Those motherfrickers.
---
Probably another teaser on 21st? Followed by PTB on 27th. Two weeks of PTB and release on 17th?
---
Oh god please no, every single indoor map so far is complete cancer to play in. The Game is bad for survivors unless they are coordinated or all have balanced landing, and the Insitute is horrible for more most killers besides for certain niche builds.
---
**cries in Barbara**
---
I'll take the post down so they don't get hate, but I'll make sure to report them, thank you!
---
Im not saying i dont want billy as a killer he could be  but in my opinion i would prefer the demigorgon
---
This happened to me once (dude didn’t close the door cause it’s impossible but anyway) I ran out of hatchets and I went to collect some from this locker that wasn’t too far away but not too close to this guy I had on the hook and I ended up catching some guy and hanging him on hook near the locker.
---
Decades pretty much untouched. Stranger things is new and actually out there.
---
Thrilling Tremors us pretty good and I'm all Ears is actually pretty useful on Nurse.
---
Also, while Furtive Chase is not the most useful of perks, it does have some fun interactions in the game.
---
Amen to that.
---
It's not bigger than Game of Thrones. I haven't seen either show but Stranger Things is nowhere close to how popular and culturally significant Game of Thrones is.
---
The killer could definently be billy from the show, he could turn into the mind flare as his power
---
idiot killer should have made the least optimal play!
---
This is pretty funny lol but tbh Head On should really be fixed
---
It's not about if there are movies coming out. Halloween and Michael Myers are iconic. Getting the full license for Halloween was massive.
---
I would also prefer demogorgon, but even so, stating that something doesnt work simply because you dont want it, isnt really correct.
---
But they used the Laurie who was young and from the OG movie. She dies in a later part of the continuity.
---
I ran into this as survivor, we were solos. But instead of doing it the scummy way, the other survivor found me, lead me to the hatch, distracted the killer and let himself get hooked (he was on his last hook) and let me go. Mad respect for the survivor knowing that we lost and letting somebody else go.
---
That thing got beat up by a bunch of teenagers with baseball bats. I'd say it jobs just as well as all the other killers.
---
**Cries hard in Barb**
---
It has absolutely nothing to do with who started the argument, but okay.
---
But hey only time will tell
---
Absolutely! This happens every single time I work on a generator.
---
Ka Ka Kachi Daze
---
The problem with comboing Furtive Chase with Remember Me is you kind of want your obsession dead by the end of the game because the obsession is not affected by Remember Me.
---
Generators do not need any buffs right now...
---
Uh no they explicitly tell you to not waste their time reporting people for disconnecting. You are wrong on so many levels dude.
---
It very much has, google it, but okay. If you start an argument with statements you back them up with sources, aka. a picture of a dev stating dcing ISNT bannable, which he didnt do, but...Im not going any further into it since im speaking against walls here. Your theory applies to making a claim, his claim was the first which he didnt provide evidence for...soo. yeah. Totally logical
---
Lmao I love how useless this post is. They say they made a discord when one already exists and then they also don't even link the one they created.
---
Umm... ok?
---
[The official thread on the forum](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system) says to not report for DCs, so you're incorrect.
---
No probably because camping isn’t in any way frowned upon by the devs. It’s not cheating, he is doing nothing wrong
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There you go little one, these are the only subjects they will ask you to not report for. Everything else is reportable, otherwise it wouldnt be an option.
---
So toxic....so so toxic...why ruin the match for everyone else just because your game isn't going well ?..."if I cant rake in BP or pip...then I'll make no one else can either"...why...that's such a 9 yr old hissyfit way to play a game, dude...sabotage the game for the remaining survivors...thats like sitting on the floor of a store crying cuz your mom wouldn't buy you the toy you wanted, type of hissy fit...
---
Remove the slowdown during charge, and make it like Freddy placing traps, so he keeps bloodlust, then remove the cooldown on his chainsaw attack, so he can charge up over and over without stopping, unless he hits something.
---
His tantrum should work as an extension of his attack, so make him move a bit faster while freaking out.
---
We don't talk about Legion.
---
Barb may also be likely since she actually would be “lost” to the “entity” - the upside down.
---
Damn dude. So salty.
---
Shut it you paraphiliac! I know you have the Adiris lewds!
---
Carefull dont say you have a hard time killing survivors or the toxic claudettes will come out of the woodwork to call you trash XD
---
But I've yet to run into problems, obsession usually dying around second or third gen if you're doing a decent job at hunting them *shrugs*
---
YEAH WELL HE DIDN'T SAY HE WAS TRYING TO LEARN BUBBA AT RED RANKS, NOW DID HE?
---
It's not false; all the characters are flat and annoying, the plot isn't really all the unique and is cringe at best, and there isn't anything remotely scary about the series. It's really entertainment for small brains, but I suppose that fits with the majority of the dbd community.
---
What? House of Pain still exists, the two story is just as good as any house in Haddonfield, and the list of pallet spawns that can be mind gamed is ... Well, killer shack. If it weren't for the totem spawns DEEP in some of those hedges, they would be labeled as incredibly survivor sided
---
If it's the same survivor yes, I was talking about if the obsession keeps changing due to Furtive Chase.
---
I do NM, Resilience, iron will and UE. Works fairly well
---
WELL EXCUSE ME SIR that is both vulgar as well as obscene, you are a unsophisticated fool. I respect her as well as not being sexually interested in women, GOOD DAY SIR
---
It only feels like that because the other rank 12s and 13s youre getting matched with havent gotten back where they were before reset
---
Do you finally permanently lose those two pips now? For a while you got those pips back as soon as you relogged or played another game
---
If her power reduced her speed to 100 while morphed they could just loop her easier
---
Exactly the link I was about to send, so I approve.
---
Watch this video OP, and profit.
---
I swear, he kinda looks like a weird cat
---
Just Fucking kill me. I don't want to be in games where people disconnected.
---
Farm or not, it's not what I signed up for.
---
At this point in the game its not horror, its competitive Besides baby dweets who is afraid anymore?
---
YEAH WELL...UH....FAIR POINT BUT STILL FUCK YOU
---
You're not wrong there. At the same time though, it's probably the worst map for some of the best killers in the game, which is definitely something.
---
Stranger things dlc is coming
---
No lmao I de-pipd I should’ve kept doing that gen
---
get spirit. use prayer beads. freak people out.
---
Lol, where is your proof that there are cheats on console? Or are you one of those players that think Nurse's Calling is a wall hack? :)
---
I really hope the survs are hopper or Steve. I feel like billy would be cooler than the demogorgan because he has a personality
---
My daughter used to do that ...she knows better now...her gameplay has matured ...she's 10 years old.
---
If it is on PS4 then the only reason I can think of is he either intentionally stalled the game by body blocking or he quit too many times.
---
Im sorry your daughter has a parent that teaches her to take games that serious.
---
Keys are awesome!
---
My personal opinion, depending on what you’re looking for. PS4 player here myself so forgive me if I listed anyone you have already. (: 
---
Hag - Tier C - Fun 2/3 - Perks 2/3
---
Plague - Tier B - Fun 1/3 - Perks 2/3
---
Huntress -	Tier B - Fun 2/3 - Perks 1/3
---
Doctor - Tier D - Fun 1/3 - Perks 2/3
---
Cannibal - Tier D - Fun 1/3 - Perks 2/3
---
Pig - Tier C - Fun 3/3 - Perks 2/3
---
Clown - Tier C - Fun 2/3 - Perks 2/3
---
Spirit - Tier A - Fun 3/3 - Perks 2/3
---
Nightmare - Tier B - Fun 2/3 - Perks - 2/3
---
I’m sure people will disagree on points on that, of course, but that’s my general opinion.
---
If you like mobility and mind gaming, try out Spirit. She’s an absolute blast. 
---
Huntress, Doctor, and Cannibal often struggle on console but can be good with practice, especially Huntress. Cannibal’s BBQ and Chili perk is worth the purchase alone, if you ask me. If you’re a killer main, it’s practically essential. 
---
Plague is okay at certain ranks. I know another person said you don’t see much of her and that’s definitely true. She can be very powerful with one caveat: if survivors choose not to cleanse (red/purple ranks usually), you may have a tough time. 
---
Freddy was horrid for a long time but his rework has made him quite strong. Good mobility and abilities, especially with an add-on that gives him fake pallets. He also has some good mindgame potential with fake gen teleports.
---
Pig has really not received a lot of love from the devs and while she used to have a strong endgame, that’s toast now. Still, she deserves an oink as I love playing her. The potential for spooks is there, and if you like Myers, you may want to try her.
---
Boo, Stranger Things sucks, please give something else.
---
Yarp
---
Why you look so angry? I’m talking about BP/Prestige/Legacy hacks. Fuck off with this “angery” mate. And I main Nurse lol
---
No there isnt anything that is concrete yet its just all speculation leading up to the new chapter its just more of a waiting game right now probably in the upcoming days or weeks someone will hear something more on it or people will find files in the game.
---
give bloodhunt
---
That tweet from Netflix isn’t concrete? Lol
---
Not a lot of options but given what you have... try BBQ, Knock Out, Third Seal, and maybe Deerstalker or Sloppy Butcher. The hex totem is a gamble but you could cause a lot of frustration with all that aura blocking and leaving guys on the ground. Just make sure to watch those gens, as smart survivors will try to rush you. (;
---
or when i take off plunderer and ace because i’m sick of having good ass killers fuck me in my butt cuz i don’t have 2 perks only to find it’s a baby huntress
---
Sloppy or Thrilling Tremors over Unrelenting for sure. If you have Enduring unlocked as a teachable, it pairs well with Spirit Fury.
---
Dang, my computer can’t handle graphics that nice :(
---
Well not exactly, the pic just kinda reminds me of someone
---
I'm always willing to play with people even though I mainly play killer. :)
---
&lt;3
---
If the survivor(s) isnt Mother steve or Hopper ima head out.
---
Surprisingly? He’s licensed, what did you expect?
---
Cutie cutie cunt cunt
---
in that case I think Hopper would definitely sell the best/be the most popular, but I have a feeling we’re getting Steve.
---
If you play Myers, I highly recommend getting the plague just for her perks. Corrupt intervention is also a good perk for him to slow down early game so you can get some stalk.
---
Lol i dont have cells just shards i cant get him
---
use interview tape with green electrode to snipe people from across the map
---
Ok, but that’s completely unrelated to what I typed
---
I do have enduring, guess i gotta wait for it in the blood web. Thanks!
---
Platform: Xbox One
---
Type of Bug: Ingame
---
Description: For the entire trial, you are unable to use self-care to heal, unable to recover yourself while on the ground, unable to wiggle while the killer is carrying you, and unable to use either of the two emotes
---
Steps to reproduce: Happens at random, potentially ruins game
---
Expected result: Actually play the game
---
Actual result: Can't play the game
---
Reproduction rate: 0
---
If you want an in-game reason that kinda ties into both the show and the game you could say that Hopper survives Season 3 by escaping into the rift (which btw is totally what happened), but that instead of the rift leading into the Upside Down it lead to the Entity’s Realm.
---
I feel like at this point they’re just fucking with us

What does this even mean
---
Sometimes they will be obvious...sometimes not...how it's supposed to be ...wouldn't be that fair if it was well hidden everytime I suppose
---
i feel like it's only useful on Lery's tbh
---
That's what you get for not giving the hatch. /s
---
Trust me, there's is not enough players on both sides, especially on Console. With the amount of players we have right now, there shouldn't be 2 modes for a while in this game.

---
If we're talking about viability, then prayer bead spirit, Omega blink/2+ blink nurse, instasaw billy, iri head huntress, body blocker hag, etc are far and away better than scratched mirror Myers. This build really only shines because of Lery's and even then Myers can't commit to chases. Infinite IW3/tombstone &gt; scratched mirror.
---
It's still a super fun build.
---
Apply directly to the basementt
---
All that does is clog up the report system with nonsense. I’m honestly shocked the amount of people that think this is a bannable offense, insane. It goes down as a DC for them and that’s it. Show me in the rules where it says disconnecting to give hatch is a bannable offense. It’s not. In fact, it specially says do not report disconnects. It makes no difference the manner in which the DC takes place.
---
In future, please do not state that there is cheating on console with no proof of it existing. Thanks.
---
They said tunneled not camped
---
My personal opinion. The only thing they need to change is to bring back being able to damage the bleed timer. Gutting the ability to moonwalk people was neccessary, no more blood tracking was kind of mean but best make sure I guess, but removing legions last play strategy that actually uses his/her power was just uncalled for.
---
Or sorry read the replies to other comments....
---
Escaped in the exact same way on this exact map in that exact hatch spawn.
---
it def raises some eye brows, But its 100% posted just to fuck with us
---
And here comes another... hahaha
---
Sometimes the entity just wants his sacrifice that bad. No I'm just kidding, this happened to me before. It really sucks because you are super excited that you live just to get that big slap in the face. That bug has been around for a little while.
---
I wish they’d just do all three but maybe that’s too greedy? Lmao add the science teacher so you can have a full team against demogorgan killer.
---
Halloween
---
I def wold much rather have DBD funko then the other brand they are selling, it would be amazing to go 2 a store and walk home with a huntress/nea figure (Will prob only be the most popular killers/survivors at the start)
---
I would love a spirit or Hag funko lol
---
Entity literally went "Nahh"
---
I honestly dont get why people watch that a hole
---
If you went out there and asked what people thought of Freddy Kreuger, they'd have something to say. If you went out an asked people what they thought of demogorgons, they'd look at you like you were high.
---
Weren't Demogorgon Humans shown in the last post credits?
---
[deleted]
---
Add me Onedart-1kill. Rank 8 rn, but I'll teach you the new metas and stuff if you want
---
I mean yeah. Put on a s tier killer. All power is yours now.
---
I actually had a game against a nurse just yesterday, that had me screaming at the screen. My teammates kept running in 3-4 seconds after she would blink away after hooking me. Waste of a cake
---
This was possible when the game first came out. Everyone knows this just wont work
---
Hope to Christ that whatever it is is a full chapter.
---
Dlc gets them more money and brings more attention to the game. So while I agree with you, it might not happen soon.
---
Yeah, literally as killer you could just follow someone who immediately throws down pallets instead of looping, and if you broke them all the game would already be over by the time you're done.
---
I hate The Game FAR more than I hate Lery's, mainly as a Trapper main.
---
Lery's sure, your traps are obvious as shit, but there are a lot of walls you can hide them around and make it too late for survivors to see them and force them to take a hit. Also lots of very, very, very tight spaces for traps to go.
---
The Game is really wide when you want it to be thin, and the only thin places where you can place traps are blatantly obvious areas that one can usually go around if the RNG favors them. Otherwise, the traps are impossible to place at any pallet because any survivor with more than 5 IQ points will simply just walk past them. You cannot hide your traps as easily, and while it's very fun to trap survivors in the bathtub room, that's just about it.
---
Oh okay. I saw it on google and wanted to upload it here. My apologies
---
So much sodium chloride in the post game chat
---
You right
---
Hey don't worry. Everyone has that one killer they just play bad against. I mean make many silly mistakes and Basically throw. For me I suck against clown
---
The survivor has to be adult/near adult so I put it as either Steve Hop or Joyce. I actually think Winona Ryder would be a good fit even though she isn't as popular as a character.
---
Please do share
---
Its just you, also if you get 4ked by NOED, you have only yourself to blame.
---
Updoot for accuracy
---
Glad you take such pride in not being able to develop a sense of taste on your own.
---
If you have a 3 man one of you can use small game. Its not that hard
---
You're supposed to remember what pallets are there and what pallets aren't in the real world. The dream pallets are supposed to force you to remember, or be punished by the fake out. It's a mental game.
---
I also find it great when I BT save the survivor after exit gates are open and tbag/heal at the exit all because the killer decided to throw their game and face camp one survivor and allow the easy 4 escape. 
---
Red Rank survivor/killer PC. It’s about teaching a lesson on keeping killers disciplined. Also makes for a great end game chat :D.
---
I don’t know, I would actually have to play with him to know but I’d say a little longer, as u said he had a stun of 1 second I would say 2-2.5 seconds or something like that, but other than that is a good concept
---
I do finish the game. By dying on hook and starting the next match. And I dont care about some childish person on the internet telling me how I play is wrong 
---
&gt;Moronic hook rescues are so awful.  I think people who do them end up never leaving their home town, still live with their mom and have ugly partners because they don't know how to do their own laundry or cook anything besides a can of Beeferoni... 
---
Yes, this is definitely a mature adult who is of sound self and mind with a child. How pitifuly sad. Goodbye
---
Man and I thought I played this game alot
---
You were exhausted for a second.
---
"Ada something something Mokuba!"
---
I do have a personal sense of taste. I just simply like something that a ton of other people tend to like as well. No big deal. Just because something is popular does not mean it lessens it. 
---
No need to act so cool, my friend. It's okay if you don't like it but it is by no means wrong or demeaning to like it.
---
level 40 is when the teachable unlocks and becomes available for everyones bloodweb
---
I'm actually talking about dbd mobile tho...
---
You could have baited that dead hard easy.
---
Ew gross. I’m sick of this strangerthings push on games. Go away I want good classic horror or dbd made killers.
---
Experiencing sexual pleasure from vomitting or watching others vomit
---
Yknow i always thought that big monster from season 1 kind of looked like the Entity thing that kills you when you get hooked
---
It’ll tell you on his character info screen
---
If someone face camps, they arent trying to care about rank. Also who cares LOL. But yeah dude, defend the toxicity... bastion of justice and something the community can look up to :)
---
If you bt save someone from a face camp and they are 1 for 1 worst case or more likely 1 for 2 , then maybe you're the one not disciplined🤔
---
looks like you didn't watch the vid properly pal
---
Where?
---
His attack is hime hopping in his car and just running down any survivors in front of him
---
You're pretty camo with a P3 Nea though?
---
A bit of a counter is to slug people instead of hooking them, that way you can put on real pressure(as for never catching anyone, usually swf will have 1 person who is only doing gens cause they suck at chases, so don't go for the people aggressively following you who are trying to bodyblock, go for the people running away, they're the easy downs.
---
Really not much you can do if you're not running like the top 3 killers with good perks, and maybe good addons though. You have to hope the survivors are bad. Also don't play for a few days after rank reset, you'll have a bad time.
---
Go to play as killer select leather face. On the right side of the screen it’ll say character info. Click on that
---
Woah this is cool!
---
Bug? More like a feature of the game these days.
---
I like to avoid sharing a gen if ruin is up
---
glad you like it brother
---
I doubt bhvr would do something to glorify actual serial killers.
---
Mine is similar but with the plaid skirt and the beanie.
---
In my case?
---
The Leatherface at the end explains it all lmao.
---
What if I want a *key*, Joe?!
---
OHMYGOD. LITERALLY TAKE ALL MY MONEY NOW!!
---
As much as I love the idea, I'm assuming that obtaining the rights to Dacre Montgomery's likeness would be really difficult. No offense to the modelling team but they haven't got a good track record of recreating actor's faces very well and unless they can hide Billy's face somehow I'm very much regretting how they will butcher his model.
---
Wouldn't feel that good if hitboxes weren't made for PG-13 barbie online game.
---
actually I think him being the billy is better
---
1. Scratch marks.
---
2. Sound.
---
3. There is a lot of line of sight, actually. There are some dead zones where it's difficult, like some bathroom loops, but the only thing to save survivors are unsafe pallets and a lot, a lot, a lot of windows. If you find a survivor, and aren't a newbie nurse, there isn't a lot they can do to escape you unless they're just plain better than you.
---
Never watched the show so I looked it up on YouTube and holy shit, yes please.
---
wait that's not a bad idea....it could be convoluted  but he does move bodies around in the movies in the right position to scare people
---
I upvoted for the title
---
Yessss

there is a shitpost tag.

I dont appreciate liars, but I'll make an exception for a fellow ash fan

It's fine to post spoilers just mark them. It's not hard to not be an asshole.

Iron Lungs perk will help with that

---
Second this. Lisa would be way scarier.
---
"Mootherr...."
---
Season 1 is amazing.
---
You can skip season 2 and just watch a summary or somethinf.
---
Season 3 is equally amazing as season 1
---
Okay the Dead by Daylight thing made sense but this is reaching
---
The game is already in beta in some countries,it hasn't been released global yet,[here's the link](https://www.mobile.deadbydaylight.com) of the website and for the gameplay.....just search it on youtube.
---
Yeah, I think Head On should give invincibility frames like DH.
---
Lol that one was comedic and I fully stand by it.  I perhaps should have thrown a "lol" in that one.   Stereotypes are what they are and I fully support anyone who describes one in detail for the sake of a laugh.  Nothing childish about it.  Referencing a comedic opinion in this context seems a bit of a reach.  But i will admit i do let my passion for fair, just, and honorable gameplay get the best of me at times.  To each their own in the end I suppose.  The DCers will keep playing their way and the rest of us will keep playing ours...we'll keep trying to help them get points and they'll keep trying to screw us out of ours ...I appreciate your honesty and candor if nothing else, it's all good...all I can do is keep trying to change the world one DCer at a time.  Happy gaming, good sir.
---
Does cannon *really* matter for dead by daylight though?
---
Spirit. If you get Pig pay money. Amanda needs to eat
---
You seem like a dick imo. What you are saying can be applied to a lot of things. Like if you don’t like fat people you are a malnourished, disgusting  human being :D. There’s nothing wrong with having preferences, as long as they aren’t unrealistic imo.
---
Lvl 40
---
My birthday is the 21st! Yayy
---
Dbd is competitive? LOL
---
If you face camp and you dont 1-1, you're garbage.
---
You question my rank but think it's easy to dodge grabs? How hard is it to wait for the midway point of the animation? Maybe against rank 15s?
---
Idk man, I think you're the one with the yikes opinions.
---
LMAO THE LEATHERFACE AT THE END
---
I mean it is watermarked
---
The animation makes it look slower but it's the same speed. I'm not sure if they're gonna update it to make it feel more smooth, but theyve done that with other things in the past.
---
I think maybe it looks that way because he's smaller. If Myers or Trapper or any of the other big bois and kicking something, it looks right b/c they have massive juicy thighs. Ghostface looks like he *should* be much faster at kicking, based on his size, so it looks weirdly slow when he does it at the same speed.
---
This is kind of like how people think shorter killers look like their lunge is further, even though it isn't, b/c of the height difference.
---
About every 7-9 weeks
---
me either. i mean, it's all 12 year olds who think being toxic is funny, but why they are that way... who knows.
---
This is so obvious by now.
---
Myers when he hits tier 3 while running tuft of hair
---
Lmao just curious how you can be level 47 and still run iron grasp and monstrous shrine.
---
I fucking love the side note
---
Trash? Lmao
---
How is it low quality lmao?
---
You... actually can wake eachother up? the only thing you cant do is wakeup via failed skill checks. That version of freddy isnt even a very good build.
---
I feel like there was a theory going around that the mind flayer was originally 1, the first superpowered child having far great powers and hateful of mankind after how the lab treated them.
---
Go to BHVR and submit that report ticket, you have the video evidence
---
play killer then
---
Borrowed time.
---
You can't wake up sleeping Survivors if you're asleep yourself.
---
&gt; Dbd is competitive? LOL
---
Both sides want to win... this makes it competitive.... and for some reason, you disagree with this?
---
&gt; If you face camp and you dont 1-1, you're garbage. You question my rank but think it's easy to dodge grabs? How hard is it to wait for the midway point of the animation? Maybe against rank 15s? Idk man, I think you're the one with the yikes opinions.
---
Wow you just said it all here, thanks man. Yes it’s easy to dodge grabs... because the killers that face camp are generally shit ranks. I’ve BT saved plenty without a trade off
---
because... the face camping baby killer doesn’t understand that BT is a perk.
---
I’m sure a high rank killer can get the 1:1, but I rarely see high rank killers throw their game because they got stunned by a pallet.
---
Also let my share a personal experience, I once got pallet slammed as killer early in game because I don’t respect pallets early on and hope that they get thrown down. The survivor t bagged me after stunning me. My reaction from that point was “I think it’d be smarter to break chase and pressure other survivors working on gens.” (I had already injured the initial survivor). I ended up securing the 4k.
---
But like I said, you’re free to throw your game and hold your borderline-terrorist like victim complex (“I must teach each survivor one-by-one” is what you said earlier....yikes). I never condemned you for it. So I’m not sure why you got so triggered and started throwing shade. (Though if a survivor spamming an inconsequential button fills you with rage, I’m also not too surprised.)
---
It is a good rework, it's just these add-ons are bullshit
---
Imagine combining with dying light and a mori.
---
I told him he looked like a Siamese cat in his chat once and he just sighed then laughed. Shortly after his initial face reveal. Lololol
---
Good to know, so go find an alarm clock and basically cancel his combination.
---
Exactly
---
Flayed Billy could also be the killer.
---
Nah, the game looks promising though.
---
You’re an moron,
---
It's a diversion for the upcoming Trick R Treat DLC.
---
Why'd you censor them? They kinda deserve to be put on blast lol
---
I swear to god if I don’t get chased by Hopper running NOED and playing Russian roulette on me while chasing me I’ll ask N. Korea to end life
---
Wish granted- DCing is now punishable via a tactical nuclear strike.
---
Just go to the nice noob friendly highlighted alarm clocks that you can see from anywhere on the map.
---
I don't think it's a good idea to take advice from someone who doesn't even understand the mechanics in play....
---
But, just this once, I'll say great, you took the time to run the entire length of the map to get at the alarm clock. Now you're still slow as hell doing anything because the other three are still asleep (SC affects all Survivors, the strength of which is determined by people being asleep), you have 60 seconds before you get put back to sleep, and the moment Freddy hits you you're back in the dream world again anyway.
---
It's a Dying Light with no work put into it and it's got an 80% uptime.
---
Then the previous billy can be called hill, hank hill
---
Swing Chains affects you if you're asleep or not. If you're the only one who wakes up, you're still slow as hell doing anything.
---
Spirit. Coming from a spirit main, she's the second best killer in the game behind nurse, however is more consistent because she doesn't rely on frames not being shit. Also, spirit is really fun to play becuase it can be somewhat challenging to learn at first. Though once you do, with the right builds you'll typically beat good survivors a decent amount of the time.
---
TTV means that you die. If I fail, I’m not doing it in front of a live audience. I’m enough of a fuckup as is.
---
Yeah as a survivor main I mostly see shitty killers and never shitty survivors. Killers that seem to be childish basement edgelords standing at the hook hitting the fresh hooked noob with their melee weapon over and over through all entity phases. Sure, let's the rest of us walk out with gens but that one person gets fucked on BP having to stare at some basement dwelling child for two minutes. The worst thing survivors can do is be slightly annoying. Killers can completely ruin a game for one person.
---
Yeah, but I didn't know that back then. I remember feeling so cheated.
---
Head on, apply directly to the killer!
---
Either Hopper, Steve or El
---
Steve is very popular and it would be so cool to have his Scoops Ahoy outfit, but he isn’t really the most important character in the group.
---
El is the most, if not, the most important character of the group, but she has powers and she is a kid and you can’t just those powers away like Ash’s boomstick.
---
*Spoiler alert*
---
Hopper would probably be the most likely, because of his ending in s3 and he would fit pretty well, the only issue I have with him being the chosen survivor would be that he would be the most boring and most unoriginal cosmetic wise of the ST gang
---
yes, that's for sure. I've seen some Evil Within tier III gameplays and if used correctly Myers can be really good.
---
I'd put ghostface at a tie with Myers or maybe above (skill wise), your choice.  Don't buy pig right now her traps aren't that great considering survivors can leave with them on, maybe she'll get a rework but she isn't in a great spot right now.   
---
Legion isn't really that fun to play, more of a m1 killer with a situational time waster.  Anyways I bring sloppy butcher, (doesn't matter what level) ruin, save the best for last, and either nurses, thanatophobia, or monitor and abuse.  I'm never really too self conscious about stbfl stacks, just never put a injured obsession into deep wound state.  
---
If you do buy ghostface I use BBQ, discordance, brutal strength, and ruin.  2 detection perks help you sneak up on easy prey, ruin is a must for most killers, and brutal helps to keep chases a few seconds shorter when someone's exposed.   
---
Overall I'd say ghostface is the most fun to play (it's really funny to watch someone stare you down, unable to snap you out).
---
Maybe something to do with it's shriek or the ability to summon a demodog or something
---
Person called me a shit killer but I successfully mind gamed this guy twice LULW.  But yeah it is very sad to see these people flock the servers and push toxicity. IMO, if a user gets banned in any way and then let back on games they should not be able to type in any game. Shit like that can ruin a persons day, I.e a mentally unstable person or someone that just can't take the shit remarks.
---
Okokokok, but hide or die will definitely kill dbd
---
The only thing I can really think of would be a natural Mori.
---
Honestly I want Pamela more.
---
Coincidence?
---
Myers or Ghostface. Myers has 2 really good perks and an awesome power. Ghostface has stealth and can end chases before they even start. Pig eats pallets like I eat beef jerky. Frequently and with great force.
---
I have no idea what a demodog is and I didn't know it could shriek lol.
---
It's one of the most high quality shows I've watched in years. Also look at mr I hate mainstream media edgelord over here
---
Got on for a casual game. Hook farmed and tunneled. Then hag says this as if she would have played differently regardless of map. Game wares me out sometimes. You’re hag who cares if it’s haddonfield when you hook camp
---
*Throws axe*
---
*Surprise NOED*
---
"Who teabaggin now, bitch."
---
Pamela also has a better basis for abilities
---
Definitely. Rancor isn't a half bad perk to run on her because it gives good information, and if youre lucky even gets you a Mori at the end of the match. Spirit fury isn't really good on her, due to the way you treat loops as the spirit, ( you'll understand later if you learn how to play her) but is amazing on regular killers like billy who don't have any real anti loop abilities. And finally, Haunted grounds is a great perk to run if you have are using another hex perk. So overall, I would say that all of her perks are pretty solid.
---
Otz is better and more kind than Monto imo. I know I'll get downvoted to hell, but Monto has been more toxic as of late, and not just in his toxic series.
---
Watch the show
---
Dev's create endgame... killers still slug and say "32k perfect wraith game" lol
---
Exactly. It’s a problem that exists on one side, and regardless of “who started it first,” the game has existed in this state for 3 years and it doesn’t matter who started it because it’s become such an excessive issue caused by both sides.
---
I got you.  Run Distressing + Dead Rabbit + infinite T3 addons.   Your terror radius is massive and people run scared the rest of the game.
---
As for "low" ranks (ranks 8 and under) Myers is probably the strongest.  Unless you bring the "victim's detailed routine" add-on for ghostface which decreases his night shroud detection range.  That add-on and other add-ons which decreases detection range help alot against good survivors or swf.
---
I'd go for a mall map because I think the lab would feel like the asylum map
---
As a P3 Meg, I can say I’m disappointed.
---
This game is very stressful due to all the shit you mentioned possibly one of the worst people you can find i get most aren't like that but still having to deal with them is a pain
---
All survivors are the same with teachable... besides p3 claudette she gets an invisibility passive so shes best.
---
What can I say? I'm just a very lucky guy
---
The add-on that keeps the obsession in the dream state the whole game with swing chains really sucks too lol.
---
Eh nah, I don't wanna do anything like that. Not worth it : )
---
Not all the characters die to go there, though. They just vanish. Kate was outright abducted by the Entity, not killed.
---
Ah, a fellow man of culture.
---
The combination of these two add-ons make it so he can’t place dream pallets. 
---
That’s a huge negative
---
She eat too many cheeto
---
Amanda bout to drop her new track "expert daddy Kramer"
---
Nice, yeah that's all good for sure.  
---
The other day I showed a Feng the hatch and then kept working on a gen. She hid the whole time and when the killer got close and I went to hide in a locker, she threw a pebble at it.  
---
It was a true bruh moment.
---
Never look for the hatch. The Killers either waiting on it for you or they will close it as you get to it. Too risky. I'll just stay on generators and open a gate. I know I wait on the hatch until the survivor shows up and then I close it. Not going to fall for tricks I use
---
Easy, Ghostface and Dweet
---
I'm not hating on you. But it's like killing streamers is a gold star! I'm just fed up killers these days. What more do you guys want? " Not chasing that surv but chasing that surv because they are worse" isn't a strategy, it's admitting that you would lose against that one. Seriously, I probably never played against you but the toxicity in this game is from killers now. You had a bad time in the beginning but that's over. Can we all have fun now?
---
meg=entity??? have we been tricked all along?
---
Between Leatherface and Ghostface, I see no issues.
---
Even though dream snares are infinitely better.
---
But they aren’t
---
I didn't even play last night, and I don't play Ace.
---
This isn't even my screenshot lol.
---
The killer is Eleven.  But her character model is Danny Devito.  Checkmate devs
---
no she be blinkin
---
I'm afraid this might hurt the stranger things legacy if they let it touch this game
---
We'll probably get a trailer and announcement at Gamescom, maybe even with the chapter playable there, the ptb 27th sounds about right
---
Gaggin'
---
&gt;more people would totally know about Stranger Things
---
Go out and ask them then. The demographic of ST leans towards teenagers and young adults so make sure to ask a wide range of people when you do this.
---
&gt;everyone has watched it.
---
Just not true is it. I haven't watched it. I know...other people who haven't watched it.
---
Yeah, paint brush + swing chains PLUS pop goes the weasel + ruin is an extremely weak build get out of here dude with your delusional self. (Freddy’s are going to have Ruin + Pop with this build most of the time so that’s why it’s kinda overkill)
---
Doctor Main. I use: 
---
Unnerving presence
---
Overcharge
---
Hex: Huntress Lullaby
---
And Bitter Murmur
---
Or Distressing
---
Don’t think so. Billy is controlled by mind flayer. Mind flayer/demogorgon has to be killer
---
I mean think about it.. what power would billy have. Demo opens way more opportunities
---
I personally liked season 2 way more than season 3. Maybe even more than season 1. Personally season 3 just felt really off/weird except for one or two plotlines and the end was just mediocre personally. The rest of storylines had their own good parts but had bad pacing I guess? Seems like they also did a lot of stuff some fans wanted but at the expense of others and the normal mood of the show. And to top it off they spent a lot of the season ruining the reputation of my favorite character. I'm personally surprised at season 3 being good almost as consensus because season three had very divided reception elsewhere.
---
my recent favorite is anti pallet freddy.
---
Any of the pallet addons+any of the rope/chain addons preferably, but anything can really go in the second slot.
---
\-enduring
---
\-spirit fury
---
\-discordance
---
\-bbq and chilli (I mainly use this for farming purposes, you could easily switch this out to taste)
---
It reaaaally highlights how overreliant some folks are on pallets, and it is a ton of fun.
---
this games a 4 v 1 survivor perks do not need to be at par with killer perks stop this mindset of 1v1 game
---
Ah, going for a little bit of Impossible Skillchecks Doctor? Not bad at all.
---
Plague looking like an expired snacc
---
Ok sorry but can you explain what any of this means and what they’re teasing? Yes I watch stranger things.
---
They for sure arent, the pallets are pretty much one of the best killer abilities in the entire game.
---
adept killer perk is basically bbq
---
Huh, weird. Ok then. Also, cultured flair.
---
Great, another reason why I now need Discordance. Maybe the shrine will be kind next week.
---
Hey there smoothskin...
---
Its dumb for survivors too though. If you get someone that can loop forever, and you're doing gens. You'll get a bronze because you weren't in a chase at all.
---
I mean, I see this complaint a lot, but somehow I always seem to get gold or iridescent even against bad survivors?
---
Bubba
---
BBQ and Chili
---
Pop Goes the Weasel
---
Enduring
---
I just found and watched the vod, at least they were nice to you in the post match chat but I do agree that they ought to do something about DCing to trigger the hatch opening.
---
Spirit: Ruin, BBQ, Whispers, Nurse's Calling
---
Yeah its fucked up. But to uninstall after one game?  Come onnnnnn
---
This is more of an action horror game, its not really meant to continuously scare you.
---
I mean, I’m a consistent rank 4+ killer, so I’d like to think I play against experienced survivors. 
---
Agree to disagree I guess
---
I don't kill he would use his hands though, so he would use tendrils to attack, catch and hook survivors.
---
He would literally work as a nurse, so that's a shame.
---
What does dead by daylight mean?1
---
I'm not saying survivor can't be really frustrating, because it can be, especially if you're getting unlucky matches with mori's all the time and whatnot.   
---
But I think to have a good grasp of what each side has to deal with, it's important to play them both. When I started and played nothing but survivor I thought killers were ridiculously OP and tryhard-ey. Then I became a killer main and felt completely powerless against good loopers and gen repair speed. Now that I play both and am (decentish) at both, I think I just have a more grounded opinion on the state of both sides and more empathy for people playing them.
---
Ultimately what you said about how everybody should  just try and have fun is true. People shouldn't be toxic and should just play the game and be chill with eachother. But I assure you it can be a struggle to play lower/middle tier killers and killers are absolutely not the only toxic ones. There are dickhead killers who are that way for no real reason... but for every one of those killers there's also a t-bagging flashlight clicking neon Nea.
---
Dead by Daylight is the name of the game. They're teasing adding Stranger Things content to DbD.
---
Behavior already said they didn’t secure a spot at gamescon. There was an earlier post about it.
---
Honestly, you should report them, this is a clear exploitation of the mechanics of the game
---
It's an universal insult.
---
Learned that through Halo, and many other places were the idiots quickly died later because of their pride and ego.
---
I think the subreddit has a rule against witch hunts, as well. As shitty as doing this was, you know they'd only get people sending them death threats and doxx threats if the names were on there.
---
^YES
---
YES
---
#YES
---
i suicide because the survivors should be saving themselves
---
You are on the dead by daylight reddit... and you dont know what dead by daylight means, seems legit.
---
Yeah I wasn't too bothered considering they weren't dicks and said gg and whatnot.
---
I'll survive
---
11/10 for the crapper.
---
Mythology Entertainment have split up back in February of this year and the rights to Slenderman went back to the original creator, Eric Knudsen(Victor Surge). So far,a game(Terrordrome 2) company asked him for the rights a while back, and he rejected them. So he might reject BHVR as well, which I really hope he doesn't, but I think he might.
---
but wouldn't be more tortuous if the entity took them alive they would have more hope which the entity feeds off and the tv show to my guess is going to be seperate canonically so it really does not matter.
---
Likewise
---
Why they can’t fix chainsaw ghosting is beyond me
---
I didn't know what you were talking about so I went and checked the official twitter...
---
*THOSE SLY A-HOLES*
---
True. They are spooky
---
Meg only has 2 good perks, while Dwight and Adam each have 3 good ones.
---
Sure, Adrenaline is one of the best, but Quick and quite is very situational and SB is the weakest exhaustion
---
huehue funny meme
---
Netflix bein sneeky: cha cha real smooth
---
Pepe Silvia
---
its about as subtle as a jackhammer, and yet, there are STILL people denying whats coming somehow.
---
Yeah it's definitely desensitized after awhile but looking back and seeing any stalker killer can be scary. Prayer beads spirit with thrill of the hunt can def have u shook.
---
More specifically 4 humans
---
If I had to make the game all around scarier though, I think two things would help: the objectives survivors have, and how they can tell the killer is close. Right now it's a gen simulator, and they get done super quick. Once a survivor attaches to a gen they really don't have to get off it. 
---
Something that would encourage players to move around the map more in order to complete their objectives, putting them at higher risk of run ins with the killer. 
---
With that, the scratches/heartbeat/stain/music all gives too much of a heads up for both sides as to what's going on, and lessens the intensity of the encounters. 
---
I saw a game mode suggestion where survivors were first person, and there was no chase music, scratches, stain or heartbeat. I think something like that would be a lot more exciting to play.
---
This happened to me when I was new to the game. I didn't know which side was good or fun to play. I decided to go with killer because it seemed like something easy enough to do. Played around not knowing what to actually do or if there were even survivors in the game or an alternate universe because I never saw one. I tried several different killers before I decided to play doctor. It made the game fun for me and I found out that other people besides me existed in the game. Then the torment started.... I wasn't the one being the tormentor in spite of what the game description of me being the killer was supposed to be. I never felt so weak and pointless before. This was back when survivor perks were so broken that it made it impossible to ever catch them and when you finally did they were at full health again or was gone in a flash because the exhaustion status effect wasn't even a thing so yay for lithe, balanced landing and sprint burst combos in loops. These people would just do gens right in front of me and there was nothing I could do.
---
But I played more and more and got better at the game and now I'm the one that's laughing at their misery. I control the flow of the game and I dictate who leaves and who gets to meet the entity. My prefered killers are pig, nurse and i'm starting to get the hang of billy but I still mostly play pig and meme around with other killers. I also play a hefty amount of survivor as well.
---
TLDR: this game is super fucking annoying and impossible to play when you're new and becomes fun to boring once you figure everything out.
---
Seriously? There's no way they would post that if it wasn't relative
---
Or Flayed Billy
---
I've seen quite a few comments calling it random jibberish, and that we are grasping at straws.
---
Word of caution op, block out the killers name next time. 
---
But, I've run into this guy a few times while playing as killer, and he was a raging asshole.
---
be an age difference I guess. I just never even considered others feelings and or comments when it comes to evaluating if I like a game or not. Anyway in closing I’ll say this. 
---
“It was once say it by a man who couldn’t quit, dopeman please can I have another hit” The Dopeman said, “”Fuck, I don’t give a shit if your girl kneel down and suck my dick”.... 
---
Got high mid post.. fist thing that popped into my mind. 🥴
---
Useful if killer has Franklin's, which they might put on if they see a lot of items
---
PINHEAD DAMNIT
---
I do tend to just... not really take enemy bills very seriously. There are exceptions, but pretty frequently, the bill players tend to be the absolute worst on the team. You know the sort, the guy that just throws down the god pallet for no reason, or leaps into a locker in line of sight of the killer.
---
It's likely gonna be either a [Demogorgon](https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Demogorgon_(species)) or [Flayed!Billy Hargrove](https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Billy_Hargrove).
---
As for the Survivor, it will most likely be [Jim Hopper](https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Jim_Hopper), though some are hoping it's [Steve Harrington](https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Steve_Harrington).
---
What would the killer be, since the gorgon is an alien? I'm not clued in to the details of ST yet.
---
Dbd or not stranger things is definitely worth the watch.
---
I agree. 1st person survivor would probs be hard to do but I’m sure it could be done.
---
The only time i feel scared is when i don't see the killer, or I can't really detect where they are. If I can see things perfectly in the light then I feel no fear, because no matter the killer I can predict multiple escape routes, and when you play this game for long enough you know where pretty much all the pallets are. For that reason, I think making the game *literally darker* would make it way scarier. It would make it harder to figure out what the killer was, and a bit harder to come up with escape routes. I feel like there are two main ways the devs could do this
---
Rework moonlight offerings, then put them back in bloodwebs: Remeber moonlight offerings? yeah. Those were trying to do exactly this. So what if BHVR just reworked the moonlight offerings, and made and made them actually darken the map like they were supposed to without messing/glitching out the lighting in such a way that they caused a issue for some people (like last time). I feel like that core idea would be the perfect way to add some much needed spook factor to this game.
---
What do u even mean by that.
---
The devs are notorious for this kind of stuff, like when Ghostface fully leaked they were basically "hehe oops we mooned u, ur welcome have a nice day"
---
I fuuuully believe they've went and done it again
---
•__•
---
Adrenaline is an argument ender for me. It’s easily the best perk in the game in my eyes, and she also has another meta exhaustion perk (even though its arguably the worst)
---
Dwight has good perks, but they’re mostly for niche builds that revolve around teamwork. 
---
Adam is an interesting argument
---
Aww Baby Ace
---
Not necessarily.
---
There are plenty of times I chase a different survivor because of exhaustion perks or because there are still too many pallets up in a certain section of the map.
---
That's not saying "you're a good survivor", that's saying "mechanics that are brutally punishing of M1 killers sometimes have to be avoided"; a Nurse/Spirit/Hillbilly could still chase that survivor.
---
Most importantly if it's getting a kill and forcing pallets to drop, that slows the entire game down, letting you get back to that other survivor and kill them later. Delaying a chase doesn't mean refusing a chase.
---
I believe they're intentional leaks now just to being the hype up
---
I'm letting the other survivors know that saving me would be a suicidal action.
---
Hex: Hoes Mad 
---
Every time someone minding they own business, you open your mouth.
---
“Why are you mad? Who hurt you?”- 2/3 of not mad hoes
---
The developers didn't say anything about not adding aliens IRC but if they did.... well, they *did* say they were never going to add any clown killers and yet we have The Clown sooooo
---
For real. He’s the only thing I want
---
Why would I think he has one?
---
They did a while back when people were asking if they'd put Alien and something else in.. forgot what the other thing was. Maybe the Predator.
---
They said it wouldn't fit the lore because the entity takes corrupted humanoids. But yeah, that's a good point with the clown. I'd be all for it myself.
---
Legion is fun to vault stuff and chase people down, but for higher ranks you’d have to sweat pretty hard to make them viable
---
Replace the perk and add silent foot steps: When you’re sprinting, your foot steps are 100% mute.
---
Now your just fat shaming the clown!
---
Oh for sure, these devs loving doing the teaser thing leading up to chapters, and there have been more than a couple signs pointing to stranger things recently. The double whammy today with the fanart, and the netflix thing, was just kind of driving the point home.
---
This gives me Blair Witch vibes and I don't know why
---
I only have my experience and that's when a killer leaves me it's not because of a strategy, it's because catching another surv off guard or dare I say a less exp surv it's easier and then when everyone's dead except me closes hatch starts endgame timer send message of gg ez 4k. It's all good on my end. I dont mind DC ing from matches. It's like " oh, I'm in a pile of shit. Should I try and clean it up or just get out of it?"
---
Forgot to add that you could even give the killer comms too so RPers can enhance the experience for some people.
---
[Their stand is back up...](https://www.gamescom.global/exhibitor/behaviour) Weird.
---
bills shouldnt be allowed, make them just to spectate
---
This was posted a little bit earlier too, but yeah. Seems like a direct tease at a stranger things chapter.  As for who i think the killer and surv will be:
---
Survivor: hopper or maybe steve. 
---
Killer: Seeing the flayer itself would be pretty cool, but the devs did say they wanted to only add fairly humanoid killers. That means there are two main possibilities, flayed billy or the demogorgon. I would say mind flayer, but i feel it's not humanoid enough to be a possiblity at all, plus it tends to be pretty big.
---
Jen Denise has left the chat.
---
if I'm not mistaken they could now add content, but the damage had been done. its hard to get a team together after that. such a shame, it really was a game with some promise before that
---
Isn't The Entity just that? Imo would be interesting to see a killer that wasn't never a human in the first place
---
Corrupted Mickey next killer.
---
Just incase you need to know, I main Billy p3 and have played at rank 4 with other red rank surv. Is it butt clenching at times, yes. Have I had all surv down in basement because I hooked one came upstairs heard the other downed hooked while other surv getting unhooked then downed etc. Yes...and let them all wiggle off to restart game because I dont need a streamers swf 4k for reddit. I want to play because it's fun. Stop making it fun and I'm out and on to the next.
---
really? I can barely find any games when I try to
---
We're you not here for when they released Ash and then Ghost Face? Or are you just intent on being an asshole without any supporting argument?
---
‘Tis a scandal! Netflix and BHVR are just trying to hide. Obviously Netflix nor stranger things has anything to do with it..
---
Just look at the release date! September.
---
Know what else happens in September? Alien 51 raid
---
The next killer is obviously Area 51 alien! Geez
---
You mean that guys that only get healed by their fellow survivors once every other game at ranks 1-5?
---
Those guys using self-care because it's the only way to get healed (they're holding a flashlight or toolbox, after all) short of looting random chests?
---
They'll be with you before you exit first stage, sheesh.
---
Better to heal up beforehand (16 seconds them + 16 seconds them = 32 seconds) than heal after an unhook notification (16 seconds healing you + 16 seconds you being healed = 32 seconds. You healing them = 16 seconds, them healing you = 16 seconds. 32 seconds) than trust someone likely to sprint off post-hook.
---
He´s a snowball killer, not weak as many think.
---
Iri head and infantry belt exist
---
Silent bell and soot addon exists
---
5 blink nurse exists
---
I understand you're complaint, but it's just another set of stupid annoying addons that we deal with everyday.
---
Oh, and I shall not forget *infinite mending legion*
---
They were both leaked fool. We have no proof that its strangers things.. unless you found some leaked killer and survivor perks? huh?
---
could also give blood points for being the last one dead aswell, to sort of make up for not escaping. maybe it could retroactively double all altruistic actions you did in the last 3/4/5 minutes of the game
---
Lagging. I got it many times
---
no need to be a toxic piece of shut about it
---
but hey, what can we expect from a leatherface main!
---
*Rats in 1348:*
---
It's.matchmaking. I'm rank 6 now after reset, my buddy is rank 12. We constantly getting rank 18-20 killers for some reason, with other 2 survivors also being ranks 20. The game is basically me getting chased the entire game while my buddy do the gens and other two just hide.
---
I think you mean Feng mains. All the Fengs I get as survivor are wusses  who pussy out of unhooking in front of the killer no matter what
---
r/youngpeopleyoutube
---
there is good fengs, but there isnt any good bill.
---
Oh shut up. you're probably a toxic Claudette main who farms their teammates, uses DS and borrowed time and then calls the killer toxic. Probably also a stranger things fan. get out of here.
---
Demigorgon killer? Mind Flayer killer?
---
His account is 0 days old. He made it just to be a dick. Poor little guy must be all worked up about school starting soon.
---
Saw chapter 2.0?
---
You get chaer points for the act of finishing chases, not for the chase itself
---
You get more points the shorter the chase was
---
You don’t need longer chases. You need more chases
---
hmm, close
---
meg thomas main no ds i do indeed run borrowed time because i dont want to farm my teammates, and yes i do like stranger things
---
and you’re saying this on an alt account cause you’re too scared to man up and go on your main
---
Allegedly.
---
lol yep he probably insidious camps then complains about getting genrushed
---
stfu quentin main.
---
I would buy every single one of these in an instant
---
Are you paying like, any attention? theyve been teasing this all week, plus the big netflix teaser a few months ago. And today they just hammered it home with the double whammy teaser. Whether you like it or not, its incoming.
---
stfu leatherface main
---
Good one. Not even close
---
I wonder if the playerbase is just low
---
I've never seen a good Feng
---
Leatherface at the end was the cherry on top of the cake lol.
---
lmao. whats the difference? you're still a filthy survivor main. LOL. at least I don't watch a crap show and main an ugly survivor.
---
Its also worth noting, they actually usually do do a few licensed chapters in a row.
---
Hag: sloppy, ruin, nurses, monitor and abuse
---
It's so easy to sneak up on healing people as hag with monitor, I hit people when leave the chase and make them feel safe, when bam.
---
Trapper: enduring, spirit fury, brutal, ruin.
---
For trapper, I like to trap all the abusable loops and eat the pallets as fast as I can. If survivors have few gens left and all pallets are gone, they have no way to fight back, it's a GG.
---
I’m gonna save this post just in case it is a Stranger Things chapter so I can say they told you so lmao
---
I haven’t played the game for a few months and now I’m in rank 20s. I can’t enjoy the games because of the low ranks. I can’t get out because our current system punishes you for doing well and I just keep destroying low rank games without progressing until I get bored and quit the game for another month, repeating the cycle
---
I better not see you in my lobby. ur getting facecamped.
---
&gt;Hooks every survivor 3 times
---
My emblem: BrOnZe
---
What's sfw? Searching for women?
---
you people still havent got proof that its stranger things. pathetic.
---
Then you get thrown on a hook and she's crouched behind a wall for 3m straight, just staring at you
---
What kinda pussy makes a new account just to talk shit.
---
Badaba?
---
shut up. ur definitely boosted.
---
*YES*
---
Oh my god yes it happens so often. I’m always the one that gets screwed over haha. I feel mocked by them
---
Sorry I mix up season and chapter sometimes
---
They could keep the current emblem system but change how points are awarded with two categories: aggressive and tactical. Which would either reward killers for super quick kills or reward killers for dragging the game out longer (like trapper).
---
thats just a watermark i made lol
---
like who? this show isnt even iconic. not everyone watches it. the killers and characters wouldn't make sense for dbd.
---
i'm right tho
---
GTFO
---
Camping isn't a offence either .  Dbd tweeted a list of things they toss out if they are in the reports
---
oh is that so?
---
He’s not allowed to say bad words or he will get grounded.
---
go back to watchung ur shit stranger things.
---
i could ask the same. i bet you’re typing your reply from a hook with insidious active though
---
no, i dont think i will
---
I think so..
---
I just started playing and talking on Reddit. Legion is my favorite. He has a “less talking, more stabbing” play-style and can really amp up the pressure.
---
I only used Discordance, killed 3 at once.
---
he already spends all his time in the basement though
---
NO
---
I play the big boy himself, clown.
---
sorry, i already finished it
---
cant wait till you get a four stack of steve harrington or something lmao
---
Haven't used that perk for awhile but i know survivors escape from the killer's grasp in rare occasions.
---
fr about matchmaking though, i'm a rank 19 killer, i've literally played maybe a dozen games but go against (i can't really tell if they're swf groups so i won't assume so 100%) rank 11s or so, like i get that they aren't hardcore rank 1s but they sure as hell all have adrenaline and borrowed time etc etc
---
at least if i was a survivor main, i wouldnt use DS sprint burst, self care and dead hard, you probably need those to live. LOL
---
i've seen once a feng that chased the killer for 9.2 seconds.
---
That sounds like something a streamer would say
---
My husband has played a handful of times. Last time he was against a level 19 that had bbq, ruin, nurses, and blood warden (all tier 3). Killer was trapper. I don't even know how you can stay rank 19 and get all those perks.
---
gross. go back to writing dirty fanfics about him, you loser.
---
""Dweet"". I love it
---
nope, i run bond and empathy, borrowed time and diversion
---
but i’ll give you five bucks if ya stay more than 4 inches away from a hook nodding your head up and down
---
oh i see, so when i've been hitting the already affected people it's been for nothing, cool :]
---
That's a lot for a Feng. Only in Red ranks do Bills, Megs, and Fengs do good tho.
---
gross. go back to your two basements
---
your parents basement
---
and the game basement
---
both of which include you not moving an inch for hours on end
---
If it is a licensed chapter it'd probably be something other than a Stranger Things chapter. I think Jason might work depending on how he's made if they are ever able to get him in the game. Chucky and Pennywise wouldn't work at all. Either way, I don't think they should add any more licensed killers for a while and work on original killers instead. Licensed killers are worse in this game because they have to stay true to the movie while original killers are better as there's many more options on what you can do with them.
---
If it was a Stranger Things chapter it wouldn't be that good.
---
lies. u probably need help from your rank 1 buds that can actually juke while the help ur boosted ass.
---
so i need to frenzy hit them, and then normal attack... can i normal attack them and then finish them in frenzy with my second attack ?
---
What would Demogorgon's power be?
---
Game chat generally brings a mute button for a reason.
---
You are aware that its one of the most highly praised, and highly watched current series, correct? I understand that you are heavily biased against it, but jeeze, not every chapter needs to cater specifically to your desires, so relax, stop ignoring the obvious signs, and let other folks have their fun.
---
As for who, Steve, Nancy, or Hopper, and those are just the most likely options, theres a good half dozen other possibilities for survivors. For Killer, the Demogorgon, Host Billy, or Grigori.
---
cannot wait until the chapter is teased further
---
this neckbeard lowlife lmao hes so easy to troll too
---
gross? says the hoe that likes gay ass stranger things. u probably cosplay as the characters and post pics of it on tumblr. screw off.
---
great. another moron who thinks its gonna be jason.
---
lies? lol you dont believe my perk build ok lmao
---
Excellent, I'm glad they aren't catering to whiny survivors who brought their Skeleton Key or Engies' Toolbox with a Vigos.
---
Feel free to look around, there have been a lot of teasers, including the double whammy today, ending with netflix literally spelling out dead by daylight on their twitter.
---
shit perk build u mean
---
ill be laughing when ur wrong
---
Yes, but still it's not confirmed.
---
I've got a really bad feeling its just a red herring :(
---
I suppose that's fair but the timing of it with the Netflix post seems on purpose. Of course there is the argument to be made that this fan art wouldn't exist if it weren't for the rumors so chicken or the egg...
---
I wouldn't call it a confirmation it's litteraly just 3 words it could be a coincidence all we know is Netflix made a deal with behaviour and other devs at the time so
---
There’s a difference between tunneling and camping. If they stood in front of you the whole match that’s camping and there a bitch but I think tunneling is ok
---
It is
---
at least i dont need an alt account to call people who actually have a life “lowlife gay ass hoe”
---
sorry but bills sucks at red ranks, their chases takes 5.3 seconds, they try to 360 the killer while the killer is fingering the weapon.
---
You have like 20 seconds to wait first time, and don't assume shit, I'm in plenty of those games too.  You're just as bad as them.
---
Thanks for the very productive remark! Such non-waste of time! You are now Saint RoadKill2101!
---
fine. u win. its stranger things. now back to writing billy hargrove fanfics. no point in reasoning with you people.
---
get the fuck outta here purple haired snowflake.
---
no no, thats a nea skin not a meg skin
---
Everyone thought Ghostface was too good to be true too, since the community has been asking for him for years. Yet here he is
---
w h a h
---
Fuckin' Disturbed Ward...... I hate it when this happens
---
meg still has fucking bleach ass millennial hair. dumb fuck.
---
Billy is a disgusting person and a horrible racist? Lol, of all of the characters you could have chosen to try to make some sort of weird insult with.
---
Considering they didn't release one survivor with ghost face... i think we can dream, a little
---
wow, referencing a season two character? i though you didnt like the show, why keep watching it?
---
thats pretty much the whole fandom of stranger things. billy hargove and stove horrington fans writing fanfics with ocs. now dbd is gonna  bring these morons here on the dbd fandom.
---
its natural red hair? since when is millennial a valid insult you boomer
---
Yes but you don't do it to be an asshole, you do it because rank reset forces you too.
---
Sexy time has begun
---
Why are you still replying to me? obsessed much?
---
leatherface, elm street, &amp; saw were all back to back so you're just wrong
---
Nurses call, and maybe ruin?
---
why are you still replying? upset much?
---
Did you read that comment? they literally said, "I think Jason might work depending on how he's made if they are ever able to get him in the game." where does that say they think it will be Jason??
---
Do what ever you gotta to win, toxic is a word survivors throw around when you didn’t let them curbstomp you, if you think a swf is baiting you, absolutely wait those fuckers out, and they get extremely toxic about it post game, right down their names, and next time you see them, it’s Mori Time *TM*
---
u do realize she has awful short blonde lesbian hair cosmetics with 80s crap clothing right?
---
Thanks for the suggestion but I don’t have Hag. I just have Michael Myers, Legion, and Bubba.
---
But I will look into Nurses call, thanks!
---
what is it with you and the 80s? also why insult gay people, did you get rejected by one?
---
he still cant work. jason is overpowered in the movies. in dbd he will be weak because survivors are op
---
if a killer is shaking his head after a down to be a ass or hitting on hook
---
If you take all those killer names and spell it out it says npcslpgf and that doesn’t make any god damn sense
---
What region are you? U.S. I find games faster than DBD most times.
---
eww. i'm straight you fucking moron. u probably hang out with them and watch stranger things together
---
“Bleh” I think I was plagued by plag
---
Is hag not free on pc?
---
No, I think she was never free on all consoles.
---
She’s free on PS4
---
we have netflix announcing they are working with behavior, among other companies....all of which got stranger things items.......and then dbd's official twitter showcasing stranger things dbd crossover art......and then netflix posting 3 random screenshots of stranger things, the first having the word dead, 2nd having by, and 3rd having daylight........
---
im honestly done with your shitty logic, insults, and neckbeard lifestyle. grow the fuck up, and when we get the stranger things chapter you will never see the end of it from me bud. have fun in your basement
---
  -the 13 year old you just got trolled by
---
Welp I play pc, so it doesn’t apply to me. But thanks for the suggestion, I’ll use Ruin later, but for now I am sticking to only free killers (Huntress, Billy, wraith, trapper / Evan, nurse) and those 3
---
The said they won't, so you're correct
---
removed we already have this on front page https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/crpnge/netflix_posts_three_random_pictures_of_stranger/
---
Husk?
---
They only got the rights to the mask so of course it was going to be an original character.
---
And the killer gives me a blowjob
---
Wha^aa^aa^aa^at
---
The main issue with that is that there are so many ways around it, it’s not even worth having
---
leave now. your swf is spamming you invites. LOL
---
The Pig isn't a slasher character
---
I thought I'd try putting my idea out there. it would at least work on console since you can't really manage multiple programs and I doubt every SWF knows each other IRL or knows each other enough to coordinate a group call
---
I love playing Hag, but man going against Hag sucks because they are either babies and camp, or they are pretty good and people who go for saves crouch on unhook and then sprint burst away triggering every trap.
---
&gt;There is a reason Behavior has never banned for this situation and never will.
---
I mean, once dedicated servers come you'll be wrong. So enjoy it while you can Scott. Even if it just starts out as just a quick 5 minute slap on the wrist, the people who do this shit treat d/c'ing like potato chips. They can't just have one, it's a habit for them.
---
on god I don't know jack shit about stranger things and also just because she kills people doesn't mean the pig is a slasher, saw isn't a slasher franchise. pinhead, pennywise, regan, even though they killed people doesn't mean they are slashers they're just horror 
---
antagonists
---
Some people on certain servers have to derank/stay in the lower ranks so that they can actually get games and not have to wait 20-30 minutes just to start a lobby
---
Are you on PS4 ? Because I did that some time ago haha
---
Badaba
---
Stranger Things just DOESN'T make sense in Dead By Daylight tho. DBD doesn't really need any more licensed characters for a while because they don't always fit and they aren't as good as original characters.
---
Plus if your a Meyer's main Infectious Fright is amazing for tier 3. I use a Monitor and Abuse with it and it makes finding people who are hiding a lot easier.
---
why would it be weird?  
---
The limitation keeps the background lore from being packed with all sorts of other supernatural stuff. If the devs want to keep it mostly like our world then i understand.
---
My build is thanatophobia, sloppy butcher, bamboozle and save the best for last, of which you have three available. Ruin is definitely the way to go for most people, I personally find hexes too unreliable but I can't deny that it's a good perk.
---
When a killer is nice enough to let us get some points out of a crap situation like this I try a fair amount of the time to get them to kill me at the end. They showed they were decent and I don't think I'll depip and the killer should get something for the kindness.  The extra 5000 is about one item. I can stomach losing that to say thanks for someone kind when they could take advantage.
---
Who’s ready for a demogorgen killer who is basically a better Freddy Krueger and a Hopper survivor who just fuckin decks the killer
---
Low-key terrifying
---
Honestly I feel kind of cheated that it was affected by the emblem change, if it went back to only needing the 4k I could grind out the games until I get a party that majorly screws themselves over.
---
Thanks, but I do not have Clown. But good suggestion none the less.
---
The glorious flash step.
---
Honestly you don't really need bamboozle, I just use it because it makes the vault speed closer to what it used to be before the rework
---
Hey fair enough. It just seems majority of killers who mock the survivor “rulebook” for killers, actually have a rulebook of their own for survivor behavior. I don’t necessarily subscribe to anything goes, but can’t argue if you’re at least consistent for both sides.
---
Bro nice cosplay, almost looks like the game
---
Even with dedicated servers, they'd be banning for disconnecting, not for abusing the hatch mechanics specifically. If at all.
---
They may just have friends who do not play as much as them, so they're sat further back in ranks. Like I said rank reset just happened and maybe they haven't played much since,  like the others have. Easy wins honestly get boring,  so I doubt they want that EVERY single game so badly they depip 12+ pips lol. But I could be wrong.
---
&gt;they'd be banning for disconnecting, not for abusing the hatch mechanics specifically.
---
Hey, if the problem gets solved I'm not going to be picky about the road taken to get there.
---
**Hitboxe**
---
whats emetophilia?
---
That's not what I said, but go off I guess.
---
First of all, 10% is significant. Secondly, that's an average, meaning it includes SWFs who made it to higher ranks due to the advantages awarded by being in a SWF and then encountered players of significantly higher skill than their own, something which doesn't happen without exceptionally bad matchmaking to solos.
---
Well, I like BP, so.
---
Platform: Xbox
---
Type of bug: In-game
---
Description: Im carrying a toolbox but I the option of repair a generator with it doesn’t appear, I have this problem since I buy it and I tried with everything.
---
Steps to reproduce: have a toolkit with you and get close to a generator.
---
Expected result: there is an option to repair using a toolkit.
---
Actual result: there isn’t an option to repair with it.
---
Reproduction rate: it happens every single time, I didn’t even thought it was possible until I saw a gameplay.
---
I would love that to be the case since I love surprises but it would be bittersweet as I’m sure a lot of people would be pissed
---
Honestly, this will massively help other survivors even if others DC, except in hatch bs cases.  Because now the killer will actually have a reason to continue on and take the time to hook them that currently is them just going straight for their next chase.
---
If Behavior is nice, they'll even let the remaining survivors still interact with the husk normally (read, unhook for a hefty chunk of BP).
---
I missed out on the (old) adept freddy achievement because of this. Seriously, theres no counterplay to this
---
100%, and yet when people discuss it on here, nearly every time it gets called "fair" and an "outplay."
---
Some people are legitimately disgusting.
---
Well, that's why I put it in brackets. I know people smurf, too, and I have had a few jerks in the low ranks, but levels of toxicity seem to have a wave pattern in general. Low in low ranks, up to high in yellow/early green, lowering again in purple, and sky high in red. From all I've seen and heard, at least.
---
I'd welcome ANYTHING they might try to make the playerbase stop acting like hate-chimps, though; adding unranked mode or even different modes not presented as being competitive is just my first suggestion. The game design itself also does have a lot of proclivity towards making people toxic, I agree.
---
Sounds like a legion is the way to go. Really fast and good at applying pressure multiple survivors at a time
---
I wouldn't say its an exploit, but slug metas (especially knockout based ones) are extremely unfun for solo survivors while not impacting SWF nearly as much.
---
Unpopular opinion: I'm so tired of "normal guy" killers this past year. Clown, Legion, Ghostface, and then Billy? Give us some variety.
---
How do you honestly think that abusing something bannable to gain an edge in a match isn't cheating?
---
Honestly it's a lot to explain, you're better off watching YouTube recaps on the show itself. It's an amazing show though so, its definitely worth just watching.
---
Sounds like a classic case of Rank Reset. Probably took a break from the game and came back at rank 19.
---
I’m just saying it seems like it’s too late for them to try to fix the community, that’s all. It would be nice if there was a bandaid fix for it, but the problem is the community, and you can’t change people who don’t want to change.
---
you asked for a FORCED one. do you know what forced means?
---
Well, I've heard a spread of reasons about why Epic Store is bad, but Discord is just a bad idea because, as you can attest, nobody KNEW it sold games.
---
I imagine they've already gotten plenty of actionable feedback from their essentially-beta players. I also have to assume they threw it in everyone's face, from the way I hear the devs spoken of. You want a good reception, make a good game.
---
actually, according to the law, teenagers are children.
---
I think they should add "debt."  If you dc, your account xp and blood point pool should accumulate an appropriate amount of debt. Until your debt is paid off, half of all xp and blood points earned go to paying off your debt.
---
I thought you couldnt rank reset to 18-20 but im probably wrong.
---
When I do good and people still call me a terrible player, I just reply with "well still good enough to kill you guys, right?".
---
Killer is definitely the demogorgon. Survivor is probably Joyce or Hopper. Location is almost definitely Hawkins lab
---
Honestly, I agree with you. I think he's just getting burnt out on Dead by Daylight, though, which is why he seems to be playing other games more and more lately.
---
You can, my buddy is good but is very unlucky with his teammates, so his rank stays pretty low. Last rank reset blasted him all the way down to 19.
---
Thank you!!:)
---
bro im from the MW2 days of online games, like I know many others are.  This ain't shit.  You have bad games, you don't want to see toxic chat either?  Close the chat bubble, thats it.  All of us have had fucked games like that in the beginning, you can still have games like that now as well.
---
Was that a little disco point lmao
---
A bunch of 8 years olds play superpowers.
---
Meanwhile, a menacing creature called a 'demogorgon' spends a whole season not killing anyone.
---
Don’t know about you but I enjoy liscensed Killers. It’s so much fun to see and play against/with iconic horror icons that I watched on the small screen numerous times.
---
If that’s the kind of “toxicity” you’re talking about... holy fuck actually get out of here lmao this conversation is over
---
Asking the real question here
---
I always just start meming if i get with a 4man bully squad. Cant call me trash if i wasnt even trying
---
Not true, there was a ghost face that took pity on out merry bunch and let us get free points. The community’s not all bad.
---
Congratulations!!
---
Lef for ded u died, same with every matches in dbd
---
Live with their mom AND have ugly partners? Yeesh that's a rough time. That is the one time I'm gonna kill myself on the hook, though. When I think another survivor is going to make a suicide rescue attempt.
---
why does the image with Freddy and Jason look like a cropped romance novel cover I’m flatlining
---
My main concern here.
---
Could you explain why Self Care isn’t as popular? I haven’t played in a while and just started back in
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAA
---
GGood? 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAJAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAGDHSXKDKCKFNXJDJX BE DC HEEEKP HEELLPO OMFG ITS HAPPENING. AAAAAA HELP AAGHHH SHITT FUCKK AGHHHH HELP MEE, IM CUMMING OABDBFJFJDK
---
Rank 20s probably think Bamboozle is a bug.
---
Congrats! I’m so close, just missing adept nurse and I wish I got it when adepts were achieved with only a 4K..
---
I think you'd be best at Legion, but beware of the salt.
---
I'm actually glad about that because remake Nancy was stale white bread. Given the circumstance, Quinton was the best option they could of gone with.
---
I'd say Myers, but any choice is good really.  
---
Personally, I don't think the Legion is very fun to play
---
@haff42
---
Fire up does the same thing but for killers
---
By your logic it's "punishing the survivors for doing the gens"
---
Ehhhh, Friday the 13th had that and it really had a negative effect imo. Way too many people trying to be shockingly offensive for the sake of it, trying to do (fairly bad) impressions, or trying to emulate their favorite online personalities. Kinda ruined the atmosphere of the game.
---
OH SHIT U ARE RIGHT
---
Yes, disconnecting several times is bannable. Disconnecting once to given someone a hatch is not that situation. I'm not sure what you're trying to argue.
---
u/haff34
---
I’d look r up cuz I don’t have links to anything off hand apologizes
---
Oh please leave a husk. I just got out of a game where my mission was Rite of Sacrifice and each time I'd get someone to death hook, they'd DC.
---
Quentin is a twink, he's fine.
---
It would be a good time to introduce it, maybe they can't do bans on p2p. Unreal how much money these dudes have made, and still no dedicated servers, it's almost laughable.
---
As a recently red ranked survivor (never again, I got tired of being a try hard every game and want to run some more interesting but less effective perks), but more importantly as someone who uses his eyeballs, dream pallets are nearly worthless. I can honestly say that after the first day of the Freddy update I have fallen for a grand total of 1 dream pallet and have mistakenly not used a real pallet 1 time. Dream snares are much harder to play against since I have to loop more widely, be slowed, or usually throw a pallet much earlier that I can make it to the next tile. 
---
Also, I played Freddy for the very first time yesterday after getting him to rank 10 so that I could attempt adept Freddy while doing a daily.  Loops didn't do much to slow down my chases, just by throwing down snares mid chase I ended most of them fairly quickly even with my mediocre snare placement. Got a double pip, and I'm pretty sure I still would have gotten a 4k even if the survivors hadn't made a couple of bad mistakes in chases and hiding spots. It would probably be even easier if I was using some actually useful perks instead of remember me and blood warden, which didn't even have a chance to trigger, and the marginal speed bonus from tier 1 fire up. I haven't played him more than once because I don't like to handicap myself by using such poor loadouts, but I think the snares were far more useful than dream pallets would have been and are definitely more reliable.
---

---
I am not I am just saying it looked funny I honestly could care less
---
Na but its probably cuz iv played it so damn much
---
Just close the post game chat, if you click the message or double arrow icon next to the text bar it will close the chat forever. Helpful if you know the GGEZ is coming
---
Thing is that the devs do nothing to punish this kind of behavior and a lot of popular streamers engage in it too.  The message they are sending is that this is the standard they want and when people are toxic to others it invariably leads to some of those people being toxic in the next game, and on and on.
---
Hopefully BHVR will get their act together when dedicated servers release but I wouldn't count on it.  Even egregious, proven, repeated and obvious toxic stream sniping elicits nothing but excuses from the devs.  It's pretty embarrassing when this is the only game I've played where people can stream snipe and act like dicks, DC when they get downed while dead on hook and do this for game after game for WEEKS on end and nothing is done.
---
Dbd addiction
---
Looping needs a rework too.
---
Wow, didnt think about that. With such massive terror radius you can also run Unnerving/Overwhelming Presence
---
Fuck Netflix. They canceled the OA. I hope they get fucked in the streaming wars about to hit the internet. I’ll never watch their original content again.  What’s the point if they’re just going to cancel shows before they finish.
---
800 IQ play - he stepped in his own trap to make you overconfident.
---
Spirit, she has good perks and is more fun to play than legion could ever dream of being atm
---
You could make about 3 or 4 different ones like this for killers honestly
---
Why would I make an excuse to someone who didn't see the match
---
Not my thing, but good for the game to get some new players.
---
Original post from u/stupidoit00
---
Even as a survivor main hitting hatches are harder then m1 sooooooo.
---
Its god tier on doctor, and can combo with some other perks as well
---
We need more survivors like you
---
Most games, aside from Magic the Gathering Arena and Battlefield
---
You know as a billy user I was able to get a good amount of chainsaws as people vaulted through windows. It's a gamble but when it works it makes it worth it
---
It's ok to be jealous
---
I lowkey love when survivors 3gen themselves. Makes me as the killer know I suddenly have all the power. Like, try to commit to one gen, bitch, you know you can't get past me
---
The are planning on making some changes to lestger face too make him a bit more viable.
---
Question, what is BM?
---
JESUS CHRIST LMFAO
---
This is why I love playing against Ghostface. He has the potential to scare the shit out of me, but I have the potential to retaliate if I play attentively
---
This breaks my heart
---
Everyday we stray further from god
---
Not when I'm walking granted there's no grass around.
---
Unfortunately for some of those people, that’s a turn on
---
hopefully two survivors to play around with
---
personally I've never watched the show but hey give me Nancy
---
Rank 10s and under are gonna love this "buff". Obvious /s
---
Instead of punishing leavers we should reward players with 1000 shards for every 10 Games they played in a row
---
Because their track history definitely has them paying big money for relevant licensed content. Cmon guys none of their licenced content are from recent media, they cant afford the licences for a currently running highly successful franchise.
---
oh god yes, MORI ME DADDY

Well with NOED it’s just being reverted.

If u wear headphones you can still hear her footsteps when she's coming. It's a good sound to learn to listen out for because it also helps with looping her.
---
I agree tho. Prayer beads suck. They should remove them and instead have addons that reduce the radius of her whoooshing sound. You want to go for a gen grab build? Either run distressing massive terror radius or dedicate 2 addon slots.
---
But the thing about nerfing spirit is then there goes one of 3 killers u see at red ranks. I dont think a prayer bead nerf would be enough to see her go away but the devs are one bad day away from it being a Nurse desert with the ocasional Billy oasis.

clever lol

I don't understand the hate? She doesn't currently derank and she is definitely nicer than the average gamer.

I get adept on killers pretty easily. Just knocked out the shape, the nightmare, Ghostface, and bubba these last few days.

No stop, you're just giving them what they want!
---
It used to be that shit, damm
---
No thanks
---
Rank 18 killer here  with 2k hours in the game (mostly on survivor). I play killer solely for dailies (also not that good at them) so rank reset keeps me pretty low. I also never double pip because I try not to kill people. Rank is such a weird mechanism in this game.
---
There’s no game that is perfect, every game has bugs which need fixing. People getting punished for these issues is annoying
---
Bonus points if you hear it in his voice.
---
&gt; Im counting ghostface in that 5 because the mask is the only thing licensed.
---
You really shouldn't.
---
Sure, the person under the mask is *technically* a DBD original creation, but the character of Ghostface is definitely not.

If you think league is chill compared to this you’ve probably never experienced diamond lol.

Dbd is full of tbagging and geez, league is constant slurs, insults, inting, and death threats.
---
I love how somehow in your mindset ending the match early and letting all the survivors at least keep their items while spoiling and ruining a game is somehow worse than one survivor DC’ing because the Killer downed them once, forcing everyone to now play a much less fun, more one-sided match with less bloodpoints for everyone, and the other survivors are incentivized to DC along with them.
---
Survivors DC’ing is way worse. It ruins the game foe their team and the killer, who still have to play the rest of it.
---
Survivors have to cleanse *three* murals? Even if you lowered it to one mural these would still be OP.
---
I'm thinking a demogorgon killer and hopper survivor
---
GOOD LAWD!
---
And franklins
---
Make sure you do it before the ground erupts but this is a bloody splendid tactic!
---
Hmmmm you got actual evidence that he’s gonna the new killer? Plus even if he is this doesn’t block the fact that Stranger Things is 99% gonna be in the game
---
Id learn to play nurse or spirit. They are the only truly viable killers. They are the only killers that can power through the struggle of playing against the best of the best in the games current condition. And yes nurse is still the best on console. It's just harder to learn.
---
I posted concept for Sorority Row if you care to check it out! Hopefully, BHVR will notice! It’s my dream to have Cassidy in this game!
---
STRONGLY AGREE

As someone who's net drops out randomly, it better not be an instant "fuck you" for dcing.

Well it’s not really evidence but Netflix earlier announced that they were working on a project with Behaviour interactive

Footsteps as terror radius, yes please

Stop teasing me, daddy
---
I'll tell you this right now, as someone who has never played this game and hasn't had much interest in it. If they add a playable Hopper, I'm in.
---
I'm already good. Prestige 2 myers/ prestige 3 trapper, but games just aren't fun anymore. It's just the same thing over and over again.
---
I will gladly run prayer beads if I ever come across you
---
I'm genuinely sorry to hear it, until I upgraded my wifi card I was in the same boat as you.
---
Even though it's not your fault, sadly you're part of the problem. Hopefully it will motivate you enough to figure out why you're internet sucks so badly.
---
I hereby bestow upon you the most highly regarded compliment in the world...
---
ATA-BOY
---
Spirit hands down is the best of the bunch. Other are med-tier killers.
---
I've tried nurse before but she's just impossible to play. I think it's more the fact that the nurse is more limited on concoles then on PC. One of her worst takes on PS4 is the frame drops coming out of blinks
---
Demogorgon Killer, Barb Survivor confirmed
---
I've wanted to try out the clown but never got around it, seems like a fun killer
---
Wasn't disputing that.
---
Was just saying that it was four, not five in a row.
---
and really? Does it really matter that we've had a few in a row?
---
But there are times when the internet just fucks up at a specific time, and happens for a lot of people. People want to enjoy the game and don’t always have friends to play with, so they don’t have much of a choice. Yes, it’ll ruin other people’s game but it’s unfair for people who don’t purposely leave the game may that be from internet/electricity cutting off or device turning off unexpectedly.
---
Oh shit, I completely forgot about the fucking iRoN LuNGs perk
---
They need to make it so that you need atleast 2 gens done before hatch spawns if 4 players can't do atleast 2 gens not a single one of them deserves to escape for free
---
If this game is trash why’re you even taking the time to go to the subreddit of the game? And yes I know this is obviously a troll comment
---
this is going to get removed
---
Because theres a difference between being childish and playing the game. You're literally saying that, by your definitions, that you have every right to DC and ruin the game for the rest of the players because its "not fun" in your eyes. "Oh, you hit me? Im not having fun anymore, DC lol. Omg, why are you mad? I have every right?" Its a full of it, entitled response that says "I don't care what anyone else thinks, unless things are going the way I want them to, then everyone else in this match can just eat a dick." When you queue up for a match, you queue up to PLAY that match, not dip out the moment it stops "being fun" and ruining everyone else match. Go ahead and tell the devs when they impliment punishment on DC how you "were not having fun so I left and shouldn't be punished for it". Its completely fine to play a match and go "If im not having fun, ill stop playing". Thats fine, finish the match and turn the game off. But to cry like a child about how something isn't going your way and quitting out, well, its just that, childish. Thats what my point of "don't be childish playing video games" is. To not play like a entitled 10 year old who's dad has thrown every match of connect 4 they've ever played, not "hurr durr, video games are for fun but take them dead serious or else you're a kid".  TLDR is that if you're going to play a game, play it with respect and logic, not with a childish mindset.
---
action is coming
---
It's not totally impossible. Trust me. I use her on xbox from time to time and can do fairly well in red ranks. Unless there is some massive difference in frames between xbox and ps4, it's not the frames. It's just harder to learn than on pc because frames aren't as good.
---
Plot twist: Steve is the killer... Lady killer

Get Bubba. Franklin's Demise really annoys them flashlight survs.

You are approximately 9 months late

Better not get near his milk and cookies.
---
Hey, it's already exactly like dbd!
---
Ah.
---
Thanks.
---
I've always wanted to try Billy, just zooming around the map like a fucking car taking off lmao
---
You're probably right lmao.  
---
I did it this way because in the stream it was the David urging the Kate to DC.
---
Upvote purely for Jak and Daxter.
---
Yes daddy, destroy my guts.
---
Dead rats in the entities maze too
---
Why you think this is only on ps4? It is just how DbD is in general... if your a good killer, you can work with it and still win/have fun. If some one is looping you for ever, or you can simpely not kill/catch anyone it is just to high of a rank for you.
---
That is just the reason why ranks are here in tge first place (even if mm is broken)
---
I think it's around 2 seconds by default, less with addons. The trick to playing against Billy and leatherface is to realize that if you've put yourself in a position where they can get right up behind you, you're already dead. You've got to respect the chainsaw, and not get caught out of position. That means knowing where the nearest pallets and windows are, and making sure you can get to them before the killer can get behind you. If you don't know all the maps very well yet, then you may want to scout the area around a gen and find something you can run to. Good survivors always run with a plan. Find a pallet/window, and figure out where you are going to run next after you use it.
---
It's not that simple to say "oh the devs need to fix their game" EVERY update they break something. So any fix they make will break something because their code isn't optimized for performance either but nongame studio is better their code is basically spaghetti code
---
yeah I got adept freddy on accident before the rework 🤦‍♀️ probably bc I got potato survivors tho
---
This will be better when the rift comes out mate. It won't be long now either.
---
Noob3 is my fucking CELEBRITY CRUSH 😍😍😍
---
would make sense as Billy and not the demigorgan. The Flayed are controlled by a tentacle type monster. Would just be the Entity doing it instead of the Mindflayer. Plis its established that the entity can reach other dimensions and create pocket dimensions so it makes sense how the entity gor hold of it...
---
If they're too hard, then you should get better lmao.
---
Lol I always shake my head no at locker dwellers
---
I'm pretty sure i specifically said PS4 so i could see what other PS4 killers say(or xbox killers). Arguably it's less harder to play killer on PC than it is on consoles
---
I 100% being trolled and I fell face first because there's no way there's a human being who actually thinks like this. Playing against the spirit is Michael Jordan against me who played one year in 5th grade, but somehow I have to play or I'm toxic and salty. What kind of SJW white knight virgin logic is this? Kudos, I'm still baffled and know it's a joke. It's like the "gg ez your trash faghot" messages I get after the game of me looping a nurse at killer shack for longer then if I had looped 2 different killers thanks to entity blocking the window, but somehow I'm trash so I get some trash talking back only to realize it's a little kid and then feel bad. Not for giving knowledge but for how harsh I gave it. But you keep going because it's better entertainment them actually playing a game vs a majority of killers.
---
Exactly, so don’t add to it by becoming toxic
---
If you played against a doctor today that this happened with that might have been me, I'm sorry 😭
---
Can someone please ELI:5?
---
I've never played the game, I'm assuming it's getting a Netflix show?
---
What's this?
---
Is it really true, that there exists a man out there, that can actually make a stylish, and not absolutely shitty poster in SFM? My God...
---
Good riddance
---
But your build and add-ons are already decided, you can't switch them off if you realise you're not playing against "toxic" people. Just a thought.
---
You have prestige 3 trapper lol. Trust me your not good
---
15 mins for a first offence? LOL fucking NO!
---
I can not count the number of times I’ve had to leave a game due to bugs/lag alone. Used to get stuck in trees all the fucking time for example. DBD is far too buggy for that, sometimes you need to leave the game.
---
Thats not involving all the garbage games where say the killer just leaves everyone slugged to bleed out just to be a cunt, or survivors glitch to areas where they cant be hit, or someone burns a coldwind offering for the 10th game in a row.
---
Theres so much shit in dbd that being able to quit is the only saving grace
---
The opposite. This is a horror based multiplayer game where players can control either a survivor or killer. Many previous combinations of survivors and killers have been released as DLC (I.E Michael Myers and Laurie Strode from The Halloween Series). Stranger Things has a bit of a horror vibe going for it, and many speculate with pictures like this and some other evidence that the next killer survivor combo with be based on Stranger Things.
---
&gt;I have a hard time locating anyone by sound.
---
That is one of the strongest things that makes spirit strong, if you use audio to locate survivors well, you very well could have problems.
---
because of that, I'd recommend Legion or Clown, however Clown lacks the map control that Spirit and other high mobility killers have. Legion can hit multiple survivors and has killer instinct which helps with locating survivors once you find one.
---
Somewhere in this thread, the bo0bTree has been lurking...which of you, I wonder, is he?
---
The only baffling thing is that you think it's okay to ruin the game for everyone else in the lobby because you wanna cry.
---
Seems normal to me
---
And im saying that your logic is knowingly making the game worse for others, purposefully, and in a way the devs don't intend. you hate Spirit, sure, and thats fine. But she's in the game, and just DCing because you see thats who the killer is is the same thing as a parent telling a child that "no, you can't have ice cream for breakfast" and then stomping their feet and refusing to eat. You are argueing that "I should be entitled to RUIN THE GAME for others, because of something I personally disagree with." Not something thats broken, or unfair, or fundementally busted. You ruin the game for others because you decide "no, I don't want to play against that" and leave. THAT. is childish. THAT, is simply, without any doubt in my mind, EXACTLY the kind of person I hope is purged from DBD, because it is the kind of person who thinks they are entitled to certain matches, who are entitled to think that camping is bullshit and unfair no matter the circimstances, and that they'd rather damn their teammates then sit around for 3 minutes, or however long. You're that kind of player, and to be honest, it disgusts me that you can cling to this view, that hurting and ruining the game for others is acceptable because of some ill gotten notion that what you decide is "unfun" means that everyone else in the match just has to suck it up and accept that the survivors are now just doomed to lose unless the killer farms. You may believe whatever you want, but ruining the game for others, PURPOSEFULLY, and KNOWING that it what you are doing, with full understanding that you are making that choice, makes you a toxic scumbag, and I cannot wait until the day comes where you are banned from this game. PS, "Rping" on a reddit comment is super cringy, and you saying "we all want to be right" is simply wrong. I don't seek to be right, I seek understanding and logical conclusions. If you could provide me clear evidence that DCing when you see Spirit isn't ruining the game for other players, is what the devs intended, that dcing when you're not having fun is what the Devs WANT you to do, then fine, i'll agree with you. But until I see that, ill stick to the logical side of "Dcing is ruining the game, no matter the reason, hence why they intend to start punishing it, why the OP is showcasing these guys robbing him of a 4k because one dc'ed, then acted like he did something wrong, and why there are so many people complaining about the issues of DCing just ruining the fun of the game, as it robs BBQ, it robs bloodpoints, and it just fucks over the rest of the survivors because you're a p3 claudette and got T3 myered and died 4 seconds into a chase. So go ahead. Provide me evidence that Dcing is there for the reasons you state, and that you're not simply being a prick and ruining the game? BTW, calling someone a moron in a debate immediatly makes them stop taking you seriously, because logically, we're adults, and can have differing opinons on something and not despise eachother or view eachother as intellectually inferior. That being said, if you continue to cling to this viewpoint at this point, without providing the evidence i've asked for, then you are clinging blindly to something, ignoring the facts, and that is being willingly ignorant, which is the true sign of stupidity. So i'll say it again, to make it absoulutly clear. Show me how your Dcing is healthy for the game, and not being a prick that ruins it for other people. And if you can't then you admit you are being a selfish jerk. Its not about "playing by my rules" its about playing at all. Just because I went spirit, why should you just screw over three other people who want to play the game? How is that justified, or fair, or healthy for the game as whole? answer me that, along with the evidence.
---
Right on, thanks for the quick reply
---
What do you expect a survivor to do though? run in a straight line and die in 30 seconds?
---
Ever tried a slug build and also 3 gen strategy at the same time?
---
No prob bob. If you're thinking of getting into it, this is a really great place to start, but feel free to DM me. The community is always looking for new players.
---
tbh, I actually didn't know he did his own outro song, this just went over my head.
---
Leatherface can know teleport while charging his chainsaw
---
I'd be ok with it, instameds and keys feel just as unfair as moris and red addons.
---
That's why people don't like the game: They don't even want to learn the map in the first place
---
Yeah the mori is completely optional, I get that. But why would you "let" anyone escape regardless of how they play? My only problem was that his solution to people being "toxic" was to be "toxic" himself. It's the kinda mentality that puts this community in the shit.
---
boxe fixer when?
---
April fools event??
---
Wtf?
---
Killers are literally equipped to destroy survivors before they can do gens.
---
I mean this in thebest way possible- get better at patrolling gens and applying pressure.
---
I used to think generators got done way too quickly as well, but then I started patrolling better and applying pressure better, and I don't think I've had a game where any more than two generators got finished per game in like a month, and that's playing killer 5 out of 7 days a week- maybe one here or there, but I was literally killing survivors so quickly that I took off no ed because it was a useless perk.
---
I don't mean this to say oh, I'm a God tier killer, I mean it more as in it just depends on how well you apply pressure. Because if you're doing well enough, they're not going to be able to get generators done, they're going to be more preoccupied being chased, unhooking their friends, Etc. Especially if you're playing a character like the pig, the plague, or the legion, they all have things that make it take even longer to get things done.
---
I hope my little bit of insight helped, good luck, I believe in you!
---
Same tbh
---
We need more ripped survivors.
---
Yeah I realized that after watching a YouTuber talking about the subject. But still it's really nice. Tho both would also be great. Just to promote both at the same time
---
To use the bloody pallet and run to a window, lose line of sight and try to hide. To play the game how it was meant to be played, not run in circles for an entire match.
---
I know that I’m just saying that if he realizes they aren’t toxic he doesn’t have to kill them which is probably what he’ll do
---
Spread me on that hook daddy
---
someone's probably gonna alt f4 in the loading screen when they see the secret offering
---
First, every comment you have posted has referred to me as being childish. I'm not the type to just take shit, even if it is on reddit. I've only been on reddit for 2 months so I don't know this r ping lingo but I talked to the "poster"?  And apologized for ranting about killers I face and including him. As for you and your need of "evidence " speaking on being denied " ice cream for breakfast" PLEASE understand I owe you nothing. You are asking me to explain myself on comments you've made about me not comments I've said. DC makes the game near impossible for the other surv yes but I chose not to play. In your terms those surv didn't get their "ice cream" and the killer didn't get blood points. Sorry about that. Move the fuck on. It's that simple and probably going to be exactly what I do about this conversation. I will gladly admit your totally right and I'm wrong and so on if it gets me out of this. When you pull yourself away from the screen and game you realize that it's only that and when your mad it's only you that's affected not me. I'm not mad I dc. I'm not when some else DC s. Maybe a little mad with surv hiding in the corners while I loop killer for eternity but that's why I'm there. I like playing tag. I run ooo for that reason, but you know what happens? I don't get chased until every is dead or I unhook, usually. Just come off it. The only thing that needs to be understood is you are trying to tell me how i have to be and i never once said you had to do something. That's the difference. Your upset because I won't play by your rules so you want daddy dev's to get rid of me. We've probably never even played against each other or with each other. It's just "those type" of players your upset with. Ever heard the saying if you met an asshole, it's just an asshole but if you keep meeting assholes, you're the asshole? Well, let me be just one more in your chain.
---
David and Adam are like the only "cool' male survivors.
---
I love her resting bitch face. Just give her a bar of soap to scrub off the oil and mud from under her arms.
---
I think it can look neat on white people but they didn't execute it quite well here.
---
Time is static in the entities realm she would be the same since when she got pulled in.
---
That’s a lot of words for a shit take, let’s dive into why.
---
The characters remain the same from the beginning of the season to the end of the third with incredibly with either minute differences or inevitable changes—not character growth. So while the boys grow older, they don’t have any substantial change of their roles—Steve is a jackass from start to finish, Hopper is still a gruff cop, Joyce is still the whiney mom, etc. This lack of change is pretty much textbook definition of flat character. There is hardly any depth to these characters at all, and if you think there is then it’s a sad reflection on how shallow your pool is on character development. There is no ‘actual growth’ as you randomly assert, the characters are the same as they began.
---
When making a value judgement like good or bad, it’s usually that we are holding a preponderance of qualities on balance to assess the content—pacing, uniqueness, profundity, etc. Since most horror genres are pretty linear in many of their qualities, uniqueness then becomes a significant attribute. Since Stranger Things is just a mash-up of tired tropes in a really predictable fashion, it makes it a relatively weak story; therefore I will call it bad. So then to go to this weird place of making cum-for-brains examples to try to  make such a platitude of a point is absolutely bewildering. “Hurrrr durrr, movie can have x quality and y quality, but also possible for x quality and not y quality, hurrr durrr, Punnett square of possibilities.”
---
I’m sorry that you’re so triggered that you actually have to White Knight a Netflix tv show with high school grade arguments, lol. I don’t use “snobby arguments” to make myself “feel better,” I use accurate assessments to express my disappointment in Behavior to pander to the audience with a forgettable fad faux-horror series.

Too many replies I've lost you even though you keep saying the same thing not realizing that I've never said any of that. Jendenise,noob3 all dc ing to get to green ranks, totally not cool in my book because it's exp surv vs inexperienced killers. Me dc ing because it's (exactly what your accusing me of) toxic killer isn't helping anyone but I'm not trying to help anyone. I don't want to play against them so I try for another game. YOU ARE NOT UNDERTSANDING THE WORDS IM TYPING! YOUR POINTS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MY COMMENTS! THE SAME WAY MY INITIAL COMMENT WAS NOT DIRECTED AT THE WRAITH PERSONALLY.
---
Thats exactly the reason they have stated multiple times
---
They cant ban someone for DC'ing because of the p2p system
---
They said once dedicated servers come out they can start rolling out bans
---
groovy
---
Oh another super OP monster and garbage survivor? 
---
One who's just really good at camping a generator?
---
What do you mean derank? I'm rank 10 and keep getting paired with 18-19 survivors. Ain't my fault.
---
I stopped reading after you addressed a imaginary audience and compared pro athletes to dbd... well played troll well played
---
just do bones
---
&gt; (September is when dedicated servers are scheduled to go live.)

It actually is "this summer"

Summer lasts until 23rd of September

Dwight, Bill, David and Jake are pretty cool imo
---
Yeah we gay

Keep scrolling
---
I cant do the hatch trophy...
---
the list is so long I'd rather learn all possible board states of chess

They’re just trying to end the game. If they didn’t go at you, you’d sit there crouching yo and down

She's just shy

Meg has not been invited to the entity’s special dinner party.

Btw, I didn't get 0 points in sacrifice, i just took the screenshot before the points loaded in.
---
You're not taking into account the reasons for people DC'ing, you are assuming it's just random chance that any one player disconnects. In reality survivors are more likely to RQ than the killer due to game asymmetry.
---
&gt; So I have 1250 auric cells. I’m a survivor main - played killer twice.  
---
Why did you bring this up? it has nothing to do with the rest of the suggestion
---
God damn you got me good. How long have you been doing this? I think this is my first time. You took my v card for internet trolling!

This already exists... If you DC too often you get a week, then 2 week autoban
---
Feel free not to read the rest of it. 1. its not an imaginary audience, other people WILL read these, its inevtivble. 2. Im not comparing pro atheltes. I said "basketball players" and "hockey players". Not "PRO basketball players". Besides, you're missing the entire point, Im saying that quitting out of a "match" wether it be sports or a game is just being unsportsmen like, and is looked down upon worldwide. Its not a troll, or anything like that. But no, close your eyes, refuse to read the whole message, and go "la la la, I can't hear you" Its really showing just how "right" you are.

there isn't enough survivors.

Lol I'm actually laighing

Can we be reddit friends somehow so when you do this to someone else I can follow along? I'm new so I don't know.
---
Still way too OP, even for a Hex Perk, it essentially let's you one shot the rest of the game. Blindness does nothing compared to that
---
Why are there ranks, and why wouldn't be survivor also be harder then?
---
I understand that a mouse and keyboard has a advantage over a controller,  but even then you shud be abel to vind a rank that suits your playstyle.
---
On pc it is pc vs pc, on console it is console to console, the game is no diverent!
---
Right, got it. Thats all then, have a good evening mr ignorant.
---
I play both, but I prefer killer. I have mocked killer mains to death in this sub until I stopped playing survivor for a while then played killer. Got my black ass slapped back to reality, whatever opinions you may have on voice comms((I don't hate them, I used them too)) they still give survivors an unfair advantage, it's worse when you have high ranks going against you and bullying you when you're a low ranked killer.
---
You really not going to help me turn off notifications?
---
Remember be in the game map for best results
---
That blood effect, I don't know why but I think it would've looked even cooler if the Legion title was cut in half.
---
They do but it's not a high prio because console is basically a spinoff
---
It’s the anti-bear circle
---
These truly are confusing times.
---
yeah it feels a bit bad when i do very well at chases and down people quickly (especially as bubba who oneshots) and get a swift 4k, and then get bronze chaser
---
The next killer must be GIRL and the survivor GIRL TOO for this:
---
- Legion | Jeff
---
- Plague | Jane
---
- GF | ASH
---
This next killer must be a girl and the survivor too, soo...
---
I DCd from 5 games total the past 3 weeks out of a hundred (shitty internet) and got banned for 1 week and might lose my account if i DC again
---
And those cunts who actually exploits the game won't get banned :)
---
That would give way more incentive to buy the cosmetics you like too. Which = more money for the game. I’m just saying why not?
---
It is broken because of rank reset and a to big gab with ranks, like a rank 15 killer vs green/purple ranks happens some times.
---
A rank 15 killer can never win against purple or red ranks, unless they are to greedy
---
Can type out a novel on ethics in video games but  not a single glance at a newbie redditor asking for help. Now I know how your mom feels when I bail afterwards...like it was all for nothing...regret.
---
I don't think he means winning or losing, he meant toxicity. I could see where you're coming from though.
---
But if a killers lunging, maybe you should stay inside til the hit misses rather than jumping into it
---
I miss Old Freddy and actually want Demogorgon to be like Old Freddy, but I don't want it to have an exact 1:1 copy of Old Freddy's power set. Devs even started part of the reason why they did the Freddy rework was because Old Freddy's power set was frustrating on the survivor's end. (Aura reading made it nearly impossible to escape a "Tunnel Freddy" who only slept went after one survivor at a time. Slow action speed making progression nearly impossible, waking up via skill check alerted Freddy to your location to re-sleep, etc.)
---
If they can give it a similar power set that's more fun for both sides I'd be happy.
---
Daily Mission: Try to steal from the Basement Bubba's chest and stay alive. 100 000 BP.

Oh God that is the peak of cursed images

White Walkers are about as close to horror as demogorgons, so fuck it, GoT chapter next.
---
I have over 2k hours on console and never once have I seen a hacker. Didn’t think you could hack on console

Sir this is a Wendy’s

Info?

New background
---
Sorry for the camera quality, had to use my phone cause of ps4s shitty system where u cant share photos (well i at least dont know of one).
---
I used what can be considered THE BEST ADD ONS FOR LEGION AND AS SOON AS I FIND PEOPLE THEY DC. The only guy that didnt dc was cool though, i looked for hatch with him. Cheers to that guy for being cool
---
Sorry man I was just typing it now, its up now.
---
Hoes are into Guro am I affraid.
---
More like just a skin for Billy cause you lose Evil Within
---
how did you miss the David when you were hooking that Bill lol
---
Well done
---
Once I did 4 gens myself, found a rainbow map in a chest, took out ruin and noed and got raincorned by the killer at the last second all while never being hit the whole match besides that one time.
---
Same
---
I was half asleep the whole way through! Lol
---
Dwight is cannonically a pussy, Bill is cool but hes old, Tapp is not cool at all imo, and Jake looks like so much of a nobody and none of his clothing looks good for.
---
The thought Madding roar doc gives me convulsions
---
Well me and you have some vastly different views, I suppose. Hell, I find ghostface a lot more scary than pinhead inherently. A regular guy in a mask stalking and planning every move to give us no way of escape? A lot more scary to me than some otherworldly being
---
those last 2 seem way OP...
---
Maddening roar would need some cool down too. And I don't think having it "activatible" would work given how some killers have so many different control buttons already.
---
A fresh trail is way too strong. Basically, if a survivor is injured and youre near their blood you'll see their aura? What's the counter play?
---
Ontop of that I doubt, or at least hope it won't be the demigorgan. Billy as the Flayed would make more sense imho
---
Get spirit dlc and buy clown.
---
Self-Care
---
You are that toxic asshole bullying people though.
---
Nurses Calling
---
Would be cool if it was like Freddy and could send them into dream space/ upside down
---
I can't find anywhere on reports doing anything, at least positive feedback, or severity of actions influencing possible suspensions. I get we don't want to swing the ban hammer around, but some of these people only play an hour or two, a day, every few or so days and they consistently do loser killer shit when they reappear.
---
I feel like console dbd is missing out on a less-scummy playability due to lack of punishment towards very toxic players.  
---
People consider tunneling toxic, but I'm talking about the actual toxic people that just waste everyone's time.
---
it wasn't a hack it was a glitch that players abused
---
but then you are also punishing people who's pc crashed, or whos roommate accidentally turned off the router. 
---
Wouldn't it be better to bring the game to a state where people dont actually want to disconnect?
---
That's called addiction
---
This applies to all games man. Sadly nothing will change. I appreciate the positive attitude though
---
Yep
---
I only played him once but by what I saw you have to hold the power button without reaching 100% and when you are near enough you can charge and hit easily
---
Happy cake day bro
---
you are maybe a bit young to see further than your nose regarding people "coolness" i don't know.
---
I think i would have see thinks as you do when i was 16.
---
Tbh madden roar should be a addon not a perk it would be really weird to see other killers "roar" lmao
---
almost like that was the joke.
---
Just so you know, you can get an Adept killer achievement without necessarily needing a 4k, so a survivor getting hatch doesn't really matter. Got Adept Legion with only a 3k.
---
I think that it's power may des activate after breaking a pallet, like the charge of the hillbilly
---
I don’t get it?
---
Roar does have a 60 second cooldown. And a fresh trail would only reveal the aura while touching the blood stain. So the killer would have to stand on the blood stain or carefully walk along the trail to continue to see the aura. Survivors could always run no mither.
---
A ok, I thought it was like the legion, only that destroying the pallet
---
Raincorned? Lmao
---
When you fully charge your chainsaw, you Have 0.5 or 1 Second your chainsaw being very fast turning around. You can use it to injure looping people
---
It's called efficiency.

Yeah because Balanced Landing doesn't have enough issues already.

Genius move there by David. Get out while you can
---
Yikes, no need to go through my profile bro.
---
Besides, I'm trying to use the same definition of "cool" that they were using for Feng and others. I think what some people want for them is just to be more attractive which they don't really need to be.
---
It also would not destroy the pallet just let the beast jump over it and attack the survivor on the other side
---
What app did you make this with?
---
Myers would just yawn?
---
citameM
---
What killer recently had usable perks let alone strong perks ?
---
While I do agree, I still hope it is Steve just for the Scoops Ahoy outfit
---
Es possible?
---
I like the concept of the teriffying reach but 6% is not much. Also I don't think that it would be viable perk even if the numbers were bigger. There are just perks that work better and help you more. This one is situational.
---
The rat emoji is a bit odd. Rats in stranger things were used as biomass for the mind flayer to get a physical from before it started to consume people. So maybe the killer is Billy under his control or the creature from the hospital that chances Jonathon and Nancy?
---
I use Thrilling Tremors a lot.  Combine it with pop goes the weasel and agitation and your walking right to one of the gens not blocked and popping it.
---
If the survivors mess up and even get close to a 3 gen situation they aren’t gonna have an easy time. 
---
You can still throw Ruin on there if you need the extra time but I usually do Discordance or Nurses.
---
I think it cloud be Hopper, you know, he died so in story he cloud just get in to the fog.
---
Otz is my favorite.  Used to watch him when I played Dark Souls a bunch, when I saw him playing DBD I was so happy.
---
With the kind of perk it sounds like,suppose to intimadate survivors i dont think groans or anything like that would be intimadating to the survivors. But bhvr probably would reuse sounds since the killer opening door is literally them hiting thr door which is lazy imo,same can be said about the hatch closing animations only like 4 or less of the hatch closing animations are unique..
---
Oh yea its big brain time
---
Jump rope with intestines? That sounds more like a Freddy move. 
---
Myers would just kill you.
---
Look who’s shittin in the tall grass
---
I REALLY like these. Would probably have to be tweaked but they're good.
---
As an Ash main, what's the disadvantage? Aren't all Survivors essentially the same (not including perks)?
---
Finally my Evil Dead x Stranger Things fanfic is coming true
---
Sums up solo survival.
---
Ah ok would have been nice if you didn't require that add on
---
Ash has some of the biggest hitboxes out of all the survivors and he's the loudest aswell.
---
I used an old USB I bought years ago, so you should be good with any. You will have to format it though (just plug it in and it should ask you).
---
Happy birthday! Mine Is 19th
---
Huh, didnt know that. Thanks!
---
Only if its a survivor perk lol
---
Aw, poor baby ghostface. I'm sad we lost a potential new member of the community because of toxicity.
---
Idk if I would call that toxic. It seems as if the Killer was trying to make extra points. And maybe the Killer was looking for the hatch for you but you kept escaping. (This is something I seen Killers do before and even with me). But it throws me off cause it did hit you right before the hatch so Im not sure.
---
I found this pretty interesting and they seem to be adding and improving weekly

That's what the rumours suggest, yes.
---
Remember how the flayed get really strong and desperate when they get hot? If the killer is Billy, a cool perk could be that when he gets blinded, all survivors get exposed for 15 seconds. IDK, that could be over or underpowered, what are are your ideas?
---
This was back when you could glitch the killers loadout and give any killer any other killers power
---
Steve better be the survivor or I'll be pissed

made with mematic

Hag is so fun.

This topic has already been discussed extensively over several devstreams yet people keep making these topics smh
---
Imagine DCing for hatch against a Wraith lol
---
#MEGA RIP
---
if you have any ideas for a sort of killer comp , then don’t be afraid to say them .  i don’t want the killer mains to be left out either , but i’m not really sure on what would be a good compilation for them that wouldn’t be too long and time consuming .
---
We don't all wank to the dev streams like you apparently do.
---
Ugh that’s a pain :(
---
You are correct
---
Now say that to the Hag
---
Ye, but I guess you can use this to make different perk choices and whatnot. I actually am glad I switched.
---
Why autodidact plus med kit? Isn’t that kinda redundant or did you get the kit in a chest?
---
If you bring predator does it effect your phase walk? I struggle with following scratches but predator makes it easy.
---
The NOED buff means a killer could be chasing someone with +22% speed. Doesn't sound balanced.
---
You're begging the devs to better the game but pay no attention to information directly from the developers themselves? Unique strategy friend.
---
Basically a lot of the shit from console will go from base game to dlc. Have fun.
---
I believe they confirmed that they will not be presenting anything at Gamescom
---
Yes, Predator does work during Phase Walk!

Yes daddy rearrange my guts the way only you know :wink:

[This is what this post sounds like to me.](https://youtu.be/DUzEWJLOLNI?t=55)
---
It's very, very hard to take you seriously OP.
---
*breathes heavily*
---
This super reminds me of the DBD Alpha ready screen. Lighting looks fairly similar.
---
Only a disaster if the killers were kept as is. I would be perfectly fine with the survivors being able to fight back if it was a bunch easier and quicker to down someone. The meta of the game would change then. It would be less one person chased and the rest do gens and change to save the downed person. Definitely tricky to balance, but it can be fun for both sides.
---
Lol leave me alone I got frustrated just writing that
---
Who's begging? stop clutching at straws friend.
---
Not even 7 AM and I've had my laugh for the day. Thanks.
---
Mind explaining HOW? pwyf is 15 at max 6% with noed is a max of 21% also pwyf loses its stacks each time you attack anything. So yea you technically could if you were willing to hook 3 different people and then get 3 stacks of pwyf but at that point you've pretty much thrown the game for a temporary buff lol.
---
Of all the hints that we're getting stranger things, "Indie games devs will make announcements" If by far the weakest one we've had.
---
Billy Myers
---
weird, never heard that
---
4k hours?
---
It's not meant to be a hint that we are getting Stranger Things. Just an idea of when what is already obvious to us will be officially announced.
---
Now just do it again 6 more times and you can P3 bill with all abilities. 
---
(I can’t wait till the grind is reduced)
---
Congrats on majoring it to 1,000,000 points. I took a screenshot of mine the first time I did it too.
---
It's been long enough that people should be going to where they actually belong.  OP's situation is likely that the higher rank survivors SWF with their r16 buddy specifically so they could do this.  Another reason I will never, ever respect those who play SWF exclusively.  Play solo, you little bitches.  It's not hard.
---
Only if he takes his shirt off
---
Hooking 3 different people isn’t throwing the game at all. With this, the killer gets much stronger as the game goes on, and it becomes much harder to cleanse the totem, with less people and the killer able to reach it faster. And assuming someone ran it with PWYF, that’s a maximum 40% speed boost, which is game over for even the beast survivors.
---
Mind explaining your criticisms more in detail? Remember part of the intent behind these changes was to equalize the strength of all the hex perks. For example Ruin starts at the beginning of a match while devour hope doesn't do anything until you get at least 2 totems. Meaning ruin is far more consistent and thus powerful in 99% of the situations you find yourself in.  By making devour hope not be lit until your actually benefiting from the hex I don't see how thats any more overpowered then ruin slowing the game down buying you more time to kill people. At 2 tokens all your really gaining is some temporary movement speed.
---
Rare?  Maybe.  But it's devastating to newer players when it happens.
---
New boy band that's murdering in the charts.
---
Where are you getting 40%? Its 2% per token with a max of 3 tokens meaning at max its 6% barely over 1 pwyf stack...
---
What a forehead
---
Whoops, missed the token cap. Still OP though
---
Holy fuck, a Jak meme. I've never seen one before. I love it.
---
She doesn't derank tho.
---
Yes, you can have as many hex perks as you want.
---
Yeah started today already on episode 5.
---
"Devs please add this"
---
They already talked about what they'll be implementing pertaining to this topic over several devstreams for months now 
---
"WOW JACK OFF TO DEVS MUCH" 
---
🤔
---
No one escapes death doesnt become a active totem till the endgame but yes.
---
Is "jumping rope with intestines" similar to saying "getting up in them guts"? I'm trying to learn the slang that the youths say.
---
6% speed which any good killer will get very quickly, and if they’re playing a killer with good map control will easily be able to protect the totem. NOED, while OP, does have a very limited time it can be used.
---
I don't derank on purpose because I don't get any satisfaction from stomping low ranked scrubs, I can see why people would do it though.
---
In order to play killer at higher ranks you have to play fairly meta, its less about fun and more about which killer/perk will help you the most when the SWF reds are gen-rushing in 4 minutes flat. This environment sucks for killers while survivors get more consistent and capable teammates at higher ranks which make games more fun for everybody in the team. When you play against capable survivors often the game feels out of your hands as killer. 
---
Not everybody who deranks hates the challenge, some people just like to have fun instead of gritting their teeth every time they get DSd.
---
This game is actually better for that then most nowadays, theres only even one stereotypically "hot girl" So this is kind of a strange game to start this argument in.
---
Nea is perfect play?
---
Top 10 characters who can defeat thanos
---
I've played a ton of league and it's not even comparable, this is WAY less toxic than league
---
It doesn't have to be logical. A tip: if you play survivor, play with friends because there's a lot of midrank survivors that are entiteled pricks that intentionally derank to feel accomplished
---
Yeah well then start off with warnings. I highly doubt that’s happening multiple times a day, if it is. You clearly shouldn’t bother playing that day if you can’t physically play due to electricity/ internet cut offs. If people don’t leave games for a while they can be on ‘Good behaviour’ and their warnings get cleared. If they leave multiple times over a few days they’re in bad behaviour and should be receiving temporary suspensions. If they stay in consistent good behaviour for a day or so they’ll go back to warnings. It’s definitely doable and really think they should be implementing this. It makes sense. Either that or they remove the “leave game” button. That way people will stop getting used to the easy leave and re-search of it all. Closing and reopening the application is tedious and takes time and literally getting rid of the leave game button alone would reduce the amount of DCs you come across
---
Naisaa
---
Yeah fuck people who just want to have a good time with their friends that probably all bought the game specifically to play with each other stupid assholes
---
it’s never too late :D
---
The shape requiem
---
Smurfing? I used to be rank 1 every month for 1 1/2 years straight, these days I don't play a lot of DBD so when I come back I am close to rank 20 every single time. 
---
Most of the so called "smurfs" are people affected by the rank reset, there is no reason to smurf seeing as how you will gain ranks incredibly fast if you are good.
---
Imagine if you could share Killer’s Power with other killers.
---
Sorry friend I just don't see it, 6% isn't that massive you get 5% from the first stack of bloodlust which you get after 15 seconds of chasing someone, it doesn't break the game. Nor has pwyf which lets you get up to 15% and isn't a hex in the first place.
---
Myers and Nea switching places
---
more like 5
---
Doesn’t have to be in a day, it can be throughout the week. If the warnings stay for only a day it’d be quite useless. If I’ve bought the game I can’t just not play in case my console just turns off on its own throughout the whole week or however long these ‘warnings’ last. If they’re going to do it your way they should at least let you have a chance of joining back so you don’t get any punishment.

Coincidence? I think not
---
Oh for fucking months they talked about it? but it isn't implemented yet? so I shouldn't talk about it? yep sure thing boss.
---
get out
---
Yep and plus I don't think it's going to be a Stranger Things chapter either. Out of all the options they have presented to them I don't think Stranger Things would be on the top of their list. I'm guessing it's probably going to be an original chapter they'll come up with
---
Something like this happened to me as well I was at the wall a healthy survivor came in I hit him then he ran around the pier and I bodyblock the corner he didn’t know what was happening and hit him again then hook him.
---
!RemindMe 3 days
---
which is good
---
Yes which is why michael was the most common killer to use the chainsaw with, it still worked for every other killer
---
No.
---
But didn't BHVR make it clear they never wanted creature style killers?
---
I vaguely remember an interview around legion release where they claimed something along the lines of wanting their killers to only be humans for simplicity sake.
---
If Michael were real his biggest threat would be the horde of fangirls constantly trying to fuck him
---
nice, you fixed the same perk showing up multiple times in one build
---
The best part is Chainsaw Myer's terror radius is 0

True though I remember going from PS4 to PC and tbh the performance on the PC version makes it all worth it IMO (though having to get all characters again is a pain, I currently only have mike Myers and lurie as bought dlc so far on PC) but bc of PC and watching good streamers I’ve made it to rank 6 highest so far.
---
Mmmm, delicious.
---
This is what hell looks like.
---
Flair checks out
---
Banana guy. Nice. Finally a killer that demands respect.
---
I’m a solo player and how I got better honestly was watching how other top dbd players play (on both survivors and killer) this helped me so I recommend if u have some time watch some gameplay from either Monto or Tru3tallent (who I watch)  so you can see what u need to do to be better. Also as for the maps you’ll get used to them overtime as I did
---
oh god yes, MORI ME MOMMY
---
The rank system tends to force you towards the mid levels unless you're actually trying hard to get higher. In fact, you cannot derank further than rank 15 anyway.
---
Just keep playing, if you are getting found first and killed very quickly, you should depip relatively often. Anywhere between 5-15 can be a mess of killers, from long time veterans to inexperienced players who are finding the same thing as you are now.
---
Collect teachables, work on your running, and eventually you will improve, but yes it is a pretty shitty rank system for the beginning.
---
1000 per totems, up to 5000 per 5 totems.
---
1500 per hex. Points are awarded for boldness category.
---
Honestly doing totems is always good for both points and preventing noed. But if points alone, it's not so worthy. Chases gets you way more points.
---
Ok then
---
I promise that you will have a fun time :)
---
The quality of the image makes it perfect for a cursed image!
---
It's an achievement. As survivors, you have to escape using only their 3 perks. As killer, you have to earn merciless (double pip) with only their 3 perks.
---
How
---
This is going to replace the whale in my nightmares.
---
Hopefully you like the changes and find use out of the perk selection feature now !
---
I’m thinking of waiting as I don’t have that kind of money at the moment to be honest. We will see though because I don’t want to loose all the progress I’ve gotten so far. Thank you :))
---
Debt would just make me not want to play dbd, I think it’d be better if there was just a timer on when you could queue if you disconnect. Like, if you’ve never disconnected then it’s a short timer, but if you disconnect every match the timer goes up a lot
---
Mind flayer most definitely won't be the killer for the sole reason that BHVR themselves said they never wanted non-human killers (or at least not for a LONG time)
---
And as much as I'd like the Demogorgon, it also kind of falls into that "creature" category (although it's humanoid in its adult state).  But what would the demogorgon's abilities be?
---
Old Freddy? The whole point of the Freddy update was because old Freddy was pretty bad.  Not as bad as a lot of people claim, but still pretty bad.  It would also essentially double the surface area of the map the killer would have to go through to find survivors, assuming they keep the two world idea close to what it is in the show.  If we're talking about its use of portals to go between our world and the upside down, I don't see any great way of handling it.  Other than making it similar to how the Hag sets her traps: open a portal where you are.  In which case it's pretty much useless.
---
Crouching/go down on all fours? There's already enough killers with that ability, the only difference in that case is that the Demogorgon would go faster instead of slower.
---
Again, STRANGER THINGS SEASON 3 SPOILER
---
&gt;!But Billy?
---
Pretty straightforward, and he's clearly capable of being a killer since he got over 30 people sacrificed to the mind flayer.  Granted he didn't kill them himself, he did manage to get them incapacitated and bring them to the mind flayer.!&lt;
---
He could have a good range of abilities, it's not like there are already a fair share of "basic killers" without "superpowers" or whatever that still work out: Bubba, Trapper, Hillbilly...
---
aside from a couple dozen more traps to spam as Hag, the only trophy I need for platinum is to grab someone off of 3 Nurse blinks. At this point I might just let survivors farm with me and just grab one that way.
---
Maybe it will be later in the day??
---
We’re all fropessionals here
---
All survivor perks are confirmed toxic and op.
---
He didn't use DH. You could see Bill's blood splash right before the Adrenaline kicked in and he was still injured.
---
Gotta love how Jeff also somewhat contributed to that
---
I've been saying this for ages, I know it'd take a lot of time and effort but it'd make them feel more unique in that regard other than "lol basically cosmetic".
---
Or when you do 4 gens, Open a gate and go back for someone on hook with noed active, save them and then die to end game collapse as no one else opened the other gate.
---
That's what i'm currently doing. Painreliever has been a godsent for me because of his full match commentaries where he explains what and why he's doing certain things at key moments. Monto and tru3 has helped me be More critical of my game. I have a long and Rocky road ahead of me, but I'll propably learn it by playing. Thanks for your advice dude! (:
---
Now *this* is art.
---
I’d say go for the nurse teachables. Stridor is great for finding someone after you hit them with your power, thanatophobia is great to slow the game down  since after hitting someone you see everyone else, and nurses calling is great because survivors will usually heal after mending. (It’s worth mention that nurses calling will not let you see mending survivors)
---
No I'm not saying that, but I wish the meta wasn't all that, killers does few mistakes: may lose the game
---
Survivor do a lot of mistakes: who cares lol *insta heals in front of the killer*
---
Hopefully killer builds see way more varietion since killers don't have any crutch perks, and don't talk about ruin, no one likes 2 minutes lasting game, and NOeD is counterable before it even activates
---
I barely play Killer, but I've always had that mindset, if someone DC's or suicides on hook not even a few minutes in I'll ease up and if someone else does it I'll just farm, it's not fun to have to work through 5 gens because two shitheads got mad and left because they got found first.
---
Um sacrifices take away corpses it would never work because he would literally just be an M1 killer with no abilities unless he performs a mori which people would bitch about. Good idea for a F13 game part 2 because it just works more with the higher killrate and body count
---
Match making is a bit weird. It’s on the devs year-plan to fix match making soon
---
I like mother, the other 2 are wayyyyy too op, scratch marks are a lot more vital then you think. For the other one, I like the idea of taking away negative effects but just getting hit is way too easy to get rid of it.
---
It got buffed recently to 1000 per totem, 1500 per hex totem.
---
While I do agree people who DC should be punished the game should have a way to know who did it on purpose and who didn’t. Not every single DC out there is intentional
---
Sole survivor
---
a gentle reminder that when every surv goes into lockers the killer will just sit at the hook. 
---
That Nea sounds like a dipshit tho
---
I can see where you’re coming from but Stranger Things from a business standpoint alone should absolutely be at the top of their list. Whether you like the series or not it is with out doubt one of if not the most popular thing in pop culture today and will instantly boost sales and popularity, especially ahead of the switch port release.
---
2 litre coke
---
Yea but then fans from whatever game/movie the dlc is from will play dbd
---
I dont know why they glorify DC so much - if you would do that in any kind of team game, you would be flamed to fuckin crisp for saying such bullshit
---
But in this game? Full of children that think their own fun is what matters the most
---
I have the same issue. I think there isn't enough players, depending on rank. I also feel like there are more people playing killer. I wasn't able to play on my console for a couple seasons. My killer reset to 20 (😭) and I am waiting for over 30 minutes. 
---
I have read on the dbd forums that the devs are expecting a big influx of players when the next chapter drops. Hopefully that will help.
---
&gt; where i was constantly sitting on gens but not fully popping them unless they were unsafe
---
what the goddamn hell are you talking about
---
I've been saying this for a while, I got a ton (probs a lot more) moris myself that I refuse to use because they're op. When I do I always hook twice before using it so it's fair. 
---
I always say ultrarare offerings and addons (like one shot hatchets, insta meds etc) are op and ruin the game as even though survivors can just bring ultrarares as well, chances are you wont both be bringing op items in the same game to even it out.
---
im going to come
---
lol OK just judge me without even knowing me. Im not that kinda guy that tbags on the exit gate mate. Im more chill and type a ggwp in the after chat of get fucked by a good Survivor or good killer so calm down buddy
---
I'd like to note the meme isn't mine. It was shared to me by a friend and thought y'all might enjoy it.
---
So in the time that it takes to actually implement bans you're telling me that the community would be stupid enough to not notice that ZERO bans are happening? Yea right. They did the right choice by being honest because either way it couldn't happen until dedicated servers, lying would have just created more discordance between the devs and community
---
If you want the best just use spirit burst however I would learn the game without any exhaustion perks it makes a lot better then most people
---
Deja Vu is a pretty situational perk and you shouldn't run it.
---
Oooooh batman, I was born in the darkness.
---
You named your thumbnail big giant TOXIC 
---
Either you want attention to your shitty channel
---
Or you are toxic
---
So next time shout "i am an attention whore" or be actually toxic and earn some respect through being consistent because now you arent either
---
This happens occasionally to me too, I swear they said they fixed it?
---
Executed with impunity!
---
Depends on how you play
---
that is ridiculous
---
nea was totally right about you
---
what a fuckng waste of time when Ruin is up especially
---
One of the lucky few, welcome to the club!
---
You’re lucky. My game just kicked me out halfway through games all the time. I posted this on reddit and their forums multiple times but never got an acknowledgement. Just stopped playing, and started playing games that actually work :)
---
This would be the quickest purchase I ever made if Steve or Nancy are the survivors
---
I cannot find matches on ps4 just as well neither as a killer nor a survivor, on my main rank 10 account or backup rank 20 account. It’s quiet in here,, so quiet.
---
Even though it’s somewhat a good concept Bhvr would probably never make a killer based on an actual serial killer
---
Pretty sure that's a Jake.
---
Its ok to lose with anything my dude, dont let anyone ruin your fun through mean comments
---
literally the only killer it's unacceptable to lose as(assuming youre a good killer) is nurse bc she's super strong
---
leatherface is bottom tier so don't feel bad, i wouldn't touch him with a 20 ft pole
---
Well... Losing never is something to be shamed, specially leatherface since his hability is useless in certain maps, now camping is another story
---
Lets be honest. How often do you play against Fred and how many games they run that combo?
---
Alright my guy, when i say “I finished two out of the three total gens we got done” that means Ruin was up and i 99% a Gen, popped the unsafe gen and finished the safer gen. Gens having progress on them pressures the killer and avoids 3-genning, which happened more than often enough for me today and i wanted to avoid it for *one fucking game.*
---
thanks man, hopefully its soon
---
Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
---
No. Into the ballpit of shame with you!
---
Nah, but srsly; Bubba's a mid-tier Killer at best, depending on the map.
---
Wait, won't it then be.. dropped in the user's mouth?
---
... Everyone was thinking it, but you decided you had to say it.
---
This gave me an inner anger.
---
Have you ever watched halloween? Michael was shot six times in the stomach and just got up and walked away as if it never happened. You sure that’s gonna do anything against him. And survivors are still alive when they get hit by a damn chainsaw. So why apparently should killers be automatically dead when they get a tiny stab to the back?
---
But we have daddy Myers.
---
yeah and what did you show for it?
---
3 gens lul
---
the people who play this game blow my mind
---
And then it'll be like.. really bad... taste... and it might make you gag or even swallow.
---
Or something.
---
Wait... are you supposed to be able to actually win with leatherface?
---
If the [spolier]John Wick / Marilyn Manson character [/spoiler] healed her, it would cancel the pick up animation allowing for her to escape during your hit cooldown. They played it wrong. Lucky you.
---
Made with 🅱️ematic
---
I always do them if I see them solid points and quick/easy to get
---
Nah just kill them say gg and leave.
---
Ah didn't know. Jokes on me. Guess I should go back to making my own crappy memes
---
2 full bloodwebs?
---
Relax, words dont mean shit until you let them
---
Let them boast about their ego and such, they are the one with problems not you
---
Play the game to have fun, not to follow some made up rules
---
and i get that because BHVR has gotten a lot bigger so they might have more resources to dump into a more monster like killer the only weird part is what would his m1 be
---
What is the matter with 20 september
---
You mean Urban Immersions up to the Gen *Blows it Up* Urban Immersions Away
---
you couldve just asked me to remove it, ugly
---
I see people say this a lot but I've played a whole lotta killer and you can definitely still be spotted. There are gaps in the gen's aura and you can see the player's aura shining through them. It's especially obvious at the beginning and the end of when Chili is in effect when you can see the aura fade in/out. An experienced killer will always check these and I doubt this trick will ever work.
---
Ehh, it’s been working for me so far but I’ll keep that in mind as I rank up
---
fuck that
---
You're really in a decent rank to be able to have M even chance. Any higher and you will be against killers that all definitely have good builds, any lower and you tend to get killed by bad teammates as much as the killer
---
Interestingly, the better the totem spots get, the worse haunted grounds becomes....
---
Even now i think the other totem should stay lit after the first one gets cleansed. Wouldn't be op but would maybe even make it meta and god damn if we aren't starving for fresh meta perks
---
noed doesn’t work on hatchets lol
---
Didn’t know you can’t see mending survivors, gotcha. Does it work when a survivor is healing another survivor?
---
Seems about right. Thanks
---
Yeah that’s what I was thinking, I’m probably just gonna wait for ps5 and see.
---
I know. "Surprise" NOED.
---
Yup, you can see anyone performing a healing action on themselves or another person
---
Oh yeah, had a bunch of games yesterday like that. 3 of us, all around rank 11 and 12, kept getting killers that were rank 20s for some reason.
---
Remember when they got the rights from starbreeze they also said no exclusives for only 1 system, then gave the death garden cosmetics for Pc and switch now has the trapper cosmetics. Can’t always go on what they say.
---
Ah I remember this
---
Iirc it was Christmas 2016 or 2017
---
Enslaved groovy
---
*wait that’s illegal*
---
When Laurie is home alone
---
Thanks, that helps!
---
Just keep playing it will even out. Plus you should want to play against players better than you. It’s the only way you will git gud at the game.
---
I can't recall anyone in this community calling 360s toxic
---
You as any other ochido wannabe through your actions actively make the game less enjoyable because everyone wants to be a bit toxic like that one youtuber 
---
The only good thing about you is that you are do irrelevant you will influence noone
---
Would it be 105% speed or 115% though?
---
I feel like ZA WARUDO is more an interesting killer ability, 8 seconds of time stop wooo!
---
Yeah seems about right, thanks!
---
Billy could be the killer as he sacrificed people to the mind flayer. Just a thought?
---
Dude, seriously??? **DONT FEED THE TROLLS.** A troll can live for a *week* on the amount of text you just gave it.
---
This one doesn't even sound like it's played the game before, there's no excuse.
---
Don't threaten me with a good time, daddy
---
There will always be assholes. Best you can do is not let them affect you
---
Losing with any killer is fine my guy
---
well death garden is only on pc
---
I mean...they can always change the lore. Or make it non-cannon.
---
Yup it's all over the place. I'm currently rank 7 as survivor and had a game earlier where I was paired with two rank 18s and 16...gg
---
Yea they forgot that they have BT...oh wait it was nerfed...but they still have DS...ohh...ummm MOM? No? Maybe DH? Oh its buggy as fuck I forgot. Okay but they have adrenaline (for how long?)!  
---
Survivor "second chance" perks are getting nerfed because killer mains cry about them. But insta down addons are okay, moris are okay, insta down perks are okay.... And Im a fucking killer main bruh.
---
Why would you go nurses with scratched mirror?
---
Probably not, the console version costs more than the PC version because it supposedly has all those DLC as a game of the year edition. So technically they dont get it free
---
The devs have said in the past they don’t want non-human killers so unless this is different, it’ll probably be a flayed person. I don’t think a demogorgon, although unique, would exactly fit in the world.
---
talk about Tunnel Vision
---
At this point I think a creature would be much more interesting
---
You've never noticed that? It usually flashes MUCH faster, but the game always displays a full bar for a few frames when you hit a great skillcheck. Seems to vary with latency, like it needs to verify the skillcheck with the host before displaying the increased progress. I'd guess your latency was very high for that game, or at least for that moment.
---
Did you call me ugly, ugly?
---
Huntress was a free downloadable chapter, and Bill was patched in, but his perks were always there. I think it was possibly because it was a 30$ special edition?
---
My bad, I misunderstood your point.
---
In that case yeah, I agree with you 100%
---
i am literally going to attack you now
---
Oh the hours and hours you must have spend during reset being a total ass to both your team and the killer just for a couple minutes of jukes against rank 15 killers
---
They did clarify this, they meant specifically non humanoid, aka spider legs, extra appendages, ect. The reason is because constructing a new skeleton frame is a lot of work for a new killer. Demogorgon could be done with the normal human skeleton. Billy is still more likely, but this argument against Demogorgon doesnt apply.
---
Nothing in this game is consistent any more and it's getting really fucking old lol
---
I would love to see this
---
You mean lery's, the game is actually pretty bad
---
Well first of all I hate ochido more than any other YouTuber and I wonder why you are so obsessed with me being toxic? Like what have I done that let's you think im a ochido wannabe? Just because of this thumbnail? Like I said. I use the word toxic quite often so that's why I named my montages like that.
---
aww yeah, it always surprises me how bold bald looks
---
BBQ is even questionable unless you're starving for points
---
Depending on addons too.
---
I'm totally fine with that if wasn't for the fact instead of leaving they stick around the hook giving free kills.
---
You know, you can look for noed and try to borrow time or leave.. sadly they choose the third option, die
---
But they put 💀🐁. The killer is DeadMau5
---
idk they kinda do already get punished by not receiving bloodpoints, but I don't think it's enough. I agree they should definitely have some sort of system for leavers. I've heard ideas tossed around here like: giving the remaining players some sort of boost/incentive. and that would actually make leaving more of an issue than it already is, cuz ppl would abuse that system. it sucks and something should be done, but it's not a high priority for the devs unfortunately.  
---
it's tricky when you really get into this, you have to take into account that there are bugs, freezes, internet outages, emergencies, etc., that can make someone leave the game unintentionally. and in the same boat, there are the tilted players that leave/DC. being able to tell the difference is pretty tough if you're not in the match, and all you can do is report. tbh I don't really expect the devs to implement anything for it, but whatever it is, the goal would be to not punish as many innocent players.  
---
on the subject of punishment, too harsh of one will lead to a loss in player retention. meaning ppl will just go play another game, potentially spend money on something else, and maybe come back later. if you were a dev and this were your game, that's one of the very last things you would want happening. you want ppl playing and spending money on your game, so they have to be very careful if they ever introduced a system like this. 
---
simple solution: like yours but much shorter,  something like 5/10/15/30/45/60 mins, as to not have a negative effect on people with legitimate reasons for a DC. so if you're a toxic leaver, you can always buy another copy of the game to play on another account if you wanna get around it.
---
Meanwhile in a parallel universe.
---
I don't like sprint burst because you generally are left walking around to save it which sucks. Dead hard or balanced landing are much more useful in my opinion
---
Stolen comment 😍
---
If they time it just right, or have head on they can get away
---
african queen sounds like a great skin concept tho, to bad the concept competition has ended already lmao
---
This entire sub must be purged
---
Yeah, ok. But still.
---
Best SFM work so far there.
---
So is it a horror scary survival game or simulation game?
---
Whatever is the "best" of anything eventually comes down to personal preference. In contrast to other replies here, I find Balanced Landing too unreliable and extremely obvious when it's about to be used, Dead Hard is affected by lag or susceptible to mis-timing, I like more interaction with perks than merely once per match like with Adrenaline, Head On just sucks to me, and Sprint Burst forces you to walk around the entire match or risk not having it when the killer comes. 
---
That leaves Lithe for me. It gives no indication it's about to be procced, it goes whenever you're looping normally so you don't have to go out of your way to proc it like with Balanced Landing, and it allows you to run around normally without risking losing it. It all comes down to personal preference.
---
No, because you are an attention whore
---
You could have used any other description like skillful or epic but you have chosen to write "toxic" because you hope for someone to watch your mediocre video
---
Either identify with being toxic or dont use it at all because right now you are using this Word just for attention, you are no different then a middle aged white girl using the Word suicide or a feminist screaming rape
---
Jeff the real clown here just killed nea XD
---
What legion addons cause that? I dont play against him much.
---
Lol, poor bubba ;(
---
Oh then it is still the 105% speed. Myers had a very small terror radius so the chainsaw was used for pretty much every down, since the lunge is so small in tier 1
---
He would insert his BIG knife it SO DEEP into you
---
Did I just pallet drop and T-Bag the Killer that is your Emotion State?
---
Fagette
---
No, it's the fabled mexican chest standoff.
---
Michael just doesn’t give a shit
---
Hey, (gestures) It's free BP.
---
"IVE GOT THE POWER OF GOD AND ANIME ON MY SIDE"
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Just because a word has lost its meaning for you or you use it not in a way you should doesnt mean others wont read it the proper way
---
A group of friends can call themselves cunts but wont do it to others 
---
You on the other hand do just that, and yes again you use it just for attention due to how popular this Word is in this subbreddit
---
You wont name a league of legends or dota juke montage just by the name toxic hence its why you are just an attention whore by doing it here
---
And not a respectable one either, since you can't even deal with it and admit it
---
Noed is already a weak perk as it is. It’s just an annoying mechanic. That idea would make it as bad as monstrous shrine.
---
"OMG U DIDN'T GIV 1 HATCH?!"
---
Good, I like uniting people by being pissed over little details
---
It's possible but \*highly\* unlikely seeing as when Netflix announced it was crossing over with multiple games, Fortnite and Roblox were included and both have (or are getting, not sure, don't play either) Stranger Things content. So i'd say it's a safe bet just from this that DbD would be getting ST content too.
---
That sounds like a good idea, to make it more of a stalling perk instead of just a snowball perk. As long as the second wouldn’t give exposed..
---
Then again it would only discourage survivors from cleansing totems, which sucks for both sides. Not only is NOED up more often, but survivors are encouraged even further to only do gens
---
I think it would be better if NOED wasn’t the only reason to do dull totems (Bar the pitiful bloodpoint gain from cleansing dull totems).
---
Is.........is that dude doing pull ups in the back?
---
ayyy thanks!
---
Sorry if I sounded accusatory, a *whole* lotta people on this game derank habitually and it's driving away all the new players. Ultimately, it's the devs fault for not having better systems in place, but that's a tangent for another time. Good for you for sticking with it.
---
wait what
---
No it’s the version of the hook
---
I kind of want to pull a role reversal on April Fool's sometime, so baby Dwight's can stomp the ever living shit out of the Trapper
---
It's nobody's fault but your isp. I had the same problem since I live in a island too but I won't go on Reddit saying I'm entitled to play this online game making everyone around me have a worse experience because my internet sucks. I call my isp and figure it out my dude
---
You sound so entitled when 1 you bought the game knowing was online only and 2 you knew your connection situation.
---
Just by these 2 factors you know what you would've got. When my internet was shit and for 2 years had constant dc and sometimes weeks without internet you know what I did?
---
Not played online games. Even if I paid for those! It didn't matter, I preferred play offline ones (best ones) instead of ruining other people experience and get annoyed by my shitty connection. So my dude, to make it even more clear, you're not entitled to play online if your internet suck just because you paid for it! Take action against your ISP instead of spreading entitlement on Reddit 
---
Thanks
---
Lightweight is not worth it. Sprint burst won’t let you avoid detection, just increase the gap between you and he killer.
---
Ultimately, you don’t want to avoid detection. As a solo player it may seem great, but if you want to have the best results in your matches you should play as a team; that means taking turns getting chased. If you avoid the killer the whole game your teammates are going to get chased more and die earlier. Instead, equally divide up the chase among teammates.
---
To answer your question though, urban evasion is the best way. Spine chill has a pretty long distance so even without urban you should be able to get away from the gen in time unless it’s somebody like nurse, billy, etc.
---
you did p3 claudette in her natural habit 😂
---
I honestly don't think it would be op even if the other gave exposed too.
---
This happened to me yesterday on The Game! 
---
First time playing The Plague and it’s crunch time (eg, gens are done) and I hit her before she can get the 100% on the door. She opens it, proceeded to t-bag and I hit her anyway for points not expecting the Nea to do what the Jeff did in this game and pretty much blocked the Feng from leaving! 
---
I don’t normally hit people on hooks but by the entity I admit to doing it on her :)
---
imagine wasting perk slots on tracking perks when you literally have permanent aura reading with scratched mirror.
---
Dude I promoted my videos here the first time and didn't even think about promoting it on reddit when I named it toxic half a year ago.
---
And idc how people see the word toxic. I see it how I see it and when I want to use it.. I use it. So don't judge me if you don't even know me or my playstyle. 
---
I say it again if you want to. Im a fair team player and don't insult people or something like that ok? It's a simple juke Montag not more
---
Don't camp, don't tunnel, just outplay them and still get abuse at the end. I love it.
---
*A heavily salted pudding*
---
You would get up votes if you didnt call bill marilyn manson lol
---
But wait
---
They literally nerfed instadown addons before.... Like when they hit iridesent head hard. from 3 to 1 hatchet default. but lets only remember surv nerfs xd
---
It‘s the opposite for me. I enjoy playing other games when I played dbd before.
---
Dead By Daylight is Horror Scary Game

Been like this for release day, its gonna be worse when the next chapter comes out, especially if its  stranger things
---

You can buy the Survivor Rulebook for only 39.99$! It's an heavy reading but quite fun. It's about 890 pages but every month you can have for free the newest update if you subscribe to "KillersAreOp" magazine, it's special offer for just an extra 2$ per month!
---
total shock fills your body
---
Can confirm. Only EGC kills I got were a 3 man wipe because they would not give up on the hooked survivor even when I was circling them (because I had 1 survivor on each side of me waiting for them to move. Frak no I'm not gonna leave the hook when they're doing that). They all got popped by the Entity maybe 5 feet from the exit gate.
---
I hit survivors on hooks only In cases when they were teabagging. As a survivor I never teabag
---
Talk about flexing on the enemy.
---
No, no you don’t. Not on PS4
---
Ah damn, fair enough.
---
🅱️ruh
---
Honestly only reason my friends and I want to is just because it gets boring playing at red ranks
---
Stealth: exist
---
It might be weird but if you use stuff like iron will and dance with me you can lose the killer! Shocking!!
---
This is how playing Myers with Infinite Tier 3 + Tombstone feels like
---
Yes, yes you do. I play on ps4.
---
Sorry didn’t know
---
You think this is bad? Wait until you see Nuclear Throne source code.
---
This is cursed
---
Ok this has gone too far with advertising your subreddit. You don't need to put watermarks all over the image so it's almost illegible.
---
Even better, when you were never touched but get mori’d at the exit gate my a Michael
---
The best part is when rank 20s come and say "dO BonEs1!1!1!"
---
"Back to the pit ☠"
---
I love looping L and T walls so when a killer has bamboozle I just do a nice ghostface *sigh*
---
That's me with my recovery build. (Tenacity, Unbreakable, Flip-flop, and 1 random perk) The build is very situational and it works once in a blue moon. Pretty satisfying when it does work though.
---
Oh no it's you again
---
concept: bites the dust is actually also an add-on or possibly a perk where if someone dies while a gate is open, the gate re-closes and all survivors in the gate area are placed back into the trial area
---
Cough cough, there's just a solution.. gitgud!
---
I know, shocking. I sucked too at first, big surprise huh? Guess what I did, watched a lot of videos and played more. Watching what people did and doing the same when I played the opposite side!
---
I think you don't expect to be a god in a fighting game immediately, same thing in a shooter or whatever. Just practice practice and practice
---
Bahahaha. This is fuckin' hilarious.
---
Wrong. You don’t get 5k. Sorry, it doesn’t happen.
---
In a game yesterday this David and I 3-genned ourselves so I found the hatch and led him to it then found the killer and had him kill me. That David messaged me saying how he really appreciated it and how he would tell my family of my bravery lol. Another was when I was playing Wraith and had a particularly bad game (got gen rushed and only sacrificed one). One of the survivors messaged me with a gg and proceeded to give me some tips for what I did wrong that match which helped me a lot. So yeah. Faith in the dbd community restored a bit yesterday haha
---
I never win with LF and I hover rank 5 hard. literally don’t sweat it he’s goofy and that’s how you should play him, you’ll have try hards slam your ass but then you’ll have a lot who will realize it’s okay to play casually against a weak boy. I wouldn’t run meta perks on him besides BBQ. No ruin, no noed, nothing like that, just good old fashion meme builds
---
Yeah the Jeff could have easily just healed when the clown tried to pick her up
---
You hit players at the exit gate for free points and the fact that it forces them to leave lowering the chance of a rescue if you manage to get someone before they get to the gate
---
One word... Karma
---
In the world there were assholes, there are assholes, and there Will BE assholes. Just relax and dont pay attention to those cunts
---
I wish something like this would happen.

Stop, I can only get so erect
---
Christmas 2016
---
I enjoy sorting by new and telling players that they shouldnt care about salty killers or survivors, they should enjoy their game and have fun with it
---
!remindme 3 days
---
I always do em, but I only play survivor as a 2 man swf with a buddy and we usually pack together and hit gens and take turns doing nearby totems
---
Can I ask when this originated from? Was it a bug or some event?
---
i could never forget those eyes eyes eyes
---
They talked about this a while back, and mentioned it'd be too cost effective to do. While it'd be neat, I get the logic as they'd have to update every single piece of cosmetic already in the game to have the blood added which'd take a decent amount of time.
---
He's a sleeper agent
---
6 Times? Maxing 1 character is 14.7 mil BP from 0
---
There's another one called Dead Before Daylight.
---
That would be great, but how? Most of the dc's I see are first time downed, first time hooked, or everyone is about to escape
---
Sole Survivor just needs a simple change.  Work like reverse thanatophobia.  For every injured, hooked, dying, or dead survivor, your action speeds increase by 3/4/5%.
---
This. I don't care if it's my first hook (usually), if noed is active just leave or try to find it. But why are they so insistent on dying?
---
I am a masochist to the degrees of occasionally wanting to get stabbed, so...*daddy~*
---
Speaking from my experience if you wait like 5 minutes or so you'll find a match. It takes a long time but ull find games
---
Im so proud of this community
---
Literally though, I just bought the game with the saw DLC late May, I had a couple survivor matches and wanted to try the pig, now mind you I’d never played before in my life and I got teamed up against a 4 SWF with utility flashlights, they actually chased me around the map and the after game wasn’t too fun with their comments either.
---
People would just suicide on hook, go AFK, or pull their plug instead.
---
You became the shadows. It’s Claudette’s special ability.
---
It depends, if the killer leaves the game from the pause menu, you should get points, but if they close the application/turn off their console, then you won’t get any points
---
Cause it has 269 up doots
---
You should have seen a Nurse do it. Constant blink scream while stuck in her blink animation. Nothing but a thin white screaming line if death that you could hear but not see coming. Myers had nothing on her.
---
I don't think they will make them free on PC and will likely stay free for console players only.
---
The punisher is David change my mind
---
Ohhh; its a chainsaw....
---
I thought it was an Uzi he was holding weird
---
Huh ok
---
That's just the entity trying to keep you on your toes.
---
Same issue, waiting for a long time.
---
Damn ok
---
My experience on Xbox is with lots of people quitting during the loading, after an early down, first time on the hook, last time on the hook, or when the killer sees everyone is about to escape.  Personally, I'd rather lose those people and face a longer queue than have a ruined match
---
As long it fits I'm fine with it but not being a huge fan of stranger things I don't care. I care more about the perks and that the killer won't feel off in this setting.
---
If it's something like hag it's fine but if it's not shaped like an humanoid (four legs/spider like/ Yokai like) would be kinda bad. Even if I love many kind of monsters/legends in mythology I think it's not fitting for DbD
---
Maybe I'd love a spider woman as a guilty pleasure like jurai gumo but I realize it won't fit either..
---
Thank god you stopped, you were embarrassing yourself.
---
It is toxic, but among all the salt you also get some nice people. In the videos they show the toxicity only because it's entertaining.
---
Unfortunately, yes it is
---
They will abuse everything they see in video's to fuck you over
---
But, the game for its price is great, entertaining and has constant updates
---
Besides, its really fun and rewards skillful plays
---
Up to you
---
Im a 666 upvote, Jesus protect me
---
This is why i hate decisive strike. Gives you a free escape at the end of the game.
---
If I was the Jeff I would've sandbagged that Nea even more than he already did.
---
Just gotta steal his shirt
---
That’s what I was thinking
---
Simple, killer opens door and dosen't hit anyone till in the gates
---
That would be great, but how? Most of the dc's I see are while the match is loading, first time downed, first time hooked, last time hooked, or everyone is about to escape
---
Broken by daylight is what I call it
---
I don't know lol, first one that popped into my mind
---
I did...
---
Bee
---
AHHHHHUUUUUUHHHHHHHHH
---
Unless the killer hard closes the game, you get points. Don't tell me I'm wrong.
---
Please sacrifice me daddy
---
Bug that allowed you to equip the wrong powers on killers
---
only time me and a friend ever teabagged was against a Ghostface.  He was facecamping my noob friend, tunneling, etc. and when we got the exits opened, I dropped my finest teabag, twirled around, and left.
---
I see it
---
All LF has to do is bump into the locker and cause a tantrum...
---
Because I rely on sounds and it shuts you up faster.
---
Sounds too much like old legion. Neat idea tho!
---
I’m having this issue as a survivor.  Takes forever to find a game and then when everyone is ready the game crashes during or after the loading screen and kicks me back to menu.  Pretty annoying.
---
New player here, how does noed cause insta death on the first hook? The wiki just says it gives movement speed and applies exposed. Does it have something to do with the exposed effect?
---
Well I leave this conversation now. You have your opinion, I have mine. We good.
---
Wish you a good day, enjoy whatever you are doing today and thanks for the discussion.
---
Cool bait, don’t care
---
Don't tunnel and you won't need to hate it, simple
---
I suffer from DbD withdrawal and it sucks.  I need my daily fix so I downloaded Identity V and drop my finest tbags but my withdrawal cannot be cured.
---
I've never heard anyone say ranks 15-20 are best. I have heard people say ranks 7-12 are best since best que times, more competent survivors, and less salt
---
Imagine complaining about post nerf DS. Could have just let her sit there and defended the slug, fam. OP chose to take a DS
---
I kind of want to see Myers with Spirit's or Ghostface animations. Imagine seeing Myers crouching on the grass stalking your booty
---
There are no infinite loading screens anymore, it just takes a bit for the game to recognize that someone dc’d, which sucks, but at least you don’t have to bust out the task manager every time someone dodges a lobby.
---
Isn't this the logo for leaksbydaylight?
---
Bill lmfao
---
Shooould be-  it’d be pretty shady if not. Check the PS store dlc for the chapter.
---
Nice bait, don’t care
---
Yup full of hold w gamers that just drop pallets even when you are nowhere near lol. Boring indeed.
---
The only reason I hit on hook is because it cancels the scream, and some days I just can't stand Laurie's voice
---
1 survivor leaving ruins the game for 4 people too. It tremendously reduces the other 3 survivor’s chances of surviving, and it also tremendously reduces the killer’s blood point gain because it’s 1 less person to chase, 1 less person to unhook, 1 less person who can unhook (helping the killer get more chases, hits, and hooks).
---
I’m a simple man, I see Jak 3, I upvote
---
2 did, sadly one was caught after and facecamped to death just like I was
---
Then just don’t queue for another game until you chill out? Lmfao
---
I swear they better not be playing game.
---
OUTPLAYED
---
That’s a pretty good idea! I imagine the killer wouldn’t be too happy about getting stunned with a toolbox.
---
Be the change you want to see
---
Yeah when I get off work I'm definitely checking that haha I need that chapter
---
I knew hopping them too many times would proc the block but I thought it was random because I went against a lot of bamboozle before I started reading perks in post game
---
5 million x 20 is 100 million USD. As a Team with 30 people and a pay of avg. 85k a year that is 2.5 mil a year. Thats already 10 mil of just salary over the years. 
---
Then add an additional couple of million for the building, Equipment, servers.
---
Then there is Marketing expenses and taxes. They make a lot of money but they Are not rich.
---
Some games take 100 million to make.
---
They also said no clown and nor religious killers, look where we are now.
---
I usually run by myself and do pretty good with this build:
---
Lithe - to get away as quick as possible from the killer
---
Spine Chill - Super help against killers with no terror radius and helps you get away extra early from the killer so you don't need to run
---
Urban Evasion - So so good to help if you need to stay out of sight and get away from the killer. Good for juking and with spine Chill get away from the area in a stealthy fasion
---
As for my forth I cycle out for fun:
---
Deja Vu - Helps immensely to spread the generators from the killer and also you can see the generator locations on all maps (LERY'S) 
---
Self Care - Self explanatory
---
Detectives Hunch - great for those d bag killers who run NOED because you can destroy all the totems with this one
---
Bond - Helps to see team mates in the near vicinity and also if one is getting chased and decides to run your way with the killer got on their trail
---
Deliverance - Great for if you get hooked and nobody is coming to help you or if you just wanna control when you get off the hook rather than a rando pulling you off in front of a tunneling killer
---
When you dont get spotted the whole game but Michael wants to show you why hes been saving his Tier 3.
---
Use more tactics, different ones. Adapt, play Survivor and copy other killers mind games, new perks, more add ons (which I never use cuz I'm dumb) and try different killers.
---
Fun is subjective so the thing I listed are useful if you have fun learning and getting better and fk them (either side).
---
If you're on console try to be a good nurse, that would be frustrating unless you just care how precise you get after every game (that you lose while learning) or try to be a jumpscare boy with Myers or ghostface if you have them, Pig might work too.
---
Try to make sick turns with Billy with the right addons etc, just find something you enjoy and do it. For me for example is mind game, play chess with the hag using her traps or zooming with spirit with the fast shoes addons (idk addons names, I barely use them. I enjoy learning with ""handicaps"", I love too much collect things to waste them..)
---
Find a way to make it fun and make the best out of it. Mess up a little and be efficient doing so!
---
It’s just like the real world man, some people are shitty some are nice and some are neutral. Just try not to let the shitty people get you down or turn you like them aha.
---
At this point we don't even know if it's going to be a full chapter. It could only be a survivor for all we know. As much as i'm praying it's a full on Chapter i'm not gonna get my hopes up.
---
Just imagine Steve as the survivor, Demigorgon as a killer and the new map the mall from Season 2. Now that would be so amazing.
---
I’m sorry little one. This is cringe but take an upvote regardless
---
I only realized when I watched his first stream he said something about signing it for the viewers
---
The second perk is a good alternative to we are gonna live forever, and i like it, the third perk tho is op as shit
---
Oh yes daddy hurt me more XD
---
OP’s lack of self-awareness is astonishing lol
---
look in the window
---
Imagine they reveal something totally different, ptb comes around, and it was all a troll and it actually was stranger things
---
I discovered this yesterday!
---
She left spiritually not physically :)
---
But it doesnt make it impossible
---
I was expecting wacky unreasonable perks but these are underpowered and would fit right into the game, good work
---
Thank
---
That's my last trophy also for the past 5 months. Pissed me off when people get it as killer. I didn't and all 4 escaped twice on me.
---
things do change
---
Made with mematic
---
You're an idiot if you insult on PSN. I got banned for sending the doctor "gitgud" meme to people who insulted me and got banned. If they are fscecamping most probably you're between rank 20-10. Plus it's not very effective since if you did enough you will still pip/black pip while they will derank.
---
It don't need a "rework", they tried to deal with it for years now, if somebody wanna lose (camp) they will either way
---
They will, i dont know if you follow the news but there will be a big updait comming.
---
I dont know if it wil be at the next season or a big patch, but they are working on it
---
Works for the Island of USA. In europe youre fucked. People will Talk in french, Russian, Italian, Swedish, Danish and whatever language.
---
No thank you.
---
How about you take care of that double standard?
---
Michael Myers have had enough
---
There are plenty of ways to make him not look totally normal and they could easily give him a blunt weapon amd have it work fine. If he had black veins all over like he did later in the series that would work, he could be all bloodied and burned from the sun etc.. There's so many ways to make it work, also keep in mind the entity sometimes takes in the killer's body with their death injuries included too, that can also factor in
---
We already know that there's a killer in all of the year 4 chapters.
---
Yes! I love setting traps on one side of a pallet or windows
---
As a survivor main, this actually irritates me. Just do your objective and gtfo....
---
embarrassing for what? you are the person who doesnt understand a dc-griefing report. he even showed dev statements of it being reportable, maybe y'all should learn how to read and use google yourself for 5 seconds, fuckin hell you're childish
---
If they leave at the beginning of the game and you’re not in a 3 stack SWF? Yeah, it actually does. Once that DC happens, everyone goes Ultra Immersed and the game gets fucked. Not sure why you’re defending this when it’s only got negative outcomes  lmao
---
cursed
---
Shit post tag does exist
---
I don’t understand why people would want easy games. Don’t you want to challenge yourself to the better at the game? There’s no point other than to bully new players
---
Lol... I see totems getting cleansed in most matches....
---
Killer stops moving for 10 seconds.
---
Nice idea, but the ´THE\` is hard to see due to it being on a white background.
---
DON'T LOOK AT THE COMMENTS!
---
lmao at these mental gymnastics
---
Anything you do for extended amounts of time loses its scariness. Imagine playing layers of fear for the 16th time. You wont be scared
---
Sauce?
---
Not that I don't believe you, I'd just like to see it
---
Nope. Frustrating I did the most for the game and didn’t get to escape
---
If it was only a one use perk  it wouldn’t be that bad.
---
Very nice artwork!
---
Lol let's ignore the last part:
---
"We typically include DCs because people typically disconnect when they're losing. If you exclude DCs, you're excluding the matches where someone is doing so poorly that they rage quit. Removing any data at all will always skew things."
---
Which is a feels argument since people dc even for the most little thing ever (like being found first) so yeah, these stats are bs
---
Look 4 year roadmap m8. 13 chapter is have killer
---
You get instant downed, hooked, and left to die on the hook.
---
Orgazmo as survivor, neutered man as killer. Better yet, Dave the lighting guy as survivor.
---
Can't blame people for deciding to not put the time into a game with a fucking massive learning curve and grind when their first match is full of people they have no chance against and get abused for it
---
https://deadbydaylight.com/en/roadmap
---
Anybody gonna mention if they found the golden toolbox?
---
No, people overstate it
---
It is, you will see them and notice them.
---
If they are really mad sometimes they go to your steam to leave a message abaut how bad you are, but if you are able to see "fun" in it, and just waist there time and talk to the nice side of the survivors you wont regret buying the game.
---
Im a killer main, and i have respect to all tge good, new killers who do all this, and i hope you will try it!
---
Thank you
---
They are running a perk that lets the killer know where they are at all times. Any complaints of tunneling become moot.
---
Sprint Burst is okay but it leaves you in a bind where you need to be aware of it and can’t run everywhere so I don’t like it. 
---
Lithe is better in my opinion. However, if you want to use it, you’ll want to do it while you already have a decent lead since window hitboxes are pretty killer-favored. 
---
Dead Hard is alright, but most decent killers will anticipate it and just avoid lunging. Still, I probably prefer it over Lithe. 
---
Balanced Landing is by far my favorite. Yes, you can only use it at certain areas but I feel like it gives you the most control over your exhaustion, and also has the secondary effect of reduced stagger, making 2F loops (Huntress House, Ormond lodge, church, etc) a huge advantage. I also like it because many of the central gens which you want to knock out ASAP are near 2F points. I often run BL and go to the center gen right away since I can usually work on it pretty safely near a 2F drop. Also, killers frequently whiff on swings while dropping giving you that extra lead. Even when a killer realizes I have BL, I can often “fake it” by going to a drop point even if I’m exhausted. The killer will pretty often try to wait below me, giving me time to self-heal or regain BL back. It’s not uncommon for them to straight up leave me either. I’ve personally have had the most success with Balanced Landing of all the Exhaustion Perks, easily. 
---
Head On is hilarious... if you get the rare occasion it works. I still think they need to change it so teammates see your aura in a locker if you have it, but that’s just my opinion. 
---
I suppose I should include Adrenaline too? It’s a great perk. Sometimes, you won’t get use out of it but it is great at saving you time healing when you’re on that final gen. Running 2 Exhaustion Perks is rarely a good idea but Adrenaline is an exception to that, and I often run it with Balanced Landing with moderate success.
---
Wdym, it's literally what she said a number of times. 
---
I get that reddit doesn't like too many streamers but assuming someone's reasoning just because you don't like them is pretty weird.
---
The Item is consumed, so imagine a full swf with extra chest offerings, yeeting the killer with quaranteed medkits from Quentin perk
---
They're hanged and unable to come down because they're short? That's so cruel, i would rather get hooked.
---
You're not wrong. I mean  sometimes totems are next to gens, knock out a totem first then do the gen. Knock a totem out if you see o e on your way to a gen.I always try to get all the totems JUST in case they have noed.
---
The roadmap already said we will be getting a killer. They could be adding two survivors to make up for Ghostface?
---
ranks 7-12 really are the best place to be
---
Lol no, I was playing on and off, and players were first hook deathing the life out of me.  Gotta love seeing a killer hook someone, so I start moving only to see them give it two attempts, then 0 struggle, dying when I'm 10 feet away.  Lather, rinse, repeat and you end up with pouty Aids
---
Listen man, enjoyable or no, Ruin is literally a meta perk. Same with BBQ. Noed is a crutch perk by definition.
---
They would be OP
---
Back off might become a meta perk imo
---
Myers: killed all 4
---
eNtItY: dIsPlEaSeD
---
When this happened, the nurse would instead go invisible while chain sawing and the chainsaw was completely silent . So youd just fall down in one hit and be like wtf ?
---
If they added a mechanic where the survivors could trap and kill the killers it would be pretty cool.
---
Same it’s was really fun the one i liked the least was jak 11
---
there are no dedicated servers yet. when the match ends or the killer leaves the game, the killer's client gives everyone their points
---
if the killer closes the game/whatever they are playing on/unplugs their internet connection there's no way for the game to give you your points
---
I've had it since release, and it's ridiculous how many people I've seen. It happens in so many other games as well
---
For me it was Meyers, I love playing on lampkin lane and playing as Meyers in that map is just a treat.

It's pretty simple, just hook up your computer to your Xbox. I used to know someone who did it for all of his other games, you can imagine why I'm not friends with him anymore
---
Is it worth me holding out for Ruin or c&amp;b here or quicker to grind hag and LF?
---
Can't wait to get teabagged and pallet stunned 300 times and then fucking sacrificed to the entity at the end
---
Problem is the killers are thicc boys so looping a Dwight would be impossible
---
Btw if this happens neither exit gate works i tried before
---
Agreed
---
It's not impossible. I've seen people do it, I used to be friends with someone who frequently hacked. Xboxes files aren't necessarily the greatest, and there's programs that can bypass them so that they can't tell.
---
I don’t think that’s necessary. The perk doesn’t state it, but I think a way to balance it would require making it a high risk high reward perk. Hitting the killer with the toolbox (like in the characters description) would require them to be incredibly close to the killer, risking them getting injured or down. I think that would make it perfectly fine, even if they were carrying someone.
---
They should just let this glitch stay in kill your friends
---
This wasnt even his worst.  Imagine Michael Myers using a chainsaw , but you would only see his levitating head floating around chain sawing people.  People could switch out killers cosmetics with others , and obviously it would render as nothing since they didn't have a model for that killer to wear that cosmetic.  And since Michael's body was everything but his mask , it would render Michael as a floating head with an invisible chainsaw charging around the map.
---
You say that a survivor perk which increases action speed for every dead survivor is "punishing the killer for doing their job", but you aren't complaining about NOED or fire up. By your logic, they're punishing the survivors for doing their job. (I don't actually think this. I think that NOED and fire up are comeback perks, to allow the killer a fighting chance)
---
Ah so he wasn't halfway across the map so that means he was camping.
---
but remember to not trap the item directly
---
put one really close tho
---
the first one is op af
---
How do you get DS'd without tunneling? DS only works 60 seconds after un-hook, obviously you use it when you get tunneled smh
---
&gt;She can say what she wants, doesn't mean she's telling the truth. You don't need to go all the way to grey ranks to find a game
---
People were complaining about deranking before, I guess any way to go about the problem will have a negative reception. She got past those ranks almost instantly and after the first stream she was already playing in purple and red ranks, so in the end it didn't end up doing much.
---
Also nowhere did I state that "I think that her content needs her destroying people with less than 10 hours played", so you're kinda putting words into my mouth there.
---
&gt;Try to be a little bit respectful of the fact that she's going against literal noobs? People who may be playing their first or 2nd game of DbD? Is it so hard not to be a toxic shit and treat the other players of this game like bots that exist only for her content creation?
---
She's not talking about it to them, she's talking to her own chat. It's a common situation in basically any stream? Unless the player she's going against goes off about the match in the post game chat, you won't see her saying much to them .
---
If you really think her banter is toxic then I don't really think you've heard some actually messed up people commenting gameplay. Nobody gets hurt for getting called a dumbass or a bitch without ever even having to hear any of it.
---
&gt;No duh, but if I don't watch her stream I get attack by you people for not knowing what I talk about since I "don't watch her stream". So please tell me, where is the line for how much I have to watch Jendenise stomp noobies and 'wasting my time watching content that isn't for me?"
---
If you don't like the streamer why do you feel the need to join conversations about them? Clearly you are more interested than you're making it out to be. Tons of people claim to dislike her yet still sit in streams, not really sure for what reason. 
---
I for example dislike Tyler1, but you don't see me going around to T1 oriented discussions and talking about the guy, I just don't care about him. I got my impression of him, didn't like it, so I didn't feel the need to stick around to watch more of him.
---
I would say it was glitches if it weren't for the fact that I've seen the same kind of thing happening on PC as well, and those people would get immediately banned for hacking. Plus, I've only had a couple games we're out of nowhere my balanced landing is triggering every single time my exhaustion goes away, and each time it's accompanied by people who are able to walk through walls, and do all the aforementioned things :/
---
 as for the lag thing, I experience lag once in a blue moon. Of course, I can't say nah I only experienced it once in awhile, I've had my fair share killers that are really laggy, but even then I only get a couple of spikes here and there in the game, and it doesn't trigger any of the things mentioned above
---
I have the opposite feeling. Can't play dbd at all even though I rarely get less than 3K without having to try hard on nurse or spirit or billy. For like a year out of hundreds of matches I never experienced true competition. Every game is a throwaway: either survivors can't stand any chance or same happens with me. My favourite killer (ghostface) is forgotten by devs, same for pig. I'm done with this game and just play it once a week or fortnight. Too bad

Can we get a subreddit just dedicated to "normal" pictures of Myers like this one
---
Stun on demand was included in the game already and it had to be nerfed
---
A yellow medkit with nothing else raising speed takes 14 seconds for one health state.
---
Using level 3 botony that increases it 33%.
---
1/3 of 14 is a little over 4 and a half.
---
Meaning that leather face got to basement again before 4 seconds passed. He was just outside of shack if not inside of it. CAMPING.
---
the difference is that freddy was human. and what do you mean "at that point" they've done all this with other killers. every one has death injuries, or some fucked up element from when they were alive. They all looked like normal humans at one point, so saying that billy can't work because at certain points in the series he looked like a normal human doesn't really work
---
If you were then I apologise but it was my first time testing this build and I wanted to see how truly effective it was-
---
It was on Father Campbell's Chapel and after I killed Kate along with two other survivors, an Ace got hatch and survived the endurance test
---
First piece of advice REPAIR THE GENS DUDE.  Literally what you described is someone not participating in the game as a teamate at all.  I get that you just started playing so please understand that the playstyle you just described will infuriate your teamates if you aren't playing in a swf group with your friends because you're literally contributing nothing to the game.  This isn't a stealth game by the way it's actually vital to learn how to run a killer for when you rank up.  But starting out I'd focus on just repairing as much of the gens as you can and making smart unhook saves for your teamates.  Once you get skill checks and safe unhooks down then I'd learn how to loop got chases.
---
Nancy would be lit. Hopefully we don't get some Barb bullshit.
---
Bring it back! I want to try legion myers and spirit myers!
---
You gotta learn though mate, that some people hold grudges against others in this game. Legit, I have a lot of people who hate me on PS4 because I play high rank killer and end up killing them. So when I play rank 1/2 survivor, I see them as killer and they end up camping me, tunneling me, or trying to Mori me and me only. I have so many friends who can prove this too, i have been in so many matches with them where the killer never goes after anyone else but me, even at the start of the match. That's why I dodge some people as killer or survivor. 
---
Just remember that people do hold grudges and it is really irritating that you yourself can't play the game all because you killed a guy in one of your earlier killer games who hates your guts and only wants you dead no matter what. I have multiple people who act that way towards me in red ranks as survivor.
---
As killer, i have people dodge me because they hate that I am not one to be messed with. So when someone leaves, I usually leave, because it can bug the lobby on PS4 and not allow anyone to join for upwards toward an hour. I had a lobby that someone left the other day and I sat there for almost an hour playing on my phone and no one came. So thats why i do it, and probably why others do as well.
---
I hatch camped at the end of the game because my team sucked.
---
Level reset! Time to noob hunt
---
You specifically t-bagged the Killer to get their attention and then can't understand why they would be mad about it?
---
Congratulations, you distracted the Killer by having them focus on you. That's exactly what you set out to do, isn't it?
---
Daddy Myers is my deity.
---
Should of been cleansing totems uwu
---
Screw it! No one tries to understand.
---
Let’s noone mention Identity 9
---
Alright whatever lol it’s just a fan idea no fun allowed
---
There's people that throw games just so they can stay at low ranks so they get easy games. Hence my "smurfing" comment.
---
It'll probably be starcourt mall, the upside down will probably have something to do with the killers power
---
I really really really don't mean to be that guy but I have to say it is *you're.
---
Killer cancels the survivors jump animation from what i've seen
---
Killer will cancel out the survivor almost everytime
---
we already have clown dude
---
Potentially? I think OP meant it more as a straight threat of murder and mutilation, and not some slang.
---
I would love to beat their ass with a toolbox tbh.
---
It's not exactly that, but if we get the not so subtly teased stranger things chapter I could totally see us getting a mall
---
Telling by Jane's "grunts", it sounds like she's auditioning for porn
---
i just had that happen today to me as well
---
Happened to me yesterday, he closed the hatch while I was mid animation.
---
He let me escape, tho, it was a good game
---
NOED procs when the last gen is done, not when the exit gates are opened though.
---
no, sorry, unrealistic, she isnt t-bagging
---
15-20 is too easy
---
5-1 is too tryhard and toxic
---
To me ranks 5-13ish are the sweet spot, where you can get a bigger variety. Also, killer que times are dogshit at anything below 8ish usually, so there's that
---
True horror
---
That Steve photoshop is the definition of shit post, nice job!
---
You get the same amount of bloodpoints in that situation minus the juvenile teabags too.
---
The flip side of this is when I, a level 10 Freddy with only 3 perks, laugh as a bunch of rank reset survivors with full purple perks 3 gen themselves, and have the last surviving team member send me a hate message because I slammed the hatch shut in his face. 
---
Good times.
---
There’s nothing to try to understand. You BM’d a killer and you were punished for it. You’re the one that doesn’t understand.
---
When you design a new perk you have to consider the worst way it could be abused and then realise everyone will abuse it that way 
---
Just because you dont like my opinion doesnt mean you have to ridicule me
---
Are you sure you don't have to grab/pick them up while they are in the trap?

Hey man, don't wanna sound like an idiot and I hope you don't take this in a bad way, but even if you were joking with your friends, when you use the word gay to mean something is unpleasant or stupid, it can be hurtful to some people. 
---
I'm not say you should change the way you speak, but maybe give it a thought if you feel like it.
---
P.S.: that bug is annoying as hell, congrats on getting hatch before ECG timer was over ;)
---
Is it good?
---
I like the idea of the power, but it kinda feels like legion 2.0 especially with the whole jumping through windows and over pallets. I feel like the demogorgon would be better fit having some power that relates to the show more. A few ideas the devs could play off of is how the Demogoron can open portals to the upside down and apparently smell blood between dimensions. Here's a lazy and kind of shitty brainstorm to give a idea of what that could possibly be.
---
The demogorgon is able to send players to the upside down. This can happen in two ways. The first way, is after downing a survivor instead of hooking them you would put them inside the upside down. The other way is through portals. The killer could set trap like portals, and when survivors get pulled in they end up in the upside down. The killer could place these near window loops or pallets to help in the chase, or even with the correct add-ons create one fast enough that the survivor would be forced to abandon a loop. Hitting a survivor would also infect them somehow, opening them to the influence of the demogorgon. The survivors blood would turn black, but on the killers screen it would be very illukinated, allowing The Demogorgon to track survivors across the map even through walls. Demogorgon would have to choose between the upside down and regular map, depending on the situation. When survivors are in a different dimension the demogorgon cannot see them, however if they are injured can smell their blood. The demogorgon can only see blood when survivors are in a certain radius if the survivor is in the upside down and they fully loose the ability to see them through walls. The demogorgon also cannot hit survivors that are in another dimension, and has to do a channel to enter the upside down and down them.
---
So all that's well and good, but what does being in the upside down actually do, and what motivation would there be to put survivors into it?
---
Firstly, as mentioned it would be much darker. This would make things much scarier, as its much harder to see the demogorgon coming
---
The air in the upside down is toxic. If they were downed, the survivor will enter the upside down in a random part of the map in the dying state. They would have to fully recover in order to move again, and even after they did the survivor would be back on a bleedout timer. (They would have unbreakable automatically built in) It would be similar to the pigs tiner in this case. Alternatively, if the survivor was injured or healthy when entering the timer will reflect that. Healthy survivors would be injured and put on the timer, while injured ones would be on a slightly shorter timer. Survivors also cannot heal to healthy.
---
To get out a survivor would have to go to a point on the map (which is always incredibly far away from their current location no matter what to escape. When getting out of the upside down they would come out through a wall and end up back in the normal world.
---
Nope, just double checked. It's 10.
---
Most of us have been there and had that happen. Welcome to the club
---
Me running away from my problems be like:
---
You can youtube them and search around here for some in better detail than I could ever explain. I play killer and survivor evenly. Survivors will loathe your playstyle if you use both those strategies together. 
---
They can downvote us all we want but in the end you are someone seeking advice and I am someone giving it. They can hate it all they want but games are supposed to be fun so go have fun.
---
probably people who think lithe is the best
---
None of those were licensed.  Licensed characters tend to be pretty underwhelming, especially at release.  Also, all those were released quite a while ago, before the current methodology of detuned killer power.  Last, Hag and doc were both pretty unimpressive at release.
---
*Here comes Nea!!!*
---
Yeah I'm rank 20 and I feel killers are OP lol but dont worry. I know it's just coz I am a noob 😂😂
---
Somthin similar happened to me, Some Dwight I didn’t see all game t-bagged at exit when I was huntress and turned a 1k into a 3k cuz he wanted to brag
---
I'm confused, are these supposed to be wild guesses without reading the bios?
---
Different game then. In my defense, Doctor canonically tortures people in his lore, I was just being accurate
---
They could bamboozle us, but I honestly can't think of what else it would be. Plus, we're due for a ptb soon, and it would be weird if they don't release any big teasers soon.
---
Only Nurse can hold the power role. Billy and Spirit are still subject to looping and control. The only difference is Billy has pressure and Spirit has mindgames
---
It is what allows a much larger variety of maps. It would be much much worse if every map was handcrafted as things would become very predictable and boring.
---
Lol that’s what you get
---
Myers pulled the reverse Uno card
---
Even that isn't up to them. There's so many ways that you can take that from them right under their nose, with nothing they can do
---
what you or me have to say about this has no importance.
---
Devs need to look at a lot of games where DC happens to understand the reason and see if it's possible to change things to prevent that players feel the need to DC again.
---
Of course that exclude people who will DC no matter what...
---
No shit Sherlock
---
I feel like leaving could do something like in overwatch (weird comparion ik). You would have the amount of bloodpoints you gain reduced for a certain amount of matches, on top of loosing a FULL rank.
---
Leave Ron Jeremy out of this.
---
Well, there's multiple things wrong with this thing. First of all, the implementation of this mechanic would be hard AF. Secondly, the killer is supposed to be the powerful one who has to kill 4 lower powered players, which balances out the gameplay. Being able to kill the killer would break the balance, and take away from the killer aspect. Survivors are supposed to run, hide and escape from the killer, not focus on him, which they aren't built to do. The last reason is to do with the lore, because it would not make fucking sense for the entity to allow the killing of his handyman, the killer already has the challenge of catching the survivors, and that's probably the main reason why it will never happen.
---
man, steve is the best part of that show.
---
Stipe Miocic won back the heavyweight title last night. Not sure how many crossover fans there are, but this just felt like it could be the Trapper. Or of course an all new killer.
---
Lol no not me, but he got what he asked for haha
---
Because that’s not abusing it. That’s utilizing it for something. And, again, it literally does not exist and probably won’t, so there’s no reason to have a stick in your rear about it. Survivors would like fun perks to use too.
---
When I see a survivor do this I am always like: "Oh boy he will be in for a suprise."
---
I have not enough time to keep up with rank reset and because of that I play against low ranks most of the time.
---
Then we have that one rank 1 survivor who thinks I am a baby killer.....
---
Can’t tell if you’re actually crazy or just trolling
---
Not really, and i think that's because there isn't really anything *like* dbd. Sure there are other asymmetrical games but dbd just has such a refined and different taste to it, for me at least. For that reason, no I wouldn't say it has. It just fits into a niche and I play it alongside my other main games, always coming back to it eventually when I quit because it's so unique to other games.
---
She jumped straight into the knife.
---
It may only count each survivor once.
---
I fully agree. The only thing that wouldn't make sense to me is how Billy was being controlled by the shadow monster (the mind flayer) which I don't think would work well in lore being how it's the entity's realm and having a very powerful being such as the shadow monster may not be a wise choice... or even possible for that matter.
---
If they have TTV they are getting mori'd no exceptions
---
I play Mr. Face so I can do both
---
Its kobe I guess
---
Hey, I've seen this one already!
---
I wait for half an hour, find a match, then get the "Disconnected from host" message. Very infuriating
---
/u/Ferrenry's right, [BHVR's still an exhibitor at Gamescom](https://www.gamescom.global/exhibitor/behaviour). They're showing something off, they just might not have a booth. ~~Even though this page shows exactly where their booth is.~~ I think Patricia's just trying to throw us off.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Ahh, if that's the case, that would make a difference.
---
Been there. I don't even bother struggling out of it or wiggling. I deserve it at that point
---
Wasn't that supposed to be fixed in like the last 2 patches?
---
It’s so fucking infuriating, I’ll end the game in 4 mins, chases lasting &lt;15 seconds and then I get punished for it. It’s bullshit. HeY yOu DiD gOoD, eNdEd ChAsEs QuIcK, hErE’s A *b l a c k p i p*
---
It's a cool netflix series. You should go watch the first episode and see if you like it at least. What, did you expect me to go into detail on all of the plot? I'm not going to ruin it for you! Go watch it and see if you like it, that's the advice i'll give.
---
I truly believe that the only way anyone gets this achievement is via Killer pity.
---
Unless you're like 99% on the last gen RIGHT beside an exit gate as the second to last Survivor is being Mori'd on the other side of the map I can't see how else it could happen.
---
I'm on ps4 and the salt just caused me to turn off my messages so they can't rage at me for just playing the game. I mean seriously though, if you t bag then you really asked for it.
---
you cant pick up a slug if someone is healing it you brainlet, jeff couldve just started healing her and OP wouldnt have been able to pick her up without hitting jeff first. Let me emphasize: brainlet don't talk about shit you know nothing about.
---
I just hit 9k shards for the first time!
---
Thanks for the tip! That's good to know, and i'll look into getting suggested perk to my current build (:.
---
Instead of playing a threatening sound effect when it activates, they just throw the piano down a set of stairs and use that.
---
Going by what the Devs have said in the past about not wanting to have quote-unquote "monsters" in the game I'm betting Billy the Third.
---
*Burrito
---
didnt the devs say no kid characters?
---
Ha ha... Yeah. 
---
I've totally never done that before.
---
Definitely isn't where my user flair comes from-
---
Im highly convinced its gonna be infected Billy. The nexflix twitter post had a rat emoji on it. Billy used the rats first as a mean of infecting eveyone else. For the survivor i could see it being Hopper or Steve as they are the fan favorite adults.
---
Your build looks pretty solid already to me, you might want to play around with Barbeque and Chili instead of Discordance and see which you prefer.
---
They both achieve similar things so might just be worth checking which you find yourself getting the most use out of.
---
As someone else said, might also be worth trying to squeeze A Nurse's Calling in somewhere, as your build slows healing down a lot so you might catch some people out with it, though it's tough to fit it. I suppose see how your current build goes and see how many times noed is useful in your games, and make the decision afterwards whether to swap it out or not.
---
Hope you have fun anyway, your current build idea doesn't look bad at all, just experiment with some replacements and see what works best for you.
---
i believe so....he is a teacher i just don't know if he taught in japan- and since i like to imagine the survivors are the protagonists to their own hypothetical movie against the killers, I'd headcanon that if it isn't already true
---
When someone has Object of Obsession
---
Mid ranks isnt really a selling point in many people's books
---
if you genuinely think that you either don't play killer or aren't good at it, I think I've been hit with DS from tunneling about 5 times total since the nerf came out, every other time I've hooked someone else before finding the guy with DS. That isn't tunneling right? I chased and downed someone else, but because the survs were so fast at going down DS was still up. 
---
With old DS you could at least slug the obsession and bleed them out, with this you're forced to slug even when you're not tunneling.
---
Man I wanted to know if that fixed it lol dang wraith didn't let you get back to the exit.
---
R.I.P low budget games like that are always bad
---
You would need to push to red ranks in order to make those videos. New players want the best players to teach them
---
Dead Before Sunlight is an insymmetrical game.
---
Not to be rude, but someone in the low average rank range shouldn't be coaching.
---
Lmao the crossed out mematic watermark is the only funny part
---
Oh, of course, that’s true only when it’s a survivor perk in question lmao how many killer perks are no skill perks? and there’s already a ton of no skill perks in the game already... and you’re talking about a game with an incredible amount of RNG that will make skill pointless in many situations. 
---
If you think that way, what difference does it make what I think would be fun and interesting in a perk? Lmao
---
Except identity V is actually good
---
I’m on PS4 so no way to know unfortunately :(
---
with legion you can cause many people to be injured, therefore making them have to heal. You can catch them healing with nurses. Also thatnataphobia makes healing longer, so you have more time to catch them healing.
---
Not to be rude, but I'd rather send my stuff to Ardetha who is one of the best killers in the game, rather than a 500 hour rank 11. I just feel like if I'm asking for coaching, it has to be from someone who is high ranks
---
I cleanse them but there’s not effective way to hunt them
---
A class is... Oh fuck this was actually harder to explain than I thought it would be...
---
In programming, a class is basically a box containing everything related to a specific thing, like a user, person, management, etc. The class holds pretty much everything about the killer.
---
In general spaghetti code fashion though, I doubt they use as many classes as they should, wouldn't surprise me if they had one class for survivors and one for killers. Just slap everything into a single class, no structure or documentation, that's the beauty of spaghetti code.
---
Woah woah woah what the fuck
---
Also keep noed. It will save your life in endgame
---
The next level of Jumpscare Myers, when he just fucking manifests behind you
---
This is beautiful, do you have spotify?
---
this is why t bagging is useless
---
I'm reaching rank 1 for the past 7 seasons for both killer and survivor, so I'd know what I'm talking about.
---
r/whooosh
---
Why is this a bad thing? You admit to already getting someone else. The perk serves its purpose of not making you tunnel. The fact that you could knock others down and take a DS means you're doing really well.
---
Oh I didn’t notice that.... Well I can’t blame you when I’ve done the same.
---
I actually think it needs a slight buff. I think the timer should stop if you’re in a chase. Players who are good survivors in chases get punished because they might not get immediately downed. I also think the hit zone should be slightly bigger. I say this as someone who plays killer and survivor equally, if that matters at all.
---
Well deserved. I can't say I don't bag, but once the killer is near I leave.
---
Most of the time,I heal people in the gates for the extra points if anything
---
Prob did it on purpose.
---
I can just see the comic;
---
Kate: OWO Hewwo daddy-sempai.
---
*goes to nuzzle*
---
Shape: *moris*
---
Alright, you clearly don’t understand lol you seem to have a pretty biased understanding of gameplay on both sides so I’m not even gonna bother with you anymore. Only thing that bothers me about this conversation is your ignorance but I can’t fix that. Have a great day lol
---
With NOED?
---
Oh yeah my bad. I forgot that doctor isn't base game on pc. In that case I would do bbq and chili ( mostly for bp because legion gets so many) sloppy butcher, nurses calling, and discordance.
---
Oh yes daddy vore me &lt;3
---
The entity also likes making marketing deals.
---
Can i get template for dis?
---
Nurses for what above said and save the best for last because u can get free stacks by stabbing someone twice while frenzying
---
Is he a clown if nothing of value was lost tho? 🤔
---
When did the bug happen?
---
you never see this anymore
---
When I get blown out by survivors I will actually just stand in the corner by the exit, that way they know I will not chase them, there will not be any t bags, just gtfo so I can get on to the next match.
---
When there's 4 survivors running purple flashlights with the best add ons.
---
I’m not saying make it easier to find them but as someone said maybe add a totem counter next to where you see how many gens are left so you can at least know how many you have left to find.
---
Why is Barnie looking hung
---
Most of the comments here are cursed or just wrong
---
You are the one that thinks putting a ds on demand is a good idea and think i am the one being biased
---
You insulted me saying i should take the stick out of my rear and sayig petty things like "no fun allowed"
---
And the creator of the perk admitted it shouldnt work the way you specify
---
But yes, i am the ignorant one
---
i finally stunned a killer with head on while he was carrying a survivor, it was EGC and the other 2 people escaped already. we managed to both escape as well. they thanked me and i just felt good :)
---
i know its not much but i never managed to do it before :)
---
Which could buy us time to get back on the gen we are near/working on and complete it in peace before coming to unhook.
---
I’m a killer main and I even think this is stupid. Come on ds right now is great I don’t see why you’re complaining about it. It’s a tunnel deterrent, so if you are complaining about it than I can tell how you play
---
"No. I didn't." :D
---
Adrenaline, dead hard, Balenced landing. Head on for memes
---
He could’ve also saved her but he didn’t
---
I’m laughing way too much at this. Thank you.
---
That’s what I’ve noticed about a lot of teams, especially if its their main “chase me” survivor they end up panicking and end up losing.
---
Thanks for sharing /s
---
Exactly!
---
I prefer deceased by dawn
---
I t bag to say friends lol. That’s how you used to do it before it became disrespectful. I still do it and sometimes it works where the killer and I become friends lol
---
Sort of abusable bug which allowed mixed killers or even killer+survivor mix such as a jack with chainsaw...
---
We get it more shit-perks, u can leave the frontpage now.
---
yes, it means I'm doing well and being punished for doing well, good enough reason to be upset tbh.
---
the fact that you flex about rank 1 makes it quite clear you don't
---
I sandbagged a teammate for doing that once. She did absolutely nothing the whole match (I had Bond, she was hiding almost the whole time, only made like 5-6k BP) against a baby Wraith and she teabagged right at the gate. Ended up getting in front of her to bodyblock, *bam,* killer has NOED. He picks her up and I go on my merry way. I got chewed out by her but the killer and I were both pretty happy lol.
---
That’s so evil haha I love it. Might have to do that next time I play hag
---
that makes it too easy though. If the game tells you how many active totems are left, then it is telling you the killer has totem perks. You're not supposed to be able to see the killer's perk, or survivor's perks during the match for fair play.
---
If a killer has a perk you will see the relating totem with light on it, when close by. If the totem is not active, because no perk, then there is no light on it.
---
Its a risk vs reward mechanic. The only way the devs can allow survivors to know how many totems are active is if killer's are allowed to know what perks survivors have during the match
---
oh, so you're just an asshole to everyone even if they're agreeing with you. I see.
---
Great assumption my guy, truly a 5Head, you could decipher my opinion from a statement which is only loosely related. 
---
(if you dont get the sarcasm: no, I don't necessarily think that, it's not that simple anyways).
---
Don’t keep noed, first, it takes up a spot and if survivors realize that you’re bad enough they will most likely think that you have noed and cleanse all the totems. Second, you can get a lot better without using noed and reach higher ranks, third, the amount of hate mail you will get for having noed is insane
---
One thing you can do is to just turn the other way, and moonwalk into the exit so they fuck off quicker and they don’t get the satisfaction.
---
If only
---
I call her "la Claudia"
---
What perks would you suggest?
---
"Dead Before Daylight"  
---
Oh that's when you're a SWF of level 20s and the matchmaking puts you against a P3 Myers.
---
Lmfao I was like yeah dont call jeff marilynn Manson and I saw Bill
---
So far its pretty great, but for some reason i always find the obsession first!
---
Might thought clown had NOED
---
no but i’m garbage at low ranks because they confuse the fuck out of me. WHY ARE YOU DROPPING PALLETS WHEN IM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP
---
Ohhh, i had no clue. Idk what her excuse is then haha
---
Cocky SwFs honestly aren’t that bad. Just find the weak link, there’s always a baby survivor in their SwF so find them, let him feed you all the pallets so the other survivors will have nothing to work with, then proceed to snowball for the win. And never give attention to the guy who wants your attention, let him follow you so he’s wasting time. It’s the non-cocky SwFs that play smart that are hard to beat

And in what ways is that like Ds? Ds isn’t high risk high reward at all. Ds is “I got unhooked and tunneled” and doesn’t even actually solve the tunneling problem. If this perk allowed you to do something like what I described it require you to put yourself at risk to try to save someone else (which fits with the characters altruistic nature written in the backstory). Not only that, but if it is a one pop perk, that means it’s gone for the rest of the match. It would also require that person to be staying near the killer to try to get it, which would mean they aren’t doing gens, either. Also, the killer can carry someone and chase someone else and have the game identify that as a chase, so it would still follow the guidelines you established. There would also have to be a window of hitbox the survivor would have to successfully hit, and to make it more balanced, it could be given a skillcheck channel like DS, meaning they might not even hit it anyway. This can also be countered by killer perks like distressing or something. It would be an incredibly situational perk and most of the time wouldn’t do anything. But again it does not and most likely will not ever exist in the game, so I’m not sure what you’re even bugging about.
---
I'll wack a survivor who's on the hook If he pissed me off. But I'll never really teabag a killer at the exit gate. This is because I feel like teabagging at the gate is just annoying because it's kind of like saying I'm better than you, but with wacking someone that's on the hook it's just a way of saying " I got you ya little shit!" At least that's what these things mean to me when I see them.
---
It's just favorite made up rule.
---
I think there should be some way to aim the thrown item. Add more skill to it.
---
Yeah and if a person runs in front of your car you should hit the brakes.
---
Nah, once revealed NOED puts everyone under the exposed status effect, he would've known.
---
If it glows, it goes
---
From someone who's reached red rank seeing you flex about rank makes you look like a fucking idiot.
---
Good shit
---
It’s possible but I’m guessing he downed the nea after the gates opened, so he would’ve known
---
They could just swap the character sizes and proportions
---
I tend to not use obsession perks often for this very reason. I don’t like ignoring a survivor it makes me feel like they’re free to do whatever they want the whole match. I think on killers who have an insta down it’s a lot stronger because hitting your obsession won’t make you lose all the stacks at least. Found it fun on hillbilly and Myers but found sloppy butcher more meta to save my gens.
---
Oh I did the same exact thing. To a teammate that hid the whole entire match. Killer downed me and let me point out the no good teammate. Once they healed me, I ran up to the killer and told them to follow me. Got the teammate killed, and the killer let me escape.
---
Depends on the killer, It works best on m1 killers, and I personally like it on stealth killers, like Myers, Ghost Face, etc
---
so you want a counter that will say 4 totems left, meanwhile the killer has 0 totem related perks? That is pointless.... survivors will be pursuing totems for no reason then.
---
Oh same, I stopped caring about winning 2,500 hours ago, the tgrill of chase and catching thqt one POS/ saving someone from a face camper makes this game for me
---
Hey there other fellow ace main. We’re all here now.
---
Survivor: plays claudette
---
Killer:
---
Actually what you are doing is being a self absorbed elitist fuck right now. Talking down to people you personally feel are intellectually inferior to yourself. I dont care if you like or dislike the show, but because you somehow think that people enjoying the show makes them intellectually inferior to yourself just proves my point that you are just an asshole. 
---
And for what its worth, your personal opinion on whether or not you enjoy something says nothing about the actual quality of a work. There are plenty of really well made media that I genuinely do not find enjoyable, but unlike you, I don't need to express disdain for people who enjoy it in order to feel like my opinion is justified.
---
8/21 seems like a reasonable reveal date but this is on the same level as that one dude who took random numbers from the bible, did basic math operations to combine them, and used the answer to predict that May 21, 2011 and October 21, 2011 were the end of the world
---
I derank to get out of red. It's so unfun. You have to sweat hard to get out and are forced to used survivor meta™ to survive. Purple is ok because it's a challenge but miss me with that rank 4 bullshit.
---
quick, run to the other door :(
---
Thicc boys gotta stick together.
---
Bamboozle and brutal strenght don't help killing someone faster? Even if it's a "discount" version cutting chase time implicate that you will be able to hook faster therefore kill them faster. The same thing goes for enduring and Spirit Fury.
---
Getting the job done faster doesn't mean Just "walk faster swing faster and sacrifice faster" 
---
Not only that, If you count perks that "punish" players for doing their job we have Rancor, Sole survivor, NOED, Fire Up, A Nurse's Calling, Play with your food etc (most of them are killer perks wow)
---
None of them are "punishments" they are all come back perks. But by your logic they "punish" people.
---
And the one that seems to have no concept is you buddy, If a survivor dies this already implicates that the gens are going slower, the killer did their job. This perk idea would try to "compensate" a dead teammate with a slight boost to your gen speed (no one is talking about a 75% boost ok?)
---
Not only that, a perk that demands a teammate to be dead means you'll play with 3 perks until someone dies (and If you die first the perk was useless) and doing gens as the last one standing is Just a waste of time. Wich means this perk will only be useful if there are 2 survivors alive and doing gens.
---
By the end of the day this perk would be situational and a way for solo survivors to try to compensate bad teammates. It would NOT be op nor a way to "punish" the killer.
---
But when would NOED have been revealed
---
*facepalm* safe hooks guys... safe hooks.
---
Ok, but who is Daredevil then?
---
The only times my friends and I T-bag at the gate is when the killer was being toxic that match.
---
It’s not meant to be taken srsly
---
His power is baseball bat, it's one a shot move but takes 10 seconds to recharge
---
this is sorta funny
---
I don’t understand how someone could do literally nothing except cleanse two dull totems and hide in a corner, yet still feel the need to taunt like they outplayed the whole game.
---
I’d just uninstall at that point
---
Assuming Nea had adrenaline which seems unlikely since she got killed off hook with 60 seconds
---
It's not a punishment. Knock down your other victims/hook them or whatever, and slug the last guy. If you're as good as you say you are then this should be preferable to facing 4 DSs all at once.
---
While i don't think we are getting 2 survivors it would make sense for them to go truly all out on this Chapter. They get the chance to play around with everything involving Stranger Things? It would be crazy of them to not go all out. We have no idea what to expect other than just saying "1 Survivor, killer and map"
---
Exactly! I thought about something like Huntress' hatchets.
---
I’m picturing the TF2 Scouts taunt kill
---
Dead by being stupid
---
This happened to me last night except it was a David.
---
New Emote for survivors or killers?
---
I tried playing that one day when xbox was down. I waited 15 minutes for the game to start after everyone readied up. Long story short, it never started.
---
Maybe I'm just a sadistic fuck, but when I see people that are that angry I just laugh my ass off.
---
Hold up you can swing through head on and hit them? Lmfaooooo rip. My friend loves this perk a lot and he’s gonna be devastated. Also the hitboxes are AWFUL.
---
You fucking monster
---
You can't heal yourself with autodidact, you can only heal others
---
I cant tell the difference
---
Only the manliest men play Bubba.
---
On PC? No way. She’s such a high pressure super mobile killer that taking away from her lethality should’ve happened years ago. Besides, for good nurses, the scratch marks only really make a difference on lerys and the game.
---
Ok to each their own then there’s no reason for us to even be conversing lol
---
From now on you are cursed to only play against rank 1 prestiged Claudettes.
---
Ayy a clown player! I feel like I never see anyone else who plays the clown.
---
Also I can only imagine the post-game chat haha.
---
i dont have any clips of the first time i was playing but i remember how my first game went anyways it was rank reset i was killer and i was getting straight up builled by some survivors with around 3000 maybe 2000 hours and a 2000 hour survivor who was the one who didnt bully me he even let me kill him now around 5 to 6 months later i have 1000 hours on the game a few prestiged killers and survivors  (mostly killer cuz killer main) and if   a youre a survivor who builles bby killers please stop and help them
---
When ghostface gets revealed
---
I mean, Netflix made a post with 3 pictures that had the words "dead" "by" and "daylight" hidden in each sentence.
---
When they get downed in 10 seconds and realise they aren't the heir to noob3 they let out a scream of rage and karate chop their ethernet cable in two
---
can u link me to the post?
---
I don’t see what’s wrong here
---
Ty for response
---
Why would having p3 trapper make you good. It has nothing to do with skill
---
I actually didn’t know that about the pig, that makes it almost a must-have for her honestly, especially considering how lackluster her base kit is
---
Clown: They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
you provide such a low standard of discussion with your insults "lol, lmao" every few seconds its not even worth it to be honest
---
Yet you still replied nice one
---
Is he kidding? Is this a joke?
---
I don't think the ranking system is punishing you for it. It's just that there's too little data for a match that short so the system can't properly judge how well you played. To be safe, you neither ranked up nor down.
---
Yeah I keep my chat off typically. Lol I'm going to play the game how it should be and I don't care if people get salty or not. I'm not toxic by any means, like I don't camp or tunnel but in the past I've gotten my share of toxicity lol
---
Yeah alright, let's make the hardest killer to learn impossible to learn.
---
Yeah it’s a very overlooked mechanic on her, and frankly, I don’t understand why it works, but it does. Just keep in mind that ambush attacks won’t give you any stacks either.
---
I think they should just make her fatigue time slightly longer
---
If the devs won’t kill the game, the community will
---
Can you not post it here on Reddit ?
---

I dont have the link to the post itself since i dont use twitter but heres a reddit post with a screenshot
---
There are a lot of strange mechanics like that, like how chainsawing your obsession with LF while runnin PWYF takes away a stack and then gives it right back
---
Full grey team vs rank 10. Usually the ranks are at least proper when you take into account the average. But when you look at this one the average wouldn’t put us together at all.
---
Clownnn😍😍😍

Also teabagging is toxic af

As soon as you get it hide it next to an exit gate for later
---
Let’s not forget that we’re talking about a killer that, once you devote a few days to learning her, can wipe entire teams with no generators completed.
---
Its on my phone, but my phone is a piece of shit and won't let me even install reddit.

How do you know?
---
I don't know how I feel about the toolbox stun perk but the others I think are great.

They fixed that recently I believe.

So he steamrolled a baby doctor with bp perks rip

Or is it

2
---
1
---
?????
---
educated guess lol
---
It's absolutely designed to effect a killer trying to pick up a survivor that had been unhooked within the last 60 seconds. 
---
Players on both sides have to go out of their way to play around opponents perks in almost every match, there's a lot of perks that require playing around, that's a huge aspect of the game..
---
I wouldn’t know, I don’t play LF, but I know a lot of people weren’t sure if it was a bug or not, there are a few killers I’m not too great with, so I only ever know about the really major changes
---
I escaped an insidious Bubba and depipped
---
Yeah it kinda gets your camera stuck but its easy to resolve,  any swing or action will get rid of it or if you to look a little grabby the entire time during a chase be my guest and stay that way lol
---
Basically, noed is a dumb perk. It’s dumb because if you need it, you’ve already lost... the ENTIRE game you could’ve had another perk helping you catch people, end loops, slow generators... but no, not you Mr NOED, you waited until you were getting your ass kicked and had a perk specifically designed to keep you from deranking instead of using a perk that could’ve actually helped you. 
---
As someone who plays killer a bit more than survivor, seeing a killer think NOED is a good choice makes me sad. 
---
In a video game, when you’re trying to get better, you aren’t supposed to be operating under the assumption that things are going to go horribly wrong, and NOED goes against that mindset.
---
When it was D-Strike, took them over a year to fix it. Nurse’s omega blink addons are unchanged as well, the devs took a full year and a half to fix Freddy. They aren’t exactly quick to change many things
---
There are a lot of ways actually. It's strong, but certainly not unbeatable
---
Just had this happen. Bbq didn't show the last survivor and the one on the hook was killing themselves next to hatch. Plan wasn't any more obvious and I still got flak for looking around the area.
---
“horror scarry game”
---
Forced window loops and double window tiles need to go if you ask me. Other stuff is endurable. And buffing weaker killers ofc. Sometimes its as little as *not* giving clown a slowdown when charging a bottle can really help.
---
Yeah you're a fucking noob if you don't understand how it doesn't have counterplay I guaranfuckingtee you that you never played against prayer beads in your life you fucking killermain trash.
---
Btw i didnt downvote u pls dont hurt my precious internet points
---
Any liscensed killer and certain cosemetics thats about it
---
The Phoenix was a fanmade killer on the forums, I don't know how it got as much traction as it did.
---
The Game is like 2nd best, but still nowhere near as good as Lery's for Scratched Mirror Myers. If the survivors are somewhat decent they can see you coming long before you can reach them since while there are tight corners for you to sneak around, there's a lot of open space by basically every single gen minus the bathroom.
---
I don't think any killer should be excused away from a game mechanic permanently. It'd simply be unfair then, whilst they are utilizing their power sure however.
---
ahhhhh, ive been blinded and now my eyes have been opened
---
It always seems to be the SWF rank 20 TTVs who have a rank 1 in their party.
---
thank you for giving me your point of view i’ll do my best to apply your demand
---
And thats when you know its a troll account XD
---
Fair enough but with MoM they slapped a nerf on it the same month, so they can do it, they are just lazy af.
---
Em, one im a survivor main
---
Em 2, my killer main is SPIRIT
---
And 3, You can counter prayer beads, *if your good enough*
---
ok, thanks, i was actually confused what class meant, but that makes sence
---
I don’t see how that would cause any bugs? You’re just switching proportions to make trapper play as a regular survivor rather than some giant Buffon. There’s probably be more glitches associated with not doing that like when doing gens body parts not touching or glitching inside of gens, same thing with pallets and lockers, along with feeling super slow with the same body size and a slower movement speed.
---
Oh wow so no chase is initialized if you moonwalk???
---
Right, everyone knows its broken af overpoweredly strong with no counterplay but sure, tell us this counter you figured out that nobody else seems to be able to figure out?
---
Does it show that way on the survivors screen or is it just on the killers? If it's stuck in that animation on the survivors screen then I'll be damned if I unfreeze it, "Imaaa gonna getcha!"
---
I got called a pure tub of lard once. Funniest message I had ever got
---
Which killers are "liscensed"?
---
Although the games are very, very different. That doesn't mean that DBD can never add a new mechanic to the game.
---
 Imagine needing to break all five totems, break all the hooks on the map except the basement, mabey make a new ritual thing the survivors might need to do and then finaly they could defeat the killer on the basement hooks. It would need a four man swf, no gens would get done because all the survivors would be out on their scavengers hunts and so on and so forth. It would never work with randoms, and once they start, with no gen pressure, the survivors would need to be all to defeat the killer.
---
Im no coder, don't ask me about how it would be balanced, IDK, but how awesome would that be!
---
It says in the post about at least 1 situation it should be useful.
---
I'm a survivor main on PC and I'm just saying that is not THAT hard go against the nurse as long as u know how to escape from her line of sight and juke her.
---
Only Licensed DLC. Myers, Freddy, Pig, Leatherface, and Ghostface are pay only killers. Survivors include Laurie, Ash, Tapp, and Quentin are pay only. Bill Overbeck is free. 
---
Perks can be obtained as teachables from each survivors/killers bloodweb or through the Shrine. Technically you can access every perk without paying, it just requires so much patience. Maps are available to all.
---
"Emetophilia is the sexual arousal from vomiting, or watching others vomit."
---
You're not allowed to suggest nurse changes where she still won't be the most powerful. It's against the rules. Sorry.
---
If it's not clear enough in the video, I do have another clip which is more clear, but I chose this one cause she gets killed
---
Rofl yeah you're a spiritmain, no wonder you think it has counters, fuck off.
---
Any killer from a movie such as Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, Ghostface, etc.
---
for the first question. everyone who's licensed from a movie
---
Killers:
---
Michael Myers - Shape 
---
Bubba Sawyer  - Cannibal 
---
Freddy Krueger  - Nightmare 
---
Amanda Young  - Pig 
---
Danny Johnson  - Ghost Face 
---
Survivors:
---
Laurie Strode (the only one worth a damn)
---
Quentin Smith
---
David Tapp
---
Ash Williams
---
for the second question:
---
Freddy is probably the best, he has been recently reworked. Most of the strongest perks and killers are available at base tho.
---
if you want to play killer, I suggest you to buy Bubba, because of his perk BBQ and Chilli, which up to doubles your bloodpoint gains and has a sometimes useful aura reading
---
I don’t think they’d add Billy as a killer since we already have both a Billy and a Bill. Also, the demogorgon is more marketable imo
---
Well atleast you were a PURE tub of lard... better than being a dirty one I guess lol!
---
When Ghostface sees Myers stalking HIM. Lol.
---
Someone got pressed real quick, you that bad you need to come on reddit and think your funny, when your really just fucking trash, CANT RELATE
---
Bruh you didn't even know what the addon was, you're a troll by just being a rank 15 sharing his thoughts and using his vote-button like he has any fucking clue bout this game.
---
When the Huntress divorces Tapp and she is giving you them eyes
---
Its shows the killer in the middle of the animation so it looks like your gonna grab them on the shoulder and stabbed them it scares them so much.
---
Yes except everyone knows you're the real omron considering you think prayer beads are balanced, you're a joke.
---
Lockers exist.  DS really shouldn't work on grabs.
---
Yeah
---
Hell yeah it's more marketable lol
---
That’s part of the charm
---
idea: what if the key was in a case, so to use it you would have to take a sec to take it out then use it on a hatch and it would be easier to see in hand and on the ground
---
When did i say they were balanced
---
I think that those are really cool ideas! Good job!
---
I said if your good against spirits you can semi counter them, fucking idiot
---
But if you're getting your ass kicked, that means survivors had plenty of time to do totems. NOED punishes lazy survivors more so than it rewards bad killers. Even great killers not playing Nurse are often going to have the gates powered even when they played well. The current meta is very strong for survivors in red rank. I don't use NOED myself, but as a person who survives 95%+ of my games I completely get why some do
---
"learn to play against it", go away you're dumb.
---
Oh I know, I know. They're always shocked when the killer, y'know, kills people
---
Oh my first game with Plague was in The Game as well! Though I got bullied by a 4 man swf :/
---
Go away you're dumb.
---
Yet your the one arguing with a spirit main, about the spirit, you fuck off
---
Uh rank 9 killer main and rank 12 survivor that doesnt play spirit geez maybe you need the good ol' "Get Gud Pleb" treatment if its that much of an issue BHVR would have fixed by now or would annouce it.
---
It’s a strategic tactic
---
 Tunneling- Tunneling is considered toxic by a lot of people, and if you tunnel for no reason it is. Tunneling to gain pressure is sometimes seen as ok, especially if you are going to lose the game or are playing as a lower tier killer.
---
 Camping- There are two different types of camping. Proxi-Camping, where you patrol relatively close to the hook, is fine. Face-camping, where you sit in front of a survivor until they die, preventing a resue, is considered incredibly toxic, and is the worst thing you can do as a killer. If you know someone is nearby, its fine to stay close for the rescue, just dont stand right in front of the hooked person
---
 Slugging- Slugging (leaving someone on the ground) is only toxic if you dont have a reason for it. If someone is on death hook or a gen is about to be completed, slugging is fine. If someone is nearby, its fine to slug to chase after the other person
---
 Aside from that, shaking you head wildly when downing or carrying someone is the equivalent of teabagging, and while hitting someone while they are hooked is also slightly toxic, I think its fine to give them a quick smack if they teabagged
---
For me survivor feels fine but it tanks hard as killer. I've no idea why, I guess the easiest and most broad answer is simply poor optimization.
---
Exactly baby killer and babysurvivor, who's the troll now buddy, take all your votes back because clearly I'm superior to you in any way and anything I say you should accept as facts.
---
You're a moronmain irl.
---
Well, which map? I am a Ghost Face main and let go two survivors lately, haha
---
Get a life, mama your a joke
---
Seems every discussion is controversial at this point honestly, Ill just enjoy being downvoted to oblivion
---
I only hit survivors on the hook after they pissed me off you know the type to bodyblock and follow you and when I teabag at the exit gates I’m just savoring my victory because against all odds(like noed) I still made it out
---
I hardly ever notice when no one shows up, I just want bloodpoints.
---
Killed before coffee.
---
You’re a fucking joke
---
Still thw game is one of the funniest maps.
---
Except when the killer is Doctor or Hag Nurse since they are at full power there.
---
Thanks for help guys!
---
scarry*
---
The Game i cant remember his name but i said he could have my "firt born" after the game
---
And when the survivors aren’t lazy and catch all the totems going through, you have a dead perk. Congrats, still a wasted slot.
---
And theres the "im soooo superior treatment" that is usual with a troll lmao,  What you gonna do next call me braindead or say im a noob. Trust me I hear it from a lot of people with negative karma lol
---
Tell me about it they it need an adjustment
---
Back off is way to strong. Imagine a survivor with No Mither, Back Off, Left Behind, and No one left behind. Unbelievably op build
---
Thats a very good jason cosplay part 5 is one of the best looking

Game over
---
If you’re so trash at going against PB use spine chill for baby survivors learning
---
No problem man hope you have fun with the game as so many other have!
---
Some nurses maybe but have you really never gone against some legacy 3 nurse on like 7 tabs of adderall that seems to have permanent bbq because of pure gamesense? If not, there’s this guy I used to play against constantly called How’s it hanging ? On YouTube. 900 hours pc survivor main btw.
---
How can you tell?
---
Myers is done with your shit.
---
You should hear it from everyoen because it's a fact you just admitted. If I say prayer beads are overpowered, and you look on youtube and you see all these prayer beads builds with killermains with 1000s of hours say how strong it is and how fun they find it, but no, mr rank 9 rank fucking 12 who doesn't even know wtf the addon I'm talking about does, he knows best that it's balanced, your fucking parents should slap you around some more. Blocked.
---
Yeah? At least they did totems which marginally slows down the gen rush. Again, I don't use it. Never did much for me when I used to. But I get it. Maybe gens should take longer and killers wouldn't feel the need to run it
---
Yeeting medkits is new meta confirmed
---
It's still pointless, even if she can't see, once she blink toward u, u're dead.
---
i played with my cousin when the glitch was still big, like a month ago or more i dont remember when and he was new, he is lucky i knew were the hatch was and escaped
---
Sharp hand joe needs a nerf in this game.
---
Fair and good  teammate? You moon walked to and right past a teammate on their struggle phase
---
Yeah, dude lol
---
I dunno about you but I really enjoy the atmosphere of the game. The dark tones and suspenseful and intense music really bring the game to life.
---
Oh yeah so if you're so bad at going vs MoM just play chainsaw billy all game everygame because that's a viable counter. Boom it's so easy to block morons like you man, it's done, goodbye.
---
“You T bagged so you deserve to get downed because of a bullshit hitbox on Hillbilly’s chainsaw” man I love this community
---
Oh I agree, gens should take longer (at red ranks). And you say marginally slowed down gen rush but... I do totems for points and there are plenty of people that do the same... so is it actually slowing anyone down if you were going to do them anyways? Nope.
---
You moonwalked to and right past a teammate on their struggle phase. How is that a good and fair team play?
---
I just playwd a game where the killer is a lag switcher.  loosers.
---
They should really change the scoring event to reflect one shot down chases being ended. As simple as having a “chase” equal a health state instead of penalizing you for using your ability. Also rip if you run against 4 no mithers enjoy that black pip
---
I love her lot! Gotta say the first perk is def my favorite, honestly. You did a good job on her perks and design
---
It seems someones opinion is unpopular here and discrepency #2 only pays attention to half the message and attacks me personally still oh so predictable
---
We arent trying to make her nigh impossible to function, almost all killers pass for what you describe, if they are near you, you are dead.
---
#ANGRY NEA NOISES

It just starts playing Il Vento D'oro
---
And again someone judges me without knowing me. You only saw one clip and not the whole game. This Jake sandbagged me twice and didn't save me when he was in front of me. That's why I didn't save him
---
And blood warden
---
Its foolish the deny how rewarding nurse is, I agree.
---
*Ha ha ha ha ha ha haaaa*
---
Nobody would say anthing about that great cosplay.
---
Jeff killed nea by healing her and then not healing when she was downed
---
Usually consoles are locked to 30-60 fps depending on the console its just something console players have to live with or modify the software that works too

If I saw this irl I'd literally scream.
---
Imagine getting triggered because somebody isn't impressed with the disproportionate effort into stating the obvious. If I wanted to somebody to bounce on my dick, I would've asked for it.
---
Amazing job! Very cool perk ideas and I like the artwork with alternate outfits. My favorite perk would be Stay Safe; I love the idea of giving additional benefits to unhooked survivors, and it could have some really interesting combos.
---
I think that’s part 6, Jason Lives, LoL
---
Inevitable doom conveniently granted moment before evening
---
Main survivor but.... feel good to see this
---
That’s a fair point, but I think there should be a way to play against her without using a stealthy playstyle, because stealth is boring IMO. Whenever you hear the first blink I have to decide whether I want to try to have fun and risk dying in the first 90 seconds, or if I want to sit in lockers and bushes all game waiting for her to leave so I can hold mouse1 on a generator for 80 seconds or more.
---
Yikes.. too late
---
First mistake was teabagging
---
It would be incredible if some generators were IN the upside down too.
---
Idk BHVR has the cards in their hand and we need to what they deal out
---
Called karma, unlucky scenario for claudette
---
Holy fucking hell. *I'm triggerd?* you really do think highly of yourself dont you? And again you are stating opinion as fact. So yes you are stating that you are intellectually superior to those who enjoy the series. But honestly I'm done engaging you, youve been nothing but condescending and rude. 
---
And newsflash: I am okay with you not liking Stranger Things! But I'm not okay with you insinuating that it somehow makes you a better person or that your opinion on it is more valid than someone else's. That is the definition of snobby. You just keep showing that you are a pretentious asshole who thinks they are better than they really are. So good day, and try not to break your neck with that galaxy brain you got on those shoulders.
---
Pretty sure GF was making up for ash, so likely not two survivors
---
I’ll keep that in note
---
Looks like there's a thin rope around his neck as he holds on.  If he gets tired and let's go he hangs I guess lol
---
With excitement!
---
Mmmm got some earlier, loved it. Gate was open, 2 were dead, one on hook. I sit there at the hooked guy waiting for the fourth to come or leave, he runs up and i hook him too, I get yelled at for camping that last guy. Classic.
---
Good ol' Jumpscare spirit shit never gets old..... Or fun to play againest but still.
---
The next chapter won't be the Stranger Things one. It seems like they follow a trend of OC then IP and since our most recent was scream it should be an original character. But for the Stranger things concept all of those characters have been exposed at one point or another to the upside down, and with S3 ending I think Hopper would be the best one because of all the speculation around the ending.
---
Ohhhhhhh
---
So heckin satisfying when this happens
---
Man, sorry about your games! You seemed very civil with how you handled it though!
---
Now say that to the Huntress
---
If your stuck at a rank it might be because of your perks and/or playstyle how do you play and what perks you have as the first question?
---
Why would you quit the game just because you don’t have a good rank?
---
If you like the game and are having fun, then keep playing, it doesn’t matter what your rank is. If you aren’t having fun, and are playing the game purely to advance in rank, this probably isn’t going to last long anyway.
---
Almost everything gets downvoted here if it's not a meme. Don't worry about it.
---
......  [r/forbiddensnacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/forbiddensnacks/)
---
Nice. Problem tho, how will I find survivors that aren’t injured? It will be problematic
---
+rancor and it’s a pretty decent combo, since you don’t have to deal with your obsession the whole game
---
Meh, I'm a little confused but seems legit.
---
You’re playing Legion. 😝
---
I’ve recently only bought the “new” killers (to me) such as Legion, Plague and Ghosty and my first matches with each ended in SWF toxicity apart from Legion where there were two level 20 SWF 😂
---
Lmao good talk.
---
Awesome thanks! This will be useful for dealing with toxic people in the future.
---
True, I just feel like survivors at high ranks know most of meta legion perks so it’s only possible to get like a 2k out of 4
---
I'm playing Legion and only have Legion's perks and the standard killer perks. I'm currently trying to level up Nurse for Nurse's Calling and Thanatophobia
---
shhh, i got flamed for saying its op, dont go my way
---
If somethings only counterplay is to have equipped one out of what 100s of perks then that's not a valid counterplay, it becomes rock paper scissors with perks vs killers. Which btw is pretty fucking common sense if you thought about it but I've brought it up before and people are too fucking dumb to understand this.
---
NOED on spirit huh
---
I didn't think about it like that. I am having fun usually, I guess I just hit a slump today. Thank you
---
Legion is not the best killer in the first place, so if you get two kills at red ranks I think you’re doing well.
---
How do you even know if it's a woman posting?
---
I could post some horny Myers shit and you'd think I was a dude because of my username. Women love fictional murderers.
---
It is not meant for chasing it’s for pulling ppl off gens cause you can’t hear her phase to you, you can’t really out smart that unless you just gen tap all 5 gens
---
I dinally buy an ps4 and my first game is dead by daylight cuz i like the game so much and i need some tips
---
who is the easyest killer to play
---
Is this supposed to make us thirst less
---
Oink Oink that needs way more upvotes
---
Oh stfu it was behind a paywall there were less people who had MoM then there are people who own spirit and probably have 20 of these trashaddons ready to go. I bring up MoM because it's a fact that it got nerfed really fucking fast, you wanna actually make the argument that a survivor running MoM was more overpowered than spirit with prayer beads, are you fucking joking? 
---
Also I don't need you tell me how to write posts just so that your salty ass would enjoy reading it.
---
What's the blob on the left? Unsure if it's a brain or one of those jumpscares you got when screaming.
---
Oh I didn't know what exactly the archive was but now I'm excited
---
I absolutely love facing spirit. Even if I do get destroyed pretty often because I suck as survivor but I just don't get the hate for her. The mindgames are strong against and as her lol even with prayer beads you can still kind of tell when she is phasing.
---
I was gonna say that is one ghastly chap
---
a Demogorgon killer would be SICK!
---
Legion is a mid-tier killer he has a decent ability but is kinda useless without nurses in high-tier play due to how little it changes the game but its still effective at your rank so keep with it. Your perks with legion i always reccomend nurses, thano, discordance, and ruin just so you have a tight hold on gens and health states. But how do you usually play?
---
Your video is literally titled toxic and you act like it
---
But im sure you're  a niceguy
---
Also I don't know what world you live in where people shouldn't judge you based on what post online.
---
You can still crash/hard-freeze (Game .exe stops responding, need to kill via task manager) during loading.
---
Wait red ranks? That’s pretty spooky. Didn’t know there was more than just your average 20-1 rank (brown)
---
No, no you can't.
---
Good to know
---
Something like the dlc map from the last of us would be really cool. 2 levels with lots of places to hide, so sick of all these forest maps tbh.
---
Noed op
---
Thank you for all the advice. I'm going to try out Legion
---
true
---
wHy ArE kIlLeRs So ToXiC
---
Too many memes like this but so relatable
---
Well in the DBD lore, the reason why Rin (The Spirit) was chosen by the entity to be the killer instead of her father was because it sensed greater potentional/rage in her. 
---
True, Billy was a major villain in the series but the way his story ended in Season 3 makes him less likely to be a killer.
---
MaoMao survivors of pure salt
---
hahah relatable
---
Having to prolong a game with bad survivors is the most boring experience this game has. But unfortunately it's for the best, because of fucking moris.
---
Its balanced lol, just swf.
---
I don't care if it's the best perk in the game, perks shouldn't be the only way to counter a killer or a build, nothing else to say if you can't figure this out I suggest you go think about it some more, I'm done with the "just pick spine chill every game"-argument.
---
Don't worry, normal toxic survivor simpletons don't read all of this text :) and those who read it all see my arguments.
---
People think sometime in the next month or so
---
Yeah it looks really cool. It’s fun to have little random goals to complete.
---
But it's not killers fault in that case, it's on your teammates.
---
It's almost as if changing a perk is easier than changing a killer
---
No wait please don’t be sad oh shit oh fuck
---
One survivor running old MoM is not op, but 4 survivors running it was total bullshit. Also, try using spine chill, its a hard counter to spirit. Btw, its just a game, you could prob chill a little and just try to have fun.
---
LMFAO
---
:)
---
Aw fuck
---
He's a disgusting racist that literally tried to to kill a child for being black. Hes not coming in as a survivor
---
ELI5: I recently got into DbD, what's a baby Dwight or baby Meg?
---
r/boneappletea anyone?
---
Its one addon of the killer you stupid fucking moron, holy fuck is this how people become schoolshooters, they meet just people like you over and over and figure mankind is doomed? Stfu.
---
I try to find a survivor asap by patrolling gens farthest from me and try to get a hit with frenzy, and locate everyone else with killer instinct. From there I focus on hooks, and will tunnel the same survivor if I can to reduce the number of people on gens. My game knowledge is flawed but that's the best I can describe it
---
No one knows that it's broken af? People think that it's a bit too strong but that's it
---
No thanks not gonna use spine chill, just remove prayer beads that'll be fine thanks.
---

---
fr lmao and this isn’t even a leak
---
Myers is like hey billy let me use this
---
OOoh no my fragile ego can't take furious crouching! Better ruin the game for someone else because they crouched repeatedly! DBD community truly tries it's hardest to catch up to the LoL community for having the biggest snowflakes with the biggest egos. You certainly weren't just playing the game if they were messaging you to rage because you decided to tunnel and camp over tbagging. They were asking for it huh? Well when or if your 'wife' gets sexually harassed, just remember she was probably asking for it. 🤷‍♀️
---
Killers get a lot of crap when they don't do anything wrong, intentionally or otherwise. If you do badly, you get crap. If you do good, you get crap. If you do decent, you get crap. There's no reasoning with some players. It's like a lot of players are either high on themselves or salty as all hell but some people are just nice and give a GG regardless of who wins or loses. I've never been mad at a Killer for offing me if they played fair, which is to say they weren't hard tunnelling or camping so everyone gets a chance to do stuff. When someone's tunnelling or camping it's pretty obvious but salty players like to claim they've been tunnelled or camped when they really haven't. I've been accused of camping several times despite the fact that after hooking someone within 10 seconds I was on the opposite end of the map and the hooked person was unhooked safely. In that case if by pure chance they cross paths with me again in the match before anyone else does that leads to accusations of tunnelling. I'm the kind of Killer that if someone gets unhooked in front of me, I let the unhooked person disappear because no one likes being farmed by their own teammates but I've still been called a tunneller if I've won. Playing both Killer and Survivor I avoid things on both sides that I consider overly exploitative or cheap like camping, tunnelling and milking the same safe pallet loop forever because as a Killer it's best to leave a hooked person to break the gens and find their teammates and as Survivor I aim to create enough distance between me and the Killer that I can break the chase and hide, which I feel takes more effort than milking as many long ass pallet loops as possible and feels more true to the spirit of the game which is to be stealthy.
---
That wasn't an ambush attack, they uncrouched. I think the problem is they weren't close enough, in my experience you have to be touching their back to grab.
---
You're allowed to think I'm a dick and have whatever preferences. I literally said you're free to think whatever you want. Just understand, nobody asked you for your sexual preferences and based on what you decided to spew all over Reddit, it's easy to surmise I probably shouldn't give a fuck what you think of me because you act like a subhuman.
---
I mean I don't want him in the game as a survivor or a killer, just that it's possible.
---
You gonna tell your magic counterplay or beat around the bush some more?
---
Not really.
---
Understandable. It happens for both sides, too. There’s a lot of trouble in this community lol good luck playing legion and remember the most important thing is to have fun. Take every chance to learn how to improve your gameplay and don’t take the game too seriously.
---
That would be 4 people on the basement hooks. And even if not that, the killer would just see what you’re doing and never go to the basement. There’s a million ways this can go wrong. It just doesn’t fit the game at all.
---
You too, thanks!
---
That's an incredible cosplay holy shit.
---
Tunneling is a bit of a no go with most survivors usually spreading out the damage so everyone is DOH is your best bet, and ruin will make tunneling a lot less nessacary. Because the survivors will be looking for your totem instead of doing gens.
---
if u get this angry about a video game u probably should take stock of ur life
---
Eh. It would be kind of nice if they took away prayer beads. Also iri head too. I am a survivor main though...
---
Can you explain what you mean by this?
---
No counter play needed? Just play safe and focus on keeping s low profile
---
Also same argument vs MoM &gt; just run an instant down killer, you see how dumb that sounds?
---
 Hahaha that's cute
---
Noted. Thank you so much btw
---
baby dwights are a type of players that hide in lockers and baby megs are the one that use sprint burst to run away immediately as they hear the heart beat
---
It is not
---
It’s best to just turn off chat or set messages to friends only (depending what platform you’re playing on). This community is full of people who take the game very seriously and have nothing else in life but to get angry and be mean to others lol
---
Makes sense now that I think about it. Thank you!
---
Too early, he was still in the animation
---
I'm not disagreeing with you. I dont want to have to run ruin and bbq every game too. But if you're losing because you are not taking steps to counter the meta, the meta will counter you.
---
Nice.
---
Blocked.
---
No not really, please elaborate
---
Oh no problem man love seeing the community grow and people having fun!
---
I get angry about morons like you.
---
messing with mori’s shouldn’t be a priority right now when the game is in favor of the survivors.
---
Yeah even killermains say these are broken but BHVR is too busy jerking off and making new megskins.
---
Lol first time I saw a flashlight I just kind of though "wtf am I supposed to use this for? The maps aren't even that dark!"
---
Can you explain why you think the game is in favor of the survivors? That’s what I meant.
---
I thought you needed one for the basement... my teammate hooked there yelled at me for standing at the stairs doing nothing
---
Oh I see the issue now, If you come in at an angle on grabs it doesn't work, the same thing happens with fast vaults sometimes
---
also what builds do you go with? and what killer
---
A bit different, but HOME's also a pretty good one.
---
The unholy trinity
---
What are the odds of us actually getting a stranger things chapter?
---
Cold and dark from what I’ve heard...
---
I never tbag when I play survivor unless the killer shakes his no when he downs me or if he tunnels me the whole game and when I play killer I just hit the hooked the survivors if they were being toxic
---
Yeah you sound pretty triggered dude. I've never once stated that I have a superior taste to everybody, that's you projecting your strawman on me since you don't know how to argue against what I'm actually saying, but I can't blame you for failing at basic literacy. I'm not insinuating I'm a better person at all. Literally all I'm saying is that Stranger Things sucks, it fails on a preponderance of qualities that we collectively value in good story-telling and therefore I find it disappointing that BHVR is choosing to pander by using a fad series. This isn't the subjective experience of me describing my feelings on sitting through this show, it's much more matter of fact than that. I'm not saying I suddenly have a 500iq standard of quality just because I happen to correctly identify these things. But hey, if you failed at basic high school literature, I can see how you can make these sort of faults. It's not that I'm smart, it's that you're making stupid arguments. When you calm down and consider these assessments, you'll thank me later. You're welcome.
---
I don’t think he tried to kill Lucas. Judging by how *SPOILERS* Billy willingly sacrificed himself to save Eleven and the rest of the kids I like to think he was trying to scare Lucas and the rest away because he knew his father was abusive and would have killed Lucas.
---
I hate that. Personally I don't think it should matter what phase of the animation they are it. A pallet being dropped on you would surely do more damage while you're bent over...
---
Being blinded is not that big of a deal *at all*, and considering you can heal after only 30 seconds you'll barely notice it
---
LMAO
---
if we don't get steve i stg i'll riot
---
Couldn't he just grab Jeff then? Or isn't it possible to grab healing people?
---
lmao is your face cherry red literally 24/7 or what
---
What would the demigorgen (sorry for spelling I don’t watch the show) what would his perks be?
---
Rank 1 killers as well
---
Thanks! i’ll be postin more later ; )
---
The Entity mind flays Billy instead. A pretty weak way to do it but it'd work.
---
Pretty high with [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/crpnge/netflix_posts_three_random_pictures_of_stranger/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) in mind
---
I scared some children at the convention today
---
and is also not a blatant ripoff
---
What do you think I use it for Im afraid of the dark lol
---
No problem.
---
Sadly, it isn't. Jeff would have gotten away too.
---
Big oof if he wanted any hope of getting anyone he needed to stop the gen you walked past. He got real greedy.
---
Hybrid Panda made a video on it
---
Wallhacks
---
Yeah you're right from a business standpoint it would be a smart move given how popular the show is right now but hard to say
---
You can hear footsteps when she’s phasing with prayer beads.
---
It's text, admittedly in a very blurry and cursive font. Thought it suited the carter's notes add-ons,
---
Hes done stalking you. Now hes on the attack
---
🅱️ematic
---
Apparently, this game has memory leaks so I have to restart the game after a hour.
---
So the killer should never go after the unhooked and always go after the unhooked?
---
yeah you're right you should be able to be fucked with when you have literally no way to handle it great fucking idea
---
Yeah just happened to me today playing ghost face like 80% in the match a person who was dead on hook just walks right in front of me the days I was tunneling after I kill her.
---
*Survivors Dead Hard past you*
---
Seriously now, your cosplay looks REALLY good! The photo is so good too, menacing! Great job!
---
Try rebinding it sprint to something other than shift and see if it’s the keyboard or not
---
For me I occasionally get stuck im crouch, and i have push to crouch. I feel so stupid and always apologize to the killer afterwards, so he/she doesn't think I'm making fun of them.
---
My favorite time (usually only time) to tbag is when I'm facing a good killer, I pull a decent play on them and I know they're about to down me. Then it's just in good fun cuz they get their revenge. At the exit gate, I do my best to offer the killer free hits for bloodpoints, and to stall if other survivors need the time
---
Did we all get it wrong? That's Jeff!
---
1. I didn’t give my opinion on my preferences, the other guy did. 2. No one asked you to give your opinion on someone’s preferences. 3. Nice job winning an argument by calling me a subhuman.
---
Just give me Barb as a Survivor and I'll be content. It'd make the most sense since she died and some of the licensed characters are those who died in their franchises such as Amanda in Saw 3, Bill in Left 4 Dead. It's easier on continuities that way to say such and such were scooped up by the Entity after they died, or even disappeared.
---
Im not saying I have all the answers. But just entertain the idea. How do you think it could work?
---
Or better yet, 3 gens popped too fast, but you snowball the rest of the match and prevent the other two from ever going off, but you still safety pip because the first 3 were too quick.
---
WHY AM I NOT GETTING AN IRIDESCENT IN GATEKEEPING IF THE GATE NEVER GETS TOUCHED.
---
I play Legion, and the perks I have are limited to the standard killer perks so Discordance, Sloppy Butcher, Iron Maiden, and No One Escapes Death
---
If Steve isn't the survivor I'll keep playing but I'll be really disappointed
---
I don’t think the killers are overpowered (save for nurse, since she literally ignores the mechanics of the game, but this is something everything in the community acknowledges). The game is as balanced as it can be: it is an asymmetrical PVP. The killers are designed so they have the advantage (ability to aid in killing, higher movement speed, killer perks typically are 4x stronger than survivor perks, etc etc etc). Asymmetrical means that it will not be balanced so that both sides have an equal chance of winning based purely on the numbers in the game and the items/perks/abilities to use in game (it relies on RNG and actual playstyle to do well, but those other things can help). The game is also designed so that either side should not win every single time they play. Sometimes, you will lose. That doesn’t mean the game is imbalanced or survivor favored. RNG and other people’s skill (to an extent) determine that. It is also worth noting that most of the survivor perks don’t have any utility for serious gameplay, and most killer perks are incredibly useful. Just like any PVP game, it can be very difficult because you’re playing against real people. The design of the game, however, is in no way survivor favored. I’m a switch (meaning, I play survivor and killer equally, and I’m consistently at red ranks for both) and I’ve logged several hundred hours over several years in this game. Additionally, just by examining the numbers in the game, the design of characters and perks, the game is killer favored, as it should be. I’m sorry you’ve had bad experiences with the game. All that means is you need to practice more and learn more of how to play and counter things.
---
And what's the image equivalent of when you get run for 4 gens, get 1k, tbagged repeatedly and then cry about swf in the end game chat? Everyone's a big bad killer when they're on reddit 😂
---
I don’t want it to? I think it’s implausible and shouldn’t be looked into?
---
Oooh boy damn. That hurt me big time. Lol!! My wife actually was the one that wanted me to turn off my psn messaging because of how many immature people play this game. Which you are proving quote eloquently lol
---
Next chapter isnt original, sorry love.
---
didn't even burn your hand to make it accurate, smh
---
Thanks for explaining that to them, Toybasher.
---
Yup. I mostly play with friend's, so I rarely play killer. My rank does not equal my skill level. I try not to go too hard on rank 15s.
---
But sometimes one of them bms early. I like those games a lot.
---
Thought the exact same thing, was going to make a shit post about his p3 cosmetic in a scene where he had a bloody face but couldn’t be bothered
---
I was really hoping they would have made her arms "cosmetic" like a long sleeve shirt and made her ripped. I want Roid Rage Meg.
---
Was this on Xbox?
---
I don't get why camping is considered toxic. It's just using people's good nature and desire to help against them. Use the downed survivor as bait. You know, the way a demented killer would.
---
Someone else elaborated on what I meant in response to you. It's a subtle technique I guess you weren't aware of.
---
It's far stronger in many scenarios. And she was definitely close enough to crawl.
---
I killed everyone too fast and I got like no points and got 1 pip and then I got the longest game ever on got 2 pips and only killed like 3 people
---
De nada
---
Oh I get it now. Your wife is man of your relationship. Determines whether or not you can handle big boy words in ps4 messages. My mistake, don't tell her about this exchange. She might limit your reddit usage as well. 😢
---
dat happy butt wiggle.
---
If you unhook in front of me I’m going to hit whoever I can get. Not sorry.
---
Stun noise
---
Watch some videos too on YouTube on killer strategy and tips it helps. You can still do ok even without all the best perks while you’re leveling.
---
This is really cool.
---
me and my buddy are toxic to each other when we load up in SWF, so technically true I guess lol
---
Hey I got it too last night! What was your last one?
---
I actually wish for killers which lore is based on discrimination. Racists or homophobic men for example
---
Franklins=struggle
---
What a lovely pig for not taking the kill and helping them out. Legend.
---
Already stated he's fine as a killer
---
Any channels/videos in particular that you recommend? Thank you btw
---
This cosplay honestly creeped me out well done
---
I also love it when the survivor with the red ping reports me for lagswitching. Good times.
---
Dead by daylight pops sounds like a good idea.

*Purr sounds intensify*
---
Thank you! ^ ^
---
Really good character and good perks (I think that Stay safe should last something like 10/15/20 seconds though, Alternative Use seems like such an interesting perk!) Great job!
---
No Mori?
---
Having double instaheal for end game would be ludicrous, you already have every other killer running noed because of adrenaline
---
MoM was more overpowered moron. It was a perk that could be run on every single survivor 100% of the time in every single game vs (once again) one single consumable add on only useable by one killer. Why are you not bitching about huntress’s, hers is stronger?
---
I agree, BM is a legitimate tactic, annoying the opponent to try and frustrate them so they make more mistakes is fine as long as there’s someone else left to help escape or sacrifice, the only time it’s toxic is if the games actually over. 
---
Like hit me on the hook or do the mori spam if you want but why bother slapping when the entity pops out the ground after EGC?
---
I thought it was his loud running.
---
Those are terrible survivors I don’t see your point whatsoever and my opinions should have nothing to do with me being a mod lol
---
Eh lots of tier 3 teachable perks and seasonal items. They were probably get rusty after a break that lasted a couple rank resets
---
Instant karma
---
It is in general said that the best killers are the Nurse and the Hillbilly tho, both for free.
---
*grrrrRR* **RRRAAAHHHHHH!**
---
Maybe make it so you have to hit the head, but if it misses it just stays on the ground?
---
"lockers exist" ok then dont take them out of it?
---

---
*blows the dust off of my ipad* it’s finally happening
---
Ya I do see your point. I just honestly don’t like doing it myself cause it’s not his fault he got farmed by a jackass so I try not to unless I have no choice. I usally like going after the healthy one because that one person is going to take awhile to heal and waste time.
---
What if you had to aim at them?
---
And yet we haven't reached a point where you admit to the fact that you were being an asshole and decided to lie about it by pretending you were *just stating facts*.
---
You told people they didn't know anything and tried to make them feel stupid despite not knowing them. Unprovoked at that. At least I was calling out a dick. 
---
Even more sad is the fact is that I copied the structure of your comment down to the letter and it pissed you off. Funny huh? If I acted like you, and you think you weren't rude, how come you took offense when I did it? 
---
Meanwhile, being called mentally handicapped isn't an insult. Do you take offense when someone points out when you have a broken arm? Both are disabilities, but the way you react to one or the other says a lot about you as a person.
---
Oh sorry I didn't know
---
I’m no doctor main, but I am a Feng main so that’s gotta count for something

Really close to getting all the perk slots open on my favorite killer atm (billy)
---
 no i mean mid-heal, it doesn’t work for me when i do that

I’ve watched it whsn my sister has watched it before and it’s not anywhere close to similar to Dead by Daylight. It’s like saying Jason or Chucky would make sense. Chucky if in the game wouldn’t be able to have a power and Jason would have basically no power at all. The licensed characters we have right now actually make sense in this game. DBD should just stick to original characters right now no matter what they decide to do.
---
Yeah mid heal too. Literally run away and it should stop the heal.
---
She’s so adorable
---
Already ugly like that won’t make myself worst
---
I was going to say Rank 20 but I forgot the whole not depipping thing above 15 anymore.
---
I wouldn't worry about it, dude. It takes a while to get out of the cycle of pip/depip, but honestly, once you're past that you'll be able to climb to purple ranks easy.
---
it doesn’t seem to work for me, maybe i’ll try it again
---
What's with the monitor resolution?
---
I was replying to the suggested "counterplay" of slug them. DS shouldn't work on grabs like BT.
---
She did tbag, she did it a couple times as she was running. Then again within the gates before the other guy attempted to heal. Killers certainly are babies when it comes to teabagging, but you'd have to be blind or in denial to miss her multiple tbags.
---
Yep! Everything will stutter like crazy. Interacting with the UI becomes unbearable.
---
Was this at Fan Expo? I thought I saw someone dressed as the pig walking around
---
Ahahah I wasn't aware of that.  Depending on how they said it, it could've been a "we'll *never* make a clown killer ;););)" kinda deal, maybe?
---
First look? People have been playing mobile for a while now.
---
jUsT cLeAnSe ToTeMs
---
But in order to get the hatch you must complete generators otherwise the key becomes irrelevant. Killers can kill the person with said key. Also the perk Franklin's Demise is your best friend in this type of situation.
---
Isn’t Frank generally evil?
---
Firstly, the 80% stat was due to the way ranking works - their stats were taken post-game, after rank changes, and if you die in a game as survivor at rank one you’re nearly guaranteed a pip down unless you played super well, meaning that most of the deaths were lumped into rank two. 
---
Secondly, those stats were from before EGC was implemented and these are from after. Do you think that EGC has had absolutely no effect on survival rates?
---
ye
---
No, I just want to be unfun against you
---
finally played killer for the first time after maining survivor and this is exactly the matchup I got it was a nightmare.
---
yes but it does not spam the button instead of you...
---
I also had no idea what it was for for the longest time.
---
maybe, Frank, but the others were most likely preasurred/manipulated by him
---
I can see The Spirit and Wraith, but im not sure about Huntress😂Legion is a 50/50 for me
---
Had this happen several times last night to the point I was wanting to run Kindred. Thanks rank reset! Now it'll take me forever to get out of the potato ranks since I have no friends and play solo.
---
Jack Stauber?
---
*ah, I see you’re a man of culture as well.*
---
no
---
I don’t know about Myers but could see Freddy attempt a Coup d’etat
---
I'm one of the survivors from the match! sorry about the toxicity we were mostly just memein and having fun.  
---
I'm glad you took a moment to point out that this mechanic really needs to be fixed.  
---
gg tho friend, see you in the fog, uwu &lt;3
---
glad I wasn't the only person who thought about this lmao
---
Probably Michael myers. Straight up badass that everyone and their mom is afraid of. Or perhaps a killer with a little more humanity. Someone who might at least be tempted to say "maybe going around hanging people on meat hooks to sacrifice them to a evil shadow monster is a little fucked" I don't who that would be tho. Pig maybe? I dunno
---
Freddy is really only there for Quentin since the survivors are prob all going to lose hope sooner or later Quentin will be no more and I doubt the entity would let Freddy go free so I can see Freddy just say fuck you man and try to escape
---
If you got a 4K I’d say you did everything right
---
I think the answer to both is obviously he has no idea and just guesses.
---
Well have fun :D
---
Frienly reminder to cleanse dull totems before powering the gates.
---
I feel like of all the Killers we have right now, The Spirit is probably the most brutal and sadistic introduction to the game for new players.
---
I remember even when she first came out, I had NO idea what to do with her. I died so many times, and I even had like 400 hours logged at the time of her release.
---
Poor Nea’s.
---
I use broken keys into tricking the killer im actually using a key and make them waste a perk slot for franklin's
---
Im aware of that ty
---
Aww, did somebody get offended over a meme?
---
No I don’t think you can
---
You're welcome
---
Ah sorry I misunderstood. Not sure, might be a third party program.
---
Never underestimate the power of confirmation bias.
---
I’m confused what did she do that was toxic?
---
Probably Huntress. I think, along with her not being evil, has the only perk with lore descriptions indicating she can temporarily break free from the Entity's control.
---
No you shouldn't, because everybody runs Borrowed Time. So you'll have to hit twice anyway and by downing the healthy one, the other have to heal, so you will gain more time.
---
There are addons that make the shock go farther, also you shock them to get them into higher tier madness once theyre in tier 3 they get harder skill checks on gens and healing, visions of you appear so you can see where they are also they cant pull down pallets in tier three or fix gens in tier 3. Doctors not the best killer by any means but he can be fun to play. Also once you shock them into tier three they will keep screaming so you can find them very fast.
---
Idk about legal, but the devs have previously said they don’t want any child characters in their games. I imagine all survivors would have to be 16-18 years+
---
There are certain add-ons that allow it to be more of a projectile like aim or a cone
---
Freddy, mount Ormond?
---
uWu
---
You cannot if I would mention there are range extension add ons and using distressing is nice on doctor.
---
Hackers deserve to get facecamped
---
Unfortunate that you can't go too ham some games.
---
At rank 18 and pretty much only do killer dailies.
---
But last night played pig with one basic perk of hers and mollywopped the lobby. Didn't get a single pip and I was purposely trying to avoid hooked survivors.
---
I never looked at her perk descriptions, but I know her bio claims her as an independent person
---
Define 'turn on' please.
---
Nah, it's hard enough bringing a key into the match without being the first to die. Let alone finding one in a match and having a chance to use it.
---
I always upvote your stuff before even reading it :)
---
Yeah then the next step is to post a video where you get t-bagged at the exit gates after a super toxic game where you camped, tunneled and instantly moried survivors that maybe just wanted to have some fun with a couple of friends and write "FuKiNg ToXiC sWf!".
---
Jesus😂Betray the entity
---
Awww come here, I wanna hug you😘😘😘
---
Cool.
---
I happen to be a person who has a similar rank/loadout for my killers, and I'll tell you how it happened:  
---
I spend 99% of my time playing survivor but sometimes I put points into killers.  For example, I have BBQ and ruin on myers and I've only ever played as him twice.
---
My reasoning is that if I'm going to play a new character, I don't want them to be super weak with only 1 starting perk.
---
THE BEST
---
Oh. Probably myers.
---
What?
---
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
---
So true it hurts :(
---
🖤🐽🖤
---
Sure!✋🏻✋🏻✋🏻
---
I do this but without the sprint burst
---
This kids is called Karma
---
Yea I guess it was my bad but I tried to let him go and heal. I’m talking about if I was right or wrong when he called me out on camping and tunneling the -whole- game
---
This is a typical day in DBD ....
---
Why go for a healthy survivor who’s probably more annoying when you can use drop and toss the weaker one on the hook and get that sweet sacrifice
---
Thank you for the encouragement :)
---
Me but Adiris &lt;3
---
And punishes a lot of players who probably don't really have it coming in the process.
---
Definitely the most beautiful female character in DBD &lt;3
---
They'd probably have to get permission from whoever to do and the devs are...occupied.
---
And then you get the exposed status
---
Perfect lighting there
---
always thought the scariest thing about the pig abduction scenes was the lighting.
---
you really nailed the lighting in this shot. nice work.
---
At higher ranks they will likely have BT and DS so it’s not smart going after the same person right off the hook
---
He probably saw you but preferred to expose Claudette instead of losing his power by hitting you
---
In before its just some cosmetics coming to dbd
---
I played against a swf group with all instaheals and thick mist offerings, didn't expect it to go well.  But it was the most fun I've ever had playing myers and I got my best ever match score. It reminded me to not stress out so much and just have fun!
---
no one needs your micropenis to make this stupid conversation even more pathetic. you're too busy sucking yourself off to consider additive commentary to your initial arguments. git gud, inbred
---
Such a lie.
---
Damn I did the same but was Freddy lol
---
Barb getting robbed again I see
---
It’s been done before and has failed every time. No one plays that discord game where it’s literally “kill the killer or be killed, can also escape.” No one plays F13 anymore. No one plays the game where 2 people in a group are infected and have to collect blood bags to transform and kill the survivors. It’s always failed and for good reason. The requirements to kill the killers is always super ridiculous and unrealistic,
---
A possible Devour Hope gives me more shits than Haunted Grounds
---
It’s from the movie where he has newspaper clippings all over the wall and watches his tv recordings
---
One thing I've suggested for a while is that there is a "minimum rank gain" based on kills. 
---
0 or 1 kill, worst case is you lose a pip.
---
2 kills, worst case is you safety
---
3-4 kills, worst case you gain 1 pip 
---
This way, if you end a game in 5 minutes and kill all 4, you won't lose a pip or safety. Keep in mind this is worst case. You could still pip if you get 0 kills. You can still gain 2 pips for 2-4 kills. But these are the minimum gains you can get. This way killers that are meant to end chases quickly like Myers are not penalized because of it. 
---
Lemme know what you all think of this. I'm always open for discussion.
---
ST is more of a thriller and DBD is more of an action horror. If Stranger Things WAS in the game it would most likely only have a survivor or if there was a killer it wouldn’t be designed well.
---
Susie seems like the only genuinely good one there, Julie somewhat sides with frank
---
It's kinda petty, but if my team let's me get to second phase on my first hook when the killer isn't camping me or I'm not even in the basement, I don't even bother struggling unless there's 3+ gens done.
---
That mask looks official though.
---
Freddy probably stands the best chance out of all the killers, he's a dream demon and exist in the dream world, his domain
---
✋✋✋✋
---
Fun fact use your eyes and look at her when she was next to the entity's escape barrier. She was tbagging the whole time till he hit her
---
Thank you! 🥰
---
This. After having been uncooked in front of the killer multiple times, it's just not fun playing anymore.
---
I'd rather lose a K than make the game unfun .
---
Every time I think I chosen a new main I come back to Doctor and I still love him. Love the comic and here's that high five 🖐️
---
Freddy, should he ever decide he doesn't like working under the Entity anymore for whatever reason, or feels like he's not getting enough out of the deal.
---
Amazing cosplay! Where'd you get the longcoat if you don't mind me asking?
---
Sympathy, not excuses
---
Those were the exact same thing
---
Just don’t follow me
---
Wow the weapon is really accurate. Looks good.
---
Thanks my friend! ⚡️⚡️⚡️
---
Legion is the worst by a pretty big gap
---
He’s bad but he’s not as bad as leatherface
---
Hahaha let me guess, endgame chat he was apologizing for the bad internet connection? Lmao
---
I play pig and use noed. I slow down the games as much as possible. And if they didn't do totems, it punishes them, and if they did totems, it punished them by slowing gens more than my traps already did. And I get tons of salt nearly every game from noed and I could not care less. Everyon has opinions. I don't care what perks survivors use, DS, toolboxes with faster repair upgrades, squadettes, etc. So I don't care what I take to win.
---
Legion is the worst.
---
If we ever had multiple killers vs. survivors (not that we will), it would be cool to have levels where survivors and killers could take elevators and go between floors.
---
Saw your comment earlier today. Learned something new. Then about 40 minutes later I was at the exit gate and my teammate got knocked down. I did this exact thing (healing him) to force killer to hit me, and that extra 2 seconds was literally JUST enough to give us both time to crawl out.
---
So not only did you teach me something, but you also saved someones life.
---
Meanwhile Rank 13 Killer going against Toxic swf all red ranks
---
I hope you sent a report in
---
Ban Morris. You heard it here first.
---
Nice job :) must have taken a while.
---
Nice, I got that two days ago too! Never really focused on it until I realized how close I was.
---
Ain't that some low effort cropping lmao
---
I bet you're one of the people who said ghostface would never come
---
Unless he brings the motha fuckin time!
---
I have never understood the t-bagging. I main survivor because I get so much anxiety playing killer. This is why I feel so much respect towards a skilled killer.
---
Leave if you want I'll still have my key. IDGAF. You're only hurting yourself.
---
3 days exactly and thank you ^_^
---
2v8 would be really fun. Imagine the combo teams between killers and their powers.
---
Id take any Jason at this point, the power seems interesting except maybe the teleport maybe if he had specific locations to port too like corners of the map
---
I did :)
---
Wait I would be running towards her, correct
---
Season one she is 16 but in season 3 she is 18 years old so I don’t know whether they would allow it or not
---
I would never
---
I was promised the muscular meg of my gay dreams. What did I get? A skinny white girl with cornrows.
---
I usually hit em when they bag me constantly
---
Then i just bag at exit gates only cuz game ending
---
I dont bag anywhere else unless the killer is just kinda doin nothing
---
Huntress is pretty much just a mentally disabled Child. she doesnt know whats right and wrong.
---
Ye, Depends who you Talk about on Legion
---
Also its 150 + 180. 
---
P0-50, P1-50,P2-50,P3-Max
---
Thats 330 bloodwebs total. Times 45k avg = 14.85
---
Just point. It’ll cancel the healing and you can leave....
---
I think the worst contender is when it gives you a prompt to try escaping a hook, with you most likely not knowing that you have a very very slim chance of actually escaping and you're really just killing yourself faster.
---
I rehope it's Steve but it'll probably be Hopper. That's still great but Steve would be so much better.
---
If they use her from season 3 then it would most likely be fine
---
Ok buddy
---
As someone who loves trapper, its so hilarious
---
Act like ya pp big then gettin doinked is funny to watch
---
Just google it, preferably on your work computer.
---
Thanks :) I’m making a new one later on but I won’t do commissions of her :3
---
Probably but I think 17 would maybe be okay but at sixteen they would definitely draw the line
---
Mama ‘Manda’s on her way!🐽
---
I kinda really like it except it’s very killer sided because of the detection element
---
I did say this is what these things mean to me when I see them. You don't have to agree. You re interpretation of things is obviously different than mine.
---
It's even funnier when there is no other hex perk in play but Haunted Grounds.
---
[None of the addons mention time to blind though, some extend the time of the blind but none make it quicker. Only the flashlights themselves do that IIRC](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Flashlights#Add-ons)
---
Hag, Freddy and Spirit.
---
Oh?
---
Just sounds very obvious you are a killer main is all
---
Doctor is great. In terms of the shock range being pathetic the devs said they want to rework the Doctor's addons, it is very likely the moldy electrode will become base kit, since without the electrode the zap is like puny T-Rex arms, but with it it feels like how it ought to be from the beginning.
---
Interview Tape and High Stim electrode gives you an insanely large beam. 
---
My main madness source is the passive insanity AOE tied to terror radius in treatment mode. Doc is one of the few killers (besides maybe Legion or Infectious Fright Nurse/Myers) where you want as massive as a terror radius as possible and because of this he benefits strongly and synergizes will with "Terror Radius Perks" like Infectious Fright, Overwhelming Presence, Coulrophobia, Unnerving Presence, etc. 
---
My go to Doc build is Distressing, Unnerving, Overcharge, and a fourth perk. (I use BBQ) Often with double calm addons for a larger treatment mode terror radius and a Jigsaw Piece offering. AKA the 3-gen build.
---
[A decent Doctor guide which seems pretty solid coming from a former Doc main](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anboxRtPPZE) as it covers perk builds, addon combos, playstyle, etc.
---
In terms of madness Doctor is similar to Old Freddy where he is good at stalling and tracking. I always try to zap people into madness 3 before downing them so they waste time snapping out of it when they are unhooked. A 3-genning doctor is nearly unbeatable if survivors are not coordinated.
---
I'm not. I play red ranks in both survivor and killer.
---
I think a better comparison would be noed to decisive strike. Adrenaline has an effect different to noed.
---
All three perks are bad for game health in my opinion.
---
THATS A GREAT SONG!!!!! I love Jack Stauber :)
---
Just bought a nice pair of headphones the other day ;) Didn't think about coffee though, good idea!
---
Laughing at the thought of Bill Just fucking yeetin' a toolbox at Myers.
---
Plague because she’s the most innocent
---
Holy crap that mask and weapon look amazing!
---
Best tips I could give? Become so stupid they can't mind game you. It works for me at least. Double backing? Nah ,triple backing is for me. I think it may not work on you ,but it works on me
---
whats the name of the song that plays? ive been looking for it forever, funny video btw and unfortunate for the Claudette
---
Special delivery today! Nagh!
---
AdReNaLiNe Is NoT cOmPaRaBlE tO nOeD
---
Deadass though, Im glad to see im not the only one that thinks the doctor is A1, I got the game a couple weeks ago and when I saw the DLC for him he was the first thing I bought, everything about him is FUCKING DOPE. The vibe of like super smart people turned evil / insane and are serial killers is the FUCKING BEST, AND PALLET DENYING PEOPLE, and idk, Doctor is best man
---
Thanks! :D Hopefully the drill will look even better in the future when I actually make it spin! This is just a prototype test so far :3
---
I just hit on hook when I'm bored
---
So use the right tag next time you make a shit post then.
---
Yeah, i've had a couple of fun games after using one of the electrode add-ons, his laugh after shocking someone is pretty satisfying too.
---
I'll continue playing him.
---
Rooooger dodger
---
THIS COMMENT IS MY EVERYTHING
---
I would totally be into this. Especially if it could include the various objectives for trophies, achievements, etc. I play on PS4 and I’ve always wished I could see my progress on those as I’m working toward them.
---
I suggested that jane’s grunts should be nerfed.
---
God this subreddit is so toxic
---
Noob3? He's been banned for cheating and toxic behaviour before.
---
Presences are pointless. If ya got em, i'd recommend distressing, ruin, enduring or brutal, then whatever you'd like last slot
---
Ruin is ruin, doc can eat pallets quite a bit, distressing for radius increase, last slot could be whatever ya like
---
 Bbq, save the best for last, haunted grounds are perks i'd use, but its whatever ya want
---
I found out that people don't actually respect baby Dwights. I went disguised as one and kept getting killed
---
Steve as Survivor.
---
Flayed Billy as Killer
---
I'm so glad someone agrees &lt;3
---
NOED ,at least for me ,could be reworked to the point it isn't such a crutch for (me) people that can't protect gens.
---
Smurf account with three friends, absolutely despicable.
---
ROFL, mentally ill boy can't handle not being toxic.
---
What if the stun didn't make them drop the survivor they were carrying?
---
60 total, with 3 tiers each. Good luck, you're gonna have to go through 174 bloodwebs total
---
I don't use Adrenaline so I'll bitch about NOED as much as I please, thank you very much.
---
Well,it is your fault for not cleansing totems
---
Even as a Killer it pains me to watch this
---
Edward Maya - Stereo Love (I believe)
---
Feels sad man
---
I heard tell of Sniper doc the other day, and I ended up losing 1 survivor or two because I was just fucking with the range, like I was actually crying from laughing at how goofy it is, 100% the most fun I've had in a while
---
Amazingly done absolutely love it
---
Decisive Strike is good for game health. It could do with a slight nerf (I like the one where if another survivor is hooked while its active, it deactivates the perk for the unhooked survivor.)
---
Amazing!
---
Who are you to defend gay people like me who give absolutely no shits about a word having multiple meanings? I call stuff gay all the time. It's definitely not and never will be a way to insult gay people. It's just a word that has multiple meanings. It used to mean happy.
---
Fun!!! Time to grind I guess.
---
All killers have powers that must be learned. In order to get better at killer you have to play both roles. Playing as killer will allow you to understand what tactic is bad and what is good, and playing as survivor will give you information about how to play the killer you're facing. For example:
---
-Trapper, the very first killer, he's good in area denial. He can block windows and pallets to make them a death sentence. Trapper must learn two things: Where to put the traps and when to put traps. Playing as killer will give you a chance to see how the survivors are gonna react to your placements and playstyle. Playing against a (good) trapper give you information about trap spots and helps you read his movements as well as his moment to go set other traps or go apply pressure on generators. 
---
I only did trapper because he's the basic killer, I can help you on other killers as well. Just tell me your favorite killer and I'll try to give you some tips.
---
I now sexually identify as 69¢
---
in pennies
---
I’m sure it will happen eventually given that they seem to want their game on practically all platforms
---
This is a hilarious tip! However, I regret to inform I am that stupid. I don’t know any of the mind games, ergo cannot become immune.
---
Could be smurf account, could be matchmaking being terrible
---
For me, i base it off of a few things
---
1. Who can i find
---
2. If both are near eachother, if i can hit both, i hit injured first if i know i can hit the other guy
---
3. If i cant/hes body blocking, smack em, then go for the easier target
---
An injured survivor is less likely to do gens
---
More pressure is good
---
Also to note, if i know they got borrowed, smack em first no matter what, survivors gotta waste more time mending
---
Qed DC nnn
---
Welcome to this week's episode of "You Should Have Just Left" starring Claudette and Billy!
---
Thank you so much, my friend ♥️♥️♥️
---
You have to aim a flashlight too, and people can blind your face very consistently with those
---
Gen jocky boi. Let's be totally toxic and rush those gens.
---
Trapper was absolutely my go-to, and probably who I plan to main if I can get past cringing at myself, lol. I feel like I’ve played against good trappers, but focusing on how they play and trying to survive at the same time has proven difficult. 
---
However, I didn’t think about putting the traps at palettes, that’s extremely clever. I heard to put them near generators, and at windows, I think. 
---
Do you have tips on the when? And how to even really hit people? I think I missed every single time I tried to hit someone, I don’t know how some killers are so good at knowing how to hit.
---
Well, the "main" thing is usually when you have most fun while using something, some people like running, others prefer the murdering
---
Sophomore is most likely sixteen, her skin is called sophomore jitters, but the devs aged her up for the reasons you stated above
---
Inviaible wraith should just be an empty box
---
I’d have said, “Yo moms a hoe.” Just me tho
---
Fall damage is a conspiracy of the government to make us not jump from planes ofc
---
:( Always needing saved.
---
Sure but I don’t think he knew about the healing thing also it depends where he started healing her, in addition I was just talking about after clown picked up Nea
---
Ouch. To true...🤣
---
Sophomore is most likely sixteen, her skin is called sophomore jitters, and they aged her up in case that any adult imagery was created of her
---
I’m extremely bad at surv and I don’t find it fun I don’t like depending on my team
---
I favour killer because of it being purely solo gameplay, I win or lose purely by my own skill 
---
With survivor I have to count on randoms to be able to finish gens or I have to evade the killer long enough to escape via hatch, problem is i can’t let everyone die and be fine with it, unless they tried to screw me over anyway
---
I get having opinions about what's more fun but surely people aren't so obsessed with playing one side that they just never touch the other side.
---
Freddy is THICC
---
Adrenaline only heals one health state and provides a speed boost at the cost if exhaustion while NOED can immediately instadown (2 health states) and increases speed and is active as long as it's up. They aren't one in the same.
---
Use headphones.
---
Put it this way:
---
30 hours in DBD is the equivalent of firing one bullet in the tutorial of a CoD game.
---
You are nowhere. 30 hours in and you only have a handful of perks on a couple of characters.
---
It usually takes a couple HUNDRED hours to reliably hit rank 1.
---
That's happened to me before, but on PC lol
---
I laughed way too much at this, thanks, ahahah!
---
Your assumption is correct it’s as useful as no mither self care

I think we found the survivor main
---
Well that's the problem, i myself like playing surv but somedays i play killer, playing too much of one side makes you forget what the other has to go through
---
Don’t exactly think that you fit in the non-toxic category
---
I play both but I slightly prefer killer because I don’t have to deal with stupid teammatesk
---
I’d buy it
---
I main survivor 70/30 basically and only really do killer for BP farming when I want to or just when I feel like it. It’s just more fun imo sure some parts are agrivating such as bad teammates at times but when everything goes right it just feels all the better. I don’t do swf
---
What? You're not the first, but I really do hope this time you're the last. Mm has always been a mid tier killer. Probably mid-low with the introduction of other killers.
---

---
Like [This?](https://imgur.com/a/NjUC7ig)
---
 If so, there it is: https://dbd.onteh.net.au/leaderboard/
---
That doesn’t sound too far off the game works by using the entire team and the killers average number and then going down or up 2 ranks from that.  For example if you’re 7 and they’re all 4 or 3 it’s still okay. But 20 and 5s wouldn’t make sense. It’s complicated lol
---
Can I be the unnamed table mid left: totem cleanser? That’s me. Hi, hello. NOED who?
---
I don't see a "fuck i forgot i have a team" table
---
Everyone had this match at least once. No exceptions
---
Someone just learned the word cynical and is looking for places to use it.
---
He's just too op dude. He just one stabs you and that's it. If survivors were bunched up together they were instantly fucked. He's just too op to even be in the game. And soon enough everyone will be using him and the game just won't be fun anymore.
---
I'm about to stab you, heretic
---
Exactly. I feel like if more people were like you and didn t let themselves forget what the other side has to go through this community would be much more knowledgeable and a much less argumentative.
---
Oh Hi Trick
---
Thank god you got them before they could prestige and become truly immersed.
---
I used to play solely survivor, purely just because I enjoyed the gameplay a lot more. I prefer working as a team, and it also feels more exciting in a way to be the 'hunted'. 
---
That being said, after awhile I started to finally play killer, and I do enjoy it a lot, it offers a unique style of play and it's fun to be the one mostly in control of the game.
---
I still prefer survivor though because when I play killer I have to focus so intently on what I'm doing, and have to try so hard not to make any mistakes, whereas as survivor it doesn't matter as much since you have other teammates who are (hopefully) doing the objectives and helping you out. But yeah I play them half and half now mostly and it does help to realise whether things are annoying or not on either receiving end.
---
TIL
---
I rarely ever use flashlights :( I can never get the timing down
---
is there any other way to get more than 1 sacrifice as pig?
---
Wait until you play the game more and find out about billy lmao
---
Myers is not mid-low.
---
He’s A tier imo. Strong power. Low terror radius. Great add ons. Only 16m terror radius. I’m pretty sure he’s the most played killer in purple ranks according to the devs.
---
Super basic tips! 
---
Holding the attack button makes you do a lunge attack. This gives more reach but has a large cooldown if you miss. The lunge should be your main attack for most killers. 
---
Patrolling the gens. If you can't find anyone or it is near the beginning of a game go and look at the generators around the map. They are probably doing some the furthest away or pretty close to that. 
---
Learn how to understand and follow scratch marks. When a survivor runs you see the orange scratches in a messy trail. Learn where these tracks lead and where survivors are going to hide. 
---
Dont be a moth! Moths love flashlights, however you do not. Look up and keep walking if they have a flashlight. 
---
You're gonna have a bad first few rounds because matchmaking is trash. Just keep trying, learn, and do your best. Try both playing survivor to learn what they see and how they play against you.
---
How well killer games go relies almost entirely on you, but survivor games rely on your team unless you can loop very well
---
They were all prestige
---
I try not to be toxic at all. The game is more fun for us all that way.
---
Yea I played this game long enough for Billy aswell. And he's kinda op but if you have spring burst or dead hard your good.
---
jack as the killer would be awesome 'you didnt let me finish, i said im not gonna kill ya...im just gonna bash your brains in'
---
Yeah I meant the hit box for head on actually working on the killer I’ve been spectating my friend using it quite a few times where it looks like it’s gonna work but it doesn’t.
---
It's a macro. Keyboard software like razor have it, which the game usually doesn't pick up, but it's still a 3th party software that can get you banned
---
It’s fun to play killer when you go up against similar level survivors, it’s the worst when you go against tryhards that loop you near perfect and gen rush, I usually dc against them
---
They both have extreme high skill ceiling
---
Omg yes 😂
---
I dont tunnel, and i dont need to. DS has a 60 second timer, which is longer than youd think
---
Sometimes I do all the gens alone or I loop the killer half of the match.
---
huff d-daddy dont get me worked up
---
Survivor definitely isn't as smooth as it should be. I think it's the optimization honestly
---
Playing huntress
---
Still bad FPS in general, doesn't even feel like 30 tbh
---
The boys are back in town!
---
Yes I did
---
yikes
---
huh?
---
You get worse frames what console do you have?
---
Who in the right mind wouldn't buy it?
---
Other way round. Julie was the crazy girl who joined Frank first, Susie was her shy friend
---
My last game, I had an Ace point me out to the killer while i was halfway done with the last gen.  It's awesome playing survivor /s
---
Not really getting upset, just saying it's something important to keep in mind. By using a certain kind of language in a casual setting you normalize it for yourself. I knew many people who would use rape as a passing phrase when pkaying with their friends and know that desensitized all of us to it. At one point one (now ex-friend) even started looking at women in passing and comfortably saying "Ya I'd rape her" to us, fully just thinking it was a compliment to her. We were just as bad for not calling it out, and so I just try to call things like that out when I see them now.
---
You make a valid point
---
I'm pretty sure it's part of the grafitti artist outfit.
---
Its just a backpack full of spray paint thats about it
---
DC'ing as killer is the worst
---
While I don't know if I'd enjoy it, I would definitely want to at least try it to see
---
Could be true. I just made this post because I love this game. This community is cool too. 
---
I posted this because we have all encountered toxicity in this game. In case one of the four lurks here, I want them to know how thrilling it was for me to hook them all. They know they are, and the salty Xbox messages made me laugh.
---
They don't care if you use a macro many streamers use one and have for years.
---
You realise they want you to tunnel them, right? Literally baited.
---
Let me just search up a good seat at Chest Searchers
---
Lol wut that's funny. I understand how a group of solo queue players can get crushed with miscommunication and nobody doing gens but a swf should have 3 or 4 gens done on the first hook of a facecamping Bubba.
---
What if I said this happened to me once..?
---
have you ever been a killer and got "outplayed" by a key
---
That would be cool, but it would result in certain survivors and killers being considered meta instead of perks. Ace would be unused, and most people would pick Claudette, Nea, Meg, or possibly David for the perks they consider "essential." Although, to be fair that sounds like the current game anyway. 😂 Killers might be less effected, although you'd probably see more Hags than in the original game mode, cause everybody loves Ruin. Plus you wouldn't be able to use BBQ &amp; Chili on anybody but Bubba (sounds like a paradise for survivor mains 😂)
---
I wasn't meaning to imply that. Sorry if my comment gave off that vibe. I just thought it's dumb to assume that people are homophobic when they use gay to describe something dumb.
---
Plague sure was anti-vax kid
---
A wraith perk called predator helps make them more "readable" but other than that it's just practice.  Another perk that helps keep track of survivors, but isn't the best is bloodhound. It is in the shop currently and makes it impossible for you to not see blood from hurt survivors.
---
I did too, you’re not alone!
---
As survivor, she uses No Mither, OoO, WGLF, and Up the Ante. Equips a broken key without addons. All on Death Metal Jeff no less. She unhooks herself or doesn't get unhooked at all. 
---
As killer, she plays Speed Limiter Bubba without perks. Double pip 4K's every game. 
---
When she's feeling up to a challenge, she runs Burgerking Backpacker Myers. Judith's Tombstone, Scratched Mirror for addons. For perks, she runs Agitation, Iron Grasp, Mad Grit, and an empty perk slot. 
---
As survivor, she doesn't believe the game is challenging unless the killer burns a mori.
---
As killer, she burns a Haddonfield offering every single game.
---
God I love Nuclear Throne but I can’t imagine the amount of code fuckery behind the scenes.
---
Always needs to be saved. No joke, I played an entire night of matches with Borrowed Time and Deliverance, and always get first hooked.
---
Actually made me laugh at how utterly useless I am though (it's okay, I play for fun).
---
Same here, I had a lagging Michael with tombstone and tuft of hair one game
---
I'm the guy that DC'd and that match was hilarious. It was a good game man. You did nothing wrong. &lt;3 We're just idiots playing a game too. xD That edit was fucking sweet. I'm so happy you went through the trouble to make something so cool off of such a meme game. &lt;3 You're actually a fuckin' rock star and I love you.
---
Kk
---
This tutorial is literally the same as the console and pc
---
I know we can't get Jason because there's a lawsuit going on, but damn wouldn't it be cool if we got Jason for the 13th Chapter? 
---
Still tho, seeing this photo makes me sad. These three guys are iconic characters and we already have two of them in DBD. Only Jason is missing.
---
I play both, highly depends on the day. But survivor feels like a thriller while killer feels like I'm in charge of a daycare
---
Yours isn't an opinion
---
(it's a reference)
---
Not as a survivor, no
---
Looks like a college bag tbh. One full of spray paint.
---
Doc looks so cleeean god damn
---
Adrelanine, decisive, dead hard, self care
---
the principals office
---
Got facecamped today by a Nurse (I mean, really?), just stood next to me for minutes (I was the first to get hooked). 4 gens got done in that time though, so while I did die, pretty sure she lost the game after. Not sure how that was worth it to the killer, but sure, why not.
---
Queue the killer denying all claims while their mom in the background is yelling at him to stop playing his Nintendo because she wants to use the phone
---
It's Grind-n-Save season again.
---
Yea his saw mechanic can be shitty. I’d still rather play LF than legion though. I’m not a fan of his mechanic at all.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she was
---
Eh you don't get chased and caught by a trap. It's somewhat different.
---
I have so much difficulty distinguishing between assholes who are trying to bait me into a chase and honest-to-god newbies who are just crouching in the open for no reason.
---
"Oh yeah? Let's see what you've got MEG."  
---
"Oh, rank 19. SHIT. SORRY."
---
He could only hide in so many lockers before he finally became one, now he seeks to trap the other survivors that he once called friends. Locker Dwight confirmed for new killer
---
*sad piggy noises*
---
&gt;didn't get triggered
---
Posts a thread with a "rant" flair on Reddit after the game
---
Please do, love it! Oink oink!
---
It's all Ogre now....
---
Rin &lt;3
---
everytime someone does this i make sure they dont get out
---
The key is visible in a survivor's hand?
---
"I did not sign for that"
---
"screw this tier list, you are the best for me"
---
-Me to my dear Piggy every single day while survivors bully me
---
That's certainly daunting, but it's not like I don't enjoy the game! I think I'm ready for the grind, especially because of the encouraging words everyone has gave me on this thread lol
---
Lol that's great, and welcome to the master race!
---
Oh shit this is scary.
---
That would be me :0 )
---
Removed we ask you take part of this sub before posting videos thank you
---
Probably should have used shitpost
---
Thank you I've been trying to find a bag like this for so long
---
Amazon. I had to change the entire front, re-sew it and install a zipper
---
Why not
---
It’s true, does give a sense of bringing franklins or lightborn :)
---
Guys... They mean what backpack would that be called irl lmao
---
Wish I could help answer.
---
I prefer survivor because I don't get as much joy out of the idea of killing (generally) defenseless survivors. It makes me feel better to pull off an impressive escape or hide around trees and gens. Ultimately, I think each role is a fundamentally different experience, and people choose to main one or the other because that one aspect of the game is what makes them feel good. Now, I of course have a bit of survivor bias, but I try to keep it in perspective by hearing out the complaints Killer mains have. I think face camping is unfun and toxic, but I can respect some camping as an effective strategy as long as the killer demonstrates some level of skill. I also won't tolerate survivors t-bagging at the gates and being a jerk to the killer for no reason
---
Also youtubers making videos about why it’s going to bad when it’s not even out yet
---
They’re cute until you’re the only non-baby on a team of baby dweets and megs/Claudettes that hide in lockers until you’re into struggle, then bolt across the map blindly and get downed right in front of you...
---
I’m not bitter, why do you ask?
---
This is SUCH a good cosplay. So sinister and well made.
---
Well your teammates did the right thing in my eyes no point in saving someone if your gonna get killed. But proxying is fun for nobody.
---
It is when 3 people are blocking a hook and teabagging while strobing their flashlights. Unless it was a dance party for the soon to be dead friend.
---
Removed please use /r/dbdLFG
---
What's interesting is that the Halloween head actually has 4 eyes on it. The 3 upfront and there's one in the back on the left side. Took me forever to notice it though.
---
The killer was camping. They're not obligated to come get you. Maybe you're the one who should take a little break.
---
Mlga? What's that?
---
just hit when you get semi close to the survivor
---
what the hell? There was an exit right there and there's two of them. and I have ds
---
good lord you have proven yourself to be a fantastic cosplayer, fantastic job!
---
oink
---
Dude was bagging the whole game homie
---
Rucksack, I think. I have a Life Wit Rucksack that looks pretty similar.
---
Then it’s not the body blocking that was toxic it was them flashlight spamming and teabagging. For example if 3 of them tried to body block and that was it that’s not toxic
---
Why aren’t you on the dev team already?
---
I run Leader, Small Game, Balanced Landing and Borrowed Time
---
Its in the game, so get used to it? lol.
---
Well how would they know that? This is mostly the killers fault not your teammates.
---
Mhm I ship it
---
Agree with u mate, wtf r they doing? At least one of them broke a totem, I guess so did some points, they don’t had to save u but... I just don’t get it.
---
I always tunnel a survivor when they do this 😂😂😂hate mail follows shortly after
---
Watch a guy called true talent on yt, he provides tips and tricks while he plays and he is very good at the game so watching him play should give you a good idea on how to play better
---
Why am I laughing so hard
---
Okay, racist.
---
Nah because they send hate mail after 😂😂if he wanted it then why is he/she angry?
---
This post was 40 days old
---
I feel personally attacked.
