I honestly wish the more "brute-ish" killere could just do that. Like Trapper or Leatherface just walking through a pallet like it's nothing
---
---
---
Also Monitor and Abuse is stupid good on her too.
---
.. I read this like ed edd and eddy
---
Do you play on ps4? Perhaps just played in cold wind farm
---
Yeah he gets a FREE 16k, sacrifice 1-2 people and you're in the mid 20ks, maybe 30k was a slight exaggeration but 25k for 2 kills as doctor isn't rare, and getting the average amount of kills (2) is pretty much the definition of meh.
---
It's been a while since I played against a hag.
---
I only hate her because of the fucking jumpscare traps, my heart cant take it.
---
I play on a toilet
---
Yeah, guess your right. Understandable, have a great day
---
I agree hag is fun to go against and all fair and crap but her crappy traps that face you to the traps when trigged mess up chase loops vaults actions or anything
---
ESSENITALIA
---
No, this is Patrick 
---
Before all the survivor nerfs no but now? Lol cmon there‚Äôs a reason killers hate swf it‚Äôs because it isn‚Äôt easy to deal with like solo queue survivors are. When you play killer how often do you see yourself losing vs solo survivors lol be real
---
I guess I'll stop hiding in corners when they're at the gate then.
---
yikes

Ooof you've got that all wrong. Balanced Landing, Dead Hard and Lithe and then Sprint Burst. I hate using Sprint Burst because I cant run anywhere for fear of using it before the killer catches me.
---
That was painful to watch holy hell. That doctor definitely uninstalled after that game hahaha.

&gt; Lol cmon there‚Äôs a reason killers hate swf it‚Äôs because it isn‚Äôt easy to deal with like solo queue survivors are.
---
There's a ton of reasons killers hate when you use voice apps the game isn't designed around, here's a few:L
---
* Honey be careful, it's Myers. He's still in Tier 1 so you're OK to sprint.
---
* There's a totem active by the shed, I can't get to it atm but are you able to?
---
 
---
* He's breaking pallets near ____, don't loop him over here
---
* You're safe to work that gen, he's on the other side of the map
---
* I'm 75% finished with the last gen, go toward the exit gate instead, I got this
---
* I'll provide a distraction, you stay productive.
---
* He's camping the hook, just rush gens
---
That shit just takes some of the fun out of the match dude, nobody is saying that SWF are impossible to beat or anything just....boosted and unfun. 
---
Why tho? You're just wasting everyone's time.
---
But it just wastes time
---
I don‚Äôt really need that though. The music distracts me during a chase and causes me to fuck up. 
---
It‚Äôs a victory dance

2 of them are thicc, 1 of them has a nice slim build.
---
cease this at once
---
Happens a lot late at night because of the lack of people playing in your region
---
Oh right forgot that the reduction in the stun works while exhausted. 
---
And yes,dead hard is really great to evade a hit,but honestly,if you dont have an immediate Plan B after that then you will only get at best a few more seconds into the chase. 
---
Sometimes I use it to evade a hit but most of the time the killer then knows you have it and will bait you into using it.
---
Praise!

Whispers/Nurse's/Murmur seems redundant if you ask me. They're all good perks, but you don't all three of them togther. The pig is very susceptible to being pallet/window looped so Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle, and Brutal Strength are all strong on her, especially Enduring and Spirit Fury together. Her own Make Your Choice is a very good perk for anyone, and now that Surveillance has been buffed, it's worth using now too. Hex:Ruin is one of the strongest killer perks in the game, arguably the strongest and Discordance is up there too.

Left foot green

You see a dead dwight

You mean clown lul

oh guess  all of us were wrong

You dare mock the son of a Trapper?

Omg I know! This game is so hard! Devs! Nerf! Hag plz!

I always just go to the furthest gen. Always find someone near it.

I'd imagine she has a forest to match her location as well.

Urban invasion....lol'd pretty hard at that.
---
Thank you, will do.
---
Its called the little weiner dance.
---
Just do what I do: Go to the opposite end of the map from the two gates, and wait. If a survivor wants to gloat, they can do so after growing a pair and surviving a chase across the map. Otherwise they're just wasting their own time. Call me stubborn, but I'd rather not give them the satisfaction of forcing me to watch them tea-bag before running out. 
---
I thought it was a minion at first and that made it so much worse
---
I too am a bloody Quentin 
---
How the fuck does she produce that noise when she ambushes 
---
Oink
---
Lol rank 1 isn't bragging at all
---
I‚Äôm just looking for a discussion it‚Äôs something I joke about with  my friends and just something I wanted to see ur opinion on but ok TOXIC huntresses 
---
I hate it so much because it could've been a really good game but they ruin it by time wasting
---
All I could do
---
Now make the survivors NPCs lol
---
Even when the gates are open and you're sitting in front of one, and your teammates have already escaped. 
---
I love how you can tell who‚Äôs legitimately given this any thought and who‚Äôs just big angry because it makes the game a bit harder to rush through. 
---
I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good solution just because it‚Äôs coming at the whole ‚Äúgens get done too quick‚Äù from the wrong angle. Gens get done really fast but the issue is that most killers have little effect on how long the chase lasts. Your suggestion is good but it‚Äôs one of those changes that makes swf a little less OP at the cost of hurting solo survivor as well. 
---
I don‚Äôt personally have an insta fix but the best place to start would be to make killers that aren‚Äôt huntress, nurse, or spirit actually have a skill ceiling that is pretty much equal to that of the survivor. This wouldn‚Äôt mean buffing a bunch of killers but reworking the mechanics of the chase to allow the others to have an end of say hit dependent on the killers actions but still influenced by the survivors actions. Once a change like that hits then it‚Äôll be easier to balance the game and tackle gen times.
---
With all the other perks you'll have a guarantee of using it in chase, but with balanced landing sometimes there close to no places to drop down
---
Legion certainly needs a lot of tweaking.
---
Yesn't
---
If I want to farm, I just assume that they won't cooperate. Try hard until I've established dominance, and farm from there. No dominance = no farm.
---
Parts of this community have convinced each other that they're doing the killer a favor by forcing him to come to one of the exit gates and chase you out for 600BP.
---
Nurse downs 4 survivors in different sections of the map, when she goes to hang one survivor, we (the 3 remaining survivors) meet up and start spinning on the floor. Nurse comes where we are and then she stands there, thinking what is happening. Then she starts grabbing us one by one and freeing us, after we heal each other she starts guiding us to the gens and we escape. 
---
Almost couldn‚Äôt have been a worse comment. Balanced and DH are the best, then lithe, then sprint burst
---
Faster hatched wind up.. Flower babushka I think it is and there's a 2nd one that also does this. Besides that brown exhaust addon is also pretty decent 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude
---
But what if you're close to a pallette or window?
---
believe me, i understand. I‚Äôve gone against sabo jakes in 4 man.
---
doesnt deter me from playing killer tho.
---
Venomous Concoction, Begrimed Head,  Yes Seed Concoction and of course, Infinaltry Belt.
---
Yup! Freddy is fun to play against, for the most part. He can be looped and is counter able. Legion is garbage. 
---
‚ÄúKillers are so toxic lmao‚Äù
---
Fuck off weeb
---
Now this does put a smile on my toxic faceüëç
---
Yo you bout to die!
---
wHAT ARE YOU INSINUATING 
---
I saw someone with a pig flair on the sub that said ‚Äúbig brain pig main‚Äù and then I became a big brain pig main and now I oink.
---
Also we were playing against pig 1 survivor left traps him at the exit gate and then runs into the exit and nods head furiously for survivor to commit sudoku 
---
Best moment in DBD 
---
But with balanced you can only use it at dropdowns, and sometimes there are literally none and make the perk useless
---
Right, and my solution wastes more time so it's probably not what you're looking for. But again, I'm stubborn. Having to travel to an exit game to watch the gloating before they run out when they know damn well I can't touch them is stupid and cowardly. They want to teabag at the gate, then they can find me and survive a chase across the map. Otherwise I'll browse the internet or whatever and wait for them to just leave. 
---
Crouching thru spots where you know there‚Äôs traps or probably will be traps? Most hags don‚Äôt set them randomly they always set them by objectives or pallets. 
---
Noed almost always activates for me. Like 99 percent of the time. Could help that i don't run ruin so thats one more totem that it can spawn on 
---
Wasting everyone's time how? If other people want to leave they can.
---
If the killer wants me to leave he can try to make me.
---
This is hilarious! Your brother is a  skilled artist.
---
B R U H
---
What gay porno is this?
---
This would work just as well with "Console optimization" on the right and "New cosmetics" on the right.
---
Then I use it to get to that pallet
---
Alt + F4, way fewer steps
---
That makes no sense. So if the killer gave up and went afk you'd just wait?

---
Yeah and then the killer can't just wait to let you use it, that's literally how you us the perk
---
I was cursed out by being toxic when me and 3 friends (so a full swf) gave a killer a 4K by being drunk and goofing around. Didn‚Äôt tbag, didn‚Äôt flashlight, nothing. It‚Äôs just the person
---
Sure. Was just liking some more variety in dailies.
---
The problem with Freddy is that it is way too easy to get out of the dream state, and he has nothing to help him chase survivors once they get into the dream state. Every other killer in the game can do *something* to help them catch up to survivors; the Trapper can heard people into his traps and deny loops and pallets, the Wraith can cloak the throw survivors off guard and to get the movement bonus, Leatherface can end chases quickly by instadowning and chainsawing pallets, the Pig can ambush people to hit them in a loop, the Doctor can render survivors unable to interact with pallets and windows, etc, Freddy has literally nothing to help him. He can get easy hits as survivors transition into the dream state, but has absolutely nothing to help him after that. Just chasing people around all day is almost always going to eat up more time than you're saving with dream state debuff. I don't think he's bearly as bad as some people say, that's why he's generally considered the weakest character in the game.
---
it's actually not the same image 
---
Classic BHVR quality.
---
Every map has a drop down. It also works on cooldown. It's the best exhaustion perk for experienced players
---
On the other hand, as a killer I brought a mori against a full swf. They came into my twitch chat after the match and continued to be toxic until they got banned. 
---
Ppl suck and I no longer care if anyone else has fun; it‚Äôs impossible to please veryone 
---
Imagine being a killer and being afraid of friends playing together.
---
You clearly don‚Äôt play killer enough
---
Was it Lettuce Hag by chance? :O
---
I don't want to be bribed. I don't want to get paid off to shut up about how broken SWF is, because the issue with SWF isn't how much BP I earn against them. 
---
Yeah it's gonna take some time getting used to. I never realized just how much I accidentally touch the triggers.
---
Maybe he felt ignored?
---
And they‚Äôre both dumb crutches 
---
Unfortunately swf is the main pull of the game now though. With how rocky the last patches have been, the devs aren‚Äôt going to make a large change to the game. I completely agree playing SWF is broken and dumb af. It‚Äôs basically like I‚Äôll take what I can get. Otherwise I‚Äôll just keep dodging them 
---
That's part of the point of her traps. Otherwise it'd be a faint screech in the distance as you run away like nothing just happened and the poor Hag would never be able to catch up. It's about forcing the survivors to make mistakes.
---
A DOCTOR NEVER GIVES UP ON HIS PATIENT!
---
They changed it on the test build, didn‚Äôt put it live, and the text didn‚Äôt change back. Also it‚Äôs not exactly a pressing issue 
---
Not many ‚Äúsubers‚Äù huh? 
---
Well perhaps it‚Äôs because you call the community ‚Äúplebs.‚Äù Just a thought. 
---
dude this was so much fun to watch. had me laughing too

When you spawn on the game and immediately get electrocuted

Are you a hecking weeb? &gt;:l
---
We're you playing legion?
---
Actually?
---
No i play as the pig
---
People who DC are cowards
---
Shrek 7 confirmed
---
Oh ok. I was about to say that's just to be expected with legion. Weird that they dc'd on a pig. 
---
It essentially functions as a normal attack so noed franklins and sloppy butcher work I‚Äôm not sure about save the best for last tho
---
Honestly I just go find the killer right away. We‚Äôre either gonna farm or I‚Äôm gonna kill myself on the hook bc 2v1 is just insta gg 
---
Weeeeee
---
Oh wow wtf that‚Äôs horrible, I hope it doesn‚Äôt happen to me I‚Äôve spent so much time and money on this game, 
---
Swf is totally balanced kappa 
---
To be fair, you were running a pretty light build. Not saying there arent balance issues (there *certainly* are), but having a better load out would surely help.
---
Killer animals is one I would like to see, like Cujo or giant spiders. Since killers have to have a humanoid skeleton (devs said on stream) I think the best chance is a killer with a pet, like a hunter and his dog. People would go crazy for the dog cosmetics.
---
Had a Kate do that to me yesterday against a nurse.  Game dragged on so long since I was the only one trying to do gens, the Kate was hiding.
---
I died, then she got pulled out of a hatch.
---
Messaged the killer to apologize for the game dragging on, received no response. Whatever. 
---
Oh the shack is the safest and best looping spot? Let's put a generator and a totem in it! Or my favorite... on the outside in plan view...
---
#*THE INCEL*
---
#Perks:
---
*Incel Tears*
---
The mere sight of *Chad's* and *Stacy's* working together sends you into an autistic rage. When interrupting cooperative actions while Survivors are in your Terror Radius, gain a token. Total of 3 tokens, each one decreases missed and successful attack cool-down by 8/10/12%
---
*Hex: Mommy's Tendies*
---
A Hex Totem that is lit so that Mommy knows where to deliver your precious Tendies, with extra Hunny Mussy. The Hex Totem does not take effect until cleansed. Once cleansed, all survivors auras are revealed to you for 3/4/5 seconds, and your movement speed is increased by 30% for 15/20/25 seconds.
---
*Autistic Savant*
---
Your severe autism has cost you any chance of having a normal social life, but in return it has given you the ability to make 5000 IQ plays in online video games. When a Survivor vaults over a window or pallet during a chase, you will see their aura for 4 seconds. Perk recharges every 30/25/20 seconds.
---
#Power:
---
*REEEEEEEEEE*
---
After emitting a piercing battle cry, charge forward a short distance before simultaneously slashing and unleashing a small AOE attack consisting of foul body odors.
---
‚Ä¢ Takes 3 seconds to charge
---
‚Ä¢ Bursts forward at 2x movement speed for a maximum of 4 seconds
---
‚Ä¢ Gas attack has a range of 6m in the shape of a circle around *THE INCEL* for the duration of the attack
---
‚Ä¢ Injures Survivors within 1m of *THE INCEL* during the attack.
---
‚Ä¢ Cool-down of 3 seconds
---
‚Ä¢ Battle cry can be heard throughout entire map
---
‚Ä¢  When a Survivor is hit by *REEEEEEEEEE*, they will suffer from impaired vision and reduced movement speed for 2 seconds, and involuntary coughing for 10 seconds. They will not  begin recovery‚Äã from the *Exhausted* status effect until 20 seconds after being hit.
---
Add ons could reduce charge/cd time for killer power, add status effects to killer power, and maybe even a Mommy's House Map, complete with Pepe's Basement full of loli porn and tendies!
---
Kate's okay but shes no Feng Feng... ;p
---
Hag is really powerful against teams that aren't built to wreck you. It really depends on your play with her. My few tips are to be always putting traps down, and selecting a side of the map with plenty of generators. Look up Space Coconut's hag totorial for more tips.
---
When it comes to general success, you'll learn as you play what you need to do in order to get your wins. Hag might be the most difficult to figure out what you're suppose to be doing because she plays to different from most other killers, but she is definitely R1 viable.
---
You'll get it in time!
---
I play the game for 4-5 hours a day. There‚Äôs been days where just about every lobby is a swf. There‚Äôs enjoying a challenge and then there‚Äôs being a masochist. 
---
Use lightborn.
---
But the extra 2k

He can assert his dominance on me any day.
---
And that doesn't help. They can still get you with some of the higher tier flashlights. 
---
But teamwork :(
---
Which I realize I value more than a loooot of other players
---
Look at the ranks, that‚Äôs his complaint. He‚Äôs obviously a new player 
---
No red rank should ever be put into a lobby with anyone over 15, even if its SWF
---
I will do anything to try to save my team or help them in any way, but if one of them screws me over, I just marinate in JUSTICE when I see them get killed at the end anyway
---
I like Spirit way more than Hag. Her mind games make her a blast to play.

Heheheheheh...
---
For killer if they run pallets make them pay the price and camp them
---
I love going against swf. Always have the best chases with them.  They don‚Äôt hide and urban evade around the map like solo guys do because they think it helps them win.  I don‚Äôt care about flashlights either, I‚Äôm ready for it. Bring it on! 
---
Blanced landing is not a noob friendly perk to use it where can I use it not like sb where it's like just run or dead heard where it's about timing and being injured and it's very glitchy lithe is just where is a vault
---
Nice. I had a Wraith today who face camped once he saw 2 generators left. I saved a guy off the hook and got camped. Wraith kept nodding while I was on the hook (I didn‚Äôt BM at all the whole game prior to this but this Wraith was still being a jerk). Last gen popped and I got rescued with Adrenaline. He hit me one more time but we all made it out the exit gates. 
---
That's not frozen, that's just waiting for someone else who is stuck.
---
You could also try and pretend to pick up the survivor to bait the guy with the flashlight and hit him so he could take off 
---
Flashlights all blind in the same amount of time and when running lightborn they actually can‚Äôt blind you in the time you pick someone up assuming you look up the second you can.
---
Flashlights are fine as they are, just look at a wall if you‚Äôre that spooked by em.
---
Look I completely agree with what you‚Äôre saying there, as I said though, I feel a killer gets better when playing against SWF. I‚Äôve been rolled hard playing against SWF but instead of getting salty I learned from it and changed up how I play. 
---
Obviously everyone is going to be different in their approach to how they handle a SWF but I honestly feel it‚Äôs made me such a better player when it‚Äôs come to killer, it‚Äôs like any other game that has difficulty modes, playing against 4 randoms depending on level is like playing on Medium to Hard where as playing against a SWF (once again depending on level) is like playing on Hard to Extreme. 
---
I may not 4K every game (not even close) but I‚Äôll usually get a solid 3k and I‚Äôm pretty happy with that. 
---
All flashlights blind at the same time now it's been that way for 7 months lightning on thenother hand requires them to start blinding you before you pick up the survivor to get it in time
---
‚ÄúShould patch out this exploit,‚Äù 
---
Did you just say that flashlights saves are an exploit?
---
So far I've seen one temp ban turn into a perma ban for prestige glitch.  A two day ban and another perma ban for prestige glitch.  So three so far.  
---
Less than 10 minutes ago i unlocked 2nd perk slot. And i have the 3 teachables, noed and sloppy
---
‚ÄòAn healing item‚Äô too. So professional
---
If the game freezes, I can't open the overlay.
---
The person in question could hav been doing the daily escape and survive with said survivor or escape and survive with 1 new item and just decided he didn't want to risk it ü§£
---
Such children lol
---
&gt; This game is about the chase.
---
Ok, ok, this is true. What else do you have.
---
&gt; Comparing a killer who breaks the chase mechanics
---
Ok, so we're talking about Legion, who does break the chase mechanics. This is also true.
---
&gt; to a strong survivor perk doesnt make any sense
---
lolwut?
---
How do you get any more "break the chase" then a perk that literally invalidates the chase that just happened if the Killer just so happened to have been the one that won it?
---
DS breaks Chases just as much as Legion does, don't try to pretend that it doesn't.
---
Hitboxes are the best
---
Oops I mi- AUGH 
---
Isn't it kind of counter-intuitive to take Lullaby with Freddy? Survivors are going to be spamming spacebar to wake up as soon as a skill check pops up. I guess there is some benefit for when they're not asleep but ideally they shouldnt be awake at all so I would say it's probably better to that doesnt make it easier to fail skill checks since they're going to purposely fail it a lot often anyways.
---
Or the game can do something to encourage better behavior, like the way Overwatch has an endorsements system that gives you lootboxes if you keep your endorsements high enough for long enough.
---
Omg this is too good.
---
Loud
---
You could just not play for 5 hours a day.... probably wouldn‚Äôt bug you as much to go against SWF 
---
Nah, it‚Äôs a team game.
---
He wanted his daily.... Lol wtf was is 2 sacrifices or chainsaw?
---
I stream it. 
---
Oof.. Sorry you had to go through that. 
---
I get flash stunned maybe once every 100 games lol. Just face a wall or bait the grab. Pretty easy.
---
So much fun xoxo oink 
---
Yeah and all it‚Äôs done is cause killers to dodge even more because not everyone‚Äôs seen the change. It‚Äôs fucking annoying lol
---
Ugh, true. I would never do that to sometime for a daily, but I know there are those who would üôÑ
---
Like, just try again next game if we don't get out? Or are they do terrible at this game that escaping is that hard for them
---
Ughhhh I'm just heated hahaha
---
30 second timer per chase, if it ain't going your way after 30 seconds, move on to the next one, can't tell you how many killers refuse to go after someone else when they get run around for a year and a half
---
you guys? What do you mean? Were all players of DBD. 
---
I assume you mainly play killer and were using "you guys" in the context of survivors meaning you must have negative views of the majority of the player base.
---
Again, I don't always play with people so they aren't my buddies... They are the other survivors. I don't want my play experience dragged on longer than it has to be if you want to make my experience not fun. It's not fun when the last survivor hides on the other side of the map behind every tree for the killer. So why would it be fun for the survivors to sit on the ground for 4 mins while you use me as bait? 
---
Don't have such a bias attitude and maybe play the other part of the game you bought more often.
---
When you see the same fuckin Dwight blowing gens the entire game come to yours as it's nearing 99
---
I love playing her there. She always blinks face first into a wall
---
Eh...I sent in a ticket, but I feel like I'm wasting my time.
---
I, a Jake main, exchanged my toolbox for my life on lerys last night to myers, I was already injured so he downed me right as I opened the gate, he carried me back to my toolbox and dropped me a few times so i got released and he nodded for me to take my toolbox and let me live. saved the clip but couldn't message him to thank him due to his settings :( 
---
But then you screw over all players who grinded all perks on P3 killers.
---
Do they get rewarded? And with what? You can't give em perks, and there aren't any more prestige cosmetics.
---
The grind currently is in a decent spot. 
---
I would honestly cry if I lost all my prestiges, I just finished all the survivors.
---
Lots of people have an issue with it actually? Everyone I‚Äôve played with complains about the music volume/ music in general. Might not bother you but that doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt bother anyone else lol.
---
That's not what that means
---
It does it for lots of games. Completely stable, perfectly running games. The reason you're not seeing that behavior the second time you launch after reboot is because Windows is like "I know exactly how much you need. Stop playing dumb."
---
Needs more jpeg
---
That's just my suggestion. You can throw something out there and still a handful of people would be upset. Any reward wouldn't satisfy those that already did so. The same issue happened with the old leveling system. I just personally feel the system is flawed as it's far from a fun or rewarding grind to me. 
---
Then throw in a Game offering, and you've got my best set-up
---
Deaf *and* blind.  Nice!  
---
[removed]
---
Except slugging somebody isn't holding the game hostage. You will bleed out eventually. The only way a killer can hold a game hostage is by standing on the hatch. Which even then, a survivor has the option of doing generators. Survivors can actually hold the game hostage, as you pointed out in your other comment. Difference being is that they can do that indefinitely while killers cannot.
---
Irionically you have a bias attitude by somehow condemning a legitimate killer strategy in favor of a survivor SWF exploit. The game isn't designed for you to D/C when you feel like it, but it *was* designed for you to bleed out on the ground. 
---
You're a person with good taste.  Some people on B and C prob should change places but otherwise this is a fine list. Have my upvote!
---
My thought was that the hex totem does not appear as lit to the survivor until they are actually affected by it. With that, survivors would have to go to a generator and actually be hexed for the ruin totem to appear as lit. At the same time, if the Ruin totem appearing as a dull totem to the survivor is destroyed, the effects of ruin go with it.
---
To keep Haunted Grounds viable, the totems would only appear lit if no other hex totems are remaining, or if a hex totem has lit, which would cause them to appear lit at game start if the killer has no other hex perks.
---
What else do you think Laurie Decisive Strikes with? 
---
Sometimes i meet asurvivor that i do wonder if they are really that derpy or are they trying to help me.  Usually when they do shit like a big loop throw the pallet down and run straight into my arms.  Or spent too long tbagging a shed window giving me time to poke a chainsaw in he's face. 
---
I don't know what the fuck is going on with this game. I know 2 survivors suicided on hook because they were being faced camp but I never saw the 3rd. When I was put on my first hook, I died and I was so confused. You can see he is alive and has points so wtf 
---
Me, too! Much more satisfying :) too bad it doesn't go that way often...
---
Well no it doesnt, not to the extent Legion does. Thats just not true. DS gives the survivor a second chance while Legion turns the game into singleplayer. Not even close.
---
Yes, a strong survivor perk that activates after the killer successfully ends a chase so that survivor can start yet another chase. 
---
I guess it's not very fun being put up against really unfun bullshit, huh?  Don't worry man, just drop a pallet on Legion's head when he comes sprinting.  It's so easy to counter.  
---
Depends on my mood.  Sometimes I enjoy the challenge (Although most aren't as good as they think they are.)  Sometimes I don't want the aggravation as they're almost always super toxic.  
---
Dude just ignore it, your a killer, your job is to kill, as a survivor main, we don‚Äôt rlly have much reason to bitch about stuff like this, it‚Äôs part of the game 
---
Clearly you don't if you can't beat SWF. 
---
You assume every SWF is some kind of 4 man god-squad. 
---
I'm devotion 5. every killer level 50.
---
 I play killer plenty.
---
Holy shit that made me laugh, thank you
---
Lmfao
---
Turns the chase into Singleplayer, and the best part of survivor gameplay is the chase. 
---
They don‚Äôt, but they want to
---
I think they just need to fix the placements a little more.  We have Thrill of the Hunt if you want to protect your totems.  Also Haunted Ground to punish for cleansing.  I do love Haunted Ground.  
---
I think the most basic and realistic answer to this discussion is... what company in their right mind would alienate such a HUGE portion of their player base? Most people, if not all, that I know, would not play if they couldn‚Äôt play with a friend. Outside the sub you‚Äôll find the majority of people really just do play for fun and playing with friends is part of that. Everyone I know who bought the game bought it to join other people. I don‚Äôt know in what universe they‚Äôd ban SWF unless they want the game to die. 
---
Legion doesnt take the reward from knowing how to loop, what I said was that he breaks the chase. Theres no mindgames, you just kinda run doing nothing but waiting for him to hit you 3-4 times.
---
Does he also use NOED and is around rank 8? I might‚Äôve found the same wraith before too.
---
And they're on the same tier as a child rapist.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeee
---
See what‚Äôs funny is when I came back, I played back when nurse was new and flashy, came back a bit for Myers, but I was gone for a while and the video for legion came off as a totally different killer than what it is. I thought it was gonna be a mindgamey killer, not a tunneller.
---
Lightborn 3 makes it impossible to blind the killer during pick up animation. 
---
Just got camped by one less then 5 minutes ago, the two survivors didn't. Guess they naturally dislike Dwight's or something
---
Lullaby shows up the moment you get a skill check too.
---
The old system was given legacy. That was a solid reward. 
---
I enjoyed the grind, running level 1/2 perks that spiced up my screen instead of purple. Working towards a stronger perk and levelling killers for the sake of completion.
---
I have a friend who hates the system, yet only plays once or twice a month. It's all about investing yourself in the grind and working towards a goal
---
I want it!!
---
So good!
---
That little nod at the end is what sells it
---
They said they did but it‚Äôs been hard to tell tbh. It could still be being added just slowly I guess.

Bitch shut up 
---
The Fact that you call flashlight saving an exploit already makes me lose all the respect for your idea.
---
wglf and bbq are legitimately the exact same in the vast majority of situations you dumb twat , only difference is the aura reading that has MULTIPLE built in hard-counters to it. Don't wanna get seen hide in a locker , go behind a gen , walk for seconds in 1 direction and then cut back. Its not even that hard , here about about we have 4 survivors all run and tell me that fucking unrelenting is better then that. Your just an entitled twat wanting an easy win one of these days bhvr will pull heads outta their asses and properly balance this game. Till then everytime I see a twat like you i'm just gonna go omega blink nurse with an ebony mori and shit all over you. Guess its true , if you can't beat um , join um.
---
I suppose, yeah, ideally they aren't getting skill check chances anyway with certain add-ons. But it feels like I get more out of it than Ruin if only due to the fact that there's not much urgency to cleanse it most of the time. It punishes the dream state exit and makes gens more difficult when they're awake. A lot simply ignore it until it's at 3 or 4 stacks and they suddenly can't hit skill checks. 
---
Lmao someone downvoted you
---
Killers can see survivors names in the pregame lobby. When everyone needs to ready up and standing around a campfire and stuff. 
---
Yes, they're the exact same, that's the point except the killer has an added benefit. Whether you want to deflect it by stating counters that don't always work or you're not always close to(gens or lockers), doesn't change the fact that my point still stands. Killer perks are ALWAYS more powerful than a survivors. Even their offerings. Your sentence about unrelenting is almost incoherent, so I'm not even going to respond to that. And yeah, the last portion  is mostly ad hominems and unsupported arguments so I'm also not gonna respond to that. 
---
If they escape, they say "get good", if you kill them, you're a camper. SWFs deserve all the camping toxic killers they get.
---
Could be avoiding ban again, new account/ip change or whatever is involved. He couldcalso have a lot of saved footage to work with.

Pretty much. Because the game isn't good unless you're having fun, everyone else be damned.

That‚Äôs not anyone‚Äôs problem but yours.

Meirl when my teammates start doubling a gen against Billy who spawned 48 meters away from you on Grim Pantry and they get off scot free before I get trapped against a nook against the gen wall and sawed by the billy and the obsession gets downed 6 seconds and two hits later and now everyone is there and it's an absolute shitshow of a depip.

It works. Sometimes I do it and I don't even bring a Hex, and 2 out of 5 times it works.

Poor dude looked brand new.

Being a killer main myself, although i don't play the game much anymore. When i did play it alot, i only ever even considered slugging people when dealing with super altruistic or even borderline toxicly badmannered survivors. So i never felt bad about it.

Kate at A and Doctor at S, theres something wrong here

---
Wow, thanks, I gained a spell!
---
Thank you so much!!
---
But I do only have OoO and Sole survivor"-"
---
The looping is the chase, dummy.  This game is about making the killer waste his time with you as much as possible, the killer tries to have the survivor make a mistake to shorten the chase and thus fuck up the loop.  Having a killer that easily breaks that honestly doesn't miff me because survivors don't give a flipping fuck about balance, they just want their comfortable stranglehold on this game to continue.  Not to mention that the killer himself isn't even very good and if he 4Ks a team without using the best addons possible then the team they faced deserved to lose anyways.

I play Legion 90% of the games I play as killer, and I hate this
---
IF YOU'RE IN THE HEARTBEAT YOU SHOULDN'T DIE FROM DEEP WOUND
---
That's why you see people moonwalking as Legion with bloodhound because it won't put you in a chase until you find the survivor. I get annoyed by it when I play as survivor and also killer. It's the stupidest thing ever in this game. That's why I don't moonwalk unless the person is extremely good at survivor
---
I know it shows up and I know you can still tap with it active, I'm just saying it's a lot more dangerous because the skill checks are harder to predict, and when combined with distressing and/or unnerving they tend to happen more frequently and are therefore more dangerous to risk. In my experience, if I keep my Lullaby safe, even at high rank survivors stop what they are doing and hide/search for the totem at all costs. They won't heal, they won't do gens, they won't enter into a chase/loop because they don't want to risk getting caught and possibly giving me more stacks (if I hadn't gotten all 5 yet). Just speaking in my own experience. The moment that totem is gone though....it pretty much ruins the whole plan. Much like Ruin. It's a toss up for both of them, but I've always had better success with Lullaby. 
---
What rank are you?
---
commit attempt escape
---
But it‚Äôs from 2012?

You would be surprised. Most people on PS4 don't deserve their ranks. I see more cowards and potato headed people at rank 1 than I do at rank 20.

Well there was just a free play weekend. But yea you‚Äôll never win as a killer. Just brush it off and keep playing

PepeTraps

Can someone explain this to a filthy console player such as my self?

A shapeshifting killer would be dope

It would fix so much shit but BHVR is too afraid of making the SWF playerbase angry. I honestly think if major changes to balance are not pushed out we will run out of killer mains, and thus, games.

"He was **bleeding**. Begging you for mercy."

If you don't trust ardetha, Noob3 backed him up in his video about ochido.
---
I don‚Äôt know why you made this but I‚Äôm really glad you did
---
The thing that makes me angry is that there is no game like DBD so there‚Äôs nothing to go to instead. And the devs know this so they‚Äôre not too rushed to fix things. I like the slight imbalance of killer vs survivor, but adding comms just skews it too much. They obviously knew it because they didn‚Äôt add in game voice chat, so why hasn‚Äôt anything been done? They just keep making shitty events and new cosmetics
---
ya skipping the available perk is no good :( cuz you'll probs see it again
---
Both of those perks are pretty good too.  
---
I swear the game knows what you want and teases you. I‚Äôve been spending so much bp trying to get nurses calling on my huntress but no luck

---
I don't mind getting bashed and blinded, so long as it's on my terms. 
---
Franklin's and Lightborn. Works 99% of the time.
---
It feels like halfway through writing the backstory, they just gave up on keeping any sort of consistency.
---
My ass got clapped up when i was doing the adept doctor but as soon as i got them next game.... Ho ho..... They never stood a chance against my bbq and billy.
---
lets say you hooked someone in the basement... is it considered camping when you use territorial imperative and move as far from the basement as you need to get the notification that someone entered it, so you can farm the survivors that try to save the hooked survivor? did this sometimes, when i had no good perks on leatherface. had some interesting games. many survivors were salty though
---
All I wanted was my 3 nurse blink hits " cries in the üåΩ
---
Freddy can often get the first hit more freely than the Wraith, and then come back later to down them once they return to a gen or some other less safe area than a loop.  He has a pretty small terror radius with just 24m, 16 with M&amp;A making him pretty darn sneaky.  Smaller size can assist in mind games, but it's not significantly noteworthy against good survivors. Using the aura reading from the sleep lets him get lots of easy hits without having to brute force loops very often, and abandoning those chases works well for him since he wants to be constantly sleeping new people anyway.
---
Every once in a while when playing killer, the first hit on a survivor in the game freezes the game permanently. Whatever sound was currently playing keeps going and I have to force-restart my PC. I can't alt-tab out or do anything else. Completely frozen.
---
are you really complaining about 9 cosmetic pieces for FREE?
---
It has come to my attention that the photo looks like shit. I believe you get the point of it still, but yeah.
---
I mean... Probably not? They can't really ban you for deciding not to play before a match starts?
---
She has only 3 hair types in the store and 5 over all. Meanwhile Meg has like 7000:(
---
The fastest disconnect in the west
---
Most of the maps are open with many shaded spots Making it kinda hard if your just strolling by gens and don't know the common hiding spots during a Chase
---
When‚Äôs the event starting?
---
You missed my point. Slugging and dying on the hook are ok, because the game is designed to let you do those things. D/Cing, for killer and survivor, is not intended. Because its penalized. It's outside the realm of gameplay and a disservice to the killer and even your own teammates in some situations.
---
Don't like how the game is designed? Play something else. Slugging is a viable tactic, quitting the game isn't. It isn't a hard concept to grasp. I've never once thought of D/Cing when slugged, its a pathetic and weak excuse to quit the game because it isn't going in your favor and you're too impatient to wait a few minutes, or seconds if your team is actually decent, for your teammates to help or do objectives. I've rarely bled out all the way when I've been slugged and have had very little reason to D/C.
---
By your logic why don't I just D/C at the start of the match when I realize Im up against a god nurse since I know it's a waste of time to go against one? I don't agree with their method of playing so naturally I must quit and put up no fight whatsoever.
---
she knew, she allowed it. i decided to let her crawl out that way instead of hooking her. i was gonna let her and the other survivor leave the game cause the other two survivors dc before a gen was done...she told me to take the kill.
---
It's likely that it's Ruin at red ranks, but in the end you won't know what it is until the end of the game or until it's triggered.
---
I'm just trying to ignore survivor's crutches because I can't play the Nurse. Is that so wrong? ;-;
---
I know I was playing. :p Watched it recently on netflix and actually thought it was a good but unnecessary SW film.

Hallowed Blight was a lore based event with a lot of work out into it. This is a new year's celebration. Last time (year of the dog) it only had two cosmetics. A mask for Huntress and a jacket for David. That's it. This event is better than last year's, has three entire outfits you can get for free, and you're still finding a way to complain about it. Some of you people never ceases to amaze me.

i havent got haddonfield yet, its like fate is protecting me

Yeeeeeep
---
When you start playing for hundreds or thousands of hours, you start to see general trends with different characters. Often Claudette players are the most toxic
---
Well that must not have gone too well, given he wasn't playing it when I just checked. o.o
---
"I can't see shit."
---
PS4 as well.
---
I've tried Nurse a few times, and it's awful if you're not playing her routinely. Even if you're an experienced Killer (playing since 1.9.8) Nurse's playstyle isn't easy to pick up on in a single game of her. I *did* get Adept Nurse because the survivors screwed themselves over.
---
For survivors: Stop acting surprised if you get tunneled and repeatedly hooked after clicking your flashlight at me. You wanted my attention and I'm giving it to you until you die.
---
yeah lol he played two games, looked at legion, adams and jesus perks and then got off
---
Not always the correct strategy, definitely depends on the killer. Also nothing more frustrating than when someone runs away when I have that fast healing perk on
---
Honestly having butterface Meg above tits and ass blonde bombshell Kate makes me think you have no clue what you're talking about
---
i‚Äôd recommend Whispers, A nurse‚Äôs calling, Monitor and abuse and enduring. The pig doesnt have a lot of mobility so BBq&amp;C isnt really a must need on her! (unless you are going for BP ofcourse)
---
There's no such thing as OP on Freddy.
---
And honestly it depends on the skill level of your friends. Freddy himself is pretty annoying for low skill players.
---
The only build I ever use on him is Sloppy, Thanato, Franklin's, and BBQ with Z Block and Pill Bottle.
---
As killer you tend to find a few survivors but a lot of them are usually in a different region so they end up backing out because of ping, so pretty much same story for killer
---
I stopped watching him because all I saw him play was fortnite and I can‚Äôt stand that game. I‚Äôm glad he plays dbd again 
---
I personally run everywhere and let the timer run out when in hiding, repairing a generator, cleansing a totem and etcetera 
---
Oof
---
#acelivesmatter
---
Also inb4 anyone says just message him he had his profile setting to private so I just hope this reaches him
---
This is why you need a survivor with you that you don't like very much.
---
You can offer them as a sacrifice instead
---
Small/ineffective genitals.
---
These past 2 updates have been hell as a survivor. I only play with ransoms and literally 90% of my matches results in some Dc‚Äôing within the first minute, and then everyone suicides. Then the killer gets mad at us all because he made 8k and waisted his ultra rare add one plus a mori lmfao this game is a mess and this is rank 8-15 for me
---
Good perk idea.  If killer finds sayori in a locker, the killer is distorted (clown poison effect) for 30 seconds, 5 min cd.
---
That's the grind though. If it was given to you easier you wouldn't work as much and you'd get burnt out quicker.
---
The grind is good.
---
The chad. he has no perks because a real chad wouldnt use any perks and always loops the killer for 5 gens while sprinkling emotes in there with insane 9000IQ plays that only a true intellectual genius could ever comprehend.
---
I wish jason was a killer. I mean hes basically trapper.  Maybe a skin? 
---
He played for a bit, called the game shit, and then played witch it. Wonderful.
---
The killer will have to restart the entire game and will lose all bloodpoints and progress on their account
---
Something something r/Dbdgonewild
---
&gt; It always slows the game down.
---
By how much?
---
Yeah, it would be cool if he even got his own game. Maybe some other games could take inspiration of his character too
---
Did you by any chance check his hours? This is pretty easily obtainable if he has a lot of time in the game.
---
Then you get that smart ass that messages you saying ‚Äúu trash!‚Äù
---
Taking notes* 
---
I can't, private profile.
---
&gt;No other hacks
---
&gt;Only on shape and doctor
---
&gt;Some things he doesn't even have 100 of
---
&gt;Is literally a streamer
---
Yep, sounds like a hacker to me, report him to the FBI.
---
*fully charges blink*
---
*moves literally one inch*
---
**FUCK**
---
When I get destroyed in other games, I go to DBD and play killer and do shit like this to get my frustrations out 
---
Then you can‚Äôt report him as it‚Äôs quite likely he didn‚Äôt hack. The only thing I‚Äôll give you is that it‚Äôs odd he has exactly 100 of most of those offerings.
---
"good players" here means players who can loop the killer good. Not those who are good at gens.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Unrelenting is absolutely terrible though? 
---
Bruh what
---
Weebs superior, legion inferior
---
This is what happens when you focus 
---
I mean it‚Äôs really not much different than a survivor dc‚Äôing mid game due to who the killer is or whatever. 
---
That's why it shouldn't be a hex. It should just be a perk. I have an idea. It should be opposite of thanatophobia. More the number of people injured, repair speed should increase. Speed should increase further if people are either hooked or slugged.
---
I got to rank 12! I've never been at a rank other than the lowest in any video game I've played, so making it to a whole new color was really really cool. And I didn't immediately lose it, either! I'm having so much fun playing this game, and it's really new to know I'm not half bad at it
---
Joestar killer confirmed
---
I just saw those 2 killers, he may have the same amount on the others. Btw all of them are prestige 3 but nothing odd about that.
---
Yeah, because it's easy to get 100 red memento mori.
---
A streamer with only 3 viewers (2 if I don't count myself). He also don't save any of his streams.
---
Ikr, no one exploit this game neither use hacks, I'm so dumb for asking this question.
---
No, it really isn't. For example, if you 360 a killer, unrelenting can be the difference between getting the hit and not. Just because it doesn't fit into your build, doesn't mean it's terrible. 
---
Oh, sorry if I came off as rude, but I too am glad there‚Äôs more in this event. From what I heard, the event sounds fun and competitive. Hope you do well in it.
---
Uhh, there's your answer.
---
&gt;A streamer with only 3 viewers (2 if I don't count myself). He also don't save any of his streams.
---
Well, this could've been yourself for context. I will admit this does make it a bit more fishy.
---
Tell me, Megboy... have you ever experienced the mighty 78 STAB WOUND BEATING?!
---
Does Reddit really hate people playing Freddy?
---
Haven't had any basement bugs yet that I've noticed. What's happening  there?
---
That face tho
---
Just hit boxes 
---
Pig being in the game is what got me to get dbd in the first place, Amanda has always been my goddess and I learned her first
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
OINK
---
NOED has a counter, breaking totems. It's a good counter because you can fully prevent its effects.
---
Ahahaha nice
---
Look at me...
---
I am the GPU now. 
---
People saying only certain builds are viable now is just an exhibit of old habits. If you are being conservative and not taking unnecessary risks most builds will get the job done. Killer main fyi
---
I think the devs said one of the future killers is from medieval times
---
Honestly freddy is a mixed bag, his invisibility is strong af and being to track outside terror radius is strong af But he is easy to loop etc because of the dreamworld transition. I think he's weak to verse but super obnoxious to play against... Same with legion. 
---
I love knight!
---
Joke's on the cop, Myers getting loads of stalk in the back seat!
---
Yeah I dont think my friend really thinks he is super strong at all times, just that playing against him can be annoying
---
Haha I‚Äôm sorry your time with Bubba is not the best, maybe one day you shall love LF and waddle around with happiness :)
---
I didn't say it gave extra reach. I said that when you 360 a killer, unrelenting will allow them to recover faster and attack again. I've 360ed killers at windows and just barely made it through it before they could hit me again. Unrelenting would've gotten that hit. And unrelenting has other uses such as missing attacks in general. Again, just because you specifically can't put it to use correctly, doesn't make it bad. 
---
He's like Meyers in a way. You can't be very altruistic early and you have to immerse when you play against him.
---
I agree with this 100%.
---
I used to play Final Fantasy XIV and they had a similar system. Dropping three times in a row resulted in a 30 minute ban from re-queuing. I think this game needs something similar as the queues are long enough without finally getting into a game only to have people quit instantly or because they got downed near the beginning.

---
Yes, but it also wastes survivors time greatly. Either way, you're gonna get use out of noed. There's no loss. DS can also be fully countered by dribbling or if they miss. 
---
Amanda believes people cannot be redeemed and they should all die an inescapable death. In the movies she outright murdered people in John's games. It fits her character.
---
They come in two forms: incredibly toxic and can loop or incredibly toxic and cant loop and waits for hatch then goes ggez baby killer. I had a claudette today who locker hopped while i was in a chase with another surivor for at least a 80 seconds(a full gen and there was only 1 gen left anyways) and i realized what she was doing when i checked all gens and nothing was being worked on. So i let the other survivor escape hatch once i found the claudette and killed her.
---
Yeah fuck you.
---
A lot of us are loaded with them from the Christmas event so we say "why not" and bring em in. 
---
I got news for you, the game isn't designed to be fun 100% of the time. There are specifically designed situations where you aren't supposed to have fun, you're supposed to be punished. 
---
And I agree with the above commenter that D/Cing in those situations is just you being a little bitch. Just like killers who D/C when the've been looped for too long or their hex gets cleansed, they are also little bitches and probably following the same logic you are with this "Im not having fun every second of this match so naturally I must quit" 
---
Sounds like the killer got the better of you and/or your have a garbage team. And if you're team is really bad then maybe I can understand. But I hope you aren't literally D/Cing every time a killer slugs you. Because then thats just idiotic and I'll stop sympathizing with you.
---
To be fair it's not like they ban on pc anyway for lagswitching lul
---
Agreed. It feels that way through almost all of the back stories for all of the characters and they all have gotten progressively worse as the game has continued to get more of these characters. It's very clear that BHVR has no idea what they are doing, and also don't really care. Even in terms of simple lore, nevermind game mechanics. 
---
This is the best one so far
---
THE BURDEN OF \[carrying this team\] IS TOO GREAT FOR ROLF!
---
Loved friday 13th game. Im mean its not serious like dbd, but the movies were always a little goofy too.  Too bad it died. 
---
Worked on me, that's for sure lol
---
Love it
---
ahhh how do i pm on reddit 
---
It's a solid strat, not gonna lie. 
---
I supported your post until I found this piece of cringe. Grow up kid.
---
the lunar event is bonus points only with offering + completing objectives similar to the prev blight event. it was teased that the valentine event will be something like a rush of blood x1.5 event 
---
Guys, he's level 91. There's no way he can prestige two killers and collect this many add-ons.
---
What's wrong with the both of you
---
just rework them.
---
*Or DC or tell people to kill themselves in post-game chat
---
Sorry for that I'll hide this post now
---
Why the downvotes? He literally hovered over his trap.
---
Exactly 100 of every item. Obvious hacked save file. Also, player level 91 but none of those offerings are newer than 2.0 soooo 
---
I also want to point out that killers going for 4k DON'T hook the third kill, they slug them and go after the fourth. That way they can make sure they secure the kill by preventing someone from camping the hatch. Don't like it? Tough titty, survivors playing full immersion to hold a game hostage on the off chance they get their survival points by going through the hatch is to blame, not the killer. The killer is merely adapting to the meta where two people create an unbearable standoff, and the killer wants blood points.
---
Don't like it? Then play more proactive, do generators and force the killer to do something stupid. Force things like Unbreakable and No Mither into the meta so the killer HAS to hook downed survivors because they can't guarantee they'll be there. Otherwise you're the one to blame for not thinking outside of "Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, Self Care, Balanced Landing" carbon copy meta builds that I see constantly.
---
What I don't understand is how the survivors REFUSE TO ADAPT and force a stale ass meta, then blame it on the killers for adapting and merely changing the decisions they make to counter. Killers play far more varied and believe it or not don't always run NOED. The only perk you have to worry about honestly almost 100% is BBQ and Chilli. There is no reason to not run it since it gives blood points AND information. Even then you can play around BBQ.
---
The point I'm making is survivors HAVE options to end that stalemate, and they refuse to utilize them because they HAVE to run the same four perks over and over despite it being proven quite reliably that survivors don't need perks or items to rank up, its easy as fuck to rank as a survivor. You have the tools to end the "four-minute slugfest" on your own, but you chose to run different perks.
---
Well the Killer decided he didn't want to let one person go, he wanted everyone. 
---
that^
---
just like insta-instaheals. 
---
Probably hacked his save since it is exactly 100, but you can't prove it so meh... 
---
Why not just a perma ban?  It'll easily thin out the herd of players that think it's cool to abandon a bad match.  
---
And that‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt do as Hag. Works every time.
---
your ability to adapt to survivor/killer play style
---
are you the type of killer that chases the toxic player around the map while gens are done
---
are you the type of survivor that stops doing gens to save a hooked survivor across the map
---
meh to be honest play the game the way you want  LOL
---
It's a bug, even if it's just a mistyping, mistakes happen and this is hardly the big issue to deal with.
---
He's honestly my fav killer, I like the overall theme and look of him. Hes very controversial. His power puts you in a frenzy mode where you can vault pallets like survivors. When you strike a survivor it puts them into a "deep wounds" status where they have to "mend" themselves. It takes about 10secs to mend yourself but you can up that time with certain add ons. Once you strike a survivor with the frenzy it'll show you blips of the other survivors in a certain range (idk the exact range). The intended purpose of the power is to hit a survivor, hit other survivors then tunnel one survivor and hit him again (which will stop the frenzy, but will deplete the deep wounds bar faster) so with every frenzy hit it'll deplete the bar. Or if they don't mend themselves they will go into the injured stare and you'll see a blip where he fell at. Also while you're chasing a survivor the bar will NOT deplete, (think of it as the new borrowed time) so I mean you can just moon walk and follow the scratch marks if you want. Imo he's fun to play, I absolutely love him. His movement speed is 4.4 so he's slow compared to somebody like trapper and he's short so (idk if that'll bother you). He's weak at the lower ranks (rank 7-1) unless you have good add-ons and perks. But if you do have good perks then he's fun and viable depending on you play style. Survivor mains complain that there's no counter play against him which I guess is kind of true but then again the nurse doesn't have much counter play either so hit and miss I guess. To me tho he's fun to play and the overall theme of him is great. I'm sure you'd like him. Although I will say his good cosmetics (2 other characters) are dlc and cost like $10 I think so idk if that bothers you. But it's all up to you.
---
I can't believe people are downvoting you about t1 being the best
---
Yea I agree like if they do it too many times they get perma banned
---
If people are queuing as SWF, one could be rank 1 survivor and the other could be rank ~17, and if you're rank ~10 it'll "average" out and put you in against a rank 1. It's idiotic. That's most likely why you're seeing extremely high ranks compared to yours. 
---
Actually, he is P3 in all his killers.
---
I feel like these devs are Linux users since 2.5.0 would indicate an unstable developmental build. Makes a lot of sense after seeing how bad the patch is.
---
The problem with the Ebony Mori is how people perceive the game. They go into every match thinking every game will be fair. *It won‚Äôt*.
---
He should have just chainsawed the claudette by the dog bowl.
---
I would love one
---
Probably I assume it would have defense based perks because knights wear armor
---
I mean last time I checked, killer perks were meant to hurt survivors lol.
---
 Cleansing a totem takes 14 seconds per totem. If each player just does them as they go, then there isn't a huge issue unless the killer is forcing major pressure, in which you have to make calls on what is needed at that point.
---
Totems and NOED are perfectly fine, NOED is a strong perk that can get shut down early or can punish a team otherwise. It's not hard to break totems, especially if you do them between gens or chases.
---
when there's a new template, everyone does that everywhere because it's what you do with memes since the dawn of times. oh sweet years on 4chan in 2006-2008
---
My go to fun is Freddy, but he's quite shite at high ranks. My second fun killer (and a strong mid-teir one at that) is Amanda (The Pig), since she can toy and scare the survivors in a way no other killer can.
---
A lot of people here are saying Micheal, which while I do find fun, doesn't provide a lot interaction with his power. It's up to you, but I would go for the Saw Chapter.
---
The amount of salt in this thread alone is so satisfying :P 
---
I love the killers everyone hates :P 
---
I don't understand. I have shit loads of killer offerings from the Christmas Event. If he plays Myers there's nothing suspicious. I have about 40 moris left from event with Myers alone? That event was absolutely ridiculously made for killers. Every bloodweb packed with the best.
---
As for all 100's they are not. There is a 101 too. Nevertheless this is a normal thing for many humans to do. To try and round collections at the same number? I do this too? 
---
I don't get what you mean by player level either? What has his player level got to do with the offerings that are currently available?
---
No room for 'it's legit' here, then. You could take a DBD Support ticket out on him, with some saved footage.
---
nope its not 
---
No I don‚Äôt think so it might be like the Halloween event where you got ‚Äòcurrency‚Äô and could buy skins or where you get shards or blood points 
---
I thought the bloody outfits would make it easier to find people. Does it actually make it harder?
---
Just because a perk works doesn't mean that it's useful or good at all. 
---
Old surveillance worked. It doesn't mean it was useful in the slightest, it was a garbage perk that barely did anything, just like unrelenting it currently.
---
Working doesn't equal useful. It's the power of the effect and the use it allows that decide it's useful and rating.
---
I am proud of my killer heritage, on console i own all the killers via auric cells so i disnt get any survivors
---
Not in my experiences lol, my team mates ignore me and let me die/they swarm like insects
---
Looping in that game is a complete joke too with some areas having 5+ pallets, its nuts
---
Not punishable. It‚Äôs (unfortunately) a part of the game.
---
I'm saying that it's EXTREMELY unlikely that he got this legit, if you go through a few bloodwebs after hacking your save file then of course you're gonna get a few stray 101s.
---
so uh, what does kate have todo with the legion?
---
For survivors. If you are going to unhook a survivor within distance of me you can be sure i will tunnel
---
It is obvious how she is. Anyone who defends her are no better than her. She is no better than a bully who picks on kids and actually she probably has bullied some kid playing DBD. She reminds me of the movie Mean Girls. There is absolutely no excuse for her behavior. None. You want a clip go watch her. Period. It‚Äôs not that hard. Why does she cover her rank? Yeah it‚Äôs not rocket science. Her and people like her are one of the main problem with this game. DBD needs to do something about the deranking &amp; people like her. Not give her Fog Whispers. Come on DBD it is people like her that is ruining your game. Complaining about not having people to play in higher ranks is bologna. Stop with the excuses. We are sick of hearing them. 
---
I just get "face camped" literally every round since the game controls like ass on my phone. Its a really fun game, but the major deal breaker is the Wraith killer that spawns the fog AS YOU DO ENCODERS. So im literally punished for doing my job
---
Make sure you play survivor and learn the tricks of the trade, it really improves your killer game by leaps and bounds.
---
Why would you want to mori someone who‚Äôs dead on hook? Morris are meant to help the killer.
---
You can location check totems. Each sector of a map has a totem typically, once you develop the understanding of the spawns, they become easier to find and perks that rely on hexes become much weaker
---
&gt;Am I supposed to not do gens so i can run around and count crushed bones?
---
Do people just... forget detective's hunch exists?
---
how do you download a reddit video post i need this
---
I have played plenty of survivors still, kinda awkard having 3 friends who have the game and all main survivors but hate custom games
---
When you play as killer and it gives you the game
---
Small Game exists. Plus, survivors aren't meant to know what's going on in the match 24/7, that includes the risk of not all the totems being cleansed/NOED in general.
---
What would his perks be though? Unlike Trapper he is a slugging killer...Then there's the power...
---
Jeff was too hard to draw and she had a snow outfit. It makes sense! Shh! Shhh!
---

Hi Jee, please send me a private message before they're all claimed and let me know where to send it!
---
I‚Äôve been having this same issue, but with Nea. Got to level 50 with only having Tier 1. She‚Äôs already back to level 39 and still only has Tier 1. I‚Äôm buying all the perks, so I just don‚Äôt understand. 
---
You can always use a PO box, work address, or the address of a trusted friend if that makes you feel better. :) Also, I'm a Freddy main, so I guess I'm already in your dreams or something. Mwahaha.
---
Are you a console player?
---
You act like that's a bad thing
---
I know how the system works but I didn't know the slang I guess lol. Thanks mister 
---
No Decisive? OoO
---
Freddy feels OP to new players because he cant really be stealthed, and they have no idea how to lead chases
---
My counter to 360s is to not lunge attack.
---
As for Trapper perk suggestions, Brutal Strength, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, BBQ&amp;Chilli.
---
Tenacity is also visually bugged. The animation doesn‚Äôt play correctly. But hey, they are just two forces characters with forced perks that *no one uses*.
---
JJBA Part 9: Darkness Among Us confirmed.
---
I'd watch that tbh.
---
Oh my god who cares if he camped move on. Campers know its shitty they dont carw
---
Doesn‚Äôt everyone? /s
---
can you get banned for prestige glitching on pc?  
---
This is too loud, thanks.
---
Happens surprisingly often. Not gonna lie.
---
That wasn‚Äôt a joke though? All I said was that you were exaggerating a shit-ton. 
---
How do people still bitch about flashlights. The only way you get blinded during a pickup is if the survivor with it is right infront of you when you pick them up.
---
Use lightborn, face a wall hell even just turn around at this point. Or just bait the flashlighter and look around beforehand. If you get blinded while picking up you fucked up 
---
I LOVE NEA
---
Then why'd you say thank you?
---
Thanks for the great response! You‚Äôve given me a lot to think about
---
This only applies if you trap them past the pillars. If you trap them behind the pillars you can carry them to the escape line and stand there.they struggle off and cross the threshold it kills them.
---
Inb4 you get perma banned for your PC crashing.
---
Or any other incident.
---
Its really shitty thinking that as a rank 19 got paired with a 15 (lowest surv rank) and badically all of them have a perk advantage over my shitty noed lvl 1.
---
I May like one, hope i got here in time :P. 
---
Not dodging. I just don't really understand your POV.
---
NNED
---
That's true. But with KYF you have all the perks and items and everything else already, so people are already playing that mode. It's just for groups of people, while the other is for singles (or groups I guess) 
---
This. I had originally wanted bikini meg, but everyone complained that it "didn't fit with the lore"
---
So for a year or two now i've settled with booty shorts. Fits with the lore, etc.
---
Of course i don't think the devs feel the same way 
---
https://i.imgur.com/21SBKFW.png
---
:(
---
His ability doesn't help him in chases. Also, he has the same lunge as other killers.
---
Monika next killer confirmed
---
To be fair you are the only one being toxic here. Tunnelling is cheap and toxic. I understand why survivors choose to DC against killers like this. Choosing to play with a p3 Claudette in itself isn't a toxic action and does not mean those players are toxic.
---
I will say though, their does seem to be from my experience a higher chance that they are a bunch of cunts. 
---
You get 3 full outfits and you can unlock all 3 for free, unlike The Hallowed Blight where you could only get 2.
---
It is for the amount of people left in the game, but that also includes the killer 
---
For one person left you need 2 gens done 
---
For two people left you need 3 gens done 
---
For three people left you need 4 gens done
---
For four people left you need 5 gens done 
---
For hatch to appear:
---
4 people = all gens completed
---
3 people = 4 gens 
---
2 people = 3 gens
---
1 person = 2 gens
---
K Thanks for The answerüòä
---
And id much rather have faster queues than wait for everyone to be exactly my rank
---
Then go ahead.Noone stops you.
---
you can check the killers size, speed and radius on his bio page
---
idk the key for pc but it should be right bttn on the d pad for console unless you changed your bttn layout
---
What's the deal with "respecting pallets"? 
---
yeah, I'll take it but I think the OG directors woulda been better. 
---
It was completely unfun for me. Especially since I didn't have Iron Grasp on any killers higher than, like, level 15. 
---
His name is David, David Tapp
---
you're very young 
---
Just tunnel the bad players and ignore him honestly if they‚Äôre gonna play dirty you play dirty.
---
Well not really. The issue is the learning curbe for killers is dumb
---
 Killers pip and double pip quite easily. So new killers face noob survivors and wreck them while double pipping. This gives killers this big power feel. Then the start to struggle against half decent survivors but still pip everygame. At about rank 10 they start getting obliterated by survivors much better than them but they still safety pip
---
I have rank 1 achievements on both sides. I suck as a survivor... and as a killer. We need rank 0 for those who don't suck.
---
Yeah, on console Nurse is barely a threat
---
I sometimes like to spare Tapp in hopes that "He'll see the light" and come around to the Pig's way of thinking. May the world see Kramer's original vision. Oink!
---
&gt; valentine event 
---
Will there be a event? Right next day after Lunar event ends? It's hard to believe, to be honest
---
How is it unfun. Chase and down them, nice long game where gens arent being powered out quickly. Hooks will come back eventually and its a different kinda game to norm
---
Yeah like you said, helpful but not impossible. I get it, it's an advantage killer's don't get but as someone who does enjoy playing both roles and enjoys it, I think it's a bit ridiculous that people who only play killer act like swf is the worst thing that ever happened this game. Like I said earlier, I'm basing it off my own experience of hanging around rank 10 on bother survivor and killer. Swf could be worse in lower ranks, idk. 
---
I hate huntress, but when her daily comes up, I go balls deep. No addons, no perks except unrelenting. I usually end up murdering people with her, cuz they underestimate the power of a well placed throw.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/The_Heartbeat#Terror_Radii_of_Killers
---
Who tf needs to look up how to unplug an Ethernet cable??
---
Stop chasing good players then. No one is forcing you to chase someone who is obviously better than you
---
Legion is slow and tedious if you play him as intended, and cheesy and brokenly strong if you just use strong add ons or cheese strats. He's also a bad killer to learn early on as he actively ignores a lot of the points to develop fundamental killer skills.
---
You can always dodge queues from SWF but it won't change that you will face rank 1 players, the derank issue is real and you see it everytime if you want to win go for the easy prey first, if you want to punish that kind of behavior tunnel and sacrifice the good guy, try to make him not have fun (and I have no problem trying to make the game unfun for derankers)
---
YEAAAAAAAAAAH
---
touche 
---
Unless they changed something (which I don't think they did) freddy interacts with the real world while on the dream. Meaning you can see him walking with mudsplats/grass. Which is something that requires attention but what else would you pay attention to? 
---
Lunar event ends on 13th, and it's the day of rank reset. So, I just don't understand where Valentine's event should be in that timeline. 
---
I mean, putting Valentine event a week after Valentine's day is... stupid?
---
And, considering that 14th is Thursday, and new skins are out on Wednesday, I'd say "event" will be just a new skins in the store.
---
Am i blind, where was the teabag
---
Because god forbid people talk to their friends lmao
---
Stay out of his terror radius, most Legion players respect pallets because of the ability to vault. Try to break the line of sight when he's in Frenzy because scratch marks are not visible. If you have SB use it only after Legion uses Frenzy. 
---
If you dodge p3 claudettes youre doing something wrong
---
I can‚Äôt copy/paste it. Mobile pleb.
---
Hm you can prestige almost all killers at rank 1. Prestige came before rank, also unless you make absolutely no BP every game you can prestige easily to P3 a few killers before level 91. He is clearly cheating but thats just due to the obvious 100 of everything, no one collects the exact same amount of items of everything.
---
Or the new Halloween Myers, which would be a neat mask to have in game!
---
Depends on your settings but is always loud
---
10 minutes lobbies? My reaction would be to uninstall the game. 50%+ of time would be wasted on waiting, pre-match countdown, match loading, post-match screens...

Lots of streamers hacked the game, it was way easier back then and well, streamers usually have big ego and want to show off, goes hand in hand with cheating save files.

There isn't a need for a fix. It's fine the way it is. If you're hardcore and want to p3 for bloody clothes and .0001% more ultra-rares go for it. If you want all the perks just stay p1 and keep buying perks past 50.
---
I dont think ive seen a ggez in a long long time. Ive had plenty of bad games. I have no idwa how every game is a ggez for you.
---
Also if your a 2 perk rank 15 hag swf probably isnt your only issue. You are gonna struggle till you improve against most survivors
---
It's not about how toxic he is or the state of the community, it's more on the fact that he was toxic and encouraged his entire fanbase to *be just like* ***him***. That in turn damaged the experience for new players, who would be dissuaded from playing by his cult following that would torment those just wanting to enjoy themselves.
---
She's ugly and stinks
---
I would do the math for you, but I'm just going to hope you take me at my word when I say I actively tried to do this on PS4 for LF from Level 6, and made it to level 128 without succeeding.
---
Seems very harsh, his message was something on the lines of ‚Äúusing exploits to get a competitive edge‚Äù 
---
10 minute lobbies was just a random number i threw out there. Im sure that if they had a matchmaking system where they looked for people AROUND your rank or playtime (don‚Äôt think playtime is possible tho), it wouldn‚Äôt take 10 minutes.
---
Plus, it mostly hurts swf as they have to wait to play with more people. Possibly just have you able to opt out of 4 man swf? That way people can still play with some of their friends, while still losing coordination, and also keeping their queue time low. 
---
What?
---
i guess you're right well just have to wait and see lol 
---
Most of the time it's that it's cancer to play as or against him. The dream world is garbage, takes too long to transition giving them a free head start on maneuvering to a loop. He's also not super quick, so it can be a bit difficult to close the chases. For the survivors, being stuck in dream world not getting skill checks can be brutal. Also, the fact that you can't see freddy when awake it's rare to be able to tell if he's camping the hook (which SO freaking many do) or even following someone all the way to the save, often opting for a tunnel rather than going after the one rescuing. In the end, both sides are often salty after the game.
---
They could have a new legacy prestige cosmetic for it but even then I don't think this suggestion is good. Prestige is not to be worth, it is exactly that prestige. It is supposed to be a grind (even though its not that hard if you play regularly and can stock up 1m before). I rather get everyone to 50 first then maybe I'll prestige my favorite characters.
---
well its a good alternative if you haven't unlocked the perk via shrine or have spirit tho
---
Don‚Äôt heal against m2 Legions. it‚Äôs better to just mend and do gens against those braindead Legions. Time gets wasted menidng AND healing. Only exception is when the Legion your playing against has frankies. 
---
Save SB for after feral frenzy. Use Dead hard wisely. 
---
Always know where the killer is. If you know he‚Äôs going your way then hide. If he has Irri button (you‚Äôll know, trust me) just run
---
Loop whenever he‚Äôs not using feral frenzy. He can‚Äôt vault over pallets without it. Others can get 2 or 3 gens done in thet time you loop him. Try not to waste pallets either. You need them against a good Legion.
---
if he starts moonwalking and you leave the chase, know that‚Äòs a huge rip. You‚Äôll mostly likely die if you have deep wound.
---
I am the only PC player I know that got banned, only 2 days and it already expired, but I got the message 'Using exploits or errors in design in order to gain a competitive advantage'
---
Bloody prestige clothing is a competitive advantage LUL
---
I was about to comment 'I havent played on it yet' while I was searching for a game and got haddonfield, my ears well enough fell off
---
I played with an Adam that unhooked me in front of the killer he wasn't even camping he just didn't get a chance to walk away yet, knowing full well the killer would go after me and he'd have deliverance later, but ok. 
---
Why even thought it was a great idea. "Oh it didn't worked for other maps with hills so maybe it will for this one"
---
I would say it depends on the killer too, sometimes you don't want someone knowing where you are when a gen is done, like if you're Wraith or Pig.
---
IMMA SMASH THAT CLOWN ASS
---
I'd also like to add: If a survivor unhooks someone right in front of me, I will down the hooked person and slug them. Then I will down the survivor that was too dense to wait until I've left to save the other one. 
---
Killers aren't camping if you don't even give them time to walk away before you save someone. And I'm sure as hell not leaving if I see your huge trail of scratchmarks leading directly around the hook before I've even gotten out of the animation.
---
Have some finesse.
---
He has brainwashed 500k people to think ochido is a god
---
But what annoys me the most is that he made those 500k say ¬´baby killer DUUUUD ez¬ª
---
If you were rank 3. I dont know how perks are hitting you so hard. Perks help a killer a lot but you shouldnt need ruin or other perks to do well. Especially on hag, perks can make her god like bit shes good without perks. Perks matter more to m1 killers
---
Lmao 
---
I understand what you're saying. But do you play killer? Did you play killer during the event and realise how many top red and purple addons/offerings you were getting on each bloodweb?
---
If you play a lot of killer it really does not take long to prestige. Especially with double or more blood points (2x event; BBQ; offerings). I prestiged various survivors in the event as I play a lot of survivor. 
---
But I also play killer and I spent bp on my Myers. I was getting shit loads of red and purple offerings in each bloodweb with those mystery boxes. I decided to prestige my Myers and took him to level 48 again. Right now a month after the event I have around 40 ebony moris and 15 + each of fragrant tufts and Judith's Tombstones.
---
If I only played killer during the event I would easily have hit 100 plus of these. I decided to waste my bp getting other survivors to P3 instead.
---
I I did not play this with friends so much during the event I would have maimed killer and I would have put all bp into Myers, Pig, and Freddy. Maybe Hag too.
---
Amazing the downvotes for saying this person might not be hacking and stating a fact that it would be possible to get that many addons/offerings in that fucked up event lol.
---
What did you do if you don‚Äôt mind me asking ? The prestige thing ?
---
Yeah, that's all. I don't use items so I don't care, and I think that would be crossing the line for me anyway.

&gt; Im sure that if they had a matchmaking system where they looked for people AROUND your rank
---
That's how it works (more or less) now. Wait time are higher during off-peak hours and at lowest/highest ranks, because there are not enough players there. System is kinda wonky for SWF groups with wide range of ranks in them.
---
Opting out of playing vs SWF would be a bad thing to implement, because that'd lead to serious cut in player numbers.
---
Prove thyself doesnt make gens any faster from what it was. The perk got nerfed not buffed
---
How many times did you do it ? 
---
no comment
---
Hoseok is too pure for this game
---
Fair enough, just curious what be don‚Äôt it once, just curious how they are detecting it, like spending 3 million in 30 seconds or something. 
---
Shush dude
---
I can't say I was wondering, but your consideration is appreciated
---
can we just stop talking about him and move on. all this does is give him more attention 
---
So you‚Äôre saying Ruin, enduring, spirit fury, haunted grounds, make your choice, NOED, bloodhound, sloppy butcher, and other perks I‚Äôm probably forgetting, hold little to no value in the game, and every single good killer should be able to get at least 2 kills every game without them? 
---
Every killer except billy leatherface and huntress is an m1 killer. Their powers augment how their m1 is used, but thats it.
---
I don't know dude, I already had most of my characters P3, but one of my friends literally went from having 3 P3 characters to having 26 P3 within 20 minutes lol
---
So an entire 4 man telling everyone where your traps are and where you are in relation to them as a stealth killer isn‚Äôt incredibly broken and ruins their viability? Every killer in the game is good or great, except for those killers who are DESTROYED by swf. 
---
Actual decent quality art here? Hmwho broke the matrix?
---
First of all, we need to know what perks OP has. He can maybe try impossible skillchecks on doctor or end game freddy or speed wraith. But I don't really know if he has enough perks. 
---
But in general, bitter murmur is better on killers that can get to gen extra fast and use it's advantage. I.e. nurse, billy or maybe spirit. Freddy doesn't need it, because he has aura reading in dream state. Doctor doesn't need it because his madness will show you surv location. Wrait is like maybe the only one, that can use it, but I still think it is limited. Rancor is better in that case imo. 
---
&gt; So an entire 4 man telling everyone where your traps are and where you are in relation to them as a stealth killer 
---
That's a higher than average level of communication for a typical SWF group.
---
Not all swf groups are a special ops team, lol. 
---
No, it isn‚Äôt. You must either be playing with people you THINK are swf, or against the worst players on the actual planet. Anyone half competent will tell people where things are. 
---
You must be playing against trash swf, because every 4 man ive played against as any stealth or trap killer has been spanked. 
---
...how the hell would they do that?

Most brutal mori of the game imo.
---
Not sure what you mean by scrumptious BP builds but I usually run on Wraith Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's Calling as the barebones of my build, then it depends I'm still missing a lot of perks on him but NOED is pretty good, so is BBQ, I really enjoy deerstalker but thats useless if you don't actually bait people with it, I could see pop goes the weasel being great on him (overcharge is better at lower ranks since people actually miss it) or surveillance I don't like hex ruin on him maybe if you run speed addons to better protect it. But it really depends on what you got and what's your play style
---
It‚Äôs always neas, fuck neas
---
Hag might eat your guts, but there is just something horrifying of that moment when the survivors reach up and go, "Oh shit, this axe is on my face, guess it's over, isn't it?"
---
Murmur is okay, and BBQ is the only killer perk you should ever run for BP
---
Your missing the point, all you can do is assume his direction because he's completely invisible... That's his biggest strength. Its not like wraith where there's a silhouette and you can make a deduction of where you can hide to. Freddy you can't tell if he's seen you or not or whether you actually going in a good direction to hide vs him...and then this is where its frustrating for freddy because he has to pull you into the dream world before he can hit you and then you hope you don't get into an instant loop area because of the dream world transition. It's a messy gameplay style with him. 
---
How dare you abuse the shitty game we can't fix! Maybe we allowed players to glitch themselves into unintended positions, but we'll ban you if you dare to do that
---
Yeah how dare they play with their less experienced friends.

I love you.

I have the same problem, I loaded into a 3 man game as killer so I thought I may aswell let them farm. I went and stood on a hill and spin around in circles to show I was friendly. I then went to find the survivors to farm but when I approached the gen they ran. I then just stood and hit the gen to indicate to do it to no avail. They tbagged me thinking I was chasing. In the end I got fed up and killed all 3.
---
Its not exclusive to killers, pipping on survivor is also that easy (not double pip though). That being said if you play killer at rank 15 you will most likely get derankers, people that just want to abuse low skilled killers. Rank 10 is probably an easier rank since you dodge that but you're not at SWF rank yet. Also this guys has 100 hours, he is not on the start of the learning curve unless he's a potato.
---
Also, when you get all perks, you will notice major differences between the same killer with different builds. 
---
All we need is your mom's credit card number, the expiration date, and the three numbers on the back.
---
Tomorrow 7pm GMT.
---
Ranking up as a survivor has the problem thats irs harder to pip at low ranks. Survivors autopip at hogh ranks but low ranks are a challenge. Survivors generally know what they are doing by rank 10
---
Yes
---
And the reason killers should respect that is what exactly? Seems like I'm making things harder for myself. More frustrating too.
---
fuck 
---
oh ye ye
---
You may be good.. BUT CAN YOU TAKE THE ALLMIGHTY THREE K BEATING?!
---
Being serious for a moment, since the last totem placement update I feel like its much harder to find the Totem by accident. Even had 2 games on lampkin lane where I couldn't find it.
---
You've got some leeway since Huntress doesn't actually need add-ons. That said, the Exhaustion addons are shockingly powerful. Venomous Concontion and Rattlesnake Venom (I think it is.) Most people will go for the two wind-up ones though. Babushka and Manna Grass Braid. They're probably the best together, but a bit hard to notice individually.
---
To be fair, Myers is called a "Haunting" killer.
---
One DC a day keeps the nurses alway 
---
General Kenobi!
---
So basically, never down a survivor again unless you have hooked everyone so you don‚Äôt get called tunneler.
---
Unfortunately I haven't even touched Wraith yet. Still leveling up Nurse for perks.
---
Everyone get in line!
---
Nah I just started playing on my console and I'm pretty sure she went to do something else too, so I didn't waste that much.
---
Same, I guess it‚Äôs just bad killers who want to confirm a kill
---
Being tunneled sucks but I understand why people do it.
---
1. Dont heal  
---
2. If they frenzy hunt you run to the first pallet and camp it. Let them hit you and get the guaranteed stun (that way you deny them a double hit)  
---
3. Ds, Adrenaline and Unbreakable fucks them harder than any other killer since getting just 1 health state is like a full heal effectively  
---
My personal favourite is Billy. It's simple and not complex. But that might be because I'm OG.
---
It doesn't, it's straight up just a good perk
---
As I said you can a lot of the times deduct where he is based on those things.
---
Then there is nothing else to suggest, the FoV is really good
---
I honestly put dead hard as the best one even if it does sometimes not activate, purely because of how powerful that perk is since it essentially serves to erase one messup you make during a chase. Extending loops is also what makes it crazy good.
---
Then comes lithe wich is amazing to switch loops spots without taking any risk, it also can work like dead hard to save you from mistakes by giving you more distance on the fly.
---
Then SB/BL are at the same spot imo, both are good and works nice in their own ways, I find SB is only good when you are in an unsafe position, to get to a safe one quickly but I feel like it's a bad habit to have, as in you should always be near a safe spot ?
---
BL is very nice because of the "stun" reduction on falls and works just like SB, both are good but not as versatile as Dead hard or Lithe, but that's just my opinion.
---
That would be too hard.
---
Now you no longer have to alt tab over to pornhub whenever your weiner needs a good faping.
---
I usually only see people do it when I had a really bad game. Like they wanted to stick round just to rub it in my face. That's the behavior I consider toxic. Pallet loop, blind me, stun me but dont rub it in my face that I lost or dont dc on your third hook when I never tunneled or camped you. 
---
Man I love nurses that run ruin and noed with fast blinks or reach blinks.
---
Not its not... killers that have no idea what they're doing in rankn15 won't pip either. Its full of derankers and even without it the entire game is relying on the killer to actually do something, the time pressure is on him and killers of low rank have no idea how to use the time, if you just goof around as a survivor you will pip (9 min + 1 gen + whatever you can get of chaser/benevolent) they usually don't know how the ranking system works but that doesn't change the fact that if you play to pip its just as easy.
---
So stealthy he didn't even notice you. Nice.
---
Hmm makes sense. I hate going up against leatherface so bad that I refuse to even play him.
---
Ahaha alright will do.
---
Eerik its me
---
Lol I did indeed
---
That's exactly what they **don't** want - they will probably unban him tomorrow when the glitch is fixxed, leaving people in the unknown for the rest of today. People are scared of the unknown, so they won't try to abuse the glitch. It's only logical from BHVR's perspective, since this way they don't lose any customers whilst also not allowing the item economy to totally drift off. If everyone used this glitch to stockpile hundreds of ultra rares, BHVR would have to deal with a massive shitshow. 
---
I hate to be that guy but can you explain? I dont get it.
---
That's a little lewd man.

Teeeemu it's not me

Sex in public : Mad grit
---
Man it does lol
---
He is alright when played as intended, he is just bad without addons but even then its fun to switch the playstyle.
---
Yo she hella thicc my guy
---
She's the best killer in game but has a steep learning curve.  Everyone loses with her initially.  At this point your goal should be just practicing those blinks who cares how many people you kill learning her.  You also have the misfortune of playing her on xbox.  Unfortunately the horrific framerates on console make her that much harder especially on xbox which has the worst running version of the game.  Keep at it man don't get discouraged 
---
&gt;For killers: don't respect pallets
---
Don't. There is no reason to respect pallets.
---
Yeah but he recorder. Was only for the meme. /s
---
I think they can also helicopter out but only if God wants them
---
Cause usually freddy will me moonwalking or sidewalking away from you just enough for you to change the direction of your camera... the point is if you know where he is you can already predict him coming and you still got the transition window.
---
Shrine lots power over me Long ago, I bought all the dlc when pig was released and I only have like 40 levels amongst 3 characters until I have every teachable in the game (killer and survivor) 
---
Im still clean. But I didnt do it much tbh. No prestiges. Only a couple perks and bps
---
dosent the huntress have the mind of a 7 year old?
---
Have you seen this and the following parts?

---
You stop posting about Hol Horse for one post, and this is what happens? Shame on you.
---
Don't expect anyone to respect made up rules
---
Oh if only you had adrenaline and that was the 5th gen. There is few to no harder flexes than the "I was dying and you had me, but now look at me go" plays. 
---
it's all (5) of them for a 4 man team.
---
Man, its stuff like this that proves the point where people say that killers are underpowered/its not really a horror game.
---
Quite the opposite as a killer, I almost always face potatoes survivors wich gets really boring to me.
---
The rare times i get decent survs , their chases redeems all the shit ones I kept having.
---
These guys just keep running in circles in front of me  and it's annoying how it's hard to hit. How do you manage against people who just do that? I don't have a problem against people who run in straight lines. 
---
Same
---
Oh shoot I thought I got the clip where we did pop it
---
That would have been so mean
---
That mouth creeps me out
---
I'm pretty sure 99% of people are only doing it for the prestige though, which is what the PS4 perm-ban guy did.
---
When you see a secret killer offering.
---
She's my favorite to go up against.
---
&gt;implying the hag can't do shit without totems even though she is one of the best killers in the game
---
If you run Urban Evasion or Spine Chill/Prem then you suck
---
Forget that perk.  Urban promotes immersed useless teammates too afraid of their own shadow to touch a gen or complete an objective.  90% of them just crawl and hide around the map anytime the killer is within 80  feet of them.  Don't be that player.  The game had enough useless Crawl-dettes as is.
---
Like for real tho
---
In this instance, if you lose, it's on you. Implying this rank 2 is in fact carrying them, focusing on gen pressure and hooking the bad ones will make them fall apart since they will go down quickly and it's just one person
---
Quality&gt;Quantity. Meg cosmetics are mainly trash. She has the worst imo, which is sad since she is my main.
---
Def not me I love doing gens and being chased that's what I'm all about since I'm new but I also like winning so I want to get to a gen without being fully standing 
---
What movie?
---
‚Äúit‚Äôs ok, computer, papa‚Äôs sorry he let the bad man frighten you‚Äù
---
Ahh! Awesome. I love The Legion and this is so kind of you. GL everyone.
---
The number of generators left has to equal the number of survivors dead.
---
Hatch spawns with 
---
3 gens left when 3 survivors are dead
---
2 gens left when 2 survivors are dead 
---
Etc.
---
So in the case of your achievement, all generators have to be done and everyone needs to be alive so everyone can jump in.
---
Maybe so, and that myers doesnt seem like hes doing anything out of the ordinary, but if a killer does decide "Screw this survivor in particular" you'll almost never regret being ready for the endgame phase. If you're allowed to get that far anyway.
---
115% killer with permanent multi-survivor insta down and he thinks he's weak to the point of needing to insidious camp lol.  Sorry but you played a trash noob killer and that's what they do.  Just gotta requeue and try for a better game.  
---
They need to nerf the intro sound to this map. I dont understand why it was given such a buff.
---
Nea is Bae &lt;3
---
I calm myself and gather chi for a definitive blow, but if it misses I just swing afterwards. It's kinda like 50% lottery.
---
But you should watch [Scott Jund's Huntress tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQRDijaX5Io&amp;t=1s) on youtube, it's brilliant
---
Are you genuinely asking? If so, never back away from a survivor dropping a pallet. It will only allow a survivor to loop that pallet more. Just try to swing as they drop it, break that ma fk and chase them down. 
---
I'll screenshot and send to him for ya
---
Praise.
---
^(just saying that it's totally plausible considering the leveling system is very recent)
---
Still probably hacked tho
---
Hell yeah
---
At this point youre just ignoring facts to defend him.
---
Everything at 100 and 101 at the same time would be almost impossible
---
Op said he p3'd all his killers, meaning he should be way above player account level 91
---
Even if you wanna say it doesnt take long to prestige as killer, he had to put in tons of bp into Michael and p3 level 50 clown, spirit, and legion. That would take an insane amount of bp, this guy would probably have to live and breathe dead by daylight, have played nothing else since release to get those numbers.
---
There's a stigma for P3 Clauds, generally just playing like a boring shit (only sits on gens and urban evades around the map), I run Knockout and don't feel bad for bleedouts so I don't dodge em as killer, but as surv more than 1 in the lobby and it's an instant dodge from me.
---
Halloween is a much bigger and important event for a game in the horror genre than the Lunar New Year. Plus this Lunar event beats out the previous one as this time we are getting 3 full 3 piece outfits instead of just 3 items.
---
The ones who do respect pallets most likely do it because they don‚Äôt want to get stunned by the pallet drop. However respecting the pallet too much will allow the survivor to get more loops in around one pallet, so it‚Äôs a bad idea.
---
Doesn‚Äôt blood Warden only activate when the gate is opened?
---
Why is this getting downvoted? Its true, BHVR are one of the most uninspired, disconnected game devs I have ever encountered. Every time I encounter a bug or a stupid game mechanic that was never reworked, I just imagine how much potential this game would have had if the devs knew what they were doing from the start of development. 
---
Shhhhhhh they‚Äôre blending in
---
I've never understood why Lithe has the chase requirement. It only hinders the Perk due to how funky the chase mechanic is. I stopped using Lithe solely because of the times it fucked me over by not working when it should.

i have an extra perk slot in my build so i normally run Spine Chill.
---
Why? It‚Äôs good for knowing when the killer is coming for you, specifically Myers, Piggy, Freddy, Wraith, any killer with tinkerer, etc. And it helps you vault quicker.
---
Chucky and Freddy should be reversed :^)
---
I watched people play the game when there was only trapper. Hillbilly‚Äôs is one of the worst. Same with LF. Spirits and Huntress‚Äô are the best.
---
Flashlight saving isn't an exploit. Blinding the Killer in an animation lock is practically the only time you can blind a Killer. Unless they are brain dead and don't look away.
---
You can see the Flashlights in the lobby so you can prepare with Lightborn or Franklin's Demise. In cases where there is a high object nearby, look at it before you pick the person up.
---
I don't care about stealth and neither does any good player. Also, they removed that buff in 2.5.0
---
I love the plague!
---
Got a 4 kill today with spirit and one of the survivors said "gg wp!" (The others left I think).
---
Also got to rank 8 (survivor) for the first time, already loving that purple border
---
Mate I responded to your reply. I'm not ignoring anything.
---
OP posts picture accusing someone of hacking saying should he report? At that point in this original thread op had not identified the alleged hacker had all his killers P3. If he did then he has either hacked or abused the recent exploit without doubt. This does not mean he also used hack or exploit to get all these items but is more likely that he did, but that info is not shown by a picture.
---
I simply questioned or asked you to explain your reasoning that I did not understand and also shared my true experience of how I accrued many many top addons and perks in killer bloodwebs during the event without playing killer that much.
---
Unfortunately to the stupid cunts on this sub, this is not acceptable. 
---
It will activate from a hook for both gates as long as 1 gate is opened before the hook.  If the other gate is opened after, it will still be blocked too for as long as blood warden was still active for anyway. 
---
I still have my 2 sacrifices with nurse daily... As a survivor main I don‚Äôt like doing those and I‚Äôll probably just delete it to get a better one (like a coward that I am)
---
I found my first purple flashlight in one after 850 hours of gameplay so no (also i don't really search them anyways)

I let them get off the hook, jsyk
---
Also calm down
---
It always activated against me because I play solo. The lack of communication makes it great against solo but worthless against 3-4 man swf.
---
Still, if you complain about NOED you get told "jUsT cleAnSe ThE tOtEmS!!1", but its not so easy in solo now and sure as hell wont be if they have better spawns. Its alrrady hard enough on maps like Yamoaka.
---
New killer can launch a 90kg projectile over 300 meters confirmed?
---
Beat me to it
---
Eh maybe you feel that way but I play WAY worse with friends. I also don't think most killers (aside from people who spend time on this subreddit), actually feel the same way. In fact most chats after I've played with friends from killers are laughing at our meme plays or the fact that we hook rushed. 
---
A huge portion of SWF really just want a game to play with their friends. I don't know what advantages you would except a killer to get. As for "get stuck holding the bag of shit", honestly I think you''re making this out to be a much bigger issue than it is. SWF don't automatically win. My friends and I most of the time never escape. We're just having fun. 
---
Also I don't feel guilt about "boosts" simply because the competitive aspect of this game is laughable. It's barely competitive and anyone that takes it seriously... well I don't know what to tell you. You can get rank 1 just by grinding out games (my friend who is pretty bad did last week for example). It's not really "competitive" in the same sense something like League or Overwatch is. 
---
He can't hear us, he has airpods in!
---
Prestige 3 on all characters with only account level 91? Yeah that seems legit
---
I have seen his videos. But again, it's on PC. I feel like hit boxes might be better on PC. Not sure. I would like to think so though making me feel better since I play on ps4 üòÇ
---
you can always just throw them in the basement and camp with letherface, then wait for the altruistic friends to come and down them
---
If I had a pound for every time someone said that to me I‚Äôd be able to employ someone to start ironing out all the bugs &amp; glitches in the game
---
I love how someone said you don't care for the games health as if you're secretly the Lord of the hackers, yes. Move on, there's nothing you can do other than reporting it
---
Really? Damn. Wish I could have your hit boxes üòµ. What's your favorite costume for huntress?
---
High Rank = Red Rank = Between Rank 4 to Rank 1.
---
When you're being killed or sacrificed as a Survivor or when your killing a Survivor as a Killer, both Killer ans Survivors UI should disappear.
---
I lean towards the side or OP with Ebony Mori's but they were honestly the most rediculous during and shortly after the 2018 Winter Solstice Event.
---
The fastest "The fastest "The fastest disconnect in the west" in the west" in the west 
---
Your friends are either noobs or simple.
---
I reckon a bit of both
---
The amount of times I spawn in next to hexes is absurd üòÇ
---
I usually wear Prestige 2 with Wolf mask :) I don't have any channel, but I can record my shitplays and upload it on Youtube if you wanna :)
---
Oh, ok. I wear the bear mask. Top is that violet dress which looks so beautiful on her.
---
Yeah. Let me know when you are done uploading.
---
Huh I think he looks like a skinny heavy metal Hagrid 
---
It was in the shrine the other week lol
---
Nope. 
---
I'm basically running all the nurse perks and Whispers at the moment, eventually I was going to level LF to get BBQ and run with that. Eventually I'll have to get Ruin too. The thing that's really messing me up is when I blink to survivors I cant aim my lunges properly. Also when I try to blink through loops survivors run from where I end up, though that might just be me not knowing when and where to blink.
---
One thing I think they need to fix about this game is when killers jump up so far in viability just from add-ons.
---
Some examples: 
---
Franks' mixtape on Legion.
---
Iridescent head on Huntress.
---
I don't think add-ons should benefit the killer so much and they should maintain a similar level of viability without them. I probably only say this because I am a hoarder and refuse to use add-ons and offerings most of the time in fear of wasting them.
---
The tall man and the bladed orbs from the movie. Think about trying to juke those! It would be awesome. 
---
No, but you should've just abandoned the chase if she was looping you for that long. That loss was all your mistake. 
---
You mean dbd shitpost you stole from reddit? 
---
Bear mask is super cool, but pricey :D Though I bought Koshka coat :)
---
Exactly 
---
I dunno, I feel like it wouldn't be necessary and actually a bit of a nerf. Sure, survivors will be busy cleansing totems as well, but you can probably bet your ass that NOED never activates unless going against noobs. 
---
If it were to be implemented, though, I'd say either to add a totem counter to survivors, or remove the Hex totem aura for NOED for the killer when it does activate. If it is going to be base kit, survivors will need something to help them counter it a little bit.
---
Ikr I was a billy/wraith main for like 600 hours but as of recently i've been playing the best waifus, huntress and pig. Dbd just never gets old to me for some reason
---
Your teamates must love you
---
Nothing, according to this sub rank 15 players are better than rank 1 so yeah
---
Don‚Äôt touch his chest!
---
What is wrong with angrypug
---
Dc so they stop playing legion
---
It‚Äôs even worse in other languages with these fucked up text ‚Äúbugs.‚Äù
---
In Spanish, they somehow managed to copy Leader‚Äôs new description into Technician‚Äôs.
---
Are you talking about console? I'm pretty sure I bought it like 2 or 3 weeks ago 
---
They will most likely DC too. My two last Legion game in red ranks were 4 survivor DC as soon as we saw deep wound, and I wasn't even in swf. 
---
Same here
---
The funny thing is, DbD is still one of the best games to play right now. It's brilliant and stupidly crappy at the same time
---
God the doctors laugh is implanted in my head
---
It might be, it might not at the same time. Dealing with camperface with over 1k hours playtime always makes we wonder is he mentally challenged to enjoy camping for this amount of time?
---
Yeah, Im spanish too and a friend asked me how Aftercare worked.
---
Turns out that in Spanish, Aftercare doesnt explain that you can see your allies auras.
---
Most Hags I go up against that use 2+ Hexes just straight up DC when all their totema are gone

who‚Äôs the 6th? i always see memes with him but i never watched his movie
---
I'm not. He's very very good on console. I'm not sure why he doesnt translate well to PC, but he's my main and it's extremely rare that I get less than 3K. Most of my games are 4K.
---
Please let me eat your ass spirit
---
why the fuck doesn‚Äôt trapper have a sans outfit
---
More then 10 seconds I'd say is a bit to short to wait, lot of times it does end up working for me even though it spends ages on 95%
---
I‚Äôm at 68 now üò©
---
Basically you'll need all the gens completed for the achievement. As stated many times before me, it's the only way when you want everyone to escape thru the hatch. 
---
I recommend talking to your lobby before hand and seeing if they want to try to (or your swf). Having one person come in with the key and having another bring a map with the addons black silk cord and glass bead makes this achievement A LOT easier. This way someone can track the hatch down and mark it so that it's easy for everyone to know where they need to go.
---
Killer andsurvibir mains are like genders, it's either one or the other.
---
Lol he tbagged after camping super safe pallets. I‚Äôm just trying to get my killer dr done that day and I already had my bbq stacks. Also already double pipped so there was no point in killing him
---
Survivor mains still alive?
---
Nea: That's where you're wrong my friend
---
10/10 would spoop
---
Lore:
---
Real Name: Anon
---
Bio: After years of suffering from the constant mocking from Chads, Anon the 20 year old neckbeard kissless virgin was sick of it. After being cucked by a qt 3.141 for the final time, Anon goes to write a greentext on how horrible his life is while an unseen anger fueled inside of him, one this earth has not seen before. As he wrote his green text, the claws of the entity wrapped around Anon's parents house. A dark missed surrounded Anon as he continued writing his greentext. Once Anon posted his greentext he realised the hell that was trying to take him, he grabs his Anime body pillow as a weapon as he fights against the entity's grasp. 
---
Anon was never seen again, everyone thought he ended it all and moved on pretty fast. Little did they know that Anon lives on in a different realm, one that he is welcomed by the entity that he feels familiar in. Attacking all of the Chads and Stacies he can with his D.Va anime body pillow.
---
Context : playing as usual, hunting and hooking survivors like in a normal DBD game, until I realize that all hooks where I hooked a survivor remain "occupied", no way to hook a survivor on them again. Had to find "virgin" hooks to put survivors on them. Very very nice hahaha
---
Tunnelling kills is toxic.
---
Tunnelling gens is fine.
---
Ok then.
---
The Lawsuit's over, there's talks of an appeal though I don't think that will be happening or be changing anything
---
Ya I def dont have it and they keep having me go for shit like "well make it" "hope" "street wise" "premonition" just a short list of tier 1-3 perks the have forced me to get soo tilting 
---
People repair 10% slower for each person on the gen. So, 1=100%, 2=180%, 3=240%, 4=280%
---
Your google translated Ace as an ace in a deck and not as a name, meme correction would be: –°–ø—Ä–∞–≤–µ–¥–ª–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç—å –¥–ª—è –≠–π—Å–∞
---
I feel your pain, it is a pretty shit system tbh. Hope you get it soonüëç
---
Ok then
---
Nah man it is Default Dwight's that only use their Bond to get the killers off of their buttholes.
---
Thx until then I cri!
---
Alright
---
Bitter Murmur + NOED is pretty broken.
---
Just become a Freddy main to counter OOO 
---
I don‚Äôt get it 
---
What do you mean how Victor Miller is? All I'm saying is that so far in the 2010's alone, Jason has appeared in Mortal Kombat X, his own Friday the 13th video game, his own IOS mobile Friday the 13th Puzzle game AND he has already been in a game made by Behaivour called Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradice as a DLC.
---
All I'm saying is it isn't like Jason is a difficult at all DLC to get, another thing is that the IOS game came out after F13 The Game
---
Almost impossible. But the external comms is what makes swf complete bullshit and obviously a bunch of survivors downvoted so lol
---
I don't know what they were expecting to happen.
---
You forgot to mention your height/weight and which part of your tender flesh is most succulent.
---
Back then you couldn't see who the obsession was if it wasn't you.
---
But you see, if they finish that gen, even though people will die, the last person left alive will have the chance to feel the despair of having to complete an entire gen before the hatch spawns, leading them to go hide in basement lockers the rest of the game.
---
10 minute lobbies are real on PS4 for survivors, though.
---
Legion prefers ‚Äúthey‚Äù not he or she
---
I mean. The way you say that, I'm not sure you realise just how many people here are into the Huntress.
---
Did he just jump over his trap?
---
Probably me playing high and can‚Äôt finding anyone 
---
No one else wants to do your method dude
---
Oh yeah, I‚Äôm not in red ranks either. Purple at best. But you don‚Äôt really encounter many Nurses on console anyway... I play against pig most of the time. So much even that I dreamed about it last night, wtf.
---
That's the joke.png
---
Did the Wraith have Hallowed Blight cosmetics because that might have been my dumb ass
---
people complain about legion because you cant loop him and his counter is stealth.  
---
people complain about freddy because you cant stealth him and his counter is loops.  
---
what do you people want smh.
---
Iirc they put Santa in a bag and throw him down a chute where he lands for Oogie Boogie
---
Nea gets Balanced Landing
---
Put them together and you get a bad time
---
Claudette. That is why. 
---
People want a balance between them.
---
Also to be fair legion also counters stealth after he finds one of your teammates nearby.
---
They increased the chance to get items of higher rarity and it works great. No brown toolboxes anymore thus far
---
No, Noed can already be removed and DS is only cancer on a good survivor.
---
Probably because it's rather old. But still amazing even to this day. 
---
prestige/item exploit comes out, almost every console players uses it because there has never been bans on console, suddenly mccote launches a new ban system on console right after people used the exploits.
---
so many issues....
---
 „Ç¥„Ç¥ Is this a JoJo reference?  „Ç¥„Ç¥ 
---
All that comes with experience. Right now you're still new, so you're learning how survivors move around the map. Especially in a chase. You'll get used to their patterns and the blinks will become better. Just keep at it. 
---
It's a personal choice, I wouldn't play DbD if I had to wait for so long.
---
Recently I've discovered the beauty that is Ace in the Hole - its amazing how drastically just this one perk has upped my wins. I even tried plunderers with it a couple games - found a purple key with a milky glass and a Alex's toolbox with a hacksaw in the same game, and the next game a medkit with the purple instaheal on it.
---
I can't stop guys, please send help
---
Wtf do they mean with ‚Äûpass‚Äú??
---
The other portion of that is being appealed, but that is currently correct. 
---
I just wish Sean Cunningham had the rights,  cause then it would be a possibility for sure. God knows the F13 game was garbage...I was a backer of it. After playing it for a few months in 2017, right back to DBD I went.
---
Meg looks like Miley Cyrus got punched in face and got told something offensive since she is always angry. And Nea might just be a man. 
---
\#triggered
---
I've definitely been guilty of this a few times.
---
Haha, I never said the outcome was ideal, but at least it's a game that loads quicker and not spending 10 mins waiting for the game to eventually kick you back to the lobby.
---
then they cry when ruin gets found and destroyed in 5 seconds, I personally dont run any hex perks.  I like my perks to be active most of the game and I prefer perks that help in chases over anything.  Chasing is by far the the most thrilling aspect of the game.
---
Oh nice. I didn't know that...
---
Do you know if it counts globally or it differentiates between killer and survivor?
---
yeah. i run a shiny coin every time i play as ace because SOME PEOPLE decide they wanna be assholes and take my chests even though they see im running ace. i give all the items away to my fellow survivors anyways 
---
Ascended 
---
i only prestiged my main because i thought it was weird without it and my friend bullied me to do it
---
Eyy GMM :)
---
Mad how quickly Instagram stole this
---
This doesn't show anything that's underpowered about anything. This is three vs one and He could've gone for tier three and downed everyone. Don't forget if that were another killer like Freddy Doctor Legion or especially Leatherface they wouldn't have even finished this generator.
---
ive got over 100 on my huntress....ready to unleash when Im having a bad, so let me take it out on you! haha jk....I rarely use moris, only use them on people who were nasty in end game chat.  You just made the mori list buddy RIP
---
Which console is this? 
---
They gave ruin sometime recently, they given we‚Äôre gonna love forever and a bunch of meta survivor perks as well as a bunch of meta killer perks over the past couple months. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre getting wake up or overwhelming presence every week. The only one I can‚Äôt say has been in the shrine recently is BBQ, which despite the odds technically could‚Äôve just never been a lucky roll.
---
Like I said, if they really wanted us to spend money they‚Äôd never had added a shrine in the first place because then everyone has to ‚Äúbite the bullet and grab them‚Äù.
---
where do you find these groups
---
Survivors: ‚ÄúPolice come help!‚Äù
---
Tapp: ‚Äú911 state your emergency‚Äù
---
Survivors: ‚ÄúOh god not you‚Äù
---
When sawing someone's upper body in half just isn't brutal enough.
---
Thx &lt;3
---
The crashes are driving me insane.When will they fix these crashes ?
---
Perks aren't the only reason to buy the DLC but it is a major reason to buy DLC
---
For this reason I believe we won't see BBQ in the shrine and Ruin will only be in once a year
---
what about players who used the exploit before the new ban system came into action
---
Yeah I feel like whispers shouldnt activate for the person on the hook. Oh well. 
---
I'm farming so many keys. 
---
What why? Personally I find the fact I lose 90% of my matches to overgeared killers to be *really* fun.
---
I want to know
---
sure, Sounds good and would give Small Game more use
---
do you think if you're reported for anything at all they check your account, or is that dumb
---
The shrine existed way before the cosmetic store.
---
Coughs in p3 claudette and urban.
---
Yeah I rarely see a nurse. Usually Meyers wraith huntress, leatherface and hag. Gets boring.
---
I mean I play a dwight build with an ace skin. I kept getting tunneled as dwight.
---
&gt;sth doesn't work on PC dbd.
---
What is this witchcraft, this is outrageous
---
oh lmao
---
Ah makes sense
---
Killer mains everywhere who say, "I shouldn't have to farm in a 3v1.". You're right, you shouldn't: that's why the other person DCed: because they didn't want to die to another sweaty killer in an imbalanced 3v1.  You DON'T have to farm in a 3v1, but have you ever played a 3v1 on the survivor side?  It's like playing a 5v1 on the killer side: it absolutely fucking blows: the idea of getting points through saves, running the killer, etc are all gone.  You do gens, and you hide: that's all.  Tremendously entertaining gameplay.  You DON'T have to farm a 3v1, but it does go from making 3 people's lives miserable for 10 minutes to making 3 people happy, and you end up getting more BP.
---
So does this mean I can get banned when salty player report me for whatever they want?
---
Nineteen.mp4
---
Yesterday I found a skeleton key with that addon that lets you keep the key after death. I left it in the chest and took my medkit with me. After the gens were done, I rank back to the chest. However, suddenly Jake decides to follow my exact move (I run into a dead end where the chest is and so does he). Jake turns out to have been followed by an invisible wraith. He hits me with NOED right after I get my key. Both me and Jake died, but at least I got to keep the key
---
Ok chill just a rant post lmao 
---
And in my experience they spend the whole game clicking flashlights, body blocking, and all three rushing the hook to save their friend when you just put them on the hook. And right after that you get post game chat flooded with "ez trash killer" and my favorite " CAMPER! YOU CAMPED THE WHOLE TIME" 
---
I don't think they would check literally any report, that's a lot of work to do for each individual. Remember, they would need to always calculate how many of each item you could possibly have at your devotion level or something like that, but there's also the rng-aspect of bloodwebs in it. Maybe they have some other method, but I doubt that. 
---
Tips on what?  This is badass.
---
They are.
---
Honestly just buy the chapter or Laurie. Its fun to get all perks and adept achievements so you'll get playtime out of her, but good luck waiting
---
It increases the chances for rare items about like this: instead of getting a BPS every 50 BWs, you'll get one every 49 BWs.
---
When I have Wi-Fi?
---
At least LF is easy to evade as well. I like playing against MM and Huntress, but Hag honestly makes me wanna pull the plug sometimes. Most of the time I don‚Äôt use urban and I‚Äôm not patient enough to be slow crouching everywhere, haha  
---
Yah but it would probably force small game
---
yes
---
I already said I‚Äôm directionally challenged üòÇüòÇ
---
Its like trying to make a play with unbreakable or no mither, except 80% of the time you actually get to see results, plus a free heal and a very special middle finger to freddy just for good measure.
---
Don't be surprised if they're good. People sometimes rank drop on console because they're tired of fighting hard or the same killers.
---
Yes I am thank you
---
Hey I jjust thi mk youre cute thanks
---
Set refresh rate to 60hz, problem fixed
---
who are  u?? i have a boyfriend .....

He's there, but he's hiding in the basement

It's an ultra rare offering. It's gonna be "OP". That's how it was designed

Oh, okay......... üòî

---
First game with it I got a purple toolbox. Proceeded to get tunneled and camped, so I didn‚Äôt keep it. 
---
Second game I got a brown toolbox. So yeah I‚Äôve had good experiences with this 
---
Not really. Unless the other survivors are also running around with the OoO. In that case, they're not working on gens and this only benefits the killer. 
---
No, it's OOOP!
---
Ok
---
You sound like somebody who can appreciate the many virtues of Dolly Little.

I had the same happen with Billy Chainsaw 4 Survivors Daily. It gave 0 credit and I hit five times in two matches. (First games as Billy with no addons. He steers like a brick with rockets attached )
---
And then they dodge the next lobby when you join be cause they don‚Äôt want to get ran for another 4 gens
---
It's R by default, not E

Imagine chasing a gen

I've been literally banned from the forums for telling someone they could pull out their ethernet cable. The email was titled "You've been warned" then they told me "you've been warned" again in the email itself and then they told me it was a perma ban. These devs are actually incompetent.
---
Because he wouldn't fit into Frank's clothes
---
who?
---
sadly only the survivors will see it ingame
---
Why not have Thrill of the Hunt, Haunted Ground, Ruin, And Lullaby? every single Totem is lit, and you get to see if Survivors are fucking with your totems. Then just use Nurse. Ultimate skill checks. High risk, since every totem can be cleansed, but you can kill. Haunted Ground is also nice
---
I get it. I dont really like the animations either. But shes a fun killer once you get the hang of it. You can put a trap at a loop and the survivor will either leave or trigger your trap giving you a free hit. And you can put traps near hooks or gens so they trigger that and you know where they are. 
---
Leatherface and Spirit in B tier? Yikes that doesn't seem right.
---
Noice
---
anime shitposts incoming
---
 "d-did you see it?!"

I like to tunnel tea baggers. They get salty in the post chat and I tell them I thought they were telling me they wanted my undivided attention by tea bagging so I gave it to them. 
---
Nice Stand
---
It got me a 4k on pig yesterday. She blazed big and bright and sold out her teammate. Then I slugged her, found her buddy. She had crawled to hatch and OOO let me find her in the grass so I could grab and hooj her, went back and hooked her "friend".
---
That's why it needs to be changed. Constant intel in where the killer is should not be in this game. At least the other aura reading perks are limited like bbq. The killer has nothing but intel on where one player is, and will not be ae to chase effectively due to the survivor having a large head start.
---
You go for the other person
---
They have to be fully unhooked, standing on the ground. There‚Äôs usually a split second where they can‚Äôt move
---
Survivors are invincible while in the hooked state. They remain in the hooked state until they are rescued, sacrificed, or dced. They return to the injured state after the unhook animation.
---
You can either hit the rescuer, or you can wait until the unhook animation ends and hit the unhooked survivor then. Of course, if you were already nearby and the rescuer has Borrowed Time the survivor can still run. 
---
No studio is perfect, every game has their flaws excluding Big Chungus, and they definitely could do better, but as my original comment said they try very hard and I think the community always crucifixes them.
---
i‚Äôm saving mine to get spirit! i‚Äôve been told by many that she‚Äôs a really fun killer
---
Yes, a person who plays like a fuckingidiot will not do well. That's true of just about any perk
---
E X T R A  T H I C C
---
Rank only shows how much time you've played since last rank reset. If you're not disconnecting from games for any reason, you'll rarely lose pip and rank up fast. 
---
Until they start hissing at you :( 
---
Well...Warner Bros also own DC comics and when it comes to DC comics they allow their heroes and logos to be shown on posters and clothing and their name to be mentioned on any television show or channel free of charge because it's free advertisement in their eyes so I'd say it might even be easier than licensing most characters for this game.
---
And? 360 only came into it for 20 seconds at the end of a 6 minute chase. 
---
OoO is a detriment to the solo survivor on average, and only sees real use in a coordinated 4man. I'm suggesting a change, which you may consider a nerf. The solo survivor will not be affected by this change.
---
If you have a reasonable solution to balance swf, we're all ears. But most suggestions are not ideal. You can't really nerf swf without affecting the experience of playing with friends. Nerfing a strategy that they use, like OOO, does help balance SWF from being a steamrolling monster.
---
I am a console player myself and I can say it honestly is not all that bad, and I am too tired to respond to your entire essay you wrote.
---
But no other perk I can think of actively works against you like OoO.
---
Shaggy would 100% be the killer.
---
Welp, I guess Dbd is doing good over competitors?
---
It sure is
---
lmao he fucking salutes what a legend
---
I only do it if I happen to find a crouching neas who hasn‚Äôt done any gens. I stay away from people doing gens.
---
Sometimes I do the opposite too and help people who are being chase. Take a hit for them.
---
haha good call. I'll do the same
---
Ah I see very helpful thanks 
---
Somebody do one for clown NOW
---
If you're good at juking and have some semblance of map, knowledge, nah
---
is this the capture what happened thing? cause mine will only do the past 5 minutes
---
Ahh thanks, didn't know that!  BBQ is so worth it, especially since it pops up so rarely in Shrine.
---
Tbh don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting downvoted seems like their are a lot of triggered killer mains on this subreddit.
---
Here's the thing. If you're really close, you can actually pick up the person that is unhooking. Just don't use the dash attack. You can get in some interesting mind games. Survivors not in injured state might risk taking a blow if it means they can get the unhook while you recover. I normally wait to see if they try to unhook and if yes, I simply pick them up. Dunno if it's a good strategy, but it works sometimes.
---
No
---
People doing gens? It's just not realistic.
---
Okay, I see more what you mean now.
---
Yes, like *many* other things in the game there's a risk attached to using it. And it's on the high end of risky survivor perks. So what? If you're not good at managing it, don't use it.
---
No Mither is much more risky btw
---
This sub is predominantly killer mains so neither am I. 
---
The idea is to nerf tools that are useful to swf that don't affect the solos. OoO is that. I don't have a solution to what to change it to, what I do know is that as it is now, it is one of the most powerful tools to a coordinated SWF. No perk in the game should give unlimited wallhacks. The downside of being seen by the killer is not enough for swf, but a little over for most solos. The idea of the perk is what's bad. We can't go deleting a perk, so it has to be changed. Like how tinkerer's function was completely changed.
---
In your previous replies, you mention that we need to focus on swf. The devs won't do anything to bar people playing with their friends. The only option we have to balance is to mess with perks that are again useful to swf, but not to the solo so much.
---
I understand that you have found your niche with the perk in solo, and even escaped some. You understand that it can work for a solo, now apply that to a 4man com. The way you can completely shutdown mutliple different killers is disgusting.
---
But I mean I feel like that happened before this was ever a thing lol
---
What do you mean by dash attack? 
---
Hah caught!
---
On a serious note, that process is most likely is the reason or a good hint why your DBD didn't load. DBD can't load because the hard drive is being used by something else.
---
Lithe always made me lag, and then run into a wall everytime I used it, so I gave up on it.
---
For BBQ&amp;C, if I'm doing a gen, does the aura of the gen hide me, or do I have to stop doing it the gen for 3-4 seconds after the hook?
---
Also, the survivors aura only trigger after the hook right? Will dashing into a locker with Q&amp;Q in that small frame hide my aura?
---
I think that's the point. 
---
Well at this point he has been banned
---
And yet being able to hit people without waiting 7 seconds might just be a better.
---
if nobody cares why did you reply? must have put some sort of care into a thought to comment...

Don't know how to timestamp on mobile, but the part from 13:35 should be helpful
---
I do this every month. I'm really honored that people would trust me with their addresses, and I would never do anything to punish someone for that trust. :)
---
Billy doesn't need a nerf.
---
At all. His payoff for being looped is punishing open areas and high map mobility.
---
Spirit cannot be looped. She can literally stand still and still down a player. A good Spirit can be defeated in a chase. Due to this, her tracking, out of power chase and map mobility are weaker than some other killers.
---
Hag is a loop and zone god. A good Hag is scary, as you can't move to your safety zones to loop her and you can't be easily saved if she zones off an area. Her payoff is map pressure and out of power chases.
---
Huntress needs some hotbox and map fixes but is good for pressuring objectives in LoS and having high damage output. Her downside is stealth and map pressure due to movement speed.
---
All these killers have trade offs, and except for Huntress who needs just map adjustments and hotbox fixes, nobody needs any nerfs or changes.
---
Nurse needs her addons reworked hard. 5 blink and omega are disgusting addons that shouldn't exist.
---
Her base power *arguably* may also need a nerf/tweak but without removing her iconic status as a god of DbD. Currently a God Nurse has no counterplay other than generators, but that's seen as a solid counter to some, as we've seen in the DbD tournaments.
---
So no, HillBilly is fine and Nurses addons are indeed BS.
---
Thank you so much! I'm a game developer (card &amp; board, not digital), but when I have writer's block--which is often--I fill in my time doing fan art for games I love!
---
This is an important point, but at the same time the devs can‚Äôt ignore the killer side of things completely - because while you may only need 20% of players in a match to be the killer, if the number of people playing killer drops too low, the game suffers. Survivor queue times get longer, and killers get pickier about which lobbies they‚Äôll face because they know they can get another lobby almost instantly, leading to more lobby dodging. This degrades the experience for survivors too. 
---
I think this is currently a problem on PS4. Queue times for survivors are too long, and there are so many lobby dodgers it‚Äôs ridiculous. I‚Äôm a solo player and I spent about half an hour trying to find a game the other day because I got dodged four times in a row, despite being a solo survivor with no items. This kind of issue won‚Äôt be fixed by trying to make survivors happy or getting more survivors to play the game. There need to be more killer players on PS4, but the experience is currently bad enough that fewer people are playing it. If Behaviour don‚Äôt do something about it, in the long run SWF will leave the game anyway because between queue times and lobby dodgers, they won‚Äôt be able to get a match. 
---
When you attack while running. You sort of dash forward a bit before attacking.
---
I mean... have you seen his dark side?
---
Thank you so much! I appreciate it!
---
No worries, I got your message!
---
I got the "fatal blink" achievement while farming on console. The lads were nice enough to let me get a 2k.
---
it's the game and not me, there's a reason this post has over 1.5k upvotes- it's because it happens to everyone else too
---
Imagine putting LF, Pig, Trapper, Clown and Myers over Hag LOL. And Clown, Myers over Spirit.
---
Memorizing tiles and using this information to plan your route during a chase (killer or survivor) is one of the best things you can do to get better. The earlier you start practicing this the better you will get. This process can take hundreds if not thousands of hours for so many different maps but i assure you it should be a priority. There are plenty of youtube videos that rank killer and survivor perks, I recommend seeing a few of those to have an informed decision on whats "meta". Also, i recommend watching a popular streamer or two on your downtime to get familiar with how these people can play at such a high level. It can be entertaining and I am sure something will rub off on you. Good luck
---
People who use that argument are always the same. Focus on the 7 seconds and completely ignore his stall, map precense and mid game
---
It‚Äôs a fucking dumb perk imo just because it breaks the fundamentals that if survivor is bleeding they are one hit regardless of literally any favor in the game except this perk 
---
Direct swap Clown with Spirit, Hag with LeatherFace and I‚Äôd agree with it 100%. 
---
I am offended
---
apart from being a garbage human being? much more, he just treats people like garbage.
---
Its probably blood warden.  
---
New sabo meta
---
Occasionally I'll notice one player is many times better than the others and they'll typically try to run interference and distract me. If that's the case, just ignore them. If they're trying to be a bother and you ignore them, they aren't doing anything. Also, camp hooks on them.
---
If they're carrying their bad friends, they won't let them die on the hook, so let them unhook, then put them right back up! Don't try to chase down the good player to be nice or because they're annoying, it's a waste of time.
---
It used to really frustrate me, but if they're going to play "offensively" then I'll play "defensively".  I still almost never get the very good players, but I take out 1,2 or 3 of their friends and that is still a win for me, I'll still pip.
---
I usually like to play in such a way that I make sure everyone had fun, but if there's a survivor that's a huge pain in the butt, I can't really do that.
---
i think so
---
&gt; I don't have a solution to what to change it to
---
Then how could you possibly say it wouldn't affect solo survivors?
---
&gt; In your previous replies, you mention that we need to focus on swf. The devs won't do anything to bar people playing with their friends. The only option we have to balance is to mess with perks that are again useful to swf, but not to the solo so much.
---
Look, I am never going to endorse kowtowing to SWF in a way that fucks me a a solo player, and this is what you're doing when you say we need to balance around SWF in such a manner.
---
Frankly, SWF players rarely use OoO. The number of times I see it is vanishingly small.
---
&gt; You understand that it can work for a solo, now apply that to a 4man com. The way you can completely shutdown mutliple different killers is disgusting.
---
You keep saying this to me as if I don't think SWF is a problem. I'm attacked on this forum day by day for my harsh criticism of SWF.
---
Also, the difference between SWF comms with OoO and without is not that large
---
Madness tier 4
---
How do I find survivors at the start of the game? By the time I find them, there's a group of them on an almost done gen.
---
I don't understand what you mean by tiles.
---
Also are there any specific youtubers you'd recommend?
---
Some channels that play DBD are No0b3, TydeTime, Tru3Talent. Try watching then and analyzing their choices of perks, items and add-ons so you can make the best choice to your play style.
---
Clown better than Spirit and Hag? Oh my.
---
is hag really that good? she doesnt do a lot if you dont walk on her traps. she's definitely better than trapper and should swap places with him, but tier A? dunno..
---
I dont even want it anymore, not worth the wait
---
Ohtofu got tutorials on how to use pallets and map structures and he also has a series where he points out how his viewers can improve, which is very informative for anyone starting
---
Discordance!
---
Yeah and I am not blaming you or your PC. 
---
Obviously the game screws up somewhere but it would be nice to figure out whether everyone else experiences the same observations (certain process ends up using 90%+ disk) I'm suggesting or not.
---
So does anyone else notice an absurdly high amount of disk usage (%) when this bug happens, and if yes which process does it? 
---
The unfun part of Freddy, for me, is the fact that if I lose him during a chase and am trying to get someplace to wake up, all he needs to do is get 20 yards from me and I‚Äôm found again. I don‚Äôt personally understand why that mechanic was added to him. I liked the idea that, I believe, Mcclean brought up about a potential rework where his power would see people out of dream world and the more people he brings into the dream, the stronger it is. 
---
Another large criticism I see about playing against Freddy is the inability to accurately tell where he is. You hear the song, hide, and hope he isn‚Äôt actually standing directly behind you. There really isn‚Äôt a counter play to being brought into the dreamworld, and then as soon as you enter dreamworld, the first area I talked about comes up. 
---
That still leaves 2 people, do it's still they
---
No joke - I actually have a rule for myself as a solo survivor: If there is 2 or more Claudettes in my lobby, I dodge it. For some reason, whenever there is 2 or 3 Claudettes they just fuck up the game for everyone.
---
It's more that Haddonfield has pretty braindead near-infinites everywhere and Farm maps have see-through walls on tiles.
---
But I don't want to give up a perk slot, I like my build.
---
Billy! 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
This video on how to run tiles/structures as killer is great. You could also probably pick up some survivor tips from it too
---
If you don't have Ruin, get Hag. I'd say get Spirit otherwise, but Spirit's Fury doesn't really help Huntress. On the other hand she's real fun if you enjoy mind games.
---
Doctor's Monitor &amp; Abuse can be an interesting(?) pick on Huntress, but that's really it.
---
To be honest, I didn't even take a screenshot of my task manager while I was closing the game, I had to re-open it and take the screenshot because it showed paint and firefox in the processes and I didn't want to get flamed for using firefox
---
No Mither tells the killer they have to deal with you immediately. That they can't slug you and if they try you'll peel yourself off the ground.  It can be mitigated by good stealth and dead hard. Granted dead hard is better without no mither. I think letting you start at Hale and having your first hit give the broken condition. That way you don't telegraph it so loudly.
---
Not sure if this is an infinite loading screen post or just gyazo not working again on mobile
---
I know. I'm really a dwight disguised as Ace. They never go for Ace most of the time.
---
zOinKs!
---
 - Allows survivors to unmask the killer, preparing them for a mori.
---
Perk: Use 10% of your power to punch the killer out of existence
---
Nah. Trapper can take advantage of window vaults and shit, Wraith can haul ass to cut people off, Leatherface just gets destroyed by them. The effectiveness of his chainsaw is also limited by just how long it takes to rev up and then catch back up with whoever you're chasing.
---
He's better than Freddy though. Everyone's better than Freddy.
---
It's a bit different if you are selling the character though, it's not just a mention in a larger product, it is the product. 
---
If all you're talking about is tournament play (though I still don't see it being as strong as you claim) why bring it up? Seems pointless. 
---
It means he is skilled
---
ANGRYPUG is the best looper out there. Watch out for Friday nights though. He drinks a little and gets very honest about certain things. Just warning you lol.. Seriously though, I've learned so much by watching him.

---
Are there any specific reasons to play Spirit? How good is she when dealing with the more...annoying...survivors?
---
Are there any reasons to get Hag other than Hex: Ruin?
---
Ok. We are on the same page. You don't want to nerf a perk that could affect the solo experience. It's perfectly fine. We can take that into account while trying to change how OoO works. I never said to nerf it to the ground so as to make it unusable.
---
Though I will say that OoO does make a big difference in swf play. As stupid as it sounds, I have a competitive team and we play in high-profile tournaments. Notably TydeTyme and Space Esports. In a competitive environment, OoO makes Hag, trapper, and Wraith unviable and hard to win with when forced to play as those characters. Hag is a fantastic killer, unless you stop her setup. I say this with experience, OoO turns games around.
---
Nah only 0.420% is needed for such weaklings
---
You dont play freddy injuring everyone. You play him by putting most survivors to sleep. You can do fine doing so
---
Damn, that really sucks
---
You want Leatherface's DLC. You want BBQ &amp; Chili. Everything else can come later.
---
I come from a tournament standpoint where killers can be picked at random. There is a low chance of actually seeing those killers at R1, but most everyone except Nurse is affected my OoO negatively.
---
I haven't used it since I unlocked Dead Hard. But I really hope they change it so it doesn't require a chase
---
and been banned from PS4
---
Love how wraith is always disrespected. Makes me happy when I consistently 3k with him
---
&gt; I'm having some issues evaluating which perks are good and which are bad,
---
What are you running?
---
&gt; and also establishing my priorities when playing as killer
---
This is big. It's so easy to get thrown off your game. I also had this problem!
---
I bet you might find this relatable:
---
I was playing a game once where I found this Dwight and I started the chase. He was just wasting pallet tiles. We'd get to one and he'd toss it and run straight to the next one. No mind games, no attempt to escape.
---
It was fucking annoying. *And I wanted him so goddamn bad*
---
Then it dawned on me. He was just trying to drain my time and lead me away as gens got banged out.
---
So I left him. And sure enough, back where I found him there were a couple of gens close to completion, so I started to control that situation.
---
It was a little too late and I lost momentum at the beginning of the game, but I ended up getting them all because I chose Dwight last. If I ever saw him, I chased him for a couple pallets then go control gens and attack other players.
---
By the end it was just him and no pallets.
---
Becuase the average person doesn't realise unless you are 50+ lbs under/overweight you're about 1-2 years of actually giving a shit and not eating like trash/lifting 3/4 days a week from looking like him minus maybe a 6 pack if he has one.
---
73 now. We‚Äôre never getting it back ;(
---
2k is a draw, 3k is a win, 4k is a destruction
---
Play on PC lol...I'd I cant play HAG on my PS4 because the frames drop so  bad, but it only happens with her
---
Or you could just not use DS and play the game without crutches
---
As it should be
---
If you‚Äôre running new plunderers at rank 2 or higher I would just skip Pharmacy unless you want the medkits specifically 
---
idk about your suggestion specifically but i totally agree that wraiths mori is super lame 
---
Borrowed time is a perfectly fine perk.
---
It's a bot which allows the killer to derank. Just complete gens and get out of there. 
---
It's like that to counter campers like you 
---
For killers: if you have a totem, consider not sprinting over to it in the first second of the game, having a look around, and then sheepishly leaving the area. It‚Äôs so blatant and we will just wait for you to leave then cleanse it. 
---
For survivors: whenever you‚Äôre unsure if a killer saw you or not, we probably did, especially if you‚Äôre crouch hiding behind something small or narrow, like boxes or a tree. 
---
All of the original 3 have pretty shitty moris.
---
I see legion on the hook, I upvote
---
Thats exactly what i do though....Honestly just had another game where it happened and i'm not getting any points because i literally can't move without being discovered 
---
I just legit want to hook each of you once for my BBQ stacks and do whatever the objective of my mission is ( Sorry if it's a kill you mission )
---
Stop running and let me penetrate you with hooks
---
Meg doesn't need any more cosmetics, she's got like 50 already. Mankini Jeff please.
---
&gt; As stupid as it sounds, I have a competitive team and we play in high-profile tournaments. Notably TydeTyme and Space Esports. 
---
No, that's awesome. Feel free to demur, but I'd love to watch your games if you feel comfortable telling me your team name.
---
&gt; I say this with experience, OoO turns games around.
---
I know that your main point is that SWF abuses mechanics, but saying here that it "turns games around" is pretty unconvincing when that's the point of a lot of perks
---
Anyway, unless you have an idea for an OoO change, I don't think there's really anything to discuss anymore. Although, it's interesting to me that tournaments allow voice comms. If I ran a tourney I'd be like "no, motherfucker"
---
He said meme build, so pointless is the point. 
---
Doesn't the lunar event start today so that's prolly it
---
You need an external HDD as your capture drive to go over 5 minutes, I think.
---
But 5 minutes should be plenty to catch a kill cam and few minutes of spectating.
---
Steroid abuse has serious mood side effects apparently
---
I hate saying it but this is exactly what i do....honestly i appreciate the advice but it's just so strange and i hate to admit it but it's made me DC a few times 
---
It‚Äôs a fucking dumb perk imo just because it breaks the fundamentals that if survivor is bleeding they are one hit regardless of literally any favor in the game except this perk
---
Dope idea for wraith, I heard the originals 3 suck cause the devs wanted the game to be appealing to everybody but that changed
---
Its a latin singer called Julieta Venegas, that is a video from her song "Algo esta cambiando" or Something is changing.
---
I have every killer, I'm gonna vote spirit. She is a blasttt
---
Tunneling means the killer either hard camped or proxy camped hook and then immediately as soon as unhook happens goes after 1 health state survivor again to immediately put them back on hook and then repeats once more.  That is the only legit description of being tunneled and yes that is incredibly toxic.  I get it maybe if a survivor bm'd and was being a disrespectful shit possibly but otherwise yes true tunneling is gross as hell and completely skilless playstyle.  I'm rank a rank 1 killer every month and play against swf constantly.  They can be beaten consistently while still playing a clean game that is fun for both sides.
---
Your aura becomes visible the instant you see the notification on someone on a hook, in that instant killer is able to look around. If you're still in the animation of getting into a gen your aura is still visible until the door closes. And no, gen does not hide your aura, they are two different colors to the killer and a killer who's half decent can tell them apart.
---
If you know someone is being brought to a hook and you dash into a locker before they're placed on the hook, wait 4 seconds and you're good. Alternatively, if there at lockers nearby, you can run in one direction, count to four, then go back. You can also get close enough to the hooked survivor, as it only shows auras to those who aren't near.
---
If you run dying light don't run rancor due to rancor being end game so dying light isn't effective at end game of you've only just killed you're obsession
---
Using a yellow mori instantly excludes you from being an intellectual. 
---
A poorly executed one in my opinion
---
She ***really*** looks focused
---
Yeah... but it helps me find the obsession whenever a gen gets done.

Complete gens, leave, report them for botting and then leave match
---
Your lack of an answer speaks volumes. Keep being bad and blaming it on other factors.
---
you know the player level was added 2 years after the game came out right? plenty of time to prestige
---
Yeah, the idea of a vampire isn't trademarked (unless you talk about Dracula, Alucard, Nosferatu...).   
---
Same with Werewolves.
---
Its so demoralising and feeling like i'm being singled out will make me drop this game for good one day :/
---
You're probably pretty new to the game.
---
I think they should be a rarer spawn considering I get way more red rarity mori's in my killer blood webs than I do green rarity bloody party streamers, which is kind of crazy to me. 
---
When that happens I stop playing for a bit or go to killer. I also started developing an instinct for "I shouldn't stay here right now" and trusting it to move (and sure enough the killer often shows up there soon after). You're possibly getting tilted because it keeps happening and making poor decisions, I know I do.
---
God fucking...checking my PMs too late. 
---
Essentially, it comes down to guessing basically (unless you're running certain perks/addons)
---
You can be pretty sure they aren't going to spawn next to you (although the game does bug out sometimes) so look for a Generator that's in the distance, and move towards that, since Survivors will typically spawn near Generators. 
---
It can take a bit of getting used to, but once you've played a lot you'll get a feel for guessing fairly accurately where they've spawned, or at least where they could have spawned.
---

I'd use bitter murmer as it'll show you everyone's aura not just their location
---
Starts tomorrow so this is prob fixing that glitch 
---
Before this was patched the game would actually start with two killers and 3 survivors. There is some funny youtube footage of it.
---
I love the light blue hairstyle with the mask. Never removed since I bought it
---
The anti skill check doc is a good build since distressing gives bonus deviousness points, you can swap out huntress lullaby or overcharge for BBQ and chilli
---
I don't think we're going to get anything other than humans unless the entity creates its own monster.
---
no it doesnt. Rancor shows every surv except the obsession! The obsession can see your aura tho making it not easier but harder to find him/her
---
This is a pretty bad tierlist.
---
S: Nurse
---
A: Billy, Hag, Spirit
---
B: Huntress, Myers
---
C: Wraith, Trapper, Doctor, Pig, Leatherface
---
D: You've got this one right.
---
no, it classifies him as an intellectual. Stop saying the opposite just to gain some points. 
---
I get you completely, yeah I feel the same way. Maybe just give it a break, and come back when you actually wanna play the game, that's what I'm doing at the moment anyway
---
The aura of the Generator can sort of hide you, but they recently changed the colors of Generator auras and Survivor auras to be different enough that hiding behind Generators can be a lot harder.
---
The aura only triggers right after the Killer finishes the hook animation, so if you see someone getting picked up and then their aura disappears, you have a few seconds to find a locker to jump into, yes. Also, the Killer has to actually look around and scan for auras, so they could just miss yours entirely if they aren't looking in the right direction, even if you miss-time hopping in a locker by like half a second.
---

---
You're the one not getting it. I never said the other survivors need OoO. OP said that another survivor working with the survivor who has OoO would just disarm traps and I said that wouldn't be the case. If you don't mind me asking what level killer are you?
---
Not leatherface specifically, it was added to create an opportunity for people to escape when the killer tries to instadown them before they even have control of their character. 
---
Oh crap, you‚Äôre right üòÖ
---
what are the names of the two middle ones? i forget
---
Lol yes that‚Äôs like 75% of this sub
---
Your basic yellow flashlight has nothing special about it, and 8 seconds of battery life by default.
---
Green flashlights (Sport Flashlights) have the same 8 seconds of base battery life, a "slight" decrease in battery consumption, which according to datamining means a 12% reduction, and a "slight" increase in accuracy (although I have zero idea if this even means anything tbh)
---
Purple flashlights (Utility Flashlights) have a base of 12 seconds of battery life, "slightly" reduced accuracy (still no idea if this means anything), "moderately" increased visual brightness, which I believe just makes the blind screen brighter for the Killer, and "moderately" increased Blindness duration, which as you would expect, means the Killer stays Blinded for a bit longer than any other Flashlight.
---
Essentially, all that really matters with Flashlights after the change that made Blind time baseline across the board is battery life.
---
that‚Äôs more of a connection issue on your end imo

I once had this happen where two swf idiots were being generally toxic and vaulting windows repeatedly to get my attention. I just gave up after a bit, I was so annoyed. 
---
I then went on to a survivor match and who do I get teamed up with? Those two idiots. I asked them ''did you just play a game against a Pig?'' To which they replied ''ye she was fucken trash''.  
---
I was just trying to do a daily, man. 
---
yes but THE THING YOURE TALKING ABOUT ISNT BORROWED TIME ITS A FEATURE THEY ADDED . Read the patch notes sometimes.
---
I‚Äôm max prestige Claudette and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm toxic at all. I can‚Äôt use flashlights and I‚Äôm not great in a chase though I‚Äôm trying to get better. The best thing I‚Äôve got going for me is that I can hide in some bushes after I lithe away from the killer. Don‚Äôt judge us all. Haha!
---
All it does is remove the 10 percent penalty per person, so it's going to at most be the same as before the multiple-people-on-one-gen thing was fixed. I also think it's only going to have a small uptick in popularity 
---
But you're the one complaining about a toolbox lol ok
---
And? You're telling me that this guy has 100 of every item on all pres 3 characters while only having a level 91 account? Yeah, that's bullshit.
---
I have been playing since December 2016, have over 1500hrs and I haven't even gotten 70 brown tier items on my pres 3 Jake Park. Also I'm account level 168 and I've barely gotten 4 characters to prestige 3 
---
Ow! I fucking cut myself on that edge
---
Yes. That's frustrating because I've dealt with a group like that as pig. I just started slugging and putting on bear traps. They finished the generator I was trying to keep them off and got away without a hitch. If I had played Leatherface or Michael  I would have downed them considerably faster than with pig. 
---
It's just the luck of the draw which survivor team you're facing and if you're the correct killer to face them. 
---
Thats too much effort.  Its likely just a turbo controller with a rubberband
---
Thanks, I look forward to watching ya'll!
---
I'm breaking those. And killing you first
---
Hey, I play Tapp. I‚Äôm just saying the truth.
---
I agree but I also want to state that the corn is still definitely an issue as killer.
---
Lol. I could see them providing Scooby Doo cosmetics for the survivors. 
---
Always put my insta heals on brown med kids, when I see that shit I just question the players sanity 
---
I really don't get how there are stereotypes for characters, it makes no sense. People play differently on everyone and it's literally cosmetic once you have learned everyone's perks.
---
Object of Obsession and No Mither
---
r/woooosh 
---
So do I and you are the big wrong. Biggest wrong. Triple wrong.
---
stronger?, what do you mean by that?
---
Depends on the survivors, yep. I used to play super nice and I got teabagged at the gates &amp; after pallets almost every time anyway. Soooo.
---
The saddest shit ever. 
---
There are an unreleased number of different hatch "spawn" points on each map, and it picks from one of these when it spawns the hatch in. This means if you've played enough games on any certain map you can have a slight idea of where it might be, but outside of tracking it with a map, it's essentially random, yes. Also note that they follow some amount of "logic" meaning that they won't ever spawn on the 2nd floor of a building, they'll always be on the ground level, or basement level on a map like Gideon aka The Game.
---
They can spawn pretty close to the outer edges of the map, but not touching the outer wall as far as I've ever seen.
---
And on Badham Preschool it basically only ever spawns in the Preschool basement in that weird little corner for some odd reason.
---
once per match when fast vaulting into a locker, you will emerge from a random locker on the map and leave no scratch marks for 4/6/8 seconds
---
With base kits for Leatherface you slowly deprive an area of pallets relying on your hammer and slowly secure downs. If a survivor makes a mistake on the security of an area you rev the chainsaw up their butt and secure a faster down.
---
With Freddy you try and time your hit into dreamstate to get a free hit then watch as everyone goes out of dreamstate as the survivor loops you for a couple of minutes. Trying to make sure that you get some areas clear of pallets and mindgame as hard as you can.
---
Freddy can better roll survivors with the right foothold that isn't basement camping with Leatherface. But he is much more all or nothing. Its either a slim 2k or a overwhelming 4k with him. 
---
Why do you want to be red ranks? The games are so much more fun purple/green. 
---
Thanks for the very detailed reply, didn't find anything on the wiki about it. Unfortunatly I only have 1 Will O' Wisp left so I have to save it for special occasions.
---
I heard slight decrease in accuracy means the amount the beam will wobble when you move while you shine it.
---
That's not thicc. It's a pretty small ass tbh
---
I don't know. I saw one person say they feal the stun is slightly longer. I haven't tested it.
---
If you're a huntress main you actually might like Clown. I know you mentioned he doesn't interest you, but the bottles are the same idea as the hatchets you just throw them in an arc - still have to predict where theyre going and account for it just like huntress. I've been playing a lot of both of them, and Ive noticed my aim is getting significantly better on both killers because of it.
---
They also function very similar as far as addons go - the addons can add some severe debuffs (my favorite combo for Clown is the Mangled/Exhaustion and extra hindered penalty, just like on Huntress)
---
Sloppy Butcher is perfectly viable since the nerf to survivor healing speed a while back. A survivor trying to Self Care through Sloppy Butcher will take somewhere around 45 seconds, which is insane.
---
Granted, lots of survivors seem to be dropping SC in favor if Iron Will and just relying on Adrenaline to save them at the end, but Sloppy is still good.
---
?
---
Shit easy game to win! 
---
BNP doesnt consume the toolbox, so why not for the speed boost of repairing
---
Sloppy butcher regularly sees use wtf are you on about lol. Its fine. 
---
Just play legion with mixtape and they'll dc for you.
---
Then they ask why you sat on their face until they died on hook
---
Spirit on console is deadly, I always get bodied by Spirits. My loops are nullified.
---
Whats a good legion build
---
I think you, as what appears to be a tunnel killer, would of course not like that perk because it would mess up your strategy as you posted specifically about hitting a survivor being unhooked (are you camping as well?) Do you only play killer? 
---
Dumb and Dumber
---
I hope it's a vampire, witch, or werewolf.
---
just played a game and it feels like always to me
---
\*Haddonfield, trapper, new killer, place in probably the most obvious places ever
---
Never catch anyone, hear snapping all over the map\*
---
I have abandoned every ritual since, and simply avoided trapper after that day
---
I want to see you play any other killer other than Nurse, Huntress or Legion at R1 and without a Hex: Ruin. Please record it, upload it and share it. I really would love to see you do that and not just shitpost.
---
What do you play on? We‚Äôre making a Tapp army.
---
2 of them are already dead, its not like the exits gates opened and he had no kills. This Wraith is just bad at the game, change my mind.
---
Nurse is overrated. Counterplay for her is completely different then any other killer, you have to rely on jukes, mindgames and 50/50s rather then pallets and windows. She is only the undisputed number 1 because survivors can't into mindgames for some reason. If people got good at fighting her, she would drop to third, maybe even fourth place I feel.  I think the term for this is "underdeveloped meta", its like how Spy in team fortress 2 was really strong until people took steps to deal with him.
---
Billy has few weaknesses but his strengths aren't overbearing. He has an instadown, and map-wide mobility. His instadown is telegraphed and can be juked, and his map wide mobility is loud and obvious (without certain addons). His only weakness is claustrophobic maps, as they neuter his chainsaw's effectiveness, but he doesn't rely solely on his power to get kills. Billy is the most bang for your buck killer, and is really the standard that all killers should be balanced around.
---
Neither need nerfs. Nothing killer has needs nerfs.
---
Make it darker ;P
---
Dying lights kinda scummy honestly it promotes tunneling the obsession to death
---
Killer main btw
---
He wasn‚Äôt talking about borrowed time. He‚Äôs talking about not taking a hit until the unhooking animation is over. 
---
And borrowed time is still a good perk. 
---
Ah ps4 unfortunately
---
or 3: Ill Mori your ass and take all Vessels 
---
yeah I mean, that was a SUPER important fix to push out 
---
Well isn't nea a killer so I think you read it wrongüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
For fun ita probably mikey or spirit 
---
Maybe freddy or leatherface
---
Definitley not pig
---
&gt; "moderately" increased visual brightness, which I believe just makes the blind screen brighter for the Killer
---
I was under the impression this made blinding easier. I have never noticed brighter blind screens playing killer, and that would make no sense after the change to the blind screen
---
Are we playing the same game?
---
Was just using the mori because "I might as well use something I guess"  
---
when the hatch standoff came about I was like, "fuck he has DS... wait... \*Kill?\*"  
---
Said obsession was toxic af and a pain to catch, it was one of the most satisfying mories ive ever done.
---
People play differently, but people who play similarly tend to congregate to the same survivor.
---
Bill mains are awesome and know when you unhook you at the perfect moment.
---
Ace, and to a lesser extent Quentin mains can only be found looting chests.
---
Jake mains are just good at the game - they are not toxic, but they are just good at everything in general. If I see a Jake with nice cosmetics, then I know I can rely on him - likewise I will go out of my way to protect him.
---
But when it comes to Claudettes - I don't think I have ever escaped a match when I have been paired with 3 other Claudettes. It's just some sort of hive-mind mentality; when Claudettes come together they become anti-team mates.
---
Found the mobile user
---
And then survivor just leaps up into the air and drops into the hatch because you were doing your "epic after attack animation" for 30 seconds.
---
\[This\]([https://imgur.com/9MwCgrL](https://imgur.com/9MwCgrL)) was appropriate
---
I just did it with no problems.
---
It's always been buggy though. I've had my bloodweb bug out many times , just play a game or close app.
---
As far as reporting data or whatever I'm sure they already had methods in place before this hotfix because SOME people were already getting banned

I love Urban
---
I used to feel that way, but it seems like most swf groups I play with are pretty sweaty anyway... so I don‚Äôt feel sorry for them. It‚Äôs fair game now. 
---
Plus I need dying light for Freddy.
---
Oh.
---
Yeah. Seems like they made it alot easier since the last update. 
---
How so?  I don't use bm 
---
so gonna try this out
---
It does actually make the screen brighter, but that doesn't matter at all anyways.
---
From the sounds of your post I'm not sure you're actually using this perk to its full potential. If you only ever hit, chase, down, and hook one survivor at a time then yes it's not that great at slowing the game down because you're only ever forcing one survivor to heal at a time. Maybe a total of 5-8 times per match.
---
Consider this: My playstyle with hag is to just teleport to any trap that's triggered and smack dat bitch because I quite like the frantic teleporting around the map, hitting a variety of survivors to keep them all on their toes. What pairs rather nicely with that is Sloppy Butcher (and Franklin's if they're all running items) and I can usually have at least two survivors injured at a time, sometimes even all 4 if the survivors just have a craving for jump-scares. This increases the number of times survivors have to stop and heal dramatically and between taking the time to collect their dropped item and healing themselves, I can force survivors off gens for quite a while. (Bonus! Games like this take a while which makes for some pretty high BP totals all around. Might not be the most efficient method of farming but boy does it feel good with party streamers.)
---
AS to your thought of adding skill checks similar to overcharge/dstrike, I kinda like it. Increasing the frequency of skill checks and making them "considerably difficult" checks while also increasing the heal time might be a good way to incentivize killers to break chases after getting a hit in and make it so that one survivor takes up less of a killer's time on single chase. It could also be horribly OP on someone like Legion who gets hits on multiple survivors fairly easily. Sure would be fun to playtest though. 
---
Or you could comment something that contributes to the thread and has a meaning
---
Possibly. The same is true of wiggling off the Killer's shoulder, if you do it super fast it doesn't make a difference, there's just a certain rhythm you're supposed to press the keys in.
---
One of the ever upvotes I've given, and you absolutely deserve it
---
baffling and useless 
---
So I recently hit level 50 on my spirit animal Claudette right before the last ps4 patch. Ever since I can't seem to get perks to spawn in her web. I've probably cleared 10 of them in this time and not a single time has a perk shown up. 
---
Is this a bug or am I missing something?
---
Do you not understand what ‚Äúrules‚Äù mean?
---
I'm going to say the N(gg) word
---
You keep jumping to conclusions. I asked what rank killer you were because perhaps you don't understand how things work at higher levels. And I would explain them to you. In all of my posts this thread, what would lead you to believe that is how I would respond. 
---
Ahhhhh. Then yeah, prob a rubber band haha.
---
I was in reds, it's just that I don't have enough time in my month to get to reds again, imo games with useless teammates with no game sense are just annoying since most of the time I can't do anything about it, sure the players are better in purple ranks but a lot of them are still boosted by better players or just swf in general. I'm mostly a solo survivor when I don't want to fuck around, when I do I just mess around with friends and usually bully the killer and then let him get a 4k and everyones happy at the end of the day.
---
Reminds me of that one ~~hentai~~ japanese comic I read the other day that was literally start to finish nothing but memes in the speech bubbles.
---
I hear the frames are bad on Doctor
---
It‚Äôs not. BNP doesn‚Äôt delete the toolbox anymore.
---
cant dc if you uninstall the game weSmart
---
RUN. Thats the best counterplay there is. If you think they are close hold sprint and run far away. Dont try to loop or hide.. just run full speed in a straight line.
---
Legion is slow when not using Frenzy and can see you if you are near them when they use it and hit someone. Running far away is your best bet
---
I said it before and will say it again. Wraith should rip their spine out like he did his boss. Trapper should stomp their head in a bear trap. Billy maybe saw their limbs or head off.
---
Then the benefit is they don‚Äôt heal!! You win either way. 
---
Yrah, I think I meant tilted. Thanks for explaining tho!
---
jesus christ this new wave of "we need to nerf nurse" bullshit from survivor mains is annoying 
---
Where‚Äôs the link OP üëÄ
---
Swap Self Care with WGLF and you got my build. Just because you are farming items, doesn't mean you shouldn't also farm your team.
---
So I was watching this clip and [The start of this song linked up perfectly with the start of the mori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKe6_MymcDk). Somhow made this a lot more impactful
---
&gt;Corn isn't the issue
---
It is if you're Michael Myers.
---
Do you have any teachable perks unlocked that she hasn't learned yet?
---
I'd lagnose you with death?
---
T han k
---
My best guess is you ran out of perks to obtain. Do you have any (unlocked) teachables or generics you know for sure she doesn't have?
---
Or you could literally move your mouse around and see the killer coming...
---
I‚Äôve seen people complaining that they‚Äôre being sucked into a pallet stun from around a corner, that might be what they‚Äôre referring to. 
---
Imm talking about the perk here, understand the context sometimes
---
In her P3 clothes she‚Äôs practically invisible so it‚Äôs very hard to see her. Also Claudette players are really sweaty and toxic, so if i see a 4 man SWF full of P3 Claudette‚Äôs with flashlights and medkits i tend to dodge. I just wanna have fun, not try hard. 
---
When you have to patch your patch
---
The stun is inconsistently weird, now. Sometimes I get the normal stun, and sometimes there's a split second delay where I'm locked in place before the stun triggers, and it looks very stiff.
---
When me and a friend started playing, we went in blind and stayed figuratively blind for multiple games. Didn't even know the heartbeat was an indicator that the killer was near, so we got scared multiple times
---
&gt; what would lead you to believe that is how I would respond. 
---
not things *you* said, but historically what people say after they start with that. usually when people go that route they do so to insulate themselves from criticism or inflate the worth of their argument
---
If you had any involvement in the removal of my last video, you would understand, as a human being, that I am new here.  Now, since then I have acquainted myself with the specific rules in question,  and to answer your question in a roundabout way,  "No, I do not understand what part of the rules mean that this is unacceptable."
---
I even submitted a report against the mod who removed it as soon as I saw it because I see in no way how I am in violation of ANY said rules.
---
You will also see a copy of the transcript in the mod team letter I just sent as a follow up, as soon as I learned how to do that.

Would you care to enlighten me?

---
Thank you for your helpful polite input rather than down-voting and talking poorly on me for throwing an idea out. I see what you mean with your hag gameplay and I do agree that does help to make sloppy used to its full potential by putting constant pressure on survivors continuously through the game. All though not every killer can truly do that, but I kind of want to try your idea as hag and give it a try. 
---
And I do completely agree with your thoughts of my idea. It would help killers to not need to forcefully tunnel one person after hitting them once for a long unending chase, rather they would be able to switch their focus to evenly distribute their pressure to all survivors knowing that their healing process isn't going to be as easy anymore. Honestly don't think it is all that bad of an idea, just something interesting I thought about that I figured some people might enjoy and have further input on it.
---
But on the Legion topic, I did not think about that. Playing against Legion with sloppy butcher with an addition such as this idea would make it brutally painful, almost more raging than having to deal with Legion's with franks mixtape already. Just an idea though and clearly it would need a lot of work and other parts to it to make it suitable for all killers while still making it remotely fair for survivors. 
---
No but there came a situation where the exit was open, and non-damaged survivors were rescuing injured survivor. I slashed injured survivor and they just end up running faster from the hit while I am now slowed from delivering a hit so you can understand my perspective better 
---
good luck
---
Thats too intensive, as they dont have the capabilities to effectively seperate limbs or body parts in their entirety and make it look even slightly convincing. That and all the misc. issues that would start because of it.
---
This also no longer links to the original upload on another site, so it cannot be qualified in any possible way as self promotion.
---
People are really out here using percentages as if Shaggy's power was finite?
---
I don't think you understand.
---
i dont see whats wrong here
---
yikes why tf you want that trash anyway?
---
When you got a 2000 word essay due in 8 hours and you haven't even started it
---
It absolutely affects survivors if they aren't running Self Care because now you're having to waste 2 (or more) people's time to heal. If they want to run around injured all game then that's great news for you.
---
it probably wastes more time than ruin depending on RNG if the team is SWF. Cleansing totems means they aren‚Äôt on gens, and if they don‚Äôt have all the totems then NOED will pop so they HAVE to cleanse them. 
---
I juke nurses just fine. with a little bit of practice you can run the nurse the entire game. Move unpredictably and forget everything you know about dealing with the other killers.
---
\&gt; Billy has autoaim which means that if he is close to you he will down.
---
Don't let him get that close, silly. And as someone who plays a lot of billy, it is not as 100% as you think. Survivors that close are harder to hit then because the chainsaw blocks a lot of the bottom of the screen.
---
Um, alright
---
I am contributing to the thread. Don‚Äôt use DS and you won‚Äôt have to worry about when it comes back for free and ruin the game by furthering more users
---
Body doesn't actually get cut in half. The blade just goes through the body like it's a ghost or something. 
---
ye, probably potatoes, that will only run uf they actually see the Killer 
---
Only thing that bums me out is that if you only hit a good skill check, you don't get the 50 bloodpoints you would have otherwise gotten. And soloing gens by default rewards 1250 points. You could do all 5 gens and if you never got a skillcheck, you wouldn't cap. On the other hand, you get 3'100 if you duo one. The disparity is insultingly huge, so any points you don't get, just sucks
---
That was a contribution to the conversation, son. He added another option, it may not be a like-able option, but it‚Äôs better than nothing. 
---
What was her other add on though? There is an add on that transfers the terror radius to the tripped trap instead of around the Hag herself
---
How dare you disrespect Shaggy like that? Shaggy is more powerful at 0.00000001% of his power than the entity will ever be
---
If you are playing solo you are handicapping yourself, why change the game if you on purposely go into a harder game?
---
They miss a lot of the good ones tho
---
I refused to promote after I realized that a single instance of posting my video on a channel qualified as excessive and spam. At the rate this is going, this will likely be my second and final post on this site.  
---
Imagine it were a picture, you would not get this upset if it was a captioned image, so in what way does this truly differ?
---
I'm really not trying to be a stick in the mud, and I don't believe that I'm acting entitled.  I legitimately see no way in which my post violates any kind of ToS or even and understood, unspoken rule on the site.  Frankly since you claim to be uninvolved, I kind of think you're just trying to be difficult yourself.
---
That sounds like gold. If only
---
Excuse me,wtf? 
---
If you're talking about black box, don't use black box. It's garbage. If they spawn with another Survivor they'll wake up instantly and you're out of an add-on.
---
If you can get your hands on some Class Photos, though, those are awesome. Just check the pause menu to verify who the obsession is, then use the photo to keep hunting until you find them.
---
Nah it was just a swamp orchid necklet. I know the hag's addons and that's what got me so confused D:
---
Legion has breasts, pls explain.
---
Lol solo is the default gamemode, swf was only added because of whiners and is inherently way too good if you play in voice calls.
---
Ruin requires both, really. If you have potatoes that can't hit skillchecks, they could get considerably screwed over and get 10+ skillchecks. If they miss all of them, that's 50% regression, or 40 seconds you bought yourself. In a game where all gens can be gone in like 5 minutes, that's a lot. 
---
If on the other hand, you have one good runners, and three good players that do gens, it does fairly little, even if they never destroy ruin
---
My point is that the system was incredibly improved and it came with huge problems, even for such a small event. Something on the scale you propose would be much to hard to implement.
---
PTS just negates the nerf to gen speeds when there‚Äôs more than one person on it, it isn‚Äôt really that much faster than before. 
---
Maybe try to use a reddit account that is more than a day old, kinda suspicious if you ask me. Throwing a fit with the mods won‚Äôt help you, so just stop. 
---
That makes Rusty shackles a lot less terrifying than I imagined it to be for survivors :(
---
????????
---
SPIRIT IS NOT THICCCC. 
---
You mans don‚Äôt know thicc. 
---
I mean it's more of a horror game than this game ever will be. Some people are creeped out by zombies more than others. 
---
I would add something just as strong to survivors, like maybe an ACTUAL insta gen toolbox.
---
Wow, your taste is bad. I mean, there's also Feng, Kate, Trapper, David, and you pick this vanilla cunt?
---
Ok. 
---
They cannot comprehend Migatte no Shaggy.
---
There's also the strategy of going to check on ruin. At least 30% of the time, it guarantees you find a survivor, and even if they're SWF(And your totem's pretty much guaranteed to be dead), they have to cleanse it AND you have a chase in like 20 seconds
---
Wtf? Why would you do this to the killers? They don't deserve this kind of annihilation. This is supposed to be a suggestions for a survivor, not a ritual to summon God himself. 
---
Also, they did explain to you why they was removed. That was your only post on reddit. You didn‚Äôt involve yourself with the community at ALL. All you did was drop your own video here and did nothing else. You don‚Äôt deserve to keep it here if you aren‚Äôt part of the community whatsoever.
---
Don't you dare touch poor Meg! 
---
Because they‚Äôre mad that u killed their teammate so they‚Äôre tryna make u upset
---
Spirit is the best for your value.
---
She‚Äôs top 2 killer when played right, and you also get 3 Solid perks.
---
Spirit fury - very good for killers who have to deal with pallets, which is most.
---
Haunted grounds - can be nasty if you play it correctly.
---
Rancor - kind of crutchy, but I sometimes love punishing toxic teabagging ds users with it.
---
She is also not brainless to play yet unbearable hard.
---
Overall as I said, best value.
---
I would argue hag can be b-tier
---
*Like, Let‚Äôs Get Out of Here, Scoob!*
---
While in a chase, when you start sprinting you run in place for 1.5/1/0.5 seconds, before breaking into a sprint where you move at 125% movement speed for 4/4.5/5 seconds.  Afterwards, suffer from *exhaustion* for 180/150/120 seconds.
---
I seriously can't comprehend why people buy skins that they never wear, or skins as Killer in general. The only Killer cosmetics I ever buy are the versions of the weapons that cover up the least of the screen during the hit animation so that my field of view isn't blocked as much. 
---
Doesn't clown also have that crazy generator regression perk?  It's huge for people who are running killers that can be looped, because 3 gen strat is the fallback for these killers.
---
Can you flashlight blind Freddy if you aren‚Äôt in the dream state?
---
Along with that ... Why am I encountering a ton of Freddy‚Äôs after the latest update? Coincidence? Or did he get a buff? I go against him about every other time on PS4. 
---
What the fuck is the deal with PS4 and healing each other ever since the new update? Your person will stop two or three times before continuing and completing the healing action. Those precious five seconds have cost me more than once.
---
Nice bait.
---
Lol my bad. I‚Äôm sure it is that‚Äôs why people use it every game 
---
No no Shaggy controls the Entity, he isn't The Entity.
---
That's makes no sense. The new meta is not running self-care which makes sloppy practically useless. Regardless of the topic of running sloppy people still are not running self-care for the most part meaning no matter what people are having to heal other people, as if that is a complete waste of 5-10 seconds of your life. Your point is invalid. 
---
Lol IF the ban is only 2 days it's soooo worth it.

Yeah I'm straight and even I think default Meg is bested by David. But Back dimples Meg and skirt is bae. We're violating these poor characters, isn't it bad enough they die on hook? ü§£üò≠
---
Okay!
---
I think a totem counter in the corner of everyone‚Äôs screen would be a great QoL fix for this. 
---
Or you could be optimal with frenzy usage, that works too. 
---
Nothing. Don‚Äôt play him. It‚Äôs the worst game in the world for survivors and many will DC, costing you lots of BP.
---
I have never used Reddit before.  As I have stated.   I will not engage in dialogue with you further if you cannot even  comprehend that literally it would be impossible for me to do that.  The video was made this morning, I suppose I COULD just wait, take this thing for a test drive.  
---
Of course no one has given me any incentive to even continue using the site for a user standpoint, have they?
---
Just because I read and hardly use social media shouldn't pin me as a target.
---
XD
---
What are the positives of no mither?
---
yeah they really need to increase how many 100% offerings you get by default its like spend 150k just to get one bps
---
Only time I've taken out noed, was when I was playing with a guy who was streaming. Despite 20 second delay, all he had to say was 'We've cleansed 4 totems thus far' and I cleansed the last one, PURELY because he said that, preventing noed. If not, he might have gotten a 3K he definitely didn't deserve, and instead he got a 0K. Communication's just \*that\* strong. A single sentence made that much of an impact. So yeah, it's broken as sin, and while it may be fun for you to play WITH friends, everyone else thinks it sucks ass to play against it
---
That's pretty good
---
P3 Claudettes are practically invisible on some maps, and on Freddy in general. 
---
D A R N

Thanks

First of all we need Shrek in this game, and after they implemented him, they can go on with shaggy or whatever!

It's subjective, you get better at seeing through it over time
---
Yes o7
---
You can‚Äôt, you just get used to it. If survivors are spinning you then don‚Äôt lunge, just tap the attack button in the direction they‚Äôre turning when right up their ass so autoaim helps you. It‚Äôs good practice anyways since people like to throw dead hard early so this forces you not to make greedy lunges. 
---
Then don‚Äôt use the site. Nobody will care. 
---
If you refuse to acknowledge the reason it was removed then that‚Äôs your problem. I‚Äôve told you, and the mod outright told you.
---
Goodbye.
---
That‚Äôs how I feel every time. I did that and messaged the guy after telling him I was sorry for being a toxic killer and he was super irate. Shat can you do. That‚Äôs how Mafia works. 
---
Had it not been for this sub, my ears would've died. Holy fuck, it's NOT an exaggeration - it's so fucking loud. 
---
straight people......please take your mans out of here
---
i understood the joke, sue me
---
You say that like he has a limit
---
The fact is, this game‚Äôs skill cap is very low.
---
When you look at survivors, it‚Äôs the same thing just efficient looping. The most skilled killers/survivors can do in this game is mind game.
---
Since the entire game has low skill cap, it‚Äôs not an issue.
---
&gt;Huh? I've been using Bitter Murmur on a couple Killers without issue. What bug are you talking about?
---
When all gens are powered, it doesn't show the auras of ALL survivors for 10s. Instead it is showing the aura of those who finished the last gen and only for 5s. 
---
&gt;How so? I don't use bm
---
to say "no homo" is to show weakness
---
myers is hot (MAX HOMO)
---
Have you got them all? 
---
&gt;I'd say it's stronger at higher ranks than lower ranks. In lower ranks, people screw up regular skillchecks, don't touch gens, hide in lockers, don't have self care, can't loop, etc. Ruin borderline does nothing because you'd get a 3 or 4K regardless, on the account of inefficiency on the survivor side.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;In the higher ranks, there's a much higher chances that survivors have all the perks they need, know how to run the killer around, at least for a little bit, and instantly get on gens, making at least two pop by the time you've finished a chase, and on occasion, a gen pops before you even find any(Had this happen on both survivor and killer side of things)
---
The same way it works for add-ons and offerings. Just buy them over and over again. Meaning if lvl 1 shows up you can buy it 3 times for insta lvl 3.
---
NOED is a weak perk. If you want success with it you have to make a build to do so or rely on survivors just deciding they don't really care about escaping  
---
My strategy when a survivor goes into the corn is to sweep horizontally; like I'm scanning through the aisles at a grocery store looking for my mom. 
---
Huh, haven't noticed that in my game. I'll have to watch next time, to be sure.
---
When I'm talking with my friends while loading and we get Haddonfield my train of thought usually goes something along the lines of "Alright we got into a game - euauOOGGHHHH"
---
also bamboozle
---
THIS!!!  When I get really upset with this crap I do this and it works at these low ranks so well.  But the best is when it works at around Rank 8ish.  The salt is so tasty and you feel good enough to go back to playing normal.  
---
Didnt know devs added fall damage/s
---
Does that make Scrappy the complementary killer?
---
yep, she's got a butt. pictures should be Huntress, Leatherface (aka thicc billy), and then Clown
---
&gt; swf was only added because of complaining
---
That's not true. However, it's also not true that devs endorse voice comms and people need to stop lying about that
---
(also people who think solo is too hard play too much SWF and don't understand the game well because of that)
---
BBQ, bamboozle, overcharge, and the gen regression one
---
Off the top of my head, you wont make as much if any pain noises, and you dont leave a blood trail to follow, and you can pick yourself up from dying state infinitely. Downside being the always meme-worthy permanent damaged state that might honestly be okay but your perks on full display and the killer will always know he cant leave you on the ground so you'll just die easy. Fun.
---
Anyone have a link to the post where Feng had E Y E S?
---
I don't know why you are getting downvoted -- With how reluctant BHVR is to touch SWF, it's obvious this is a majorly used function.  I play with my GF all the time, if they somehow nerfed or allowed players to opt out of going against SWF I'd just find a new game for us to play.  
---
No one wants to sit in 20 minute lobbies.  Or if you are were SWF, never get a lobby cause there isn't a killer player that wouldn't opt out of SWF.  Not a single one.  
---
It was not actually explained I'm sure it is considered adequate, no disrespect to the mod, but should I post a copy of what I received on my end?
---
Perhaps that would be useful as I have basically been responding to you assuming you know what I received as a reason, but at this point that doesn't seem as evident to me.
---
This is all I received before contacting the mod personally, another thing I've done which is frowned upon, I suppose.

Pallet stun, if you can. He will probebly just yeet over the pallet if you miss anyway.

At least Small Game is sort of useful

Oooooo! I never even thought of that I'm gonna do it now! 
---
It's a mind game thing.
---
If I'm put in a trial with a Nurse who has that pumpkin head, I feel relieved because chances are she isn't good and thus extremely easy to juke for several generators.
---
If the Nurse has the black funeral/wedding dress cosmetic on, then I want to lie down and cry. 
---
Oh yes, but also too remember hitting a healthy survivor also gives them a small speed burst as well. Definitely wait for that animation to be over before hitting or as someone else suggested you can pull them off the person which stops the unhooking  and you get the other person 
---
r/bossfight
---
That would be a big and unneeded nerf to killers
---
Survivor mains always defend terrible totem spawns by saying "well, that's the risk of running hex perks" but for some reason that same logic doesn't apply to deciding whether to hunt and cleanse totems 
---
Most of the time, totem spawns are complete ass, and people will cleanse it just to cleanse it, long before you've got 2 or even 3 hooks. Also, the few times I've ran into it, I've managed to finish gens at 5 stacks, just because while the audio pop is nice, it's not 100% necessary, and as long as you're paying attention, you can hit skillchecks on reaction.  At least ruin is nearly guaranteed to do SOMETHING, regardless of duration(Unless it's blown up as soon as the match starts)
---
Please help me understand with my small squirrel brain how a single post is excessive, or spam?
---
Please help me understand how posting a meme on an imageboard is 'self-promotion'
---
i once moried a bitch. i was fun
---
Perks you see a lot; killer: BBQ chili (hands down best), hex ruin, enduring, sloppy butcher, no one escapes death (not a fun perk but can be good), nurses calling (used to be used a lot),  whispers, sometimes brutal strength, pop goes the weasel, haunted grounds, agitation, and spirit fury. On Myers/legion, monitor and abuse is a must and if camping (yuck), insidious. You can't really go wrong with these. I think discordance is amazing but I haven't seen it used often. 
---
As you can see, there's a lot of fine killer perks so if you're struggling, it's probably more playstyle? (Add-ons matter too but generally you're not going to mess those up).
---
Survivor: I usually recommend an exhaustion perk (Sprint burst, lithe, balanced landing or dead hard). Sprint burst is free and easy to use so it's a good starter choice. Self care and adrenaline are also all around solid choices. Urban evasion works with stealth play, and decisive strike is good if you can hit the check (or you can practice until you can). Prove thyself is now good for gens. Empathy is also good for tracking chases. Everything else I think is preference...
---
Ill just take my self care and unbreakable thank you very much.
---
r/dbdgonewild is over that way.
---
They finally fixed Prove Thyself! 
---
so that haddonfield window bug isnt fixed?
---
If I make 9 Comments on all of Mike_Steele's posts, would that be adequate, then?
---
Yes, you can blind Freddy when you aren't in the dream state. 
---
Pretty sure he didn't get any buff, but there are a lot of people that still enjoy playing him. It kind of feels rewarding when you get a 4k with Freddy, y'know?
---
It could be argued that Ruin is the only truly "good" killer perk, as every other killer perk is either a nice QoL (Brutal Strength, Endurance, BBQ), a perk that helps you with one strategy (Insidious, Monitor and Abuse, NOED) or is just plain bad. Ruin gives the killer what they need the most, which is more time.
---
Selfcare, D-strike, Exhaustion Perks, Adrenaline all are comparatively as good or better then ruin, as they can all make or break a game. If you do not see the impact survivor perks have on the game you need to play more, or try playing killer.
---
When does it start?!
---
You realize you get more BP when people d/c right?
---
There's a 'safety unhook' duration, in which if the killer hits the survivor while they are unable to move, they won't be downed. However, it's so buggy that half the time, it works for neither sides. Sometimes you'll go down while you're only half-way off the hook, and other times, as killer, you'll swing when they're moving and they'll still run off

Report them and move on. Hopefully they will get banned. 
---
Nope 
---
as a survivor main, i can in fact say that i am guilty of doing that, many times. you‚Äôd think i‚Äôve learned by now. üòÇ
---
It's also a terrible perk. I'm pretty sure he was making a joke
---
Because they're trying to grow there channel? I couldn't imagine being this mad at someone puting [t.tv](https://t.tv) in there name lmao
---
Why could they be banned for it? They‚Äôre just making sure that they can‚Äôt be hooked. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with what they did, it was their only chance of somewhat being saved
---
That‚Äôs what you get for slugging. You are the toxic one not them.
---
They added more logging this patch and I‚Äôd wager it‚Äôs to catch those abusing the exploits.  I‚Äôd err on the side of caution from this point on.
---
Nurse is easier to juke in open areas then enclosed ones.
---
Looping does not require mindgames unless the killer is playing poorly. A smart killer just doesn't respect pallets. The risk of "pallet mindgames" aka 50/50 reads is too great to be worth trying in most situations.
---
You do not need to break LOS to mindgame a nurse, you just need to break LOS to get away from her. She has two options: read you with a blink, or slowly float towards you. You sound like the kind of guy who has trouble with a Ryu who only spams hadokens at you. If a nurse catches you she is better at mindgames then you.
---
*When  you spend all game looking for totems, only to realise the hag has overcharge instead of noed and has a three gen setup, and you're in for a stall game where you'll inevitably have to give up*
---
ya, still not as bad as nurse
---
Nice repost bitch 
---
I felt like we've had a game together, cuz thats too specific.
---
Did you ever think that they want to play for fun as well?
---
waPOW
---
ECCHI! HENTAI! SHINEHHH!!! 
---
Ugliest female character other than Claudette and laurie
---
It is more about the amount of t.tv i see, its at least 2/3 games i see at red rank when im killer, and i really hate seeing them. they seem to t-bag and emote at the killer more than anyone else to "entertain" there 2 or 3 viewers. There is a reason all the big streamers dont have t.tv in there name. it makes you look desperate for views and it just seems trashy
---
Yep, we hope, but for more information I suggest you to check their twitter account tommorow. They'll let us know the exact time when will they release the event :)
---
&gt; This is not a "new wave" ever since nurse was released survivor mains AND killer mains have wanted her changed
---
lol imagine thinking this
---
&gt; making her easiest to play
---
okay yeah you've never played killer in your life
---
thank u, next
---
This might be the least thought out and most stupid complaints I‚Äôve ever read.
---
Most are little pricks and toxic too, I always mori up and i swear they all run the same builds.    
---
It's done to be toxic. Survivors teabagging at pallets, essentially guarantee they cover less distance while you destroy the pallet, than if they were to simply run, making it detrimental, but it's still a pretty big dick move
---
Hitting great skill checks on PS4 is hard. I mean, you can do it 5/10 times but the other 5 times fucks up the progress.
---
If it affects survivors it seems so.
---
&gt;Am i the only person, That when i see T.TV or Twitch.TV in someone name or something along those lines, i always put on the best add-ons and a mori and make sure they die? like, why do people broadcast there name like that. Its really annoying how many streamers play at purple ranks, and is SWF, I would rather have 3 normal players escape, than the 1 person with t.tv in there name. I just want to play the game for fun, i don't care about your stream, and i hope there viewers leave when i mori them.
---
oof
---
Talk about being petty. 
---
Guess what, sunshine, you don't have to care about their content if you don't want to, it doesn't make a difference to them. 
---
Then play and stream, don't broadcast your stream to the 3 people in your discord call, and the killer, u can tell your friends your streaming, no killer cares, and if they do, they are just stream sniping anyways.
---
Or you know do a real female...that's always fun.
---
What could possibly make this worth it for you

---
This happened to me once by a nurse that blinked her way across the map to find me nowhere near a gen. People dc'd soon after.
---
I can see the whole gang in dbd honestly. At least their outfits. 
---
I play on PC, so can't really speak for the console side. The PC side is definitely more optimized all around(Mouse movement, no 30 FPS dips, no stuttering skillcheck bar, etc.). The difference between a bad and a good player is easily distinguishable, both on gens and running the killer around, and having good players is just as important for gen progress, as it is for running the killer around. A bad survivor will still secure as much gen progress with three good gen repairers, as a single good runner with three bad ones
---
The best of the more modern Scooby-Doo shows ended with them actually encountering a real Eldritch Abomination who destroys reality and forces them into an parallel one.
---
nope seems to be they wanted you to focus on them rather the 2 that made it out 
---
Either Jason or Pinhead. Grabbing either, Jason especially, would shut down any other Slasher game from even trying. Not unless it was developed by a AAA developer and launched with several licensed characters. 
---
Patented TrapperDoor Spider. What you need:
---
* Insidious
---
* Franklin's demise
---
Recommended but not necessary:
---
* Iron Grasp, Agitation or Mad grit
---
* Distressing
---
* BBQ (for the points)
---
* Addons that darken the trap, make it harder to disarm, or hurt the survivors upon disarming.
---
How to play:
---
1. Locate the basement
---
2. Gather about 5 traps. if the basement spawned in a shack, put one under the window on the outside, one in the grass near the pallet, and another in the grass near the other door. Put the others where you please, I suggest one at the bottom of the stairs around the corner or in front of a box if it spawned upstairs. If the basement is not in a shack get creative with your trap placement.
---
3. wait in the basement around the corner with insidious
---
4. only come out if someone is trapped or they have tampered with your trap. do not chase them far.
---
5. put down a trap on any items you knocked away with Franklin's
---
6. be surprised at how often you get multiple kills with this strategy.
---
Yep, the big downside is that frenzy doesn‚Äôt last long so without an add on that increases duration time it‚Äôs not very efficient.
---
If they have t.tv or twitch in there name, they almost never have more than 3-4 viewers anyways. There chat is always empty, And it's a waist of time in there stream.
---
The killer was a fucking asshole, but that was a lil bit too much..
---
They were not playing the game at all, they weren‚Äôt escaping they were just sat in the corner waiting for me to leave so they could escape, while it was impossible for me to hook them.
---
Removed for salty after game chat 
---
They were holding the game hostage, which is bannale.
---
Incase you don't get what I mean. Doing something that prevents the game from progressing is holding the game hostage. These people were preventing themselves from getting to the hook which isn't bannale but constantly going back to the edge of the map to not progress the game at all is holding the game hostage. 
---
Julie instead of Frank?
---
That doesn't mean the people who write code are as focused or working as hard as the cosmetic team. Because when it comes to console, clearly they are not.
---
A Hex perk is a powerful perk that is tied to one of the totems. This is dignified by the hex being lit/burning. As long as the totem is up, the killer keeps the perk. If a survivor cleanses it, the killer loses that perk for the rest of the match. Unlit totems are NOT currently tied to any of the killers perks but can still be cleansed for some points. 
---
One hex perk; No One Escapes Death, doesn‚Äôt activate until all generators are completed and at that point a totem will BECOME lit. If survivors have already cleansed all the totems on the map, however, No One Escapes Death will not have a totem to be tied to and thus will not activate. This is a strong argument for always cleansing all totems regardless of if they‚Äôre active, since N.O.E.D. is very powerful. 
---
Nope not banable 
---
Ok. Thanks
---
Bro how was it physically possible for all 4 people to be up and alive meaning you didn't break any hooks yet and you still couldnt make it to a hook?  Short answer is it wasn't.  There is a hook you can make on every map assuming you didn't kill someone off on a bad hook.
---
Cuz it looks ATROCIOUS SIR! 
---
Your input is irrelevant. I have been playing for quite some time now and me throwing an idea out, from how I have seen survivors and killers playing, should not be looked down upon just because you can't get past your close-mindedness upon how the game currently is. This is clearly not something going to happen but rather just an idea I had that I figured some people might see interest on. Carry on.  
---
Nope, i forget the map name but it was on a the top floor of the house with a cornfield outside , the nearest hook was in the basement on the house and i had to go through 3 rooms, down the stairs then down more stairs.

Yes.... 
---
You are a weird survivor
---
1) Solo players do not need a buff
---
1a) If you think solo is too hard you play too much SWF and don't understand the game because of that
---
1b) Have too much trouble finding totems and have fever dreams about NOED? Well, you're in luck! There are perks for that!
---
2) it's literally insane that people look at SWF and think "hmm this is imbalanced against solo survivor" but apparently think the balance is fine against killer
---
&gt; A big and unneeded nerf to killers? It ONLY nerfs NOED
---
Totally untrue. If killer is running any hex and survivors know how many totems are left they're also aware of what zone they have not properly checked and can easily zero in on it. Running hex totems is a risk, but survivors having a counter as a base kit would increase that risk unnecessarily. 
---
&gt; a perk that gives every single killer a buff just because of its existence to the game, whether or not the killer is actually running it
---
&gt; It still slows the game greatly, especially if survivors are still seeking totems when they‚Äôre all already destroyed. 
---
It takes 60 seconds total to remove all totems if TotH is not being played, and that time would be spread out among all four survivors. That time is negligible. *And* slowing down the game is an intended feature. ffs, most things on the killer side is for slowing down the game. Being like "we need to nerf this becasue it slows down the game" is demanding to remove something the killer side needs. 
---
Anyway, I regularly encounter totems while playing the game normally and just bang it out. It hardly affects anything. And, again, you can run perks to reduce the hunting aspect if that's your issue.
---
Orgy with Legion
---
I know exactly what house you're talking about and that basement can be made assuming noone bodyblocks you every single time.  You took bad pathing on your way downstairs.
---
I played against a multitude of his many clones, and they were completely toxic in post-game lobby(Baby killer, EZ dude) and ingame(Flashlight clicking, teabagging at pallets, d-striking and salty that they got camped). Now, they're non-existant. So yes, I'm really thankful I'll never have to deal with the garbage he litered around again
---
Thank god they fixed the basement issue. I died like 4 times before I found out it was related to uncapped fps. Now I can re-uncap it and bask in the glory of DBD at 120+ fps.
---
My favorite is when someone WMI's you as another person is downed across the map, and then they just bolt and leave you there waiting for a heal that will never come.  Usually one or the other.
---
time of death?
---
Exactly. You use Claudette because she blends in and you think self-care is the best perk. From this paragraph alone, you are a typical teammate that I don't want to be paired with.
---
Self-care is overrated, and I don't like immersive teammates. They are not useful. Haven't you seen all the memes about Claudettes hiding in a corner? 
---
I have a question for you - do you use d-strike and urban evasion?
---
What has this subreddit become 
---
Shhhhhhhhhh don't scare the immersed potatoes.  
---
If I mention to stay there (by waving or pointing) and they run waaaay far away vs just like going behind a near rock, I just say fuck it and go work on a gen.
---
85% of the time they realize what's up and walk their bleeding self back to me or they find another way to heal themselves. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt trust it now.
---
Knowing behavior ‚Äúlogging more bloodweb data‚Äù - I feel like they purposely left it for one more day with this hotfix, so they can track who uses it from now on until it‚Äôs patched and then they can ban.
---
I am certain until now it was harmless, but now with the more logging there is a risk.

You make a good point, but I'm not the OP of the comment.
---
Can someone explain what they fixed with prove thyself? 
---
&gt; (also people who think solo is too hard play too much SWF and don't understand the game well because of that)
---
Implying that solo queue isn't basically just RNG due to the fact that red ranks are so easy to get into that you can still get put into a lobby with 3 useless survivors even at rank 1
---
Your experience is your experience. Doesn't mean what I said isn't true. Unironically, skins = skill.
---
Patch 2.1. They changed the BNP to do 15% of a gen over 5 seconds, with 2 difficult skill checks that add 5% each, and made it only delete itself after.
---
Sloppy Wraith literally only affected survs just btw.
---
Pig is really fun to play and very balanced. Myers is another killer I‚Äôd pick up. Both have decent perks and aren‚Äôt too bad, and are probably the most fun killers to play. Spirit is great, fun, but hard and very mind-gamey, like nurse but a bit different. Her perks aren‚Äôt bad either. 
---
Now I‚Äôm gonna talk about Freddy. He‚Äôs fun, his perks (aside from Fire Up) aren‚Äôt that bad, just situational. He‚Äôs fun though, and that‚Äôs enough for me to recommend him.

First off, bugs happen with cosmetics, it doesn't affect gameplay so it usually isn't high priority to fix due to that, second off ironically the outfit you're showcasing this on isn't even an Auric Cell exclusive, yeah you can buy it with Auric Cells but it's not even an exclusive like the ones from the Clown's and Spirit's themed collections and can be bought with Shards, plus you don't even own the cosmetic so why are you complaining?

Something tells me he wears a fedora. I AM A MEME.

Exactly even if they claim it‚Äôs not for this reason, Im sure they are just trying to catch people and ban, because they couldn‚Äôt before.
---
If you really care about your account here‚Äôs when to stop.
---
Before they had to get a report now they don‚Äôt.
---
Interesting never really heard or seen this , could be fun.

Search on the reddit browser, I'm on mobile right now

Is this what it looks like when she uses her true sight?
---
Okay, I know it said griefing, maybe ban evasion is in the griefing category or idk
---
And he wasnt griefing anyone in the last two matches? If you grief it takes days to get the ban 
---
On his older account he showed exploits, did [this](https://imgur.com/a/gDY2Xry),  witch hunted- griefed several ppl and the [toxicity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyOQexZJ6Dc&amp;feature=youtu.be) wtfff 
---
read the comments and the description and maybe watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBKEa3R1ru0&amp;feature=youtu.be) to understand 
---
this is why I think he got banned for ban evasion 
---
Get Spine chill. When the killer is looking at you it activates within a 32 meter radius. Pretty much tells you when the killer has seen you.

Also, 5 blink nurse is not a common occurrence. It's not a plague on your existence.

Why?

There are many things on this earth that even science cannot fully explain nor comprehend. This is one of those things.

This person backing the devs yet they don‚Äôt seem to realize that Claudette isn‚Äôt the only one with a Buggy outfit. 
---
Meg my bae
---
If being right means I have a stick in my ass, then I guess I have 3 sticks up my ass because I guessed 3 out of your 4 perks like a basic Claudette you are. 
---
If you want to take it as an insult, fine - but it's true. You play the generic Claudette stereotype, and there is your answer. You are part of the reason why people correspond characters to players. Like dude for real, I don't even know you apart from the fact you play Claudette and I guessed your build.
---
Also I don't main Jake - look at my flair, I am a Quentin main. My current perk build is No Mither, Dead Hard, Deliverance and Adrenaline.
---
Wait for them pesky hag traps..

Would be unbalanced. We all know shaggy is more powerful than the entity, even if you limit his power to .000000001%

I am calling it not viable, I do think I am open-minded, and I will continue to. Thanks for your great input. 
---
Ofc pal.Not even the depip squad could win against a 5 blink nurse.Guess they need to git gud too?
---
I'm at devotion 2, level 70-something, and I started a while before the devotion system was implemented. Only got three P3's(Almost four. Good ole' doctor's joining in
---
Wow dude, the salt is real. Also, if pallet stunning into flashlight blinding are okay for survivors then he can camp if he wants. It's on the team to counter it, if they don't then it works and won't break the habit. Both sides have frustrating things they can do and it's only when you punish it properly (rather than bitch anonymously on the internet) that it will end.
---
Ah okay, I see! I didn‚Äôt realize I had my Dwight dressed up the same as my boyfriend but it all makes sense now lol. That‚Äôs really neat! 
---
Thanks for the quick answers! 
---
You were on your 2nd hook (struggle phase). The mori bypass that and gives the killer a long animation while doing so (usually longer than hooking someone would cost in time).
---
*FBI wants to know your location*
---
ye
---
when this happens i just say "big brain pig" and laugh at them because the person with trap waste time trying to get the box off
---
Ya seem triggered, perhaps looking at the ass will cure your depression and help you find better nutrition to get through the day. 
---
So they post about it on r/dbd, obviously. 
---
yeah i had a feeling that they would stealth patch in some way to track progress hence why it wasn't fixed today, so they can try and catch people doing it. Honestly it would have been easier to fix it and let people keep what they got cause there are more pressing issues at hand, and it would really take more effort than it's worth just to reset some glitched progress, but you know, making smart decisions isn't what BHVR is really good at.
---
Also the engine does matter if the people using it are dumb or simply not skilled with it. Look at Killing Floor 2. It still uses UE3, but runs and looks better than DbD. The devs also chose to use UE3 instead of 4 because they were more confident with UE3 and it had everything they wanted. Meanwhile BHVR chose UE4 for shits and giggles and look where we are now. Runs like trash on both PC and console and it looks like a last gen game that plays like a PS2 game.
---
I've always liked the idea of opossums as pets. They're just so darn cute and I haven't heard of any outstanding aggression problems like raccoons. It's too bad no one thought to make them mainstream, but I'd rather they not be domesticated at this point.
---
Just change the resolution in the config file. Should start the game up whatever you have it set at. 
---
I can easily make mistakes, however the difference between having 3 people that know how to manage their time well in-game (Or simply taking Borrowed Time, God's gift to mankind tm) and 3 people that don't can definately be the difference between people surviving and people getting sacrificed. That doesn't even consider the advantage of being able to give one another intel.
---
If you believe otherwise I'd probably accuse you of not understanding the game.
---
&gt; Man, you guys will just cry about anything.
---
If you say so.
---
i hope they dont reset my account i have 5 legit P3's and almost every teachable
---
[Why do you have to remind me...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PStC-LNZ2s)

Hahahah, it's just the opposite, I'm getting a nice laugh out of this exchange. Though looking at the Spirit's butt is, indeed, very therapeutic. Same goes for eating ramen :P
---
The first 150 times it is. Then it becomes dull and looks stupid.
---
Gotta agree. 
---
I did this once to a campy killer and got screwed. 
---
I deserved it and will never do it again. üòÇ
---
The Feral Frenzy tracking is not as devastating as it sounds, and when you can see them on the whole map it's actually pretty disorienting and you can't really tell how far away they actually are.
---
I love playing against a Legion with that add-on, it's a blast
---
That's probably the issue. Trying to get non-obvious traps - like, on the other side of the loop rather than *directly* at the pallet / window. Because I think survivors can't be *that* dumb.
---
definetly learned my lesson as well
---
yeah i highly recommend to cut it here and play it safe
---
A bloodthirsty vampire.
---
Good for you. I'll be sure to come back in a week to see if you're cured of your depression, most likely won't be though considering your part of this community. 
---
I was on my first hook. Game just started. 
---
That's a feature 
---
What's wrong with this community? You dislike it just because some people decided it'd be a good idea to take a peek up the Spirit's skirt?
---
You were hooked once, smh... you were on your 2nd hook
---
Just because he has slept someone else, or left you alone for a bit doesn't mean he isn't just going to come back when he sees that you've started to try to wake up, and it can be hard to react in enough time to get somewhere safe enough with only a 16m heads up.  Even at 24m, people often assume the same thing you just said, that he's chasing someone else so their goal should be to wake up ASAP.  If you respect this ability that he could pop up at any second regardless what you think he might be doing and make sure you only heal at safe areas instead of trying to wake up ASAP, then he can just get value from you wasting additional time on top of the half speed sleep debuff.  I agree people play him so blatantly, which is the exact opposite of his necessity.  He can easily create situations for survivors to make mistakes and misread the situation, since his kit allows for him to be wildly unpredictable with little risk of actually losing anyone from it.  Just the threat of being slept is a bit dubious in how threatening it actually is, as it does cost a lot of generator progress and you have little heads up when he may pop come back.
---
If he's chasing you, he has no real reason to commit if it would take him a long time to get another hit, and that goes for almost every chase.  He can very easily bounce back and forth between people, catching them off gaurd/in poor positions and making sure nobody is making much generator progress buying him even more time to ensure he gets fast hits and more sleeps.  If he's on your ass, he's on your ass until he gets a quick and easy hit or leaving if that's not possible given your current location to do the same for someone else and then returning when he can get another easy hit on you, or at least resleep to make sure you're not accomplishing much.
---
Makes sense, thank you!
---
Sorry, I was rude.
---
Look, you can get shitty teammates and that sucks. You're right. But that does not mean that solo needs a buff, which is the mindset I was responding to and isn't connected to the issue you brought up
---
I'm tired of having to tab out and reply to you, so if you could kindly stop talking and go back to jerking it to this fictional character. That would be nice.

Hmm. No way that basement is sanitary.

Because when the trap is on somebodies head you know where they are going. It's a much safer bet to find them due to the beeping and need to find a box.

Thanks so much! Kinda got my head around it now, !!

Damn why didn't I ever think of thisüò•

His mori is lame lol

That is hot.

Might not draw a lot of viewers but I don‚Äôt see the harm in it? Best case scenario they get more viewers, worst case scenario they don‚Äôt

Yes, very much this. 
---
Pretty sure this is a recent thing, as it used to be fine.
---
We can fix that. Just stay here and have a nice chat with me, no need to switch tabs. I don't, and have never jerked off to any fictional characters honestly, it doesn't appeal to me. it's just aesthetically pleasing. If you don't like butts, it's okay, I can respect that.

Like nea's last one, where the green hair clips through her shoulder... 
---
I think this is a question for r/dbdgonewild. Not this sub.

Stop talking.

‚ÄúTentatively fixed an issue causing players to get stuck loading into a game if a player would disconnect during the loading sequence. This is a difficult to reproduce issue, and we'll be tracking the result of the change on the Live environment after this update.‚Äù
---
Or... you know... you could just stop the game from happening if someone disconnects before the game starts.  Because any game that starts with less than a 4v1 is fucking garbage.  No?  Just gonna slap the bandaid ‚Äúone less generator‚Äù onto the team‚Äôs severed arm?  OK then.  I‚Äôm sorry for believing you could be competent for 3 whole seconds.
---
How do you know that? I glitched like 5 survivors and 4 killers to p3, and recently saw a guy who was permabanned on ps4 (the platform I did the glitch on)
---
Someone sat infront of a desk somewhere working on these outfits and then going ¬´YEP! Its finished!!¬ª And then putting it out in the store.. 
---
Another fun fact is that the survivors present at the campfire are the ones you most recently played as. 
---
I just saw DBD and followed it I didn‚Äôt know there was a different subreddit. I‚Äôm new to reddit üòÖ
---
I know one thing it didn‚Äôt do and that‚Äôs fix the massive bug that doesn‚Äôt allow survivors to heal each other. 
---
The only problem is that you get disconnect points in Brutality. Usually I max out Brutality in the trial and I'm after Sacrifice points.
---
So one could say it slows the game down just a little bit.
---
Well, let's do the math on his add-ons then. 3.5M in green offerings. 2.4M in purple and 600'000 in ebony moris. Now, of course, you're not going to ONLY get that, but that's 6.5M right there. There's also the fact that there's two prestiges before this one, so we're now talking at least 9.7M for a SINGLE prestige. We can also remove at least 10% of the toital points since he's level 91(And the grind is higher at 90 than at 1, so it's fair to say we could round off)
---
Now we're at around 11.3 million BP just with the green, purple, red offerings and the base cost of the three prestiges of ONE killer(No yellow or brown ones, add-ons or perks) and a total availability of 16.7M points rounded up. We're also not taking into account the fact that there's a third prestige not added into the math here. So I have to ask, is it literally even possible? Because you can't tell me he got MORE green offerings than brown and yellow ones, while also getting all the perks he wanted.
---
So we can at bare minimum, realisticly, throw in at least a hundred of what, 6 yellow offerings? - 13.7M And then 6 more brown ones, just for good measure - We're now at 15.5M. Now we top that off with 35 levels into leatherface, which is like a good 700K points - 16.2M. Then another 700K points and we're at 16.9M. Then another 700K for billy and we're at 17.6m. It now becomes pretty much impossible to obtain it all. But you could make the argument that he got more than 32K points per game, BUT then I could just throw in the fact that we have no idea what other teachables he probably has, nor how many add-ons he has, and if anyone did this legit, I can guarantee you, they'd have a metric shitton of both perks and add-ons, which would probably at least double the cost, and nobody's going to get perfect games every single game for 580 games
---
Wait, are you complaining about the second hit? Dude, you were totally within range lmao
---
Spirit. She phases, appears inside the survivor and bursts their body into pieces. Cut to screen that says ‚Äòfatality‚Äô. 
---
Freddy's sleep debuff can apply way more pressure(slowed generator progress) than Wraith can usually manage.  Freddy can benefit from a hit and run playstyle more than any other killer, ensuring people stay slept/injured and never get much time to bust out generators.  Committing to bad chases is how every killer can lose, but Freddy gets value just from having slept without even necessarily having to get that first hit even.  He never really has to commit to anything, and can keep pressure on everyone much easier than most other killers.  He's one of the only killers that benefits from just finding survivors(which is also probably the very easiest as Freddy), without even having to do much else unless it's not going to cost him much time that could be spent managing someone in a worse position.
---
But if you tunnel someone from the second they get off the hook, the trap isn‚Äôt even needed because the survivor doesn‚Äôt get away from the hook. 
---
Not doing math on addons, you said you couldn't p3 with that level, you can. Simple as that.
---
no thank
---
Only harm ive seen is when they are in playing against a big name streamer. Their viewers tend to bomb their stream due to how they play a lot and the end game chat shit they spit.
---
I did it once to a dude who unhooked me in front of the killer. I got rehooked immediately and wouldn‚Äôt take a hit for me, so I got the killer on him 
---
I like that but doubt it would work here, too much salt from both sides. It saddens me though to think in order for ppl not to be a douche you gotta pay them. 
---
Same thing happened to me and I have yet to have it re-appear :( rip exclusive item
---
Not with those offerings and perks, you can't. Talking EXCLUSIVELY about P3'ing a killer? Sure, that's do-able. Doing what this guy did? Mathematically impossible

Look buddy - play what you want. Just know that it's not you who decides if I play with you - it's me. 
---
And I won't be, because guess what? Like I said, I dodge lobbies with Claudettes in them. They just tend to be brain-dead and useless. This is just a general opinion of the DBD community, everyone bashes on Claudettes.
---
I think the Wraiths should change as well, but I think he should bing bong their head in with the bell - just stand over their body and go to fucking town with that bell BING BONG BING BONG BING BONG!!!! For added affect, every time he smashes them they go in and out of cloak.
---
Also, Trapper should place a trap on the ground and curb stomp them into the trap
---
So I‚Äôm considering buying the clown, the pig and Michael. From my understanding, the pig is generally decent but not great, but seems fun to play. I don‚Äôt see the clown much and he seems fun, and that‚Äôs appealing to me. Michael is awesome and I think that goes without saying. I may get 1, 2 or all 3 of them. I‚Äôm still newish to the game, but I consider myself a pretty decent, mid tier player. I‚Äôm rank 13 as killer at the moment. Any suggestions about getting any or all of these killers?
---
If you are playing pig always go for the unhooker. That means you are taking two players out of the game. Once you down the unhooker, and trap him, you can easily track the unhooked and down him again. 
---
Just because a survivor is in high ranks, doesn‚Äôt mean they are able to land skill checks well.
---
Ruin absolutely hurts the survivors at every rank. Landing a great skill check every time is impossible. And because of this, because WILL mess up skill checks at every rank when Ruin is up.
---
Like I said, as someone who has been to rank 1 as killer, there is a clear difference between the games where my Ruin is found immediately and when it is not. Games are much much easier (at ALL ranks) when Ruin is up. Is it stronger in lower ranks? Sure. But like I told the guy before you, Ruin is strong at every rank. Period.
---
You can look up any good streaming (True Talent, Monto, etc.), and they all run Ruin. There is a reason why people say it‚Äôs the best perk for killers next to BBQ. It‚Äôs because it is. Please don‚Äôt just say these things because it‚Äôs fun x)
---

---
Oh really? They likely did it on purpose then. They were being toxic all match so I was glad to have finally caught them, then my game crashed. That's lame.
---
Wait. Like at all? You can't heal? How long has that been going on? Goddamn. I feel like everyone on PS4 has a different experience with different things wrong with the game. 
---
I love that idea for a perk!
---
That shouldn‚Äôt get you banned
---
The necessity comes from his barebones kit. He struggles with finishing a chase. Ping ponging between two survivors guarantees two are doing gens and that you're downing nobody. Sure, you're delaying two of them, but two others are given literally no incentive to ever get off a generator. Even if you sleep all four, you can really only focus on one, and at any given moment you let the others go, they're well past gone. 
---
Most maps also have enough pallets or windows to just get out as soon as Freddy comes within line of sight. His terror radius isn't even usually the biggest dead give away, because the dream world is so white that the red stain could just as easily be a rave party approaching you. He doesn't have the ability to travel from one place to another on the map, meaning that every moment you're ping-ponging, someone's repairing a gen, pretty much guaranteed.
---
I've never seen it bugged like that before... probably a recent bug. When it released I know for sure it wasn't like that
---
Since it's a client-side config file and doesn't actually affect anything outside the settings in a similar way to the in-game Settings options you should be A-OK for this type of tweaking.
---
By the time you do that, it's likely the other person had already gotten the trap off. It doesnt matter what killer you are, an easy target is an easy target. Knocking one person out of the game permanently is more important that getting out one person temporarily.
---
‚ÄúNurse is easier to juke in open areas than in closed ones‚Äù no. Please explain. I want you to play against a good nurse. Also, if you aren‚Äôt mindgaming you‚Äôre a bad survivor/killer. Imagine not faking an L wall t wall vault or imagine not doubling back on prediction to a survivor vaulting. Imagine not faking shack vault in anticipation of a killer doubling back to catch your vault attempt. Imagine not moonwalking as killer and switching directions as a survivor in anticipation of a moonwalk. The game is not just about respecting pallets. 
---
At least this one is linked to his lore
---
How could you say something so wrong, yet also so wrong?
---
I use the traps as insurance that even if they get away, they didn't really get away. But then again I've only done like 3 games as the Pig so far, so there's probably a better strat.
---
There‚Äôs different reasons as to why a Pig does or does not go for someone with a trap. 
---
The reason you‚Äôre referring to is because it‚Äôs easier to tunnel and kill someone with more to do on their hands. It‚Äôs also easier to track them. 
---
A legit reason is when the trap is not active and they have already searched a box or two. In this case, the trap will barely do anything.
---
It is best NOT to go for someone with an active trap on their head unless they are the last survivor, or you want to give them their second hook. If they have an active trap on their head and they are on their death hook, I leave them be. 
---
Inactive traps don‚Äôt do shit, especially when they have already searched boxes. Active traps shouldn‚Äôt be targeted unless it‚Äôs a unique situation. 
---
Its good to know though - Now I understand when a game loads in properly for me but there's always 1 missing survivor. :P  
---
If they start running it means that they have more important stuff to do. You should respect their decision to be absolutely useless. Even if I have we¬¥ll make it it happens. I love working on my own. If they wanna bleed somewhere it¬¥s all good. I¬¥m not going to waste any time myself
---
Because BVHR.

Jeez, it's MY FUCKING OPINION. STOP FUCKING JUDGING PEOPLE BY THEIR OPINION.

Why would you reference that abomination
---
Accuracy is the flashlight sway
---
Fair enough but I assume that the minority of players putting their twitch in their username will go up against big streamers
---
It really makes more sense for Shaggy to be a killer, but the survivors play as killers too so they have a chance of escaping.
---
Yup! hahah I don't care. Cosmetic hacking is nothing and does nothing to ruin the game. Lag switching is real.

absolutely amazing

Killer is easy mode. If you have issues then it's your fault 100%. Most games I 4K at rank 1.
---
Perks: scooby snack
---
Eat a scooby snack to increase in size 5x and for the next minute you can hunt down the killer.
---
It's simple logic.
---
Someone who is willing to grind for shards to buy a skin, or straight up buy a skin with real money, is someone who likely plays the game a lot. If you play the game a lot, then you probably are better than someone who doesn't play as much. This idea isn't hard to understand, and is perfectly plausible - this isn't my experience. This is just truth.
---
You have no concept of what is bannable or not.
---
I'm sure it is evidence. I'm just saying that with claims that serious, one shouldn't be carelessly throwing them around without providing a link to some proof or context in the same post.
---
I've heard enough of Ochido to know he's a grade A cunt. I'm certainly not defending him. But I'm not a fan of random pedo accusations either, hence my request for evidence. People have provided such, so now the world is right again and I have done my good deed.

Can you cite something to back up why you think this is a fact? And don't just repeat your logic that buying cosmetics equals caring more equals playing more equals greater skill, you need something to show that logic actually represents reality

I like to perform ‚Äúsoft tunneling‚Äù.  I won‚Äôt hook the same dude over and over, but if one person‚Äôs trap is active what I like to do is keep knocking them down while they‚Äôre at a Jigsaw box, then immediately stealthing and then wandering off.  Their teammates THINK that I am stealthed nearby and I‚Äôm trying to bait them and they will be very apprehensive in coming to help their comrade, making them move much more slowly and cautiously than they ought to wasting a bunch of time.  Often, they won‚Äôt come to help until they have seen one of their friends get attacked, effectively earning me as much time as a proper hook would get me.  Then, once their comrade is back up, I‚Äôll run back over and immediately knock them down again while they‚Äôre searching the box.  They can‚Äôt heal because their timer is ticking, they can‚Äôt crawl away from the box because coming back would waste their time, I know with 75% certainty that they are going to get right back onto the same box that I downed them near.  If not, then I‚Äôve increased the chance of a head pop by forcing them to relocate to a new box without checking the first, which they may be forced to come back to.  By doing this, I can keep pressure on three people for the price of one, and if they catch onto my game I can just do exactly what they expect me to do (ducking around a corner while stealthed and ambushing any person who comes to help up their friend).  This also saves on beartraps since I don‚Äôt need as many deployed to slow down just a little bit, saving more for the end game.
---
So yeah, I don‚Äôt do the idiot thing of just re-hooking the trapped over and over, but I do use one person at a time to continuously fuck their friends by proxy.
---
I'm planning to get her first once I reach 9000, I like her playstyle. Matter of taste I guess. Getting something fun seems more worth it to me than getting it for the perks (then I'd probably want Bamboozle first anyway... although I'm guilty of just that thing for LF).
---
Even if we can‚Äôt get Shaggy as a survivor, it‚Äôd be a pretty cool idea to make a map a giant haunted mansion now that I think about it. Really, any of the Mystery Machine members would be great in this game and have some obvious and fun perks
---
Probably the most trash meme I‚Äôve seen on here. And they get pretty bad. 
---
what about freddy? darn
---
I made a mistake okay. I confused Ori with this game. And yes I do make games, I am even in college right now for game dev
---
I want both Shaggy and the Killer to have teleportation based locker perks or abilities so you can have a scene like in the show where the killer and Shaggy are both running in and out of random lockers. At one point you see Shaggy chase the killer. At one point it's just the killer confused. A random Dwight sneaking out of a locker
---
Andy new killer confirmed 
---
I play her quite often and find it's just hit them then use your power to follow the sound. It seems to work almost all the time.
---
Perk: Scoob!
---
*Years of catching monsters has taught you communication is key*
---
When you see the killer you emit a ‚ÄúZoinks!‚Äù alerting nearby survivors of the killers location for 1 second.
---
Cool down of 60/50/40 seconds.
---
lmao imagine thinking P3 players are super skilled. Just wow
---
There is so much bullshit in that logic. For one, a P3 Dwight doesn't even mean they play survivor a lot! It could easily be a person who plays, like 10:1 killer to survivor and dumped tons of BP into Dwight because they simply like him and want to use that for their occasional survivor game
---
I've played for 20 hours or so. The issue I have is that I get queued into killers with said perks while I have none of the only good ones.
---
I have 3 killer dailies though but I've never played killer. I assume I'd make a fool of myself if I tried it.
---
&gt; Also lol okay on your last point. If you think a legacy dwight is likely to be equal in skill to a basic dwight then... okay.
---
I told you in the other chain why this logic is ridiculous 
---
Leatherface's copyright is different to Jason's, Jason is in a strangle hold by the Friday the 13th game.
---
thank you for the very informative and helpful response i will use this information wisely
---
how does one try the item glitch?...... asking for a friend.......
---
How did you start the mori before he jumped in?  Usually there's that dumb post-hit animation that would give survivor time to escape. Did you down the obsession near the hatch but not on top of it?
---
Then obviously the survivors you play against don‚Äôt know how to mindgame. 
---
Yeah sorry I had mistaken Ori with this game for the engine
---
I didn't say P3, P3 is easy to get. 
---
I said Legacy P3 - Someone who was playing the game since the old grinding system since 2016, someone who has the golden, reflective P3 with the gold textures. Please pay attention. Do you even know what legacy P3 is?
---
To be fair, this game is supposed to be an asymmetric horror game, and it feels like it when you first play with a bunch of newer players.
---
Once everyone knows what they're doing, the horror aspect quickly disappears because it just feels like a game of tag as a survivor, and "oh shit on shit oh shit I gotta stop them" as killer.
---
He doesn‚Äôt even need to use any of his power to destroy the entity.
---
Never defended the guy, you said it was impossible to get p3 at that level, I proved you wrong and now you're trying to argue over something I never said. Its ok to be wrong sometimes just accept it.
---
A raptor.
---
I think you got confused between P3 and Legacy on the other chain.
---
Nope
---
If you‚Äôre not in dying state then yes
---
Ooh but would there be an exit sound? 
---
I think you can't use it in dying state
---
&gt;Does hitting someone on borrowed time with frenzy end frenzy like hitting someone twice with it does?
---
Yep, because BT now grants the Deep Wounds status effect if the unhooked person is hit. 
---
&gt;Is there a counter to noed after it triggers?
---
Cleansing the dull totem that activated and became a lit hex totem after the last gen was powered. 
---
You can pre-emptively cleanse all dull totems on the map if  you want to stop NOED from even activating if you want. However if you don't want to spend the time hunting down all the totems, then your best bet is to mentally remember where you see dull totems as you play the match, and then do a quick scan once the last gen is completed.
---
What generally ends up happening is if you go hunting for totems, if you cleanse each one you come across, NOED is probably going to spawn in a fairly hidden spot. Whereas if you just remember the 1-3 totems you'll see while running around, you'll have a better chance of finding it. 
---
Obviously each strat has its pros and cons. Figure out what you're most comfortable with and go with that.
---
I mean I know that rank one isn't hard to get to, but really, all of them are bad? I guess the true pros just don't make any noise ever.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
okay thanks, just had this scenario and I was wondering because to me it seems logical tbh ü§î
---
It won't, only if you mess with the save file. 
---
What do you play on and what will/is your screenname???
---
Asking for a friend(s).
---
The grass is always greener. I am usually in red ranks for survivor and it's pretty sweaty and not very many casual games. Either your team is really good or they're "good" and deliberately try to screw you over. Learn how to escape chases and jukes. I am not sure how you're playing but if you're not running the killer for long period of time then I would suggest getting better at evading.
---
I grew up on Haddonfield, and I can tell you that it's definitely not a very loud town.

---
If you don‚Äôt have those 2 the killer is dogshit. Smart survivors won‚Äôt heal since his powers injures very quickly, and although it makes them 1 hit from death, you‚Äôre also 110% movement speed which is worse than being injured. You can keep putting people in deep wounds, but you‚Äôre also not making any progress of your own since mending takes almost no time in comparison to your 110% movespeed chases. 
---
They added a crunch to the final stomp, but it needs to feel harder, like an American History X curb stomp.
---
"What's this? A knife for ants?"

Huntress would like a word
---
Uh, that makes sense too. Thanks !
---
1. A nerf in one area does not dictate a buff in another area. 
---
1a) I never said solo was difficult, I said the counter would give solo players the same advantage. 
---
1b) I never said I had trouble finding totems. I said it‚Äôs dumb to have people looking for totems because there‚Äôs no way to tell if they‚Äôre all destroyed. 
---
1.bonus) you put a fuck ton of worth‚Äôs in other people‚Äôs mouths. 
---
2, you severely lack the ability to approach this topic from a ridiculously unbiased (and yes, wrong) perspective because you‚Äôre mad butthurt that SWF exists. I won‚Äôt waste my time trying to tell you that you‚Äôre wrong. 
---
Scooby Doo on Zombie Island also featured real zombies and werewolves, thinking about it a lot of the Scooby Doo movies have real monsters in them...

First off I‚Äôm not entirely sure you aren‚Äôt exaggerating. Secondly, if the survivors who play against you are doing bad it‚Äôs because their mindgame skills are weak. And if you aren‚Äôt exaggerating about doing so well as spirit then maybe you‚Äôre just better at her than you think. All in all she still has s pretty high skill ceiling. 
---
Personally, I don't seek out survivors with the trap on. But if I run into a survivor with a trap on, chances are they are injured, and that ensures me an easy hook. Though if I know a survivor is on their death hook with the trap on and I run into them, I just down them and leave them. Imho the RBT is much better used as a stalling tool rather than a killing one. So by downing someone on their death hook rather than hooking them outright, you force the survivors to waste time by having at least one person rescue them and still having the trapped survivor forced to look through boxes instead of doing gens.
---
Hey now, huntress has a high skill ceiling too. Let‚Äôs jus let peacefully agree that she and the spirit are tied. 
---
&gt; Please pay attention. Do you even know what legacy P3 is?
---
I'm barely reading your comments because someone who thinks skins equals skill is a nub. Only saw P3 initially
---
Someone with P3 Legacy could have been away from the game for a long time and could suck now. It literally only tells you they were playing a lot when it was released 
---
Also, I love how you fucking moved the goalposts fucking miles. No longer are you saying it's paying for skins that equals skill. You realized how absurd that is, and are unable to admit it, so you're just moving the goalposts. This is just amazing. I love you.
---
Explain pls
---
Removed - Unrelated Content

True. I‚Äôd still like some QoL so that solo players would know when all totems are off the map. Perhaps a specific noise indicator, if not a counter. Something different from the thunder noise. Or just an indicator in general to show it‚Äôs all gone once the last totem is destroyed. 
---
Fair enough 
---
Why did you list Claudette twice? 
---
Most experienced survivors know the spawn locations, or hit greats, or... gen tap. but every second that ruin gives is worth using it.
---
Looks like all that madness finally caught up with him
---
The game keeps giving me Pig dailies, and I don't like playing her because I don't have any good perks or addons for her. And I don't play against people who fall for the Ambush stuff, AND I keep getting Coldwind maps.
---
I deadass am barely reading your dribble :shrug:
---
Bond is great. It allows you to see that useless teammate who is leading the killer directly to you. 
---
I do, its just a stupid question.
---
haha thanks
---
I've been trying to avoid rank ups, so I'll try to play the game super sweaty at the beginning, trying to end chases fast and hook everyone at least once. If for some reason I get bent over a pallet and violated... well, survivors win and I did my best.
---
If I'm clearly winning, I'll stop from 3rd hooking anyone. And just down a survivor, bring them to a gen, and let them complete it.
---
That way, if they don't want to farm, they had a mostly good game of chases and rescues and can then leave as soon as the gens are done, or can stay in the game and farm up some BP.
---
Me when taking a big shit.
---
How about the fact he has no counterplay?
---
Oh so he only uses the wreaths up to the point where there is only one left and not the 100 moris, map offerings, black wards, coins and oaks? Makes total sense
---
Stop pulling random shit out of your ass and accept the fact that this guy is cheating. You‚Äôre the one who doesn‚Äôt know dick about how progression works in this game
---
Lol maybe.
---
You can have your opinion but that doesn't make it right 
---
goodbye then
---
Still playing solo is still handicapping yourself.
---
Well, I mean, if we're being technical, a game where the killer lets you win is pretty easy.
---
I know. It's just my way of looking at things 
---
Hard cringe
---
What if they‚Äôre having fun with those three or four viewers? Then it‚Äôs not a waste of time.

Playing as a 3 man swf is the worst number of people to queue up with. It‚Äôll be a lot easier to find games as 2 or 4. Though u agree that having to wait almost an hour is ridiculous. Sometimes it helps to unready and ready up again.
---
Are you on drugs or what?They played optimally you did not.

Happy Cake Day!
---
Not sure about any guides on youtube or anything for her, but I play her from time to time so I can give you some general tips. 
---
She can be a really fun killer, but unfortunately her ability is completely luck based so you can play really well with her and still lose which sucks. But as far as perks go, I run BBQ (obviously), Enduring, Ruin and Whispers. 
---
I think whispers is really good on her because as soon as whispers turns on, I go into stealth mode so I can sneak up on survivors. But really the 4th perk is up to you since not alot of people like whispers. If no whispers, then I would recommend NOED for the end game or spirit fury for tearing through pallets faster.
---
Her best add-ons in my opinion are Tampered Timer paired with Jigsaw's sketch (two purple ones). This increases your chances of getting a head pop. Last will is also a good choice for an extra trap. 
---
Also, don't crouch around too much with her. She's super slow and can't see well in the crouch state, so only use it when necessary. Other than that, she's pretty straight forward. 
---
Good luck man!

I know that the queue times suck. They do for me and my friends too but we don‚Äòt wait that long.
---
Hope it helps and good luck!
---
\^This.
---
Sometimes there's something else going on with it, like it freezes you just before or it pulls you towards it. I think it's the game moving the killer into the correct position. It is indeed very stiff.

No doubt they'll fix it 6 months from now.

Stop getting triggered when someone speaks their mind.

Imaginary girls are perfect though. Why would I ever want to be with a real person?
---
Obviously no killer can always chase 4 survivors simultaneously, but Freddy has the easiest time keeping multiple people busy out of every killer.  He can ping pong between 3, sometimes 4.  Even just two though is slowing down the game more than another killer would be in the same situation, especially once those easy hits start converting to hooks.  The game can quickly become a slog for the survivors.  People tend to not work on gens if they're injured, particularly against a killer they don't get much heads up for.  Sure, most maps have a pallet close enough to a gen to be able to stop a fast hit, but once that's used up then suddenly they can't try to wake up from that gen without risking getting hit.  
---
It can be like a tier 2 Myers though, depending on the map you may be seen before the small terror radius would be relevant anyway making it a little less effective, but man is it great to have people running around like crazy, not knowing where you are or when you're going to commit to a chase.  Even SWF have trouble keeping up with it, at least with most red rank squads. 
---
Pretty sure your choice in torso cosmetics determines who you play. Masks and knives/rulers can be switched out without effecting it(i'm guessing)
---
&gt;Quality&gt;Quantity
---
This^
---
Ace's cosmetics are the best imo.
---
His dark-purple robe and pants outfit is perfect with the p3 head.
---
Completely toxic: "d-strike" lol.
---
Definitely doing gens like Jake.  Your team mate has just given you a window of opportunity to finish them gens as much as possible.  Depending on how good/bad he or she is, you maybe able to pop one hopefully and maybe if others do it as well, we'll have at least 2 gens done.
---
Just out of pure curiosity, what rank are you on killer and survivor?
---
&gt; How does having a totem counter in anyway make finding totems easier?
---
I'm not sure how this is hard for you - they know what areas they checked and how many totems are left. If there's 1 totem in their counter, they can easily zero in on where the totem could be on the map.
---
&gt; And all this is still true with a totem counter, a totem counter doesnt make cleansing totems any faster.
---
I don't see the relevance. That paragraph had nothing to do with my issues with a totem counter. I was specifically replying to the idea that cleansing totems is some massive time sink
---
&gt; Adding a totem counter literally just makes solo more level with swf
---
Okay. I'm going to be very clear here:
---
*I do not want to hear jack shit about balancing solo with SWF until something about balancing SWF and killer is done*
---
&gt; It somewhat nerfs noed but not really and frankly i wouldnt mind that shitty perk being nerfed 
---
NOED is not a strong perk. As I explained elsewhere, you have to build around it with other end game perks to make it viable or rely on survivors just sort of deciding they don't care about escaping 
---
&gt;I‚Äôm talking specifically about when one survivor purposefully blocks another survivor‚Äôs escape route or blocks their loop, helping the killer down them. Or a survivor coming up behind another survivor and blocking them into a corner (like when working on a gen). 
---
A survivor blocking you in a corner for 5 minutes would be bannable, as would a survivor working with a killer to down you but really it would take a lot of clear evidence to be banned for that, a survivor sandbagging you wouldnt get them banned
---
I'll be honest; I look forward to the event, but I'm worried about how much of a grind it might be. A lot of these events do bring a lot of cooperation between killers and survivors, but this event seems like they've deliberately made it so both killers and survivors can't both come out winning, in terms of event resources.
---
you can escape hatch in dying state when its open..why should I think of open it when in dying state..wtf is up with u..fckn salty
---
I‚Äôm still trying to forget 
---
So long, farewell 
---
Barbecue and Chilli. It's a unique Leatherface perk where everytime you hook someone, you see the auras of every survivor that is 40 meters or more from the hook (unless that survivor is in a locker or running distortion). It also is a huge bloodpoint generator, which is a bit of bonus for the perk. 
---
It's one of the best killer perks (if not the best killer perk) in the game, and it should be a staple for most of your killer builds. 
---
For a Scooby snack?
---
Standing in front of the killer for 3 seconds earn a token (up to a max of 3/4/5) at the end of the match earn 1500 blood points for every token.
---
Being a jake main
---
IRL concept idea : get laid 
---
If a Survivor is repetadly "sandbagging" you then it counts as griefing,however make sure to include as much proof as possible
---
Thanks!
---
You must be new around here.
---
LMAOOO thats from eromanga sensei right? That's exactly how i imagined it
---
We Tapp mains do totems no matter what, even if we are being chased 
---
When you bring the treasure Hunter build + salty lips and everyone fucking open boxes 
---
Am I a joke 2 you
---
Kinda 
---
Spot on imo
---
This is true - if on the rare occasion NOED was in the game, but it didn't get a chance to activate, I know there is a Tapp out there in the fog tonight who saved my life.
---
Same. It's pretty crazy. I have the most fun when I play swf but since it takes ages to find games I haven't even been playing dbd as much.
---
Anyone have any good Freddy tips, builds, etc?
---
They WERE playing the game, by preventing you from hooking them. Survivors are not required to put themselves on hooks- their job is to survive, by any means included in the game necessary. The killers job is to kill them, again, by any in game means necessary.
---
As you stated, all you had to do was let them bleed out. It‚Äôs like camping- it‚Äôs scummy, and it‚Äôs not the best strategy, but it‚Äôs a part of the game.
---
Scratched mirror is best mirror IMHO.
---
I know this a shit post but too be fair, if anyone hasn‚Äôt seen it yet. Theres a change.org for Shaggy Rodgers in Mortal Kombat 11, and from what is sounds like.

---
You notice a minor difference with two people on a gen.
---
But with 3-4 People you really notice how quickly a gen is done
---
I'd recommend getting Bubba when you can. He's a fun and easy killer to pick up, and his teachables are great. Knockout is particularly good with Amanda, and BBQ is a pretty obvious choice too. Otherwise without those two perks; Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's Calling, and your choice for the fourth (perhaps Brutal Strength or Enduring). If you get any other dlc, Clown and Spirit are solid choices, and despite what people say about Legion they're good too
---
Just as fast as it was last patch with no generator speed related perks or toolboxes.
---
&gt;they know what areas they checked and how many totems are left. If there's 1 totem in their counter, they can easily zero in on where the totem could be on the map
---
How? Like seriously how? You know there is one totem left how does that make finding the last one any easier? If you cleansed the other 4 yourself sure you can zone where the last one will be but not just from a counter. 
---
&gt;I do not want to hear jack shit about balancing solo with SWF until something about balancing SWF and killer is done
---
And how are they supposed  to balance killer to swf without gimping solo survivor even more, theyve nerfed survivors plenty trying to even solo to swf makes balancing easier overall
---
&gt;NOED is not a strong perk. As I explained elsewhere, you have to build around it with other end game perks to make it viable or rely on survivors just sort of deciding they don't care about escaping 
---
I didnt say it was strong I said it was shitty, which it is. It rewards shit killers with a free kill most of the time, id prefer they delete the damn thing honestly and save this debate about cleansing dull totems.

That‚Äôs the point he was making

I did stumble upon one counterplay. If you‚Äôre on PC. you hit the escape button and then click quit game
---
Wait did this guy just get body blocked so hard he quit the game?
---
My first thought when I read 'smashable' was 'is this a smash bros roster?'
---
The Master of Disguise. A movie. It's... eh.
---
Is this a joke?  Shaggy would totally be a killer
---
Shaggy isn‚Äôt that weak, be serious.
---
And you're wrong.
---
Kate is thicc.  You're confusing "thicc" for "fat."
---
To add context. 
---
Last night I managed to wiggle free and run towards the warehouse. A survivor was in my path (a closed in area) and instead of moving or jumping through the hole in the wall (there was plenty of time for us both to get through), he just squat right there and waited for me to get downed. Then ran off. 
---
I had tried to turn and run when I realized he wasn‚Äôt going to move, but the killer had caught up by then. 
---
Yea... bc he did not see the person body blocking.
---
*killer
---
Thankfully they do look at the evidence and not just number of reports otherwise holy shit so many people would be banned just cause they were good at the game.
---
Yeah, it definitely plays like lag. But with the Killer as host that just seems weird.
---
Don't be afraid to abandon a chase as Freddy.
---
In many cases you can just leave a survivor in the dream state and go after someone else. I've often left a survivor, chased and hooked an easier target, and come back to find the 1st survivor still tickling away at a generator trying to get a skillcheck. All this is of course highly reliant on RNG (and your addons).
---
Sometimes you can also use this strategy (preferably with M&amp;A) to help catch a survivor. Sleep the survivor, abandon the chase, watch them from afar with your aura reading, and then come after them when they're in a more vulnerable position.
---
i will fight you
---
So you going to link the change.org page or not?
---
Also they could easily add a Killer with him.
---
I assume you earned them all from that one trial?
---
But ace? 
---
Add petition. Good idea where's equality? 
---
Thanks for all the fish?!?
---
Lol no
---
Wait theres an event ? o.o
---
Eh, you shouldn't have been banned for it, but it's pretty unhelpful.
---
Was this the bug where i had trouble healing my teammates? 
---
sometimes to try and be funny, because people will start walking away before realising they‚Äôre still injured and sprinting back and i guess people find it amusing?
---
sometimes just accidentally. it‚Äôs happened to me a couple times where i‚Äôve been healing someone and let go of the button a millisecond too early, and i think they‚Äôre healed, but they‚Äôre actually not so i gotta tap them again.
---
Nope there‚Äôs a bug on ps4 currently that stops you while healing multiple times, very very frustrating and costs so much time
---
Billy saw should go back to nothing instead of being able to feather it right at the go point and still move fast as fuck.
---
Exactly! Thank you! Some of us are just trying to survive! It's frustrating that some people automatically assume you're an asshole because of a character you're playing. I'm trash in a chase. I try! But I'm usually downed pretty quickly. So playing a bit more stealthy is my only strategy right now. 
---
I have no problem with Billy
---
You are really making yourself look stupid right now. As I said a bazillion times before this guy is 100% cheating. Is any of those things you said hard evidence that could be used to PROVE he did it? No. Its not hard evidence, maybe if he does the math on the offerings with game time (which maybe just maybe behaviour tracks), with number of games played or whatever. With how much information WE have its not really possible to prove he did cheat. Is it obvious that he cheated? Yes.
---
Also I never said anything about he being legit, I never defended the guy and you are really dumb. You're trying to create an argument (cause you lost a previous one) about something that has nothing to do with what I said. Its stupid, its silly and makes you look stupid. Just stop and grow up.
---
We Nea‚Äôs do more than point at the killer, we also don‚Äôt run away too much so that the killer will stay on us. Also the noed bit made me laugh, it‚Äôs just too accurate. 
---
You're still not paying attention. A body block stops the hook prompt from appearing. It *does not* remove control of the character after pushing to hook. A body block does not cause you to slide several feet left and right unable to do anything for several seconds before finally resetting you directly in front of the hook again.
---
&gt; You know there is one totem left how does that make finding the last one any easier? If you cleansed the other 4 yourself sure you can zone where the last one will be but not just from a counter. 
---
Like, from a solo perspective, even if other people also cleanse totems you can find the remains and easily figure it out.
---
I feel like you get it but also don't, so I'm not sure how to better explain it, which I guess is my fault. 
---
&gt; And how are they supposed to balance killer to swf without gimping solo survivor even more
---
SWF cannot be balanced. The devs were fools for building the player base around a fundamentally broken system. It's the realty we live in. 
---
My points are:
---
1) Solo does not need a buff. It's perfectly viable.
---
2) It's bizarre that people think solo needs a buff because of SWF but that killer does not, despite killer being the one in actual conflict on a game mechanics basis
---
3) If anything, solo gets a secondhand buff from SWF 
---
&gt; theyve nerfed survivors plenty
---
Survivors are not facing this wave of nerfs you guys think they are. Well, I guess if you want to be ~technically correct~ they are, but it's not just making survivors weaker; it's actually balancing the game. For instance, I see a lot of survivor mains cite the changes in vaulting as a nerf (how there is now a slow, medium, and fast vault) but that was a change that actually balanced game play. 
---
Consider the L-T Wall formation.
---
Each wall formation has a window on it, situated diagonally from the other window
---
Before the change and you could **always** fast vault, it did not matter which way the killer chased you. You could always loop in a way that gave you a fast vault at both windows.
---
Now, with the change, pathways and mind games come into play. It's actually possible for the killer to force you into using a path that removes the fast vault.
---
Technically a nerf, but for very valid balance reasons. 
---
&gt; I didnt say it was strong I said it was shitty, which it is. It rewards shit killers with a free kill most of the time, id prefer they delete the damn thing honestly and save this debate about cleansing dull totems. 
---
Fair enough. It's not a very good perk so no skin off my nose if it's removed. But survivors have Adrenaline and DS which offer freebies in a similar way
---
Yuck @ your taste, thinking that gremlin is actually dating material. 
---
As for me, if I load in and one of the survivors I see is that four eyes, I'll prepare the whole welcoming pack: ruin, NoED, mori, Blood Warden, etc. 
---
I knew someone with marphans
---
Agreed but Behavior doesn‚Äôt answer to a publisher. They bought themselves out of the contract with Starbreeze
---
Frank is 19. I have no idea about the others, though. The lore made it sound like the other three were underage but then I saw a post on here that DBD made all the killers "universal adults" (whatever that means), idk.
---
yes sir! made it last night
---
There's nothing wrong with Billy.
---
do you give a shit?
---
Billy is fine. He is high tier but not top tier.
---
If you nerf him why not nerf Nurse, Spirit or Huntress?
---
(Which can be arguably as good or better than Hillbilly)
---
I find Billy the most fun killer to play against. Honestly I wouldn't change anything about him... Except maybe rework speed limiter so that it also reduces the cooldown considerably.
---
as far as i‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs just the new system for gaining shards. you get more shards per player level the higher your devotion is, meaning you can get more cosmetics or perks from the shrine faster than on the previous devotion level.
---
i don‚Äôt think it offers anything else except bragging rights if you play enough to get a high devotion level.
---
I dont really like playing with headphones.
---
How am I supposed to know when the killer comes so I get off that gen ?
---
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
---
  
---
But killers can't hear survivors after the ear destruction either.  Perma iron will for all!
---
Totem breaking shouldn't be vacant :(  I run small game all the time and break all 5 totems every match, unless the killer has somehow shown what all 4 perks are.
---
It allows you to keep earning shards, not much else except street creds 
---
Kate is also a sticc
---
Look, I know he hurt you but you gotta let it go. He's just a pizza delivery man. There are plenty of other survivors in the fog, you'll find one that makes you happy eventually. 
---
I don't have any problem with it, but like Trapper's old hook bug where the trapped Survivor notification would spaz out across the screen or Clown's jiggly tummy they'll probably fix it soon anyway.
---
I definitely vote for Legion (in the case they're all legal) only because
---
1. Frank's my type (looks-wise)
---
2. David is definitely not my type, especially not when he's shirtless
---
As freddy i prefer not to go in there.. my poor eyes.. 
---
Then you don‚Äôt have enough practice body blocking, if the killer begins the animation to hook as someone starts to body block the killer will not be able to finish the hook, they will slide around until they either notice the person body blocking or the person wiggles out.
---
he wide
---
They probably wanted to use their DS just to be toxic instead of just leaving while they had the chance. You know, the usual.
---
Psst... Laurie strode...
---
Survivor?? You should make him a killer tbh lol. The entity could probably tap into at least 12.67% of his power. 
---
Probably just an easy one yo fix
---
i play on pici
---
Oh I'm letting go alright. Letting go my well-saved mori on him. 
---
Nah the dead zone glitch
---
Balanced. As all things should be.
---
Hottest female survivor* ace is definitely the hottest survivor of all times.
---
This literal exact same image is posted once every two weeks with a different caption relating to The Spirit.
---
It's not funny. It stopped being funny 3 months ago.
---
As pig I tend to hook as much as possible regardless of whether or not it‚Äôs tunneling and get everyone I can to 2 hooks. If I have the opportunity to kill someone due to them making a mistake or if I‚Äôm being gen rushed, I‚Äôll gladly take the 3rd hook for the kills. I generally don‚Äôt put on the traps until they‚Äôve like 2 gens left to do. It helps a lot with wasting their time having to find the key for the trap so it gives you ez game time to get kills. Also if they do end up popping all gens, they‚Äôve gotta get rid of the trap on their head before they can leave. 
---
I did this last night with The Pig and it was amazingly satisfying. I wish I'd gotten a recording of it.
---
I had Rancor on her and my obsession that match was being an ass the entire match, I was done with his crap. End of match the gates are open and he's standing at the exit gate flipping his fashlight off and on, teabagging, etc. I was able to walk up, stab him with the Rancor active to down him and murder him while his head was sticking out of the exit.
---
I think I remember not being able to fast vault through a window in Blood Lodge as well. 
---
I cannot hear the spirit anymore when she is in her power. that wanted?
---
I'm the one breaking totems to counter NOED and then realizing everyone else is on a hook and we have 4 gens left.
---
Hello, spirit main here. You are correct about the high skill ceiling, it's way up there compared to most other killers. But a high skill ceiling doesn't mean that it's hard to pick her up. I played many games with her when I first started using her and she had no perks or add-ons, and it was easy 4ks all around.
---
Sure, there are some survivors that know how to counter spirit, and there are some legitamite counters. But especially if you run strider and predator, it's very difficult for survivors to counter you as long as you can predict where they go, it's extremely simple from there. I'm surprised as to why there aren't that many spirits with how easy she is to play and kill with. 
---
She is also the most mind-gamey killer with all the ways she can fake and go around shit. Overall, it's easy to get 4ks with her and she is now where near as hard as the community thinks
---
There was a clip a couple weeks ago of a Leatherface who downed two Survivors on the last gen and after hitting them both with the chainsaw they instantly got up and ran away with Adred.
---
I will literally stop complaining about EVERYTHING if they add Shirtless Myers
---
For some dumb reason hook sabo progress doesn't reset when the Survivor stops working on it. So they took the hooks to about 99% and then waited to break them as you neared. It's the Survivor equivalent of hook camping.
---
Did they remove the huntress humming/singing in game cause i'm playing right now and i cant hear it 
---
lol Laurie is probably the least attractive other than quentin
---
read what he wrote just fine. Pressed space, doesnt hook and wobbles back and forth( which is from the survivor struggling)...the classic hook body block move.  Clearly you dont know what he talking about
---
Dead by Daylight is a flawless masterpiece without any kind of flaws whatsoever
---
She told me she was forty three!
---
If you‚Äôre really close it‚Äôs sometimes better to go for the unhooked and down them and then switch focus and go for the unhooker.
---
Commenting cause I'm curious to
---
i recently / 3 months ago invested in Lisa, but somehow never started to play her - tbh i think mostly out of fear to spend the first 20 matches figuring out how / when / where to set the traps and how exactly to teleport; how am I able to differentiate between a skillcheck fail, a pebble and a set-off trap? is it a different sort of notification or is it intuitive and has to be learned with time? I'd be Bercy thankful for any pre-first-game tips &amp; advice on the hag, because I'm very intruiged by her playstyle. 
---
If you have to mend you must not have hid well enough. It seems like most high rank survivors are used to just running loud and looping they‚Äôve forgotten how to sneak. 
---
If you get spotted, break LoS during frenzy, frenzy makes it tough to see and you won‚Äôt leave scratches
---
I don't mean to be as much of a dick as the person you're responding to, but something about Nea's face just looks off to me. I can't put my finger on it, but it's just like... weird.
---
"This is gonna be BAD"
---
A survivor's dying pleas spur you into action. You are the obsession. Once per trial, when a killer is holding a survivor, press the active ability button to launch a charge attack and cause the killer to drop the survivor. However, your aura is visible by the killer until the next time you get downed.
---
Bullshit. I've had this happen with **literally** the last Survivor in the game. Who the fuck, exactly, is body blocking when there's no one else fucking left? You're an idiot, just admit you were wrong and move on, JFC.
---
Brave soul
---
Doing Gens; you?
---
I think legion is a good character 
---
If you suddenly vanish then the killer is gonna search the area, idiot
---
I respect your opinion.
---
So even though I think you're dead wrong take an upvote.
---
It's not easy at all to pull off 
---
One of my favorite games was against a team saboing hooks. Cheeky buggers did well at it
---
I would love the ghost of captain Cutler or spooky space kook
---
Look up on YouTube probably
---
&gt;Like, from a solo perspective, even if other people also cleanse totems you can find the remains and easily figure it out.
---
This still doesnt answer anything, you can do this now with no totem counter a totem counter wouldnt effect this it all?????
---
 &gt;Solo does not need a buff. It's perfectly viable.
---
Honestly I think it does, Randoms have a rough time right now honestly, you have one shit teamate out of 4 and you arent powering the gates. Not huge buffs but the games starting to get balanced aorund 4 pro survivor teams and thats dumb. I think some killers are still on the weak side too mind you, however we arent talking about that we are talking about adding a counter for the number of totems remaining hardly a huge buff.
---
Yes survivors have been nerfed for balance thats true but over time they are nerfing everything about survivor but leaving a lot of bulllshit on the killer side. Nurse, ebony moris , instasw billy, iredecent head huntress, Prayer beads spirit, mint rag rusty shackles hag. I dont need perfect balance and dont expect it, this game is way too hard to balance but seriously a totem counter isnt a crazy buff.
---
(Im not going to argue with you about anything but the totem counter thats the only suggestion thats here, every single balance change needs its own argument)
---
Why don't you tell the Dwight that? What purpose does this post serve?
---
Both kate and the spirit aren‚Äôt thicc. y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know the definition of that word anymore, do y‚Äôall?
---
I honestly don't see how this is relevant ? You think I'm mad because you said that Claudette players were bad ? lmao  
---
I'll say to you what I said to the other guy, who's body blocking when there's no one else left? Because this happens even with no other Survivors still in the game. Clearly ***you*** don't know what he's talking about.
---
More like he got the killer on you.
---
I went to hobby lobby and got plaster strips for about 4 bucks, went to the dollar store and bought a generic mask, cut out the nose of said mask, and layered the plaster strips over it. including paints it was roughly 9-15$ depending on what you want exactly.

thank you for the informative and helpful response i will use this information wisely
---
This literally never happens from a body block. There's a massively obvious difference from a blocked hook and this bug.
---
This
---
no where does he say in his OP that no one is left in the game LMAO
---
Shirtless Myers would make this the automatic GOTY, no matter what year it is.
---
Well Jake is my main now and only P3 I've got so far, so guess I'ma chad :D
---
Well then I suppose I stand corrected. 
---
I never had any problem fighting Nurse as she loses sight frequently when overusing tp, Spirit doesn't see you during the phase at all and Huntress can be easily countered by running around high terrain to hide behind. With Billy you could use the terrain to your advantage, but he's true pain in the arse when your team doesn't, because his camp is one shot.
---
Nah, curves comes from your body structure, not from the pounds you put on over it. 
---
Have you ever tried Joey's Mixtape and Cold Dirt?
---
You Frenzy hit, close the distance, then end Frenzy and regular hit. With the recovery speed you can get a hit in before they can escape, and most of the time you can bodyblock any pallets or windows.
---
There's no real counterplay besides the occasions you can't bodyblock pallets or vaulting, so throw on Bamboozle and Brutal Strength/Spirit Fury and you'll end chases nearly as fast as the Nurse, especially in the late game when all the pallets are gone.
---
From my experience:
---
**Dwight** - In a locker sniffing his own farts.
---
**Meg** - Cleansing totems, but maybe it's because I have a totem whore friend who only plays Meg. Other than that they're usually pointing at the Killer.
---
**Claudette** - Doing gens; you? But yeah hit the nail on the head they're probably going to miss their flashlight again.
---
**Jake** - Crouch walking across the map at a snail's pace. Might be doing a gen or totems.
---
**Nea** - Pointing at you.
---
**Bill** - Humping gens or taking agro.
---
**David** - Taking agro or pointing at you.
---
**Jeff** - Doing gens, but might magically appear out of thin air to take a hit for you before leaving.
---
**Laurie** - About to miss their 5th Flashlight blind
---
**Ace** - Doing totems or chests. Might just be sniffing his own farts in a locker.
---
**Feng** - Might be doing a gen, probably preparing to miss a blind, knowing my luck they're doing fuck all.
---
**Quentin** - If he hasn't got his Green Medkit yet that's what he's doing. If he has it he's doing gens at lightning speeds.
---
**Tapp** - If they have the police vest they're taking hits (and even getting downed) for you. If they have the casual jacket you haven't seen them since character select and have done 4 and a half gens by themselves.
---
**Kate** - Sniffing her own farts in a locker. Possibly doing totems.
---
**Adam** - Interacting with something, be it a chest, totem, or gen.
---
Not really, i honestly don't care. I just wanted to see how many people could get triggered by that one comment. However, i will stand by what i said about this community being greatly disturbing.

&gt; This still doesnt answer anything, you can do this now with no totem counter a totem counter wouldnt effect this it all?????
---
Dear god it's like you're trying to not get it. You are forcing this scenario where it's only one solo person cleansing. Having to find the remains on your own is much different that having a counter do it for you 
---
&gt; Randoms have a rough time right now honestly
---
No we don't
---
&gt; ou have one shit teamate out of 4 and you arent powering the gates.
---
Absurd. If one bad teammate screws you all the time, maybe you need to consider that you're just not that great
---
&gt; Nurse, ebony moris , instasw billy, iredecent head huntress, Prayer beads spirit, mint rag rusty shackles hag.
---
oh dear god you're one of those
---
well this explains a lot
---
What about the ones who search from the first gen they start for Ruin? Thats me...then my team is dead.
---
They go clickty clack and make it easier to tracc. Also Slow Release Toxin.
---
okay......well done! 
---
Man I don‚Äôt wanna be that guy but spirit and huntress are totally fine. They‚Äôre like the only two balanced killers. Nurse just goes overboard where it‚Äôs solely up to her how the game goes and the other killers that arent those three (even billy) are dependent upon the survivors. Spirit and huntress are the two killers where each player has equal input and it‚Äôs up to who can play their role better on an equal scale of skill and choice. 
---
Thats a pretty terrible argument, saboing a hook beforehand takes time and then you have to be nearby to sabo it in front of the killer and then half the time the killer can get to another hook anyway. Its a  prementive and skillfull play by the survivor to deny a hook, camping a hook as killer is just throwing the game to make sure one guy dies. Takes zero skill whatsoever 
---
Let me preface this by saying I don‚Äôt play pig, but this has happened to me before playing against pigs and I think it‚Äôs a strategy a lot of them run. I‚Äôve noticed sometimes when I get trapped a pig will circle and check all the jigsaw boxes, and they‚Äôre looking for those they‚Äôve trapped as easy targets to pick off. After all, you‚Äôre going to be running to those to get the traps off as soon as you can. Sometimes they‚Äôll come up and interrupt you on one, which is the best case scenario for them. The first few times I played against pig as a new player I didn‚Äôt know how long the trap was going to take before going off, so I was in a panic to get the trap off and was running to all the boxes not bothering to stealth and purposefully would ignore the pig getting closer to me because I was desperately trying to solve the puzzle box to unlock the trap. So for some players the trap is probably a great way to catch them out and make them an easy kill, which I was those initial times I was trapped. If anything I think the trap is less of a killing tool, and more of a distraction tool. If they‚Äôre preventing you from doing gens, then it‚Äôs working, and if they get a kill on you then the trap wasn‚Äôt wasted.
---
JFC, you have shitty reading comprehension. I never said it did. I said that what he described happens even in that scenario, so it's not a body block. How are you able to use Reddit when you're this fucking stupid?
---
And Haddonfield.
---
Removed for party thread please post /r/dbdLFG
---
whats with all the toxic nea cunts? you lot really ruin the game. Go back to watching noob3.
---
Pips are used in the ranking system. Each rank you need a certain amount of pips before you rank up. You can get up to two pips per game, depending on how well you did.
---
Tokens and stacks are just terms used by perks like BBQ and Chili, We're Gonna Live Forever, Save the Best for Last etc. You get a stack/token for doing certain things and you get certain bonuses per stack/token.
---
&gt;I think you're too stuck up on the idea of defending d-strike, because you use it more than any other perk. A toxic person will ALWAYS use d-strike, but a d-strike isn't always toxic. These guys are however using it exclusively to BE toxic. I threw it in there, because it's part of the entire picture. If he hadn't run d-strike, he would have been less toxic than the exact same premise where someone DOES use d-strike, simply on the account of how much damage it can do to a game(And even more so before all the killer buffs)
---
Lol probs not
---
But what if I have Prayer beads?
---
Only if he had Battle Mullet hairstyle with it. Then I wouldn't be able to resist.
---
I'm not the only one good lmao
---
I have a love hate relationship with bond, sometimes it makes me give up on humanity other times it's fantastic
---
Any other killer can down more effectively, and there is nothing that forces survivor actions quite like hooking someone(Simply because that forces a timer. Nothing else does). If your only means to be more effective than other killers is to turn the game into a snoozefest, then you're a terribly designed killer, and in an actual chase, the worst of them all
---
K, because on ps4 it happens like almost every time :D thx
---
Geez, let me try to reupload
---
You keep making yourself look stupid over and over, you actually enjoy this don't you? You responded to me saying it was not possible to get P3. I proved you that he could. You said he couldn't get BP for those addons, I proved you he could since the leveling system is new. Stop trying to make new arguments like a kid that can't accept the fact that you were wrong.
---
pips: [okay so this is an old image, but it gets the point across](https://images.mein-mmo.de/magazin/medien/2017/07/Dead-by-Daylight-Killer-Goals.jpg)
---
See those little notches in the red progress bar? The two white ones are pips. The black one is a safety pip. White pips add to your progress to ranking up. The safety pip means that nothing happens to your rank.
---
See those 5 little circles underneath the killer rank in the top right? That's how many pips you need to rank up.
---
Tokens: the little numbers on perk icons in game. Distortion has 3 tokens, so the number 3 appears on perk icon
---
stacks: the little numbers on perk icons in game. BBQ &amp; Chili get stacks. 
---
You can lose tokens. you cannot lose stacks 
---
I.... \*cackling\*
---
Fine.  Take your upvote!
---
Yeah. And you can easily tell who has never actually played Killer/experienced this before. Anyone who's been blocked and who's had this bug can easily recognize the difference. They act nothing like each other.
---
I dont really know, i think Myers and Billy are similar too
---
_comment score below threshold_
---
Anyway on a related note, I played against a Legion who had Remember Me and it was absolutely disgusting. Doesn't help that the two of use alive were to uncoordinated to counter it.
---
Both survivors still get the additional blood points, it just stays at 10% repair speed bonus instead of 20%.
---
He is 100% troll
---
Backstory: I completed 3 out of the 4 gens that were done by myself, except for about 30/45 seconds of this guy helping. Made saves when I could, and healed the David up on several occasions. I literally set the gens up so we had them as spread out as possible. I don‚Äôt usually hide in lockers but we just finished a gen and the killer came to us. I got smacked and took off so Killer went looking for the other guy, so I went to hide until he went far enough for me to safely heal. Then this happened.
---
I think thats because the other survivor is trying to move and cancels your action
---
Is this game pretty active on Xbox One?
---
No fix to Haddonfield intro blowing out headphones yet? Yikes. 
---
I dont know, i think Billy and Myers have the same one
---
I have it a lot without a DC. Sometimes if I drop them and then try again it works. And sometimes it corrects mid slide when I'm 6 feet left of the hook and I hang them on the air.
---
How is this

Okay slow down there partner. Hillbilly is no where near as dull and brain dead as spirit or legion, no offense to people that like these characters, but they don‚Äôt require and mechanical skill. Spirit is just faking the phase walk at the pallet, and if they don‚Äôt fall for it, actually phase walk, easy hit. Legion is just stalking the survivor and smacking them until they go down, not caring about pallets or windows. To play billy well against competent survivors means immense map knowledge and game sense, as well as mechanical skill of targeting the saw, and a little bid of mind games in predicting where the survivors will go. You can play billy like the trapper and just go and m1 people, just using the saw to patrol gens, but that would just make you the dull one, not the character.
---
It can be both, I think. But in this case there's no curves really from structure or fat.

Nea is Bae. Keep her on top.

A Chad is someone who is an absolute unit, the opposite of a virgin - the alpha, the omega, the darkside of the moon, what we wish to be.

The Stiff Wig the devs gave her?

Yes, one starting on the 30th.
---
Actually Ive experienced a bug where I need to restart my game after getting auric cells due to it thinking I have no cosmetics after doing so. this game is broken in every way, even the monetized areas.
---
Oohhh, what does it consist of ?
---
I'm a clown main with prestige 1, and I have to say he is really fun and the perks Bamboozle and Jack in the box is really good to run. So clown would be good.
---
what about those two perks?
---
Your curves comes from your shape which comes down to what type of structure you have.  The ideal figure for a woman is the hourglass, that's something you simply have or you don't.  Thicc these days is often being confused for having the shape of a sponge.  
---
Freddy‚Äôs will be Freddy‚Äôs.

I want to tolerate your opinion but Legion, Bubba, Mikey, Wraith, and Huntress are all top tier smash meat.

At least we agree Trapper is underappreciated.

&gt;Preplanning a move and carrying it out at the right time

You just described Insidious Basementface. So I guess camping is skillfull, now?
---
were you in the basement...?
---
Just get 4 shirtless Davids to beat up Hillbilly and take his chainsaw to cut a tree down 
---
If I buy a dlc, level up a character to get a teachable, and then refund it through steam, will I keep the teachable or will be locked again until I re-obtain the character?
---
fucking redditors
---
Hell yeah then I can toe stab all the survivors!
---
I mean it's definitely one of the most skillful strategies in the game. It takes a lot of time and you have to keep track of every single hook's sabo progress and keep track of respawns and always have someone nearby to finish the sabo while also beating the killer to the next hook. 
---
Then you can just get slugged so you have to account for that and account for how slow your gen progress will be. It's a lot of set up and a lot of coordination to do well. Not a single other strategy requires so much from the survivors. Is it easy to you? Maybe, but it's still probably the hardest thing to pull off as a survivor.
---
Really still using this meme format.... poor attempt

I'd argue 'thicc' is closer to pear shape but that might just be a matter of opinion. Usually when I think of thicc I have ass focus versus chest focus.
---
I mean, fat layers differently on different people. Someone doesn't have to be really fat (or 'sponge shaped') to be thicc. Just some luck in it laying on the ass the thighs can do it.
---
The females all use the same models for survivors for the most part. And Kate just doesn't have the waist to be hourglass, I feel. So no tiny waist making an hourglass but ALSO no fat helping to offset the not tiny waist just leaves her looking boxy.
---
&gt;I never had any problem fighting Nurse as she loses sight frequently when overusing tp,
---
You don't play against good Nurse's, then. 
---
How far would ~600k bloodpoints get me when leveling from level 1? I want to know if it'd be worth prestiging Billy with the points I have right now
---
I know they aren't no! But all of those I listed I would smash if it was the last thing I'd do!
---
I'm curious. What makes all of thise 'might's a 'might'? What's your logic?
---
That's true, I'm more of a newbie and I think people of all ranks can have opinions because game shouldn't be optimized only for rank 1. I don't have issue with Legion or Nurse (I did recommendation for Legion because my friends from higher rank complain), but I suffer with Billy.
---
man, i had a "4 Billy Chainsaw Hits" a couple of days ago. Took me six games to get.
---
I lost all my faith on gitting gud at the game, but at least being killer is still fun
---
&gt;Shock Therapy
---
&gt;Repair the generator on the second floor of the Disturbed Ward and live to tell the story.
---
achievement on PC (Steam) still doesn't trigger.
---
Did the generator alone and went out of gates, no achievement.
---
Did it with another player and went out of gates. no achievement.
---
I main meg and this is very true. Generally I go down after drawing aggro faster than if I just let the killer keep chasing the other guy lol
---
On an exhaustion timer or once per game.
---
don't think i ever encounters tapps and davids who are able to loop for more than a second but a'ight
---
Nah, it broke with a previous patch
---
Stop getting antsy over people wanting to fuck a fake ghost.
---
In pigs case it may come to handy not to level up whispers to lvl3 so you have a little more time and stealth to go into crouch. 
---
There is actually another post down below talking about this and it turns out that PS4 has a bug right now that causes the healing to stop. So that could be it. 
---
Looks like that place got bleached to hell
---
Those pigeons were actually in month's patch too. I got an upclose pic
---
You say to take extra time, which is essentially what's happening. From what we know, BHVR is currently at some step of a plan to basically rewrite the code of the game from the ground up. That's an extraordinary undertaking aimed at improving many aspects of the game's code itself. 
---
Awww poor boy mad because someone calling him out on his fetish. Ya'll sad. 
---
I saw an ace point at the chest I was looting, so I let it close so he could take it. He got a (presumably) good toolbox. Not ten seconds after that, however, The Pig came over and started chasing me. If only closing chests didn't create loud noise notifications, then maybe more people would offer chests to others.
---
Thats better lol. I think tokens would be best. 3 tokens to be specific
---
2 and 3 would be op
---
Hahaah oh boy. Also I love all those rank 20s that are clearly people who ranked down to bully killers, but they still got wrecked.
---
&gt; Who's waiting for The Moonrise Event?
---
Not really, none of the cosmetics i've seen so far (for the event) interest me and putting survivors vs killers even more with this community is not going to end well, i had enough toxicity during past events.
---
You have amazing taste. I am sorry that these children have downvoted you because all they care about is tits.
---
Gets hit through a window* "its ok they added shirtless myers" honestly me too.
---
Move Feng down to gens and you‚Äôve got me, survivors aren‚Äôt my problem, altruism always seems to get me killed

Pop goes the weasel?
---
I mean, you can absolutely miss it since the hitbox is inconsistent as fuck, but yeah that is the best way to down people.
---
Just cringed haaaaard at this meme.
---
Heh, I play Claudette but do the gens.
---
Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!
---
Legion, Wraith and Myers are total top tier (i am gay so males probably are slightly ahead), after that comes Huntress and probably Trapper
---
That really only fits Frank's personality though.
---
*THANK YOU*
---
And here i thought people said he was weaker than freddy
---
I'm a survivor main who just started playing killer, I chose the Spirit as well. I am going for Stridor(Nurse), Monitor &amp; Abuse(Doctor) and Ruin(Hag). Still unsure what I will put in the fourth slot. 
---
It depends what you prefer. Engaging gameplay or being able to carry a team of shitters. The first one can be had against Billy/Nurse. The second one can be accomplished against legion.
---
Freddy, incredibly powerful killer. Won‚Äôt regret it one bit.
---
In all seriousness, Myers is a good pick. He‚Äôs great to have fun with and scare the shit out of survivors.
---
This is why I play Freddy lol. The brightness is the only way I can play killer.
---
He doesn't eat it; he gets himself a little suckle and sticks it in his pocket for later. Yum!
---
Jake main, and yes, this is absolutely what I do in this scenario.
---
(okay, maybe I try to snag a little aggro to help a teammate)
---
So all good. 
---
The house feels bad for Fredward.
---
That, downed them close enough that they shortly crawled to it, but not enough to hop in before the wipe was over
---
Yeah I just call it that.
---
Doki Doki Literature Club
---
I think closing chests only gives a loud noise notification if you hold sprint and rush it - you can close chests slowly and it wont notify the killer.
---
Then we would get lobby dodges AND post-offering dodges.  I'll be honest, both options here are pretty terrible.
---
Theres 3 Claudettes in the photo.
---
I enjoy trying to balance every survivor and keep track of what all 4 survivors are doing at any time and trying to make optimal decisions based on that, and keeping everyone involved instead of just tunneling 1 person at a time while everyone else plays m1 simulator.  The strongest killers get to play that 1v1 over and over again style and just race the survivors betting they can get kills faster than the survivors can do gens without much strategy aside from optimizing the individual chases.  I think a killer with such a flexible and versatile power that allows them to have more control over what happens is very fun and rewarding, without quite being as unfun to play against as a sloppy butcher legion repeatedly giving everyone deep wounds but not actually commiting to many chases.
---
I agree. After I realized how many points you'll need, I decided that I'm only going to get the Feng cosmetic when I was hoping to grab all three.
---
Lol when it comes to Feng I am really biased - my friend plays he and he plays like an asshole.
---
Bring me my New Moon Bouqet!
---
 I call next

Get bond, self care, alert and borrowed time. Noob friendly build.
---
Just spin it in circles 
---
Whenever I try that I proceed to have my worst game ever as that killer and then they harass me more in the post game. 
---
Okay, we clearly don't see this the same way but that's cool. 
---
kate is more bae than solaire is my sun dad
---
Really?! I'm pretty sure that even when the survivor takes the time to close it, the sound of the chest closing still gives a notification. If this is true, then I'll pay attention to the t-bagging and pointing survivor more.
---
I seen in the control setting you can change other things like running and struggle phase with different buttons but how come you can‚Äôt change that 
---
I've played a little as the Hag and against her. Whilst I love playing as the good Doctor, I also enjoy playing as the Hag, I'm probably an average Hag player but I'll try and help as much as I can.
---
For traps if I'm running hex totems, then I'll stick one or two near them. After that I look for "choke points", places that'll stop loops before they begin like before a pallet, before a vault etc. All while looking for survivors and placing traps at random as I sometimes get lucky with one of them being triggered.
---
But also try and make sure the traps can't be seen if possible. Go for grass or other areas to hide them in. And once a survivor knows where a hex totem is, there is a chance they'll go back to it if you stop chasing them before they could cleanse it so make sure to check them semi regularly in case they do come back. As once they know they're facing a Hag, they'll probably crouch to ensure they don't set off traps.
---
But don't get disheartened if you don't do well at you're first few games as the Hag. Keep putting the time in and you will get better.
---
I mean other than the giant spider in the sky I don't think anything is stopping you
---
3 idiots watching a hatch standoff.
---
Rotate the stick. Doesn't even need to be that fast.
---
I feel like this post is personally attacking me...
---
- Run to pallet and camp it as soon as Legion gets close  
---
- Do anything necessary to get a guaranteed stun. Getting hit is fine. Just make sure he gets put out of Frenzy after a single hit.  
---
- Now you can easily stall against him for longer than against a good nurse  
---
- Afterwards do not waste time healing. Legion will not get kills fast enough since every survivor can stay in injured state just fine and gens can be done too fast for Legion to keep up who has to do a full chase (4 hits or ~40seconds moonwalk. Thats 1 and a half generators being done)  
---
- Escape against the garbage killer that is Legion  
---
Legion can be counterplayed. Him having no counterplay is a meme. However, he is no fun to play against. Which is true. Inb4 downvote cause logic doesn't count since the best counterplay to hated killers is to complain online hehexd
---
Haha which one are you?
---
I was just saying this to someone! People always talk like SWF is detrimental to solo players and I have no fucking idea where they get that idea. Solo very clearly gets a secondhand buff
---
I concede that I would no longer need balance updates with shirtless Myers.
---
There‚Äôs only be one viable killer anyways.
---
Aight let‚Äôs make this a new meme. I mean, come on, this is amazing.
---
Dwight ;-;
---
No idea
---
Theyd have to make a crafting table first
---
Awe well that‚Äôs just mean. 
---
Okay, that title couldn't be any better.
---
Damnn alright 
---
Slower than last patch unless everyone runs PTS.
---
Just learn what you need to do to pip. You need 3 silvers and 1 gold to pip, or the same with different tiers (each tier of a badge is 1 point and you need 9 points) 
---
For lightbringer: 1 full gen gives you silver. Cleansing totems gives you the same as 50% of a gen. Roughly 2 full gens gives you gold
---
Survival: 0-5 minutes gives you nothing, 5-9 gives you silver, escaping gives you gold, escaping without getting downed gives you red
---
Benevolent: more confusing, but basically you want to unhook 2 people for silver. If they go down within 10 seconds of getting unhooked you get penalized hard so make sure that doesn‚Äôt happen
---
Chaser: you basically just get points for being in their terror radius or being in a chase, the closer you are to the killer the more points you get
---
These should help: (im pretty sure they‚Äôre up to date, someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong)   https://i.imgur.com/ZeO64Ry.jpg https://i.imgur.com/gIkcfIO.jpg https://i.imgur.com/WteUhNt.jpg https://i.imgur.com/6IbmviB.jpg 
---
I've been in so many matches were a Dwight is just chasing the killer, who is chasing me. It's like he wants a good view on the action and just tries to watch.
---
"Just adding stuff." LMAO. He described an experience with a (rather common) bug, you claimed body blocking, I pointed out this happens when no possible blocker exists, you got salty about being proven wrong yet again. Wow.
---
Because meg &gt; feng
---
Weird way of typing feng min but i agree 
---
Umm
---
What about nurse 
---
Shirtless Dwight or I'll riot!
---
Now this, this is a list i can get behind (along with many other things)
---
I just think it‚Äôs funny, I don‚Äôt understand why people react like this. But yeah, if you came in with the mindset to bully the killer, then that‚Äôs how it goes
---
Though needs to be said that maybe you should use a word other than snitch because it's usually used in association with someone ratting you out, which implies you have done and know you have done, something wrong /worth snitching about. It hurts your argument because of the implied guilt of the word. Not saying you have, just saying what I think you can improve to maybe make your point more convincing for others. 
---
Oh I will! 
---
One of my complaints is that they have a plan for 3 killers per year(correct me if I‚Äôm wrong).Rather than prioritizing getting the game fixed.Ffs console has had bad frame rate issues for about 2 years.
---
All I Imagine now is a Dwight commentating behind the Killer as they chase me. 
---
Fix his hair. Give her shoes.
---
The doctor is a must if you're into punishment you can even do some for play before hand
---
How dare you
---
Fun? To play as? Yes.
---
Nurse has counterplay and takes skill to use effectively.
---
hmm distortion, lockers, changing directions after 4 seconds, and running close to the killer are all good ways to counter it but keep crying survivor main, your salty tears is what keeps the game fun.
---
ohhh
---
We already have a nip slip with Hag, Why not Kate?
---
Yeah, but the idea is that they're a group and not just one person. I guess there's an argument for saying he's the strongest personality.
---
Yup

Well the hatch was added by a survivorish person so it shouldould be possible.  But there are killers with chainsaws and axes out there, so I doubt it would be very safe.
---
Unfortunately, no.  This is one of the ways a survivor can fuck up your attempt. 
---
üò≠üò≠üò≠ WAAA IM TRASH AND GOT BODYBLOCKED WAAA üò≠üò≠üò≠

Oh! So that‚Äôs what hell looks like... Nice.
---
Completely unprovoked toxicity..smh
---
you only get the prompt to insta kill when they are in the healthy or injured state, youd have to have them wiggle out but then they would just jump in the locker again, its not really holding the game hostage its a strategy for tombstone Meyers 
---
The survivor was waiting to be picked up so they could hit the DS I think. 
---
 The Entity is the devs, pretty much.
---
Survivors are not "nerfed into the ground"
---
Okay but can we get an update about who won? I assume at this point you‚Äôd be as committed to watching it end as I would be
---
Satisfying
---
Shirtless Myers is a instant buy for me when I don‚Äôt even have those dlcs. 
---
Nope. Done SWF and know neither of us are moving and it still happens. Like I said it‚Äôs only since the 2.5 update. 
---
I've accidentally done this more than once, because I forget that someone went from phase 1&gt;2 on hook and I see that their downed health bar would be the same as if it was on second down. Also grabbing people and then downing them can mess me up, so I end up almost never using my traps.
---
Visual bug
---
I was gonna say tapp and ace's do all totems all the time
---
If you think it‚Äôs fair because you always get DCs you‚Äôre part of the problem. Just report the people who DC and move on
---
IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING JO JO REFERENCE?!
---
They need a new mechanic that prevents this... so boring... like maybe when last survivor is left, give them a secondary objective that when complete, opens up exit gates for them to escape? Vigo's Lanterns or something.
---
Hahahahaha 
---
Does anyone actually know someone who dc on console getting banned
---
He's the one pulling the strings, Susie looms like the most insane one, Joey is edge 9000 end Julie follows Frank 
---
When I play Nurse I just try get my 4 bbq stacks. That is a win for me as nurse as I suck with her! 
---
Who even uses that perk? No killer I have ever gone against.
---
&gt;&gt;who can easily 4K before a single gen is done.
---
uhh what? Are you guys spawning in front of the nurse or what?
---
a Chad apparently
---
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a knife‚Äù.
---
*Pulls out Spork*
---
‚ÄúTHIS is a knife‚Äù!
---
Was about to say I actually want to play Legion but I can't handle that much sodium in my diet.
---
I use Lithe and it allowed me to completely outrun a three blink Nurse, so no, it's not "a wasted perk slot" against her.
---
Oh no. He‚Äôs op. He‚Äôs like a super version of the pig. Because bear traps are only pressuring when someone pops a gen. But you have to mend yourself or you go down with deep cut. So if you just hit people in frenzy as many times as possible you stunt their progress worse than having thanatophobia and ruin on at the same time lol
---
I went from rank 11 to rank 12 though so it can‚Äôt be visual
---
How are they holding the game hostage when you can just pull them out the locker and hook them?
---
****Megalovania Intensifies****
---
I bring Adept Laurie's perks + Dead Hard whenever I use Laurie, and for some damn reason I'm almost always non-obsession, to some Level 1 Crook with DS. And more obsession perks are supposed to prioritize yourself. 80% of the time when I'm obsession, I see on the match screen that I was the only one with obsession perks.
---
This also happened to 2 of my friends. I can confirm there were no bugged DC's when it happened as i ran out the exit gates with them. They didn't even touch the last gen, the achievement is just bugged and being given out to random people... 
---
ez pip
---
I would love to tell you who won...  if some one had won yet. 
---
I've had this happen to me before and it corrects when I leave the end game screens 
---
How can Claudette hide behind a rock and cleanse totems at the same time?
---
Evil Incarnate is an achievement where you have to kill the survivors by hand.
---
hillbilly is my second most played killer, after huntress. Even though I am mostly a survivor player (250 ish hours on survivor), I still play billy and huntress a lot. I'm not completely sure what backreving is, but from what you are saying I assume it is feathering the m2 button to hold the chainsaw out (correct me if i'm wrong). If that is the case, I don't really see how that helps that much. If the survivor gets put into a position where the hillbilly is right behind them and has the time to rev their chainsaw, that is the survivor's misplay. Unless you get really cucked by the random map generator and get like rotten fields or something, it is usually your own fault. As a survivor you should usually be near a window vault or some walls or objects to run around if he tries to chainsaw right in front of you. The mobility is pretty strong, but as I said in my original comment, it takes a fair amount of skill to use it in an effective way and not just to patrol and become an m1 killer. Finally, what do you mean by skill to success ratio? Do you mean 4k, single pip, double pip...?
---
A survivor attempting that may attract some bad attention pretty quickly.
---
don't you know? every nurse is actually zubatlel and ardetha
---
Spirit is far from easy to play. She's luke Huntress. You have to be able to predict survivot movements.
---
Can someone please explain the meme of Shaggy being twelve zillion times more powerful than God on a bad day when he's exhausted half asleep and drunk more than a Scotsman? I'm out of the loop hete.
---
Thanks! I hate it!
---
Good to see such a wide variation of opinion on this matter, it really is one of the most disagreed upon topics. 
---
Love to see others opinions :D 
---
I do, any time I see 4 toolboxes. It's almost guaranteed to be a sabo happy team. Iron Grasp, Agitation, Mad Grit, Hangman's Trick. I've had sabo squads DC when the hook's respawned 10 seconds after their "skillfull" waste of time.
---
I know what their given personalities/roles are, yes.
---
He is shit. Now we realize that not only is he shit, but that with certain addons there is no counter play against him.
---
Heck yeah gen CHAD! Us Jeff mains always seem to try to do our best, I've never been let down by a brother.
---
why are you watching if you don't like her stream in the first place?
---
The fact that you even mention hourglass proves you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to that term.
---
What about the Claudette outside of the map
---
Perks only available to Shaggy. Zoinked: grants the killer the ability to mori a healthy, injured or hooked survivor.
---
Hunger Cravings: all survivors become the obsession. 
---
Man's best Friend: (activation) allows the killer to summon his best canine buddy. AI controlled killer enters the trial.
---
Killing someone on the hatch with Tombstone Myers is nearly sexually pleasurable
---
Legion Main here. They‚Äôre fun to play as. Balanced? Absolutely fucking not. 
---
There‚Äôs only one issue I have with this.
---
Freddy‚Äôs glove is on the wrong hand.
---
But despite that incredibly minor issue, it‚Äôs pretty good!
---
^
---
Nice.
---
Refund the offering of games that don‚Äôt happen.  Problem solved.
---
It absolutely happens on PC. I get it all the time.
---
Dude I never know. Some people do think he‚Äôs garbage
---
I know what the achievement is. I'm just saying they're not holding the game hostage by staying in a locker. Your achievement is not their problem. Technically you're holding the game hostage by not pulling them out
---
The communtiy for DBD is quite a special one. Half of the community are genuinely nice people and the other half are a huge snot wad of cunts. I hope your experience gets better cause that really sucks.
---
Come on, Detective, I believe in your ability to come up with something better than just repeating something like a child.
---
Or was that insult holding bit more truth than it seems? 
---
Because, let's be honest, who but a child would think posting [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/adhyn5/a_quiet_artist_vs_a_band_of_merciless_killers/) would be cool?
---
You got this, I believe in you, kinda.
---
Yup! There's a movie where shaggy turns into a werewolf and is put in a race championship against other real monsters like the mummy too
---
Nope, prove thyself only activates when another survivor is within 4 meters of you. And at that point both of the survivors might as well work on that gen together.
---
You said the Killer lagged out, so that's the issue. Your pips and points are only safe if they exit match. That's the only thing the game understands. Force quits and lag outs are confusing to it, it can't tell what really happened.
---
I mean, the trap keeps you busy when you're out of my sight, but my objective is to kill as many survivors as possible, not keep them busy. I mean, yeah, if I see 2 survivors I'll always chase the one without a trap, but otherwise why not?
---
Omg I didn't notice! I'll have to go flip his positioning once I get out of class :)
---
The biggest issue with "thicc" is much the same problem "curvaceous" and "voluptuous" fell into years prior: guys that love their double-chinners push them as the preferred definition and not the thin-waisted, wide-hipped, lovely busted goddesses it was originally intended for.  
---
the new chapter: dead by loading screen is already here wdym
---
they‚Äôre talking about the birds!
---
If not BBQ, Nurse‚Äôs calling is solid
---
um excuse you, meta perk jesus with spooky instaheal medkit has literally just been born and began playing the game
---
Shirtless Freddy thoooo
---
That‚Äôs kinda ridiculous lmao, like we got into the game just to lag out.
---
No i checked that. I just couldnt hear it ;c
---
I‚Äôd have to guess he likes to troll in her chat 
---
is this a copy pasta?
---
Nurse takes skill and is really hard to use and learn.
---
In point of fact, I was the one who said it wasn't happening, and I was definitely referring to P3 for multiple killers while still having that many add-ons on them.
---
That said, I stand corrected on the grounds of level hasn't always been a factor, but it has for at least the last 6 months, so I'd say I'm feeling confident this is still enough to get him looked into.
---
No argument, solid math. Didn't have a reply.
---
That was weird
---
If he crashes into something his chainsaw is lethal still for that stun.
---
It's a bug. The game thought he hit you before you got in the locker
---
It will update when you get to the menu or after you finish another game
---
[find it here](https://discord.gg/2DMkBEW) 
---
Because you want to kill someone a specific way instead of ending the game? Are you honestly oblivious to the fact that YOU are holding the game hostage here?
---
I'd give Clown a phat S L A P
---
Kinda incorrect, 1 mill takes you to 39-41 if you take cheap stuff.
---
But yes around 600k for late 20s
---
damn so I didn‚Äôt stand a chance then?
---
Yah I agree. Though you switch perspectives a lot. Switching from the entity, the bloodweb, survivors, etc.
---
I‚Äôm not playing Killer until they fix it for this reason.
---
I‚Äôve probably wasted up to 5 Mori‚Äôs and a shit ton of Party Streamers/Survivor Pudding because of the loading screen being stuck at 20%. It‚Äôs annoying and there‚Äôs no way to be compensated for it.
---
I filed a ticket and basically got told *Thank you messaging us! Your Internet Connection must be faulty/Our Servers must be busy!*
---
Annoying.
---
I approve this message
---
I main certain survivors for cosmetics, items, and perks i have unlocked. 
---
For example. I main feng min because i have every perk i have available on her as opposed to my laurie whos level 50 but has no really good perks
---
Ochido got banned and continued to do it, noob3 stopped after getting banned.
---
Not true for many brands, Stihl for instance doesn't have a safety switch. And, many chains continue to sound for a bit after letting go. They are both fucking idiots.
---
Feng here . I'm doing gens every second I'm not being chased until I complete my 2 Gen Rule(need 2 done before I do any saves.) 
---
Yo I'm kate and I actually pump out gens
---
You did, you just have to wait until he a split second until the stun is over. It‚Äôs really hard to pull off.
---
Delete this I already posted this
---
Low rank 20s like you are the reason why she isn't getting nerfed.
---
Sure, but why is that a problem?
---
OK
---
I just play how I want lol. Rank means nothing to me.
---
You can't depip past rank 15 though, so not derankers 
---
I‚Äôve had so many people quit because I was playing Shoe-Gazing-Legion. I like to do it a lot so it gives Behavior incentive to fix their terrible Killer and his mechanics.
---
Preach
---
Though I agree that someone jumping in a locker so you can‚Äôt tombstone them is frustrating, it‚Äôs not holding the game hostage. You clearly know where they are and you are able to grab them out of the locker and hook them. I understand that you want to tombstone them for the achievement, but you are able to kill them if you want to, so they‚Äôre not holding the game hostage.
---
Thats crazy! Gg man! I'm only devotion 1 recently.

It was similar, but still a different post. It was just talking about not helping your teammates with gens and instead getting quick sabo points.
---
Yeah that was pretty much her. Spot on.
---
Wait I‚Äôm confused, one of you says the higher the devotion level - faster shard gain and the other says slower shard gain, ?
---
Once the game is decided like that it's really a dick move on both parts.
---
Why do Ace players always play him like a Cunt?  
---
Yes! Thats right. It was the sabo one.
---
Only to killers that are mentally unstable or dogshit at the game.
---
All I see is narmacs version of shaggy fisting  a stuck in the wall Scooby Doo 
---
Scooby Doo give me that booty!!!
---
Honestly Jen is the most consistently toxic gamer I know that still has a following. There is just a combination of so many things that went right for her it's crazy. A little change in a few things and she would have been canned immediately from having a following.
---
Y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt showing respect to my girl Laurie thoüò§üò§

Dude think about it

Shirtless Myers...

Shirtless Laurie...
---
Need I continue?

This happened to me as well, I injured some survivors and they never healed, later on I went to check on a gen and I saw blood trails leading to a locker so I pulled someone out, and I did the same thing to the next gen. After the match they said they reported me and got it on stream,  because there was no way I would‚Äôve found them without using Iron Maiden. 
---
Not really a gameplay question, but I don't think this deserves a thread of its own. I've recently heard [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO18j9fXNrc) on the radio on the other day and for some reason i imagined it would be the sort of stuff Kate'd have sung before the Entity took her. I mean, it's not at all similar to the jangly stuff she's playing in the Curtain Call chapter, but it sort of has the joie de vivre that she's giving off in her perk flavour texts. 
---
Does anybody else have any other (headcanon) suggestion regarding what songs would have suited her?
---
The Haunting of Autoheaven Wreckers
---
But none of that means we should condone them giving us a terribly optimized game. It doesn't mean we should condone them lying about how much time it takes. Remember the December patch? Where did that go? I understand everything that is going on, but shitty business tactics shouldn't just be accepted.
---
yeah I bought the jacket alone with shards (odd title btw OP) and I don't remember it ever clipping like that. I only recently replaced it with something else and noticed when I switched back.
---
Maybe I'm not remembering correctly though. 
---
Or you know... do Generators?
---
If they sit at the Hatch, go do Gens. If they chase you over to a Gen, you should be able to outrun them back to the Hatch if they decide to hit you. 
---
You‚Äôll get more shards per level of devotion, but the amount of shards you get per experience point is  lower. 
---
So in actuality, you get more shards faster at lower levels of devotion. 
---
Weak
---
I wanted to be the very best that no one ever was ....
---
Strider or predator 
---
That kys tho, so much salt 
---
Imagine wanting a 4 man this bad...
---
Because the trap rarely kills players. It‚Äôs meant to distract them for a limited time to stall the game, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that a recently freed survivor should be let go just because he has a trap on his head. He should be treated like any other injured survivor. 
---
The best use of traps in my opinion is to prevent people from escaping at the end of the game, letting you get some extra bp/ kills. 
---
This is a multi-player game. Infinite items for either killer or survivor, is definitely gonna affect others. Unless you found a single player bot mode I don't know about?
---
Saggy would be a killer what
---
Some people doesn‚Äôt use their brain. It‚Äôs amazing how people always get very salty 
---
That's because these Dumbasses don't realise that if they do that, they'll also get potato survivors for team mates and you are only as good as your team mates, no matter how good you are at junking, etc. Sooner or later they'll go down and you're next. 
---
Get down!  The spirit is nearby!
---
Yeah, I just brainfarted there. But anyway I never argumented that he didn't cheat it, I just replied saying P3 is possible on almost every killer at level 1 (and therefore any amount of pre leveling system addon/offering is also possible on those killers), never said anything before the reply about addons and doesn't change the fact that what we see on the SS is entirely "possible" even though highly unlikely and we pretty much know he's cheating, its just a matter of proving it with enough evidence to warrant a punishment.
---
I do agree with just doing something else instead especially when you see that the killer is camping the hatch. They definitely put themselves in a weird position. 
---
Imagine thinking a Legion is going to let you pallet stun them when they are in frenzy
---
I don‚Äôt consider myself an AMAZING Killer, but I can almost consistently get 3-4 Kills with only 2 Gens being done as Legion. And don‚Äôt even get me started on  doing the 3-Gen Strat with Discordance/Overcharge/Play With Your Food. 
---
My problem is that with the right perks, he becomes impossible to get away from. Sloppy Butcher and Bloodhound will let him follow you from so far away, so your only choice is to run away and stall time before you bleed out, or take the down and get hooked. 
---
I use both Bloodhound and Sloppy butcher, and as long as you don‚Äôt stare at the Survivor/Stare at the floor, they will never escape you. Following somebodies blood while they‚Äôre on a Death Timer isn‚Äôt really a fair mechanic, nor is it even fun. And I‚Äôm saying this as someone who plays Killer more than Survivor. Legion to me is just cheap.
---
Thank you to whoever downvoted, you have really helped me and anyone else with a similar situation find a possible answer as to why this happened so it can be avoided in the future.
---
Then iron maiden kicks In, here we go again
---
Its basically a flamebait post. Its just lame.
---
He's going... Even further beyond!
---
My friend literally got stuck there yesterday and the killer just stared at him confused üò≠üòÇ 
---
The worst thing is, that I‚Äôm a survivor main, but I would never talk ugly to any other survivor or killer in the match, because I can‚Äôt see a reason to do it. If I get mad, I just get over it. It‚Äôs weird that people have the urge to talk shit to other people, just because they are behind a screen. 
---
But killers and survivors do hate each other on this subreddit. I haven‚Äôt even seen the stream but it sounds like a pretty damn good impression of reddit.The autism thing makes no sense, the guy with the autism username should probably have gotten banned too. 
---
10 minutes? Most 3v1s last like 5 minutes. God they at least need to double point output for Altruism and Coop Points to give incentive to not just DC.
---
Why does this look like a painting
---
I didn't say that either. The game runs like absolute shit on my PC which sucks because I really enjoy playing it. Would I like to play above 50-60 fps? Of course. Do I recognize that performance has gotten a bit better since my time playing, and that BHVR is now in control of their product and actively working to make it better? Also of course
---
Idk, with the hit boxes rn anywhere else the killer might swing at a tree and hit you. 
---
As I said, full defense mode. All of the sudden most people who use the word thicc are actually chubbychasers who use the word as an excuse. Holy shit you're hilarious. Like I said, you just keep making shit up to fit youre narrative.  
---
And how did this become about me? Hell yeah I like a big ass but I'm not into fat women haha.  
---
I like how you took it all so personal though. Anyway, I will be removing this comment and the rest of the comment chain in ~5 minutes because I want you to read this but I don't intend to continue this shitty conversation with some nerdy white dude who got offended because he never understood where the word thicc originated from since all his knowledge in life comes from video games and reddit. Like holy shit dude, 'trolling on tinder', where do you get this shit from? Hahaha. 'Below average women'. Jesus christ the incel is shining bright.
---
what movie/show is this from? looks brutal
---
Very salty, but what can you do
---
Great immature reply you fuckwit. Care to have any context? Was the gates open? Because you saying that to him makes you look like a fuckwit. Fuckwit.
---
David is my type so.... 
---
I've always thought of the possibility of making it so, if there is swf, the killer can hear them talking too but only within a certain proximity, might even introduce some cool new perks and items in the future, and make swf less of a pain for the killer.
---
 either that or just remove swf from ranked play.
---
no matter how short the chase, if your team sits on gens consistently there is no way 0 gens get done
---
Ah, wasn't aware!
---
I see your deliverence and raise you a pebble 
---
You are probably an absolute hoot to be around at parties. 
---
It is flaired as a shitpost for a reason, Doctor. 
---
What is this
---
I was in chat. You asked to be banned.
---
Are you always this butthurt when interaction with women doesn't go the way you want?
---
Watch Tru3ta1ent and check what he runs. I always go with what he runs and intrigues me
---
2.5.1 the update we wanted 
---
But this is the shit we got
---
everyone that hit rank 1 knows rank doesnt matter. That explains your comment and your cry-baby post.
---
legion fun
---
I had thought you already used the exploit for your advantage, so nvm what I said lol
---
No. He'll just give you Vasectomy or Anal probe. Your choice, of course. 
---
After 3 minutes not about the 4-man, it's more on principle.
---
2 things.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
1 - Like the video description says, the other 3 people in the match were fine. They were normal players with normal movement, and didn't say anything about being laggy during the match.
---
2 - Why am I being downvoted?
---
I see your reeeee and raise you 
---
üåΩ
---
They accidentally buffed the end screen instead of Freddy.
---
I went against a person who had 400 ping and yet they accused me of lag switching because "his character was all over the place". They just can't accept defeat.
---
well my internets just shit innit
---
You never know some peoples demons though. They most likely have a depressing/stressful life, which can be a ton of different factors like unhealthy home life, bullying, etc.
---
I find most Survivors who tell me to kill myself or whatever have unhealthy hours in Dead By Daylight/other games, so you can tell how much winning m/having power over somebody else is to them. 
---
Montos  trapper builds are nice and informative check em out
---
Imagine feeling like the good guy after making an autism joke.
---
i think there should be a killer who has a mori as a teachable skill
---
mines were fine.
---
Maybe its your Internet, or the hosts?
---
It's a physics issue. They recently updated the Unreal version the game runs on which means any changes to the physics are reflected on the game. Lots of small stuff like Dwight's tie have these clipping issues. BVHR needs to make them hang out further.
---
They need to release a swimsuit cosmetics for all the characters.
---
I‚ÄôD KILL TO SEE DWIGHT AND DAVID IN A SPEEDO
---
I‚Äôm hoping for a plague doctor. The mask would be sick.
---
He is
---
Tru3ta1ent is a worse Monto, Change my mind
---
Using Iron Grasp, Agitation to get people to the basement and then trapping all the entrances is pretty hard to counter. It's a pretty unfun "toxic" build though. Just pair those 2 with either more dungeon perks or like Enduring/Spirit Fury for chases.
---
As a rank 1 Nurse main, I might be able to give tips.
---
Learn their blink pattern. Some nurses will try to cut you off or blink in front of you. If you figure this out quickly, you learn to run backwards as they charge a blink to juke them. 
---
If they catch on, they might blink behind you, expecting you to run into them. I do this. Both parties are to adapt to each other. You both learn to juke each other.
---
Stay still. Easy, but a lot of good killers rely on movement. I do. About 80% of the time, I won‚Äôt see someone standing still in a corner, but you have to know what you‚Äôre doing. Hopefully this kind of helps.
---
Pallets and windows won‚Äôt help you
---
idk, i've had like 15 matches today, like half are completely normal like 100 ping and the other half have been UNPLAYABLE even after showing low ping in the lobby.
---
Omg that'd be amazing thankyou I'll keep it in mind :') 
---
Yeah it will be on the street sometimes. It's just kind of a meme at this point that it only ever spawns in that stupid dead end room. 
---
Damn I thought they fixed all the trees on Haddonfield... Guess they added more tree bugs lol
---
might just be a lag during the game, guess that happens and 8 Games arent enough to make any real assumptions
---
So far it's basically just of measure of how much you play. 
---
Only BHVR knows if it'll do anything in the future.
---
Don‚Äôt forget about...
---
THE *S P I R I T*
---
Oh wow I couldn't see the difference in the description. Thanks for clarifying!
---
Omg you‚Äôre actually braindead
---
He means genrushing/tunneling. 
---
Beat me to it with the Bing bonging idea
---
Throw me in that second to last part.
---
Well, inbetween the chest looting and totem cleansing... I gotta get paid for what I do y'know?
---
Breaking totems to counter noed lol.  So true.  Randoms are allergic to dull totems 
---
That woupd be awesome for the pig. Set it up and the survivor would have to pull the trigger themselves. Though some would probably hold up games with it.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to debate the better player as both are great. I just prefer True because he‚Äôs not as talkative or loud. He also explains things more effectively imo. Different strokes for different folks
---
So much for upvote‚Äôs...
---
It wasn‚Äôt full though

---
Oh look, another survivor main coming into be a toxic little shit for no reason.
---
People like you are exactly what's wrong with the community. Why so salty? did you get camped or something today?
---
she does slash your throat, in game tapp actually has a scar on his throat too
---
i would honestly fork over 20 dollars for shirtless myers. His abs should function like a flashlight against survivors
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure she said that after you were banned. even so, my point still stands, you asked to be banned, sure, couldve been well deserved after making a joke about autism, but you asked to be banned. 
---
I dont know why you feel as if youve been vilified for making a joke about autism. Thats generally not accepted. Like anywhere lmao
---
Ah good to see it's not just me then.....or wait maybe that's bad lol if it's common.
---
Can't believe all these toxic survivor mains with nea or meg in their profile coming in just to talk shit. These are the kinds of people who run around clicking a flashlight and tbag at every pallet I bet. This is why a lot of people stop playing the game. I've never seen a game with such an awful playerbase, absolute cancer.
---
It's actually hilarious. And it's a movie, but I cannot for the life of me remember the title right now
---
might even be a Speed cheat.
---
Those things arent all that uncommon
---
I play legion and I know how much of a broken mechanic it is, I usually chase people by attacking them with my frenzy attack 4 times. Imo its much more fun for both parties and has counterplay.
---
Lmao we get downvoted for talking. Never did I even say I find that behavior fun or good. Yet all people see is LEGION and go crazy.
---
Can confirm the Jake stereotype; I'm the dude doing that one gen no one else wants to do because its beside the basement.
---
Also the guy who opts to hide instead of run; I could squeeze my ass into the tightest spots just to not get spotted.
---
No, best looking survivor. Not most horrific killer.
---
Matchmaking sucks dick
---
The animation from the survivors view is wrong, makes you think is over with the chainsaw.
---
Basically you shouldn't ever prestige any character that you will miss, since it allegedly takes like 50mil BP or some insane amount to get P3 all perks.
---
You should also have some character that you enjoy in order to farm tons of BP on to feed the prestige pit.
---
I'm on console so I don't use hag much. If you're just looking for perks, the pig has pretty mediocre perks.
---
At least Nurse requires skill
---
Well no im not just looking for perks. Why did you suggest pig then ?
---
You can try to game the system by intentionally queuing at the same time as the streamer. If you're playing killer, open a lobby just before they queue. If you're playing survivor, wait for them to make a lobby, then queue. 
---
You can also figure it out if you got the right person by usernames and cosmetics if you're the killer trying to snipe a survivor.
---
It really does.
---
Ah. 
---
&gt; I'll DC right when I see you teabagging at the exit gates,
---
They still get the points for escaping twat.
---
So for the achievements on PS4 that are grinds (500 electric shock attacks for doctor, putting 200 survivors into dream world with Freddy, etc.) does doing the same action multiple times to the same survivor count as 1 or multiple times for the achievement?
---
I.E. if I‚Äôm Freddy and I put someone to sleep, hook them, they get freed, and I put them to sleep again, is that 2 towards the 200 or 1?
---
Lol.  I thought you quit this game?  
---
If they haven't left yet, cunt? Good to know Douche-canoe. Thank you.
---
You probably shouldn't be playing killer if this is your mind set.
---
The downvotes are because you're wrong and made it look like fact. Don't respond if you don't know the answer lol
---
No, I get that. My point is, the game cannot tell. Killer is host. If the host disappears your game can't know why. It doesn't know if they crashed, lagged out, force quit, or if you lagged out. It all looks the same to the game.
---
I thought I did know the answer and that's why I commented. Apparently I was wrong
---
Yes, this happens to me with my Xbox One. 
---
Ruin is obviously the first perk you should pick up. You spend a lot of the early game setting up traps so you don‚Äôt have much map pressure and ruin has a ton of map pressure, but Ruin is good in every killer so that‚Äôs that. 
---
Pretty much every chase perk is good for trapper. He‚Äôs a M1 killer without his traps so he suffers from loops, so I recommend Enduring and Brutal Strength. Really any chase perk works but those are the 2 I would use the most. 
---
Didn't they implement luck increases rarity on a items in the 2.5 update
---
Oh I get what you mean. Can‚Äôt wait for designated servers lol
---
The typical build is the same for all of the "Mouse 1" Killers at the moment, BBQ, Hex:Ruin, Enduring and Spirit Fury. It's just basically the most effective build for getting kills at the moment, assuming you know how to mind game most tiles properly.
---
Typically you'll want to try to get as many Survivors asleep as possible, since they get a base 50% slow to all action speed while asleep, and if they're all asleep, the only way they have to wake up is Generators. It also gives you pretty good awareness of where everyone is. Don't be afraid to stop a chase to grab someone else into the dream world.
---
He's pretty weak, so there isn't much outside of just having good Killer fundamentals that can be said about how to play Fredward.
---
I like playing her and I only tunnel when it‚Äôs clear there are bad solo survivors and one godly survivor who‚Äôs somehow low rank as I don‚Äôt want to deal with them the entire match. 
---
That said I used to do this constant as I would hit everyone and I would keep reapplying pig traps for the achievement, but now that I have it I don‚Äôt really do it anymore at all. 
---
Then there are people who don‚Äôt really get how to play as Amanda and screw up or are dumb. 
---
I'll stop all of this toxicity... BY BEING TOXIC! MWAHAHAHAHA
---
Lmao Douche-canoe
---
As a survivor, an endless chase is an unqualified victory.  If you can loop a killer eternally while your teammates finish every gen, they‚Äôve lost.  No, hiding from a doctor isn‚Äôt very likely to work, but if they can‚Äôt close out the chase it doesn‚Äôt really matter.
---
Swap Jake and Feng and it all fits perfectly
---
Because I want to have fun? Just to be clear. Losing a match doesn't bother me. Toxicity on both sides does. Which is why I said same for toxic killers.
---
I'm a nice Killer. Like give the hatch away, don't facecamp etc etc.
---
Well that wasn't loud and obnoxious at all.
---
