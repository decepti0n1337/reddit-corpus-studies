Well the same could be said for ruin. I’ve had games where had it not been for ruin, they probably would have all escaped. You can literally say the same for every perk. It’s what they’re there for. To make the game easier and give you an advantage. My job is to kill, and if NoED makes killing easier, I’ll use it. I don’t care about my opponents feelings. Same with when I’m survivor, I don’t care how I survive, I survive with the tools given to me. 
---
---
---
Yeah, I had a similar arc to you where I didn’t play for a while over the holidays, so when I left they were considered maybe worse than Freddy and when I came back they were the most broken and unfun thing.  I bought that dope pink-haired Susie outfit back right when they came out, so I plan on using them from time to time regardless of where public opinion rests.
---
That is so laughably false it hurts. The sleep timer is such a none issue, the only bad part about his kit is the lack of usefulness in a chase. As I said earlier, the only thing they need to do is make survivors falling asleep unable to interact. The scenario where this is important is totems and gates, everything else doesn't have a huge effect. 
---
I CANT PLAY THIS FUCKING GAME BECAUSE ITS LAGGY AS HELL IN XB1 AND NO MATTER WHAT I DO I ALWAYS GET CALLED BABY KILLER, GG EZ PLEB KYS 
---

---
FUCK THIS GAME AAAAAAAA
---
If thanataphobia gave you the full 4 injured survivors effect 100% of the time it would still suck. Sorry, not sorry.
---
yea but the other people commenting dont get it
---
That was the best thing I've seen on this sub since Dead by Doolight.
---
The fact isnt that you won with noed. It's that you got online to talk shit like you did some miraculous and skillful play when you didnt.
---
so what should i flare it as, or i am not allowed to post this here?
---
hh what i mean is the other people who commented on this post didnt take it as a meme
---
I mean in general.
---
You can't dictate what killers enjoy 
---
what is swf
---
If you end up getting lucky with your team mates, it can happen. But more often than not it seems like two gens get done and then everyone gives up and waits for the hatch. It’s pretty annoying. 
---
From a wrestling fan to a DBD fan, I love this whole thing.
---
Boo.
---
Damn she thicc
---
They should make it so that you don't de-pip if you get camped/tunneled to death. 
---
You say it's a non issue then bring up scenarios where it is an issue... I wasn't saying the timer is terrible I was saying that since he's the only one that has the timer it makes him bad when compared to other killers. 
---
And you keep saying that all they need to do is make it so that survivors falling asleep can't interact. Well currently survivors can interact while falling asleep. So it is an issue that needs changing. I'm not sure what you're arguing here.
---
Had legion 3 times in a row, almost uninstalled.
---
I would imagine they pick the average?
---
&gt; As for escaping chases, using the scratch marks to lead a killer one way and then using UE to crouch off the other way before the killer realizes is great. 
---
I've been trying to do this - but by the time I'm trying to backtrack anywhere - I'm in his sight line again. I'll keep practicing. Thanks! 
---
ye, it should be disabled as soon as all swf Players are dead/escaped
---
For solo though what would be to stop you from just messaging the randoms
---
It's a nice quality of life fix.
---
Until, like me, you ready up then accidentally knock your PS4 controller and switch from your fully tricked out killer to the L1, zero perk killer you never play.
---
Need to be a bit more careful next time.
---
It was on ptb as well. Really frustrating that they pushed to live without fixing it, it's honestly game breaking. 
---
The guy I was playing with only lost his character progress but not his rank.
---
You make it seem like it's his biggest issue that needs fixing for him to be good. This is not correct. I simply gave the change that needed to be done to fix what is a small issue in his kit.
---
Pure artistry. Keep up the good work 
---
The way it works is that the killer lobby can't tell if you're SWF or not so they hide it from everyone.
---
It could change when we eventually get those dedicated servers in Summer but as someone else said... it wouldn't stop people messaging randoms and leaking your build anyway. So I don't know if they'll change that.
---
every single time i hit the ds I always just yell "outskilled" because ds is balanced
---
Everyone upvote this to the top.
---
You're hilarious.
---
TAKE OUT YOUR AIRPODS
---
Hey fellow young people! 
---
...and the chase restarts
---
Honestly with as little as I play killer these days and the plethora of toxic messages I get when I do I can’t blame the killers for snapping and being toxic themselves. 
---
i mean i don't personally look at the flairs and even if people "sorted" by that i think they would clearly care more about the actual post than the category, since it's no one's fault that mods didn't think of one category.
---
The only sad thing here is your username
---
I think “online” disagrees with you. It was a funny moment where a toxic survivor got what was coming to them. Anyone could have done it, I’m not denying that. But clearly you’re just a butthurt survivor main. 
---
Post has nothing to do with NOED. NOED isn't even active. Person is upset about NOED. Seems like your typical salty survivor main to me! lmao
---
It's honestly nasty. They need to do something huge with this game soon.. new game modes or something 
---
It use to work like that. It was changed some months ago to take the average of all survivors. 
---
I wasnt aware we weren't allowed to respond, my bad
---
You should feel good
---
600 hours played and I've only almost got every teachable. Yeah, the grind is insane.
---
The only reason the game can't tell that some people are SWF must be because the developer do not have the competense to make it so. I mean you join the lobby together. Can't be that hard to fix it. If you are in a lobby before joining killer lobby like you are in SWF, just give those player a code or whatever that comes with them into the killer lobby. People who join solo won't get that code.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We have all seen that with every update they usually break more thing then they fix. I doubt dedicated server will be much better then P2P.
---
Honestly.
---
can’t relate 
---
Object of Obsession does that.
---
Michael is a great villain, but he is definitely a suspense specialist as far as slashers go. Jason is the king of bringing horny teens to violent ends. 
---
Similarly, Freddy is the master of evil sass, but DBD has stripped him of all his personality. Maybe my expectations are a bit high when it comes to my Hollywood killers, but that’s a conversation for another day.
---
Anyhow, I very much appreciate them all. 
---
I could also say the survivors were to lazy to cleanse totems during the match and that’s their mistake being capitalized on. 
---
Yeah it still works
---
all i said was that u guys didnt read the tag shitpost lol
---
Hex perks are meant to be high risk high reward perks. You shouldn’t get good spots every time, you should know that upon entering a match. 
---
Yeah that would be way too good to be honest. Hexes glowing is perfectly fine
---
nice try but reality is when you down a SWF the rest just DC
---
Are you mad?
---
Knowing the killer has noed/blood warden isnt gonna help? Confirming that totem is haunted ground and not devour hope?
---
This is indeed a worthy meme-rabbit hole to venture into...
---
It also wouldn’t hurt to give the killer confirmation that they missed their decisive.  DS is very strong and I don’t think giving the killer a little more info would change that.  
---
I dont disagree with parts of this but youre being silly bud.
---
I bought his dlc to stop getting those
---
Looking as well,fairly new and have shit knowledge of maps,this could help
---
Lol baby killer 2ez
---
Why havent we gotten a FPS fix yet? I truly do not understand. The game has been on console for more than a year now and we are running on 30 FPS max. It honestly makes no sense (coming from a PS4 player) just lower the graphics or something 
---
So thank them in the email?
---
Lol I love how that's the go to nowadays. The majority of my hours in this game are killer ~350 with about 150 being survivor. I just disagree with the "killer main" consensus that NOED isnt a crutch. You can do the normal "I'm superior because I main the other side" comment that is so common nowadays as some sort of justification but NOED is a crutch no matter which way you slice it.
---
If one escapes it 100% doesn't matter because the rest are right behind him, we're talking SWF. Since there's a separate lobby system I'd much rather SWF players not be able to see the killer loadoat till the game is over, but I play solo and really liked looking at what the killer had and if he was a beast or if I just got killed by a rank 20 lol
---
I can only think of NOED being something SWFs tell each other about, and then they're wasting time cleaning dull totems
---
Sorry bro, i didnt know! Don't be mad 
---
yeah I know It was a joke ree
---
Might be healthier but i think it hurts new players. They way i learnt what alot of perks does is by checking them out post game after i noticed the killer did some things i had never seen before, like insidious, Blood Warden, Fanklins Demise among many others. Thankfully i today know almost every single perk. Nowadays i check the perks just to see what most people are running so i can somewhat prepare my survivor. 
---
It’s because everyone has a limit to how much they can take. I ask them all the time when it happens and give them the gg even when they face camp me. 9 times out of 10 they apologize and say something about the last game they played being nothing but bs
---
Survivor with Friends.  It allows you to play with people you know.  
---
🤔
---
You could also say the killer was too bad to get more than 1 kill otherwise.
---
Not really. My swf group already cleanses every totem on the map as is and it goes perfectly fine
---
a mixture of jason, freddy, michael, and leatherface
---
It should spawn as 2 Hex Totems. It's apparently stronger than Haunted Ground so why shouldn't it have 2 totems. Destroying 1 nullifies the Hex. Problem solved.
---
This thread is delicious
---
Trapper looks so happy to be Jason's pupil!
---
True that..
---
Decisive strike, urban evasion, self care, and adrenaline is probably the most meta build you'll get out of that. 
---
I'd personally run self care, we'll make it, stake out, and lithe, simply because when I play survivor I like to be altruistic, so that helps with that and I just like stake out because it lets me chill out about hitting great skill checks (also helps if ruin is bothering you.) 
---
I wouldn't bother its not a good meme 
---
I've never tried playing nurse because of everyone saying it sucks on console but i did and it makes me feel happy that i got a 4k
---
For tonight’s punishment, Sal has to play killer against swf dstrike squads with no perks 
---
This is correct. People still believe otherwise since they aren't aware it was changed for some reason. It's based on the average now.
---
You do lose points in one of the emblems (icr which), so you are less likely to pip, but like I said, these killers don't care about pipping.
---
Man without bbq and chili they wouldn’t have found anyone, that crutch perk got them kills!
---
Without stridor he wouldn’t have heard them and got those kills, such a crutch perk!
---
Without surveillance he wouldn’t have know what gens they were on, what a crutch perk to help him kill!
---
He would have never caught them in the basement without territorial imperative, that crutch perk got him some kills!
---
If you play the game with made up rules, expect your bubble to be popped a lot. If you play every game assuming there is no NOED then who’s fault is it when you get caught by it? There is counterplay, it’s in the game, bad players will keep whining about it.
---
I think we all prestige or main someone we relate to in some way, be it image, backstory, or what we perceive would be their personality. Nea is my girl, because she looked like the sort of person that would have people's back, would have a wicked sense of humour, and would be a pain in the ass for a killer to get their hands on. 
---
I have her P3 level 50 right now and I am well on my way to maxing out the perks I have available to me. I don't actually use her prestige clothes, except occasionally her top, because I am far from a fan of the exploded bolognaise sauce look that they have. 
---
I never said it didn't feel good 😉
---
Kindred and asking them how your dick smells is all you can do to a face camper
---
Bming? 
---
Keep at it and become one of the first console god nurses!
---
If you want my honest opinion, get the spirit. I have been getting dominated by the damn thing. Her perks are a lot better than the average killers. You just have to learn how to use her, shes not easy. But I think you will spend your money right by buying her. Hope this helped! Happy killing!
---
Weird, because one of my friend sees it red when we're two on a gen, but I only see it red when we're at least three on the same gen.
---
Bad manner
---
Oh, yeah I went back and saw the tea bagging. Tbh I usually tea back a little if the killer is right there lol. I don’t consider it being toxic. I really do it if they camp or something though. 
---
Ty im so happy about this :)
---
Thanks! I will consider her.
---
This is sick,id play the hell out of him
---
might wanna trim the video, screen goes black at 1:01
---
They can’t even fully see the items you have just a general thing. No rarity. No addons or anything. Even if they have Franklins they can’t onow what you dropped cause they still can’t see the items details. Plus the whole point of the op image and the need for this change is to bring SWF and solo survivor a bit closer in terms of what’s given in knowledge so we can go forward with balancing the game better. Everyone knows BHVR won’t take out SWF and also can’t nerf Survivors as if everyone plays SWF so the best way to balance that power gap out is to hinder the strength of SWF and one of the most annoying things was that you could get your whole build snitched on cause someone died 3 mins in the game. 
---
Plus as a solo survivor, you should be able to read the game better. If you’re THAT curious then I guess you’re sticking around till endgame otherwise just go next and stop complaining to complain. 
---
that is wrong
---
all of them have to be Claudette's p3
---
You can’t blame survivors for camping killers. In that case I’ll spin it the other way and say the reason many survivors play toxic now is because of bad experiences with camping killers. 
---
found the survivor main
---
Hell nah I've just had 2 games in the meat locker where ruin stayed up the whole game despite my devotion to destroying it. Totem spawns are fine now.
---
Its definitely a fine line between too far and well hidden, but its only something you can learn from experience. Good luck!
---
Are you slapping on my Michael
---
David bois gang is here 
---
I got so fucken salty when i ran kindred and watched them all just.....stay on their gens until i hit phase 2
---
Anytime
---
...you can just go to your killer page and read it to learn what perks do
---
I've just been in this place before

Higher on the street

Calling you and the search is mystery

Standing on my feet

It's so hard when I try to be me uoooh!

Deja vu

It's so hard when I try to be me yeah!

See the future into the present

See my past lives in the distance

Try to guess now what's going on
---
And the band begin's to play...
---
Let's put the box closer to the window vault huuuuuur duuuuuuur. Fucking christ man.
---
I’ve been fully circled by my team and the killer for my full 2 minute duration with Kindred cause one person tried to quick unhook and got grabbed so the other two game running in for saves after. Killer doesn’t leave cause all 4 of us are literally right there and allies are just standing there staring at me as if the killer has anything to lose. 
---
I feel bad when my mission for the night is on one of my level 1 killers(still fairly new) and I have to scum it with 1 base perk...
---
thats true. as far as i know friday the 13th pretty much invented the whole 'a virgin, nerd, jock, and stacey go into the woods and get murdered' slasher formula
---
Yes, he is extremely easy to loop and it's almost impossible to catch a Sprint Burst/Lithe survivor in any maps that are dense on pallets. He needs 115% move speed, Frenzy is not a teleport. Change my mind.
---
I'm Rank 1 Spirit. Never used NOED on her. Seeing other Spirits complain about Toxicity when they run that shit perk angers me. I couldn't let that slip.
---
Great post OP. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
---
Found the baby killer
---
You‘re welcome! :)
---
Enjoy the patch!
---
Now that you mention, that's a pretty good idea.
---
Is save the best for last bugged? I was hitting survivors but stacks weren’t appearing. 
---
You tease a great play but don’t show it.......?
---
I'm pretty sure I saw this posted on r/bestbuddies as well 
---
A prison inmate Clown who has a toothbrush shank and a large bushy beard
---
Opinion, not fact.  
---
That's how arguments work, stick with your points and adapt to what the opponent gives, exactly what I've done.
---
You said my leading point for me. Thank you. LF has a guarantee to take out only players in front of him or players dumb enough to rush a hook. Yet, look at other defensive killers and they can punish the same, he doesn't get much use out of his saw if survivors have a brain. He can't use it to change a loop or help in a chase.
---
If you are getting more than one down in any other place other than a hook then the survivor messed up and his current kit helped. But other than the rare example that it is, his saw has no other use in a chase or for map pressure.
---
He is basic and brain dead. Giving him the power to mindgame in a chase, force a pallet drop, try and sawrun a wall loop would allow him to be a interactive and diverse killer, while still remaining true to the characters defensive homage.
---
I don’t avoid the poison. I run right through it. It makes you trip balls. It’s always better to get hooked high off your ass. 
---
There is an hentai about fucking ghosts so im not surprised
---
*Allow us to introduce ourselves.*
---
I have no idea why this hasn't gotten any love or comments but I'll be honest that was great. I enjoyed really all of it. It honestly all made sense. I'd send this to the devs 
---
If they didn't want killers to have shitloads of not fun items, maybe they shouldn't have not fun items.
---
this is coming from the guy who is acting like your generic P3 toxic claudette
---
You can use his saw in some loops though. Increase the charge time and its lethal.
---
He is the best hook defender in the game. That’s it. That’s his MO. He punishes you for being caught away from vaults and pallets. More than half the killers in the game have nothing in loops. This is why you run during/Spirit fury/ bamboozle on these killers.
---
The issues of his weakness in loops isn’t a Leatherface exclusive problem dude.
---
WHY DO PEOPLE SAY I CAMP WITH THE HAG WHEN I AM LITERALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP CHASING PEOPLE.
---
People acting like messaging the other survivors the killers perks is a common thing. I've been playing this game for a long time now and have seen some shit but i've never had a person messaging after they died.
---
Unfortunately, I wasn't there to witness this, but you can see what happened in the statuses and thanks to the downed person's aura.
---
Leatherface could also be the episode where Frank busts out the chainsaw at the end when they're in the serial killer's/hardware store guy's apartment.
---
Dead by Daylight Wiki is good too
---
I would say discordance (this meme aside)
---
Cowgirl Kate
---
Hilarious
---
WHY DO I KEEP SPAWNING JUST OUTSIDE THE KILLER'S TERROR RADIUS. IN THE LAST TEN MATCHES, I HEAR THE HEARTBEAT WITHIN 15 SECONDS OF SPAWNING
---
Ah this made me laugh, I love it!
---
Multiple times people have confirmed a moris to be an ebony or just an ivory or what ever other perk I need to know like rancor if they notice I have an obsession perk and I have no way of knowing. All I have to is click the name and I can tell them. I don’t have to open discord or whatever.
---
r/everyfuckingthread
---
[removed]
---
And still 5 gens
---
and your P a b l o at the bottom right good job 
---
I would like to know what to do while he is chasing me, you do gens against any killer.
---
Probably not, no.
---
Not enough med kits is a problem 
---
Not just that, but as a new player that "second chance" oftentimes just goes to waste since you know nothing about the maps, routes, or even basic mechanics of the game.
---
He still did a great job but I think he was stressed and that is probably why he got mad at the survivors 
---
It’s not the killers that need to change, but rather the loops.
---
because it’s not fun for the person being chased who has no counterplay... same reason why people complain about camping and tunneling when everyone else can “just do gens”
---
“Lore”
---
Ur a god
---
IDK about that lol but thanks &lt;3
---
The fun thing about the animation is that you as killer will not be able to see it you know.... Because you're in first person is something only for survivors
---
You impressed me thoooo
---
"Doing gens" isn't counterplay, it's your object.
---
Thanks! I have another post where I run a p3 bubba around if you wanna see that lol.
---
Indeed he can, he managed to get into tier 2 from the boat, couldn't tell where he was until the tier 2 music!
---
SWF was added quickly to the game (hence constantly having to reinvite etc) and the devs haven't done anything with it since. They said it's because they have other things that are more important to them to mess with. Whether you believe this or not is up to you but it makes a sort of sense to me. It may in fact be laziness, but I wouldn't say it's incompetence. I just don't think they care about it much.
---
That said, the dedicated server will know who was SWF though because it will retain that information instead of losing it by changing hosts. When we have those servers it *should* be able to keep SWF in SWF lobbies after matches and be able to single things out. If they don't do it then, I will agree with you re: incompetence. Dedicated servers will of course have their own issues depending on how they're implemented. Until it's done we can't say whether it'll be great or not.
---
And yes, many of the updates do break other aspects of the game due to the original way they coded it. They updated the engine (which didn't like that code much) and are working on converting all the code over to something cleaner that will likely fuck up less.

Thanks! 
---
It's +10% speed based on nearby survivors, however when you're on a gen with someone else you're repairing at 90% speed each and thus it goes to 99% for you instead of 100.
---
I doubt it is possible to have 100% speed each on a gen because of this.
---
I've seen it, I respect Ardetha as a killer but it must be said that the freddy in that video was horrible. Second, i was addressing the sleep timer when survivors are on objectives like gens or gates. Finally the majority of that video is a comment on killers in general, most of it was pallet looping, which is something freddy is suseptible to because of his powers lack of use in a chase, which is what I argue to be his biggest flaw. The sleep timer plays a very minor role in the duration of that chase. Had that freddy been better, the chase would have been over much faster.
---
that's great have they fixed matchmaking yet?
---
I play survivor 80% and Killer the other 20%. My view on it is NOED is not a crutch on certain killers. I have played this game for many hours since the release of this game. There are certain killers which NOED fits into their perk loadouts or playstyle well. Pig is one of them, it fits her general play and I am not bothered by it. I run small game for this instance. The only time I will even remotely call it a crutch is on people who use it on Michael, Billy and sometimes Nurse. If you are using it on Billy or nurse it is a semi crutch if you are using it to secure at least 1 kill for some bloodpoints while you are learning their power or for Memes. Micheal in my opinion is the only inexcusable one. He is made to Tier up to get you that insta down. If you cannot down survivors while using his power you are not playing him correctly and you are a bad killer. That being said, I enjoyed your video and the Nea got what she deserved.
---
#STRESS LEVELS 99%
---
No clue...
---
THEY ARE WORKING ON THAT. BUT IF WE RUSH THEM WE'LL JUST GET FREDDY OVERNERF 2.0. WE DON'T WANT THAT, DO WE ?
---
We're talking about giving the killer confirmation that the obsession missed their decisive strike, not your idea.
---
No... Should feel like a hero that you are
---
Make your choice...
---
P.S: Claudette finally let me out at 1:28 if y’all can’t be bothered watching
---
Oh and also apparently I got reported, these are the messages: https://imgur.com/gallery/nYx9AbL
---
Lol, trash ass baby killer. Shut the fuck up and get good. Trash bitch
---
Just hearing Kira's theme when playing against him would be a dream come true.
---
THEY'VE HAD MORE THAN PLENTY OF TIME FOR IT TO NOT BE RUSHED. THERE'S HONESTLY NO EXCUSE AT THIS POINT OTHER THAN THEY'VE BEEN SITTING AROUND TWIDDLING THEIR THUMBS OVER THE FREDDY ISSUE ALL THIS TIME. 
---
Is this dude using multiple accounts to compliment himself? Lol
---
Today I was playing and this one David was farming everyone off hooks, and then at the very end of the game I was running to the gate and the Huntress threw a hatchet at me and downed me, picked me up and the David was teabagging and body blocking the huntress. 
---
Little did I know, he was insta-downed for some reason. Huntress dropped me on the ground and proceeded to mori the David. Right in front of the gate.
---
She had Rancor. I messaged the huntress and said thanks and she was being really kind and all. Great game.
---
Lmao he still has 5 gens left
---
The baby face is still awful tho
---
Lol no idk why people are saying I'm a god...
---
Did you hit your obsession? Because you will lose stacks if you hit your obsession.
---
So awesome. I hope they get some license to Jason in the future.
---
That's why it's facing the other way lmao
---
I felt bad for her so I carried her to the exit. This lag... 
---
Same problem I’m in. He will learn eventually
---
Thank you, that’s rewarding coming from someone who’s played the game as much as yourself. I’ve only been playing for a few months, so when someone with a lot more experience agrees with me, it’s really cool. And my view on NOED is the same as yours. Some people use it as a crutch, but the perk in and of itself is not a crutch. All the people dissing and insulting people who use it might as well insult healthy people for eating healthy food. “Haha, you eat salad and fish loser.” “Well it’s good for my body and it keeps me healthy.” “Yeah, but you use it as a crutch to stay healthy loser. Try and be healthy without it and then what?”
---
I need a third person killer mode to actually enjoy the view tho :/
---
Poor guy gets downvoted for answering a question
---
I’m here to serve. 
---
Yea I understand, would be really nice 
---
Can we just for a second ignore the meme and see how that dog is unconfortable in that situation? Someone kill that mf, doggo must feel happy
---
Joke.
---
i think the window thing would be too busted, but the speed should be around 150-200 not 250. other than that i like the ideas 
---
Definitely scary and more realistic nowadays. But I feel like *supernatural* killers can be more unique not only in design but also in their powers! Teleporting, turning invisible, etc. I just feel like there's so much more they could add.
---
Ikr... Just gotta play survivor and get put on her shoulder :/ 
---
No it's the killers that need ways to handle the loops mixed with potential for skill. The current loops are mostly fine. 
---
WE ARE ONLY 2 FRIENDS AND WE JUST WANT TO PLAY A PUBLIC LOBBY BUT ONE OF US TO BE THE KILLER! WHY CAN'T WE PLAY IT LIKE THAT? 
---
Some people deserve more than other to be run over by a truck
---
CAN WE MAKE SCRATCH MARKS ON ORMOND IDENTIFIABLE AT ALL? I CANNOT SEE THEM AT ALL, EVEN WHEN ALL THAT STUPID GRASS ISN'T IN THE WAY
---
I mean I guess but the boost would immediately end upon a survivor being right-clicked.
---
You were talking in a way that made me think that you meant the animation because the post is about it 
---
both of them died at least :)
---
Two words: The Legion
---
Freddy doesn't have any personality in DBD because they use his remake adaption which is way more "serious" than the originals. He's a lot more subdued in the remake. 
---
Good
---
Lol my bad didn't realize you where joking
---
that would be good as well. i’d definitely contact the devs with those ideas tho cause they’re not too bad (even though we know they wouldn’t implement them) but it’s always worth a shot 
---
Dbd community at its finest, but be careful what you say on PS4 messaging cursing is against their policies so you can get banned by that if they report you.
---
Same issue. Barely been able to get into a game since the patch. Having severe issues as killer too. I submitted a ticket to DBD support, I suggest others do too. It's unplayable for me in the current state.
---
Ahhhh, it's super cute &gt;∆&lt;
---
I love this.
---
Yeah I know I’ve been warned before but I think the frustration came over me 
---
Good end game. Piggy is perfect for end game builds, always fun 
---
Yea that too, I personally love being chased by hag and blindly run into traps so I can have some fun and try juking her teleports and playing mind games with her. The only hag I'm deathly afraid of though is the Make Your Choice/Devour Hope Hag with Mint Rag/Shackles. The game is done from the start unless you're a master at making her chase you all game.
---
now remembering the speed of hillbilly, 230% would prob be disorientingly fast. Ill change it.
---
Lithe has nothing to do with the killers terror radius though
---
Maybe you medium vaulted instead of fast vaulted
---
And as people have been saying, there is no counterplay to legion in chases. You know this full well of course but I suppose you’d rather try to start fights over something so pointless.
---
Is that a billy I see in the shadows?  Trappy Boi needs a friend.
---
He is powerful in low ranked games because of his mechanics, such as being invisible to survivors in their waking state and his built in aura tracking while survivors are asleep. 
---
In higher level play his power becomes a detriment, as it offers no benefits in killing or chasing survivors and only makes chases longer. It also makes it harder to punish unsafe unhooks because the tunneled survivor must be put back to sleep.
---
The problem with Freddy is if you don’t know how to fight him then you’re going to lose, but if you do then you’re going to win. 
---
They just need to rework him since he’s unbalanced against new players but horribly underpowered against experienced players. Not to mention he isn’t that fun to fight, although I enjoy playing him some.
---
BETTER YET THEY NEED TO STOP ADDING NEW SHIT UNTIL THEY ADDRESS THE MULTITUDE OF ISSUES ALREADY PRESENT IN THE GAME, ESPECIALLY IF THE NEW SHIT IS GOING TO ALL BE AS HALF-ASSED AS LEGION
---
Medium vaults still affect it. The only unaffected vault is the slow one 
---
Adam is fucking drenched in blood and Jeff looks like he sneezed red paint 
---
Ha ha ha, Im definitely not a sock puppet acct! This guy is the Duke of Jukes! LAMOROFL
---
Ah good to know
---
Still not sure why op thinks terror radius effects it 
---
I know right? I’ve never used these perks together but I’ve been having a blast doing it all day. And it gets so much hate from these white knight keyboard warriors in here. 
---
Explain to me how them knowing that is going to change the outcome of a game that is 90% over.. I mean really?
---
"He has a mori you have to avoid him HARDER bro!"
---
"He has Blood Warden do NOT give him that free hook you were going to give him for some reason!"
---
You see what I mean? I think people made too big a deal about knowing the killers loadout in general. I'm done here.
---
I’m not a very good bubba but what I’ve learned is that once you see a survivor is coming to unhook someone, rev up your chainsaw and go for them. They usually end up following through with the save as long as you’re at a far enough distance. This means that once you catch up to them(hopefully they’ll just be getting out of the save animation) you can use your chainsaw and get them both. 
---
Is this a parody of another picture? The pose and layout seem so familiar
---
lol when clementine covered herself in walker's blood this ep, i thought to myself "finally, i've prestiged my clem"
---
That was only a 60 second clip lmao. Fuck you mean still 5 gens lol
---
Fucking juke him are you kidding? I see people juking legions all the time. Use sprint bursts wisely to outrun him, same with balanced and lithe. It’s not hard 
---
U gay
---
...
---
its like sandy hook and 9/11 all over again
---
I totally get where you're coming from but these changes would be impossible to notice for people who are already bad at chases. Maybe the Exposed change would make this less new-player friendly but changes 1 and 3 i feel are just overall good changes with no downsides. 
---
Us console plebs can’t rotate killers in shop or menu screen. rip
---
If you don't think you can play around noed or blood warden then youre absolutely done here because you clearly have no fucking idea what you're talking about.
---
Dude what? Solo players on dbd are the most selfish and incompetent assholes you’ll ever meet. If they ever do message, it’s only to send hate. The new change isn’t always how it should’ve been because it was never an issue until swf was introduced. Did killers complain about solo players seeing their perks back when swf wasn’t there? 
---
The lullaby for the dark chapter is free
---
The Lullaby for the Dark was a free expansion for all platforms, you just have to “purchase” it on the store first.
---
Yup! In fact, this works even if you aren't shining it in their face! You can do the same with the nurse while she's readying a blink, too! ...Or was it when she was blinking? Meh.
---
Lol, how did I never know this? 🤦🏼‍♂️
---
Because on Xbox you get a lot of people who party up with other solo survivors in their lobby. Pretty much with Xbox every lobby I assume are on coms because it’s so easy to do. 
---
I’ve never once seen someone do this or done it myself so I can’t help but find that somewhat bullshit but I guess you aren’t wrong. 
---
What Happened? We're they lag switching?
---
What? when did I say I had to use another perk to complement it? I said I use both because I enjoy the mind games and gameplay as such. 
---
It's bad gameplay to use 2 perks that rely on each other unless it's say Spirit Fury/Enduring for example.
---
It's not required to run any of my perks. I just stated why I run them and am being downvoted yet my explanation 2 comments down is being upvoted.
---
Check out Fungoose on Twitch. He runs similar builds and I learn a lot of my information from him. I'd maybe switch out one of them for Adrenaline but generally, I can run every match with these perks with zero issue.
---
😉😁
---
Urban Evasion is actually not that good if you're decent at evading. I stopped using that after maybe 50 hours played. I'm now at 500 hours played.
---
Iron Will makes evading a cake walk.
---
Yes they did and they still do , "just because most don't" isn't a an absolute they can't. As long as that possibility exists it will NEVER show them again. You can disagree all you want but I think its clear where the majority lie. If its that important to you open a youtube video and wait until the match is over.
---
Iirc it's readying blink because you just won't do it mid blink.
---
He did excellent. And later in the challenge it ended up highlighting how quickly gens can be done, even if you’re performing well. And what survivors say are crutch perks, ie hex:ruin, can almost be mandatory for some games. 
---
Thanks, I love it
---
Not true. 4 solo players can easily party up on console. I get party invites non stop when I’m playing solo on Xbox. 
---
I'm pretty sure in that add ons case (and only in that case) it won't start a chase until the wraith actually hits someone with the surprise attack, in order to prevent people from hearing chase music before the heartbeat appears. Hearing chase music would kind of remove the point of not being able to hear the wraith, therefore, a chase is prevented from initiating.  
---
No offense but why are people calling you a god? I mean you played well, but you’re not a god
---
The title's just for aesthetic purposes as I'm planning to make a collection of pics 😅
---
YEAH, BUT IT'D STILL BE NICE TO BE UPDATED AS TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH HIM THUS FAR. SO FAR IT'S BEEN VAGUE HINTS AND STUFF THAT THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WITH YET.
---
Would it be better if you dumped buckets of blood on the Entitys spider legs and then an object popped out of it's portal hole?
---
You disgust me.
---
No, you want want to make an OPAF killer. you need more practice bud. 
---
This wouldve been funny if it was a crap perk instead of enduring.
---
Um, no. I was responding to someone else, I didn't make a comment of my own on this post.
---
This is joke right?
---
I agree with Captaincastle, you have no idea wtf you're talking about if you don't think SWF can play around Blood Warden or NOED.
---
Sorry if I’m misinterpreting your comment, but if you’re trying to study the jungle gyms of each map, they randomly change every game 
---
YEAH!
---
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
---
High school still means she's a minor, and I dunno about you, but I'd rather be friends with a serial killer than a pedophile...

Prestige really doesn't mean anything. I've p3'd people simply because they look badass covered in blood, doesn't mean I play them regularly or even at all.

Woah, thanks for the platinum!!! And I'm sorry if I made her too skinny/funny face, etc. I just wanted to add some tiny horror details in my art style. 😅 I'm planning to draw some others too, I hope you enjoy my drawings!
---
Ik exactly what you're saying. And it's not only perks, its add ons and offerings too. I'd prefer it to not be this way, and you simply dont care. Idk why you continue to argue your preference lol.  
---
Means you have time in the game...
---
Unpopular opinion: this Legion hysteria is immensely overblown.
---
You dont really have to guess unless the survivor mindgames you. Often I can tell because they start struggling the second I pick them up.
---
Moonwalk at survivors with this skin on and they won't even move

GAME STILL HAS UP TO A 50% CHANCE OF FREEZING / CRASHING ON LOADING SCREEN,

DEVS ADD MORE EXPENSIVE OUTFITS.

Hold on to your diapers babies!

Huntress is free xDdD
---
Thanks I tried really hard, I Made 2 killers previously and everyone hated it so I tried a again, I'm going to make a new survivor to this pack as Gerald Isaac so yeah I'll keep you updated
---
Sounds good 
---
I once had a survivor message me where the last one was because they didnt help. It happens more than you think.
---
This!
---
Had the same drama yesterday, killer DC’d once all Hex were cleansed (full Hex build btw) 
---
Lost my party streamers and so did my brother playing. It was benefiting everyone in game. Killer also burnt a survivor pudding so they were going to clean up lol
---
There is currently a bug where if you get hooked in the basement you teleport back in when you run out. I'm not sure if it's connected to maps or character or a combination of both. But it's a bug, not lag
---
Thank you brave knight for protecting this post. Thanks for actually responding well to their arguments. Even when they say stuff like "Well ur just bad". Or, "well actually thats op just cuz no". I honestly don't think I could respond to all of this. I honestly didn't realize people think leatherface is a good killer. 
---
I should have recorded a match I had last night using Plunderers. Two pink/red maps, a mechanics tool box and a purple flash light. All in one game.
---
Using prestige as any measure of skill by the way...
---
Wow
---
Actually it’s when you KILL one the rest DC
---
Stream lana for clear skin!!
---
Shadows give more accurate localization and has a 48 meter range IIRC. But useless in The Game map, and crouching stops the crows. But doing a generator alerts the crows so Spies is pretty good.
---
I’m a pretty open-minded guy, but I’m pretty firm on my “You must be 18 or older to ride Space Mountain” rule.

You aren’t missing much.

I bought it in the shrine a while back for my meg. I had her level 35 when I got it from the shrine. Took me to prestige 2 level 42 to see it in my blood wed.

---
It’s funny, I was named by a nun. I can only imagine what she is thinking watching on my ass right now from heaven.
---
Don't like helping people huh? 
---
It's because the offerings are "burned"/used in the loading screen. Items and add ons stay equipped because they're not used up or dropped, they didn't use to though. Maybe dedicated servers will be able to fix this?
---
See I think you believe that I'm saying LF should have infinite no cooldown saw that doesn't stop unless he hits a wall.
---
I'm not saying that at all. My idea is a perfectly fine buff to his saw that maintains his defensive kit as well as allowing him to use it in loops to gain a possible chance of a sneaked down or force a pallet drop.
---
He'd be no different to HillBilly in a chase ideally.
---
Use no perks no add ons against rank 1 survivors all using tier 3 perks and bringing items with add ons on them. Hes setting himself up for failure. Does true not realize this game is so imbalanced because of how many maps suck for killer? And everytime theres a map favored for killers everyone whines and it gets nerfed like the Game.
---
Lol
---
The legion was stupid for not destroying the pallets 
---
Yeah it’s way too much at 48 meters. 
---
Perk is only good on console because killers cant see anything on console
---
As much as you want... You get a bonus amount for the more you spend. Not really a question you need to ask reddit
---
Ruin, BBQ, Spirit Fury + Enduring.
---
Add-ons: Reduced charge, cooldown or increased acceleration.
---
Yeah I think he was kinda set on just using his ability and vaulting over them but he was kinda bad at tracking so it backfired a bit.
---
You can buy two of them with ingame currency

https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aiyeij/its_true/eet6m13/
---
Did you just contradict yourself? 
---
Urban Evasion isn't that great unless I'm trying to slow walk around short loops. That works very rarely and in very very specific situations. You can literally tree loop someone even easier since they expect you to be by the pallet loop. Any non brain dead killer will just check you once they realize your running it.(I do anyway but I'm only rank 12 killer so imagine what happens at rank 1)
---
Like I said, I noticed the limitations of Urban Evasion 450 hours ago and It doesn't benefit my play style.
---
“Uses no perks on Legion on Swamp” 
---
“Applies no map pressure.”
---
‘Wow, getting gen rushed’

Top-fucking-kek

Nope. No numbers were appearing.

NO good sir you can just hold A/X on her and move your joystick it will rotate her

None or the $100 one.

skill check for a health level
---
I took a hiatus from this game. Went from rank 3 survivor to rank 17. Killer had ruin 3, and my dumbass forgot these low ranks don’t know how to mindgame, so I screwed myself. Sitting on a hook, ALL OF THEM ON GENS UNTIL I DIE FIRST HOOK. I’m just wondering how the killer didn’t find one of them.
---
20$ pack is about 112.5 per dollar, 35$ pack is 115 per dollar so it is a better deal.
---
EW MISELLE
---
A bit unrelated but in light of what happened to Friday the 13th isn't it likely that Jason can be a new DBD killer? I am just getting back into the game and remember people talking about this a while ago.
---
Nope. They combine well and they aren't redundant, unlike running Dead Hard with another exhaustion perk. I have 772 hours and Urban Evasion is still great for me.
---
The overreaction doesn't come off as genuine, it comes off as parroting what some streamer or youtuber said.  The only positive about Legion from a killer's perspective is that he can down anyone he sets his mind to in the generator repair phase of the game.  He suffers horribly when you genrush him to oblivion and you can still waste his power on a pallet slam if you guess right. 
---
So many people say shit like "no counterplay" but offer no way of fixing it.  "Rework" his power?  How?  What do you change?  Is what's fun for a survivor still fun for the killer controlling them?  He's still a killer that has to hit you baseline four times to achieve a down, each hit causing a mini-sprint burst for the survivor and immediately draining his power gauge which he then has to wait to build back up.  He follows your blood trail and waits for the chase to break but is still wasting time which is the killer's number one enemy in DBD.  
---
So many people need to actually offer some solution instead of being an echo chamber with no ideas to contribute.  Then as a community you choose one of those ideas and push it hard to developers.  Making ten minute videos and repeating what those videos say about how Legion is awful because no counterplay doesn't do shit.  "Hey BHVR, your killer sucks" is not the same as "Hey BHVR, your killer sucks but many people have come together to agree this would be better, take a look." 
---
This is great lol this is a bloodwarden user’s dream 😂😂😂
---
Throwing a pebble should not give you points. There is 0 skill required and it does nothing for the team.
---
Fat
---
It has to do with chases, which factors in the terror radius. 
---
If a wraith keeps uncloaking he will have no terror radius, therefore the game won't consider it a chase even though he's clearly chasing you. 
---
Shoulda said gg spirit thicc
---
There are plenty of perks that take 0 skill and do nothing for the team. If there is a score event called “Distraction” you would think the perk called Diversion would give you points for that. Just makes sense. 
---
None until you feel they earned your money.
---
I blame fov
---
Legion is impossible to loop when he’s in frenzy mode
---
Name some of these perks.
---
Bamboozle.
---
I think it's to easily change the characters outfit
---
Sprint burst, Dead hard, balanced landing, urban evasion, Adrenaline, Boil Over, dance with me, windows of opportunity, you get my point. 
---
As do Dead Hard and Balanced Landing. Have you tried it? I assume not.
---
Like I said originally, I personally run these perks because it gives me the highest level of success unlike many other combinations. I recommend Urban Evasion to my newer friends as it helps them avoid chases. I personally love being chased so I make my build around that considering there isn't much perk combos to benefit my gen speed solo. Iron Will for the escapes and retreat back to gens.
---
Being good at chases = higher chances of survival. I can avoid chases but I know how well I can loop unlike my random teammates. 
---
It's alright to try new things so I didn't think I'd get this much flak when some of the best DBD streamer(s) run similar builds. You won't learn anything otherwise.
---
Sprint burst
---
lmao salt. NOED is here to stay get over it
---
He can just swing again. He has no cooldown on his swing, and his power recharges fairly fast. "Juking" shouldn't be the go to counterplay to everything, its a last resort.
---
That’s what I thought. I’ve never had a moment before this where I said to myself “oh wait, hang on. Let me just activate bloodwarden quick.”
---
I mean, if you can light burn a nurse in mid-blink, it should be an achievement/trophy called "Don't Blink!"
---
None of those grant points....
---
DOC ABOUT TO COME AROUND THAT CORNER LIKE JOHN PILGRIM TALKING ABOUT "DO YOU THANK OUR LORD AND SAVIOR FOR YOUR ABILITY TO WORK ON THAT GENERATOR AGENT PARK?"
---
Just think of it as giving you options on whether you want to tunnel or not /s
---
Yes, because they don’t really have a category they fit in. I’m just saying it makes sense. 
---
Hey man, you forgot to log onto one of your alt accounts before posting
---
Evasion.
---
Can't help it. Yesterday, I went against a swf who used 4 DS, 4 adrenaline, borrowed time. Didn't even get a single kill. Life's hard as a killer. 
---
&lt;Machete
---
&lt;Mask that shows eyes
---
&lt;uses bear traps
---
&lt;super attached to a parent
---
What do Legion add on because of stack mean? Where be do the survivor map in fog haha.
---
if I know they're going to do this, I'll just go afk in a corner somewhere and waste their time
---
R.I.P. well at least I have 3/4 things you recommend
---
Throws pebble, 500 points in the brutally category for leading killer to invisible Claudette
---
Are you this bired?
---
Figure out how many Auric Cells you need in order to buy everything you want from the store, and buy the pack that will give you enough to do that lol..
---
That's why he played only as Nurse in the end and still wrecked the swfs at rank 2 without perks. Only Nurse can do it though.
---
There isn’t a score event called Evasion though. If they add one, then yes that’d be fine with me. Any way to give survivors more BP is nice. 
---
IT ALWAYS BAFFLES ME THAT PEOPLE LEAVE YOU ON THE HOOK WHEN ITS THE EASIEST WAY TO PIP GETTING SAFE UNHOOKS AND DOING A GEN OR TWO THAT WAY IF YOU GET CHASED A DECENT AMOUNT ITS AN EASY PIP/SAFETY AND I JUST CAME FROM THE RAGE THREAD AND FORGOT MY CAPS LOCK BUT ITS TOO LATE NOW.
---
&gt;I HATE IT WHEN THE OBSESSIONS I TUNNEL DON'T POUR ME ENOUGH SALT!
---
Why? Discordance is great to prevent gen rush right? 
---
I mean I hate face camping too but if all gens are done and a gate is open, I can’t blame the killer for camping since at that point it’s the only way they can “secure the kill”.
---
/s
---
Oopsie-poopsie. Looks like you dropped this.
---
how is the ability trash?
---
THIS IS WHAT BOTHERS ME TOO!
---
I have a few builds I do regularly in red ranks, most of them are about chases and being annoying, but if I am below rank 3 I run Kindred.
---
With aftercare, kindred, and lightweight, I can force my team to look at me, and not let me die alone in one hook.
---
I miss revealing players that hide in lockers with kindred. 
---
YEEHAW
---
They were abusing a bug which allows them to indefinitely spam dead hard
---
Get close, don’t swing, bait the dead hard the hit after they dead hard. The most they could do is a dead hard every 40 seconds and that’s only if it’s tier 3 dead hard and they walk/stay still without being chased for 40 seconds. 
---
WHOEVER WAS JUST PLAYING DAVID ON PS4 VERSING MYERS ON THAT FARM LEVEL FUCK YOU. I WAS GETTING PICKED UP BY A LOVELY CLAUDETTE 2 SECONDS AWAY FROM BEING RECOVERED AND THEN THERES YOU BEING CHASED A FAIR DISTANCE AWAY BUT THEN ONCE YOU NOTICED US LIKE AN ABSOLUTE PUSSY YOU COME RUNNING RIGHT UP TO US AND GET BOTH OF US KILLED AND YOU ESCAPE WITHOUT HARM. REEEEEEEEE
---
Damn. That sucks
---
Sad. I didn't know that they were cheating..

I'VE ONLY BEEN PLAYING KILLER FOR A WEEK. I HAVE TWO KILLERS WHO ARE LEVEL 20 AND NEITHER OF THEM ARE THE HAG. JUST GONNA SUFFER FOREVER NBD.
---
Pig wasn't *bad*, per se, but certainly wasn't the best they could be. The crouch change was sorely needed, Combat Straps were basically a must use before to get any effective use out of crouching. And Surveillance was shit. Now Combat Straps are nice but not required and Surveillance is useful. The TR changes just balance out the new crouch speeds.
---
yup the meg even sat there waiting for me to chase her 
---
THE LAG IS REAL.
---
LOADING SCREEN HANGS ARE REAL.
---
MAKING OUTFITS IS IMPORTANT.
---
i thought they were lagging at first but by the time i was chasing the kate like that *a second time* i noticed the constant dead hard animations
---
I thought about it, but I figure I’ll save shards for any abilities on characters I haven’t unlocked.
---
I really would like a “killer verses killer” mode
---
Yeah of course because Nurse breaks the chase mechanic of this game and puts it in the killers hand. Hes gonna need one huge advantage to counteract the huge disadvantages he gave himself. The point of add ons and perks is that they’re balanced because both sides can use them or they’re rare and expensive. When one side doesnt use them and the other side does then of course the side that uses it has the upper hand.
---
And no matter what if you get the Asylum map and you arent Nurse there isnt much you can do. The problem with DBD isnt lack of objectives or how fast gens get completed its the fact that the maps suck.
---
That's actually a very good point!
---
WOOOOOO!
---
thanks
---
I run Kindred for this very reason. 
---
It's fine, but it's like something you equip until you get whispers 3 and never uses again after that.
---
I GUESS THE PURPOSE IS TO SAVE TIME BUT IN ALL FAIRNESS IF KILLERS CAN SLUG AND WAIT FOR A BLEED OUT, THEY CAN WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO FINISH STRUGGLING OR AT LEAST GIVE THE PLAYER THAT DIDN’T GET HOOKED THE ENTIRE MATCH A CHANCE TO KOBE.
---
The best is when your team works together and trades spots on the hook just before you hit the struggle stage. Camper sits there and stares at a person on the hook not struggling. Then you get exit gates open, cleanse his NOED, then go on your merry way when someone hopefully has borrowed time. Those games are rare but so satisfying. 
---
That wasn't sass. That was Pearl being denser than Roxxxy Andrew's midriff in a corset.

Here goes another survivor trying to mock a killer. I want to see OP get fucked by a survivor when they play as killer. That's the only way survivor mains will shut the fuck up.
---
I was assuming the animation would have some first person equivalent, like you see them rear back for the strike or something.
---
Nah I was messaging him saying oopsies
---
well if your above 10+ rank they might be afk for many reasons, the the general consensus is just to de rank.
---
but you never know it could be someone with end game perks and just instant downs everyone  when you stand in front of him/her trying to get chase points
---
dont worry once you run into purple and below you will run into more "active" killers LOL
---
You shouldnt feel bad at all what a trash survivor

Bloodhound/sloppy butcher doesn't seem good on Spirit because she can't see blood trails while in her phase walk unless she has one of her ultra-rare add-ons.

congrats, now you just have to wait till march for the new dlc \^\_\^

He literally is. Check the accounts complimenting him. Both left two separate responses and type the same way. Most sad/ bizarre thing I’ve seen rofl 
---
Yeah, I just throw on unbreakable instead these days.
---
In order to get the perfect 32K you MUST 3 hooked EVERYONE! You can't have anyone, anyone(!), die by 1-2 hooks and everyone has to be saved before they reach another stage. If you don't a total of 12 hookings for that game you will never get the 8K max.
---
To be at 7.9K that means you only landed 11 out of the 12 hooks of that game. Maybe someone wasn't saved fast enough, maybe you only 2 hooked the final Survivor at the end, maybe someone DCed, but something stopped you from getting a total of 12 hooks. Trust me, that will happen a LOT! Im well into the double digits of failed perfect game thanks to not getting that 12th hook. Been playing off/on since the game launched on PC and have never earned a perfect game to this date.
---
It's as simple as that and it's why perfect games are so rare for Killers. Landing all 12 hooks in a single game is a fucking monster of a challenge. 
---

---
sad that the don't have the Task Manager to shutdown deadbydaylight.exe
---
we'll have a nice warm meat hook waiting for you when you return!
---
Is this on ps4 too? I havent played in a while and i main the spirit
---
I mean it does air on TruTv
---
Eh? This sub seems crazy sometimes. I play with friends and none of us care about our rank or if we lose. Most people don’t take this game THAT seriously since it’s barely competitive. You want to ban people playing together?! That’d kill the game instantly lol. Literally the only appeal for a shit tonne of people is that they can play this with their friends and have a good time. 
---
Bots I believe. They just stand there and swing.
---
Just got off the phone with everyone you’ve ever been to a party with, they said you’re a BLAST to have around 
---
Since when tho, like it's not a petty since when it's actually like, since when
---
There's no Doctor playing though.
---
[this right here] (https://www.twitch.tv/portland18/clip/TiredWealthyHawkFeelsBadMan?filter=clips&amp;range=all&amp;sort=time)
---
Yes.
---
That’s hilarious. 
---
You’re getting way too extreme with these posts now.  Be mellow man. Play the game, or don’t.. But we’re all feeling it.  And yes, to show concern is great and all but we have to take it day by day... 
---
Because they’re working on it!  Not enough people play on console.  FPS is off.  You can’t just expect to have a God tier game like this over night.  Relax.  It’s all going to be okay. 
---
\*Sigh\* here comes the rule 34. 
---
No video. But one time against Pig at Coldwind. I had decisive but I wasn't the obsession. I had the RBT on and she was chasing me. All five gens done. Exit gates open. I got to the exit gates but I knew I couldn't leave. So I stay there and she downs me. Carries me to a hook near the exit gates. I wiggle to 35% when she's a step or two away from hooking me. I hit the decisive. Hatch opens up at this exact moment about ten meters away from the hook. I jump in and escape. Was my most crazy escape I've ever had.
---
Killer has priorities 
---
No problem.
---
No but look at this cool new skin that serves no purpose!
---
I've had 3 perfects, and several that have fallen a few hundred short. This is the first time it's been only 100 BP. Maybe the last guy was only on their second, I dunno. Should have saved the game. Oh well. 
---
I am taking it day by day and I an relaxed. I'm not asking for this to be fixed over night, I'm asking for this to be addressed because the Dev's have never publicly talked about this issue.
---
Perk 1: This'll proc real quick if it's off two injured. It's really strong for SwF, not so hot Solo.
---
Perk 2: Does this include when you're holding it at full, or just while it's filling? Either way, SwF groups can drag the game out super easy with this. Just pair it with No Mither (And/Or Unbreakable) on 4 people and crawl away from eachother when the killer isn't standing above you. Run it with Adrenaline and the game is over.
---
Perk 3: I honestly don't know when you'd want to run this one, since getting more skill-checks means getting the gen done faster. You only need 2 gens done for the hatch, so it's somehow a WORSE left behind.
---
Good tries, though. Keep at it.
---
Your skin is pretty good at doing its job. You'll be fine walking barefoot.
---
THAT’S BULLSHIT, THERE’S FOOTAGE OF KILLERS GETTING BULLSHIT KNOCKDOWNS ALL OVER THE INTERNET. IF DON’T BELIEVE HITBOXES ARE WACK THEN YOU YOURSELF ARE WACK
---
Somebody get on it
---
PLAY CLAUDETTE
---
"Over night."  
---
Lol what about a year and a half?   
---
Console sales arent exactly low, either.  Huge asian fan base on PS4 uf you havent been keeping up, which I think is fairly safe to assume.   
---
Wondering if you, or anyone over at BVHR has ever heard of a hotfix, because they don't even implement those on PC.  It's like they work 1 day a week while employing artists to bring in the money through AN (oh I can't wait to use this) "OVER-SATURATED" MARKET OF SKINS
---
Me if they die instantly 
---
With most lunges being almost a meter or longer depending on who the killer is you won’t notice the change unless you’re significantly faster than normal running speed. Like if you vault twice in a row with Lithe or Sprint Burst into a vault then you’ll clearly see it but otherwise there’s not much difference in the majority of post vault hits but if you Lithe away from a killer you should be evading those specific hits a little better. I don’t think it’s gonna bring about any sort of return of the infinite loop. 
---
There's always been crashes, but not like this. I should be able to play for 2 hours without any crashes. Unfortunately that's not the case.
---
Honestly after rank 12 is when I noticed more killers that are actually playing 
---
BITCH I ***LIVE***
---
Edit: ***DIE***
---
And the fact that it is counter by running calm spirit or the survivors being rather careful to not alert crows.
---
WHY DO YOU STAND ON THE HATCH WAITING FOR ME TO SEE YOU JUST TO RUB IT IN OR SOMETHING!? THEN YOU TBAG?
---
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS FUNNIER? WHEN I STILL MANAGE TO GRAB YOU OUT OF IT AND THEN YOU DC WHEN YOU SEE ME BRING YOU TO A HOOK! 
---
BRUH YOU COULD HAVE JUST JUMPED LONG AGO. IF YOU ESCAPE AND THERE'S STILL A GEN UNDONE I KNOW YOU GOT THE HATCH. WHAT'S THE POINT??
---
BUT SERIOUSLY YOU CAN'T EVEN HANDLE ME GRABBING YOU OUT OF IT. NORMALLY I WOULD JUST GIVE THE LAST SURVIVOR THE HATCH IN A GOOD MATCH BUT IF YOU'RE JUST GONNA STAND ON IT AND TBAG MAYBE EXCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES WHEN YOU FUCK UP.

I mean, he was 100% done with Ru's shit and tbh I didn't blame him. The balls on that guy
---
Thanks for saying so, respect. Ya it would be cool if more people bothered to send pms like "you played very well gg" or whatever but most people probably not gonna feel like putting effort into sending a message like that after a loss. I do see a bunch of messages like that on PC post-game chat though, more than I see toxic messages even.
---
Mobile user here. How much do platinums costs?
---
I rebinded mine to M4 button, if that helps
---
Don't these "modern consoles" have a means of recording? Why do I have to watch a recording of a TV?
---
Meh, maybe next generation they can finally get it right.
---
The issue is that the killer is so broken from the ground up that it's difficult for people to properly realise why they hate it, or just to express that.
---
From the survivor side, Legion is unfun to go against. If they use their power "as intended" you either spend all game injured, or just drag the entire game out by holding M1 to heal which gets you nowhere and feels boring to play.
---
When they're in a chase with you, there's very little you can do to escape the chase. Skills people have developed have become completely useless. You're put on a timer, so looping is redundant, and if you can run well and juke killers, it usually doesn't matter because most use bloodhound and prevent you mending, so again you go down on a timer regardless of skill.
---
If they exploit moonwalking, the issue is exacerbated, again, bloodhound means you go down no matter how good of a player you are.
---
If they use "OP" add ons like Frank's Mixtape, the power becomes so potent that  you go down incredibly quickly even without cheese. They basically put in 15 different limits on the power to stop it being a really fast 2 hit down, then essentially made this add on that, as the first follow up hit is all but guaranteed.
---
From the killer perspective you basically have 3 options.
---
1. You play 'as intended.' You injure a lot of people, you stun yourself 4 or 5 times per chase and maybe one or two people die in a game if you're lucky.
---
2. You use exploits like moonwalking. Some may find this fun, but personally I want to play the game not just abuse something so cheap so that the other team just dies.
---
3. You use really strong add ons. The game becomes incredibly easy, and the skill of the survivors basically doesn't matter, you just steamroll them.
---
Trying to fundamentally rewrite the rules of chasing has made the killer broken. A combination of overpowered and underpowered that isn't a lot of fun to play because it's either too slow to do anything, or too strong to feel rewarding, but always unfun to play against because you're basically guaranteed to go down unless the killer player is incompetent.
---
XXXXXDXDDXDXXXDXDXDDDD 
---
Nurse is largely muscle memory. Playing with add ons largely messes with that. She really doesn't need them either so you're not losing out not using them.
---
6$ a platinum
---
Daaaamn
---
No blink nurse op
---
Probably a frustrated host. I got three in a row tonight, two halfway when they realized after four gens and no hook that they’d hardly be making points. The other as fast as the last gen was done. 
---
As my rank improves, the killers wise up and drop the survivor if someone drops their hook during them transporting someone from the ground to said hook that is now also on said ground. I dont see it a lot until rank reset, then it gets less common again... Repeeeaat
---
(Psst, hey. You, yeah you. Urban is overrated)
---
And that’s part of the problem. Dropping people will still there we go meter, but they can basically leave that person there until the hook comes back.
---
Especially against Michael Myers
---
I bet that lags the fuck out of console lobbies 
---
Did this the other day with the pig(minus noed) and went from 0 kills to 3 sacrifices. Endgame piggy ftw
---
It's seconds refunded to the killer. Seconds that aren't lost by survivors spawning next to ruin totem.
---
Like I said to the other guy, its still 4 seconds that aren't reliant on a totem.
---
...he didn't get a crow until she had him blocked in there for awhile
---
or were you being sarcastic
---
A skinny person can be more skilled with a knife than a MMA pro. So, your logic is so bad . I am not talking about size here.  I am talking about how the costume looks comical.
---
*happy Waluigi sounds*
---
This honestly makes me want to put in the time and effort to learn how to play her properly. I’m mainly survivor based and I am horrible at killer. But may buy her soon and give her a go and try to learn! I know she’s considered one of the harder killers to play so I’m sure I have my work cut out for me, haha. 
---
I had a guy do this to me and the killer wasn't even camping...I was a little bitter so I made sure to struggle and thankfully the killer found him before I died. The killer and I had a good laugh about it since it was my first and only time being hooked that game and I had saved him twice!
---
Yes
---
It's a build that will get you on my list of campers. I would give it a 0/10.
---
Sure you did
---
Thank you, sry for being a fucking tree btw
---
Woodchucks can throw 23 pieces of wood wothout getting tired
---
What.
---
I said you must really want this ban because he repost idiot smh. You 'surface level people' are betas 
---
No vid but I was at autosave wreckers. I was getting tailed by a toe 3 Myers and was rushing to the door as nea. As I passed through the destroyed bus, I crouched in the space where the driver seat was. I felt like an idiot as Myers took a stab and I trappedyself in there. The Myers missed his and then walked the other way. I didn't know if it was sheer dumb luck, a miracle or something happening at his end, but I just ran out the gate without looking back.
---
yeah you can, but for real its just that one odd match, i usually say fuck it and move on
---
Yeah as old mate said I only got the crow because they trapped me, and even so, it’s a weird way to get back at someone for being idle by trapping them causing them to be ... idle
---
Not as bired as the dude who made alt accounts to stroke his ego and give himself imaginary internet points.
---
basement builds are about to be op?  
---
Darn
---
seems like a good yellow/white rank build. not so much once you hit purple/red. if it gets you kills and thrills go for it 
---
Oh. Looks like whenever i play killer im boosted
---
That’s why I love bbq and Chili. I’m literally here for bloodpoints and stacks. For me a game winner is getting 4 stacks and doing whatever earns points afterwards. That’s why I love Legion so much cause I can just hit one person and go “you’re not my 4th person, where are they” everything after is more Chili. 
---
If it’s double BP or I have WGLF, I make them wait for me to take my sweet time struggling. 
---
Why wouldn't you? That's the question.
---
TO THE KATE DENSON THAT T BAGGED ME WHILE I WAS ON THE GROUND INSTEAD OF HEALING ME AND LED THE KILLER TO ME 4 TIMES FUUUUUCKKKK YOU I STILL GOT OUT THANKS TO A DAVID KING 
---
You can't do it if you missed it. Don't worry. You can report from next time 👍
---
That's a bad attitude. Just report them.  Takes 5 seconds. 
---
flair name
---
I hope it all goes well. Thank you for protecting this country. See you in the fog. 
---
If you play tunnel legion I’d probably dc too. Ruins the game. There’s nothing you can do to escape.
---
Did you camp and tunnel?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hushOcyUWo
---
It's not nothing, but it's also not much. "Gen rushing" will now just be everyone on a separate gen until maybe the last one or two.
---
I can't wait for the new killer Connor, or rather The Android, to come to the game. He's going to be game breaking with his tracking skills.
---
Ooooh okay! I was a little confused for a moment. My bad. 
---
If im not already in my swf group i usually get a party invite in the pregame lobby
---
boosted in general (across all games) just means being a higher rank/having something good without you actually deserving it. so that could mean you either partner with a better player to "boost" you or abuse a games mechanic, or use op items, etc.
---
And what about punishing unsafe altruism? If you hook someone and couldnt count to five before the unhook would you just ignore the person who’s injured or go for the other person, assuming they’re healthy and not injured as well? Or would you just do both, down the survivor and chase the healthy one? I’m curious about your habits. 
---
Was the tea bag necessary, cunt?
---
You are very rude jeez!
---
[Hank, please.](https://i.imgur.com/YlLoQzW.png)
---
Haha that’s fair enough!
---
I have 4000 hours and people who run Urban are noobs who should be mocked.
---
i’ve never seen anyone get banned for it though, i play on pc 
---
It’s also very common on psn to get a party invite when playing solo.  I never accept because if I’m playing survivor it probably means I’m listening to a podcast or something and don’t wanna talk to random people, but not being in the same SWF  doesn’t mean they didn’t all party up in the lobby.
---
AGREED, NEA BLEETS INTO MY EAR HER SWEET GOAT MEWLINGS EVERY TIME I HIT HER. SUPERIOR FOR REMINDING ME OF THE GAME I'M HUNTING
---
WHY IS FREDDY SO OP 
---
Really, that was all on me. Lol
---
Heart the heartbeat? 
---
You get that if my buddy dies with 2 gens left knowing the killer does or doesnt have noed is huge, right? Knowing they have blood warden will be the matter of escape vs not if im opening the gates while my friend is being chased. 
---
You didnt even consider someone dying early, did you? You genuinely just thought it only came up when the gates are open and they're all escaping, right? Wow bud.
---
I get that she shouldnt have tbagged but calling someone a cunt doesnt help anything and is just rude
---
Story of the screenshot: I was the killer, and this 2 man survive with friends team wanted to be toxic and flashlight click and tbag and so on. So I bm'ed the Hell outta them and they dc'ed. :)
---
Oh ok my mistake
---
Doesn't mean you shouldn't report. We can do our job. It's up to the devs to do theirs.

I don't get the reference but im sure somebody will so upvote for you
---
True but still it felt nice and I’m happy about so there. 
---
the clip itself had me laughin' but (presumably) your laugh had me in tears. i love this post
---
I'm not sure on how strong spies will be, just because some maps have way less crows than others. It's certainly miles better than before though, and it could be ok.
---
No shit. 
---
Tbh I either can't properly use Whispers or its completely garbage. 32m area is kind of big and it doesn't help at all when it comes to vertical maps. Spies can't ever be top tier or it will be countered really easily, its great when people don't realize you got it but its useless if they play against it (and its relatively easy through perks or gameplay).
---
Being rude to someone rude is not a problem.
---
First of all. The killer didn't even see me teabag.
---
Secondly, The teabag was meant to say "ah i messed up. hit me".
---
Thirdly. You need to calm the hell down. You entirely missed the point of the clip because all you choose to focus on was me teabagging.
---
Be positive. You might find happiness.
---
Whispers is not good on the game either, its just less useless.
---
"ah, I messed up. Hit me". Sure. Totally believable.
---
Im too tired to do a traducción, would be glad if someone did. Thanks, have a good night. 
---
Well then let me shamelessly plug my Twitch stream, because I laugh a lot while playing killer and survivor equally. Twitch.tv/youhadmeatgaming
---
You didn’t have to watch anything, big guy. But I appreciate you powering through it regardless. You’re a trooper. 
---
Is it really that bad if I do that sometimes? I just dont want to throw myself at the survivor on the hook when theres a damn good chance (changes from match to match of course) the killer is just hanging around them, I would rather find the hatch and have at least 1 person escape than 0. 
---
Plus, a lot of randos have cooperated by struggling until I stop moving, then committing suicide and basically saying "ayy" in chat afterwards.
---
I would say you should change Insidious for Distressing, since in doc it's great. (Plus those juicy extra bloodpoints) 
---
I haven't played since the change, I'm just hoping they fixed the bug with crows where they fly away if you're working on a gen next to them, since that was suppose to be something they patched along time ago but since spies wasn't really a great perk no one cared it was still bugged.
---
What does it change? Just cause its a shitpost there can't be a discussion on the topic? We get the meme, everyone does, you're not special...
---
*Yes*.
---
Thanks 👏

HAD A BAD KILLER GAME AND OF COURSE THERE WAS SOME ASSHOLE WITH DS AND A FLASHLIGHT WHO I DOWNED TWICE BUT THEY GOT AWAY ONCE WITH DS AND NEVER GOT A FLASHLIGHT SAVE WHO SAYS FUCKING EZ IN THE END GAME CHAT. IT WAS A NEA. IT ISN'T ALWAYS A NEA. IT OFTEN IS. BUT IT'S JUST A NOTICEABLE PHENOMENON TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO RUN DS WITH PURPLE FLASHLIGHTS WHO ARE ASSES IN THE END GAME CHAT.

It’s really great, btw! Sorry, it feels weird to post your thing on imgur (even as an explainer) but I don’t know how else to insert images to posts. :(
---
Ghost mommy gets me every time
---
Non noobs who don't want kills th easy way won't use it. That's why you don't see pro streamers use it. 
---
Are you any better ?
---
i’m streaming her so much why isn’t my skin clearer 😭
---
*runs remember me*
---
Haha this will slow the end game down
---
*obsession opens gate*
---
woah no i haven’t yet! it works that well with drops???
---
I hit the unhooked person so the other guy doesn’t get his safe unhook, let him get picked up while I chase the other guy down, why punish the guy you’ve already hooked? Not his fault his team mates an idiot, we’ve all been farmed. I think killers that tunnel are just as bad as the farmers.
---
Oops well idk if I can change it now lol
---
HONESTLY IT DRIVES ME A LITTLE MORE CRAZY WHEN THEY DO IT AFTER PALLET DROPS WHEN THEY DIDN'T EVEN LOOP, AND THEY'RE JUST RUNNING THROUGH THE MAP LETTING ME BREAK ALL THE PALLETS. LIKE, YOU AREN'T HELPING, AND YOU CLEARLY THINK YOU'RE GOOD. AND IT'S NOT EVEN A STRATEGIC DECISION BECAUSE YOU'VE FUCKED YOURSELF IN THE FUTURE WHEN YOU NEED A PALLET.
---
Cowboy jake needs a portrait like this :D
---
Right now you’re saying there’s two leagues in this game. Pros and noobs. Which couldn’t be more wrong. One, because there’s no such thing as professional Dead by Daylight. And two, because there’s a myriad of casual players out there of all skill levels, many of which have builds that NOED fits into and they use it to have a good time. You’re apparently very ignorant, or very stupid. Just move on and find something else to cry about and let people have fun. You big jerk. 
---
Oh yeah sure. See we have a reasonable fix for a big issue thats plagued the game for both sides, which is survivors wanting something outside of holding M1 for ten years, and killers complaining that gens go too fast. 
---
And then your comment which adds nothing of value. Logical dude.
---
It's ok as long as you credit 
---
Nah she is skinny, everyone likes to think she’s thic, these boys dunno what thic is.
---
No need reporting that until we have something to report.
---
I've read the patch notes which say that there is no bonus on repairing speed. I also read the perk description which is saying that repairing speed is still a bonus. You got the problem now? No reason to get mean. 
---
Yes I did , and thanks 👏
---
Lmao
---
Dang wish you ran into the fire to see what happened (or was it you automatically running forward?)
---
Though imagine had the killer glitched too and chased you to the fire
---
[Here's a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ) on typical structures and how to run them as killers. This can also be used on survivors too so it is very useful for learning how to run certain loops
---
I would much, much rather her terror radius be smaller and just use combat straps.
---
Daaaaamn you were right 
---
Thanks Karma Santa !
---
I had already escaped unfortunately. I was spectating the guy who glitched out

---
Honestly? for a while I was thinking his inclusion was inevitable.
---
With the lawsuit basicly ending the F13 game, the development of that was now a non-factor. However, the lawsuit cannot go on forever.
---
Had the lawsuit swung in favor of Sean Cunningham, Jason's Arrival into DbD would have been swift. Sean is determined to make sure that the public never forgets who Jason is, and I've heard from at least one news source around the time of F13the game's announcement say that the developers didn't have to pay anything to use the License. 
---
Regardless, Sean Cunningham is Notorious for wanting to push Jason as hard as he can. So he would absolutly turn to DbD as a means to promote the character, and make a little money in the process.
---
Meanwhile, there is no way BHVR would turn down the Opportunity to add Jason to the game. Not only is he the #1 most recognisable Movie Killer, but ontop of that At one point F13 the game was set to be good competition for DbD (sadly, that was not meant to be)
---
Adding Jason to DbD would not just be a final nail in F13s Coffin, One could argue that's already been done. One could argue that would be BHVRs 'victory lap' as it were.
---
Of course, all this is irrelevant, as sean cunningham didn't win the lawsuit. Victor Miller won because the judge in the case dosen't understand what a contract is.
---
Do I look like your servant girl?
---
If they ever found another way to....*Slow the game down just a little bit*.... without screwing over the killer and that's more interesting then having your gen digress 5% for hitting good skill checks, I'm' all for it. 
---
Having is be stronger early game and weaker later game sounds interesting to me.
---
LOl are you kidding, Hatch gets opened in default for last sur, Tell me how are sur supposed to survive 1v1 ? (condition applied 2 gens need to be done, but hey you already mentioned someone opened the hatch which isn't possible unless 2 gens are done)
---
I’m not a great player. Never said I was, I’m just a casual player/streamer who plays for fun. But I also rarely use NOED. I just do it for fun once in a while. You need to learn how to have some fun. 
---
The other killers I think it could be done on are Spirit and Billy (and Legion obviously but thats unfair because you dont need to hook anyone).
---
No perk/addon Freddy 20 to 1 challenge gogogogogo.
---
Hmmm I thought it only stayed open for like a few seconds, the other day a Bill used one and I saw the hatch icon in game but seconds later it disappeared. If someone can answer this I’d like to know too lmao, he used a key and left the 3 of us to play the rest of the game. 
---
Unbreakable is actually useful but situational. 
---
I went afk once because the survivors were fuckin around and I had to shit. I came back to them still fuckin around. They claimed I was taking a shit for 25 minutes lol, I was gone for 10
---
THOSE MF CHAINSAW HITS WHEN YOUR WHOLE FREAKING BODY IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WINDOW ARE THE MOST INFURIATING TO ME

What did he say? 
---
BHVR SYNDROME : FIX THREE BUGS, CREATE FIVE MORE. 
---
I'm running Object of Obsession + Bond + Iron will + Balance landing because I can get the attention of the killer from others and help my teammates. Sadly, many killers will face camp you after just because you are using OoO, It's like survivors should flashlight click when killers run BBQ. But I love OoO so much, It can help in chases so much that many ppl underestimate it. Sadly, it's still bugged and doesn't work properly.
---
Yeah, I think it’s better to air on the side of just escaping.  If you’re very sure they aren’t camping or have borrowed time or something to potentially counter a camp it’s worth it, but I’ve seen way too many matches where a facecamping killer turned what should have been a 1 kill into 3 or 4 because the survivors just weren’t willing to leave.  Don’t reward facecampers with more points.
---
"I just had these 2 games where this thing happened so that must mean it's true for all games"
---
i always believed it was dependant on the key + add on to increase time duration, if its not the last survivor with at least 2 gens done in a 4v1 match 
---
NOED is pretty much mandatory on Freddy. 
---
No idea what you're talking... Also please use flairs appropriately.
---
EASING THE TRIALS FOR COLORBLINDS DOESN'T MAKE MONEY. OVERPRICED COSMETICS, ON THE OTHER HAND...
---
BUT FOR REAL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SUCH A BASIC OPTION HASN'T BEEN YET ADDED TO THE GAME. COLORBLINDNESS IS REAL AND NOT RARE AT ALL. 
---
Same thing just happened to me in a game lol.. I was super confused because I could see hatch with all four of us alive and one gen left, and then I ended up escaping through hatch while this fourth person was supposedly still in the game.. At the end we realised none of us had seen them all game and they only had 2k bloodpoints. Still not sure what happened
---
Glad to see they think about their fellow neckbeards. 
---
^This, it's insanely hard to get 8k Sacrifice points with the way its scored. (500 for the action of hooking, 200 for progressing their hook state or 700 total per hook) so outside of moris/ the Pig you have 8.4k points to earn and thats it.  
---
Spirit had a booty before she got any skins
---
You really thought her skins wouldn't have even MORE and BETTER booty? U thought
---
Whispers is still better. Spies got buffed but its not a good perk.
---
Happy Cake Day
---
Imo 1.5x or 2x bloodpoints should be default. 
---

---
I MEANT WHEN YOU FINISHED VAULTING IT DURING A CHASE, MY BAD. BUT GO ON, BE CONDESCENDING ALL YOU WANT, I'M AWARE OF THE MENTAL STATE OF THIS COMMUNITY AND JUST KEEP ON GIVING KILLER MAINS A REALLY BAD AND PRETENTIOUS IMAGE. 
---
AND FOR THE RECORD, I MOSTLY PLAY KILLER AND JUST HIT 1000 HOURS YESTERDAY, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH. 
---
Should’ve cleansed the full totems, it’s a free 600 BPs 
---
This makes no sense. Chasing out of his terror radius?
---
Man, I dreamed about video games so much during basic. Everyone was writing letters home and I was drafting up backstories for WoW characters. Got in a quick video game nut before AIT and then it was back to none. 
---
Hope you're a survivor main, because if you liked being slugged, you're gonna love the army.
---
This patch is broken
---
Thats a great idea
---
Hit me, baby, one more time!
---
I actually don't get it. Could you educate me?
---
That’s like every other survivor I play with lately lol 
---
You shouldn’t be able to repair, heal, open exists, or cleanse totems during the transition phase
---
Oh, look who's got no counter-arguments so they try to come back by saying that the person destroying them rn is a pedophile. So sweet. 
---
Hangmans trick is great for facecamping. Not that I do this very often because it's more boring than watching grass grow. But if I decide I want to facecamp a match I have a build specifically for facecamping for the lulz and hangmans trick is always in that build. You don't have to go anywhere to hang the slug. You can just use the same hook. It's also great against sabo teams. Not that there's very many in the game anymore. You still have people doing hooks for dailies and Jeff's perk to deal with.
---
You juked him once then he beat you twice......
---
You know they cant give pig anything cause shes liscenced
---
Rin is an adult, she is a college student.
---
That's what I was thinking. When playing solo or swf I always assume its up and get me some points.

I feel like The Nea is the hardest killer to learn 
---
OMG that sounds amazing on the game lol 
---
Couldn't you do the same thing by introducing a more complex rating/mmr - system? In general I like the idea of grinding for cosmetics/prestige instead of grinding for statistical upgrades. But maybe that's just me. I don't get a lot of joy from success / getting new things. It's just kinda "meh, whatever".
---
I HATE THAT MY GAME STARTS NOT RESPOINDING IN MID GAME WHILE I AM BEING CHASED
---
And if it isnt, you still get free points!
---
It's still shit though, maybe if there was an actual sound notification like Discordance? 
---
What did it use to do?
---
I don't think he was asking for you to switch them. I think he's wondering if we can get Jason into DBD. 
---
yeah every perk that doesn't make you invincible or give you a free escape is garbage
---
i blame the entity for being greedy 
---
I dunno how I feel about some of these.  Playing The Trapper is easy, sure, but playing The Trapper WELL is fucking 4D chess.  His power is one of the most simple and easily understood in the game, that is true, but actually catching anyone with it or even just corralling people with it at higher ranks requires a great deal of knowledge about map layout, survivor psychology, timing, and herding.  I’d say he’s at least intermediate, if you are talking about actually getting use out of his power rather than being an M1 killer with the power to waste his own time and hurt his own visibility.
---
Well **Easy** is just how they have him marked ingame and a overwhelming majority of people voted in BHVR's favor for that one. 
---
I want to know too
---
* shrug * 
---
this is basically a regular tier list lol
---
Did you kill all the younglings?
---
My man, get that empathy 3 before I beat your ass.
---
I know you didn’t just pull this list out of your ass, I saw the poll you made, I’m just saying I strongly disagree with the general consensus on that one and am explaining why I voted **Intermediate** and am disappointed he got placed lower than (I think) he ought to have.
---
she finally has pantsu...

---
Does it happen with all survivors? Or just one?
---
Whichever was toxic first, easy.
---
This is why we ONLY camp when one of them is toxic first.
---
I've never seen an Urban user capable of running a killer. They almost universally get off gens at the faintest heartbeat. They will not pull your hook. They will wait for you to die so they can get the hatch. Maybe this isn't you, but it is the vast majority of people I see who run urban.
---
&gt;yeah every perk that doesn't make you invincible or give you a free escape is garbage
---
I run BT, We'll Make It, Iron Will, WGLF. But yeah I guess?? 
---
I'm not telling you what to use. If urban is what you need to survive, so be it, but it's a definitive giveaway that you're not a skillful player 
---
With the new buff to prove thy self and leader SWF have never been more frightening
---
I like how the devs nerfed healing to slow the game down and then shortly after buffed a perk to pump out gens way faster than ever before. 1 step forward 3 steps back
---
Just explaining myself, that's all. I don't disagree with you.
---
I am an EXTREME advocate for nerfing SWF in some way. Random survivors have a weakness because they're not coordinated.. SWF does NOT have a weakness, anyone that says it does is either a liar, or insanely bad with their SWF team.
---
It's amazing what can be accomplished by just reading.

Legion itself looks comical. And even then, I'd still put my money on an MMA pro over a teenager with a knife. 
---
Ah I see. But it's still red for me? Am I actually receiving a debuff then, or just a visual error.
---
The guy on the left is supposed to be the survivor right? I just dk how that is supposed to represent a new player. It just seems like this meme was pretty desperate.
---
Yawn.
---
Are you personally calling me out or something? haha
---
Because we’re annoying, condescending and laugh at the same jokes over and over again thinking we’re funny?
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
My guess was creepy weird comments as per the one I replied to
---
You may be misunderstanding the quotation above. It means that for every person working on the gen with you, you will recieve a -10% efficiency bonus. Therefore the bar will be red since you are not reparing at 100% speed when working with others on a gen.
---
&gt;back in ten weeks
---
&gt;basic training
---
I think you’re grossly overestimating the liberty you’re gonna have in AIT, battle. Either way, good luck, embrace the suck.
---
The rework to Devour Hope is helping me a TON so far, but unfortunately it still doesn't help against hard gen rushing.
---
If you hook 5 survivors, and let them be unhooked while you're X distance away, you earn a token. At 5 tokens, you get free Mori on every survivor. INSANELY strong with a Killer that has high mobility.. get the hook, run away so they can unhook and you get the token, repeat. If you have to, let them get gens.. as long as you have 5 tokens by the time they have 1-2 gens left, it becomes EZ to get at least 2 kills and prevent your de-pip.
---
Just make sure to use Thrill of the Hunt.. fucking SUUUUCKS to play this way, get close to your 5 tokens, then the totem gets cleansed. Oh, and I wouldn't combine it with Ruin.. you get more benefit knowing that the totem they're working on is your Devour Hope totem.
---
Bonus points for Hex: Haunted Ground
---
yes you did
---
"just a little bit" 
---
I know that feel. Honestly I had to change my gameplay. I always run discordance now. And I will not touch the gen I spawn closest to. At most I'll tap it so it makes noise. I usually go look for a totem and scout until someone is found and only then do I start on a gen. I also feel like that bug where you spawn close to killer is back despite it being patched. Last couple of games I've been spawning within sight of the killer. 
---
It was in the shrine like 1 or 2 weeks after Leatherface came out.
---
Been enjoying it since then. 😎
---
Ok thanks!
---
PS4 or PC? If you are on PS4 I’ll burn you some BP offerings dude.
---
well done Jeff you slowed the game down, "just a little bit" 
---
Would Hank be the Survivor?
---
I didn't say you didn't do any gens? I think you're making assumptions. I'm merely offering a solution to the standoff. 
---
The teabag 😂😂😂👏👏👏
---
I think you should be allowed to keep your tokens after it's broken. Like you already went through all the trouble to earn them so it's kinda shitty that as soon as you get enough to actually do anything it can be broken and you lose everything.
---
So if there was a chance you lost your DS at the start of the match out of your control it would be fair? Because that's pretty much what you are saying.
---
The Entity is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be... unnatural.
---
&gt; THEY'VE HAD MORE THAN PLENTY OF TIME FOR IT TO NOT BE RUSHED.
---
DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH GAME DEVELOPMENT?
---
I think getting every survivor and killer to 50 first is a bit too grindy. I have about 700 hours on one account and I barely have everything about lvl 40. It gives new players a clear disadventage. Everything after unlocking the perks can stay as grindy as it is: it gives you a reason to play. 
---
&gt; I STILL HATE THAT WE CAN'T DENY UNHOOKS
---
YOU CAN GRAB THEM
---
It doesnt mean anything 
---
I usually get this on games w 3 DC's, so I farm and give the last survivor hatch.
---
I agree that NOED is a BS free-kill for bad Killers, your team had no reason to not take the time to do totems.
---
If the Killer has decent momentum, I'd understand smashing out the gens, but this Killer had 0 downs until all the gens were done.
---
That said, NOED needs a couple of nerfs;
---
1. Revert the recent buff that gave all tiers the exposed effect. That should only be available on NOED 3, as currently r20 Killers can essentially have (and become dependant upon) full NOED.
---
2. The exposed effect should appear on Survivors' huds the moment the last gen pops, as currently there is no way of *knowing* the Killer has NOED until someone goes down to it, hence why it's a free kill.
---
Shes so much fun 4Head
---
Oh yeah, just link pages of patch notes. It certainly isn't possible someone missed something in there.
---
Is it so hard to just answer a damn question instead of being a douche about it?
---
Hookwave=unsafe to unhook do gens or something.
---
I MEAN SURVIVORS DENYING UNHOOKS FROM FRIENDLY SURVIVORS
---
How are these guys supposed to make money elsewise?
---
I did answer the question. I even followed it up with where in the patch notes it can be found. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yeah, I'm on ps4, what you mean burn some offerings? Like give me some offerings that can help me get more blood points? Remember dude, I didn't play the game for a half of year now, I forgot everything.
---
It’s supposed to mean that don’t save me, but some people think it means come save me so you can’t really know what people are trying to say while doing it
---
Not to mention even playing him well, a good survivor can fuck with you hard.
---
Not in that sense. If you want to add me on PS4 then I can burn some for you in some games. Got quite a few envelopes and party streamers.
---

Heh I ran spies on Freddy since he came out, it was inconsistent with it's 75% chance or whatever, but survivors would bump into them running from my music radius. It helped a lot.
---
Everyone knows about that
---
I mean he's not wrong.
---
Is it known since when it should've worked like that ?
---
MAKE THE 25% BOOST FROM MOLDY THE BASELINE BUT THEN INCREASE EVERY RANGE ADDONS RARITY BY ONE TIER TO COMPENSATE
---
ALSO MAPLE KNIGHT NEEDS SOME KIND OF EFFECT OUTSIDE OF BEING TRAINING WHEELS
---
Surprisingly, not a lot of people know though. 
---
Oh yes your explanation was that bad... I'm still trying to understand your point here and I'm pretty sure you are capable of wording it better. I'm not even arguing balance here (cause I honestly can't understand it) I'm just saying you're just ranting that he has his power and not providing any real valuable discussion (and you "flaired" the post as a concept post which it is not)
---
I would love to save you but ive had two hooks, im injured and mangled, the killer is camping you and it's a wraith. I've tried coming over and he just stared me dow, standing there menacingly.
---
I'm sorry but one of us needs to leave this place. We cannot give him a 4k, he's camped everyone.
---
You were the best survivor on our team, looping for 5 gens. I want to save you but i can't.
---
This is goodbye my friend, I'll see you in the next life.
---
It doesn't account for them because etgey almost every happen and would have no noticeable impact on the data.

---
THIS IS THE SECOND BIGGEST ROOT CAUSE OF ALL FRUSRTRATION AS SURVIVOR IMO. I WOULDNT BE SO PISSED OFF ABOUT GETTING FACECAMPED BEFORE ANY GENS ARE DONE FROM STAGE 1 TO 3 IF I AT LEAST GOT SOME BP FROM IT
---
Amazing
---
LARRY!
---
CRY ABOUT IT
---
ITEMS SHOULD HAVE VISUAL DISTINCTION BASED ON TIER AND IF THEY HAVE CERTAIN REALLY STRONG ADDONS LIKE THE INSTAHEAL
---
I'm sorry but I fail to see the relevance in this clip, I could show you a clip of me trapping everyone in the game (I think we can all agree that trapper is not the greatest). Would that make it broken? Sure not, there are some counter plays to it.
---
Also there is no such thing as a dbd pro player let alone playing on console.

i love it

Nah, I played one survivor game and two killer games and randomly got booted. I just gave up and watched Monto vids.

Yeah but does it work on yourself?

When I'm on the hook I wave my arms to indicate that it's safe to get me, I treat it was a "hey don't forget about me!" type thing and then little movements to indicate that it's not safe

FREDDY NEEDS A LOT OF WORK. HAG, FOR EXAMPLE, JUST GOT AN INCREASE TO HER TRAP SPEED. THEY CAN'T JUST SAY "OKAY JOE, GO AND MAKE THIS CHANGE AND WE'LL ADD IT TOMORROW". THEY NEED TO:
---
1. PLAN THE CHANGE  
---
2. GET APPROVAL TO WORK ON IT   
---
3. WORK OUT THE DETAILS  
---
4. IMPLEMENT IT   
---
5. MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T BREAK ANYTHING, AND FIX IT IF THEY HAVE TO  
---
6. TEST IT FOR BALANCE
---
7. GET IT APPROVED
---
8. MAKE SURE SONY AND MICROSOFT ARE OKAY WITH THE UPDATE  
---
9. UPDATE THE GAME
---
THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING "LOL LET'S MAKE FREDDY BAD", THERE'S CLEARLY A REASON.
---
100% this. I bought the game Sunday and have been maining Nurse(rank 12 pog). I saw a lot of threads about Stridors vs Whispers. I had been using Stridors up until last night when I realized that I couldn't hear shit either way. I didn't understand the hype for Whispers, but now it's a must-have for me. I've definitely had games where I've wandered and listened for naught, but in my most recent game Whispers is the reason I secured a kill on an otherwise stealthy survivor. Just the knowledge that there *isn't* someone nearby is super good and I regret not utilizing it sooner.
---
Either way, buying Leatherface during the winter solstice would've been a greater investment instead of praying for the rigged shrine to drop BBQ. If you can buy cosmetics (not essentially saying all of you do), you can purchase LF.
---
I understand where you're coming from, I did say that I respect the need for the devs to have money, especially with dedicated servers (TYVM!) coming up. However, this isn't about money. This is about deception. If I give BHVR $4.99 or $2.49 on sale, so be it. If I do it because they're lying, now there's a moral problem.
---
Lol thanks! All the power to them to monetize their game, $20 with frequent sales is cheap. However, yes, lying is nasty. I can't condone that.
---
All of them.😡
---
"Simpler that way", you literally type an extra thing instead of leaving it out and save yourself some time. Not to mention putting it there is wrong 99.9% of the time anyway. Have fun looking like a moron.
---
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD no u u/Freedy_Kringle
---
Well I guess we can play couple of rounds, if you have time that is, I appreciate that. But before that I want to train myself, get the hang of mechanics again, that's all I need to do before that. Again thanks.
---
I guess

TOTEM SPAWNS ARE JUST AS BAD AS BEFORE. SURVIVORS STILL SPAWN ON THEM, THEY STILL SPAWN RIGHT NEXT TO GENS, THEY STILL SPAWN OUT IN THE OPEN. THERE'S REALLY NO WAY FOR IT TO BE CODED SO THEY DON'T SPAWN RIGHT NEXT TO GENERATORS? GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER BHVR.

Here's my compilation:

Artists don’t work with matchmaking
---
I didn't. Is it a normal lunge attack? 
---
Yeah my main worry was the crow but he didn’t care. I even DMed the guy who died and the crow was his focus too lol
---
at least spies from the shadows is a viable perk again
---
I don't really see anything wrong with making paid perks a bit rarer but BBQ is starting to get out of hand at this stage 
---
The community is responsible for feedback, and most of the feedback for Legion is pointless filler that has zero ideas behind it and is simply repetitive callings of how Legion sucks.  It's criticism without any constructiveness backing it.  You won't get what you want changed by doing that. 
---
If anyone wants to know how the game turned out, the killer completely left me alone and tunnelled the guy who was hooked the rest of the game. So he ended up dying but everyone else got out
---
What happend exactly?

I run OC, Pop, Disco, and have been swapping out the 4th from BBQ, IG, BS, and now probably surveillance. I use it on clown since he can end chases fast and can usually keep the last 3 gens from being done.

you shouldn't feel bad for someone that had the chance to get out but instead teabagged and went away from the open gate while noed was active

Nope, its pretty much a pointless stat, I don't see any reason to why they added it.

I don't see a problem with it either. I just don't like them saying it's fair when it isn't.

Also, BBQ has been out of hand for a while lol.

Because BHVR cares more about making money from fan service cosmetics.

Yeah but you have to be facing a certain way.

A good option mid-game if the obsession is actually an amazing evader. I am horrified of even trying adept Myers because it sounds like it's not fun
---
Hey,  i just got out of a game as hag, that should have ended with a 3K.   However i was kicked out of my game while someone was being taken by the  sky crab god, and someone was on the hook. There was no D/C's. It left  me so confused and honestly a bit stunned. Yet what leads me to think it  was some kind of exploit or a cheat, was the fact one of the survivors  who up until this point was pain to deal with, stood still after i  downed the others. Then like 15 seconds later i was kicked out of the  game. I have no idea what happened, but i want to believe it was some  toxic survivors getting mad that they lost so close to wining.
---
my selfcareless dwight build has only gotten stronger with the leader changes
---
I p3'd-lvl50 Feng and then Kate
---
So true... these BP perks should not be counted in the 8k cap. They should be separated BP bonuses.
---
Such as **Hillbilly's** and **Bubba's** *Speed Limiter*, **Trapper's** *Padded Jaws*, **Hag's** *Scarred Hand*, **Wraith's** *"The Beast" - Soot*, **Myers'** *Vanity and Scratched Mirrors* Addons
---
Same as a survivor when another survivor gets hooked. Can't see which direction killer went most of the time until the static dissipates. 
---
It isn't fun, pretty sure i did it my first try. It was just after rank reset and I was pretty much playing a base m1 killer. Bring some decent add-ons is what is recommend 
---
Lolol, 1.89% is substantial, maybe not really small. I say probably rigged because I don't have the actual mechanism and can't actually prove it.
---
Rest assured, I won't be playing any poker, and my BBQ argument is weak anyway. Correct, maybe, but weak. Still, 1.89% must be a meme. It's quite small, and with each passing week gets smaller. While, Gambler's Fallacy, the chance is decreasing (with added teachable), not increasing in any way (I know this), this is still moderately acceptable as an outlier, even if it is suspicious.
---
That being said, a trend of 6.7% with 460 trials is certainly significant.
---
None of those perks are so good to really justify replacing the more meta and useful perks for them. We’ll make it is okay but I’d rather have my teammate running borrowed time. 
---
Autodidact requires wayyyyy too much to be useful. It’s a genuinely terrible perk because it is way too situational and depends on the game going a very specific way. 
---
I like botany knowledge cause it feels good to heal so fast but the increased speed also doesn’t really justify getting rid of decisive strike or an adrenaline perk 
---
Yes, you are
---
I'm actually sort of against this. Even though no BBQ for over a year might be unfair, if the Shrine *is* truly random, then I'll take it. If it is rigged, then this is not just absurd, but malicious.
---
I honestly didnt know that was a picture 🤔😂 thanks for showing me tho

HOOK SPAWNS ARE FUCKING BROKEN

STFU, noed is a crutch and you area baby killer for using it. Trash
---
But if they did it would explain quite a lot.
---
What did he do to get tunneled so hard? Lol 
---
Good plan, then you can decisively strike that ass.
---
So cute
---
The killer should run Unnerving Presence to increase skillcheck odds for the last few remaining % after installing brand new parts. It will make BNP skillchecks harder BUT if you all succeed, it will probably save you a few seconds.
---
Also maybe The Pig's Workshop Grease and Razor Wires are bugged and also increase all skillchecks odds (instead of just increasing jigsaw box skillcheks...) :D
---
0.4 hrs lol

AS IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT JUST FOR CHANGING THE HAG'S TRAP SET SPEED.

Great idea! The perks are pretty good, and decently balanced.

I agree with you there to an extent.  I'm sort of the same way as far as WANTING to sandbag someone who has done nothing. Although I rarely do. I really try to escape the trial so I do my best to help my fellow survivors. I also agree that most do it by accident like you said. Adrenaline gets to pumping and all you see and think about are where the next pallets are. I just wish there were some sort of way we could tell the difference. I swear some survivors seem to be working with the killer at times lmao.
---
What a fucking asshole
---
She might have had DS, but you had NOED *and* Blood Warden. Did you really expect to do that badly that you needed both endgame crutches? 
---
Where’s legion?
---
Every immersed Claudette: I have mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still that I have become invisible to the eye. *Watch.*
---
Trapper A, and Hag S. I want to kill myself 
---
They disconnected
---
Perk 1 is insanely broken, any time in a chase you just teleport 12 seconds away from the killer, that's an insane amount added to a chase when you consider they have to re-close that ground, not lose track of you in that time, and hope you don't get to a new pallet/loop. It'd be like sprint burst activating mid chase but lasting like 10 full seconds. Dunno if I'm reading it right, but I really hope you aren't suggesting it'd revert your own injuries on top of that.
---
Perk 3 is also broken, we don't need more free second chance perks, and this is basically just DS from the ground before the killer can pick you up, with better odds of escaping as they're blind. Time is critical enough already and it's why people keep calling for DS nerfs, now imagine a survivor can dodge a hit with dead hard, drop off you with decisive, and blind you and run away whenever you try to pick them up all in one game, not to mention probably having adrenaline for later. It's just a huge amount of time that can be bought and shouldn't be needed.
---
Keyboard has software that can make macro's xD
---
*misses a hit* "Why am I getting sniped? This is fucking unbelievable, man. This game is so unbalanced, mate. Fucking look at this shit! 4 DS, thick must, yeah of course, Coldwind offering cause they know I'm Nurse. Of fucking course. Are survivors easier on NA or something? I'm sick of people saying I'm not a good player. I obviously am and you can tell who the bad survivors are in this game and I am not one of them. For FUCK'S SAKE. Yeah, get over yourself mate you sniped me with thick mist."
---
It's rare that all four dc
---
Interesting, I had a similar problem with the clown. I use to think I had to be right on top of people to hit them with his little knife, boy was I surprised the first time I got a machete length hit out of him.
---
I love how he was crying about the game being unbalanced. Like... Yeah... What do you expect? You're running no perks or add-ons and the survivors have 4 perks each and possibly items lmao. 
---
Legion is F and S+++ tier at the same time.
---
Been existing for 3 years already tho, but nice to see peoples still didnt knew that one
---
I'm sorry but even if your math is correct there just isn't enough data to make that call and almost 2% is not that low. I'm not even arguing over your math, it seems like its right except the fact that you count week one of release which I highly doubt is possible and that could change the math a bit. Also did you take into consideration that when the perk goes into the shrine it is removed from the pool for 2 weeks? I guess not. That seems to be how it works (according to gamepedia's dbd wiki) but I'm not even sure for how long that has been a thing maybe from day 1 idk.
---
Tbh I think Hag is better than Trapper. &gt;.&gt;
---
/u/Caleaus ReDdiT MiGhT NoT bE FoR YoU REEEEEE
---
It just seems like we all hate ourselves for playing a broken game that we like half of the time.
---
Yeah, rank reset's a bitch eh
---
Problem with this is that there is no one signal for being camped or for it being safe. Some (or most) survivors will fake attempt when it’s unsafe, but not all of them. I do full fakes when I’m being camped and spam fakes or do nothing when it’s safe (most of the time) 
---
Michael hitting that t-pose to asert dominase
---
The wraith can cloak in the middle of a chase and immediately make up ground.  Speed shouldn’t be his main cloaking ability.
---
Billy’s main function IS speed so they’re not really comparable.

That’s a big oof.
---
Thanks for informing us
---
You're like the 5th person to post this news
---
Hex perks are there to be destroyed, that's why they offer powerful bonuses that stay as long as they are around. DS is a one use perk that goes away when activated, hit or not. It's not comparable in the slightest.
---
Some games hexes stay around all game. Others they get taken out instantly. That's the gamble with hex perks. If you don't want your perk gone in 60 seconds, don't run it
---
She is 20 years old
---
I never saw anything in “new” or “hot” when I posted this, and only saw something when I scrolled miles down. But thank you for informing me. 
---
Had to repost it because this picture has been posted here a million times
---
Its kinda hard to answer the question. The counter you listed requires insane map knowledge and communication between all survivors. How is a chase going to get you nowhere? They trigger one trap and either keep running the loop and in which case you place another trap or they run to another loop that has another trap.
---
I get that Hag doesnt seem good on paper because Trapper isnt but Hag is good because she doesnt need to waste time to pick up her traps, her traps are harder to avoid and her traps counter loops way better than Trapper does. You just have to watch someone decent play Hag. If theres no flashlight in that lobby they’re kinda fucked.
---
Wraith, Clown, Status Exposed and Huntress
---
Flapping of arms constantly means you're being camped and tells me to finish objective. If it's once or twice not constant. Then that usually tells me that everyone is on a Gen and someone needs to get you. 
---
If you flap constantly to say "come get me" expect to die because the unwritten rule has always been you're being camped. Since I've been playing anyway which is like a year and a half. 
---
But he is tho
---
Damn those people using game mechanics designed to give advantages  to give themselves an advantage. What horror 
---
I do the same, and when I get tunneled or camped I'll watch Ardetha. It feels good to see some people that like to let survivors have fun too.
---
If you stopped posting that would likely work
---
Dead 'ard, nice...
---
Freddy is by far the most misleading. How many times I've been downed by a Fredrick who seemed to be too far away. And the amount of times I've hit survivors and thought, Damn Freddy is like Mr Fantastic. All stretchy arms and shit. 
---
I'm sure one blink and a hit counts. Did for me.
---
Does it work when she's in her power?
---
Its not that insane map knowledge needed. It would be a slower process without communication and its more prone to failure, but you only get a hit for a test from the survivor side. A hit can let the survivor run to a loop you cant have prepped, and go from there. Its pretty situational so its hard to talk about scenarios I guess. While you're looping at one place you can keep a lookout for the next rotation. You dont need to know the entire maps loops to do this and get away with it vs. 110 killer. 
---
I'm just here sharing drawings of one of my favourite games. I don't know if you're always like this but I hope you'll lighten up more. Have a nice day :)
---
I rarely play killer so I would say I'm somewhere around maybe 200-300?
---
Ask the one who send it? Or does he also don‘t know? I‘m pretty sure I saw this or at least a similar one on redbubble. 
---
Aww, thanks!
---
I imagined Doc as the announcer on this one though:
---
"FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE... OOOVERCHAAARGE!"
---
I thought so for the first dc but as I said I got O blood points and the emblem bar didn’t move
---
When it happened in the second game I figured something was wrong 
---
3 survivors, all one hook away, one gen left that isn’t even started and all of the gens are close enough to walk to without worrying so I don’t think the killer would dc
---
I dont think I've ever lost an item from the killer DCing.
---
If the killer DCs it counts as an "escape" and you keep your items. Well at least you're supposed to.
---
Break down ain't looking too good
---
Monto 🙏🏾
---
Didn’t try killer tho since my challenges was mostly survivor oriented and I’m not good with the nurse to do her daily :(
---
This made my day
---
Hmm. Yeah, I agree. You are taking the more logical route 👍
---
That's why I hate rank reset
---
This is the new ultra rare killer offering "Bloody polite survivors", where you have a 100% of getting only polite and fair survivors.
---
"A flavor to pay $3.99 for"
---
He should have saved you, 
---
But doing the start of the "attempt escape" animation (also called hook gymnastics) is normaly a sign, that the killer is around and unhooking is not save.
---
Hah! I do actually like people that complete their gen if it's 3/4 or above before they come get me. BIG BRAIN PLAYS
---
It feels cheap and annoying as a survivor too, believe me. I’d like to actually work towards an open gate or two but it’s hard to do if other people aren’t on the same page.
---
God damn
---
Here for the story
---
Never, ever, underestimate the stupidity of survivors. The amount of terrible plays I have seen survivors do is just astonishing.
---
I'm already afraid of eventually getting enough BP to level my level 1 survs and actually have to bother with that achievement, lol.
---
Or you know some of the actions he does deserve the hate he gets. But ill just refrain from comment on whiteknight stuff so it doesnt give him more reason to play the victim. 
---
I saw This same design T-Shirt Available here..
---
i wasnt talking about one tricks i have a brain and I know that someone who mains 1600 hours of traper is a better trapper so you can stop whiteknight. 
---
DECISIVE STRIKE
---
I just love little trapper and his jazz hands 
---
Legion is actually two killers.without add ons is f and with franks mix tape S++
---
I always sprint away for few meter to hide unless I know for sure that killer is on other side of map.
---
I tend to agree with him, but I have to admit this is kinda tru 
---
Most likely no, ranking means absolutely nothing except that you played a few games.
---
Seems to be a new "feature" that came with the latest patch.
---
Since launch of the game it always meant a killer is camping. Where these revisionist accounts of this meaning the opposite came from, I'll never know.  It means CAMPING, DO GENS!!!!!!!
---
Wdym, sure people can complain about it but it doesn't change the fact that gens AREN'T being made faster, it's the same speed as before with the perk. And without the perk it's still slower.
---
People who think it's faster are stupid, and you shouldn't count the feedback of people who aren't informed about the situation.
---
I know right, it's like the shrine is random or something.
---
This isn't your average, every day camping. This is...advanced camping.
---
Oh I have to start using this now 
---
I honestly don’t get why people rate Huntress S. She can very easily be looped, and she only specializes in open areas.
---
Are you a console player?
---
Sounds like you need to work on your stealth and jukes. It’s also meant to be played as a team but many just run around carelessly without any sort of plan
---
Just a toxic boi
---
Friends?
---
I want them to fix everything. *Cough* dedicated servers *Cough*
---
Nuuh nyuu nuuuuuuh.

You need to chill the he'll out, when people defend tru3 it's fucking white knighting, tru3 has a lot of viewers on a daily basis so clearly he's doing something right and people like him. You haven't even made solid points as to why not to like him.
---
He had prepared for this day, this moment. Nothing would stop such a mad lad now
---
SHIT SORRY!
---
I play on PC and still get laggy framerate sometimes. :( Graphics card *supposedly* is well above requirements.
---
Wastes all of your BP from that game to get out 3 seconds earlier, too.
---
Looking at the scores, probably altruism sudoku?
---
Why am I now imagining Amanda doing the Slav Squat pose with the survivors while Legion cries in the background
---
Hes still doing a lot though, hes going through his hour long streams and editing his matches on their own to upload on youtube. Its nice for someone who cant watch his stream live and doesnt have the time to go through it on his twitch.
---
This makes me almost as hard as bare assed Mikey.
---
She can shoot over most loops and end loops earlier than most m1 killers bc of her range. Only bad huntresses get looped my guy
---
For how powerful it is, yes that would be fine. 
---
Your argument is incredibly petty btw. 
---
Technically yes, but running both seems a bit overkill. 
---
Freddy not in Darn Teir 0/10

---
No, but I had a Claudette come back after she left through the exit gate.
---
You dont consider it being toxic yet you do it out of spite for the killer if they camp? How does that make sense
---
I don't even follow tru3, I just don't get why you hate him. I only wach him when a new killer comes out becouse he tends to figure their ability out a lot quicker than the streamers I usually follow. Where was I whiteknighting? Was there a reason for me to do so? I'm just curious from where the hate on him comes from
---
How can you be scared of Pennywise when the dude literally fell up the stairs and does Fortnite dances
---
Pig can do this pretty easily 
---
Thanks for explaining that, totally wouldn’t of gotten it if you didn’t explain the joke
---
If they were truly trying to help, they wouldn't be t-bagging and fast-vaulting the pallet over and over again. They were just trying to be toxic, why is also why they disconnected when they went down.
---
\*misses a hit\* "must've been ded ard"

---
FeelsBadMan Freddy
---
Well, for the fun of it. Of course it's harder, but it adds a new challenge to the game. And also, it's a different thing to do for your viewers.
---
Lmao as a Freddy main I completely disagree. Not bringing self care means easy win for the killer. 
---
Tbf at this point I believe they don’t even check in on the guy and upload whatever he has ready. 
---
He just needs to realize it and that’s the day if shirtless killer skins being patched in.

Please tell me this is a case of /r/SubsYouFellFor/

Why all these drag thing shitposts 
---
Ye it was clickbait
---
Lex Luthor once stole Forty Keks. 
---
That’s one more than 39
---
Looks like somebody got looped once and respected pallets too hard. 
---
I think that was me, and the reason I didn't come was because there were 2 full gens left and I found the harch
---
I guess my experience as mostly playing survivor is that peoples reaction to hex perks varies. I mean a lot of people seem pretty neutral? I also don't see how because something is sometimes frustrating and some people react toxically to that it is inherently toxic?
---
Iron will
---
Hate is a strong word. I just dont like him and dont think he is as good as he claims to be. He did a lot of BS to SWFriends of mine, deleted the clips after (one included showing the profile to his entire stream claiming he hacked because he got looped in an endless loop - you dont show profiles if u dont want to witch hunt.). He constantly acts like a victim on twitter but continues to fuel the fire and so on. Just an overall unlikeable, overrated streamer. 
---
Huntress is good in a sort of similar way to Nurse in my opinion.
---
Nurse can hit from a range, since she can teleport.
---
Huntress can also hit from a range, but it's not as instant or reliable. Maybe dedicated servers will be a shadowbuff to Huntress mains.
---
Damn. That Meg must have pissed him off  badly. 
---
Freddy is in "A" for me :/
---
Don’t know the show but this is a solid meme.

https://i.imgur.com/uqlFbOk.jpg
---
Since Hag doesn’t need perks to help her end chases, you run perks that slow the game down instead: Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Thanatophobia, Pop Goes the Weasel, Overcharge, Duscordance, etc. You have to accept that as a killer with high low early game and good late game the first three gens will be done instantly and there’s nothing you can do about that. Instead, set up to ensure the last two won’t be completed. Perks like Make Your Choice and BBQ allow her to keep pressure without even needing to patrol gens, as you know where to search for the next survivor
---
In a perfect world men like me would not exist...but this is not a perfect world
---
Tier 4 Bloodwarden sure is strong
---
It’s almost like everybody who hates legion also hates nurse hmmmm
---
Nurse is incredibly broken and powerful, she can end chases the fastest and ignores loops. If you are a red rank nurse main and you need to use NOED to get your kills then you should not be at red ranks as it clearly doesn't match your skill level. 
---
McLean fits this perfectly 
---
&gt;She can shoot over most loops
---
You mean get fucked over by an invisible wall despite shooting the hatchet 2m above a solid item?
---
A Huntress, much like Nurse, needs to analyse your running patterns and try to predict your movements, if you don't give her anything to take into account, she'll have to throw a hatchet at random.
---
PATCH 2.5.0??? This has been happening since 2.0, for me at least
---
Thanks bud! I'm working on another picture atm.. Gonna take me a while tho.. stay tuned
---
Had a Claudette DC on me once after I grabbed them. I dropped them because I already had their BBQ stack, and about 30 seconds later Nurses calling picked up a Dwight trying to heal her 😂
---
It'll still get upvoted because this sub is full of morons
---
If you're going for adept you can use add ons 
---
As a Freddy main I can safely say I used to use this build and I don't think I ever walked away with less than 2 kills. Now I'm more experienced and I refuse to use NOED and still walk away with at least 2 kills most games. IMO if you need to use NOED then you should just derank to where your skill level lies. 
---
I didn't know that existed, thank you!

Sorta darn sorta not darn.

Don't want to cheat and all, on the other hand I've p3ed all killers and have all perks, so I wouldn't mind unlimited addons for all my grinding efforts
---
All of those are Tru3ta1ent quotes lmao. I watched him for years and recently got sick of him.
---
Yea, I dont see how anyone could he mad at you for not going to help and also how anyone could be mad at the killer for camping in that situation.  Its what both of you should logically be doing.
---
If you use NOED on other killers then you're still not as skillful as someone without it. It's not as bad as using it on high tier killers and especially not as bad as using it on nurse but the point still stands. Using NOED means your skill level is clearly not all that great. A good killer does not need to rely on NOED every game. 
---
Put the yellow mori in E and put Freddy at f
---
I hate going against spirit. After six matches I quitted the game and weeped in silence. Please stop it. 
---
AAYY, Freddy movin up
---
I dunno. My issue with the picture is she's too clean. Huntress' feet/toes shows how she gets down. lol
---
I mean I like it.
---
I would say Adrenaline or We'll Make It, but why ? Bp is the only reason to play the game...
---
I guess we'll have to agree to to disagree on this because I just don't see toxic behavior from it the majority of the time. I also don't think ruin is OP and neither NOED seeing as it is only usable at the end of the match.
---
i think because the potential for a 2 hit in a matter of 2-3 seconds. pop the hatchet. gets hit then finish off with the axe. as a huntress main, i've had games where somebody got the person off the hook and started running. chucked a hatchet downed the person off the hook and then hit the guy who got them off in a matter of 5 seconds. if your good with huntress she's deadly. 
---
Awww look at him hes so cute i tell him hes offended and now me calling you offended offends you and now you try to turn it around by calling me triggered. Nice one dude first one to play that one me so original and btw those aren't facts those are bias opinions there is a difference. 
---
You specifically said you called me a bitch though? I mean I took no offense in the first place but please make up your mind, do you even know what you're saying? 
---
_obligatory_ Still a better love story than Twilight
---
Remove the Hex factor and it is OP (which is essentially the same as it not being cleansed the whole game). If you don't see toxicity due to that I guess you don't play the game, or you have a especial queue that only good guys can get. Even watching videos/streams you can see it leads to toxic behavior.
---
for any complaints regarding her attire, id like to direct you to [this comment](https://reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ajcdn0/tried_drawing_a_younger_and_anime_styled_huntress/eeubhvj)
---
also the fact that im still learning how to draw clothes on bodies right, but mostly that comment
---
LOL!!!!
---
That was very satisfying.
---
Game only been released for about 2 and a jalf years. Also, what you think might be common knowledge, might not be. This taught me something.
---
You...I like you
---
Where's the loading screen? It should be atleast S tier.
---
I too knew not of this
---
Whenever a new killer/survivor comes out.
---
Selfcare is trash NOW! 
---
I never specifically called you a bitch LOL SEE YOU JUST PROVED ME RIGHT you thought i was calling you a bitch and you got triggered because you thought i called you a bitch and now you're crying like a bitch and now i am calling you one. You can go back and read it again i never said you were. You said just stop chasing and i said "i ain't no bitch" but you misunderstood what i said and you proved me right that you're offended because you agree that i called you a bitch when i never did. Damn words are hard
---
Nothing I've said has even alluded to me being offended but sure buddy whatever floats your boat. You've said nothing to offend me and your responses are just confusing and supposedly condescending? I don't really know what you're trying to get across here but okay. And yeah tbh the counter of cleansing totems for NOED is just my bias opinion. 
---
What this update changed to make this happen?
---
Bandit lost acog though. F
---
Nothing’s stopping you from using it. It’s still a valid option in the game. As long as you understand when you play that as you gain experience, the scales start to tip wildly in your favor. Most killers don’t mind the challenge, just don’t be that guy that has a group of 4 guys all running around being toxic. I think that’s the main gripe about it.
---
push home or end
---
Well if i said nothing to offend you then why downvote me,tell me im complaint and argue with me and call me insults and then claim that i called you a bitch. Sounds more like you misunderstood and got offended and started to insult me for no reason right? Damn it feels so good to be a fucking genius

Are you okay?
---
&gt;Aww look at you got upset because i called u a bitch
---
Your second comment after I simply said 'then don't complain like one'. I didn't even assume you were calling me a bitch until you blatantly told me your intentions but sure.
---
Made up your mind yet? Seems to me like you don't even know what you're saying anymore.
---
Dismissing one’s ability to know what one is doing without objective criticism is widely considered to be a “dick move”
---
No point in arguing that. 
---
Calling me a “snowflake” in a pitiful attempt to hurt my oh so fragile feelings is rather inappropriate.
---
The anonymity of the internet is a blissful thing, isn’t it?
---
Anyways, always remember to keep comments like that to yourself or the internet. One day you might get physically hurt by keeping up that attitude.
---
Have a good one, mate. And GL to you. You might need it much more than I do
---
What did she do that was toxic? 
---
Nah 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Staying on the map helps too, if they would’ve left, the other downed person probably couldn’t have used his unbraekable
---
Yeah it's ripoff german
---
If the devs refuse to balance the game, then we will.
---
Oof that nurse + noed though yikes. 
---
Kinda into her butch “emotionally unavailable” aesthetic 👀
---
His point is that killers are unbalanced. Instead of changing gameplay balance to make any other killer except Nurse more viable in top play, they choose to bandaid the issue by simply throwing more perks and killers at the problem.
---
gz on the plat tho :D
---
Pretty sure you'd get banned
---
I'm running we'll make it, botany knowledge and a medkit and people are still running away at rank 1 even under a week after rank reset.
---
Can't remember which map though, might be a licenced one... 
---
Yeah thanks it's been a real grind and getting the nurse achievement on ps4 made me want to kill myself but I got it 😊
---
You uh... don’t wanna know. It has to do with Freddy’s “hobbies”
---
Since the buff, every other killer uses NOED. Its no longer a powerful perk that a killer may have, its an easy to get, overpowered perk *at all tiers* that every other killer uses because 'oh I only have tier 1 perks and I have nothing better' or 'oh I'm level 2 but I got NOED 1 and that gives me kills so I'm good at this killer so long as I continue to use it'. 
---
She's phasing behind you *Waaaaah*
---
I respect Tru3 as a player, but everybody has to admit that he complains way too much.  I understand though, I've seen his stream.  He does get TONS of 4-man SWF with everybody holding Insta-heals, DS, and Dead Hard/Sprint Burst, but here's the thing.  Tru3 is a popular DBD player in our community, so of course he is gonna get Stream sniped more often than not.  I remember him calling BS on the fact that he is a Nurse with NO PERKS and either getting no kills or at least 2 kills.    
---
Good job on getting to high ranks with no perks, Tru3, but if your argument is that High Ranking Killers with NO perks, NO Add-ons (Even if its the best killer in the game)  Are weak against 4 High Ranking Survivors with All the Perks, All the Items, All the Add-ons.....well.....No Shit, Sherlock!!!
---
If I'm on the hook and I see the person standing in one spot, I assume the found the hatch and kill myself for that purpose. I don't care if I don't make it out, I want the people I'm playing with to make it out, so I'll gladly drain my hook if needed.
---
ok
---
He is trying to say that it isn't fun at all when a Legion moonwalks to down you with deep wound. It's not fun to go against because you can't do anything about it, and even facing legion normally isn't fun either because there is no counterplay. By "counterplay" I mean any way to skillfully avoid the legion during chase, which doesn't exist because he can simply vault pallettes and windows along with no cool down on his attack. No good legion is going to get 360d by a survivor for the entire duration of his frenzy 
---
The joke within the joke here is Claudette is attached to Roman Reigns.  Both of them are hated. 
---
He certainly is for the rank 20s that got him nerfed in the first place 
---
Well, there goes any hint of balance the game had for limiting high rarity items. Unlimited ultra rares for EVERYONE!
---
But this shouldn't be un-punishable for some things. Too many perks for your current level. Too high of prestige for your hours. Achievements having impossible unlock times. Im certain the devs can look into the more extreme cases. There should be enough backend data on the playerbase to do something like how they have given bans for hacked Legacy, perk recolors, or basic SAM achievement unlocks.
---
But I just don't see it happening though outside of the MOST extreme cases. Even then though, this isn't good.
---
But I just started
---
If the next character is a polish one, we know it's that guy who's trapped in there.
---
Yikes so I'm a survivor main am I? Sheesh this sub needs to make up their minds instead of making it depend on the post. 
---
BUT I WANT TO PLAY WITH A FRIEND!!! IS SO ANNOYINT THAT WE CAN ONLY PLAY AS SURVIVORS.
---
EVOLVE HAD AN OPTION WHERE YOU COULD QUEUE TO PREFFER AS A MONSTER EVEN IF YOU WERE WITH A FRIEND. 
---
THIS IS BOTHERING ME SO MUCH
---
Walking on that thing barefoot looks like a great way to get splinters, upper-picture-Claudette-with-weird-outfit.
---
You’ll have to forgive my mobile formatting 
---
*You got a better idea?*
---
Eugh, this makes me think I should run deliverance more often. 
---
If everyone is injured then why? Usually people heal up after they lose the killer so they don't get instantly downed again once found. Going into the endgame it's unlikely that a survivor will have decided to leave themselves injured unless they are in the midst of a chase or healing while the last gen is done to specifically check for NOED. Very very unlikely though and the person in the chase would be likely to go down anyway. 
---
That must be Springwood - Fredward was a gardener at the preschool and abused the kids
---
"Entity Pleased"
---
You gotta kill everyone. Either by sacrifice or mori 
---
Honestly, I feel like I sacrifice myself more often than not in these situations ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Unless all gens are done and there’s a door open I don’t expect to be saved if it’s just two of us left. 
---
And didn't the devs say they canr ban console people? If so then they to make a hotfix
---
I do have a few rep 2s and a rep 3 50 and was also playing for the first few months when the grind was twice as long so I could *probably* just about have had them all by this point if I was focusing on it, but I don't see them being all obtainable before the 500 - 600 hour point.
---
*PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR INTENSIFIES*
---
Alright, thanks for you answer. A bit weird that they don't just write that into the description.
---
I think that p3 Claudette should be higher than the S rank to be honest.
---
What went through your head when you thought it was a good idea to post this comment?
---
Yeah, exactly. I had one match versus a Nurse recently where an Adam with Deliverance farmed me directly in front of her twice, and then I was dead. The same day, I had a Clown who downed me right after I was unhooked &amp; then chased the unhooker and watched from afar to be sure I was picked up before I bled out so I'd have a chance. Bad killer who needs the backup to get a kill vs good killer who's confident about their abilities enough to let the survivors have fun.
---
The key (Purple and Red quality) allows you to open the hatch if its still closed.
---
The thing is the random is working like first gen ipods (i cant believe i am using apple as a good example) where the random worked so good it ended up playing mostly the same songs, bhvr should put a system like apple did where if a perk was already on the shrine each repeat reduces its chances to appear again until other perks have their chance to shine
---
Ooooooh I wanna try it now! 
---
Agreed
---
Running small game does not completely counter NOED. If you get chased the whole game and cannot cleanse all 5 totems for some reason then how does it counter it? Small game can simply *help* with the hard counter of cleansing all 5 dull totems before the endgame. 
---
Sorry, but I highly doubt that the "showing his profile on stream" thing is true, since that equals an insta ban on twitch. If just 1 person reported him for that, clip deleted or not, twitch would have found out and nuked his channel. He was never banned from twitch so eather no one reported him for that  (extremly unlikly seen how many people wach him) or it never happened
---
I'd y the killer does poorly the whole match then there are 4 people to know when to pop the last gen, be ready on exit gates, etc.  The more I see NOED in games, the more I realize it's not as big of a deal as I originally thought.
---
I thought the same thing, any movement = killer is lurking nearby. Unless I know for a fact they're chasing someone else I wouldn't go for a hook save. 
---
Big agree. 
---
Also its not fun to be trapped, its not fun to be chainsawed, its not fun to die basically... He shouldn't be avoided during chase (frenzy) the entire concept of the legion is a survivor with great mobility and no lethal power. You may think its not fun but there are a lot of things in this game that isn't fun to play against (for even the majority of a playerbase), I'll keep my opinion that its too soon to judge if he's OP or trash.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im0i7JDJ-cI

Says nothing to elude him (goes off and falsely claims that i called him a bitch and gets offended by something that i never said and then by him confirming that i called him a bitch confirms the fact that he did get offended by something i never said) point proven but like i said its all there unless you deleted it or edited it witch i don't doubt most people do because they can't prove their wrong but me and you both know you misunderstood and got upset and now i am calling you a bitch ;) congrats on getting offended because you can't read. 
---
God this is cringe. 
---
Iron Will, Distortion, Urban Evasion, We'll Make It 
---
That's only with well coordinated SWF groups. With the change to ranks 20-15 pushing everyone to higher ranks comes the problem of a lot more unexperienced teammates at high ranks that don't coordinate very well. 
---
Its probably the best map for her but don't strain yourself she can actually traverse through both levels with ease! And. I dont have to look in corners when the survivors need to fix those wacky generators epic gamer
---
"Doing gens, you?"
---
Spirit?
---
Clown and Spirit, too. 
---
Honestly the more you play the less chances you get something from the shrine, i will take that as a sign of progress 
---
Solo's can work easily as a team together, it's not uncommon at all. You are almost surely going to come across 3 or 4 dull totems in an average game and that's just you. Nevermind what the other 3 see. Take the 12 seconds and break them. If NOED activates in a match that's on the survivor side 100%. NOED is one of the least threatening perks if you actually pay attention.
---
The Camp-off? 
---
You are spot on with your Legion placement though.
---
Actually good reply, downvote to hell
---
When the killer is Freddy so you keep working anyway
---
Thank you kind sir 
---
in the description says there are 26 items, do you get them all or just the ones u mentioned?
---
people have been asking for this system since the game came out so the answer is probably no 
---
damn, that's a better title
---
You got it so wrong 
---
Also, if it's only 3 gennies done and the other guy is on his second hook or such....I can't see too many situations where you'll get the other two done for you both to get out.
---
Best case scenario a lot of times getting someone off the hook, especially if the gates aren't open, is you trade spots and they get out, you don't.
---
Yikes. I quoted you calling me a bitch because you claimed you didn't though? And the only reason I said you called me a bitch was because you literally said it yourself that you called me a bitch. You truly have no idea what you're saying do you? Please get your story straight instead of making things up as you go along because it is very confusing when you can't decide what to say. 
---
Did you just made a post about your own comment?
---
Ok. Fine then.
---
I don't really know to be honest. I think a good buff would be to just remove it completely. Survivors will generally know the killer has it without needing the little pop up notification the first time they get a skillcheck. 
---
No walugi nooo
---
I dunno I just thought the scene was ok
---
Not as bad as the “they’re like me” scene
---
schrodinger killer?
---
Spirit is in T tier because she's thicc
---
For this reason, I think killer cosmetics should be cheaper, it’s more for the survivors benefit then your own. 
---
Oh my god THAT SCENE, yeah that was the one that made me lose all faith in the movie
---
Wtf else am I supposed to spend my shards on then? 
---
Ohhh that’s why. Which makes sense why people use that over Monitor and Abuse. 
---
Uhm, I feel like you're mixing up a few things: survivors don't get notified of devour hope untill someone gets hit by Devour hope tier 3. However, we were talking about the totem not being in the game untill the killer has 2 stacks
---
Because fuck you that’s how
---
Agreed noob rank 20’s are the Bain if existence itself. Prefer killer too :)
---
Smh okay then because someone is actively following this 1:1 conversation on a post about 2 weeks old. For the love of God please sort yourself out, you make little to no sense and your argument is invalid. 
---
I hated that scene but I liked the movie overall, it’s better than JP3
---
The new patch introduced a ton of glitches, that most likely was another one of them.
---
Jfc I was just messing around lol...did the killer DC in your streamers games?
---
*Frank's Mixtape is S++
---
FTFY
---
rage is nothing but a crutch for new killers and regeneration is insane with the dead hard swf meta 
---
"I'm edgy and people want to hear it."
---
Doing gens, you? 
---
Yeah but I think the main concern is well coordinated SWF groups with voice coms. 
---
Please delete 
---
Load Command: TTVStreamer/MyPC/Drones/RunNPC.exe/Script009887/TextLine/"Legionsucks"/
---
I mean then who's upvoting me and downvoting you it would have to be at least 2 people btw hi other person thanks for the help dude lol
---
Can you blame them?
---
Pretty much all of the worst games are SWF bullshit. If you are willing to spend the time to dodge them all you'll be allowed to have a lot more fun. 
---
This is what they say when they don't release the healing changes, when they fuck the game by forcing out DLCs early, by creating Legion, by not fixing the trapper bugs, by...
---
Survivor cosmetics lol 
---
I did the screenshot, just didn't know what the map was called, I should take more notice XD  Why, is the hatch usually down there?!  
---
The same reason people spend cosmetics in *any* FPS. To look cool.
---
Overwatch releases new cosmetics every event and people are always hyped. Granted, some Legendaries have new voice lines and such but even those are minuscule changes.
---
People want to *look* cool even if they can't see it themselves.
---
The biggest problem with Spies now is that whenever youre in a chase you get a CONSTANT spamming of bird notifications. Its actually kinda silly :)
---
I think they should tone it down a bit when youre right on top of someone. Its like, "thanks crows, I found em. You can shut up now." 
---
Yeah dude you keep telling yourself i make no sense because me explaining it 5 times and 2 times step by step with proof means i make no sense HHAHAHA later man i would call this one a gg ez btw ur a bitch and this time im calling you one D:
---
&gt;why do survivors know the killer has huntresses lullaby before the killer has hooked anyone?
---
Sorry I was replying to huntress lullaby not devour hope? I'm a little confused here
---
Nah only one Claudette. I tend to tunnel them first as they’re slippery and hard to find. She made it super easy tho by tea bagging and not running away. Made me think she was cheating or hacking as she came back from the dead. Someone should tell the entity “NO REFUNDS! (Even on Claudettes)
---
Intimidation. There is nothing more terrifying than running away from a Russian woman wearing the bloody, dripping skull of a bear. 
---
Ok lets see. I can buy cosmetics for something I only see in the login screen or in some ingame animations.
---
Or... I can buy something that I dont even play to begin with. 
---
I disagree.
---
You have no upvotes and I only have 1 downvote (from you)... Seriously dude are you sure you're okay? 
---
Just from the last two days I can tell you that totems are indeed more hidden. I'm not 100% if they have implemented the line of sight check yet, but totems can be tucked away more now. For example inside the killer shack now a totem can spawn behind a box next to the door where as before it was right out in the open against the wall
---
I got hooked right on top of the hatch once while the other survivor, who had led him to me, huddled behind an obstacle. The killer didn't notice him and walked away looking for the other guy.
---
Dude had been just schmupping around all game, and obviously he wasn't saving me now, so I held on for dear life while he hovered on the hatch. The killer came back, spotted him, and chased him around and around for the entire duration of my hook timer, before finally downing him and carrying away right near the end.
---
The salt was real that day.
---
Hello there
---
I think they are working on their net-code in the background preparing for the new matchmaking and eventually dedicated servers, so there may have been some changes that were in the PTB but never made it to the release.
---
YOU KNOW, thinking about it, I think I might do that with Legion/Legion's knife, too.
---
&gt;Dont’ miss out The Moonrise Event starting on January 30th to February 13th. For more information, check out the event showcase livestream on Twitch at 2PM EST #DeadbyDaylight
---
I was hoping for either today or tomorrow...
---
Where's Spirit? Also...  
---
**WHERE'S MY BIG CLOWNY BOY, YOU HACK FRAUD?**
---
Not really. You're only "ruining" the game for yourself. Like people who used BP generators. I had a friend who gave himself literally millions. He hasn't been banned. It's been a year. Hacks, yes. But not exploits. Exploits are Dev oversights. Remember Tinkerer 2 billy? Sloppy wraith? The clown reload bug? Nobody got banned for that. 
---
I had to dc because the the killer was afk and I had the same bug :/ super frustrating
---
Ahhhhh, okay. I was confused with the terror radius thing.
---
&gt;and a gray strand of hair
---
...Only one?
---
End game Freddy isn't bad with blood warden, remember me, noed, and another perk of your choosing. 
---
You seem to like the idea of a sneaky Freddy, which can also work well. Monitor &amp; Abuse is really the only perk required for that. It's his add ons that help make him sneakier. 
---
Personally, a slug build works well when I do that. Since you can always see people on the ground in dream state. So like, nurse's calling, knockout, sloppy butcher, and then another perk of your choosing?
---
You have a lot of freedom with Freddy. It all depends on how you want to play him. He actually has a lot of different play styles that can work. 
---
Well if it was going to happen this week it would have started yesterday. I'm sorry it's later than you wanted though!
---
Nothing like chasing someone as a blue screaming Japanese schoolgirl
---
Yikes downvotes for no reason. Yeah the point of this discussion was for people to add points to both sides yet nobody actually did that. :/
---
Is unrelenting considered bad? I thought it seems helpful 
---
Of course this gets upvoted even though it's overused and not funny.
---
His “lullaby” doesn’t have specific volume based on distance for the mindgame. But Freddy is weak in chases that’s the balance. 
---
Dat huntress deadlifting !!!
---
Her traps are constantly looking in your direction when they are popped, so literally all the hag player has to do is teleport and swing, the trap is already auto aiming for you...
---
Afaik, his nursey rhyme range is 32m, and he can't sleep you from that far away.
---
Oh I see. Yeah, that's why I said it, the hatch spawns right there 80% of the time. Unless you're me.
---
I can't find this outfit, there are only three new skins and neither of them are this one
---
I honestly didn't realise I switched the topic to huntress lullaby, I'm so sorry. I also figuered out why it shows up: failed skill checks have a bigger penalty with huntresses lullaby
---
IIRC they don't ban people on consoles, or very rarely do so
---
It’s not that bad, but I don’t want it if I could have bbq, ruin, brutal, myc, sf, etc.
---
I was making fun of the fact you said 'buff' when talking about something that would clearly be a nerf. That was the whole point. 
---
they cant ban on console, thats up to Sony/microsoft
---
Yeah that's kinda my problem with him, he's incredibly good at forcing chases but terrible at finishing them, and looping a freddy for 6 minutes straight is kinda bleh.
---
"sometimes"
---
Thats my SWF group. Still so much goes on in a match, it's easy to forget to mention the totem count. 
---
That me :)
---
hey guys do you think we can stop these low quality cringe memes down the road?
---
And get a 360, ok. More downvotes pls
---
I doubt that. I've had this issue happen to me a few times prior to this patch. Most likely a lag/desync issue.
---
I actually like playing against Freddys. Nine times out of ten, they're bad and it's an easy game lol. 
---
I see what you mean, but that dream state transition sort of acts like the Wraith's bell, just even more forgiving. It gives you seven seconds to get away from him by jumping through a window or vaulting a pallet or whatever. 
---
Would they even be able to detect this assuming you didn't unlock any achievements suspiciously close together e.g. unlock Prestige 2 and then Prestige 3 achievement shortly after?
---
I'VE NEGLECTED MY SURVIVORS LATELY AND MY RANK IS LOW AND I CAN'T GET IT HIGHER BECAUSE KILLERS *KEEP DAMN QUITTING*
---
NURSE LOSES FIRST CHASE? QUIT
---
LEATHERFACE MISSES A HIT? QUIT
---
SPIRIT SEES ME BLOW UP HAUNTED GROUND? QUIT. (FUCKING WHYYYYYYY!!!??!?!?!?!?!?!?/intensifies)
---
I JUST WANT MY MID TIER RANK BACK GODDAMMIT
---
Wraith can completely silence his bell and suppress his TR and stain for 6 seconds after becoming visible. You'll always hear Freddy coming and have at least a 3 second warning that your God mode is being disabled.
---
Yeah I thought you were funny but apparently i cant post an image if it has my comment in it
---
Haha don't worry I get it. And yeah I forgot about that with huntresses lullaby so I guess it makes sense to have it there.
---
They look super cool, man. There's some that are useful, like the Spirit's updos vs her crazy hair that sticks out &amp; makes you super trackable, but mostly they just look cool. Idk. I buy lootboxes during Overwatch holiday events for Legendary skins for the same reason I buy killer skins: IM STYLIN'
---
You don't need to prep loops. You place the trap at the loop while looping the survivor. The survivor is forced to go somewhere else or take a hit after setting off said trap.. Basically there is no down time for hag like trapper has.
---
When the killer is chasing someone else, gets a hit on someone else as soon as you unhook. This fits my scenarios perfectly.
---
At least you had the decency to not say “I wAs Tday YeArS oLD” 
---
It becomes a problem when chasing someone though. There are better, more effective perks to use than guaranteed wake ups. 
---
Just because that wraith build is also bullshit doesn't mean that freddy is badly designed lol.
---
It's the Jason Todd kinda Strand.
---
Seriously.
---
I disagree, I think it was really unbearable as a whole. It was my least favorite movie last year, not to say that JP3 was ant better
---
Altered game files, even just character portraits or perk icons, can be detected by EAC and result in an auto ban. That said, it's very rare that it happens. Still not worth the risk, imo.
---
Yeah I guess sometimes but even a simple 'has anyone cleansed totems' or an offhand 'I'm cleansing a totem' will bring about everyone saying how many they've cleansed and where they've seen one, etc. 
---
2 weeks, not bad at all!
---
Same lol. I'm usually pleading out loud to please pop that generator now.. Now... Now... Right now! Lol xD.
---
Nice one, thanks for the tip :)
---
So it does work? Devs pls fix. This is huge, I don't want boosted addons monkeys being any more of an issue 
---
Not really. He had a lot of viewers when he played For Honor and was big in the For Honor community so idk where you got that information from.
---
I don't understand how a clientside thing like skillchecks would be affected by network. It doesn't seem to, and honestly shouldn't be affected by network. It doesn't make sense.
---
Thanks BHVR, am on holiday and I get back a few days into the event so I can grind!
---
I assume you're all about being with teammates, with a speed perk, stealth perk, AND bond, so a good choice would be Leader. If you aren't the team player, then any other meta perk: adrenaline, iron will, WMI, etc. A personal choice of mine (while definitely not meta) is Autodidact or Deliverance, since both encourage team-play. Self-Care and Auto, while I don't personally run it, works wonders, especially against Sloppy Butcher. Auto especially can be good if you're a team player, and Deliverance if you're the lone wolf.
---
Oh, really? Oops I wasn't aware; English isn't my mother tongue sadly.
---
You've got a good point, plus I suppose it at least makes for a more interesting conversational topic, haha. And hey, it's at least in a spot where I get to decide how to style it rather than it just sitting there :D
---
^
---
Reddit cuts it off ¯\_(0_0)_/¯
---
Prestiging gets you bloodied cosmetics.
---
It also (allegedly) increases the chances for higher rarity items in your bloodwebs.
---
Starts on the 30th, and ends on the 13th of February. 
---
Ok but do you actually still get perks at lvl 50?
---
I love Remember Me, BBQ, Sloppy Butcher and Brutal Strength.
---
Strong all around pressure as Freddy is heavily enhanced by wasting survivors time as much as possible.
---
ITT people that take the shrine wayyyyy to seriously. 
---
You are not entiteld BBQ or whatever other perk you want. The shine is a bonus, nothing more. Play game, grind for the perks you want. If you get lucky in the shrine, good for you. 
---
The shrine doesnt affect the meta in the slightest. Every regular player has had these perks forever, and yet every week we get these dad joke posts about it. Were not suddenly gonna see a huge increase in Urban Evasion because its in the shrine this week. 
---
I appreciate these posts but holy crap some of these responces. 
---
I can think of an entire group of people! Dwight, Claudette, Jake, Meg...a few others..
---
Nope. I’ve gotten plenty of hits and going over the hole really isn’t that hard at all. You can even switch it up by pretending to swing and then going for the actual survivor hit. It’s also a nice shortcut to get a quicker hit on the survivor if there’s no pallet
---
Doesn't DC also count? 
---
Yes you can.
---
The point of prestige is for the bloody cosmetics, achievements and the rarity of items in bloodweb increase. Personally on my survivors I barely see any difference between a p3-50 bloodweb and a normal level 50 bloodweb but people insist it's significant on killers.
---
Two events back to back? Highly doubtful
---
How about you earn em ey
---
OMG ITS OK HUN JUST DISCONNECT XX
---
Agreed. I called him a tunneler in one of his streams and my Message Box on Twitch had a whiner calling me names. Like...wtf lol I wasn't lying.
---
That's what's I'm trying to do 
---
Maybe have NOED not be a Hex perk. Make it:
---
NOED: For every dull totem on the map when all gens are completed, gain a token. Consume a token upon hitting a survivor, who will be insta downed.
---
Make it so that it only checks at the beginning, same as Remember Me.
---
That's the best solution I've come across so far. Every time I get into a hatch standoff, it's a stalemate until the either side gets bored and lets the other win.
---
This is truly a beautiful video. 
---
THANKS I'M CRY
---
Yes. 
---
When you unlock every perk for a character the bloodweb will still refresh with items, addons and offerings.
---
I love playing as and against Freddy. The Dream World can be a real pain to deal with and really runs survivors for their money if applied as much as possible.
---
Got you, fair enough 
---
Yes. Level 50 will regenerate infinitely. So basically you can level up forever, it will just never be called “level 51.”
---
I normally do, but it was late and I just wanted a fun match
---
Yeah, it's just a hopes and dreams thing. People have wanted a Valentine's event for a while and I'd like one too.
---
So just because I said this comment, OP started berating me in Reddit chat and saying I was a dick.
---
Nice going OP. 
---
Overcharge. That’s it.
---
I prefer to look at this as if it’s somebody cosplaying Huntress, not actually her. 
---
Darn! Regardless - the Platinum is definitely something to be proud of. :D
---
I think you’re thinking of the old one where you smack the hay in the other window sending you flying up? They fixed it a long time ago but perhaps you’re thinking of that one. If not, I’ve never seen this trick before so it’s pretty cool
---
Prestiging is really just for clout. You can definitely get perks at level 50, but you have to have perks to *get.* If you have every perk maxed for, say Jake, and every base perk, you need teachables. If you have Sabo, Calm Spirit, and Iron Will, plus all base perks (things like Lightweight, Plunderer's, WMI) maxed, you won't get any other perks, until you get teachables (bond, empathy, adrenaline, etc.)
---
I'VE BEEN PLAYING KILLER WITHOUT LUNGING FOR TWENTY FIVE HOURS!
---
The only thing you should feel bad for is NOED. 
---
Regardless this is hilarious lol
---
I got ‘Rainbow Map’ without using Plunderer Instinct or luck offering. 
---
Sadly, one cunt just DC at the beginning of the match. And shitty killer (with lagging) camped me til I die.
---
Your English is excellent given it's not your mother tongue! :D
---
And yeah, let's think positively about it!
---
Why on killers? For the add-ons?
---
Right. So are niggers.
---
Im glad you scrubbed out the City badge 
---
Why thank you my good sir
---
I wouldn't even say that. Nurse is damn near unplayable on console.
---
You aren't earning them by asking for follows lol. 
---
Put out good content and make yourself known as a solid player and good person in your region and follows will come 
---
Do good deeds, be kind to chat and players and play as fair as you can and youll do well
---
Are you dumb? 
---
It's never too late to try
---
Welcome to the club! Congrats.
---
LMAO some other guy gets upvoted for pissing on the nea is a killer meme while I get downvoted. Doesn't matter though, because downvotes = upvotes in my book
---
dude what the fuck is this even? how is this subreddit this terrible?
---
As a killer main, some survivors make me REALLY glad I'm not a survivor main.
---
This guy is one of them.
---
Your username says enough about you, so there's really no point in me saying anything here
---
Where is my girl spirit 
---
BHVR can’t do anything when it comes to console users. Especially PS4. Sony won’t allow it.
---
Some people think that Meg did something to  anger the Michael so if you guys want to see the full game it lasted like 6 min and you can find it [here](https://youtu.be/5oj-wAn2REo). The game literally just started so I don’t think she did anything
---
They didn't change it after? I remember reading it would be faster to use self heal instead if being healed by somebody else
---
That's not true anymore then?
---
everybody complained the sabo meta was boring because getting slugged is boring
---
That's why survs have an easier time against her on console.
---
Wow. Racism. Cool.
---
Also Up The Ante now affects chests. My item hunter build is:
---

Up the Ante
---
Ace in the Hole
---
Get a purple item like 90 percent of the time
---
TRY ESTABLISHING A FEW TIMES THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY PHASING &amp; FOLLOWING THEM, THEN BREAK PATTERN.
---
Getting slugged?
---
Judging by that comment you have very little understanding of Nurse and English. 
---
Happened to me last night. The guilt was just too much. 
---
For add-ons and higher chance of moris. The killers that don't have ultra rare add-ons (Hillbilly, Nurse and Leatherface) get more ebony moris from it, I believe.
---
put into the dying state and left on the ground until bled out instead of hooking
---
If they don't search for you, then the other survivors can heal you and it's exactly the same as the hook .
---
Add spirit in S and this would be accurate 100%
---
That's true. Like I said, hopes and dreams. Nothing to take seriously.
---
With items like these kills should have access to the higher rarity items in the bloodwep just like the event.
---
In one game I got 2 rainbow maps and a purple medkit with an instaheal.
---
Another game I got 2 dull keys and a skeleton key.
---
Plundering has never been better.
---
Arguing with you is like talking to a brick wall. You just keep doubling back and changing your arguments. If you dont care about killers camping, then why do you keep saying stuff that says otherwise? Your second paragraph just goes to show how mindlessly ignorant you actually are. Apparently im terrible at the game and apparently i rage everytime some teabags. Both things absolutely false but you can keep assuming whatever you want if it satisfies your feeble little chimpanzee mind.
---
Meh, it was a shitty one anyway. It's because some people have pointed out the Spirit looks nice underneath her skirt, so I decided to refer to that :P
---
Since the beta and beginning it was always "Not safe" why people started to change its meaning, I will never understand.
---
If it's a flag, it's probably the flag of Mali, an african country so I looked up for some african monsters. And one that actually coresspond with the "next killer is the oldest one we have" is the [Adze](https://vampireunderworld.com/african-vampires/adze/). Vampire with a twist, he can possess humans and has the form of a firefly at first (but that's kinda weird). When he's caught he turns himself into human form, which is something the community asked over and over again. But I think they said they wouldn't do that, not sure about it though.
---
What is the difference between playing against him on console and on pc? Genuine question.
---
Fuck that was satisfying.
---
This just happened to me while playing killer too
---
Why the hell would you post this!? You just screwed us dedicated plunders. :(
---
Nope,  they abandoned the changes after seeing the "-25% to all healing" version in action on the PTB.
---
However, they did say on the dev stream they like the idea of a perk like that, and are potentially considering adding it in as a General survivor perk, and keep the current self-care as Claudette's teachable. They value the concept of having a choice on if you want to be able to self-heal and what you trade off to do so.
---
how can an thread be delicious? u mean like a thread that u use for sewing??? how is it taste delicious??
---
Adam maybe 
---
Nono, if the survivor DCs, it still gets thrown on to the match pile. Let's say 2 DC's happen and you kill the last 2 survivors, you get the adept achievement. DC'ing kills your character, and takes you out of the trial.
---
Poor Bill, he's definitely in Hell now.
---
I don’t think he was expecting me lol
---
IN MY IDEAL WORLD, YOUD GET LIKE 3 SECONDS ON THE HOOK IF EVERYONE ELSE IS DEAD. ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE WOULDNT DECREASE THE BAR, SO YOU CAN EITHER SIT THERE FOR A FEW SECONDS BEFORE BEING INSTAKILLED OR GET A FEW ATTEMPTS BEFORE INSTAKILL. 
---
THIS WOULD BARELY AFFECT THE GAME, BUT WOULD LEAD TO THE LAST SURVIVOR NOT BEING NECESSARILY FUCKED. IF YOU KOBE OFF AND THE KILLER MISTIMED THE ATTACK/YOU DH, ALL THE SUDDEN HATCHES ARE FAIR GAME, NEARBY WINDOWS AND PLLETS ARE FAIR GAME, AND THE KILLER WOULD NEED TO BE MORE STRATEGIC WITH THE LAST HOOK (JUST BARELY THOUGH). 
---
IDK IF ITD BE A GREAT CHANGE FOR THE GAME, BUT ITD FEEL LESS DUMB THAN AN INSTA SACRIFICE. AT THE VERY LEAST YOU SHOULD GET ALL THE POINTS YOUD GET FOR STRUGGLING IF YOURE THE LAST ONE
---
Might I then recommend "Last Year: the nightmare" as this extremely toxic community as a whole isn't going anywhere
---
I played a game of pig yesterday got 2 kills with 2 gens left and couldn't fing the last 2 Meg started knocking down pallets to show me the p3 Claudette crouched in the corner by the tree waiting for the Meg to die
---
She DCed when me and Meg started Tbagging her 
---
Go, slow, stop?
---
Because before hook didn't respawn, so the killers response was not to hook survivors. Waiting up to 4 minutes on the ground doing nothing is really boring. And you don't even have the option to kill yourself if needed. Trust us if we say this is really boring.
---
Ah! Well I do like the overall aesthetic of the outfit and it is pretty funny they gave her underwear instead of leaving it as bandages :P
---
The only improvement I would wish for is that the socks were a little longer. Gotta love that zettai ryouiki ;) 
---
By that point, I shoulda had Adept Legion weeks ago.
---
Has there been any good rework suggested?
---
I got Adept Legion because of a DC somehow, odd.
---
The word you’re looking for is “streak” of hair, not strand.

---
Is it bad that my only criticism of the outfit is about how the underwear changed the shape of her butt? :P
---
It looks better in the original outfit IMO, but it still looks nice xD
---
Exactly lol
---
Infinite loading screen is the scariest
---
Human eye can’t see that fast anyways, get gud n00b
---
"Needs to Ripen", "Ah, now that's a good banana", "That's a tomato Maurice".
---
Does this annoy you?
---
S+ and S are ok for me, it starts getting bad at A with Doctor tbh.
---
Actually that's a fair point but I know that underwear can do that. As long as it's still nice that's all that matters? lol
---
Photoshopped.
---
You think that because your tiny little mind can’t fathom my very simple point. I haven’t changed my argument at all. I’m doubling back because you have mental retardation and can’t understand words. 
---
I’m saying squatting isn’t toxic. No matter what the people here say it’s not. It poses zero change to the game except making idiots like you angry. 
---
Camping is a shitty strategy that makes the game harder for killers and shittier for survivors. I don’t care about it, because it’s one match. My entire life doesn’t revolve around a single game like it does to you. 
---
You are terrible at the game. The vitriol that keeps pouring out of your mouth is proof of that. I’m fully aware that I can assume what I want, I don’t have a severe mental condition like you do. 
---
That’s as simple as my point can be. If you still don’t get it, there’s just no helping you. Now fuck off, I’ve done my work with the less fortunate for the day. 
---
I only play Wraith and Freddy ;(
---
I have like 50 hours on killer, the rest of my 250 hours are survivor.
---
I do have 800 hours on the loading screen tho
---
Whoops! Poor Legion.
---
Maybe it's a console thing?
---
just tried it on my alt account and it indeed works. welcome to infinite moris everyone
---
Yeah, I didn't expect BHVR to give the Spirit some red thong or anything... 
---
...but maybe I was hoping for it.
---
No I made this myself, I just legit forgot to add in Spirit's face icon.
---
I've not seen this bug, can you give more info on it or do you have any clips/pics?
---
 This problem needs to be posted
---
[https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/)
---
There's a big fuss in Japan
---
There's many people using this glitchs for "2 days"
---
need rollback
---
I HATE IT TOO, BUT IF SOMEONES UNHOOKED IN MY FACE IM GONNA DOWN THE INJURED SURVIVOR. ADVANCES MY GAME AND DENIES THE BAD TEAMMATE FREE ALTRUISM POINTS. 
---
I DONT FEEL GREAT ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT PUNISHES THE VICTIM MORE THAN THE PERPETRATOR, BUT SERIOUSLY AFTER ONCE OR TWICE OF THAT HAPPENING IN A GAME PEOPLE SHOULD REALIZE THAT THEY SHOULDNT DO THAG
---
The only counterplay that exists, lol. 
---
Lol this guy is an idiot. 
---
I really hate her backstory.  
---
Yea it’s obviously and evil traffic light 😉
---
Hahah yeah, it's true. We don't want DBD to become the Fortnite of asymmetrical games, full of screaming kids with flashy clothes (though my pink Claudette looks like a lighthouse in the dark).
---
Called it
---
What actually happened is Freddy was able to escape with the other survivor and left the Nea with only 2 kills.
---
Perhaps you should know your over you’re before you make YOUR claims buddy. 
---
No, you’re right though. You’re right, to be honest I thought you were that 12 year old idiot further down I allowed myself to get involved in a shit flinging contest with. Sorry for being a dick to you. 
---
Swap Doc and Clown around
---
noo frank please don't hurt yourself from that steep steep fall
---
I PLAY FUCKING DBD ON A SHET PC. SO I KEEP THE GAME ON THE LOWEST QUALITY AND RESOLUTION. BUT SOMEHOW IN THE NEW UPDATE SCRATCH MARKS ARE FAINT AS HELL ON LOW QUALITY SO I LOOSE CHASES ALL THE GOD DAMN TIME.
---
Yet again the survivors get everything while the killer doesnt get a jack shit
---
A good 2/3 of Myers players on PS4 are facecampers who hard tunnel like this, in my experience.
---
IF YOU CAN SWING IT, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BUY LEATHERFACE FOR BBQ. HES NOT ALWAYS THE MOST FUN, AND FAR FROM THE STRONGEST, BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT YOULL ENJOY HAVING BBQ. 
---
IF I DONT CARE ABOUT WINNING, I PLAY MAX BP DOC AND GET AN INSANE AMOUNT OF BP PER HOUR. 
---
IT SUCKS THAT YOU HAVE TO SPEND $5 ON LF, BUT DO *NOT* BE ONE OF THE CHUMPS ON REDDIT THAT COMPLAINS ABOUT NO BBQ IN THE SHRINE EVERY WEEK IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE DISPOSABLE INCOME. YOULL BE MUCH HAPPIER IN THE LONG RUN. 
---
Up the ante doesn't affect items you get out of chests.
---
true
---
Basement strat leatherface is basically the only leatherface strat that works.
---
WHEN I PLAY SURVIVOR DOC ALWAYS FINDS ME. 
---
WHEN I PLAY DOC I NEVER FIND PEOPLE LATER ON. 
---
IVE COME TO REALIZE IM THE ISSUE
---
The original drawing is from u/ZherronVorse
---
mori best than nea? no way
---
“What does this mean for me??” XD
---
It's funny because on PS4 I'm pretty sure it means come save me, not killer is camping me 
---
I mean you can’t escape legion, that’s what I would argue. You will get downed by him and franks mixtape shortens that time significantly. There is also a zero skill requirement to use this effectively.
---
Readhead pinky finger - you can easily avoid this one to be honest.
---
Double windstorm - this was actually patched out of the game.
---
Prayer beads - this is can spook you for sure, but you can easily tell when she’s in spirit form by leaving her body behind. She also can only track you in spirit form if you are leaving scratch marks so just don’t.... especially when you realize she has it. 
---
Iridescent heads- this is honestly very frustrating when mixed with the add-on that gives you +2 hatchets. However it is dodgeball at the very least. A skilled huntress will rough you up.
---
Went to post the fungoose big brain sticker from twitch and I forgot I can't access it outside of twitch.
---
Jake or Dwight. Jake mainly for Iron Will as I really enjoy that one of his. The other two perks are alright. And Dwight's overall are pretty good. 
---
this doc omg
---
DOC IS MY HIGHEST WINRATE KILLER, BUT I STILL FUCKING HATE SURVIVING AGAINST HIM
---
I would think so. I don't think there'd be any other contenders. 
---
I know its mean, but sometimes I can't resist killing myself on the hook when there are 2 players urban evading around the map doing nothing and the guy closest to me has had his face smashed into the nearest try for the last minute because he isn't entirely convinced the killer is gone.
---
How was he being edgy in any way? The Nea Killer meme is extremely overused and can be really unfunny, especially if it's so low effort
---
Played with Plunderer's for a daily. First chest was a Skeleton Key. Second chest was a Brown medkit.
---
Opened the second chest after everyone had died because I couldn't find the hatch for the life of me. :^)
---
Means the charges last longer. 
---
I THINK THEY SHOULD KEEP THE LEGION CHANGES IN THE PTB FOR NOW AND TRY REMOVING FRANK’S MIXTAPE. OR AT LEAST CHANGE HOW IT WORKS. RIGHT NOW, I COMMONLY SEE PEOPLE SAY FRANKS WAS THE ISSUE WITH THE CHANGES SO CHANGING THAT SO LEGION COULD BE VIABLE WOULD BE COOL. 
---
IMPORTANT NOTE: YA BOY IS A CONSOLE PEASANT AND SO I DONT KNOW HOW WELL THAT WOULD WORK BECAUSE I COULDNT PLAY THE PTB
---
I’ve had several games where this happens to me on the hook with Myers. The guy in this video is probably the worst though
---
I agree with you 100%. The Nea is a killer meme is overused and it's really unfunny, especially when it's so low effort
---
I was going to upvote this but Clown worse than Wraith????????????
---
And Trapper higher than Clown??????????
---
I had a survivor pissed that he was left out from working on the gens together because the 3 spots were all taken so when the killer came he tried to open the locker I was in to signify that someone is in there and ran away. The salt in this game is real lol
---
Yes. Survivors were:Nea, Claudette, Meg and Bill. 
---
I know that and that sucks. But when a killer shuts off their connection externally. It removes survivors items and offerings and doesn't give any bp.
---
I've been waiting for monitor and abuse :(
---
When you realize you’ve made a mistake so you turn to being a grammar nazi online where next to no one gives a shit lmao. 
---
Anyways, have a good day man. 
---
I sobbing, I'm love him
---
I teabag facecampers. It's free salt
---
I would've put pig and maybe clown higher than wraith but idk
---
That is "The secret cave" (Where he rapes kids) 
---
*Takes notes furiously and immediately attempts in game.*
---
Hey peter griffin here, to explain another meme. You see survivors (me included) will often look away from the gen for the killer, but as soon as a look away, Myers sneaks up and grabs me! I must say this meme really made me LOL (laugh out loud). Cya next epic meme, this is peter griffin, signing off
---
This meme is so old it's saying that Legion is worse than Freddy.
---
I got mostly yellow and brown meds and toolkits. One red key. 
---
Just sit around in the lockers upstairs until you know killer is busy picking someone up on the other end of the map.
---
On a side note, would it be more economical to wait for Hex: Ruin on shrine or save up for Hag and then start power leveling.
---
Needs more Russian T H I C C N E S S 
---
Other than that great art.
---
i would give anything for this to happen on my bubba
---
Jumpscare Myers strikes again.
---
What good timing to be laid off from work, and to have lots free time now
---
Territorial imperative
---
Insidious
---
Make your choice
---
(Whatever the shitty basement perk is called)
---
The calculated AFK plays. 
---
It's not, you can do it on PC.
---
I'm in agreement here. JP3 will always be, in my opinion, the worst installment not only in the Jurassic Park franchise but any franchise period.
---
I liked Fallen Kingdom but it is by no means the best movie in the franchise.
---
Guess who’s abusing this.

Sometimen’t*
---
Some say there's actually a game in this bug
---
I'm on PC and the second didn't seem to work for me, it kind of did but it didn't give me the perk. The perk was still leveling up but it wasn't in my inventory after.
---
Spies is good rn since it just got buffed ppl arent expecting it
---
I'm saving all my scratched and vanity mirrors so I can be the proper amount of spooky. 
---
JP3 was the worst yes
---
Fallen kingdom was good but not great I agree
---
That's nuts.
---
I bet everyone would love facing them.
---
Wheels and gimmick builds, but what keeps the most of is the *GRIND*
---
2.4k hours and yea, it's definitely down to "made-up" games on the survivor side.
---
It's all about gimmicky perk builds. Like Plunderer's Instinct/ Pharmacy / Ace In the Hole / Sprint Burst. Get to be an item delivery monkey for the rest of the team. And sometimes you get to pull crazy shit like unexpected key or insta-heal plays depending on how good RNG is. 
---
Or maybe it's something as simple as "I'm going to use Autodidact until it fucking makes a positive difference in a game god damn it". Followed by like 20 games where I should have used Botany/We'll Make It but I was too stubborn to switch. 
---
On the Killer side I don't get quite as bored of the normal gameplay. But Scratched Mirror Myers / Paintbrush Freddy on Lery's or The Game is always a fun time to break any tedium.
---
I predict a roll back of some sort, unless they've changed their ban policy, as they only used to temp ban for exploits (I'm assuming they still do).
---
You make a fair point. I forgot about that. For some reason I was convinced it usually happened around Wednesday.
---
Events from this year have started Tuesdays, Thursdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and then Monday. WTF. 
---
We'll make it if you like to do alot of hook saves
---
No Mi-ther
---
Wow that's really weird. I've seen the bug where the opposite happens (game thinks you're still in when you've DC'd) but not this.
---
Chase a survivor to an unsafe pallet and mindgame them by blinking 3 times on the same side and watch as they vault the pallet right into your arms. Alternatively, you blink to opposite sides of the pallet 2x and on the 3rd blink you stay same side. Yes, it is a bit circumstantial but not like evil incarnate with its many variables like survivor dc's and locker plays
---
Since beta it was always a "Camping! Don't come! Not safe!" why it suddenly I blame on streamers and their fans who then proceeded to change its meaning so now we have a half and half mix of meanings. 
---
No MY-ther
---
Haha I’m with you, this game has so many mechanics I feel like I’m too high of a rank considering how little I know. 
---
I got to rank 12 on Huntress before I realized you could lunge or charge up your hatchets 
---
People who play bright Claudettes have big dick energy, honestly. Playing the stealthiest character in the loudest clothes is such a power move.
---
I AM POINTING OUT THAT THING HEHEHEHEHE
---
i agree haha
---
Universal? Like "DC 3 times"? "Be toxic for 120 seconds"?
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeee
---
As a Britbong, can confirm.
---
Played plunderer's and Ace in the hole. Got a brown medkit with butterfly tape, a yellow toolbox with a grip wrench and scraps and a map with milky glass. In 1 game. It really hasn't done me a good service so far. 
---
You need all the big dick energy with so many hot Killers and Survivors in this game ;)
---
makes 2 of us
---
That's the entire point of these rituals. You're supposed to get curious and have an incentive to play the other 50% of the game.
---
Having universal challenges would completely defeat the reason these things exist.
---
The legion one should be easy and if you've got discordance on your piggy you can get that done in one game too. 
---
Hahahaha I love that. Those are my favorite games - no sign of hope cause others aren’t doing gens, and then finding a key and being like PEACE OUT 
---
i second that
---
This was deconfirmed a while back. Unless it came with Patch 2.5.0, it hasn't happened.
---
best response ngl
---
Legions first two hits are 100% confirmed though. You CAN’T dodge them. I would dc as soon as I saw that.
---
When you right, you right ;)
---
I'm in love with the dwight david pic you drew. Took me a second to figure out the Dwight but it killed me. GJ
---
He’s cute
---
k
---
Me with kindred
---
yes plz haha
---
It’s not ugh it’s UUUUGGGGHH.
---
I think it’s to try and encourage to to branch out and try new things, I on the other hand main killer and never get survivor challenges, I think there are way more killer challenges. 
---
I do things like this;
---
Make an allturism build and do nothing but unhook and heal, I'll stop a gen if someone gets hit or hooked.
---
Make a running build just to distract killer as long as possible. Just run my ass off.
---
Play using only the perks that come with the character or killer.
---
Play a different killers and do no power runs with the exception of Freddy lol. Sometimes I'll let them do a generator and then start hunting. Just mix things up and have fun.
---
Thank you for saying that god no one has the balls to say it
---
Bro I really wanted We’re going to live forever so I could start grinding out the teachables I want. I checked the subreddit to see if there was a new post about a nice shrine of secrets but I didnt see one and I went to start leveling up David to get its teachable, and then i checked shrine after putting like 200k bp into him. I was so pissed.
---
It's a downvote from me, dawg. That Nea meme is crusty as hell.
---
200 IQ undoubtedly 
---
What do you mean? She’s there
---
console is shit compared to PC. im a console player myself but you can easily tell the difference. the controls are smoother. the frame rate is more consistent. you cant 360 and juke on console unless the killers a potato. overall the console version is inferior to PC. as much as it breaks me to say it. 
---
also it wasnt in it once last year
---
I loved the music choices lmao
---
Where is spirit? Point is it is a meme just laugh and don't question everything. 
---
Roasted dab*
---
You can pay for better programming instead of padding the accounts of the others.  It would lead to more long term viability.
---
For a moment I thought I was watching Shirtless Kylo. 
---
Oh fuck I had the idea for a perfect lithe build and I was hyped this got me bummed
---
I cant Fecking get it on leather face but i got on every other killer
---
If you're tryna unhook yourself... I'm sorry I will not save you. Hate those type of players like chill out wait a sec 
---
It's a leftover from the change they made (and scrapped) from the PTB. I don't know if the values were left behind or if it's just a text miss.
---
It came with the new patch. 
---
You only become challenges for characters you don't play that means if you only play killer you will become more survivor challenges
---
Why would you need Discordance on Pig when you already have Surveillance?
---
+8000 Boldness Points
---
With that logic, Huntress is too feral to worry about clothes in general. 
---
~~^(Naked Huntress skin when?)~~
---
They should make it activate only a fast vault and let it activate 5 seconds after a chase
---
:eyes:
---
Okay then this is a pretty serious bug.
---
Also happy Cake day.
---
Them early game dash attacks. 
---
The ”You are not getting to game fucker” is arguably most annoying one to me 
---
Yeah, this is nowhere near T H I C C enough. She's on the slimmer side, if toned, with prominent bewbs. 
---
Doesn't count as **T H I C C** in my book. 
---
Vaulted through a window a couple times so the Killer would know where I was before starting the generator. Thought they'd at least farm with me; they didn't.
---
At least I didn't bring anything that great that game I guess. :/
---
Ok, time to derank then.
---
Half the people that play would be drowning in BP if this were a thing...lol
---
Oh, vault grabs count? That makes it sound a lot of course, thought it was *just* generator grabs - the greed, the timing, actually getting a grab instead of a hit, actually having 3 blinks on and being on your third...
---
Damn for real? Most of this time I’ve been doing that animation thinking it meant no one was coming :(
---
It’s awful. I genuinely can not see anything with it on. It makes looping pretty much impossible when you can’t see their red stain properly because your screen is covered in blood 
---
Removed - Duplicate Post
---
They said they would make luck affect it but it has not been implemented yet
---
I have no clue what that was supposed to be and am very confused.
---
This is all because of the implementation of a feature nobody asked for.
---
They tested that out with the hollowed blight event. Not a good idea lol.
---
I believe its pronunciation has to do with regional dialect, I've heard it my-thur and mi-thur. Even websites that will read words for you are split on how it's pronounced. Personally i say mi-thur because my-thur just sounds weird to me.

---
It’s rare but sometimes the color of certain cosmetics can give an advantage. Mostly they’re just to look cool.
---
Pretty sure you have to escape with them item for it to count this time. If you die with it on you, the killer destroys it by default.

Devs game ban for hacking achievements so they very well may ban for this. Don't try it if you value your account.
---
I felt so bad. I think they were a new player considering they didn’t do that well the rest of the game . She managed to get a down on the David and the other survivors left so I thought I’d at least give him a chance and then the entity decided to smile down on me 
---
I feel like I see this at least twice a week.
---
It is lol, thank you! 
---
Spies is amazing on spirit imo. Makes tracking people during a chase so much easier. Only downside is when it's on the game or pale rose.
---
mori counts as well, used ebony for adept legion. got achievement. 
---
If you’re selfish don’t use it. It’s a really good perk but I wouldn’t expect someone that thinks botany is only good with self care to understand how the game works. This game is about time management and well make it saves a ton of time. Keep running urban, SB, self care and botany brotha.
---
I’ve never heard it pronounced anything other than my-ther and I live in a part of the country where people use it semi-frequently! You learn summat new every day.
---
Using dead rabbit gives me that tier 1 terror radius and by the time they hear the heartbeat I'm lunging at ya (: love it!
---
Yeah the only times I do that are if I'm with friends, I'm on my death hook and my friend isn't. Or if I'm solo its typically an accident but every once in a while it's a cry for help "hello this is my death hook and you haven't been hooked yet, help me!"
---
Hey Peter griffin here to explain another meme, this time a format, it is a scene in Jurassic World Fallen Kingom where the Indoraptor distracts the man, and then kills him. Cya later, peter griffin signing off
---
It’s a nice touch from the devs that they threw some northern English parlance into his perks. 
---
Memeing mostly, as a killer nothing makes me happier than seeing survivors shit themselves from scratched mirror myers. Sometimes its fun just to screw around and give survivors a "fun" match rather than yet another bm infested round of hate. As a survivor there is no greater moment then memeing with a friendly killer. Just watched my wife have a crouching peekaboo battle with someone testing out the pigs new buffs to her crouching, highly entertaining.

To be fair you're also playing with *that* killer. The one who ignores body-blocking teammates even though there's still two gens left.
---
That is actually disgusting :D Worst insult ever tbh. Holy shit, Scott, I'm so sorry zubSAD
---
It helps incentivize both sides to be played. Adds more killers to the killer queue
---
IIRC luck doesn't affect chest findings. Although I think it should.
---
Why the Infinity War background?
---
Behavior fixed that by making it an item that you need to escape with... not sure how I like that but at least it stops blindly farming
---

---
haddonfield is michael and laurie's map, the game is pig and tapp's. these maps got several easter eggs from the movies. 
---
The killers powers are supposed to help them or at the very least hinder survivors in some way. I’m pretty sure it’s working as intended
---
this seems really imbalanced in killer's favor 
---
Usually when people join me they stay red for like 3 seconds then spike up to green, I’m guessing this is when they’re in the loading screen, you know how many P3 Claudette’s with flashlights would be kicked if this was implemented 
---
not anymore since this week's update rip
---
I'm sorry you got laid off but I hope this cheers you up a bit.

Good luck with the future job hunt!

I'm getting salty just reading that
---
I still think the legions deranged pursuit is a lot more circumstantial
---
is this pre or post update 
---
cuz those trap boxes are pretty close to each other LOL
---
You're right, but I still think it's better than what happened during Hallowed Blight where people would collect nectar and die immediately.
---
I know, i've seen the film. The format still doesn't make sense.

---
THE BUFF WAS MEANT TO ENCOURAGE SURVIVORS TO HEAL AGAINST LEGION BY DECREASING THEIR DEEP WOUNDS TIMER IF THEY WERE INJURED WHEN LEGION HIT THEM. 
---
BY DEFAULT IT TOOK 3 FRENZY HITS TO DOWN SOMEONE, MEANING YOU COULD ENTER FRENZY, HIT THE SURVIVOR TWICE IN ONE FRENZY. RECHARGE AND DOWN THEM WITH VERY LITTLE CHANCE OF COUNTERPLAY. CONSIDERING HOW EASILY LEGION INJURES PEOPLE, IT WAS PRETTY BROKEN.
---
THE REASON FRANK'S MIXTAPE WAS OBSCENE WAS BECAUSE IT DECREASES THE AMOUNT OF HITS TO DOWN SOMEONE IN FRENZY. YOU ALREADY SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING RIGHT? YEAH, YOU COULD DOWN PEOPLE IN A **SINGLE** FRENZY.
---
LEGION *WOULD* BE A LOT BETTER WITHOUT FRANK'S MIXTAPE, BUT THERE WERE ISSUES WITH THE BUFF ANYWAY.
---
THE UPSETTING THING IS THAT IF THEY'D PAID ATTENTION TO PEOPLE'S ISSUES WITH LEGION THEY SHOULD HAVE SEEN ALL THAT COMING INSTEAD OF REALIZING AFTER THE FACT.
---
oops forgot to erase that line

---
I mean, sometimes totem spawns suck and sometimes they don't. That's the risk of running Hex perks. Spawns will probably improve gradually.
---
Again, you're right. The survivors that did that basically screwed it up for everyone else. I hated being the only person actually trying to play the game on my team.
---
Whether this is balanced or not is definitely up for debate but I'm certain it's this way to prevent that being an option for them this time. The devs shouldn't *have* to implement stuff like this but unfortunately they do.
---
That teammate is omega brain. He stayed there AFK because he knew what was going to happen.
---
Downvoted because of trollface
---
What year do you think this is
---
I decide which killer to buy and which killer to buy perks based on if I think I'll play them or not (or if all 3 perks are great I'll grab the killer). For example I wouldn't buy freddy today, I would wait and grab bloodwarden, on the other hand hag is pretty fun for me so she is worth the investment. I'm currently saving shards for killer since I think having another killer to play (for free) is more important then having a few more perks.
---
psshh waah
---
u/Kleask10 you should abandon your quest or you'll have a heart attack!
---
Oh I should inform you that you have to do it whilst you're in killer instinct mode.
---
Killer instinct is when you applied deep wounds onto somebody and it pings everybody's location in your terror radius
---
Meaning you have to apply deep wounds on to somebody make sure the deep wound bar is low enough then hit somebody else and then return back to the first person and then down and you have to do it whilst the ping effect is still going on.
---
An ability to transform into a bug might be another form of stealth Killer, but mixed with a workable version of flight. Think of an alternate version of Wraith.
---
The Adze is able to transform into a firefly. In return for not being able to interact with Survivors in his firefly state the Adze is harder to see coming and has the ability to fly overtop of objects (but can't go through solid walls and must use doors/windows to enter buildings) with a better point of view of the map by being higher up.
---
Gotta say, it's fun theory crafting Killer powers. 
---
Wraith is terrible 
---
Whenever you kicked a gen, that gen will be covered in white outline for either 16 seconds or if a survivor stops the regressing.
---
With that said, the only way you could have used the perk it is by kicking the gen, make it look like you’re leaving, then watch and see if the outline would disappear before 16 secs after kicking it.
---
That trapper, smh, the definition of tunneling. 
---
Hapened to me, sacrificed a meg on haddonfield the other day, watched her be taken by the entity even cause exit gates were open and swf was trying to save so I was camping. Downed a claudette that got too close, hooked her, meg was behind me trying to get the save.
---
Not sure what's going on, it's either a bug or a hack.
---
Oh - I get the problem now - haven't read too deep into his mechanics other than watching a few LPs yet. Yeah, 25 times, that just sounds awful.
---
I don't know either, but I think it's a bug? Wonder how it looks like from the survivor's point of view tho. 
---
I’m not sure. I think it depends whether you specifically need to repair the gen to get the 4 points, or if it’s just a team thing where anyone can do it. My guess is it’s gens as a team and you get this whether you escape or not, unlike the 20 pt thing. It also sounds like the killer needs to leave the hook in order to get their points to go destroy stuff. With it being an anti camp measure, it should keep all survivors in the game a little longer.  It’s hard to say though since I’m just speculating, it sounds much better than Hallowed Blight on the surface.
---
It’s a bug that can happen when a player dc’s. 
---
&gt;Rank 3 Plunderers has a 50% chance of upgrading the rarity of any item you pull
---
Uh, no. Where did you get that information from?
---
1 person out is a win? Are we playing the same game?
---
You can ban ppl on a specific game, like cod or gta
---
[Title had me thinking of this...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUh8pyCmEwM)
---
Go, go faster, hope there's not a cop around
---
I only do if I can literally see the killer coming this way even if they’re not in heartbeat range. Or if you unhook me like 2 seconds after heartbeat goes away. You chasing me down will not make me stop so you can get your heal points in. You cannot heal me in time unless you have a medkit.
---
Better than putting the red rank in with the new guys
---
That David deserved that death. Gets hook traded and still goes down again within 5 seconds somehow. Gets healed up and then works on the jigsaw box RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. Like, seriously dude?
---
but he said chapter 11
---
Battery and low amp is usually the way to go. 
---
But Addons that increase blindness durations work aswell. The latter being more useful for pallet blinding.
---
I see. I’m a killer main, and from my point of view I see killing 3 people a big win. Mostly because 1 person can easily escape from the hatch. From the survivor side, I find escaping alone a win too though. It depends on many things, mostly on how the game went in general. I was maybe too aggressive in the first comment, I think you should find your own point of view. 
---
Ace mains: *interesting* 
---
Yeah its pretty shitty, not sure why its so overwhleming.  I mean, the legion only hits you with a pocket knife and it does that?   I think the normal hit effect from other killers melee hits are more than adequate.  Fair trade off would be to make it fad away faster
---
Alpha LFs don’t even bother we Insidious. We run Distressing while we facecamp knowing full well the SWF group will go for the unhook anyway.
---
id say he is bad because he doesnt have any real power his power just allows him to hit people after 7 sec so that really sucks. Even when you sleep people they only need a skill check to wake up or find someone to wake up then they are immune for another 7 seconds when they are woken up. You cant pressure hook survivor saves sure you can sleep both but again they have a 7 sec immunity because they are in the dream transition phase. Once all gens are done you have very little pressure even if you hook someone better hope they arent a quick sprint burst away from an exit gate
---
Sometimes formats are different than the scene
---
For example [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicMemes/comments/aj98qs/finally_gonna_contribute_to_my_favorite_meme_sub/?st=JRAWZ6O2&amp;sh=d75af73c) is the meme that gave me the idea
---
Because he's basically an M1 killer, but he can't even press M1 without going through a multiple-second telegraph first. He has nothing that helps in chases, nothing that creates map pressure. He can't even stop someone from running out the exit gates even if he catches them way early. He's good against survivors who don't know how to run or don't focus on generators very well, but he gets wrecked harder than any other killer by good survivors.
---
Even on that guy. Just stop it, give me BBQ level 3 already, or Enduring. (I did eventually get BBQ3 before stopping to level him, no Enduring though) Bloodweb *loves* Insidious and NOED. And Agitation, that one's everywhere too.
---
It would be abused to hell and back every day....some sick bastards would do it just for S&amp;Gs 
---
Oof. I know this pain as well. For me it usually happens when I’m found first, unhooked, tunneled, repeat till ded
---
Spend on killers, survivors are just skins after all.
---
You could get them all to lvl50 to make the menu look nice, but after that level only your mains.
---
YEP, IF I NEEDED ANOTHER CONFIRMATION THAT THIS COMMUNITY IS CANCEROUS AS HELL, THIS IS IT. THANKS FOR THAT AND SEE YOU NEVER! 
---
A 1v1 doesnt really allow much of a farm, unfortunately. I would have just asked as killer though, super unfair for a survivor to lose his item because of BS like that.

Personally, I think a win for survivors is the majority of the group getting out, and a win for killers being majority sacrificed. But of course in any kind of 3 man SWF that last person is the one they use essentially as fodder for the killer.
---
It will eventually. I'd love to trade my useless shroud of separation for some kind of luck reduction offering.
---
Their username checked out I suppose
---
Fortunately they're not all this toxic. But now, after 1000 hours in game, mostly playing killer, I just pass a lobby where I see more than one flashlight. Because this will not be a good time, skill doesn't even matter. Even if I 4K, I'll get frustrated by getting the usual salt. So, yeah... 
---
She did perform that mori on him after all?
---
Most people try to play him like a typical M1'er that runs forward on one person all game long.  The idea is you put as many people as you can to sleep and use his aura reading to keep tabs on survivors and constantly interrupt them from trying to break out.  Use downed/hooked survivors as bait, you can then guarantee half the team is in your dream which means half the team is ineffective.  
---
His best addons are Green Dress and Class Photo.  
---
Or when you’re being facecamped and the entire team comes by to sit and watch you, and you’re screaming at them to just go do gens because you’re being facecamped, so fucking frustrating!
---
They're still the newest killer though.
---
That said, I think Clown was already not played much this far after his release. I'm not saying Legion is balanced nor am I saying that deep wounds aren't fun but not everything can be great.
---
I don't think that any of the killers are terrible, not even Freddy. Some just don't have access to the tools that make the top tiers strong. The Wraith can be a very competent stealth killer with the right add-ons.
---
&gt;No, the statistics are ~~wrong~~ misleading ~~because you're bad at hag~~ because the devs aren't statisticians and don't know how gather and present meaningful data.
---
Nurse often had one of the lowest kill rates in those stats. At least part of that is because DCs didn't (still don't?) count as kills for those stats. So all the people that insta-DC against Nurse don't count as a kill, lowering her average kills per game.
---
Stats aren't "wrong", but they can sure as hell be misleading if there are flaws in methodology.

 Hello guys I love the Trapper and since we have this art course at school I decided to paint him. Yes I know his neck is little weird but I´m a beginner when it comes to painting :D And have a skin problem too so it isn´t a problem for me xD
---
if youre on pc ya but you have to do it a lot, console wont get banned

Im pretty sure there are new spawn points. Or im unlucky and they never spawned there for me.
---
In the Killer Shack,standing inside, i had ruin spawn on the left side of the pallet right next to the crates

Based on what those people said, a flying killer with like a dive attack sounds dope
---
BING BONG
---
Fuck its not 2009?!
---
Appreciate the feedback mate. 
---
 You may be barking up the wrong tree.   
---
 In the game files we have:  
---
 England - Freddy DLC  
---
 Finland - SAW DLC  
---
 Guam  - Clown  
---
 Haiti - Spirit  
---
 Kenya - Legion
---
therefore Mali ..... anything!  
---
 Unless anyone can identify the link between any of these and their dlc? 
---
With that key, it's important to know that the hatch spawns depending on how many generators are completed. 1 per survivor + 1. So if everyone is alive, every generator has to be completed for the hatch to spawn 
---
I think you need the sprites/ animations on Unreal Engine 4
---
The Spirit, her name is Rin.
---
very soon.tm
---
also, hoping to see some new skins that haven't been leaked
---
I argue that as things stand, we have a similar situation where the killer is borderline helpless, which makes zero sense. Why would a killer ever just stare directly into the eyes of the person they want to kill, knowing that if you stab them they escape? Makes zero sense from a lore perspective, and its a god awful game mechanic from literally any perspective.   
---
The other reply covers my other issues super well. 
---
No. That's the problem with most bad killers. They think the survivor dictates the direction the chase continues. You as the killer move the survivor to the "bad side" so they are forced back into the already trapped loops or they have to take a long way to the next non-trapped loop, thus getting hit on the way there.
---
You don't have to worry about people setting off your loop traps because you shouldn't be running that far away from all the loops you just trapped from chasing that one guy.
---
So essentially you are left with an entire area of the map completely trapped all with no downtime because you did it while chasing. The buff really did wonders for the Hag but she still isn't nurse level.
---

Insert mandatory: doing gens, you?
---
D class
---
If you’re focusing on Myers I’d recommend Doctor for Monitor and Abuse and Spirit for Spirit Fury and leather Face for bbq. When leveling killers you don’t have to play them just dump points into them. 
---
After I unlocked all the killers and survivors, I save enough shards to buy the newest killer or survivor whichever I’m more interested in and then hoard for cosmetics/shrine bloodpoints. 
---
It also eliminates the possibility of the survivor and the killer making deeply awkward eye contact as they wait for some one to make a move.

 Watch Zubat or Scott if you want to see what sort of damage a huntress who ~~knows how to throw hatchets~~ **uses a crosshair** can do at loops.

The day a doctor flosses after hooking me is the day I uninstall Dead by Daylight...
---
If a chase is going on for awhile, leave them and find someone else. What do you play it on? And it’s perfectly fine to leave a chase to find someone else. As someone who plays both killer and survivor I know the loops pretty well. And have gotten good at mid gaming. Just practice 
---
That's pretty awful as a solo survivor, as it could lead to other survivors playing more "selfishly" in an attempt to secure the item. Can't say I'm a fan.
---
I'd say play games as survivor to learn the map and see how some other killers apply pressure, watching YouTube videos also help good luck and I'll see you in the fog 😁
---
Agreed. Tired ass
---
That fucking Snikk0r
---
You killed 1 guy?
---
Way better than them starting the game, rushing vials (no gens, no saving, no nothing) and suiciding
---
It took like 2 hours to find matches as the killer at rank 1 during that event i would not call that easy
---
Lol ok xD
---
Don't think there is a hack for that...
---
Using something that is strong doesn't mean indicate lack of skill.
---
watching streams/videos can help, thats what helped me
---
There’s no “right” answer for this. I like Urban Evasion, Self Care, Dark Sense and Empathy
---
Big oof. Thanks for letting me know.
---
Where’s the insidious leatherman?
---
You think that's bad? Try any map with corn as killer
---
lmfao the nerve to whine about the deep wound screen. Christ
---
Thanks for the reply! I find I enjoy playing other killers rather than just dumping points into them since their powers are unique (where as survivors are more generic). I think maybe spending the cash on leatherface might be best for the long run for the extra points that bbq offers.
---
Still waiting for B&amp;C to be on the shrine. Otherwise I’ll never get it.
---
Idk, I can’t hear his heartbeat.
---
Lith, dance with me, self care, quick and quiet
---
Thanks! I love the lore too. :D
---
Thanks! :D
---
His trap was pretty close to popping, that might've been the only box he had left. Or the only one he had time left to check. He was in a bit of a Catch-22 there without knowing that the Feng would get off hook, otherwise maybe he could've looked for hatch.
---
Jake for iron will!!! with the new patch fixing sound this perk will save ur ass 
---
New I'd say stick with Claudette just for the heals and empathy so you know whos the killer on and where. Later on you can make a stealth build with iron will, calm spirit, spine chill and selfcare. 
---
I believe that also. I think this is just a weird clue like the free spirit shirt for kate wich was supossed to be a teaser for The Spirit. 
---
I wasn’t hooked, I went down to unhook a teammate that you can see running up the stairs after I teleport down there and when I got there it wouldn’t let me unhook him so I just left and another teammate unhooked him 
---
I had a game yesterday as Freddy where I hooked a Tap and he died. Couple minutes later I saw him run past while I was chasing someone else. I was so confused I just stopped and stared at him. It was the weirdest feeling, like seeing a ghost. I killed him again and he stayed dead that time. Might be a new glitch introduced with the patch, I haven’t ever seen it happen before.
---
Next killer is a flag confirmed, you heard it here first 
---
Man that corn is annoying lol sometimes I can follow someone no problem but other times it’s like they disappear 
---
I'm on PS4. Not sure if the patch fix you're referring to, applies to PS4 as well.
---
Iorn will lithe balanced landing and borrowed time
---
Aftercare prove thy self balanced landing unbreakable
---
Iorn will lightweight quick and quiet dance with me
---
Im liking having 1 exhaustion perk, 1 end game perk and 2 synergy perks.
---
Adrenaline for end game is nice. Sometimes you have bad games that dont reach 5 gens, but this perk saved me a lot of times so I like running it.
---
For exhaustion, either Dead Hard for stalling chases and making plays or Balanced Landing when I just want to escape.
---
For the other two, I like perks that have some silly synergy. I feel it makes it more fun. So stuff like Dance with me + lithe, Resilience + self care so I can 99 myself and full heal if I need to escape, We are gonna live forever + we will make to get unhooks and bps. Lol
---
PS4 here too, definitely fixed things, footsteps and breathing is louder (tho tbh I never had issues with sound when playing killer which I think is what most ppl had problems with)
---
Should be highest rank.
---
"hurr durr i parrot streamers"
---
Thanks for your input! I was leaning towards Laurie or Dwight at first, but a lot of you are recommending Jake..
---
Learn how to mindgame an prioritize strategy by watching good killers on twitch, some favorites are Monto, TruTal3nt, ZubatLeL
---
Did Tru3 end up giving up as killer? Missed a few days and noticed he's streaming all killers again.
---
How'd that dude get 41 points lol.
---
I just wanted to say the video editing was gold worthy but what really got me cracking was the harsh truth of what it feels like in solo Q where you have to hold each other’s hands throughout the bloodshed and your team mates expect you to save/repair/be chased while they have 0 I repeat Z E R O interaction with the killer or be near them unless stake out ( cough Nea, cough Claudette fleshlight)
---
So have plat I guess :,)

---
N-o mither
---
I'm currently running Lithe, Bond, Iron Will, and Quick &amp; Quiet.
---
&gt; Every regular player has had these perks forever
---
I think this is a bit of a myopic view. New people start playing all the time, and it takes well over a year of regular-but-not-insane play to get all the characters and perks.
---
This is so cute. Good job! 
---
I forgot to crop it when I was finished making it, and by the time I posted I didn’t really care. I just wanted to make some people laugh.
---
Honestly disappointed it's not Nea again.
---
And you have yet to say how lmao
---
I think they should change it to where it insta morries the entire lobby when the game starts
---
I mean all I had was a shitty party starter. At least I blinded them with it I guess. :^)
---
I have. It’s not that bad. It’s not busted. It’s not debilitating like corn is for killers 
---
It doesnt matter how commonly it is done, its about how absolutely dogshit and unfair it is to verse the times it does happen. 
---
DamnNoHTML and OhTofu both have good videos for dealing with generic tiles/loops as a killer. I usually make purple ranks and didn't realize I was looping T-walls incorrectly until I watched their vids. Playing killer is all about applying pressure. One hook and one slug can give you more control than two hooks, for example. 
---
Thats funny because after this meme I am now gay. 
---
I was mocking the other guy because he could only talk about himself knowing the trick a long time ago, but I guess it wasn't obvious
---
Tbh if you want to save the guy literally seconds after the hook then I'm sorry about the hooked person but I'm not going to be hurt by an stupid survivor who can't wait 
---
You also have yet to change my mind but i guess we'll keep our opinions to ourselves.
---
Both survivors had extra chances LOL David with the unbreakable then immediately afterward she kobes. Just bad luck for that pig jeez I would be tilted 
---
Again, its all opinion. 
---
Its been that way for the entire history of the game.
---
You have 60 seconds, let em finish that Gen. 
---
Which is why you ideally don't play him like your standard M1 killer.  You always want to get at least two survivors at all times.  A hooked survivor and one survivor already in the dream state is a very strong situation for Freddy to be in.  
---
Oh my bad. Still a good nostalgia video though *shudders*
---
Sprint burst, dead hard, decisive and bond. OP build. /s for the dense.
---
I used to use urban, but it’s just an *okay* perk. Can be fun if you manage to pull one over on the killer, but it’s not common
---
I got that problem as well, on PC.
---
It does, terribly so
---
Plundy's and Ace in the Hole time.
---
I mean every killer plays slightly differently but in general here are a few tips:
---
- Learning the maps is useful and even though it's never guaranteed to have 2 of the same maps with the exact locations of windows and pallets etc it gets you used to identifying points where you can get looped really hard, so you can either herd survivors away from them or simply ignore them and focus on keeping other survivors from doing generators.
---
- Hooking survivors in places where you can get to easily and potentially block their escapes, the basement being a prime example.
---
- If you have trouble actually connecting hits, learn the lunge distance. It doesn't take long to be able to identify when to attack almost as if its second nature but I'd you're against particularly slippery survivors (like ones who spin around you) attacking them from an angle gives a much higher chance of hitting.
---
- Getting blinded isn't so bad if it's by an injured survivor so long as they don't have iron will. You'll be able to hear where they are due to groaning/footsteps. Hearing is your best sense when playing as both roles I found so look out for abnormal sounds.
---
- Finally don't let the game get to you. Getting BM'd isn't in the end of the world and don't let it frustrate you or get you down especially in the middle of a game. Try not to focus on the survivors who do BM and carry on going after the other survivors. 
---
Enduring rate drops to 0
---
Yeah so you'll have all the best T3 perks as a max presitige and be able to pull purp and red items out of your bloodweb like candy.
---
No, DCs count on all platforms.
---
How do you do the prestige exploit? Asking for a friend 
---
To clarify, the hatch spawns at the start of a match, and is viewable with a rainbow map throughout.  However, it's otherwise invisible.  A general guide for the hatch appearance is 'Number of survivors alive +1 = number of gens done.
---
Ive never seen it either 
---
Overcharge*
---
In case you're wondering: Yes. 3 Survivors did immediately find it. At the very least I was Wraith so I could keep guard of it pretty well, but it was a war of attrition.
---
I ONLY HAVE ONE FRIEND WHO PLAYS SO I NORMALLY PLAY WITH RANDOMS. I’LL JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT MY FATE I GUESS 
---
That would work for me too, gains strength the lower the timer gets on the hit survivor.  Actually, Id prefer that and would make more sense.
---
We have but they aren’t going to delete the corn maps but they might change the filter you get
---
If altruism is your goal and you don’t use well make it, you’re literally ignoring the 2nd best altruism perk, the best one being borrowed time. The games going too fast is a complaint from killers, not survivors, and is a product of killers not applying enough pressure to survivors. As a survivor you want to get gens done fast and minimize wasted time, as to never give the killer a chance at killing you. Running bond and empathy together is pointless, you might as well run bond and open handed if you’re going to run two aura perks, because open handed at least helps your teammates as well and makes it so bond can stretch across half (or more) of most maps, making empathy pretty much useless. If you can’t see an injured survivor with that perk combination, it’s not worth the time to run all the way to the other side of the map anyway. You can play however you want and I’m sorry if I’m being a little bit of an ass cuz I hate that side of this community, but there’s just much better perks to use if altruism is your goal.
---
Well they already boosted the rates of the chests so in honestly not surprised. 
---
Hm, one guy on the hook is more pressure than you chasing one and one injured (who can simply not heal himself depending on the game, can have a medkit or maybe another survivor heals them when he gets close). You can also pretty much always hit the hook diver once and then chase the unhooked without any delay (and the unhooked will be easier since he doesn't have the "hitted" move speed bonus)
---
Chupacabra.
---
My problem with pig is when they finally find you and down you then put the trap on and hook you, majority will just tunnel you anyway so what was the point of the trap?
---
Waiting for the NSFW version.
---
Since when, last I heard luck plays no part in rarity of items from chests.
---
even with no-mither?
---
N I G H T M O D E 
---
4.5k Points for all Skins...ooof
---
Damn. I wish I could open the game and see how many points I need for Fengs set.
---
try learning the blink mechanic i used the add on that shows where you would blink.
---
this helped me get a feel on how the distance is depending on how long i hold 
---
sorry for the rushed answer being chased by a nurse ATM lol good luck 
---
Lithe and dead hard go great together 
---
Sure m1 billy is easy but mastering the chainsaw is not easy whatsoever. Hate when people say billy is easy. Try to only hit chainsaws for your downs and you will realize how hard to is to master his power
---
not only that, but with addons you can reveal survivor or killer auras as well. Each key has a time on it (10/5/30 seconds for the green/purple/pink keys) and you can attach tokens that allow you to use the key to reveal survivor auras within a range, which can also be extended with addons. The time you have on the key can also be extended. There's also the blood stone addon which lets  you reveal the killers aura within range, but you burn through the key twice as fast. 
---
Finally, the purple and pink key can open the hatch if it has spawned. It stays open for a bit for other survivors to potentially use.
---
In general, the green key cannot be used to open the hatch, so it's meant for aura readings. The purple key only has 5 seconds of use on it, so it's meant for the hatch unless you extend the time. The pink key can be used for both because it's 30 seconds and can open the hatch.

Is the item droppable with Franklin's Demise, or just held in a different inventory like the pustule stuff?
---
So you can collect 9 coins overall? So one coin per piece/three per set?

They didn't change pallets much, you probably were just unlucky. There have been some major hook changes though.

The default one on PS4. Is there a better layout for her?
---
its not ingame yet
---
yep
---
Seems.. idk like a lot. I’ll probably just grind for Ace’s jacket and buy fengs. I assume they did it this way to prevent killers and survivors from just farming with each other. 
---
You know it only works if there the last one left right?
---
Why didn’t you jump in when she hit you
---
Cool! Then I might actually be able to get the Ace set! 
---
Yup 
---
r/woooosh
---
I was wondering why my spirit was sucking ass. I thought my hearing just got worse and everyone was running iron will lmao
---
No idea...
---
but each coin costs 100 points more
---
I'm legit a feng main and own all her cosmetics, so like.. ima buy it instantly tbh
---
Was you camping?
---
Sadly I'm not sure if that's possible. Now that Disney bought Fox, Disney now owns the Alien franchise. I'm not so sure Disney will be easy to make a deal with. Besides the Fox buyout was just completed so it would be a while before you see Disney's new IP being used in new material. 
---
But an Alien chapter would be super cool. The devs would have to design a new animation rig/skeleton for the Xenomorph look right which is something the devs have stated they would rule out. Right now all killers share the same skeleton but have different animations. That could change however.
---
As I said in another comment no one uses your definition of tunneling...
---
These kinds of bugs are nothing new with the game, seems to happen with every patch they put out.  2+ years and I can still count on something to break.  
---
I only laughed at the crop
---
That is lightborn, shadowborn looks like an owl.
---
You could say the same thing about Freddy and skillchecks.
---
I’ve had this happen to me as well 😂😂
---
:(
---
What exploit? 
---
Had the same thing happen to me on Grim Pantry last night. One guy d/c'ed and I was doing a gen. After a chase, the killer hooked me for my first hook. I immediately went to struggle phase then subsequently died because I didn't think I needed to mash A to stay alive (xbox btw). The game said the two survivors were still in the match, but I didn't see their yellow auras. 
---
Needless to say I was very confused. 
---
I'd imagine,   
---
1 - head                   1 - head
---
1 - body         or       1 - body
---
1 - trousers              1 - weapon
---
Console is fucked because they can't ban
---
I am on xbox so I cant relate. But, I suggest changing the buttons that make you the most comfortable. Also, its a nurse, you have to keep playing her and practicing. I know this is cliche advice but its how you play her well. Especially since you have to fight the garbage fps more than survivors half the time.
---
Then why even bother responding to my day old comment?
---
He nerfed Ruin.
---
Terrible 
---
I'm more talking about the groups that are using comms to essentially break the game. Try playing a stealth killer with discordance to see what bullshit really happens.
---
In situations where survivors should have no idea if you're still near their gen, they'll know exactly when it's safe because their teammates will feed them your location. Then discordance pops. Then you turn around and head towards it, but they're already walking away from the gen hiding. By the time you get there the guy that tried to bait you is healed and also on his gen, and now you're playing hide and seek while he repairs or while they sneak off to another gen.
---
Despite knowing exactly what their playbook is, what gens they're doing, where they'll try to bait you so they can do gens, etc, the only thing you can really do is destroy them 3 chases each and/or play nurse or billy. And I don't mean do a pretty good job at chases. I mean you have to completely dominate them. That just doesn't happen with survivors at equal skill level as the killer.
---
F for snikkor
---
Thank you for the detailed explanation kind sir 
---
I love how they said it takes about one second for a killer to destroy a vessel and they can also DC to prevent survivors with escaping with them. Sounds fun for survivors. 
---
I’ll be a killer main for this event. 
---
Looks the same to me.
---
He is the reason i got the gay
---
I don't really give a flying f*** if you don't like that but I'm not playing a video game to feel miserable getting my ass kicked by a toxic SWF group having to tryhard every single game playing meta picks/builds. You have every right to leave my lobby if you feel like (ping/other survivors/the moon told you to) and I have the same right.
---
No bloodhunt? Boooooo. Ah well, I do like the way they've changed the event up though. Makes it harder to farm, but easier to get by playing naturally, which is how these types of events should be.
---
I assume the sloppy butcher-wraith exploit.
---
I would say 3 out is a win 2 out is a tie, 1 out is a loss, 0 out is getting destroyed
---
Chinese firecrackers are coming back, confirmed on dev stream! Rejoice :D
---
yes they said that on stream
---
Not as hot as daddy Myers 
---
You'd think the devs don't test their updates considering all the bugs that get through. I mean Leatherface and Billy still have their no sound chainsaws. The survivors still glide around after stunning a killer with a pallet. It can be funny until you remember this game is almost 3 years old. Stuff like this should not be so common. 
---
I finally just bit the bullet and bought LF during last week's shrine of secrets.. All I know is if BBQ shows up anytime soon, I'm going to cry. 
---
I responded after and cause I'm not just talking to you, if I was I would send you a private message.
---
I just got flashback when some moron posted on reddit that waglf is too op and then it got nerfed. Lets hope plounder will be great forever
---
Are a wip currently 
---
First off: Happy cake day!
---
Secondly: Yes. Yes they are.
---
Killers who leave because people "beat" them is pathetic.
---
Let's be completely honest, PEOPLE WILL DC out of spite. People already do it every day, and an event brings out the worst in everyone. They need to address this.
---
I think they said first coin is 100 points, second is 200, third is 300 and so on... So, first full set is 600 points, second 1500 and third 2400
---
Tunneling is focusing down one survivor, if you're constantly choosing to go for him instead of someone else then you're tunneling simple as that.
---
Great, another event for this community to flood the front page with threads bitching about players using strong offerings. 
---
I feel like this won't be as big of an issue as people think. Sure there will always be a salty jerk here and there, but most killers wouldn't be that spiteful plus that would mean they lose any progress they made. Even if they don't destroy any of the things they still get points for each hook.
---
👌👌😂😂😂😂😂💯💯💯🤣🤣😂😂👌👌👌💯 🤣🤣😂😂😂😂👌👌👌👌👌💯💯
---
Play survivor, get wrecked, do what the killer did to wreck you 
---
I dno man. Maybe in my 150ish hours I just havent met a good Hag yet. 
---
Cool, sounds like a very fun event once again... NOT
---
You mean like the last new year event where every swf group sabo'd every event hook?
---
Can we all try and just...play Dead by Daylight during the event, instead of coming to /r/DeadbyDaylight to bitch about how players aren't playing how we want them to during it? This subreddit really goes to shit during these things. 
---
Damn. Thats a shit ton of points. If you dont leave with a vessel often, its gonna be really hard to get more than one set.
---
Definitely pick up urban evasion (faster crouch) and we're gonna live forever (2x bp) for survivor if you have the shards to spare. If you don't want to save shards for cosmetics or characters then those are top tier perks for survivor. But as the other person said, they are from free characters (Nea and David) so its up to you.
---
Lullaby can be good on pig if the hex totem can make it to mid/late game where you can get the hook stacks and the survivors won't hear the puzzle box skill checks coming.
---
You can watch the VOD (video on demand) on their Twitch channel under "past broadcasts." It will also be posted on their YT channel at some point. 
---
LF dlc is super cheap and in the time it takes you to get bbq as a teachable is very minimal. And you may actually like him in the time you spend leveling him and give him a shot. 
---
Right it’s confusing as hell! Idk I was in the middle of a killer game and I’m like I’ve only see these 3 guys I’m like this 4th dude is stealthy af but they’re not doing shit. Turns out they dc’d
---
I'd put all the killers at top tier for lower ranks (14-20).  Except nurse; she blows at low ranks.
---
What’s weird is this one was fine last update.
---
Are Joey/Julie/Susie adults or not?? I know Frank is an adult but I’m not 100% for sure about the rest :0
---
That's why you get +25 Pt for escaping and +4 Pts per Gen. A killer only gets 2 Pt per Hook and 3 per destroyed vessels. Survivors will have a faster point progress at the end. 
---
You need to get up to 5 tokens for you to kill people. You get tokens by having survivors get unhooked while you're decently far away. 
---
Even though the trigger my be client side the actual skill check is not.  That is why things like lag and framerate affect the skillcheck.
---
Yeah this one is rather annoying like I think the skating bug is fucking hilarious. But this one I find very annoying
---
Well he pretty much only played Nurse to Rank 1.
---
You dont get to kill straight away lol - you get a token per hook rescue when youre x metres away and you need 5 to kill
---
You need 5 stacks first before you can kill someone. So you need to hook people 5 times and make sure you’re not within the radius when they are unhooked to get a stack. At 3 stacks you get an insta down.
---
I play until I get bored then I chase the killer 
---
They're all adults
---
Are you sure it'll be easy for killers? 
---
5 gens + escape with a vessel = 45 points for a perfect survivor game. 
---
12 hooks (4 kills with everyone on hook 3 times) + all 7 vessels destroyed = 45 point for a perfect killer game.
---
To destroy a vessel you need to hook survivor and then to get to vessel in a limited amount of time.
---
I'm not ready to say it will be way easier for a killer. We'll see, I guess
---
Yeah, that's literally what I just said, lol.
---
Nah lets just make them sonic stabby people - BHVR
---
If you don’t want the killer to think you’re bm’ing In the exit gates, why don’t you just leave lmao? 
---
Also nea was making all the notifications at the start of the video too as a “hey look over here I’m at the exit gate”
---
What about spirit?
---
Survivor: 
---
* 225 gens or 36 vessels
---
Killer:
---
* Hooking 450 survivors or destroy 300 vessels (i'm not sure if my math is correct... it might be 5 points, since you get the hook+destroying the vessel.), then it would be 180 survivor with vessel hooks.
---
I’m still pretty shit at looping/pallets as a survivor and every time I see a LF I cringe cause most times if they get close to me I know I’m going down by his chainsaw.
---
From what i saw in the stream this is looking to be another killer sided event in terms of how easy they can get their objective done compared to you. Seriously you have to survive with one of these things and the killer progressively breaks more of them as the match goes on. Sure this is not as bad as the previous one but still a mess in tems of balance.
---
they make it like that so people will feel the need to spend money on the skins i guess, but not a problem for me since i always buy fengs stuff anyway, i'll just work towards ace's and huntress 
---
You lose 20 points though for just escaping. Not everyone teabags at exit gates though tbh. 
---
"The Vampire"
---
thank you for this, you are a god for working this out &lt;3
---
Rainbow map is useless anyway lol
---
For Wraith: both shadow hunter add-ons with bamboozle, enduring, spirit’s fury and either fire up or brutal strength. It’s so much fun and not a serious build at all.
---
Thanks for the feedback. Looks like my wallets getting a bit lighter tonight haha.
---
Sir did you not learn that deranking is literally murder? Wtf
---
No there's an exploit where if you have a level 50 survivor or killer, you can prestige the killers or survivors to the right and left of the level 50. 
---
&gt;No it doesn't. That is just twisting logic to try and make something good sound bad. 
---
🎶 Here comes the Trapperrr, you better watch out for his Trappss... 🎶
---
I'm pretty sure it's going to be a killer that can't be looped because whenever they come up with a killer who cannot be looped the 80% of the community that is survivors are very satisfied.
---
I don’t think you skip the teabag tho, I’m pretty sure that’s the only way you are allowed to leave
---
What does the bug do
---
Just buy Leatherface and level him up??  No? Ok..
---
I feel that. I usually dread being chased cause I’m shit at looping too but I just try to waste at least 30 seconds of time on a chase. If I can do 40+ I’m happy. If a gen goes off, I’m pretty much Based Chase God in my eyes. 
---
Well, we have 2 weeks for that. And there's always "buy with money" option.
---
The game is not balanced around SWF, if it was you wouldn't have most perks of aura reading or you would have it built in for everyone. Sure they probably planned to add SWF since no game can really survive if you can't really play it with your friends. I don't really care what devs say, their actions matter way more and how the game mechanics works it clearly wasn't designed with SWF in mind.
---
I was just commenting on how both perks are useless since you're alone.
---
Same here. I haven't really tried because it seemed stupid and I just couldn't be bothered. Was not enjoying Legion when they released. 
---
It is doable as people have the trophy now, though I expect most that did it boosted it. 
---
The recent update may have made it easier. I might try again sometime. I just wish PS4 showed progress on these types of trophies so you know you're doing the right thing.
---
Limited amount of time? They didn’t say anything about that. 
---
So, if I understood correctly, you need 100 points to get one golden coin ? Really ?
---
I was planning on just doing generators and let other survivors and the killer fight each other over lunar vessels but... Seems that they're mandatory. It makes sense, 
---
but as a new player whose survival rate is pretty low, I feel like 2 weeks won't be enough for my noob ass to get Feng's full outfit in time. Wait and see.
---
He's still looking for Hex: Ruin. Just because
---
Yea usually after a hit is where things get dicey. It’s been rough lately since I feel like I play on rotten fields every other game lol
---
Why is she unplayable? 
---
Agreed, it's the equivalent of "You looped me for 5 gens with a lantern on? Lemme DC to get the last laugh so your hard work doesn't get rewarded."
---
Calm down lol
---
spotted the tydetyme hater LUL
---
You are talking about an extreme case done on higher ranks were people are more petty and toxic than the lower ranks. Sure people on the lower ranks picked up on the bad habit too, but they were few and far between. What sucks is that the current event ideas sound good but they are just not putting much thought into balance for both sides because both suck (survivors a little more).
---
But if I stop struggling I'll miss out on my 80 points in Survival
---
Perfect, I'm not too good at that
---
Bug confirmed. Tested. It's Live on PS4. 
---
No, it's way more. First coin is 100 points, second is 200, third is 300 and so on... Listen carefully: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/369095082?t=32m30s
---
D A R N
---
The Nea getting chased for 15 minutes had nothing to do with her being swf, she's just a good enough survivor. 
---
And it's your own fault for getting blinded because you didn't pick her up in front of a wall. 
---
Its been a few years, welcome to the club... At least the game unbalance is finally being helpful, been able to get matches in under 30 minutes.
---
Only first coin is 100 points.
---
Yeah I can get behind that. The problem lies when people are either learning a character or maining a character and they use NOED to get them consistent kills without having any actual skill. 
---
More people playing killer will help survivor queue times, not hurt it
---
Why don't your socks match
---
Awesome, exactly what I'm looking for. Thanks
---
After looking into it more, yeah this event is pretty bad too, the idea is the only good think about it.
---
&gt; So, if I understood correctly, you need 100 points to get one golden coin ? Really ?
---
First coin is 100 points, second is 20, third is 300 and so on: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/369095082?t=32m30s
---
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UoymuGcBzY) is really helpful for understanding some general ways to up your game. It's almost a year old so some of the stuff is maybe out of date, but there's a ton of useful info in it.
---
Maybe I need to be more specific - as a 4.6 m/s killer he can just chase and use his basic and his lunge and be somewhat effective - sure.
---
But unless you're just anticipating pallets and are going to cut them down with his power, his power is only useful for downing multiple people in basement, during a hook save, if you happen to find them healing eachother, and the occasional time you catch that dude who does the fancy backward-walking loops around you.
---
So I mean, if you're looking at your perks, addons, and power for Leatherface - the only strat you can really run that has any effectiveness in regards to his power is iron grasp/insidious/monstrous shrine/bbq&amp;chili.
---
I get that lot of people might consider this a hook camp, and frankly it is, but as far as hook camp strategies go this is the one that requires some actual pre-planning and puts the killer at a major risk.
---
It only works on non-SWF groups as well.
---
Incorrect. Each coin is 100 points more expensive than the last, so all 9 coins would be 4500 points.
---
If there is no bonus to bloodpoints what's the reward for even collecting vessels? 
---
Provide proof or it didn't happen. Of this had happened, someone  clipped it.
---
Thanks lol. It might seem like a lot on paper but maybe in game it won't be as difficult. Guess it's a matter of playing a lot !
---
Don’t forget dem rainbow maps too fam
---
I meant killer queues whoops.
---
Yeah, I was just sitting there confused trying to figure out if there was a new offering or something (havent played since legion) that let you get hatch with 2 people. Very confusing lol.
---
I honestly never understood why the Hillbilly has normal base move speed. He should get the Huntress or Nurse treatment. I feel like many play him by just running up to you and point blank chainsawing you.
---
I know that statement doesn't really belong here, but I'm curious if there even is a reason for his base speed being that high when his power is already mobility (like the Nurse).
---
&gt;(yay they finally fixed it)
---
They fixed it in 2.5.0, thank god.
---
I dont think either chinese new year or halloween were bad at all last time, they were incredibly fun and not that hard to get as both killer and survivor
---
This one might be a bit tougher for the survivors this time around, used to be harder for killers usually, so it's nice to see a bit of a change. Also we don't know yet what the amount of vials required is, it might be 40 for killer and 20 for survivor for all we know.
---

---
I just don't care, you're not special... I'm not obligated to play with you. 99% of the SWF squads I found are toxic, therefore its safe to assume when I see a SWF that they're toxic. Keep ranting lil kid, won't change the fact that I'll keep dodging assholes and SWFs if I don't feel like tryharding.
---
The Shrine had been so bad for me over the past while I finally had enough shards saved to buy The Spirit 
---
Hey buddy. While swf can be a bad time, you fell into their trap. There’s usually one (or two) who want to be chased *do not chase them!* ^^especially for 15 minutes!!! Go for their friend.
---
Now, while I don’t usually do this unless the gen pressure is real, killing one off early can lower a swf’s morale as the dead is usually bitching on voice comms and the remaining get suicidal...use their altruism against them.
---
Like I said, the killer probably didn't realize the injured survivor was so far behind.
---
Being on the stairs, you could definitely still hit the healthy and bodyblock the injured, but not everyone knows that. Still gotta get the easier target.
---
Here comes the Trapperrr, do step on his traps ;)
---
Exactly right. If one survivor is running you around for 15 minutes it’s time to take a look at yourself. 
---
As for flashlights, they’re comfortably the worst survivor item and so easy to counter.

I will say that getting it has been worth tho. Get that sucker to tier 3 and slap it on Legion, you got yourself an easy farmer. I don't even have to get a single kill, just hook everyone once and run around hitting everyone the rest of the game and that's an easy 60-90k depending on your offering.

What's the song at 1 minute? sounds familiar
---
Nope, which is funny since they just did a dev stream saying people can get banned
---
Can't really do anything if the game doesn't properly shows parties and your profile is private... 
---
They said during the dev stream that only the first coin is 100 points. Each coin after that requires more points. 
---
Yeah the whole point of survivor is to survive, the killer is supposed to be more powerful and the fact that your entire power can be nullified because people have an advantage that they shouldn’t makes the game unplayable at high ranks and any time after 10:00
---
Removed - Do not encourage/enable breaking the EULA
---
You can search mine. It's been awhile.
---
If she looped you for 15minutes, you're a shit killer. You could easily go through EVERY single pallet on the map in like 5-7minutes or so.
---
He was a pedophile/ child killer 
---
Sounds like someone is offended, lemme guess you’re the guy that tries to tell the killer how to play in the end game chat because you hid in a corner the entire game and think you’re good for not getting hooked
---
"Hex: Devour Hope" sided event tbh.
---
Again doesn't work like that. Using the best things doesn't make a player bad. 
---
Honestly the need to be nerfed again
---
To get 1 full outfit, you need 600 points. Assuming you won't get out with a vessel once, it's 150 gens to repair. But not solely by you. If anyone repairs an event gen, you get points for that. So, if you survive until gates are powered, that's a 20 points for you.
---
To get points for golden coins for the cosmetics. Plus, there's a few extra bloodpoints gained for each event generator completed. Just not a full on bloodhunt, double bloodpoints for everything you do. 
---
Removed - Use the Megathread
---
If 4 profiles are private I'm assuming its SWF... you gotta go out of your way to make it private and one public profile (just public friends) can let you know if its 4 man.
---
How is that encouraging people to do this glitch or enabling? I simply explained what this glitch was. I didn't tell em' how to do it, I didn't encourage em' to do the glitch I simply explained that there's a glitch. This comment removal is completely unfair.
---
Agreed. I avoid them in the bloodweb at all cost.
---
I’m sorry I’m a rank 10 going against purple and red ranks cause this matchmaking system is shit
---
Imagine getting ran for 15 min in the current state of the game and blaming it on swf lmao
---
Got some cute socks there, no homo
---
That is essentially removing SWF. Which even though is the thing I hate the most in this game removing it would kill the game.
---
Claudettes main will be happy

Sprint around the map, sneaking up on survivors working generators and catch them with their pants down. By the time they hear your terror radius or the sound of your saw, you're ontop of them. Pallets might be an issue with the Doom Engraving(slows down charge time) so take an appropriate perk. Whispers will tell you when you can take your foot of the gas and hunt, and Discordance will help choosing your direction.

If you use BBQ, pairing it with IM isn't the worst thing you can do.  It creates a damned if they do, damned if they don't situation where they can't avoid the aura reveal.
---
Huh. Guess you play on pc bc console is having the opposite problem 
---
Thanks for the advice I’m fairly new (less than 50 hours) instead of attacking me like everyone else seems to be doing

you get double blood points every game on top of a higher base blood points

Yeah this "joke" is so old I cant even laugh. It's like beating a dead horse. I guess if you are new to the game/subreddit it could still be funny.

Woah woah, see that guy right there? Looks like he's hit rock bottom. Well that guy is me, believe it or not. Now I bet you’re wondering how I got into this situation. It all started in the summer of ‘86.

Nope, he can't even fix gens. He's not enough to be a survivor.

Yeah I'm sure we'll all talk around the issue and focus on this specific match, I'm just addressing the frustrations he's having with SWF in general. 
---
I really hope his head still shakes once in a while.
---
Lol np man it happens, and yah that’s weird bc most people (me included) have the reverse issue where especially if I’m playing with more than one other person I might as well go fix myself a meal, eat it, and still be waiting for a match.
---
Yeah I actually found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4W9a8fQySc) about it.
---
Will it be for real 4500 points for all 9 coins? cuz that's kinda crazy, even for really dedicated players.
---
That would be like:
---
* repairing 1125 gens ---&gt; 80+ gens per day
---
* 180 vessels  ---&gt; over 10 escapes with vessels per day
---
* 2250 hooks  ---&gt; 160+ hooking survivors per day
---
* destroying 1500 vessels ---&gt; over 107+ hooking survivors with vessels
---
on one hand, I can understand, when devs wanna give out maybe 1-2 full outfits, but not all 3, but on the other hand... even a freaking dedicated player might not be able to get all 3 complete outfits. 
---
Wraith I would say Nurse's Calling, NOED and the other 2 I would vary, BBQ is good, Overcharge can be good, sloppy butcher, bloodhound, deerstalker.
---
You sound like that guy
---
How do you see, might be a dumb question, but plz help 
---
Same dude, me and my friend thought the entire game that one guy was just hiding in lockers all the time since we couldn't see his aura when hooked
---
I run enduring and full balls that shit

Upvoted. But seriously upvoted because I agree with you. Should I downvote instead?

I can certainly see this being abused but hopefully not too much.
---
No im talking side objectives like the blight event 
---
9 pieces = 3 full outfits (Huntress, Min, Ace). Each piece costs 1 coin. First coin is 100 points, second 200, third 300 and so on.
---
Let me guess you’re the Laurie that dcs after you miss your decisive 3 games in a row

Maybe its because of where I am and when I play or something.
---
Sounds like the original spawns have come back.
---
You know this post is going to be completely biased right?
---
It’s bob Marley and he’s going to kill us with kindness
---
try reading the perk description
---
This just happened to me last night. The Trapper wasn't even camping, he had just hooked me. All 3 survivors were running erratically around him right in front of the hook. One was dumb enough to get himself smacked twice WHILE he was carrying me. Then one of the other survivors tried to heal him with the killer just 5 feet away... Darwin awards for everyone!
---
Oh and then they unhooked me with him right there - I HATE when people do that instead of waiting for a safe time. The killer almost always downs me again instead of going after the rescuer. Really grinds my gears!
---
It's not funny.
---
Support is great but strategy is better. Finishing a gen and/or giving the killer time to move safely away from the hooked survivor before pulling them off can be key. I always try to save before struggle since that’ll allow them 3 hooks before death instead of 2, unless the killer is a camper.
---
So many tier lists, so little spirit
---
To be honest, I think you need more than 50 hours of experience before you start trying to change all of the game mechanics. In a situation like this if you have less experience and less time practicing then it is up to you to keep practicing until you get to an equal (or close to equal) skill set. Just because Usain Bolt has 3000 hours of practice doesnt mean we should hit his shin with pipes because the person who practiced for 50 hours couldn't beat him.
---
Keep practicing and you'll learn the jukes, mind games, and thought process of a survivor. On top of this if you want to learn how to outsmart a survivor (or killer) you need to play as one. Try playing survivor and learning how to school killers then you'll notice that people are using those same tactics. Idk if you play survivor, but there is a lot of people who post on here who have no experience with survivor then claim it is just too easy instead of looking at their skill. You'll be better at killer and survivor if you play both because each will help you for the other.
---
Damn that's stupid, is it a technical issue or something they can't work around? Survivors get to keep their normal items when the killer DCs....
---
&gt; Abuse Of Power
---
you dorks are so dramatic 
---
Its designed for me to farm other survivors of the hook without consequence while I lot chests in the mean time. Aka I get more blood points for doing less without consequence to myself
---
For some reason I though the grass was water and the pallet a ship. Hag is a pirate confirmed.
---
Np I learned to become a better killer when I watched his vids
---
Who knows with this game anymore
---
Why do you keep talking about SWF you idiot
---
There won't be any event hooks this time.
---
Survivors go to vessels, get coin, get hooked, as long as they're hooked, the killer can break the vessel.
---
Which means.. if killers cannot hook survivors.. killers won't be able to progress their side of the event.
---
What have you done to my baby 😭
---
Ey
---
50 on pc 300 on console
---
Lay off ass hat
---
Yeah, which they fixed for killers in the last event while making the objective fucking awful for survivors. Killers just had to play the game while survivors had to not do the objective for a chance, a chance at getting the sweet succ off on those stupid plants.
---
Chill their people too
---
0/10
---
But yeah it’s just frustrating on pc to deal with console problems but worse
---
So funny! RIP good buddy.
---
That's still not that many hours even if you played 50%/50% split. There are people out there with like 4-6000 hours.
---
Does anyone who actually play this game think Claudette is altruistic?  What bizarro universe do you live in?
---
&gt; This subreddit really goes to shit during these things. Every other thread is a complaint about how the killer used a strong perk
---
Not even just events. Someone got upvoted for calling BBQ overpowered yesterday. 
---
But it makes it obvious how few people here have ever played killer 
---
This has always been my crackpot theory, but I think the clue will be in Jeff's cosmetics. My reasoning is the free spirit top for Kate preceded the release of the spirit, and the all denim outfit for Adam Francis is called the Canadian tuxedo in the store and the Darkness Among Us chapter was all Canadian. If the previous survivors clothes hint at the next chapter in some esoteric way, then I think something of Jeff's is the clue but I have no guess as to what item.
---
What is a console problem that is worse on PC. I know of none. PC&gt;console. There is not one thing a console has over a pc.
---
I mean it's good change for survivors who actually wanted to make it out. Before the change the best surv points were saboing hooks and hook farming. 
---
Now at least you have to co-op 1.5 gens to max out obj, then revert back to unsafe hooking and saboing. That means there's usually always a hatch escape for immersed survs.
---
[Saw this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaregore/comments/ajdltg/my_gas_pump_crashed_and_when_it_came_back_on_it/) and immediately made me think of spook our Waluigi killer
---
Try plaing killer, you can still have 2m matches but in the end you're alive so... gg ez
---
Real question is why are you ruining STBFL?
---
I’m talking about more swf and toxicity pc is obviously better as far as frames and graphics
---
Cannibal has the basement
---

---
Looks to me like you are the toxic player
---
But add with that ace in the hole though, *pacha's just right meme*
---
“Altruistic” more like farming simulator
---
Best farming strategy outside of just selecting Legion is to use the Doctor with the three-gen build and an offering for The Game. You make less BP per match because of the 2-3 disconnects, but it makes for quick matches and you earn more per hour. Gotta think of the long game. 
---
Weird that someone downvoted you when this is factual information.
---
Survivor mains don't like being given a reason not to complain I guess.
---
You just have to keep practicing. You have to build up to be better and outplay them. It wouldnt be rewarding if anyone could do it.
---
&gt; But I think they said they wouldn't do that
---
They also said they wouldn't add a clown.
---
Well if England was freddy, he was played by Robert Englund. The others I can't think of lol
---
Yeah that’s the glory of the game
---
On pc its quicker for me on killer than on survivors
---
I get it on pc. Luckily the killer saw it happened and let me go gaha
---
True that my dude
---
Killers have literally never been better, the last killers released were a strong killer, a top tier killer, and a killer that can have no counterplay. I agree that people bitch a lot but it definitely isn't only one side. If you really think killers have no chance of winning then you obviously just aren't a good killer.
---
His butt
---
It's definitely an attempt to sell cosmetics.
---
Also, dont get discouraged if you lose some games. Sometimes you get outplayed.
---
imagine if one day they'd say that every time a survivor dc's all the hooks and bloodpoints that the killer earned from them will just disappear like nothing ever happened
---
Insert bad reposted memes
---
I'm pretty sure they cannot do this even if they wanted. The pig is a licenced character so changing really anything about her would require  Twisted Pictures approval. 
---
It happened to me with the Unreal Engine update. Dropped from 70-80fps to 50-60. Complete bullshit imo
---
Is the joke that’s she’s so ugly she kills people
---
ah so bankrupcey.  next killer must be Donald Trump.  
---
Yeah but it’s frustrating none the less especially when I was trying to be nice cause I brought bps
---
Going to be honest: this sounds awful.
---
Dont survivors still get blood points if the killer dc's... 
---
Yeah, this game has a broken ranking system for both. You can 3 prestige a survivor without playing them. Try to get them up to some high ranks and still win.
---
Nice
---
They just buffed bamboozle; the killer now doesn't have to vault in order to block the window.
---
yes
---
Nah man, no big problem
---
Eh, I preferred the shitty quality of the original but obviously these are subjective
---
If they gen rush you need to get someone out of the game asap
---
I actually only recently started using it again. Went a very long time without it. I find it makes the game easier. People can be skilled in different ways.
---
If it's really 40 hours, it's not THAT bad, to be honest. Couple of hours on weekdays + 5-6 hours on weekend...
---
Oh God
---
What’s the difference between some of those? Like the long sleeve classic and basic? I don’t see any difference in the pics. Sorry if it’s a dumb question. 
---
I've  had  a  migraine  for  three  days  now  and  this  tomfoolery  made  me  smile  so  thank  you!  I  really  needed  this  :)
---
Hag is absolutely amazing, and with the right build and some skill she can be the strongest Killer in the game. Yes, even going beyond Nurse. The build in question is Ruin, Lullaby, Devour Hope, and TotH with Mint Rag and Rusty Shackles. Not even Omega Blink Nurse can cover the ground a Mint Rag Hag can cover, and you don't need chase potential when 90% of your attacks are grabs or insta-downs.
---
It can fall apart a bit vs SWF (most things do) as they can coordinate totem touching forcing you to pick one totem to defend out of 2 or 3 or even all 4. But by then you've usually gotten multiple hooks/stacks and there's likely few, if any, gens done.
---
How hilarious! The killer Nea joke!!
---
Seeing these tier lists makes me feel like shit about last night. Play solo, queued up against a Freddy, who promptly got a 4k against us and we didnt even finish ONE gen. 
---
Game after this? 4 party streamers and it crashes and we lose all of them :D  
---
[http://prntscr.com/mbr116](http://prntscr.com/mbr116)
---
They changed that a long time ago. You can no longer see the hatch with a rainbow map before it spawns.
---
No, you don't. The fastest way to get somebody out of the game ASAP is to hook and camp them. But that will get wrecked by a gen rush. If they gen rush, you need to apply as much map pressure as possible.
---
You can always win harder and doing everything to win doesn't make anyone bad. 
---
[This is my guess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nommo)
---
God worshipped by Mali people, the wiki article even says they're amphibious so survivors have already been summoning him on Twitch. Also states it "was the first living creature created by the sky god Amma". That one dude said the next killer was going to be the oldest one yet or whatever. It's done. No vampire confirmed.
---
**Nommo**
---
The Nommo are ancestral spirits (sometimes referred to as deities) worshipped by the Dogon people of Mali. The word Nommos is derived from a Dogon word meaning "to make one drink." The Nommos are usually described as amphibious, hermaphroditic, fish-like creatures. Folk art depictions of the Nommos show creatures with humanoid upper torsos, legs/feet, and a fish-like lower torso and tail. The Nommos are also referred to as “Masters of the Water”, “the Monitors”, and "the Teachers”.

---
Will be fixed in a next patch, hopefully.
---
Yeah except this will lead to noed and mori killers non stop and 4 man d strike squads. 
---
IDK why you're getting downvoted it's true lol
---
When they release Jason Voorhees as killer
---
That's just not true though, unless you view winning as 4k'ing as killer. A survivor makes a mistake they get downed, but a killer makes a mistake and they lose a few seconds (also bad) but a lot easier to recover from. What you are describing is playing against a good nurse and some legions though, not being able to win unless they make mistakes. For legion it would involve tunneling or exploiting the chase mechanics though. On average this event is going to be a lot easier for a killer, because playing perfect is quite hard. 
---
It feels like you are viewing this from a strong SWF perspective, which is not reflective of how most people play.
---
Drop a few bucks for hours of entertainment and supporting the game?
---
It's a videogame dude, chill
---
&gt; and encouraging killers to leave hooks
---
The problem isn't incentive. The problem is that everyone except Billy/Nurse lacks mobility to leave the hook and get the most out of BBQ or Bitter Murmur. And depending on how many auras I see I still might not leave. Instead I'll hang around, chainsaw/blink away and then come back to catch the guy hook rushing.
---
The way to fix this is very simple: either create a new perk or add a base ability that shows me Survivors within say 20-30 meters of a hook when I hook someone. That way you finally shut down mindless hook rushing and farming and force Survivors to be a tiny bit more stealthy. 
---
You can down vote me all you want but that's the only way you're going to stop "camping" because it makes infinitely more sense (especially if you're not using Billy/Nurse) to protect a hook and get 2 for 1 instead of leaving, guy gets unhooked, fully healed, meanwhile by the time you get to a gen it's either done, or the guy is hiding, or the guy takes you through more pallets/window looping. 
---
#No Bloodhunt/Double Bloodpoints?
---
Yeah not worth playing
---
Thic
---
It’s essentially hit or miss on the survivors I get, it’s either complete potatoes straight out of the ground or literally a group of sweaty nerds that have been up for the past 53 hours playing dbd
---
Back when I started the game maybe like 1 month before Freddy's release I picked Nea because I genuinely thought that she was the best-looking female survivor, imagine my surprise(including me questioning my eyes) when I found out she's generally regarded as really ugly and even being made joke that she's the killer.
---
Thanks for the comment. While I have heard a lot about M&amp;A for Meyers, I’m not sure how the rest of the doctor’s perks are so I hadn’t really thought about buying him. Where as the Hag has Ruin which fits into a lot of killers. Now with totems being harder to see, your Hag build sounds pretty awesome so I think my shards might be going to her and her guttural wheezing.
---
With the help of crutches? No sweetie. 
---
I love this. 
---
I know it’s not gonna happen but if it does...
---
BHVR TAKE MY MONEY.

Voodoo killer

I just tried this.
---
First chest - Skeleton Key
---
Second Chest - Purple Medkit
---
Third Chest - Purple Medkit
---
Decided to leave with the purple medkit as the gates were already open, no need for the key. I might run this perk all the time now.
---
If that’s your biggest issue in life, you have it pretty good
---
lol no it's not
---
Darn 
---
40 hours in 2 weeks is kinda crazy 
---
Deep Wound bleed out screen is not bad at all if you have functioning eyes
---
What? Deep Wound is also intended to obscure vision lmao
---
christ
---
OP didn't say bloodpoints, another person did in the comments to explain a similar premise. 
---
I’m a Min main so I’m biased but I love her GG jacket. I do think her perk set is great too, especially for new players, if I had to choose. 
---
But Cowboy Jake, I mean, come on. *italian finger kiss gesture*
---
Wait seriously only 1 more point for breaking a vessel?
---
Luckily i dont give a fuck about these cosmetics
---
How can I change your mind if you don't even say how it's broken? This is absurd
---
Opinion that you refuse to back up.
---
Camping isnt the quickest, as it takes over 2 minutes for them to die on Hook.
---
the quickest way is to let them unhook and tracking him down again
---
So killers can only destroy vessels while survivors are on a hook? So survivors can just unhook immediately when the killer leaves and denies him progress?
---
when  console rise up and revolt
---
I mean... you did say it 
---
same as getting 1 Survivor out of the game, its just Part of your objective 
---
We’ll make it for hook saves, adrenaline if you’re a looper, Small game if you like making killers cry
---
lol I recognize your username. I don't remember the exact circumstances, but I do remember thinking it was one of the... most incorrect... times somebody has called him a tunneler. Unless you're talking about some other time you called him a tunneler, I don't think you really understand the game that well. When you get a good opportunity to down somebody you need to take it whether it's somebody you already hooked or not. 
---
That said, I hope that guy that DMd you got punished by twitch. 
---
Unbreakable in case you somehow get downed with that combo 
---
Not when you do it on purpose, tunneling is going after one survivor even when another is an easier target.
---
Your objective is to kill them all, not one really really quickly.
---
Well, the Grim Reaper is on his shirt, maybe tru scythe character?
---
If you don’t want to be looped by survivors, there are tricks you can learn to deal with them so that the chase isn’t as long, you don’t get so frustrated and you don’t feel like you need to camp anyone. This would be a better option because not only will the people you play against get less annoyed, but you’ll have a lot more fun. 
---
I think you’ll probably get some rude comments to this post but if you honestly want to learn how to chase more efficiently, there are plenty of good tips and tricks out there and you can always practice and get better. It’s a ton of fun to outsmart a looping survivor and feel confident that you can catch them again at any time. 
---
Well you're definitely a better leatherface than me then because its rare that I let a chainsaw actually go off just out in the open and actually get a hit. People usually either just loop around me and get out of it or do that moonwalk thing and zip away.
---
If they are good go for the other players wouldnt you rather kill 2-3 peopl3 instead of most likely just the one? 
---
When we get the optimisation pass.
---
Switch out the weaker shadow dance for windstorm or swift hunt  and its actually solid
---
This piss poor frame rates on the killer side make blinking accurately even more of a chore than it is on PC. So she's not entirely unplayable, but she's even harder to play on console.
---
I'm not saying your reasoning isnt valid just offering advice.
---
Do it anakin
---
Was the OP smoking crack when he put Hag and Huntress on the same tier as Billy? And Freddy is C tier and Trapper is A tier? What is this bullshittery? 
---
and its your decision on how to do it, getting them 1 by 1 or bringing everyone to the 3rd Hook state
---
If you can get them unhooked, track them down, hook them again, track them down again, hook them again, let them get unhooked again, track them down again, and hook them one more time in less than 2 minutes, yes, that is faster. It's pretty likely to take longer, though, especially if the survivors are gen rushing.
---
I didn’t get a chance to read all that, but you totally insulted his account out of existence. Nice. 
---
Regular chain saw hits are fairly easy to get nearly anywhere on the map. Run the right add-ons and it gets even easier. Personally, I run BBQ (gotta get those BPs), Bamboozle (to block jungles), Ruin (which I probably don't need anymore), and overcharge (slows the game down after ruin falls). Pairing The Grease and the Carburetor Tuning Guide is beautiful. All of this put together allows for a chasing style more than a camping style, in that I can get my next chase and sometimes the next down before the hooked survivor is saved.
---
The only major problems Leatherface has is jungle gyms and survivors who use pallets efficiently. 
---
No, it's 2 points for a hook and 3 for vessel. So 5 in total.
---
Your correct, Sony and Microsoft tell the devs how it’s gonna be and if the devs can’t get people banned for simple stuff I doubt than can on this! 
---
They don't even have a ban system for console so I'm wondering what they'll do with console players. 
---
CHEESEBURGER KILLER CONFIRMED
---
All you have to do is break off the chase and go find someone else if you don’t feel like being looped. 
---
depends on your Killer, perks and knowledge of the survivors movements, aside from that I agree
---
Is it possible
---
Hag is an amazing killer, and if she fits your play style an easy main. I’d say go for it, plus Ruin is just one of the best perks.
---
Lol I play both so I know how it feels to get wrecked as a killer and the feeling of wanting to cry but even so I avoid camping if they are better than me oh well. In my eyes it’s just a game. Frustrating sure but in the end it’s just a game. 
---
I mean I still agree that in this case inexperienced is more correct, and is for sure an actual word.
---
Very hardly :D I made small holes with a simple scalpel. I "guessed" where the eyes could be and just made holes (though now I would have taken the time to measure it more precisely so I could see better). Even with 2 tiny holes you can see surprisingly lot, but you lose all peripheral vision.
---
Lmao.
---
I mentioned it because I play killer on console and I feel that Freddy's pain hard.
---
You're totally right but this community is 55 percent SWF survivors who don't play killer *at all*
---
Congratulations, OP.  This carcass isn't even cooled from this repost.
---
caught mcote’s stream once and I mentioned dracula and pinhead as maybe being a potential killer.He let out a laugh and said “hmmmm.”Didn’t think much of it but looking back at it maybe he knew a vampire type killer would be joining the fog? Hope so 
---
so?
---
I'll let you know thag there are actually nice killer mains out there, like me, I only camp if a survivor tried looping me and I sometimes even play without NOED /s
---
And the "feature" list of the new patch keeps piling up... I'm actually impressed at the amount of "features" they managed to deliver this time, and its just a mid chapter patch.
---
This is normal...
---
If you really wanna max out points try..
---
BBQ/ Thrill of the Hunt / Beast of Prey and Distressing. 
---
That‘s Rough buddy 
---
I think other survivors should be able to set it off also
---
Legion can follow you while not looking at you and either tick out to the mending timer or you try to mend and then they hit you.
---
Nurse with noed btw
---
Even if it was intended for Deep Wound to impair your vision, it makes no sense for it to impair your vision more than the Clown's gas. Even with the add-ons that make things even blurrier, it's still easier to see than with Deep Wound. It makes no sense for it to impair your vision that much in the lore or in the gameplay. I'm curious to why you think it's not busted, when it's nearly impossible to see through on dark maps. As if Legion needed to be more unfun to play against, his ability makes you basically blind. Great killer, not broken at all
---
M&amp;A is godly on Myers, and an absolute must if you use Scratched Mirror. It gives him no TR in tier 1 and only 8 meters at tier 2. He's a full mobility M1 Killer with an 8 meter TR, it's amazing.
---
As for Doc's other perks, Overcharge is decent but is most effective against newer players or when paired with Unnerving Presence to make the check smaller. Overwhelming Presence is... meh. It's good on an anti-flashlight build, you get 4 people in your lobby with flashlights you slap it and Lightborn on and there's nothing to worry about. But otherwise, kinda pointless.
---
As for the Hag build, it's one I the few times you *want* totems found. You trap near the totems, wait for a TotH proc while patrolling gens, then use Mint Rag to pop over to the touched totem and yoink them off. Porting to traps with Mint Rag can be a tad wonky at times, so you want to limit how many you place. I usually just do the totems and one or two near gens or gen clusters. 
---
If TotH breaks or the Survivors get smart and just do gens I'll abandon the totems and start trapping gens instead. But I try not to have more than 5 or 6 traps down, as accidentally going to the wrong one can cost you.
---
its not my Job to make sure the survivors can have a long and enjoyable game, Im literally there to make sure they dont get anything done
---
A killer that is like soirit and can't see survivors at all until it activates it's power, and when it does you have to stay perfectly still but can still be hit/ran into. If you move/he sees you, he becomes enraged or something.
---
Yeah I don't cry too much either, but I never understood that advice. The skill ceiling on survivors is higher than killers, you're not going to run into *worse* loopers at top ranks the longer people play, eventually the amount of survivors you let go are going to get higher and higher. I'd rather they waste some pallets while we're in a chase and I can get Bloodlust going and take my chances.
---
i unno I'm still having a good time.
---
He'd theoretically be taking away the strongest link in that team.
---
There are already killer perks that make skill checks more difficult. If that’s what you want, pick one of those. 
---
Otherwise, NO. 
---
Is trapper holding a locker above his head? 
---
Okay cool. And what about gameplay wise? Should I actually try for kills or just walk around and shock they asses? I would think a bit of both right? Some shocking and going for kills when the Gens are almost done?
---
That's your way of justifying your shitty attitude towards good players. Bottom line is you're an asshole.
---
Subscribers &amp; their neverending need for drama.
---
Theres always a weakest link though. I've never seen a 4 man swf where every person was equally as good. And if they are all to good. Then get your 1k and move onto the next match
---
I mean, for Killers it *kind of* makes sense. A force quit wipes everyone's points. So they actually have an impact on their targets. A mid Mori DC accomplishes nothing. Killer still gets the 1k BP for the kill.
---
So you are saying the survivor wins by default and they have to make mistakes for killers to get 4 kills, but as a survivor player getting killed doesn't really feel like a win to me. A win is me escaping, and a team win is everyone making it out. So what if the best possible outcome for killers, a 4k, is harder? It isn't impossible without mistakes, top tier killers can easily get them without survivors screwing up.
---
So take the perk you want? Teachables will keep showing up no matter what.
---
Good job! What program are you animating in? Also, I see these animations a lot; do you know where people get the character models by any chance? I'm interested in seeing what I can do with a few DBD models in my spare time.
---
Spirit
---
I see you are a man of culture aswell
---
Don't stop there. A mummy is a parent. Another parent is a daddy. Daddy is something you say during sex. Sex can be had when penis inserts into vagina. You can also insert a disk into a console. Dead by daylight is available in disk form. The next killer is just a big disk of Dead by Daylight that chases you
---
Being dismissive and condescending isnt gonna get you anywhere. I thought it was fuckin obvious how the Deep Wounds screen wasnt good. Its fucking blinding. You cant see shit.  Dumbass.
---
Fair, I just like em for the points and totem finding capabilities. Also rainbow maps are lovely.
---
Whenever a teammate gets camped my team and I usually get the remaining 3 gens. The killer forfeits 3 kills just for the one
---
LOL  Quick matches -&gt;  Doc Standing with his fist up his rectum with 3 gens -&gt; Bullshit detector going off.  
---
tl;dr
---
Camping is okay if I’m bad at the game. 
---
And you think a DC is a win because?  
---
Yesss I’m a piggy main and I love the idea of new cosmetics 
---
My point is that a UI element that has no network interaction other than "if you hit a great" or "if you miss it" shouldn't be network based. But then again it seems like (no offense) this game was programmed by idiots.
---
I think you having a ps4 pro contributes to that, as not everyone has one. Oh and plus the amount of killers with horrible or sub-par internet is too damn high. D:
---
Well you want your BBQ stacks right away so both. Bit of both. 
---
Finally the puke piss blood killer! 
---
Legion, Doctor(three gen build), Huntress with Iridescent hatchets, any killer with an Ebony Mori; these are on this community's approved list of circumstances you can disconnect from. You'll find no empathy. 
---
Inexperienced\*
---
depends if killers leave the bitch way though. a lot still leave the normal way lol
---
Hahahahaha
---
Dh is hard to use though, atleast at the start.. id go with SB over BL because its the easiest to use for newer players, then move on to BL
---
With so many new perks being added I’m having a difficult time trying to find what I need for all killers as trash perks fill the bloodweb. Wish you could ban, say four perks (more or less with how many perks you’ve unlocked) for each killer. So if you’re leveling Legion you could ban exposure perks that are worthless on him.
---
Laurie Chode
---
DC's mid game are a win in my book
---
Lol. I completely glossed over that because I just got done smoking so thanks. I appreciate you fam. For the tips and for totally being nice about everything. 10/10. Would ask again. 
---
yup
---
Honestly the closet I get to rank 1  as killer the easier time I have because they are all hyper altruistic. It’s the rank 20-10 I have trouble with because they don’t care they’ll hide the entire game and let their teammates die on the hook. 
---
Idc game is trash 
---
The remakes were kind of meh, the last few that interested me were the Engleund ones. 
---
Wanted to mention that I don't think your voice is annoying
---
and yet i still find a way to fuck it up lmao
---
My favourite perk 
---
Wow... Is this axtually hapenning? I only got yellow toolboxes and medkits
---
Obviously, englund is the only freddy as far as I'm concerned
---
Especially since people almost never use Tinkerer, so when people actually *do* use it, it can catch survivors off. Experience: I was playing against a Legion, and got jumpscared because he had Tinkerer. I was like "Where'd he go?" then got downed. If only it hid the red stain, too. That would make it considerably better. Make it like "The Ghost - Soot".
---
If they are gen rushing like you say they are then they must be decent.
---
It does impair more than Clown's gas. With Clown's gas the surroundings are still bright and you know where everything is if you've played the game for more than a month. You can still easily make things out. As with Deep Wound when it turns the brightness to 1% and throws on some blood to cover it up even more. It's not easy to make things out. The Deep Wound screen is broken. Do you lose sleep over it? lord.
---
Daaaaaaaum you baited that pig so hard... Was it intentional?
---
I mean why is there no extra blood points when doing this? This honestly sounds not the best 
---
Me too bill
---
P3 Claudette, tea bagging, spam flash lighting, repeat pointing, hook sabotaging when the killer comes near with a survivor; these are on the community’s pre-approved list of circumstances that the killer can face camp/tunnel and only from these. Goes both ways doesn’t it? Sounds really really fucking dumb lmfao
---
Hmmmm.... Is it freddy rework?
---
haha thanks man, it’s just that it always sounds so different in videos that it bugs me lol
---
Yeah. Needed her to hit me so I could get the David off the hook without her grabbing me. I’m glad she fell for it lol 
---
Wow. That's... disheartening. There really is only one reason to prestige - the item. I really hope this is a bug. After all, the repair rate with multiple people was bugged to not be as slow as it should be, so maybe they just forgot something, and they'll fix this. TIL.
---
because....?
---
pressing Mouse 1 and Space from time to time=skill(?)
---
If a survivor manages to hide from me or run me around like an idiot, then he is skilled.
---
Gen rushing ja just lets say.....not the hardest thing in the game 
---
It’s worse than the corn, which is just a map element not an overlay on your screen 
---
Im just not sure its going to be that worth finding vessels vs just finding another survivor to hook.
---
this kinda happened before the patch also, some of you might have run into instances where the player character was still in game but it showed him/her as "dc" he could be hooked healed downed for a couple mins after said "dc" 
---
For deliverance and the distraction perk 
---
Rough lol
---
Yeahh the lodge in autohaven wreckers also has the same problem ever since the update. To be fair it worked in my favour as lithe kicked in and the killer just stood totally confused! 
---
This.
---
&gt;P3 Claudette, tea bagging, spam flash lighting, repeat pointing, hook sabotaging when the killer comes near with a survivor; these are on the community’s pre-approved list of circumstances that the killer can face camp/tunnel and only from these.
---
Lol no they aren't, nice try with your defensive whataboutism but you're making shit up. 
---
me, also a lesbian, when I see Hugh Jackman
---
Billy and trapper are mind numbingly boring to play IMO. I always instantly trash their dailies. I’m glad someone else ranks them low. 
---
I know what you mean, I can't stand my own voice in recordings either and everyone else keeps saying I have one of the best voices they've heard. 
---
Lol it was a fucking joke you slags
---
And honestly besides the three new perks, survivors is pointless to speculate since they are just skins while the new killer changes the entire way of playing
---
reminds me of when you used to be able to vault the otherside and swing into the hay to get over the vault.  when the whole thing was hay instead of just one.  good times
---
Us console players have been getting 30 fps for the past year and they haven't fixed it yet. Goodluck to pc players
---
Maybe Papa Legba? 
---
Imagine not realising that I’m taking the piss out of you. Keep dcing buddy and complaining in post game chat 
---
I would like to reassure survivors that I, a killer main will not DC because you're performing well
---
Wait a sec, you are being a good guy and not letting the player with bad internet have a bad experience? Holy crap :o
---
Yes, they are people. And I usually defend them. But you can’t deny, this is pretty fucking stupid decision making. 
---
Just ignore him lol this kid has a massive hardon for making the game aids for survivors. 
---
I think this is a much better solution!
---
Next they are giving bill an assault rifle
---
Agreed. Frustrating how often this shit works because survivors literally disappear off the screen
---
Oh my bad dude, it looked like like your classic *'b-b-but what about ___'* post from here. 
---
This is why no one takes survivor main scum seriously.
---
Frankly, until corn and SWF is fixed none of you can whine and cry about anything
---
It for sure isnt just the last 3 months comrade 
---
Smol billy = instant karma
---
I'll check to see if my TV is in "Game Mode." Thats a good idea, thanks. 
---
Youre acting like most of the kids on this sub read anything lol
---
F O O L you activated my trap card

NOW IT IS YOU WHO WILL NEED TO HIDE IN A LOCKER

I want them to fix that...
---
You’re talking about pre approved dc things. I know there’s not a literal list but you’re acting like you’re completely safe for dcing in certain situations. Let’s be real you should almost never dc unless you’re glitched or the killer has you stuck (should be ban able but w/e). People are always gonna care about dcing. 
---
reupload
---
If you play PC look for me! I’m the dancing clown. I’ll down you once or twice but I want everyone to get the even currency! 
---
On a blatantly inferior system, running at sub-optimal levels, unable to take true recordings of your gameplay, and on a controller... very sad indeed.
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse, Tinkerer, Thrill of The Hunt, and another hex perk (Preferably Haunted Grounds to make more totems). Bring Interview Tape + High-Stimulus Electrode, and a map with one floor so your terror radius will be less noticeable (Not Doc on Game for once). If Tinkerer pops, zap the gen and wait for the screams. If ToTH pops, zap the totem and wait for the screams. I haven't actually tried Snipe Doc yet, but it sounds like it's going to be a whole heap of fun.
---
5 blinks are ass. So Fucking slow and easy to juke
---
Thanks for the subtitles, I’m on a bus so I can’t hear it.
---
Don't need to play him. Play the killer you want and use the BP you earn to lvl cannibal. 
---
Bbq coming in the shrine becomes a little bit more likely each week, but it never seems to happen so yeah
---
when i got hit, i couldn’t jump in lol. i would’ve if i could but it kept triggering self heal. the trap did because it redirected her hit away from me instead 
---
Whatever you say, Chief. 
---
He got me while chasing me outside, brought me to the basement and camped down there since then, downing all survivors who tried to rescue me lmao
---
I see a lot of Leatherface players just "guarding" the chest in the basement, I guess it just kind of turned into a thing? I have no idea why
---
Okay, well, I'm not going to make the argument for true randomness, though if BHVR did invest in their on alpha particle emitter and detector to place in some backroom then I'd have MAD respect for them.
---
Still, it would be nice to know their formula, at least as a gesture of good will. It can't be terribly complicated, and if it relies on, say, new sets of numbers from [Random.org](https://Random.org) (you'd be surprised how many websites do), then there wouldn't be a way to predict it. Well, there would, but it would require either working at [Random.org](https://Random.org) or breaching their terms of service.
---
I unnecessarily sexualized a character\*\*\*\*
---
I honestly don’t think he’s nearly as bad as people make him out to be. People just insist on playing him like a typical M1 killer, which he isn’t. 
---
No justifying camping gens, you must have misinterpreted what I said. I was simply pointing out the side of the coin which I consider worse because survivors CAN win and screw over killers. 
---
should be S as in Spirit
---
bingo
---
This is karma
---
Cool video! I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks true and pseudo randomness are interesting. Of course, if they, say, bull new random numbers each week from [Random.org](https://Random.org), prediction would still be nigh impossible. It would be neat if they had their own particle emitter and detector though, mad respect.
---
Mad respect, but dumb for something they only need on a weekly basis, lol.
---
Interacting with vessels and stuff will give you extra bp, like doing event actions in the past
---
The only thing that makes Infinite Loading screen not S++ tier is the fact that even though it kills all survivors, it kills the killer too
---
The game is far more balanced for killers than it used to be. I used to never play killer because the double pallet spawns made anything besides nurse painful to play as. Now I can even get away with playing trapper or wraith and still have a good time. 
---
We need a reddit just for DBD/RP memes. this is amazing and i love it
---
I heard what they said but how is it done? Not that I’m going to try it 
---
Can’t say. Mods will delete.
---
Love all of them! They look amazing especially huntress !
---
Oh god, that's a lot of work. I might do that though, when I have free time. Standard deviations in general would help my argument, but they're a bit annoying to do in this case with so many changing variables.
---
For Left Behind, it's because the perk was taken off the Shrine (all of Bill's perks were removed from the Shrine. As Bill is not on consoles, his perks show up as "base" free perks with no teachable on consoles. To avoid having different Shrines for different platforms, BHVR just removed all of his perks from the Shrine, seemingly with the Huntress update, though I could only use the period after Bill's last perk on the Shrine as I don't have an official source.
---
Nice but Meg's chin is humongous
---
Ah. Oh well thank always!!
---
I love the made up stats you're pulling out of your ass right now
---
*Wah*
---
40 hours in 2 weeks is definitely not for me, but I think it makes the event more worthwhile for it to not be a simple participation goal.  I feel like people that play the game more than I do should get more cosmetics than I do.  Seems fair.  In past events, it felt like the hardcore players had their stuff unlocked within a day or two and I could just roll in casually playing my 1 to 2 hours every other day and knock it out just the same.  Kinda takes the edge off, so I think it's good that there are some actual stakes this time.
---
Gen rushing is not the same as simply doing a gen, re-read OP's post
---
BURN IN HOLY FIRE!
---
yeah, i main him since i'm smashing survivors. until i realised he isnt exactly the best at higher ranks.  so im just going stop relying on him once i've gained enough bloodpoints from his BBQ+Chilli and applied it to whoever's  the next killer i play.  can anyone recommend a ideal killer for me since i heavily rely on Leatherface to get higher chances of success.  i have no clue who to try out.  
---
Huntress must be using a bear mask today
---
At the same time it's way more rewarding for Survivors who do escape with vessels.  It's probably going to end up being killer sided though just because (as usual) Killers will have an easier time amassing points.
---
Those titties tho...
---
25% to EVERYTHING is still amazing. Totems, gates and healing are all good examples 
---
I did read it again.
---
So poppin Gens left and right happens if everyone just sticks to a gen.
---
Still not that impressive
---
I agree with you utterly and completely. 
---
I'll definitely play this event enough for 1 full cosmetic outfit. Maybe even 2 full ones, maybe not. But I know I'll be happy with getting how ever many pieces I get. Good on the people that want it all bad enough to grind it out, it's not really that ridiculous of a grind for someone motivated and desiring getting all 3 full outfits, but it's enough that they'll need to honestly commit a solid amount of time grinding. That's absolutely fair for any game event imo. 
---
Scratched mirror on Lery's is some of the most fun you can have in this game, imo. Just sucks when you burn an offering for it and get fucking coldwind farm or some shit.
---
I wasn't sure whether to count release weeks, but the only thing it would change is that I've seen perks one week after release, so the chance would actually be slightly lower (more trials in Periods with fewer perks = higher BBQ chances). I don't have the dev notes on the Shrine rework after the Freddy patch, so I can't verify if my theory is true or not. If anything, my estimate is slightly conservative. If I can find a source, I'll go ahead and rework my numbers, though two weeks would probably bring it down to the 1.65-1.75% range.
---
Hmmm, well, I may have some judging to do. I know the Wiki says that, but I don't know if that was a statement or their guess based on previous experience.
---
I don't know if BBQ is the best example, but the overall free-paid trend sends far stronger messages then it anyway. If BBQ isn't rigged, the Shrine as a whole may be.
---
Oh boy, I really didn't want to take that into account because it would make messy math even messier, but I don't think it's allowed anymore. At least, I can't see any occurrences post-rework. Really wish I had that Shrine generation formula right about now. I'll look at the post-rework statistics again, and if they are as you say then I guess I have some more work to do lol, I'll keep you posted.
---
If there \*isn't\* allowed to be two perks from the same killer, then ugh, weeks with Franklin's Demise and Knock Out are going to be a nightmare and generated separately.
---
Thanks, I hate it. Back to the numbers! The last thing I want is to spread a false narrative.

Just sit behind a generator and you'll be nearly invisible 
---
Yeah they said they tried it, and it didn't really work out, same for a flying killer, they said it was cool but too strong. Maybe with new members in their team they'll get new and better ideas for it to actually work. But this was my best guess considering the clues ! :)
---
I’m looking forward to seeing it. I wish you good luck.  :)
---
Funny you say that, because T2 Bamboozle has shown to be bugged atm and prevents entity blocking:
---
https://www.twitch.tv/ohtofu/clip/RelentlessSuaveDiscPeoplesChamp?filter=clips&amp;range=24hr&amp;sort=time
---
(There was a clip from the killer's perspective that showed the Bamboozle "working" on his end but I can't find it right now)
---
Name says it all
---
Yes if the perk is on that means someone is near you, it doesn’t matter if someone is Injured dying or healthy it’ll stay activated. Also it’s also stays activated if someone is on the hook too. 
---
I would recommend whispers 3.. 
---
I'm PS4 and have always known it as a 'don't save' sign 🤷‍♀️
---
Same.
---
Dont interact with the chest or a locker, those are what should be fucking you over. I've been able to go into the basement to unhook people and such, but any other interaction with lockers/chests down there breaks the game.
---
I’m devotion level 1 &amp; level 22  and Iv never heard of this b4 lol is it new or am I just really stoned when I play
---
Hard agree. "Stealthy," "immersed," or "urban evasioning in a corner" would've worked much better here.
---
Hey man, I noticed a lot of comments blaming you for your bad game. Its easy to lose morale as killer once you start chasing for too long and they start gen rushing you. This psychological aspect is something you will overcome with more experience in chasing and better map recognition.
---
Cheers mate, will definitely keep that in mind next time. Unfortunately all in game, mic and discord audio was captured on one track for majority of this which was a headache to work around. 
---
Thank you 🖤
---
Then you wouldn't want to farm DCs. Much less go for an end-game three gen strat that takes forever. This hypothetical is busted.
---
Hmm free p3s yes please
---
I havent even been able to unhook people or walk past the stairs at all without getting glitched 
---
Maybe make it so you do gens in the dreamland, but no progres can actually be made until you get a skill check?
---
Happy cake day!
---
seems like we are on two different subreddits
---
uhm. what do you mean? as in for the first time or just every season? 
---
Unlimited power
---
For the first time
---
I think it would be best to take off tenacity and have decisive strike and deliverance 
---
Ah yes I forgot. Thanks for the tip.
---
F
---
It’s BE, what did you expect? :p I don’t think I have ever seen a game dev that is less organised. Everything about his game feels clunky, unfinished and half-assed. They genuinely seem completely unable to cope with the success the game has.
---
it has.....its a cheese tactic with little effort and alot of Impact.
---
Thats why almost everyone uses ruin, not because its a thing only skilled survivors can do, but because everyone can do it with little to no effort
---
There’s a slight animation difference when legion is or isn’t using his power. He’ll raise his knife if he’s in frenzy. That’s when you’ll know that they’re gonna try and vault the pallet.
---
I enjoy the challenge of having to escape to earn your points. The Halloween event had everyone complaining that survivors would gather nectar then not care if they died, even trying to die faster so they can move on to another match. This time they not only gotta stay in the game, they have to try to get out, which is beneficial for other survivors. Like they said in the stream, it'll be intense. And sure, it'll be a GRIND to unlock all cosmetics but at least you can pick up 2 or 3 cosmetics relatively easily.
---
Clips like this make me wonder how many times I’ve been juked like this 
---
I had a blast doing the BBQ event. That’s when I first played DBD, after watching my husband play Friday the 13th for weeks. I couldn’t get in to Friday, but DBD is my thing. Better than the husband at playing. He’s a little salty about that lol. 
---
It is not about how often or rare such matches happen, it's about an inherent design flaw in the game, nowadays i have come to accept that you're not SUPPOSED to win as a killer, you're just there to scare them a bit (eventhough nobody is really scared of killers, they are just punchingbags that you can teabag, blind, loop, bodyblock and so on)  
---
Just think about how many options you have as a survivor and how many you have as a killer.   
---
It is not about pips, that's just what the depip squad is called. And i described how you win gg ez as a survivor, don't go unhooking unless that person has lost 1/4 of his bar, and keep doing gens, unhook ALWAYS at the last moment, then learn a bit of basic looping and juking (really basic nothing fancy), and then just get some decent perks and i guarantee you you will have 90+% escape rate. 
---
...like instead of a hatch standoff...
---
hmm, I actually don't remember. I think the first time I sat and seriously decided to hit the rank 1 just for the sake of it and, obviously, with Fred, it took me like a week? I didn't play any other killer and only used noed maybe 6-7 games. 
---
That’s when you need to activate your sharingan.
---
Ur sxy
---
Doesn't F13 have like 200 concurrent players? :D yeah the BBQ event was fun too! :)  
---
I'll be honest, during events is the only time i'm having fun in DbD, you don't care about surviving or killing, you dont care about pips or ranks, you just want to reach your goals :D
---
yeah, doctor is much better, but he said he doesn't want to buy dlcs until he finds out if he actually likes the game... if you do, op, then doctor is your man for tracking.
---
We wouldn't be able to handle the romperroom buffoonery. 
---
Doctor can be countered. May need to drop pallets earlier than you want or not plan on getting that window vault. Legion is just too fast and can miss hits without being punished. 
---
hehe spirit ass
---
She can't even look at you. I live for it! 
---
Again, I'll ask what do you expect survivors to do? Walk around the map aimlessly? Run around in circles? There's nothing cheesy about it.
---
or you could wait it to appear in the shrine... but it probably won't for a very long time

All three perks are crazy op, /s
---
Bruh im nit heavly into all this dbd politics. But I do know the meme around freddy.
---
This made me weak😂💀
---
Same as saboing hooks or camping event gens. Unfortunately the community is able to pull toxicness out of anything. Like the pig being a killer designed not to tunnel, but then being used by most players specifically to tunnel.
---
Yeah, cause one person's going to be able to do multiple gens by themselves while avoiding the killer and not being found once. Right.
---
Lol look at all these goody two shoes. Here’s how you do it, you get a controller, you hold X on the prestige node on a character that is ready to prestige, then press r2 right when it’s filled. Your character should be a different character and the prestige warning should pop up on your screen. Repeat 3 times.

They look very good! My favourites are Meg and Huntress here, great job!
---
Go have your cigarette _because its done._
---
I don't mind tbh. just leave the Discordance.
---
Just scream Wheeeeeeeee and tell your wife your so good you beat the game!
---
Seriously. They got mad lucky with a great concept for a game and have just stumbled into bad decision after bad decision.
---
Luckily for them they have zero competition 
---
ok lol
---
no it dosen't and thats prob how the devs are going to catch people doing this. 
---
Me, also a gay, as I too see Hugh Jackman 
---
It’s almost like the Shrine was designed when there were a third of the amount of teachables in the game currently, and now there are too many teachables for only 4 slots in the shrine 
---
Blood Warden is far too situational, and is extremely easily countered by just 99%-ing the door, if the killer has someone, until they're hooked. There's nothing the killer can do to counter that.

*Save traps in general, but make sure to use 1-2 in early-mid game
---
*Don't tunnel trapped survivors
---
*Patrol boxes at times
---
*Save ambush mainly for pallets whenever you're dealing with a pallet looper and there's obstruction
---
*You can try to uncrouch around a corner and get a grab off a gen, but don't count on it
---
You can ask ask specific questions, the stuff I listed is mainly general stuff
---
I don't need to debunk depip squads, people don't play like that. Marth did that for curiosity,  but no one plays like that because it isn't fun
---
 In general it is very hard to lose a pip as either side. 
---
I bet Freddies and Nurses love you
---
Why do you need help? That skill check looks normal. 
---
What difference does it make though? It's just a skin.
---
I just use Bond in place of Self Care. It gets me heals and then some.
---
Something I accidentally discovered while running Tenacity.
---
If you hold recover and move forward when mori animation is playing you will “escape” it. I wanted to keep it a secret so that I’d never get Mori’d but it’s best if it gets patched 
---
If you’re using it to avoid/lose the killer, they will likely still hear you rustle grass or make footsteps. If you’re using it otherwise, you are wasting time that could be spent running to gens. Walking does the same thing 95% of the time and frees up a perk slot
---
Don’t knock till you try it
---
Well it is kind of frustrating spending hours levelling up a character to P3 and then there’s people who can do it instantly kind of a kick in the dick
---
yeah i just mentioned blood warden because i activated it a good amount of times and it was amazing... the perk really does some great damage when the situation and timing is correct
---
She's not hard to play, when you crouch you get a dash attack but I barley ever use it I just stand back up and attack regularly. When it comes to bear traps it's really all up to how you wanna play. The traps don't start to tick down until a gen or 2 gets done so if you put one on a survivor while all 5 gens are done then it won't tick down but it will slow the game down a little bit more than usual. Although with the traps I've only gotten one actual kill with it and I wasn't even trying to explode his head. Pig is hella fun to play. The perks I run on her rn are nurses, thanat, ruin, and discordance so usually no more than 2 gens get done but usually no gens get done when im keeping good map pressure. If it only 2 survs left and I hook one I'll usually just camp that last survivor while crouching till the other comes to get him. I don't think it's toxic to do that considering the game is over anyway. Most of her add ons are kinda lame or at least I don't use some of them since I never use the croush dash attack so there's no point in using them. My fav add ons for her is the ones that inflict the blindness affect and the hemorrhage affect, it makes it a lot easier to slug people if that's your choice. All I've told you is really how I play. She plays totally different for different add ons and perks so it's all up to you. But she is def fun to play. I'm glad you're trying to pick her up, I never see people using her anymore. :)
---
I thought you wrote a song or something, I feel let down. 
---
Paint brush Freddy, no sound Wraith, wall hack Piggy are also fun. These are easily my favorite builds to play, they are so chill. And if you don't get Lery's you still can pull off jump scare shenanigans. 
---
No sound Wraith is hilarious. You can just stand still next to a gen, wait for them to come, and grab them. 
---
Game Over is hilarious to watch in action.
---
+ people who bought cosmetics for him. A lot of people have the Joey and Susie cosmetics, so that's a lot of refunds they'd have to give out.
---
As someone who has the expensive ass Joey skin, I'd be pissed and wouldn't want a cells refund, I'd want my money back, as that's $10 I wouldn't have spent otherwise. &amp; $18 total is nothing but it's the point of the matter!
---
hitting r1 for the first time on killer feels great but then it sets in and it doesn’t feel so great lol 
---
congrats though i think it’s something to be proud of i know i was 
---
When I'm in voice chat with people, I like to point out I'm exposed. ;)
---
Thanks :), I just wanna hit it one time then never again 😂 I'm perfectly fine being in the purple/green ranks 
---
I might unironically start playing Freddy so I git guder with m1 killers and loops 
---
I 2nd this, this is an amazing image. 
---
I agree. I have the Joey costume and the Susie costume and I would be livid if they deleted legion. I really like those costumes and I want to keep them. Deleting any character from any game wouldn’t be healthy, regardless of if they aren’t good for the game. It’s a case of somebody’s hard earned money or some angry gamers. 
---
Praise!

I’m just talking about the event. They’re not going to completely rework every killer’s power or rebalance the game overnight, so in the meantime it’s nice that they’re trying to provide incentives for people to play nice during the event. 
---
What do u mean? 
---
lmao racist
---
This is such a crap argument. "Well it used to be worse" lol ok?
---
Just read your first post ;)
---
No not nice, I was 100 points off of maxing out :(
---
Ok it *is* on you whether you decide to try or not but I see you're the type of person to argue everything so I'm done here. Have a nice day.
---
Knowing when to chainsaw and when to hammer is something you just need to get a feel for. Leatherface is a pretty straightforward character and most of his learning curve is just figuring out when you'll be able to get chainsaws off.
---
No he's definitely just being a toxic piece of shit.
---
its not normal to get so many points xD i would be happy
---
My first post is of Friday the 13th movies, y would u think I masturbate to that? Don't pin ur freaky gore fetish on me kid
---
Freddy is just so easily abusable by survivors who have more than two brain cells to rub together. Just last week I was going for the Adept Freddy achievement. My obsession was downed, and two awake people ran up and started healing her. What could I do about that? Absolutely nothing. The dream transition isn't fast at all, and there's no punishment to being in the dream transition.
---
Have fun with her, perfect time to learn her since the sounds are back :D
---
*ahem* the one posted to your profile? Also don’t go accusing me of shit lmao. 
---
Not as bad as getting hooked... seeing 3 ppl leave the same gen they're on cos of BBQ and then they run as a group in the same direction till you're in struggle and then ... AND THEN turn towards the hook with the killer in tow.. happens all the time lol.
---
which killer you playin? maybe some specific issues with ending chases efficiently?
---
happens above 10 don't worry about that. 
---
Which is why I don't try to go for gens and just do hatch, lmao.
---
all the gays coming out of the woodwork on this post i love it and i love y’all 
---
has this subreddit gotten to the point where people think doc is good and/or rough to play against?
---
goodness gracious 
---
?
---
Oh geez I’m really sorry one sec 
---
Yea, if I dont get hooked in the first 5 minutes then I usually survive the entire match. If I get hooked at the beginning then I might as well DC
---
Oh no
---
I agree with you, RIP karma
---
No memes, earrape or talking.
---
Just music and gameplay.
---
Hope you enjoy! :)
---
yeah I've gotten out from hatch a number of times its nice.
---
Are you dissing my homeboy Spies From The Shadows?
---
Besides those you earn via generators ofc.
---
So 2 counters still exist
---
I want to comment about dead by daylight but i just hate that guy that suit.
---
Have you seen the Ardetha vids? Nurse is broken AF on some maps. Can't blink at all.
---
Can't we just call it "No Mittens"
---
S and S+ has always been an ultimate lvl thing in a lot of JRPG's for literally ever. People use it in tier lists here.
---
Whatever delusional freak
---
I really hope this is a bait.
---
Freddy is the shittiest out of these three. It's a fact. He's good against bad players and trash against anyone with a brain.
---
That epic slowdown you were talking about is not much at all. You can wake up pretty much instantly after you've been put to sleep.
---
Freddy gets looped for days. He has no ability to counter the loops. He gives you a 7 second warning before he can actually attack you.
---
Freddy has shit map control.
---
And to top it all off, autoaim fucks Freddy super hard.
---
Because he can't hurt people until they fall asleep. So they get a head start on literally every chase, you can't really defend totems or hooks, survivors basically get borrowed time for free because you have to re-sleep them and wait after unhook.
---
It's trivially easy to break out of sleep, and sleep doesnt impose big enough impact. Slowdown is fine, but thats not enough with how easy it is to wake up. Sleeping multiple people is fine, but non potato survivors will just hit a gen and wake up, then gen rush. He has ok stall, but its a half measure. 
---
Trapper isnt a TON better than freddy, but he at least can lock down parts of the map to limit looping. Freddy has to play ring around the rosie all day.
---
Mikey is like 4 tiers ahead of freddy lol one hit downs for a minute is insane snowball potential.
---
25 points, you get 20 for escaping with the vessel and you can only carry one vessel.
---
You can pull both of them into the dream world, then down the obsession again when they stand up. You now have 1 down and 2 who can’t do anything until they blow up a generator. If they run to the 4th guy to get woken up, you can grab him too and suddenly all survivor progress in the match has been completely halted.
---
Sure, you can’t stop them right that second, but they will get hurt a lot more in the long run with Freddy than with another killer.
---
I keep it fresh by taking breaks from the game once in awhile 
---
Insult me all you want, I don’t give a shit, just shows how truly insecure you are. This whole post begging for a glitch proves it even more. 
---
Lol sjw
---
I can't read ant
