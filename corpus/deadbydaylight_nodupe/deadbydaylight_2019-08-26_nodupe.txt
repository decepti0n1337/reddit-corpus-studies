I smell some salt
---
---
---
It definitely should. It should also deactivate whenever the Survivor interacts with something or becomes healthy.
---
Yeah having good headphones is such an impressive skill.
---
Killer Name: Space Marine
---

---
Killer Power: a fucking bolter
---
Oh God that would be terrifying. I want it
---
Eh, up to you. I find that I tend to get beaten by non Swf more often since they aren’t as predictable. Against a Swf you can pretty much know where 2-3 are at any given time and that leads to some serious snowballing, the only time Swf beats me is when the individual players are all good enough that I’d likely have lost even if they weren’t in comms.
---
I dont see a problem with any of those perks
---
You move really quickly in her power. Using headphones makes it easy to find survivors (unless they have iron will, but even then strong spirit players can hear the footsteps/breathing of survivors). 
---
The power is also really strong at most downed pallets. It turns the loop into a guessing game that's heavily in your favor. Just stand at the downed pallet, you can phase to them going left or right, where the survivor can slow vault to escape you. You can counter the slow vault strategy by fake using your power and standing still, which baits a slow vault, you then give a hit.
---
I had a daily that would give 90K blood points for trying to hit survivors right after you blink as Nurse. I play on console so this was infuriating and after getting messaged by toxic survivors I just gave up and deleted the daily. What was my next daily? Mori a survivor as nurse. I sighed loudly and quit the game.
---
There's an old saying: if you mess with the bull you will get horns. 
---
I can't feel bad for ya if you instigate the killer in the first place.
---
&gt;many times has chat been abused when compared to being used to complement the killer on a game well played?
---
For the games that I've played, I would estimate less than 10% is abuse (or an attempt to).  Probably less, but I don't have hard numbers.  And that includes abuse from killer and survivor both.  As I said, if I start the conversation and I'm obviously not a dick or clearly had a fun match and want to thank people for it, other people generally follow suit.
---
It just feels kinda lame when part of her "mind game" is standing still at a loop. Then you have her passive phasing that by random luck can mess you up while looping to give her an easy hit and it leads me to think that maybe shes a little too strong for how easy she is to pick up and use. 
---
To be a good billy or nurse takes time and a decent amount of grinding through games where you get beat by a good group of survivors. With spirit I don't feel like that same level of commitment is needed to start beating up on good survivors.
---
I don't think she needs to be nerfed because its not like shes unbeatable (though I wouldn't complain if prayer beads wasn't a thing anymore), but I just don't have the same level of respect when a spirit steam rolls a game vs a billy or nurse doing it.
---
She is really enjoyable to play as though lol.
---
That moment when survivors can wear headphones
---
Or when their skillset is literally running in tight circles or...holding a button down
---
Such skill. Such mastery. Such grace.
---
I'm a Nea main and don't t-bag except to say thank you to survivors... do I get a cookie?
---
Its just animated badly.
---
So I’m tunneling if I down the rescuer, find the unhooked Survivor nearby because they suck at hiding, down them, and then go back to the rescuer and hook them? It can’t be me outplaying you guys, right? 
---
This might be too much for you to handle, but DS isn’t supposed to be a get out of jail free card.
---
Learn how to loop. Make a note of all windows and pallets and make a beeline to a pallet or window any time you see the killer. Always heal at a pallet. Plenty of YouTube videos on how to not get hooked.
---
Yeah, I can agree with that. It really does seem like she just doesn’t provide enough information. Hoping some people start defending spirit soon though, I’d like to hear the other side of this too
---
I mean they're perks to help survivors against proxy campers and tunnelers, which they're powerless to stop (without those perks) if the killer chooses to go down that path...
---
I love the perk for punishing face campers. When everybody can see the camping they just get the generators done. I hold as long as I can and its an easy win for the team (I don't mind dieing for a good cause!)
---
Bubba's power, for most intents and purposes, is just a weaker version of Billy's. The only place it shines is dealing with multiple survivors in a tight area, which throwing bodies at a hook is one of the few ways to effectively deal with a camping killer. Long story short, it basically means that Bubba is at his best when camping, and there's no better place to camp than the basement.
---
I can't wait
---
Yes.
---
he looks like such a happy trappy  
---
keep us updated pliz
---
Not a fan of the first or third ones. The second one is ok but I kinda prefer what we already have.
---
I personally love that second one, it stays true to the character, and sounds fun to play with. However, I don't really have an opinion on the third, and I really don't see the first one working at all, since the devs themselves said they're not planning on doing anything like that soon.
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture.
---
My group had the pleasure of playing against/with (can't recall which) HEX: Devour Ass in Overwatch.
---
With a good pair of headphones, she becomes almost nurse tier, IMO. You can't see the survivors, but you don't really need to, once you get the hang of tracking them based off of scratch marks and sound. She's faster when using her power too, so she also has good mobility. That, and most survivors below red ranks don't know how to counter her.
---
The funny thing is, I said this EXACT comment would show up somewhere else.
---
Killers would bitch that survivors are too strong because they can't be hit through windows. Well get ready for it. Hopefully dedicated servers stops hitbox lag completely.
---
This is from the webtoon safely endangered

---
I mean I would defend her if we're talking about nerfing her. The only kind of nerf I would be ok with her getting is one that lets her be just as strong as she is now, but makes it so she requires a bit more skill to play as. 
---
I have no idea what that nerf would be, but I definitely don't want to see her turned into a mid tier type of killer.
---
I could feel the mini heart attack you had.
---
I'm thinking it was Predaxx
---
Or I could easily be a Huntress who thinks it is a waste of 1 of the 2. The belt is a given and so are the survivors throwing pallets. We are very much on the same page.
---
Did you check the basement lockers?
---
Do it.
---
Yup. 3 times
---
Exactly, games are meant to be enjoyed.
---
And that's why I DC against spirit, otherwise it's not an enjoyable game.
---
I wouldn’t go so far as to recommend a nerf but it definitely isn’t fun to play against her. The rest of the game is built on being able to outsmart your opponent, but Spirit makes it a complete guess. And if you just pretend to phase at the pallet until they commit to a move (or to staying still) you can guarantee a hit since you can hear breathing/have collision/ can see grass move. Spirit just isn’t fun since a chase is a guaranteed down, so you have to play immersed. Most people don’t like hiding all the time, they’d rather run around and get chased.
---
Yep I was just making a joke cause someone once said that to me
---
Take my upvote minecraft Bob Ross
---
The issue is that survivors already hadproblems being too strong, while its great and all to try and close the gap all your going to end up with is the same issue of OP survivors again unless killers start getting shifted and tweaked themselves. 
---
Many killers (and honestly the game itself) was not designed for this communication or SWF in mind, you give SWF level intel to solo survivors your basically just making killers deal with SWF every game because killer themselves never seemed to get changed based on survivors getting more intel.
---
I just hid there while opened the gate since she got there first. She deserves to be "judged" for being an asshole and dying for it like a dumbass lmao. Sit.
---
Honestly your best bet is to go afk to lure them back into repairing gens then try to catch them once they pop another one or two.
---
When can Ghostface get a Deadpool cosmetic!
---
K
---
yeah, I don’t know how to fix her either. I’m also not sure she needs fixing, that’s why I’m trying to get opinions
---
I feel she's pretty ok, considering there are many perks that can fuck her over pretty bad. Ex spine chill and iron will.
---
I could’ve just said it’s a pig from Minecraft lmfao
---
Wait what? You have to do that? PS4 is spamming x button.
---
Myers*
---
For me, its Spirit. I've yet to have a fun match against one. 5 Blink Nurse? I'll take it. Huntress with Iridescent Heads? I can live with that. Just base Spirit? Well fuck.
---
Yes
---
Honestly
---
I have the power of god and anime on my side!
---
F E N G S A W
---
aw
---
I don’t think a killer should be balanced by perks. If the solution to every problem was “run X perk” then we’d need about 20 perk slots. That being said I also wouldn’t want her to be weakened in such a way that those perks completely destroy her, so it’s a tricky situation. In the meantime I focus more on whether she’s fun or not, she feels kinda like old legion to me: not fun since you don’t really outplay them at all. Instead of outplaying your opponent you simply try to pump out gens as fast as possible so that you can get them done before all of you die. Doing gens is a pretty boring action, and so is playing immersed so spirit just doesn’t lead to fun games in my experience.
---
He, as in a man.
---
Be prepared to be on endless standoffs in Hightower and 2 fort. And if you play the objective you bet your ass is getting kicked.
---
10 years later still holds up damn well though

Most likely, glad we could keep it civil on this sub. Seems to be rare
---
I agree with all of your points it’s definitely not fun on the survivor side but I don’t know what they could do to reduce it just being a guessing game with her, if they add the ability to know when she’s phasing or not then a lot of people would complain and say she’s not strong.
---
“Cute”
---
*Keeps quentin halfway down*
---
No.
---
They would have to add Pewdiepie as a survivor as that damn thing was his mascot back in the day
---
You know, fair point. I can stand corrected lol.
---
No
---
Dunno who downvoted you friend but they’re bad people and wrong. Hopper forever.
---
Careful, u will get bashed and downvoted like crazy. Ppl are hard set on believing it's ping and not HITBOXES what so ever. Or even a combination of the two. Personally I believe it's both, I mean yes ping has SOMETHING to do with it but if the ping is green the entire time in the pre-game lobby and I get hit when I'm behind the killer or 3-4 feet away from the killer or even after vaulting a window and taking a step/two away from it then obviously HITBOXES have SOMETHING wrong with them as well.
---
I'd rather die
---
Combine maps with a bunch of pallets and a 5 second stun you can easily loop killers besides spirit and nurse for a long time costing them the game. Especially since ds activates in the middle of the match when you need to snowball the most.
---
Don't think anyones ever said that
---
Sometimes you gotta take justice into your own hands.
---
Easily loopable when you can’t even see his red stain?!? Yeah right
---
Definetly not, in fact this is the 1000000000000th post about matchmaking lol
---
I FUCKING HATE THESE PEOPLE!
---
I play toxic, I get bitched at.
---
I play regular, I get bitched at.
---
They die, at all and somehow I'M bad.
---
DOING GENS YOU?
---
Lol
---
Wish they could fix it then! Since they have claimed that it's good themselves!
---
10% chance and a deep wound effect? Is this supposed to help the survivor in any way?
---
I’d rather they rework feral frenzy like this; remove FF as a timer all together and instead it’s a meter, hold down LT to break into a sprint, blood is visible and while in feral frenzy attacks can’t down just apply deep wound, Any wound after the first attack the other attacks just reduce the deep wound timer a little, you can see blood in FF so you can use blood perks that mangle or bloodhound, but still no scratches
---
No more camping
---
His neck hole will forever haunt me
---
Chill
---
Hey guys, newbie here. I just bought Barbecue &amp; Chili in the Shrine of Secrets. At which level it will appear in my killers bloodweb?
---
Who?
---
Dis town ain’t big enough for the both of us partner
---
He's not strong, he's annoying.
---
I’ve played against her countless times and I main her as killer. The only counterplay is to walk or try to “mindgame” her but most good spirits won’t get mindgamed. Sure, you can slow vault windows and shit, (assuming you can make it to a window) but at that point it’s just luck if the spirit falls for it or not. Sure, bad spirits can be fucked with, but good ones will appear on your ass and fuck you every time.
---
Sad legion noises
---
If steve has that outfit, you damn sure imma play him
---
You can’t balance when you have people who communicate with each other randomly placed with those that don’t. 
---
It’s not rocket science. The root of all evil starts and ends there. It hasn’t gotten better, just divided. Solos/Duos/Quads will balance the game. Just like any other successful MP game. 
---
Player skill is part of the challenge and you either get better or uninstall. This game is not that hard.
---
As a person who loves the legion(I guess you could say they’re my main?)  I must admit that he’s probably the worst killer in the game. His power isn’t good in a chase, in finding survivors he’s decent at best. He’s only good at slowing the game down but you’re slowing the game down for all sides not just the survivors cuz while yes they’re mending often. You have to focus on using your power in order to stall the game. But your progress on killing them won’t go any further. So it’s just bad. He needs a rework (again)
---
I love the tots madk the shapeis perfect for me and the shape is the most accurate ive seen so far the only problem is that they weather the thing sooo much
---
Staying near the hook for 2 seconds is camping?
---
Also it should teleport the killer off the map, then the game would be balanced
---
Make it 15
---
yea but how would this perk work on other killers lol
---
anus butt lol
---
I never thought about faking her haunting. Hmm
---
Yeah it excessive but the mold is absolutely perfect. I'm going back and forth on the h78 but I heard it runs big
---
They stay in case they have to go for an unhook to save and tbag for entertainment
---
I think it had to do with the PTB. I had to refresh my machine in order to fix the game when I was having crash issues and since then, not One update has failed file integrity.
---
That's like saying GG or using an emote.
---
You get used to it. If they're T-bagging and someone is missing, go find them. Otherwise, farm some bloodpoints by spamming your power until they leave. If you interact with them at the exit gates, they just get free points, so go farm for yourself, and punish them. Maybe you'll manage to trap someone who was able to escape, and get an extra kill or hook.
---
i saw a streamer playing against someone named hex: devour coke the other day and i couldnt stop laughing
---
Where is the Ghostface pop vinyl?
---
.... tea bagging doesn’t really have any meaning (in any game) anymore. It’s a waste of time.  I promise I don’t do that kind of thing. But people who complain about seeing this happening at the exit gate, why are you whining about it? It’s kinda stupid. If they tea bag after stunning you, yea, it’s kinda more dumb of them. But at the gate, really doesn’t prove anything. Just let it go. Calling everything toxic eventually makes “toxic” lose meaning because eventually everybody is just going around saying it for no reason. There are worse things to worry about in life. And you choose tea bagging players in a specific situation. Get over it and just ignore them. They don’t know you and you don’t know them. It’s just a game. They are just being no life kids. But you whining over it like a 6 year old tattling  on a forum is stupid
---
As long as they use the chase music aswell
---
I’d swap meg for Claudette
---
Gaming headphone.
---
Yes he does say that in the show
---
They hated him for he spoke the truth
---
have nancy's cosmetics even been revealed yet?
---
Accurate
---
Both suck
---
It's because with their significantly higher playtime, full meta perks, insta-heals, flashlights, brand new parts and communication, they completely outplayed you with your low level killer. But in all seriousness people are cunts in this game, try to ignore them and don't join their toxicity.
---
Welcome to the Fog.
---
The game just be like that sometimes, chase them out and move on to the next game.
---
Soon you won't be bothered by teabagging.
---
http://fby.pw/3ctN.pn
---
People oh this game never change do they lol.
---
Imagine thinking levels mean anything 🤡🤡
---
I don't know if I agree or disagree, but how would you feel if the killer had to hit skill checks too in order to counter it? And whoever got closer to the middle of the check wins. So it's like an actual fight, when skill is involved.
---
Foresight could be helpful around unsafe pallets or the shack. Also around T and L walls. Depends on if the killer likes to mindgame.
---
just don't tunnel you 4head. ds isn't even close to overpowered
---
They do. I dont work in a game studio but i know it takes a lot of time to get really anything done
---
Read the title maybe? Timer shouldn’t stay on after you’ve hooked someone else. Or maybe it should display under someones name in the bottom left of the screen how much time their get out of jail card has left. Just played a game where this exact scenario happened and dragged the game out to the last generator because someone had it activate, sits on a gen after I hook their teammate and I pick them up with no indication of whether or not they have the perk and get 5 second stunned for it.
---
Nah it’s from Parks and Recreation
---
Had a fun round yesterday while playing ghostface because of rituals.
---
A sneaky Meg evaded me all game, I managed to finish one sacrifice before the last gen popped and the gates were opened. 
---
I managed to hook Meg, turned around and her friend unhooked her right away. I smacked her down again and got hit by DS when I tried to pick her up.
---
This was under a hook right at the open exit gate.
---
They were sitting at the exit, teabagging and having a jolly good time until they noticed that they were all wounded and that I had activated Blood Warden.
---
I got the Meg.
---
&lt;3
---
Pretty garbage perk but ok. What would it be used for?
---
Read the title genius, I don’t tunnel.
---
Oh yeah!! I remember now. Although, that would be a Charlie thing to do
---
Not really, if I down the unhooked quick enough and go to hook them and then find you quickly you will still have DS, your DS should deactivate once someone else is hooked because rn it males it so if you have borrowed and DS you won't get caught even if you aren't being tunneled
---
FWUMP
---
It’s literally OP with other perks, imagine running DS, Flip Flop, Boil Over and Too pretty to die. It’s basically old DS.
---
This happens to me when the queue times as killer get over 5 minutes or so. The matchmaking algorithm gets anxious and puts everyone and his / her mother in my lobby.
---
Or it was a SWF.
---
Ruin is a crutch perk, no doubt about it. I can't tell you how many times I've destroyed the totem and the killer plays like an infant for the test of the match. Like he doesn't know what to do.
---
That being said, I don't care if killers use it. It's part of the game. It's not a particularly fun or balanced part of the game (cough cough looking at you too NOED cough cough), but it's perfectly fair to use, even if it's annoying to play against. I just gen-tap most of the time and it's like Ruin isn't even there.
---
Killers never had any skill check prompts so I doubt they would do this.
---
I play both, more heavily leaning towards survivor, and its fine, literally no real explanation is needed.
---
So DS and Deliverance had a baby, and it's overpowered. You also need to negate it if any other survivor is in the same radius
---
On 1 i think itd be 16 survivors
---
I remenber the legion prenerf he was my main, play with him was very fun . I play in ps4 for that reason I dont have the problem of the dc and everything was fine. 
---
And then come the nerf, play one match and never touch him again fucking devs two millons of BP to the trash
---
His game is as alive as his movie franchise.
---
Your argument is I don’t need one. Why didn’t I think of that?
---
Congrats you’re what’s wrong with the game! Here’s your medal for being the problem player that plagues every lobby with your Whitney attitude: 🏅
---
But isn't that just Spirit Fury with a condition?
---
even so if you're getting hit with ds that means you are killing someone that was recently hooked. that is very easily avoided by just not going after them because you aren't stupid and know they just got unhooked, or you slug em and go find someone else, which is what I normally do. no worrying about ds, no one gets tunneled or 2 hooked in 30 seconds, and everyone wins. simple
---
I had one today but he rage quit halfway through. :(
---
As a guy who usually plays killer and enjoys doing clown every now and then it physically gurts me.
---
Killing people better means the killer is better. Nurse doesnt have amazing map pressure, yet she is #1 because she kills better. Spirit can fuck people out of loops real good
---
Ahh yes, because there totally aren't perks like DS and Borrowed Time To Stop Camping And Tunneling
---
wtf, that’s toxic asl
---
True though 🤷‍♂️
---
Might want to spoiler this
---
You’re not allowed to have fun. Didn’t you know that?
---
I guess some people thin that reposting an old meme makes it a "ne-new" and not a "re-post"
---
I kinda feel like it would be a copy/paste of the Doctor since that game had the whole sanity thing going on
---
It is, a fucking stupid one that no one should ever do, but it is a strategy
---
I always try to do this, it's so unfair to those that are still playing.
---
That's not what I asked.
---
The 16,000th hex: devour ass.. (Claudette deserves an award though)
---
Why would one be needed? You literally didnt make one, why should I have to?
---
They're not siblings, trash content. Downvote me, you know I'm right bitch
---
He’s pretty expensive, I plan on getting him sometime
---
So, essentially, the killer is fucked at endgame? No thank you.
---
Pro: He can injure Survivors easily, and multiple at a time. 
---
Con: ‘Deep Wounds’ has been nerfed to the ground and the whole “not draining in Terror Radius” thing makes him a boring M1 Killer.
---
Killers have grabbed from that distance before
---
For the greater good!
---
if you're a newbie, i'm assuming you don't have a lot of learned perks from other killers ( like me )  
---
it'll appear soon enough
---
the devs in the ghost face reveal livestream stipulated what I commented as how they saw the terms so no it was an update not a rework
---
also the power wasn't changed to much it is still the same overall thing
---
Gj Mikey don't let others dictate how you play.
---
As a killer main i really hate ruin and really any other totem perks they get destroyed so quickly and it's the of the Only ways to slow the game down.
---
No more than a minute into my Matches it gets popped thus my perk slot is wasted.
---
That's what this subreddit is for. Scroll it while you wait for a gamr
---
Ok
---
I mean I run Spine Chill so the whole standing still at pallets thing doesn't trick me. She's alright.
---
Let them tbag smack them and take the free points. Then buy Ghostface and tea bag survivors on the hook. Welcome to the Fog
---
I think she suggested I make the title something similar to that.
---
I have that Jason one
---
This is what he's best at. If it's LF, expect this to happen.
---
My whole day right here
---
I feel cheated on against her because i cant hear nothing like my own footsteps ,breathing, grunts (cuz of my ps4 is an airplane) , you cant really control Scratch marks  unless youre good  and the mindgames are a gamble , not a mindgame
---
This is fucking amazing and I love you
---
The legend returns.
---
If you play wraith you have a foot fetish
---
This perk still stops snowballing/momentum since it makes the killer slug in a bad situation where you shouldn’t slug. Also the rare occasion where swf use the same character cloths so you end up going after the person with ds when you don’t want to.
---
It's not just you. If you really wanted to know, pc have by far the fastest search times, then ps4, then Xbox. I guess you got the short end of the stick.
---
the totems will only be difficult when the perk first comes out and everyone wants to play with the new people and perks. once the new dlc hype goes away it wont fit in the meta unless the heal time is really much faster than finding someone or selfcaring.
---
He'll come over soon enough, patience.
---
What’s he supposed to do/say? People like playing killer and there aren’t enough survivors, if you’re super concerned maybe send a email to the people who can actually help you instead of posting on a sub
---
Ok thanks for the response.
---
Reconsider teabagging myers
---
This.. just look at the survivors like springs, sometimes they bop up and down dont give meaning to it, since it really is a meaningless act
---
I proposed a nerf, you’re not good at reading titles are you?

---
Or BHVR changed their seed rate. Whatever.
---
Shattered bloodweb
---
uhhh Acid Blood doesn't really make sense for any killer except the Xenomorph
---
I recommend a change
---
ok then make it so it never goes away until someone else gets hooked sounds fair to me
---
You’re saying balance again the description of the game  literally says asymmetrical horror game which is the antithesis of balance. Balance literally means equal and this game inherently is about inequality. Also like I said you don’t need to be good to enjoy playing the game.
---
This game really goes to shit as a killer once you get out of levels with a lot of random survivors because then you just end up playing with people who cheat with their friends on discord so then your only chance to get some kills is by camping which you then get flamed for.
---
“How would you feel if the killer had to hit skill checks too in order to counter it? And whoever got closer to the middle of the check wins.”
---
You don’t remember what you said? “Killer had to hit skill checks”
---
It was alright, the skill checks were impossible though.
---
Thats what this one is.  I like it a lot.
---
yeah, much better but it doesn't even need to have acid as part of it other than the name
---
69th upvote. Nice B)
---
Ah, now, there isn’t much the devs can do about Freddy. They paid for his license, they can’t just give him to you for free, that isn’t how this works.
---
There was a post a few months ago talking about making Legion a coop based killer and would be the only killer that could do so.
---
For each legion team member they have less movement speed and thus must use team work to catch survivors and survivors also take 3 to 4 hits to down rather than 2.

Because it’s in a better spot than it was. If I would make any change to it, it would be after the hooked person is fully healed you can’t use it. The counter to your argument is you down the person saving immediately and hook them and then down the original hooked person pretty much instantly. Ds isn’t just protecting from a tunnel but also protects from a farming survivor.
---
Ah yes, the classic *”I need to Mori a spray paint Nea right now”* kind of day.
---
so that sounds like an swf problem then not a perk problem. it's not the perks fault that the survivors are wearing the same thing. and like I said, slug and find someone else, it's pretty much the same effect as a hook, just no ds. I've been rank 1 killer for around a year now and I have never had any problems with ds so idk why your so bummed about it
---
We need to go deeper

U/Dcook4444

We need those #stonks
---
Its fine its the only social action they can do while waiting if theres a dance in the game they would be dancing at the exit gate.. its also a tactic as to not give away that they're already gone
---
This is cute, don’t let everybody get you down, the Art is nice!
---
Oh. You make a new psn account is what I meant. Add me Onedart-1kill and ill teach you the bassics of the game.
---
This is why I never go near the basement when facing bubba, or if I know I'm going to get downed in the next 10 seconds, I do a suicide run in the exact opposite direction of the basement
---
Facecamping is a strategy. A shit one, but it's a strategy.
---
Same situation bu with 1600 ac, im most definitively getting Kate badass biker tho
---
This! Sounds like a fair compromise to me. Now survivors who are tunneled never have to worry about eating up their own timer in chase.
---
My unhook, gens is 'e', skillcheck, pallet 'q'

I’m crying lmfaoo

Rank -1
---
messaged him after, he was a complete cunt
---
Kate got kiddnaped tho lol
---
DS is in a fine spot but I agree the timer needs to adapt more to the scenario of the game. It works perfectly when a killer tunnels a survivor immediately off a hook, but if they get away, heal, and even start gens or get a save, there's no reason for it to still be active.
---
I’m not a survivor main but I use DS on all my survivors. It’s just too damn good to not use. That being said, 95% of the time I feel DS is fine and 5% it’s BS. Here’s my suggestion for DS:
---
Increase the timer to 90 seconds instead of 60. Any survivor hooked after DS activates reduces the timer by 60 seconds. That means even if another survivor is hooked, they had at least 30 seconds to GTfO of the area.
---
So, it’s a buff to the tunnel aspect of the perk but reduces the chances significantly of a killer getting DS’d from bad survivor plays. I think this is fair for both sides since survivors still have tunnel protection and then some (with buff) but killers aren’t punished for actually hooking multiple survivors.
---
I'm curious. What exactly is "map pressure"? I figured, with Nurse's crazy fast blinks and ability to be almost anywhere on the map quickly, she'd have tons of it.
---
Deliverance is balanced. It’s a strong ability but with a heavy drawback, and a good activation condition.
---
Sometimes on here, my insta is VohelART, you?
---
Roblox has a dbd mod. It’s actually pretty good looking.
---
I think all those killers are better than Wraith, personally. I think he needs the most help.
---
Looks great!
---
Why am I opposed to people making a chase go long? Because there are four survivors, and one killer. If all four survivors are able to loop a killer that has no counter to looping, the killer is going to lose without a doubt. And looping is incredibly simple when you understand this game.
---
i don't frequent this sub and didn't know this joke had already made the top and genuinely thought i was the first making it, but i hope you guys still like this ❤️
---
They said they'd look into it but that it's difficult to do.
---
Honestly he could use some sort of buff as well
---
Also totem perks are kinda crappy as they get broken too quickly and ruin is too essential at high ranks

That’s because the only people who care about vegans are vegans.
---
This is a great idea for a buff since it only stops tunneling and not actual players that play the game normally.
---
He’s having the gaming experience of a life time
---
No. The perk itself is already overkill, but the stun shows your bias. You have to imagine it working with other perks, not just alone. Combine with DS, an exhaustion to extend the chase beyond DS, an instant heal, and a variety of other factors would make you invincible for far too long.
---
I main killer and never seen a toxic feng, 8-12 is a sacred place i don’t want to get out of
---
GOD damn that icon is disgusting
---
Can someone ELI5?
---
This gave me whiplash
---
Depends on schoolwork, if friends want me to play another game, or if I just feel for Minecraft that day
---
Arguably with her mindgame potential she can be very strong in a chase as well, but that's the part that depends on the player. That's why she's #2.
---
Don't stand in the loop tiles. Easy counter.
---
Hooked survivor will most likely get unhooked by the time you down the person with ds and then the team plays stealthily or does gens while a slugged person sits far from the team. Best scenario they get slugged by their team, worst they hide in a locker so you can’t even slug them.
---
2 guys dced so i just thought i would give these ones a win, they tbagged the dc guy so they got my trust
---
You would think with the name “Legion” and there being multiple killers in one killer, they’d come up with some creative shit. Like, some super mind gamey stuff being able to utilize each killer in the same trial.
---
😡😤 YALL NEED TO TAG YOUR SHIT WITH SPOILER
---
Anyone down voting you is a spirit main with anal beads for the super sweat.
---
Im a newbie, map control is just mobility right? So i can pressure gens?
---
Devs wanted to give those survivors time to actually play the game. Not getting hooked endlessly. No one is going to play survivor if they get back to the hook every N-th minute.
---
Maybe it’s time to switch over to killer
---
Happy clock
---
With the big moves BHVR is making and going for non conventional killers/survivors that’s a pretty good idea. Getting Grunt might be difficult but I bet PewDiePie would be really nice.
---
Or maybe that facility at the end of season three? It could be amazing, and hopefully spark the series again. I doubt it but itd be a cool, and maybe a exit gate is the door to the wasteland?

Why does everyone seem to have a really tough time coming up with actually balanced perks when they make concepts?
---
Got that too some time ago , i was like whoa wtf
---
We need a perk as killer where it says "Killer can mori anyone at anytime just by lookong at their direction in the entire map"
---
1 of the best killers. Can see scratch marks and hear survivors, if you're good at tracking with sound you can find out exactly where they are.  You can also still collide with them when invisible so you can use that to find them too
---
I have an idea to fix this. Survive with friends must be that, you can only play with ur steam friends. You require a minimum of 8 survivors and 2 killers. Increase the map size slightly, add more hooks and double the gens. Or you know just prohibit the use of third party chat systems.
---
That makes us equal, I'm really unclear what you are trying to achieve here aswell. I'm assuming you are just letting off some steam after a rough game or two?
---
slugging the survivor is still viable cause other players have to waste time trying to pick them up
---
No u

---
I think my app would crash if I tried to put that much salt into one photo
---
was on mobile, didn't know it was broken XD that being said I feel I posted a coded message and you deciphered it.
---
And it’s such an under used perk too. It seems like a lot of survivors don’t want to run perks like BT/kindred because it doesn’t directly benefit them. But if every survivor ran BT/kindred, I’d bet you would never see a camper/tunneler again!
---
Im using It for when i get basement hooked
---
It's probably to stop him trapping someone in a corner and getting to EW3 without them being able to do anything.
---
Kind of your fault for not looking around to try and Identify where the killer was when your spinechill lit up
---
Ewww self care i play with friends and still run bond i cant play without it lol
---
It's completely unreliable though. The Spirit has to hope the survivor falls for any mindgames which gradually gets less common in higher ranks. She isn't #2 and I'd barely consider her #3
---
Well deserved.
---
It’s her main mindgame
---
Did some people not know about stranger things before DBD?
---
same
---
Really good but I do think there should be a way to remove the chest burster. I know it doesn’t for the Alien lore but it would be a bit op if you couldn’t stop it at all
---
when?
---
As a survivor main I 100% agree with this. They just need to learn how to deal with it just as they learned to play the game in the first place. I honestly feel accomplished when I get around it.
---
Some points:
---
&gt; I can do the same exact thing for killer if I wanted by citing ebony moris and Prayer Beads Spirit 
---
You still have to be downed twice. There's plenty of pallets and cancer loops that let you get away on top of the 2nd chance perks. You can easily counter play Spirit. You can even equip Iron Will to make it easier to counter play Spirit. There is zero counter play to Instant Heal, to a sabo toolbox, to a team using mics, or just terrible maps. BTW, a majority of survivors just DC when they see that you're using Mori's but that's okay, right? They're allowed to do that. But if killers DC when playing against asshole SWF groups that's just being a pussy, right? Do you not see the hypocrisy? 
---
&gt;Survivors lost quite a lot over the past year of updates in the name if trying to make killer feel more fun and less oppressive.
---
And it's still unbalanced. Namely because of SWF with mics but the 2nd chance/get away for free perks aren't helping. 
---
&gt; Your complaining about swf with comms is just pointless though. SWF isn't going anywhere as obnoxious as the can be to face at times it's a large part of the community and a feature that isn't going anywhere so instead of focusing on whining about it just work at playing your best killer game possible because they are not invincible.
---
Again, you're not listening. They COULD balance the game around SWF or better yet reward the killer with something per number of SWF players or penalize them in some way. Either the killer moves quicker, breaks pallets quicker, or the squad suffers blank % action speed reduction. Also, in general, survivors are rendered deaf and blind to the killer when they're hooked. There, done. I balanced it. 
---
&gt;Players like you with this victim complex crying for the nerfhammer are the problem in this community.
---
No, people like YOU are the problem because you don't listen, don't care, don't want to admit to anything (I'm sure admitting Haddonfield is broken was stunning and brave for you). If you actually gave a fuck about this game you'd be hammering the devs to improve upon it so it's a better experience for everyone instead of shouting down and straw-manning any and everyone who rightfully criticizes it.
---
You looked in one way only. When spine chill lights up, look in all directions. Its ok that you didn't know, but now you know so you can survive in the future

What else are they supposed to do when the killer is tongue kissing them while they are on hook? Just sit there and be bored till they die?
---
8 Survivors 2 killers seems more like a bonus game mode then anything else and for when people have a full team KYF exists.
---
Its borderline impossible and rather silly to try and police third party chat programs, especially when they put SWF as part of the game in the first place. End of the day its somewhat the devs fault for having no foresight to design the game with the idea in mind that people will want to play with friends, keeping in mind that SWF had to be added post launch so there is a clear implication that the devs did not intend for it to be a present element. 
---
Again all the issues come back to the same core problems, Looping is stifling for both survivor and killer meta and Generators are done too fast, but their duration can not be increased because the core interaction of generators is one of the most boring elements of the game. Every issues this game has sweeps out from that, including SWF, why is SWF's so strong, because being able to know exactly when to get back on gens is super powerful in a game where the killer is not physically given enough time to do their jobs.
---
They could've done totems, though. NOED is supposed to be a counter to gen rushing. 
---
I think once that new totem perk is out, people won't be complaining about NOED as much, because survivors will finally start doing totems. There will be an obvious reward besides points, which will help move them off of gens. The only thing that the devs need to work on is totem spawns.
---
I agree that NOED is badly designed though. I don't like perks that reward you for the *other side's* mistakes, instead of rewarding you for actually doing things yourself. But at the end of the day, the survivors could've stopped it.
---
Shame on the killer for facecamping. Shame on your teammates for attempting to save you when they knew he was facecamping.
---
If you know the killer is staring at a hooked survivors ass do gens.
---
I swear, if this ends up like for honor in which a single disconnect, no matter the reason, results in a temp ban I'm dropping this game
---
More like best kind. They allow other teamates to do gens uninterrupted
---
as a spirit player. this post makes me happy. along with the one where the spirit is just poking her head out of a window like a cat while a nea and jane just scream at her
---
i mean i guess if they did this there wouldnt be anymore debate on who the weakest killer is
---
Now that is a wholesome meme.
---
mine is AnYuhBad
---
My opinion on what needs to be done:
---
- Remove collision when phasing.
---
- Rework some of her addons, notably prayer beads. 
---
- Give her a vaulting animation 
---
- Make it so sound is slightly diminished when phasing (only slightly though, I'm not saying make it so you can't hear shit).
---
- Reduce the frequency of passive phasing or make it so it at least gives you some sort of clue when it's happening. 
---
Those are my main issues with her.
---
As a killer who mains Spirit. Give her an animation that shows the survivors she is phasing. Such as, her husk gradually fading over the course of the phase duration.
---
Where is this photo you speak of? I must see it.
---
Don't ever say fortnite when talking about dbd again. Unless it is dbd is amazing fortnite is gay
---
Hehe I want emotes so I can dance on killers!!!!
---
The perks wouldnt work. They have to be able to be on any survivor
---
Freddy likes grabbing people with their pants down, so that fits
---
sounds more like potato survivors than a good strat but ok
---
With my luck I'd fail the skill check. 😥
---
I wonder if the new status effect thing with Killers will mean that Insidious counters Kindred or not, hope it doesn't.
---
underpowered add old MoM in it too just for safety
---
I’m suuuper confused
---
I wish I could sad react this
---
Spirit is just behind the Nurse in terms of power.
---
You get my upvote glad this subreddit isn't completely full of people that dont care for others fun. I hate when people say that they just want the 4k however they can and they run spirit with anal beads and noed just in case. I remember first playing this game I barely saw toxic killers that would run "meta" perks and addons but recently I can't get a game without one
---
Lolol imagine getting facecamped by bubba while he infinite dabs on you!
---
Ah yes, so run away and she can see your scratch marks
---
thats the thing though, OP was wondering why they can't map their actions more specifically, because self care and unhook both have the same button input and they can't be changed seperately, making it annoying to fake unhook, then save as you will occasionally start to self care instead of unhooking.
---
There used to be a glitch where if the chainsaw registered in the exact moment that a survivor initiated the pallet vault interaction, the chainsaw would end up not registering on either, leaving both the survivor and pallet intact. In the process of addressing this and another similar "phantom hit" glitch (both exceedingly rare, by the way), BHVR first introduced a weird cone registry to the chainsaw that even persisted for a moment after the chainsaw swing had ended. That led to a ridiculous situation where the chainsaw registered a lot more liberally and the killer briefly had a death aura after ending a chainsaw, running into which meant you instantly went down.
---
They've since remedied those issues, but now their solution is that the chainsaw will simply register on both the survivor and pallet in most cases. Basically if the sliding animation has not fully played out, and the chainsaw registers on the pallet, the survivor is going down as well. The fact that latency inherently favours killers also factors into this (so hopefully we'll see a change in this behaviour with dedicated servers).
---
Spine Chill is a pretty good counter to Spirit's mindgames. It's a great perk in general, honestly. I never play without it.
---
His head should take up the whole screen because he's a fatass
---
how would a perk that reveals auras force stealth? hiding in a longer for x seconds until the effect ends isnt stealth. if anything it punishes stealth because theyre close to you but dont get seen without the perk
---
Yea but to that survivor getting tunneled it sucks to sit on hook only to get chased again and downed again only to be put on the hook again
---
Bro I have over 800 hours on the game I’ve played against spirit enough to know there is no form of reliable counterplay. You can take your chances, but luck isn’t reliable counterplay. I know players way more experienced than me who will say the same thing too. So don’t act like I’m some survivor main who’s new to the game and crying about killers, because I’m not. Just because I disagree with you doesn’t mean I have “a lot to learn”
---
Bitches love cannons.
---
This one made me fall off the toilet!
---
Rn im leaning twards just kate and demo hc nancy might get a nerf
---
really looking forward to this update for that perk so more ppl will do totems
---
I'm in an arguement with a guy right now saying that if a camping killer gets a 4k it's the survivors fault lol.

theyre the worst kind if you play to actually have fun rather than play do gen rush and leave.3 people get a boring ass 3 minutes of gen simulator, last guy gets face camped. woo fun game

It's a bit pathetic yeah. Way better since endgame collapse became a thing but I spectate other survivors after I escape sometimes and genuinely see them teabag at the gates for 1min 57secs when the killer isn't there, can't see them and obviously doesn't plan on coming. 
---
Also the amount of kills you'll get over time from downing a survivor that waited for you but misjudged their distance to the exit is stupid. But then the whole thing is stupid.
---
Entity: I have altered the deal. Pray I don’t alter it any further.
---
If you are talking about p3 claudette then I agree but if someone is unhooked and chase the scratch Mark's to see that it's the guy that just got of hook you shouldn't hook him atleast down him and look for someone else
---
you didn't invent gas masks
---
It is plague
---
&gt;the vast majority of Spirits phase back to every hook immediately to rehook the same survivor. Happens constantly and there is extremely little they can do about the situation.
---
DS is the *perfect* counter to this exact scenario, though. If this happens to someone every game and they don't start running DS, then it's on them, IMO. Borrowed Time is good too. All three of Steve's perks are anti-tunnel in some way as well, so when those come out we'll have even more options. 
---
There are tools available to fight this stuff, people just need to use them.
---
I agree with you 100% it's sad how many games that happens nowadays

i dunno, easy is answer is entity a dumbass. Although if you want to solve the current issue, thats just how i do it so I can pip. Seeing that the game went to fast, manually extend it

What I dislike is her “mind game” of standing still.
---
Especially if she is standing at a window staring at you, you have to account for 3 possible mind games: (1) She’s standing still. (2) She’s using her power. (3) She’s vaulting.
---
It’s just really annoying trying to guess when and what she’s doing. It feels as if there is no counterplay at all in some situations.
---
The full skin does have mustard gas, burnt skin, and the belt going across the middle
---
Id like to see you try. Trust me, it's not worth the 
---
.5 seconds.
---
Thank you for making it even better.
---
2 seconds.
---
If you are referring to pallet camping, I don’t do that. I will admit at jungle gyms there is *some* counterplay, but it’s luck based on whether she predicts you correctly, and if she does, you get hit no matter how well you play it. And open tiles are an automatic hit. She just has to stand and wait for her power to charge, and they either a) vault because they think your phasing, or b) don’t vault then get phased on and hit. Keep in mind, I’m talking about spirits who know what they’re doing here

The original film’s writer, Victor Miller, had been battling to receive rights to characters he helped create such as Jason and Pamela Voorhees. After winning the legal battle, the previous rights holder Sean Cunningham retaliated with consecutive lawsuits, freezing all future F13 content until they come to a settlement.
---
I love that, toss the opinion thing out then follow it up by saying your opinion has more opinions therefore it is no longer an opinion. 
---
And billy has a 1 hit down, takes pallets down quicker on top of that map pressure. Spirit can juke morons at best.
---
Who are the youtubers in the vid
---
That’s the real tragedy of the F13 Lawsuit!
---
*intense piano music*
---
This has happened to me too. I would love to be able to turn off post-game chat.
---
As a dedicated killer main I hate this.
---
I almost always have the terrible luck of killing three survivors and patrolling the exits and hearing a crow go off...
---
I walk to the crow...
---
I immediately realise
---
The crows are moving.
---
Someone was camping all game.
---
Lucky bastid
---
This, on another post i was telling someone else how it hasnt even shown up on my level 41 doctor
---
I dont believe people actually find inner strength so useful.... cleansing a totem is a 10 second ordeal...
---
Then after getting injured, finding and entering a locker is another 10+second ordeal, times may vary.
---
Then another 8 seconds to heal in the locker...
---
Bruh that's a minimum of 28 seconds and probably more that shits so much slower than normal healing.
---
first off, i dont disagree with you, let people play what they want. but NOED is not and never was considered 'META'. it is a crutch perk, making up for previous bad gameplay. META would be running stuff that wont let survivors get to the point where NOED should be activatable
---
Alright, thanks a lot dog! Self care is falling off huh? Any particular reason?
---
haha, i'm really happy console players don't get bill but i do on steam
---
Not even that just hate it how survivors can just spew whatever hateful thing they want.
---
Hm makes sense. Thanks a lot dude
---
Got back to back gruesome cakes, so thank you very much!
---
Even then it's still pretty much nothing.
---
thanks!
---
I explained my opinion dude, and why I think yours is wrong. That's how a discussion starts. 
---
Billy only gets his 1 hits against dumb survivors who aren't good at positioning.  Unless you have add ons, i don't really see a difference in the time it takes to chainsaw a pallet. Spirit depends entirely on outsmarting the survivors along with her map pressure, which is why I think she's #2. She depends entirely on the person playing her.
---
With the surge of Newbie players coming with the Stranger Things launch, EVERY Killer should facecamp tea baggers.
---
Maybe we can thin out the herd of toxic players before the new DLC
---
I don't know why people enjoy anything I do
---
I'm holding you to it
---
It looks like jane is biting her hand and i cannot unsee it 😂 looking at this on a phone though so thats probably why
---
Dope cosplay 👌
---
The only difference with wraith is that he's less risky.
---

Eeyy can i draw two of those perk images for you. I would love to do that

Oh ok well thanks for replying I appreciate it

---
There were so many good ideas that were accepted by both sides on how legion should be changed. But devs decided to bury him.  
---
But i think they decided not to rework him because they were already working on a Freddy rework. Along with making new killers, it would have probably been to much for them to handle.
---
Before the endgame collapse update you could hatch-grab, but you can't anymore since you can close the hatch.
---
I farted.
---
Because she is.  Her map pressure is strong (Because if you are in her terror radius, you already have to be careful of her being on top of you in the next .5 seconds basically), but it's her absolute "I kill you if I see you" a good Nurse can do that makes her overpowered.  The fact she completely bypasses all survivor counterplay they can try and use is what makes her overpowered.
---
Depends on my mood and what they did.
---
&gt;Ebony Mori's are not that uncommon at high bloodweb levels. I agree it's a stupid daily though (Survivors who DC or suicide on the hook to deny it) Pays a ton of BP however.
---
If you don't own every licensed DLC, they are fairly rare. Splinter offerings take their places in between ultra rare add-ons.
---
The predator. Rambo as a killer, the black lagoon creature. A gremlin that is small, low lethality but causes gen fails to injure you. Can also do traps. A banshee, wendigo, and a witch doctor native. 
---
How bout a wearwolf?
---
It's not only red ranks anymore. After rank reset I waited a couple days and played to start getting back up and even at rank 15 through 5 I played nothing but spirit, nurse, and freddy's. And even after they gave freddy a huge buff in map pressure every single one camped and tunneled. One said he tunneled to see if we would try to body block him lol
---
Technically Distressing doesn't do anything on sleeping survivors. The lullaby is completely static and unaffected by anything just like with Huntress. The terror radius technically still exists but sleeping survivors don't hear it, but are still effected by it for stuff like Stake Out and Borrowed Time. Even Insidious still plays the lullaby.
---
I do wish Pill Bottle reduced the lullaby to 24 meters though. It reduces your phasing vs awake survivors so you're only visible in glimpses at 24 meters and fully visible at 12 meters. It's cool but I wish the lullaby was affected in some way since you can run a "Sneaky" build and survivors will prefer staying asleep so they can hear the lullaby at 32 meters.
---
I miss Red Paint Brush Z-Block M&amp;A Old Freddy. NO TR whatsever in the dream world, and a 3 second dream transition on Lery's turned Freddy into Mirror Myers on crack.
---
That’s why hatch stand-offs were a thing. If you as a survivor went for the hatch the killer could just grab you if they hadn’t swung at you first.
---
The Alien Face
---
Tbh if we are dipping into the Ryan Muprhy verse then i think an AHS chapter could be cool! Bloody face would be a nice addition to the game.
---
Cool art! I like to play vs Spirit using a point system. Playing a game versus Spirit earns me a point. Disconnecting versus Spirit loses me a point.
---
I rarely have 1 or more points.
---
Hope was ok before the changes. It’s shit now. Lightweight is a much better perk depending on where you are in the map can help you get away easier. 
---
It’s godly in cold wind farms with all that corn.
---
I’ll see that and raise you:
---
The King knocks the survivor down. They cower in fear. He reaches behind him, pulls out a Whopper, and gives it to them. Instead of lying there dead they just sit there eating the burger for the rest of the match.

Not really much to say. Prayer/anal beads needs to have an audible cue so its more fair. Other than that, not much to say.
---
***DON'T GO IN MY CLOSET:*** Whenever a survivor exits a locker more then 32 meters away from the killer, their aura is revealed, all pallets within a 100 meter radius are instantly broken, and the killer gains a 100% movement speed bonus.
---
*"I AM GOING TO RAPE YOU"*
---
sadly I think he was a slight bit early :/
---
This is a discussion about bugs...not looking fur support on bugs -_-
---
Yep. I own all licensed DLC. Tbh I wish the splinters were a different rarity because as you mentioned they take up the same rarity as Ebony Moris and ultra rare addons.
---
*reads title* 
---
Lol.
---
Really? I didn’t think I heard like a stun noise at all tbh
---
And more useless, since, unlike nurse, wraith is quicker than the survivors. Oh, did I not mention that survivors will, assuming they don't blink, WILL outrun a nurse on a straight path?
---
She is, she’s just can’t go as long a distance as the other high tiers. She’s the best killer in the game because her skill cap is almost infinite. Her ability is literally walk hacks. A decent nurse can down a survivor in about 30 seconds of the survivor is good at loops and jukes. A truly good survivor might even be able to give her the slip. But a truly excellent Nurse can down someone in 15 seconds flat, regardless of Survivor skill. Nurse is by and far the strongest killer in the game, she’s in a tier all her own, but to be the best of the best requires an insane amount of practice and skill.
---
Just curious what program is this in?
---
Press start, press Y, press Leave game. Works everytime.
---
Slightly too early he was at the end of the animation when it was dropped u gotta do it right when it finishes
---
Happens to all of us tho
---
A drug related kit that can slowly KO survivors. And his signature Cosby shuffle as he meanders over to you shouting about his puddin pops!
---
you're right, they are working as intended. tell Bill to learn what he's doing or stop wasting pallets
---
Dude it so freaking annoying
---
What a rollercoaster of emotions lol
---
Happend with tru3 as well he literally spotted ghostface behind a wall and went wtf
---
I love amnesia, I’m all for this
---
I play both sides, and as a survivor I only run DS during double BP events when tunnelling is more prevalent.
---
Why do you feel that DS is overpowered?
---
DS is an anti-tunnelling perk that can be used aggressively by more advanced players. It used to be available to any player any time they were picked up. Non-obsession players who were running the perk had to struggle to a certain percentage to get the perk to activate, but I believe it was a lower percentage (30 maybe?).
---
Now, DS only activates when the killer picks up a player that has been recently hooked. Unless it's end game, there's very little reason to pick someone up a second time within this period. If it is end game and it's the only survivor remaining, you can either slug and wait, or pick up, risk the stun and chase.
---
The counter to DS is to not pick up someone who was recently hooked. This is why DS is not overpowered. If you have to down someone who was recently hooked, you can change strategy and slug them. This both slows the game, and usually forces another player to come to the area of the slugged player.
---
The important part of the approach is not to get too focused on one person. Doing this just empowers the survivors who run DS. By spreading your attention, it robs them of the ability to use it against you.
---
Okay? But most do? And then I explained why?  If you have something to go against that, please enlighten me. But as far as I know I'm right.
---
If the killer leaves me dying, my first plan of action is to crawl to a safe place so the killer can’t find me if he decided to come back and so my team mates can safely rescue me. THEN I start recovering.
---
What changes?
---
I'm solo all the time and I NEVER use self-care because I know its a waste of both a perk slot and time. Literally just bring a medkit. I absolutely detest teammates that bring self-care and waste 1-2 minutes a game just healing in a corner and feel no guilt whatsoever leaving them to die on hook if it comes down to trying for a save or escaping.
---
welp, guess it's about time i unfollow this sub again
---
I’m sorry for your loss
---
Wack that you still get the stun point for it haha, thanks for telling me I had no clue tbh
---
thank you!!
---
Damn, it do be like that sometimes. Thats why i started running kindred.
---
Mouse and Keyboard
---
I would have wanted Hopper and Joyce.
---
I'm fuckin schleep with these comments 😂😂😂
---
In my opinion Leatherface should have the hair of the survivors he kills as well, like meg's braids, Ace's shades, Feng's Feng.. Make the masks more distinct. It should also add more survivors.
---
I run across more cancer David’s while playing as David than any other character
---
Just got out of a game at rank 7 and saw a rank 17 teammate in the post game, I was mad at them during the game for being useless but then I was just mad they were even in the game.
---
lmao
---
How the fuck did you play with console players on a pc holy jesus.
---
Teamwork is the best way I think. It sucks but one person baits away and another goes for the save. That’s really the only sure fire way to combat camping but it still isn’t a guarantee unfortunately.
---
Where did you get these, I need one!
---
Most killers can be bought with in-game currency, but licensed ones (Freddy, Myers, Pig, Leatherface, Ghostface, and now Demogorgon) cost real money
---
Depends on what u consider a lose. U can't expect to kill all 4 every game. I consider 2 or more a win. On average I kill 3 survivors but I'm a nice killer and I don't camp, tunnel or slug either simply cause ik how they feel and I'd prefer not to put others through the annoyance... That is unless they are toxic Tbagging/flashlight clicking dicks, then they deserve it and idk getting a 1k :)
---
killers on this sub: why wouldn't i run meta noed
---
killers when facing survivors using meta builds: ok ur all toxic swf
---
The endgame timer ... the boost percentage is not worth it. It’s better to have borrowed time to help hooked players. But that’s how I play, to leave no one behind, 
---
I’ve looked at hope as a selfish endgame perk.
---
I love Pig! On her I run : Whispers, M&amp;A, Enduring, Ruin. 
---
I use whispers to find survivors, and the added reduction to my TR from M&amp;A lets me get in closer before I crouch. You can grab people off of gens pretty easily that way, assuming they don't have Spine Chill.
---
With the exception of if you're a couple feet away from a pallet, it's usually always better to instantly start recovering. The killer already knows you're there and can easily hear you in the area, so hiding is usually never really plausible unless they completely leave you, in which case it is still better to recover so that other survivors can easily just pick you up within a second

I also mentioned 2 killers. A different way could be having a killer and a half, like someone could play as the entity and help the killer. Also I'm just brainstorming, I'll edit my comment so it doesn't say "Me big brain has answer".
---
No. Feel free to use your powerful stuff. Send us to whatever map you want. Insta heals, flashlights whatever. But dont be pissy at me for running op stuff as well. There are no rules about what perks you can bring. Same with items, add ons, and offerings. Surviving is about not dying. Killing is about making them die.

Yeah but Disney shouldn't own copyright on everything. Disney makes an absurd amount of money and owns practically every movie that hits theaters with success. They don't need the extra money from Spider-Man. It's just Disney being greedy and wanting more control. They're trying to make it Power Play on Sony. I hate the idea of Disney owning everything. Disney already ruined Star Wars and MCU looks garbage now anyway. Who cares if Spider-Man can't be with crap Heroes like non super soldier Captain America or Captain Marvel.
---
Disney Spider-Man only made money because it's Spider-Man and he's in the MCU. Spider-Man out of the MCU is pretty much guaranteed to make money. Add him in the MCU and it's guaranteed to make more money. People like you who side with corporations like Disney honestly disgust me. They have a monopoly and they need to be stopped.
---
Nice edits =)
---
Whatever the anatomy, it makes me uncomfortable
---
Common terms
---
SWF: survive with friends
---
Tunnelling: focusing on one survivor only while ignoring others
---
Camping: staying close to a hooked survivor for longer than 5-10 seconds without much reason
---
Face camping: standing in front of a survivor and waiting for them to die
---
Toxic: something that doesn't have much if any counterplay
---
Looping: the act of a survivor running around an area with the killer chasing them.
---
NOED: no-one escapes death. A perk many survivors dislike as they see it as a crutch perk.
---
Decisive: decisive strike. Before it's nerf it was almost a guarenteed second try. After it's nerf it is now an anti-tunneling perk
---
It’s teachable from Laurie Strode at level 30 or in the shrine
---
Imagine calling someone garbage for using MnK on *PC*. What a clown.

dude NOED was confusing tf outta me thank you!
---
I got Spirit a blue uniform because it looked cute, cost shards, AND I WANTED TO PUT CLOTHES ON HER. 
---
But let’s be honest - people who play Huntress wish they lived in Rapture,
---
Put BP into Laurie Strode until shes level 40, then you can unlock the teachable for the perk that allows you to use it on other survivors.
---
he wouldnt even hook you. just maul you to death. ignores any vault and instead breaks through it
---
Running a perk that only benefits your teammates is not a risk I’m willing to take as a solo survivor.
---
And even still, nurse would be OP.
---
*replaces all other perks*
---
Idk about you but I cleanse totems anyway.  In addition, locker spawns are pretty easy, and usually on your way to a gen anyway.  Finally, 8 seconds of healing is much quicker than 32 seconds or whatever self care is now.  The only bad thing about this perk is it's one use and then a waste of a slot. It seems decent otherwise.
---
I got called trash for getting a 2k and playing fair not tunneling and ect. So i said ggez
---
&gt; there's no need to be placing that many traps around basement and shack
---
Any more than 3 is excessive
---
well my point is you wouldnt have lost so many blood points if you used a white ward and odd bulb
---
bad killer mains*
---
How do you figure?
---
Could run enduring /spirit fury to end chases faster, or the classic brutal strength, pop, overcharge and nurses
---
Fat ass bitch
---
Ikr, currently getting rid of them
---
Awesome. Thank you!
---
I REBUKE YOU DEMON 
---
~Zap~
---
Are there any of Trapper?
---
I'm talking about the poor soul on the hook. If you have a killer camping you is that fun? Would you just chill there in a struggle simulator?  It's not fun for the hooked survivor or the people doing the gens.
---
I was mainly curious because I wanted to look into doing stuff like this myself. I was hoping it was UE4 since I've worked with that a lot before.
---
Fuck that, put in the Brute. The noises from him was fucking terrifying and nearly had me crying.
---
No because they're all based on an original wallpaper of the trapper so I thought it'd be redundant to make one, I'd grab you the link but I'm too tired
---
Dude chill
---
September third for me I believe
---
This ain’t a problem if you have rancor teachable
---
Who ever made this perk idea had just survivor benefits perspective.
---
If you're a solo survivor then believe me, kindred WILL benefit you (and your whole team)
---
BBQ, Nurse's Calling, Mangled, Ruin or Pop Goes the Weisel
---
You didn't get saved because you were being camped by a Leatherface, whether or not they were a SFW group is not much of a factor here.
---
Think of it this way. 
---
Adrenaline has the same requirements to be met in order for it to activate. You get a 150% boost in speed to sprint for a maximum for 5 seconds. And you get an insta heal of one health state. You also can be helped with other status effects like being asleep against a Freddy. 
---
Hope gives you a maximum of a 7% boost of speed for 120 seconds, and no instant heal or additional help. 
---
You essentially are choosing between a huge burst of speed and an instant heal that could potentially save your life that lasts for a short period of time vs a 7% speed boost for 2 minutes. 
---
To further put it into perspective, No One Escapes Death provides a speed boost of up to 4% until the totem is cleansed. If you’re being chased, that 7% isn’t going to save you because of bloodlust and the fact that the killer is already faster to begin with. Adrenaline may not always save you, but has simply better potential to do so with added benefit of its secondary abilities. And adrenaline will always trump any exhaustion you already have as well. So really the only issue it has is that it can screw you out of using other exhaustion perks like Dead Hard. The purpose of it is to heal you if you need it, and gain you the ground covered/second chance to get away. It is possibly the best End Game perk for survivors. 
---
There’s a reason why people complain it’s “OP” (it’s really not) and say nothing about Hope. 
---
Don’t use Hope.
---
Ruin/BBQ/STBFL/Bboozle
---
I’m more of a billy and legion my self
---
The fuck is that?
---
He came by once and immediately left that's not camping lol
---
I knew because after he hit me he teleported right behind me! Sorry I’m just angry
---
&gt;Lately while playing did I’ve always been getting lobbies that are above 250 ping and it’s killing me especially when I load into the lobby it’s at 95 then in game I’m getting hit while I’m 15 ft away from the killer. It’s ruining the game even more for me!
---
&gt;Is this happening to anyone else?
---
Probably happening to more people that live in your region (whatever it is) and play at the same time of the day. On reddit you have players from all over the world so it is unlikely to find someone going through the same issue.
---
It says one use only
---
and this, does put a smile on my face
---
Yeah, that's what I said..?  Telling everyone to facecamp be toxic
---
If guys like that insist on their bullshit, don’t even entertain them, it only encourages their nonsense
---
Ruin, BBQ, Whispers, and either Iron Maiden or Nurse's Calling. You'll get way more utility out of Nurse's, but Iron Maiden + the Deerskin Gloves addon makes reloading damn near instant.
---
And this happens every game? If so it’s probably your internet.
---
Its good, counters NoEd.  Just a little boring to play in my opinion
---
Thank you I live in New York so there probably is a lot of people
---
You mean r/dbdgonewild
---
I mean, if you see that, you know that the near absolute minimum number of pallets spawned on the map, and it had to force more pallets in some areas.
---
I’ve tested the internet connection I’ve reset it and it’s still like that
---
The text on the meme isn’t what they actually say and even if it was it wouldn’t really be a spoiler anyways so your good
---
I need that perk on my nurse.
---
What a sweet tiny baby!
---
This is awesome man, mind if i use this for my phone background?
---
ok, I thought so, thanks
---
Would love to see these in a Halloween event. Quick question tho who tf is franklin
---
&gt;Well how do you know you’re on high ping if it says 90 in the lobby? You might be just getting screwed by hitboxes.
---
90ms is high enough to the point where you can see fair hits that looked like it wouldn't connect. Stop spreading the "*hitboxes are broken*" misinformation.
---
It could also be a lag spike from either end.
---
Iron Will, if they're running Stridor then RIP.
---
For him to say that it was an update over a year ago. And that it’s happened multiple times makes me disagree with him being mistaken part. 
---
And yeah see.  This is the spawning that I was aware of since day 1.  When I brought up day 1 stuff he seemed pretty angry at the fact I thought they wouldn’t have updated it...   like.  I’m sorry.  Has much else changed in that way of sense?
---
There’s still 7 gens on the map.  Still only 5 needed to be completed. And hatch spawns in after X amount done.  The only thing that’s changed. Is you don’t need to complete at least 2 for it to spawn anymore.
---
Np, tell me how it works out
---
Well I don’t know what to tell you. If it’s been happening for like 10+ games it has to be on your end, but I can’t really help you with that.
---
Oh ok
---
That’s what I figured.  Thanks for the help.
---
Yea I guess, I need to trust my teammates more but every time I as a rank 6 see a rank 16+ in my game it makes me want to be selfish with my perks.
---
Probably just saw him in the distance, maybe someone had Object of Obsession, if this wasn't the first hook that game then his previous camping would have taught them, there's a variety of things that could have given someone that knowledge.
---
You should delete this because you are just showing Reddit how potato you both are and belong to each other in that chat.  Yea there’s a X cap but there’s a thing called BP modifiers?? Offerings/perks....yea, glad you’re up to speed now OP
---
Same thing here. It'll show a decent green ping in the lobby and play more like 200+
---
That makes good sense, I can understand that.
---
Yeah thanks for trying though I’m honestly not sure because when I’m killer I’m host and the survivors are in green or 100-150
---
Ive seen a bunch of these posts lately, what did I miss here? Not seeing any new news post on the site or anything.
---
This is beautiful! Do you post elsewhere too?
---
He’s not bad, I actually find him very hard to go against and the only killer I don’t know how to counteract
---
It’s annoying me I’m a survivor main and I can’t bare to play survivor so I’m playing killer more
---
Pig gets a big nerf. So the only people that are going to play her is me and my fellow oinkers
---
Don't forget about her lack of vault animation
---
My main Got nerfed again?!! What did they do this time? Make it so that she cant see survivors when crouched?
---
I don’t save anyone if they are being camped, whether I am with friends or not.
---
I swear it's like they just crawl across the map without recovering a single percent
---
That is how it be sometimes.
---
Well players with over 3,000 hours in the game disagree and are able to counterplay, so it sounds like you've still got some stuff to learn.
---
Care to link? Not seeing anything about this.
---
I think a long, long, long, long, long time ago in the closed beta Hatch spawned closed with 0 gens completed. I'm talking about the "Trapper was the only killer, Sabo'd hooks stayed broken forever era". I think before Nea was even a survivor and we just had Claudette, Dwight, Meg, and Jake.
---
“Again... Seriously?”
---
The reverse trap wont activate on the gate anymore and another one but I forgot,essentially dwindling her endgame form
---
I have bloodhound and whatever on her so I can track in phase. I have played for years now and have every killer and survivor to 50 if not leveled and 50. I just suck at spirit. I stopped playing then reset happened and I had a Spirit challenge at *rank 16* and while i completed it I got 0k. Clown I'm bad with, spirit I'm awful with, any other killer I'm fine with
---
Also keep in mind, over the next few patches, there are a lot of stealth changes incoming.
---
NOED u actually have to hit a survivor
---
I will pay you to get 8k in the survival category
---
I love them!!!!
---
mematic made with
---
Same over here, I play with 370 ping killers and I have good internet, and I just see him teleporting around the map and getting hit out of nowhere and stuff
---
Yes i do need therapy my dad made me reload the gun while he did things to my mom when ever someone broke into our house but when my mom said daddy we both awnsered and he shot me total of 63 times
---
It ruins the game
---
Boxed me for the majority of the game.
---
We we're on the verge of S U C C, we where this close
---
i just enjoy the playstyle, i dont care if its super meta or not
---
The Game. Depending on whatever amount of random pallets the map wants to generate, it's either a dogshit map or an incredibly strong one for survivors.
---
There's also the very fun factor of not knowing if a room has a 100% safe pallet when you run into it, because you can't see it.
---
It's just unfun for everyone involved, with the chance of being really fun for survivors.
---
I think in the lobby the SWF players should be color coded that way the killer at least has a heads up on what they're about to get into. They can disconnect right there and then if they don't want to deal with it. 
---
And I still think that the killer should get an audio warning of some kind if he's in a certain radius and someone uses a microphone. He shouldn't be able to hear what they're saying but make it like a real world situation. You're not going to be talking if there's a killer somewhere near you because they might hear you.
---
imagine thinking hex names are funny
---
hAHAhaHA
---
Mouse and keyboard. Not sure if op plays on console or pc, though
---
That is definitely bannable but you probably need video
---
PC, he has a chat
---
Ah, thanks. Been thinking about using a mouse and keyboard for my playstation. But idk yet
---
That could be neat
---
Holy fuck if it came with a Ripley survivor, I'd use that shit all the time, regardless of perks.
---
Everybody gansta till the huntress uses a white ward.
---
Awe, I hope he does better. 
---
At that young stage they love Goat Milk man. I don’t know about regular milk. 
---
It took my pigs about a month or 2 to be able to actually start wanting to eat anything besides pellets. 
---
Try and get them used to you as well. Scratch their little heads and everything. 
---
They’ll go on the ground and lay on their side so you can rub their little belly and they love it. 
---
Pigs are you know filthy but they are also very cute and lovely.
---
I personally think Wraith is notably better than all of them, 0 terror radius alone is imo pretty massive. just cloak everytime you're not going to hit someone within 3 seconds
---
*in quiet voice* there will be more Freddy... soon
---
The potential for survivors to negate killers like that is an issue though.  The rarity isn't the issue,  it's preventing the existence.
---
God nurses aren't common, yet people want nerfs. 
---
God swf isn't common, yet it's completely game breaking and needs fixing
---
Original Vid Link - https://youtu.be/YusU3Rl5_6o xxx 🙌😊👻
---
Idk people think dh is one of the best exhaustion perks, as a killer main it only works on me once. Lithe is a lil more annoying since you get so much more distance
---
This is my strat, Killer games are when my friends aren’t on, survivor games are when my friends are on.
---
18 seconds???? Dude you cant talk about transitory times on normal healing and act like lockers and totems are gunna be buttfucking eachother... a solid 30ish seconds on a good situation to heal using the perk for 1 time... swf heal in 20 easily their always on point with altruism this is a shitty perk that is useless in game but people are a bit stupid when it comes to what's good and what's bad in this game...
---
People still try and argue how bad play with your food is but they dont realize 1 stack and your running faster than legions freal frenzy as a bubba or whatever... 3 stacks and your a spirit phasing 24/7... 
---
It's just new name jitters
---
exactly, it isn’t anything personal. survivors don’t realize they just happen to be the ones the killer sees at the moment. why go after a healthy player when you can just hook the original player again? also games are 4 v 1, so survivors automatically start with an advantage over killers. so focusing on the first teammate you happen to see to downsize the group is a legit strategy. 
---
it may suck when it happens to you, but that’s just the game. better luck next game! :)
---
That’s what I was going to say lmao
---
I love it.
---
Hex: The 69th Seal
---
Unbreakable has no counter.  Combined with Ds the killer has to leave the target. In theory it isn't an issue,  but it is simply because of how it is played around DS
---
Deliverance causes issues with game pressure but isn't too crazy overall.
---
Listen this hurts because I am an convert from F13 the game. I backed the damn thing in 2015 and it took ages to get out and then lasted like a year, occasionally  I still drunk cry over it
---
that's tragic
---
I’m cool with it as long as it ain’t me, we just rush the killer and use borrowed time lol
---
esc -&gt; leave game
---
Okay like fine I get they’re not siblings actually but there’s no reason to be an ass
---
&gt;Object of obsession 
---
&gt;Nobody is the obsession
---
Kind of how it always should have been, its not a basic attack, so it counting as one was strange.
---
yeah I have the exact same question, the only thing that comes to mind when I hear "franklin" in dbd is franklins demise so
---
I can walk this palette, nobody is nearb- FUCKING *PRETTY*
---
&gt; Isn't the point of mind games to make the opponent not sure what you're going to do next?
---
It's about weighted chance and what people would opt for.
---
1 round of rock paper scissors is basically coinflip. Uninteresting, everyone just chooses something. Maybe people play around the idea that rock is "easy" to throw out, but other than that mindgames come down to predicted patterns and behaviour. "This guy picked paper 4 times in a row. It's becoming more likely they'll mix it up- or is it?"
---
Now add the condition that if you win with rock, you get triple points, and if you win with paper you steal 1 point from the other guy. Now not only do you got somewhat consistent/ predictable set of circumstances over the course of many games, but you get a lot more information about what players will feel pressured to do in certain situations/ degrees of pressure on them.
---
With huntress against a healthy survivor, they'll probably only wind up the hatchet the *very* first time. If the survivor runs through and doesn't drop, the huntress will now try swinging through each time. However, when the survivor is injured, they get that instinct to drop it way more... And the huntress knows that. But they can use that against the huntress.
---
Plus, really bad or mediocre huntresses, and billy's, can have these "drop or not drop" mindgames used against them all game. Same with hiding red light and how much survivor chooses to stall at deciding on which side they go for. More to it, these mindgames also take into account resources, zoning, window opportunities, etc
---
With Spirit the coin flip is rigged 60/40 in her favour every time she phases. You don't have much opportunity to learn her habits because you can't fucking see how she's behaving during her phase. Most optimal plays are throwing the pallet early and flipping a coin for which side she'll try to hit you from. GOOD spirits don't give you the opportunity to even make 50/50 decisions- they'll use her collision and just easily listen to your ass to know exactly what you're trying to do.
---
She phases for *way* too long or *way* too frequently for how long it is. You basically get to do any array of dumb shit as spirit and it all rewards you. Just like a nurse missing her blink through a rock but still being able to lunge at you because she didn't move. Except every spirit phase is like that.
---
On a game that heavily becomes about observing behaviour (even of your teammates as solo queue) spirit kind of rips anything fun out of the game. You never feel like you're "outplayed" by a spirit, ever.
---
So true dude but people hate taking responsibility. If I'm pn the other side of the map and get the notification to come over, and I see you still in the immediate area walking away, sorry Dwight but you're the only one I see.  Let's get you out of here.
---
Got I hate indoor maps, moreso Just Lery's
---
I unlocked both of these, played one game, and all 4 survivors quit. Lol
---
What are you suggesting? That I'm not neutral to judge? pfff.
---
Aactually not bad they should buff dis where you get a speed burst when u hit it
---
Thank you
---
That's not how this memes works
---
There's a reason unbreakable isn't really meta, it's because it's situational. It's counter is picking them up, not slugging. If the survivor is using Ds and the 60 second timer is still up and they have unbreakable, they wasted their perk slots on 2 situational perks (unbreakable is more situational than ds for sure). They're both one time use perks, and the killer will be just fine having the survivor use one or the other, the killer is giving the survivor more power by just letting them get what they want, just waste it and move on, it really isnt that bad to take a stun or let them get up, and technically speaking you can still waste their ds by guarding them on the ground but you'd be playing poorly since that would waste a lot of time. 
---
It's easy to say "unbreakable has no counter" (I'm almost positive picking survivors up would be considered a counter) and point to that making it powerful, but that's ignoring what the perk does. I can say many survivor perks have no counter (prove thyself, open handed to name some) but they aren't exactly considered really good perks, are they? I just don't see it. Unbreakable is a good perk, but it's inconsistent and doesn't always get use.
---
I think even dbd mobile looks better than this
---
Context?
---
Thats smart of you ask me
---
It depends on the play style of the person.
---
 I.e., people fucking love Dead Hard but I always cunt myself into a barrel with it.
---
Id say BBQ for killer and Iron Will for survivor, for me.
---
facecamping wraith, tunnels me and let’s other 3 go, I told him the way he plays makes me want to “blow my brains out” and then I proceed to send him that image
---
On the flip side I love running Nurses around in areas with lots of walls and just confusing them by running in random directions lmao  
---
You can guess im not at a very high rank...
---
They make all of the money off of Spider-Man games. Comics. Merchandise. Including clothing action figures and accessories. They make all of the money from the other MCU movies and movies featuring Spider-Man like Avengers.
---
I genuinely blows my mind how someone like you can support a single Corporation owning everything. You're acting like Disney is the underdog. Disney is a horrible company and ruins everything it touches. MCU phase 4 looks like shit. Endgame was my final MCU movie.
---
You're genuinely supporting a monopoly. And people who do shit like that blow my mind. We have nothing more to discuss
---
He can mindgame a bit with no red stain but he moves at 105% making him easily loopable if you try getting into a chase against good survivors. It's why you rarely if ever see SM used on any other map that isn't Lery's or The Game.
---
Crutch perks absolutely exist
---
Turn your volume up. Healthy survivors are just as easy to track as injured ones.
---
Funny thing is, i don't even have the game.
---
Only played it once at some consoles at the mall for about 20 minutes.
---
By the way Spider-Man made billions of dollars before Disney. Look at the original trilogy and Amazing Spider-Man. They both made tons of money
---
As a rank 14 killer (was rank 12ish before rank reset  but I've been doing some BP grinds because I decided I wanted to start playing huntress and I got BBQ in my level 2 bloodweb) I can confirm that this will happen soon.
---
every baby survivor who thinks like you will get the easy totems at the beggining the spend even longer than self-care in corner time trying to find the second
---
Take a survivor's most valuable asset, let's say killer shack because not everyone plays swf who are altruistic : When that becomes obsolete against 1 killer (Nurse as well but I prefer her over spirit), I don't feel there's a need for a debate.
---
Bruh
---
eat cum.
---
So you messaged him first?
---
Not if you want to keep your 3 stacks of play with your food.
---
nope this game is still shit the dlc of a kiddie show didnt change that
---
Had the same thing happen to me today but with a 3 blink nurse. Tunneled and camped all game, then told me and the other survivors to "blame the game, not the people."
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I love this community.
---
Optimal solo queuers are not any different to well organized SWF
---
Unless the first survivors you find get lucky finding a busted setup at every corner of the map, you can usually always get survivors into an uncomfortable position as killer.
---
Because usually most of the toxic cunts play Nea, probably because of her bright/edgy cosmetics, Balanced on Haddonfield is also pretty annoying too.
---
what kind of nerf?
---
If this is a joke, then it's really not that funny. Just seems like two trolls trying to surpass each other.
---
SwF would still be more powerful than a set of solo survivors with the same system. It would be an improvement but it wouldn't solve the main problem.
---
So hold on. You can’t hatch grab anymore?
---
Usually, and this is a usually here, a really good spirit has pretty good knowledge of the game, and their headset. I'm no master in the matchups here, but usually the counterplay I see against spirits is iron will, and if you see her standing still, walk away, there's nothing for her to see if your not sprinting (unless she has her dads glasses obviously) if you have iron will, you take away the only method of tracking a phasing spirit has while your walking. Obviously don't get hit is a good strategy too, because the spirit can hear your cries of pain, but it isn't a viable one because if you escape a trial unscathed while looping a decent killer around your pretty good at the game, and not every survivor is good with loops, and many can't 360 (like me, but I'm a killer main so it doesn't bother me.) To escape harm.
---
If you won the game before any perks process, why should you feel bad?
---
The real issue is the "Taking one for the team" (or something similar) where you have to perform 250 unsafe unhooks on your teammates and also hope the killer doesn't decide to go for the unhookee and instead target you. It encourages and rewards what is basically ruining 250 games for other people.
---
Maybe then reveal the auras of everything a survivor has seen to all other survivors. Make the pings permanent. Maybe just straight up add voice coms to the base game.
---
Okay i feel like everyone ignores the perks you get for working with the entity, you get magic powers (increased strength, invisability, ect) dental and health care plans, and weekdays and holidays off. Pretty good deal.
---
Please dont link that lmao
---
so is this how you spend your time? being a dick to people on a dead by daylight Reddit post about a funny image? sad
---
I have played with Hex a few times. Not sure if that’s the same player but I’ve seen that name before.
---
If you had my friends there would still be room for dumbass shit to happen. 
---
jk
---
Map Pressure is a short way of saying she can influence most parts of the map with greater ease than the average killer. Her mobility thru walls and such essentially makes the entire map a flat, open field.
---
I can hear goofy voice with the stupidity of that player
---
Don't forget the map add-on that lets you set markers in the area.
---
This sounds mean spirited, but honestly just get better at playing killer
---
There are things experienced players can do to make you *feel* helpless, but understand that in a lot of scenarios you're not actually helpless. Watching incredibly good killers on twitch made me wonder how they make it look so easy to down these flashy SWF teams.
---
What in the cousin fricker is this abomination. Neat idea though
---
You cannot
---
Billy is terrible when getting looped. At high ranks, all survivors know how to loop. Nurse and Spirit are #1 and #2 and it's not even close, because of their ability to down survivors in all situations.
---
and it's not fun for a killer to run in circles around a pallet waiting for bloodlust, In fact I would say that in general losing is not fun, and yet we play a game were that happens, curious indeed...
---
That isn't what "Meta" means. Meta means that whatever is being called Meta is referring to itself. For instance, the meta-game is talking about the mechanics on the game, such as strategies for mind games.  
---
But! That said, that's a pretty fun acronym.
---
For the discussion, generally speaking, the reason to not run the best stuff at all times is for the fun factor. Yes, fun is subjective. We all know. Generally, communities will gravitate towards certain guidelines to help promote a general sense of fun. While someone going in with a +15 Holy Boomstick of Negation to roll the faces of everyone else might be fun to them, it can make for very unsatisfying games, so people may agree to, say, stick to plain +10 Boomsticks so that a single stray shot doesn't end the fight.  
---
I could think of several examples right off the top of my head in regards to this. But, I won't make this a huge comment when I'm just pointing out why a community would discourage certain things. I'll finish by saying that the DbD community as a whole is rather... Passionate... About its opinions on things.
---
Why did you think it was a good idea to stand in a boxed corner hiding?  Please answer did EGC get you or not?
---
Depends what your other three perks are. If you don't have an exhaustion perk, I'd encourage Balanced Landing.
---
Med kit or bond
---
I'm a survivor main and I think teammates who dc are fucking assholes and should be suspended for a little bit. While I don't agree with moris, I do think iridescent head as an ultra rare should be powerful. Umbra a hjntress main thinks it shoul d be reworked. My idea for it is to give aurvivors no speed boost after getting hit and can't vault windows or drop pallets for 3 seconds.
---
Not being a dick. Just telling the truth. The picture isn't funny. It's a tunneling killer calling you salty and you trying to troll them. Nothing funny. Just pathetic.
---
That's because killer perks are generally ass minus maybe 2-3.  Survivor perks objectively have more impact on the match.  
---
Also, this perk is going to be ridiculously strong.  Just cleanse a totem at the start of the game and you have a fast heal in a locker whenever you need it.
---
Nice Spirit pun. I do try to improve while playing killer, I understand mistakes I make. However, I am a survivor main and understand all the leeway survivors get vs killers. By design survivors automatically have advantages. 16 perks vs 4, 4 offerings v 1, 3rd person vs 1st...
---
I think it was a REALLY brave but risky play to rework legions power. But that rework really worked out. Giving legion the power to say the n-word is a fun power to play with and against and its pretty decently balenced.
---
"Fine, I'll play some survivor."
---
\*Gets "The Game" map\*

---
Non insta-saw no bamboozle billy is still super strong but actually really fun to play against as survivor
---
It's about learning the mindgames at different tiles
---
Is she really getting nerfed again?
---
Perfect way to describe your post.
---
~~Bond if you're solo. If not a second chance (Adrenaline, DS) or exhaustion perk (if you don't have one already).~~
---
What am I talking about take No Mither, duh
---
Weeb
---
Let me know what ideas you have for the perks
---
I used to be a Spirit main until they screwed up the sounds about 2-3 months ago. I never played against any good Spirits, so I have no experience on the survivor side of this discussion.
---
I played Spirit relying 100% on sound. I didn't really ever use scratchmarks, environmental signs, OR COLLISION. I keep seeing collision being removed brought up as a way to nerf her, but a good Spirit (as I once was) never really has to use it. I was so programmed to the sound of breathing and running that I never needed anything else.
---
Fast forward after they completely destroyed the sounds, I cannot play her. At all. Everyone sounds too close and sometimes they're not even in the right direction that the sound says they should be. It's ruined me and my ability to play Spirit. I used to miss a grudge 3 times a game MAX. Now I'm lucky if I HIT 3 a game. I've never had to focus so much on scratchmarks, grass, or collision until this point, and if this is how all the other Spirit's play then they are not using her as effectively as they could be. 
---
Anyway the point is that she relies heavily on things other killers can get away with not focusing on. She is not "easy" to play if you need a completely different approach to play her. I think she's fine as is. If people really want collision gone then they can have it, it's not necessary. There is no need to nerf her and send the only viable killer SINCE NURSE down the gutter with the rest of the killers people wonder why they never see. People are forgetting it took multiple buffs after her PTB to mold her into a viable killer. The devs just have a really hard time releasing a strong killer right off the bat.
---
I don't have dlcs
---
Sometimes it isn't about mindgames though. Sometimes it's just run a jungle gym vs a Wraith and it becomes almost impossible to down anyone. It's made worse when the survivor butt dances at exit gate and calls you the n word at the end of the match. Happened to me yesterday.
---
Id be all for it if he could bring something new to the table. But there's really nothing they could do for a power for him
---
The killer was right. You really are salty.

I can verify this. I walked past my ruin didn't even see there was a claudette on it and boom it's gone and I turn around the claudette is running  away
---
Doesn't even make sense. How would four good solo queuers not be better when you give them all comms? The time you save gen planning and coordinating hook saves alone is ridiculous.
---
60ft, according to the hitboxes.
---
He will add you to his collection
---
give him a more bloodlust power but a passive if your in a locker he breaks it for rest of the game when he pulls you out
---
I love this game I just really can’t handle the toxicity, you get a facecamper who’s trash one game and the next game a pallet doesn’t drop when it feels like it should’ve dropped ages ago and that’s my time spent for the week.
---
Then why are you here lmao
---
No my dude it he they’re fault
---
I guess I meant dumbass shit outside of having fun with your friends that you can’t really control. I have definitely let one of my friends die on first hook because the previous game they purposefully dropped a pallet on me when we were playing versus an ebony mori huntress.
---
I agree that's why they need to make more pallet loops like badham preschool. Still think playing the game is more fun than just standing there so you think you got a kill. I'm not saying that the game is balanced by any means because it's not but when you play 10+ games and every killer just camps and tunnels it gets old
---
Lol I came here to check for that one person who would get turned on by the meme
---
Survivor: best is adrenaline and worst is left behind
---
Killer: Best is BBQ and worst is Unrelenting
---
&gt; If the killer isn't running a handicap then they get completely dominated
---
Not exactly true, on most map generations you can do plenty even as an M1 with good fundamentals
---
I personally think premonition/spine chill is a bit overrated. I like sprint burst or borrowed time. Probably bbq and chilli for killers.
---
I’ve just joined this game this week and I’m a feng main this game is sooooo fun and hilarious I love running in and saving my team mates except honestly I’m shocking with the flash light idk how it works I was flashing it in the killers eyes who was the guy of scream and it didn’t do anything so I screamed and ran for my life
---
Sorry to say that but jane in this vid looks like a street hooker...
---
yeah, it he they're fault that man door hand hook car door
---
I'm laugh-crying on the bus rn 😂 it's too early for this shit, but thank you, I hate it.

Perks I usually run are BBQ, Ruin, then some combination of Sloppy Butcher, M&amp;A, Nurses or NOED. 
---
I prioritize add-ons that speed up the power recharge rate and increase stalking when not leaning.
---
Don't overuse his power for stalking, but use the power often. Myers suffers from the same issue where you can spend too much time trying to stalk and get them exposed, and it is unnecessary or hurts your gameplay. 
---
I use the power as soon as it's ready, primarily for dropping my stain and terror radius. If I've lost a survivor in a chase, or I know they're around an almost completed gen, that's a perfect time to pop your power even though it may not seem like it. They'll start breaking you out of stealth, and the indicator on screen will tell you which direction they're hiding. 
---
The power is also incredible in a chase, especially at a jungle gym. I often end chases by activating my power mid chase. I'll wait until the survivor turns the corner, pop my power, and they'll often assume I went the opposite direction. So they'll change directions and sprint right into me.
---
Prioritize tracking/slowing perks, don't overuse the stalk, and use the power for more than just stalking. You'll see a lot of improvement very quickly
---
This is any South African trying to play the game, trying to debate whether the 300 odd ping match is worth it or not.
---
If you play solo alot and you’re at lower ranks where teammates don’t really help eachother, probably should leave it on. If not, run medkits and something like decisive strike. Posting the other 3 perks you run would help us give you better suggestions
---
The only thing I listed that's DLC is DS. But it really depends on what your build is already. The only strait forward replacement is Bond, and that's only if you're playing solo. If you're not playing solo, you're better off just putting something else in there that makes sense and works with whatever build your team is going for.
---
I lau ghed
---
See you at the top
---
It's strong when it works but you'll still have times where people are too immersed with their task. You also sometimes get situations where a killer is obviously camping you and instead of doing gens a teammate or two come over and wait for a chance to unhook you that never comes.
---
Cause for the most part there are obvious tells who should be doing what. It's why the first hook is always the most decisive (how soon it happens, where on the map) and the most stressful for solo queue. Even to the point of it actually boosting survival rates if the guy on hook DC's. (3v1 but with ~2 to 3 gens left)
---
But later into the game there's not much confusion about who should hook save and when
---
don't worry my friend, I have 500+ hours on this game and I'm STILL rank 20 baby killer 😅
---
New superhero idea?
---
OMG ya i love this idea.
---
Clown is fine, I think. I never have a problem playing him
---
https://youtu.be/AnbQNBwwYCw
---
annnnd you sound exactly like the sad weeb i had imagined lmao
---
LMFAO!! Starved for good perks?! That's a good one!
---
God their are so many better examples most of Fortnite’s “Collabs ” are just not copyrightable references to characters.
---
I have a friend that lives taylor swift but doesn’t really like horror, I’m going to ruin her day.
---
Worst perk for killer, i think monstous shrine.
---
Best i would say hex ruien, induring or bbq.
---
I would say yea this is perfectly acceptable except for playing solo. If there is no way for you to guarantee all 5 are done then you're going to spend all game looking for totems. If they added some sort of notification even a sound to the survivors as a way to count then I'd say yes keep NOED exactly how it is. If I go and get 4 totems, escape chases, and do a gen. If someone didnt find the 5th noed is still showing up. It's not like they're ar static locations. So it turns into it's at the best hidden totem now.
---
The only thing I can find is on the DBD forum frontpage about the Undetectable status effect. I don't see how it nerfs Pig though.
---
BITCH👏IMA👏MAIN👏NANCY👏 WHEELER 👏

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umvgwXINJBE
---
Thank me later
---
I try to cleanse 3 in solo so 2 survivors can cleanse 1 each, leaving room for the 4th survivor incase he's dumb. It won't stop it every time, but in most cases I do this it works.
---
If you didn't know you were tunneling, you weren't tunneling. Tunneling comes from the phrase "tunnel vision," meaning you deliberately and actively ignored everything else to completely focus on them, at least to some extent. It can't not be a deliberate action, so you weren't doing it. Case closed. Enjoy your night.
---
Yea... Let's take a moment to recall all the top tier survivor perks in the last year or so... Oh right.
---
While killers have gotten Spirit fury, bamboozle, distortion, infectious fright, corrupt intervention ect
---
They were excited to use the build but killed everyone instead. Hence, suffering from success.
---
I thought no mother was did but it's free oops
---
It's supposed to be that way. Wouldn't be surprised if it bugs out a lot though.
---
Honestly I’m glad I get revealed at times. I just use it as a sorta makeshift ping for finding people easier
---
Depends on your rank.
---
Yes for the loading screen idk about 30 seconds into the match, maybe the first 1 or half second.
---
Oh, by the way, if you're a newer player, the No Mither suggestion was a joke lol
---
&gt;Case 
---
Thx gn
---
Also what would happen is u ran bbq and this perk. U r gonna see everyone within 40 meters?!
---
What's wrong with noed I even feel bad if I bully the killer and they dont have noed
---
What platform do you play on? I always recommend lithe and alert from Feng if you are on console. Lithe is my favorite exhaustion perk, almost impossible to accidently trigger and useful on almost every map. Alert is awsome for knowing the killers location and early on IDing the killer. Also if you have attention to detail you can easily tell if an area is having its pallets burnt through. 
---
If you are on PC then I would recommend small game, bond, empathy, or Iron Will. Small is good for finding totems and Hex, also underrated counter to hag and trapper. First time it saves you from a trapped window it will make you appreciate the perk even more. Bond and empathy are good for finding other survivors and easily replace self care and help you get healed. Iron will is amazing to help you break chase while injured. The sound reduction is insane and it hinders the screams from other abilities as well. 
---
Also I recommend Distortion since it is on the shrine this week. Great perk and helps you know if the killer has any aura perks. Has saved my butt in a ton of games and the only reason I escaped because I knew what they had.
---
I heard no mither sucked was still gonna try it lol
---
Well, im also a killer main, and my main killer is myers.
---
Tbh, im bad with ghostface, but i just whant to say im happy to hear we have a new killer to the groep!
---
Welcome, and just make fun of there salt 👍🏻
---
Pig has that too, though. And if you're experienced enough, Wraith is a LOT easier to see than you think. Main difference is if you see wraith coming, he has to wait longer to hit you than pig.
---
Not only that, but as an OoO user, there’s *no way* it would have seen that far across the map. It’s have gone about halfway at *best*.
---
Biggest 1 stop shop improvement would be to make it so that the survivor indicator in the bottom left of the screen would show them running if in a chase.
---
SWF would have that exact info anyway, but solo just have to guess if he is chasing elsewhere or not until at the very least a hit lands.
---
Is this made with MMD?
---
Eh. I used to think survivor was strong back during the Clown update. But then I started watching DBD killer streamers making quick work of what I'd think are scary survivors, I started actually considering that I could just get better. Not only that, but back to back to back killer buffs/ survivor nerfs that made killer a lot easier to stack pressure with (less pallets, faster animations for basically everything, vaults needing more run up) killer actually started to feel too easy.
---
Right around Spirit update, when killer queues were abysmal, I swapped to playing a ton more survivor. It got to the point where the challenge of surviving solo queue became more interesting than figuring out how the fuck to 4k scary survivors. (Which by this point wasn't a thing for me)
---
I honestly think an M1 killer, on a fair map, playing perfectly can 8-10 hook and kill 2 survivors out of a team of 4 playing near perfect. Survivors just don't have as much to work with lately.
---
I like playing Legion and using their power since I didn’t  get them until after the nerf. 
---
You stab one person and instantly yeet to a heartbeat or in a random direction until you find one; once everyone is injured, you play a regular m1 killer until something changes. As a bonus, every now and then you get a survivor who doesn’t mend self or thinks the locker will save them and it’s easy pickings.
---
Dbd is on mobile. If you signed up fir it
---
Yup I used to trap all 4 survivors in the basement back before they increased the width of the stairs 
---
They quit 1by1 until I got 4 kills ez game
---
I feel so attacked rn XD true tho
---
I would also like to know
---
&gt; Sometimes it's just run a jungle gym vs a Wraith and it becomes almost impossible to down anyone
---
Run tiles better. Each basic tile has an effective way of squashing it out. Long wall jungle gyms are rough for everyone, but they're one of the few tools in a survivor's arsenal. Once that pallet is dropped during that match, its effectiveness gets cut down to 10%.
---
Thank you, I know, I am a solo player, and I am used to the typical toxic messages, but I think these messages are more than toxic.
---
Nea and the Entity
---
You three all sound salty lmao
---
Oh yeah looking forward to that when the ST chapter drops.
---
Would love to know , can’t wait to run around as clown with pink elephants on parade lmao
---
Big pro-gamer move for Billy that may not be immediately obvious: you should use fake outs with your chainsaw to zone people. Unless they call your bluff, you can rev for a sec right as they get to a pallet to maybe get them to avoid dropping it (for fear of wasting it), rev as they pass by an unsafe loop to make them "dodge" into it, etc. That's my two cents for Billy, I haven't ever mained Hag so can't help you much there.
---
Why do y'all act like we're the same person
---
This is an excellent suggestion. It fits with the theme of the perk, and it certainly doesn't make it any more meta so it's not like balance is an issue. Someone get BHVR on the horn!
---
If you want killer advice I highly recommend watching killer mains like otz, hybrid panda, etc.  You can gain a LOT from watching gameplay, and if you wanna take it to an even higher level watch like Billy esports competition gameplay.  I'd say mind games are essential for good billys and just watching gameplay with mind games can teach you a lot.  And don't be afraid to try mind games for a few games, you don't have to win every game, use some games to try new things.  Once you've watched killer gameplay go watch some survivor gameplay and commentary as well.  Being able to predict survivors movements is the entire aspect of mind games.  Being a good survivor can make you a good killer, and vise versa. Good luck : D

Wait but aren’t they making his new movie tho?
---
You're completely forgetting about Bubba and ffs I'm done with the insta down argument. I'm a surv main, literally find a window while your 3 others do gens, his saw is the worst.
---
I'm actually pissed the devs considered built in kindred but later decided against it. I get the killer aura reveal shouldn't be built-in, but the survivor aura reveal is super helpful because of the bystander effect.
---
Except dbd players feel no guilt or remorse and will gladly pretend to not notice you dying on the hook
---
\*Mayer
---
Uhh what
---
I mean you're not wrong. Kindred is practically mandatory at low ranks because no one at low ranks actually bothers to go for unhooks.
---
High ranks too tbh.
---
Yeah, you deserved it lmao
---
THAT FUCKING BAMBOO
---
*Don't do that. Don't give me hope.*
---
Or something else
---
Lol no
---
another one, bites the dust *snap
---
Now all survivors will know everything of the trials, but you
---
I guess a new player could see her weird movement as hacking. Weird
---
*Perfectly balanced; as all things should be.*
---
Also *half*? You're half right about that.
---
Why did I find this so funny 😂
---
Bubba is a weak killer overall I think people camp as him because that's tje only thing he's good at he sucks at everything else.
---
He can't move around quickly
---
No way to sneak up on survivors
---
No map pressure or control
---
Nothing to help track survivors
---
He's trul one if tbe worst killers
---
This, I feel this.  I play both roles equally and can understand frustration for survivors as well as killers.  I agree that if people played both sides I'd help.
---
&gt;How often is somebody not already coming for you when you can safely use deliverance?
---
I consider myself a decent looper so I immediately unhook myself before my teammates drop whatever they are doing. The killer comes back for me, I resume looping and killers often lose whatever gen there was left in the match.
---
I think this community really needs to stop blaming each player side and realize it's mostly just the shortcomings of each role's design (not saying it can't be fixed).
---
I’ll take anything at this point, Ash’s teachables are so mediocre at the moment

Because it's a game, I always want the people I play against to have just as much fun as I do.  Also it's sorta funny that I get called a tunneler for fair gameay lmao.
---
Pig isn’t that bad actually, she’s good for slowing the game down. I don’t use ruin for her actually and still 4K with 2, 3, or 4 gens left to finish. You really just need to know how to end chases quickly.
---
P3 claudetes should also be there
---
Just safe unhooks would promote hook diving with BT. Safe unhooks in addition to Protection Hits made it far too easy to get all stacks, we could see it during PTB.
---
MoM needs to be reworked, given another effect other than permanent Endurance until hit and getting stacks should be easy or maybe even drop the stack mechanics.
---
The problem with MoM is the effect given. They made it insanely hard to get all stacks to "balance it", which ended up killing the perk altogether.
---
The last time that happened to me, the item was removed from the offering slot and returned. I thought I had lost it. But it was there.
---
Played with hex before, the actual one on steam lol
---
Excuse me fellow human, whats tunneling?
---
[Monstrous Shrine] worst, [BBQ &amp; Chili] best
---
[No Mither] worst, best depends on situation and preference.
---
Good survivor perks include exhaustion perks (except [Head On]), [Borrowed Time], [Bond], [Prove Thyself] and [Botany Knowledge]. The best two survivors to level up first are probably Claudette and Dwight; however, rushing David for [We're Gonna Live Forever] can drastically reduce your grind, but leaves you wanting for good perks.
---
Again, I always think there's something you can work towards as killer every match.
---
Sometimes you get haddonfield, or ormond, and if you're an M1 killer you're fucked. Or you get coldwind with 2 long wall jungle gyms, pig tree, shack and cowshed window all next to each other with 4 survivors who all know to a degree some basics of looping all with dead hard to make up for small mistakes/ extra distance.
---
Shit is rough, but on most maps you can swap aggro- most often I smack the first survivor asap and figure out which gen is super far from others, avoid it and go to gens where other survivors might be and stop at least 1 gen from continuously being worked on. All the while maybe knocking out a few pallets in the center of the map, giving survivors less and less to work with as the match goes on.
---
Not only that but when you *need* survivors to be downed you can zone them into deadzones, or just play the tilesets clean. Call out bluffs, hide red light, have spirit fury proc'd- there's a lot of tactics and strategy. Small and large picture stuff when you play killer. Survivor is about bargaining on using resources and hoping your teammates didn't waste the ones you were depending on.
---
If a survivor is hitting you with every pallet on the map and you have no one on hook yet, you're doing it wrong.
---
Increasing gen time isn't the solution. Survivors don't want to M1 on gens- it's becoming increasingly boring to play when the one fun aspect of playing survivor (chases and plays) is made nul by boring shit like spirit or tunnellers + noed. Most killers just don't play killer optimally, so they don't quite get why gens pop *so* fast for them.
---
Plus, ruin doesn't really get you much mileage against good players. They'll hit skill checks/ work through it and deal with the 10 or so seconds it adds to their gen completion time.

#A BIT UNDERPOWERED ^just ^a ^little ^bit
---
Damn you missed the opportunity for the ghost face pop to be in it too
---
That's the problem she doesn't have much Chase potential and her stealth isnt very good since she has to deal with a first person view which limits vision making stealth very hard to pull off and survivors having third person view doesn't help.
---
MoM should gain stacks from killer stuns while the killer is carrying someone, in keeping with the theme of the perk which seems to be to reward the survivor for fearlessly facing the killer head on to protect their teammates.
---
I know killers have PTSD from this perk so I'm probably going to get some shit for suggesting a small buff, but I literally am a 90% time-played killer main myself and I think this buff would be relatively harmless while making the perk a little less shit. It's extremely situational, and I don't think it would make it meta again by a long shot.
---
Was it a basement bubba?
---
Ah, the Liam Neeson Myers build
---
Ngl I have like 1000 hours and I'm still horrified of both playing and going against her lol.  I can't play her for the life of me even tho I have good headphones and her phasing always beans me.
---
Pig slows down while crouched, Wraith speeds up
---
That’s too bad he’s hilarious to watch waddle around faster than fit 20s-30s age range adults can run when being pursued by a murderer.
---
Yeah I'd have to agree, it doesn't make it to OP but also showcases another area of hiding and such which is what the perk is intended for after all showing windows pallets and hopefully lockers.
---
You mean like kick things? Pig can remain crouched and kick gens or pallets too.
---
I just think pig has a lot more going for her than Wraith personally. Her crouch attack can be used to mind game certain loops, but Wraiths power doesn't have any mind game potential to it. I also think pigs traps are just a built in way to slow the game down, even though they never pop.
---
Idk, I feel like wraith is only good for that first hit. After that the survivors are gonna be a lot more aware and look out for him. I do share and respect your opinion though, as Pig still isn't in a good spot either. I just personally think Wraith is the worst in the game.
---
Doesn’t bond do the same thing? Which one is more useful?
---
The community the way it is I thought this was serious until I saw /r/dadbydaylight lol
---
They could add an opt-in voice chat. I know they said they think it breaks immersion and I know it would be toxic, but thats why its opt in.

---
Perkless and powerless m1 killer stomping? You're either talking about lvl 20s or you're trolling at this point. There is no possible a way even a decent killer with those condition can reliably win against decent survivors.
---
Hag is one of my mains. Now I'm not meta, and I dont always win, but I do normally have fun and at least get 1 to 2 kills minimum. However, here is what I run. 
---
- Ruin: Hag Teachable 
---
- Third Seal: Hag Teachable 
---
- Brutal Strength: Non-Teachable 
---
- Survelliance: Pig Teachable

Now since you dont have survelliance, I'd use any tracking perks you have. I believe BBQ is in the shrine.

---
Better to elevate non SFW to SFW if your trying to close the gap.
---
Freddy was F tier when you tried to play him like a M1 killer.
---
if you played him right, he was high mid tier
---
You can kill with friends and practice that way.
---
It's a Love-Hate relationship with me.
---
Why is it that bubbas camp the most? Been wondering this.
---
I have 5000+ hours, actually. I've been around. I'm starting to doubt how much you play the game since what you're chatting is utter shit from my experiences. I have not had the gates powered on me by a non-SWF in at least six seasons. No matter the quality of player. 
---
As survivor my four stack 4E's roughly 90% of our matches, probably a bit more.
---
Omg not Homer Simpson Hahahah. He is terrifying. Him and when you aren’t sure who the killer is and run over a hag trap for the first time. That’s about the only jump scares that get me in the game.
---
hmm, if she doesn't have to recrouch that is a plus for her. I guess in my mind the added speed boost is just really huge; he may be pretty easy to see but it does really help him in chases having the speed boost - the only disadvantage is of course if someone turns a corner on him or something. he's of course not spirit-tier but IMO he's very mid tier, I'd say for sure better than trapper, legion &amp; clown, while depending on trap-luck he can be either a lot better or a bit worse than pig
---
Oh no should i literally call an ambulance?

#PERK FENG
---
You seem like a killer main that would tunnel the obsession, down them, pick them up, get decisive striked, chase them some more even though you can’t catch them but you insist on chasing that one person, down them again, hook them, camp till struggle ends, get that 1k, and complain about how unbalanced the game is even though dead hard is super counterable, maybe not tunnel someone off hook and give chase to others, don’t forget mind games are a thing, oh and Survivors t-bagging is definitely more toxic than killers camping or tunneling. It affects your gameplay heavily.
---
Just press mute.
---
If safe unhooks took longer to register as a safe unhook that's fine, but I'd really rather not be eating through 4 mettle of man hits again lmao.  That perk actually scares me.  PTSD of end gates being opened and everyone taking mettle of man hits despite all injured XD, that's nightmare inducing (I'm sorta glad I never used it as a survivor).  I will say though, one person using it in a game won't be too bad.
---
This is true
---
Well not everyone has friends like me :( and even if I get people they usually don’t want to sit around and help me practice legion or something t
---
Problem is both of those are effectively useless against survivors who do totems. Survivors get to use their OP stuff no matter what. As long as they dont become deadified.
---
it’s too bad, because once Jason does come out it’s pretty clear he’s gonna be bad. I don’t know why yet, but he will be.
---
im not sure why but i actually went and checked out the game\^\^ and honestly you were pretty much as far away from tunneling as it was possible in that situation. he had ds which he didnt even get to use (you didnt even have to slug or cheese in any way to outplay it). for gods sake, they were stacking on top of each other for 90% of the game against a legion, go figure.
---
but what i really want to say it: ignore those types of survivors. there are always gonna be those entitled individuals and if you keep caring about that, you're just gonna make yourself unhappy
---
same, the game is still pretty bad but the competitors are fucking trash holy fk.
---
Lucky, the first time you see him tho, you'll wonder how he's so fast with such a big stomach
---
Jason be like "eat a dick, I have a game all about me"
---
Yes “reportable” but not “banable”
---
Fair point. When I started playing we did that on PlayStation and too turns and It helped to familiar me with the game. After that it’s just trial and error. I thought I was good, but I was trash back then.
---
I was thinking maybe running bloodhound, but I also realized I need to be able to find them so I will also put on whispers. I don’t put on 2 hex totems unles it’s thrill cause once they see ruin they will be looking and they might accidentally destroy non ruin. I was thinking that I might run Ruin, Haunted Grounds, Whispers, and Bloodhound. Idk about any other builds but I want to play pig next cause I want surveillance and make your choice.
---
Aoe instant down is my guess.
---
Well said lol.
---
&gt; As survivor my four stack 4E's roughly 90% of our matches, probably a bit more.
---
Because shocker, most killers are shit this day and age and lack the fundamentals of dealing with pressure. Enough so to think NOED is a talking point/ has any strength
---
Np : D
---
This is what makes me afraid to sleep at night
---
tl;dr Legion had two strategies that made them literally inescapable:
---
* Legion could break the chase with a Survivor in order to make the Deep Wounds timer tick down while still being in a chase, as Deep Wounds were originally based on being in a chase as opposed to being in the Killer's Terror Radius. This exploit was commonly referred to as the "moonwalk exploit" since most Legion players would just walk backwards to break the chase and follow your blood stains with perks like Bloodhound. Playing against a moonwalking Legion was a lose/lose situation cause you'd either run away from them and die due to Deep Wounds or start Mending and die due to them catching up to you and stabbing you. This problem was also further increased by the "Stab Wound Study" addon which made this process far faster.
---
* Legion could also stab you when you had Deep Wounds applied to take 33% of the timer off, meaning that they could stab you 4 times with their power in order to down you. (First stab to apply the debuff and then 3 stabs to down you.) Stabbing someone affected by Deep Wounds would still end your power early but you could activate the power before it was fully replenished before, meaning you could just continuously activate it whenever it came off cool-down to stab someone to death. Considering the fact that Legion could still vault pallets and windows (far faster than they currently can at that) this strategy came to be known as "Nurse for stupid people" since you could completely ignore pallets and windows like Nurse but would kill Survivors way slower due to the time it would take to down someone, but would require absolutely zero mechanical skill to do so. This problem was also increased by the "Frank's Mix Tape" addon which reduced the amount of stabs required to down someone with FF to three. (First stab to apply debuff and then 3 stabs to down.)
---
Basically regardless of what strategy the Legion player used it was literally uncounterable, and your only option in a chase would be to either pray that the Legion was the biggest potato on the farm and actually manage to pallet stun them out of their power, or just accept your fate and try to stall as long as possible while your teammates gen rushed. And saying "Legion was countered by gen rushing" is like saying "gen rushing is countered by killing the Survivors." It's blatantly obvious and it's far easier said than done.
---
And the biggest problem is that Legion essentially couldn't be played without abusing these cheap tactics because they moved at 110% (Hag / Huntress / Spirit) movement speed on release, meaning that they were essentially a Hag / Huntress / Spirit that could get the first hit on you very easily but couldn't reliably get a second hit to down you. This is why Legion, despite being considered very weak, was also viewed as being uncounterable and was one of the most hated Killers in the game. Most Survivors would just disconnect instantly against a Legion as opposed to playing, since they knew the game would be an exercise in redundancy and a pure war of attrition.
---
New Legion is bad but honestly at least they function. Old Legion was basically a free win button. A "free win after stalling for 2 hours" button.
---
Press X to doubt.
---
If a Demogorgon can get in, why not a Tyranid? or a Harlequin?
---
If you catch your first survivor in a setup that takes &lt;40 seconds to down with 1 or 2 pallets down you're in a good spot
---
Not impossible
---
Depends on how long they had you there. Like if they did that then immediately hit you, then no. But if they kept you there for an obnoxious amount of time, yes. But you need a video
---
Is this true?
---
I don't know whether to love it or hate it
---
&gt;Please dont link that lmao
---
What was that? I can't hear you over us linking r/dbdgonewild
---
Do you have any idea how many times I’ve stubbed my toe on that thing as billy?
---
Honestly I loved the old remember me, I loved the shock survivors got from seeing an extra 30 seconds before their escape, and it really helped to patrol doors and prevent people from bolting from the match.  When I used to play it I sorta figured the 5 stacks was to give them one more shot or something I didnt know they removed that.  The remember me nerf hit me hard tho, went from a pretty solid perk to a bad one.  Survivors still have 3 minutes to leave, it only really helps billies and nurses now.
---
No it shouldn't. MoM has an effect far too powerful to be so easily obtainable.
---
The new PGTW buff is insane man.
---
*After hooking a survivor, you are filled with determination. You gain the ability to regress any completed or uncompleted gen for the next 60 seconds. Instead of giving the next gen a light tap with your foot, you absolutely blast that shit strait into oblivion, resetting gen progress to 0% and preventing it from being repaired again without a BNP.*
---
*"Stop fucking fixing the gens and leaving! STOP IT!!" - Unknown (probably Trapper, poor guy)*
---
Nice very nice here, 
---
Holds upvote..
---
Quieres?
---
OP, I just watched to the point where you down'd the streamer twice. I heard him say, and I quote, "why are you doing this shit? won't let me go" - He expects you to let him walk away instead of trying to secure the win. Pay no attention to him
---
Id like The Witch.  I know it's not IV original, but Junji Ito is neat, and she'd have a high skill cap
---
If the plan is to condition the killer by showing them you are running BT then instead of 250 unsafe unhooks you're now looking at 500. You really need to be at high ranks where every single killer just assumes you're running BT/DS and won't tunnel, but you're going to be making rank 20 plays until you get that achievement. Enjoy the well-deserved hate messages and depips, I suppose.
---
Clown is my highest leveled killer, but I play on Xbox, so you wouldn't see me. I hardly ever see them when I play survivor. It's true, his kit is VERY lacking, but I love everything about him, so I stick with it. Pop Goes the Weasel works great in any build and is on most of my killers.
---
I know. I didn't intend it as a "it can never be used that way" sort of thing. Like I said, it's clever. That's just not what the word means. That's all.
---
I think for the base game they should at least make it so survivor auras are visible if they're within, say, 32m or 24m of the hook, so you can at least tell if someone's going for it or not.  regular kindred would probably be a little too strong, especially since it shows killer's aura, to not be a perk.
---
maybe exposed for 30.45.60 seconds
---
When you’re in their terror radius.. at any point?
---
I love Clown, but I barely play him these days. Freddy does basically the same thing but 10x better. Like bottles have some advantages over snares, but the zero cooldown, zero reload,and having some form of map control with teleporting is so much better.
---
Watch Space Coconut on YT. He is a really good Hag main.
---
It is
---
Old DS is overpowered, new DS is completely fine. Red rank survivor and purple rank killer. If you’re not tunneling, DS shouldn’t be effecting you that much every game, even if they all have it. If the kid gets off the hook and you immediately chase and down him, then thats what DS is meant for. If a kid gets unhooked before you hook the other survivor, 90% of matches by the time you find and down the first kid, his DS no doubt will be more than halfway done. Just down and leave them on the ground. Kick a generator, break a pallet, search the area for lurking teammates. Half the time a teammate is guna try recovering them and you can bait into a free hit/down. In what situations is DS op and HONESTLY how often does it actually happen?
---
Spirit is so cute!!
---
I love you and hate you. But mostly love
---
I've got no horse in the race about if it's appropriate or not. That's something you can talk out with other people. What I said is why people wouldn't run the most powerful stuff, and why they would be encouraged to not bring it.  
---
Anything further on what you said will bring us to discussing the community and its issues, and I implied at the end of my comment that such a discussion may not be a great idea.
---
Oh, thanks?
---
It's a meme bro, chill.
---
Everytime I play as killer I get gen rushers and toxic Noob3 wannabe who always tries to pallet loops and 360s.
---
Everytime I play survivor I get NOED and baby Dwights.
---
Underused for Killer would probably be Spies from the Shadows. I really like it, but I never see other killers use it.
---
I do t know scream queens but those first two perls are interesting and I'd love to play with them
---
inb4 final unlocks in the Battle Pass. Sorry, "Rift" or whatever.

Lol this is awesome, great use of pop figures !

Michael is done with all these genrushers he is just gonna break all gens.

Go for it!
---
Yea I saw that, I figured that's what he meant by tunneling (if anything) but I just sorta laughed and thought the same thing.  He said "of course he goes for me" or something like that when I first downed him too lol.  Tunnelling is not ignoring him lmao.
---
Dying Light is more of a Mori perk for me. 
---
Remember Me does encourage you to kill the obsession so he can't get the door, but at least Old Remember Me's numbers meant if you hard-tunneled off the hook each time, you were not getting maximum potential. New Remember Me maxes out at 4 hits meaning you should go out of your way to tunnel so you can max your stacks and kill the obsession, getting two birds with one stone.
---
You forgot the “and everyone wants to see my nudes part”
---
No, it's his chainsaw ability. It can it multiple people, and he can just sit and rev it indefinitely. And by using insidious, borrowed time won't trigger.
---
Rider Kick!
---
Only while on the hook.
---
I 4K with wraith every. Single. Game. He’s actually OP imo. I can’t play against him either unless I’m using spine chill.
---
I prefer a voluminous bun made of waxed hair for a classy rampage.
---
I am saying you always see him because everyone who wants to play killer needs to lvl him to get the Barbecue teachable that's why he is such a common sight no one actually thinks he is good
---
For me it's more like
---
"Alright, I'm going to loop for more than 10 seconds this ti-" *whack*
---
Why is that community dead? 😭
---
I still think Henrietta would have been the best choice for killer.
---
General Deadite possession abilities, shapeshifting, a huge neck and a few different cosmetic options and differences with some potential for some crazy powers. Super iconic too
---
Lmaooo yep xxx 🙌😂😂
---
&gt; I keep seeing collision being removed brought up as a way to nerf her, but a good Spirit (as I once was) never really has to use it. I was so programmed to the sound of breathing and running that I never needed anything else.
---
Right? The people who bitch about the collision are such a laugh. It's the *sounds* that fuck you as a survivor, not the contact. If you're getting picked up even with Iron Will, you were fucked long before the bitch even touched you.
---
Not trying to be racist or nationalist but it does feel like there's a "trend" with players manners across world. Russians tend to be more toxic? I swear French players tend to DC more often. Japanese seem super polite and stick to the end with a GG even if you were running Iri Heads and an ebony mori. 
---
Maybe it's coincidence but it's just something I've noticed when I'm up at night and getting survivors across the globe.
---
yea but they would need to take his minigun/bazooka away
---
First two are fine, everything else is trash.
---
I know what my perogative is, but what you said is very unrealistic against good survivors most of the time. I know this because like I said, I have more play time on survivor and abuse this. And again, at the end of the day it's 4 perks vs 16, 1st person vs 3rd and 4 brains vs 1. The killer has the responsibility of gathering all the information on their own. Survivors can rely on each other. Just going down gives the other 3 survivors an idea on where the killer is. Even downing someone is not even the end. You can get the hook 99ed, flashlight saved, pallet stunned, DS, body-blocked to all hell, etc. Slugging? They can get up to 95 recovery then picked up, 1 survivor can keep you busy while the rest pick up the downed person OR they do gens. The person downed can have unbreakable, they can crawl to a pallet, another survivor can have an instant heal, etc.
---

I thought this was for dead by daylight until I saw these damned comments. Break my heart 💔
---
Everybody keeps talking about Wraith being easy to see as if that helps in every scenario you face against him. Doing a gen that’s against a wall? You can’t see him coming and he can easily get the drop on you by declaiming from behind the wall. 
---
Playing against wraith without sight lines, and without perks like Spine Chill, is personally a pain in the ass. I have more fun playing against nurse.
---
Carefully, he's a hero!
---
Even if she couldn't collide into you, you'd be fucked by the sound of your footsteps alone while you were running back into her. Collision is the *last* thing a good Spirit uses to catch you in the chase.
---
Hows she bein feckin nerfed this time?
---
The game sucks, but ive invested too much of my time into it to quit now…
---
I personally think nurse is the easiest killer to loop imo. 99% of them are garbage and even then you just run at them when they blink. Pretty simple. I’ve never died to a nurse lol
---
Hex: Obamacare
---
Link please? Seems like a baseless claim
---
I live in belarus and I know that who lives in russia can find lobby as killer as quick as who lives in Europe. So I need to be in one server. Russia or Europe. It will be mine problem if everyone will leave. Just tell me how can I do that pls
---
It is? My trapper is level 1, so I have no idea how I got it. And I just like Brutal strength.

If you can find them in the first place, that is.

You'll chase them to the other side of the map or around the three gens? I only ever go as far as the three gens, I'm not chasing them slippery Neas across the whole map unless I got a early hit and they are going towards a place with used pallets.
---
I've a problem with picking an angle. I come to the gen, start stalking only to find out that survivor is right on the other side of the gen. Starting to relocate i always give away my position. 
---
 Besides there are such things as spine chill. I played survivor the other day, using this perk. I could know that GF is after my ass even before he could get a line of sight on me. I didn't even have to check the enviorement around me. I fully relied on this perk, and it saved me.
---
 I don't even mention the object of obsession, and how much ridicilous it is. Escpecially being ran by SWF member, who tells an info to his team.
---
 And final - the whole time i've been running cooldown decrease addons. And i'm all out of them now, so looks like i'm done playing the GF. Alas...
---
I hate hag and doc
---
What's toxic about looping and 360s??? Or gen rushing for that matter lol
---
No, you can level killers without playing them at all. Just earn BP on one killer, switch to the other one to spend, then switch back to play again/

---
well NOED IT IS. So IT all balances out
---
It looks like you have teammates alive, so I’d say no. If you were like the last survivor and she boxed you in until you DC then it’s bannable. As long as the other survivors get the gens done and start endgame collapse and you die then it’s okay I think. Since she’s technically throwing the game and not indefinitely stalling it.
---
Maybe you got it in the shrine or something. All I'm saying is that running Brutal Strength on the Hag is like running it on the Nurse. I just see no point in running it when you could be running, BBQ, Nurse's Calling, M&amp;A, STBFL, MYC, Sloppy Butcher, Whispers, etc.
---
What ranks are y'all at?
---
Well in my case I lvled him first for BBQ and used him cause he was the only killer I had items for since he was the first one I lvled haven't touched him since I got BBQ though.
---
My wife bought them at Creepy Con in Knoxville TN
---
I felt that they don’t represent what type of matches the game has correctly 
---
And I don’t just mean that because there is no toxicity in the tutorials 
---
They just feel way too formulated and fake and aren’t really representative of the amount of killers,annoying perks and maps you get in most matches
---
If you'd read my comments, I said I dont run meta. I dont play to win, I play to have fun. I dont care if my perks are the worst perks known to man  it's just there to have fun

"Absolutely blast that shit straight into oblivion" im crying holy shit
---
GFmain at rank 5-8. Trust me, some games eill suck, some not. GF lack map pressure, ehich is why large maps are a handicap as well as the well known Haddonfield. With that in mind, you won't be too hard on yourself when you lose cause honestly GF is not High Tier (unfortunately). But there are ways yiu can counter and outsmart these disadvantages.
---
Tips for GF:
---
• He is easy to get looped, so make sure in time to invest bloodpoints in any perk that helps you here: Bamboozle, Enduring, Spirit Fury or Brutal Strength. I personally find Bamboozle very useful .
---
• He gets easily gen rushed because as mentioned above he lacks map pressure - you'll need Ruin hex
---
• Always stay hidden and stalk from behind cover (that's his purpose and that's how you expose them faster)
---
• Never fall for the clearly skilled survivor that's taunting you to follow him/her by spamming their flashlight at you. Know when to give up on a chase. They will loop you 5 gens if you fall for that.
---
• Mind-gaming them at pallets - they will loop you like there is no tomorrow. Get in stalk mode and crouch around to stalk them and do that until they are exposed. Hide from them so they don't reveal you.
---
* Your goal as you enter the match is to injury them all if possible, not down them cause at lower ranks that gets harder. Just chase and hit, chase and hit. 
---
* If you want to expose someone, don't do it completely from across the map, do it like 99% and then approach them and only then complete the last 1% so that you can do it in one swing. 
---
* You could also get a surveillance perk like Discordance or just get BBQ.
---
My build is: Bamboozle, BBQ, Ruin and Nurse's Calling.
---
Nurse's Calling is a great perk on stealthy killers. I find it absolutely amazing on GF. You injury them, let them run (but keep in mind the area they were) and then Night Shroud after them cause they will 90% of the time will get healed or heal themselves - easy down. Works every time for me.
---
Enjoy our Ghost boy, he's awesome. And just ignore the mean messages. Those people are counting on your reply and rage.

* Images of characters, locations, gameplay elements and the like from other franchises that would make an interesting addition to the game (e.g. Silent Hill, The Evil Within, Child's Play/Chucky, IT, ...).

They own the rights to the character but Sony owns the rights to making movies. They have since 1999. Spider-Man is a Marvel character. Not a Disney character. Disney is just lazy and buys everything. They bought Marvel. They didn't create it. Sony bought Spider-Man. Sony owns him just as much as Marvel does.
---
By the way Disney treated Stanley like shit. He was surrounded by vultures up until the end and it makes me so sad. Fuck Disney. They can't have a monopoly on everything. You people are so simple-minded and thinking so short term. The MCU is going downhill and MCU Spider-Man kind of sucked anyway. His outfit was great and Tom Holland did great but the way they portrayed Spider-Man was terrible. I'm glad Sonia sticking up to Disney. Disney is greedy and need to be taught that they can't just buy and control everything. They ruin everything like a reverse Midas Touch

I really get sick if ruin and BBQ, I get why people use them but I get sick of seeing the same perks in every single game, I'm not mad at killers for using them I just wish there were more attractive perks for them to use

This perk is trash, make it so that you automatically escape and delete the killers game after succeeding a skill check. That’s balance right there.

Able to use a flashlight properly? Toxic.
---
Able to make out a survivor waiting next to the hooked person? Toxic.

Playing the game? Toxic.

i know it ducks but that’s how some people choose to play, and they’re legit strategies, the point of the killer is to get kills. unfortunately someone is always gonna be camped so the killer can get a kill and it sounds like you got unlucky. i hope next game will be better for you! :)

For me it was just accepting that those games are gonna happen. I main the nurse so there isn’t a ton in the way of “infinite” loops against me. 
---
I know your pain though I’ve had games where 4 people load in with the same outfit and purple flashlights chain flashlight saves and escape without me able to get a single person on a hook at red ranks 😂. 
---
You just can’t let it get to you. It seems like those 10 in a row is inevitable but I think you’re just more likely to play worse cause you start to tilt in anticipation. Second guessing your gameplay maybe more hesitant to commit to things that might have downed a survivor otherwise etc. 
---
The game immediately after I get styled on by survivors I’m always much less confident in my gameplay etc. just natural.
---
Play better? It just sounds like you’re getting outplayed dude/dudette. It’s not worth getting mad over either. Especially as ghost face. Knock one down and then just endlessly tea Bag them the entire match. I’m a survivor main and when I have my dailies that’s usually how it ends with idiots who are toxic.
---
Lol, fine i'll try not to Hulk-out Woosah !!
---
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen
---
I know it’s not special to 4K green ranks for some. But I’m not the best killer and I had just purchased Leatherface. They weren’t potatoes either. Made me work for it. And I didn’t camp! Honestly expected to not get anything and have to patrol the last hook. Guess I’m happy that Leatherface isn’t as terrible as most people made him be. Definitely no Billy but even if I hadn’t 4k’d and gotten Merciless I still had loads of fun! They even looped me awhile because I was hell bent on that chainsaw.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
survivors are babies. they don’t want you to hook them, they want to be left alone so they get get easy wins. lmao
---
Yes actually, Grey and yellow ranks ain't the smartest
---
Falcon Kick!
---
Ny advice to these new people:
---
YEah, enjoy playing Demo, but if you want to progress learn a real killer, for example the Nurse or Billy.
---
Most people made him out to be that bad in higher ranks. Grats on your win, but don't be fooled into thinking he is viable :p 
---
Leatherface can only get a down when a survivor misplays badly, higher you climb the less that will happen.
---
which level, reposting a year old post or being offended by a year old repost?
---
That fucking quote
---
true but DC. if you want to complain, die and do it sure.
---
Yes those things would be common...
---
...at rank 18.
---
Anybody who regularly played this terribly would lose constantly. 
---
Somebody who doesn't play as a team will die more often than not. They will lose rank. 
---
Somebody who camps instead of applying map pressure will usually get 1 kill. They will lose rank.
---
I’m just confused by its wording. It says it blocks detection perks but the only killer that does that is Myers in tier one
---
People will just give each other shit for running certain perks.
---
Adorable! Some reason reminded me of Gravity Falls
---
Steve is what I imagine myself looking. Quentin is what I actually look like
---
Wannna trade lol
---
&gt; That gets like 30 levels if that.
---
I think that's a main reason for the cap. To prevent having fully perked new characters (killers especially) an hour after DLC release.
---
It was totally fine when we had three killers and a handful of characters, but yeah, it’s time to evolve the cap.
---
Too pretty seems interesting. I almost feel like it should have the obsession tag
---
Pretty easy to just vault windows and camp pallets, red ranks I have seen are good in general and abuse that. 11-9 have been decent players but make some punishable mistakes.
---
my BP is on the generator flying across the map and landing destroyed
---
Hi I may be off with my perks but I got babygirl last week so I'm experimenting around, while I still don't have all too many perks unlocked anyways.
---
As perks I use:
---
• ruin
---
• sloppy butcher
---
• BBQ (even though that's mostly for the blood points)
---
• nurse's calling
---
I like switching up Nurse's for lightborn when I see a flashlight or two in the lobby. It's worth gold.
---
Hag isn't in it for chases, so if I had the perk, I'd switch up Nurse's for haunted grounds. Survivors are definitely going to get rid of Ruin so might more likely cleanse/activate HG.
---
As add-ons, I use teleport range add ons (green cicada) and sometimes quicker trap placement.
---
Wider trap range has proven more likely to screw me over, since I won't get the survivor by just teleporting over.
---
I mean I get but once you get to max blood points you can basically stop playing. That’s one of the most satisfying things is to be rewarded for what you played. After you are at max it’s just like why play because you get no rewards.
---
I love facing Spirit. Although she is rough to play against, she is still jukable. I play her a lot and I realize how scratch marks appear to her. Abuse the scratch marks and remain out of sight when she begins to stand still. Also never vault into her husk unless you literally have Spine Chill to tell you she's not actually looking at you.
---
There are also several perks that straight up confuse her, deny her information, or give you information. Dance With Me, Quick and Quiet, and Poised are good examples of mindgaming her. Quick and Quiet can be used to vault twice but only give one audible cue which can throw off her perception of your position. Dance With Me and Poised remove scratch marks which she relies on to get a general sense of where you are.
---
Spine Chill and Iron Will the best perks against her. Spine Chill tells you when to prepare for her and you can also use it to predict where she is at in phase walk and also if she is phase walking or not. Use your imagination to outplay her. Iron Will removes your pain grunts.
---
Honestly Spine Chill alone makes it difficult for Spirit. Use it position to yourself well when she comes and remain healthy as long as you can against her. She can't track you nearly as well when you're injured so if you can basically deny her a hit for even like 40 seconds, you gained a ton of time on her. It's up to other survivors to utilize that time.
---
Flashlights can also be great for blinding the "husk" She cannot enter phase walk or maintain it being blinded. She loses information so if you get a passive Spirit, flashlights and good game sense will crush them hard.
---
We also have that new Nancy perk coming soon to even directly tell you how your scratch marks appear and give you extra walk speed. Both will be incredibly useful against Spirit, more than against any other killer.
---
Very much. I think simply increasing it by a million would satisfy me enough
---
Why you gotta attack us??
---
&gt; Pretty easy to just vault windows and camp pallets
---
There is a *ton* more to it than that
---
Camping pallets is crap tier survivor
---
Finally something good to fucking upvote
---
Oh for sure. I don’t think he’ll be viable for red ranks. But I’m never really in there much anyways and I never have time when I am. So won’t be much of a problem for me.
---
And then what? Red ranks will be filled with atrocious teammates that would make you want to rip your hair off? No thanks,
---
I main Spirit and I'm on PS4. I rarely use Prayer Beads because I know how it is going up against it lol. In my opinion she's fine as she is, I have no problem going up against her as survivor as well, its completely dependent on the players build and skill as her. I love trying new perks, new builds.. And I don't always win, I get spanked by good survivors that can counter her. It depends on the map for me.. 
---
Please don't nerf the second killer that I enjoy playing that still scares the shit out of me, Myers being the first. 
---
- Spirit main that loves Japanese horror
---
Honestly, hag is a very slow killer, so bloodhound feels like a waste of time when you could put on Stridor (for the stealthy players). Also, Whispers usually doesn't do much - you're very slow per se and need to play with strategic trap placement instead of tracking survivors and killing them.
---
The problem is that asymmetric games don’t work well with ELO. You can’t measure killer performance vs survivors because they’re not remotely similar. In all ELO games both side are playing the same game, but in DBD one side is playing a teamwork game with intentionally hobbled teamwork, the other side is playing a blitzkrieg whack a mole game with no teamwork elements. Two different games, can’t be judged on the same ELO.
---
Reading that made me realize that I don't know any of the lingo for this game.
---
Do it!
---
He would 100% be called the slasher
---
Bill, Jane and Jeff were confirmed to be the top loudest, I believe.
---
Have [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0aFo4lPARw) Skip to 2:16 for the test.
---
They are miserable.
---
That's because the game is horribly unbalanced. 
---
The game stays unbalanced for a lot of reasons,  but it doesn't help that when the devs look at rank 1 stats they see numbers about the games top killers getting 4k's on Bubba against players with rank 10 skill levels and determining "Cannibal is fine".
---
Yeah, I had a feeling they would pull some shit when right before the match started they said "My plan is to do gens allright? gg".
---
Saying “mind game” as if it isn’t literally a mind game
---
A double-footed dropkick means double the regression
---
Imagine the stars aligning for these perks to work all at once and thinking that would be broken.
---
-Flip flop literally never gets proper use unless the killer is super slugging
---
-Boil over only makes wiggles mess with the killer’s movement more, it doesn’t make you wiggle faster
---
-DS is only used once per match after being unhooked within a minute
---
-Too Pretty to Die requires wiggle bar AND a pallet, so a killer would be asking for it anyways if he got hit by it
---
And finally, whoop dee doo, you’re using four situational perks to gain the strength of one. Old DS was strong because it was a single perk, not fucking four.
---
the perk icon had me laughing for a while 😂
---
Ghostface be like: I'm all ears!
---
She looks so innocent

Ah yes. The average 10 IQ dbd player mentality.
---
You know whats weird i got it today fron endgame
---
Helis aka The Terror of the Sun as a killer with Aloy or Sylens as the survivor. 
---
Wesker and Jill Valentine.
---
bruh, just HIT them what are you so afraid of lmao. So yeah, they get the unhook but that's an easy 2 survivors injured already, and if the unhooked didnt take a hit with BT then you can down the one who just unhooked.  That's 2 hooks back to back I'm not sure what's so hard about that. And 3 people coming to hook? Dude that means only one person is doing a gen, and if you got Thanatophobia you can probably down 2 people in the time that that one gen gets done.
---
While I can see your reasoning, I think you misunderstand the way **Brotherhood** and **Pain Killer** work.
---
**Pain Killer** does not give the healer Endurance. Only the one being healed is given Endurance, and only for 2/3/4 seconds, so I doubt it could be used to that effect. Even if some one where to 99% another survivor, and then heal them in order to body block, etc, it wouldn't be the most effective way to body block in the game. 3 Seconds isn't enough to effectively stall as the killer trys to move around you.
---
**Brotherhood** only awards tokens when standing within a 10 meter radius of a survivor that is put into the dying state, and at the most, you'd need to obtain 2 tokens to gain one stack of endurance. This would mean you would have to be within 10 meters of a survivor twice when they're put into the dying state which, in turn, means they waste quite some time.  
---
**Us or Them** is also a very hard perk to activate and use effectively. It's made to help survivors escape the killer's grasp, and even then, to use it to it's best potential, you would have had to have been healed 4 times in order to get that 40% wiggle progress. AND, in order to get the *Endurance* hit for the user of the perk, you would need to escape from the killer's grasp by wiggling, not being flashlight or pallet saved.
---
Yeah, all killers should have to be mindlessly looped around one of the strongest loops with little counter play 
---
To be honest, thats the build I would most likely run if I actively try to go for the "Kill 4 survivors by your own hands" achievement.
---
Bond /Empathy and wounded survivor icon and their screams.
---
&gt; They are miserable. That's because the game is horribly unbalanced. 
---
No, balance is not what's wrong with red ranks.
---
&gt; they see numbers about the games top killers getting 4k's on Bubba against players with rank 10 skill levels
---
It reads like killers with r10 skills can't get to r1, which is false.
---
Hag has an extremely easy time landing single hits, that's why perks that help this playstyle and punish healing are OP. She also has a small terror radius and body, making M&amp;A an extremely good perk on her.
---
Here are some perks I recommend, since I main her:
---
Hex: Ruin
---
Make Your Choice (extremely powerful to get momentum and force survs to crouch and scatter)
---
Nurse's Calling
---
Monitor and Abuse (great on its own, even better with Nurse's
---
Sloppy Butcher (in place of MYC for higher ranks, if you feel like they know how to hide)
---
So ur saying people just run medkits and not self care? What about toolboxes withself care? That’s what I do. You always will have to heal one way or another
---
It literally is mind games my dude.
---
The game is full of annoying glitches but we still love it
---
Switch up your perks to cover your weaknesses. Are you having trouble finding them? Chasing them down? Getting looped was the thing you mentioned so let’s talk about that.
---
You can change your killer; certain killers are much more resistant to looping, so you have options to try out nurse, or spirit, or even huntress if you have good aim.
---
You can change your perks; some perks allow you to change up your behavior in loop chases. Run enduring or spirit fury and just push through the pallets, forcing the drop but overall saving some time. Brutal Strength and Fire Up will Help you break them faster.
---
You can change up your play style to avoid getting into loops; Tinkerer for example helps you sneak up on other survivors, you just have to be willing to give up the chase on existing survivors. Or maybe let them loop but draw out the game with a Hex Ruin. Or maybe even just settle for an end game hook with NOED; I’ve had countless times where a 0K turned into a 1K that the overconfident survivors (who’ve been bullying me all game with flashies and loops) won’t accept, so it eventually turns into a 4K.
---
Good luck!
---
seems mad
---
What about Ash lol
---
Lol bitching on Freddy when he used to be the laughing stock of the killers. Puts a smile on my face. 
---
Anyway, I usually take it as a compliment if they're toxic in end chat. I try to stay as polite and kind as possible while they're venting. Both sides want different results and that will clash.
---
Yeah I’ve noticed that within the first few rounds. They try to go for the longer loops and it ends up hurting them in the end with a simple mind game or double backing. Making him one of the more effective M1 killers if you choose to play him that way.
---
I'm in between in each argument.
---
**thing that makes me laugh:** When Spirit just used her power, she clearly don't have her ready yet, she stands still and someone runs into her. 
---
I'm like "C'mon man, how are you this dumb?". 
---
Many of the spirit's tricks can easily be read/predicted. I really like playing against not very good spirits.
---
**Sadly, fun ends when you face a good spirit or one with no wooshing sound tho.**
---
Unless you run Spine Chill, you can't tell when you'll get grabbed off the gen.
---
She can bump into you.
---
She's so fast, there's usually no time to make scratch marks in one direction and walk to the other one. She can just stop where the marks end, end her power and you'll just stand next to her.
---
She can hear you when you're injured, turning her power from a mindgame to "down the closest injured person, lol"
---
semi-safe loops are not safe at all against her, as there's not enough space to do anything
---
When other killers rely on actual mindgames in some strong window loops (like the house on Huntress'es map), she can simply use her power, go around and wait until you bump into the person or hear a dropping sound.
---
1700 hours and I still barely see him even when all my rank 15 teammates dc against him
---
Nah that's mental gymnastics there.  Camping is scummy and toxic too so you don't get to put it all on them.  If you choose to camp and tunnel feel free to do so but don't get outraged or surprised when you're called out for it.
---
Oh, i thought it was him pretending to be a survivor, or being sarcastic...
---
I hate the bad rep that toxic Nea’s get for those of us who just wanna play the game and make it enjoyable for everyone. They’re all just N0ob3 wannabes who drop every pallet they see
---
Cuz they used to rule the world
---
*with Michael myers voice*
---
Person get's unhooked, instantly healed (thx adrenalin) so you have one person injured, 3 bodyblocking for him, gate is 99. and you can't do anything, who even camps when gens are up who ist't grey ranks
---
and because it needs a mori/devour/rancor, you get 60k for it.
---
When I play killer and someone unhooks right in front of me, I usually take pity let the unhooked survivor go and go chase down the other one. No one deserves to be farmed to death early in the game.
---
No i know tuft is infinite tier 3 but do you really need something so strong when you already have an ebony mori it seems like a bit of a waste
---
I love it when i get dodged as soon as  a load in as a 4 man SWF. IG i can kinda understand dodging if you are at a high rank and are playing like fuckin wraith or somthing.
---
but what i dont understand is that, do people not like challenge? I always look towards improving as huntress when i play at a high rank, When i lose 2 a SWF sure it can be annoying. but most high rank SWFs are just players doing there best to survive and make sure there friends do as well. Most of them are not toxic
---
Ya calm your nerves and you play the game.
---
now that im starting to think about it...louder noises from survivors ...making easier for killers to hear the survivors, indirectional lullabies...Devs really spoon baby feed the killers...oh wow
---
Haven't played vs him yet, but other like Meg isn't that loud, I mean when they are only injured, not when hitted/hooked
---
I'm not sure if I qualify to give my opinions. I play mostly survivor, but if one reads my comments on this sub, you'll see why everyone calls me a "salty killer main".
---
Instead of having to normal m1 people down, his power would take a portion of the deep wounds timer down on hit, (With franks mixtape increasing that to 33.3334% or something) meaning legion could bypass the survivors defenses easily at the cost of having to 4 hit down them (or 3 when using franks mixtape) Legion could also abuse the fact that deep wounds only stopped regressing when in a chase by moonwalk chasing survivors, and finally legion could generally vault windows and pallets faster in frenzy.
---
Jesus all the comments here are just gold
---
Good survivors will win more than they lose.
---
They will climb if they earn it, but it will take some time and most players will see their ranks plateau before rank 1.
---
Funny, if you tie ranking to wins, the best rank becomes exclusive to the best players... who could have guessed...
---
Didn't y'all know? Looping and 360s are toxic. Survivors trying to survive is toxic.
---
ahhhh, that would be better. but at high ranks i can only really see this happening once every 10 or so games. even so it would be a massive waste of time to just run after the killer
---
r/madlads
---
I honestly don't believe that this regularly happens to you or anyone else that uses Kindred above rank 17 and says this unless you/they are playing in a manner that makes your team hate you, named something offensive or getting camped, I'm sure you've been left on hook with Kindred once or twice and it's made you write the perk off... and solo play? If you want to play SWF then go for it but there's no need to disparage a good/underused perk for solo play especially with all the potential new players floating around, the reality is that this perk greatly increases your team's efficiency and makes getting left on the hook even rarer than it is without Kindred.
---
I don't know, sometimes I read this subreddit and wonder if I'm playing the same game.
---
the best and only advice, play two weeks after rank reset.
---
I have a bit of a meme build in the works (still waiting for the bloodwebs to cooperate) that includes Kindred, Bond, Detectives Hunch, and Open Handed. Paired with a map it should be fun
---
No lunge and get stunned I don't think should count or the stacks would be too easy to do. I was thinking more about missed hits like when the survivor vaults and you hit the window ( or also the pallet if already down) or maybe missed hit during normal chase caused by a 360 or just the killer hitting too soon. Obviously the hit missed by dead hard should also not count as well or the combo dead hard + MoM would be too Op. Btw I would also increase the amount of stacks needed to 4/5 maybe. I think that could be a great change cause it rewards survivors who can 360 and understand when they have a safe vault even if really close to get hit, penalize more bad killers and top tier killers like nurse and spirit but at the same time a good killer doesn't miss 4/5 hits on each survivor every game so it would still be a dead perk slot in some matches. Maybe that could be a solution to make a complete garbage perk into something worth.
---
...I said NO TOUCHY
---
it means that the map couldn't spawn the minimal amount of pallets and was forced to thrown the "pallets should be far from eachother" rule out of the window
---
if there are 3 pallets, then that means there are whole 5 on the entire rest of the map
---
David too, I see that a lot as killer
---
Whenever I find a "nice killer" i just genrush as fast as possible and escape. 
---
If you don't want to play the game, don't play it. Stop wasting my time.
---
Ash is loud too, but I personally think he isn't as noticeable as those three. I'd say he is at the same tier as David.
---
that too ;.;
---
jesus fucking Christ some of these are so unbalanced. I dont think people understand how much even 3%  movement speed actually is. You are saying that when the end game happens, the killer will have 130% movement speed?  thats fucking crazy
---
Good luck getting a game as swf then.
---
hahahaha very nice. fresh !!!
---
yeah, i never said camping/tunneling wasn’t toxic. it’s scummy. taking the time out of your day to harass killer mains just because you’re mad you got camped is STILL way more scummy. people forget killer mains are actual people, not just some NPC.
---
&gt;Rank is, above all, a measure of skill for matchmaking to use as a tool to create fair games.
---
And sometimes you can win without being skilful. 
---
&gt;survivor hid in lockers for 8 straight minutes and let all their allies die, but they got the hatch
---
...
---
No. He moves at 115. No stacking.
---
and what completed rituals will I keep for the next DLC? having that sweet 1180k instead of 1000k feels good.
---
Mori rituals give you 60k BECAUSE they need a specific offering/perk
---
What counterplay?
---
*insert game mechanic*  "wow so unfair"  
---
  
---
You do realize there's perks to counter auditory cues?  ~~iron will, great perk, calm spirit,  gets rid of those OP crows too!~~  This is intended. You're supposed to be able to hear an injured person moan in pain.
---
You right
---
Shouldn't have to run 2 perks to counter a killer.
---
let you know when people are asleep vs freddy
---
This. Survivors see a leatherface &amp; immediately go into bully mode, attempting to body block you from hooks, blind you &amp; expect you to respect pallets. Once they realize you have a good concept of mindgames &amp; survivor play styles most go into derp mode. LF is just one of those killers where he could either be a complete idiot or somebody who knows how to play killer, most of the time it’s the first one sadly
---
Someone get this to Samination...NOW
---
Adrenaline?
---
Framed in desperation gives 15% faster movement speed.
---
Looping and using borrowed time is toxic? Lol...
---
I assumed we were talking about camping in general, in end game I don't mind it--- you can secure your 1K but   
---
if you're at that point when all gens were done and you didn't get a single kill you didn't apply enough pressure early game or focus on gens. That being said, you can do some things for end-game: if there's one gen left, try to hook close to one of the doors. Camp that door as much as possible after gens are done, and stay just close enough to the hook so that you can get there fast enough but it won't proc Borrowed Time. It would be good if you're playing a killer with mobility to put on MYC or last resort noed but that's counterable by a sentient team. If the other door is far away enough you could probably get another pick and if you had the room on your build for it, blood warden will definitely secure you some more kills.
---
Piggies tunnel survivors with traps on their heads 100% of the time.
---
Trappers are either really bad at the game or literal gods.
---
Yeah.
---
100+15=115
---
I’d love to see more of these, this is great!
---
it's killer instinct and Myers etc doesn't have that.
---
Jeff is not a killer AFAIK.
---
Also, those perks are strong on some killers, thanks to killers being different from one anothee. The issue with survivors is that they're not distinguishable. Force some of them into specialist roles and you'll see a bloom in new meta perks: doctors will make We'll Make It a meta perk, technicians will make Prove Thyself meta, supports will make Saboteur or Breakdown meta. The way survs are planned right now, they all use the same meta perks because they provide general utility and are useful in mostly every game. And this shouldn't be right in a 4v1 cooperative game. Try playing with your SWF one as the gen jockey, one as the doctor, one as the runner and one as the plunderer, and you'll see how you'll still win many of the games.
---
Now try running a suboptimal Killer build without playing Nurse/Spirit/Billy.
---
Can survivors reveal GF while in a locker? Always thought about that. I'd imagine since they both see KI, he might see them in a locker too.
---
Either way, wack.
---
Right no way this is real haha. I Mean no one is this brain dead right?
---
I do agree the system needs a rework but this isn't it. Was a good laugh reading it and all the comments.
---
360s are not as reliable as they where, i would only really see this happening if they fixed hitboxes and made spinning more of a valid strat
---
Yeah I’ve noticed that about pigs too. I mean if it works then more power to them I guess
---
Are these mods behaving this way?
---
Why does BHVR allow a bunch of juvenile losers to run its official discord? At this point it should be shut down, and relaunched by actual staff at BHVR who know how to behave with more maturity than a 12 year old.
---
&gt; since we don’t have a casual mode  
---
Oh no... not this shit again... do people really think we should have it? 
---
Just think about it for 5 minutes and you'll see why this game should never have a "casual mode"
---
but about the actual topic. It's quite hard to teach someone how to loop in KYF games, so making an AI teach you that would be even harder. There are too many possible mind-games for that
---
i didnt say remove the injured sounds...just stop making it louder...god no, Claudette’s will be unstoppable
---
once again...look how the game is evolved since 2016...my point, each time there is a new dlc the survivor will be louder than the original 5. 
---
Wait for Nancy...she will be screaming while injured ready to give birth
---
do you not know how fast killers are? survivors run at 100% movement speed. The average killer runs at 115 (Trapper, billy, wraith, pig, clown, ect) While killers like The hag, huntress, spirit, and nurse move at a overall slower speed.
---
Im not sure with ghostface. Havent played him and havent ever tried revealing him from a locker.
---
Bond
---
Mmk.
---
The Mentor runs at 100% base speed then.
---
Good? Good.
---
I would add , Become Jesus Christ for tue whole game after either failing or succeding a skill check .
---
Killer instinct doesn't show auras tho.
---
that's 100% what i stopped playing her too.. you don't feel rewarded for kicking a survivor ass in any other killer. afk and fail ( not likely to happen ). or phase with 50/50% MiNdGaME. and god save you if she was running anal beads.
---
the "aoe" insta down + he's easy to loop
---
You won't see camping above green ranks though, you literally depip in purple ranks even if you get a 4k with camping, except for endgame obv. But this was what I was saying, no one likes doing it, it's mostly desperation because you couldn't keep pressure up, and that happens to the best of us. I jsut haven't seen anyone getting anything done by camping at all and now we get a surv perk that punishes it even harder, that's what annoys me.
---
if survivors are being assholes, why can’t killers be assholes???
---
Already gave this advice today to someone. GF is tricky at lower ranks. I'm GF main at rank 5-8. Trust me, some games will suck, some not. GF lacks map pressure, which is why large maps are a handicap as well as the well known Haddonfield.
---
• NEVER fall for the clearly skilled survivor that's taunting you to follow him/her by spamming their flashlight at you. Know when to give up on a chase. They will loop you 5 gens if you fall for that.
---
 • Your goal as you enter the match is to injury them all if possible, not down them cause at lower ranks that gets harder. Just chase and hit, chase and hit. Don't tunnel the unhooked, go for the healthy one, redirect their priorities so they don't work on gens.
---
 • If you want to expose someone, don't do it completely from across the map, do it like 99% and then approach them and only then complete the last 1% so that you can do it in one swing. 
---
 • You could also get a surveillance perk like Discordance or just get BBQ.
---
Nurse's Calling is a great perk on stealthy killers. I find it absolutely amazing on GF. You injury them, let them run (but keep in mind the area they were) and then Night Shroud after them cause they will 90% of the time will get healed or heal themselves - easy down. Works every time for me. Honestly I use his power for surprise attacks rather than expose them, probably I expose once or twice per match or never.
---
Just ignore the mean messages. Those people are counting on your reply and rage.
---
Left behind rework tho cause now that the hatch spawns on last survivor no matter what it needs to do something different
---
I know that but i feel like its dumb that if i use a mirror i cant see them if they are in a locker while i am slow af.
---
Meanwhile legion is running around at 125% and can find anyone within their terror radius just because "it isnt an aura".
---
You're a gift to this community. I like your sense of humor and I love your art style. Great work!
---
Ah yes the catchphrase heard all around the sub when someone doesn't understand the problems with it and can't tell original jokes.
---
I'm on PS4 and whenever I boot up the game, for the entire loading screen, the fans just decide to go batshit crazy.
---
Earrape the killer so bad they DC
---
**Survivors**
---
Adrenaline is the best. I always expect everyone to have it. if I pop the last gen and I see you not get healed, I won't even try to rescue you once you go down.
---
Left Behind is a perk you can't even use.
---
**Killers**
---
BBQ for those sweet points. I usually don't take any perks for that ultimate disrespect, but I will put BBQ at the last slot. Not for the aura, for those sweet double points.
---
Worst? it's actually quite hard. I'd say Beast Of Prey, but almost all of them have A use. Most are niche, but they exist
---
Thank you! I'm trying to work on a series. The 3rd one is also already done, but I have to come up with some ideas for the other killers as well
---
Can you cut through butter?
---
but swf concept make the game unfun regarding a lot of mechanics.
---
It's interesting to not have direct communication in this kind of game 'cause it force you to guess things and to take decisive choices.
---
Yeah, I like Nancy more too
---
It makes sense to me. Michael can see auras and Legion has Killer Instinct. Two different mechanics that work in their own ways. 
---
That's how I see it.
---
Keep 'em comin, man. I'll eat that shit up.
---
I'm a killer main and agree

I dont see how this argument changes anything. all you said was that the best survivor perks where the ones that are useful in every situation. Your entire rant just dived straight into the whole "Survivors OP pls nerf" shit
---
This new healing perk will be good yes, but healing has been nerfed so hard good survivors stay injured most of the game. (with a few acceptations) you cant even attempt to argue that survivors have not been starved for perks when killers got 3 amazing perks with the spirit and survivors legit got a meme perk.
---
Hahah! xD I love it cause it's exactly how I'd scream lmao. Hag and Myers are the only ones that can get me like this lmao
---
Isn't it one of discord's guidelines for official servers that these servers are NOT community-led? Either this server got their official status accidently (because everyone says it's led by fans) or the server team is indeed a part of BHVR... which makes this worse, actually.
---
They had us in the first half
---
Oh good stuff boi
---
Im a fan of all of these tbh, the 3rd feels the most original, but i've got my own spin on it, mostly where each attack of the legions in frenzy will apply stacks of "bleeding", causing debuffs and eventually a 1-shot. these can be mended with time, but only go away one at a time. They could attack each survivor multiple times, but only up to 3 times (6 stacks needed for all 3 effects) before being stunned, meaning you can go back and forth to fuck over a few at a time, then choose your target.
---
Coupled with this the legion can switch back and forth between members to catch survivors by surprise, or to use as "cameras" for aura reading.
---
Basically the band of hoodlums bleed people dry and then capitalise by making them fuck up.
---
I never understood why would you chase someone that is not doing gens for awhile. If they run into you sure, down them, but piggies be beelining straight for the unhooked survivor.
---
Premonition is practically useless
---
Spine Chill is underrated tho. It doesn't give you that one time second chance tho, so it doesn't fit the "Meta". It lets you make much more informed decisions, adds a few seconds to almost every chase and counters both the strongest (Nurse, Spirit) and all stealth killers
---
it's not DBd anymore. What people have to understand is that Swf breaks the core mechanics. 
---
The real game is Solo
---
You almost got me
---
I actually love this, I want more
---
so the killers power is only moves at a normal 115 when using his power that makes him faster?
---
best when it works.
---
worst when it doesn't.
---
but it also works when it doesn't.
---
and doesn't when it does.
---
Or they could just play them game and not be salty.
---
I see him the least. I'm on console and I *still* see more Nurse's than Clowns.
---
If he's not suing I'm Tuesday. Wait...
---
Well the less players there are the higher chances the killer has of winning. However, it’s not a smart strategy since you’ll probably get “gen-rushed.”
---
it will kill solo. There is nothing you could implement that would make solo as strong as swf. Which means you would just always lose as solo.
---
Swf isn't just about external communication, it's about knowing each other and willing to work together to make the team win.
---
Lmao, the original creator did do a whole video and one for ‘This Is Halloween’ with Trapper, Wraith and Hillbilly xxx 🙌😊😊 I linked the vid and channel in the comment xxx 🙌😉😊
---
Killer instinct isnt an aura
---
It would be nice but I get the impression that BHVR just want to make new survivors instead of making an entirely new model for Quentin. Besides most people buy that DLC for Freddy because Quentin's perks are all very underwhelming.
---
Yeah crying over someone playing shitty.
---
Deliverance and Distortion are extremely strong perks. They may not fit your playstyle, that's another discussion.
---
Also, "survivors OP pls nerf" might suggest you haven't read my post, in which I'm actually asking for buffs?
---
He didn't do that stupid dance in the oroginal though, unless you count the tantrum at the end.
---
I thought I forgot to stream this match and was upset cause this was the best jump scare I’ve had with an awesome lucky dodge hit too! Myers Tier 1 is terrifying
---
I would pay money just to have BHVR do some justice to my boy

A repost just got 1k up votes. E p i c
---
Haddonfield, Legion's snowy map and Azarov's Resting Place
---
Haddonfield - Balance Landing Fest, no mind games, just semi-infinites all over the place, not fun for either side.
---
Legion's snowy map - I don't know why, I just hate it. Maybe because of all the issues that came with it. Maybe because of Legion's existance. Maybe that I just die instantly as a survivor and can never catch anyone as a killer
---
Azarov's Resting Place - Yo how to design a good, balanced map? Make it a **STRAIGHT LINE**. Killer has to just stand on one side of the map and never leave it. Oh, look, free 3-gen. The fact that most randoms don't even think about gen priority until it's too late doesn't help.
---
I think his nap should be either S-Mart or the castle from army of darkness.
---
Yeah That's what i was thinking to when she fully healed after escaping the trap, but if you check her perks she doean't have adrenaline.. :/
---
The point is,its a teachable,using it on a already 115% killer would make it almost as fast as sprint burst.very very unbalanced.
---
Yyyyep. Let me explain.
---
I built this character around the concept of being able to stall until endgame without getting his ass kicked, with stuns n flashlights in mind.
---
This is because I made a Max and Chloe as well, both of them are apparently broken so my first step was “counter Max and Chloe”. Which makes sense for good ole Jeffershit here.
---
However, when I thought about his power, and the frenzy thing, I got worried he’d be too strong if it gave him a 15% bonus to movement if he’s already moving at 110-115 anyways. So he moves at 100 by base, 105 when not chasing an obsession, and 115 if he’s chasing ANYBODY while frenzied.
---
That in itself is broken. As far as I know, 115 is the fastest killer in the game. So the trade off is that he can’t move at 115 while carrying a survivor and can’t pull anyone off of an action unless he’s moving at the “normal” (normal for him) 100 movement.
---
Does that make sense? This is a lot of info I should’ve shared but if you noticed, just showing the 5 blocks of info I did took up all my room.
---
Can’t do either of those- they own the rights to Ash vs Evil Dead, not Army of Darkness or the first two Evil Dead movies.
---
Well what are you running?
---
Two potential buffs I'd love to see on him are either true invisibility (no shimmer), or a dash attack out of invisibility (Kinda like Demogorg?), with a wind-up time but decent range.
---
We'll make it spine chill self heal and empathy
---
Plenty of killers act like all survivor mains are toxic and the scum of the earth.
---
Scene taken from?
---
Haha I do hope it happens! Maybe if Freddy and him get cosmetics it they might do it.
---
What? Theres plenty of good killer perks.
---
I hope so
---
IDK ... sounds weak to me. it needs a little buff if the devs only listen we would not complain all the time. I would say to balance it out after hitting the skill check all the gens get done and noed gets broken with the exit gates open immediately. that should sort it out, if they made the EGC timer freeze until all survivor gets out should be good .. but I think that would break it :/ dunno.
---
Red mori and tunnel like hell
---
Adrenaline then.
---
There's only like 3 situations to not recover immediate, you're next to a pallet and you can recover there, you're in basement and don't want your team in that choke point staircase so you go to the top and recover , you have DS and the exit gate is open
---
I personally play without self care and no medic kit but I still recommend self care for new players
---
gens ... ruined so many people lives
---
Exactly this. I always used to dodge SWFs as killer, but then, how will i improve if i don’t face challenges and better groups? I always pay attention to how they loop me and how they play the game to next time i face something like that, i can counter.
---
People acting like teabagging makes you the scum of the earth is pre ridiculous. Complaining about it on Reddit is only gonna encourage it as the toxic people know its gonna get under your skin.
---
The problem isn't swf. It's how games go so quickly with some maps being nightmares to chase on and with gens being easy to complete.
---
The communication swf adds only makes this worse. Hence why people dodge
---
the main reason is that there were (and still are) ways to cheat bloodpoints and they don't want people to set up a new acc, cheat 70m bloodpoints, max a few characters, play some games, get banned and do that all over again (and yes, some people did that and it was a pain to deal with so they just capped it)
---
If that's how you feel...but just play spirit then Like I said, you won't get looped.
---
&gt; against a really good nurse
---
Good nurse with omega blink add-ons? ~1.5 gens no ruin
---
A *really* good nurse? Probably almost exit gates powered...
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/CuriousHorribleYakinikuRitzMitz

you spend like 100k and then play a bit more, repeat.

Cant counter a good one.

Killer main?
---
bond only show an other survivors aura to YOURSELF. 
---
Kindred show to the whole team, every survivors aura + the killer aura if he stays near the hook.
---
They have two different purpose. Bond is great to always know where your teamates are : to team up to fix gen faster, or to find someone to heal you, or to know where you shouldn't lead the killer during a chase...
---
It’s not just challenging, they are actively cheating,
---
How did you get 80k bloodpoints ?
---
Playing against SWF isn't fun. I'll play against 2 man SWF, but if I even see a hint of 4 man SWF I dodge the shit out of that game lol.
---
I dunno I went right in as killer with ghost face and winning more than I lose my rank is in the 18s but I'm going against purples half the time
---
I'm in red ranks and I still see camping. But besides that I don't understand why you're so annoyed about camaraderie when it applies to end game, because its literal counter is the end game timer. Before the gens are done though, yeah, it will punish camping that's why you gotta learn how much distance procs borrowed time and stay out of it while still being able to keep an eye on the hook. I strongly suspect MYC will become meta this next patch. And if you're constantly getting games where you have to secure the 1k at end game, you have to learn to play better, just like how survivors who are constantly losing to tunnel chases need to get better.
---
Fly kick Myers is best Myers
---
I played against a 3 man swf yesterday, they let the guy who was not in their group die on first hook, then they decided to hide and not do anything the whole game. After I found and killed them all (which as you imagine, did take a while) they flamed me in the lobby, calling me a noob for only getting 15k bloodpoints. Got a headache from that one.

I chainsawed a couple people, smacked everyone else, hit some gens, broke a couple pallets. Chased everyone around for a while since it was my first time as LF but managed to down them to not lose chase points. That’s the basics to getting an 80k. It was also a pretty close match between me and all survivors since it was my first time and I was learning as I went.
---
I had this one guy teabagging at the gate for so long but he wasn't close enough to the edge and a Freddy came round the corner and smacked him down. It. Was. Beautiful.
---
No we dont need another pre nerf DS
---
If a Survivor does gens, unhooks people and cleanses totems, but gets hit with NOED and the camped; they depip? How is that fair?
---
Plus, putting all the pressure on escaping would make matches incredibly stressful and encourage people to hide and avoid taking any risks.
---
As for Killers: basing ranking on *if* you get kills, rather than *how* you get them, will encourage camping and tunnelling. 
---
The current systems base ranking (for both sides) on being able to keep many plates spinning and prioritise certain tasks. 
---
Do you go for the unhook or try to finish the gen? Did you take time out to cleanse totems? Can you draw the Killer away from your teammates and keep them in a chase for a long time?
---
Do you maintain the chase or protect gens? Do you defend the hook or go on the hunt? Do you spread the pain across multiple Survivors or focus on getting one out of the game?
---
Without this decision-making, players would be hitting red ranks *way* before they are ready.
---
Swf claudettes usually do yolo saves so just use leatherface and make them angry🤪
---
She also has built in slowdown with her traps. I main wraith and love him but unless you're using very specific addons he's kind of awful especially against an aware team. Or some prick with Object of Obsession.
---
And then you realize you can't consistently win by doing that...
---
For every time an immersed Claudette escapes by doing nothing, they'll get killed nine times because their team couldn't carry their dead weight.
---
Yet someone who plays very well, but loses a Survivor to the hatch, gets a loss and depip? That's just demoralizing.
---
I like how you think. I could've iri head, flowering babushka &amp; the red mori.
---
Only way too truly deal with it is to let it go who cares.  I had to learn this myself. Them being toxic will have no effect on your next game
---
Maybe not consistently, but they’ll still be persistent in waiting for the hatch and not helping their teammates. This doesn’t work at all, as I said it makes people less altruistic and impossible to win if the killer is tunneling you. Right now even if the killer is chasing you all game you can still pip which is extremely fair since without it every game would just be based on RNG. There’s literally no reason for the game to work like this, it’ll ruin everything with no good advantages.
---
No shit sherlock
---
Now I want full custom match support with various sliders and checkboxes determining how many gens need done, move speed, swing speed, repair speed, etc.
---
2021 bro that's bro too long for me bro
---
Hallo, this is made with SFM!
---
It hurts how accurate your statement is to probably most of the playerbase including my self
---
I have none, because at the end of the day it’s the player that chooses to play a certain way and not the killer who forces you to play that way.
---
Back when hatch standoffs where a thing, glad they are finally gone.
---
Never said that,  but OK.
---
Literally nobody thinks a 4k should be necessary to pip.
---
A 3k? Maybe. 
---
It's easy to say what should count as a survivor win since there's a simple binary of "did you live?".
---
You have to think a little more for killers,  though it really isn't that hard.
---
You do get that this isn’t meant to be taken seriously right?
---
My ruin will take forever to find and Devour Hope will go down in just over a minute.
---
then you can grind for items/add-ons on killers/survivor you play the most.
---
The cap was introduced because there were many problems with them and there has to be SOME cap so you can't just play, get around 50m bloodpoints and P3fullperk everyone the moment they come out
---
I upvoted the instant I saw the Queen
---
I’ve had killers dc after all 5 totems are destroyed and they see no NOED
---
Who cares though? It's still more fun to go against than someone who literally doesn't care because they're playing with garbage on.
---
I know 🤷🏻‍♂️, but  I’ve seen a lot of different players (altruistic P3 Claudettes for example) and I don’t blame the bad choices of a player to the character they play. 
---
I dunno, I just don’t.

Claudette: you either won't see her more than 3 times a match, or she will be the first one to die on the hook.

Makes sense.
---
With Stranger Things, for example, BHVR would have negotiated a deal that allows them to release the DLC on all platforms.
---
But when they negotiated the deal for, say, Saw; the deal would have allowed them to release the content on PC, Xbox One and PS4. They now need to go back to Lionsgate to negotiate a deal that allows them to release the content on Switch and mobile.
---
Everyone was laughing, their voices just can't be heard.

Ruin, BBQ, nurses, Whispers. iron maiden can seem to be a good perk but trust me it isnt. now install a crosshair, learn how to use whispers and have fun getting dem sweet snipes and learning where you can throw through etc
---
Hunters is bae is all I know.
---
Ace = Always a solid teammate to have, doesnt do toxic things and sacrifices himself for hooked survivor instead of leaving
---
100% agree with you. BHVR should be genuinely ashamed of this server. I witnessed multiple cases of uncivil behaviour, racism, harassment and the like and the discord mods did absolutely nothing, even after pinging them. 
---
I still remember how a user got harassed for hours by another dude and people pinged the discord mods like crazy. When one of them finally showed up and asked what's going on, the users got told to "sort it out privately" and that was it.
---
I left the server that day, but I bet it hasn't changed. You're better off joining discord servers from your favourite DbD streamers, sadly.
---
You don't get safe unhook points, but you do get the unhook points. They need to make it so you get no points at all unless it was a safe unhook.
---
The worst are "killers" telling killers how to play an asymmetrical game. One guy sent a novel explaining how NOED and other strategies are not fun for survivors. Bitch, my sole presence in the game as killer is to make it difficult for survivors. I expect survivors to make it difficult for me, too.
---
Late reply but I think you're a little nuts running Overcharge. 
---
I hardly play survivor and run into Overcharge rarely but I thought hitting it isn't THAT difficult as it's effectively slightly larger than DS. 
---
Sure survivors might get caught off guard the very first time they encounter it per-match or when a generator completely regresses (No sparks, but Overcharge is still active when they go to work on it) but after that they seem to hit it pretty consistently.
---
I only find Overcharge good on "Hostage Doc"/3-gen builds (Overcharge, Distressing, Unnerving Presence, and a fourth perk like BBQ, Dying Light, Coulrophobia, Sloppy, Franklin's, Nurses Calling, Pop, or even Fire Up since you're 3-genning and will be at near max potential) as Madness's random skill check placement combined with Unnerving Presence makes Overcharge obnoxiously difficult to hit.
---
Thanks for credit &lt;3
---
sure i would say that is a good thing that is should deactivate when another survivor gets hooked but there in lies the issue. lets say the killer has downed someone and is carrying them to the hook but before they are able to hook said survivor you get unhooked and your ds activates then followed by a deactivation since your pal got hooked. now the killer knowing he waited just enough time for you to get saved can now go for you again essentially tunneling you without repourcussions
---
Hook saving: let's do a 1 for 1
---
honestly thats class
---
*Heavy breathing*
---
Stonks
---
Easy karma-farming? Think they are hot stuff? There are a lot of reasons I guess
---
They used to base Killer ranking on kills. It was called the "Victory Cube", and it SUCKED. If the last Survivor got the hatch, you couldn't double-pip. Also, it did nothing to punish camping and tunnelling. Sure, at top ranks, these things won't result in a win; but they will at low-mid ranks. This encourages gameplay that is not enjoyable for Survivors.
---
Under the Emblem System, camping is actively punished. Tunnelling is indirectly punished because you will not get as many Chaser or Malicious points. This applies at all ranks. As such, Killers are taught early on that these are not ideal playstyles. This is both more fun for Survivors and prepares Killers for high-rank play.
---
Gatekeeper is similar, because ignoring gens in favour of kills will result in a poor Gatekeeper emblem. 
---
With pips requiring more emblem points at higher ranks; it becomes more important to balance chases with protecting gens and to get as many chases and injuries as possible.
---
As for Survivor:
---
There is too much that is out of an individual player's control for a binary "did you live" system to make sense. If you get hooked, you generally need another player to save you. If they don't, and/or the Killer, is camping, you WILL die. You could have done more gens than anyone else and rescued/healed loads of Survivors, but don't rank up due to circumstances out of your control.
---
That's not fair and is just frustrating.
---
I really hope they rework it so that you have to be injured THEN pop the totem+hide in the locker so it's not just an easy insta heal and would give the killer a bit more leeway on finding that survivor
---
Thanks for crediting me :)

This task's an easy one hope to find some engineers toolboxes, engineers toolboxes

oh yeah, you're right. The padded jaws. I forgot about it!

Ahh, the beauty of Dead by Daylight, one day you'll get Baby Hags and Leatherfaces, another day you'll get Toxic Huntresses and Ghostfaces. But whenever a DLC comes out... It's DBD Time!

overused perk is definetly selfcare. it more a hinderance to your team then help most of the time. underused perk would probably be iron will. its a very good perk that flat out counters spirits and counters any killer that is trying to listen to noises from injuries. another overused perk is urban evasion just because i think most of its use is hiding in plain sight rather then hiding when necessary and that makes the game slow down quite a bit
---
Love it. Love everything about it.
---
How did you make this look like a Game Boy Color version of the game?
---
Or newly reset like me xD
---
He needs a full rework. Take away his free hit.
---
Nice
---
Just wake up
---
Wow, that really is disgusting. If BHVR was truly dedicated to stamping out toxic behaviour in the community then this wouldn't even be happening. The fact that they can ban people for misbehaving in post-game chat, but their discord becomes a breeding ground for the exact same behaviour, is ridiculous.
---
Can you explain why you think that it is dumb? I was just giving an advice about a "strategy" that he seems to use and you just pop out and say that it's dumb without giving any explanation
---
Quentin all in all needs a rework and facial rework
---
And plenty of survivors act like all killer mains are campers and tunnelers.
---
it shouldnt be toxic. getting genrushed just means that you as the killer didnt put out any pressure. now to be fair some killer are definetly harder to put out pressure on then other killers but it still is just the lack of pressure that makes genrushing feel bad. also genrushing is jsut survivor doing what they came for.
---
Well you see, that's how you get 4k gg ez. as a killer with little to no effort
---
Just slug lmao
---
ruin is definetly a crutch. if you are a proper killer player you can play killer without ever needing it cause ruin is a bandaid fix you use to gain free pressure. most people would think that crutch means second chances
---
Basically now that Nurse is getting nerfed, survivors have moved on to Spirit. They want what the other side has nerfed. Moris need nerfs too, as do the purple and red add ons. Lets not forget NOED.
---
At which point we end up with a game where 4 man swf with meta perks and instaheals/good toolboxes would literally be unbeatable. Meanwhile survivors also cry about lobby dodging.
---
Look I find Nurse a little cheap sometimes. I fucking HATE Billy. I’d take Nurse or Spirit over Billy anyday. I hate noed and mories too and bullshit like iri heads+infantry belt. However without some nerfs on the survivor side, they cant just nerf everything that killers have.
---
Adrenaline is a reward to survivors for doing their objective.
---
Noed is a reward to killers for losing the game.
---
Compring the two perks doesnt make sense, if there was something that was like noed for survivors it would be more like
---
"A locker at random will light up after the first survivor goes down if no gens are completed within 5 minutes, giving the survivor that went down an extra hit (3) and a 4% speed boost. If at anytime the locker had been searched prior to the survivor being downed this perk wont activate."
---
That perk rewards bad gameplay for survivors and still has the "just search lockers you idiot" argument.
---
IMO Noed isnt strong, its just fundamentally flawed because it punishes survivors for doing their primary objective in a game where time is very limited, and rewards killers for being bad. 
---
Also IMO adrenaline isnt strong either, but it at the very least rewards the person taking it for doing good and not bad.
---
Self care i believe is a wasted perk if taken, because of how slow you heal, but if you only solo qeueu its pretty good just for reliability on yourself and not teammates.
---
Oh fuck thank you
---
I love this!
---
No. No stain, no terror radius, regular survivor-like killer. With no power, but 115% MS. Why not try something like this?
---
Simple, but good, and with counterplay
---
When the Claudette Dude switchs to Ash his Girl will be groovin
---
If its working for you then more power to ya. However I’ve tried it a few times and still been left on the hook to die, or been farmed to death.
---
You need good survivors to make use of the information kindred gives. Potatoes are still gonna be potatoes no matter how much extra information they have.
---
The Plague is the next killer I want to learn too. She looks pretty fun!
---
Lmao
---
I legit learned how to loop lot of things while playing against a good swf team, if you can't adapt to the meta, why even play the game?
---
Becomes a little more than just survive against every other killer.
---
*You blast that shit making the generator completely destroyed and unrepairable*
---
How do you prestige someone?
---
This is a repost
---
Reddit glitched and said this had 0 upvotes before I clicked on the post. Impossible
---
This post was made by the console gang
---
Jk, but her power is really (very) good, I mean, she just ignores a lot of the survivors ways to survive like windows, pallets, loops, etc
---
When they reach level 50, you can activate the node in the middle of the bloodweb to prestige.
---
Yeah, of course it's good. I'm just saying it's not OVERpowered, ie, too much power. Considering that she is literally the only killer survivors arent able to bully if someone that is good is playing her, she is the only killer that is powered the correct amount.
---
Scooby doo did a crossover with Supernatural
---
I've deranked below 15 a few times. NOT via reset but ingame. A few days ago I started playing LF and acted as typical of a LF player as possible in games where no BP offerings were used. (So I wasn't screwing people out of their BP offerings but still deranking)
---
DCing after first pallet stun [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7vl83v/maybe_pallets_are_too_op/?st=jzs8rann&amp;sh=3928d375), DCing after a flashlight save, DCing if we got Haddonfield, DCing after getting DS'd. DCing if I couldn't make it to the basement and the survivor wiggled off, DCing if I went into the basement and the chest was already looted, DCing once the last gen was popped and people teabag at the gate. DCing if ruin is cleansed in under 60 seconds 
---
I hit rank 16 and couldn't go any lower. I went to bed. Next morning I got  up, and my rank is now 17 with two pips.
---
I also recall a few Tapp games a few months ago where I died, and somehow lost pips and eventually deranked to 18.
---
Something is definitely bugged because while there is a "hard cap"  you can't derank below normally, for some reason that isn't always working.
---
I don't think any of the mew killerperks are strong at all but Second Wind will without a doubt not be broken
---
It's really not though. as far as total time it's quicker to heal
---
Big mood
---
Laugh
---
Laugh at the image
---
Or watch the show that has been out for months?
---
For me is like: "Alright, I'm going to be chased by this killer and buy more time for the team to do gens!"
---
&gt;Forget that I don't play survivor a lot and that I am rank 18 so killers facecamp you after beeing chased for more than 4 minutes.
---
*Meanwhile*
---
&gt;Team doesn't do gens because of ruin tier one. One of them is a walking Meg on the corner of the map, the other one is a Claudette crouching on the corner of the map and the last one is a Nea urban evasioning inside the basement
---
Or for the reason I use it: so they can see what the other survivors are doing, and “hopefully” get more gen progression done, rather than all three tryin’ ta unhook me.
---
Exactly
---
The Hag is fun to play, is probably one of the top 5 best killers, and has Ruin. Plus Devour Hope can be fun to run sometimes.
---
Plot twist. The killers try to help repair gems but don’t know how and break them.
---
nobody:
---
my dad when the lawnmower wont start:
---
Literally know like 5 people with 4K-5k hours who agree that spirit should not have collision with survivors in phase. I know you can counter a bad spirit, you just can’t counter a good one.
---
Doctor: this killer desperately needs a huge buff, his power is mediocre as hell and can get destroyed even by decent survivors and has only 1 good perk.
---
Hag: one of the top 5 best killers (sadly, she's really underrated and not many people play her), she's not hard to learn (but please, use traps at loops, don't put all of them around the hooked survivor 'cause that's a guaranteed loss, unless the survivors are complete garbage) and she has, well, i can't say that she has 2 amazing perks since all of them are hexes and i hate all of the hex related perks.
---
go for Hag imo
---
No wonder survivors hate you, you’re too picky.
---
It's a relatable issue since the game does not make it clear what happens after you unlock a perk. When I was new I also assumed that buying a perk from SoS would add the Tier 1 version to my inventory because it was the only logical result in my eyes. I mean, I just bought the perk, I should be able to use it immediately, no? Imagine buying a character or skins in the store and you'd have to level up the respective character first to use them.
---
But I have to agree, I'm proud that there are so many helpful comments in here. Usually the subreddit is not that friendly towards newer players.
---
That situation is fine. If you’re willing to draw the game out and hook slugged survivors then the other team is likely going to lose. If they are genrushing instead of saving and thats the reason you have two people hooked the perk should still activate since you havent completed a chase with anyone in the time since they were unhooked.
---
\#regression 100%
---
Yeah the radius upgrades to 1000M and the stun is permanent
---
Oh I absolutely agree. OP had every right to ask what tf was going on, I'm just glad people were being nice😂
---
**Regression 100%**
---
You won’t lose every game to ds but in games on maps where you need momentum or you lose ds can catch up during a slugfest and end it.
---
Actually it's because I use noed.
---
You know the killer can just kill you instead if they're facecamping
---
I don't understand the cooldown. If you need to wait 25 seconds near someone to gain a token and you need to wait 16 seconds near someone else, what is the reason to also add a cooldown? You would need 71 seconds+the time to find someone and gain a token.
---
Clearly the best video that has ever graced your eyes xxx 🙌🙌😂
---
No fuck that, not sadly. He’s leather face! It makes SENSE that he would lure people into his creepy house with their injured friend just to trap both and kill them brutally. He might not be able to kill more than 1 or 2 people in a game but that’s because he’s not meant too. He’s fucking Bubba. In the old movies he never killed people too much, he was kind of slow and bumbly and he really feels like he plays the part within the game. 
---
Maybe I’m taking this too seriously but I think this is often overlooked.
---
Well, overpowered would mean that her power is strong, overtuned, in a context of a game of tug between survivors and the killer
---
No, she's not OP in that regard, she's utterly broken, allows no counterplay except for rushing, and leaves no room for any proper DbD gameplay at higher ranks.
---
She doesn't need a nerf, she needs a whole rework.
---
Around rank 10
---
And yet every comment, where he asks reasonable questions that aren't well explained in game, he's being downvoted.
---
That’s why you switch at 6 seconds
---
Damn. Oh well, world isn't perfect
---
Congratulations. You’ve just summed up DBD basically
---
The Feddy rework was honestly perfect in terms of balance and making it more true to Feddy's actual character. I think that BHVR is mostly an incompetent studio, but they have some really good ideas sometimes.
---
I’d enjoy a lot more of my 0-kill games if the survivors wouldn’t flashlight and teabag me at every loop and pallet.
---
Would have done the same
---
“nO yOu GoTtA lEt Us AlL eScApE cAuSe WeRe BeTtEr ThAn YoU”
---
Cool, but until either the survivor mechanics are reworked or every other killer gets reworked I think it's fair to have a single killer that is "broken", since every other killer is too weak against survivors to even consider playing. Also lmao, no counterplay. She can be mind tricked, unless you're going up against the best nurses in the game, which are rare. Her high skill ceiling keeps her far away from being broken or OP, as if she was that literally anyone could just pick her up and 4K against anyone in their first game. Its just that the whole game isn't skill based so the one killer that is comes off as OP in comparison.
---
Hag main here and i would highly recommend her. She has amazing hook game and with BBQ and Chili, you can rack up BP fast. Start off by laying a few traps around commonly used places such as your hex totem, doorways without pallets, and long hallways. When you hook a survivor, you can drop a trap in front of them. 9 out of 10 times the rescuer will trigger it immediately. She's small and moves slower but she can provide amazing map pressure if you pay them right. She blends in with the background well on a lot of maps, and is hars for a survivor to track.
---
But that doesn't really put any pressure on the survivors at all due to the fact that their effectiveness relies on the progress of generators. This rework just makes it so that it slows the progress of the survivors a bit better while putting pressure on them
---
Dont come at me like that OP
---
Fuckin preach!!!
---
Although there is a 30 second cooldown on losing tokens, you can still gain tokens while the cooldown is active.
---
I made it so the rate of gaining tokens is slower than losing tokens due to balancing issues. 
---
It's not 71 seconds for debuffing each person, it's 41 seconds for the first cycle, then 30 seconds cooldown, then a debuff, 30 seconds cooldown, another debuff, 30 seconds cooldown, another debuff... and so on and so forth.
---
I chose these numbers so that early game the perk doesn't have much of an impact. However, if you work well as a team and stay together then mid-late game you are guarenteed to have tokens at a faster rate than the cooldown. So
---
Remove quintin and give us Nancy
---
Yeah honestly. A few days ago I thought about how shitty the game looks from a graphics and assets as well as lighting and textures perspective. Any other game today would get shredded for that kind of lack of polish, but this game just has SO MANY OTHER issues that graphics don't even come to mind.
---
This is why unless I know where the last survivor definitely is, I tend to slug the second to last and go looking. It doesn't seem fair that I can play a perfect game and yet a survivor who has done nothing can just wait at the hatch or happen to stumble across it because their more active teammates died.
---
Comment on the vid and then maybe she’ll make us twerky billy. She hasn’t made DBD vids in a while though I don’t think  xxx 🙌😭🙏
---
We would have 2 Nancy's then.
---
no it is only rumored to be happening on the 27th
---
I 4k consistently with Hag, Spirit, Trapper, Ghostface and even Wraith and Clown at red ranks. Only exceptions are insane SWF rushing gens. You're not supposed to 4k every single game vs the creme of the crop, and that's a thing only Nurses do.
---
This made my day
---
Wow you watch Space Coconut you must be so good!
---
It's not like hag doesn't have any hard counter
---
I don't want to 4k every game, I want to be able to not feel like I'm powerless against survivors.
---
So you play like this and think it’s ok?
---
Ya I put 50 hours on pc before this has happened. It’s so frustrating!! I’ll try that thanks !
---
I swear to god humans are weird
---
I hate that i can't edit the caption lol
---
New street fighter looking cool
---
Same. You can only get hitbox'd so many times before you just quit. If they ever address hitboxes I might come back, probably not though, the devs seem occupied with dlcs and not fixing their game.
---
Those ranks! Congrats on out a team with a rank 10, 8 and 3! Was it difficult?
---
I always give shirtless David king hatch. Only if he twerks.
---
Photographer would be perfect
---
First one sounds cool, but impractical for the maps. There would be so much pressure it’d be crazy.
---
Because there are things you can't fix in a client-based peer-to-peer game.
---
Also, there NEEDS to be a cap so you can't just collect god knows how many bloodpoints and p3fullperk every new killer as it comes out.
---
with a cap, there won't ever be a bloodpoint inflation.
---
and then the last one dc's so the achievement doesn't count
---
i fucking hate that cuz i've been trying to do that achievement like 2 days ago and im still trying to get it
---
you unlocked the ability to find it in the bloodweb
---
Face camping a basement hook as a Trapper... Lmao.
---
The counter play to NOED is just dumb.
---
law of equal exchange
---
I got this by pure luck last week. 
---
Was in a match with a bunch of morons. Just hook swapping all day. I got injured and hooked/unhooked fairly early on, before I understood my teammates were useless. So I go off and do generators. Whenever one finished, Hillbilly would vroom across the cornfield to chase me for awhile, but he never caught me again.
---
Eventually, two people are dead and there are two generators left. The match had been going on for *awhile* at this point. As I'm heading for a generator, I notice a teammate in a corner of the map where I god damn know generators don't live. And he was just chilling over there, making me do all the work. So it's no surprise when, after starting on the 2nd to last gen, Billy comes tear-assing across the universe to stick his chainsaw up my butt.
---
I lead him on a fairly long chase, but he's committed at this point and sticks with me until he downs me. But instead of carrying me to a hook, he carries me to the generator I was on and just starts M1ing it. Or... RTing it, whichever you say for console. I'm briefly confused, because I wonder if he's new and didn't know you can't kick while carrying. But he keeps doing it as I'm struggling, and after struggling off, I pause in front of him then resume working the generator. He nods, then turns and Speed Racers away. 
---
My heart was pounding at that point, but I figure either the killer felt bad for me because my team were a bunch of turds, or he considered me a worthy enough rival to let me go, since I'd spent like 90% of the round injured thanks to bad luck and greedy teammates. So I pop the generator and he comes back over. 
---
On a damn hunch, I turn and point to the corner I'd last seen my teammate in, because that motherfucker still hadn't done a generator or made a peep in all this time. Billy turns, revs up, and off he goes as I head to another generator in the field. Before I even reach it, he finds and downs my cowardly teammate and hooks him. At that point I was like oh shit, I might get a really hard trophy, and he comes over to smack the other side of the generator as I hit my skill checks. Other guy dies, I pop the generator and point to the exit gate I'm gonna head for.
---
At that point, I'm wondering if he's toying with me and plans to down me at the gate. But no. He speeds over to it and then starts doing donuts in the field as I get the gate and escape. Boom. Left For Dead get. I messaged the guy after, thanking him and apologizing for my team being a bunch of dumbasses. He laughed it off and we parted ways. 
---
I'm surprised I didn't get anyone PMing me bitching about me working with the killer. It just kinda happened that way, and I was really pissed off at the useless other guy for making me continue to do all the work. I regret nothing.
---
I wish they just made it a game mechanic instead of a perk. Especially if it still worked with Open Handed so that it may be viable.
---
They're making servers for it anyways so p2p wobt be the problem anymor at least
---
It was nerve-racking to be sure. The bloody claudette kept teabagging when I wouldn't fall for her flashlight or pallet shenanigans. So, considering she was my final hook I teabagged back until she got ate. I was really worried when I ran out of traps! But, I got it in the end.
---
but it is now and that's why I mentioned it.
---
Also, the second part of the reply was more important.
---
**Save the best for last.**
---
Or, your team is shit
---
Thats true, then the key should probably spawn in one of three of the furthest generators. If the generator is about to be completed, then theyll either have to go for another generator to deplete or find a nearby survivor

In return, BNP also gets buffed.

*When installing a Brand New Part, hit two tremendously easy skillchecks to repair the generator instantly. If one or both skillchecks are failed, cause a short circuit. When the killer kicks a short-circuited generator, they are immediately put in the dying state and can be killed.*

That's definitely an extra 20% regression .

What a way to ruin your game
---
Same here, the issues are never addressed and the core gameplay has never been changed. It's just unfun to bring myself to play when the only time anything unique happens is dlc
---
Tbh, i have no idea, ill have to look at her add-ons again to see what to rework
---
The game is toxic, not the players, the game design is pure and utter trash.
---
YOUR fun, should not rely on other players, and YOU shouldn't be the one responsible for other players in the game to have fun.
---
BHVR has amazing artists that put so much work into the characters, but the guys who are responsible for gameplay, balancing as well as the programmers... welp honestly I don't know what they get paid for.
---
I gotta give one thing to them though, it takes A LOT to make a game feel unfair and frustrating to everyone equally, that's one hell of an achievement.
---
Tell it to Bubba
---
See there is the problem. "The rest" is so underpowered that you see Nurse as OP just because she isn't. In how the game currently works, with how survivor sided it is, she is the only one viable once survivors get their shit together. Its not OP, its the only thing that is correctly powered for what she is supposed to be, which is a skill based powerrole in a ONE v FOUR, in this really badly executed and designed game.
---
I mean, shes a pretty weak killer in general. Her only saving grace is her crouch and even then its alright. This rework should make her power a bit stronger, but shell still have a limited amount of traps
---
Laughs in BT + We'll Make it (and babysitter soon)
---
Power of the Herman compells you.
---
As long as information can be communicated, even purely- in game, such as auras, making kindred base and other ways like more gestures, more ways to tell each other "hey that's a myer's I'm looking at, you're feeding him EW" from across the map, communicate strategies even at a baseline level and as long as survivors can see what perks/loadouts they have in lobby, it's fine, and we can actually buff killers to deal with all of this shit.
---
Also, you are already "always" losing on solo compared to SWF.1
---
It won't be as strong as pure SWF, no, but it has no reason to kill solo experience... For me, solo survivor is already dead because of the advantage SWF currently has. A big part of it is why should I choose to actively gimp myself when I play solo and have esentially a luck-of-the-draw gamble card for my teammates (especially at the lower ranks when I don't play for a couple of months and go back to rank 15...) when I can have a much more fulfilling, fun experience with friends? We just need to get over the information barrier that solo and survivors have. The rest can be adjusted by small means, perhaps by point gains or whatever.
---
Sorry if I'm rambling, but I honestly think that instead of doing nothing, they should at least try a few ideas instead of leaving the current system.
---
I love this fan style! Please tell me there will be more!

Technically, we already have mr. methane from britain's got talent

They should also rework left behind and noone left behind. For the latter, I think it would be interesting if it could increase the EGC timer.

---
I think it's overcomplicated. Doesn't feel like it'd be fun to play against.
---
Photoshoot gone wrong?
---
I'm sorry, but I don't see your opinion as valid. if you want Nurse to be the base power level, let me introduce you to Deathgarden.
---
This game is not balanced around Nurse and luckily never will. Hillbilly is the BALANCED killer. Nurse and Spirit are overpowered, the rest is underpowered. What makes my opinion more valid than yours? Nothing. but it's a view that's shared by the majority and is the closest to what the devs think.
---
The fact tho is, that Nurse is too strong for the current balance of the game, so she IS overpowered.
---
Are the killers legs turning elastic again?
---
Devs want you to spend your points, not accumulate milions of it. That would make it so you don't really have to play much when the next DLC releases. When making the game, you make it so people have a reason to play. Removing the cap totally would only remove it.
---
&gt;If you are skilled with Nurse or Billy
---
Billy? He is a good killer but has counterplay and you can actually stand a chance if you are good enough, unlike spirit that anyone can play as and do well
---
Swfs often pick the maps. If you're planning on playing a lower tier killer you might want to avoid being insta-depipped.
---
There are still combinations of maps, items, and killers that are a guaranteed 5 minute 4man-escape. Loops are extremely strong on some maps and if there's no weak link in the team you won't finish a chase without losing a gen. 
---
These teams plan to go against sweaty campers so they will always wait until the last second to BT unhook. This means 2 hooks can easily mean 2-3 gens even when you're not camping.
---
Remember that it's only 44 seconds for 2 people to knock out a gen with no tool kit and no great skill checks; there are maps that have 1 minute chase minimums. If you move off the chase they'll let their team know which gen you're going to and you wont even get a chance to get them out of position.
---
SWFs aren't broken, but 14/16 killers are too weak on most maps to match them. Most maps are extremely forgiving in pallet placements and 4 good survivors. This is a weak killer/bad map problem more than a strong survivor problem. As long as survivors have near endless easy loops then M1 killers are guaranteed a loss on those maps.
---
Loops are silly sometimes, let leather face break the damn picket fence already lol
---
Oml whoever made this joke is hilarious
---
Bruh I just say kek because lol is old and overused imo.

AoE is not a word specifically for MMOs. You can use it literally everywhere, damn. And Leatherface's chainsaw HAS an area of effect around him. You are allowed to see yourself out.

and thats why i hate facing 4man swf. you either go in with a fun killer trying to meme around with a grp of friends (i love me some backpack killer\^\^) and get absolutly destroyed by the most tryhard team with 2k+ hours each and apparently military training by the entity itself or you feel bad because you had a couple of those matches previously, so you slap on your stacked spirit to teach those pesky swf grps a lesson and it turns out you just went all out on some goofers that just try some hilarious stuff like 4 man chain head ons. but whatever you do, you never get the setup right with the survivors\^\^
---
Random crits in DbD? Pls no
---
Hi I’m still here :)
---
I dont think any killer is fun to play against lmao but youre welcome to your own opinion
---
Not really. And lmao, bringing up Deathgarden does not help your opinion. Also people have realized that Hillbilly isn't actually all that good aside from his mobility. He still gets looped to shit super easily by any survivor that knows what they're doing. The only reason your opinions is shared by the majority is that there are 4 times the survivor players than there are killer players at any point. Thats also the only reason the devs listen to you.
---
It's obviously diggin' that metal hard!
---
JUDO KICK-U!
---
The thing is why that makes more sense if you wanna go based off the movies it lends itself to horrid gameplay design for both the killer and going against the killer. Even though you probably shouldn't go down to leatherface tbh it isn't really fun to just get faced camped cause he's extremely weak in a Chase his power is pretty much made for it. Imo he honestly just needs a redesign or buffs or something cause he just isn't good or fun.
---
"He still gets looped"
---
Looping and the chases is the gameplay loop the game is based on and you want to throw it out of the window.
---
also, bold of you to assume I'm a in the "Survivor Mains" group. most of the time I'm being called a "Salty Killer Main". This "us" vs "them" mentality is fucking stupid. I'm not a part of any group. I play both sides like most of people in this game.
---
Well GF can teabag so if he gets disrespected, he disrespects back.
---
How? A good trapper can kill any team, same with Billy, doctor, and spirit. It's all about the killers playstyle. I think nurse is a strong killer because she is easy to play.
---
If you're rating the Pig alongside those other two you probably don't play her well.
---
Are you me but at rank 10 🤔
---
Even with my Kindred 3/Open Hand Combo on the hook they are terrified to help and I die on my 1st hook.
---
I understand where people are coming from, but Jesus the community wants stranger things ptb , dedicated servers, people are complaining about a bp cap, and big fixes there’s only so much things they can do and I’m prepared to be downvoted to hell and absolutely be obliterated in the comments.
---
u r joking right? 
---
the pervious post was all about that the newer survivors sound extremely loud while injured and u want the elite 5 to sound the same? 
---
lmao and u r a claudette (survivor) main? bulsh*
---
how about tone a bit down the injured sounds of the newer survivors...no need to nerf the survivors even more....
---
cant believe killer mains anymore
---
stop making the game unpleasant for the survivors....or u will be searching for a lobby for quite a while...
---
✌🏻
---
Then those survivors messed up. I'm not saying it's impossible to kill people cause bads exists but if it's 4 survivors that aren't braindead a LF is just gonna get bullied.
---
Dude gave me a heart attack on three separate occasions in a single game today. The last one was after I finished opening the exit gate and he came out of left field when I intended to go look for the other door since I figured my teammates were being chased by him. Don't think he realized since he suddenly stopped stalking and went for a smack
---
Keep in mind, when you Prestige, you loose ALL inventory and start from scratch. Your teachables are the only thing you keep in that those will still be available to other survivors/killers.  You do get special costume items that actually make your clothing darker and a bit harder to see.
---
Also my teammates righta fter I unkook them with We'll make it
---
I've noticed that ultra settings just creates more visual noise for both sides of the match.  To me the fault isn't that the graphics are \*bad,\* but rather that they lack any polish beyond "add lots of effects to the screen, and make it darker than a womb."
---
Spirit is #3. There's no way Spirit outperforms the tremendous map pressure and killing potential of Billy and Nurse. That's just not how that works.
---
Lmao, doctor and trapper. Nurse is not easy to play, have you ever even tried? It's hard as fuck to properly predict where survivors will go, charge up your blink to the correct distance and then not get fucked over by auto-aim, especially on console. And no, Trappers, Billy and doctors will get run around and humiliated by good teams, or even just good solo-survivors.
---
And Clown, and doctor...
---
I wish there was a perk where instead of just kicking it, the killer runs up and fucking drop kicks it.
---
ngl I have 750 hours, I've used kindred about 50 times about half the time I go into struggle on first hook sometimes even die on second hook, people just prefer to crouch in corners and self care
---
True, although I think hangman’s isn’t necessarily bad, just so situational it’s nearly useless
---
Hot take: perhaps it's YOU that isn't good at the game, not literally every killer except Omega blink nurse
---
You edited so it says rank, and better rank means better teamates/killers which means more bloodpoints which means more perks.
---
I swear every time when my team are teabaggers and I'm also active with the killer. I get to live. Not sure if it's pity yet
---
Baby killers in a nutshell
---
I also have a question , if I get bbq&amp;chili from the shop, does it appear on all killers or just one ?
---
Honestly a lot of the time it depends on the friends I'm playing with, If I play with some of my better friends (1500+ hours) then its very much just we do the things without even trying and we just fuck around a meme. If I play with friends 100-400 hours its a lot more serious but also not try hardy as well idk how to describe it but I def play differently depending on who I play with
---
Holy shit, I didn't know. Turns out I have Claudetteface. Thank you for pointing that out.
---
Inner strength won't become meta
---
Dude runs small game inner strength
---
I honestly feel it's pure RNG. You can look directly at ghost face, but if he's leaning, even if his entire body is in the center of your screen, you somehow still can't reveal him, but then if you play him, you get detected from the entire map away
---
it's not a matter of being strong or not and anyone who actually bothers to flame and tilt over noed should chill but it is kinda just annoying to go all game doing well managing to survive every chase without getting fucked up the ass and hooked and then all of a sudden bang the noed procs, you die on first hook since everyone just checks the fuck out. NOED is just boring as shit to play against and being forced to do 5 totems with a pack of randoms for a perk that may or may not even be ran is just fucking frustrating when you have chimps sprinting around with no spacial awarness.
---
I accidentally exposed him at some point without even knowing he was there. Then today, I was 5 feet away with his entire body on my screen, character facing him(I even walked closer. I was wounded. His stalk did jackshit). Still couldn't reveal him
---
No problem I didnt know about it for a while either because he's licensed so I just assumed he wouldnt get different cosmetics.
---
They aren't cheating, crying baby. BHVR already said using discord isnt cheating, same as using the fucking built in party chat on Xbox/PS4.
---
You're playing minecraft, dbd AND wow? Are you even real?
---
If killers were more powerful then yea I’d stay with this game but naw Killers are underpowered as hell.
---
Friday the 13th makes the killer at least scary in the sense that he can end you instantly
---
Without having seen it in gameplay, the way the perk descriptions read would suggest multiple uses in a single game.
---
Can't confirm at this time, but that's what it seems like.
---
Always check there so dunno wtf your on about
---
Ppl wtf are you talking about? Assholes and nice persons are everywhere. Deal with it. You just got unlucky with some british ppl which do not represent the entire british community. Stop making nonsense assumptions.
---
If that's the case then I think spirit should br able to phase through walls and pallets !!1!
---
It's even better when they don't move, you think they're recovering, go to pick up them up and it's 0 progress. Are you trying to die???
---
I dunno man dude would probably try to take my fingers while you are drunk and suck em down right in front of you
---
It’s not that they have to rework Legion, it’s that they have to rework deep wounds/mending. As it currently stands, deep wounds is an inconsequential status affliction such that the outcomes are usually (1) the killer ignores the survivor and they just mend, or (2) the killer tunnels you and the deep wounds isn’t really different from being injured. One thing they could change it to is having it so that deep wounds will randomly trigger a healing injury, and increases frequency per deep wound stack. They could also make it where mending can only be done either outside of the terror radius or by teammates. Or they could make it where Legion receives buffs based on the number of survivors with deep wounds. In other words, they could be a lot more imaginative with their handling of this killer.
---
Unfortunately. Existence is pain.

Yeah I feel you, unless it's a Billy or some shit the I'mma just look for the hatch
---
You know, forgot about swf. But in all fairness they ruin everything.
---
lol every night i hover over the game and then i’ll look for the smallest inconvenience so i can say “aw man, guess i’ll just have to play tomorrow!”
---
I got it on my first game as bill so it’s not impossible to get you people just can’t get it.
---
When you play fairly so people abuse that and t-bag you and every chance they get because they view a fair killer as a bad one for ignoring the unhooked survivor so I get 1 kill before they gen rush all 5 gens because ruin was broken 1 minute into the game. So I open an exit gate and chase a survivor for about 1 minute and a half then hook them to activate bloodwarden and kill the other 2 cocky survivors instantly with the EGC even though they were already dead on hook.

Does end game collapse trigger rbts?  Also, where would a key spawn if there's no generators, and no survivors?

Wrong reply button my bad.
---
I like this idea a lot as it fits the spirit of Saw, which is to say escaping a trap has consequences. It's not meant to be a walk in the park. Removing traps being at the cost of gen progress or another Survivor's health state is a great idea to really put the pressure on with Miss Piggy. The current system is terrible ever since she got brutally nerfed. The heck is this about traps being safe until a gen pops? It's way too safe. I enjoyed crying as I dashed across the map before as the timer ominously counted down. There was a thrill. Now it's just a case of, "hey, guys, 99% all the gens so I can safely get this trap off." I think the traps should cause either the Broken, Mangled and Haemorrhaged, OR Exhausted status as well. Not all of them as it'd be damn overkill but something that says to wear those traps will mean you're not an ideal state until they're moved. Right now her power doesn't represent what the Saw traps are actually like. Where's the anxiety? The stress? The pressure? Fighting for your life?

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cvnrr3/anyone_else_hopes_the_next_chapter_would_be/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I swear it happens too much, and a meh who had we’ll make it unhooked me and sprint bursted away even though the killer wasn’t close
---
You play legion and ghostface and its the survivors who are toxic?
---
Most survivors tend to instantly run up with Bt now because most killers dont leave the hook. In 9 out of 10 games if you dont have BT then you dont get unhooks.
---
Yeah I have no idea how you would think this nerfs NOED really, especially since you can only bank 1 heal at a time. How does one relay to survivor mains that NOED is not the bad design when it comes to killers?
---
That is the worst, when all 3 are on one gen
---
Tru3 bad
---
Or make it so that there is no cool down for WoO, make it so head on shows you locker locations, and obv buff nurse
---
No, because then we'd go back to how exhaustion was 2 years ago and that was horrible to play against.
---
Someone actually put effort to draw that just think about that
---
Make the Bleach and Pinky Finger add-ons base? Yeah, I'd agree. Without the Bleach they are not slowed down enough and if they have Dead Hard then you're fucked. Anyone who cries that Pinky Finger is OP has never tried using Clown with the add-on at red ranks. The instant they know you have that add-on they'll be doing all kinds of crazy movement just like against Billy. Furthermore, you can't instant down if they're anywhere near a window or pallet. 
---
My only other suggestion would be that the gas forces them to slow vault, especially pallets. I'd love to see the same thing for Freddy and his snares (either that or he starts the match with full teleport power).
---
Pretty much. It was a cash grab and nothing more.
---
That's why I run whispers. You almost always know if a survivor is near an exit gate during endgame
---
They are using assets outside of the games mechanics ? Like voice coms ?
---
so a better pig?
---
I don't really want to turn this into an "us vs them" conversation but sprint burst has a cooldown and is triggered any time a person runs which means they either waste it or waste time by normal walking and adrenaline is only useful in some matches and only triggers once. Both sides bitch about the other person doing things they don't like. Both sides have their entitled pricks. Not just killers and not just survivors.
---
Actually you just reminded me of an idea, if the survivor is intoxicated, their pallet vault speed is slowed (like the legions). Also, the gas should absolutely force medium vaults. It's pretty dumb that snares do but the bottles don't
---
To make it simpler, I would just buff the timer reduction on any time related debuffs and also just reduce the severity of debuffs on "set" debuffs.
---
People tend to be more toxic against GF because nobody likes him. He’s broken AF right now in that the reveal mechanic is so wonky. Often you’ll stare at him dead on when hes only meters from you and....nothing. This frustration often boils up all game and survivors release it at the end.
---
Also make sure you’re not camping. Every single GF i’ve seen since release just camps hooks while cloaked. This is sure to generate toxicity post game
---
I hate this it happens so much, my idiot David swf teamate has a key and wasted 5 minutes because he kept misinterpreting instructions on where to find the hatch and then he took like 4 seconds to finally open it and huntress closed and and No Ed me

I play both sides roughly equally tho
---
we have Bill already
---
&gt;Instead of survivors searching jigsaw boxes for the key, they will have to search generators and other survivors in order to find the key.
---
It would be cool but it would never happen. The devs accidentally make strong killers (re-work Freddy might be the sole exception and we'll see about Demogorgon) and never want to make something challenging for survivors. An alternative would be that the key comes in two pieces and will be in two boxes they have to check. It might require a nerf to the Tampered Timer especially if Ruleset no.2 becomes base but the Pig really needs buffs.
---
For acid blood, I was thinking of giving them the Broken effect, or give them the mending effect or whatever it is.
---
Ran a game yesterday with Mint Rag (teleport anywhere to a trap), Devour (duh), Rusty Shackles (No indication trap has activated), Ruin (duh), and Thrill of the Hunt (notification when a totem is being worked on). Probably the nastiest build I've ever run, nobody could get after a totem and once I got 3 stacks of Devour it was gg.
---
If you read what I answered to the other guy I also said that missed hit after a pallet stun should not count, missed hit after dead hard should not count as well cause the combo dead hard + mom would be too strong. And I also said I would increase the amount of stack needed to at least 4. Now a good killer at a decent rank doesn't miss 4 hits on each survivor every match! So in some match mom would just be a dead perk for someone, but for sure I think it's a lot better than the pre nerf.
---
I think [mines](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a8nr4p/legion_mask_i_made/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) okay.
---
When that achievement show up? Because I swear I had never seen it before and then it popped up with 1%  I have been playing this game long enough that bar should be higher. Is the game just not able to count towatds it correctly?
---
Quick time event. Like skill checks or the entirety of Detroit: Becoming Human.
---
So... i was gonna ask if Legion is worth playing cause i'm new to the game and he/she seems interesting and kinda fun running around but i guess not... yet... ?
---
I truly miss this bug. Always gave me a good laugh!
---
Guess im a low level red rank lol.

More like 43% at rank 1.

it is tho kinda like "is their a pallet over here?" and if theres not and you guess wrong you die

---
The male survivors always feel clunky and awkward to me while maneuvering around but I think it's because I'm so used to playing Nea
---
I still love playing current legion too, the only problem is that he sucks. He may be my main but god damn he sucks
---
Is this a guess?
---
Wraith is easy to see. Also I’m survivor main and even tho killers camping is annoying.... it’s still allowed in the game. And not worth bitching over. Because survivors do “annoying/bad” things too anyway. It’s a childish “he did this first!” Between survivor and killer. Then both end up tattling on Reddit over stupid little crap like camping when it’s a tactic that’s allowed. Funny how dbd is like tag/hide and seek and even the older / mature players/gamers are still acting like children to this day just because they are “it” (killer) and the survivors are evading them because that’s the purpose of the game and doing gems and killer has to stop them
---
Probably for the best
---
Ok well like the idea, just feel like some things would need tweaking
---
Honestly, i think as long as survivors get some sort of consequence for removing a trap, id be happyb cause it isnt fun to play as pig imo
---
Imo leather face isn’t as bad as people say. He is for sure second lowest but at least he can isnta down and really punish survivors out of position.

Why is THAT downvote?

Dying for the right cause is the most human thing we can do.
---
What I see in the op is 3 kills, 1 escape, and low points across the board. You say they weren't playing well, yet they still killed 3 survivors. You say the reason they didn't play well is because of how quickly they killed those 3 thanks to the addons used. How is this not a design failure? 
---
The addons don't require you to do a lap around the map every time you down a survivor before you kill them.  The addons don't require you to kick 8 gens. If using a particular set of addons makes the game so short that it negatively impacts the players scores compared to when those addons are not used, that's a game design problem.
---
If you're playing on console it released recently when Bill did. If you're on PC it's been out for years iirc.
---
I agree, it isnt perfect at all, but i figured it would be a nice start and create some discussion
---
I'm mostly red rank so I dont run into this but on rank reset I'll run into some potatoe killers that will face camp which is why on rank reset I only play swf. just tell em to rush gens and get out quick so we can move on a d killer gets no blood points.
---
I mean, against decent survivors he is literally a m1 killer. At least legion can get a first hit easily and stall the game a bit.
---
When I rarely see a Quentin they're either gods, or think they're way better than they really are and are toxic as fuck when they inevitably die (especially if they're P3)
---
Ok hear me out.
---
I am getting so angry facing killers because I die like every game, I think I'm pretty ok at the game, I can hit my greats, play stealthy but hold a chase and can occasionally 360, but the problem is the balancing isnt good. Killers at rank 1 have hard times even getting 1 kill meanwhile me, a rank 20 killer and survivor main gets a 4k like every match. I think they should add a skill ceiling sort of thing like they did with survivors to make the game more balanced and fun for every rank and so every game has a 50 50 chance of survivor or killer getting out. I know this is going to need a massive rework. I can wait.
---
Do we know the demogorgons abilities and speed yet?

You are a special type of asshole
---
*Hag pounces the generator and eats its wires*
---
Well Steve honestly looks skinny and not as bulky and clunky like Ash or David for example and as someone that plays exclusively males when I switch to female survivors they look way faster but idk I just like the male characters more.
---
I do recommend getting him if you’re less competitive or don’t mind losing. Besides how bad he is he is still very fun to play. He also comes with a perk called discordance which is incredibly good. Just be mindful that he can be very frustrating sometimes and a low tier killer for a reason :D
---
Last I checked dbd wasn’t that skill intensive to begin with, mainly centered around mind gaming and decision making. God forbid they give a character more ways to mind game instead of subjecting survivors to the same boring looping from every other killer besides nurse.
---
She functions similar to a pre history home sapien. By that logic they were all pedophiles.
---
Nope, if he is camping the hook while cloaked and standing still, he is literally invisible
---
As if I wasn't already running Bond and watched that Blendette drop the shack pallet 30 seconds into the game, get hit through it, get pulled down to the basement, then proceed to go to struggle trying to escape the hook.
---
I cry everytime.
---
Thats why I always run DS.
---
i got it im just confused is all thanks
---
Are you sure you didn’t get it from shrine?
---
*Not only are you wrong, you're stupid*
---
im a filthy hag main
---
I commend your self reflection.
---
Nope, because undetectable also means you have no red stain,
---
Not gonna judge based on that. I saw the killer pass you. Chances are they saw him camping and made the boring but reasonable decision to do gens. I.e. used your perk for the purpose it was made.
---
I hear the one on the right was awful but since they changed the formula, it's one of the best cookies out of all of them.
---
Agreed. And thats why her addons are getting a rework.
---
NOED is useless. Everyone knows that. Why are people making this a thing?
---
This would be good, if that guaranteed down would not have taken almost all match. If you used the power you had to hit the survivor 5 times to down one. Thus the idea was letting the timer tick down while following the survivor (achieved by looking at the ground/walking backwards) and following the grunts and blood.
---
It should be pretty obvious that, yeah you get a guaranteed down, but the gens are finished before you could even think about a third hook.
---
I think it is just the lighting in this one
---
Great "No U" argument
---
Yeah but if they do nothing the whole match they don't get any BP
---
I ran the same thing yesterday exactly.  It is so satisfying to get that third stack because they won't know what happened until they're down.  Sometimes I don't go for ruin to prevent them from searching for totems.
---
It's not them. You're just choosing to head in the wrong direction … again.
---
Thank you.
---
But safe pallets shutting down mind games is okay, amirite?
---
In my case, I loop for 5 minutes and no gens get done
---
Killer version:
---
"Alright, going to be a terrifying killer who brutally kills people"
---
*Isn't taken seriously the whole match, later gets blamed for trying to kill them*
---
Because it's fairly consistent.
---
Would be better. Would give more use to lesser perks, rather than right bow where everyone takes perks that can massively change the outcome of the game.
---
This like when you're a kid and they say make up a superpower and there's that one kid
---
I think you mean David
---
I really believe empathy is a better perk over bond. most people in higher ranks aren't running self care and will likely be injured, and if someone is being chased eventually they'll become injured. so you can see someone up to 120-something meters away while bond is limited to 36m(?). It makes it really strong to see what your team is doing, who needs healing, and if someone is being chased from a great deal away.
---
SUBALUWA
---
What about when the survivor just kills themselves because they dont want to just sit on hook for the next two minutes after waiting five for the game. Plus it's just not fun for anyone to play a skill check simulator.
---
Closing game derank to 20.
---
This is going to be me in September. 
---
"Boy Demogorgan's ability doesn't seem THAT bad in a chase."
---
*plays game*
---
'What the fuck this ability is useless survivors glue themselves to loops and never run in straight lines to pounce at. What the fuck was I thinking that this killer would be about to pounce anyone above rank 15?"
---
I just know it. Unless Demo has amazing move speed and can get people away from the loop his pounce is going to be useless.  In most of my games all my hits come from either mind gaming a person or lunging from around a corner.
---
Remember me got a massive nerf on the endgame collapse update and it's no longer that good. Also, remember me actually needs the killer to be somewhat competent because they need to hit the obsession to get stacks, so bad killers bring NOED instead because it rewards lesser skilled players.
---
I don't even think I need to comment on how broken this is.
---
It would immediately be a top tier perk for just two reasons.
---
1. It guarantees a higher quality item than any other perk in the game AND you start with it, you don't even have to find it.
---
2. It would be the only perk in the game to let you know the killers location 100% of the time when they are in a chase. (A.K.A. Occupied and unable to pressure you)
---
Main questions: Who will decide how much a perk costs? Will a perk cost same for different killers?
---
Dont you mean "Hatcheting" a plan ;D
---
''Did you do it?"  
---
''Yes''  
---
''What did it cost?''  
---
"Everything..''
---
Agreed. Hate the males.
---
I always wondered why they also didn't make vigil a better distortion - reduce the time of auras by 20% too
---
but yeah I like this idea and I just want vigil to be changed it's been over a year since it's use has become... undervalued.
---
Both those perks have tremendous utility against all killers, they're just especially effective against Spirit because her power relies so much on audio (the noises you make when injured) and mindgames (standing still at a pallet hoping you'll climb right over to her).
---
yes
---
Actually, I think that’s a cool idea and didn’t think of it. Although a lot of people wouldn’t like it, it would allow killers/survivors to be pushed towards their playstyle. Maybe teachables cost more on other characters, and the charater’s own perks are a little bit cheaper.
---
I don't like him either
---
But Chonkface is kinda hot
---
I agree but like I told a couple other people it's just not fun to sit there and do gens a whole game especially when you have been waiting five plus minutes on a lobby only to get a killer that camps and doesn't want to just play the game. They are so worried about getting a kill nowadays like take the loss and go into the next game. And if anyone is wondering yes I do play killer (mostly huntress) and sometimes I get shit on especially since I turned up my sensitivity for billy but I dont facecamp or be a back to the hook game because it's just not fun
---
this is the secret sauce
---
I wonder if it’ll appear in other blood webs then
---
Thanks! That's awesome advice because I tend to prioritize stalking a little bit for that insta down.
---
Basically this. Nothing good would come out of a perk like that.
---
I don’t think she should have collision with survivors while phasing, never said anything about other objects
---
because when they drop a new DLC they want people to gather around and play it, not instantly unlock everything, play one game, decide, that the game still sucks and leave
---
Thanks for the advice! You're the second person to say nurses calling is good on him, so I'll definitely be giving that a shot!
---
I’m probably taking this post down because everyone is misconstruing it
---
They cant remove swf and the game will never be balanced if they didnt do something like that. They have to.
---
At least Nurse is safe
---
True enough, especially since the older killers perks are generally kinda shitty, but usually the ability helps more if the perks are weak (to my memory at least :p)
---
But otherwise I think the global perks could be the same price, or maybe something like categories, think something like Pig getting reduced price on stealth perks, or Hillbilly getting a reduced price on perks that work off of terror radius
---
Yes. I kept leaving matches and -2 pipping. (I usually left at the end if people used BP offerings so they still got to play out the match and earned their BP, otherwise I'd leave as soon as the mildest "inconvenience" happened like being pallet stunned once like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7vl83v/maybe_pallets_are_too_op/?st=jzsgx5g8&amp;sh=65b47ab7), ruin gone in the first 30 seconds, I get DS'd, we got Haddonfield, etc.) At one point I left a few at 16 no pips and couldn't seem to derank any lower. Went to bed. Woke up next morning and was greeted by being rank 17 2 pips. 
---
I also recall a few games as Tapp a few months ago where I somehow depipped to rank 17. I didn't DC.
---
This was me going after the last guy, I felt bad cause the survivors were not experienced, a 19 meg just stood there while I stalked her lol... and let’s say she helped me get dying light
---
God some people here are disgusting.
---
I've found other ways, probably will post it the day after tomorrow ;)
---
&gt;Flashlights are also the strongest item in the game in the right hands.
---
I'll have to disagree with you there, flashlights nowadays are useless against any decent killer, want to pallet blind? They will just hear your footsteps/moaning. Want to flashlight save? They will fake to save to hit you and face the other way, or even face a wall.
---
How would it function with noed or other hexes?
---
Does cursed count as a debuff as they're not set on a specific survivor?
---
Does it just completely remove all hexes from the game? If yes, it is bullshit, if not it's fine but needs to specify that detail.
---
No it doesnt. Stealth is for sneeking up on survivors to get the first hit
---
The fact that they still havent announced that is making it seem less likely sadly.
---
 [https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-fallacy-fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-fallacy-fallacy)
---
Bad idea, but it may be okay if didnt have the flashlight thing. I mean, that perk is already pretty much included if you are in a SWF team.
---
I wonder if people will ever stop posting this idiotic comment under every huntress post.
---
StAaAlp...
---
nurse is not op.. 
---
game is unbalanced.. nurse is indeed strong but not op
---
I know all this. I play both games a lot myself. Look at this that way.
---
Why did they even make Deathgarden? Why didn't they just edit DBD to be like that? 
---
Because that would kill the game. Those are too drastic changes to be made when the game was being played one way for over three years.
---
You can't make each survivor unique, that would break the game.
---
You can't buff killers too much, that would also break the game.
---
They made Deathgarden to live their fantasy and make the game they wanted in the first place.
---
Do you know that survivors used to be able to climb in DBD? Deathgarden is their dream project, DBD is whatever was created in the meantime, adjusted to what the community liked.
---
When in God's name is this myth going to die? That's not how human mental development works. At all. Plenty of people lose their parent or experience severe trauma and don't have hampered mental development. It doesn't state that in her lore and one post getting upvoted doesn't make it true.
---
Abilities: Yes  
---
Speed: No
---
He can place portals on the ground and transfer between them. He also has a lunge attack which has decent range, but barely no turning momentum and a long cooldown regardless if he misses or hits
---
Why exactly are you deranking?
---
I don't know. It's equally frustrating on the other end. Because survivors have third person, I often find that even without a terror radius survivors can find me before I can find them. Additionally, it always them to reveal a Ghostface from behind cover where Ghostface couldn't make them. I feel like the stealth aspect of Ghostface is equally frustrating, but I'm not sure how you could change it.
---
just use distortion and both of you are basically untraceable
---
I have been advancing on hook with full visual around, spine chill etc and seen them doing the hook dance regardless if the killer is around bit I dunno.
---
I saw someone few months/weeks ago also saying they got DS for Adam without having DS as teachable, was that you?
---
My point is that finding a locker out of 20 lockers is easier than finding one teammate out of 3 or less, and high level players **do** cleanse totems in-between objectives all the time. It's definitely going to influence people's perk choice to some degree, but we'll obvs have to wait and see how strong it really is.
---
If he's leaning, you usually just cant break him out, and thats intentional. You have to have view on the majority of his body.
---
Yeah its kinda annoying but its annoying for ghostfaces to i once was watching the gate and i revealed ghostface who was across the whole map.
---
should just dc on hidden offerings not like its gonna be a good game anyways
---
Bbq and chill my dude
---
Ah, a fellow person of culture.
---
*demogorgons mori is him just eating it
---
I love it when I get 3 totems a couple unhooked 4 heals and a gen or too, run the killer around for a few minutes then escape and I get messaged about how I'm a filthy gen rushing trash survivor. Like what else do you want me to do bro? stand there and let you kill me?
---
Unless it's changed you can get credit for it by taking hits near a hook while the survivor is being carried. The scoring event says Protection so it should still count but it's been ages since I've finished that one so it might have been 'fixed'.
---
What a gamer lmao
---
you cant max characters in this game, you can still grind items and and offerings after p3
---
Do you play survivor yourself?
---
My P3 Claudette begs to differ. Come fight her in a field. If you can see her.
---
feelsbadman
---
When you're sick of getting Gen Rushed so you bicycle kick the Generator into oblivion.
---
?
---
I always took it as a "hurry up" action from impatient survivors
---
Object of Obsession and Distortion gives you 30 seconds of seeing the killer and them not seeing you. 
---
Spine chill is very powerful and has no cooldown. 
---
Premonition is hard to use but effective if you can pull it off. 
---
Alert is great.
---
playing like an asshole like staying around hooks longer, tunneling, ect 
---
If you really want to shut down a game though just slug.
---
DON'T COME TO BADHAM PRESCHOOL TOMORROW
---
That dude has a nice butt
---
I notice sometimes your own body can body block you from seeing him, alongside this you to a small extent have to actually be turned with their face at him and not performing any actions such as gens and what not.
---
I was gonna say that it would have been the right desicion to try to get 1 kill, but he hit you on the hook for no reason, which is unnecessarily toxic.
---
I’m a P3 Dwight main and wouldn’t have it any other way!!!!!
---
Nurse would like a word
---
Brilliant.
---
Yes, but it also takes 30 units of evil, or 30 seconds of stalking at point blank range. If there’s more than two gens left, no one escapes that
---
Can see the Killer leaving at 9 seconds. Maybe they saw you being camped?
---
Now THIS is the high quality shitposting that I love. 
---
Well done. This is fantastic.
---
Damn you just made the perk 5x stronger in my eyes
---
First part: I understand that we should help the new survivor, however we gotta do it in a way that let's them learn the basic functionmetals. We Should let them escape, but have a "Instering" game for them. [Let them escape after 2rd hook].
---
Second part: Billy is based on reads, if you know where a survivor is vaulting you can 99 you're chainsaw and down then down as they vault. Same rule for pallets. [Not a Billy main, mostly ghostface nurse, and huntress main.] Hope this help
---
yo! what the fuck
---
If I'm farming I tend to not to kill/sacrifice Survivors. However, if one slams a pallet on my head and has the gaul to butt-dance to my misfortune then they have revoked their Escape Jail card
---
Of course not. You can break him out even if he is leaning, it's just harder.
---
That would be a nice solo buff
---
As of now ghost face mechanics are "broken" as some might say but I fell as thoe it was done unpurpose to make him a better killer compared to what he was in the beta were he was getting revealed so easy that people were already comparing him to legion and I'm sure BHVR doesnt want another want of those and having people constantly screaming for a buff
---
I did say most. Nurse, huntress, spirit (and maybe the stalkers and plague) all get a pass.
---
I thought Jason was the Trapper
---
To be fair, it looked like the Claudette began the animation to jump in, but then it stopped midway. Maybe it was glitching out the jump button and the heal button?
---
haha sry
---
Its difficult now because in the pre-endgame you still had to powers gens, stealthy, and the open the door to survive. Still very hard but obviously do able. That's how we used to survive.
---
But now the hatch immediately appears once there's 1 survivor left, giving them a way out. But this achievement wants you to keep working on gens. However the killer is now looking for hatch to shut it and once the hatch is shut, gens are powered, interrupting to gen repair and canceling the achievement. 
---
The only way to get it is hope you can juke or flashlight or hide well enough to keep on final gen, or hope the killer is too focused (and blind) finding the survivor, scratch marks, or the hatch and can't find any.

I couldn't show u the whole game but he facecamped one guy and we got him out then he got me
---
Still not as good though
---
Its basically a killers ability to kill a survivor instantly, if he was hooked once and if he's in the dying state (I think thats how its called; when you are laying on the ground)
---
No i mean its controls are weird it like slided u cant just stop turning
---
thank you!!!
---
Umm not all megs
---
This is top tier
---
that’s a pathetic and uneducated argument. Ofc it’s the top tier nurses that are broken. However stating  “the other killers are weak against survivors” as in all survivors is ridiculous. Sure, some killers are weak against top tier survivors (clown, legion, bubba). But if you think that hag, billy, myers are underpower agaisnt strong survivors, then you’re just a killer main who needs to git gud
---
Its endgame, anything goes.
---
The most important part here is that his chainsaw doesn't stop after hitting 1 survivor.
---
yeah I have say, if teabagging is that toxic and triggers you so much. I wouldn't play killer, stick to survivor.
---
WATCH OUT WATCH OUT WATCH OUT
---
Can someone fill me in on this format?
---
I have that with half of my adept achievements. Truly awful.
---
Thanks, I’m blind now
---
Honestly Bhvr has been treating us like the little princesses that we are
---
It's Ghostface

A lot of swf just want to play with freinds and have no intrest in bullying or winning

Is jake Asian? I always thought he was sorta Native American

* Video submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to self-promotion spam.

it had a jump, because there was a free weekend. It will get back over time eventually
---
I'd either play it (the queue times aren't that bad, so you don't even see that it's dying, they are better than in DBD) or wait a year or two to see if it dies or grows
---
I was lucky because this was the same game I got Adept in the same night the update released. I kept on gens, I found one that had been started with good progress, and the Freddy couldn't find hatch to shut it on me. He spent more time looking for hatch (because that's what survivors look for now) that he ignored his gen pressure encase I MIGHT have been running objectives. Completed gen, he lost all map pressure and now had to look for exits. 
---
My gen was by exit, left of map from the Auto Haven gas station close to the wall of horizontal cars. He was somewhere right of map along the verticle wall of cars. Adept+Left for Dead
---
Enhanced Senses has a bit too much going for it. If it were just scratch marks lasting longer, and totem sounds being louder I think it would be around BHVR levels of balance. Maybe bump the numbers up on how long scratch marks last. The aura showing on failed skill checks is on the level of a Rare addons for Freddy though.
---
There’s nothing else he could have done? He had one person at the end, and to secure that kill he *has* to facecamp. Either he doesn’t, and loses a survivor, or he does, and gets called toxic. There’s no good option in that situation.
---
Difference being that there are 18 killers and every survivor does the same shit. Also people won games before Ruin existed stop being so dramatic.
---
Stop me if any of this sounds familiar:
---
Ragequit if the match doesn't go your way. 
---
Beat the other guy then pop off in the chat at how great you are. 
---
If you somehow lose to the other guy then he was playing "unfair" by not playing by your rules. Then proceed to shit talk at how bad the other guy is.
---
It’s basically the game cheating in favor of the survivor
---
Pallet closed
---
Trapper building some RBTs for pig.
---
 Plague visiting the doctor/nurse.
---
Billy and Bubba in a chainsaw competing in cutting woodenstatues with the chainsaw.
---
Clown drooling over Freddies fingers
---
who?
---
It feels shitty both ways. I love playing as Ghostface, but I had a game last night where I was looking at a survivor, couldn't stalk them, and they broke me out of Night Shroud. I also had a game where I was able to crouch and 360 around a Feng and stalk her without her being able to center the camera on me.
---
What just happened
---
It's just down hill from there man. What's worse is when they DC when you moiri them so you wont get your daily then flame you in after game chat. This game is just pure toxicity most of the time.
---
What do you have?
---
Killers: Hability
---
Like those ideas! I already made a separate Freddy, Clown and Nurse, but maybe once I'm done with the others I might revisit them
---
Freddy *really* trying to scratch through the gen.
---
Haha, I actually asked McLean if Quentin's face can get a buff (as a joke) but he said "No his face is perfect" lol.
---
Way to go, pardner :)
---
Then don't go after the unhooked survivor.
---
Seems like a normal place for a totem to mr
---
What u want him to walk away from the 2 survivors SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO THE HOOK. Man you are a winey bitch if you think that is face camping. Face camping is only an excuse if the killer has much to do like patrol gens and if no survivors are currently near, if he has things to do and he is sitting at the hook, then that would be scummy.
---
Good recap of the past week ngl
---
And since Nancy is coming with her locker heal perk it could be pretty useful
---
I don't play Survivor, but Steve Ahoy might make me start.
---
Good point, I didn't think about cursed - I think it would be very bullshit if this perk countered that. There's definitely still some issues in my description of the perk.
---
I never close the hatch if I find it
---
What add-on teaches you kung fu?
---
You must spend most of your time near hooks I’m guessing
---
That’s just hilarious
---
I'm usually like "...Well, shit." And then I hide in a locker and accept my fate.
---
&gt; but I also recommend being chased in the dream world by freddy, slamming down a random dream pallet, and instantly 
---
er
---
what?
---
why would this make you disappear from the chase?
---
Maybe the key should drop from the survivor if they get killed, or when they escape, like how an item would be dropped from a sacrificed survivor.
---
I bought larurie for decisive strike but who has borrowed time?
---
Punctuation would be nice here. Thanks.
---
I'll definitely work on him later. Still trying to figure out a fun scenario. I'll try and post a new killer every day. Currently Nurse, Clown and Freddy are (almost) finished amd will be posted in the next few days
---
No but when I am near one because of dumb survivors unhooking right in front of me I should get a down
---
So your argument against the cap being raised is that they have to make the game suck in that regard to stop people from realizing it still sucks in other regards too? Yeah that sounds about right for BHVR.
---
Just go for the person unhooking and you won’t have that issue
---
I still think borrowed time is just objectively better still, if you’re out of the killers heart beat, a smart survivor that got unhooked shouldn’t get caught again immediately.
---
I never thought i waited to know something like this but now i do.
---
Weell..
---
u know.. she is too masculine looking for me..
---
but that's trur for me with Rin-chan..
---
The colors are wrong, it should be red who pushes the faces over.
---
The person unhooking would be fully healed more convenient to go for the one that’s injured
---
Honestly I get more scary moments out of Hag than I do Myers. There are definitely some good Myers moments but 2 years of playing this game and I still jump at every Hag trap.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cvp3ua/new_bug_survivor/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I’m also in support of empathy over bond because honestly, I don’t really need to see my teammates unless they’re injured. If they’re getting chased, like you said they’ll either escape or get hit and then I’ll see them, and if I want to heal them then I can only do that for injured people.
---
Aside from staring at him.
---
Console DBD, this checks out.
---
I mean i have seen plenty of 4 man swf messing around and personally i just do it to mess around with freinds, I'm red ranks my freiends are grey-green but no one ever pips cause we just mess around sandbagging eachother, using meme builds etc. Not all swf are malicious.
---
That’s just tunnelling off hook though? I bet you complain about ds and borrowed time being broken
---
I think he'd vault it quicker than the survivors, actually.
---
It's called a JOKE.
---
I will follow your works for sure!
---
And maybe if I will figure out a fun scenario for him I will write you if you want
---
Not tunneling if it’s the most logical and better choice in the situation 
---
DS and Borrowed time are normal perks so there’s no need to complain unless they’re OP 
---
Getting and invincibility frame is completely different
---
The doors would take longer to open.
---
Ok but they were all like rank 18 I’ve only been playing for like 4 days 🗿
---
He's mixed, Asian American I believe.
---
Oh I see, so to initiate the burn in game you just have to shine it on them, in no place specific?
---
must it be held on them for long *before* the stun is triggered?
---
And lastly, does it only affect the nurse mid-blink? Or in the pre-blink, and post-blink states?
---
Sure, I'm open to different ideas :)
---
A few people have mentioned curses, which I agree with. So to balance the perk more, I'd add the line "Doesn't affect curses".
---
You husband now
---
I mean your just going for the person who was hooked which is a little scumming not even giving them a chance. Most of the time you hardly get i frames unless you’re close to the hooked survivors back even then just let them run a bit and then hit them. Not really an issue.
---
BHVR’s art team does not program the game, they are two separate departments with completely different teams, as with most studios. Creating skins, which are optional, does not hamper the development of the game if important art assets are already done (such as the assets for the Stranger Things chapter.) If you’re going to be a cynical douchebag like me, at least try to have a valid point instead of making up reasons to be mad.
---
It’s not scummy it’s just a normal play style 
---
Scummy is me standing right next to the hooking revving a chainsaw or hook camping with insidious
---
I am a very empathetic person, and when I first started playing, I had a hard time playing Killer because the screams survivors do when hooked. I always felt awful. I find the Huntress' lullaby to be very soothing (which, y'know, duh), and as I started playing her, I found that I could focus in on that more and I wouldn't feel bad about the screams.
---
So anyways, that's how the severe mental trauma of a fictional character helped me stop feeling guilt and remorse.
---
To me it is. But I guess I play different.
---
You can just shine it on their body. Wraith is affected whenever he is cloaked and Nurse, I think, only when she is charging her blink, which is why it's almost impossible to lightburn her. I think add-ons change how long you need to shine your flashlight, but the wikipedia page on Lightburn has the exact numbers, probably.
---
Stop it. Get some help.
---
Actually now that i think of it. Myer's permanent tier 3 would also be really problematic. Would he just lose his power for the rest of the game? How about if the perk would instead make debuffs expire like 500% faster. That way it would basically do the same thing but wouldn't mess with permanent effects such as hexes or myer's tier 3?
---
Kindred should just be base kit for Surviviors. It's not an overwhelming perk and it would be a major buff to soloq
---
Not only does pig slow down but crouching obscures your own vision not allowing you to see past rocks and corn.
---
If a Rank 1 is going to SWF with Rank 20s, then they should get paired with a Rank 1 killer.
---
Now, that only applies to SWF.  Ranking system is still broken as fuck.  Learned this when I played my first ever survivor game, as a solo baby Dwight, and got matched up with basically what you described, Huntress with Iri Head and Infantry Belt.
---
You drop a dream pallet in chase far enough away and your aura's gone and scratch marks disappear for 10 sec. Usually leaves killers in a "wtf?" moment.
---
I do wish the survivors had a unique voice clip that would play if they walk into another trap within 5 seconds of getting out of the one they were just in.
---
Don't miss it at all. It sucked.
---
You do understand that going vs people much lower ranks also ruins the game for the killer, right? It's fucking annoying when I'm clearly playing vs someone I shouldn't be.
---
How about "Doesn't affect curses or killer abilities".
---
Vigil will be a perk to counter other regular perks and addons.
---
Whenever I see people lag on my behalf or not as a killer, I always stop, stare, and assess, if it's just some stupid internet bullshit, I either let them have a small re-ignition to the chase, let them go, or down and fully leave them if I'm in a pinch.
---
That's fair.
---
Weirdly, yes me too.
---
iridescent*
---
I think you have to level that killer you got the bbq on to level 30
---
Hmm...maybe Azarov's skull saying "That hurts" or "Not so loud" after Bing Bong into the Bell
---
Great meme but that's a weird way to use this template
---
Only reason I went the way I did is cuz Dwight (in lore) is a bit of a scaredy cat, like Shaggy, so he's more likely to run and hide
---
And Jake is the guy who is all hands on so he's more likely to ~~set~~ break traps, like Freddy
---
A Nid or Dark Elder would fit nicely for a killer. Maybe a Night Lord.
---
Just wake up, Jesus Christ. Oh wait, that's too OP, so Freddy needs a nerf, right?
---
If you're in a chase you 100 percent will not be far enough away for this to work
---
maybe on baby killers
---
No guide explains this, sorry DBD Vet.
---
Believe me I know the struggle. But you'll get better even against scumbags, you'll know what to expect of them. Hang in there and try to learn something from these shitty matches. As in never go for the skilled survivors (they know all pallet locations and jungle gyms). A team is as strong as their weakest link. Find that player and exploit it. 
---
Never pick up survivors from the ground if:
---
* There is someone with a flashlight (if you do have a wall in front of you, you can do it, otherwise is not advised)
---
* Someone waiting at a pallet or the downed survivor placed itself at the pallet 
---
* Survivor was hooked recently (under 60 secs before) assume they all have DS so resist the urge to pick them up especially if they seem to come towards you
---
Make them run by injuring them before picking up a downed survivor. Use the downed survivor as bait to hit the others as they come to help. Then stealth and follow with Nurse's Calling.
---
Glad I could help you. See you in the Fog, better, stronger 😊
---
Were did you find this can we make this a new meme format?
---
Funny how in this game its not considered a cheat where some other games it's bannable. Back in my day a dot of blue tac in the centre was god mode when playing killingfloor
---
If David was in the original survivors I'd 100% agree but I was just thinking of the original 4 survivors with this to reflect the spirit of Scooby-Doo onto DbD since we will **NEVER** get a Scooby-Doo chapter
---
Ikr lol proud of the devs uwu
---
That would acually be even better. It wouldn't be too fun to have your stalk reset as ghostface either
---
Feng Min
---
Okay dope, I’m trying to learn to play nurse, (on console) and not letting myself get burned because I didn’t know it works that way, is a big help.  Do you know a good perk loadout for Nurse? I’m running sloppy, nurse’s and ruin at the moment.
---
Stop your late and your videos are annoying please stop posting them here.
---
One perk to rule them all...
---
I play both occasionally, and I found wait times to be kinda identical.
---
Why would scratch marks disappear? Am I missing something?
---
via 9gag.com
---
So what is this wonderful wiki?
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Shrine_of_Secrets
---
It reads:
---
When a player buys a Teachable Perk from the Shrine, the Perk will from then on be unlocked in every Character's Bloodweb ￼.
---
This means that when buying a Unique Killer Perk, all the Killers will then be able to unlock that Perk in their respective Bloodwebs.
---
Sort of, most of my killer games are agaisnt full teams who are higher rank than I am and they arent even swf
---
Noodle leg!
---
It makes the next generator kicked after hooking someone instantly regress a certain amount, after which, normal regression resumes.
---
More like little demons
---
Nvm I reread distortion
---
Ye idk the source :( coz found it while going through my old photos

It seems that a lot of people are still mad about Mettle of Man being in it’s broken state before the nerf and I get that. I broke a headset because of the damn perk but as it stands right now the Ash vs Evil Dead dlc is just pathetic. You pay for Ash who’s fucking BEEFY and loud making him impractical to run and his perks are straight garbage, Quinten has Pharmacy which is good, Ace is the quiets male survivor which is good but Ash has literally nothing, he is, in my opinion, the worst survivor in the game.

Mikey failed a skillcheck and it yeet him away

Wait I’m actual blind xD
---
It is. Babysitter should have been merged with WGLF and we would have had a BBQ for survivors.

It's how the perk works. Aura disruption isn't the only effect. Just wish it had more tokens...

Freddy can see your aura when you slam a dream pallet?!

I once hid in a locker against a huntress. It was one of the dumbest things I ever did. Needless to say, I didn't make it out.
---
Ok, I can believe that. But still, my point stands for endgame.

It dosent say her age anywhere on the wiki it say however that she goes to university so make of that what you will
---
And again, that's why I said it was a nice acronym. However, I'm going to counter by saying that I've only heard it used that way one other time before, and I've been at this for quite a long time. I'm pretty confident that's an uncommon homophone, at best.
---
A lot of them are toxic apparently. Im a Claudette main on Xbox, hardly ever toxic, and I don't see toxic Clauds very often, but they are out there for sure.
---
They probably didn't feel like implementing lightburn anymore
---
True. I would probably run it with well make it so I can heal if the killer isnt coming. And after it runs out oh well just have to play without it, just like if I ran it for bbq or whatever. Babysitter will still work without
---
double thank you bc i was wondering how tf to do it
---
i stan my own kind 👁👄👁
---
Imagine being a person who believes genrushing exists 😔
---
When survivors keep touching that one gen you kicked 5 times in 2min.
---
Don't run, just walk, and try and stay out of grass. She can't see you, but she can see the grass move.
---
Little hookers
---
Maybe not face camping him, but 12 meters can be easily closed by the killer to ensure the hooked survivor isn't rescued. Just need a straight line of sight so yeah regular camping. :/
---
I rarely get nice Aces on Xbox. The platforms are really weird, every character has a different stereotype.

Level 35, it's the second teachable

If you get it from the shop it'll appear in every killers blood web
---
Or play Ghostface and teabag right back
---
All ranks have just as much toxicity in them, although it can be pretty bad at red ranks because you have shitheads thinking their rank means something when it doesn’t.
---
That's an element of metagaming, yes, but that isn't the only thing metagaming is. It also refers to mind gaming (as I said) as well as playing around what you expect an opponent to do or use depending on what they play as or what they do.  
---
Metagaming isn't *just* using the best stuff. That's *power*gaming. But powergaming *is* a form of metagaming.
---
All i know about part 5 is that mista shoots himself alot and that someone named king chrimson's power just works.
---
It didn’t say iridescent head. It just said iridescent addons.
---
Yea that rank means anything, those people are the potatoes.
---
Play Ghostface:
---
Stalk
---
Hook
---
Teabag
---
Profit
---
spine chill is stupid good
---
works even against stealth killer except miers tier 1
---
Nurse *uhhhh* strangles it?
---
*ghostface takes a selfie with the gen after stabbing it*
---
It is a mindgame, though it takes little to no skill. All you have to do is stand still at the pallet for a few seconds and then phase when they commit to a direction. Any tricks they pull can be negated by you hearing them, bumping into them or seeing environmental cues.
---
Tombstone works as well.
---
All it means is they play a lot, not that they’re actually good. Especially on the survivor side, you can do basically nothing each game and still get to red ranks.
---
I'm not entirely sure this is the right place to be posting something like this.
---
I hate when people act like mind gaming isn’t a skill. Conditioning your opponent into guessing what you’ll do and then doing the opposite, switching up your tactics, these are things that take actual thought and make playing as and against spirit more fun than most other killers.
---
I thought this was the torture dance until I turned sound on
---
Poor jason
---
it'd be cool if leather could get that golden chainsaw from 3
---
I can't see how on earth the Hag missed that M1.  It looked like it hit.
---
But, a miss is a miss, and Hagatha made a mistake chasing you afterwards.  Should have just went and hooked your friend.  That cost them the kill.
---
yeah, but iridescent head is an iridescent addon
---
Didn’t even know this game has a mobile version. I looked it up and it appears to be in beta. How is it? Do you use a controller or touch controls?
---
Muscles? Im in.  
---
Spirit? In the way you describe, ehhhh.   
---
But laddies, we can all agree on Piggy
---
They both have exhaustion add-ons making mindbreaker more of a pain in the ass
---
remake Nancy sucked. She did nothing the entire film except nearly get herself killed. At least Quentin had plans and did research and tried.
---
Does someone know the realese dáte of the new stranthings update? I know its supposed to be in september... But which day?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uyTWFUNdxc top left
---
Is it worth it for the killer to open the exit gates. I know it starts the endgame collapse but I'm pretty low skilled so don't know if I should do it?
---
Specially The Clown imo, will be very strong with this perk; i said that because it's easier for him to hit you with the bottle than for The Huntress to actually hit you with a hatchet.
---
Huntress is more difficult, but The Clown can play trying to make everyone smell the gas a lot of times during the match, the exhaustion effect won't disappear if the survivor is on a gen with less than 50% progression. So basically those killers with that perk will get a lot of value because survivors will be a lot more time exhausted than those 30/90 seconds from the add-ons.
---

---
Drop kick that gen!
---
The point this guy is making is that she even renders the strongest tile useless. I understand it isn’t fun being looped at strong tiles but it’s equally frustrating to be unable to loop ANY tile.
---
Have it be like pharmacy and remove the aura reading and make it so you only get a green flashlight at most. Fixed your perk.
---
Yes, because losing your mother makes you stop aging mentally
---
No idea what you are even talking about, but it is worth noting, DBD is a semi competitive party game.
---
Insidious camping is a mechanic of the game, slugging all 4 survivors till they bleed out is also a mechanic of the game, all people do is get mad at killers "using a mechanic of the game" but refuse to acknowledge their shit is just as unfun &amp; trollish
---
Well I mean, the question would be, do you light burn the husk (which makes her power laughably bad against flashlights) or light burn the actual invisible Spirit (which makes it laughably improbable to ever land a lightburn)
---
Either way I think they should probably just ditch the Lightburn mechanic in general (except for Hag traps probably) poor Mr Bing Bong doesn't need to get booli'd by flashlights.
---
Just smack them out. You can literally force them to leave, and if they don’t, they get punished for it. Don’t absorb the mentality of being super offended by this stuff, you’re going to ruin the game for yourself.
---
More like, how much time till he goes insane amd become a killer himslef
---
He has ascended to drop kicking a gen
---
I always describe her as feral, not childlike. How many little kids you know can wipe out a platoon of soldiers?
---
*plague bitch slaps and vomits on it*
---
New gen smashing emotes coming soon TM
---
Yeah, even if she had hit me while she chased me i coulda crawled out. 
---
Got a message from her saying Im just a trash survivor main and how I an so entitled that I cant even give the killer a win
---
Opening the exit gates as Killer is really more of a "I give up" than anything else.
---
There are edge cases where you have someone slugged and have Blood warden where maybe you want to pop the gates and then use BW, but that's gunna happen really infrequently.
---
I think feral describes her better than childish, you're right.
---
After meeting people who think that killers should not kill them and survivors should not want to survive he quits
---
This format implies that the rank 20 dweet is going to clap the killer's cheeks ( if I remember the episode right )
---
I complain about clipping models when cosmetics come out, especially when the release is what's clipping. Wanting $10 to get you something without glaring error isn't unreasonable. Bad example.
---
yea i dont care about this idea now, it sucks.
---
You are the first person I’ve ever seen with negative karma... honest respect for that lol
---
That doesn't explain it at all.
---
Be does indeed
---
This is a sub about DBD. TydeTyme is a DBD streamer and Im openly disagreeing with the idea that this game is dull.
---
I agree with you, and I also worry new players will be scared off. It’d be nice if we could have a megathread or something for that purpose as well once the DLC drops. 
---
I’m not the best but I have a lot of hours and would be more than happy to try to help out new PS4 players. My sister and I play frequently and will adopt any baby Dweets out there. 😍
---
Invincibility Frames prob glitched out a lil
---
I'm curious on why you say that if I'm being honest? Not the poster but want your perspective on why, is it because of him being a little toxic, fans or what?
---
I can't be the only one whose jaw dropped when I heard you could close the hatch, am I?
---
I mean even if it was broke you would see a lot more Franklin’s.
---
I don't run it cus it take up room where I can have better perks. Plus most of the time it doesn't help. And from what I've seen as my rank got higher I've gotten teammates that aren't quite as stupid.
---
Devour hope
---
I can't count how many times I've revealed Ghost Face Halloween Mask and I still get the one shot down. It's definitely broken. It's one of the main reasons I can't stand playing against him. It's unfair. It would be forgivable if players knew how to play as him, sadly only a handful of players actually play him well. The rest just camp with him. Making it a miserable experience in general. 
---
I get they wanted to introduce a killer they will help players get more kills but they should have made him an easy killer. In fact all license killers should be no harder then medium because they are more popular and bad players will want to play as them too. Since they can't adapt, they just do what comes natural and camp.  
---
Since my killer mains were Myers, Freddy and Spirit I had no problem playing him fair. In fact, I love his stalking better then Myers. But it's unfair that he gets a Myers T3 in seconds. It really is. It begs the question, Are killers really that bad that they needed that? 
---
The only upside is that players are wise to him now and treating him like a camper first and foremost. Which leads to more escapes and I'm starting see less and less of him across all platforms. He's needs a rework badly.
---
It really seems like you're more just angry at him in particular for his opinions and statements (which while some of them are stupid) doesn't really mean you need to make a post like this.
---
She has toys for the children she kidnaps but from what lore we see, hunting is her go-to fun activity.
---
I think that’s really dumb.  I’d like to play the new killer with good perks when it comes out considering I just spent X amount of dollars on it. But nope. Gotta spend god knows how many hours to get decent perks lol.
---
Welp I almost never saw Ace teabagging in all my time playing. I guess I might be a tad lucky then.
---
Always satisfying when you defeat noed and know the killer was banking on it
---
that grammar tho
---
I'm not entirely sure that's how the blood webs work, but we seem to know so little about how they actually function that it could be wasting a useful high tier slot. I'd contact BHVR support to see if they have any way of fixing it.
---
Not really, because you can just put on Iron Will.
---
Q time for surv is about 10 seconds on PC
---
Omg I thought u meant that's just on his comment alone but that's honestly the first for me too
---
Jesus Jake disagrees
---
This is why meme build is superior to meta build :) avoid sweaty ranks and have fun doing it
---
How about going against two rank 1s on rank 11 because of 4 man??
---
New account tho so whatever
---
I'm new to the game and I fell like I'm wasting bloodpoints in useless perks, anyone could help me a little bit?
---
You admitted to tunneling in the chat yet you say in the title that you didn't tunnel
---
&gt;Rank 1 killers with noed
---
Hmmm
---
But there really isn’t a right time since you’re just gonna proxy camp and then pretend to be surprised that you’re coming back to the guy who just got hooked, lol
---
Hey you!  Chase me!  
---
Hey you!  Why'd you chase me!
---
EGT is so slow when someone is hooked, it may aswell be nonexistend. If people camp, they depip though so you'll maybe see them once and thats it
---
They’re literally not different. Moonwalking isn’t hard to do and the survivor equally has to guess which way you’re going to attack from. Which is where conditioning comes in. If you commit to moonwalking two times, the third time the survivor will assume you are going to do it again where you can try and switch it up on them. Spirits ability just adds another layer to that where, wow, the survivor has to think about what the spirit will do. Which, btw you have plenty of time to hide from her line of sight and not give her an idea of if you’re going to stand at the pallet and try to vault it at the right time or abandon the pallet altogether in search of another one. But of course, most survs I see just try to challenge it head on and complain when it doesn’t work in their favor. I’m really bored of people mindlessly wanting to nerf strong abilities as if we just want to go against pig or wraith every game when looping them is as easy as it gets.
---
What exactly do you mean? Are you unsure of which teachable perks to try to get first or are you worried about getting bad perks in your Bloodwebs?
---
I never tunneled, but arguing that I wasn't was just going to be more frustrating. I was on him because he was the first survivor I saw, and the only one who kept running at me.
---
That will (and I can say for certain) won’t happen. Licensing issues and all, but also, if they did come, they’d just come as skins, but it’s most likely not going to happen for the nightmare chapter. New Line is pulling and/or not renewing licenses, making it impossible to do anything with freddy.
---
Think of every scenario in the game the killer could reach survivors if it didn't respect the environment. Waist-high walls he won't lean over, thin/literally paper walls he won't just kick through. You can be functionally face to face with death and be completely safe as a survivor.
---
I always assumed her mother hummed that lullaby to her as a child so when huntress was trying to care for her kidnapped daughters she hummed to them. Maybe she even hums to her victims to add a layer if spookiness and that's why they have her humming ingame
---
I used to play One Punch Freddy (Old Freddy with STBFL, PWYF, M&amp;A, and Rancor) during the Mettle Of Man Crisis. Ignore obsession all match, one-punch-mori at the end to counter MoM, instaheal, Dead Hard, etc. I imagine the build still works but I found it best with Old Freddy because his built in stall and tracking allowed you to rack up your stacks and still be somewhat effective even though you don't have Ruin.
---
Half the fun was the obsession typically thought they were the Remember Me obsession and hid in lockers, etc to try and "deny remember me stacks" when in reality you couldn't care less about them until the last gen pops. Awake survivors couldn't see Freddy's aura either so they had no clue they were the Rancor.
---
Ah, but what if the Dwight holds the door shut? What then Myers, *what then*
---
And yes, I def have to learn to get better, I'm not even a decent Killer really but I'm pretty new to the game so that's ok (rank 7 sometimes higher sometimes lower)
---
Trash in what way?
---
Iron will + med kit will do you better
---
You just have to buy the perks.
---
It's possible to let the Entity consume the perks, but they'll just keep showing up in the Bloodweb.
---
When you start getting two perks, pick the better perk and the Entity will consume the other one.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
I gotta say i almost got it today...
---
If you care a lot about something, and someone says “This thing is bad, but I’m going to exploit it for personal gain, which I’ve already done before” it’s ok to be a little mad. Especially when it relies on the community of people who also care about the thing.
---
You do need line of sight, however most hitboxes in the game are pretty much what they look like. There are gaps in the Killer Shack walls, they aren't all solid, and you can stack through the gaps in the boards on certain walls of the shack.
---
Yeah he gave you his dumbass "nothing is toxic" opinion. Unless you think that me deranking to rank 15 with my other 3000 hour buddies and all equipping instaheals isn't "toxic" then sure, nothing is toxic, do whatever you want, it's a really lazy selfish (killermain) way to look at things.
---
If however you do have braincells and you realize that's pretty toxic than congratulations, you've surpassed the average redditkillermain scumbag downy-level of empathy and are now considered a human being. In which case it's: don't camp, don't tunnel, use ebony mori's sometimes but when you get semi-decent at the game stop using them all the time, they're literally overpowered. 
---
That's basically it, sure there are some niche situations where you could be nicer or camping isn't such a big deal but overall I'd stick to those 3 things.
---
It's also annoying when they can see who is going for an unhook yet all decide to drop the gens and run over.
---
aww :)
---
Ace in the hole has more meanings than I thought
---
I see they whipped out the survivors rule book.
---
I was able to stalk someone as Ghostface through a wall in the basement as they looted the basement chest.
---
I would say haddonfield is fair since shelter woods exists. but we aren’t gonna mention that, are we.
---
Aw man
---
god DAMMIT
---
The survivors law book*
---
The humming kind of serves a gameplay purpose since they changed it to be like Freddy's singing in that the audio is a lot less directional than the heartbeat. Makes it even creepier.
---
On ps4 especially higher ranks it can take up to ten minutes to get into a lobby and sometimes it will be the same killer you just faced.
---
Unbreakable has a counter..... literally just hook the survivor. What are you talking about?
---
Found the guy who tbags and gets upset when he gets clapped
---
But it's basically two perks to eventually run faster if not outplayed.
---
I mean, it has counterplay. Killers already avoid walking through pallets already.
---
Great! Thanks so much for letting me derail you, you’ve been a great help!
---
yeah, I though about contacting them too, but since I´m a lazy fuck I never did, guess I´ll do it now.
---
Man, these guys really have to give us more lore. We'll all pull our hair out debating over little  breadcrumbs of info.
---
No prob :)
---
The redhead from Hocus Pocus lol
---
Count me in! This seems like a fantastic idea!
---
lithe
---
its more favorable on most maps as on a lot of them there are very few places where balanced landing benefits you
---
if you have an offering for the game, roll with balanced landing but otherwise run lithe
---
it gives you an edge on the killer cause most the time they’re forced to vault, and by that time you’re long gone
---
How do you get up there?
---
Witches of Izalith
---
It really depends on which playstyle you prefer. Pig has more of a stalling/ambushing style, and Ghostface is more reliant on sneaking/stalking effectively (if you can manage to stay unspotted)
---
I'd advise watching some streams or videos of the Killer's being played to see which looks more exciting to you. They both have their goods and their bads.
---
Witches of izalith
---
Survivors can't point?
---
The original meme wasn't about noed. Stop being a stick in the mud
---
Amount of gens needed to be completed for hatch to spawn = Amount of survivors alive + 1. 
---
Exception is that if one survivors is remaining, the hatch will ALWAYS spawn and open automatically.
---
Balanced landing. Even if you’re exhausted and don’t get the speed burst, you still get less stager from landing. It’s the only exhaustion perk with a passive benefit on top of the regular benefit. Doesn’t matter if you’re exhausted or not, it still helps you.
---
If you are running blood warden it can be a useful play and helps counter overly altruistic play groups.
---
Idk if you were around in 2016, but having exhaustion perks proc more than once in a chase is devastating.
---
Why bother cleaning the dull totems before this perk? Genuinely curious. Aside from bloodpoints but I didn’t think they were worth much unless the totems were active.
---
you say it like 90% of the, don’t run it.
---
I’ve been running DS since Thursday because of the shitty teammates and or shitty killers who have been tunneling the shit out of people... had a Bubba Sunday who actually didn’t tunnel or farm I was shocked! He got a 3k in the end with the random just barely getting out the gates.
---
As a killer main I do this.
---
Bicycle kick!? Okay Myers!
---
Play however you want but remember, don’t chide people for playing how they want. It’s a two way street.
---
looks good good job
---
I personally prefer Balanced Landing but I think both perks are good. Go with the one that most suits your playstyle.
---
where still looking for that answer
---
Imagine getting tilted over a killer playing the game as intended
---
I do the same but then the damn asshole who just got farmed decides to body block and get in my way! I just whack them back down and proceed to the unhooker! But if it happens again, you going back up on that hook since I’m trying to be nice and now your being the asshole!
---
That's great and all that you like spine chill and you're rank 15 sitting in lockers but could you please stop parroting this stupid bullshit and just stfu? Thanks
---
Oh f
---
thanks :)
---
Hell No Sicko! Go see MJ (Michael Jackson) for that!

---
*-Breaking- and lunge animation replaced by a dropkick that breaks spines and generators alike*

*-Sensing the big dick energy radiating from your massive schlong, survivors now hear your terror radius across the entire map.*

Well we are talking about a killer who facecamps, do you really think they'll know how to play correctly?
---
The wicked witch of the west
---
Had a game the other day, it was a very obvious SWF, all of them had items, I managed to get 3 of them, spotted the 4th, she ran up to me and started spinning and pointing, so I just killed her and hooked her up, im farming bp right now, and with BBQ and chilli that one kill meant around 6k bonus. End game chat she said "No such thing as a nice killer."
---
Who are they?

no, i'm not leaving them alone
---
i'm taking them to the hatch because anybody that gives me ice cream is good in my book, i like strawberry,
---
Nah, the point of a stealth build is that you don't want to get detected in the first place.
---
Run Urban Evasion, Lightweight, Iron Will and Distortion if you want a pure stealth build.
---
Lol! Poor hag
---
Dark souls 1
---
Usually I am at red ranks when new killers come out. Not really fun to play with Monstrous Shrine there...
---
I have a ton for Pig and I still have a bunch for Leatherface even though I now own him. I might have 1 for Michael somewhere and never saw the one for Freddy.
---
[why the downvote, give me an upvote](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cvjvag/hmmm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
I do this so no one complains about noed at the end.
---
It's the young huntress bro
---
They said that they'd be working the effect into existing perks and add-ons. Tinkerer and Dark Devotion needed buffed anyway, so I wouldn't be at all surprised if that what they're going for.
---
The Mila Kunis version or the Margaret Hamilton version?
---
Thanks!
---
Nah I can't just ruin the lives if a new player just like that, I want them to have fun in the game
---
But for real this is a really cool suggestion. I'm tryna get my hands on monster hunter world rn since I absolutely love mh4u, played it everyday for a long ass time
---
It's not.

Grand High Witch
---
I didn't edit it the photograph did, it isn't that bright in real cx

Here, recent great clip from Tru3 showing counterplay versus his Spirit.  He has way more hours than you, he's playing against top tier survivors, he plays both sides extensively, yet still gets counterplayed.  His Spirit game is top notch, so how can this happen to him?

DBD players are like pretend versions of serial killer groupies.
---
Thx man!
---
On console it's no snacks at all. Need both hands to hit those skill checks. :(
---
Ormond is even stronger for survs
---
Have a nice day
---
Welp.  😣
---
this was hilarious because I was in class, waiting for the image to load thinking it was going to be something serious but it turned out to be that thing lol
---
Maybe if it showed for more than 100 milliseconds I’d be able to see it
---
Where from? All I know is that nurse does not wear shoes with then dangling and wraith @syou see him kicking gens and you see toes
---
LMAO
---
afaik you still can it’s just an insanely small window now
---
I didn’t think she was even that bad before
---
I mean you can intentionally gen rush such as getting your swf to run prove thyself and commodious toolboxes. It's extremely rare but it does exist
---
Adept Bill
---
Where's my piggy?
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VgdnN6Pv2TE
---
Yeah it’s definitely game breaking, but it made for a fun time because my friend that just got the game was freaking out lol
---
I hope they create a nude skin for her. A bit like david but more nude.
---
As someone with 1000+ hours I can confidently say less than 1% of killers run NOED at red ranks
---
Yeah, and the stay Puft Marshmallow Man as the Killer.
---
What characters do you have (and their teachables)?
---
There are other iridescent addons from other killers.
---
well, male survivors run way different to the female ones but everyone's running at the same movement speed
---
It's because of relative size
---
Better than wraith lmao, both without addons and with the best addons.
---
Ruin at rank 20? Really dude?
---
Tbagging is basically the best way to get a killer to chase the best looper in the match. Especially in mid ranks if you’re trying to help a friend get out just tbag once and the killer will put on blinders for the rest of the match until you’re dead.
---
I think GF is a better choice if you don't take yourself too seriously and play for fun. You can use him to T Bag, and jump scaring people from a window is funny.
---
Pig can be played at a very high level by top pig players.
---
Yeah,  and the stay Puft Marshmallow Man as the Killer.
---
StayPuff!!!!!
---
See that’s what I assumed, NOED seems like kind of a flimsy thing to rely on going into high stress games where every totem will probably be cleansed anyway, a high ranked killer is better off running something that helps them keep pressure throughout the game
---
I returned to dbd today, that's the joke about the meta
---
And just when I see that username, didn't you just jump on the "fortnite is bad" bandwagon?

How the how do you not have the Grooooooviest survivor yet?

Can I have this format? Haha
---
Ghostface is probably better, but they are both really fun to play.
---
I forgot about that outfit!
---
I’m definitely going to wait a few weeks then
---
if you think about it with how much they wanna keep nerfing chases i think P3 Claudette will become meta if they wanna just keep pushing fuckin stealth.
---
You get points for being undetected while near the killer
---
Lithe has saved me an innumerable number of times on the chase to the open exit gate
---
Everything you listed is true that happens and I agree with it to an extent. However it's also about intent. Someone who slugs all 4 survivors and let's them bleed out is a jerk and troll. However, if I'm picking someone up and a survivor or two is around me for various reasons of their own, flashlight, body blocking etc, I'm gonna hit them and try to down them if I can, without risking losing the guy on my shoulders. Insidious to me is kind of a trash perk and encourages camping. I dont think theres reall a use for insidious camping unless like, a very niche scenario like you're inside the exit gate or near a gen hiding in bushes but you're gonna lose pressure for sure and waste time. Also though, everything listed there wasnt even in the video though?
---
I'm not necessarily sure about that; I'll reserve judgment until we know what the add-ons are.
---
Females are smaller and alot harder to see. And don't quote me on this but I think they might have smaller hitboxes
---
Started 4 days ago man,I absolutely love this game I have 10 hours on it already.
---
Any tips?
---
Any advantages?
---
Female Surviviors have smaller framing, giving them a lower profile than male Surviviors. This is one of the reasons Surviviors like Nea and Claudette are so popular. Claudette in particular bc in every map except for Ormand and the Game her more bland clothing combined with the fact that she is black allows her to blend into the dark aesthetics.
---
Fucking creep? Besides, shirtless Myers was a thing first.
---
Why is Premonition a C-rank perk? I’m a rank 8 survivor and almost run it and find it helpful. I was surprised to see that it’s considered to be C-tier. Why is it?
---
Yea the emblem system is pretty stupid for many different reasons:
---
* As you described, if you spend most of your time doing gens and successfully avoid the killer, you "lose", which is retarded.
---
* I've had games where i ran the Killer around all game but still "lost" since i didn't do much gens or altruism actions
---
* The killer himself will "lose" if dominates the game too hard since if he wins all of his chases really fast and end the game quickly he gets a bad chase score (lol)
---
They really need to revamp the system.
---
Imo they are trying way too hard. Just do it so 2 escape + means a survivor win and 3 kills + means a Killer win. Simple
---
Naw it's bubba or Pig tbh. Legion is definitely down there tho
---
Like David or bill. Ik
---
Pop goes the weasel, surveillance, monitor, and another of whatever u want.
---
It gives her so much more depth. With a feral lens you can expand upon what it would mean to be a wild human in what most considered a developed postmodern world. She's a feral animal, but she's still human in her mental capacity, and she uses that intelligence to hunt not just for survival, but for the thrill of it. Anna is a feral human, a wild animal that uses human traits for savage gain.
---
always claudette/meg/nea/laurie.
---
I have to interfere, I dont just play to escape or kill as many as possible, I play to have FUN and to let everyone in my match have FUN. But this subreddit is beyond good or evil
---
I dunno, I always laugh when I smack a survivor over Haddonfield's fences
---
I used to use Prem, but then switched to Spinechill. I think this is why it's considered worse, as Spinechill activates continuously while Prem only chimes once. The disadvantage to Spinechill is it's not directional.
---
Once you switch to Spinechill and get good at using it, I think you'll see why people rate prem lower.
---
other thing.. she is not a chopped up body.. she is not a zombie.. she is a spirit xd
---
Placebo effect
---
Laurie main here. Only DC'd once ever due to intoxication. So KISS MY GRITS.
---
I used to run a pretty nasty build focusing around combo-ing Lithe with Dance With Me. I’m All Ears counters it pretty handily, but who tf runs that perk anyways. I also anticipate that Fixated will fit wonderfully with this build when it comes out
---
Ikr
---
But aren't you trying to just down survivors with their power instead of hitting them and going away?
---
Honestly, Prestiging should increase the cap by, like, 50,000 bloodpoints. That way prestiging actually has a reasonable use other than a very slight increase in item rarity.
---
2 killers 1 survivor
---
Thank you I'll give those a try happy oinks
---
This is why you turn spotify off when you play this game
---
I see no god up here, other than me.
---
Bowel movement?
---
The most quiet characters are males. Ace is the most quiet one in the game. But yea Bill and David aren't part of the quiet guys lol
---
Nice lol
---
Where at I dont see anything about nurse
---
Had no clue that was a thing but ill go sub on it
---
due to AIDS
---
Just because you added nurse to the joke doesn't make it your joke
---
Female Survivors are usually shorter and smaller then Male Survivors but their grunts while Injured are higher pitched
---
Male Survivors are taller and larger then Female Survivors but their grunts while injured are usually lower. (If they didn't scream bloody murder louder then the females)
---
Surprisingly for a ranged kullerthe Huntress' FOV is pretty abysmal.  Most killers don't tend to think of running Shadowborn on her.
---
It doesn't tell you what the killer is doing. He could be patrolling an area in front of you, or chasing someone else and it will go off, and it has a 30 second cool down. Plus it doesn't tell you if the killer has seen you. 
---
BUT if it works wonders for you, use it! I find that any perk in the game can work well enough. Even bad perks like Sole Survivor can either make good combos or have some clutch moments when the time is right.
---
This happens on pc too.
---
Says the guy with that username?
---
When?  Who knows.  Why?  To sell cosmetics.
---
Only 1 is leatherface being campers. Most are 95% of the time.
---
Other then that, I don't assume anything until I see it happen.
---
All I want is for his exposed meter on me to reset when I reveal him.
---
Right now the only counter to ghost face is to run across the map
---
If you're new, chances are your teammates are new and also scared. My killer rank it's pretty low so I've seen some of the dumb things new survivors do lol
---
Yo DAVID AND BILL ARE LOUD AF. LMAO
---
&gt;Says the guy with that username?
---
Yeah bud, I shit on a game that went to shit, it's not like I'm wrong in my name, you're the asshole who steals jokes, fuck yourself.
---
I may be gay, but I ain’t blind. She looks like Gollum, but I mean, if that’s what you wanna fap to, have at it.
---
what bm? you pointing? lmao thats not bm
---
Yes yu dum dum thats is obviously who you spell then
---
Oh calm down, did someone forget to take their pills??
---
Lol i considered it bm bcuz we broke all of her hex totems as soon as the game started so she was a broken hag
---
I can't tell you how many times I find Feng because of that high pitched crying (I'd probably sound like that too if I had a massive gash across my gut or whatever tbh lol)n
---
Balancing thoughts:
---
7 Tokens required to activate. 2tokens gained for safe unhook and 1token gained for protection hits. 
---
This way its 4 save unhooks (8 max per game so only 2MoM can be activated by it)
---
still leaves a condition for triggering if you can safe unhook/miss your opportunity/not the one doing the saves.
---
Thoughts?
---
Since when is her FOV less than the other killers?
---
There are other perks that perform its roll better, like spine chill for instance, a criminally underrated perk for stealth builds
---
I was so convinced it was hability... oh well, i'll have to live with the shame.
---
it looked so good but they just reverted it to the old prestige
---
hiding in lockers against huntress. You crazy bastard, I like you.
---
Lmao, imagine joking about someone having you take pills, no bud I don't rake pills, you did however show me how mature you are. Little kids love to steal jokes. Have a good day you unoriginal dick head
---
I run dead hard, adrenaline, iron will, and distortion. Mostly a toxic survivor build
---
Honestly noed is garbage on most of the killers
---
Have you heard Jeff
---
All survivors have the same hitbox.
---
Except I'm rank 1 survivor main lawlz
---
I'd be down for pallet saves counting if flash saves too also counted.
---
I think they mean it's the same as other killers even though she's ranged
---
Sure can
---
What is the joke here?
---
It's actually counter-productive to do it as Wraith since he takes all game taking out his pent up anger from being gen-rushed on the generator.
---
Again, the guy with a literal fortnite bad lol user calling someone else unoriginal
---
This is nonsense. Noed is definitely top tier perk on every killer that lacks 1-hit mechanic. With equally skilled players, killer playing pig will pretty much never stop survivors from powering exit gates.
---
Yeah, my friend was being chased so the huntress went to grab hatchets, I'm lucky she chose the wrong locker
---
Thats so cute. Hope he had fun
---
Well, supposedly, there's that Archives thing or whatever it was called that should give us more in-depth lore.
---
Well multiple people just did prove you wrong. Nice try though.
---
This has been suggested a lot. The problem is an SWF would know which survivor is fake, and then the killer’s power is useless.
---
Ehhh that works too well with BT. MoM just needs a ground up rework. Idk maybe have it negate the exposed effect for in exchange for a safe unhook or something. Idk the whole idea of the perk just doesnt work well in the meta at all.
---
I've been chasing people as killer and had to stop and put my cig out, I bet they were like "he's DCing!" lol
---
No, it wouldn't.  You can't see if killer has predator, right? Is it OP? How many killers run it? Almost noone runs Stridor, even on Spirit. Many people say it's better to play without it, because it seems like survivor is right next to you, whilst they aren't even at your lunge range.
---
Even for triple blink nurse, noed is disgustingly good perk for that 1 in million game where things go wrong. And in the rest 999 999 any other perk would be irrelevant so you should still run noed just for that 1 in a million game.
---
Oh. That makes sense though doesn't it? Even though she is ranged I feel like if they increased her FOV it would be too much of an advantage, plus the devs have said if you have too big of an FOV it'll start to clip through your character and get messy.
---
plot twist: he is AFK because some rang his doorbell.
---
Lmao imagine at a party pulling up dbd and everyone just looks at you like a moron
---
Its not tunneling if your friend leaves you for dead
---
Thanks for sharing. Same with me, but I've grown to hate playing with newer player friends as I think they should stick to solo to learn the ropes on their own instead of being taught.
---
Took the words right out of my mouth
---
He's quite dislikey by the Wraith, Hag, Doc and Joey.
---
Consoles have party chats. I don't think PC does. That's just a small flaw to PC where u can't just party chat. Having to resort to a 3 rd party chat.
---
100% they would run noed.
---
Third Seal
---
Pretty sure that's where the Doctor came from
---
Meta meta perk
---
Bubba I agree contends with the lowest spot, Pig is definitely better than Legion/Bubba/Wraith
---
That's understandable as that is actually their job, but I'm talking about match making, audio bugs, or perk/power/killer bugs.
---
Sorry for not being clear enough. I was talking about teachable perks, someone told me I should aim for those when it comes to perks.
---
One of the most memorable 4k’s I’ve ever gotten. 3 survivors left, generators just finished, I finished a chase right next to a door, so I leave the guy slugged, open the door, wait for the overly altruistic teammates to arrive, hook the guy, blood warden pops, and suddenly they’re trapped in there with me and my NOED. Endgame killer builds are my favorite because the gamble of trying to snowball after the gens are done is one of the most interesting situations to be in
---
no one knows, but Ive been asking them to do something about it since that update.
---
Point stands.
---
I feel like it would lead to some ridiculous synergies with lesser used perks and would require a ton of dev intervention. On paper it seems like a cool idea but i think the 4 perk setup is probably fine as is all things considered.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but I believe the joke is that the demogorgon actually uses tunnels as his power to burrow under ground as a form of quick traversal across the map
---
Waking up doesn't stop the slowdown if only you do it, it only reduces it.
---
See here is the thing, there is a difference between having a widely agreed opinion and being unoriginal, you blatantly stole a joke because your brain isn't fast enough to come up with your own comedy. My name however, isn't unoriginal as its general basis that most people don't like fortnite, it's mostly little kids that like fortnite because of its art style. Stuff you pos joke stealer
---
Spine Chill is pretty meta atm. Not really underrated in the slightest.
---
BBQ, Surveillance/+ Corrupt Intervention, Make Your Choice and eventually NOED (I know, I know, if feel bad)
---
Depends on the patch I guess. For most of the survivors have been massively overpowered even with no ed being used. Lately things have been better for killers though and nurse has always been the exception. 
---
I much rather face pig using noed than nurse using no perks. Its also better to face pig with noed than billy with no perks.
---
I don’t see it that often, I’m hard stuck at purple ranks atm, so maybe it’s just a red rank thing
---
Yeah I agree with you and if they really want a larger FOV they can just run shadowborn like the other guy said
---
Could be they have hit that level multiple times. Every level 100 it rolls over to level 1 again
---
With the vault pallet breaking add on hes pretty decent.
---
Sounds like every game I have playing hag.  Run devour, thrill, and ruin.  All three start getting cleansed at the same time.
---
Then it's your fault you take the stun. I see no issue here.
---
Oh, ok, thanks
---
I always do bones but only for BP :)
---
That's what I was wondering and I heard 3 or 4 different iterations of how this works, all wrong in comparison
---
Yet again did I see someone talk about a nurse? Am I wrong to say that she has exposed feet? Why do you feel the need to try and make yourself feel like you are above it all when you clearly are not?
---
Nah you just have to turn the controller and you can do it one handed
---
Devotion Levels
---
Every time you reach level 100, it is restarted to 0 and you gain a level of devotion. Maybe he had 1+ devotion
---
Exactly. Plus we don't even know *everything* about the power. I don't know why people make such bold judgements when we don't even know how it's going to work + know 0 addons.
---
Im having trouble buying stuff. I just started the game and I wanted to spend some of the auric cells I had. I bought 1.1k but it wont let me spend that? it keeps saying purchase failed.
---
Yup!
---
Would someone please answer this man?? I've been begging bhvr for double bp and recently they've responded along the lines " every thing you ask we'll push it back, see you in 2020" blah. I totally missed the BH announcement!
---
Just go around and wake your teammates up...
---
Smh so easy to counter this addon
---
The worst part is when your nose itches when on a gen
---
Except she doesn't be come unable to interact with survivors.  She is still limited by the physical world.  She runs into survivors, windows, and pallets because they are part of the physical world.  Her having collision makes perfect sense, and as others have stated, collision is one of the last things she uses to track people.  If you want her to pass through the solid object that is a survivor, then why should pallets or windows stop her?
---
It's unfortunate that you haven't learned to counterplay her yet, but you will.  But until then, don't call for a nerf just because you lack the skill to beat a mechanic.
---
and you know just as you go to itch a skill check will come up
---
Can PWYF be changed? I would change it so you lose a token after you down someone. I would really start using it and I think others would as well.
---
I cant tell if it is him drop kicking the gen or jumping off it
---
I run whispers so I'll figure it out pretty quickly hopefully lol
---
no snacks at all when huntress lullaby is active
---
I gonna say it
---
Nice move on the unhook!
---
Sometimes, yes. Other times its better to let survivors in a good spot leave, otherwise youll lose to much pressure
---
Noed is wasted perk slot. You are running most of game with only 3 perks, just so you can 'maybe' get a kill at the end. Also singular kill because that's how it is.
---
Maybe it's all changed since I hit rank 1..it was a while ago when I actually played
---
Ye, I have had literally dozens of seconds with no skill checks but as soon as I go to scratch my nose boom
---
her mother took her to hunt, of course she was old enough to know how to speak.
---
I'm pretty sure the premise is that as soon as someone learns to crouch, they start tea bagging. Lol
---
Half joke half guess.
---
Yeah. But a permanent- stealthy killer would be a good touch anyway. 
---
In a way, shape shifting is just an addition (not the main power at all). Sure, with mikes you can counter the disguise. Even so, you will play against something similar to jump-scare Myers, but with no stain and decent MS. I see this as an absolute win. 
---
Similarly, in TF2, there is spy. His primary power is to go invisible. His secondary (which can be easily countered in the same way) is shapeshifting. And he is still fine.
---
What if I want to be found? Cos I'm not a baby
---
Lmao of course not, that would make far too much sense
---
No it's not, I've already been in a chase, downed someone, hooked them and still managed to find you, the timer is too long, 60 seconds doesn't make sense at all considering it takes 20 seconds at most to heal yourself, either they should make DS where it deactivates when someone else is hooked or they need to half the time you get
---
*chainsaw makes a shotgun reload sound*
---
oh god oh fuck oh Jesus she is everywhere
---
I've been experimenting with different ways of preventing the stalk, and I just can't seem to figure it out. I'll be standing directly opposite a pallet from him, and I'll still get exposed. I need to google some youtube videos today to see if I can come up with a new strategy.
---
And I believe you completely because you said so. But I'll have to stop you there and explain that I'm actually the president so my word is better than yours. Also what field child molestation?
---
With the new Nancy perk it might be worth trapping totems. He's just ahead of the curve
---
Kira Yoshikage just wants a quiet 4k
---
Oof.
---
i can run no ruin or noed legion all the way to rank 1 he is not weak by any means. just depends on who's playing him I guess I know alot of people struggle with him
---
Yes, it is good on her.
---
Iron maiden is really only useful on hunterss for the quicker hatchet reload.
---
Ah i see, thank you

If they are unhooking right in front of you, you can easily go for the saviour. It's what I almost always do.

What is the point of his power? Seems useless if hes a 100% movement speed killer
---
Most of his perks are ok, but framed in desperation is unbelievably broken
---
Fall
---
My god you don’t read I said I wish for them to change it so that it won’t take you out of frenzy and you could hit them again but provide no progress I also said OLD DS and OLD MoM.1 NOED is the one of the only crutch perks in the game and we shouldn’t have to do totems for a chance of some BS perk to activate.2 it’s not like all totems are in a obvious area and unless your a SWF it’s highly unlikely for you to get all 5 of them
---
"people" as in yourself, also idgaf about internet points, you unoriginal dick head
---
1: I’m sorry.
---
2: I didn’t say not lose stacks on down, do lose a stack on down.
---
The main point is immune to flashlights (or the Max camera perk I made before that everyone hated), but other than that it’s just to make him able to move at a speed that actually can catch people.
---
Would be a cool thing :) I know i personally don't have the patience but props to those who do!
---
"Unoriginal" You have used the same insult like 3 times now.
---
But I'm not a child. I'm a grown man. :(
---
Shes strong because she has no limit. You can be terrible at her and fail, or be a really strong killer.
---
Get good enough though? Youre unbeatable.
---
Yes!
---
IRS not an insult it's a fact
---
IF YOU WEAR THE SCOOPS AHOY OUTFIT AND ARENT TOXIC I GIVR YOU DA HATCH also caps was on
---
In about 2 days
---
.... what? DS you had to hit a skill check which is harder than a hitting a survivor MoM required some timing so it wasn’t wasted like a little better dead hard
---
It ain't funny tho. Not with those ranks.
---
Imagine we get the last movie characters... (i mean the female version).
---
This more like a SNES
---
Dude, if you honestly think every single loop is mind gameable I’m done with this conversation. You obviously don’t understand this game.
---
Cant argue with facts
---
Tomorrow
---
This game has had useless perks since day 1, June 2016. Perks like Monstrous Shrine are never used and have never changed. Nothing we can do, BHVR wants to release more content instead of fixing old content.
---
In the Trash Bin DbD goes...
---
Yeah I guess it kinda fits that way too
---
I just said it’s to save teammates
---
Bloodhunt?
---
Teabag back. Turn it into a game. They rely on you getting pissed, so act like youre having a great time. Eventually youll believe its fun and theyll realize they cant bully you
---
And also due to stingrays which also have AIDS
---
feelsbad
---
I can;t imagine not running it on her
---
Or maybe when her Mom died she reverted to the "good times" and is stuck with her Mom's loving song on loop in her head. Forever trapped in what was.
---
Or an any years old man.
---
And he’s back again with another low effort post
---
no, that is the signal for being camped. its been the signal for being camped since the early days of the game
---
She's a lot more advanced that the Hillbilly and Bubba. Those guys are trapped at the ages of 8 and 5 respectively. And I don't even know where to start with Michael.
---
welp.
---
Distortion would be such a good perk if you had a way to regain tokens. 3 just isn't enough to justify a slot over something like spine chill/premonition, adrenaline, etc.
---
I wish Michael could transfer teabag - sad face
---
Its not toxic, its a problem with the game.
---
Streamers joke about how theyre getting genrushed, theyre not serious
---
At this point, a necessary evil. There's nothing more fun that getting with a group of four friends and demolishing killers and there's nothing more frustrating than being on the receiving end. The amount of strategy the voice chat gives you is kind of insane. But you just deal with it because the game wouldn't be nearly as good if it didn't have SWF.
---
Oh God oh fuck you're right...
---
Oh sorry It took me so long to respond, I was arguing with a random person across the street because he had the same Shirt as me. *So unoriginal...* Can you even believe that guy?
---
there's a reason why you see so many nurses and spirits at rank 1. getting other killers there can be very difficult, especially killers like plague ghostface wraith etc. it's really not as easy as I'm sure many people think. it used to be easy sure
---
That one from superbad, she had her own issues though.
---
never took that into account before, I appreciate that!
---
Now this. This. I like.
---
You need loops. And fat trees.
---
Ik. I was like "dude I play her all the time and those add-ons are her best* and he was like "Father's glasses is best"
---
One of my first matches ever I opened a locker to re-stock hatchets … SURPRISE!
---
Problem is that I shouldn't have to find some obscure approach to revealing him, when the intended way is to look straight at him. That's bad design
---
Yeah exactly if I couldn’t play with my buds the game would be so boring! We live all over so it’s basically just a medium for us to stay connected while we play a game
---
*injured Nea voices from 3 miles away*
---
Problem is an inconsistent killer is going to feel bad on both sides and be good for nobody.
---
HOLY CRAP BLOOD HUNT IS NEWS TO ME!
---
Time to get bbq 3 on all killers.
---
It also helps that for whatever reason the killer walks straight into a wall lul
---
Like how rocket league does it? I feel like that would be so hard to be a solo versus a killer
---
I mean, if I'm doing nothing, my character is faced straight at him and I have every inch of his body directly at the center of my screen, that should be a reveal, flat out
---
No killer is gonna want to play with Duos/Squads though
---
This. I don't dodge, but SWF just isn't fun to play against most of the time. Half the time there's an Object of Obsession, so I might as well d/c if I'm Ghostface, Trapper, or Hag. Or you're constantly searching for survivors but won't ever find them because your movement is being called out on comms (yes, I'm aware tracking perks exist. We only get 4 slots). I could go on, but the point is, SWF tends to suck the fun out of the killer experience.
---
I mean there’s a 3 second timer before the gen progresses again after you miss a skillcheck or a hex skill check. So you can basically do anything in those 3 seconds instead of being on the gen and risking missing another hex skill check
---
Don't see why you're getting downvoted, you're not wrong-
---
Servers can be turned on without an update so it could be September 23rd or come with the mid chapter.
---
I think it will depend on your region, but I have had the same experience on PS4. Killer main cuz of que times and with survivor you gotta deal with lobby dodging which is so lame, especially when it happens twice in a row.
---
Oh man just having Vigil remove Exposed would make it so much stronger and worth bringing to a match.
---
I generally like the events, but they have been doing so much work this year in terms of new characters/cosmetics, map updates, new material (upcoming bloodweb change, lore, SWF lobby, etc) and the soon-to-be-released dedicated servers... that I am perfectly fine with not getting a summer event. Just throwing in a random Bloodhunt is perfectly fine.
---
Thanks for that insightful reply
---
But they still didn't have to do **this** to him. 
---
I'd prefer more to see more balance changes and a Legion rework, instead of seeing more and more chapters with useless killer perks like Mindbreaker and more survivor OP perks like Inner Strength...
---
Also you may not care about "internet points" which is fair but you probably should care about everyone disagreeing with you
---
Nope. What if getting a free instaheal and sprint burst was actually hard to obtain like it currently is? That would be balanced.
---
great idea, should be implemented since its more balanced and less stupid to play against
---
Rocket League, Fortnite, PUBG, COD and hopefully soon w/ Apex. It's par for the course. You don't mix teams that can communicate with solos that can't. The perk balances over the past few years hurt solo players the most. 
---
From the killer perspective, those that aren't godly, can truly mindgame knowing they are playing against people who can't tell you where they are ... where items are etc... It would be a healthier game.
---
I'd let her hatchet me any day.
---
Especially if they patrol trap boxes really hard when people have traps on. I've had a few where it was pretty much impossible to survive because I couldnt use the boxes due to the pig camping them
---
O wow... i understand it now 😂
---
&gt;She probably learned from the animals in the woods
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Can you explain how you can use such a fucking weird generalization like that? Not relevant to the post at all. Just making a weird assumption about history for no reason.
---
fair enough. still don't get the need to point at someone who already knows they should have tried harder on the skillcheck lol like what's pointing really going to accomplish anyway?
---
This Is.... Requium
---
There are anti immersion perks. If he doesn't like stealth just run those.
---
You still can't tell between the killer lagswitching and somebody on the killers WiFi downloading anything. Stop being so insane.
---
Are you thinking I'm the guy I responded to? Because I replied to him for a reason.
---
Ya this, it would lead to balancing nightmares. Also it sounds nice to give lesser perks a chance to be used but whats actually going to happen is someone will math-hammer the best 5 or 6 perks to use together and everyone would just run those instead.
---
Forget eatting, BHVR uses your webcam to give a skill check the second you take your hand off to rub your nose.
---
But not Claudette?
---
Makes you wonder how Hillbilly survived for all those years before Daddy E snatched him up.
---
official source?
---
The dance of the savages.
---
Was that Jaws Freddy? Were you the guy who streamed that?
---
Pictures with threatening auras
---
dont all of the games you mentioned have in game comms, so mixing solo with a group is the same,  Unless of course you choose to not communicate.
---
Might as well been her teachable tbh.
---
That's not true. There are really good killers that enjoy the challenge and will do it. Duos, gives you two teams and you can pick off one of each and have some fun with it. 
---
However, SWF is killing this game for both solo players and killers. You can't balance it. They've tried and it's not working.
---
He was. You have 100% guaranteed down on every killer. The thing is how many gens will pop during that chase. With Legion you had to hit survivors 4 times... Not effective at all. With Freddy you had to wait only 7 seconds and hit survivor only twice. With add-ons it was even shorter time and first hit was almost always guaranteed. 
---
Legion&lt;Freddy.
---
Well if you recognize a name and know they main a certain killer, you’d be able to prepare more for it. Like hey this guy always plays Doctor, I should use Calm Spirit! That would be a problem. However with that being said, I don’t think the killer should be able to see the survivors names in the lobby either.
---
To stalk some one you need to see like 1 pixel of them.
---
As a recent comment said, there are gaps in the wall of the killer shag.
---
Some times a mesh is blocking his hitbox, even if i can clearly see them, but gaps in walls are from what i saw really easy to see true the gaps.
---
I wonder how that will work on The Game.
---
Aw :(
---
On xbox once the game starts and you're in the loading screen, all players in the match are added to your recent players so I often have disconnects in my survivor games. 
---
I think it works the same for ps4 too? Not sure
---
no
---
And jumping in a locker instead of vaulting a window...
---
I have a couple questions about the emblems for killer. For Chaser, is it better to hit a survivor once and then move on to another or keep going? Does it end the chase event after the first hit or does it keep going? For Malicious, do you lose any points for downed survivors getting healed to injured?
---
Yeah, head on, firecrackers, anything that stuns the killer while they're carrying someone
---
I mean the real actress is hot. Their model is bleh.
---
Hi everyone,
---
I'm a film director from Manitoba. This is the very first photo I've released of our protagonist in his full costume, I also play DBD and discovered a similar outfit to my killer.
---
Thought I'd share this with you guys. I'll be entering production this October, it's an 80's slasher film.
---
Oh yea loud too lol
---
I legit thought that's what it was called the first time I read it
---
Nah, I'm too lazy for this. And it wouldn't be as good as the official DBD version of *Who The Fuck?.*
---
That’s the stuff I’ve been using. I’m kind of after some specific Killer builds
---
I like running ghostface with bbq and chili ruin thrilling tremors and noed. I also like playing doctor with bbq and chili ruin distressting and o overwhelming presence.
---
Ohhh i've never thought about that
---
Yeah I'm just talking about in general though
---
Nurse is the best killer in the game, if you can master her blinks. There’s absolutely zero counter play because she completely ignores all of a survivors most useful tools (pallets, loops, etc.). Throw some detection/tracking perks on her and you’ll never lose
---
Your correction made the scentence incorrect
---
God I hate this but I love it so much, god damn it Goofy
---
cuz they don't? lol
---
Thanks I’ll give them a go.
---
OR goes back to a post I made earlier on this sub but to add in some additional objectives for both sides to do that could slow down the game and make it more interesting. Obviously jerks will always be jerks but groups like my friends who aren’t trying to be bullies could really enjoy having some extra tasks....
---
Still kinda creepy, it’s a high school student.
---
Down the survivors and leave them down; dont hook
---
That costume is so cool holy crap
---
yup, i dont see this happen among solo players. We all like to shit on the game but this just isnt true
---
Freddy with PGTW, BBQ, Discordance, and Thrilling Tremors
---

She is really good but imo not that fun to play. If you want to however it looks like it will take a lot of time and patience to get good with her

For the most part yes, except for when she dies
---
Thank you! It's rather intimidating in person. The knife is fairly big too, and it's real. (We'll be using a dummy one on set.)

Wow, that inspires me to try!

If it’s not too much to ask, what are the best perks to use ?

Is she not that fun to play with *before* you master her or after?
---
Mending was a bug, Frank's Mix Tape was OP, every add-on got heavily nerfed, he was never loopable because of his power, now he's just as loopable as every other killer, now he has a counterplay, he counters himself, he's just too bad, he was strong with mix tape, but only with it, it's like saying that huntress is better than billy because of iridescent head xD.
---
I feel as though in the Fog, the Killers' weapons are a part of them. They can't be separated from them or have them stolen - hell, Rin literally summons her katana from a shard of her own murder weapon, still embedded in her flesh.
---
Not much of a stretch to say that they can't be disarmed or have their own weapons used against them.
---
I like to think I'm fairly healthy.
---
you aren’t a clown, you’re the whole circus!
---
Some may want the challenge, but not many. People are having difficulty just trying to rank up against solos alone, nonetheless duos/squads. Thing is I guess we’d never know how popular it would be unless they try it out.
---
Agree with Pig but disagree with Bubba. He's better than Legion when in the right hands IMO.
---
No. I disagree with you both. I just disagree with you more, m8.
---
But then what happens when he goes up to 100% power?
---
Before after I don't know I still did meh with her it's just I prefer a different playstyle
---
Quick and quiet is more useful than distortion (at least in my experience as the only toke my aura is being read is from bbq and chili) it’s good for quickly jumping into lockers to hide both your aura and occasionally to lose chase
---
its a new-ish bug they for some reason have yet to fix. although usually i think its just one person that cant escape though the exits and the only way to avoid EGC death is to find the hatch.
---
Survivors learning to cope when the killer doesn't play by their rules
---
-Colorized 2019
---
Then you shouldn't have problems with getting to rank 1. Just use good perks and decent add-ons, use headphones and you're ok.
---
That's such an intimidating costume.  It looks like a near perfect blend between Legion and Ghostface!
---
I hate to be snarky but that's literally the solution. The answer to "how do I beat *toxic* survivors" is the same as "how do I beat survivors".
---
Watch YouTube videos and get better or, more easily, don't let them get to you, it's just a game
---
You disagree that people existed before recorded history? That's a really hot take dude see where that takes you in life.
---
Who’s your main killer?
---
But many pallets being borderline useless because they have a 2 foot path around them that leads to killer and survivor doing this awkward tap dance game for 3 seconds is okay, amirite?
---
[Looking at you Circus chapel.](https://youtu.be/chNS-uFlXsA?t=149)
---
I'm the pig in the video btw.
---
Pointing out how salty he is during a discussion of high level salty players got me banned from DeadbyDaylight's Twitch. Fun times.  
---
I've played alongside him a couple times now, and he's okay - not as good as he likes to say, but generally okay. I think a chunk of his personality is actually persona: toxicity like his is what a lot of the community flocks to.
---
I do that all the time. 
---
So far I lucked out more then not.
---
That's amazing!
---
I play a variety but right now probably a tie between trapper and Myers
---
Piss off ghost!
---
I'm sorry little one
---
r/whoosh
---
There's plenty of killers that beat most of any SWF they come across.
---
Alright! I hope that the new killer will add a unique element to the game. Would be fun!
---
Ah okay, there were two left so no hatch, i was trying to get her to try the other gate, but their swf group was being toxic the whole game so they probably thought i'd just kill them lol
---
I completely understand what you're saying. I dont dodge lobbies but very quickly in the game i can tell who's the killer and change how i play immediately because i've played with them before. I imagine a lot of players would change their perks in the lobby when they see "basementlover20" is killer. 
---
Im glad you acknowledged that applies to survivors too though. If I see the same claudette who looped me for the whole match in my lobby, im not going to want to play against her.
---
bbq and chilli, dearstalker, ruin and nurses calling and i personally dont find it fun to play her, as a "good" nurse myself she wins every time but its not fun to play.
---
Fuck... u got me
---
I disagree that they were all a bunch of sexual deviants. The fact that you can't be respectful kinda makes me wish I didn't engage you and your stupid ideas for as long as I have.
---
It would actually improve lobby times as you would not be queuing the same modes together. But you are correct, it's probably too much work for them to do. But it should be much easier when dedicated servers arrive over the next few weeks. 
---
As the game grows, more people are going to be turned off to the poor balancing in this game and after 3 years it's not getting any better.  There's an appetite for both and they need to be properly respected and implemented. When Apex (a 3 player game) implemented solo matches last week their servers were overwhelmed and it was really fun playing by yourself, I hope they keep that mode.
---
I'm just saying, if I hook someone, and see a claudette cosplaying as a wall before making a mad dash while I kick a gen... Why on earth would I just walk away?
---
&gt; It's super toxic though and **you could get negative messages**.
---
So just like with other way to play the game?
---
Big facts
---
I often get the Nurse for dailies on PS4 and I'm horrible at blinking but I eventually get all four hits eventually over at least two (rare occasion three) games.  She's fun.  She's like the shortest character so that changes up on some of the maps work.
---
What? See now I'm really wondering what you read because I never said they were sexual deviants. This causes me concern.
---
Thanks !! 
---
What makes her not fun to play? Does it become repetitive due to her being OP in the right hands?
---
That’s something I enjoy with The Huntress, her axe never gets boring (*if you hit them*)
---
She is 24 year old, you are just gay.
---
I stopped following that guy when I watched his streams. He's a terrible killer, I wondered why he complained so much about survivors, but watching him play I realized it was because he's garbage. Tunnels/camps just about every match. And his opinion is the end all-be all and he's never wrong. Fuck that guy
---
Well... there is one exposed that should be affected by vigil, Make Your Choice. So... it's still useless. nIcE
---
They never announce it iirc
---
You shouldn't. But the matchmaking system is so amazing that it'll put a rank 18 survivor with a rank 8 killer etc.
---
It's an excellent perk on her that reinforces her snowball potential.
---
Nice ad-hominem there at the end, really helps you get your point across.
---
My point is, objects and living beings are clearly treated differently in the ethereal plane and thus this whole "proper physics" argument is pretty shite. 
---
The spirit never interacts directly with the survivors while phasing and is only able to read and interpret what they do to the objects around them (scratch marks, sounds, etc), otherwise she would be able to hit or grab them.
---
I would actually love a map with water :D
---
Clearly a legit start. Clearly not what OP is memeing
---
The nurse greatest (and only) weakness is being able to locate survivors, so perks that assist you in locating them (Whispers, BBQ, etc.) are always a good choice
---
Just to be clear, "Taking on for the team" requires you to get a protection hit near the hook. An 'unsafe unhook' means they got downed within a few seconds of being unhooked, as opposed to a 'safe unhook', which is the scoring event you get when the survivor you've unhook remains standing for 10 seconds after being unhooked. Basically free if you run BT.
---
Wow I never knew where this came from.
---
It’s worth it to learn every killer. Nothing against people that play one or two killers, but you can’t really call yourself a killer main if you play two killers.
---
Also it may not have helped but my main killer was my gamer pic so that would throw it away lol
---
Any kind of detection or tracking perk is Nurse's best friend. Her main weakness is her own lack of tracking. Surveillance, Thrilling Tremors, or Discordance help you figure out which generators are being worked on, and her own perk  (A Nurse's Calling) helps you find survivors if they manage to escape you after you hit them. I'm All Ears can be pretty good as well.
---
A lot of people like Monitor and Abuse to increase your field of view and reduce your terror radius. If you want to be *really* nasty, use Make Your Choice Hook your victim, blink away, blink back and insteadown the rescuer as soon as they're saved. Stack up Devour Hope like a boss, if you feel like it.
---
Dedicated servers will be nice! Hopefully you’re right and that’ll give them a little more control over their lobbies. 
---
A lot of people argue that it’s the toxicity that makes people leave this game and I understand that’s a valid point but I mean look at the fortnite community. I don’t know a more annoying group of folks lol and it’s still a MASSIVE game. I think you’re right; ultimately it will be mechanics and lack of updates/changes that make DBD fall off. Perhaps though with growth they will be able to develop more mechanics and keep the game fresh :)
---
I like you’re idea of separate cues I think it makes sense. Maybe killers could just have one queue to get in but it shows who is in a group and who isn’t so that they could decide if they want to play it.
---
Fudge
---
Except... they do though. They even specifically said "Dont worry, we'll announce it" when people were clamoring about it on the forums.
---
Damn I haven’t had time to play. It changes tomorrow or tomorrow is my last chance?
---
Good point there. With perks like "tinkerer" he must be somewhat intelligent.
---
It happened to me some months ago. The funny thing is that I got hooked and then a team mate rescued me, I got healed, did a gen and it passed a long time before the killer saw me again and chased me. When I downed me for the second time the killer picked me up and I got saved by the decisive I hitter like 10 minutes ago without any skill check or anything to do.
---
I thought it was Gene Simmons for a spit second.
---
bruh that guy could split those women in half
---
I see no problem there, it is habit+ability = hability to kill, exactly what every killer needs to have.
---
I like the caption, but I make this meme as a Killer Main who plays very little survivor
---
It's not fun getting stomped while you're learning her; a lot of Killer players see her as unfun even when mastered because it's hard for Survivors to effectively challenge a skilled Nurse. YMMV.
---
I think it’ll be $9.99
---
I know some killers can do it but I feel like the majority can’t 4K. Jerk SWF will always be jerks but you’re right it could be nice to make the game a little harder. Or as I said above give some extra objectives for SWFs to do. Because I know for my group we really just want to have fun not really escape. It would be cool to have a machine you could work on for 45 seconds and if you finish it you release smoke onto the map for a while or something idk..
---
That's also a problem. In the quest to become a red rank, most players end up ruining their own experience. That too needs a complete rework. Player leveling is a start and something they can build on, but the current rank and reset needs to be scrapped in favor of something longer term and more rewarding.
---
I'm just hitting that meme to my guy apparantly I hit to close to home for some survivor mains.
---
My gf build is bbq, thrilling tremors, enduring, and overcharge
---
Yeah once dedicated survivors come, hell I don’t even think there should be a lobby! You don’t need to see ping anymore.  Ready up and the next screen you see is the offerings. You’ll find out who the other players are when it starts.
---
This is the _no_ stupid questions thread. You must have misread :D
---
Yeah I bought the dlc cause of ash, but don't really want to use him since the killer can hear you grunting from the other side of the map.
---
Lmao 😂 he 😂 said 😂 shirtless 😂 Myers 😂 comedy 😂 gold! 😂  
---
Oh 😂 man 😂 next 😂 thing 😂 you'll 😂 tell 😂 me 😂 Nea 😂 is 😂 secretly 😂the 😂 Entity!😂
---
What does SFW stand for. I'm sorta new
---
Aww cmon panda. You're better than this. Make a better meme.
---
This is gold and I wish I could give it gold.
---
DAE SHIRTLESS MYERS FUNNY 😂
---
Imagine being so salty  that u need to act like a cunt in a shitpost
---
Yea impact font in 2019 in a non ironic meme
---
bbq and chili, hex ruin, pop goes the weasel and enduring
---
The only differences between survivors are:
---
* Their size
---
* Their normal breathing sounds
---
* Their sound when injured
---
I believe Otzdarva did a video comparing the survivors on those attributes a few weeks back.
---
God, I hope they ban people who use it. I'm tired of lobby dodgers that add me to their list because I use mori's and smoke their asses.
---
Ahhhh so much clearer
---
what killers do you play?
---
Yeah the reset is way too quick and some of the emblems are quite bs and not worth it to get to rank 1 (unless you like achievements). One step at a time, though
---
Seriously Babysitter is so fucking bad because of the dual Aura reveal. I understand the concept but it should really give you a Mettle of Man effect or something to make it worthwhile. As it is currently it's a perk which fucks you over a lot of the time.
---
Tbh even in purple ranks you still see this very often. Only really red ranks is free from tunnellers and campers. Since there's no real incentive to climb ranks in the game, they don't care much about playing like a twat and black-pipping. Means they can avoid the red-rank survivors who will absolutely take the piss outta them too. It's punished but tbh? Not punished remotely hard enough. Should lose a lot of points for tunnel/camping but atm you only really lose points when camping within 10m of the hook, so most 'smart' ones play around that.
---
I play killer just for fun, so don’t really main anyone. I just like keeping it fresh Playin new builds
---
Yeah you can use the recent players on PS4, as long as you and the killer don’t have the option clicked to where you aren’t shown as being online.
---
It has to do with being grabbed off the unhook, pretty sure, since the same happened to me.
---
Yup. I saw that. Thx
---
Fortnite is free. That is why it's so massive. If DBD daylight was F2P, it would have tens of thousands if not more playing on top of what's there. Despite it's glaring flaws, it's so additive.
---
Killers get the brunt of this and should be able to choose lobbies as well. That's the point. You know what you're getting into in advance, so no complaining. I know there will be hate from the SWF side, but that is where the toxicity steams from and again, in three years, it has not balanced the game.
---
The only other solution is to allow for us to block players, if that's even possbile. So we can never match up with them again.
---
Second Wind yeet
---
Must be nice, even if you're shown as offline on xbox it still shows everyone in the match
---
"Hey we can see eachother! Time to get use out of Prove Thyself!" 4head
---
Eh, killers are in 1st person so this happens a lot lmao
---
Use shadowborn for the flex
---
It happens sometimes.
---
yes correct, i was thinking more along the lines of the total resources in game, as is if more than 2 people have the perk it gets considerably harder to achieve, so it auto-regulates itself in SWF.
---
Just about
---
I hadn't played on PS for a long time and was reset to 20. Needless to say, I was rank 10 within 2 days of marathon plays. I made life hard on killers for 15 -20. I wasn't doing anything toxic, but I can juke, loop and 360 really well. Those couldn't down me if they tried and the sad part was ... they were trying.
---
You start to work on a gen. Counts as gen rushing. It’s in the killer rule book for survivors.
---
I might recommend running them through the basics in a KYF lobby. If you duo with a rank 20 as a red rank, it's going to give you a killer in the mid ranks typically. You're going to have a clown fiesta of a match. Also inb4 mid-rank killers complaining about red ranks showing up in their games.
---
This is an interesting idea but golly bob howdy is this easy to abuse. If it would still remove Exhaustion you could probably just loop around a Quentin in a locker with semi-infinite Sprint Burst.
---
I actually had to check if you were a troll account so you’re doing it pretty well but starting constant arguments on every sub is an unfortunate giveaway.

Tunneling is so annoying. Atleast if someone camps me my team will do well if they dont try to save me🤔
---
You mispelt Meg
---
The "right" way of playing him was by using monitor and abuse and using the aura reading + very low terror radius to basicly play a fast mirror myers
---
But I dont so arent you trolling me or something?
---
Survive with Friends, so you're playing with buddies rather than solo
---
Seriously though as someone who plays a lot of Wraith I'm so hyped for Mindbreaker. Finally a perk to counter "I uncloak behind the gen annnnnnnd they're gone"
---
For killers: Huntress, Pig, Wraith, Nurse, Hag, Spirit, Susie and Joey.
---
For Survivors: Pretty much all of them except for Ash. For him it's a Tuesday
---
Yeah they could do the same as what OW does which is making the player play a bunch of games and chooses the most relevant rank for them. I just feel bad for the baby survivors/killers.
---
Hell, I wouldn't mind being on either side of the program. I'm confident enough to teach new players but I could always use some tips from more seasoned veterans on my routes.
---
You know what you bring an excellent point.
---
Creepy, I like it
---
They made the right call with the killer being there. Sucks for you, but killer camping was revealed to them.
---
If you looped around a Quentin, you could sprint burst every 30 seconds. This would be a 10-second shave off the regular 40-second Exhaustion has anyway.
---
Strong? Yes, but I don't think it's broken as it requires great communication and for the Quentin to not be doing the objective.
---
I liked to be wined and dined before I get **fucked**
---
All it takes is *one* well hidden totem for that tactic to cause you to shoot yourself in the foot.
---
Cleanse four easy to find totems and now *congratulations* NOED is well hidden when you would've had a 4/5 chance of knowing it's location.
---
LMFAO!! YES! See, this survivor main knows how to joke around, I fucking love it!
---
It really sucks as killer. For survivor I still slightly prefer low ranks but high ranks are still mostly enjoyable, you just get slightly more Billys/spirits/actually good nurses. You can still have a great game against a sweaty high tier killer though, but killer at top tier feels like 9/10 games are swf in voice comms who will be able to easily genrush and loop you. And I hope you weren't planning on playing wraith, bubba, clown or legion, you're extra fucked then.
---
Literally none of the killer perks he listed are good. Like I'd ever see a baby  Dwight with Chili lmao
---
My friend called it "A mix between Edward Scissorhands and Ghostface".
---
Chaser - Once you hit someone, a new chase is started and points awarded for the hit.   As for building points in this area, you can farm it by letting them go, but that isn't feasible for teams that gen rush you.   If you can down them quickly, just finish the chase and get the extra points.  
---
Malicious - Yes.   Healing causes you to lose points in this area.
---
Yeah that’s every survivor ever
---
What 😂 do 😂 you 😂 mean? 😂 This 😂 joke 😂 has 😂 me 😂 in 😂 absolute 😂 hysterics! 😂 I've 😂 never 😂 seen 😂 it 😂 before! 😂
---
She came in to heal it's the same default action. But that was nice.
---
Exactly the joke
---
Then when your in a chase with him he says Zoinks
---
Lol so killers just show up and get a free pip at rank 1?  Fuck off with that silliness man.
---
If I get a SWF I know are optimal gen rushers I'll throw NOED on when I'm a low tier killer like Trapper or Bubba tbh. No reason not to really.
---
Shirtless Myles = h o t

This is not just wood. It's my home!

---
When you unhook a survivor, the unhooked survivor leaves no scratch marks and blood trail for the next 4/6/8 seconds.
---
You see the killer’s aura and the killer sees your aura for 4/4/4 seconds 
---
If the unhook is safe, gain 100% more bloodpoints in the altruism category.

Kindred is 16 meters at tier 3.
---
Oh boy, I will be rich after selling this salt mine right here lmao
---
Tunneling is a strategy. Knocking a survivor out of the game slows it down drastically. The only thing that makes it weak are perks like DS and borrowed time.
---
xD
---
Can you not "smoke their asses" without mories or what? Do you always feel the need to get carried by strong shit to win?
---
Then your sitting there on the floor like "wack."
---
Yes teachable become available once you get a character to levels 30,35, and 40 in the bloodweb. Each character has their own teachables so if you are starting as a player you will only see basic perks and your character's specific perks until you start to learn teachables. 
---
So what will happen is when you hit 30 you will see two perks on the web, a teachable and another perk. Once you select the teachable that perk will start appearing in the other survivors or killers' blood webs. A common misconception is that once you learn a teachable it is instantly learned by all other characters that can learn it. All it does is make it available to appear in the blood webs. For example I leveled up david for "We're going to live forever" the next survivor I leveled up i didn't see the perk until I got to around level 34. Though the next survivor got it on their second web. 
---
As far as perks to focus on learning to get in all the bloodwebs. I always recommend Fang Min's perks of alert and lithe on the survivor side. I also recommend Bond and or Empathy as well for teachable as they are great at keeping track of the other survivors. Distortion is worth investing in if you have the shards for it since it is on the shrine and helps you know if and what aura perks the killer has. 
---
For the killer side I have been a big fan of surveillance and make your choice from the pig. BBQ from Leather face is a standard killer perk and is actually on the shrine. Honestly if you have to choice between BBQ and distortion I would strongly advise going with BBQ. Other killer perks that are great are ruin, brutal strength, spirit fury, and pop goes the weasel
---
Ya tunneling gives you more time, something the killer lacks. It's only weak in cases like DS(where you just slug to gain the same time benefit anyway), and borrowed time. If you know the unhooker doesn't have borrowed, then it's better to tunnel.
---
Yes! Okay, so this happened to me too, but it happened while I was near a hook too, which is in the same situation here as the gif.
---
I get hit near a hook, hit my DS, he hooks my anyways, later get chased, get downed, and DS hits him then.
---
My match was laggy however.
---
I have 137 bodyblocker hag add-on sets
---
You are so cringe, lmao
---
I read the last bit Saminations trapper voice
---
Holy shit how many hours do you have?
---
Wraith also gets the first hit for free.
---
Oooh I'd love those. I don't enjoy playing Hag unless I am using that add-on.
---
But how does that make you feel, Deadlite?
---
I enjoy the screams....
---
Uh Oh.
---
Amused.
---
1183
---
Survivors don't get much of a punishment either and that annoys me most.
---
#ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY GET DOWNED IN THE FIRST THIRTY SECONDS AFTER TBAGGIN.
---
It annoys me when someone gets super upset because they thought they were jukemaster360 and then insta dc because of poor placement when we still have 5 gens left because someone is being immersed in a locker and the only other person that was doing a gen is now being chased.
---
Not as popular, it's not going to happen unfortunately.
---
Add me on discord cause it's easier than looking thru 12k I'm baby's on steam. Rezyl#6326
---
Off the top of my head, only 2 killers would run iron maiden at rank 1. Huntress or Doctor. But NOED is terrible on Huntress, so is baby Dwight facing an Doctor with no distressing?
---
I am still new to all the lingo but I guess I would be called a tunneler or camper. That is because I use Hag and always trap the hook and TP to it. I feel bad for the people I play against because I feel like it is real annoying but it's the only way to use Hag. I try to empathize with the survivors but at the end of the day it is a ranked competitive game and my strategy works.
---
Yeah that would be a ton of fun.  Only been playing for about a month myself but made it to red ranks with a fair amount of knowledge on how to play.
---
Jokes on you. Whenever I play survivor and I touch the gen I say "initiating genrush procedure"
---
Most of the high profile streamers have a staggering amount of arrogance flimsily supported by a cult following.  If you aren't a "Yes Man", be prepared for a ban.
---
No mither, we're going to live forever, boil over, flip flop, wake up, all of aces perks,
---
I get blinded hella easily when I play Spirit
---
I have 35 morís waiting for the 2xbp event I can smell the salt coming to me
---
Gotcha, no one ever uses it so I thought it was 12 meters on all tiers.
---
Maybe not, but rank 2,3, and 4 run it. 🤷‍♂️
---
5. Seem to be a balanced number and not too overwhelming on smaller maps
---
New perk kill the gens 
---
You can destory a gen with a mori
---
"Begone power" the doctor

---
I'm too shy to do this myself but I've done this with a few friends. They all say having had me play with them has really helped them to develop, so this sounds like a very good idea!
---
this is so sad can we hit 50 likes
---
Players playing killer can see survivor players (and even their items and profiles), and dodge them. And they do it all the time. Why should players playing survivor not also be able to?
---
Seems like a stock photo, but what it could be for is a true mystery.
---
&gt;Does it become repetitive due to her being OP in the right hands?
---
shes repetitive and sweaty to the max
---
I've used Premonition and just kept looking around when on a generator. Idk if its a very good idea tho
---
I run the same build on my Feng and soon to be steve. Its really solid and good in escaping chases, especially with iron woll
---
But wouldn’t she be the ultimate killer *against* those sweaty survivors?
---
I´d love to join this! Sadly, i doubt there are players from LAS here :(
---
I agree, drop kicking a gen is 10x more effective then stomping
---
Dance With Me, perhaps?
---
it always made me weirded out too
---
now i just imagine the killer stuck a knife up her butt
---
Trapper.
---
He might be scary against lower ranks but he's a powerless m1 killer in reds. One survivor clocks you at 32 meters and that's it. I'll be lucky to get 2 exposed effects in an entire game in red ranks
---
Yeah Nurse, Spirit with purples and Mories agree. Survivors have broken staff too btw.
---
It needs to be matt, the final boss of all wii sport resort minigames
---
I wish I could use adrenaline but my friends are so bad we never get 5 gens done
---
Adrenaline, DS, WGLF, Balanced Landing, Deliverance
---
None of them are really scary when you play long enough. Even jump scare killers just get annoying after a while.
---
That'd be amazing. But don't know about the killer.
---
None of those perks need a rework lol
---
Cannibal is good simply to get one of  his teachable barbecue and chili however it’s in the shrine right now so get it. He also has a simple power. Shape is also a good pick after getting some teachables and having some experience. If you want to get into hard but good killers hillbilly and nurse are your choice they will require a lot of practice especially nurse. But they are very fun and good so it’s up to you.
---
&gt;Seriously, what is it with people and this give shit?  You earn your kills, or your escapes.  Don't fucking cry about it after.  Consider what you did right, and what you did wrong, and learn from it.  Stop being a little bitch and whining about being given shit.  
---
&gt;As a killer, I would rather get shit on every game, then have people give me the win.
---
**Fucking SCREAM this for the community members in the back, please.**
---
Yes they do, a rework doesn't always mean buffs
---
If you are a low rank killer then I would recommend getting leatherface or playing Billy, the chainsaw will let you insta down survivors and bbq from leather is a great BP farm as well as auras.
---
Consistently? Nah
---
It has come to the point where the subreddit has more quality than the actual game
---
I think 14(?) seasons for the world to see is more than enough of them. 😅
---
That's not true.  I've carried 3 scrub randoms countless times while I ran the killer for minutes performances unhooks and got gold or Iri lightbringer just to be hooked at the end and for the 3 of them to just peace out the exit gate immediately.  In your system they pip I don't.  There is a reason the emblems exist and it isn't just based off straight kills/survival.
---
Since I am unaware, what is the achievement?
---
Thank god it’s not just me
---
It would be fucking nuts
---
that made me laugh
---
amazing
---
I play pc and I'm not the best, but been playing for years by this point so I have decent advice. I'd be more than happy to help out if needed.
---
i didnt say she wasnt poweful im saying that shes extremely tryhard, sweaty and unfun to use her power
---
I know but I’m asking you a question, she’d be great against those type of survivors right? :)
---
These people are anti fun.
---
fuckin slippery meat just needs to be deleted
---
Maybe the demon that killed their mother?
---
Still balanced for outcomes, but high ranks killers will likely depip.
---
All the new players coming from stranger things are the freshmen of high school

This is a great idea I'm in

Nice a copy of ghostface who is a copy of Micheal Myers btw good luck

*Checks archive which are my messages...*
---
Probably this P3 meg I played against as gf, bagged at ever pallet and I wound up getting a 4K in the end. He message me saying “Nice tunnel you loser” when in reality he was the last guy and I had no other choice but to tunnel him.
---
I had a similar experience. I was playing Huntress as usual, and had a fairly decent match. I managed to get 2 kills with 3 gens remaining, leaving a Bill and a Meg. Once I downed Bill I looked around to find Meg, and eventually I slugged them both. Then I let Bill go, and heal Meg up while I backed up to get outside the 24m range of "Skilled Huntress". But Bill took this as an opportunity to bail and leave Meg to die. So change of plans again; I got rid of Bill, and brought Meg to a gen. Let her do the last 3, then guided her to the gate. Got some thanks in her post game messages too. I knew that trophy is basicly impossible to get, so I'm glad I could help at least 1 person get it
---
Hmmm...smells like Pharmacy
---
Makes sense, though that rate does shock me. Most of my 3-4 k games are survivors sticking together, sending 2 guys for hooks saves, 2 manning gens etc (discordance seem like a wasted perk vs very good teams). It seems to be greatly overlooked the simple fact that there are 4 survivors and only 1 killer in a game that boils down to controlling multiple areas of the map at one time. I wonder how the balance of rank 1 killers is vs survivors, i.e. are there 4 survivors at rank 1 for every one killer at rank one (balanced for population ratio)or is it a lot more lopsided amount.
---
I mean.. he’s right about the demogorgon
---
Pig main here, last night i managed to down a full team of red ranks in the first 5 minutes and RBT all of them. 2 of them DC'd and the other 2 had unbreakable, which didnt help them at all. I got hate from 3 people after that match.
---
That's why I changed my skill check button to my mouse so my other hand is free to eat and itch my nose lol
---
That's their fault for not crouching to avoid your traps. The hag is supposed to make survivors afraid to run around.
---
Every killer mains messages are a salt mine. And it's beautiful.
---
Killer main but this actually happened as survivor: I got facecamped but my fellow survivors noticed and went on to finish a gen and escaped through hatch.
---
Afterwards in end chat, the killer commented their "facecamper noob" remarks with "eating popcorn; I could've easily killed y'all" (I was their first hook).
---
I just let it go, since you can't teach stupidity something new but one survivor main spammed the chat (100messages/min) afterwards.
---
If you don't get a salty message you are not playing killer right
---
Damn this looks really good dude good job
---
It is (as I know almost exclusively) done with fragrant tuft of hair and Judith myers tombstone. The problem with that is the tombstone makes you slower and it takes soooo long to tier up from tier 2 to 3 and usually by the time that you have tier 3 ( if you even have) the generators are done or there is only 1 or 2 gens left.
---
Read the rules; don't advertise exploits
---
It just sounds like you want to get rid of every survivor perk that actually helps survivors. What’s your opinion on NOED?
---
However just last game I got a nice message from survivor it freaked me out
---
Ah, a fellow oinker. Some people just can't handle  a loss I guess.
---
Once you can 1 hit down survivor or 1 hit mori
---
This is exactly me. My account is level 15 and I'm just trying to get some actual perks and actual experience.  
---
NOED has its uses when you, like me, are a plank.
---
Psst, you can completely avoid BT by going for the unhooker
---
I work for a company that develops computer aided design software. 
---
Please BHVR let's do business. We're partners with AutoCAD (which is what you use) and we have automatic model healing capabilities. I get a commission check and Nea no longer has triangles coming out of her butt. We both win.
---
They didnt have the will to live, which is why they lost.
---
Tier 4 Myers
---
Exactly, killers are getting no buffs and only nerfs, all of you love using crutch perks but at the same time complain about crutch killer perks, all of you complain about ruin in every match but if they don't have ruin them are fucked unless it's nurse. The devs favor survivors main all the time and yet y'all still beg for better perks, while killers still don't have almost any good perks
---
Yeah in the next chapter, you will be able to keep your SWF group so you won’t have to re-invite them every time you wanna play a round (or any time the killer dodges). It will all be done through the game itself, instead of through steam.
---
When the survivors keep coming back and rushing the same gen after you keep scattering them
---
i dont play leatherface is a better pick up line IMO
---
Second
---
"Kung-Fu Myers"
---
It almost sounds like I'm summoning a demon
---
I wish I could derank overnight.
---
I have to dc’d a shit ton to make that happen.
---
Actually not really, because the person with borrowed time can take a free hit for the unhooked making it so if you have 1 survivor hooked at endgame and they get saved with borrowed then you lost
---
Yeah there is Also the problem of them dc or hiding in a locker forcing you to grab them and not kill them.
---
This might be a time for it to be ok to ask the survivors to farm with you
---
Kikck that micky
---
Mom didn’t let me watch that because we were too rich
---
Useless. That wastes so much time. Killers can find you with Nurses, Deerstalker etc. the killer can simply use his mic to hear your cries you be be hidden with Knockout. Just recover then and there.
---
That's pretty peak.
---
WGLF? A perk that only gives BP needs a nerf? Deliverance? A perk that only works if you are not found first and completely removes the ability to heal after? Balanced Landing one of the best exhaustion perks that is at the same time situational? DS? Was reworked. Adrenaline? It's a one time use late game, try to not let survivors reach the end.
---
Nah, I don’t stream
---
Step 1: \*Turn it off and on again\* (basically, close your DBD app and restart it)
---
Step 2: Check If there is some downtime with any of your providers, it might cause this problem because of a missed communication between the game and the 1st party. Checking if a 1st party or the game itself has issues (DBD / PS4 / XBOX / Steam / ISP) could be a solution. 
---
Step 3: If none of this worked, you can go to [support.deadbydaylight.com](https://support.deadbydaylight.com) and open a ticket with our customer support.
---
I have the high ground!
---
You wa t to call him last?
---
Thanks for clearing that up.
---
We're gonna live forever doesn't heal faster. I don't even understand why WGLF needs a nerf lol. It's a bloodpoint perk
---
Which is a shame, because he looks really cool. I loved the peak around shit.
---
Well here's the thing, gens do get done too fast, most killers have no way of stopping gens unless they run meta builds, so if you guys run DS and Adrenaline and meta perks, then ideas about people using noed. Survivors perks that are very strong don't go away, you can constantly use Dead hard, you can always use BL, u can always use these perks, most killer perks however have a timer until they become useless or they can be destroyed making them useless
---
“I’m going to go find a totem so I can scratch my balls”
---
Half right
---
This is so fucking true. But honestly I have just started playing killers I have fun with and I'm chilling in purple ranks. 
---
Sometimes I get pissed after full SWF stack *click *click teabagg game so I pick someone stronger to farm some BP and get some rank back, but most of the time I play what I find fun.
---
Terrible comparison. Ruin along with every other hex perk is **supposed** to have the chance to be deactivated, that is the whole gimmick of those perks. High risk, high reward.
---
Yeah she be using the opposable thumbs to her advantage
---
Based on your negative comment karma, its clear that you’re either a troll, or are being legit and has genuine anger problems over someone voicing their opinion about a character in a video game. I might suggest going over to fortnite with that shitty attitude, or go back to pornhub, where you clearly spend most of your time. Thanks!
---
It's neither of those things. Firstly I've never played DBD anywhere but alone at home and I doubt you'll find many people out there who haven't, and second, have you BEEN around this community? There's a non-stop bitchfest about literally everything the other side does. If you've ever played a match in 13-1 you'll know firsthand just how ridiculously competitive everyone is. You'll only find casual players in lower ranks and that's only because the massive amounts of over-competitive jackasses haven't made them into the same thing.
---
A rework doesn't mean a Nerf or buff, it means a complete change to how it works
---
You can see 3 in the reveal
---
Imagine getting downvoted for saying this
---
Depends on what I'm going for; If I'm going for kills definitely nurse, but I find wraith to be the best for farming up BP (old legion was better but they gimped them pretty hard so they don't do as well anymore)
---
To be fair, F13 is extremely fun to watch. Something about it is so entertaining
---
Yeah there is such counter play to BT
---
RE2?
---
It's the exposed that ruins him. It's too fast. And the fact that reveal is broken most of the time so you get insta downed. 
---
I get they are balancing the exposed w/ reveal, but it's just stupid. If you want to keep it that way, which is fine, then a true balance would be to increase stun time from pallets and give the survivor a chance. 
---
While you have to be fucking dumb or blind to allow Myers to get to T3. He works for it and it only goes away with time. I think he needs a rework.
---
Everybody was kungfu fighting
---
Put in the category of “would kill the killers and lol” just like Ash. 
---
Also given their canon, they’d get sucked into the Entity’s realm, some bullshit late, the Entity is dead and they dress be off to Smoke on the Water.
---
Yeah but sometimes “ahead of time” literally means 30 minutes before it starts. 
---
There was apparently an update to the SteamDB a couple days ago so tomorrow is most likely, unless they ran into an issue.
---
What the duck did I just read?
---
No it's not, BT works im a way that the person who got it can body block as much as they want and they have no threat
---
baethiccc on PS4, I'm currnelty rank 12, but i dont play as much as id like with my work schedule. Preferably 18+, swf or kyf
---
WGLF was changed that only works with safe unhooks, try again. "Is a huge time save for teams", bitch, it's a perk, his job is to help survivors fucking Christ. Same for DS.
---
Already got most, with the new changes it'll be super easy to top them off
---
That’s some mighty tbaging for someone within nurse distance
---
Nice hax
---
Faster than a medium vault but not faster than a fast vault. Fire up + Bamboozle + Tier 3 Myers = 50% reduced vault time. Standard kills vault speed is 1.5 seconds
---
Just like M&amp;A should have been with Mikey
---
3
---
It's fun to use this perk against one gen that one survivor has been working on the entire game
---
WGLF is only a BP perk, has nothing that benefits anyone in the match, maybe the killer, because you have 1 less perk.
---
they should make a passive perk slot ... . No active ability's , no stuff like adrenalin etc .  But stuff like Kindred,Bond,Empathy or the new perk that shows ur own scratchmarks (maybe make it so in the passive slot the walking buff doesnt activate). But i hate perks that only work when u get hooked (not deliverance). Ideally u don't want to get hooked, so u don't take perks that give u X when ur Hooked (solo que aside) but take perks that increase ur chance to survive. I think it would be so much better , theres so many perks u can always only use in combination take X but u need Y aswell to make it good/decent. Obviously nothing OP or if for example u can take Self care in the passive slot its not 20% more healing its for example 10% for u and 10% on healing others. Imagine having a 5th perk thats only 50% of the normal perk e.g. Brutal strength  goes from 20% to 10% .  Obviously needs some balancing on some perk combinations or killer powers but all those perks that are decent could be passive and we had new "builds".
---
Pig, Ghost Face, Wraith, all their kits counter BT. TR reducing perks like M&amp;A, Insidious, the simple act of not tunneling and/or not staying near the hook. All easy ways to ensure BT literally just doesn’t work
---
Ich spreche die Sprache das ich möchte
---
Nope, devotion just tells us that we play the game to much.
---
You and that tree are married now.
---
Oh I think I got it mixed up with We’ll make it
---
Has the community decided if ghostface is scary or not yet?
---
&gt; It’s actually not that deep, personally I find it funny. 
---
This. It's a joke. If that's too toxic for people then they're doing survivor wrong. The proper response to getting pointed at after missing a skillcheck is to teabag the other survivor and point at them.
---
It helps boosters
---
PGTW is a perk that requires someone getting hooked and even then it has a time that once used can only be used once you hook someone again so it can be disabled and it's not even that strong as it only affects one generator
---
SF requires two destroyed pallets and being stunned, SF without enduring is shit. 
---
Enduring only works on pallets now so it's not even that strong anymore as they still have to break the pallet
---
STBFL is easily negated by having an obsession that body blocks.
---
Wraith is weak
---
Pig is weak
---
Ghost face is decent
---
Insidious is a weak perk as you get no pressure whole you stand there
---
Dark devotion requires an obsession so as long as the obsession isn't hit that perk is useles
---
Who said dead hard is useless?
---
Does deja vu really need a buff though? I thought it was designed to stop 3-gens from occurring which I assume it does well at. What would you change about it OP?
---
Anything would be better than pwyf. Id take predator over that garbage.
---
Iron Maiden is so fun on the Huntress. The animation break s sometimes so the doors on the lockers dong even close sometimes
---
Tnx
---
But NOED on Huntress sucks.
---
On most maps getting a hit in 45 seconds is tricky. Exposing up close is the only option and you have to do it *quick* before you're revealed.
---
Loop him like any other killer or just keep distance from him. Like I said; very bullyable killer at high ranks.
---
I almost never get a full stalk before being revealed. I recomend playing him so you can understand how temperamental and weak he is
---
Pig is shit
---
Wraith os shit
---
Insidious is a shit perk that weakens you more than helps
---
Not tunneling is basically saying let's go after the stronger survivor
---
its ghostface
---
*recocking his load
---
bill
---
WGLF is still a farm perk as long as the person you unhooked doesn't immediately go down, it doesn't help the survivor being unhooked at all. 
---
Again SWFS are majority stronger than killers so your a dumb ass who thinks that most people play solo queue when most people don't, every lobby has atleast a 2 man swf
---
They may increase it again (used to be 500k), but I doubt they'll remove it. The grind probably keeps more people playing than it deters, especially with them nerfing the bloodweb again to make acquiring perks  faster.
---
1. What does giving good props to other players do?
---
2. Who are the best survivors for starters?
---
I’m guessing the free tickets they mentioned that let you try a character for free before buying. 
---
I’ll let you all know on day 5 and 8 when I get them though.
---
How's Freddy going?
---
I was done with him after watching him complain about how there's nothing a killer can do about looping. How killer is boring because all you can do is face tank pallets until the exit gates open. It's pretty ridiculous and the way he's been acting over the years is incredible childish overall.
---
F13 is honestly pretty entertaining to watch. Criken in particular made a lovely series of videos on it, wherein he gets into character along with his friends.  
---
I definitely recommend [checking out his F13 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrJ8nFyja94WLBVGwsINVZDeEXz1x06ac).  
---
^^^**Chad** ^^^**Worthington** ^^^**Intensifies**
---
So, Myers will catch up to you eventually, assuming you're on a straight path, and keep medium vaulting.
---
First, devs released not long time ago a chart in which they showed that SWF games are fewer than solo players. Second, you are saying that a perk must be changed just because SWF exist. Case closed.
---
The biggest thing for me is the attitude of “if it makes money, I guess I’ll do it, but I want you all to know I’m miserable about it and will talk crap about the game the whole time”
---
If I give someone my time watching a video, it’s because I feel like they add value to my experience. I’m bummed because his earlier content was solid and helped me get my feet on the ground with this game.
---
Now it feels like listening to a grumpy uncle complain about the job he’s unwilling to quit.
---
More than likely, if not then next Tuesday would be my guess
---
yeee!
---
Imagine watching a dead game...like.
---
he only said at the end GG, besides, i lost the speed when i vaulted a window and i havent been able to get it since then
---
Slightly unrelated but all these new baby survivors are really rusting me, I cant get any good practice in as killer because all the survivors just run in a straight line not knowing what a pallet is even at higher ranks. I'm getting soft with these people, I know not to respect pallets but these survivors reward respecting pallets soooooo much because they instantly throw them down while camping them.
---
This is the content I came here for! Love it.
---
This is a blessed image
---
This is the only reason I cant complain about killer vs survivor hitboxes. Sometimes the game gives you a big one.
---
Cool. You still cheated.
---
My favorite is when I sacrificed all of them when they had 3 gens left and STILL got noed hate messages lol like... it didn’t effect the game AT ALL.
---
Resident Evil 2, an old zombie horror game. They "recently" released a remake it, and it's absolutely awesome.
---
Resulting to insults when your skill is questioned, yeah you’ve really got me convinced. I’m sure you’re the absolute best Trapper NA. All hail FortniteIsTerrible, king of the trapper mains. In all seriousness though, I already said survivor perks are powerful, but there’s a very large difference between powerful, and broken. If a perk has counter-play, it’s not broken, simple as that. Failure to adapt to powerful survivor perks is no one’s fault but your own, and sooner or later you’ll have to come to terms with that, or you’ll be stuck here, arguing with strangers on Reddit because “BoO hOo BT tOo StRoNg”, like the clown that you are
---
I'm simply using that as a line of support. I think it could go either way and it's interesting to talk about. Even if you could 12 seconds cleansing a totem, it's still 12 seconds more efficient than normal healing. It will definitely influence perk choice, so I'm excited to see it play out.
---
Aim at her hair.
---
great
---
The game inherits Jason’s soul..keeps coming back from the dead
---
Well any killer will EVENTUALLY catch up to you. If anything, killers catch up quicker when youre running in a straight line instead of around the walls of a jungle gym since the survivor collision box is smaller than the killer’s.
---
If someone played that audio cue, no matter the circumstances. I would loose my shit
---
I have to agree, ds got a good rework already and bl has a passive that makes it useful even when exhausted to make up for being the most situational exhaustion perk (after adrenaline). If they change either of them it will most likely go off balance and cause a backlash.
---
Like when a teammate is near a gen one of the 3 gens Is highlighted
---
Every time Evil Within III activates I look around as fast as I can because I'm ALWAYS adamant he's on me for whatever reason lol
---
omg the gen was the killer
---
I just got it! Fuk yea
---
From my experience nurse is either stupid easy or throw my controller into space hard. I guess it just depends on the skill of the killler
---
This meme was brought to you by the  Survivors Running Double-Stun Foundation
---
I'm watching it right now
---
Yup. And you’ll know which one it is within 5 seconds of being chased
---
Me: waiting for sale on Xbox so I can only pay double steam’s normal prices
---
High tears
---
He'd become the killer
---
That’s the worst rofl
---
Man it feels bad this game isn't available in my country (yet). I wish I would be able to play before December

I would say because this is a different type of scream, you aren't crying out in pain or shrieking in madness, you are screaming because your heart is pounding and you are so very close to escaping that you can taste it
---
F13, to be fair, is fun to watch because of the voice chat.
---
it changes at 8 PM EST on tuesday’s or 11 PM PST on tuesdays.
---
Am or pm?
---
When a perk is good on 1 killer, it's a problem. Meme build perk? Absolutely.
---
How did your friend wiggle off? The hook was right there it wasn't enough time to.
---
Hatch Grabbing is No Longer A Thing. This video is old as dirt. Everyone breathe easy haha.
---
Oh no did I hurt your feelings with my insult, I'm not gonna act nice to someone questioning my skill even though I have over 2300 hours on this game, i insisted because all your arguments are fucking brain dead and only make sense to people who don't understand how SWF and are stronger than any killer except nurse
---
Can we talk about Quentins Perks? Or ash perks? No? Okay then.
---
Exactly, this is just ment to be a small change, not a massive nerf
---
True. It would be more fun tho, if DbD had the same feature.
---
Most likely
---
So true rofl I went to have an epic tap heal moment because our random had been motionless in the grass. I was sorely mistaken.
---
Mobile also has stuff like a visual heartbeat, and free Iri addons and ebony mori the first killer game.
---
Similar shit happened to me when I was chasing a survivor as Freddy the other day. I swing through the pallet and try and hit the survivor, they drop the pallet, and I go flying several feet. The Claudette and I just looked at each other and then the pallet for a good few seconds.
---
No. You lose a token if you hit and if you miss.
---
Maybe it’s because the game is on game pass for the Xbox that makes que times low. Wish more people played this fantastic game
---
There are ways for you to play it right now.
---
From 9/5 to 9/9.
---
I didn't care for mike in season three. I felt his acting was a tad lack luster to say the least. Where as the rest did way better imo. I especially loved steve robin and dustin this season.
---
Yeah man, when it was released for PSplus I could find games in a second ahahahah on PC too waiting times are minimal, I'm considering buying it now that I have a gaming lap.
---
Anyway, good luck and escape the fog!
---
new year flashbang, winter flashbang and spooky flashb- light. event stuff
---
thank you so much, trying to get better everyday :D
---
Plague, Legion, Clown, Pig, Freddy?
---
Yep
---
What is the deal with mobile? I thought people were just playing a pirated version before. Is it actually out?
---
Maybe if they faced her more and actually learned how her kit worked, she won’t be as op as they think..
---
i think around 10$
---
I'm not a killer main, I would say I dabble in both equally...
---
I played a match as huntress (and I suck as huntress) and I will admit I unintentionally tunneled someone, because they stupidly ran infront of me after I was chasing the person who unhooked them... They just shouldn't have ran infront of me and I would have left them.
---
So I hooked this dude and he died but the other 3 escaped, 2 of them were actually good but the 3rd guy got saved at the last minute... All were injured when they escaped.
---
I then get hatemail from the guy that died saying "Haha you suck, lol you could only kill one person hahaha" to which I replied with "Yeah, but I did kill your salty ass :)". He then went on stating he played that match with his brother and went into his brothers room and took his controller just to "beat me". His brother was the guy who sucked... Because he was playing his brothers account at that time.
---
I honestly found it so funny, I just replied "lol you were dumb enough to get yourself killed and ALMOST killed again - your team are the reason you lived, not you". Then I blocked him. He was also using homophobic slurs - I was part of some PS4 LGBT communites and he learned that by checking my profile. I don't stand for personal attacks from internet crybabies, so I just block them.
---
I just thought it was ridiculous. Sure getting names thrown at me is annoying, but never have I heard of someone hijacking their teammates controller to "prove" that they can beat me. So stupid and pathetic.
---
&gt;don't tunnel
---
Clown, Legion, Hag, Doctor, Spirit.
---
Bought the licensed killers a while back.
---
Yes lads
---
&gt;here already doing a bloodweb rework
---
Might want to read this post again. It specifically mentions the grind "up to 40" the bloodweb changes do nothing prior to level 40.
---
Am
---
Would it have a cool down ? I could see it being used to decimate pallets without a cool down to stop the frequency  of this happening .
---
Or their just a crappy artist
---
Pshh you're flair is "Pig", I'm special
---
1. Nothing
---
When you pgtw a gen then they tap it but you hook someone right after and pgtw it again
---
🤷‍♂️
---
&gt; This data was also collected between April 1st and April 7th, after the pipping thresholds were originally changed but before they were later tweaked to be more forgiving for Survivors. Because of that, the statistics at this rank are from a small sample size consisting solely of the best players that could maintain rank 1 with the strict pipping conditions.
---
AKA if you're solo your teammates are a lot more dumb now. Spirit was also not released at that time, we have an entirely new S Tier character. Survival rates are not 80%.
---
Killers fault too for following her the whole time
---
yeah i’m just really fucking sleep deprived it changes at 5 pm PST not 11 haha my bad
---
The true big brain play is searching the chests for a key to re-open the hatch when they close it.
---
it is in beta for different places
---
I think they could have a happy hour on certain hours that happen at random
---
#DoYouEvenFormatBro
---
Intense negative life events can absolutely halt maturation in individuals. That’s 100% a thing

Link in comment but it's not up to date
---
1. Makes you feel good.
---
2. Meg and Claudette. Both come unlocked with the game. Meg for Sprint Burst (meh, but the only exhaustion you don't have to pay for), Adrenaline is pretty meta right now, and personally I enjoy some good Quick and Quiet plays every now and then. Claudette for Self Care (I actually dropped this from my kit), Empathy can be useful when starting out.
---
Here
---
$$$  there's your money
---
New killer: the dwight
---
Power: jumpscares you then immediately dc's you from the game.
---
I have 265 pine cones...
---
Okay Yoda
---
Bill is that you
---
Well the whole point of the game is to escape the killer. The whole point is it's a 4v1 and that's the only advantage you have, not so that you can 1v1 him all match through self care, decisive, pallet looping, insta heals and insta blinds.
---
You didn't even make the joke right.
---
Ok, that’s a different story, I’m not gonna go on your stream, but if you wanna claim the guy was a face camper, at least show longer clips of him doing it, it’s not impressive to call someone a face camper if they sit in your face for 5 seconds. So I’m just gonna believe you for now. But show longer clips plz
---
In my eyes I see it as the type of things friends do whenever one messes up. We tease the shit out of them. It's the rules. 
---
"Ahaaa he said something stupid everyone point and laugh" 
---
We never mean anything by it. It's free rein.
---
Yeah, considering in 98% of the games I play, the killer closes the hatch within 2 seconds of the last survivor dying.
---
Most killers pretty much guarantee my escape when they close it.
---
It's super hard to pull off opening the gate against some killers, though.   Trapper always makes it impossible, and with nurse/spirit/Billy it's a gamble. 
---
I've gotten to the point that with trappers, I just disarm their traps and hide to piss them off.
---
Thanks for the tip and since you seem to know a lot about the game I’ll ack you. For my final build should I use “Sprint Burst” or “Adrenaline”?
---
Okay ya baby
---
Again with the irony.
---
only problem is it makes every lobby an SWF and makes several perks obsolete
---
The grind isn’t that bad. Only thing you need id BBQ
---
It actually means ‘big mandibles’.
---
Did his comment say something else?
---
Currently we don't know, though they typically happen 1-2 weeks before the release of the chapter. Hopefully that means we'll get it within the next few weeks. I doubt they would overlap it with a Bloodhunt, so my guess would be after the Bloodhunt ends.
---
Double bloodpoints
---
Or they could just rework her extra blink and distance addons
---
So play Nurse
---
DarkTydePhil
---
I bet only half the community would have a mic so they wouldn’t be completely useless
---
Okay ya boob
---
Ah yes, enslaved bloodpoints
---
https://youtu.be/Z_y_Ipy4R0E
---
No, the weakest would be Leatherface, though he is still really weak.
---
I think you missed the point, we weren't talking about facecamping at all.
---
A reason to go to Hot Topic, weird
---
Kinda off topic, but I’m pretty sure I played with you an hour or two ago. It was in Haddonfield against the Pig, I was the Ash, and the Feng and I escaped through the hatch. 
---
If it is you, again, I’m sorry for not bodyblocking when you were being carried. I suddenly thought ‘wait, shit, I was meant to bodyblock that’ as soon as you were hooked.
---
Haha so I’m not alone then right? Right? 👀
---
Hes fueled by that sweet sweet finger juice.
---
Can't wait
---
David is also free (dead hard). Unless it's different on console?
---
Why the actual fuck am i being matched up with such shitty people who say shit like this whenever anybody speaks in the lobby?
---
Im guilty. I'm a new player and I'm scared. I just want to duck behind a rock quick and do the healing there. 
---
I'll work on my game sense tho and let people heal me sooner if it seems safe.
---
Awesome art! I love it.
---
Nurse *chokes" the engine.
---
😟
---
Agree on both points. It was all just to rant for fun. Nothing serious
---
Extremely sorry
---
Omg I remember you ahhahah and no worries it was a really fun game weird that I’d see you here xddd
---
Totally agree
---
Alright, no worries
---
The h is silent. Also invisible.
---
Oh Man?!?! I forgot about my boy DAVID!!! (o\_O)...
---
In that case, just get David. No Mither OP
---
Karma? Lazy? A combination?
---
It’s pretty fun ahaha decisive and unbreakable go so well together and when you wanna be extra toxic deliverance is helpful too
---
Yeah, I saw the blue suited Jane and I was like ‘huh, I saw someone like that today, didn’t I?’. Then I saw your username, and knew it rang a bell.
---
Get good with her, so you have a secret weapon.
---
If you get to red rank and want to climb without all the toxicity from survivors, you can bring Nurse and have a good chance to stomp them.
---
*the grind isnt that bad if you have double bloodpoints
---
Haha oh yeah. In case of slugging its super nice
---
End game, exits gates? *cAmPiNg* ? Generators far away? Indoor maps? 
---
But these don't help in chases you say?
---
Cause he has a charge attack which semi counters pallet looping.
---
bc i’m hungry and refuse to stop playing.
---
Nancy mains rise!
---
Lol MJ don’t care, just act like a kid and he will
---
Accept you!
---
Why do i feel like thats me up there
---
Oh god, those videos are so cringeworthy, and Noob3 is just gonna make it even worse.
---
Or you could used the bugged silent bell, which makes them instantly DC on hit.
---
Just Double bloodpoints on your Base BP gain. So max 32k more
---
Bloodpoints
---
Possibly
---
Facing four instances of that would have been fucking cancer.
---
They fixed them for hexes but that doesnt work either
---
well that sucks actually. 16s is way too much to make this perk useful in most situations.
---
Ya know what they say, he's practically *everywhere* nowadays.
---
No. Authentication is needed to Play this game. Also no ai here
---
what does 100% more bloodpoint in the altruism category mean? Is the safe unhook doubled from 500 to 1000, making for an overall 2000 point unhook, or is your altruism BP just doubled at the end of the match? I would personally prefer the former as it makes sense relative to the perk, you're aiding the unhookee by giving them an easier time to get to safety.
---
Can I get some help understanding what are good perks for Hag and WHY?
---
I got BBQChilli from the shrine and i feel like I have never used it. Noed was more useful. Im working towards monitor and abuse as I was told to go for it.
---
You can cut clips. Lol
---
*dies in P3 Quentin rights activist*
---
Adam Francis’ perk. Allows you to 100% of the time jump off a hook if you previously made a safe hook rescue.
---
You got them!
---
Maybe it was? Did this happen to you too with these cosmetics? This happened a few days ago.
---
Doesnt Sound top bad
---
I think how long it takes to cleanse yourself or whatever should also be increased for every time you do it. I think with it being 5 minutes is dumb as matches usually only last around 10
---
I think all the perks should be buffed as well.
---
Highly doubt it, they were edge walking in lampkin lane, trying to find my ruin. I legit told them after the game that the totems dont spawn at the edge of the map and they said I was just hacking and that I am toxic.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Nice. Now he only needs to stop screaming so his mic overshoots
---
Being petty afterwards doesn't really make you nice either
---
if a power needs add-ons to be good its shit.
---
Ues although briefly, lol
---
Because this is mobile. Mobile is grabbin like all your info. Youre basically paying with the rights to everything on your phone
---
It's interesting because at the same time, posts pointing that even Spirit suffers from map traversal times tends to be met with downvotes.
---
Like don't get me wrong, Spirit is *very very very good* in chases, her ability to mindgame not only unsafe pallets, but pallets that would ordinarily be safe, is excellent.
---
She still does suffer at larger building loops however, given that survivors know she cannot phase around the entire length of the building, and a 50/50 toss up for whether she catches you on the wrong side - while balanced - is frustrating to experience given that you're basically guessing/hoping.
---
She still doesn't move all that fast.
---
5 seconds of phasing.
---
15 seconds of cooldown.
---
Phases at 7.04 meters (for 35.2 meters in 5 seconds).
---
Total average over 20 seconds: 1.76 extra meters a second.
---
In turn Spirit moves at 4.4 m/s by default.
---
She is no Nurse with 13.33 m/s blink speed. She is no Hillbilly infinitely running at 9.2 m/s with his chainsaw.
---
If she wants to keep her power to use in a chase, she has to patrol as slow as Huntress, and is impacted by Spine Chill like all other killers who need to *start* chases before getting to really use their power, or any survivor with ears (unless she's running prayer beads).
---
And since generators do go so fast, we live in a meta balancing immersion with gen rushing, it's really hard to play around that.
---
Can you give an example of the buffs?
---
Because for example, Unholy Machinery was going to reverse a good skill check for 15/20/25 % of its original progress
---
Eh, I'd rather take out the best players first
---
Hello cunts!!!
---
What were the perks?
---
Playtime?
---
Honestly they should nerf gen times already because it seems ruin is more of a necessity which sucks because it takes away from experimenting with different builds in the game
---
Yeah I get that a lot and that’s why the gens are done on time.
---
Just the first three! And maybe, but I think STBFL fits pretty well (and required less drawing)
---
Ad hominem involves attacking someone on a personal level in a way unrelated to the discussion. It isn't ad hominem to say that you haven't acquired the skill level to counterplay. That's just facts.
---
The grass does move when she phases. So does corn and other flora, and even fauna (crows) fly away as she passes while phasing. Guess you still have more to learn. Derp.
---
Generators Fight Back - 2020 in your closest cinema.

I'm yet to encounter someone I think is cheating, and I'm a rank 1 killer.
---
Stuff about some fucking mobile bullshit
---
Well
---
That happened
---
sometimes bro you just gotta let the sterotype be true when the matches go bad
---
Well it does work sometimes. Its not a bad perk to run with that build. If I were to swap it put for anything else I would have bbq and chili. Cause even then the point of having the “Ghost” sigil is to be stealthy and catch players off guard on gens. So having unnerving presence would just beat the whole point of running that add on.
---
Unless I swap it out for the “Beast” sigil which doesnt hide my terror radius when cloaked.

---
Purple* I call them codeine farts.
---
Wait no I disagree. It is a 1v1 that relies on pallet loops health etc. It's just whether you can outlast a certain amount of time. Sure other surv can drop pallet on killer when they pick you up etc. But it is a 1v1.
---
Me who is on my first game as survivor
---
I too was a legion main, then I played other killers!

I think he said you did a great job that game and to keep it up! /s
---
I would say 5pm to 8pm your time but people would just change their timezone to get infinite BP boosts(if possible, i never bothered with it and just stuck to my time zone).
---
I’ve seen a video about this just now. It’s sad to see that indeed there is a *huge* difference between the mobility and precision on console and pc.
---
I made up my mind and won’t try her. I’ll stick to the huntress. But all of this does make me wonder, should I switch to pc for this game? 
---
I don’t know man, always been a console player!
---
It's not really good. But it's fun if you're taking a shit.
---
Ok.  You answered your own question, if they are as good as you describe then there is no counter to her.  Survivors have 2 tools in a chase (vaults and pallets), the nurse hard counters both of these.  There are no other means to escape a chase.
---
break line of sight then change directions
---
Is rank 1 difficult to get or can literally anyone get there if they try, I ask because I bought this game in 2016, stopped playing around nurse or hag I think, came back about 2 month ago and played a couple weeks of survivor, tried a nurse game and got called trash/flamed because I only killed 1 person.
---
So I jumped into nurse/Billy/Wraith head first, and made it to rank 1 4 days ago. I was just wondering if this is a big achievement, or just a "that's neat" kind of thing?

thx man, the post is now edited
---
I had a Pig player today defend "camping" because "Pig is an ambush Killer".
---
I was like "really you think that's what ambush killer means?"
---
To sit 20 meters away crouching until you see someone go down the basement stairs (20 meters is still camping at Killer move speeds, they can reach the stairs going down before you unhook the person and make it all the way back up).
---
They even camped me when the other two were slugged, I had Spine Chill and was in struggle and could *see* the Killer running around the nearest puzzle box a short-ish distance behind me just 3\~ seconds before I died, they were making sure no one had Unbreakable and saved me.
---
We were a bit too altruistic, but I waited like 40 seconds once for Spine Chill to stop flickering and unhooked someone once and she came right back, I was boggled, it wasn't like we were rushing the hook. Waited for her to seemingly leave each and every single time.
---
Those arent chases, those are the beginnings of chases
---
I don't like where this is going
---
Yes I've had the same problem on the ps4.
---
Ok...not trying to be rude, and i will say i do agree with you, but sometimes people dont always browse reddit often, on mobile its kinda a pain to search, and there might be new infomation not in an older post
---
Ooooooh I see what you mean. That’d be a very interesting buff. I’d run that on all the insta down builds and have a field day with an almost permanent 5-10% movement speed buff.
---
Die
---
Read the bottom.
---
There are times when someone will miss a skillcheck but then I see michael  or ghostface standing behind them so ill point in their direction before running off. Makes me seem like I was just mad at them but I was trying to warn them, they usually end up getting yoinked off the gen or insta downed.
---
Weak players are more likely to waste pallets, less likely to power through for an Adrenaline proc. If you know the guy on the hook was a weaker player, you can go for the rescuer.
---
Usually I fake out going for the guy on the hook *so that any good rescuers will attempt a body block*.
---
Pretending to tunnel is a mindgame in and of itself, they try to get your attention instead of running away.
---
he is free, but you have to get the dlc from the store
---
You have to break line of sight as quickly and as stealthy as possible. It’s a guessing game for the nurse. She has to predict where you’re going to be in order to hit you after a blink. Make your self less predictable. Buildings, jungle gyms, corn fields etc... are all your best friends.
---
What's your perk on the right?
---
me: I have a trap down on this loop
---
survivors: trigger it and get hit
---
me: wanna see me put another one down?
---
I've literally only encountered a chest once
---
I'm hoping the battlepass thing will be fairly inexpensive and it won't be too difficult to progress.
---
it's spirit fury
---
Someone using Deliverance *right in front of my face* is one of the few things I will tunnel for. They're broken and unable to heal and they literally just did it? They're mine.
---
I understand the sentiment, but there's no such thing as "slightly OP." Doesn't really make sense.
---
^(Also I didn't expect a Warframe meme here.)
---
Exactly why I quit running kindred playing random solo, waste of a perk slot when it should be built in if playing solo. Then you get post or comments of people saying to run kindred but then this happens and your wasting a perk slot. Plus I don’t know why people have just been leaving people to die on the hook and the killer isn’t camping!
---
If stealth builds and line of sight jukes don’t work, there is literally no other counter-play, at that point it becomes a game of trying you best to get enough emblem points to safety-pip before your inevitable demise
---
2 chests spawn automatically did you check the basement?
---
Since I put my skill check on a mouse button these issues don't bother me, seriously put it on a mouse button, it's amazing.
---
That's you. I'm a survivor main and I've played against hundreds (if not more) killers then just against you. You do understand that right? My experience against killers is going to be vastly different then how you play against survivors.
---
It's not a different account - the PTB is a different environment, but they do take a snapshot of your character(s) &amp; BP progression at a specific point in time. I'm not sure of when they actually take the snapshot unfortunately.
---
Think of it like a different timeline that splintered off of the main timeline ;)
---
AH SHIT A SPIDAH
---
This fuckers just trying to promote his shitty indie film.
---
If you can, it's quite fun. If you are able to and haven't spent a bunch of points yet, do it. Nurse mobility and huntress Hatchets improve GREATLY with that pixel perfect precision. 
---
If you're hundreds of hours in you have to decide if it's worth trading it all in for getting access to all different playstyles.
---
Conveniently, dbd and it's dlc is having a big sale on humble bundle right now.
---
One of my friends says I'm too nice when I absolutely destroy the survivor team and let one or two live.
---
The thing is that I'm not exactly like. Nice all the time. I do play the Killer to mercilessly strip away victory when possible (SWFs obviously deny this a lot) and get all four kills.
---
But sometimes the survivors are just so *bad* that it feels like I'm a wolf among sheep even though I myself am not really that good (another reason I hate playing against SWFs, I usually try to play to have fun, not sweat, if someone gets away then someone gets away, I didn't do hatch standoffs back when either) I'm just like.
---
How can I kill this poor survivor that got hooked farmed by a potato and doesn't even know how to use the most basic of pallets?
---
&gt;Ok...not trying to be rude, and i will say i do agree with you, but sometimes people dont always browse reddit often, on mobile its kinda a pain to search, and there might be new infomation not in an older post
---
You weren't rude in the slightest, thanks for you response. I was genuinely curious and your answer makes a bit of sense.
---
Hope is just fine for what it does. It’s a very situational perk but it’s also very powerful in that role, nice counter to NOED.
---
That is amazingly pretty.
---
It's stuff like this that make me question my waifu over Feng/Meg.
---
To an extent that's true, but I've vaulted shack window, been in the middle of shack, and still took the hit on 25 ping. It's mostly in part to bad hit boxes. Especially for window vaults and pallet drops. The lingering hit boxes is what needs to be fixed.
---
I would love to see this as a game mode with either different perks specifically for this or the same perks but altered for this game mode
---
no. To pick this perk instead or over other meta perks, given that you already need to spend time to charge stacks, it would require almost instant effect

Looks like She expected the dead hard. She probably lunged late, You can see her swing and hit you right before you dropped the pallet.
---
Ok so now this is epic!

I thought I was the only one ; - ;

"But the hag gets to eat people!"
---
Normally I hate when people post those sub tags, but man this was perfect.
---
You can this more often with Urban Evasion, which is why I run it sometimes.
---
Still, amazing job. \^\^
---
Doesn't EA have a reddit account that's like in the massive negative karma because anything EA says on reddit is literally downvoted by the thousands?
---
I normally like going for the unhooker just for the spirit of things, but taking out weaker players is still a good idea.
---
From the killer perspective you aren't securing the one kill you'll get. You are both keeping that player directly from doing gens and potentially interferring with the team's ability to still do gens (if they play altruistically at all).
---
They should be tempted to divert at least one guy to go save that one. You can then patrol and try to find the other's nearby or hover if they throw themselves too much on the hook.
---
Even if they leave that person to die (because you're camping or otherwise) thats one person not on gens.
---
It's also important to realize that a weaker player normally just means bad at outsmarting or running the killer. They all will generally have the same skill at doing a generator. Getting a weaker one can actually be better than focusing on a survivor that is just trying to bait you into a chase the whole game since they aren't even working on gens

---
I'm a console peasant
---
No idea got the source?
---
Why do people have borrowed time as a top tier perk? You have so little time to heal after taking a hit that it seems like in most situations you'll just tank the hit and then still end up getting downed anyway.
---
If the nurse is stupid maybe, but seriously line of sight and corner turning is only a bandaid solution.
---
No you're breathtaking!
---
EDIT: Gold??? Say sike right now!
---
My thoughts exactly. Maybe he figured out how to survive in the woods?
---
The killer can also eat while he plays if his ok with getting completely wrecked.
---
I heard the game is brighter on Low quality so maybe he uses that.
---
If you only find one person, you should still go for them. But if they lead you to someone else, preferably someone doing a gen, you should go for them instead to keep everyone busy. 
---
Also, people will call everything tunneling and camping, trust me. Im a pretty fair killer, and my steam profile is filled with hate comments about how mean I am 😛
---
**“**Hello fellow Dead by Daylight, this you should camp me. I leave camp ... Good. Thank you, Thank you... If you camp me I'm hot.. What? Hexes, they'll be ruin... Son! The worst rank for me is the right thing to do Daylight, so doo!...**”**
---
Found it, you can read why here and the account is u/EACommunityTeam
---
There is an addon which makes the bell silent.  It isn't actually bugged, but survivors often DC when they get hit by a surprise wraith.  You can combo it with the addon that makes your terror radius silent for a few seconds after decloaking and get easy hits/grabs.
---
if you have a great snack its worth the L
---
It used to be much much easier to get as killer and survivor. It does take more “playing” to get consistent pips or the elusive double pip but it’s not extremely hard, but you can’t pip by one hooking everyone and ending the game in 4 minutes.
---
Who wouldn’t want more blood points ? There is 16 survivors and 16 killers imagine how long it would take to p3 every single one on both sides if there was never any blood hunts at all. Not to mention how long it already takes now. Of course people are gonna be eager for this sometimes it gets tiring earning bloodpoints
---
Wouldn’t that be better in terms of balancing ? They can just balance with voice chat in mind instead of SWF being considered overpowered.
---
Great idea and what seams like strong perks ,but how do you mark survivors? is it similar to a RBT or something like a plague?
---
I'm not saying that. I'm just saying we'll see how bad they are when the servers are live.
---
I run around alot, like a maniac but like a maniac with a plan.
---
Run around like a crazy person, and look for tires, point of views that can fuck her up, oh and if your in the basement when she tries to blink just run at her and she will blink down to it.
---
kinda like old freddy, but instead of taking a few seconds, its almost instant
---
Interesting. i think that killer could be high tier
---
XD this happened to me once I was trying to eat my ramen and missed like 2 skill checks
---
Damn. J. Geil is toxic.
---
He’s speaking the language of the gods
---
I won't be able to do gens in the first place if i starve to death.
---
thanks man
---
I haven't watched either of them, but I don't like Tru3Ta1ent and I really like HybridPanda. Ohmwrecker also plays but I don't like how he plays killer and it looks like he has no clue what he's doing as survivor.
---
Oh god shigechi don't touch the tarnished coin oh god oh fuck.
---
Yeah but that is not on low, that looks way worse than low settings.
---
Getting pretty crowded in that locker aye?
---
Np and great job
---
I will never remove spine chill or balanced landing unless I do a perk build/ meme build. Why do some people think that spine chill is bad?
---
Or any one of the Ghostbusters from the reboot since they almost killed the franchise.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
I liken add-ons to be more those compounds in chemistry that changed the color of fire. 
---
Add-ons are like that.  They change the properties, but not the intrinsic nature of the power (or item in survivors' case) itself.
---
Yo, Daddy Myers got his foot stuck in the genny and he can't get it out, this is so sad.
---
WGLF is gonna be my new favourite perk.
---
Similar thing just happened to me. I was doctor, and a bloody Claudette was trying to be an ochido wannabe. She teabagged after dropping a pallet, then accidentally led me to someone else. I downed other person, and hooked them. I figured the wannabe was somewhere nearby. Sure enough, I found her near the hook. She teabagged again, then tried to go for the save. I shocked her, which canceled the animation, then downed her. She immediately dc’d. Sooooo satisfying.
---
That would appear to be bamboozle
---
: D
---
What if you were from Alabama
---
You're more than welcome to watch it when it's released :)
---
Thanks! I’ll try premonition out once I unlock a better version of it :)
---
I will never look at the trapper the same again. Lol
---
With randoms it's completely useless. SWF it is only really useful if you aren't using voice chat... so yeah it's useless.
---
I've got some wood for Michael.
---
Theres less real pallet if people drop them all to remove the fakes
---
Yo is this demi plays?
---
i see your point and agree to a certain degree, but honestly that is not what is considered 'META' it is not efficent to dedicate 25% of your strenght addition to a case that, in your words, only occures once every one million times. i would consider that planing for failure, which again, is not something that should be looked down on, but its certainly not optimized efficiency
---
Technically the Demogorgon isn't tunnelling it's traveling through the Upside Down.
---
Origin of teabag.... See "ass hat" and or "ass habadashery". Cross refrence 56K dial up modem and mech warrior 2.
---
I scratched my nose and missed one last night and then the bill left me on the hook
---
I would love this. Although I already have some noobie friends, we can all get together and get some in-game experience.
---
...then people will take your point seriously
---
Too many to list. Unreal Tournament, Monster Hunter, League of Legends, Guild Wars 2, Final Fantasy 14, Evolve, Rocket League, World of Warcraft, Blade &amp; Soul, DOOM, the list goes on and on.  
---
Currently it's Guild Wars 2 and Final Fantasy 14.
---
I'm guessing you're gonna lead towards where I heard Meta used as a acronym before, so I'll just mention it: it was in League.
---
There are some other perks that I would like to buff but I was stuck with. One of these was Up the Ante. Luck is a very unloved mechanic in this game so I was stuck. I don't want to get rid of the luck in the perk as maybe one day luck will be buffed. I just want to add something alongside it but I don't know what.
---
You should get a speed boost of 150% for 5 seconds with poised and has a cool down of 60 seconds or maybe exhaustion after completing a generator.
---
Hot take, if tunneling or camping get you a good score, the survivors played poorly. They're strats, they're just bad ones, bad ones that also ruin specific people's experiences for no good reason
---
Lol please don't farm  people I beg you.
---
The best players are good enough to draw a chase out. You're better off committing to that chase when the weakling is dead and can't contribute even 1% to a gen while you're busy.
---
I’m still a low ranked survivor, and I seem to get unhooked right in front of the killer more times than I get unhooked outside of the killer’s terror radius :(
---
My Go To Build is Save The Best For Last, Monitor and Abuse, Make Your Choice and Huntress’ Lullaby. 
---
STBFL is because Hag can enter and finish chases very quickly so you get stacks going very quickly. The other reason is that people disrespectfully go for saves in the Hag’s face and with 4+ tokens you recover so quickly you can hit someone, recover and pull them off the savior before they can actually save. Maximum profit. 
---
M&amp;A is a luxury pick for me. Your TR is already tiny so taking it down means people don’t know where you’re setting up traps or where you even are sometimes. 
---
MYC is a bit obvious: You hook someone, set a trap, walk away, let the survivors set the trap off because they don’t respect your traps and you get free downs. 
---
Lullaby: This is personal. I love this perk because I also hate Ruin. Survivors love cleansing Ruin but won’t bother to give Lullaby a search until you get tokens going so by the time you snowball up, you’ve got the area mostly trapped up and that tension of doing a gen when the timer gets shorter and shorter survivors hurt on gens. It’s kinda mean but I don’t play Hag to be nice. 
---
BBQ is nice but Hag is kinda strange cause even if you see a survivor aura half way across the map, you still gotta gangster lean all the way over there to even find them, implying they stay in the area, plus if someone triggers a trap on your way or beforehand, getting the aura is useless. Now double BP; that’s good. That’s always good. But when you only have 4 slots, you kinda need some other game slowdown and bbq doesn’t slow the game down unless you have hard mobility and Hag’s mobility is survivor dependent.
---
I sometimes play a minn game while playing DBD doing gens. Like "oh man I gotta scratch my nose but will the skillcheck pop up?" It's always a gamble. But most of the time I win.
---
There is a special orange unlockable version of the teachable perks that will show up in the bloodweb of the relevant killer at 30, 35 and 40. Once you unlock them in the bloodweb, they will start showing up in the other characters'. It has nothing to do with the rank of the perk.
---
So in your example, having rank 1 or 2 or 3 of Ruin on the Hag won't make it show up in bloodwebs. You need to get the orange teachable one at level 35 on Hag, it will start showing up in all other killers bloodwebs randomly. You don't need to do anything to unlock ranks or anything.
---
Oh like people thinking they are fake and not being fake. I can see it. But it happens already regardless. Not to mention you have to be asleep to do it.
---
I try not to but sometimes to killer is back faster then anticipated so the 5sec immunity will be helpful for the rescued person.
---
This is a normal occurrence

How does Friday the 13th compare to DBD?

Pwyf should be a passive 5% speed boost.

Once upon a toxic crapper
---
i do 100% agree on that. for certain killers (for example trapper) i do think its kind of necessary to run NOED since their early game is rather weak. but than again, we were talking about META play, and there is a reason those killers are considered low-tier\^\^
---
Ah yes. Survivor mains 101
---
Depends really.

Is it a tournament? Then it's cheating.

Is it anything else? Naw.

Rule of Killers #360420: The killer must never return to the same area of the map that’s he’s already been on.

Most realistic situation I've seen, Meg just walks up to the gen and stares at it like "What am I supposed to do with this"
---
I started watching because dbd. Does that count?
---
He used to be a decent creqtor that helped me leqrn the game. Fair enough that he got bored of the game, and I stuck around for deathgarden info, but I recently unsubbed because I oriyinally follkwed him for his dbd content and his attitude about it was getting grating. Acting like he was doing everyone a big favour by playing one match in his video about stranger things.
---
oof, imagine being such a lifeless prick you die into other people’s comment history when all they did was call you cringe
---
Ghostface was camping on the right hand side of the screen, you'll see him leave after a few seconds.
---
one match the servers or something got weird and made the survivors stand still no matter what they did while I was able to smack em and down em, does this usually happen?
---
I don't how many games you've played, but as soon as the killer finds the hatch ... it's closed. Unless you find it first or they see you in the process.
---
Technically he is an antagonist, as he is a villan. It does look really good though.
---
cause they just don’t know how to utilize it. a lot of people thing premonition is better because they know what direction the killer is coming from, but if you know your map layout you really get much more use out of spine chill. it just has a tough learning curve i guess :/
---
And after all his talk of it, he cancelled his 'dark times' videos.
---
Well played.
---
Even tho the game says otherwise I think doctor is great for beginners if you're not good at finding people. Especially with the right add ons you'll find people a lot easier. But trapper is also a good choice!
---
There is no Killers Rulebook for survivors.
---
I'd agree but just nerf ruin at the same time. Current ruin mixed with longer gen times would be god awful.
---
It really just depends on what you want to play as. Most killers are really fun to play as. Watch some videos of each killer and try to find one that you'd think would be fun to play as. I'd personally recommend the shape or the hag
---
thank you so much!! that’s super helpful to know! i appreciate you!
---
Honestly I think Hillbilly might be in there, Huntress wasn't abused, but still turned to violence after traumatic events involving her parent that essentially left her illiterate and alone, turning to rage.
---
Isn't that basically Hillbilly but with parental abuse? He was locked up or whatever for his entire childhood, escaped, and went mad with a chainsaw.
---
I'm sure the Legion except for Frank.
---
Nurse came to believe in forced euthanasia over time, she did not simply snap from abuse or some kind of trauma, she just decided lives meant nothing - I think she's not redeemable, she turned into a monster over years, she was not fractured in a moment like Spirit.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cvuwk0/a_squirrel_in_the_dying_state/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
If you hit them, they can jump in at any time because you broke collision, Not to mention you can't close hatch until the bladewipe animation is done. Also they stay with collision disabled until they leave your hitbox, so neither of you would bodyblock eachother and it would just be down to who hits space faster again. 
---
Also jesus dude this shit is 2 weeks old, You're talking very specific niche situations about whether or not you can time it. 
---
This is about the games code, how severs work, and engine trigger priority. This isn't about "maaaybe you can side step 2 times and hit them 2 seconds before it opens" but just how networking works and server information is processed.
---
blessed baby dweet
---
If the game doesnt allow a mouse and keyboard naturally and I have to use an adaptor or xim to trick the game into thinking I'm using a controller then I do believe its cheating and definitely not intended
---
Jump scare gen grab Wraith is legit. I have mained Wraith since release and he hasn’t been in a good spot for a while, but when I run this add on combo it is actually very, very good. I almost always get 1-2 gen grabs per game with it which really helps my momentum.
---
This is the most accurate meme on here I've seen
---
Don’t worry at December there’s gonna be a double Bp for a week. Plus no school for a week because it’s Christmas
---
Yeah. The best work around i can think of is, when you log in that day, the bp bonus is active for X hours(X being the value they want, such as 2 hours being x = 2). This way, even if you change your timezone, it would still count down the same .
---
U toxic duck need more upvotes.
---
I'm just saying man, they won't help hit boxes as much as you're thinking it will. Coming from someone who actually played that ptb.

How do people instaheal and normal heal themselves with the same medkit?

The story actually surrounds him becoming a serial killer, from good to bad. It’s a rather interesting progression, I think you’ll like it!
---
Removing any player is better than removing no player.
---
Sure, if you have the opportunity, take down the big, strong leader. But killing the weakest is still a kill and still puts the game to a 3v1.
---
That's true. I also had some salty survivors cussing me out because I ran NOED as huntress, but that is because my level is so low I literally don't have any other perk, except munstruos shrine which is kinda disappointing.
---
I've been that huntress
---
My mom was the worst too, (violent, mentally ill) so I latch onto any semblance of calming motherly things absorbed from pop culture as well. It’s nice, I like her lullaby. I get it lol :) &lt;3
---
Maybe. But 71% of 1,200 votes is 876. The game doesn't get that many viewers daily. People see the name Friday the 13th and click it. Which is why the poll is bullshit. No one is actually watching it.
---
CHECK YOUR FIRE FRANCIS!

To pick any new perk over the current meta would have to be insanely strong. I'm looking to create B/C tier perks. Vigil is currently low D tier.
---
I love how you used the perks for this!
---
But 8 meters is very small. 8 meters consistently for 16 seconds is very hard to achieve in a chase.
---
For Huntress, it was survival that eventually turned into sport with a soft spot for little girls so there's still something there. Hillbilly was locked away and abused so he attacks anyone/thing on sight, and the only way to try and talk to him would be to restrain him which keeps the cycle going even if he's being treated nice. I figured Julie was too interconnected with Frank to separate but the case can be made. Nurse in current medical settings with oversight could reverse some thinking especially given 40 years. Spirit would be real easy if she could be brought back while still alive and healed, her ghost form holds no chance.
---
I understand why people downvote, but obviously this is a joke, it's a "meme/shitpost", you wanna discuss your counterpoints? Take it elsewhere. Perhaps when I make a meme and it's a "discussion" I'll be happy to define how your "strategy" isn't good. But as I said, I don't care. I face camp when I'm 4 survivors at the gate and I got noed.  A normal person would for the BP.
---
You bring a Kit with extra charges and only use the insta when you’re almost out/Pink Insta when someone gets downed on death hook.

It's still a test server and not the final product. Latency absolutely has something to do with it. Or having you never played PuBG?

I really need to look into discord, I feel like I barely have time to reddit but a co-worker was recently showing me the discord app and it reminded me of the old school chat rooms of the early 90s.  
---
Does anyone play between 11pm and midnight, mountain time?  It takes so long to match me during that hour, when I'm the survivor.
---
You just gotta pray that the survivors are really slow on gens, and also pray that if you try hooking them to slow the game down and give yourself enough time to get EW3 that they don't kill themselves or DC, or jump in a locker.
---
I also think it is doable with Tombstone Piece, but you just got to be veeeeerrrry careful on who you're killing and in what order, if you tombstone a survivor you didn't fully stalk yet, you won't have enough to Mori all 4.
---
Says the Claudette main.
---
&gt;but an actual competitive game is one that is balanced so both sides play on an even playing field
---
What your thinking of is professional, not competitive. So if I said I played Competitive Dead By Daylight, that wouldn't technically be right, but you can say that DbD is a competitive game. Another example is Team Fortress 2, back in the day your only option was to play casual because there was no ranked mode, but it was still a competitive Team vs Team game, as opposed to Portal 2 which was a 100% cooperative game.
---
&gt;which is just not possible with asymmetric games
---
Evolve was very balanced and it was asymmetrical. There was no hunter or monster that was clearly OP, there was no guaranteed strat, which is more than what could be said about mainstream competitive games ie Overwatch and Siege
---
Also, just to point it out, games that do have a pro scene are still very rarely balanced, you can take a look at Overwatch and Siege as stated before, but you can also look at CSGO with T/CT sided maps. Only MOBAs are truly balanced because of the mirror maps and how everybody gets access to all characters.
---
He is probably one of the kids who gets mad for you finishing a 75percent gen right next to him before saving and calls you selfish and trash
---
Poor Huntress getting bullied.
---
Oh my god that is totally fucked up.
---
&gt;!Why would anyone choose huntress or legion over hag?!&lt;
---
Yeah. Like I mentioned in other comments in this tree, that's the meta-game for that particular topic. People shorten it to meta just to save keystrokes. What seems to be catching you is that the meta game isn't just the tools and abilities actively at your disposal. It's knowledge of the players, expectations on how they'll play (sometimes called Meta-meta game), knowledge of characters and how abilities work... Basically anything that isn't learned on the spot during the match, like where the tank is and what that means for you and the team.
---
You seem to be misunderstanding the real basis of what I'm saying. I'm saying that meta isn't an acronym. It was never used for that. Meta is just shorthand for metagame, and it encompasses a LOT more than just tools and abilities. I'm not saying you're wrong in what you're saying, because that *is* a part of the meta. What I *am* saying is that its a small portion of it.
---
Remember, despite what this sub may make it seem like, there isn't a "right" and "wrong" in every conversation. I'm expanding people's knowledge on the topic. That's all.

I loved mech warrior 2! 56k, I can do without. I never made that connection though, teabagging is actually give the downed person your ass as a hat. Thanks for blowing my mind
---
*Laughs in Rank 1 Nurse*
---
Yeah, honestly me too. I wish there were some other good killer perks.

Would appreciate it if you pm me details if/when you release something. c:
---
And make sure to use brown medkit as to not waste better ones. Right?
---
Just tested it, it works with mfi controllers
---
Thank you!  To be honest I'm surprised something like this wasn't thought up already.
---
Sounds like youre on the right track my man. Keep the course, youre doing wonders for the community! 👍🏻
---
You're picking and pulling things I'm saying out of context. I've already told you that yes latency plays a part in bad hits, but you're not listening to me when I tell you that the lingering hit box during medium vaults is there BY DESIGN, not by bad ping. They literally designed it like that, just like when you heal behind an gen, your hit box extends above the gen, even when your actual model is concealed behind it. That is by poorly designed hit boxes, not latency. Servers won't fix something that is there because of poorly designed hit boxes. That is what you can't seem to grasp.
---
Just because someone gets downed within a minute of getting hoomed doesnt mean they were tunneled
---
Fine you win. Now will you STFU about please. Jesus Fucking Christ.
---
I like these new memes with people using perk icons - good shit right here
---
I like Lightweight and WGLF
---
Lightweight allowing you to not make a noise would make sense - but I think they might save an affect like that for future perk... Which is sad, cause I would use Lightweight a LOT if I made no sound.
---
WGLF seems a little op, especially if you pair it with borrowed time. Then again, it's a pure farming perk, which is annoying because BBQ is actually useful. They need to make WGLF a useful perk but I think making you essentially immune when unhooking someone would be a bit crazy. 
---
I think if WGLF gave the person unhooking a borrowed time effect it would be more interesting. I think an affect like this would pair VERY well with the new Babysitter perk.
---
The entity is a almost all powerful being, and its likely that it can mess with the demogorgon nature so it won't flee from the realm
---
I started going YOLO and trying to save last minute the moment i realized that even if i die I could make someone's day better. From that day, borrowed time is a staple in all of my builds.
---
Are you playing on Beta settings?
---
Nice try. We all know it's blursed.
---
That sounds really cool! Can I still get my hands on it?
---
Thanks
---
I got tired of the game as well. I think it’s because it’s been severely lacking in terms of changes/updates these past months, IMO, which made the game very stale. I took a month break, now I find the game fun again, and ready for the next DLC.

Not all Pigs are dicks... But most of them are

From what I’ve seen of it so far, it looks similar to the Hag. Of course, you can’t say which is better yet; Trapper and Hag are similar but have their own strengths and weaknesses. Let’s wait until the DLC actually rolls around :))
---
also to run MYC to fuck with anyone using babysitter
---
Remove the you out
---

---
I’ve never bothered with prestige myself. Don’t want to lose everything I have.
---
Not cheating in DbD, but I feel ya when I play R6 on PS4 and the opposing team is using KnM.. I’m a pc guy now so I don’t run into that anymore of course, but it was awful
---
Which is why Jeff mains are rejoicing. Yay Distortion!
---
It depends. If you use a yellow medkit, it has more base charges so you won't have to use a high rarity add on for more charges. Example: you can use yellow medkit + styptic + gauze roll instead of brown medit + styptic + gel dressings.
---
Maybe it's not as bad on dbd, but if playing as killer (ik this thread wasn't about this) and playing as nurse you would have a much larger advantage to using a mouse and keyboard
---
Didnt people hate him for a bit? I just recently got into DBD and his channel.
---
/r/ZettaiRyouiki/
---
You mean the terms the community uses?
---
Moderator seemed interested so if the idea gains traction there could be a megathread. Support the idea and the mods could create a system. Can’t imagine it’d be too difficult.
---
That’s true, I guess I was thinking survivor mainly. Nurses on PC are WAY more of a threat than on console.. coming from console that’s the biggest difference I think, how bad they are with a controller lol I did however run into a guy who was the best nurse I’ve ever seen and he was on PS4, crazy kid
---
Altough they probably cant put "Hello Kitty", they could just change its name
---
I want it.
---
I mean the only people who doesn't like strong woman are the ones with huge masculinity issues. There they got to have a small girl to always seem strong and mature to themselves.
---
Also she is russian. That is hot in itself.
---
A lot of people value other perks over spine chill. For example, a person with an aggressive play style might prefer to run adrenaline, dead hard, or borrowed time over spine chill since they prefer running the killer over avoiding the killer.
---
I'd buy the fuck out of that. That's one of those skins I'd get dumb with and pay like $20 for XD
---
What purpose would that serve?
---
I fully agree. What a fuckwit.
---
No one can really say that a word can't evolve or change, but that wasn't *really* my crux of my conversation to start with. But, I'm glad you're coming out of this content, at least. Good luck in the fog, or whatever it is we say here. I'm not sure.  
---
(Also yeah I think we were about four layers deep on the meta. ~~Metaception.~~)
---
from where? it’s not in appstore 😡
---
Sure, killers that don't like flashlight, gen rushing, adrenaline, dead hard and way more.

Borrowed time is very valuable for getting late-game saves. So, it can literally be the difference between survival and death for your teammates.

“Killers have to follow all our rules we made up, and have to play exactly how we want them to play, and never use any perks because that’s cheating, and if they even so much as hit one of us we will scream and cry and threaten to report them in end game chat!” - Survivors.

A kyf, if you don't have any one to play with irl then the dbd discord is great for finding people
---
But ye I guess this game isn't as much of a problem with a m&amp;k but if people think playing a game like overwatch with a mouse is ok, then they are not just wrong but idiotic. If you can afford a xim which is like £100 I think then you can perhaps afford/save for an actual laptop/PC instead of paying to have an advantage over others. Quite sad if you ask me
---
Hes right, though.
---
And i what is wrong?
---
Thanks for the advice will try!
---
Exactly they say these as if I should believe them with not a single doubt
---
I don’t follow.. they’re not changing any perks just putting 2 together. In fact I feel like that would be better for killers than it would be for survivors. Basically it’s saying if we want more bloodpoints we’d have to submit to the idea of showing our aura to the killers. So it doesn’t matter how many survivors are running it the killers are still going from no clue where anyone to seeing at least one person.
---
And I said I’ll try to find facts, as I already said. I have a job, I don’t just spend my time sitting at the computer waiting to google things lol
---
I recommend Monto, but it’s entirely personal preference! I’ll personally never support Noob because of his actions and handling of his ban
---
Not Otzdarva
---
When you’re learning, remember your power is non lethal so using it can become a hinderance more than anything. If you do find multiple survivors then sure go ham on them but sometimes you don’t really have to use your power to get the first hit because if no one else is around you’ll have to end it to get your second hit in. 
---
The biggest thing to remember about Legion is they aren’t great. Fun? Subjective. Capable? Of course. Great? Not by a long shot. But if you only played killers for being objectively good, your only be playing two killers.
---
I was the same way till I had about 200 hours in. I messed around with the nurse, huntress and trapper until I played hillbilly, now I almost exclusively play him. I guess just play around and see what you like
---
What's wrong with him/her?
---
Don't forget tunnel camp toxic
---
How do you sprint so long? Is it as long as you don't run into anything you'll keep sprinting?
---
Only came here for lightweight.
---
Left disappointed... lol
---
It's true! I saw it, I think it was on ochido's latest compilation
---
He’s thinking “I’m done with this shit”
---
Still sad to see Nea Cuntsson go
---
Yes, as long as you dont hit anything.. And spiked boots and Thompson's moonshine helps with the turns... Hope it helps
---
No that's just his username on youtube
---
I swear the game waits for me to itch my nose to do a skill check
---
Damn! Nice 1.
---
Affirmative
---
I mean, why wouldn't I go for the unhooked surv. I agree that it's kind of toxic and annoying for the unhooked survivor, but if your teammate unhooked right in front of me I would be wasting time and resources if I didn't hit the unhooked survivor.
---
Bingo. 
---
Deny the asshole their “rescue” points/WGLF stack, then punish them.
---
M1 is basic stack, M2 is ability, ie hatchet, chainsaw.
---
Yes plz
---
Oh alright I was pretty confused
---
Thank
---
&gt;Evolve and Dbd don't do this, and so are not competitive games. Rather, they are casual games played by people who are competitive.
---
Again, your mistaking Competitive as in eSports and competitive as a type of game. The ONLY thing competitive means is that your going against another player. It does not mean the game has a ranked mode, it doesn't mean the game has a pro scene, it just means it's a player vs player.
---
You mention "casual" and "competitive" which is not what where talking about, DbD obviously doesn't have a pro scene besides streamers. Need I, yet again, mention how TF2 only had a casual mode, yet was still a competitive game.
---
And the games I mentioned were in terms of balance, R6, Overwatch and CSGO arent  balanced games, you cant say a requirement of a competitive game is balance, when even games that DO have a pro scene arent balanced. 
---
&gt;Evolve and Dbd don't do this, and so are not competitive games. 
---
Again, do I have to mention Evolve did have a competitive scene, it might not have been $50,000 investments like Rainbow or Overwatch, but it still had tournaments for cash prizes and special skins. 
---
&gt;Asymmetry can be made competitive if all players are made to experience both sides if the coin.
---
Do you want to know how to make DbD a competition? Team 1s designated killer vs team 2s designated survivors, and vice versa. Boom, we can make a tournament out of that, actually if you want to be extremely specific, because of Tyde and the Space Esports tournaments, that, by definition, makes DbD a competitive game in both definitions.
---
This is definitely me, except substitute food with trying to drink whatever I have as fast as humanly possible. It is always hilarious because I will never get a skill check until I am too far along to put my drink down. 😂

Technically it would break the antisocial multiplayer system the game wants, where players not in a group can’t talk so you have to work with them with 2 emotes.

I'm almost positive you can't hide devour hopes effects with only using non basic attacks. When a huntress uses noed for example, if she hits them with a hatchet it still gives exposed, and I'm almost positive it works the same way for devour hope

I just watched one of his videos for Entity Education and it’s actually extremely helpful! I’m really glad you recommended him!
---
Yeah but survivors tend to whine more than killers.
---
 a lot of players get into a game knowing damn well they won't complete the game. They're aware, and don't care, because they have to go (blank). I saw it from that perspective. If it's your optimistic Point of view OP was talking about. Then that's completely understandable.
---
On console personally, but typically I just ignore anything that hits my messages; sometimes I’ll point out where they screwed up (“that hiding spot next to the hook wasn’t all that hidden”, or “I heard you cuz I wear headphones, ya ninny”, that kinda thing), but these days I just don’t care enough to respond.

Watch out for the Voorhees family
---
The Entity is like a more powerful version of the Mind Flayer. It can control and manipulate its world and the people that reside in it. The Demogorgon is stuck in the Entity’s realm, no matter if it enters the Upside Down or not, since the Entity itself is allowing the Demogorgon to enter its own created version of the Upside Down.
---
Monto in terms of toxicity (both from him and his community) is fine. He’s not toxic and his community doesn’t start witch-hunts. His videos tho are personal preference, I don’t like them because I prefer more editing and cuts (which he’s trying out). He’s great for people looking to watch more gameplay than meme style videos.
---
I somehow got that one last week I popped off lol

That player had a guaranteed escape had they actually left instead of deciding to stay at exit gate and waste time. At that point they deserve NoEd for the next fifty games.

I think protagonist means main character, and antagonist means the force opposing the protagonist.  Like, the Grinch is a protagonist and happiness/Christmas is the antagonist.

But don't take my word for it.
---
Yes it does.
---
This complaint doesn't make much sense tbh. You don't like the new killer's power, other people do. You like this idea that was related to old Freddy, I personally dislike it. Opinions will be opinions and we shouldn't hold devs to anything based on personal taste. We can express our discontent and thats about it. Congratulate them for whatever they did and be happy (or don't). 
---
&gt;Point is, the creative director for this game is likely either dull and incredibly uncreative or has no incentive to be creative since the game is getting praise for its own short-comings. We shouldn’t continue to let them mash already existing ideas and dynamics and urge them to be challenging themselves with bringing something new and fresh to the table. I know many will disagree and some will have good reasons, but I really think this DLC is disappointing in every way after being offered a huge opportunity for making something new and incentivising.
---
You have to understand that devs are dealing with engine limitation so not everything is achievable or maybe too complex, which also limits how creative they can be. 
---
&gt;I saw a person suggest an idea similar to Old Freddy, like the following; the Demo pulls survivors into the Upside-Down where it thrives (tracks survivors easier, etc) the survivors can find tunnels/holes to escape and the Demo can still attack people in the real world. Creating a Upside-Down/Real World dynamic and a conflict which incentivises the killer to keep people in the UD and the survivors to get out. Although what is done is done, not much can be done about it but this isn’t about suggesting a new ability for the killer it’s about how this idea is far more creative and fresh (again, save for old Freddy) - holding true to the TV series and creating a new dynamic in-game.
---
The problem with this idea is, you need to look OBJECTIVELY at how DBD is played. 90% of the time is merry-go-round while trying to defend gens and sustain map pressure. Old Freddy was weak because seeing survivors is not a big deal if you can't catch them. Being asleep also had an action penalty which made his gameplay boring for survivors so you wouldn't want to see that applied to upside-down.
---
God yes plz

Maybe if people where not bitching 24/7 here about the battle pass, you where now reaching some cells aswell some skins.

I'm sad because I suggested that Bo0b3 should voice the anti-Entity Nea (IE a non-toxic Nea) and my Tweet even got a like from Sam. :c

---
Why should the cap increase per devotion? There's literally no point to that
---
If you play a kill your friends game then you can sort of do that :) just have the survivors run around or something while you get a feel for things and then practice chasing them and stuff
---
Proof has been provided of Noob’s actions. Until you have some for Monto, as he said, he’s not toxic.
---
Bish blind if she didn't notice you when she backed up.
---
Lol. Oh right.
---
I don't like lobby dodging. If I'm going to get stomped, I'm fine with it. It helps me learn. But this didn't help me learn anything about playing better. It was just painful.
---
Strike me down already god, i dont want to live in a world where a toxic shithead voices a stranger thing character, the only thing worse than this would be ochido voicing the character.

You can also quick tap your shocks to grab off hooks. Since cancelling the shock has no cooldown, you can just keep going until they get grabbed or give up.

We got 3 back to back licensed DLCs, my bet is the next chapter will be original.

Regardless of the game, that one dude is just complainig about teammates, you're the one claiming you would leave them to die in real life if you could, jeez

You made a claim, you back it up. You don't go when people haven't heard shit of what you're talking about "Waaah find it yourself", it has never worked that way.

XBox: LB, LT, RB, RT?

If you can't dazzle them with your aim, baffle them with your hatchet.

Cuuute!

I swear to god if the demogorgon doesn't at least have one addon of some form of Nougat bar I will flip lmao

Besides batting chases for 20 minutes

That stuff is so irrelevant to his content it's laughable you think that's a reason not to watch him. I bet you thought James Gunn was deplorable when his tweets from 5+ years ago got him fired...

Just click the link and give me my upvote. Its a
---
a subreddit, it has the r/ on it
---
That's fine, it's ok to not want to, but it's natural for people to assume you at least have some inkling of serious agreement with the point made in a joke/meme post, and so they want to talk about it. You have no obligation to respond to them or talk about it if you don't want to though, that's fine.

Fair enough. Then i dont see why not either.
---
Oh my God I wasn't expecting that! That's hilarious. RIP you, OP.
---
*sad doctor noises*
---
Uhh okay?👍 agree with the ochido part but overall pretty unnecessary
---
Oh shit I play xbox and I messed up controls.  M1 =  RT and M2 = LT for killer.  For survivor it is bumpers instead of triggers.  My bad.
---
She's actually the first of her kind that I've seen. Every other survivor has been really respectful.
---
Do i look like a firefighter?
---
Oh you got that right
---
Just using the in-game report function should be enough because it creates logs that CMs can look at.

Noticed how the date he received BHVR's email and when he posted it are almost 4 months apart. He let his fanbase harass BHVR for a third of a year before coming out and saying his ban was deserved. Absolutely scummy.
---
Uhh, there is literally a game that hasn't released yet in the poll. Fuck that.
---
That will also give you less blood points too though. Dont get me wrong I love when getting salt, find I hilarious, but to do something just to ruin the fun of others is just kinda bitch made.
---
So you don’t care if the person making content is a murderer as long as he makes YouTube videos that make you chuckle?
---
Pretty idiotic stance. Jesus Christ.
---
M1 and M2 means Mouse button 1 and mouse button 2. On Xbox it means LT and RT, on PS4 it means L2 and R2
---
I highly doubt their is a subreddit with my username on it considering I made this account like 4 days ago
---
Sometimes I let them go. You got balls kid...
---
While he should've been truthful with that, seemingly the reason was getting back legacy skins that he owned in the first place?
---
 He should've just said that, it's a bad ban reason in the first place so it be better, and he did apologize that he didn't.
---
Noob3 is the best 🥰
