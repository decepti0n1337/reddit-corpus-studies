Doc’s most viable build is 3 gen. Doc’s not very viable at rank 1 because random skillchecks do basically nothing against good survivors, his anti loop with his shock is inconsistent at best, and the amount of time it takes to get people into madness 3 is disproportionate to how easy it is to snap out of it. Doc’s game stall basically only works if Doc stalls himself (ie shocking people instead of hitting them).
---

---
However his 3 gen build can lead to disgusting games that are unwinnable for survivors. Basically throw on Distressing/Unnerving/Overcharge/whatever the fuck 4th perk you want, and defend the 3 closest gens from the beginning til the end of the match. Only problem with this build is that it’s fucking boring (ESPECIALLY for the survivors) and also all of your games will last like 30 minutes. Good survivors will know that you won’t leave your 3 gens so whenever they’re in danger they’ll run to the other side of the map. If you chase them you lose, if you don’t chase them they heal up and you rinse and repeat patrolling your 3 gens for 3 hours.

I always stay on the hook. If the killer facecamps w.e my team gets a better shot and he gets a shittier score. Dcing only benefits the killer and rage quitters are too selfish and stupid to realise it. Go on your phone. Waste his time. Tap a button. Waste his time. Congrats you ruined the killers game as he ruined yours. You made 3 others happy.
---
That doesn't have anything to do with it, I was just sharing a similar experience having plenty of fun with an ability rather than by killing, that's what games are about anyway, just as long as you have fun
---
I should mention something here.
---
The amount of detail that went into the animation is craaazy.
---
Look at the mori at 0.25x speed on YT, and keep looking at the bkade, it's pretty amazing.
---
Easily my favorite mori in the game.
---
Legit, my ears are dumb enough to somehow think they're GENERATOR SOUNDS.
---
Also, if you're salty about prayer beads. Fine, we can all agree it and omegablink nurse have to go. But stop trying to ruin one of the most interesting ability characters killers have. Might as well just throw shit as clown and huntress.
---
No
---
I just do one. Toxic people will do many of them. You can also relinquish any item you are holding.
---
There is a very small chance of that happening you got lucky
---
Are the adept killer achievements fixed yet? I got a ruthless killer but still got the achievement, but I double pipped as well, so I’m curious if they made it easier or if I just have to double pip
---
I’m sorry, I meant tru3ta1ent, not OhTofu. OhTofu is funny too. Mixed up the names.
---
A gun would be nice if it could stun the killer, but not kill him
---
Also, why should the survivor hold all the cards in your argument? As the killer, aren't they theoretically supposed to be the power role. If it's already a 4v1 and I'm supposed to let survivors have all the information. I lose when I decide to play the role.

I wish I'd have recorded it now for proof it was on haddonfield against ghostface, it has to have been a bug as most the people I played with were also new.
---
I know you're closed minded and wouldn't bother taking anything I wrote into account. But if I atleast get more people talking about her than that means I've atleast got people talking about balance instead of "oh some people enjoy it".
---
This wasn't meant for you, it was meant for open minded people. You're still allowed to have an opinion as am I. Have a nice day :)
---
No it's just a really lucky thing to happen
---
Thank you!
---
Those eyes make worth sacrificing for the unhook and save of Meg. &lt;3
---
I would buy that print! That is some serious high quality work. I love your use of colour and her mischievous facial expression.
---
Because most killers aren’t the power role so when a killer is the power role,people think they’re OP.
---
Well, I see you're one of those people, who ends debates with personal attacks.
---
Fun.
---
She's an annoying killer to play against every game. This is a true statement. However, after 50 games of just looping.... looping........ looping, you wouldn't agree that a character that adds something different at least spices the game up for people who do that shit all day.
---
It doesn’t
---
4% chance each time
---
I'm not sure how they could even change his power at this point. He's one of the only killers who has absolutely nothing in terms of killing power. He can almost guarantee the first hit but unless the survivor messes up a ton, he'll usually get fudged over by long window loops. 
---
Even Wraith has windstorm, Freddy has traps/fake pallets, and Pig has a situational dash mindgame. Legion is the only killer who is currently punished in a chase by using his power.
---
Unfortunately if you buff Legion's power by adding any killing ability or reducing the stun significantly, he ends up mind-numbingly easy to tunnel someone down over the course of a minute or two with.
---
He's fine at mid ranks, but boy does he suffer later on. And SpiritFury/Enduring is just a band-aid that shouldn't be necessary for him to work.
---
Rank 20 Meg: *wastes pallet while I’m 20 feet away* *tbags*
---
The Pig is getting some skins in the near future. I still think her prestige skins look better than the new ones.
---
You have a 4% chance of unhooking yourself.
---
Just give me my mettle of man replacement
---
Lol my friends and I went against him a couple of weeks ago and didn’t realise it was him. None of us were playing seriously and were just having a laugh/ fucking around and the dude read into EVERYTHING we did. Literally mind gamed himself thinking we had a big plan to beat him when we were all just playing for fun. 
---
He also complained about SWF and toxicity and had his viewers insulting in chat despite the fact he won quite early on because we weren’t playing that great. I felt bad for one of my friends who was a fan of his and saw it because Tru3 was being so negative over nothing. Dude takes DBD too seriously, ofc that’s gonna encourage sniping.
---
I'm not expecting to get a 4k every game, I got a whole map to cover and the person I'm looking for is about 1/248 of that space. Also, they have a ton of mechanics to help them escape. Low tier killers are fun, they are designed to be interesting taking into account the game will probably be a loss unless you've completely mastered that killer. However, most killers revolve around M1, and the ones that don't, are hated without realizing it's the only thing that makes this game not a monotonous mess.
---
Stream snipers in general are garbage regardless of your feelings on tru3
---
Good to know!
---
OH MY GOD OF COURSE DELIVERENCE POPS UP IN THE SHRINE RIGHT AFTER I BUY ADAM AND START LEVELING HIM UP. I'VE GOTTEN HIM UP TO LEVEL 28!
---
Mine is clown. Thats right clown. He is pretty solid at dropping clouds on folks and ending loops very quickly. Plus i really enjoy the circus music. So there is that.
---
Ok...so this is the best one of these I've seen. The gladiator and survivor arent bad a little unbalanced but not too heavily. I would keep everything except the first killer perk. I would tweak the numbers a bit, but this is a great concept. Not bad OP.
---
Me and my friends thought that as well!!
---
Lol
---
Legion is really fun to play. If you want them go for it.
---
Bamboozle is very clutch sometimes.
---
#26 on Trending damn the Dead by Daylight community is super active.
---
I got Adept Legion a day or two ago so it should work. I think you just need a 4k but I also got four iridescents so I'm not sure.
---
What the fuck
---
I have slippery meat is that why?
---
well thats ur opinion, mine is when playing solo against a good killer, every second counts, and ur loosing time clensing and searching, and pls, dont tell me to use small game, my point is... if there was a totam counter at least, noed would be fine, and not only that but noed is actually a perk that survivors control more than the killer... dont u think there is something wrong there?
---
maybe he has a Rage ability that charges, and he can just walk through pallets if it's charged with no stun?
---
We only have like 3 viable killers against top tier SWF lets not lower that number
---
Updooted for the quick information :)
---
I rarely play against a camping doctor. But I've definitely played against my fair share of doctors who tunnel.
---
Thank you for such detailed responses. I think I'll try legion after Im done with Bubba farming. Or is it better to get Plague in your opinion?
---
"That's just your opinion" ok, Jan. 
---
&gt;and ur loosing time clensing and searching, and pls, dont tell me to use small game, my point is... if there was a totam counter at least, noed would be fine
---
**And before someone says "But if we do totems, that's less time on gens!", yeah, it is. Funny how that works. This whole game is risk and reward, and it is literally an exercise in learning how to manage your time. Survivors don't seem to like risk and the unknown, and... that's just too bad. Do the totems or risk getting smacked in the face with NOED, kids.**
---
Yeah, the increase in purge effectiveness basically means how quickly a survivor will become infected but I'm not certain of its only through getting directly hit by the power or if its for all methods of infection.
---
I don't see much point in infecting anything other than generators you have just damaged, mainly because it can give a slight indication to which generators are being worked on if the survivors are feeling risky or to just deny generator progression. What I would say though, don't prioritise infecting objects, focus on chasing survivors and just hitting them with your vomit. Fully infecting a survivor for them to get unhooked just keeps the infection running naturally.
---
Or being a fucking ghost
---
Imagine a game in the style of friday with Dbd's vairety of maps, killers, survivors, and perks
---
Keep Noed the same, but maybe add your perk as another perk
---
Me too, I was like “wait does the killer know where I am?” And when I was playing killer I was like, “where are the survivors? Aren’t they exposed?”
---
I'm sorry about the formatting, I don't usually do big posts on Reddit that much, I'll try to fix it up as much as I can.
---
f
---
The only thing that actually needs changing involved with spirit is prayer beads. Everything else is fine
---
Literally the same holy shit I'm shook
---
There's nothing wrong with me as far as I know, I'd just like for her to be able to have more control over her power and have it not be left to random chance with passive phasing, but still keep that as a "secondary ability" and be able to balance it out between being able to mind game more efficiently and still be able to get to people further away without taking away her core design.
---
I didn't mean for it to seem like a nerf, sorry about that.
---
Where'd you get your N-Word pass from?
---
Only through direct the purple add on I forget what it is specifies interaction with object
---
It’s because dumb people think dedicated servers will fix every problem the game has so they just spam WHERES DEDICATED SERVERS on the forums
---
that's kinda what I implied with undead, but yea Spirit wouldn't be bothered by it, not to be confused with Ghost Face, who is probably one of the only few you probably can take out with a gun.
---
That was last week for me. Know the feels.
---
She already is balanced she's one of th most balanced killers in the game. No reworks.
---
Pretentious hipster alert!
---
For me Freddy never was in F tier. The current Freddy is definitely better than LF, Trapper, Doctor or Legion...
---
Bamboozle is usually just okay, but can also shut down some of the strongest loops in the game, Third Seal is pretty bad but has some use in slugging builds, Wake Up is pretty bad, and Deliverence is situational.
---
So two highly inconsistent perks, and two perks that are mediocre at best.
---
Maybe you should not be in McDonalds using their wifi.
---
Hefty hefty hefty
---
Bout time she’s one of my favorites even though she isn’t the best she’s fun
---
Amazing 10/10 ( not joking ) and I mean the reply not the post which is good too
---
Lmao, implying that survivors addons are more broken than killers.
---
Stealth doesn't mean anything in this game. Also it works once per match...
---
Dude the only rework she needs is instead of just standing to use her Power, she can just keep moving and use her power. Don’t know why you have to stay still for it.
---
Why didn’t you do shirtless Myers???
---
I really don't know why flashlights are labeled as toxic. Yes they're annoying if someone can use them well but they're no worse than toolboxes or medkits. In fact I'd wager that toolboxes are worse since flashlights can only be used if you give the Survivors an opening to do so. Compared to toolboxes I don't find them nearly as bad as toolboxes let Survivors complete their only objective with no downside or skill involved.
---
If you click your flashlight then yeah, but still.
---
Lol, he's getting destroyed, I don't even have to type.
---
Nice repost
---
I never thought about her being able to move then use her power. It'd definitely open up some interesting plays, especially at loops.
---
Yes because gates are so fast to open when you're the only survivor left. Endgame IS killer sided because if the killer closes the hatch the last survivor's chance of escape is extremely low.
---
Thank you
---
&gt;same hits that shouldn't have. Yes it might be better because the lagswitching and DC abuse might be gone but I thought it was also supposed to fix the hitbox issue?
---
We love to see it. Anyone that understands a little of how online gaming works knew that servers wouldn't fix "unfair" hits. 
---
Well, this is what people will get for jumping in the bandwagon of "hitbox complaints" when the actual issue is ping related and there is no way to fix this unless you play on LAN environment. 
---
&gt;Opinions of the servers? I wanna know your experience so far, to me it feels the same. Even with just 50-90 ping which is green, it's bad.
---
50ms and even 90ms is not that bad when it comes to ping, specially in a game that doesn't involve accuracy like a shooter, for example. 
---
Servers are a huge deal that will allow devs to have more control over the game, opening the possibility of different game modes, stricter punishments for DCing and completely getting rid of lag switching. It will bring the desperately needed function of maintaining a SWF lobby. 
---
Survivors shouldn't see much difference in the gameplay but it will affect killers because they will have to deal with lag input and this is incredibly annoying. During the first servers PTB it wasn't good but they claimed it wasn't the final stage so fingers crossed.
---
Exactly! It just seems like an issue.
---
that was probably it and I didn't see it or someone had hope as a perk
---
Yeah that’s a pretty good build. BBQ and Ruin are two staple killer perks. You can switch out Discordance for something else but it’s a great perk to use. 4th perk depends on what teachables you have. If you don’t have many teachables you can never go wrong with Sloppy Butcher.
---
Imagine being that bothered and pathetic about a repost.
---
I mean, you don't see many Jakes around often, so you've gotta get those kills as Bubba when you can.
---
and then  we go again... u can loose a lot of time cleansing all totems and trying to find them, but what if they add a totem counter at least, and lets be honest... who the fuck cares about totem, and yea, lets make the survivor experience pretty boring searching all totems
---
Min Feng is stupid for luring trapper to Claudette then unhook her to get you off her, and tunnel Claudette.
---
EVERYONE, GET TOO THE SAFE ROOM!
---
Dead by Daylight get your free killer  Here
---
The image I used is called the masters blessing look it up and it should be the first thing you find
---
It's a chrome-face mask. I dig it
---
This would be amazing, even if it is stupidly broken. Would be so funny if the survivor aimed for the killer but shoots another survivor instead xD.
---
let me guess, you sit on gens all game and have never have fun. Who cares man.
---
i’ve been having this problem a lot lately but i’m not sure how to fix it. really fucks up healing and hook saves but sometimes if u pause for a second then press again it’ll work, but this is mostly survivor sided :/

Preach
---
Aye, she's not free on PC, neither is the doctor.
---
I don't have to imagine, I've experience it myself. I'm not arguing for purely on side of the game. I play both killer and survivor. And my attitude is simply that I find most rules and complaints dumb. People in this community keep on making up new names for just playing the game in an effort to shame and ridicule and I just don't get that mentality. I get it that certain things suck about this game and a lot of people get apparently very upset over it, but it doesn't mean anyone needs to lash out about it. I get "tunneled" and I get "camped", I get "gen rushed" and I get hella lot of abuse from survivors in post game chat no matter how I play. I've seen it all and been through it all. But when shitty stuff happens to me in game, like waiting 20 minutes for a 5 minute game, I sigh at it sucking and move on. I don't shame the survivors for doing gens fast. I'd rather talk about how the game can be improved so a match takes longer. I just want actual changes to how a match plays out, things that are enforced, not stuff that is 100% optional to follow and can always be ignored. I guess I'm in the minority, but I hate the community mentality of both sides with all the made up rules on how everyone "ought to play". To me there is only what the game allows and tells us to do, rest is up to the individual, and because of that I accept that some people want to play this game their way. Some want to face camp 24/7 and they can do that. I don't enjoy it, but they probably do. I accept all perks, I accept all killers, and I accept all playstyles. Not all that I enjoy or want to see, but they are all allowed to exist for as long as the game functions the way it does. And I won't lash out at people who wants to play differently than I do.
---
I agree he sometimes goes overboard. But have you seen the last few days at least? The same two or three snipers have been in nearly every match he's played. These guys are toxic beyond belief. Disgusting individuals. I think Tru3 has a bit of PTSD from snipers to the point he tends to think they're there when they aren't.
---
[Exposed status effect and heartbeat]
---
I'm in danger.
---
You clearly never played against/as a plague with haunted ground, it's deadly when you have corrupt purge at the right time
---
yeah she’s base on console, but not on pc
---
I've been facecamped loads of times because I looped a killer for quite a long time, and no I did not teabag or spam flashlight as most people assume on this subreddit.
---
I haven’t seen. Been watching his YouTube more so lately. But that sucks if that’s happening. And shitty that they get matched up so often! I imagine there’s so many people playing that there should be variety of mixed hosts.
---
Or maybe you're actually just not that good at it :/
---
Lol I didn't say it was an entity, I said it was like one. I do know what I'm talking about, I've watched the show, thank you. If The Entity of Dead by Daylight takes people from our world to it's own dimension to kill or feed off of them or their emotions just as the "Demogorgon" (proper spelling of that by the way just thought I'd let you know and you spell damn with an n, I'm sure you're aware) then I'd say they are comparable. Thank you for your, I'm sure very well thought out, completely logical response.
---
happened to me twice on the same day this weekend:
---
once grabbing from the ruin totem (imagine my feeling when the grab action freezed and little clau kept doing the totem, ended up with her dcing/losing connection and the totem was intact)
---
second time: on a locker grab, the survivor didn't get freeze this time (only me) and he got some free distance
---
Legion Dafuq?
---
YoU hAvE tO lOoK aT hIm
---
I didn't mean to offend you man, I genuinely wanted to know your opinions on it, for me it felt the same connection wise, but better features such as DC consequences and no lagswitching.
---
It cant be punished during endgame and when it's basement leatherface.
---
Actually, I preform them quite often because I practised for a long time. I am not an ignorant biased player like you.
---
I love flashlight squads. Easy hits once you fake the pickup.
---
I've already spotted 7 comments turning it against survivors.
---
Its punished by everyone else escaping at endgame.
---
It can be punished by everyone else escaping.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Even thats sounds better than the freedy rework
---
Tunneling hmm, its a lot easier to kill the idiot running no mither than a meg with adrenaline and sprint burst.
---
Nurse &amp; Trapper get some pretty sick skins, meanwhile Billy always looks like he lost a bet
---
I agree with the second part. But LAN isn't the only fix, you dont see those kind of "laggy" hits in games such as csgo unless you have pretty high ping. I'm sure they could look into it when dedicated servers come out, from my experience so far it's not much different from the live servers, which on final release I hope is better.
---
Ain't nobody got time for that!
---
Ash Williams as jerry, shaggy as tom.
---
On all levels except physical, I am a Dwight
---
Then i closed the hatch and moried him.
---
Lol pathetic
---
Games never been easier for killers and still people like him complain
---
wait, what leather outfit?
---
When it comes to him, you are.
---
Then you asked for the wrong term. You can ask in the twitch or youtubers subs about recommendations of software to record your gameplays
---
You're reaching sooo far. Keep trying I know you can do it
---
If No Mother lvl. 3 is 50% reduced grunts of pain, and I also use Iron Will lvl. 1 which is also 50% reduced pain, does it stack to 100%, or is it 50% across the board?
---
Deliverance only works on your first hook because it's the only time when you can attempt to free yourself and Deerstalker is only for survivors on the ground, not normal injured ones. Hope I helped!
---
1) Automatically Die
---
2) No, it would be supremely broken if so.
---
Maybe they mean they got them stuck in a corner and just stalked them to get tier 3
---
Its actually not a reportable offense. 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system
---
Its scummy, but you're free to do it.
---
1. Deliverance can only be used during your first time on the hook/attempt phase.
---
2. Dying Survivor auras are survivors who are on the ground already, not injured survivors.
---
Isn't against twitch TOS
---
Not when the killer can see you. 
---
However knowing they are following your scratches from a distance a mix up could help. Only example I can think if is running to a door but then walk around the door. Killer has a 50/50 chance of picking right or wrong where you went.
---
- rank 11 survivor and killer
---
That person is a dumb asshole. Red ranks are boring as fuck as everyone there has already figured out the best possible perk combinations and already has detailed memories of where things are in the map. You'll only see Nurses, Spirits and Billys for killers. They are not the ideal. They are boring.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That said basing all 3 perks around chests isn't gonna work.
---
Well I mean you’re doing what you’re supposed to be doing. I don’t get these people that just expect you to let them repair gens &amp; escape without you trying to capture them lol
---
It’s against “player law”(personal term for it). Basically you might not be banned but you will be socially hung by the whole community of the game and some others.
---

I think so but I feel like if there is a “battle pass” behavior should make it free or at least cost bloodshard

Why do you care so much? Good lore isn't required for the game to be enjoyable, it's just extra

This is amazing dude

I let go survivors who seem to have crappy teammates. Mainly when rank 20s or 15s go for wildly stupid hook saves.

Came here to make this comment.

Yes I did watch the clip. which part of my previous comment you don’t understand?.

Thanks for -1

You are wrong

I got you. All of them are 2000 Iridescent Shards this week.

isn't it implied in the lore that david kinda likes all the bloodshed cause of his days as a street brawler? he should be in "fucking finally" too but for different reasons than Jake lol

Nice dude! I just wish you could have played on a better piano it would sound much better in that style on a stand up.
---
Happy for Samination.

Having the same problem. Xbox One.

Sometimes they aren't even rank 20 lol.
---
The Ghostface is Linked to the entity, he's licensed but he shares a connection with it.

Ah, okay. I saw the outfits, but I thought you meant there was a cosmetic for leatherface or something that i didn't know about. I'm a fool, I know.

Aw hell yeah, thanks for the info.

Yeah I know right. I miss the vibrations of a real piano. Keyboards really don’t do it. It’s like tofu😂😂😂
---
Mate spirit is fine you just don’t want people to have fun and variety at high ranks
---
I like that idea
---
Ur braindead bro. We're talking about going after dumbasses who just throw down pallets when your chasing and don't loop.
---
Ha! Pissed at you for having them waste their offering because you were doing what the killer is supposed to but apparently you’re not. “Stand by &amp; let me repair gens &amp; escape in peace please”
---
Yep. Was pretty concerned when I was new. Figured I was lit up or something and hiding wouldn't help.
---
Thankfully that's not the case.
---
That’s a shit build now god help you unless you kill baby Dwight’s then your going to die in the Area 51 raid
---
Then why doesn’t he block his screen while waiting for a lobby if it’s that big of an issue.  I’ve seen other streamers hide their lobby and load outs to prevent this.
---
Discordance is a really good perk. And legion is fun to play. Just don’t expect to be top tier with him/her.
---
Incredibles
---
Wait really!? That's terrifying, I'm guessing it was a glitch...
---
Lmao if toxic survivors are rushing Area 51 three I might have to play spirit with prayer beads and protect Area 51 enjoy no Ed and ruin :)
---
It's so hard to play against for new survivors but once you learn how to play against her it's fun. (Excluding prayer bead bs.)
---
There's no chat on console and on PS4 you can set it so only friends can send you messages. No idea about xbox though.
---
idk as killer I have got window hits that I had to stop for a second cause I could not believe I got lol
---
A youtuber named Ussylis made a video on flashlights, you should definitely watch it.
---
Personally I thing Spirit is one of the most balanced killers in the game. She takes skill to play and it is fun to do so, not to mention as a survivor she makes the game scary like it ***should be*** as an asymmetrical ***horror*** game.
---
Well I'm alright with it. Got some ideas out, people didn't like it and that's fine. It's a little sad that people took issue with the rework idea and near enough ignored the part where I said "say your own ideas", but I guess I finally got the confirmation that Reddit is kinda not great for discussions.
---
I'd rather take to discord or the forums at this point because there are people there who are willing to discuss what'd be interesting or fun. If you find it funny, that's alright. If you get off to it, that's also alright. But I am personally disappointed that more people didn't throw in their 2 cents. Maybe people don't like change or think that every single idea is a "nerf".
---
Anyways, I don't wish you any ill thoughts and I still hope you have a nice day.
---
Correct
---
Then im probably also the only person in this entire community that hates the Scary Movie's and cringes everytime someone says ''WAAZAAAAAPP'' relating to Ghostface. K

Does this glad has a move that is stabbing your toes will yelling "Mars me adiuvat"!?

And the next day they post „why are survivors not scared of us?“

„Because you are whiny bitches, maybe?“

Nurse’s legs wtf? Im burning my eyes

FINISH IN COMMENTS - I've never been reported for what someone would call 'cheating' as far as I know. The only thing I got was a comms ban once for like, calling someone an ass or something. Do I need to worry?
---
Under. I’ve only seen one person ever die from her traps, and there’s the issue that her traps don’t do anything if put on after the last gen is popped. Her traps overall need to be made better at stalling for time.

Would say 7, but theres already a different one.

While I agree that camping sucks, it is intrinsic to hag’s design. She makes a web around her gens/hooks and defends with unparalleled ferocity. 10 might be a bit much. I usually drop one on the side I think the saver is coming from and move on. Better chance for devour hope stacks.

Pop Goes the Weasel rank 2, Blood Hound rank 2, Hex: Devour Hope rank 1, Make Your Choice rank 1, with Swift Hunt Blood and Windstorm Blood for offering on Léry's.

---
No way Warner bros is letting shaggy get grotesquely murdered in multiple ways.
---
I just look at a wall, it usually works
---
As someone who has stream sniped before (but played normally):
---
It works by the killer (or survivor) queueing at similar times. Depending on the q times, the survivor might need to queue later and the killer might need to queue earlier. If you’re doing with friends: The killer needs to q and sew how long the q is. Then the killers back out when they get in a lobby and the killer says how long to wait. The survivor then gets in at the set time. 
---
You both also need to be of similar rank. It’s also based on luck when doing it with friends
---

---
Would it be worth getting the third seal? It seems good unless they find the totem at the start and for survivor would deliverance be good?
---
Well my own fault for trying to start a discussion on a shitpost, even if the discussion post didn't go anywhere. I just hope that you all take some ideas and engage with the community more so that the game can be fun for everyone.
---
Yeah, I did it in a shitty way and even when I tried to make a normal discussion it got bombed, and I'm okay with that. There were at least a few people who had some creative and interesting ideas and to those I'd like to say thank you. It's nice to see people are invested in the game in a way that they want to see it grow more and improve upon areas that some see problematic.
---
I would also like to thank all of you who down voted this post so I can find a better way to discuss ideas, which in a shit post was quite a big mistake. I don't mind being clowned on and I know not to take any of this personally.
---
I will say "changes don't mean nerfs". Just because I don't find something fun, doesn't mean I'm terrible against it. I'd much rather have a Spirit that has more control over her ability so she can focus more on the situation at hand. But, as show here on Reddit no one liked the way that I put it. Again, thank you for the contribution, it was at least interesting to see what people thought about Spirit on Reddit, even if it was met with some mild aggression.
---
I wish all of you a good day.

I thought so for like a month before going "how the fuck does he not see me behind this rock?!" And my friend was like "because it's exposed not anything else."
---
You're fine.  I've been reported 15+ times for "Lag Switching". Nothing has ever happened.
---
And? I find him funny.
---
Had a swf all message me after the game that it's "unfair" to stop chasing someone and go check a generator or something else.  It wasn't nice because they worked so hard to keep me distracted.
---
Reminded me of this.
---
The Moro idea reminds me of this for honor execution.

No, it was on the corn map with the barn and I play on PS4 os I don’t know how long I’ve played
---
You can download the font [here](https://fontmeme.com/dead-by-daylight-font/), or just Google "Roboto Light" to find a download link. As long as you don't use it for commerical purposes (IE don't sell it) it's fine.
---
They confirmed with the new challenges we’ll get small cut scenes as rewards
---
Had a game this morning where someone tried that, I ignored them, and in the end-game chat they said "sorry, guess the killer didn't feel like chasing me". No, I didn't. I felt like chasing the people who were doing objectives.
---
I agree yeah I think that would definitely help.
---
He has some reason for it "not working" but I can't see why
---
Meg head
---
What are teammates so bad, on rank reset? It’s a legitimate question.
---
And spirit fury.
---
In my case, it’s always a Claudette who then gets hit for absolutely no fucking reason.
---
My favorite games are the ones where one or more players follow me around and click flashlights or fast vault windows near me all match while I go about my daily buisness. It's like a Survivor comes pre-moried!
---
To this day I still remember the match I had as (Wraith I think) where three Claudettes and a Meg spent the entire match running around me clicking their flashlights and teabagging. 4 kills, zero gens done, even though they all had Borrowed Time and Dead Hard and (pre-nerf) Borrowed Time and the likes.
---
It's almost like you need to *do the objective* in order to escape! (gasp!)
---
Thats funny. How did you come up with that joke?
---
The rework looks awesome! Good job, devs!
---
Usually no but i play ghostface and it’s a good counter to aura reading perks. Also legion is good with it because it’s every time you hit someone it gives them blindness but for any other killer really it’s terrible
---
This meme literally gets reposted every week at least once. I'm so tired of it.
---
Low end of mid tier
---
Same. You can't successfully blame someone else for your mistakes.
---
Nah, the whole point is people are dumb enough to drop pallets before you walk through, so just respect every last one of them and insta-break them
---
The first one had me chuckling, the second one legit made me tear up a bit laughing.
---
How am I wrong? The game would be super unfair if the killer could just do whatever they want and survivors could'nt do jack shit to counter it.
---
I love how I had the exact same reaction as you the first time someone did that to me
---
Now I don't even feel anything anymore
---
I’ve done this but left the Ebony Mori at home for a rainy day and none of my survivors DC and I also made sure to not just use the hatchets. These games are normally over quick and then if the killer decides to will farm with the last survivor so they can max out there points to have a easy game!
---
What you say?
---
Yep. The devs say that it's balanced because there's multiple counters. Survivors just don't want to *do* those counters because it prevents them from genrushing.
---
He has a point, ya know...
---
I love when I’m staring back right into the pits of his soul and I’m still not breaking him out of stealth.
---
Chromeface hype
---
Rip me
---
I’m sorta new to this game, ( I’ve been playing almost 2 months now I think) and I’ve just maxed out Meg to level 50 but I was curious what will happen if I prestige her? I know it’ll be like  going back to level 1 but do I gain anything from it? Thanks :)
---
What perks actually affect killers directly? I know Decisive Strike and the one where you slam the locker door at them are two, but are there any more?
---
Scratched mirror slows him down a bit. And if someone is running hope, without NOED, you can't catch up to them if the exits are lowered.
---
Were you the team I faced today?
---
I think once we get dedicated servers this will fix allot of things. That peer to peer garbage just doesn’t cut it!
---
&gt; u can loose a lot of time cleansing all totems and trying to find them
---
I have literally told you this twice now: this game is basically a time management simulator. You're meant to try and balance cleansing totems with doing gens and pretty much everything else. Don't ask the devs to make something easier for you just because you don't want to focus on that thing. No totem counter needed. 
---
&gt; who the fuck cares about totem
---
You should, since NOED is countered by cleansing all the totems. 
---
&gt; lets make the survivor experience pretty boring searching all totems
---
I'd imagine holding M1 and pressing spacebar every so often for the whole game before running out of the match would be boring, but I don't see you advocating for anything else besides pounding out gens ASAP. It's the survivors' job to make their own experience fun, not the killer's. If you don't want to face NOED, just do the totems. There's four of you, one each and the last one getting two shouldn't be that damn big of a problem or too time consuming. You're making this out to be a bigger issue than it really is.
---
some guy told me that i lagged switch, it was my first time playing on pc i didn’t even know how to crouch let alone lag switch lol
---
YESYOU HAD KINDRED!!! The best feeling is when someone has kindred while they are getting  camped it’s like public shaming.
---
Yea definitely no need to feel bad considering your builds weren’t exactly meta and since(unless he took a long break and just came back) with maxed perks and a Mori at rank 20 he probably deranked
---
Don’t worry! Even if you really were “lag switching” I pretty sure it’s not a ban able offense so your all good
---
It just occurred to me I've never seen the huntress mori in my entire life, I have a platinum trophy and haven't even had a "use huntress nerd" mori challenge
---
Ahahaha I love this
---
I feel like the order should be reversed, how can david scream if he's just had his head caved in by an axe
---
I like it. I'm a killer main but I play with my friend when he's online and bp for survivor is terrible.
---
Wait did they actually say that it’s unfair that your doing your job as a killer stopping generator repairs?
---
Go for the sniper doc build with interview tape and an electrode for more range. Pick a totem of your liking and thrill of the hunt. With your shock range you can easily protect your totems since you get notified. Put sloppy butcher in there because you may have to break chases to protect totems. 4th perk is up to you. Nurse's, chili, discordance all work for map pressure.
---
any way I could get just the face? it looks like it has meme potential
---
What is this? An honorable person?? ON MY DBD SUBREDDIT?!?
---
It's really not self explanatory, this whole post is a mess
---
Hag should be top tier. She has the best mori in game.
---
But it's a scratched mirror myers though...
---
It's almost impossible to do, but using the flashlight as it was actually intended instead of to harass players locked into animations is really commendable.
---
I hate people who still think legion is toxic
---
tbh, i almost put her top tier but i needed someone for the second row lol
---
Based on the fact most of the cosmetics discovered lately have a beach/aquatic theme it is assumed they will be part of "beach bash" themed event. Just the rumor around the mill.
---
Aren’t they always 2000 shards each?
---
I think bubba should be with hag but that’s just my opinion
---
Ikr? Imagine PC Nurses going against console or even better yet, mobile survivors!
---
My problem with noed is even if you do all the totems you are always taking a risk by doing them. So even if the killer isn't running noed the survivors will waste very valuable time doing the totems for no reason. I feel like it could be nerfed in a few ways. They should either do 4 totems or reduce the time it takes to cleanse dull totems. If anyone wants to discuss please do so instead of downvoting and saying nothing
---
Pretty sneaky, sis.
---
Damnit beat me to it
---
Unrelated, but I just thought of a map for ghost face. The shopping center from the trailer would be a pretty cool idea
---
also you get a bloody cosmetic, which is the main reason to do it. The rarity thing is a really small boost, it isnt noticeable for the most part
---
Bro today I got this guy that said I was a “sweaty tryhard” for killing him and not letting him escape due to him having a daily which when I told him that he said  “your so toxic farmer” implying that I was the one begging to farm! This community is fantastic
---
No, they can be 2700 as well if it’s their first appearance in the Shrine.
---
Console includes the first 4 dlcs.
---
One time I was playing nurse and I lagged for like half the game and didn’t get a single kill and they accused me of lag switching
---
I think the feeling is more residual when flashlight saves used to be super easy. (And I'm not just talking about that one week of o instablinds). Getting saves was super common and flashlights were very much hated by killer mains to the point where people ran solely anti-flashlight builds. Shit, I still face walls or bait out saves when I go to pick someone up.
---
So I think that mindset is still spilling over into today's younger playerbase from the older people.
---
Plus an argument can be made for people who like to click it at you.
---
I don’t even go to the exit. I just go do something else while we all wait for the tbaggers to finally leave.
---
Agreed, they just take more skill now to use.
---
(Don’t take my word on this cause the only DLC I have is legion who I bought with shards and the free dark lullaby) I think that when you re download dead by daylight it saves all your progress and all you need to do is re download the DLC and you should be all good to go
---
Tbh, and no offense, but most survivor cosplay is just regular clothes and some blood.
---
Now a Painted face, metal Jeff Cosplay? I'll be truly impressed.
---
I can only see your shirt straps and face, so I have 0 idea what work went into this.
---
I bet the generators wil look cool again, I wonder if they'll make them slurpies again
---
I just bought surveillance. Should I have waited for bamboozle or am I alright for now?
---
Impressive. The saltiest two I ever got were "FU" to a "gg" (I was Huntress with common addons) and someone who unhooked directly in front of me complaining that they shouldn't have been downed when I lunged through their attempt to infinite the bus.
---
I don't understand how the picture relates to your title
---
He is a low c tier killer, not to great but really fun
---
Underpowered. Traps need to be more deadly and harder to take off. She’s supposed to “stall” the game but for her traps to even activate generators need to be completed. 
---
Survivors shouldn’t be able to search for the key if their RBT is activated (or they could just make RBTs instantly activates when placed which would solve most of her problems.)
---
Im sorry lol. The last few were just not that funny. I forgot it's wrong to have an opinion on this sub.
---
Don't get ya hopes up it probably would of been data-mined  as well , I hope we get one tho .
---
Well, the first time I played against him he seemed pretty unstoppable. I've never played as him, but he is LOW on those tierlists so I may have just had a bad team.
---
Am broke :/
---
That's the point of NOED. If NOED wastes time by looking for dulls, Ruin wastes time by making bad survivors look for the ruin. If you complain about NOED, you have to complain about Ruin and Huntress's Lullaby. And don't forget old DS which was a crutch perk.
---
You don't need to 3-4K every match to pip just don't overcommit to chases and mind game with your killers
---
Watching youtubers also really helps
---
I'd like that, we need more characters from zombie movies.
---
"Never down anyone twice, let the last of us go if you get that far, let us pallet stun you (we'll still teabag), and we're going to tell you you suck after all of this."
---
Agreed. Hag's best mori
---
Cause in any other situation where the trapper doesn’t step in his trap, the Claudette is dead.
---
Are we going to be able to buy it with shards though ?
---
Doesn't cleansing a totem activate haunted grounds if it's being used? So not only does NOED slow you down whether it's used or not, but every time you cleanse that first totem you are taking a risk. Time management aside, sometimes it's a conscious decision made not to get a totem.
---
Obviously when we say "M1 Killers" we mean it literally.
---
That lunge
---
YES!! I hate when people kill themselves or dc on hook if it’s a camper. Just sit there and buy time for your teammates
---
Thanks :)
---
Spawn as a different legion across the map when the trap is activated
---
Bro don’t let him tier up!
---
Semi-new to the game. If I have the DLC for Adam Francis is it worth it to buy deliverance or should I save the shards and just level him up enough to teach it?
---
Hunter x hunter?
---
I've been playing Killer for most of the day and don't go by my Reddit username so...
---
Idk what the "rule book" is and I main survivor, I feel like Killers just made it up 2 make survivors look worse lol
---
That new Meg cosmetic looks interesting..
---
Ima just sit at this pallet and t bag him instead of breaking his line of sight.
---
Noed is worse for the killers than the survivors because it always holds their hand and prevents them from getting better and stopping gens.
---
no like... its literally impossible to stop people from tunneling  
---
even if people were invincible for 20 seconds after being unhooked regardless of proximity to killers, bad killers would still chase them, you can make it unfavorable to tunnel, but you cannot make it so people don't tunnel
---
The 2 David's should switch lol. Dead Hard is more useful than Detective's Hunch bro
---
Play as two of them, have one idle and flip a knife around, alerts you when a survivor gets within their fov, use power to switch to that member of the Legion who enters feral frenzy.
---
Buff/rework feral frenzy to make it viable to even use beyond getting an easier first hit.
---
Increase vaulting speed to the same as a survivors quick vault.
---
Let the Legion see blood during feral frenzy again. Moonwalking exploit was fixed by tying the terror radius to deep wounds timer so there was no point in that change. Sort of like Freddy Rework teleport but to set members and they don’t wander.
---
Keep missed attacks canceling the power. This punishes Legion players for missing and/or making bad plays.
---
Drastically shorten the Deep Wounds Timer, or shorten it less but remove pausing the timer during mending. Deep Wounds is not threatening in the slightest and barely slows the game for what it does. At this point it basically exists to buff Borrowed Time.
---
Repeated Hits should shorten the time, but not by as much as before the rework.
---
She is b tier so like high mid tier, she is very good at slowing down the game, her ambush can help in chases, and she stealthy
---
They just had a sale a few weeks ago where it was only 9.99 not including any dlc mind you, it might be a month or two before it goes on again
---
It makes her corrupt purge one-shot??!??!
---
If you get hit by four DS in one match . . .
---
Theyre set values. Really you should only be trying this achievement with Judiths + Fragrants Tuft. Its extremely difficult to do it with tombstone since you run out of evil to stalk, which is why those reset values are there
---
It’s not killers or survivors complaining, it’s the whiney little bitches controlling them
---
Pffffffft
---
Some people get off from making others feel bad, they are assholes simple.
---
I once spent a good 10 minutes punishing a hag for running Hex: ruin, which wound up costing her 3 gens. In the end she had to let it be cleansed because keeping the totem was having the opposite effect of helping the survivors.
---
I was playing as a david (not shirtless) and started the match looking for a gen. Found one, tried fixing it, discovered the ruin, and went to go look for it.
---
I found it easily enough, it would have been well hidden tucked away in some hay bales near the barn, if not for the 5 runes the hag had placed near it.
---
I tried to cleanse it, but a rando set off a rune, hag shows up and i scram, setting off the other 4. I manage to escape, and sneak back to see her setting up her 5 runes again. This gives me an idea.
---
She has covered such a large area that crouching to the totem will take to long, running to it? Well that will set off het traps... So that's what I do. All of them, and then i take off. She appears, is imediatly confused, then goes about replacing all 5 runes.
---
She leaves to hunt the other survivors, and imagine her suprise, and frustration when she hears all 5 traps activate once again? That's right, i held her hostage. Eventually, as she replaced her runes again, and again, she watched as generators were being completed without trouble.
---
She was faced with a terrible decision, let the totem be cleansed, and chase survivorsoff the few remaining generators, or keep doingwhat she was doing, and eventually have us all escape. Because she was failing to catch me every time.
---
Eventually she decided to protect her generators, leaving her poor totem unguarded, and i cleansed that thing.
---
I believe from that point she did better, actually got some kills, but I wasn't one of em.
---
I was wondering this exact thing a while back.
---
It's too bad we're only allowed to play as an Ash cosplayer. But the real thing would end up beating the Killer, the Entity, and the Fog itself.
---
Everyone with him would die in the process, however.
---
No, just from what I've heard around, I simply want to find a way to make legion good or at least playable
---
This is impressive, and I love it a lot. OP, you did a REALLY good job on this. Like, REALLY GOOD
---
Yeah facing a fully coordinated team can definitely ruin your stealth plays. For me though I've been able to cut off Survivors due to all the doorways, my only weakness though besides being spotted are windows.
---
Indeed
---
"No its the Killer who is Lagswitching"
---
I wish we could see that on ps4
---
Surveillance is a far more consistently valuable perk.
---
Bamboozle isn't that powerful unless you are a killer that is significantly weak to window loops.
---
Legion is playable and not nearly as weak as you seem to think. Killers like Wraith or Leatherface are way worse
---
Wait, but you're actually right in the second panel.
---
You used to hear it around the edges of the map too, but I think they patched that out.
---
yeah maybe I gotta give it another go. I had a grab animation canceled off a gen for the m1 hit. shit sucks
---
Hilarious, but why is Trapper the only Killer allowed to completely screw himself over, again?
---
That's good, I should've mentioned it's been a while since I caught up with the news but I got interested again recently
---
To be fair the prophecy only mentioned Ash not Ash and crew.
---
Plus sorry if I sound like a dick in any way I dont mean to at all, just wanting to have a friendly discussion
---
Oh please, that's all of the time. At least for me.
---
nah, its okay. He is still considered weak by the public opinion, but he actually is in a pretty decend spot right now
---
honestly it was very low. last look was like 44k likes 800 dislikes
---
the man was preaching. a saint of our time
---
sure, no worries :)
---
Julie and frank are my favorite killers. There are times when I go 4-6 games in a row with rank 7-12’s where it’s my choice to let the last go or hook them. If the right perks are put on for your play style, Legion is lethal.
---
This is the week to play Hag. Rank reset pairs decent Survivors with the foreheads that will yeet into the traps.
---
That's good cause I think legion is pretty cool and was sad they didnt do so well at first. Thinking once my xbox is out of storage I'll buy legion, ghostface and spirit
---
Honestly, that'd make the game way more fun. I'd buy Leatherface if it meant I got to put Survivors in the Thunderdome.
---
Fair
---
Domo arigato
---
2 Freddy Perks, 2 General perks and a mori.
---
Could either be a deranked Player or someone who finally played Killer, after being a Survivor Main.
---
Or just a newb who got somewhat Lucky in his Blood web
---
&gt;Yeah, I do agree with you that the most fun way to play the game for me, is not to play optimally. But that is simply how I enjoy the game.
---
we're two on that front
---
&gt;What is fun in this game is subjective after all. And I know a ton agree that that mentality should be ruling, but I don't.
---
what mentality are you talking about? i got confused here, the mentality that you play however you want or the "do what i say or get hated at" mentality
---
and yeah, its sad that the community is this toxic and two sided but its bound to come with this kind of gameplay that the game offers but what we can do right now is to just play how we want, thats the only way to express our opinions (of course not counting going into this subreddit)
---
Do you play xbox, ps4 or PC?
---
My fav thing players do is claim you did something even if u didnt do it like tunneling, Rape post game chat with ree'ing, comment -rep on my steam profile for breaking their rules and then reeing in my twitch chat. Best community i've ever seen.
---
It’s because ppl seem to think it is a latency problem when it’s not half the time
---
Yes I got him using shards and I love playing as him
---
Ironically, Franklin held onto that flashlight as a corpse. For years, if you consider 2 canon.
---
ye I loved Legion as well and Spirit and Ghostface are definitley fun
---
If I was BHVR, i'd laugh. Then i'd closely follow the game and learn how to blance my own
---
PC
---
Baby dweet
---
It's in the top posts of all time as an April fools suggestion.
---
Dang it
---
Oh you poor thing.
---
Soon you will understand that you are not sorry for a "wasted" Mori
---
It’s free Real estate
---
Lemme guess, they hide in lockers?
---
The difference between Ruin/HL and NOED is that you know the killer have Ruin so you can look for the totem. Or you can stick to the gen and try to do great skill checks. Either way it's the perk itself that buys you time. With NOED you don't know if they have it so you are risking your time by cleansing all the totems. And DS got nerfed so I don't know why the old one is relevant.
---
Yeah, the other meg cosplay had her being dirty, and the clothes were perfectly matched with the default
---
Omg I forgot to buy breakdown last week.
---
Those damn lanterns sound EXACTLY like ghost face sneaking up on you
---
He is decent
---
Billy squad!!!!
---
She’s Nice
---
Jake main. Accurate
---
That's good, I guess I need to keep up with the community more
---
The reason I say it's so good on lery's is that map seems to have more lockers than any other locker in the game. Survivors use lockers a lot more than you might think, though.
---
I´d agree mostly.
---
Bond is really great but depending on what your goal is in the game it CAN be switched with something else.
---
Plus what is sloppy/thano?
---
I like myers and spirit but I’m not realy a fan off ghostface
---
It's the "you must play the game the way I want it and if you dont you are basically satan and deserve anything bad that happens to you!!!" Which stems from the belief that only ones own personal idea of how the game should be played matters and anything else doesn't. My mindset is that only the way the game functions matter, any and all playstyles that aren't cheating or exploiting are fine. Can't give people hate for how they play if I find them all valid. That being said, I hope the game does get patched and changed to the point where it weeds out the less savory kinds for many the majority of players. Because I do have a favorite way to play. Winning isn't what makes a game fun to me. To me being stomped or stomping isnt fun. To me equal skill is fun. Games that come down to the wire are fun. And I also enjoy creativity, love making all kinds of perk builds and just focus on that strength. Playing meta has never been my thing. The strongest killers aren't fun to me and the strongest perks aren't fun either. But that is my personal playstyle. But, giving fellow players hate for simply playing the game is just dumb to me. Fine to complain about how the game generally plays out and voicing opinions on how things should be changed to make the game more fun, I can just do without all the hate that comes with this game.
---
I was playing to try it out when i didn't have a pc but the button eyes creeped me out more than dbd's gore, reminds me of Caroline, i'll wait and see how the mobile version will turn out, right now Michael Myers isn't in the mobile version, he is pretty much the biggest reason why i play this game, no offical halloween games so this will do.
---
Hilbilly is amazing
---
its good but totems are kind of useless once you pass the newbie ranks and with them buffing points for killing totems they are going to be even more useless soon.
---
I remember being at that awkward age where I thought I was edgy and my hair constantly looked like shit.... *shudder*.
---
Really? I hardly use them when I play survivor. I'll need to check lockers some more
---
I really hope so. The anniversary event was just too bland. It was nothing to excited, events are supposed to have fun activities and exclusive cosmetics, etc 
---
I want them to do another event like how Hallowed Blight was. A lot of people didn’t like it because everybody forgot to do gens so Killers got insta free pressure because of it, but I liked it.
---
The combination of Sloppy Butcher and Thanatophobia.
---
Since you can easily get 4 stacks of Thano people will either heal incredibly long and quickly get injured again.
---
Or gens are actually really slow and they are a 1 hit
---
Get headphones? 😂
---
I've never tried it myself, but I imagine huntress lullaby has to be great with him. No sound + skill checks popping up randomly on your screen when healing sounds amazing
---
I'm new, I just got the flashing and ducking at the gate (cuz I suck), I just pretended that it was a sweet impromptu disco party to celebrate me. Getting upset just let's them win both emotionally as well as gamingly.
---
I would like huntress if I could play her but she is to hard for me and legion is decent but not great
---
A lot of survivors waste time looking for Ruin. Does that mean it should be nerfed? Nope. Like someone else just told me, it could still waste time looking for known hexes because a killer might have HG or Thrill, meaning you have to go look for 3 hexes to find Ruin
---
If you already have Adam you should level him and get bamboozle, plus it's a really good perk for  killers in general (except nurse or spirit)
---
That is funny as Hell. I love how he gets his face in the camera and says nope.
---
That sounds OP
---
I say “gg ez” when i have a really bad game.
---
If they have haunted grounds then the totem is active and cant become Noed, so if the killer has noed and haunted grounds only cleanse the dull totems. This actually helps the survivors if they realize the killer is running HG becuase they only have 3 dull totems to cleanse
---
Thrilling Tremors and I'm all ears are pretty good. Sloppy Butcher, Whispers, Deerstalker, and NOED can all be really useful in certain situations.
---
Sounds like you were in a game with my noob bf playing on my account at ranks too high for him
---
Distressing, Lullaby, overwhelming presence and Unnerving Presence.
---
Also known as the Hostage Doc as he can easily keep the game hostage on smaller maps.
---
On the Game he can slow the game down to a snails pace
---
I think her add-ons should be reworked
---
Can you open the hatch with a purple or iridescent key that you have previously used via add ons (survivor /killer aura reading)?
---
What vid
---
That miner plague would make me play plague and the blood dress looks phenomenal
---
Never feel bad for a killer who brings in a Mori
---
Would this be the same on PS4 as with PC? I play on PS4 and notice things like this when I'm killer and survivor. I know things like this happen, but when a person is saying the killer is lagswitching almost every game, I suspect there is another issue at hand.
---
Haha wtf
---
I'm on PS4 but watch PainReliver on Yt
---
They're on the PTB right now and work incredibly well so probably.
---
I forgot which one it is
---
Basically none
---
Makes her 100x creepier imo
---
My main three are Myers, legion, and ghost face. I already know legion is good at windows, not sure about the others
---
Think about it! How many good killers do you see run noed? It’s a good perk for really new players to get the hang of the game, but noed is just something to lean on for older players who should know what they’re doing.
---
certain builds it can make sense I guess... But i don't like using noed.. and its annoying when a killer gets one hook all game, then wins with noed
---
The mori reminds me of centurion from for honor
---
Sneaking through the corn fields to grab survivors off the gens is my favourite hobby.
---
[deleted]
---
No problem
---
They used the picture of the Trapper
---
Exactly.
---
should he just be able to step on a beartrap no problem like some sort of super power? It sounds fair to me, you choose where to place them down you should be able to not step in it
---
And if they're good enough, they'll call it and hold their swing until you finish the 360.
---
I had a game where 3 DCd when I had someone down, and only the Dwight was left.
---
I Fucking murdered his ass, because he was the leader of a swf group that was farming this Baby Dwight meta.

---
I feel bad for any TF2 traders that try to play this game. You know, the one set of people that -rep can have an effect on with some trading sites.
---
I was going to attempt photoshopping this but decided not to 😭😂
---
If a survivor who's sitting right in front of me just blatantly throws a pebble, I have to go check it out of principle.
---
Give Nea the right hair and clothing and she could pass as a Zoey.
---
Having all survivors do one totem each and the last one do two is definitely not that much time at all. If it's really taking you that long, you're doing something wrong. And not knowing how many dull totems are left is part of the solo survivor experience.
---
How and why? The information isnt exactly game breaking throughout the game, plus unless they run ooo, the obsession will know if the killer has rancor and can try to plan around it accordingly. 
---
On top of that, a one person mori isnt even that strong. Me and my friends literally joke and call the perk pity kill because you only get the mori if you failed it kill the obsession and got to end game. 
---
I fail to see how it's that strong, but am really curious as to HOW you think it should be nerfed.
---
You're cherry-picking a situation out of your ass to try and uphold your argument. I'm not falling for it.
---
If survivors don't want to get hit with NOED, they need to put forth the effort to avoid it. Not just do nothing, slam out gens, and then expect to not face the potential of being smacked with the punishment of NOED.
---
I keep getting Leatherface and Hillbilly. The one hit wonders that result in triple downs while I watch on from a distance is almost sickening at this point.
---
Do dull totems, Camp Exits, DC, Run Hope, delete the game, etc.
---
This will be overlooked but I hope there’s a real conversation here.
---
Aren’t there some skins for a less modern look?
---
It's build niche. The only teachables I'd call "ASAP" are Adrenaline (only endgame perk powerful enough for its uncertainty of use to pay off, heal is big), Iron Will (completely removes one of the downsides of being injured), and either Balanced Landing or Lithe (BL if you prefer control, Lithe if you prefer reliable). The rest are best just grinded for if you have the character. 
---
~~Also Spine Chill has been getting a lot of attention recently for good reason. Get that from your bloodweb asap, best non-teachable perk~~
---
I’m gonna get mega downvoted for this but on an ebony mori I think you should have to get 2 hooks before being able to mori someone. Ergo remove the camping tunneling mindset
---
"I did naht kill her is bull shit, I did naht. Oh I Michael!"
---
Alternatively: Play dumb and let them spend more energy raging at you
---
The devs want the survivors to be people we can relate to, people we wouldn't bat an eyelash at if they were behind us in the grocery store checkout line or something. The killers are meant to be the magical/supernatural/time-displaced ones.
---
I have a few questions:
---
- how long does it take for a hook to be able again after  sabotaged?
---
- what does the Blindness status do?
---
- what does the Broken status do?
---
- what does the Mangled status do?
---
- and this is the biggest question that I have, how in the hell the Luck works?!?
---
What killer did you pick anyway?
---
If I understand correctly, it's a desyncing issue where the game/host thinks that you're in a different spot from where you are. It used to be a problem on Rancid Abbatoir and Pale Rose, both which were fixed recently. 
---
Glad to know about this now, definitely will want to avoid that building in the future.
---
Same would be cool as being able to kill them instead of last hook them. Just feels shit using it as killer and against as survivor. Never get many points with it
---
Was doing my billy challenge. Seriously wasn’t even playing toxic, I’m a terrible killer tbh. Survivor main all the way
---
That was literally me when BBQ came in. I had unlocked it the day I bought LF, and next day, BBQ was in Shrine.
---
Cool. I appreciate the response and information!
---
Any week is a week to play Hag. She’s just pretty boring to play thats why not many play her.
---
When’s this supposed to be?
---
Survivor bad haha give upvotes
---
Its ok, you also have Pebble now
---
Now that you mention it, it does sound exactly like his straps flapping around. I never thought about that before since he's still so new to the game.
---
Leatherface's basement is pretty much like area 51, so, we could potentially use it for practice.
---
Freddy rework PTB for PC starts very soon, I'm pretty sure! You can find a lot of information on the sub about it.
---
The pain lol
---
Nailed that spelling man!

Because the community is great

---
a true hero of justice
---
Switch Lithe for Dead Hard and I’d agree 100% with this.
---
If the totem isin't lit it doesn't have a hex. Have you played the game? If the killer has haunted grounds they'll have 2+ lit totems. you're being told to do dull ones so that a dull doesn't turn into noed. Also, it takes like 10 seconds from each survivor to counter noed. And when you're looking for ruin you probably run by like 4 totems repeatedly.
---
Best is subjective, honestly, but I usually do Balanced Landing for an Exhaustion perk because it's useful even when you're still Exhausted; Alert and Bond to replicate some of the situational awareness of SWF, which goes a long way to escaping; and Adrenaline, because it allows me to pressure the last gen instead of running around looking for a heal if I'm on death hook.
---
Alert and Bond can be swapped for other perks that fit your preferences. Altruistic might mean swapping in We'll Make It to try to keep teammates alive (highly correlated with escape) and pairs well with Aftercare. You could focus gens (also strongly correlated with escape) and run Leader or Prove Thyself with Bond. Or if you are good at chase, a more aggressive build with Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, or maybe even Object of Obsession would give you the chance to keep the Killer busy so the others can focus gens.
---
Tldr: Balanced Landing, Alert, Bond, Adrenaline, but it depends.
---
Wake Up has appeared three times already.....come on Quentin give us Pharmacy already :(
---
Been up for a week. Goes live next week
---
One more time for the people in the back?
---
/s
---
Having each survivor do one and one do two is the most ideal scenario. In solo you have no idea what your teammates are doing so it's a bit unrealistic. Things like this ruin the solo survivor experience for me and are the reason I exclusively play SWF now
---
Some killers think using a flashlight at all is toxic and will camo you on first hook
---
I need that Lisa skin!!!
---
I thought haunted grounds was triggered after a totem was cleansed, no? Maybe I'm out to lunch here.
---
A gladiator would be different and the Plague shows that the whole 'time' thing doesn't really matter to it so more ancient killers would be cool.
---
Its fun and can be clutch but its also extremely unreliable. Anti synergy with adrenaline because you have the Broken status effect (no mither) after unhooking yourself. If you dont go for hooks you probably wont be able to proc it.
---
Thanks!
---
It all depends on the killer if it were a toxic one that camped them out then yes, and if you cant get to them before the timer goes out then also yes.
---
thanks for being toxic and grant me those -4 for each comment.
---
As you clearly see in the video Feng played zero mind games, she throw the pallet where she clearly didn’t have to, wasted a good pallet. 
---
Second she ran straight into a hooked Claudette a team mate could be heading there to save Claudette, getting the whole team in dangerous situation is not wise strategy.
---
Third, she saved Claudette to make the killer tunnel Claudette instead of chasing Feng. So, she can escape safely, and that is a big NO NO . unfortunately for trapper he got trapped in his own trap. 
---
Now kindly grant me another -4 for clarifying why Feng is stupid, and proofing to you what I have said in the first comment. 
---
You got give those down votes to keep the ball rollen  ;)
---
Same dumb circlejerk, different day.
---
Some people apparently can't comprehend that killers can do things that annoy survivors and vice versa. Apparently flipping each other a little shit after a match is the worst thing ever now.
---
The difference is you are running Ruin as a perk therefore it buys you time. Something with any Hex. NOED buys you time whether you have it or not because survivors don't know. Sorry if this is confusing. I'm not complaining that it buys Killer time because then I would complain about Ruin. I am complaining that it buys the killer time regardless of whether they run it or not.
---
It has been a long time since I played For Honor, plus I'm a Viking main, so maybe I see the execution and it stuck with me.
---
Thank you! I will admit balancing isn't really my forte, so that's why I rely on feedback from others on. Still, I'm really happy that you like the idea!
---
Looks like a noob3 vid but I’m unsure
---
What do you mean blinding at a pallet to buy more time?  Because tha5s one of the only uses for it buddy.
---
No problem! Always here to help, so you can DM me any questions and I'll be happy to answer (Cause my dumb autism brain makes my dopamine go ham upon helping people with questions)
---
Mom said it’s my turn to repost this meme.
---
Maybe if you're really, really good at aiming.
---
Yeah but that's my point, if the Entity Realm is outside the concept of time, there should be a Conquistador vaulting over windows and stuff. But yeah I guess your doylist point makes a lot of sense with them wanting to make the survivors more relatable.
---
 My most common perk is OoO and I spend most of games getting chased. I dont remember being chased as not fun. I play fairly but using SB exploit is literally game breaking. Its a 3 second dead hard you can use while healthy. Is that not op?
---
Just try to ignore it. I had a stretch where virtually every match I would get shitty messages for a bout a week. Now I haven’t gotten any. It’s mainly just players that can’t handle losing.
---
I’m talking about ochido lover on top
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/ebolaworld
---
it can be a fun perk to run, but if youre the first one hooked then it becomes useless, but it makes the moments when you do have deliverance active and make a clutch play makes it worth it.
---
Its the name of the series, stop bullying me
---
There's a bug (or was, honestly not too sure if they fixed it or not) where you could run around and save your Sprint Burst without being exhausted.
---
It could happen? People who exploited the legion blades BEFORE the devs acknowledged it publicly were banned.
---
Its a name from a series, they were swf, flicky flickys and i feel like they tried to bully me
---
Run NOED nurse with insidious and hide behind the exit gate.
---
She is perfect how she is. No rework needed.
---
This is generally what I run when I'm actually trying and not just goofing off.
---
Anti-tunnel.
---
Instaheal at endgame with speed boost that ignores exhaustion. 
---
Exhaustion perk to prolong chases. 
---
Plus whatever else you want. I generally use We'll Make It to help the squad but I'll slap Unbreakable on there to deal with sluglords or just really whatever else. Plenty of flexibility.
---
I love tenacity for these reasons even though it’s such a niche perk
---
Probably wouldn’t be in the files until the Freddy patch next week though. Doesn’t necessarily mean one is coming, just that it’s probably too soon to base it off datamined content.
---
That's the bug I'm talking about
---
Their will to live is what got me
---
You're not over how much of a stupid strategy pallet blinding is? I dont blame you. It's a complete waste of a flashlight and only used to taunt.

1: 3 minutes 
---
2: blindless makes it so you cant see the auras of your team mates
---
3: broken status means you cant heal, this effect is only applied with the devid king perk "no mither", plagues sickness and when you use deliverance youll have the broken status effect applied for a limited amount of time
---
4: mangled status effects makes it longer for survivors to heal/heal each other
---
5: luck effects your chances of unhooking yourself and the items found in chests
---
What the fuck? LoL
---

There’s a lot of really good content creators for this game which I love
---
Thanks!!!
---
All 4 should be on the map and you teleport to them at will. Lose feral frenzy. Or at least something to do with being able to use them all. They are a gang after all. I'd use feral frenzy on Chucky. Tiffany carries him around and their power is you become Chucky and can run fast and vault fast. Kinda like legion and Spirit mixed. Tiffany would be normal m1.

" All of those games, or at least most, have systems designed to make you keep spending money. DbD doesn't have that. "   
---
" Now, if you want to talk about the absurdity of a 10 dollar outfit, we can talk about that. However, that might hurt your Fortnite love as well."   
---
This game has outfits/skins just as basically all of those other games do, which is the main thing that the system is designed to get people to spend money on. So yes, it does. Just like the others. Also I could care less about Fortnite it's just an example lol
---
Also yes, you're correct you don't need to spend a dime, but you could say that about most free to play games. Ever beat an MMORPG? By the way, already $20 spent.

I can't talk about the first bit, but do you really think 60 hours per character is okay? That's 720 hours if you want every character that's buyable. Also are you really okay with just playing the same character all the time? Not everyone is. Finally, that last bit. No one liked it when CoD did it, why would they like it here? If they did that I'm fairly certain they'd get quite a bit of backlash and not be nearly as popular as that'd kill the replayability of their game. Lose-lose for them, but what do I know, maybe people would've still loved playing one map for a $20 game.

Basically, even if they increase the shard amount it wouldnt matter and people who played for awhile know that. Shards dont really matter. Also its good thats it not an important thing or the game would be pay to win.
---
Also if one of the three survivors leave then the lobby Will fill out most likely
---
I save them for the morons who wait at the exit teabagging when I'm doing Dailys with killers I rarely use. I just want to have the one guy they've designated as the quitter to rank lower. I know I could destroy them, especially when I already know what perks they're bringing in. It's been 3 times in a matter of an hour and a half.
---
incredibly well???? have you played killer?
---
"I don't want to counter it, so I shouldn't have to" is what you're really saying.
---
Yep, that’s me. That’s me baby.
---
This, i had a game the other day where i was chasing an Adam and he was instantly dropping every single pallet.Then i got flamed for camping him.
---
I was a BBQ, MYC and devour hope hag....i tried to explain, he didn't want to understand.
---
Wait what lol
---
Add Nosferatu as the survivor and I'm in
---
It's the bug where by doing a certain action in game before you run, it cancels sprint burst and you can save it for when needed

Meh Samination's videos are staring to get old.

Maybe the next will parody will tackle toxic killers?

*Spoiler alert* It's not gonna happen. Also someone should tell this guy it's dbd in 2019 not 2017.
---
as obvious as it is I still think theyre in the clear, not using the iconic mask just a body that is probably only minor hexadecimals of different colors. Unfortunate
---
When does DBD mobile come out of beta, or atleast open to more places? Does anyone know?
---
She's also a hard killer to play with a totally different play style to all the others.
---
Whenever the killer DCs I get my item
---
Everyone who upvoted this video, probably you among them.
---
You know No One Escapes Death, the Killer perk? In Twitch Streams, they pronounce it “Know-Ed,” but everyone I know pronounces it “Node” ... Are you friggin’ mocking me?!  Pick a pronunciation, damn it! That shit pisses me off! Bunch of dumbasses!
---
A lot of these perks are meant to make the game more accessible to new players, that's why you unlock them so early in the skill tree. Deja Vu, for example, helps players who don't know the map very well find gens and introduces them to the concept of getting 3 gen'ed. Resiliance helps people without self care and makes hitting skillchecks easy. You aren't necessarily meant to run them forever.
---
The reason for banning the wake up bug is because it legitimately broke how the game played
---
&gt;a killer can see a group of survivors who all look skilled or toxic (legacy, prestige, flashlights, things that look "threatening") and very easily and comfortably put on an ebony or an "op addon" to combat them. Now while it can be debated on whether survivors like that deserve to be hit with builds like that, the point is that a killer can put on one of there many ebony moris and not worry as they know they only need to level up that killer one more time to get another, a concept I find ridiculous.
---
This just seems like a lot of opinion, to be honest.
---
What in the actual fuck? Lol is this a new bug?
---
I have spine chill and it doesn’t seem like I ever get any kind of notification the killer ever looks my way even when he pops up out of no where. Am I just missing the sound?
---
For sure, but to not announce in-game that it would be bankable to use it is scummy. Not everyone uses reddit, and some people may not even know.
---
I like to run like a madman and set off all the traps and try to force a chase if I know a teammate is nearby for the real unhook
---
Though sadly Hag's Very Rare and Ultra Rare add ons aren't very useful
---
The letters look like the fortnite font
---
Garage killer
---
A lot of people run Bamboozle on Myers.
---
ontop of this "Definatly not that much time at all" That LACKS factoring in finding them. Totems are strewn about randomly, in sometimes VERY well hidden places. Finding all 5 can be quite the chore. He is right, NOED is a hell of a cheap shot when it comes to losing, but at the same time, Surviviors SHOULD have a reason to deal with Totems. As someone earlier suggested, perhaps make it a built in mechanic, let survivors know how many totems are left (Not dull, as that gives away hexs) And this allows them to be ready and search for them. However, this still provides the issue of Totems sometimes being STUPIDLY well hidden. Im not sure how they could get around that, but it is an issue. Bottom line, NO ONE likes playing perfect all game, not getting hit at all, opening a gate and BARELY getting hit by the killer, oops NOED, and getting sacrificed. Sure, you still pip. But it robs you of victory and a good chunk of bloodpoints.
---
*STUPID MEG!! YOU MADE ME LOOK BAD*
---
Removed - be civil.
---
I have. Ash hasn't gone up against a reality warping god in it's own realm. Nor has he ever permanently gotten rid of the deadites, which are markedly weaker than the Entity. You're basically saying he'd be able to take on cosmic horror level shit on it's own turf, which he can't. Cute post, but people need to stop underestimating unknowable things because that's how Darkest Dungeon started.
---
Except thats not true at all, because thats just sterotype. I play Wraith and don't run NOED at all. This means that any survivors that waste time cleasing dulls are doing just that. Wasting time towards a completely meaningless objective. there is no way to TELL someone has NOED. Just aussme. which, could be a wrong assumption.
---
Lots of people run bamboozle on Myers and yes I thin it's strong.
---
Perk icon lights up when killer looks in you direction, and if you are performing action at the moment, you will often see changes to progress bar too (additional icons for more frequent and difficult skillchecks and progress speed, progress bar becomes yellow), but that depends a bit on what other progress affecting things are in play.
---
Legion Pin to
---
First I heard of this
---
If someone tries hopping in a locker with a legion, hit or possibly a grab for an ez hook
---
F
---
No its not. You can just buy them. They arent even expensive. Shards might matter to new players, but the game rightfully doesnt cater to them.
---
*"Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer."*
---
Yeah, they do need to start giving rewards at rank reset or something, which a lot of people have been pushing for.  Currently there's not much reason to rank up ~~other than not getting facecamped 10 games straight please fucking kill me~~  
---
  
---
If you choose to go the ftp route it's a pretty grindy game.  I feel like BP is the bigger issue though.  Shards have never limited which characters I play, it's always who I can level, which I guess is why I feel like shards dont matter as much? I feel like we'd get a better reevaluation if the fixed BP gain.  I can see why theyd do it like this for "longevity" butits boderline painful.
---
Also I was under the impression the development team for DbD specifically was relatively small, mb
---
It's ok, I did and stopped using it after few games.
---
This post has been removed for spam. You have submitted 10 memes within the past 24 hours.
---
Key words here are "May". NOED buys you time no matter what killer, no matter what loadout. He's saying thats pretty unfair for surviviors, and I agree. However, they really need to implement something for killers to slow the game down outside of Ruin, because as of right now, literally every build you make on any killer for any map should have Ruin, and its that nesseceity for Ruin that proves Gens are done too quickly. The survivors need some other obkective, and the killers need less perks that reward doing poorly, like NOED, though its really the only one that comes to mind, im sure there are others. The survivors are a team, and thus they should be the weaker side by a decent margine. even with all 4, the killer should still be stronger and in control. Right now, thats not the case.

Stop spamming this videos

Removing your original thread and reposting doesn't fool anyone
---
I’m thinking about getting this game but I want to know if the PS4 servers are active ?
---
I had a game earlier, guy on hook, was just patrolling gens. Unhooked sound, I had the guy who got unhooked running right into me and I guess I wanted to humor their silly rules because I'm tired of the post game toxicity so I went out of my way and chased the Nea who saved the guy on hook. (Nea was also previously injured) so I got her by the shack and she just DC'd when I picked her up.
---
I still got called a camper and tunnel toxic spirit. I guess us killers need to ignore audio cues and sit in the corner of the map until all injured people healed and the gens are popped so they can butt dance at the exit gates.
---
Bill's perks are general perks in the current version of the game. You don't have to unlock them, they're unlocked right off the bat. Shrine of Secrets is only for teachable perks. It wouldn't make sense to put general perks in there.

Bring on the downvotes but this would be like forcing survivors to only be able to use instant heals in a chase, or after landing a pallet stun. Or if BNPs only worked on the final generator. The point of a mori is to remove a survivor faster. Without that power, you'd be better off bringing a hook offering or a pudding. I'd be happier with them gone than changed in this fashion.
---
I know that. My point is if they will stay that way once he launches.
---
Since when was the Entity a "cosmic" horror? Isn't it's main goal just to take over earth? I also don't recall reality warping anywhere and there's also the fact that "God" is a beaten and loose term. I could call myself a god but that doesn't mean I'm a god.
---
In that case, his canon ending would be to just gtfo the Entity's realm by himself or just being present at the point in time it gets defeated...
---
Is the first time i post this video, i never spam them, and what do u mean about deliting my original threath, stop talking shit avout others work, and id u dont like it, ignore it
---
Btw these never got reposted... dumbass
---
Even if BBQ is next week, you will still have almost 14 days to get 2000 shards for it.
---
Figured id hop into his account on here and find evidence of him being a cunt. He dcd on his first hook 2 mins into the match.
---
Also, windows aren't walls. I don't know why survivors expect to be immune to hits directly after vaulting. Vaulting doesn't give you i-frames.
---
It's also that windows are, you know, open spaces that a killer can reach through
---
Ah right, just buy them. That solves everything wrong with the game. Why not just make it where everything except the starting survivor and killer have to be bought?
---
Yeah, but it’s freddy rework. Everyone is playing him so obviously it’s gonna be longer wait time than usual - don’t think that’s a dedicated server issue
---
Resilience and Spine Chill are great because they increase your window and pallet vaulting speed.
---
If you're confident you can get to the endgame with this build the Hope is great as well, especially for 110% killers.
---
I usually run these 3 plus adrenaline when I try this sort of build.
---
Also, its called growing up my yt content, i love doing videos and postimg my videos here works really good, so u will never stop me...
---
Dead hard is the best exhaustion perk if you can manage the timing. I use lithe, dance with me, iron will and self care currently.
---
A lot of Wraiths I get against run NOED and all the Freddys I've played against ran NOED. It's better to waste time cleansing dulls for the possibility the killer has NOED than letting NOED go off because you wanted to get gens done fast
---
Yeah I agree, and honestly I think they could easily fix the Shard and BP issue together if they wanted to.
---
Not on your list but I would combine We're Gonna Live Forever with We'll Make It. I would also make it award tokens for safe hook rescues, full heals, and obviously protection hits. But you would lose tokens for unsafe hook rescues to discourage farming.
---
next time on \[random show\]
---
 Literally post my new video which instead of playing the game, i put hours of effort editing
---
Random guy: stop posting these, stop spamming your videos etc etc etc... pure shit 
---
So yea, most of the community is garbo sadly
---
Oh damn I totally forgot about survivors hopping in those lockers. A hit would actually be great if you tried.
---
That actually gave me another idea for like an iridescent add-on that changes the locker hit into a 5-second window to run into a locker and go to that locker with a grab.
---
Honestly, I don't understand why this isn't a thing, deliverance or not, it would still be better to have.
---
Cool.   Make sure you bring a flashlight to flicker at tall people.  Or old swamp hags.
---
They are like permanent hag traps in lockers
---
I’ve had this exact thought wow
---
That’s not an exploit, it’s the purpose of the item. If you couldn’t use it during an animation it would be almost impossible to blind any killer who’s played more than one game.
---
Better than what games? Also why wouldn't you want to pander to the casuals? Do they not deserve fun? Lol if shards are so useless as you make them sounds I don't get why increasing the gain of them would be so bad.
---
The difference is risk vs reward.  Noed has literally no risk, and rewards you even if you don't run it. For ruining you have to break one totem, lullaby isn't even good, devour hope requires your totem not being found and you snowballing. With Noed the killer can play as poorly as possible, and still get rewarded highly. They could literally never hook someone and be rewarded in the endgame, because survivors are naturally altruistic because the game would be pretty boring otherwise. If you had to earn noed in some way besides failing to defend the objective it would be a lot more fun.
---
Consoles can handle it or if they want to wait for the scarlet and 5 then so be it because those will be able to handle anything
---
Huntress is underrated, it’s so brutal imo
---
Spine chill doesn't increase either of those, unless I'm crazy.
---
Iam currently running Enduring, brutal strength (my diet in tier 3 is mostly pallets but i don't have spirit fury.), Agitation and iam thinking of making bamboozle my 4th.
---
These are the same people who called pre-rework Freddy overpowered because they got destroyed by him once.
---
It all comes with experience. Remembering who is on what sacrifice stage, who has deadhard (and how to waste it 90% of the time), instinct on what the survivors are doing, etc.
---
Still 800 peoples that are "the survivors that throw the "rule book" killers at the end of matches".
---
And no, i don't consider this as a divergent opinion, but the cancer that is plaguing this game since 1 months after release (AKA when toxic Blendettes highjacked the game lul)
---
Probably has better controls than the real thing
---
Same. I want to enjoy this stuff but there are so many hypocrites.
---
TLDR: They don't like losing.
---
They will never admit tho, they know themselves very well how silly and entitled they sound.
---
I tried to insert a mocking tone but the multiple statements threw people off.
---
I like the current system.
---
Change it and you fuck over the current playerbase that has already bought into it for over a year.
---
Soon we are getting new cool things to buy like Rifts too :)
---
Bruh moment
---
Thanks for the book guys! It was a bit difficult but I managed to wipe my ass with it.
---
The short of it is, bug or "trick" or whatever you want to call it, it's still an *exploit*, and using an exploit is called out as bannable in the tos.  Which means they don't really need to call it out specifically before banning.  You know it's not how sprint burst is meant to work.
---
Better than COD or Battlefield.
---
Casuals ruin the game because they dont update with metas or dont play enough to understand or play correctly. 
---
Sure they do, they just shouldnt affect metas or gameplay.
---
Because increasing the shards would either lead to them losing money and thus creating a hogher cost for shard based items or they would make shards strickly for cosmetics and shrine perks. 
---
My stance is always the game doesnt need to increase the amount of anything we get because that only panders to casuals.
---
The trade off is the PC version is totally dead while the PS4 is poppin. I have 200 hours in the PS4 version and only 40 on the PC for this reason.
---
I cant play nurse. Phasing with spirit (still broke) is one thing. But straight up tele-fragging someone is way different.
---
Fair enough. Won’t stop me from getting frustrated when it happens though.
---
Meh flashlight macros are whatever doing it at every pallet though that's kinda toxic
---
uhh uhh repost!!11! 
---
90% of this site is repost, calm down, jesus
---
Or does the Fortnite font look like the connect four letters?
---
Saying NOED is unfair to survivors because it buys the killer time is like saying coordinated SWFs are unfair to killers because a lot of them loop for 4 gens. There's already perks to keep gens from being done as fast or stops gens altogether for a short time under certain circumstances. I never run Ruin in any build  I don't like having to protect the totem if a survivor finds it. It's not a needed perk. I've had plenty of games where I killed all the survivors before the last generator went off,  it's possible to play without Ruin. The survivors don't need another objective. Their main objective isn't generators,  it is to escape (hopefully with all four) alive. Doing totems is part of that objective. It'll prevent the killer from getting an instadown perk. NOED doesn't reward killers for doing poorly. It penalizes survivors for rushing gens instead of making them go slower to cleanse dulls. Both survivors and killers should be in control of the game. A killer without perks or weak perks should find it harder to play against 4 survivors with decent perks.
---
How do you know you have 200 hours?
---
The consequence of Iri head is that you HAVE to use a belt with it. You can't use any charge speed addons so there's a greater chance that the survivor can get into cover before you can fully wind up
---
Only survivor mains are unable to see the corelation between his videos and the state of this game.
---
Done on purpose more often than not, of course.
---
I'm almost there or a bit past there. I feel like I wasted all my time playing this game but I'm not burned out yet
---
They did an engine upgrade like a year and half ago and broke the fuck out of sounds and scratch marks for the better part of an entire year.  Please don't encourage them to do it again.  Just wait for dbd 2.
---
This is going down in history!
---
Amateur!
---
Accurate
---
Yea that's true, I personally thought it was pretty good
---
Should'a ran
---
Last year's anniversary was about the same. :/
---
D I S G U S T I N G
---
Then tunneling shouldn't be considered toxic either, because the survivor gave the opportunity by panic unhooking.
---
Seems like it's on sale or free weekend about every other month
---
I mean this is kind of just a gore tier list. If we are talking about just strictly ranking how cool/how personality filled they are then Nurse and Doctor both deserve to be way higher
---
You can't derank to 20.  He was definitely gone for many months
---
1500 hours is 62.5 days total (thanks calculator) so not really a veteran DBD player. That would be closer to 2000 - 3000 hours
---
since most hags will trap the feet by a hooked survivor, teammates coming in to save their teammate will need to crouch to not set off said traps. flashlights also get rid of the traps as well
---
I swear people never talk about killers being toxic.
---
I like to start my ambushes with 10 bicycle horns.  If I'm mugging people, I carry around one of those dukes of Hazzard Dixie horns.
---
Hey killer can I get an uhhhh 12 piece nugget and uhhh large coke?
---
Im not understanding you RN. The entity is definitely cosmic horror. It's an otherworldly being above our comprehension. She takes survivors and killers both from the real world and alters the map every single time you play a match. That's pretty reality warping to me.
---
the only thing i think is toxic for survivors is teabagging pallets, dcing, and being rude in post game chat, I think most killers would feel the same. Teabagging pallets is not reportable however the other two are against tos and are bannable offenses
---
Leatherface has the best mori in the game, I respect all incorrect opinions but it has to be said
---
Thank you uwu
---
I always knew my mommy was right when she told me I'm special.
---
i believe this is camping. Camping is  valid in almost every situation despite what survs will say. The only time i hate campers is when they face camp people from 1st hook till struggle or death
---
as a killer main, I agree. The only thing toxic in my opinion is teabagging and maybe even flashlight spam to get my attention (sometimes I tunnel and someone wants to take the aggro, that is understandable, but really, they usually complain anyways in the post game chat)
---
So maybe an idea then would be that other killers could take an offering that spawn the mannequins in and then the perks could apply to that offering ?
---
Spine chill does, provided the killer is looking at you.
---
It's worth considering that the amount of info being sent to killer's connection increases greatly when a survivor comes into view vs when wandering the other side of the map.  Back when I had crappy dsl, my connection would look and be fine in lobby and when play started, but it'd bog down and lag the second I spotted a survivor.
---
Blendette as she discovers the ultimate killer, Nea, behind the gen.
---
Imagine if they put wake up in the shrine whenever it was glitched
---
Sometimes it really do be like that
---
I always like it when I get a 4K and the toxic surviver says get rekt noob EZ even though they all died
---
If I get stuck in an inescapable game glitch manner.
---
Or the lag is hands down unbearable but the ping was all green going in.
---
No other reason to DC
---
So what's your recommendation?
---
That's not really reality warping. Atleast not a very powerful form. Like if she truly was all powerful why the hell does she even need the killers? Why not just kill the survivors herself. Why waste time kidnapping murderers n shit when u can just do it.
---
I do, frequently.  Usually with a tissue nearby.
---
Wait so now we're flagging comments because the same message has been posted before?
---
Hope you're talking about console because there is to aim assist on PC
---
He's a well rounded killer that doesn't do any 1 thing exceptionally well.
---
He's not bad, he's not good.
---
A good perk build makes him strong but really it's the player that can make the most of them.
---
People just hate Legion because of the stigma he created before the rework.
---
Yea, I want to finish my looty build
---
"brand new mouse" is probably your first clue.  A lot of problems like this often get traced back to peripheral software (keyboard control software often causes random games to crash on loading).  Try uninstall ING your mouse software and use the generic windows driver and see if that helps.  If you already do it that way, see if the mouse manufacturer has their own software/drivers.  No guarantees, but it's worth checking on.
---
I hate it when my girlfriend picks me up
---
(You can't use GF for ghostface, the abbreviation is already taken by something way more well known.)
---
I have one like that, but with Jason instead.
---
Then, the killer finds her, downs her, and Mori’s her. R.I.P
---
Wait it instantly kills you?
---
As said to another person earlier : 
---
Looks like you felt targeted.
---
I wouldn't want to be associated with the cancer showed on this video either.
---
Maybe it's time to change something about said behaviors.
---
When you want to de-rank (to find more variety of killers) and it's your last hook, you let the killer hooks you for the last time and while the entity is tooking you to heaven you DC. When you face an absolute pro master nurse on PC (I don't DC in those cases but if someone DC that doesn't bother me). And if you are the killer MAY be justifiable every time when all survs are not using any offerings, because survivors don't lose their rank when you do DC as killer, but they lose their offerings
---
Does Borrowed Time affect when you save yourself using Deliverance? I’ve tried looking it up but can’t find it anywhere.
---
Wtf man. Ruthless haha. Getting shit done. 
---
Did any of that feel like it was luck or just have enough practice with her? 
---
Anyway, gg thank you for sharing this slaughterfest.
---
" *...and has yet to mention or acknowledge all the nerfs survivors have received* "
---
Let's not count the fixing of gamebreaking mechanics/perks/bugs like Infinites and old BT/DS as nerfs, it shouldn't have been in the game in the first place, as much as the machinegun build for Killers back then.
---
For the last part, i think it was never meant to be that subtle from the get go tho, but you're free to your opinion, i understand it's not everyone's cup of tea.
---
Decent shrine, definitely picking up deliverance and bamboozle
---
They have already talked about how they are doing this when they go live with dedicated servers.
---
It’s usually right as a put a trap on their face.. when it’s done it’s a trap on a dead body 😂 sometimes when time is running thin I kill the rest bar one and if they still have a trap on their face I take them to the trap door as it’s a save all exit so they can get out. 
---
Why people gotta be so salty.. I mean they DC after the first down. 🤦‍♀️ no faith in your team mates.
---
Camping is okay when the gates are open. Killer doesn't have anything else to defend.
---
Poor Hag must be raging right now
---
course you fucking deleted it, pussy
---
Yeah but imagine if it was Trapper lol
---
I've seen them say the same thing about trapper, wraith, and every other killer in the game.
---
I second this. Total carnage
---
Why? I'm just gonna swat you back down the second you're off the hook.
---
Nah, I'd rather be able to read memes properly than having to decipher that skinny font
---
LETS GO TRIPLE STUN!
---
&gt; I havent in two months and I still keep on expecting it
---
Maybe it depend on the rank ?
---
I noticed that the atmosphere was, in general, way more chill in low ranks. 
---
Maybe because there are more new players there and they still haven't got infected by this community's toxicity.
---
Did they all use D Strike in the match or did you just assumed they had it.
---
I never use DS so if I'm wrong here then I'm wrong but I'm certain you can only use it once, within 60 secs of being unhooked.
---
So...slugging might have been the way to go but I hope you didn't just let them bleed out.
---
SAME.
---
Good concept but SWF would counter HARD
---
Adrenaline is activated because survivors finished the gens so it's like a reward for them
---
Also it exhausts you so it's not too powerful at all
---
NOED is a crutch for the killer to almost guarantee them a kill because they let all the gens get finished
---
That’s been a thing I’ve only seen it when a survivor was lagging
---
When you find yourself pressing the action button to vault but you just stand still for 10 seconds and then you’re suddenly on the ground. I will dc with no remorse
---
I can't see the caption lol
---
Yep, most of his complaints are focused and reproducible issues.
---
If I hear the heartbeat I walk away, and slowly try opening the gate until it does
---
There's no way to escape because of the lights
---
And mettle of man
---
That hook doe
---
The shrine is great and all that but I always feel like killer perks are a waste of shards if I consider purchasing the killer some time anyway. Sure, it's more expensive but it also gets you other powers!?
---
Flashlights slow the game down. They rock. If you get blinded while carrying/picking up then you need to go stand in the corner and LOOK AT THE WALL.... I mean if someones trying to blind you while carrying they're not on a gen.
---
Pallet blinds are useless, whenever I'm killer, I never lose a survivor, and when im a survivor i also continue being chased. Just not worth it when you could put distance between you and the killer.
---
Remove/rework noed fix hitboxes
---
I got a party invite during a game a while back, turns out it was a full SWF group and they send me an invitation just to tell me they were gonna all escape. 
---
They all happen to suck, and are screaming about rules and calling me toxic the whole time, I killed 3 of them with relative ease and pretended to let the last guy crawl to the hatch only to close it in his face and then hook him lmao.
---
Talk shit get hit
---
Ive been flashlight stunned through what i thought would be solid objects (a couple of the trucks on various autowrecker locations) and even walls.
---
It's impossible to see it without going into the files, so wether they model it or not is irrelevant.
---
I only ever use moris on assholes who made my list. If I mori you, you deserved it.
---
Is it because of the achievement? Then I want to know too.
---
All you did was trap, try blinking for an instance
---
You should have mad eit say phat dc 4 games in a row
---
One flag CTF would be kinda neat. 
---
Or a gamemode where you only fix one generator - the kicker being you need to find pieces to fix the gen, like pistons, wrenches, cogs, etc.
---
Ooft. Unlucky.
---
Back from rehab
---
yeh dats not English buckaroo
---
That sucks yeah but to be fair you did post 7 YouTube links in 7 days.
---
Got to space them out man.
---
Yeah and don't forget pallet vacuum. Killers nowadays don't know what is the real struggle.
---
Slugging is where you let all of them bleed out to death on the ground(dying state)
---
It's a bitch move because it makes their death much longer than it needs to be while also giving the killer less BP and I believe it's also harder to pip could be wrong
---
Yeah, once I was watching a DbD vídeo and Jane started moaning. A friend of mine tough that I was watching porno
---
Way to make fun of someone's disability. You're a real piece of shit, dude.
---
He doesn't have a disability
---
not anymore dude, you are spreading misinformation
---
She looks so happy to be cleansing haunting grounds
---
Someone's gonna invalidate this because you "tunneled"
---
Git gud
---
it used to, but since the end game collapse it doesn't
---
Decisive Strike and Borrowed Time are balanced perks and the only people who complain about them camp or tunnel
---
I was looking at the goddamn white circle xD
---
 not anymore dude, you are spreading misinformation
---
They would have to be blind, deaf and Stupid for that to work, and those would be "Senseless" killings.
---
Because it's extremly annoying to get surv taken away from you after  the chase, which is already hard for killer.
---
I'm completly fine with normal flashlights, as they do need some good opening and your fail to do something, but purple flashlights with some upgrades that insta-blind you are bs. Unless they were changed, I only recently came back to DBD and I didn't encounter them yet (they were annoying while I played in the past, 1/2 years ago).
---
Yeah, I was playing the video on my phone and my sister was like "What the hell are you watching?!"
---
I feel like an issue that goes unaddressed alot is that SURVIVORS FUCKING DEPIP IF KILLERS DC NEAR THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME
---
No Im not. I said when it activates, that is true.
---
I wasn't complaining, I just couldn't counter with how the game was going except to get them all knocked before I hooked them

Hmm I'm not sure were just gonna have to wait and see I guess
---
There's no difference. Both are cheats and have the same impact when used.
---
Yeah slugging is when you leave them on the ground to bleed out, reducing them to crawling around...like a slug.
---
Sometimes it's a wise move to leave them on the ground if you see someone straight away but always mind to go back for the one you downed.
---
lmao everyone that down voted mad cause they play like pussies or in swf all day 😂🤣suck me you useless cows

Nope. Was completely stuck floating above me. I recorded it because I've never seen it before and seemed like a rare thing to trap a nurse with a pallet.

Yes, NetEase has bought stock into Behavior.

I think it’s mostly related to the mobile port as NetEase already has experience in that market.

Exactly

AHHH THE LIGHT MODE, MY EYES!
---
This^^ always fill the bar until it reaches the „E“ of „open Escape“. Thats the sweet spot right before the first light turn on.
---
Very true, what I can think of possibly with SWF is potential small buffs to the killer based on the size of the SWF. But even then it would punish any survivors not in the SWF. I think to help the rickety bridge situation that’s going on here is probably to add more game modes. This way there’s more variety and it can keep different groups of people happy. (Ex. Team of killers vs many survivors, one powerful survivor with potentially “lives” to keep going, a game with less gens but the endgame starts immediately, the list can go on and on)
---
I really want a Survivor like this. One that loves the chase. One that has perks based on keeping the killer on you instead of getting away from them. For the super Altruistic players.
---
Im sorry but holy shit I laughed so much on that second trap

---
I have but it was pure luck, if I don’t find the hatch almost instantly I run towards an exit gate and then just hold down the action button and hope for the best, it’s so nerve wrecking but it’s near impossible it’s pure pure luck.
---
lmao
---
It's funny because you're f\*cked.
---
If you want it done faster then normal go for David he had we’re gonna love for ever and with that perk you can get 2x the bloodpoints. Then go for meg for sprintburst. And then go for Claudette or jake jake if you want iron will and Claudette for self care.
---
Omw
---
The "Rules" would be a lot simpler if most survivors didn't feel like they had to rush in to unhook a person the second they get hooked the first time. I feel like half of all "camping" accusations start when survivors obviously hang around the killer while he is hooking someone and then run loops around the hook so the killer is always near the hooked victim.
---
Tunneling is even more abstract, its a game where you are supposed to chase and hit people. Where is the line between doing that right or "wrong"? Most of the time its just whatever opportunity presents itself. If I only know where a freshly unhooked survivor is I am going to go after them.
---
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH FUCK I FELT THAT PAIN
---
Now all you gotta do is blow up a gen and Sprint Burst away 🤣
---
Man, I hate when I try to kill the thief who stole my Rainbow Map and now I need to papercut them to death. So annoying
---
Bruh I swear to god huntress throws cinder blocks
---
It should not be like csgo.... I don’t disconnect but Jesus Christ the game is no where near the seriousness as csgo obviously it’s annoying but no way should players could end up being banned for a week for disconnecting from a dead by daylight game, games are quick, fun and have a rank just for fun it’s not a competitive game, it’s a ranked play list but not a competitive game.
---
I won't be happy till we get a Robert Englund Freddy cosmetic
---
It’s not a strawman argument if you then proceed to argue the exact points he laid out. Do you know what strawmanning even is or is it just another buzzword from your favourite streamer p3pegaOver1ord
---
Myers can look at you for 5 seconds and INSTANTLY KILL YOU WITHOUT GETTING A SPEED PENALTY. BALANCED, YOU SAY?
---
One person got close to it last match, but I was just able to catch them in the act and pull them off as they got close to opening it. First time playing in months and I just found out you can kick the hatch closed.
---
This sub has reached its peak
---
I solo queue a lot as survivor should I get deliverance
---
I love the way you look around.
---
“I hope no one else saw that...”
---
You mean wake up? Also Thanatophobia was bugged in a similar way for killers during that period.
---
Groovy
---
You should be happy they chose to forgo putting getting extra distance just to blind you.
---
Also, the comment was about stuns, which happens when you get blinded carrying a survivor.
---
“Trust no one. *Not even yourself*.”
---
Perfectly balanced as all thing should be.
---
Doctor absolutely does give himself hallucinations. it even says so right in the add-ons/power/whatever "Doctor shares patient's hallucinations, allowing him to see whatever the fuck patient is hallucinating, highlighting it with an aura"
---
Mint rag? It's not too good but it helps in stand-off situations when the gens are 3 lightyears apart and they keep sneak repairing that 1 gen.
---
Wouldn't mind putting her on the hook
---
2 people alive and killer slugs me to get that p3 urban evasion claudette for the 4k. Had killers msg me and say „I wanted to give you hatch“ but honestly I dont care. Just dont want to lay on the ground for 5min, unable to do anything.
---
Yea that one, also isn't Thanatophobia a killer perk how did it backfire?
---
I'm an adult who can handle mean words in a video game from people who dont know you and never will. If you really cant handle it close the chat.
---
I've always heard about people suggesting this. Would there be any certain special parameters? Like, how many gens, can both killers play the same one, or once one is chosen, they're locked for the other, more exit gates, etc.
---
yep, pre rework legion ignored game mechanics and was changed... still waiting on nurse's rework...
---
Everytime ghost face wipes blood off his knife I nut, whoever made that decision is clearly a fan of the series and deserves a promotion.
---
The mori is what I just said but doubled
---
So your actions were slowed as the killer? That would suck.
---
True has helped me stop whiffing so many hits, especially at windows, but he’s pretty cringe sometimes

Removed - Offtopic

Mori=skill

next animation should be billy shedding the book as the survivors are telling him the rules he **must** follow, then chasing the others as they complain or scream
---
*gamer
---
Removed - Uncivil behaviour
---
Remove all infinites/loops. Make all killers 108% fast
---
Lol no problem. Most perks have specifics like that in their description, if your curious about anything in the future
---
Maybe it's my near 2k hours or just the fact that all the perks in the game have been cut down and nerfed but I really dont get mad over SWF anymore. Flashlight saves are easy to dodge/bait, hook dives are easily punishable, EGC forces out survivors quick enough. Also so many survivors in this game are just not good so I actually enjoy the challenge of a semi coordinated group.
---
Ignoring your slight NOED rant, most killers watch the last survivor on hook in case they do manage to kobe. Very few killers would suddenly run to the other side of the map unless it's very low low ranks.
---
I can see that the gates are powered at the very last frame, oh boy once I trapped myself while carrying a survivor on front of the exits
---
Ok.
---
You're about to get tombstoned.
---
no way. Deliverance and bamboozle been 2 perks I wanted in such a long time now. And they are on the same fucking shrine??? :D
---
Wake Up baby. Learn it, Run it, Profit from it. Wake Up became a top tier perk after EGC. Survivors are to afraid to take off their training wheels meta perks and try it.
---
"trick". 
---
It's an exploit but not bannable, though expect literally every single killer to (rightfully so) ruin your game if you abuse it.
---
Kobe -&gt; get downed again -&gt; Get left on ground for EGC to kill you
---
I have learned to deal with postgame rude chat on PS4, but it annoys me when they invite me to a party afterwards. Like, presumably to voice chat shit to me. I've never accepted but that's pretty horrible. If I screwed up a game and got 0k as Freddy why bully me?
---
What would Borrowed Time do for you in your situation?
---
Yeah, the moment i know it's a SWF i'm bringing a damn ebony
---
it'd be great if you could transfer progress from console to PC, but pretty much transitioning is as unfavorable as possible, quite sad considering how fucking disgusting the console port feels to play.
---
But how are they going to do that though? It's not like they can just magically remove them
---
Eh, it's not just that. I play both 50/50 but some of the stuff you hear from survivors is mind blowing. Like sending a Clown hate mail for using bottles to slow them down. Or calling a killer a "pussy" for baiting Dead Hard. Those are some of the many Greatest Hits from this sub. Me and every other killer have ridiculous stories of our own. We upvote because a thread like this makes us remember and chuckle at the absurdity. There really is a survivor rule book and it's ridiculous.
---
The survivor is supposed to someone the player could imagine out in the real world, the killers are something the player could imagine in a horror movie or something.
---
Yeah, more people seem to play killer than survivor so you get longer queues.
---
Spirit isnt using prayer beads?
---
As a killer main this sucks lol
---
She also looks 15
---
Not bannable because ots BHVR and theyll just wait and fix it. But 99.99% of killers are going to make your life hell if you do it
---
Yeah, i never said it was useless, but he still gives himself hallucinations.
---
- Remove ruin
---
- Triplicate the time to do a gen
---
- Natural kindred for every survivor
---
- Remove nurse
---
- Balance every killer for high ranks that isn’t spirit and hillbilly
---
- Remove swamp and shelter woods
---
- Give a reason to killers to not camp, for example a slow gen penalty for every different hooked survivor
---
- Dedicated servers
---
if you flashlight a trap for a few seconds itll destroy it, it does notify the hag though
---
The entity could easily kill all the survivors, hell, the entity does so in the EGC! The entity does not want dead survivors; it wants emotions. The entity feeds off of the suffering and misery of others.
---
This^
---
And when you find a match, it's a toxic swf that tbags at every pallet.
---
First rule is no killing
---
do totems
---
The two Fengs moaning together made me not be gay anymore.
---
you get killed on the ground with a special perk instead of dying on the hook. Im pretty sure thats what it is but im still relatively new to the game
---
Boring? No way!
---
Welcome to any PvP game, ever
---
Specifically it feeds on hope, that's why it gives survivors a chance to escape.
---
I extremely hope so
---
If it's been activated, you can't leave through the exit gates while it's still on. It activates after a gen is finished, hence putting one on a survivor during the endgame does nothing.
---
No, they changed it
---
And you know this how?
---
Wrong
---
Because I'm not at the window anymore and you lunged from 3 meters away.
---
Yep. Thankfully survivors will be getting a hefty BP boost soon which means less crowded killer queues!
---
Lol, do you watch me play? I don’t think so. I play 60/40, the only reason I play survivor more is to play with my closest friends. I’m just sick and tired of this subs mentality of “Survivors are toxic assholes and killers are perfect in every way”. I’ve gotten to a point where I actually think this is a killer main only sub.
---
I'm gonna do what's called a pro-gamer move
---
Getting 2 kills while doing nothing is stupid you can't change my mind.
---
YES! DELIVERANCE!
---
If they did totems there wouldn't be noed for them to bitch about.
---
Survivor mains should prioritize deliverance. Killer mains should prioritize bamboozle. If you play both sides then bamboozle is better than deliverance.
---
You have no idea how many times doing 2-3 totems worth nothing. And you can't expect all survivors to check all spawns. Do you even solo queue? Totem counter when?
---
No, the killer had random abilites that they did not get to choose and flight was one of them.
---
Baby Killer vs Meg Thomas
---
Nice
---
You can derank to 15 just before rank reset, then rank reset will put you to rank 17, and then you can derank all the way down to 20.
---
&gt;just wait an entire minute lol
---
Someone put this on the mask
---
Can be argued.
---
Sure they can
---
This community is shite either way, I got called a pussy by a rank one hag for using small game and unbreakable. But I just don’t like this annoying ass them vs us mentality. I feel like if one thing will be this games downfall it’ll be how divided this community is.
---
Its either that or they get free, or you dribble.
---
I would justify it by saying that even if the player has forgotten where the trap is, the Trapper himself has not. He steps over the trap or avoids triggering the plate in some way even if his controller who is puppeteering him is a dumbass.
---
My survivor rule book for killers contain one page that say " Dont camp " my survivor rule book for survivors is much bigger though.
---
Smiling Claudette Smiling Claudette Smiling Claudette

\*Throws pebble near OP to distract him from his problems\*
---
I think the post is supposed to be a joke
---
I was watching my friend play dead by daylight and it was the first time I ever saw that game and he was sitting behind a rock and we saw another survivor get mori'd from the distence. It was huntress. I was ... Fecking terrified
---
He actually looks alright now
---
Why though. It isn't a bug that 'breaks' the game play or the flow of a match, if you have sprint burst you will use it anyway,  why shouldn't you be able to use it like dead hard
---
This could be the case on that second occasion as I was blinding during pickup animation, but in first one they were already walking with survivor for quite some time.
---
Ah, so this is where everything on Sheltered Woods went...
---
Bill is traveling back to the left for dead universe
---
No reply needed, just wanted to say I hate Doctors with a passion, and Legion sucks to play against, only playing Him is SEMI-fun.
---
Chuckels 
---
I'm In danger
---
all i can do is upvote. This would be awesome to have them as surv's or killers... or both. I can see it now... Dale activates his power 'accidental death'
---
I mean, she’s able to drink so I think I’m okay
---
hey, you play your way and give mercy your way, And i'll continue to play it my way.
---
It’s working though
---
I’m assuming you’re talking about Billy’s hitbox and not him in general.
---
I get your pain and it does suck, but we all need to realize deep down it’s just a game. You shouldn’t force someone to keep playing if they are not having fun anymore. I never dc but there is times where my team mates are pricks or the killer is being toxic I just rather leave. Losing pips and points is ganas as it is. If someone gave me a cool down time for dc, that would probably be the last time I invest any money in that game or even my time tbh
---
Welcome to prime time bitch
---
Yeah I meant to duplicate the time not triplicate lol, I changed it
---
Give solo survivors more options to communicate and make Kindred baseline. Shrink some of the huge maps, remove the most bullshit building+window combinations still in the game, rebalance the numbers of safe and unsafe pallets on every map. Add a hill to Shelter Woods. Make kicked gen regression a little bit faster. Reduce or remove Bloodlust after rebalancing maps. Rework the most unbalanced stuff like ebonies, styptics, prayer beads bracelet. Change rank reset so it bumps you down a few levels instead of throwing everyone together. Make ultra rare items appear less frequently in the bloodweb for both sides. Rework particularly bad or good add ons like for Leatherface and Nurse. Give a small tweak to NOED so it remains mostly the same but you can’t just camp and then get easy downs once the gates get powered. Buff numbers of weaker killers (like increase Doc’s base shock range). Buff numbers of weak perks on both sides.
---
It’s got them smol arms but tbh it looks better than anything I can draw so.. good work!
---
Oh yeah it's almost impossible to get a stun whilst they're carrying the survivor
---
It's a joke, everyone knows that Autodidact is garbage and doesn't even synergise well with any other medic perks or items, even if you were trying to make a meme build.
---
I played a match as piggy I was able to kill to survivors easily so i let the other two escape for some reason one of the survivors that escaped was mad at me even though I let them gather blood points by fixing gens and braking the totems the other survivor was cool though
---
On a serious note, please don't do this, people. I really dislike 'friendly killers,' farming games, etc. I can't be the only one who is playing for the PVP aspect.
---
I had fun either way :)
---
So you making an easily avoidable mistake is the game saying fuck you?
---
I'm a killer main and i love how Default Jakes always drop a pallet when i'm 15 meters away and stunned
---
I wish they get banned
---
All the old killers had some sort of "weakness" that you don't see after hag. (Assuming Myers weakness is being T1)
---
When is the last time Pharmacy was in the Shrine?
---
Yesterday i just yeet'd a hatchet in The Game knowing i'd miss and i hit the meg from literally a 2 pixel gap between the walls
---
So in other words.. there is no other reason than being toxic?
---
Ohhh, so there only this short window at some point when they are picking up a survivor? Sounds like this needs to be practiced in kill your friends to find exact moment.
---
Sure, but it's ok to have a laugh. Nothing we can do about people who take the game too seriously and treat one side or the other as their sworn enemy.
---
Sorry but bugs fuck over both sides. Survivor and Killer Mains agree and wish there was a game health patch or something. Also hit boxes have been getting worse aith every update. Hits that should connect don't and hits that shouldn't bit do.
---
Also BT was the only true counter to camping, Something you know survivors have been complaining about since day one but hey "It's pArT oF tHe gAmE" so who cares?
---
Also with pallets being reduced,bloodlust and vaults being blocked infinites(as shitty as it might be) is a viable strategy but yet its considered toxic when camping isn't.
---
Well he looks much better like if he slept this week
---
I cannot believe that people dont understand its an intentional way to make noise to get the killers attention. When you are tunneling a guy and wont fuck off, I want you to chase me to give him a chance to live
---
That’s actually good and fun although Swf would hard counter it but still fun
---
Yeah you need to start when they go from the knee to the shoulder kinda I think there are a few tutorials on YouTube
---
P3 Claudettes have a soul?
---
Omg my bf done that when he first played
---
Honestly that’s why I won’t play trapper, I know I’d step in my traps everytime I start doing well 🙈😂
---
I mean, it's nice to pull stuff like that off. Sadly it won't be rewarded with a lot of Points. 
---
Also nearly any Chaser Emblem Points and depending on the Killer the Deviousness is also lacking.
---
Most of the time you dont see them doing jack shit tho. Thats like 1 of a million. Most of the time they are either finding ruin, working seperate gens etc
---
Yes I get that when killer is tunneling. It doesn't how ever apply when killer is chasing you to click the flashlight other than BMing. But when killer is tunneling that just a good tactic to avoid your friend to get hooked and at least I would do it. I maybe wasn't clear enough that I was thinking flashlight clicking while being chased. Then there is no benefit to click it other than being toxic survivor.
---
But when you are on a pallet, why on earth would you want to force killer to break the pallet? As long as the pallet is there you are winning. Why would you stand still ond point, beat the left control as it owes you money whn you could do what every good survivor would do. Start looping.  
---
When you move, of course killer will try to go around, then you change your way accordingly. You know, looping? If it's unsafe loop (I assume you don't know what that is because of your last comment so you should watch a youtube video of it), why would you drop a pallet and stand there still teabagging? You should run straight away from the killer to gain some distance, if killer doesn't break it you won even more time AND the palled will be there for later use.   
---
There is no good reason at all to stay still and teabag / point / come and get me gesture while you could start looping around and fake your escape.
---
We should make
---
F-tier into a Killer-killer
---
Yesterday someone said ,,Killyourself fucking huntress abuser".
---
Apparently huntress is gamebreaking, especially a huntress who played her like 5 times total lul.
---
I had a Jeff last night who crawled up in a map corner where I couldn't get him on a hook tell me how the endgame is unfair and if not for that he'd "show me". You made your choice to stay there and let spider mommy take care of you bud.
---
I swear survivor toxicity is off the charts for the slightest stupidest reasons lately. I play both sides equally and yes sometimes I come across toxic killers too sometimes but these survivors are something else , almost every single trial there will be salt.
---
Kinda pissed that Bill is coming.  I just found a main that I love in Ash.
---
I think Clown is F tier worthy
---
THERES AN ELLIS COSMETIC
---
btw all of my perks was tier 1 xd
---
Their perks were balanced landing and streetwise
---
I'd buy it
---
Yes, it fucking does matter, Sprint Burst isn't activatable for a reason. If you wanna abuse the exploit to grow your eDong and feel better about yourself go for it, but expect everyone to treat you like shit if you do.
---
its actually bigger cos you get super wide leg from some angles.
---
So your basically admitting that you have shitty reading skills
---
It's your opinion but I heavily disagree.
---
"Is it 'you're' or 'your?'... I'll just do both!"
---
Yeah, I agree.
---
Cindy’s block, or a high school would have been cool too, but I guess since they went a different way with ghostface those two wouldn’t really have made sense.
---
Definitely not. But you're entitled to your own opinion so I respect it.
---
What makes deliverance any good?
---
"a trick" is utilizing intented mechanics in unintented ways, what you're looking for is "exploit", the abuse of unintented mechanics in the code to do something you should not be able to.
---
yeah same on consoles as PC... you're on the exit gate,.... hmm wierd cant' hear nothing... then you're on a hook. Couple of Aussie killers who do it on PC heaps, and they always blame other peoples internet, except you know when they keep the cable out for more than 10? seconds and you hit the lobby cos your client thinks the killer DC'ed lol.
---
Mine isnt there uwu
---
I'd start with removing Lérys and Gideon Meat Packing Plant from the game... whether I win or lose on those maps I still can't enjoy the game, those maps are just terrible.
---
It would also be nice if the game wasn't balanced around green ranks.
---
When people say “hit through a window” they don’t mean they were directly on the other side. They mean they vaulted over and ran more than enough away from the window but still get hit.
---
This is especially so with window drops. (Like haddonfield houses) you’re over halfway to the ground already and the Killer still hits you. I’m almost 100% certain this is a hitbox issue with the vertical hitbox being a lot longer than it should.
---
i literally just skipped a little part of the video and i see 1 person injured and 1 person downed
---
Nope. Facecamping was standing in front of the hook preventing any ways for the survivors to unhook the hooked one at all. 
---
That's just camping
---
Trapper and Clown deserve F tier.
---
I got him to lvl 50 in his current state, and after the green ranks, he’s just frustrating to play; survivors can literally break your totem or finish a gen right in your face and you can do fuck all about it.
---
&gt; Camping is just standing next to the hooked guy because he was t bagging or something like that.
---
I mean standing next to the guy is in his face not allowing the unhook either. I've done this myself when the gates are open and 3 survivors are swarming the hook. Only way to secure a kill sometimes
---
I very much disagree but you have your opinion.
---
What's that got to do with quinten?
---
Agitation? Why?
---
The Prophecy
---
If they delete borrowed time.
---
Someone HAS to write this book, NOW!
---
Honest(l)yyyyyyyyyyy
---
I have very good reasonings for both.
---
As a relatively new player I have to admit not only the toxiciy is a problem but a matchmaking. I played like 200 hours already and peaked at 10 rank for both survs and killers. The thing is how come I met all ranks already? How come red ranks with thousands of hours are allowed to play vs green?
---
Of course, it is extremely hard, but not physically impossible. 
---
Facecamping made it literally impossible, physically, like if the Killer's bodyblocking the basement, you can literally not do anything. 
---
That's why I like to differentiate the two. Camping is a strategy, Facecamping was a literal abuse
---
What bullshit mental gymnastic to justify your shitty fucking behavior and poor sportsmanship.
---
Well I feel bad when killer facecamp or tunnels me and I usually tell that I didn't like that game. Though I don't really see these things as a rules, if the killer wants to be a jerk to me and deprive me from participating in a match, it's their own right in a way.
---
Good reason to have Kindred and DS equipped tho.
---
That got removed with the swivel hooks right?
---
Yup
---
Why isn’t this “uncivil bhvr”?!!
---
Yeah, I'm really glad they took the time to make Freddy a good killer instead of just chaning some of his stats
---
I laughed way too hard on this meme
---
interesting, If they're in my face like many screenshots on my profile, where I know I'm dead no matter my hook state, I'm still gonna call it facecamping. As I didn't play before swivel hooks. But i appreciate the differentiation
---
As soon as I read "noed has literally no risk" I knew there was no point in reading the rest of the comment. A hex perk has no risk?
---
Yeah as a survivor main this helps a lot. it would also help at some higher rank queues as well(hopefully)
---
Dead meme
---
I stopped playing 2 weeks ago for awhile because I would be camped after first hook every game and it’s just fucking pointless trying to level up.
---
They're just kissing no worries hes fine
---
Mind explaining what do you mean by that? How would that affect this? Sincere question.
---
Could I hear it?
---
Nea is F Tier  
---
Activ ability sucks, slowest killer in game and she does not even kick gens - instead she is reapring them.
---
To each their own, I ain't forcing you to call it as I do. I just like to remind what the term was. 
---
I'm a big Killer player but I'm glad it's gone forever.
---
yeah thats fair enough
---
Billy asked for it. 
---
Killer rule book for survivors. 
---
1. You’re in my world, bitch. 
---
That is all.
---
Lol....  Poor you, having 3 one shot hatchets..  The pain!  By far the most powerful add on in the game and it 100% should force you to only have 1 hatchet max.
---
Goto one exit. Open it until the first light is red. goto the other gate. open it. escape. The Killer is too busy to search u at first gate.
---
Players are never to blame. It's the game, high ping, bad mouse and stupid Trapper's traps.
---
We are all humans after all xD
---
They don't have the same impact. That's just objectively false. But like Dotey suggested, not a debate I'd even care to have.
---
Yeah survivors are usually potatoes until they hit purple ranks (rank 8 and below) and become really good at red ranks (4 and below). Enjoy those ranks as much as you can as red ranks are not fun. You literally feel the time ticking. If you waste 2 minutes chasing a survivor you'll see 3 Gens popping.
---
What ranks?
---
15 i remenber
---
Face camping is unacceptable, true, but many Survivors admonish all forms of "camping" (aka taking any action to prevent an unhook)
---
I would habe guessed they were rank 20 if they think Legion is op
---
yeah, it will just mean now survivors can lag switch instead. Dedicated servers doesn't stop people from lag switching
---
My pc sensitivity is really high...like...crazy high.
---
Once bill comes to console his perks will not be general pool anymore.
---
Trapper : the most add-on reliant killer and the killer with the most amount of counter play in the game. He wastes way too much time to set his traps ( that's what kills him ), his traps are very easy to disarm, hard countered by SWF teams, you can sabotage his traps with a Toolbox, you can Dead Hard over his traps, you can walk around his traps because the traps hit boxes are shit. 
---
Clown : his power only helps him in chases, he doesn't have mobility, stall, stealth, snow ball or anything else. His power even doesn't counter all loops and if you drop the pallet, he need to break it, because in that case his power is useless. He slows himself down after throwing a bottle, so the slow down from his bottles becomes useless in catching up survivors. He needs Flask of Bleach for his power to even work. He has 40+ bugs at the moment ( that's what kills him ).
---
xd
---
At this point, I get karma points instead :D
---
Give the killer crows.
---
They would absolutely hate me then, I main huntress when I play killer
---
Exactly what I thought it would be in the meme lol
---
I can get easy 4ks with both as vanilla. Those problems have never occurred.
---
The higher rarity items is barely noticeable/non existent. It says it’s there, but it’s not a factor when considering prestige
---
Bear trap: exists
---
rank 20 survivor: I HAVE A MIGHTY NEED
---
The more I watch Monto, the more I see his insecurity. idk it just feels to me as his vids are flooded with ego.
---
If you don't have enough shards for next week after getting bamboozle, I wouldn't buy it. Save it for a possible stronger perk. Clown also has Pop Goes the Weasel which imo is a higher tier perk, so lvling clown for both bamboozle and PGtW and saving your shards for ruin/nurses/BBQ would be better imo.
---
Nah didnt bring it up as big of a problem as dcing. Just a problem.
---
Live youtuber
---
It's because your own rank is lowered and you're matched with newer/worse players, to an extent anyway
---
Why do you disagree? In your opinion, what makes leatherface better?
---
My god, Monster is the cringiest one ive seen on this thread.
---
Getting hit by hatchets because she threw it at the block of air a foot behind you and above you
---
Nah, you're doing it wrong
---
If the gates are not close to each other, you can actually escape most of the time if doing correctly
---
&gt;You must be a grade A top tier Spirit.
---
You really don't have to be anything special to look away from things. You just consider what perks can be a problem to you and play around them. It's really not that hard to phase backwards/sideways.
---
&gt;Just cuz you look away for a singular second doesn’t mean anything.
---
That's not what I'm saying tho, im talking about starting and doing the entire phase either sideways or backwards and only turning back towards the gen once you are close enough to grab them.
---
Ready for it?
---
Legion.  Yup.
---
No way he would miss every single one then die of heart attack or at least that’s how it usually goes for me.
---
People care about rank in this game? JFL
---
I fucking live for these moments
---
Deliverance doesn’t even get used 90% of the matches I play with it, but it depends on your play style whether you would use it or not. If you’re getting hooked early in the game it’s pretty much useless, but if you get hooked first in the end game it can win the game for you.
---
I was playing as Legion. I can only guess they weren’t even looking behind themselves or around.
---
I watched the game to compliment him on his play afterwards, and once the game ended I saw he had NOED.  I have screenshots too if you would like to see.
---
TIL. Thanks. My friend who is new I may have forgotten to mention to her that if you try to escape with the helmet beeping u deaded
---
You're an actusl mongrel arent you?
---
fair enough
---
I don’t understand when a survivor decks out in add on/perks, it’s ok and funny for a killer to DC, but when a survivor does “it’s bad for the game” or toxic. Ever since the super long killer wait times, all I see are stupid survivors not knowing how to play the game and getting destroyed while killers seem to be super aggressive and make fun at ppl “not playing the game how it’s supposed to be played” aka not playing smart by saving pallets/ knowing maps and all that.
---
Crying about noed when you can literally remove it before it even activates
---
Lmao
---
Give the survivors comms by default, and then give killers a big buff, increase generator repair time and make killer perks better at applying pressure ( rework totems etc)
---
Gotta go with the flo
---
They'll find something new to bitch bout trust me, on DBD forums there's already a big thread on "who should get the next rework/major buffs" these people are fucking insane and need to get ignored yet they're also the people with 5000+ posts on that garbageforum and I think the devs might actually be listening to them.
---
Lol seemed spot on to me, if you're a fan of the show, you don't have to try and make everyone like it. Also you know what they say when you assume 👀
---
Dying light, though I suppose that's more on the killer side
---
What can he do to counter it? Even if he doesn’t post his videos they’ll still come to his stream just to click their flashlights and be dickheads. Recently it’s the same two users who come over and over to harass him, so it’s not just him guessing because they’re decent. There are plenty of occasions where he compliments players who are good as well.
---
Yeah I don't think you'll be seeing ny major switches unless they start getting rid of campers/mori's/other overpowered addons which you autists tend to use 24/7 after rank reset.
---
Welp this subreddit encourages it with their "just play how you want"-mentality, good job guys really good advice you're giving out, making this game a better game.
---
it takes 2 hatchets to down survivors normally, the math doesn't quite add up son
---
you'll need quite a few more pages to define what camping means to you, because it seems to be different for pretty much everyone who plays this game
---
Then why the fuck did you ask to remove it?
---
If one of his teammates went to get him he would have been able to return the favor with BT. Instead he got left behind and then didn't even have a chance to save himself
---
Awesome I wasn’t even aware of that perk for David thank you very much!
---
Damn dude relax lol
---
Freddy can use the time he cant hit the survivor to use his invisibility phases in the transition to mindgame and aquire hits that otherwise would not be possible. This combined with his aura reading makes wakeing up agajnst a good freddy a risk when injured (probebly from the first mindgame), in addition staying in the dream world to heal fully isnt viable due to the amount of time it takes and finding another survivor is risky as it would not only wake you up (makeing you vunerable) but also give freddy more pressure via sleeping the other survivor. Freddy can also use aura reading to ambush survivors in dream world with M&amp;A if he recognises they are in an unsafe area, allows him to ping pong betwern multiple survivors for map pressure and also allows hin to be able to aford to kick gens when other killers cant.
---
Meanwhile LF needs green addons to "insta" break pallets and against good survivors the chance to use his power will come rarely.
---
She Is faster than a walking nurse and a crouched pig
---
Man, reading your comments is annoying af. Like, separate from the debate we are having, on a completely different note, it's stupid. The emojis just hurt your case, and the streeeeeetching of words pointlessly makes you seem somewhat dense.
---
And whatever. I just take solace in knowing your opinion is wrong. Have a good day!
---
He doesn't need addons to instabreak. Just charge up in a pallet loop and respect it and they'll most likely drop it down.
---
While granting more BP is definitely a way to make playing survivor more attractive than it is, this idea that so many people play above all for BP is something often brought up here, but only rarely seen in the actual game. Survivors rarely even use WGLF, which they absolutely would if they cared more about points than about escaping. That idea is akin to another one you can read on here sometimes, namely that survivors are supposedly bored of how easy it is to win if they try to, and that's why they don't try, don't repair generators, etc. - which obviously is also ridiculous. Most of the time if survivors do stupid things it's because they are not good at the game and because the game is not easy if the killer is not bad at the game, not because they only play for points or don't care about winning.
---
Your idea is not bad, as it would boost survivor BP gain without weighing certain in-game actions, which, fair enough, could at least in theory lead to people playing unoptimally to gain more points. But then it can also be argued that players might be even less concerned about doing well, with your system in place, since they get a portion of points from their teammates' efforts anyway.
---
Things that would make solo survivor more appealing are combating disconnects, better ranking and matchmaking systems that more-so look at how well players are actually doing in terms of winning games, matching similarly-successful players rather than letting just about anyone rank up with time, and matching just about anyone with and against anyone (gotta love when the killer has ten times the hours of my "teammates" combined, and likely ten times the winning rate of them combined, as well), innate game mechanics to improve solo survivors' means to combat camping and tunnelling, and likewise means to better coordinate (e. g. built-in Kindred, Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike-like mechanics that are however disabled once all generators are done, totem counter, chase state indicator on player avatars, etc.), rebalancing killers (nerfing some select killers and add-ons and Moris, but also buffing other killers, and global killer buffs to compensate for improvements aimed at solo survivors, such as built-in NOED, BBQ (without the point doubling), as well as compensatory SWF nerfs due to global survivor buffs, limiting their perk slots, and/or increasing gen times, on a per-member basis.
---
Due to leatherfaces slow this is unviable. Leatherface needs to be breathing down a survivors neck to use his power, thsts not hoing to happen at a pallet loop. Any time this works is due to the survivor fucking up.
---
Trust me, I Main Legion. I’m overly well aware how useless 90% of their addons are. Not to mention Iridicent Button only makes your TR global and not your detection range global, they nerfed the cooldown addons while increasing the fatigue so even Cold Dirt And Joey’s only combines to take off 1 sec (.6 and .4 sec each) Franks Mix Tape does absolutely nothing useful and downing someone with your ability alone would take over 60 seconds, Stab Wounds Study also does nothing useful and even when combined with Franks, you still take over 40 sec to down someone with your power, Also your vaulting speed is so low and you still push yourself so far that you can’t regain collision before the survivor can vault it again, so unless you’re running Iri Button And Bamboozle you’re gonna lose most vault plays. 
---
All the pins are garbage. 
---
 It’s literally more beneficial to just run no addons, Iri/Duration or Filthy/Nasty blade because everything else is self sabotage. 
---
Like I can work with this new Legion but nothing really about them is fun compared to any other standard killer.
---
Actually pretty excited about the mobile version. Wish I could get in on it now.
---
I would like to know what area triggers the spine chill? Like, should i look directly at the survivor in order to trigger the perk, or is it some certain degrees value? 
---
 Like, for example, 15 degrees in front of me? Or surv should get in any spot of my field of view?
---
No you're not.
---
Real shit?
---
Gen rushing is not the same as tunnelling and insta heals are the only good addon survivors have compared to killers.
---
imagine getting outplayed by the weakest Killer 9/10 times

Has discordance appeared in Shrine before?
---
Oh, what now...
---
I mean, I'm terrible at nurse, but at least I blink...
---
still hoping for Cross Progression...
---
Cmon that’s just a little harmless fun, chat is where the real toxicity shows
---
Well... In the end you lose, not having the Hag herself, for she is very usefull)
---
Like fuck off man, Ash would beat the shit out of shaggy
---
Of course they are angry! You ruined their generator simulator!
---
I feel like something like that would also come with cross platform play which would put console users at a disadvantage over PC users.
---
That's obviously going to be that way, yes. But that wasn't my point. The parent comment stated that the user "gets the feeling console will *finally* start seeing Bill perks in the shrine once he comes out for us", which makes no sense given the fact that they are unlocked for every console player *right now*. There is no reason for a console player to "hope you'll finally start seeing Bill's perks in the Shrine" because *you have these perks unlocked at the very moment*. That was my point.
---
It would be an entirely different story if someone said "I'm looking forward to Bill's console release because I'm a PC player and haven't leveled Bill. His perks on consoles will become teachable perks and that means there's a chance they will finally appear in the Shrine again!". But that wasn't the case.
---
The problem is, is that there are killers who literally face camp because they don’t like being looped.
---
Well... Guess i'll have to repair these sumbitches myself, otherwise im beeing toxic and using op killers
---
That's hilarious how delusional they were. The only time being pulled of a gen isn't your own fault is unexpected lag.
---
I mean if one person is obession you have to assume all 4 have DS and waste time slugging. Both sides have perks like that.
---
Thank god this Rulebook doesnt apply to us! Were not Killers! We are the Hookers!
---
It's basically tricking the survivors into thinking you're going to do one action, when you actually do the other. For example, for survivors, they'll always see a red glow in front of the killer on the ground, a mind game there would be to face the other direction so they can't see your red glow, they then think you're going to head in the other direction and then you can 180 to hit them.
---
I agree tbh, if a killer uses noed with bloodwarden you can pretty much get yourself a 3k last second for complete free since noed gives you that movement speed so even bad killers will catch up eventually
---
Nope, not at all.
---
They have one, it's Detective's Hunch
---
Sprint burst bug?
---
You see a totem cleanse it. Jeez
---
i mean i have some teachables and i can't use them because don't appear
---
NOED and insidious.
---
I loved that video soooo much.. and I'm a survivor main.
---
good one bro XD
---
Yeah I get that, and that sucks. I really only do it if I’m getting really provoked and i see that the guy is so much better than me. Basically just eliminating the best contender. Well I don’t face camp, I just stay within eye shot basically. Standing I front of the dude watching him die seems kinda sucky
---
The fuck you say bye for you instantly replied.
---
You look like a fucking idiot. 
---
I think the hex ruin buff is a good one. 
---
It's the only one I read cause i wanted to argue against this sad ass. 
---
I cant remember a game where i dont find the ruin in the first 20 seconds .
---
I mean far more often I hit the windowsill while they're mid vault.
---
That's your fault for playing into their plan. Some killers have an easier time than others at defeating looping though.
---
Funny that im an survivor main and ur an idiot.
---
I intentionally pointed out reworked Freddy because there is little to no difference between pre-reworked Freddy and Leatherface. Their powers aren't as interesting for me, easily counterable and they still boil down to being M1 killer. Meanwhile reworked Freddy has a similar potencial to Hag in sense that he would be more tactically played and it's just nice to have more trap based killers because Trapper sucks so all you have left is well, Hag.
---
I am oddly amazed
---
Legion, Doctor, Pig.
---
Wouldn't say they're F.
---
He always was shit tier. What made him "good" were broken add-ons and exploits.
---
Actually he is better now
---
Dead Before Bedtime
---
where is the Killer?
---
Slow killer as well.
---
Why? He breaks loops easily
---
youre a retardmain irl
---
I've heard mixed things, either they become killers or the entity basically absorbs their soul and they become a husk in the entity to fuel it's power since that's the point of the sacrifices. I personally don't think they become killers because most of the killers backstories make it sound like they were just taken as is (Rin being half dead and being taken by the entity, Philip literally was taken after ripping his boss' head off, Anna being taken while an army was approaching her home etc etc.)
---
Also, 457. Don’t use loops. *cough cough* Tru3Ta1ent *cough*
---
Fair point. Infinite mending and the franks mixtape iridescent button addons were bull but some other kills also need some addons to be decent. Even new Freddy is worse without his best addon, Fake Pallets(don’t remember the addon). Every killer needs addons, just some more than others.
---
Wehh i think hex ruin needs buffs wehh, just stfu you rank 15 trash.
---
He isn't slow anymore, standard Trapper's speed.
---
What's Billy's weakness?
---
Bill is traveling to the console version
---
You're not stupid, you're special!  
---
Just ask you mom she'll confirm it!
---
That's not how they intended the perk to work. Aren't the first couple frames of sb invincible? Maybe they used to be??
---
Turns out I am the slow one. :c
---
I hate plague but god damn I like the egyptian one
---
How does NOED work? If I destroy 3 dull totems before gens are finished is there a chance it won't activate or do I have to destroy all 5?
---
Every time he annoys you just say: "Don't be such a Meg..."
---
WGLF after the nerf is just wasting a perk slot and throwing the game for the rest. Same with selfcare, sprint burst is cool but you definitelly want to have dead hard and adrenaline instead. I would say if you are an Solo player go for BOND/DEAD HARD-BALANCED LANDING/ADRENALINE/BORROWED TIME-DECISIVE STRIKE-IRON WILL.
---
 Well then... The longer it goes, the better chances of it showing up in the Shrine.
---
 Much worse if it has already been in the shine. In that case it could not appear in months.
---
Gatta love seeing the same post every 30 minutes

I love that game

---
I never said you were. But we’re both off topic. All of adam’s Perks are blessings and amazing.
---
Didn't know PCs had sensitivity settings. What does it do? Does it help you with dragging your pc faster on the floor? 🤔😮
---
Ey I'm right for once, I couldn't remember if it was hope or soul since the game does mention hope quite a bit with the perks.
---
You dare challenge ultra instinct shaggy mortal?
---
Last time I mori'd someone with ghostface two of his teammates ran in to get in on the selfie. Wish I had remembered to screen shot it.

Remember when no0b3 killed a baby dwight and got mori,d next game
---
Rofl what a fucking moron don't tlak to me.
---
Why not?
---
You'r? Wow.
---
Why why not?
---
Cleansing a lit totem activates haunted ground, it's made to protect your other hex perks and discourage the survivors from touching lit totems.
---
Use the Petrified Oak Offering, it spaces out hooks.
---
You need to 2 pip. Tested with Plague, killed everyone, no achievement.
---
It's about how fast and easy you can down them you stupid fuck.
---
Ah yes ofcourse. Lets not forget that with addons you can literally fail finding the key 3 times in a row combined with their possibly only being a few on the map COMBINED with a pink that removes players ability to see the boxes around the map.
---
Shes not op by any means but can be annoying to play against
---
How is that counter?
---
If it’s maxed out then you won’t hear any grunts but if it’s lower level you still hear them they’re just progressively quieter until you max out the perk. For example I have iron will on my Jeff for his obnoxiously loud moans but it’s only at 75% at the moment so he now sounds a tad quieter than the normal characters.
---
Even worse for you then. Only teachables i have are for the people i play(Quick &amp; Quiet on Meg, my main survivor) or i already unlocked them.
---
This may be the dumbest thing i have seen
---
If I get one more Coldwind on Doctor or Lerys on Billy, I'm going to commit mori on myself
---
Forever ago, i had survivors destroying hooks so this guy ran all the way to the corner without any hooks in sight, so when i left him to die on the ground, he called me toxic for slugging. 
---
I then sent him a message back in quotations "hey while i destroy every hook in sight and i run to the corner, please pick me up so i have a chance to escape"
---
Didnt message me back after that
---
Yeah anyone who thinks ruin needs buffs is a literal fucking baby crying, fuck off back to kindergarden where the teacher might've cared for your gay cries.
---
That looks cool
---
Real men use no mither
---
oof that blink onto the genning meg was beautiful
---
Yes, noed indeed is a hability cap, so does spine chill, if you avoid the killer 24/7, you'll never understand loops
---
Tru3
---
Stunning himself when he chainsaws into a wall.
---
...or maybe someone genuinely disliked the video? Y’all need to chill with this victim complex
---
He actually looks decent  now
---
That just how DH works though; you’re immune to damage while using it.
---
Real men use no mither, self care, best survivor build
---
If the killer is say a skilled hillbilly who can chainsaw survivors without serious trouble he probably isnt running noed, now a nurse with noed has a high chance since the nurse needs to teleport to hit survivors.
---
I always get “open the exit gates as___” “get chased by the killer for 120 seconds as ____” and “kill someone by your hand as hag”
---
It's not wrong to have an opinion, but your verbiage doesn't really indicate it's your opinion.

Oh hi Mark
---
I try not to DC because I get mad when my teammates do it, but I had a game the other day with a very brain dead Quentin.
---
He got me downed because apparently revealing the Ghostface that he could see was too much work and decided to UE around to a wall. I go down and that's fine I'm okay with that it's just the first hook. Quentin gets me off the hook with the Ghostface running back to the hook, no BT so I go down instantly cause Quentin decided not to take a hit. Jeff comes this time to save me and he tried to help, dude actually took a hit and tried to get the killer off me but the killer decided to tunnel. So I DCed when he got me downed because it was literally the first minute of the game and I'm not giving a guy sacrifice points for my teammate not trying to help or him tunneling. Definitely shitty and I don't like doing that, but like I said it was the first minute of the game and I kind of would like to actually play the game I have to pay for almost every month to play cause I got it for free as a PS+game.
---
Any other time I've DCed was because the game was glitching and I couldn't see skillchecks, think I've only DCed those two times over all.
---
For now on I'll call people garage when I'm salty

It happens bro :)

WAKE UP FINALLY IN THE SHRINE
---
If you have an instadown people wont think you have NOED, so they wont bother cleansing totems, then you have NOED and it is a free win. Also it's a lot easier to M1 someone than to chainsaw or hit a hatchet. Also in the case for Myers, if you get T3 of a lot you might not have enough stalk for another T3 at the end.
---
You hate going against the Doctor or playing as him?
---
Isnt deliverance nerfed?
---
Isn't third seal for hag? How do you have 3rd seal but no ruin?
---
Well.. I had a killer yesterday accuse us of being toxic for all being Kates.
---
None of us were swf...
---
Going against, completely hate it.
---
Because you get matched with people like me, sorry :)

"eriously go buy a fucking rope in minecraft and jump off the highest tower you can build." I want you to pin that on your wall... as a reminder of your lowest point in life.

Lastly you dumb fucker your little oxymoron of fuckboy and reject.. stop just fucking stop you dumb motherfucker you can't even string a couple words together without contradicting your dumbass.

Look at this entire post, you think anyone agrees with you?
---
But I doubt you care, people shitting on you must be a pretty common occurrence. Bet that numb feeling you have when it comes to other people must be fun. 
---
Do us all a favour and fuck off back to your isolated depression.
---
I'm not saying they arent bad I'm just saying that they've never been any different
---
How is she boring? She's the most hilarious character to play if played correctly
---
It punishes survivors for rushing the game and not slowing down and doing their secondary objective,  the totems, you could say devour hope buys the killer time because once he gets three stacks they freak out and leave the other survivors to die on the hook or run around the map looking for the totem, except it was added to punish overly altruistic survivors, the extra time was a side effect, exactly the same case with noed, extra time as a side effect because survivors arent used to doing their secondary objectives and rush the game.
---
While I appreciate the effort, these are almost all a bit too Mortal Kombat'd for DBD's tone.
---
Yeh no he's way over his head with that one.
---
I'm missing something. She stunned him up. Should she not have?
---
How's Billy broken?
---
If a dull totem exists, NOED will activate on that totem.
---
I saw someone suggest a Killer gauntlet in similar vein to the 2 killers idea. Two killers have to compete for the most amount of kills in a match. Survivors get hooked and die instantly but respawn after a bit and the match ends when the time is over. They also said something about killers being able to hit one another to stun each other to deny kills. Don't know how it would work survivor side, maybe least amount of deaths is the person who wins on their side or there are gens for the survivors to work on to get out. There'd probably be more survivors as well.
---
No mither, self-care, insta-heal, unbreakable,  and solidarity is the best build
---
Totems are secondary objectives, also if they bring devour hope, well everyone isnt going to touch a gen when they see exposed with no timer, they'll be running around the map looking for that totem, and if the killer gets five stacks, it's game over at that point.
---
Window hits aren't the case of latency. It's how the game is designed, animation just looks crappy.
---
Because you keep screaming?
---
Good observation. I can see the reasoning in that back in the day, but now that power creep has eliminated those, it's clear that Nurse and Billy are the only Killers whose powers outweigh their weaknesses enough to justify them.
---
I don't even dislike the idea of Trapper having to avoid his own traps, it's just kind of unfair in practice.
---
You copied the photo of that one Meg cosplayer..
---
Also noed was added to counter gen rushing
---
Fuck off whiny bitch you really think I give  shit if you die? You're a fucking moron the world would be better off without you.
---
Or they decided to leave their brain in a jar and run no mither.
---
Have you seen this video? https://youtu.be/AMtRRTvmYpM

---
Ez map pressure. Instadown. 115 MS. No cooldown or drawback to his power. Instasaw still kinda exists. 
---
Now he isn't as broken as Nurse but he for sure is too strong. 
---
In this context I'm talking about his chainsaw hitbox
---
It can also depend on rank.
---
I never recommend RNG. If it's consistent, Trapper could make strategies around it, like baiting Survivors into traps by setting new ones under pallets while pretending not to notice them, but 50/50 just means you're randomly not punished for a mistake with no new freedom to actually constitute a buff.
---
You're exaggerating now, I play solo most of the time and I counter noed fairly easily. You just need to know the totems spawns and know that only one can be spawned in a part of the map.
---
Probably. That loop is huge as a normal movement-speed killer and myers is only 105%. So the loop is extremely safe and high value also because there is no walls so you can see the killer. So no mindgaming either.
---
Sure the loop is still there but the pallet was wasted when it could have been used much more effectively.
---
It has begun
---
Anyone who thinks hex ruin needs a buff is a moron, no exceptions, I don't care who it is that says it needs buffs they're automatically put in the moron-category, I love nothing more thn to tell morons like you they're wrong, not enough circlejerking with your 4 accounts to make me go "oh shit I should agree or else people won't like me" idgaf if some 200 hour rank 15 doesn't like my opinions.
---
No they aren't toxic, but if a survivor is being chased and they follow the killer the entirety of the chase instead of doing the damn objective just to get the flashlight save, a measly 300 BP that's toxic. And you wasted more time trying to save a person essentially taking two people out of the game for the entirety of the chase. You would've been out faster had you let them get hooked and saved them then.
---
Pallets are a point of leverage survivors can use against a killer and keep looping them around a piece of terrain and delaying the killer for as long as possible while your teammates play the objective. By dropping the pallet instantly all leverage against the cooler is lost on that loop and the killer can just keep chasing until he eventually catches up. Or something like that, anyways.
---
Thanks. I haven't played much on Gideon's. Thank chriminey
---
okay so unless you use your flashlight only to reveal hag traps, the flashlight serves no other purpose than blinding the killer so how can it be considered toxic?
---
Irididescent head isn't that good because of the very slow wind up. Machine gun Huntress was way stronger and is gone now.
---
Yes but in real life. A homicidal killer isn't gonna put you on a meathook to sacrifice you to the dark God it serves once it stabs you twice. 
---
In real life, nobody is gonna look at lockers full of hunting hatchets and *NOT* try to use them in self defense. 
---
In real life, nobody is gonna only get to do the only thing thematically described as fighting back AFTER they've been weakened by a killer. 
---
Hitting during vaulting animations is fine. Hitting someone on the other side of a window is stupid.
---
&gt;for your gay cries.
---
Why they gotta be gay?
---
I see your Lightborn and I raise you one Franklin's Demise
---
I love how the salty people downvoted you but I totally agree with you.
---
They think running around clicking flashlights will keep you from damaging gens.
---
The world wouldn't even fucking notice If you died.
---
1. How are the two different?
---
2. No individual Survivor add-ons should be as good as Killer add-ons. Why? The Killer can take in up to 2 add-ons, while the Survivors can take in up to 8.
---
Wow ive never seen anyone with actual negative karma on their account, im actually kind of impressed
---
I met a similar if not the same person. He was the Hag and when I was the last one stan... crawling he picked me up and just stood there so I could free myself. He then lead me to a gen and two hexes to cleanse. Then brought me over to the hatch and closed it so I could step on his trap. He then lead me to the exit and we bid farewell.
---
So why can't Surviviors use the hatchets in lockers to fight the killer? You know. Hatchets are, small axes that anyone over 18 and fearing for their life is probably gonna be inclined to bring for self defense purposes
---
Thought he had head on and it showed how broken the perk is, then you said the perks lol
---
A speed boost is still very nice and not having to worry about manipulating your power to get the insta down and just being able to basic attack for it still makes it worth using.
---
Susie be like: I see you bitch.
---
Yeah, it's so unfair how Huntress hatchets lock on auto aim and heat seek around corners so they take no skill whatsoever to use. Looking in someone's general direction and just sorta holding m2 is SO much harder.
---
Guys just a warning. (I'm a survivor main)There are many salty people complaining about totems in this thread. Please do not continue if you do not want to lose braincells
---
I meant an innate gameplay ability just explained as that. We sacrificed logic a while ago in this game; as early as Wraith's backstory skipping over where he gets the bell. It wouldn't be an insane destruction of lore for Trapper to just not get caught in his traps anymore.
---
What???? you really think I was upset over the "telling me to go die" part.. you fucking offensive little shit, I welcome that pathetic show of weakness. What I was upset with was the fucking Minecraft vessel you used to deliver it. Was the most pathetic sad thing iv'e ever read. Look at you like a cornered rat being spam down-voted, lashing out at anyone your claws can reach. Give it up.
---
That must be 2000 ping 😂
---
So is Hex:Ruin but you don't  hear survivors complain....I'll see my out.
---
Yeah! It's a great cosplay! Do you know her? I couldn't find her Twitter or anything- I was working off a screen shot my friend showed me.
---
still would like a totem counter lol
---
Adrenaline is either very good or bad for you. If you are injured it's good but uf you're not it just wastes your exhaustion. Noed is also annoying how about a killer perk get's actually reworked and nerfed instead of just survivors every patch?
---
Insidious just wastes time.
---
What do I do if the survivor I’m chasing u hooks right in front of me? So I should just hook the one I was chasing and let the other injured survivor run away for no reason?
---
What? Only good thing about him is his map pressure. It's easy to avoid getting chainsaw'd, he gets looped easily just like any other killer except nurse and spirit, these you can say that are broken
---
Clown gets slowed when he throws the bottle all the time so that point doesn't make sense. Neither does the "if you break the pallet they'll run to another loop" because they'll do that with any killer. And when I played vanilla trapper I got never gen rushed and I was rank 4 at my highest.
---
I haven't seen it before.
---
I mean so is noed so I cannot really argue
---
It's an offering, not a perk. Every Killer has a unique mori animation
---
small game
---
Can instaheals only be used on others?
---
small game does not give you a totem counter. would be cool if they buffed it to do that though. it would help big time for solo
---
They did what I hope most reworks can do: take a generally unfun Killer and make them fun. I'm less concerned about every Killer being strong. I just want them to be enjoyable to play.
---
I see your franklins demise and raise you the fact that you cant have EVERYONE disarmed at all times.
---
Or...
---
Lightborn AND Franklins demise.
---
Differing points of view. I felt legion was A tier just like how Billy is A tier currently to me, not the least bit threatening on his own but with addons becomes terrifying. It’s almost the same way right now where you can play certain ways and do good in purple(possibly, not always) and yellow ranks but anything red ranks is just Legion getting bullied.
---
Played a game where as spirit I only got 1 sacrifice before the doors opened. 2 Survivors got greedy and sat by the gate waiting to tea bag me then I phase to behind them and NOED knock them out before chasing down the last guy. Basically I went from a poor match to a no one escaped match all because the survivors wanted to be cheesy. :)
---
Which edition is that? Every Survivor has a different rulebook.
---
You clearly don't play in SWF. Its so much fun there than Killer Lmao
---
No, you can also use them on yourself. Start healing yourself by using the Medkit, and while healing, press L1 to use the insta-heal add-on on yourself.
---
because  maybe he likes to play actual huntress rather then shortcut huntress
---
Is this how you post ranting threads by posting dumb pictures? All of a sudden his "reeee stop crying bout NOED"-thread is fun? it's like a bunch of fucking kids who can't read books without pictures, dumbass subreddit.
---
It's broken because it doesn't let him escape easily, ez reasons.
---
I couldn't find it on his twitch anymore so he might have deleted it, fortunately I first saw it on youtube.
---
https://youtu.be/I6RIrDriPMI?t=101
---
LF is a ok killer. Old Freddy when played right is a ok killer. You need to remember LF's hook defence. Old Freddy is literally the worst killer at hook defense. I know that kinda is negated when you play him right but verses a actual good team Freddy wouldn't be able to capitalize off hook saves as well.
---
Daily rituals are capped at 3. Once you have three active rituals, all you can do is delete one (undesirable) ritual per day.
---
I literally dropped someone so they could go in the hatch and they still complained saying ''Thanks but your tier 3 unlimited Myers perk was a unfair.'' like.. then don't stand there letting me stalk you to get it.
---
as soon as logic thrown in u fucking run.. gross
---
I want an ultra rare addon added to the key. Currently a broken key is the worst item in the game(imo) so i feel it needs a buff in the form of an ultrarare broken key only addon.
---
I only do it to entertain the last survivor
---
BBQ and Chili just seems like an excuse for insidious bubba
---
Yes he very much was
---
imagine adding Sprits Phasing sound to Wraith :D
---
Ahh ok thanks
---
It's a good idea but would be too difficult to add an ability without overriding an existing perk. Nurse's calling should show more blood, but bloodhound exists. It's just not practical in theory
---
Screw your rules 
---
-Trapperw
---
Legion has one add on that does anything. Everything else is basically useless.
---
*NERF ME DADDY*
---
Not at red ranks. I'm red ranks as survivor and killer every reset, fact is you don't see Pig, Legion or Doctor at those ranks. And in the very rare case where you do, they get their shit pushed in. That's just the facts. Pig is probably the best of that three, but that's as far as it goes.
---
i pray
---
I know of two streamers that are at 14.
---
Because 7 second fedora man bad /s
---
People actually never bothered to learn how to play him but he's (or was, now that we are getting a rework) actually decent
---
I'd be surprised if it isn't the case. The past two weeks have been consistent with this.
---
I dont get what is so bad about Noed?
---
Nurses calling would probably just make the skill checks much more difficult while in a certain radius but it’s just a suggestion
---
It's more like people sitting at the exit gate and giving me shit (which honestly isnt that bad), but then they talk shit in the chat about how bad of a killer I am
---
Plus, I dont tunnel or camp. I cant even tunnel lmao, they ran me around the whole game (remember: I'm level 19)
---
I turned off chat and I'm fine now lmao
---
Billy's mobility plus his one hit potential would probably be your best bet. Strong out of the blocks and at the end.
---
Doctor is an M1 killer. His ability does nothing against purple/red ranks who know even what they are slightly doing. I'm red ranks as survivor and killer every reset, fact is you don't see Pig, Legion or Doctor at those ranks. And in the very rare case where you do, they get their shit pushed in. That's just the facts. I haven't seen a doctor at red ranks in months.
---
Leatherface and Wraith were already worse than Freddy (not saying that freddy is good, he's already mediocre but he's better than these two
---
Doesn't matter how easy hillbillies chainsaw is to hit, M1 will most likely be faster. And yeah, if you don't have more Evil to get then you've probably already won.
---
I think LF is better than (old?) Freddy in most situations although they both have things that tend to be drawbacks for example the fact that Freddy can't hit anybody before sleeping them or for LF the distance you cover with your saw so little that you just barely can catch a survivor running straight forward when you don't have add-ons. I personally think that LF is on the same lv as pig since they both have underwhelming pros but not really any cons.
---
Stupid question but when does the Freddy rework come live? I cant keep the dates in order
---
Otzdarva is the only streamer I've come across that I really like. Hearing him say things like "well played" and "good job" when survivors evade him earned my respect so fast.
---
Every other streamer I've checked out has seemed douchey in comparison. I actually once had a streamer say "gg" in chat at the end of a game and invite me to check out their stream, only to find out when I did that they'd spent the entire match insulting me and cussing me out on stream. That dude was the biggest sack of shit on Earth and I hope his pissant stream never takes off and he has to spend the rest of his life working a job he hates while always wondering why nobody likes him and slowly growing to hate himself more and more until he eventually dies sad and alone in a pool of his own vomit.
---
Not that I'm bitter or anything.
---
So, it's a good perk?
---
No shit Adrenaline is annoying to go against, same as how NOED and Endurfury are "annoying" to go against. Doesn't mean anything other than that the perks can be good.
---
wym they're obviously the reactionaries here? "uhhhh something something fetus has heartbeat so new rule you can't kill it"
---
I'm red ranks as survivor and killer every reset, fact is you don't see Pig, Legion or Doctor at those ranks. And in the very rare case where you do, they get their shit pushed in.
---
So, overwhelming presence .
---
Damn. On ps4 there is still some varirty in red ranks ig. I see quite a few different killers( even tho billy boi alot). But pig seems good and i have been beaten by them before. She can slow down the game with traps, steath, and mindgame pallets with stealth.
---
I've been having a lot of fun with the Legion recently
---
Just loop him and his chainsaw is useless, he's not broken... He is strong, but not broken.
---
Legion
---
“No one is telling you how to play the game but here’s how you SHOULDN’T play the game”
---
yeaaaaaaaa I feel like it'd be great if you could somehow force skill checks to pop or something, but when you can heal a person to full without a single skill check... it's not very good :(
---
His power does nothing in the chase and very little out of the chase. He’s countered by the most commonly ran perk in the entire game. He literally has to wait 7 seconds to do what every other killer could do immediately. On top of all of that he also gets fucked even harder by SWF. He’s easily F tier.
---
Umm, That causes items to have a much faster consumption rate, This would make skill checks for Healing interactions much harder. Totally different
---
And then your friend ditches you because you're actually sensitive enough to care about teabagging.
---
Factual*
---
I'm not waiting 2 minutes because a killer wants to slug for the 4k I don't care if the other survivor get's hatch either, I just wanna play the next game.
---
Obviously because they're low tier. But they're not F. They have consistent abilities and if you're good enough you can end chases and slow the game down a hefty amount.
---
Spirit games can be quick if you know what you’re doing.
---
Maybe you do bones next time.
---
Pig is way better than leather face.
---
Pig has stealth, mind games with her lunge and the ability to slow the game down with her traps.
---
Leather face's chainsaw can't compete with all of that, Pig is no where near the badness that is leather face
---
\*cough\* Freddy wouldn't be getting a rework if he was good. \*cough\*
---
While you injured and you're running, this is pure gold
---
I've literally never fucking seen this. You're probably exaggerating, and it's a good meme anyways. I wouldn't mind seeing it again in a week or two
---
If I ever saw him again i’d make it a point to let him die on the hook, not saving him.
---
I'd say they are indeed F rank. You could say that about any killer, "if you're good enough". Old Freddy was also better than all three as long as you were good at split pressure.
---
IMO Billy's mori is alright. I love Doctor's and Nurse's mori. Huntress' one is very brutal, IMO it's great. Pig is kinda boring...LF has super brutal gory animation, I love it. Spirit would be really nice, but this sudden stand up looks stupid. I don't like Myers' mori because it's too bugged
---
okay, you seem to be bit confused here. hitboxes themselves are fine. when people say "fix hitboxes" they mean the part where on p2p hitboxes ≠ 3d models. they appear differently on survivor and killer screens due to connection. your hitbox is still in killer's reach when visually on your screen you're behind the corner. that's the problem dedicated servers supposed to fix. which won't get fixed if servers are bad cause their connection is unstable. 
---
you had one killer game where it put you on the server with good connection. so obviously you didn't feel the difference. i've had killer games with yellow, green and red ping. green ping was good, i had no problems with it. but yellow and red ping lobbies would give me trash hits all the way through. very annoying. 
---
obviously you could dodge the red and yellow ping lobbies but considering the fact on pc it takes a lot of time to get a killer lobby, you can't be very picky. can't just dodge a created lobby.
---
same with survivor lobbies. there i tested all types of ping and yellow was worse than p2p because yellow/red p2p can mean that the host is far from your location but it doesn't mean you'll have laggy game if their connection is stable. i never dodge stable 200-250 ping as survivor cause with stable connection it only means minor weirdness. while jumping yellow-green might be very annoying because it points out that host is close but has very unstable connection and you never know where it can screw you over. while yellow ping on dedicated servers literally means it's going to be bad for you.
---
Yeah but like insta downs
---
yes
---
Definitely not. But it's your opinion and I respect it.
---
I'm talking specifically from PC, maybe the killer meta is different on console with controllers or whatever.
---
Imo he has one of the best animations ever.
---
I’m starting to really love survivors using object, because I can keep track of them so easy. Had a game as ghostface yesterday, one dead, one hooked, and other two both with object. Managed to just stare them done until she went to struggle, not even near hook, just waddling between the two and forcing them to stay away. They didn’t jump on gens, or try to be smart, just ran around doing nothing trying so hard to bait me. Ended with a 4K
---
There is a "leave game" button readily available that still even let's you spectate and chat at the end. I'd argue DC'ing is definitely part of the game.
---
Exactly! I love it! And that heavy breathing.
---
That actually kinda looks like him in the movie. Nice job.
---
*\*bitch slap intensifies\**
---
even if they will nerf the reworked Freddy slightly, its still a massive improvement
---
How good he is isnt a factor, what was is the demand for a rework as many dont know how to play him effectively. In addition slow action speed feels bad and he was hell for low ranks. If there wasnt so much demand then mabey leatherface would have been reworked instead.
---
If you insta down with LF, you didn't outplay the survivor, they fucked up.
---
Compent survivors are not gonna get downed by the chainsaw, or if they do, they've already wasted so much of your time that you've already lost the game by the time you do down them
---
I don't know how many times I've been caught red handed third hook and all I could think to do was tea bag madly in the hopes that the friction catches my character model on fire and the killer won't touch me. Don't take my mindless fun away please?
---
"All right, it's official. I decided I hate zombies." -Bill
---
It's already dead. Just get the mobile version
---
Unnerving presence was the actual perk, whoops.
---
Look on the bright side, you're playing by the rules of the *Survivor Rulebook for Killers* so you'r earning uh... brownie points.
---
I mean it’s a very strong perk xP I had trouble thinking of a good unique addition to make it somewhat stronger (as it would take up 2 Slots).
---
She really doesn’t
---
Same here.
---
There are games I've played awful in.  I just want it to end.  I've opened the doors.  I've moved away.  Why do I now have to chase all four of you out the gate?  Can't you just leave, so we can all move on to the next game?
---
I get if you are missing a teammate, you want to wait in case they go down and you can save them.  But all four standing by the gates?  GTFO.
---
The only time I teabag is when I have looped the killer the whole game and im at the gate
---
How in the fuck did you get 70k? Most I’ve ever gotten was like 27
---
I don’t know her personally but I messaged her about it and she wasn’t aware that you were using her as a reference. She isn’t happy about it. Her twitter is sofinikum. At the very least I think you should refrain from selling it.
---
Pretty much, I've denied killers their NOED a few times and I've had them instantly DC as soon as they hit someone and don't instantly go down. It's like that for a lot of killer perks, take down ruin and a lot of killers create no pressure or drop pallets early so killers can't use spirit fury and suddenly they can't catch anyone.
---
Not your fault they taunted you. Ya taunt ya gonna die.
---
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU PLAYING AS SUSIE YOU FUCKING DEGENERATE.
---
Read the edit. 
---
And haven't you heard of madness? That makes hitting skillchecks harder and you have to snap out of it if you're tier 3.
---
People who DC intentionally are cowards and should be punished for it. Regardless of killer or survivor DC'ing is admitting that you can't handle the game.
---
I have no problem with flashlight saves.  I avoid them 9 out of 10 times.
---
Pallet blinds, however, are toxic, and need to go away.
---
People who use NOED*
---
Just a meme, dude. Relax
---
Plague should be higher honestly

---
The Nea killer meme isn't funny anymore please stop.
---
Don't do that. Don't give me hope.
---
I feel sad that he lost a key but glad that he lost it because of his own actions.
---
Yep, people love to blame the killer when it's their teammates who need to get better.
---
Is there any particular type of perk build that goes well with him or is it just the standard M1 killer build of ruin, spirit fury, enduring and BBQ
---
That's the main problem, there's too many to think of without affecting meta or copying
---
Billy is very fast start because his mobility and his instadown. Nurse is fast because she ignores walls so if you are good they die in very short time. Spirit is similar to both and very fun.
---
Maybe a survivor main who just put a lot of points in Freddy ;)
---
I play on console as well, and I know we don't get the most competent survivos, but whenever I go against LF, I'm never worried because I just run to a loop, loop him for a bit, drop the pallet. Even if he breaks it with a chainsaw I still have time to get to another loop before he can get into chainsaw range again.
---
With pig I have to keep on my toes because she's completely silent, and it's quiet easy to get snuck up on and hit for free. Also I have to keep her lunge in mind at pallets because it's a tool she can mind game with
---
And don't get me started on the rng traps. Pig I feel is very underrated, she's not Spirit or Nurse level but she's not a pushover either. 
---
My experience and the experience I see through streams who do play with the best is that LF is just bad.
---
That's not how Fair Use works at all. Something can be free and still not be considered fair use - free isn't the requirement. Fair Use necessitates that you have a legitimate reason to be reusing the work in some way. Otherwise it's just property theft and/or a derivative work, whether or not you make money off of it.
---
To be considered Parody requires actually critiquing or otherwise mocking the work itself, not just recreating the work. Or damn near recreating the work in a way that could be considered deceptively similar (would confuse some random reasonable person that doesn't know much about the property).
---
Free is only a defense in that free things tend to not be worth going after. Being free isn't really relevant once you're in court.
---
Check man I'll touch base with her- thanks for the information!
---
The little pipe kills me
---
Okay fair enough, but nothing triggers survivors more than Franklins
---
The standard build works if you want consistent wins, but I like mixing in perks like Sloppy for hit-and-runs since Wraith is easy at getting first hits. You can apply mangled and they have to heal through it or risk getting downed fast later.
---
With super speed wraith, Make Your Choice can be very effective. Save The Best For Last and/or Play With Your Food are also decent for goofing around. 
---
Nurse's is a great ambush perk, but Whispers is the best tracking perk. 
---
My guilty pleasure build for goofing is BBQ, MYC, PGTW, and Surveillance or another perk of your choice. 
---
Hook someone, use BBQ to regress a gen and chase/down someone. When the other survivor gets unhooked, get a fast down on the MYC target. And repeat the process. Wraith with green or above Swift Hunt and Windstorm addons can make this engine work pretty well. If you lose momentum, you can suffer pretty hard, but the survivors really struggle to make progress when it works out.
---
Np man.
---
This is the shittest take I've heard in a while.
---
Pig's traps still act as a natural way of making the game longer, and it means at least one survivor isn't doing anything.
---
If anyone is F Tier, it's Leatherface.
---
I main killer. Spirit isn't nearly as op as Billy is. She has a weakness for every strength
---
Yea i know. Thought of the other definition of Counter.
---
Killers with NOED tend to camp the first down they get with it, almost without exception. In that case you can leave that person to die and take the probable 3-escape (a win), or you can still look for the totem before being altruistic. I genuinely can't think of a time as a survivor, swf or solo, that NOED secured the killer more than a single kill.
---
Same, I’ve had games where a object of obsession wasted the entire game trying to get my attention, I’d just chase them a bit every time and they’d run to a jungle gym and just wait there while I went and killed their friends. I knew I couldn’t get them unless I caught them majorly off guard. Got a 4K in the end . Takes a ton of skill to pull off object well against anything other than ghost face.
---
ah I see now guess I should have been more clear with the type of counter I was talking about
---
there's always a last place in a competition
---
Np man. I don’t think you can DM her there, I messaged her on instagram instead: oniksiya_sofinikum
---
This guys a troll btw. Fresh account with -70 Karma and 90% of his comments have negative karma. All his comments are just him complaining killers are OP and complaining.
---
This isn't a competition though. Tiers are things that stay consistent unless the killer is changed.
---
Many survivors complain about NOED because it’s an instadown perk. The only counter is to cleanse all the totems before the end game or cleanse the hex totem once it’s active.
---
Yep, 3-4k is pretty much expect in "normal" ranks, that's why I mainly play killer now
---
Yeah but don't complain about broken shit if u use broken shit
---
Bamboozle is a good perk, but I'd generally advise not using it if you want to learn how to run chases properly.
---
It’s not really a bug. You wait for exhaustion to tick down to the very end and, when you get too close for comfort, stop sprinting for that millisecond, start again, and then you’re off.
---
Well you’re just adding to it by acting like this
---
Freddy's is actually pretty awesome
---
Theoretically you are right, dead hard isnt that good of a perk. Especially of that dumb delay thats killing us sometimes, but it can be helpful with making the loop last longer - it can lead to 2 things, 1 - your teammates doing more gens, 2 - you have a slightly bigger chance of losing the killer. WGLF is in fact promoting altruism but its Very VERY V E R Y risky, taking a hit is something that can either help or make you dead, in the worst case scenario both of you will be dead and gg, 2 other people have less chances of surviving, points are points but in comparison to BBQ you are risking your life in not always needed situations.
---
Oh bummer, wonder why they changed it. Thanks.
---
I edited mine too.
---
lol, yes, I've heard of madness. This isn't bothering anyone Rank 10 and up.
---
I don’t really care much for the meta, But i do want to support diversity, Decrease toxic play (The survivor buffs are much stronger to combat hook camping for example) While giving killers more options such as the new deer stalker which would create a trap out of a downed survivor rather than tossing him/her on the hook. Kindred is made specifically for hook camping as the killer would have to pass a gen that could get obliterated because he refuses to leave, in addition to delaying his recovery on swings making unhook attempts more plausible
---
Idk man I'd rather have a pig than a leather face I've never had much trouble playing against her personally and since survivors are so hit or miss need I even say what happens with leather?
---
You can’t handle OP and I telling the truth?
---
You're a bitch.
---
Yes, he can go from side to side of the map rather fast IF there is an open route to do so (Some maps...not so much). 
---
It's an instadown that will only connect if you're not paying attention or get caught in a dead zone of the map, it's easy enough to juke.
---
There is a cooldown, a few seconds but still a cooldown and the drawback is once you start charging, if you want to cancel you need to wait at a slow speed for a few seconds allowing the survivor to gain some considerable distance.
---
Without 115MS Billy would be unplayable. He's already easily loopable as is.
---
Billy is probably the only well balanced killer in the game. Good power with drawbacks that also takes a degree of skill to hit consistently. Can have great map pressure. Can be built in a multitude of ways. Doesn't ignore any mechanics in the game. Has a traditional movement speed and can be looped like other killers.
---
I'm talking about the hits where you are away from the window and it still hits.
---
No.
---
I guess I'm not too good at conveying what I mean sorry. I was basically saying that pig is less scarry than LF when I play survivor
---
Ussyliss did a video on flashlights, i highly reccomend it if you want practice for flashlight saves.
---
Got it, omw to buy Bamboozle
---
Do you know if we're we getting Freddy rework before september as well
---
I've played a lot of solo and SWF. I've played loads of SWF on the DBD Discord, so I've seen and played with many different players. I've never seen or found Legion's mending or Doc's skill checks to be an issue for anyone. You shouldn't be healing against Legion, that's been the meta for a long time. Doc's skill checks suck at low ranks, but once you've played the game for a bit, they really aren't anything.
---
We're really just arguing semantics then. If that's how you define F rank, then who is F rank? Probably no killer fits that description. Probably how I'd rank them, this is my opinion as rank 1 survivor/killer with 1k+ hours on PC:
---
S: Nurse, Spirit
---
A: Billy
---
B: Huntress
---
C: Myers, Hag, Plague
---
D: Ghostface, Clown, Leatherface, Old-Freddy, Trapper
---
E: Wraith
---
F: Legion, Doctor, Pig
---
Can i see please.
---
But literally why would you use him when Billy exists.
---
I read that wrong as “YOU’RE TEARING ME APART USA”
---
I wouldn't be opposed tbh
---
I don't? I hear it all the time.
---
Also it's a hex. Just cleanse it for a million blood points
---
I didn’t know about this. I just knew that before this people were “cheating” SB the way i described, though very rarely.
---
Yeah i didn’t know about that. I just knew what i already said.
---
Because the entity bound them there with Flextape.
---
No, I would want them to be turned into addons that improve his base stats, like most other killers have. Not every killer needs to have myers/hag-addons that drastically change the playstyle. Examples being reduced passive sleep timers, reduced gen-projection channeling, etc.  
---
Time is never wasted if you spend it on something you enjoy doing. Pair that with "nothing lasts forever" and people should know how to deal with this situation. I know if huntress got changed that way I'd be pissed too, but I'd move on. You can't expect your favorite character in DBD to stay in their current version until the end of days, especially if it's a vastly controversial character. 
---
You're not wrong about the bugs, but honestly, freddy on the PTB seems to not have even a single bug (none that I know of). They really don't wanna be provoking the entity by putting the code back in that they just replaced with a brand new version of the character. As I said, it'd probably take ressources they could spend on things that have much more gain than this idea.
---
Should arrive with the mid-chapter update in July along with Bill for ps4. Most likely next tuesday or the tuesday after that.

I'm so glad they're gonna make looping harder it's so boring.
---
If that’s all you see then you truly are biased. There’s plenty of threads with survivor bias
---
Check- messaged her and got her tagged on my instagram post (@wyatt_gorehand) thanks my dude!
---
My advice if you're worried about your team is just get chased by him and waste his time, even people who can't loop can hold R1 on a gen. That's how I play against lf and it usually ends with 3-4 escaping
---
Sweeet
---
You can counter NOED by escaping. Shouldn't be that hard considering doors open fairly fast, are huge, and don't inform the killer which one you've opened.
---
Nope.
---
Legion can at least guarantee a first hit, and their power essentially keeps survivors injured all game.
---
Leatherface has a one hit down ability, and that's his only pro. He gets looped to hell, clever survivors will make it near impossible for him to get his chainsaw off unless they're in an area without loops.
---
Of course, you gotta understand that if the survivor team faces any form of adversity be it from a teammate disconnecting, a map or killer they don't like, lag, poor pallet spawns, a mori being in play, a perk they don't like, etc then you're a sweaty fun-hating asshole for not handing out escapes.
---
I try that but 5 minutes later and there's only one Gen done and it's "Doing gens you?" all over again
---
Can i get a link.
---
With that logic, shouldn't Hag be able to activate her own traps when she walks over them? It's just kind of weird that Trapper is the ONLY killer that can hurt himself. You can already sabotage his traps, or just avoid them. But that they also hurt him is just kinda silly. They are all in a different dimension with supernatural stuff going on. I'm sure that him being resistent to his own traps is the least weird thing going on.
---
That’s good to hear ^^
---
What about clown?
---
Omg lol this is the best
---
Until this bug is fixed we really need to stop closing the hatch, tbh.
---
You can't even write accept properly kid, maybe go learn to shave your first 3 moustachehairs before thinking you know what balance is.
---
1 We need to cleanse those totems even if the killer doesn't run NOED making it strong as shit because cleansing totems takes time. 
---
2 We don't know if our teammates did any totems so even if we did 4 of them there still could be 1 hidden somewhere, only against noobkillers like you probably is this something you have time to do.
---
3 It's way too fucking strong giving both speed AND instadowns, rewards bad play, rewards campers.
---
There you go buddy some arguments against the same ol "just do totems" moronic arguments. Have fun explaining why all this is balanced, protip: you can't.
---
Is there some way to track deleted comments? What's to stop you from just deleting the post? Sure the person that posted it might come back at some point and say "hey you deleted my post!" but what proof do they have?
---
It does have a counter...just learn the timing.
---
All three of em. Lightborn 1 2 and 3.
---
Ez.
---
It's funny because you can literally tell who is a new player : people complaining about survivors nerfs.ecause a year and a half ago, it was the complete opposite, and the new players have no idea how strong survivors were and how many nerfs killers got.
---
They are saying the killer should leave because a survivor has shit ping, instead of the survivor who has shit ping leaving. Are you?
---
In my opinion, of the top three the only one who warrants nerfs is Nurse. I’m all about her having chase control flow and being able to provide a strong threat level but anything beyond two blinks is really overkill once you know how to play her. Spirit is strong, has counters but the only thing I’d say for her is have collision removed while phasing so people can juke her properly. Even Iron Will and Spine Chill can’t stop you having a physical hitbox and if you mindgame her right and she just nudges you, you’re boned. 
---
Hillbilly is just boring. Not OP, just nothing interesting to say about him. His addons are boring and that’s about it. 
---
Lastly, let me reiterate: I don’t want every killer to become a hyper nurse. The ones who are picked less are mostly due to their kits being inherently weak or just annoying to function. Like why would I ever actively play Trapper when I have to navigate the map to pick up my power, step in my own traps or risk having them sabotaged and unusable when I could pick anyone else? IF I just wanted to M1 people I’d keep playing Myers.
---
Ghostface is most definitely not F tier, mate.
---
You knw for someone complaining about sensitivity, you seem real sensitive about it
---
Nothing feels better than 5 tokens on Autodidact. Prove me wrong.
---
Okay but that has nothing to do with LF as a killer. If you get a shit team, you get a shit team. That has nothing to do with the viability of the killer you're going against 
---
Like I said, any killer is scary in that situation, not just LF.
---
What *is* toxic is unnecessary flashlights, like when they're doing the ol' "teabag at the exit gate" and then pull out a fucking flashlight while you're just standing there, being sad.
---
I expected a word/hotfix yesterday, as that would've left enough time for them to make changes/fixes until next tuesday, if need be. Now we may get some tomorrow, but if that one introduces new bugs we'll probably get those into the live version next week. Unless they decide to release him on the 30th.
---
I love your art! So amazing.
---
He never was F tier, LF is. 
---
Freddy was not that bad, I'll always advocate that. People genuinely didn't want to learn how to use him. Sure he wasn't very fun, but he wasn't a very bad killer.
---
I used to play Doc constantly on purple ranks and trust me, some people on lower rank did a much greater job at fucking me over. In purple ranks I managed to get 4k on Coldwind. ON COLDWIND! AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY DECENT SURVIVORS!
---
The fact that I was doing well with Doc with not OP addons (the one that extends terror radius in treatment mode + doc illusions on madness2) means two things. Either he's a god in one-trick's  hands, or he's not F tier.
---
For Cordis Die.
---
My personal reasoning is Billy can only hit 1 at a time and Bubba can hit all 4, which is fun especially when multiple people try to do a basement save. And Bubba is easier to steer. Not saying he's in any way better than Billy, but that doesn't mean he's obsolete because Billy exsist
---
Eh, same.. I slug or chase after the rescuer because I use MYC on Pig a lot so it's a free hook when you get MYC off. When I used to grab people right off hook (when I was new to the game) I get DS or they just leave so xd
---
IDC about rank either honestly just trynna get that BP because the grind in this game is REAL.
---
Thanks 🥰
---
I always play legion to rank up...idk I find it easier.
---
I usually stick to purple/green on purpose but then when I decide to grind to rank 1 it's basically legion only
---
The 7 seconds argument is so dumb. 
---
Add ons that made the time slower was not even his best. Class Photo was that juicy stuff, range too.
---
Posts like this remind me of why I unsubbed from this subreddit.
---
I said you can make an argument for it since its really easy to break him out of stealth
---
Ok, Adrenaline is annoying. Now you can go back playing nurse with 5 blinks noed,ruin bbq and ebony mori.
---
She probably got mad cos her team was gonna troll and flashlight spam the killer but they had Franklin's demise x'D
---
Roll tide
---
That one trick pony? That’s why I can loop Leatherfaces better than any other killer because they’re so predictable. They always respect pallets so I just keep running.
---
I'm a survivor main and I think your post is ridiculous. "AnY gOoD KiLlEr PeRk sHoUlD nOt bE UsEd!"
---
I’ll explain quickly why he was atleast decent:
---
firstly, he finds people very easily
---
With invisibility and a small terror radius, the first find is easy af
---
Freddy consistently phases in and out during the Dream Transition, meaning when mastered, you can learn exactly when you're invis to pull a free hit at the start of a chase
---
When asleep, you can't do shit to progress the game
---
The only way to wake up is to regress the game
---
Either because you're blowing up a gen or because you're finding a teammate, telling Freddy where 2 people are (ofcourse you can use selfcare to counter it too, but it takes ages)
---
If he leaves you when you're injured, he can just go back to you when you're in an unsafe area and down you instantly since he knows where you are at all times
---
Heres an advanced guide incase you’re more interested, im by no means a freddy main so this is more reliable information https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1628612661&amp;searchtext=Freddy
---
It's been explained a few times in these comments already.
---
Finally, someone who's enlightened.
---
Which killers consistently land hits in seven seconds? Nurse, and that it. Sure, a lot of killers can situationally land hits in seven seconds, but it isn't consistent. Freddy lands hits within 8 seconds with transition mind games. Most killers can only do that occasionally.
---
50% action speed penalty does nothing? Okay then. It is easy to wake up, but it is also easy to resleep them. Plus they will not ALWAYS instawake up. 20 seconds working on a gen and waking up? They did all that for 2 seconds of progress. 40 seconds? Twelve seconds of progress. If they do wake within 10 seconds? They LOSE progress. So Freddy has insane stall. Plus the auras allow him to leave and come back as he wants. 
---
He wasn't about chases, but winning through a war of attrition. One that he can very much win. He wasn't top tier, but he wasn't bad.
---
Yes, and that makes him *balanced*
---
A good Ghostface will be able to creep up on survivors, and down them before they notice him.
---
Welp, at least I got that stupid self-unhook achievement already, I dont feel as robbed but I basically got Adam with shards just for that.
---
Also, that damn pebble is NEVER going to be unlocked as a teachable.
---
Thanks for proving your point and instead of being nice and calm you decided to go off on one, proving you can't accept an opinion without getting salty. Enjoy your future games.
---
Yeah, I agree
---
Hillbilly's chainsaws sometimes just fuck up and don't actually hit some one but go through the attack animation anyways. If you've heard some one talk about a fake chainsaw, that would be it.
---
The gameplay shown before looked pretty promising, and I know a lot of Switch players who're interested in buying it.
---
Until they fix Cowshed and Macmillian Tower, you better bet your biscuits I’m cutting that boring loop off.
---
oh i see your flair is Pig so How's with that nerf that came awhile back; i used to play her alot till i heard the traps won't activate if you put it on a survivor during endgame collapse
---
Nope. Hasn’t been changed in any way afaik.
---
You ever see something that didn't happen to you personally but you feel the pain like it did?
---
Cuz this
---
Try and do totems against a nurse or billy who is just putting on high pressure the entire game. You won’t get gens done against good killers when you’re a solo survivor doing totems by yourself.

Once you find one or two it can be pretty easy to predict where the others are on the map, it really isn't that hard to find totems, even the ones that are hidden really well are always in those spots and with enough playtime, you'll anticipate their location, there aren't too many super good totem places so you'll learn them quickly if you just look for totems every game. Its 5 piles of bones that you hold M1 on for like 15 seconds, if you're really having that tough of a time finding totems run small game. 
---
Yeah, you aren't doing gens or distracting the killer, but that's the point of NOED, it's completely preventable by spending time, but not always anticipated until its too late.
---
*Intense Il Vento D’Oro*
---
Nothing feels worst than playing ambulance all game and getting only 3 skillchecks
---
Ha that’s true
---
honestly i'd be down if Steve is a survivor and the map is a underground MineShaft
---
P3 Claudettes don't have souls
---
Well, I going to fucking mori you.
---
Actually I play on console so nurse is useless. I'm a legion trapper main, never run bbq, mori, or noed
---
So.... double standard? I mean, if I see a survivor get unhooked right in front of me I'm expected to purposefully not target the injured and easily killed one and instead chase the rescuer?
---
Well.
---
Imagine being a supreme eldritch god of hope and suffering using powerful beings from all ages to to play games of cat and mouse with survivors from every point in space time and one of them has the audacity to tell you that your sacrificial hooks that feed you are too op.
---
That's a giga SMH
---
It's not really when there are angles where they can see you and you can't see them even if you duck into cover you'll still be broken out
---
Yeah but spirit is more reliable because she works great on almost every map. If you get lerys as a billy be ready to have a bad time
---
Lucky, I had to buy Adam. Deliverance can come in clutch some few times but I got it mostly to do the achievements.
---
I personally recommend you to consider combining dead hard with deliverance, it could very well save you from a basement shitfest.
---
“Counter noed by not getting hit” 
---
Hahahaha holy shit mate I can’t believe you said that on a public forum
---
A guaranteed Kobe if you unhook safely. Pair this with DS and you’ve got a solid escape build. 
---
My best moment with it was a LF who struggled to get anyone, he hooked one person besides me when the gens were done so I save them, had Deliver-Strike ready and just jumped off the hook, got hit, used DS and strolled to the nearby exit. 
---
Or pair it with Breakdown and Saboteur. If you’re good at looping, just jump off the hook, break the hook and keep running.
---
I thought he meant having 4 at the same time.
---
Are you joking? Spirit is comfortably ahead of Billy. A good Spirit doesn't have to play the looping game like Billy has to. Give her her purples and she's comfortably well ahead of Billy.
---
Chainsaw, conditions permitting, doesn't compare to "Actually we're just not playing this loop now."
---
I main killer. Your mori has no power here
---
Joey's is real bad. The cooldown add ons even if stacked don't reduce the fatigue by even a second.
---
I didn't even notice a difference she's still really good. I mostly use them on the trickier survivors or ones with repair boxes to slow them down. My problem is forgetting how many times I hooked someone while putting a trap on them then hooking them and having the entity take them like oops that was a waste lol
---
Her response is the best part
---
I was playing during the Lunar New Years event with the flashlight change. Still feel compelled to run FD whenever I see a flashlight.
---
this hurst me personally, dont make mikey cry
---
It honestly isn't that simple IMO. Just to clarify I've never had a problem with NOED, I like the dread and fear it induces the moment all gens get completed and it hasn't been revealed yet.
---
Cleansing all the totems? Unless you are running Small Game or are a coordinated SWF, thats extremely rare. There's always ONE totem hidden somewhere obscure that someone failed to find. You can't trust your team to always have all totems cleansed before end game, if im solo (which is almost always) theres no way for me to keep track of the totem count, and im not spending the entire game i could be doing gens just to make sure noed will not come into play, if the killer is EVEN running the perk, if he isnt I probably already lost my team the game.
---
I dont really mind it doesn't requiere any skill, most perks don't, but there's a lot of better ways to avoid a match going to shit than wasting precious time searching for all the totems. IMO, its rare that more than 1 player dies by noed if they are any good, if he downs all of the team, then its your goddamn fault, you failed to respect the threat of the killer.
---
I've often found that its better NOT to do dull totems, increases your chances that noed with spawn in a easy to find totem, like next to gens or in the open. If I go out of my way to find them all, chances increase that noed will spawn in that ONE totem i failed to see in the corner of the map, out of the way of everything and now theres no time to go looking for it without putting myself at risk or the EGC ending.
---
mine was "Why the fuck do you only boobytrap the basement, use your traps in other spots" in caps and stuff ya know
---
Not if they're halfway decent at survivor.
---
not the worst choice, Im in
---
i feel that is Make your choice, and Bbq &amp; Chili a decent combo on her?
---
I'm always in a two stack so i never thought about it this way. Thanks for being kind with feedback 😊
---
Ah good to know. I played pig briefly but could have sworn there were addons that did that but looking back it was an addon that just made it take longer to search. Pig is annoying but a tunneling pig is even more annoying :(
---
Legion is nowhere near Billy. His power is worse in every way.
---
Alright, you win this argument.
---
Ok man we get it. Survivors are entitled and toxic, can we not post this kinda shit 12 times a day.
---
i like the mori idea for trapper using his traps for a mori
---
I have a counterquestion. Why would you use anybody when Nurse exists?
---
And clever survivors will make it really hard for Legion to use his power on multiple people at once, and will even completely cancel it with lockers jukes or exhaustion perks if he's greedy about hitting multiple people. Games with him will always be average, as in he can't really overperform or have a stroke of luck because he's basically only a M1 killer.  
---
LF can capitalize easily on mistakes and then put a lot of pressure very quickly, guarantees a kill at the end of the game or when someone is in the basement in some situations. Of course he's really bad, but I think he's stronger than Legion just because of the instadown. Survivors really tend to be greedy against him in my experience
---
DS is less a reward for bad play and more an anti-tunneling perk. It isn’t “I got hit twice and downed, so now I get a free escape anyway”, anymore, and more “CLAUDETTE, YOU CUNT, HE WAS RIGHT THERE AND YOU UNHOOKED ME! I’M NOT GETTING FARMED TODAY.” perk. Not a great practice, but also not one that’s a reward for bad play.
---
To avoid BBQ and Chili and other hook related perks while also depriving killer of blood points, dailies, and satisfaction.
---
People do mean things to random strangers they can't see face to face
---
&gt;1 We need to cleanse those totems even if the killer doesn't run NOED making it strong as shit because cleansing totems takes time. 
---
there is a Time Limit for survivors? wow thats new
---
I disagree about you saying F tier, D tier yes but map wide wallhacks shouldn’t be underestimated. The only problem was the power didn’t help in a chase but it still did something really good, finding survivors even after they got away and you can never get a skillcheck that reliably
---
I would agree with you if this was any other sub. I only first started seeing Ghost Face abbreviated as “GF” in this sub.
---
Just imitating the way survivors argue.
---
Lmao you can give your opinion without being a complete fucking asshole, you know. It explains your karma count though.
---
Put a totem count on small game. Like I always say, in a solo game with zero communication,  nobody is gonna stop doing that last gen and go around the map counting broken totems.
---
did you really downvote him because you didnt get the meme
---
Now F-tier will just have a better killer in it. 
---
Think of it like this, you have numbers 12345, what’s the lowest number? 1. Now take the one out so you only have 2345, it’s not like the lowest number no longer exists, now it’s just 2 since that’s the current lowest number.
---
The worst killer currently (IMO leatherface) will be the new F-tier
---
Negativity bias
---
I think some people underestimate how hard getting a wig to look good is
---
I have legion but I'm not very good with him, he doesn't really have an answer to pallets and vaults outside of frenzy but if I'm trying to put a survivor in the dying state then that's a problem
---
Good ol' times when my eyes burned at every flashlight blind.

r/cursedcomments
---
BHVR said the 23rd.
---
Forget hydrated Gannon, we going for moistened Quinton now.
---
So I'm trolling because I have a different opinion ok buddy.
---
But that wouldn’t give players any more diversity and create more interactivity with builds..? Those perks work well in a wide variety of situations, I just brought up campers since it would be particularly effective again it
---
Thanks man :)
---
Ehh i feel like it reduces just long enough so you can hit someone, find the others using Feral, and then follow the last guy closely to keep the distance short.
---
Before rank reset, people are at ranks between 20-1. Immediately after rank reset, everyone is ranks 20-10. The distance between ranks shrinks, meaning that the game is more likely to pair up people it wouldn’t have previously. 
---
Pre-reset, a rank one and a rank ten
---
Beyond the top picks, tier lists are never definite, because different players will excel with different playstyles.

It would bring more diversity, but I know for a fact that the devs are trying to limit aura reading and survivors second chances.
---
They already took away a ton of pallets, added bloodlust to counter infinites, then got rid of infinites and still kept bloodlust in the game. They added more hooks, and made fast vaulting nearly impossible at many windows (not to mention you can be hit even if you’re 10 feet on the other side of the window). They nerfed toolboxes and sabotaging, nerfed heal times, and nerfed pallets so killers get more hits through them. They also nerfed all exhaustion perks. Every new killer is either the speed of light or invisible in their power, or they can 1 hit survivors. I’m not saying that many of those weren’t needed changes, but non-rank 1 survivors escape 35% of the time now. The few seconds a game of a flashlight blind are too much now too? Killers in this game won’t be happy until there’s an offering where all survivors spawn on hooks, and ebony moris are built in.
---
A while back flashlight saves were pretty easy to pull off. At least now it takes a good amount of luck and skill to pull off.
---
You can have your own opinion. To me Legion and Billy were the same tier while Spirit and Nurse were a cut above the rest.
---
I kinda agree with some of these survivor "rules" since I like to play fair and I play survivor and killer. Like if someone farms their teammate in front of me I will chase the person who did the save instead of the unhooked person because it's not their fault they got unhooked right in front of you. And I hate Noed with a passion like I cleanse totems I come across but I'm not always sure if all 5 are cleaned because I play solo survivor. But also I hate camping I understand if the exit gates are open, but I had a clown camp me in the basement with only 1 gen done and they dc when my team got all the gens done and teabagged them.
---
They let you drop survivors for a reason... 
---
The second the blindness starts, just instantly drop them and then act accordingly. The flashlight was put in the game for a solid reason, not like it's a hack or anything
---
Honestly LF is one of the killers I main out of like 3-4. I'd say the only 2 reasons I don't play billy instead is because A: I suck at steering the chainsaw when people are juking me and B: Billy is super popular and I guess I'm a DBD hipster
---
Huh... Reminds me of someone certain in LoL, who would be OP if not for bugs...
---
People seem to forget he excels at tracking. He is not F tier for that simple reason. At least C, and IF his bugs are fixed, he'd be hovering in high-mid A (or B for those who picked doc and have no idea how to play him properly).
---
Those spots always suck for baby nurse. You run slower than the survivors so you can never catch up, but that small blink distance is easy to fuck up and it puts you in a state of exhaustion that gives them time to continue looping you
---
Yeah if you are running those loops I fully agree, bamboozle is great. I'd never complain about that situation. If you are running bamboozle for those specific structures, I don't have anything against you.
---
Most of the time I see people use bamboozle they use it on tiles like shack or jungle gyms, tiles that do not require this type of treatment at all as they are completely mindgameable and allow for tons of skill expression (and imo they are the most fun part of chases).
---
Some people get so brainless with it that they even vault L and T walls instead of learning how to run them properly.
---
When they eventually fix windows like Coaltower or Grim pantry one, I hope they'll change bamboozle to no longer block windows &amp; to just let you vault windows super fast, faster than it currently does.
---
I agree. I love her bitchslap at the end. She looks so haughty and I love it.
---
&gt; because different players will excel with different playstyles.
---
That argument is flawed and its easy to see why. I am personally better at the Pig than Spirit, because i suck at spirit. This doesn't change the fact that top Spirits &gt; top Pigs.
---
When a top lol or overwatch player release a tier list that says that X champion &gt; Y champion, if a random newbie says " well i'm better at Y champion", that doesn't change anything.
---
To be fair they also said no clown killers either and look what happened
---
You’re talking about something unrelated to the new perk interactions lol
---
I'm not a trader so I've always just assumed your "rep" was what people saw going to your profile and looking through the comments. So do these website have some sort of real-time tracking of every steam profile to keep count of +rep/-reps?
---
Ah. Thats tricky then. Not to mention new bonus effects take up ideas that could otherwise go towards new perks considering they cant have the clone perk do something an existing perk already does
---
Did you read the rest of my statement, or did you just focus on that part?
---
Agree, specially now that they are harder to pull and when flashlights are not "insta blind"
---
DS does reward bad play; not being able to loop for 60 seconds being one of the biggest examples.
---
But you also gave an example - unhooking in front of the killer is a bad play that DS rewards.
---
If someone uses DS against me when I'm not actually tunneling them (unhooked in my face, or if I find them again healing) then it actually makes me want to tunnel them.
---
Also: Noed doesn't reward bad play any more than Ruin rewards play, both are symptoms of how fast generators get done regardless of how you do.
---
Additionally similar perks can’t have the same/similar bonus’s, They have to be distinct
---
That literally only works if the survivor is dumb lol, if they’re not then congrats you just extended the loop
---
Has anyone noticed if they still get the escape points after this? It's happened to me once and my total score was around 23000 BP. I rarely play survivor, and the only time I get that many points is when I escape.
---
About the killer perk whispers will it light up/activate if there is a survivor within the radius downed or on a hook?
---
Your point is that tier lists aren't reliable because player can be better at weaker killer due to their own play styles.
---
My point is that does not matter. tier lists are based on the top players. You don't compare nurse and pig based on a weak nurse player and a top pig player. You compare top nurse and top pig players when doing a tier list.
---
When this happens, jump into the void. You will respawn in the middle of the map, than you try to find the exit again or the hatch
---
But it's completely different with killers such as the Tripper, the Phantom, and the Redneck. With memorable survivors such as Dwayne, Jack, Claudia, and Maggie
---
Not really, no.
---
Reread my comment again
---
"Beyond the top picks"
---
That's when you just tunnel and let everyone else escape
---
That build works well with him 
---
I like running BBQ, Ruin, Sloppy, and either STBFL or Bamboozle
---
Outside of adding new aura reading, or survivor second chances, what else would be worth it to actually run and not be overpowered? Because every idea I can come up with is either not worth it, overrides an existing perk, or is op
---
I never heard them say that only no pennywise but I highly doubt they'll suddenly change the premise from killers to monsters they specifically said they have to had been human to start with too.
---
Install DBD texture pack bam problem solved
---
I post a short English translation and got removed because it’s not “only contains URL
---
Yeah, some people think this is a "nerf" thread. That's the last thing I want, she's got a place of power and it'd be better if she that that something more or just more control over herself, and as you said it'd open up the skill floor/ceiling. It feels like it'd be difficult to make changes that people would be happy with, but the more enjoyable the game is overall, the better it is for everyone.
---
Yes
---
And I’m saying sometimes the killer can see the shot ping and the survivor can’t but of course like Always people would feather blame another party than take some responsibility. 
---
As a killer who sees shit pings i leave and wait for lower pings, so fucking what if you have to wait for a game? And as a survivor I also leave if the ping is shit
---
Maybe?
---
Maybe it’s just not your strong suit?
---
Gotta agree as Im not a great killer, even playing as one makes me so anxious I can't enjoy it as much I would like, so yeah, NOED helps alleviate that. I feel that if this were any other game other than DBD, noed would probably be deleted or reworked, the concept lacks tangible counterplay, as in easy to understand and execute. But oddly enough, the perk fits well with the atmosphere and gameplay of DBD. Those seconds of silence after the gate's powered and you don't know if noed will severely alter the way the match is gonna go from now is just so exciting, the main problem is that some poor bastard will probably not find it as enjoyable as I do, as they are mid chase as the last gen pops and dies by no "real fault" of their own.
---
I don't feel like it's a big deal except that it's just pointless. If there was some sort of reward for being at high rank, then maybe it would have use. But without rewards, what's the point of a reset?
---
&gt; I want to get the first 5 killers to 40, then I'll start adding DLC
---
I appreciate that this is your goal, however if you buy Leatherface *now* and take him to L35, his BBQ &amp; Chilli perk will unlock as a Teachable - once you buy it in his Bloodweb it'll have a chance to appear in the Bloodweb of any other killer from that point on.
---
BBQ &amp; Chilli gives a 25% bonus to Bloodpoints per hook, up to a maximum of 100% at Tier III. It also highlights all survivors more than 40m from your hook.
---
In short, it's not only a useful tracking perk, but also a perk without equal for massively increasing your Bloodpoint gain - which will significantly increase the speed at which you'll take everyone to 50.
---
&gt; How do I signal to take the door?
---
Open the gate, and then attack the gate repeatedly with your regular attack - survivors have a healthy distrust of killers, so sometimes you really need to spell it out by deliberately spamming attacks or outright just nodding and turning your back on them so that they feel a lot safer walking past (there's no shortage of instadowns that can be used to drop survivors *juuuust* as they believe they're safe).
---
*Modern problems require modern solutions*
---
Just cause you aren’t good with a killer doesn’t mean others aren’t.
---
Cause GF is def not a D rank, he’s at least A. 
---
But you are so full of yourself since your a rank 1 you probably think only killers you are good with are good. 
---
And on console nurse is basically F rank, so it varies between platforms and players. It’s not as simple as just having a “tier list”
---
;)
---
Freddy is still F teir but just move the whole teir up
---
Yikes, someone can't play to well.
---
Sexy pig
---
The leather pig outfit has special sounds and animations for her weapon, that’s the ONLY reason I can imagine as to why.
---
Endgame perks should be strong for survivors, and that’s if you make it to endgame. Otherwise it’s a wasted slot.
---
Unfortunately with how the devs have been treating survivors the past year I do see foresee an Adrenaline nerf, if only because it’s popular.
---
I have a bad feeling about Exhaustion perks in general.
---
NOED is annoying, and I dislike the “just cleanse totems” argument as a solo player. I can’t be wasting time running around to make sure all totems have been accounted for, and I can’t rely on teammates to be cleansing either. Perhaps if there was an indicator to tell us how many totems are left on the map.
---
I remember SC being a major point of contention for killers, SB and DS, now Adrenaline. Which is funny because it’s not even a new perk, it has just been getting more usage lately as BHVR keeps nerfing perks  and the survivor meta changes.
---
As a side-note, I would say the survivor meta is actually more diverse than killer.
---
Yeah, youre right, but if the lobby maker has 3 people at 60 ping and 1 at 200, should he cancel the lobby or should the 200 guy leave?
---
Leatherface and Plague would like to know your location.
---
I am not a tier list creator or a top player, therefore yes "doctor &gt; freddy" is my opinion. But when all the top players agree together than X killer is better than Y Killer, its just silly to disagree with all of them.
---
His tracking is unreliable and very situational. 
---
Clown would never be in A tier because he doesn't have any map pressure, at best he can be C tier without bugs.
---
Freakin dope!
---
That's when you just ignore them and play a 3v1.
---
Bro, I watched that as soon as it came out.
---
It’s me 😂
---
I propose a x% decrease in sacrifice time when killer is within x metres
---
I love it
---
No, because it's still an opinion, especially since "top X player" is a subjective opinion.
---
M
---
That's still fine for the killer as that means there are 3 people not working on generators.
---
That is so cool
---
Thank you! 👌
---
You literally never see any killer except Nurse, Spirit or Billy at red ranks.
---
I find it more fun to just tunnel and mess with them till they either DC or kill themselvs on hook.
---
Yup. Mainly what rep is for is for others to use to determine whether or not it's a good idea to try trading with them.
---
I want a buf for doc
---
Other weapon has animations too.
---
Yeah, it’s what sold me on that one. The “vrrrrh” of it spinning + the fact it spins is awesome.
---
I see a lot of Huntress, Hag, Ghostface and Plague too.
---
Her add ons are mostly garbage. When I play pig, I just use her for the stealth. Ambush is decent at loops sometimes. That's about it.
---
Does it?
---
Pretty sure it doesn’t notify her
---
I saw Freddy 4king on Coldwind Farm. I think I saw any or almost any killer 4king on these maps. 
---
That doesn't mean anything.
---
Lol sure bud. “OMG pressing m1 so much skill.” Get out.
---
I usually wait to make sure my team makes it out.
---
Since the new pig cosmetics got released, can anyone provide me an image of the "pig leather" costume but using the "second chance" head, from her other cosmetic set?
---
omg... This happens way too much right now
---
Oh happy day
---
Let me guess you also think the earth is flat and climate change is a hoax and disagreeing with you is just an opinion? i'm done arguing with you lol
---
I didn't say Billy was easily loopable. LF is easily loopable, Billy is just loopable unless you get caught well out of position. Which he can do! Especially early game when people are still just making their way to gens. But Spirit has a universal get out of jail free card.
---
Spirit can "mindgame" by just standing still. The only safe response to Spirit standing at a loop is to just abandon the loop because it's so fundamentally in her favor. Billy's king of map pressure, sure, but Spirit's got just fine map pressure and is second only to Nurse at ending chases regardless of map conditions.
---
Unless the entire survivor team is bringing Iron Will and you're on like Lery's or The Game, keeping pace with people while in the ghost dimension as Spirit just isn't that hard. You should already be learning to listen for survivor noises anyhow.
---
This is why people need to play both killer / survivor. imagine being in a real situation where the killer is about to get you, and you turn around to complain at them that they are killing wrong. I don't think it works that way.
---
Oh. Yeah, I knew about Haddonfield rework. Not exactly "looping" in general, but maybe someday other maps gonna be touched, too. No so long ago was looped on Meat Plant and found out that chase ended and restarted while I did the circles running after survivor as Mayers, marking that place as infinite loop. Was surprised that it's still there. And it seems that survivors was well aware of that place because they kept running the same place T_T
---
In that case even Freddy was F tier, because Freddy could also win games.
---
"Welcome to Minecraft!"
---
Why are people acting like you shouldn’t be hit through windows? The killer has arms, they can go through windows lol
---
I went in on a killer yesterday it was fun.. haha I'm on ps4
---
That would be kind of funny to be honest, probably made the games way too easy if it was like that back then. Probably had to construct some sort of machinery to get the gates to pry open like some sort of pulley system to get the doors to actually function.
---
Go onto console and max your movement sensitivity then imagine that 2-4x faster that’s how it can be on pc for lots of games. I used to play TF2 with a friend and his sensitivity was insane so he can land the dirty snipes.
---
Isn't it kinda scary that these are the same people that have the power to vote?      ....... Yikes
---
They needed to make 1 of 4 licensed cosmetics 88 cells more than the 1100 cell pack ‘because of licensing stuff’?
---
Come on now...
---
Options are to buy the 1100 and 500, or the 2250,  it’s pretty scummy.
---
it does.
---
Ah so YOU'RE one of the people that keep him borderline B. Do me a favor and change that Leatherface rating to 2 stars. Heheheh...
---
&gt;"I'm done arguing with you"
---
&gt;Continues to hammer home his dumbass point
---
&gt;Misinterprets my original point yet again
---
You're kind of a moron, aren't you?
---
Ahhh, right you are. I think of proxy camping as a killer just wandering around patrolling just out of range of the hook ready to zip back as soon as the unhook occurs... but it could definitely apply to Hag as well.
---
Very few things more frustrating as a survivor than this.
---
That's exactly why I didn't enjoy her, whole stealth aspect was cool but I did not use it nearly enough to justify playing her, only really used her for the helmets
---
Platform? I'm on PC.
---
BT: I personally think its not needed if you know how to do safe saves.
---
Self care: As you said its probably better to bring a good med kit and get healed by allies when possible
---
Personally i actually prefer Iron Will to these perks
---
I just want my progression to sync. But if it doesnt I'm still gonna play it at work on my switch
---
Deliverance is so fucking bad I don't know why anyone runs it, you should run unbreakable or borrowed time or adrenaline. 
---
Reality is we just need more perkslots or borrowed time and DS need to be built-in perks because why do we need to waste 2 perks just to counter moronic braindead camperkillers.
---
Behavior knows they can tax the shit out of r/oinkers for these outfits, and I'm going to buy them as soon as I get home so they're totally right.
---
In that case I'm bugged.
---
Still new to game is wraith really the weakest killer? I thought the guy with 1 beartrap was pretty weak and felt wraith and hag were super strong but that’s coming from a new guy who’s only played a week.
---
Yeah, that's the way to go, IMO. A lot of times if you just go around the pallet they won't bother to loop around that spot and head off in search of another (especially if you manage to hit them) and you can take a second to break it while they're fleeing if you so choose.
---
Double Shadow Dance Bamboozle Fire Up Wraith is such a guilty pleasure for me that I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of, so I hope when tiles are more properly fixed, I could care less about it blocking the window, I agree.
---
Imagine being this dumb lmfao
---
thanks for the laughs xD
---
All sites I've checked takes like a day or two to update it. Will check more sources next time.
---
The same thing happened to me when I got a 4K with leatherface lmfao

Lol just told another guy... y'all take this way too seriously. I get pallet blinded as a killer and don't care one lick. Hell, I get a chuckle out of it sometimes when they don't know how to do it and wound up getting whacked anyway.
---
&gt;common decency
---
I wouldn't call expecting your opponents to gimp themselves and purposely ignore survivors in specific scenarios common decency.
---
Even having one friend with you are gonna help a great deal.
---
Is that why you people post your complaints in a funny picture so if I say something about it you can go "bruh it's just a funny picture" no it's not and most people agreeing with it are serious about it and many people will now play like douchebags because of that video.
---
MY NEW PUPPY PEED ALL OVER HIS BRAND NEW BED THAT HE HAD FOR LESS THAN 2 HOURS. I KNOW ITS NOT DBD RELATED BUT I'M STILL MAD ABOUT IT.
---
I had three rituals, just completed one, didn’t get a new one, so... 
---
And no, I didn’t delete one. So technically, I should’ve gotten a new one. Maybe it’s timed. I don’t know.
---
Aw, I love it so much!
---
This pleases the community.
---
I'm sorry i just think the joke is overdone. There's just alot more things that you can joke about in this game but i always see people saying Nea is a killer.
---
Wraith is weak because with a Bit of awareness, you can spot him before he gets a Chance to even sneak up and uncloak.
---
The Trapper has 5 Traps :D, but is also pretty weak.
---
Hat however is really strong
---
Only time I get mad is when I dc from the host five times in a row trying to get into a match
---
This has been posted before but yeah: holy crap it's so illegal. The Trapper is called Jason. *Fucking Jason.* How is this shit still on the Apple Store?
---
I haven't been on this sub that long. If it wasn't reposted, I wouldn't have seen this fine meme
---
Small game? Nah; com-plain!
---
It’s all fun and games until the bubbas learn the range and insidious you just outside of it
---
Fuck that.
---
The cop one for sure!!!!!
---
hate to tell you but this was on the subreddit a few days ago.  that twitter guy just stole it.  A good laugh anyways
---
Yes, I can see it now that I’ve checked. No special sound and the animation isn’t fancy, it jitters up and down as though it were a saw. Cool, but not super special like the other one
---
Mom said it's my turn to repost this image
---
well its from one of my [screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/fgFQLZY)
---
If you want a good killer, spirit is by far the best and imo the most fun to play as.
---
He was asking about ways to help him escape after gens are done dingus. Read before you go off about muh BT mub DS.
---
Hmm.  I just wish that it had been tweaked the tiniest bit.  I understand, tiny one.
---
Welcome to the sub btw :D
---
&gt; solo players have a tendency to just die on first hook.
---
This is true and so annoying. Idk why they do that. Should almost be bannable its as bad as intentionnal DC.
---
Survivors rule book (pocket ed.), page 5, paragraph 3, line 4: 
---
“Tunnelling is defined as: whenever the killer chases a survivor for more than two seconds over the duration of a game.”
---
Survivors commonly DC when they figure out ruin is active, I’m not defending the post but this comment is super wrong
---
I'm going to list everything that, in my opinion, feels unbalanced or anything of the sort in this comment.
---
- Dead hard is build to be able to avoid damage, and since it's a one time use in chase, it should still work on bear traps 
---
- While yes, iridescent head is powerful, especially with 3 of them, they're just as dodgable as a normal hatchet
---
- Your change to Adrenaline makes it a bad Unbreakable instead of adrenaline 
---
- Balanced landing would no longer be a viable exhaustion perk compared to the others after that change 
---
- Borrowed time is built to counter camping. Making it only be able to counter camping twice rewards killers for camping survivors, because survivors cant do anything about it after one person is dead 
---
- Botany already is what you're adding to Empathy. The only thing that truly needs changed is Empathys range if anything 
---
- I'd have to see the sprint burst change to see if it would still be a good perk at all 
---
- Enduring doesnt work on DS for a reason 
---
- Haunted Grounds is no longer a random chance, and is just a "hey, screw you for finding a totem". Totem spawns should be reworked, not punishing survivors for playing the game 
---
- For huntress lullaby, a hex effect should not stay when the hex is destroyed. That ruins the point of a hex
---
- Remember me was nerfed to make it possible for survivors who had the hatch shut on them. Reverting it back breaks that again
---
- Thank you for the Thanataphobia change 
---
- I use the broken key sometimes so fight me
---
- You brought up the shroud. I dont think survivors should be able to spawn together without a shroud of union or binding 
---
- The issue with the bloodpoint changes, though I agree, is that the devs are very picky about the bloodpoint economy
---
How do you get more traps? I played him twice and both times it only game me one trap to place down.
---
Thanks! 💕
---
TAKE MY UPVOTE. Didn't think I could hate Sprint Burst more than I did. Thank you for showing me the light.
---
&gt; It doesn’t give you the burst of energy though
---
Sure but it can literally be used multiple times a game. Compared to self care which takes 40 seconds that does sound pretty OP.
---
This should not be marked as original content as you only added a title to an image that you didn't create.
---
You’re severely underestimating Pig. Her traps are still a good way to slow the game down.
---
Leatherface is probably the worst Killer in the game. He is actually a 115% powerless Killer most of the time. You have to be right on top of Survivor to use his chainsaw.
---
Same problem as with Borrowed Time. It won't be a perk, but a necessity. That's not enough, imo.
---
But! Still a good idea for a perk either way.
---
I'll have to give it another check when I get back
---
Then I rape you.
---
\*insert thank you gif\*
---
&gt;His tracking is unreliable and very situational. 
---
Just proves you didn't play Doc for more than one game. His tracking is NOT situational and it is quite reliable. I don't know how to show you that, since you don't even know what you're talking about.
---
I just imagine you down them, beat your chest like a gorilla then let them all escape. Displaying your dominance but showing mercy.
---
Seriously dude? It's so self-explanatory I don't know what part don't you understand?
---
just imagine had they never nerfed the mori, so you kill them without having to hook them. No more following the killer.
---
Not being able to loop for 60 seconds.....the killer is right there staring at you during unhook trash camping and attempts to hit you down immediately in front of the hook.  Lol that has nothing to do with the survivors skill dude.  Without the perk they have no counter.  It's redesigned to punish trashcans that camp and tunnel hooks.  To still equate it to No one Escapes crutch is silly post rework.
---
Here’s my complete rule book for survivors as the killer: 
---
Play how you want, however if you use exploits, glitches, or attempt to sandbag or farm other survivors I swear I’ll make the rest of your time in my lobby miserable 
---
Have a good day everyone!
---
I don't want Nurse nerfed into oblivion or anything. I'm not even sure how you'd do that without fundamentally changing her kit altogether.
---
I just think it's unfortunate that her power wound up being one that broke several gameplay mechanics that allow survivors to prolong chases. Counterplay for nurses basically boils down to "Try to stay out of sight and if she's after you, be as random as possible to try to mess up her blinks." 
---
If anyone has any tips for counterplay I'm all ears. It seems like 10 times out of 10 if we draw a good nurse on PC my team is getting rekt, fairly quickly. I mean WTF do you do when they add multiple blinks or extra speed with add ons?
---
Idk I think he’s that thicc in game
---
Yeah it does. It even makes me a bitch for saying your both bitches.
---
Happy cake day friend!
---
*scrolls to look for noed comments*
---
Most of the meta survivor perks aren't even from dlcs; Selfcare, adrenawin, deadhard
---
You can start with those if you really want meta perks and just start using other perks you like
---
And some tips would be,
---
Dont get scared, if you hear the heartbeat dont run from that gen just yet he might not be chasing you
---
If you're on a gen and someone is hooked across the map, it's probably better to stay on the gen, its likely someone closer will get him first
---
The less immersed you play, the better your lopping will get. If you run straight to a pallet and throw it down because your scared, that's a 10-15 second loop you just wasted
---
Yes you can play stealthy and still be good but that still requires you to know how to loop and not be scared, you can practice that by just playing not immersed 
---
Once you get the hang of teachable perks, you'll find out its much better to bring a med kit than to use self care
---
I mean unless you exposed them the moment that happened your not in a favorable position also if they expose you halfway across the map it doesn't help you either
---
You mean while you hide in the corner and do nothing Claudette. If the killer is bad then noed does nothing
---
Thats nothing, just bump into myers and then you will know true fear.
---
It's annoying, but it's a fault of our own creation as most solo survivors won't even rescue, so the guy can choose to die then and depip or another 5 minutes and depip
---
Nah man it don't. Shouldn't be afraid to call people out for being bitches. Dcing because you're trash and unconfident in your own abilities makes you a bitch.
---
You should definitely get Spirit.
---
If it promoted bad gameplay the perk would say "stand there and do nothing until the gates are powered". Stop being a sheep.
---
This describes virtually everything anyone complains about in this game.
---
I think people overrate how hard she is, yes she is way harder than other killers to learn except for Huntress, people never talk anout Huntress and how hard she is
---
Sure, it’s scary but at least he can’t insta down you 😂
---
Yeah i tend to run exposed perks but never NOED due to complaints plus i tend to go for a fuck gen perk build on killers i don't sweat on rn
---
Spirit is fun and very good at the same time, also has some nice teachable perks, but Legion is fun too imo. If I was you I'd go with spirit probably.
---
my problem with that is survivors dont get camped every single game, unless youre going against the same killers that like to facecamp or like pissing the killer off, its basically a wasted perk slot. The only time I could really see it being used is if youre wanting to be annoying enough to the killer and using clutch perks to keep annoying them.
---
Except if it gets destroyed,  which rarely occurs, you are given tons of time the survivors could have used on gens.
---
Trapper &amp; Wraith.
---
He needs the baby logic to defend his use of the most unnecessary crutch perk in the game.  If you can't win games at this point playing killer at this point of the games balance without NOED you simply don't know how to play the game yet.  Our games have never been easier than they are right now.
---
Tale as old as time. Killer who isn’t the best runs NOED to “counter gen rush”, gets boosted to a higher rank than they should, gets bodied by decent teams and complains about “SWF cheaters”. 
---
They don’t learn anything useful about the game by doing this and in the long run it hurts them, but at least they can say “I’m a red rank killer!” on Reddit I guess.
---
I like to think being a bitch is complaining about pointless shit like its damn important. I think all of us do that though tbh.  
---
(Though to be fair, everyone on this sub has probably done some bitching before, doesn't change the fact everyone is bitching)
---
Yes, it is.
---
Slow the game down, or take the risk of being punished for gen-rushing. The ball is in the survivors' court.
---
Out of the three spirit is better but imo it's like nurse, once you get the hang of her she's just not fun and way too ez
---
Plague is really fun to me 
---
Legion not fun lol
---
Because even if it gets broken you get value,  survivors had to spend time breaking five totems. Ruin has risk because it's the one ruined Tony's broken. She uses the whole game, but you're no way to find all 5 totems.
---
there are like so many posts about people saying legion isn't good for the game because they like ignore vital parts of the game like pallets or something stupid like that...but nurse does the same thing and is actually good so that argument has always been really weird to me
---
I like the idea of a build like this, but I’d have to level Laurie for this build right?
---
Don't even know if you a troll or just a retarded. Anyway, bye.

Legoin
---
nah he got lil chicken legs
---
“HOST UNREACHABLE” OK? GUESS ILL SWITCH TO KILLER “COULD NOT ESTABLISH CONNECTION” THEN JUST SAY SERVERS ARE DOWN.
---
Woah woah woahhhhh. Stop talking like that. That's too much honesty for this sub to handle.
---
L-geion
---
It could also be because the killer has Stridor.
---
As a new player, what should I be focusing on so I don't fuck up or get murdered first? I regularly get matched with experienced players, and feel like a drain on the team. Is there a role I should be filling?
---
Probably make it different killers have to be picked
---
no
---
Generators take five nanoseconds to rush. You can afford to take a few extra seconds to do bones, like come on.
---
Yeah I wouldn't expect killermains on reddit to understand anything.
---
Vommy mommy.
---
Also, Tru3 shouldnt be a fog whisperer.
---
Because thats how u promote ur videos to grow up, like you can just ignore the post...
---
Hey, at least I understood the joke.
---
Yeah. Good thing Legion was nerfed. Imagine this with 2 of the old legion. Would have been chaos.
---
&gt;"All 4 are Auric Cell-only."  
---
Well, yeah, they're for licensed characters, after all.
---
Damn you good
---
Watch some old videos from the game, you're definitely gonna notice a difference :D
---
Lol sooo whaattt...
---
It's just someone downplaying the insta down portion of the perk and pretending they use it for the speed boost lol.  Nothing honest about it.
---
Totem breaking intensifies
---
I agree. I played nurse a decent amount back in the day until I realised that I'm playing the exact same thing what I hate to play against, and I have to say, after like 5-10 games you can get used to her blinks pretty easily and getting at least a 3k every game won't even be a challenge.
---
I actually believe she's one of the easiest killers in the game btw, since she doesn't have to deal with loops at all, meanwhile other killers have to mindgame you and play smart to be able to counter loops.
---
For me leatherface and Doc are the worst. But even they are D tier.
---
Thank you kind sir c:
---
You collect them on the ground. look for their Red auras
---
I PLAY SOLO, SO I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY FUCKING DULL TOTEM ON THE MAP. I ALSO CAN RUN A KILLER AROUND FOR MORE THAN TEN SECONDS SO I CANT DO THEM ALL HALF THE TIME. SO WHEN THE BOOSTED NOED USER DOWNS ME EVEN THOUGH I DID FOUR FUCKING TOTEMS, CAN YOU ATLEAST TRY AND FIND THE LAST TOTEM YOU FUCKERS AND NOT JUST RUN OUT INSTANTLY?!
---
Dumb ass bitch. Off yourself.
---
200 IQ, I can’t even lie
---
Queermo loser
---
As big epic that would be, it is highly unlikely due to that lawsuit involving the Friday The 13th franchise.
---
Yes.
---
I think maybe wraith would be f now, but he has a bit of mobility.
---
Please support this so they can be encouraged to do one for the Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween characters
---
Positively thinking about cutting the veins from your wrist yet?
---
During matches, right?
---
Oh boy it's you again.
---
Fucking no life loser typing away on Reddit forums
---
Ain't nobody got time for that.
---
I main Freddy, Trapper, Wraith, and Legion all without resorting to NOED.  I don't want to hear the weak killer excuse lol.
---
eLigno
---
I agree! Freddy was the first killer I bought when I got the game because I’m a massive nightmare on elm street fan. I played him a lot and really loved him, ya the putting people asleep thing can get annoying but one of his strengths is when people face you a lot of the time they don’t know how to counter most of your powers. I firmly believe that all killers are decent at best, yes some are better than others but at least all of them can at least get one kill.
---
Yeah their ranks also just reset... Also you talk bout this game all day eveyrday but you didn't have any time to play killer, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm your story seems kinda, i dunno, bullshitty?
---
This is a very common suggestion on this subreddit, and unfortunately it can never work in the game. SWF makes this impossible straight out, and even without SWF his power is really weak: As soon as you know you're playing against the disguise killer, just stay away from other survivors and you'll never be hit.
---
i dont know stranger things
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WZLJpMOxS4
---
god i wish that were me 😔🙏
---
Because there is no such rules as you people imagine. The only rule this game has is no cheating/bug abusing, also maybe holding the game hostage or smth. Tunneling, camping and stuff are allowed, and only toxic survivor mains manage find excuses to have an easier game by saying "tunneling/camping bad".
---
because of all the cussing
---
most chatter in injustice 2 rooms including cussing. i like playing peacekeeper and agreeing with everyone. because of my yes man personality type. can't we all just get along?
---
Put her on tier 3 then hit it
---
September? Really? Ouch. :/
---
No, the auric cell prices are just for that character so you won’t get Laurie. You already have the map, everyone gets them
---
Yes, you right, well let’s pretend that he has brutal strength 3
---
You only get the killer/survivor you purchased. To get them both at once you have to pay for the dlc
---
That also
---
I just bring small game. I see at least one hex perk every game so it just makes it easier for me and that way I can keep on memorizing totem spots
---
So fucking relatable. I got Lerys 4 times in a row and on the fourth time I just ragequitted
---
My feeling is that all this recent stuff with licensed cosmetics (Ash and Ghostface’s stuff selling well, as well as all the hype around the Saw stuff) will persuade BHVR to seek out cosmetics for Freddy, Michael and Leatherface (and their respective survivors, maybe). I mean, Ghostface is already getting another outfit, so clearly these are selling really well. And if people love stuff for Pig... then they’re gonna freak out for stuff for icons like Michael and Freddy.
---
Got called a hacker for using headphones to track them down while playing as spirit
---
So basically the killer has the choice to run away and get less blood points and basically give them to another survivor. when its at the end of the game there is nothing else to do other then try to get as much points as you can. so if you care more about fun, then sure leave, but if you want those endgame points, then camp away my dude.
---
I personally really don’t like stranger things, but I don’t know. I like more “human” killers, but I guess they could add it since so many people seem to enjoy the series. If I had a vote though, I would vote no
---
I THINK how it currently works is if the host (currently killer) isn't receiving any packets about what you're doing it uses the last known input that was sent, or at least that's what I've observed in KYF. So if I'm walking in a certain direction when I plug pull I keep walking straight into a wall until I DC. 
---
Currently, killers who lag switch have 100% of the power since they're currently the host.
---
If that's true, lagswitching will only be able to hurt yourself. Time will tell, though
---
Cleansing all totems is a counter. But the current problems survivors have with NOED doesn't have to do with its counter. For starters, as solo survivor, I can't trust my three teammates to do totems. I literally see some of them walk by totems and not cleanse them at all. And what if the map is Lery's or the Game? I'm going to spend 5 to 10 minutes look for totems. I still do it sometimes. But I can't expect my teammates to. Unless the map has stupid easy totem spots, I can't go around looking for all five totems because I'm giving the killer too much free time, for a perk that might not even be in his build in the first place.
---
NOED gives an instadown and a speed boost at endgame, a point where most of the pallets in the map are used leaving survivors with little options when being chased. Most of the time, it punishes survivors for trying to complete the objective and gives the killer a second chance, when he failed to protect gens. The old Decisive Strike gave the survivor a second chance too, punishing the killer for doing his job. And that got reworked into an anti-tunneling perk.
---
I don't understand why some people turn a blind eye to NOED but are quick to criticize perks like Adrenaline, one that actually rewards players for doing their objective. NOED should be changed into something like that too. Hell even a totem counter would be fine by me at this point. It is arguably the only perk in the game that still rewards bad gameplay, when it should be rewarding great killer plays instead.
---
Its because the leather outfits weapon has animations and sounds
---
I didn't talk about Doc, I talk about Clown, LOL.
---
He play DbD for fun! Get him!
---
This is mostly true, only time is isn’t was a time I literally got blinded through a wall and the person escaped. Buggy shut like that left me pretty bitter afterward
---
So every DLC that states I "get a map", I already have that map?
---
All killers are viable with the right addons
---
Not really sure how that's "bullying", but ok. It's just an animation in a video game
---
I agree with most of your counters. And I definetly agree Adrenaline is very powerful, but removing the purpose of the perk takes it from meta to useless. My idea would be a full rework 
---
Adrenaline -
---
You start the trial with 5/6/7 tokens. Every time a survivor is hooked, lose a token. When the exit gates are powered, activate the following effects if the token count matches
---
- 5 tokens: Move at 150% speed for (whatever the time is)
---
- 3 tokens or more: Heal one health state 
---
- 1 token or more: heal from dying to injured. Does not give exhaustion 
---
- 0 tokens: heal from dying to injured but remain broken for the rest of the trial
---
She has a lot of knowledge behind her traps but she isn't hard especially not mechanically.
---
Yes everytime you swing
---
As someone that runs that same gamebreaking loop against killers at the Storehouse window I fully recognize how unbelievably cheese it is while doing it.  If we are being fair here it really isn't much different than say tunneling a survivor on their side.  Both are roughly the same level of cheapness with little counterplay.
---
I think I'm lost in replies. 
---
You replied to two of my comments so I got really confused. Sorry.
---
Here’s how it works;
---
When a chapter comes out, the map is free for everyone to play on- hence why you may have already played on Haddonfield, the Halloween map. 
---
Now, if you just but Michael in the store for 500 cells, you’ll only get him- not Laurie. If you buy the Halloween chapter itself, you’ll get Michael, Laurie and another outfit for her. So, my advice; buy the chapter.
---
Thanks lmao
---
Check out HybridPanda. He always has a good attitude.
---
Well at the 3rd anniversary livestream they said they were gonna adjust the loops or something. But i dont know if its now or later and i havent played the games in some time now because im not home so i dont really know. But there was gonna be a loop adjustment so they maybe decreased the amount of pallets.
---
But by your logic, if both won on Coldwind Farm, then both are good.
---
Yep I know fuck me right?
---
Legion? Op? LMAO
---
You really just couldn't miss the point any harder right? What if I did any of those things mentioned in my title to you as a killer? Would you enjoy that you stupid little fucking kid?
---
Some thoughts...
---
I agree with making charge time addons for Chainsaw killers not stack. If you reduce Bubba's charge time in a buff you can just adjust the addons to balance things out. It's not the worst idea but I'm just not a fan. 
---
Having the first Jigsaw box not be the one makes the first search essentially useless. A better change would be to have each trap you put on have one set box that will unlock it verse what it is now where each box always has a chance to be the box that unlocks it.  I may have worded it weirdly but essentially when you go to a box it's determined at that point if it will unlock it not when it's put on your head. Also there is no reason for her to be able to see her Jigsaw boxes, much like Plague not seeing her fountains. It serves her no purpose besides the "I trap, I tunnel" strategy. Granted I hate Pigs because all I seem to run into are camping and tunneling ones but that idea I got from Scorpionz who's a hell of a Pig main.
---
Being a Clown main I agree with all his changes. The duration addons not stacking...eh but I never stack them any way so it's negligible to me.
---
I actually think Legion is fine where he is but your ideas aren't bad.
---
I feel like Ghostface is almost impossible to break out of stalk at the moment but I'm not sure what causes this.
---
The only change I would make to Adrenaline is make it not activate if you're already exhausted. 
---
I think Bond is fine where it is.
---
Your Distortion idea is excellent.
---
Don't love the Windows of Opportunity buff due to easily exploitable windows. If you finally catch them out of position they'll just be off in the distance again. You would have to increase the cooldown.
---
Dying Light needs to remove the tunneling aspect of it. My best idea for it is you get the action speed penalty for each survivor on death hook and lose it once that survivior dies. I.E. (5% for each survivor on death hook. So if you're at 20% and you kill one, that falls to 15%). The numbers can be worked but the idea is there.
---
I don't think Enduring should work with DS.
---
Really nice idea for Hangman's Trick.
---
Nice idea for Haunted Grounds, Third Seal and Lullabye as well.
---
Much needed buff to Infectious Fright
---
With Monstrous Shrine I'm not sure if your rework means only in the basement or on any hook. If it's any hook I think it would be too OP, with the basement it's fine...maybe adjust the numbers but I haven't done the math.
---
I believe they reverted the Thanatophobia changes due to it stacking too much with Sloppy Butcher. The healing times were absurd from what I heard.
---
I think Keys should work during EGC but boy there are too many keys around. I just hate them in general.
---
Overall I like most of your changes and think you did a good job researching. Nothing is too overbearing and you have good game knowledge in my opinion. Good job
---
That's actually pretty clever and would encourage survivors play more safely instead of boldly. I like it.
---
There's a new chapter every three months. June  2018 Clown, September 2018 Spirit, December 2018 Legion, March 2019 Plague now June 2019 Ghost Face so next killer will launch September 2019 and the one after that December 2019. Paragraphs on the other hand are a whole another matter.
---
So apparently Monto leaked his sex tapes and said the n word in his original upload for the clown video and I have no idea what's going on anymore can someone send the original upload to my email obr364@gmail.com preferably in a file to see what all this drama is about
---
It’s so cool people are playing Feng more. When I started people barely played her. Tbh though, all characters are the same when it comes down it to. Just play the person you like most. I started with claudette for self care but this was before the nerf, so I would personally start with Jake for iron well (very underrated perk).  Lithe is a good perk but you have to learn when to use it correctly and not waste it (somewhat like sprint burst). Everything has already been stated, so I’m not going waste your time. Have fun.
---
\*loops killer for 3 minutes\*
---
Me when 2 gens haven't been completed in that time
---
I cringe so hard everytime I see someone use the word Incel.  It's right up there with snowflake.  I'd have cut it off one word prior.  Those terms take reasonable points and make them sound really stupid.
---
Imo he was never F tier.
---
But whyyyyyyyy?
---
They do only have 3 perks during the majority of the game, so there’s that
---
Adrenaline is one of the few perks in this game that is overpowered when the survivors are playing SWF, otherwise it's perfectly balanced and I don't see any problem with it. But still, in SWF groups it's absolutely ridicoulusly overpowered.
---
Omg this is the weirdest occurrence ever. A killer sad because his internet is bad even though he could lag switch? What?!?!
---
*cries in meg main*
---
I mean that one has original characters at least.
---
Bubba is my boi
---
Think that you can get that from here
---
https://www.g2a.com/r/cheapgamesandcards
---
Still the skin costs more than 2 chapters!
---
Tuft of hair, Tombstone, Make Your Choice, Haunted and Noed....
---
Stonks
---
Many perks just need a true counter is what I've realized. Like the MoM nerf. I dont think it needed nerfed, it just needed a counter. (That wasn't playing an instadown chatacter)
---
No, that is not what I've meant. I said
---
&gt; Either he's a god in one-trick's hands, or he's not F tier. 
---
So basically, the guy who did a 4k on Freddy coldwind must have been a one-trick, or, you know... freddy wasn't bad-- jk lol.
---
Doctor - either I'm THAT good on him (good to know), or he isn't an F tier.
---
actually the cooldown add-ons reduce fatigue by exactly 1 second if you use the dirt and Joey's. Which is still shit, really the add-ons are a crapshoot for Legion overall.
---
They were so scared of what happened with Frank's mixtape that they made like 90% of Legion's add-ons negligible and shit.
---
I don’t know how I should feel about your little screaming and eccentric friend. I just don’t like the whole, “OMG DUDE WHAT ARE YOU DOING. HURRY UP DUDE. OMG FUCKING SAVE ME NOW. DUDE WHAT. ARE. YOU. DOING? OH MY GOD HAHAHAHA ADRENALIN HAHAHAHA” yelling. And he was getting mad too. Wonder what would’ve had happened if he had died. 
---
Too stressful. Nice risky play though. Glad it paid off.
---
How is Hag not A tier? This list seems off to me.
---
What you actually oughta do (rank 3 leatherface main here) is wait for them to drop pallet, pretend you're going around and THEN saw the pallet, while changing directions.
---
I'd love to support licensed cosmetics but I'm not paying for characters I don't want to play as anyway. With the Freddy rework coming up it made way more sense to go with a Freddy cosmetic. Especially because he's way more of a popular character than Amanda
---
I get the logic of these cosmetics hopefully influencing them to pursue other ones but I wish they had gone with a different character first. Even Leatherface has a good group of fans that want his Pretty Lady outfit
---
Haha, "garage killer"
---
Yep
---
Yes, you can play all the maps. ( Ignore the map included description)
---
Been against some pretty good nurses on PS4 though.
---
Your style works so well with DBD, awesome execution!
---
Glad you think so, thanks! 💕
---
My biggest problem is I have no idea what they would possibly do for it’s power
---
Because for some reason you have the deluded notion that in a PvP game, your opponents have to 'play nice' and make things easy for you. 
---
It'd be like if I was playing League of Legends and telling the opposing jungler not to gank my lane because I'm just having a really rough day and if he does gank me anyway he's a stupid doo doo head. Or if I was playing Overwatch and I started berating the enemy healer for keeping their team alive, even though they can CLEARLY see I'm trying to kill them and it's not very nice for them to follow my "rules" and allow me to win.
---
Tell you what, I'll keep playing the game from the viewpoint of both sides are trying to win and it's stupid to expect one side to sabotage themselves because of "feelings". That if either side screws up and makes a mistake, the enemy is fully allowed to capitalize on it.
---
You can keep shitting yourself in frustration because a complete stranger can't read your mind and doesn't play the way you want them to.
---
We'll see who enjoys the game more.
---
Finding and cleansing all 5 totems because you can't count on your allies unless your SFW is so time consuming you will likely through the game
---
Survivors should just spawn in already on hook, in struggle state.
---
lol
---
Said OP and qued up for a survivor game running Adrenaline, DS, Deliverance and Dead Hard :)
---
Same.
---
Guess you could say they're... Le*gone.*
---
I crouch almost all the time then just stand up when I find someone. Not played her in ages though. Spirit or Ghostface now.
---
Yeah man, doesn't always work not getting hit if a Nurse or a Spirit has noed, plus the 4% extra speed are the biggest crutch, I don't give a fuck about the one hit downs.
---
They said humaniod shape to fit with their model. 
---
Quite some time ago they said no clown killerrs
---
If Freddy was haunting your dreams everytime you tried to sleep and you had to deal with that dude that often also after he picks off all your buddies aren't you going to be like "finally"
---
You mispelled "survivors who dont cleanse totems" as laughing stock
---
No kidding, 3 hour old account, and basically is already on a spree of "WAAAAAH, EVERYONE IS SO MEAN TO SURVIVORS HERE!". Give it a week, either the dude will be gone or he'll make a new account.
---
Nurse is more "difficult" in the sense its harder to play masterfully. But if you do play her masterfully she is way stronger than any huntress. Exception to this rule is possibly an insta down hatchet huntress, those are pretty strong.
---
I still refuse to believe Legion is F tier. They can pull off a lot more than other bottom of the barrel killers, and to make Legion better won't require a major overhaul or reworking like some other killers I believe still need.
---
Legion is basically a bad map pressure killer, BUT still a map pressure killer which is what a lot of other killers lack. Just give their add-ons meaningful numbers that aren't reduce stun by a 4th of a second, or giving survivors blindness after giving them 2 speedboosts and stunning yourself.
---
&gt;Its because the leather outfits weapon has animations and sounds
---
Don't know about the sounds but Test Subject Weapon is animated as well.
---
Or be in a game for 15+min, frequently running from and losing the killer and look at the gen counter to realize no gens has been done.
---
Nah, Myers weakness is T2. T1 has high stealth. T3 has oneshots. T2 is being an M1 killer.
---
I love how all the survivor mains blame the killer for failing to do his “job”, and in the same breath complain about never getting many points. You literally sat there holding m1 for 3 minutes, you only deserve 10k points. 
---
The main reason this ticks me off is because survivors always say the killer is bad when survivors escape, as opposed to the simple line of reasoning that survivors were good/SWF. Look at panda or some of the other really good twitch killer mains, even they lose sometimes, that by no means makes them bad.
---
I have a lot of fun playing the Pig and she just got new cosmetics
---
Yes i bought them and the drill has sounds
---
implying Plague is somehow anywhere near even D or C tier.
---
There is a reason most of that shit got patched out of the game.
---
This makes little to no sense. Every other character (survivors and killers) has Auric Cells only outfits and you also have to buy their DLC.
---
Nopppeeee
---
I already have Pig but thanks
---
Probably in the minority, but I don't think vanilla Nurse is that bad. Once you start throwing on range add-ons, and that omega-blink fuckery is when she starts getting ridiculous.
---
*Laughs in Bond and Overcharge*
---
This is pretty good.
---
 make more.
---
I don't get how people consider stuff that is intended by the game toxic. Flashlight saves are not easy to do and that is one of the main purposes of even bringing a flashlight.
---
SOMETIMES I LET A SINGLE SURVIVOR ESCAPE THROUGH THE HATCH WHEN I DESTROY A TEAM AND WILL STILL GET HATE MESSAGES!!! WHAT THE LITERAL FACK I CARRIED YOU TO THE HATCH!!!!
---
Thank you! I like your suggestion for the jigsaw box changes. Additionally the clown duration add-ons not stacking is due to the fact that if you do the math if they stacked after the increase it'd be waaay too long. It was less because I think people stack the add-ons (I play a ton of Clown myself and never do) and more to safety net a potential abuse if they did stack. That's the case with most of the "x add-ons no longer stack" changes because it makes their base kit better but if they could stack they would break.
---
Ghostface is simply put, bugged right now. Having played as and against him a lot, sometimes it's extremely braindead easy to break him out of shroud, other times hard. It has partly to due with the reveal range add-ons but this is the case even without them. The issue is less that it is too hard and more that LoS detection is wonky, because you can reveal him behind walls but he can also stalk you behind some objects, which is why I suggest that bug be fixed. With that said, if the bug is fixed he would be too easy to reveal in his current state.
---
The Thanatophobia changes in the PTB were a maximum of 24%. I felt like 20% was a decent middleground since 16% is placebo levels and not a big difference at all. At the very least, I think dead survivors should apply their penalty permanently since a perk that gets weaker as the match goes on is kind of cruddy and killers need more good slowdown perks that aren't Ruin. 
---
Obsession perks, for half of them at least, encouraging tunneling by nature, and it is less a problem with the perk and more a problem with the mechanic itself.
---
It's pretty bad now. (Pc) I won't even bother starting a killer game. These killer dailys just keep stacking up.
---
Thanks! I’ll think about it 👌
---
Thanks and happy cake day
---
not to mention the fact that they dont own the character... they have to pay the licensing company for any alterations to the character...

Thank you, swf groups completely ignore that point. That being said, I’d be fine if say small game came with a totem counter.
---
This happened to me once (I was the killer). So this one time, I was in Lerry’s and someone f’ed up a skillcheck so I went there. And oh my god. In a corner that I was blocking the only way out of, there were 2 neas in the INJURED state.
---
Long story short I got them to tier 3 and then I hooked them both
---
I agree in general that this is ridiculous and uncalled for.  There is one exception for me however.  If you choose to slug me and waste my time for minutes on end so you can selfishly continue your game before you make the decision that I'm allowed to finally die I will absolutely dc against that shit.  Nobody holds my games hostage.  Now if the survivors played like dogshit and I feel the killer deserves the 4K more than any of their immersed asses deserve a potential escape I will stay and let the man get us all.  But if it's just a tryhard doing it out if default to prevent even the chance of an EGC hatch escape I'm out.
---
They could've just changed Frank's, nerfed CD add-ons a bit, added the "deep wounds don't go down in terror radius", and maybe removed the deep wounds going down on additional deep wounds hits (or at least adjusted it in some way), and basically everything problematic or OP about them is gone.  
---
But since Legion was pretty dang bad without OP add-ons or exploits, they should've compensated them in some way.  Instead they just nerfed Legion in almost every other way as well and then slapped on normal move-speed so that they are at least an M1 killer.
---
I seem to get a flashlight warrior besting me with the flashlight saves every other game. I try to point away whenever I'm near a wall or chase them away but it seems like they follow me around the whole game! Any advice?
---
NEW SURVIVORS. STOP FARMING ME OFF THE HOOK!!!
---
I think they’re headphones
---
Why?
---
When you bait a loop and they fuck up
---
You're entitled to your wrong opinion. You're not entitled to change mine.
---
At least one exhaustion perk.
---
I don’t liek lithe because you could make it over the thing, but you still get hit. I suggest balanced landing if you want to loop him good. Sprint burst is good for if you want to get a head start at looping him. Adrenaline is good because while you are looping other survivors are doing generators so you get back up to another health state and they will be mad.
---
Dead hard is good as well for if they almost hit you, but you dead hard and they don’t giving you a bit more time to get to looping.
---
Decisive strike is good for if he tunnels you and you hit the skill check and you can get back to looping.
---
Yeah those all work well together.
---
I lost interest 20 seconds after reading post but sure. I say let people play the VIDEO GAME how they want. If you feel it's toxic then I'll assume you never play plague.
---
Im on ps4 and ive been getting a new error popping up kicking me out to login screen. Says something like "requires internet connection to play". Its been fine before. Not to mention the LONG wait times for matchmaking...
---
Imagine cleansing totems while getting chased. Yeah, mate, let me just do that real quick, oh wait. Yeah, doesn't make any fucking sense, does it?
---
This is a perfect sequal, thank you so much
---
Nah, it's just that I usually browse reddit outside with the sun and all, and because of that combined with low brightness I can't read thin fonts properly on my phone
---
Thinking is good
---
If a player is in a state that they have no control of their killer you can't stun then and blinding will create the blinding effect but not cause any drops.
---
What does the non drill one do? I hear they’re both animated
---
Good thing 90% of people suck
---
I'd recommend watching some survivor streamers, just to get an idea of pacing, and then apply yourself according to your skillset.
---
For example, if you're really struggling with skillchecks under pressure then consider avoiding doubling-up with other survivors on a gen (as you may needlessly draw attention to both of you. If you're a really good looper then you can always focus on baiting the killer and buying time for the other players. If you're not really great at anything then there's always tactical bodyblocking.
---
A lot of the time.
---
"doing gens, you?"
---
Yeah, new shit is great, I was just thinking this could be a cool addition if it wasn't too much work
---
&gt; While Billy is a mobile danger, LF is much more of a local danger, 
---
Billy applies the same "local danger" though, that's the point.  It's not like his chainsaw only works at long distances.  I'd argue Billy's is more practical up close since he can rev it without committing or slowing himself.  Just because Leatherface has no mobility doesn't mean he is stronger in a set area.  That's how it should work, but it isn't.    
---
&gt;his ability doesn't require much skill  
---
Neither does Billy lol.
---
Sure, but if survivors got more than killer, the number of people playing killer would drop. Trust me, this game can’t afford that.
---
Shirtless Lisa is up for kinky times
---
You don't have to rely on Ghostface's stalk to kill survivors though. Just using stealth is good enough to kill them most of the time. The stalk is just a nice bonus. Same with Pig. I'd say the bottom 2 are Wraith without ad ons because of the bell coming out of stealth and Leatherface.
---
Someone that has a brain. Tysm.
---
Pig is a licensed character and they have to pay in order to make the skins, that said, all skins from non licensed characters should be available trough shards
---
It certainly means it’s not “over” powered, it’s balanced by the learning curve -_-
---
I think both terms are dumb. I do get if some face camps that’s dumb but I don’t see anything wrong with patrolling the area. Tunneling is a dumb complaint the game has a built in system for me to track you down since you are hurt of course I’m going to track them if I can.
---
“Nerf” mettle of man
---
He looks somewhat line a human now
---
Imo the counter to noed is adrenaline. Also if everyone would just do every totem they as they’re trying to do gens it would be less of a problem. Too many just ignoring them.
---
He's so THICC
---
How about extra BP for survivors in general a killer can lose 2 survivors to the exits and still score a stable 35k BP.
---
A survivor that gen jockeys, and saves team mates and escapes flawlessly isbrare to see more than 17k.
---
Even me the guy who normally runs the long loops and pursues the hard hook saves finds it hard to break 23k or less depending on how fast we escape.
---
This is absolutely incredible!
---
I literally don't care.
---
I’m sorry I misread Plag as pig 😅
---
This video helped me a lot when playing VS spirit https://youtu.be/s2bXIO0c0CY
---
Mom pick me up I’m scared
---
But then noed would never get used and then they’d be forced to nerf adrenaline.
---
You can invite everyone to a group
---
All the time.
---
Just need to tag a ragdoll anim to them. Not full deathgarden fly off. But a heavy ragdoll. Like vault pallet take a hit. Heavy floppy roll off the palette. Would make for some funny moments. 
---
But yeah introducing these would probably break something else.
---
Yeah, but I don’t want to. I like reading text not getting yelled at.
---
Ahaha!! I was giggling the whole time reading this, wondering where it was going. 
---
I love both of the comics so much!
---
God I wish MBV would be a chapter
---
Yeah, a ragdoll would work
---
&gt;Billy applies the same "local danger" though, that's the point. 
---
Dude, you are denying the very point of LF's chainsaw - it doesn't stop when hitting someone. Obviously it's not the same as Billy's chainsaw, and what I called by "local danger" is different too as a result.
---
&gt; Neither does Billy lol. 
---
For you, maybe. I personally don't find playing Billy as something you could call easy, while I find LF's plays exactly a thing that you could call this way.
---
That was fast
---
Not arguing, but why not Pennywise?
---
he looks uncomfortable, it must be his first time.
---
Considering I haven't been posting here for some time, I thought I'd celebrate Amanda's new skins coming out today with this photo! The skins are so beautiful!   
---
Luckily I was one of the few winners of the DbD Quiz and I won some auric cells I'll be spending on my cute lil' bacon today!&lt;3 Ahhh I'm so happy she's finally getting some cool skins!
---
Okay hon, either survivors stay away from gens and take time cleansing totems or they focus on gens and noed activates. Either way it benefits the killer.
---
I dont get what people like about it
---
It sounds horrible and boring
---
What use is powet that i can use only after waiting a minute or a tp which will only prov sprint burst ?
---
I didn't downplay it, I infact said it makes it easier to get instant downs. And I don't use it for a speed boost, either (just saying it's a nice addition), because I do not use NOED. I prefer to use non-hexes.
---
It's the perfect time to get deliverance with all these headless chickens running around the map and leaving me to die.
---
If the Killer is face camping, you can either: 1. Try and face off against him and rescue the survivor because it’s fun.  2. Go do gens.
---
If you’re the one being camped, well that’s sad for you but if it was just up to RNG this should only be about 1/4 of your matches. 
---
If it seems like this happens in 100% of your matches, then maybe it’s not just the killer....
---
Meanwhile there's piggy who carries up to 5 helmets(with addons), just because she can
---
Always good to meet another who enjoys mischief
---
How would the giant worm thing carry survivors to hooks?
---
You are entitled to your wrong opinion dude
---
Well I’m talking about noed, so I’m referring specifically to games where the killer has it, but yes that is a flaw with the dull totem system. The thing is, it’s a risk for the survivors either way and it’s an “objective” that doesn’t progress the game at all.
---
&gt;Pig is a licensed character and they have to pay in order to make the skins, that said, all skins from non licensed characters should be available trough shards
---
No they **shouldn't**. They **could** be made available in shards but devs need to make money and you aren't really losing anything by not being able to grind for them.
---
I would love to grind for Huntress Mother Bear outfit and Nurse Miss Smithson outfit but I don't really mind not being able to get them. 
---
Additionally, is not like grinding 21.600 Iridescent Shards for ONE outfit is easy / quick anyway. This would be a nice incentive for players to play long hours to get to these amounts. 
---
All we can do is hope they make these outfits available in IS but I don't agree that they **should**.
---
Lol dude that's not what a grammar nazi is.  I'm just trying to help you communicate your points without making them sound stupid by default.  Also thanks for being a caricature and reminding me of libtard.  Add that to the list of shit that makes you sound really really stupid man.
---
MBV, Pinhead, and Pennywise would be awesome!
---
With the tentacles it has in its mouth?
---
TrASh teAMmAteS
---
Hmmm, 0 days on reddit. . . . .that "seems kinda, I dunno, bullshitty?"
---
Ever since this dropped I cant play at all. Anyone else?
---
Ghostface best boi
---
His map pressure is fine there tho with all the windows around, it can be more difficult to land a chainsaw hit
---
Except you don’t die, which I would very much argue is the main objective of SURVIVOR.
---
Bruh this is so good, how long did this take you to make?
---
Ya I don't buy this either. Once they know they can charge you X you can bet your ass they will never lower it, regardless of what they earn from cosmetics.
---
Ahh it was quite a while ago but I think roughly 5hrs??
---
Should I get bamboozle? I dont like playing clown but it's a good perk. Or should I wait for it to give out a better killer perk like BBQ or Nurse's?
---
Nope, use it and the second you go into his sweeps you can drop 15 frames.
---
I feel like letting go of the lean button is not that much of a high skillcap thing to do. You see him, you should be able to reveal him because you didnt let him sneak up on you, but he can just cheese it.
---
I believe Ghostface is a slightly different situation. AFAIK, BHVR acquired the rights to his mask so they can do whatever with weapon and body.
---
Lol I agree
---
Works. They just released the Saw collection
---
[The new Nightmare will be released on all platforms on July 23rd, 2019.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/74473/the-new-nightmare-content)
---
Exactly. I had no add-ons or offerings. There wasn’t really a reason to dc lol
---
I love the rework, but to be honest, only his pallet version. The snares don't seem to fun or useful
---
I like to use noed for Ghostface sometimes so I can still be stealthy and instadown without stalking, it saves precious time.
---
Hopefully if the do Freddy they do new nightmare Freddy if he's based on any films even though it feels unlikely
---
Thank you man
---
I’m glad he did lol
---
not really, it awards the survivors for winning :P
---
I've done both. The Spirit was easier. Win one mindgame you win the chase. With Billy it's like Nurse. It doesn't matter how many times you juke them, you WILL get hit eventually
---
Wow i think we found a total sjw here just wow arent you gonna go cry about shower curtains being racist or something lmfao to death sorry not sorry
---
TBH I can't stand the animations on her new weapons. They're super distracting in game. I wish they only did the animations when you swing.
---
On the mobile DbD pigs cosmetics were available for shards... f
---
Under pretty commonly known
---
That's not really how tier lists work though lol. There's always a best and worst. Perfect balance is pretty much impossible.
---
You can if you make a Swedish Apple ID
---
20 BP per second while camped seems fair to me. 1200 per hook state, 2400 if you're some unlucky bastard who ran Kindred.
---
Idk I really like this one, I’m not sure about the other one but the jittery-ness really compliments Amanda’s personality
---
Alright, thanks for the feedback! Makes me think something is up on their end. Im guessing has something to do with the new store releases today. Well... hope they can get it squared away :)
---
It's not easy to use on console lol
---
Well yeah, literally the condition of decisive to activate is you getting caught and hooked, as a survivor im pretty sure thats failing
---
That is how tier lists work, it’s possible to not have any F or D tier characters, obviously the ones in C tier and above would still be ranked from best to worst
---
What even is relax? How can one relax in this day of all the POG skins? This is a glorious day which I'll UWU through!
---
It kinda is. The sens is the only thing that's bad about it.
---
Have you considered not buying or buying 2 parts instead of all 3?
---
The thing I find with Nurse on console is I never play around with survivors. Every other killer I play I will goof around but with Nurse I feel like I have to try to kill them all.
---
Me: loops killer for 3 minutes 
---
P3 Claudette: *urban evasions around the whole map 3 times*
---
Welcome to DBD where addons never get nerfed but killers are still poor oppressed creatures that need monthlong reworks or full gamechanges like EGC because they're the real victims here.
---
imagine his pickaxe but I forgot he has no powers, he stalks in the movies and you can't give another DLC character stalking again there's Myers already and now ghostface, unless he's like leatherface where he can down more than 1 survivor with his pickaxe, Maybe he has strength? breaking down pallets quick e.c.t.?
---
I RE-ENABLED MESSAGING AFTER I PLATINUMED THIS GAME. MY VERY FIRST GAME AFTER, I DOWNED AND HOOKED A SURVIVOR DURING THE EGC AND GOT A "CAMPING F\*\*\*\*T" IN MY INBOX FOR MY EFFORT.
---
Lol coming from the guy who made an entire post about saminations "rule book" joke and commented in it 6 times. Not a crybaby at all.
---
Wow no way! A killer brings a perk that benefits him? Holy fuck what a loser...
---
Pig is still pretty decent defiantly not f
---
People keep telling me pennywise is a no because the clown exists and that pennywise has no power.
---
Random framerate drops have lost me chainsaws if I'm not using add-ons. I could be on top of a survivor and then 5 frames skip and I didn't even see them 360 me, because the chainsaw actually causes frames to drop sometimes.
---
&gt;Yes, he can go from side to side of the map rather fast IF there is an open route to do so (Some maps...not so much). 
---
That doesn't matter. The gens aren't located on fucking corners. 
---
&gt;It's an instadown that will only connect if you're not paying attention or get caught in a dead zone of the map, it's easy enough to juke.
---
Or. As stated before. If the hitbox is just overpowered as shit. There are so many chainsaws I've watched land that visibly miss on Surviviors that weren't lagging. 
---
&gt;There is a cooldown, a few seconds but still a cooldown and the drawback is once you start charging, if you want to cancel you need to wait at a slow speed for a few seconds allowing the survivor to gain some considerable distance.
---
If the Survivior is gaining distance while you wind down you just commit to the chainsaw and go for it and boom, any drawback there is 100% gone. And a few second lmao what a joke. Come back when it's fucking 20 seconds like Spirits phase walk. 
---
&gt;Without 115MS Billy would be unplayable. He's already easily loopable as is.
---
So lemme ask. If killers in this metagame have their power defined by how good they are at ending chases. Why is an "easily loopable" killer at worst the 3rd best killer in the game? Why is that? Could it be that looping isn't nearly as strong a mechanic as ppl say? We all know that's bullshit so it must be the alternative, that he ISN'T easily loopable. 
---
&gt;Billy is probably the only well balanced killer in the game. Good power with drawbacks that also takes a degree of skill to hit consistently.
---
Compare that degree of skill to the skill it takes to play Nurse. Compare it to Spirit, or Huntress or Hag. All 3 of those killers take LEAGUES of skill higher than Billy to use effectively and he's better than at least 2 of them. He's *too easy*. That's his fucking problem. He's the 3rd best killer in the game if I concede he's inferior to Spirit, and he's somehow easier than any other fucking top tier. Doesn't that bother *ANYONE*? You don't need much skill to land his chainsaw, trust me. I've played a lot of Billy (I was tired and wanted something to put me to sleep) and it's mundane and boring how easy he is. You fuck up and you can just M1 ur way out of the situation. With other high tier killers you can't do that.
---
&gt;Doesn't ignore any mechanics in the game. Has a traditional movement speed and can be looped like other killers.
---
Hag and Huntress don't ignore mechanics, are harder to master, and have lower movement speed. Should they be buffed so they're above Billy bc he has nothing but ups on them? 
---
Spirit is the best at mindgames but if you fuck up a mindgame you lost the chase with her. With Billy you can fuck up as many times as you want. As long as there are gens to do you have all game to fuck up bc you'll always be able to catch up to Surviviors. With Spirit you can't do that. One fuckup and you might as well move on.
---
Oh dang.
---
I'm on PC, I haven't had that error message, but I've had, like, 4 or 5 different kinds.
---
The host triggering the anti-cheat system, connection to host interrupted, lobby doesn't exist anymore...
---
As long as it has the conditions of you actually being *camped*. And instead of a stun, why not jump into an Entity portal at to at least *X* meters away, where *X* is what the perk levels.
---
My biggest problem is that I'll chase one survivor for too long.  Even if I end up getting them, and I operate at maximum efficiency, it's still enough time for the other to pick up or unhook their friends, etc.
---
Not sure how I'm supposed to balance hooks, smashing generators, and chases.  Seems like if the survivors are even semi competent, they still wipe the board with me.
---
But there are no portals?
---
I’d imagine he’d be a stealth killer. Lock pallets, windows, maybe chests? Generators would be a big part of his power, maybe like surveillance or the all seeing addons as a part of his base power?
---
In 6 days.
---
This is so gorgeous! More dbd characters please please please!
---
Welp trapper can snowball if your lucky but eats a fat dick against brain cell having survivors 
---
Spirits hard to learn for a new or bad killer but shes a solid choice.
---
Huntress aswell but again requires practice.
---
But if your looking for brain dead fun bubba is the one
---
So? Isn’t that the point of the perk?
---
We did a pretty good job so far
---
Touche
---
Yet.
---
What the heck is a POG skin?
---
He looks well rested.
---
with a fork.
---
Nice but bad try, sweetie :*
---
I've got 30 games on springwood I gotta enjoy with my good ol pal balanced landing, which maps will you guys use to totally not piss off hypocrite killermains?
---
I don't see an issue with your playstyle. We do need people like you. Except that should probably get you red, not gold.
---
Perk ming
---
Swf
---
You are just full of them today aren't you lol.  So much cringed in so few characters.  This is getting hard to watch man.
---
I WAS NOT AWARE WE LOSE ALL PERKS, ITEMS, ADDONS AND OFFERINGS WHEN WE PRESTIGE AND NOW I AM FUCKING PISSED!
---
&gt; sweetie :*
---
ahahahahahahahahahaa
---
If you're getting gens done, you're being helpful.
---
The memes are more so about people who spend all game hiding and not doing ANYTHING
---
I HAD A GAME A FEW DAYS AGO WHERE I DID FOUR ENTIRE GENS AND I GOT HOOKED DURING END GAME, NO ONE WAS DEAD YET, I WASN'T BEING CAMPED, EVERYONE WAS HEALTHY, AND THEY ALL LEFT ME TO DIE. IT WAS MY FIRST FUCKING HOOK. NO KOBE EITHER.
---
You posted this earlier, OP
---
I’ll see if I have the motivation to draw more 😅 Are there any particular characters that you prefer?
---
I guess it depends on the killer you play but overall, I think it’s worth since BBQ rarely gets on the shrine
---
I love Macmillan maps. Favorite is the ironworks. I just love going to the top of the building to look over the map
---
All are Auric-Cells-Only. My excitement dropped hard. 
---
I guess I may pick up Pig's animated weapon at some point as it looks interesting.
---
&gt; Dude, you are denying the very point of LF's chainsaw - it doesn't stop upon hitting someone.
---
Which is basically only ever relevant if you're camping lol, which I mentioned in my original comment.  "Unless you like hook camping, any reason to play Leatherface is just done better in a similar way by Billy."  
---
&gt;For you, maybe. I personally don't find playing Billy as something you could call easy,  
---
&gt;You can rev LF's chainsaw without committing, and Billy slows his movements while revving. 
---
I mean you have to drop it if you don't commit with LF, whereas with Billy you can tap the chainsaw to keep it partially revved.  That in combination with the speedburst from Billy's chainsaw makes the slow irrelevant most of the time for him, but with Leatherface the slow can lose him kills easily
---
Im surprised that you still havent caught on to the fact that even my first comment was a joke.
---
You'll notice those silly rules are there to make the game as easy as possible for survivors. Really tough to 2 hook everyone before all gens are done in red rank play.
---
Epic bruh moment #8: getting negative karma on your first day on reddit
---
IM OUT OF TOWN AND HAVE TO USE MY MOBILE HOTSPOT TO PLAY THE GAME AND ITS RUINING THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SURVIVORS IM FACING, IM SO FUCKING SORRY GUYS I JUST WANNA PLAY THE GAME, PLEASE JUST LET ME GET BACK HOME ALREADY
---
Basically is a special offering, when you burn it you can do a sort of "fatality" (there is only one mori animation per killer currently) to the survivor.
---
There are 3 different mori offerings, ebony lets you mori all 4 survivors after hooking each one time, Ivory lets you more ONE survivor after hooking it once and cypress lets you mori only the last survivor (once he is been hked once and the other survivors have either escaped or died on a hook)
---
Oh wait guys, I just found we have to pay 5 extra dollars for a DRILL NOISE
---
i came here to ask if this was a mistake or they're just fucking assholes
---
You're in the same map as them after you hooked them, you chased them instead of running away. Who knows. Just ignore it. Salty people be salty. Its keyboard warriors going at it
---
I agree! Hopefully we get more skins for her in the future! Definitely gonna be rocking her test subject skin with the prestige blade for the time being tho!
---
Something similar happened to me. Except it was insidious basement bubba
---
No, i meant if you used selfcare or not as perks you brought in. If I don't at least bring sefcare, this happens most of the time.
---
Gen rushers are fine, but after gens are done, there may be a time when we need survivors off the hook. Or when your last teammate is on the hook and you’re his only hope of getting down. Also, you won’t get any progress in your rank just by doing gens.
---
You're talented! I tried drawing Laurie in between games on my Ipad with the apple pencil and she ended up looking like Quentin with blonde hair!
---
I know its not survivors fault for doing nothing, but it's not fair to gain rank from doing nothing. 
---
For the camping thing I think a radius around the hooked survivor would work, even if they leave it to avoid punishment for  a moment a survivor could grab their teammate at this point. 
---
Sure it would ruin everyone's game if they were kicked but killers would learn to git gud in the end so it'd stop being an embarrassingly common trend to face camp
---
I bring out Leatherface when I find that lobby I just know is a SWF. His chainsaw shuts down those super altruistic hook saves.
---
It's the Mori
---
That game is essentially a more casual version of DBD (no offense). There's nothing wrong with that, it was less balanced but probably more fun to play among friends.
---
DBD on the other hand is more competitive, and with that comes a toxic community. It'll happen in any competitive game, but this one has it bad.
---
What lawsuit? This is dead BEFORE daylight, not by, so it's a totally different game, no case for a lawsuit here whatsoever.
---
^/s
---
this is rlly good wtf
---
Oink.
---
I have come around blind corners as Trapper and pulled tgem off gens. And hook rescues
---
😍😍😍
---
Today I learned teabagging at the exit gate is toxic. I just want the extra escape points though so I'm gonna keep doing it
---
Bahaha this. I love when they all get cocky and try to block me from putting their friends in the basement, resulting in me getting a full basement.
---
Glad you think so, ty 💕
---
I JUST BOUGHT A NEW PIG OUTFIT AND WANT TO PLAY A MATCH BUT I KEEP GETTING "NO NETWORK CONNECTION" YET I HAD ENOUGH OF A CONNECTION TO BUY THE DAMN OUTFIT
---
If he hadn't gotten nerfed right after release, I think most would have learned him and he'd be around B tier. He got memed so hard that 90% of the community just thinks of him as a terrible killer and never actually tried to utilize his powers.
---
AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE DWIGHT SITTING IN THE LOCKER WHILE IM ON HOOK agdhsbndjfbavdkc sksnslfbbd
---
I must be a garage survivor, I'm almost certain I've never successfully used a flashlight
---
I feel this every time my wiggle bar fills right as the hooking animation starts. It's mad frustrating but that's the way it be
---
Try turning up your brightness then?
---
Is the noise playing all of the time? Can survivors hear it while you are stealth?
---
And there really is a killer rule book. On ps4, I constantly get messages from killers telling me I will get tunneled if I use a flash light or say that I should kms for playing in a "toxic swf" when I play solo. Not to mention how I always see posts here complaining about teabagging, emoting, moonwalking, adrenaline, balanced landing, object, and haddonfield. Both sides are whiny, but holy shit do killers complain.
---
&gt; Deliverance 
---
Come on.
---
I’m not sure
---
Tier lists don't seek to grade everyone. They seek to order everyone from best to worst. In some games, the worst isn't going to be bad, and the game will be very balanced, but someone will still be the worst.
---
No, they don’t work. As long as the timer hasn’t started, if you have a trap on your head during EGC, you can just leave.
---
You're on a roll with the DBD art lately! I love this!
---
I only do it if I see they all have items or have the same skin. Other than that I just use legion with frank mixtape or impossible skillchecks doctor on the game. I may not with but at least they won’t have that much fun
---
But that doesn't make any sense. There's no concrete definition for what's "F-Tier" and what's "A-Tier". It's just the worst possible option and the best possible option.
---
Huntress relies on direct line of sight while the Clown doesn't. You could compare him to Huntress just like you could compare Leatherface to Billy. Clowns a more casual, easy to use version with a somewhat less effective power.
---
Haha thanks, I’m just reposting some of the art that I usually post on my instagram though 😂 I wish I was that fast at drawing 😔
---
That was probably my biggest gripe of all the changes. I thought part of the Frenzy power was no cooldown on missed attacks, I think just losing a % of your frenzy on missed attacks would be a nice compromise, like lose 5-10% of Frenzy everytime you miss an attack, so you are still punished somewhat but can take advantage of your fast attacks.
---
That's possible, but it means I'll chew through my battery faster which also isn't ideal
---
So how's your sex life?
---
If there’s no concrete definition then how can you argue that yours is right and mine is wrong?
---
so all of your comments were ironic?
---
That would suck if you pay extra to be less stealthy lol.
---
Yeah. After being a killer main for 3 years I see why people play survivor. It’s more fun, you don’t have to worry about your perks being nerfed into the ground because there’s 6 more you can use, and shirtless David. I like shirtless David.
---
It would
---
Or a insidious killer
---
Ah you understand my ways?
---
Good idea have one survivor running around for 10 minutes finding and cleansing every single totem when the killer MIGHT have noed. Genius. You’ve cracked the code.
---
I play on PS4 and the frame rate doesn't help in frenzy. I miss quite a few attacks.
---
Expensive skins getting more expensive. Dang.
---
Yeah but i also meant with the finger add on
---
The intention doesn't really matter when it isn't against the rules of the game. These are still made up rules that people who only play killer make up.  Camping doesn't necessarily have to be for bm. Teabagging can be for keeping the killer on you and same for flashlight clicking. If anything, the killer rules have minimum impact on the course of the game for them and yet they still whine.
---
Milking us like cows
---
So minus is they were required a certain level of quality by the license holders, they raised the quality and added more content to a skin.
---
I'm not a fan of how high the prices are generally, but the increase for this specific skin does make sense.
---
Oink
---
Lmao what? You're definitely in the minority with that opinion. She's considered the 2nd best killer by most.
---
Can’t believe people think legion is good.
---
Bamboozle is good.
---
I can't, tier lists are literally whatever people want to make of them! Haha.
---
Ass blasters...
---
the big gag to me is that if you pay $20 you can't even get both full new pig skins....you end up beong 18 auric cells short so you'd have to spend the extra $5 still because they can't just have a set price.....it sucks because skins are really not worth it at all in this game but i still want them
---
I love all the killers anyway. People might laugh at how easy it is to escape certain killer but at the end of the day they can still kill you ;). Their unique powers is what makes then fun to play anyway
---
Knife seems like it needs tighter screws. Poor craftsmanship, Jigsaw would be disappointed.
---
What about S tier killers? The rank reset REEEEESSSS??? They’re f tier survivors and S tier killers
---
I’m glad you’re playing the game in a way you enjoy it because that’s all that really matters :)
---
I keep getting a message saying that I could not connect to the host for some reason, ps4 also. Internet seems to be working fine.
---
Not only is it animated, it also has unique sounds. It's awesome.
---
That’s a good question that I don’t know unfortunately. Haven’t unlocked that teachable. Would be a good add to this build though.
---
same it goes for me
---
I don’t mind immersed players as long as they are being somewhat productive
---
Yeah, I’m sure they’d prefer it if you ran four meme perks. Using a strong build isn’t toxic.
---
You decide to tunnel off hook and you get what you get. It never activates half the time because a lot of killers in purple play both and understand how shitty not being able to do anything after being hooked once is.
---
I don't know, maybe these people are gods at Legion, or struggle more against him compared to Leatherface. There is probably way too few LF players that people don't really face good players, I have no idea. But Legion is a joke when I got to play against him, at least LF makes me sweat when I know I'm not in a good spot of the map.
---
HARRINGTOOOOON
---
Good, Dbd is a huge cash cow at this moment, they will do anything to earn as much money with cosmetics and new Killers before the Game dies in about a few years
---
So adrenaline is the survivor equivalent of noed, but no changes to noed? The most game changing perks I have seen are noed, adrenaline, and ruin. These 3 perks I have seen numerous times completely decide matches. If you are going to nerf adrenaline into the ground, I think it would make sense to do the same to noed. Ruin is fine where its at due to totem placements and what not.
---
They might as well double the bloodpoints for everyone as default ... this game has to many characters to be as grindy as it is.
---
What platform are you playing on?
---
I had the same thing after buying a cosmetic. I restarted the game and it’s working
---
Then while hooked you see all 3 sprinting towards you for a snowball effect resulting in a 4k.
---
Achievements are bugged as hell right now, still havent gotten my "Prestige 3 a character" trophy but have the one for Prestige 3-50 lol.
---
What’s sad is we all know people are gonna buy. They’re gonna flock to buy both sets
---
Oh shit fam lemme get them downvotes back
---
Dude. You seriously can't defend pre rework Freddy. He was the worst, end of story.
---
R.I.P. Meg. This was my fault. We ended up losing the game. It’s a shame because we were doing so well.
---
Well, I appreciate that! Lol. I would kill for an ipad with an apple pencil. I'd still enjoy to see the outcome of your drawing. Poor Quentin, scarier than some of the killers. Lol
---
I wish I had more randoms like you! My thing is, if I get caught by the killer that's on me, so my teammates might as well be getting something done, only going for a save if readily available and even then I won't get salty if they don't. More often than not though if I do get hooked, nobody is getting anything productive done at all. You're doing you job great.
---
correct me if I’m wrong but the killer was notified by you doing the gen anyways, so even if it didn’t mess up then they would have gone to you, and the meg would have been killed anyway.
---
I don't know if you have Hex:Ruin, but at this point getting the Hag just for that is worth it even if you don't plan on using her.
---
The Netflix twitter tagged a bunch of game companies in one of their tweets during E3. Two that I can remember is Epic of Fortnite and the devs of Dead by Daylight. Fortnite already got their demigorgon and Hopper skin. So there’s a good chance we’ll get a stranger things chapter
---
I find the pig less viable after her nerf. Myers would be a better choice for a player who hasn’t played in a long time. He’s by no means underpowered and is easy to use.
---
Plebs. I counter noed by dying before the 5th gen.
---
Most of your reasons for why this ban is bullshit is pretty stupid and doesnt really apply. I don't know if you were cheating nor do I really care but trying to say a cheating ban is bullshit because
---
1. It doesn't matter if you were playing the game or not it just matters that you did cheat at one point(again not saying you did)
---
2. You spent money on a game doesn't make much sense and doesn't apply to the ban
---
3. I don't see how you hating cheaters matters at all to anything about this situation. Also I would assume 99% of players hate cheaters
---
4. This is phrased pretty poorly and just makes you look like a cheater and a liar with your argument
---
5. Again this doesn't matter nor apply to your cheating ban
---
I mean you probably get called toxic just because your using spirit, if you where to use that on a worse killer like wraith I bet those complaints will half.
---
It’s a bug. If you leave a gen, it blows up randomly. This is the first time I’ve seen it happen as a gen was being done though. Maybe you or Meg got off too quickly?
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cegg1e/i_think_i_have_a_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
NOED does have a risk, getting all the dulls cleansed BEFORE every generator gets completed. There's 2 protection perks to protect your HL and Ruin, it's HG and TOTH. That means survivors might have to go through TOTH and/or HG to get to the Ruin/HL in some games. "Survivors are naturally altruistic" Count me out from that. I'll stay away from the hooked guy unless they're at half health on hook in the phase they're in  and not getting unhooked. Good survivors can and will cleanse all 5 dulls in any circumstance to avoid NOED even if they aren't looking for the dulls everywhere around the map
---
NOED doesn't need a nerf because you can disable it by cleansing all the totems, which does not take much time to do. There is no way to disable Adrenaline. Additionally, NOED is used less and less as you climb ranks and play against better killers who either do not need NOED or are playing a meta killer.
---
Worst idea ever. Lets punish a struggling killer who has 0 hooks by hitting them with strong adrenaline and lets punish survivors going against a good killer by taking their entire perk away. Balanced.
---
Look for the two list of nerfs on both side, you'll see the difference. I agree with most of what you said I just disagree about complaining on survivors nerfs, most of them are deserved, especially if you know from what pedestal survivors come from.
---
They’d be better off as killers who think they’re survivors.
---
I diagnosed her with baby!!!!
---
Awesome art!
---
Pretty short sighted, number of killers decreased, survivor times take longer. Survivors aren’t very patient to begin with, so likely some will leave as well. A decreased player population doesn’t usually mean good things for a game, unless it’s to remove cheaters or something
---
Downvoted?
---
*slightly*
---
Set your max frames to 10-15 and try to win matches.
---
Right. That would have happened regardless, but I figured the explosion would have enticed the killer to come to the area as they would have expected someone to be there. If a red notification and a generator symbol are shown right next to each other, then the killer knows for a fact that someone IS there. I usually ignore generator completion symbols because the survivors are usually long gone, but this would have made the killer immediately check the area.
---
What's the goal then?
---
I’VE GOT A PET RELATED ISSUE TOO. I’VE BEEN UNRELENTINGLY TRYING TO TEACH MY CATS HOW TO USE THE FLAP IN THE DOOR BUT THEY KEEP JUMPING FOR THE HANDLE. LIKE STOP THERE’S A CAT SIZED HOLE FOR YOU.
---
Explain?
---
Op please delete. I’m in this post and i don’t like it.
---
Isn't everything on this subreddit basically bitching tho?
---
I'm just hoping we get poop goes the weasel before reworked freddy comes on because I am not buying clown for 1 perk
---
The devs said they won't do non-humanoid killers.
---
Yeah some people just can’t say no.
---
I love this sm
---
I meant i was curious as to why you were. Didnt even do anything.
---
Meg homies: MIP MIP
---
The Meg wasn’t working on the generator; she was just in the area. I got away free, but she was found. This is a dumb bug and it may have lost us the game.
---
Sometimes I think it’s a borderline addiction
---
I think it should be the other way around. If you are a swf and you have deliverance, holy shit deliverance is God tier.
---
Fuck I love your art (´；ω；｀)
---
Probably OP salty he got called out for reposting the same meme again
---
\*proceeds to decisive you and sprint burst away, reaching the gate and t-bagging looking right into your fuckin eyes\*
---
This is great
---
THE FUCK I HEARD THE MOBILE VERSION IS OUT BUT I CANT FIND IT ON ANDROID OR IOS AND NO ONE WILL ANSWER ME WHEN I FUCKING ASK THEM HOW THEY HAVE THE MOBILE VERSION ALREADY WHAT THE FUCK
---
Karma whores usually are lol.
---
You cosmetics buyers are idiots because the game is  frickin shit and you think to buy cosmetics instead of not giving a cent to this awful game. Don't give them money before they fixed the game.
---
I'm not saying it's ok that they're overcharging you but it's way less scummier then what epic does to their players plus you to wait for the set to even come out and if you're busy  there's a chance you'll miss making you wait for it even longer and we aren't even including them labeling skins as exclusive then bring them out again.
---
The saw has noise as well, so the noise has nothing to do with it.
---
They are called fucking totems you fuck sticks.
---
I think the Hag is a free killer :o
---
If blinding the killer is toxic, then are you supposed to only use flashlights to break Hag traps?
---
And it only took 20 years.
---
So what? Most of his examples happen to bad legions. If you got a brain you wont make most of these mistakes
---
You obviously one trick survivor.
---
Those are some controller like movements.
---
Lol did you see this [Trapper](https://v.redd.it/suk4mrzg8ra31)
---
I don’t hear survivors complaining about unviable killers though.
---
Maybe it has more noises?
---
Or maybe BHVR are just assholes
---
I didn't even notice the leather piggy cost more, thankfully I prefer test subject but it is strange how they're priced differently.
---
I think it's safe to rule out the fact that Pig is liscenced as being the reason one costs more because otherwise both would be the higher price.
---
Yes I did try and I mained him for a long time. He never failed to disappoint to get a 4k. And whenever you put people to sleep their frames drop a severe amount.
---
Sorry if this is a stupid question, but how to get red perks? (Not the teacheable ones)
---
So it's not so much that I don't know the counterplay. 
---
It's that from my own experience playing spirit, there are certain areas and loops where if she is looking at the grass or listening for breathing/footsteps at a pallet, they're going to down me. That's because there's no chance a survivor would escape me in that situation and there are spirits much better than myself.
---
It's licensed killer cosmetics, they are more expensive to make since they have to pay for the rights to the characters.
---
technician putting in work lol
---
do you know how many killer perks that can be taken away by survivors? Tons. How would it not be fair that a survivor's perk could also be taken away by punishing unsafe play?
---
Verify your game files.
---
Why would you be destroying all 5?
---
There is a correlation. Let me explain.
---
This game is 3 years old. Purchases of the base game drop dramatically by then unless there's some amazing new piece of content to reignite sales. To continue employing developers after the initial release of a game requires incoming money. The stream of incoming money can't come every three months when a DLC drops, so cosmetic add-ons are a good way for people to continue supporting the development of the game past the time that it would have been supported by the base game purchases.
---
I'm not saying that the DLC should be cheaper now that there are cosmetics supporting the developers. I'm saying that cosmetics help keep the price of the DLC low instead of them having to raise the price to continue creating more DLC/supporting the game with updates.
---
Because this dude is a NOED fanboy and True is very outspoken for it being a crutch used by inexperienced players.  Naturally he'd take issue with the man.
---
Yeah, its for licensed characters
---
I CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO LEVEL UP NURSE ON CONSOLE

---
Why would you be cleansing all 5?
---
As a pig main, I am ecstatic
---
OLD HABITS ARE HARD TO BREAK ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR A WHILE. I SUGGEST YOU YELL "NO" EVERY TIME THEY JUMP FOR THE DOOR HANDLE OR TRY TO USE TO CAT TREATS TO GET THEM TO WALK THROUGH THE HOLE. OR BETTER YET, GET A DOG THAT WILL TEACH EM. ALSO WHY DO I ALWAYS GET SEEN FIRST WHEN I PLAY SURVIVOR? DOES EVERYONE JUST STICK TO WALLS AND HIDE UNTIL THEY SEE SOMEONES GETS HIT? I HATE THAT I LOVE THIS GAME.
---
I never said that the cost of the DLC would be lowered. Not sure where you got that from.
---
That’d be cool
---
Guys maybe you should rethink this interaction.  Usually those who disagree start hurling insults at each other.
---
I agree that it's strange that one costs more than the other, I just think it's funny how people are complaining when they've already undoubtedly bought it.
---
Distraction and maybe boosted struggle.
---
g a r a g e  k i l l e r
---
Haha in ranked reset I like to take it easy but when a survivor t bags I straight tunnel camp him the rest of the game IDC if I depip.
---
The problem with this logic is, unless you are a swf, no way to keep track of how many totems are cleansed. Since swf is frowned upon, it doesn't really make sense. The only supposed "counter" is small game which is a terrible perk. So basically spend all match looking for totems and hope there are no really hidden ones.
---
Why would adrenaline need a counter? Speed boost is temporary and only active immediately after gates powering. If it activated on an unhook, go for the unhooker. They won't have the speed boost. Or just run noed so you can insta down so the health state doesn't matter.
---
I just cringed so hard penis retreated into my body.  Brb, need to see doctor... I mean A doctor, not THE Doctor...
---
It doesn't
---
Trust me sweetheart the game didn't take long at all, btw how many games have you won as survivor against iri head huntress?
---
I think the shrieking sound youre on about is either him stalking you successfully and you're one hit (also shows a skull on right side of screen) or you spotted him and he glows white and you're not one hit. 
---
Be sure to stare at him as you run away to stop his creepy stalker moves 👀
---
His power reduces his terror radius to zero and let's him "stalk" survivors like a low-calorie Michael Myers. When he stalks someone a small guage fills up on their character status (lower left) and exposes the player when it's full. He can lean around corners and crouch like the pig to make himself more stealthy.
---
If a survivor looks directly at him while he is in stealth/stalking mode it starts to "reveal" him, which can be heard through the audio cue. When he is revealed his terror radius returns to normal and his red stain reappears.
---
Like someone else mentioned, Spine Chill is useful against him so you'll know if he's close by when working on a gen. Something to be mindful of is that he can use his power mid-chase to mind game you so it's best to make sure you're aware of where he is.
---
Haha look he's back with another throw away account
---
Where did I say I was buying any cosmetics?
---
Nice, autocorrect. Real nice.
---
It’s best to save your shards for other characters instead of perks because you can unlock those killers and survivors until you get to paid dlc stuff.
---
I must be the only person who struggles against the "old" freddy
---
But survivors have DS and unbreakable, both perks that killers always have to consider when playing.
---
Are you including yourself in the set of “most survivors” here?  I need to know whether I should upvote you or downvote you.
---
me too im getting it constantly
---
ooh okay i never get the skull but tysm
---
I play as Ace so I don't need it.
---
Did it just start for you
---
If they get permission we'll have shirtless Myers within the year
---
Do you even know how noed works?
---
Again thats not what this convo was about, you have to fuck up as a surv to get caught and hooked in the first place, so you did indeed fail and then later get rewarded for it
---
I litterally didnt change Adrenaline from what it is at the moment except adding a counter. If you get no hooks, it treats adrenaline as it is now. Now if you're a good killer, it only provides a weak adrenaline
---
Are you gonna play 2 games at once? 👀
---
I don't, I actually prefer killer in general.  I also refuse to ever use Noed or completely broken add-ons unless I'm against a cunty survivor that I've played against before.  My favorites are trapper and Plague because I don't like playing broken shit like Nurse(nice flair btw) and iri head Huntress lmao.
---
Question, how many games have you won playing against iri head huntress?
---
I believe you mean blendette.
---
Might be a price agreed by with Saw people
---
I personally like The Spirit the best. Her power is great for big brain 200iq moves, and by that I mean I reappear right next to someone by accident and spook both them and myself.
---
Leatherface is good for bbq and chilli

Bravo!

---
Unlucky enough to be caught by the killer? It is not luck. They were outplayed. The killer can be outplayed by the remainder of the team if he chooses to camp after outplaying the running survivor.
---
I hope they introduce breakable fences, so that the killer can just break a door through, in a spot where the survivors can't vault or drop a pallet.
---
Then the problem is solved without having to comb through the algorithm to change long fences.
---
I’m pretty sure he doesn’t lol
---
There's no counter for the unfair perks like Iron Maiden which makes lockers unusable, sloppy butcher which makes getting away from killer impossible, Insidious which makes camping a easy 2k, and Premonition which makes stealth killer useless.
---
You’re telling me it’s perfectly fine for them to jack up the price *just a little bit* so you have to pay $5
---
Also, $10 per skin is perfectly fine for them to make money, people will buy the game, dlc’s, and maybe a few skins. I guarantee they make enough money with that. They don’t need to milk us even harder.
---
If the Saw skins do well, there's definitely more of a chance of Myers cosmetics
---
I’d be fine if it was 15$ flat, but it’s such a small increment it just seems so damn greedy.
---
GOOD in high ranks survivors are blowing through gens in seconds and there is no stopping it. ANYTHING to slow the gen progress is much needed.
---
I think that's the entirety of reddit right there.
---
No? Lol
---
It IS greed when they ramp up the cost for a skin because they saw that people were excited for it. The fact that all other skins in that same category all cost 1080 just proves it.
---
It’s because he already had stalk on you from earlier.
---
Personally I don't like neither of these outfits, only weapons are interesting. But mostly I don't like that you almost never can buy new cosmetics with shards. Just remembering dev's promise to have 80% of store to be available for buying with shards.
---
Ooh, you say the MadPoodle? That guy
---
..
---
I really like the idea of having some sort of tally mark for totems. I also wish survivors could see what their teammates are running, maybe by pressing the touchpad. You could also see who was ahead in points and what addons / items teammates bring in. 
---
Sometimes someone may have a beneficial perk that you’re unaware of; for example someone who may have borrowed time going for the hook saves but can’t communicate that in time before the hooked person gets farmed. 
---
Idk something like that could be nice
---
Maybe you apply gen pressure next time
---
Kono wa... requiem
---
To be fair, Bubbas arent inherently bad, they just never learned how to play.
---
OP said he was hooked right near the  exit gate. If it’s DS tier 3 they either crawl out or get picked up, DS off and walk out. In most situations you will be slugged I agree with that.
---
You can't stun or blind her... so she's for sure S Tier.
---
Lol one of you guys.  Red ranks bud but nice assumption just because it doesn't take me babycrutch and A tier killers to play the game.
---
AAA tysm!! 😭💕
---
Very nice. The bandages are a nice touch
---
It would be better if Pig got a new Mori where she would T Pose and it makes the survivor explode.
---
You don’t have to be here or comment if you don’t like cosplay. Then my content is definitely not for you, buddy! Have a wonderful day! 🖤🥰
---
I play both sides, and if the killer is camping me, i last as long as i can on that hook so my teamates have a real chance at escaping. On the other hand if im a camping killer, im sweating what the hooked survivor’s teamates are doing. If they are gen rushing, i likely lost because i camped. If they are all going for the unhook, im in a favorable position. This is strategy.
---
It’s a perk that rewards a failure (getting hooked)
---
Thanks! I had a lot of fun colouring them ;0
---
Deliverance and spine chill are both a waste in my opinion. If other survivors don’t know you have it they will still run for the save
---
Borrowed Time is not just an anti-camp or tunnel perk because people will hook bomb with it all the time often with DS to save themselves, speaking of which...
---
Decisive Strike is not just an anti-tunnel perk because the timer is so long. 60 seconds is enough time to get unhooked, have someone else be hooked while the killer left you alone, and go in for a hook dive without being punished because if the killer picks you up that's a free five second stun. It's also really easy to try to force   
---
a DS or force the killer to leave you alone. Decisive Strike was a nerf only for the one person who got to be the obsession; for everyone else in the match it was a buff. 
---
Dead Hard can still be used to continue loops that you otherwise could not continue, even if the killer does not go for the swing. That's what makes it more useful than the swing dodging, being able to get to that window or pallet safely that you otherwise could not. 
---
Not all the hex perks are even that powerful. Third Seal comes to mind.
---
NOED has counterplay and ways to disable the perk. Adrenaline does not. So people who compare Adrenaline to NOED in order to defend Adrenaline are a detrimental their own argument
---
I agree in general dcing is cancer, but I will dc every game against iri head huntress until it's nerfed.  If it's never nerfed, then I'll never stop dcing.  Completely unfun to play against and if you're playing against a Huntress that at least knows how to drool on the keyboard you're never going to win.  It's a game that's meant to be fun and iri head is far from fun to play against.
---
Ty!
---
Either that or Claudette has been recently hooked. The only time they drop immersion is when they want to use DS.
---
Ty 💕💕
---
Laughing so hard I’m crying at this.

Awesome! Thanks!😃 Excited to try the new Freddy lmao
---
not even gonna lie I’m bout to start a series where I just post pictures of triggered pig mains
---
Tbh. She can mori me any day 🌚
---
Thank you! 🐽🖤
---
Like literally why tho. I'm not against it (it's just annoying and I had the cells to spare) but I really don't get why the Biker Pig set costs like a dollar more, especially since Amanda Pig costs the regular amount.
---
Is it the weapon? I know the weapon has custom sounds (bought it and am loving it) but then the weapon should be the only one that costs more, right? I don't think the body or the mask are really worth that much extra.
---
🖤🖤🖤
---
BoNeS
---
If you give me two easy kills where i have to do nothing to get them then YOU were the one playing stupid.
---
I really want there to be a way to track how many totems have been cleansed.
---
Never once listened to music while playing DBD lol.  Use my ears so I can tell where Huntress is coming from amirite?!  I doubt you've ever won a game against an iri head huntress.  I doubt you have many games as survivor at all.
---
There are skins that cost like 600 cells thus making you have to move up to pay $10 instead of $5. Behavior also doesn't publish the game, thus they have obligations to publishers and often publishers dictate the price of DLC.
---
Pennywise wouldn't work because It is an ancient cosmic evil. The Entity wants to feed and to be entertained; it doesn't want another mysterious creature to compete for its front row seat.
---
I ain’t gonna buy it. It almost costs as much as the game itself. It ain’t worth it simply because the blade spins and makes noise. I wouldn’t have an issue if it was priced at a flat 15$ in auric cells, but it’s such a small difference it has too be deliberate.
---
Adrenaline is powerful no doubt and a change maybe wouldn't be a bad thing. But if you have played survivor without swf you know that more often than not your teammates aren't very good, even at high ranks. Wasting time in a close match to look around the map for totems or totem remains is a loss. Especially with hoe common dcs are. I get what your'e saying about uncertainty and the mind game of totems and noed, but the perk pretty much rewards killers for losing the match just like decisive would reward survivors for getting downed. Too many times, has a close 2k match been turned into 4k for a bad killer because of noed. With all the QoL changes for killers, I really don't see why noed is a must keep perk, especially if it is primarily used by bad killers. Just my thoughts.
---
I'd just have the blocks make the passive sleep cycle faster. It'd be more useful than the current blocks and it'd be similar to how they worked with OG Freddy where they cut the dream transition shorter.
---
they can charge whatever they want for it, if you don't want it or like the price then don't get it. At the end of the day it is just a cosmetic, you don't need it to play the game.
---
YOU DONT HAVE TO PLAY LEGION TO RUN DISCORDANCE
---
There is no communication in solo queue, so you have no idea how many totems are cleansed by your teammates. It's a waste of time to cleanse 1-4 dull totems, if the last one is still going to be NOED.
---
Silly one but I kinda hate how neglected the Urban Legends Killer has become in horror.  The first flick was super fun.  The subsequent flicks not so much, although the ice bath scene in the second one was intense.
---
Like people below me said, he doesn’t rely on sight and can be used to block locations, + his perks are really good.
---
Yeah, that was my point. People who only play killer get mad about these types of behaviors in the same way they claim only survivors do.
---
You can pretty much loop a Tier I Mirror Myers infinitely with some of the pallets. It can’t be done with Tier II Mirror Myers but IIRC he still has a slightly slower movement speed.
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?

The skin cost more because it has a special weapon and sound.

Not just cause people are excited.

WHAT IS WITH THE FUCKING MATCHMAKING? WHY AM I GETTING PUT IN GAMES AGAINST RANK 15 SURVIVORS AS A LITERAL RANK 20 KILLER?
---
I KNOW, THAT'S WHY I'M SLAMMING MY FACE AGAINST MY KEYBOARD TO UNLOCK IT FOR MY BRO GHOSTFACE

It's not a fixed curve, but tiers are usually groups. If 1 student got a 105% (extra credit), 3 got 97%, another 3 got 92%, 4 more got 86%, 3 more got 83% and the last 2 got 80%, thats 6 clear groups. Which means S tier, A tier, B tier, C tier, D tier, and F tier. Sure, everyone is good, but there's enough distance between S and F tiers that if your goal is 100%, you'd like to stay away from anything below B.

What’s wrong with the enduring and spirit fury combo?
---
Last night there was a knock at my door. As I walked down the stairs the door burst open and a bunch of software developers in witty t-shirts burst into my foyer. They quickly grabbed my family, my dog, and the ashes of my grandparents on the urn. One of them looked at me on the stairs as they departed and dropped a cell phone and ran.  
---
Seconds later, just as I recovered from shock, the cell phone rang. A raspy voice was on the line "BUY THE PIG COSMETICS OR YOU'LL NEVER SEE YOUR FAMILY AGAIN".
---
What movie/show is this from?
---
I main Pig and I ain’t buying that shit.  I worked my ass off  to 3rd prestige her (I used ALL add-ons before leveling up prestige 1 and all useful offerings before second and third prestige) and I ain’t throwing all that in the garbage for an overpriced cash grab.  Then again, I have only bitched twice in the past 4 months about the new costume including this comment, so...
---
I don’t know I just found the template
---
I've had that too, a guy told me to finish my chases and some curse insult, I forget what.
---
Like some kind of Suicide Squad.
---
It’s not up to bvhr
---
Nah. Enjoy what you want.
---
Leatherface
---
I don't even do this for the win, or kills, or anything.
---
I just have to make sure it still causes insta DC's, then I go afk if anyone stays in. 
---
It does.
---
I think also its because NOED is a reward for doing badly in the game
---
Cleansing totems really isn't that much of a timewaster or what leads to losses for the survivor, though. I play both solo and with a friend or two at higher ranks, and I always cleanse the totems. Never has that been the cause of death, if anything it has saved us plenty of times because the killer was running NOED and it did not go off. Generators can be done quickly, even if not done with 100% efficiency, so cleansing totems does not make much of a difference. 
---
NOED might reward killers for not getting kills earlier, but it also punishes survivors for not doing side objectives. If totems weren't even a thing you'd see all the generators be done in 3-4 minutes every single match. 
---
I don't think players being bad or D/Cs are a good reason to nerf something, either.
---
Buying them regardless........
---
This is obviously a joke, it is marked as a shitpost after all . Thanks for the downvote.
---
You are a really good salt bait tho, you have negative karma and not a single thing you ever Said in Reddit had a positive upvot
---
It’s not your fault. It’s just toxic survivors who are salty they lost. Report and ignore it, and if it gets bad, record it and send it too BHVR support.
---
ITT: A lot of survivors cry because killers are intended to kill people.
---
Nobody here cares. Bye.

Yeah opinions ain't facts. To each their own.

I bet he's listening to his own music while he's killing her
---
I understand the joke. It was just not a good one
---
Some say he’s still flying too this day.
---
Wow the assumptions here. I never downvoted nor upvoted you, don’t get your panties in a twist.
---
I did it last night when I was playing LF. To be fair the rank reset just happened but having an Insta down is way better than having to wait 7 seconds to hit someone. I'd argue its better than most M1 killers powers
---
What exactly are you arguing here? You realize you're just aggressively agreeing with him? His opinion is that they didn't price it appropriately and so he won't be buying it, and your response is OH YEAH WELL IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT DON'T BUY IT. So we're all on the same page then?
---
Deppresed? Dont be sad you are so thicc
---
I see bitching and made up rules from both sides on this sub, and I see both sides adhere to them for whatever reason (shit sometimes I do too). I have the impression that survivors are more vocal about them, I could be wrong.
---
I don’t wear panties.
---
Claudette’s Prestige 3 (P3) skin is really hard to see because the clothing is dark and spattered with blood, so she has built in camouflage. The stereotype is that P3 Claudettes are either the most immersed or most toxic players, though YMMV.
---
I love when this happens, because then I know they’re gonna be salty when I kill everyone else and then them after the match.
---
It’s called being “bait” folks, not “a rodeo clown”
---
That’s not ok either, they should either change their prices, or change they way we buy AC’s
---
FUCKING FINALLY

ever since those leaks i've been waiting.

---
Against any killer that isnt spirit or nurse, yes its on you to fuck up and get caught by the killer, if you understand map tiles and how deadzones are created and how to avoid them you could literally run any other killer for the time it takes 3 other survivors to do 5 gens + open 2 exit gates. Also the convo was about being rewarded for messing up, which decisive is directly that. Also i got the rank1 achievement for both killer and surv back before nurse was even added and stayed rank1 since, but nice try. Also dont compare me to tru3 i dont wanna be associated with that community.
---
Sloppy Butcher, BBQ&amp;Chili, Ruin, and Nurse's Calling is a pretty meta build.  
---
Since you don't have Ruin, and it isn't a necessity on Spirit, I recommend Discordance, Deerstalker(if you slug a lot), or Make Your Choice as a substitute.
---
I want “bones” to be the next meme here too, yes
---
Survivor perks don't rely on totem so yea there is no way to disable it. If this proposed nerf was made to adrenaline, it would be an anti-slugging perk like unbreakable. Very situational and very worthless. What I am suggesting is that you don't nerf yet another survivor perk into the ground. Both sides can have good perks, it's okay dude.
---
In regards to hook bombing, I see no way to prevent that other than removing the only anti-tunneling/anti-camping tools at survivors disposal. It is supposed to be difficult to play killer. 4 kills is a GREAT match for a killer. Not standard. 4/5 of the player base is survivors so repeated nerfing is not the best idea, especially with all the nerfs to looping that have been rolled out and with upcoming ones.
---
If that was the case, they should have just made the weapon UR at like, 500 Cells, and left the rest of the outfit at 400 a piece.
---
Unfortunate to have to wait a week for the other pig skin, the one im more excited about

**qUaLiTy cOnTeNt pOsT**

Another boring bullshit Them vs Us meme post. (aka poor mans karma farming)
---
It's a fucking computer game, if you get annoyed with how others play, then switch off and go have a cry wank or something.
---
I don't get it
---
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THE RANDOMS YOU'RE PLAYING WITH DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT LITERALLY ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS ACTIVATE THE FUCKING GENERATORS.  IT'S LIKE THEY'RE FUCKING TERRIFIED OF THE GENS.
---
AND THE KILLER IS A FUCKING FACECAMPER WHO WON'T LEAVE THE HOOK, BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL DIE ANYWAY, BECAUSE YOUR TEAM IS GOING TO FAIL.
---
Of course we get issues when piggys outfits drop :(
---
Ummm... What? 10$ for a full skin set is a pretty fair price, especially if you play a certain killer alot.
---
The games not over till you cross that escape line. Just because all the gens are done doesn’t mean the killer is any less deadly. NOED existing creates a certain dread that would otherwise not be there and just make the open gate phase into a sort of victory lap for survivors
---
The people that do that are pathetic really.
---
If you want to complain, actually go through with it. I’m not supporting BHVR on this
---
Why complain about it and call the devs greedy. The point of these is to make money in the end of the day, I'm not disagreeing with your stance on refusing to buy it, you're allowed to do that.
---
it costs too much for a cosmetic, oh no, have you seen the store since it's release? Hell have you seen cosmetic stores in other games which are a LOT worse?
---
I hope I never have you on my team, you should have been doing the Gen that entire time to pull aggro, and if he doesn't you get more progress on the Gen. Hiding when someone is being chased when you're fully healed is the ultimate shit teammate.
---
Look I’m happy they keep giving us cosmetics but for the love of god can you stop making 97% of all your new cosmetics only purchasable with auric cells holy shit
---
You too?
---
Yup. Because it made me laugh :)
---
Sounds like a personal problem
---
FINALLY....damn long wait 😂
---
Behaviour publishes the game, stop saying nonsense. They bought the full rights to the game one or two years ago.
---
The fact that it is phrased poorly is because my english isnt that good and nor my native language. i tried to get my point across as good as possible without sound too biased.
---
I get that spending money on the game is not an argument for not being banned. 
---
Also, yes 99% of players hate cheaters, i just wanted to get my enchanced hat across to the reader as someone who was in a similiar situation once before.
---
Kinda new, are any of these worth getting?
---
Okay, then dont run them both. That's you're fault. And they arent equal. Noed can be countered by cleansing all dull totems, adrenaline has not counter
---
I POLITELY ASKED A SURVIVOR NOT TO TEABAG ON XBOX HE INSTEAD TOLD EVERYONE TO TEABAG AND TOLD ME TO KMS
---
This is great good work! :)
---
leatherface is f tier, maybe legion too
---
Epic has the decency of giving us a way to get the currency without paying any buck. Behaviour is too greedy for that.
---
I CANT GET ON AS KILLER OR SWF BECAUSE DBD IS TRYING TO TELL ME I HAVE NO INTERNET DESPITE BEING IN A PARTY CHAT AND IM BEING KIED TO MY FACE. Playing as survivor works fine tho
---
I see Spirit I like
---
This is scary
---
Because your playing on PS4
---
Balancing with a learning curve is for PvE games, not PvP. The survivors are not AI bots. They're real people on the other side of the screen who also want a fair shot at winning the game. If a character is made so powerful that they are unbeatable once perfected, then other players have to lose against them every time, regardless of their skill or the time and effort they put into the game.
---
A lot of things can be made to work on Spirit, imo, but some good perks include: Pop Goes The Weasel, BBQ + Chili, Sloppy Butcher, Discordance, Save The Best For Last, Hex: Devour Hope, Make Your Choice.
---
I understand, what I am saying is that noed hurts the most in close matches. The matches when it is all you can do to get 5 gens. Then noed pops and a good match for a killer turns into automatic win. Yea, you can steamroll bad killers and just do totems on your free time. That luxury isn't there against difficult killers. You are talking about swf groups. Never have i solo queued or even 2 stacked and had all gens pop in 3 minutes. Never. If a killer allows that, especially against a non-swf, they are very bad.
---
Wait, so a game could take more than 8 minutes then? 
---
What a travesty.
---
Some games you have no say in how many gens get done. Either you are playing a killer that can hang with the best survivors, or you are not and have to play the endgame. 
---
If the team is expert, you HAVE to face adrenaline, as long as they don't majorly Fuck up.
---
You're going to call it autistic when you complained about exhaustion perks not working together?
---
Freddy was never F tier...Pig, Doc....now that's F tier
---
I wouldn’t consider it a worse QnQ, since it has no cool down you can hide multiple times into lockers to hide from bbq
---
What is the point of this add on?
---
LOL thanks
---
5 gens being completed /= bad killer. If the survivors are good enough it’ll sometimes just happen (not that there’s anything wrong with that)
---
THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING TO ME ALL DAY AS WELL.
---
Good job lad
---
Deny mcote those $5
---
I mean, one person told me to "actually slit my wrists" bc I was "tryharding"
---
Non-mobility killers are easy to complete generators against quickly, especially on certain maps like Mother's Dwelling, and the vast majority of the killers in the game are non-mobility killers. The only times you do not have the time to cleanse totems are matches where you would have died before the endgame anyways, in my experience. 
---
If NOED pops on you as often as you sound like it does, then you are not cleansing totems, even during matches when you have time too, and it is your fault. Keep in mind, I do not run NOED ever and I am saying this, so it's not like my opinion comes from using the perk. Heck I use Adrenaline as well because it's a really, really good perk, doesn't mean I don't think it needs to be nerfed.
---
They are a company that needs to make money for development resources
---
So you are saying you can't handle items and loops... bruh.
---

---
Vegeta: He’s speaking the language of the Gods
---
Wasn't aggressive at all lol. More like a form of sarcasm but interpret it how you will. 
---
Limiting borrowed time seems like a good idea, but it's not. Still doesn't stop hook bombs.
---
Reducing cooldown on decisive? Punishes sudvivors who can loop for a little after unhooks and can still not ounish tunneling. I agree the perks can punish killers in ways they shouldn't but your suggestions don't exactly seem fair or effective at least to me. I think camping and tunneling itself needs to be examined and reworked so that such perks aren't necessary.
---
Spirit, if you think you'll be bad with her, get Plague
---
Or instaheal them
---
oh, they're earmuffs.
---
but to each their own interpretation, i could get why you'd think they're earphones. (the little false notes next to them is Mookle humming, but this works too) 🙌
---
Thanks for tip.
---
One of the remaining dull totems will become a hexed Noed totem once all the gens are done, so in order to counter it people want to do all of the dull totems before gens are finished.
---
Pig isn’t d tier
---
he was never F tier but k...
---
weird flex but okay... I guess... ?
---
&gt;:(
---
It looks like you combined the Pig head from the other new outfit with the leather outfit.
---
I like.
---
Completely agree with both of these. Such a dumb arguement to say ‘well do totems next time’ because all NOED is at the end of the day is a reward for the killer allowing all the gens to be done. I play both sides equally and I feel NOED is a perk i would never go near. It just makes players feel like they dont have to play the main game that well because they have a second shot at the end. Adrenaline like you said is reward for doing all the gens, whilst NOED is also a reward but for all the wrong reasons of not playing well enough
---
Alex should be a skin for Steve
---
What was being flexed?
---
If you use Noed your trash tho
---
I am. If we support this, we may get more licensed cosmetics in future!
---
You don't have to consider DS if there is no obsession(not common, but still possible) and unbreakable isn't super common and rarely comes into play(maybe only at the end when the survivor is slugging to sweat for a 4k because all hell would break loose if one survivor got hatch)
---
if you gen rush your trash too
---
They really punish you for liking the Pig
---

---
QnQ as it is only has a 20 second Cooldown. I cant imagine you'd need to vault into multiple lockers outside the killers terror radius to avoid BBQ&amp;C more than every 20 seconds...?
---
Bah, I’m not trading supporting money hogging for more cosmetics for them to over charge for
---
Beating the shit out of that strawman I see
---
That only procs if you save a teammate to activate it first... Otherwise it is a wasted perk slot if you get hooked before saving someone...
---
Actually... nvm that part...
---
your post is still garbage
---
Tuning Guide and Doom Engravings, nicknamed Crack Billy, is easily the best combo for Billy when you know how to control it. When you learn how to control the initial turning of the chainsaw sprint you can land some crazy downs with the speed from engravings.
---
Instasaw is a powerful combo for how easy it is to down people with, but Crack Billy will down good survivors far more easier.
---
Ah, now I get what you meant. 
---
Yeah, I guess it would be better to get onto the point that they switched their reasoning while working on my case.
---
I already did screenshots of the conversions, in the case someone wanted to see proof
---
Spirit is the only one that I get jump scares from. I wish I could here the screams when I reappear behind someone who is oblivious on a gen
---
If you weren’t sure about Freddy’s pedophilia, there’s zero doubt now.
---
fair point
---
It’s main use is to not make you waste time by rushing actions without problems. Hiding in lockers it’s just a secondary use
---
That was a very creative solution. I also think that your shirt blended in very well with the environment lol
---
Well thats what p3 claudettes do . Nothing ! Except being useless foreheads that wanna rub their Victory into Killer main faces.
---
Not toxic, just meta. Some people hate meta builds as they're seen as "sweaty".
---
The fact that her other set is worth 1080, as well as 2 Tapp's sets disproves your point.
---
NOED should be reworked in a similar vein to Devour, you have to earn your instadowns, although maybe have it something maybe having to do with gen regression or something like that.
---
okay :)
---
Stridor and Whispers are such legit sleeper perks
---
I think most sane people would agree that the Nurse doesn't have a good spot in a hypothetical perfectly balanced game. If changes were made to make base gen times longer and loops overall less safe, something like a decent Nurse with good add-ons would be blatantly unfair and need to be changed.
---
Damn.

no thats noed

I JUST GOT HOOKED 3 SECONDS AGO MEG.  THE KILLER IS STILL HERE.  WHY DID YOU COME OUT OF HIDING AND FUCKING LOOP HIM **AROUND THE HOOK** UNTIL I DIED?
---
Spirit. She’s very fun and all about mind games.
---
Took me a solid 5 minutes before I realized there wasn't a streamer named MadPoodle who I was unaware of
---
so?
---
How does Adren counter NOED? NOED is a one-down...
---
im cool 😎😎😎😎😎
---
Perhaps they are charging more for what they see as the most popular, so they don't have to for the others?
---
Lol, MadPoodle is not Pussers in case you're wondering
---
Can we get an F in the chat lads? 😔
---
Which is funny cause I'm a P3 claudette but reformed. I have a billion toolboxes cause I usually loop the killers with instas or flashlights.
---
😂💕
---
Thanks ;3
---
Hold up I am retarded as fuck rn, who was the survivor supposed to be?
---
You still broke
---
Never once said exhaustion perks should work together. That would be op af. I am saying the healing from adrenaline will prevent dead hard in cases where staying injured would be more beneficial such as one shot killers.
---
He was so spot on with this.
---
Fucking whiner survivors and their shit rules.  This game would be so much better if they couldn't type in post-game chat, but the killer could.  It'd make it a bit better to be able to tell them what I thought of them without getting some stupid rule thrown back in my face.  
---
We've only been hearing the same shit about these rules for 2 years now. It's about time it was brought to the light and made fun of.  
---
Fuck survivors.
---
Yea if you buy save the world or don't spend your vbucks which is only gotten during the duration of the battle pass plus skins are the main focus(for many) of fortnite which is why they do that while the skins are optional and not a big thing in dbd I personally think BHVR isn't that bad with their store. if they were greedy why would that allow you to earn all of the unlicensed killers and survivors?
---
Soo... are you Nea or Meg?
---
Very well done, considering it was with your finger lol. You are very talented!
---
Yes pls hugs
---
The full addon reads

"Evil Within II reveals Survivors' Auras when stalking within a range of 16 metres.

---
So it gives you wallhacks which is great on lery's or small indoors maps because you can see everyone and gengrab them(You don't have terror radius) but absolutely terrible on red forest because you can't gengrab people since they always see you too soon (The red forest thing is the joke OP is making, it's not part of the add on as you can see)
---
Calcium or Sodium.
---
Make your choice!
---
yea but what though? His outfit doesn't change much. There was one time where he had long hair and like a paper mask, but it wasnt for long

And then you don't even end up piping

👀
---
A bit of both?? 😂💀

🤗
---
All i can see is leaves...
---
Just imagine all you could do with adrenaline and Divine Aid
---
Why would we care though? You have a lot of solutions,use one of them
---
also, when he's crouching he doesn't have the red stain
---
Lol yeah but thankfully I got the daily I needed so I'll take win
---
lol no
---
That must hurt a lot more than a clean cut
---
Name checks out
---
Tier lists in real competitive games are based on quantifiable data gathered from tournament results. They aren't gut checks. Dead by Daylight is a bit of a different beast, but there are definable factors that we can use to gauge a character's efficiency (speed and map pressure, options during chases, ability to locate survivors, etc.).
---
With enough time, most people would be able to reach red ranks just from black pips and single pips. You can see this already in effect, as the closer you get to reset, more and more noticeably worse survivors and killers start appearing in red ranks than just after the reset.
---
Ea bad. Free licensed cosmetics good.
---
I was playing tombstone myers so i equipped noed and dying light and forgot to change them next game, i was suprised to see that i wasted 2 perk slots, fast forward to exit gates opened, there were two Kates that gen rushed me hard(they litterly only did gens, didn't unhook anyone which resulted in them being the last two survivors.) They are t-bagging me at the exit gate, i walk up and down them instantly.
---
Still... probably won't use it again on him.
---
Probably just to stretch profits a bit. Nothing wrong with that though
---
Ah yes the law of equivalent exchange in action
---
And it's pretty funny when she finally goes for a save only to find out she used up all of her flashlight trying to get your attention
---
To be fair i always use borrowed time so i am entitled to farm
---
Noed doesn't pop on me often because i fear it and cleanse the totems. Like i have already stated, the problem with noed is when it is a close match with a good killer where it is all that you can do to pop the gens. Then noed is a guaranteed win.
---
Basically me.
---
If you want points, leatherface for bbq and doctor are ideal. Doc just gets a lot of points in matches with his power. If you want a good killer, spirit is probably the best one that isn’t free, and she’s still really fun
---
Agree with them  increasing the price because it was seen as more popular, and thus greed got the upper hand. Disagree with them increasing the price for that cosmetic price so they wouldn't have to for the other sets, that's just stupid, there's no guarantee people will buy the cosmetic with a higher price to make up for the decrease in others, so no, it's just BHVR being greedy cunts.
---
Also, I just remembered another thing, when the developer build was leaked along with Tapp's and Pig's cosmetic, all of them were worth 1080, so it must be the fact that BHVR saw how everyone loved the leather jacket cosmetic, so they decided to make a profit on that.
---
No, this is patrick.
---
i would love to throw a pallet at you and see if you'll do cute noises too :3
---
Simple nobody does
---
LITERALLY JUST WAIT 2 SECONDS AT THE EXIT UNTIL IM ACTUALLY HOOKED SO CAN USE MY DELIVERANCE THEN BOLT OUT THAT BITCH
---
I only see corn wtf (Amazing art btw ❤️)
---
If you *need* to believe that iri huntress is a magically unbeatable killer than I'll let you keep that dream even though it's only that: A dream.

yeah, no I won't, I'm a pig main and won't spend 30 bucks on only one skin
---
or the Open the exit gate with this character that you havent even touched
---
but good luck
---
The fact that adrenaline counters an entire playstyle makes it an op perk. I run it, and I play against it. I've seen both sides, and its definetly OP. It may not be old MoM op but its definetly OP. It needs a true counter
---
Yeah, Umbra won't use them unless you pay her. Even then, she won't like it. Not that she needs them in any way to get downs.
---
Weird
---
Doesn't really make sense for the perk and quick and quiet is already a thing. Now if you want to make it so lightweight silences your footsteps on top of what it already does then that'd be a nice buff to it.
---
Halloween 2018 had a decrepit mask, different coveralls, and a different knife.
---
Does this make me one of these worse players...
---
as if they don't release a new dlc every three months and other 1080 ac cosmetics every week
---
I like a lot of your changes but I think your nerfs to the meta survivor perks are too harsh. Especially considering how many meta perks have already been nerfed.
---
These posts are way over saturated by this point and should be automod'd
---
yayy more 30 bucks cash grabs so fun
---
Throw in an insta heal and you'd probably see some crazy plays. I tried my best to add enough restrictions to it so it's not an instant grab that will cause killers to pull their hair out every match.
---
(≧▽≦) lmao
---
Sounds fine to me as long as you contribute. Do the gens. Help unhook when safe and heal others! 
---
At higher ranks the entire team may need to take turns being chased, so if everyone is on death hook, take one for the team and loop about.
---
Ty ;0
---
No it gives you lightbringer points
---
I think it’s a bug because on mobile it’s 1080 auric cells
---
It’s lightbringer points. Gen progress while you are in a chase is added to that but that’s as close as it gets. It tells you in your stats post game.
---
Wow very nice thanks for sharing
---
BECAUSE THE ENTITY IS DISPLEASED.
---
Then good luck catching this tbag bouncing booty!
---
I mean I may as well go all in if I’m gonna get pallet stunned :’3 
---
I’m really good at high pitch voices/noises so it would be nemas problemas 😎
---
Nah people do. It’s more of a low rank perk though.
---
Calm spirit is suppose to quiet the crows. The amount depends on the tier of the perk.
---
It’s a Mori
---
Thats why you run ruin kinda mandatory
---
Damn, that was lucky.
---
What's your Instagram so I can follow you
---
Guys I’m pretty sure it’s a bug because on mobile it’s 1080 auric cells
---
because that way you have to buy two different bundles or one twice as expensive as the 1080 ac one
---
You clearly haven't watched any F13th match in a public lobby.
---
Chilling laughter is honestly a ehh perk cause you have stuff like contagious scream that does it better
---
ideal_mori ! 💕
---
I know but u dont have to counter cause crouching isnt startling the crows
---
Thank you! ^ ^
---
Only bad survivors do that.
---
Against a good looper they will never drop the pallet if you start revving to make them drop it.
---
These are so vibrant!!
---
DAMN he THICC
---
Bamboozle is a must have on legion in my opinion. If you're going for an anti loop build with legion bamboozle, enduring, I'm all ears (to track even in your ability) brutal strength. But I always have bamboozle on, I'll sometimes exchange pop goes the weasel on my main build for I'm all ears that way at window loops and with my ability active I still have the upper hand
---
Most of the time they will still have NOED
---
Its not like im gonna or even can deny other players from playing the way i want them to. And that was not even my intention.
---
I just stated that in my opinion noed is a bit of an overkill with those characters since they already have the instadown capability. And the slot could be utilized so much better with a perk that affects them the whole game while their saw or whatever it is works as a way to punish foolish play. For example if a player misses a window in a loop and billy gets the down.
---
When i find myself playing survivor i do usually smirk when i notice those killers using it, not because im necessarily mad at them "for using a crutch" but because i find it just not necessary.
---
Yeah I thought it would be but I still like the idea of something similar but being on demand
---
omfg 😂☠️
---
A skilled huntress that takes iri is unbeatable, that's the truth.  Sure there might be some iri huntress that someone could live against, maybe I could live against them.  However, is that experience going to be fun for me or any other survivor?  No.  I'd rather just instantly disconnect and discourage the Huntress from using them to begin with.  I'm sorry that you're a killer main that has never had to experience iri head huntress =/
---
I do feel like it should give you bold points
---
M’yes! I’ve done that in game actually ;3
---
I did actually talk to my boyfriend about how I feel my mask was kinda looking like one of the new outfit’s mask. I do have to admit I feel really happy with the result! ^ ^ thank you!
---
That horrifying sound when a gen completes and then another one right after
---
Dicking around, having chases, annoying the killer as much as you can with different shit, trying to use up every 2nd chance perk in one match to make the killer think "come the fuck on"
---
Either way, love Myers face in the last panel. Looks so smug with himself. Great job 👍
---
The packs go perfect together.
---
*running spirit fury* do it coward
---
Now this is an actual hostage situation
---
but could be good for immersed players if you know their nearby and make it where if you use the perk and does not work it uses the token but if it does work it lights up similar to whispers
---
Kinda yes, if the poor person that’s juking is on there last hook maybe you should get the killer on you and give them so more time as you can be hooked 2 times and they can’t
---
Sometimes you just have to abandon a chase if you can tell it will be a huge time sink.
---
Oh weird. I'm confused because every time I cleanse a dull totem, [this icon](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems#Evader) pops on with a +600BP notification.
---
swf
---
yeah I've been getting this too starting today
---
same thing for me rank 11 bunch of rank 16s - 20s
---
😱
---
As a mostly new player, what is this?
---
It counters it in the sense of getting distance from the killer right when noed is activated. Has saved me plenty of times against noed.
---
I think it should be reworked to remove the instadown concept, whilst still giving the killer the chance for a second wind. Almost like for example keeping the speed boost and adding in a reduced cooldown on attacks (something significant), rather than the ability to instadown
---
I’d break my Jontron soundboard
---
IMO there are a lot more and better ways to find survivors than spies. BBQ and chili is a God tier killer perk for finding people anywhere on the map. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve killed survivors when they were no where that I would have first expected. Tinkerer is good, thrill of the hunt, discordance, etc... the list goes on. 
---
Spies isn’t that great for finding people. 
---
If you want a good perk for keeping track of a sneaky killer, use spine chill. It will light up when they are close and looking your way. As a bonus, when it’s active, you gain increased speed for repairs and stuff like that! Just get good with skillchecks cause you’ll get more of them. 
---
Premonition gives too big of an angle so you don’t know directly where they are, plus it has a cool down. It’s not nearly as good as spinechill. 
---
Use your camera more and keep an eye on every angle especially while behind cover. It will boost your gameplay a ton.

I feel you I got put in a swf where I was the same rank as the lowest player, 14, and their highest player was a rank 3. I managed to kill the rank 3 but I think she just willingly sacrificed herself for her friends
---
So it doesn't help against spies?
---
This entire sub needs a mod wipe
---
Possibly. Things are subject to change. I've changed around stats, descriptions, and numbers in my other chapters as balance stuff popped into my head so the same will probably happen here at some point.
---
It gives you Boldness Bloodpoints but cleansing a totem gives you points in the Lightbringer Emblem towards pipping, as it’s an objective.
---
can i ask how you did the 3d looking effect? the drawing looks great!
---
No, getting hooked, chased or found is not a failure on the survivor side. Failing to do gens is.
---
You need some Shock Therapy or Punishment
---
is it a specific survivor perk for example: claudette?
---
Amazing
---
Isn't it full of 12 year olds that scream when they get caught?
---
Hag has more map presence than Mike or GF. She's known for her power in shutting down loops too. I always thought she was A tier if not right under Billy.
---
Guess I'm wrong though.
---
I waiting for her facial expression to snap 😅
---
Good job!
---
***Doing gens, you?***
---
You aren't leaning and crouching enough, you're trying to play him like every other killer, he is no Myers, you can't stalk in the open, you have to hide from survivors. When you approach a generator make sure you see the entire generator's aura, that means it's blocked entirely by whatever wall. If the generator is in a cornfield with no cover but visual cover, go for a grab. And do not EVER stalk without leaning, leaning makes the stalk go way faster. In the end he's an ambush killer so treat him like that, hide from the survivors, play him like a stealth game, check your corners, crouch when you're in the open.
---
Luck doesn't mean too much at the moment unless your whole team's stacking it. If they do, you'll notice a massively increased chance to get off the hook and better items appearing in your chests.
---
Making him effectively F Tier again
---
Ghostface
---
that's what playing freddy like an m1 killer is
---
freddy is actually much better when played right
---
Leatherface's instadown is easier, Plague has even easier one(just tap m1, because nobody cleanses). He is good so to face him you have to be a good survivor. But if you are a good survivor he can't do shit about loops, which makes him automatically not broken...
---
[on my country's store where 1188 ac means I either have to spend 21.80 on 1110ac + 10.90 on 500ac for the skin or 43.60 on 2250](http://prntscr.com/oggtc0)
---
No, the survivors are supposed to clense totems, end of story.
---
The killer is running at 75% perks, with the tradeoff that he's gambling that the survivors will not clense and he'll get dramatically more powerful at the endgame. He's backloading his power while risking never getting that boost if the survivors clense.
---
Lol this happened with me sort of. I had a SWF who were way better than me and they were tea bagging me and flahslighting stunning me, gen rushing me, everything. Last gen pops and I got one of them down with NOED. They all try to save him so I get another of them down and another. Finally one last person up and she's opening the gate. I get her down too. Then I just let them all crawl out the gate because they were good and deserved it (despite tea bagging me smh)
---
&gt; Which is basically only ever relevant if you're camping lol, which I mentioned in my original comment. 
---
From my experience it's far from only use of area attack. And I sometimes return to the hook to check it, but mostly I prefer mobile killer plays.
---
&gt;with Billy you can tap the chainsaw to keep it partially revved
---
Billy looses speed too because of that. He mainly needs to do that to create some danger to the area or if he plans to aim better, but with LF you just have no use of partial revving (apart from facecamping ofc). You just rev it when you're close enough and there are no pallets/windows and it's almost guaranteed.
---
This hit different
---
As a fellow owner of a giraffe neck, I love it &lt;3 really gorgeous work.
---
Haha when I first started playing I would smack survivors on the hook because I thought it killed them faster. Now I just feel like shit looking back lol
---
JUST STAY IN THE FUCKING GAME.
---
YOU GOT HOOKED, BOOHOO, SOMEONE WILL SAVE YOU. DONT FUCKING KILL YOURSELF. 
---
YOU GOT DOWNED. BOO-FUCKITY-HOO. YOU HAVE A TEAMMATE WHO HASNT BEEN HOOKED AND CAN ATTEMPT AN ESCAPE.
---
OR BETTER YET, JUST NEVER START A FUCKING GAME IF YOU WONT STAY AROUND 3 GODDAMN MINUTES IN.
---
I run Premonition for both him and Myers. It helps a lot with other killers too though.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cehzhl/empty_bloodweb_node_is_this_a_bug_is_there_a_fix/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
In this video I'm not surprised it hit, it should have because Claudette mid-vaulted and Myers had longer lunge in tier 3, so being away from the window wouldn;t matter
---
I remember Dead Space 2 actually did something REALLY cool.
---
For the most part, it was Humans VS Necromorphs and the team voice chats were kept seperate.
---
BUT. Whenever a Necromorph would grab onto a Human, their voice chats - just those two players - would LINK. IT lead to many moments where I got to suddenly scream at Human players when I caught them. And lead to many human players playing back with me, screaming about their "wife and family".
---
Fuck me, it was fun. I'd love if Dead By Daylight did something similiar.
---
Increasing effectiveness is directly related to how quickly you can get them to the Broken state.
---
The "standard" way to infect Survivors is to vomit on them directly, but you can trigger the timers by vomming on items that they interact with.
---
Because theres a big difference mate. Getting tunneled is entirely preventable, and is a matter of working together. If you're unhooked without borrowed time, right next to the hook, with the killer right there, you should be punished, or run DS to counter it. NOED being built in isn't to fuck survivors over, its to slow the match a little, and make them look for totems. The goal is only to actually give them another objective, or get punished for not. The killer is the weaker side of DBD at the moment.
---
Her blade spins around
---
But do you consider the fact that the game could have 4 ds and 4 unbreakable against 1 noed. People dont seem to consider that you have to account for 16 perks per match as killer while survivors only has 4, its often also easy to tell if a killer for example runs ruin, bbq, spiritfury/enduring, and alot of other killer perks. so if you pay attention to how the killer plays and what seems unusual to a complete base no perk version of the killer its often easy to narrow down wheneter a killer has an unknown perk that could be noed.
---
That's debatable. I still agree she is A tier though.
---
That’s a fair point.

It's because pre-nerf Legion was totally braindead, and literally anyone could get mileage out of it
---
I've had Legions that swung and missed like 4-5 times while chasing me in frenzy, but they still ended up winning the chase.
---
&gt;new players
---
ive only gotten adepts so far and some other random ones its tracking my wraith surprise hits tho so hopefully that one will work
---
modern problems require modern solutions
---
NOED is a crutch, whenever you have it as a perk you're basically saying "I don't believe in myself enough to get 2-3 kills before the final gen pops." Hate me all you want but I've got a P3 L50 Ace and Wraith so I've felt both ends of the stick and from my point of view NOED is a crutch for bad players.
---
Awesome! I can't wait to cosplay wraith after my leg lengthening surgery is compete
---
Nea has AirPods in she can’t hear us oh fuck oh god
---
thank you so much! 💖💖
---
Best thing you can possibly do is get a better audio setup. The game is about 85% audio, 15% visual.
---
There are perks that can compensate for a less-than-ideal audio setup, but you'll benefit a hell of a lot more with a good headset.
---
i know surv in early days getting rank 1 was a joke, but its more that getting called a rank 20 when being able to hold rank 1 for 3+ years for both roles. Also im not saying that other killers dont play of killer skill, but nurse and spirit are more or less the only ones that you can play the game 100% perfect from the surv pov and still lose.
---
Still remember having such shit perks on michael that I ran noed 2 post-buff where all tiers gi e instadowns, it was either that or monstrous shrine 1
---
This was around level 38 btw
---
Agree
---
The killer is only the weaker side if you're against a lobby of 4 SWF, and even then the killer can easily win if they bring out sweaty perks and add-ons on a sweaty killer.  Find me a single 4 man SWF that could win against Ralph/Umbra/some other Huntress one trick if they decided to use Iri heads and +2 hatchets lmao
---
“Scooby gets rabies”
---
It’s actually me not Nea 😂
---
Only real gamers get Wake Up for only 2000 iridescent shards
---
Rank reset logic is so weird. Everyone got bumped back down lower. All the red rank people are in green purple. Those people are back down in yellow brown. You’re still facing the same people.
---
Nurse #1, followed by Billy and Spirit. Other than that, "best" is whoever the Killer player is good with.
---
Tbh I liked the undercover cop one more, but it's probably because I liked the neck scar and im a huge fan of the first movie
---
I never said people couldn’t buy what they want or enjoy what they want, I just think they’re letting themselves get ripped off
---
This^^. You dont even have to put a totem count up. Just make the same map wide notification and sound when the last totem is cleansed. Survivors won't know it's gone as it could be any number of hexes that were cleansed but on the killer side put a counter on his perk like hex: thrill. That way they would know totems are being worked on and known that the perk was cleansed.
---
I like it!
---
Beat me too it..
---
Apex Legends is horrible for this. I mean, most skins are $15.99 for one, but some will LITERALLY be only 10 more coins than the minimum base pack. It's annoying.
---
But its not the case. You CAN play without Ruin, but theres a reason all the rank ones constantly do. Theres a reason why every "build video" Has you run Ruin. Its rather proven that they do gens too quickly, and theres MANNNNNY videos to support it. Believe what you wish, but NOED is simply a NOT FUN perk. It may not be overpowered, or unfair, but it is unfun, and I feel making it a visible, clear threat, that survivors know is there every time would make it feel less cheap, less frustrating, and much more deserved when you die to it.
---
Wow I can see why people think the nurse is so busted. She looks broken asfuq. Why would you choose any other killer when you have that kind of mobility? I mean I get that she thrives in places with walls and rooms, but that was kinda ridiculous xP
---
No? It counts as if you left a game from your own will and you are getting -2.
---
Was you within heartbeat while unhooking?
---
10 seconds to get bone cleansed? no ill use noed and make them feel my pain
---
I'm a slut for the bloodpoints
---
I've gotten a fair few yoinks with her myself.
---
If you don't agree with the price then don't buy it? I'm sure if everyone takes a stand and no one purchases the skin then it will get a price cut and it won't happen again... But if people buy it anyways is it really a bad move on their part?
---
Or maybe donate it instead? Lol
---
I agree most misplay him hard which is where the whole "noed is a must for freddy came from".  Lots of swf teams give me games simply by showing no respect to Freddy which fucks them over hard.
---
Lol what a ballsy play xD
---
He seems pretty chill in this, especially when u cant see the weird fucking pegs
---
I swear I was prestiging wraith the other day after never playing him since I had the blood points so whatever, boot up the game the next day, see his legs in the survivor/killer menu, fucking scream
---
But either way, thats what OP is saying. Due to HAVING to think about NOED being there, and theres NO WAY to know, and thus you have to dedicate time. Its a unfun perk, a unfun mechanic, and its just frustrating to die to. The changes I reccommend would make it consistant, while still letting it do its job.
---
I tried this
---
They straight up stole David king's scream
---
No it isn't because it removes the counterplay to the perk. A killer knows they don't need to worry about dead hard while someone is vaulting so they know if they are in range they can get the hit. And if they get within that range it was probably either bloodlust, a mistake on the survivor part, or a spirit/nurse.
---
You don't have to dedicate time to cleaning totems. At least try to cleanse 3 totems when going gen to gen and then look for the last 2 when the last gen pops because then there's only 2 possible dulls for NOED to spawn on. "Unfun perk" Killers don't need to care about your fun. "Unfun mechanic" Why don't we just remove the exposed effect altogether? Fixed. "Frustrating to die to" It's always frustrating to die. Doesn't mean killing needs to be nerfed.
---
I went against a 4 man swf before all brought insta heals DS and 2 brought OoO playing nurse. 3 of them were rank 2-5 and they had 1 rank 16 they only got 1 gen done. They didnt say anything in the post game chat because they didnt bully a new killer exploiting swf matchups
---
r/saw
---
It seems like it's a perk. It's most likely just a visual bug.
---
Pretty sure it’s pricey for the reason the the blade has an animation
---
I loved the first movie too, but I like the way this cop outfit looks in game. Just a preference! The neck scar one is dope too!
---
It’s a sells pitch, Quite common tbh.
---
Why does old McCote look cute
---
:(
---
That's not true
---
Also if it is a huntress she can down pretty quickly if she gets a hatchet hit and an M1 swing.
---
Good luck.
---
Imagine salt baiting
---
Honestly I'm really hoping they're planning on letting us auric cells through the rift or dailies soon because it seems like barely anything good is available through shards anymore. I get that these are licensed but hopefully this isn't an early warning sign of rising prices.
---
This for sure, also happy cake day.
---
In the same way that a killers job is to apply pressure throughout the match, it is the survivors job to cleanse totems throughout match. You can’t ignore totems all game then complain when it comes back to hurt you.
---
I mean she was only running Territorial Imperative plus Lullaby.
---
Look dude I know you’re trying to help but I’m 100% certain it’s a bug and not a terror radius thing.
---
Spy!
---
I put all the bloodpoints to get my new Freddy to lvl 5, played a game as him, came back to check out the PIg web and...  
---
I've been bumped to lvl 41 lol. It would be cool if I hadn't been grinding my pig to unlock make your choice on everyone..
---
I was in the game with him. I was on hook and he grabbed me off as soon as the killer turned to corner. They were like 1metre away from us and borrowed time didn't activate. Twas very fun
---
Most pics with Freddy in sunglasses deserves an upvote. This is one of em.
---
No killer has to care about your fun to use a perk. That's like saying I should let the last survivor live if everyone farms eachother to death because it makes the game fun for everyone.  I DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT! Survivors don't care about fun of killers, killers don't care about the fun of survivors. Let us run whatever perk we want to that isn't bugged without complaining. The killers job is to KILL. If that means running NOED to get a kill, so be it. The dulls are a side objective. Sure, you don't have to cleanse dulls, but if you do you get rid of the slight chance of NOED spawning. If you remember all possible totem spawns you can EASILY find every single totem on all maps except The Game/Lerys. If you can look for Ruin and cleanse it, you can cleanse dulls.
---
Wait her cosmetic are out now?
---
Both of them do, but leather pig’s is just more expensive.
---
Also, it’s still scummy the way they made it just expensive enough to make you pay $5 more
---
A gen can't be completed if the survivor isn't there. I'm not sure what your point is. Regardless, it's a visual bug because you failed the skillcheck as the gen finished.
---
No russian
---
It didn't make you lose anything.
---
Lmao I like running super toxic builds on spirit with community despised perks because like, survivors have no respect for me, im not going to have any respect for them, sorry
---
Congratulations you played yourself.
---
This bug had nothing to do with you losing the game. I'm not sure why you'd believe that.
---
I can hear this image
---
That's not true, it's a coinflip at each box, the description of the power is a lie
---
a mine would be a great level. could really add some variety to the game's designs. and it would most make sense for Trapper. 
---
ooh, what if the killer was one of Trapper's victims? like it turned out that after Evan sealed the mine with everyone inside, a few survived and one went mad and ate the others to survive.
---
Dead Hard is already one of the best perks in the game, it doesn’t need a buff
---
I wouldn't even bring this up don't give them ideas lol .
---
The skins that does this are free to buy or have a recolour that is free to buy.
---
😳💦
---
Doesn’t that make it even worse?
---
Nah the opposite ill complain about it even though if they were cheaper I still wouldn't buy them.
---
Oink loyalty does not have a price tag
---
And for some reason Vulnerable makes you tank a second hit.
---
the message I got was "how the hell u hitting crossmaps and over houses" lmao
---
Oh  thx,  didn't know it's my cake day
---
No. P2W
---
DCing on hook is the same principle as mid game, just not as extreme. At what point is it okay to DC to help your team and hurt the killer? 
---
(Please don’t actually try to answer this, obviously my point is DCing should never be a strategy)
---
Sounds like a good idea to me. +1
---
Today I looped a Wraith for 4 gens! I had One friend that did four gens by himself while the two random claudets Urban evasioned the whole chase. At the end they did a gen surprisingly
---
I mean, I'm red ranks at both. I don't really play meta killers that much so naturally, gens are my sworn enemy.
---
Not really. What he did was trying to combo speed limiter with speed addons so he would deliver to hits during one chainsaw runs. It wouldn't work with M1 the same way as that did.
---
The thing about his success basically means that it isn't hard to chainsaw survivors as LF. And sawwing survivors is good.
---
i dont understand why you're getting so defensive over this, im just trying to help you. not sure how many hours you have in the game but once you have some experience playing as pig (or against pig) you'll see the coin flips in action, rather than the specific boxes. i wouldnt trust everything developers say, especially when they dont understand their own game, watch the hag gameplay lol.
---
Honestly, I think this skin would have been more expensive anyway because of the weapon. I believe it's the only weapon in DBD that is animated _and_ makes unique sounds passively. It's a minor thing, and a minor price increase as a result.
---
A C E N D
---
Might be the stupidest thing I've ever read. He would have gone to the gen even without the bug. Not to mention that I've seen this bug as a killer and you don't get a notication for the failed skillcheck.
---
I buy skins when they come out because I like the skins and want to support the game. I can afford it and it isn't harming me financially in any way so how is it an addiction?
---
Just because YOU can't afford to pay for every skin or feel it isn't valuable doesn't mean it is the same for everyone else.
---
Imagine thinking Nurse on console is F tier lol it's A tier at worst, if the Nurse user is experienced wnough
---
I mean at least you have to do something to get adrenaline(power all the gens) you don't really have to do anything to get noed. But yeah they are similar in the sense that they give you an extra life/insta down at the end of the game
---
This is the main reason I hesitate to buy any stalk based killer. Gens get rushed like crazy and these killers need to waste time staring at people? Sounds like a recipe for disaster.  Which is sad because the stalk mechanic sounds really fun.
---
It definitely isn't. I know what I'm talking about. Don't try to teach about a game you're new at.
---
I was literally just joking about this with my friends
---
It’s not hard to do... but congrats anyways!
---
The 30k is totally worth it, I agree lol
---
As someone who played on PC for a while after getting a gaming pc, training with nurse on PC makes console nurse a ton easier. Once you learn how far/fast you can turn and swing, it becomes a cake walk. 
---
Plus getting more than 12 fps now helps as well.
---
Did you get hit only once, or twice?
---
Just destroy their NOED and tbag them at the gate, those are the ones that really let tbagging get to them.
---
Ya I agree doubling BP rewards for actions would make life better for everyone but a killer who doesnt even kill anyone but gets a few hooks and chases with some gen protection mixed in will land 30k easily.
---
A survivor who gen jockeys the entire 5... or makes every hook save or who safely runs the killer round all game gets little more than 15k
---
Even evading the killer via stealth grants no blood points they should reward people just for being in the killers terror radius and not being found.
---
This is coming from a 5x P3 killer main at rank 3.
---
Up until past the green ranks, purple and red he's not as viable
---
Damn! Nice throw!!!
---
I always ignore generator completion notifications because the survivors probably left. There’s no point, especially when the killer could just chainsaw run to a generator that exploded for no reason. A generator exploding gives you no notification? Wow I didn’t know that.
---
If you can afford both, how is it dumb? Spending 10-20 bucks isn't going to take away from me buying real clothes lol. The same argument can be said for video games in general. "Why are you spending money on playing something virtual when you can spend money on something real you can experience like a trip or a concert?"
---
\&gt;Auric cells only
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
---
Once, about two or 3 seconds after being unhooked.
---
happy for ya bud, but trust me when i say when you play long enough you're gonna have to try NOT to hit 1mil by accident
---
The Entity's badly disguised skinsuit it uses to infiltrate survivor teams.
---
Thanks, it really calms my nerves :))))
---
Amazing, I love the replaced sounds.
---
Balancing the game and giving new content to new players via new perks and blood web leveling is how to build and keep the playerbase.
---
Bad players just starting out arent gunna break 8k BP a match and that slows their progression in the bloodweb and runs the game dry for them quickly.
---
When nearly 2 million people own your game but only 600k play it that shows something.
---
I still dont think im in on the joke
---
Its possible to have most if not all of your roster between B-S tier though.
---
Btw I don’t want this I was just asking
---
I mean.. They did 4 gens (cough cough) one of them had a brand new Part and one had a skeleton key :D
---
Indeed lmao
---
Can you even read? I said it didnt happen with the bug. Jesus, some people just can't take being wrong. You lost because you got outplayed. Not because of a visual bug which didnt affect your game play in the slightest
---
Yes it definitely is. You get notifications if you make a generator explode and you most DEFINITELY get notifications if you hurt yourself while healing. I’m not trying to teach you anything dude. I don’t know where you’re getting that assumption from.
---
That's great
---
Only the drill should cost that much

I'm not defensive. I'm just telling you statistics literally mean nothing. I can flip a coin 100 times and get heads 70 times but that doesn't mean that it's a 70% chance to get heads. It's still a 50% chance.
---
There are more glitches against survivors than ever before at the moment. No dead hard no wiggle no heal in any way and no escaping thru gates plus the killers can see us on the gens. They need to fix this.
---
Oh, awesome. So you almost know what it feels like to play Killer.
---
Shes a survivor who is hideous so people meme that she is the Entity's poor attempt at a human disguise.
---
Bruh are you really that self conscious about player level/rank that you have to censor it out?
---
There are too many bugs in this game at the moment.
---
Well just like me when my m8 leave me to die . I am btw shirtless David main
---
That “visual bug” let the killer know I was still at the completed generator’s position. It gave away my location. It did affect my game; I wouldn’t expect you to understand that because you were the one playing.
---
He is in. Dont you worry
---
I'm really hoping out for it to turn out that they're going to let us auric cells through the upcoming rift or the reworked daily system they hinted at. BHVR seems like it has a great thing going here, I'd hate to see another game ruined by greed.
---
But with dedicated servers we will all know who is using a lag switch, they will flash in and out and it’s very obvious, there is no ifs or buts about that, and when we do come across someone doing that make sure to report them and if you can send in video clip with proof and that player will be banned hopefully.
---
Largest independent isn't saying much when the average triple A studio has multiple studios of hundreds of employees working on a game.
---
That’s nearly a compliment! Good job DBD players!
---
&gt;.&gt;
---
&lt;.&lt;
---
*backs out of thread*
---
I wouldn't mind it IF it would not influence the BP grind. 
---
But i doubt the devs could ressist turning the grind up when there is an option to earn money.
---
Otherwise i wouldn't see it as P2W, it's the classical 'pay to skip grinding' thing every mobile game has, and doesn't really influence your performance during a trial.
---
So somehow that invalidates when I said they have to make money and a profit to continue updating and supporting the game?
---
Honestly his stealth to me is kinda what makes him hard. By the time it takes to stalk and then hunt the other survivors are already gen rushing.  But I just have to play smarter and use better perks
---
I think it’s just that DBD is a pretty simple game, mechanically speaking. The skill ceiling isn’t very high in this game. You can basically learn any killer you want in less than a week if you’re dedicated enough.
---
Well yes
---
That’s perfectly fine, but I’ve also heard people talk about how they’re spending so much money on dbd. 90% of them are probably jokes but there are definitely people that spend money they can’t afford
---
More confused about the shards being censored
---
My blind what?
---
I’m not going to
---
But let’s be real, they didn’t *need* to hack the price up. None of the other skins were extra
---
It’s a 7h old troll account, don’t mind it.
---
&gt;  it is the survivors job to cleanse totems throughout match
---
Ehhh the real counter to NOED though is not doing totems, or just keeping track of them/ getting rid of the REALLY hard to find ones.
---
Survivor's role is about speed, how fast you can move between objectives and what you should prioritize. Getting 2 gens topped off that could easily be used to 3 gen in later half of match and letting someone go to struggle? Decisions decisions. But you can sod off if you're doing every totem you find with no way of knowing if you've got all 5.
---
Awh this is great &lt;3 I always love to see art of Claudette, she's my favorite.
---
Pig is the new F tier so rip
---
Very strange
---
Why the hell was I mentioned by someone in the comments?
---
Depends on the rank. Most console nurses suck. If there is a fps cap (like Xbox) then it’s significantly harder to time.
---
If they're patrolling the hook, go do gens
---
Yea they really need to crack down on the amount of bugs, especially the no escaping and seeing survivors on gens horseshit.
---
Boutta drop $100 to sell a p3 claudette to some noob who doesn’t know you can buy BP if this ever happens.
---
Then walk through and chainsaw them and hook em.
---
Lmao please tell me you're joking
---
"statistics literally mean nothing" is pretty ignorant, idk where u are in schooling but you should take a statistics course, if you did a chi-square goodness of fit test on the data that man got and the expected results, you would get an extremely low p-value (probability), in fact I think a calculator would just say 0.  
---
im not gonna do the calculations, but you can if you have any doubts.   
---
your argument with flipping the coin is why people run multiple trials, that's why he has hundreds of examples, so that the probability of an error is lower.
---
Ha killing taunters in the gate is always satisfying. Bonus points for burning the rope on this one.
---
Now thats mindgaming.
---
There is no "new f-tier" just because the one killer in F leaves the tier
---
I think i changed my language settings to english since pig release. I know its hard to translate but why dont just let the perks titles stay in english and change the discription?
---
I’ll take that extra cash off your hands then if you don’t need it... boutta buy me some Civ 6.
---
Of course. Farming with a perk to Farm is really a waste
---
A man who uses Deja Vu has to have an IQ in the thousands atleast
---
You're right on both fronts. Most console Nurses do suck and the FPS and sensitivity caps do make it significantly harder than it is on PC. Neither of those factors makes Nurse F tier though
---
Looks like lag from hell to me.
---
WHAT'S UP WITH THE NETWORK, I JUST WANNA PLAY A FEW MATCHES
---
It will, when everyone else is running smoothly and you have that one asshole phasing in and out across the map you know they are jerking their cords and need to be reported. Played allot of games on dedicated servers going back to the PS2 days and those morons you could spot a mile away! 
---
Dudes were using a light switch before, then got into computer generated lag so it wouldn’t kick them out the match. So I can’t wait to see these people who do this or just have a shitty connection get the justice they deserve coming to them and won’t be able to dictate the tempo of the game anymore with their shitty internet!
---
I mean I guess but I personally think pig was right on the edge of being f tier, and now with Freddy gone she deserves it so
---
Lol wait actually? Dude send me the link lol. I'll make an r/quityourbullshit post on his r/quityourbullshit post :P
---
...
---
Is it out?
---
I wouldn't say Trapper is the only one whose power can also hinder him.
---
 Just look at Bubba. One invisible wall is all it takes to stun the man long enough for everyone to get a mile ahead.
---
You lose less rank at lower ranks. People at mid ranks only go down a rank or two while people at high ranks drop like 10 ranks.
---
why are people upvoting this... this is the ultimate repost
---
Normally I think it would have, but the mid chapter seems to be coming a week early so they didn't stagger the releases. So either Freddy came along faster than expected and they are getting it out a week early, or it was the plan all along to have 5 weeks between chapter and mid chapter.
---
well technically the killer isn't rewarded for that, if you kill everyone right away, you'll barely get any BP and only have like 1 good emblem.
---
If it's at the point of where it's blatantly OP, which some could argue Nurse with a couple of range add-ons and a few additional blinks is like I mentioned, the match isn't even anything anymore. If you have fun in 2 minute long matches where you insta kill all survivors, be my guest, but that's not how the match should be for fair games.
---
Also most people would agree that the learning curve of Nurse isn't really that hard.
---
How do you know people are spending money they can't afford? I spend money on cosmetics ( I purchase all of Feng's and unlicensed female cosmetics) and all of the dlc on both pc and ps4. That's hundreds of dollars which may seem a lot to some people but is in no way a lot for me. Like I said, just because you can't afford it does not mean that people who spend their hard earned money have an addiction. 
---
If I like a game, I support it. Is the slight price increase dumb? Yeah, it is. I'm surprised that with Ash's voice-lines that he isn't more expensive. Did I buy the skins? Yeah, because I have $60 worth of auric cells and don't care about the price. If you care, talk with your wallet and leave me and others who don't care out of it.
---
Nice to see at least some people actually talking about how ridiculous this is. Most Pig mains are just commenting that they know BHVR is taking advantage of their hype but they're "totally buying it anyway LuL".
---
This memes body wasn’t even cold before you went grave robbing!
---
I recommend professional help for any personal issues you may have
---
Thats why i am playing my games in english
---
If I had to guess, the i key is right next to the o key.
---
Legion is still a thing he is worse than pre buff freddy.
---
Now im in on it :D
---
Statistics show what's probable. They're guesses. Statistics =/= Reality
---
Wow did they really? what a dick move i feel with each and everyone of you
---
The neck really isn't too long proportionately! It looks strained, which fits Spirit's chatacter. 
---
This is really great! 💙
---
Is she I used to have PS4 and I don't remember her being there sorry
---
For fuck sake, your location was given away the second the gen was complete. You don't just teleport out of the gen range. There wasn't a 5 seconds wait between the skillcheck and the completed gen. He went there because the gen was done and he wanted to find a survivor. A skillcheck doesn't reveal your aura. And most killers check around a completed gen if they're close to it which he most likely was if he managed to get one of you there.
---
“Pretty good job so far” sometimes stuff just happens. Feels bad man
---
yep, never had to buy her
---
Yea, imagine a company selling its products and wanting to earn money? Wtf? It should be free, lol
---
Yea happens to me I'd say on average once a day on ps4
---
Yea the icon makes it a dead giveaway. This could totally make it more viable and would make more sense with the theme of the perk!
---
Meh all you really need is bbq and ruin the other two are situational.
---
guessing not since you a$$holes downvoted
---
very nice. hard not to fall victim to the desync and oddly large hitboxes for them hatchets lol
---
Claudette would like to know your location
---
I know it's a joke but for anyone who actually says this or just thinks that.
---
F tier is the worst compared to others not a general sense of bad. So F tier can still be good but it's an F compared to your alternatives.
---
No Mither should not be a viable option, the devs have stated that it is only there to serve as a 'hard mode' and they will therefore not change it.
---
Holy shit, I thought this was just my internet acting up.
---
WHY IS NURSE SO HARD TO USE ON CONSOLE!?!?
---
I. JUST. WANNA. BLINK.
---
I GET A BRUTAL KILLER DESPITE NO KILLS.
---
"I'M IMPROVING!"
---
GET SHAT ON UTTERLY NEXT GAME.
---
DAMN IT ALL
---
Are you console ? If so hows hunters on console , i wanna play her but i dunno
---
I could see it, though honestly I'd rather see them just do their own take on the horror movie mummy and not be constricted by that franchise
---
I'm 31. No need to be a cunt. I understand statistics, and I understand reality. Just because something has a 99.9% chance to happen doesn't mean it will happen. Fairly sure you're the one that doesn't understand.
---
Ahh thank you so much! 💕😭
---
Its a follow up comic to this. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ccoz5v/decisive_strike_20/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
She needs more love 😔💕
---
Here's some more hard to swallow pills OP until the developers fix literally every other major issue plaguing the game, the nurse isn't a priority and she isn't going to just get gutted so you don't have to get gud. Wanna win against the nurse? Then treat her like THE NURSE not some other killer. Break los,  use objects to keep los broken double back on prediction, use dead hard, use iron will, both very strong perks. Hide when you hear her terror radius, don't heal in her terror radius, Count how many blinks she has/used, learn how THAT nurse plays and adapt your jukes to compensate. 
---
It's literally the inverse for the nurse player, its a giant game of prediction for both parties. If she predicts correctly or reads you then she gets a hit, the inverse is true for survivor. If you juke her ass she has a long ass cool-down and limited vision abuse that window and gtfo. Nurse is without a doubt the strongest killer in the game but that doesn't mean she is inherently broken rather the majority of the killers in his game are pushover pieces of garbage to any coordinated swf team. Always remember as survivor you ARE NOT in control, thats not your role, you didn't choose the power role in a 4v1 asymmetrical pvp multiplayer game, you choose the weaker but more numerous one.
---
Why is nurse top tier, she's slow af.
---
My idea for this was to make the downside a bit more manageable by making able to take 1 hit without getting downed (at the start of the game), as well as make the killer play a guessing game : is he running no mither, or is he just not healing because i can instadown or other reasons.
---
Thanks for the support !
---
Well, the weapon has a constantly running custom animation and brand new sounds
---
&gt;why is it that the leather piggy is 15 dollars
---
Behavior gouging the r/oinkers community because they know a lot of people will pay it and they'll make extra money that way.
---
Did they ? When ?
---
Anyway, this is just a idea, chances of it getting into the game are low, I can dream though !
---
What if I told you I ain’t?
---
No they definitely said in a stream around the time the spirit dropped they had to literally be human to start with and they were talking about it story-wise not in appearance.
---
Anyone that discon because of items or perks the other side takes is a baby. Change my mind.
---
It’s like dbd version of the smurfs
---
No technically you are paying the auric cells for the skin. You *paid $15* for auric cells, and don't use all of those auric cells for the skin.
---
It is incorrect to say you pay $15 for the skin.
---
Poor Quentin.
---
Myers has such a smug look on his face. It's hilarious how he is one of the most expressive killers and he's wearing a fucking mask.
---
Or you could just run straight at the window like you're supposed to and get a fast vault that way. Don't expect the game to cover for your mistakes.
---
Susie's cosmetics and Jane's green cosmetics were also more auric cells/shards than an average green cosmetic.
---
I mean it's still a licenced killer and the extra is probably to cover the expenses they have to pay for the licence holders isn't it? (Legit question idk how it works). Either way I'll live without the head I'm planning on getting the body and weapon from this set and the other full set. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The Freddy thing for me always mostly seemed like it was just for a meme. I don't think he was F tier even pre rework.
---
I got the amazing deliverance
---
i'm sorry but the way you're approaching the math just seemed similar to how i would've as a child. 
---
 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test 
---
(specifically the goodness of fit part)  
---
that might be hard without a decent background in statistics which i just have a feeling you lack with the fact that you don't understand probabilities (the data isnt a 99.9% chance, for a fair comparison i can guarantee its approaching 9.9 x 10^40 % chance at least)
---
If you are a good spirit, you would use your power in short bursts during loops to take advantage of invisibility and reappearance lunge. A good spirit is *impossible* to mind game. Wait in front of a pallet. Do they walk towards you? Hit them. Do they run? You know where they are, so phase towards them and hit them. If you properly conserve your haunting, she is most certainly better than billy. Survivors mind games against a spirit rely solely on the skill of the spirit, because even walking survivors make noise.
---
When is it?
---
I'd enjoy watching someone play a full L4D match with all the models replaced with DBD characters
---
The server's been really bad today, but as a PS4 player I get these every 2-3 matches despite a great internet connection. It's really annoying.
---
I would love to play Amanda if she wasn't the worst killer in the game :(
---
I don’t think that’s a good excuse. All purple skins cost more than chapters as it is.
---
It's awful today
---
Then what? People are going to buy them and let BHVR know they can increase the prices all they want. Eventually they'll just make cosmetics too expensive that they'll lose money on them, which like most games instead of taking a step back will probably just increase the DLC prices to make it back.
---
I agree with all the ambush and crouching changes,
---
Yeah. It happens specially often right now. Also happened multiple times that we started up a match just to get a notification that a player left.
---
Fuze and the hostage yes.
---
Megs rise up... and leave your teammates to die on the hook as we run for the hatch
---
To each their own. I don't think of it as bullying. I think of it as using a gameplay mechanic as intended in one of the few situations it actually works.
---
I got super excited seeing my shitpost make it into a thumbnail.
---
Anyone that feels the need to take iri hatchets on hubtrss is a baby.  Change my mind.
---
That’s what looks best in game IMO, it’s what I did
---
I play solo but I love matching into a group of 3 people in the same outfit and switching myself to match
---
Freddy was definitely an F tier due to only effecting asleep survivors and the 7 second transition. A lot of situations with pre rework Freddy comes down to using that transition as your advantage. Either it being to jump in the hatch, activate the doors, or fail a skill check to wake up during the transition. He did have aura reading outside if his terror radius but prerework Freddy compared to all the other killers atm, he's got a lot more work he has to put in to hit someone compared to survivors waking up.
---
In your controls dude, it's super easy
---
What if I told you...you don't have to buy any cosmetic?
---
I mean, the main thing about the mechanical aspect of the most mechanically demanding killers (Huntress, Billy and Nurse) is that they often also require an element of prediction and reading. So while the hatchet hitbox is forgiving enough that it's not as hard to hit as a sniper shot, it requires way more prediction, and also knowledge of when you can or can't pull out a hatchet.
---
Btw, considering how much most people struggle with using add-on less Nurse, I wouldn't call it so basic. Just because some games have extreme mechanical aspects that require thousands of hours to be mastered doesn't mean all the DbD ones are super simple.
---
Dedicated servers won't pay for themselves
---
How is Wake Up? I have never used Quinton and I know generally his perks don't sound the best but I can see the strengths in this one.  Reviews?
---
Wait that wasn't just my internet?? :0
---
Ash: "Hugs?"
---
Kate: "No" *starts mori animation*
---
Cultured
---
Why would they if they don’t play killer?
---
Op during chases
---
No one be standing up for dem Ace main’s having overpriced skins in nearly every rarity 😤
---
Imagine having to settle for an outfit being ten dollars and still getting fucked in the ass lmao. For real though, just don't buy their cosmetics because I can guarantee you this isn't the last time they'll disappoint you.
---
Can’t believe people think Legions power is a hindrance lmao
---
Players, rise up
---
Cookieh back at it again with banging cosplay!
---
It's because all the pig wankers would drag their balls through glass to get anything for the swine at any price so why not cash in. Enjoy your mediocre killer I guess 🤗
---
Yeah but I still don't think he was fully F tier. Mind game ability was great. Atleast on PS4. I never got to play PC Freddy that much
---
Unless you're using beast marks and knife scratches the chainsaw won't be fast enough to catch during a loop.
---
For someone who claims to play a lot of leatherface you sure don't seem to know how the chainsaw actually works.
---
Companies need to make money, that is correct.
---
Using scummy techniques, no
---
Yeah its pretty funny :D
---
What?
---
So a totem lights up as soon as a generator is completed?
---
It's their fault I got hyped!!!¡¡
---
Leatherpiggy, looks nice
---
I don’t think so
---
r/humansbeingbros
---
Imagine the wonders of a Team full of P3 Claudettes👍
---
How many times do I have to say I’m not buying it lol
---
It's pretty much pre-work Freddy is worse than all the other killers. Not bad, but bad compared to everyone else
---
You're just acting like statistics are as set as the laws of physics, which is not true. Just because one persons testing and statistics says something, doesn't mean he's right. That's all I'm trying to say. If several other people had done the same testing, and gotten the same results, then I might be inclined to believe it. But one guy doing tests and coming up with some percentages does not disprove the fact that the box is randomly chosen. It just shows that people are lucky 50% of the time.
---
So what your saying is I should be using noed on my nurse since she doesn't have an insta-down right?
---
Inb4 my bloody Valentine killer
---
It sadden's me there's a myers main out there like this. There is no "relax"
---
Weird sort of persecution complex you have there. Survivors outnumber killers here in every poll ever taken.
---
But look, the weapon, it's all spinny, and makes noise when attacking, that clearly deserves those extra few bucks
---
Yeah, damn them and their disposable incomes! If people want cosmetics, there's nothing wrong with them supporting BHVR.
---
Do you have any Dwight ones for 2560x1440?
---
I want bikini pig
---
&gt; The intention doesn't really matter when it isn't against the rules of the game. 
---
You would call camping and tunneling toxic, yet they're also not against the rules of the game.
---
Maybe 0eople can stop complaining about NOED if people used that perk.
---
It combo’s with resilience. I’d prefer starting injured personally. However, they definitely should remove the broken symbol from the killers HUD so they at least have a chance of forgetting.
---
Also remove the loud injured music.
---
Also also, make it 100% noise reduction
---
Yeah I always got like 95 cells left over so can’t really spend em
---
^
---
Honestly I think that's the real point here. If you're comparing 1 perk to 1 killer perk of course it's going to be skewed.
---
That's why the anti-noed really seems to lose traction. The argument always seems to go Noed OP -&gt; there's a counter -&gt; but doing bones isn't doing gens -&gt; yes this slows the game down -&gt; but that benefits the killer -&gt; yes that's what perks do -&gt; but compared to survivor perks it's way stronger -&gt; there's 16 survivor perks &amp; 4 killer perks -&gt; ????
---
I get this as soon as I join a lobby after I’ve spent 15 mins in a swf waiting screen.... Feelsbad
---
it doesn't matter that one guy did it, he did multiple tests, spanning 21 days and 250 games. that makes his results statistically significant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance)
---
The totem would still light up after gens are fully completed but not before. Killer receives small speed buff with each gen ending with the current speed increase. As it is now Noed doesn’t help killers until end game and wastes a slot and survivors are often blindsided by it. Reworking it to this could help balance it and make it more helpful to killers and less frustrating to survivors.
---
**Statistical significance**
---
In statistical hypothesis testing, a result has statistical significance when it is very unlikely to have occurred given the null hypothesis. More precisely, a study's defined significance level, denoted α, is the probability of the study rejecting the null hypothesis, given that the null hypothesis were true; and the p-value of a result, p, is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme, given that the null hypothesis were true. The result is statistically significant, by the standards of the study, when p &lt; α. The significance level for a study is chosen before data collection, and typically set to 5% or much lower, depending on the field of study.In any experiment or observation that involves drawing a sample from a population, there is always the possibility that an observed effect would have occurred due to sampling error alone.

^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
---
Yup. Tried to show a friend who’s never played DBD some gameplay. Took a while, to say the least..
---
I downvoted you for the cringey whining about "mains", full disclosure. Patrolling internet message boards for bias seems like a waste of time but you do you man.
---
Oh god your over 19 and this retarded...yikes
---
Or he's leaning.
---
Bumping to points up for non hex bones to 1,000 is and indirect nerf in a sense. It’s more incentive to take them out ahead of time.
---
I really like the idea. I would also like to see her have the ability to pick up RBT's that survivors have removed. Like the trapper. That, of course if there weren't other changes made to help her of course.
---
I think NOED is kind of a waste now when late game pig or freddy are no more. I prefer my perks to be used 100% of a match
---
Not really. It’s not anything special to make a moving weapon. Certainly doesn’t make it worth $15
---
Correction how to NOT use pallets against any killer.
---
I don't know, sounds kinda dumb. Should just add a totem counter to encourage people to do more totems.
---
They sure are, it's in both side's interest to rush the objective, gens and survivors, so lets not pretend otherwise.
---
I love everything but the first 2 gameplay changes don't think those should be imply.  Just make addon buffs strong enough to be noticeable but not to the point when they guarantee a RBT kill.
---
You really dislike pig huh
---
When have I claimed I've played a lot of him? And I do know how it works. You rev it up, get slowed while you do it and then get a speed boost as you're swinging it. If you're breathing down a survivors neck and start revving it in a loop you're definitely able to catch up.
---
And I will agree with his statistics. Survivors do seem to get the box off at the first box about 50% of the time. This proves absolutely nothing about how the game is coded.
---
You too
---
And then they accuse you of tunneling
---
I’m not spending any money until they decrease the price
---
Not all of it, some people really are assholes though. Looking at you, campers that instantly tunnel after an unhook.
---
Didn’t say A but it’s ok
---
Also I don’t think rank 5-6 is really low ranks
---
They're calling you sweaty, or a tryhard. Basically they were out-skilled, and are blaming their loss on the fact that you were trying to win.
---
They know how this community likes pig and we were hyped to get these cosmetics so the decided to rise the price a bit. It could be because the weapon is animated but the other skin also has an animated weapon so why isn't it the same price?
---
You have enough to buy 1 item that costs 400 ac if you spend 25 bucks for both pig cosmetics. That's it.
---
ty. btw do you have any tips for ghost face? I've been trying to pick him up
---
I am not saying you shouldn't give money to the devs at all. I think this way of giving them money is wrong because if you do like this, you shift their focus on something that's not the right point: cosmetics are not what the game needs. We need VIABLE KILLERS so they should focus on DLC's not on cosmetics for easy money.
---
They should just remove the exposed status so we don't have to talk about it anymore.
---
Well, it's still pretty good on Wraith and Doctor, along with any other killer, whom I can't think of at the top of my head, who lack map pressure and/or chase potential.  
---
I personally don't like the perk, but it does help our weaker boys.
---
The point is they're completely optional. No one's making you buy them and any perceived change to gameplay is negligible therefore if you don't buy them you can still enjoy the game as much as you did before. The complaining over an 80 cent price different is ridiculous. You literally will spend more money at a bar, going out to eat, on gas for a week, on your hair than you will for that cosmetic.
---
And what a comeback...I bet that sounded cooler in your head.
---
You're ignoring my evidence as well. The only way to actually test this would be to do several 1 on 1 kill your friends games where the survivor tries the boxes in the same order each time.
---
Because
---
Damn that was fast. Good job
---
I can't wait for both of her new cosmetics. Her leather jacket and her belly button plus new masks look so cute. I'm going to be a pig main now.
---
Very compelling.
---
Thats called Dead by Desync, happens sometimes when the connection between you and the host is not reliable, such is life on p2p connections
---
you have literally presented 0 evidence while i presented you with an experiment that had hundreds of trials (and he has an earlier post with a similar amount)
---
Here you go https://youtu.be/A3oL7v7PLac
---
I'm good at proving points
---
Ong it's mostly crouching CLAUDS and Neas
---
I understand you shouldn't let the other side effect it, but im saying they should change NOED to remove that feeling, just as they changed DS. Its not about complaining or whining, its about the lifespan of the game. People don't want to play when they feel you have been cheated out of a win because of NOED. Its simple quality of life improvements to keep people playing.
---
Explains your presence on this sub.
---
I mean I’m all for more buffs, I just thought this change should be one of them, her crouch and ambush need a bit of love too
---
Personal experience. And it's a fact that it's never the same box twice in a row. So SWF skews results for that. So the percentages will be off since, depending on his rank during testing, most people play in a SWF.
---
I know what its from. I just don't see why it should be added.
---
And her true power... is to have two killers in the game to work together and kill the survivors!
---
this will have no effect on any killer who isn't a potato though :/
---
Not seeing anything DbD related there. It was probably just a joke.
---
you have still presented 0 evidence, try again when you have data.
---
I think as killer I’d be happy with a 3k instead of a 4K, but if the opposing team is essentially exploiting in order to keep one guy alive I have a right to be annoyed.
---
So is bbq noed and may other perks
---
I would rather have an original killer
---
I feel like it’ll just desovle into insult and/or helping each other out
---
Friday the 13 has it but it’s way more unpolished and if the killer gets to u your basically dead
---
What’s your tumblr if you have one omg!!!!!
---
Keeps happening when I try to play killer today. Survivor is fine though.
---
Is nerfed legion not F tier? I've found them unusable since the rework.
---
I just think it would be really funny :)
---
What’s wrong with iridescent head?
---
You have it backwards, if anything NOED counters Adrenaline
---
I can get a clip of the dev actually explaining how the boxes work, if that would help. Since the person who actually programmed it probably knows more than someone who played a few games and thinks they're right.
---
I think he's good.
---
Its not a nerf, its really just a consistanty thing. In fact, it would slow the game more, allowing more room to build without Ruin. My proposed change just makes it less of a kick in the teeth. Its not about caring about the other sides fun, its about making the game fun, because its a video game, and we play to enjoy it. If something is ruining the experience more from a side, then it should be changed. And in my opinion it just promotes bad playing, and just should be altered.
---
it’s idealmori!
---
It should activate as soon as a survivor tbags
---
A fun addon for survivors :)
---
id be interested in seeing the programmer say that rather than a spokesperson
---
Isn't that illegal to make false discounts?
---
In my opinion, the leather cosmetic isn't as good as the test subject one so I just ignored it completely and got the one I wanted. Didn't even know there was a price difference until I checked this sub.
---
OINK
---
......thats what a maiden is....

Seems to be based or at least these videos make a pretty good indication of why it's a meme:

---
One of my biggest problems with NOED is you don't know if a killer has it until they've hit you. So many times I try to take a hit for someone on the way out and then everyone leaves because fuck trying to save me when everyone is a one hit down.
---
As a Leatherface main; hard disagree. The people arguing against him have never seen a good LF
---
WHY IS EVERYONE HER SO GOOD AT THE GAMR AND I NEVER PLAY WITH YOU I ONLY GET POTATOS
---
Just imagine that the entity nerfed her neck and it will be ok
---
I use both BBQ and chili and spies on huntress
---
If only you were Bill
---
Bold move posting here while using noed.
---
Love me some Small Game! All totems cleansed within 3 minutes!!!!!!
---
So if I don’t have auric cells how much do I have to spend
---
I'm honestly surprised this mask wasn't a costume option.
---
Awesome. Good for you. I've been having all kinds of problems today ever since buying the cosmetics. Might be because of the lightning storms passing by. Who knows at this point.
---
It’s funny that you say that as I have been the recipient of a few farm schemes in which I’ll place someone in the basement and I swear I cannot even round the corner top floor when someone gets unhooked. Obviously, I return so I can try and get two people, I get one and hook in the basement. Process repeats and I then realize I’m playing with farmers and use this to my advantage because I realize I won’t get too far before I have everyone there. I try to play the game without camping but they all end up near me and I down and sacrifice them all. I then get bombarded by messages calling me a camper and n00b simply because I figured out rather quickly that they were just farming
---
It does cost $15 if you don’t have spare AC
---
The fact you still have AC left does not change the fact you are still required to spend $15 on the skin
---
No one:
---
The video: \\
---
I just did what some may call a pro gamer move, unfortunately with trash teammates
---
This reminds me of the is this your wallet skit on spongebob. It does in fact cost you 15 dollars to buy the skin, your point is, the skin itself is not worth 15 dollars.
---
A little bit more I think but my main problem is that I pretty much have to buy the 20 dollar cell pack instead of the 10 dollar one when all I want is one outfit.
---
I just did that today and I feel attacked
---
NOED doesn't need a change.  It's fine as it is.  It's a high risk perk  against survivors who know the counter is cleansing all 5 dulls. It's low risk against survivors who don't know the totem spawns at all. It can also slow the game down, like with Ruin, which is what the killer wants to do.
---
I also disagree that she is hard to master. She is much harder in the beginning but not so much later. Curving on safe loops with Billy and 360 noscope huntress on the other hand is ridiculously hard AND counterable.
---
Overrated is your killer from your flag buddy.
---
What's that? Skins for a licensed character cost more? 
---
Clearly it must be because BHVR is greedy and not because of contractual obligations to the license holder that make it more expensive to produce because a set amount goes directly to the holder.
---
Kinda l
---
you said maybe 😢 nah jk I didn’t see that part sorry
---
People who leave downvoted comments have huge pp.
---
Huntress is free on console
---
cunnilingus is when you perform oral sex on a vagina 
---
fellatio is the term you are looking for
---
You are the type of people we have but don’t deserve
---
Every other skin costs the same, so why specifically leather pig? Clearly BHVR must be angels that never do anything wrong despite the fact they’ve already exploited the AC buying system to jack up prices on green rarity ace and Jane skins
---
It's greed when you're not forced to buy it?  It's called supply and demand.  Here's a supply for you, now do you demand it?
---
If not, see what happens.  Price will drop later on down the road.  If so, see what happens.  The demand was there all along then.  
---
People who constantly throw stones at companies like this and call them greedy lack any critical thinking skills.  You can get this core game for less than $20 and you call them greedy.  They're giving you the power to vote with your wallet and demand.  Yet it pisses you off to oblivion just seeing a more expensive skin.  Plus it's for a licensed character obviously so there's that justification for it being a bit more.
---
and to these people who think $4 or $5 every 3 months for a DLC is somehow filling the coffers of BHVR are out of their mind.  these cosmetic items in the store are a great way to bring in money and continue supporting BHVR.  I wonder what their company would look like internally as far as staff, budget, etc. if they weren't somehow making more than $5 every 3 months for a DLC off each existing player.  That seems like a pretty small revenue stream.  Of course they get new players purchasing the game but probably not at a crazy rate to keep them operating.  BHVR should just not sell the game outright anymore and move to a subscription model, where you have to pay $5 every month to play.  Maybe them we'd be able to weed out the bitching and moaning community from the community who actually wouldn't mind paying for a game that's constantly being serviced by BHVR every month.
---
I bet you'd like that greed eh you whining little cunt.
---
yeah the rework is good he was just a really weak killer is all that's why he needed the buff
---
Tryin to play killer today and it's happening to me too. Survivor seems fine. :/
---
Then how do you counter a swf that does all the gens in the first two minutes and teabags?
---
Ta fak is dae killer mains and res?
---
Ok. So a common thing toxic people do.
---
It's common because it works. They *could* just charge the flat amount of real money for it, but why would companies willingly miss out on some good old psychological manipulation while they're selling stuff? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Oh I get it now. The skin costs more than the actual killer itself? Nice.
---
I really wasn't trying that hard.

Swamp is bar none the worst, at least in The Game they stick out against the texture pack of the level, trying to spot dulls through the backwater bushes is next to impossible without small game.

Too late for that.

Would be awesome if Infectious Fright on ghostface  caused survivors to yell Wazuup  instead of normal screams.

*oinks in edgelord*
---
Yes, that's literally his point.
---
I’m crying this is too beautiful
---
I don't care about cosmetics, like I said they're not the point. Its what comes after, every game is just waiting for it's customers to let them charge more. Eventually it'll move onto the DLC and people will say the same shit, that's how it's been for years now. I took my "comeback" from your meme and added one word, how slow are you that you'd have to run that through your head first?

This literally happened to me as I was looking at this post

I usually camp people just to see them send angry messages
---
I don't have to buy them.

But I can still have an opinion and say that they're making a selfish move by taking advantage of people's hype, raising the price that slightly so that you have to buy $15 worth of Auric Cells.

Boar head for sure

The question is about cosmetics for Huntress, I don't understand the meme tho
---
Some of you people are truly stupid you know that? It's a full game ported to mobile. Beta implies it's a testing phase and there's still things they need to work out and apply for it to be functional on multiple different phones, and firmware versions since not all phones are the same. Them offering it for sale for shards on mobile has nothing to do with it being "beta." The only thing more beta than the mobile version are the sheeple in this sub that preach shit they have no idea what they're talking about.
---
Amazing.  
---
I WANT IT
---
???. There's counterplay to Hag. There's no good counterplay for a good Billy.  Any decent survivor can make an educated guess about where your traps are. 110% movement speed makes play around loops harder. You can place a trap but at that point, the survivor abandons the loop and finds another one.
---
R6 huntress here. Not the best but ill try to help. I'd say just try to appear less toxic? Like for instance purposely don't tunnel if you know you'll get them all anyway. They would feel guilty leaving then if they saw that. Other than that I'd say don't give up
---
Unpopular opinion: if you don't want to spend that much money on cosmetics, then don't do it
---
it's not just about killing them, you have to make sure to break some pallets, get chase points, etc in order to get a pip. Anyways, if you are a killer and make a 4K game you use to earn a pip everytime
---
It's good untill you learn totem spawns, then you don't need it.
---
Two killer perks and two survivor perks which rotate each week that you can use iridescent shards to purchase. The perk then shows up in blood webs. You get shards from playing the game.
---
Yah this happens to me to on XBox, I just constantly quit and open until it works. It usually works on the 1st to 2nd time.

I feel welcomed thanks a lot for the advise :D

Meh gotta brush the salt off sometimes. I am currently trying to get better with Huntress on Xbox and I will always remember [the kind ones like the game I literally just got out of](https://imgur.com/gallery/MU1wah3)

Could you do the same for me? I really love this and I’m interested to know how you did that!

You must be fun at parties.

Thanks a lot I will put it into practice for sure, Im using headphones for sure thanks a lot again for the help.

Oh hey, you're the dumbass who tried to tell me the Pig skins weren't coming out today, and then stayed suspiciously quiet when I called him out for being wrong.

Still a cunt, I see. Bit ironic that you of all people are accusing people of talking about shit they have no clue about.

Nice drawing dude 👍

I love that the blade blends in with the fence. If I were a Dwight, I would have swore you were just gonna punch me.
---
Sorry man but that isn’t going to happen. We all wish it did, but companies almost never listen and it wouldn’t be fair to the idiots who bought it at full price.
---
Ok. Now I understand. The problem is that the only viable killers at red ranks are Billy,spirit, nurse and sometimes very good huntresses. I don't understand why they can make really good cosmetics, but they can't focus on characters. That's why I got upset. I understand that they have their job but I can't pay for a game that's not designed properly at its core: the killers. It's like having a Ferrari without engine.
---
S - "Broken." Wins are solely determined by your execution; survivors have little to no agency. (Nurse)
---
A - "Strong." Both sides have agency, but the odds are in your favor. (Spirit, Billy)
---
B - "OK." You have some agency, but survivors need to misstep for it to matter. (Hag, Huntress).
---
C - "Sub-par." Power is potentially strong, but you still just get looped for days. (Ghostface, Pig, Clown, Myers)
---
D - "Bad." Either due to low strength or low usability, killer has very little to help him kill survivors. (Plague, Wraith, Leatherface, Trapper, Doctor)
---
F - "Meme tier." The devs forgot to give this killer a power. (Legion, old Freddy, release Doctor).
---
If Nurse is nerfed to A tier, that doesn't mean anybody else goes to S tier.
---
IKR SS A, its so relatable and funny.
---
Facts. But I hate your facts.
---
Dwight you ignorant slut!
---
Running into the same issue here
---
F was for freedy and for fucking awesome, man freedy was my favorite, i got rank 6 in a month (until reset) only using his sexy ass, he isnt so bad :(
---
Just started watching part 3 and honestly I'm so excited to get to this point to have just experienced it
---
Oh my god how many times do I have to tell people I’m not buying it
---
I personally done like her new weapons, the hidden blade is to cool, I only bought the head and jacket.
---
That's awesome! I normally thumbs up a good killer but I don't know if they get notified of that.
---
Maybe the people who bought it at full price could get a compensation
---
Teachable’s from the get go I guess
---
I’d 100% buy this
---
Well I'm glad I'm not in your boring ass games if you think this game is all about running around an object endlessly..
---
It's not a necessity because being facecamped doesnt happen that often. It's a really bad strategy that killers use because you've either been a pain in the ass or they're bad.
---
Also if you think being facecamped is bad you arent at the rank where people actually use killers you should worry about. 
---
Nurse can pretty much map camp on maps like The Game, she doesn't have to be anywhere near you and without BT and other perks you're screwed. Bad killers using bad strats aren't the problem.
---
Well, first of all, there's 4 of the little bastards, and only one killer. Making them passively stronger would only further fuck things around.
---
Second of all, why would BHVR want to make there be a survivor meta? Because that's what would happen. I kinda get enough Claudettes and Neas as is, thanks.
---
Puppers*?
---
The counter to Billy is to run tight loops and keep objects between you and him.
---
Let's say that a decent Survivor will make a guess about where my traps are, and will not run to them. That means they're not running loops. That means I win.
---
Hag doesn't get looped. Trapping a loop is like breaking a pallet: Do it in a way that forces them to either run into a deadzone (but for Hag it's her web) or take a hit. I place my trap at the loop, and you either stay to mindgame it, or run back into my traps.
---
The only way for a Survivor to avoid my traps is to avoid all windows, all pallets, all corners, all tight locations, and all drops. That means they're running in a straight line. That means I win. Even then, I leave traps in the open to catch roamers and the occasional Survivor that does exactly that ^ .
---
You cultured swine!
---
People like what they laugh at go away
---
just keep leveling up your bloodweb, its all rng, just make sure to always unlock a perk on the bloodweb.
---
I mean I'd definitely get notified of it, but I know a lot of killers tend to disable their messages or set it to 'friends only' which is always an option for you if you don't want to see the type of messages you got.

Don’t understand his fans or how he even has any. I decided to watch a stream of his when no one that I actually like was streaming a while ago and his subs kept donating money like someone would donate $50, then someone else would donate $51, then $52, $53, $54, etc. and it just kept going up... He must’ve made way over $1,000 from them in under an hour. All while he was being a manchild, screaming at his team and calling them trash for not repairing all 5 generators in the literal 30 seconds he was being chased, then calling the killer trash for catching him (logic?) and he disconnected from almost every game too. I don’t even think he was saying thank you to the people who donated, he was just laughing and calling them crazy/stupid. So unlikeable.
---
Whoa! I love it!
---
You understand BHVR sets the price of the Monopoly Money (Auric Cells) themselves right?
---
Any and all "discounts" exist solely into tricking you into thinking you're getting more value, when in fact *they set the values on the market themselves*. They are independent of supply and demand because they falsely create it themselves.
---
They want you to buy more cells than you need, they want you to have left over cells, they want you to feel like the left over cells are sitting there wasted since you can't reasonably buy anything with them, and they want you to buy *more* so you continue that cycle.
---
This entire concept of "oh this is 10% off" and "oh I get 10% more" is mobile-gaming-level-manipulation, because *they created and control the entire market and set value according to whatever they feel like*. Their market doesn't have a real-world-value equivalent except to whatever *they decide it is worth*.
---
So the whole "it only technically costs 88 cents more if you already bought more cells than you need at one point and have some left over that you couldn't spend anyway without buying yet more cells" is absurd, and trying to justify it as anything but greedy is ridiculous.
---
Lol...is it fine though really?
---
Yes but killers have special abilities that only that one can specially use but all survivors are literally carbon copies of one another with just a different skin
---
They don't bother me. I'll just keep being positive when I play. My buddy and I always stream DBD as survivors and we try our best to complement the killer after a match.
---
I love the nice side of the DBD community. I had a guy one game as the hag who was looping me like crazy and it was just an overall bad game for me and at the end I messaged him to say good job cause I was finding my bad plays at trying to down him hilarious and we just had a really good chat about the game and how much we hated the map we played on haha.
---
Where's the 2v8 for DBD, BHVR?
---
136 upvotes and 0 comments? Hmm...
---
That would probably screw with the power of the killer to much you know? Plus that would probably make a shitty certain survivors only meta
---
Played that in my mind with sammination's VA for Legion. Double the chuckle.
---
So then what's the excuse for Susie's cosmetics costing more too?
---
Survivors are skins. 
---
If survivors have passives the Meta could be even more fucked and unbalanced. 
---
Do we want that? Fuck no. 
---
So survivors should stay Just skins. 
---
Also it could deter someone from playing a character that fits them to playing the best killer in the game.
---
Lolz, 4 minutes isnt bad. Wait till you wait 40 minutes to play a match.
---
i'd open the gate and let him go. on to the next match
---
Keep doing it then. If you're at a rank where it works. Just dont be surprised when it suddenly stops working and you're on the ground.
---
Freddie is still F tier cause his name is Freddie
---
Well yeah I always figured they countered each other nicely you’re just not convinced adrenaline counters noed.
---
I got the other one and I’ll up load a video later
---
But the problem lies that it slows the game down wether they take it or not. NOED slows games down by EXISTING. A perk should not have an effect on the match if its not in play, at least not to the point that NOED does. The changes i've proposed would simply make it consistant, so that it always effects the match when it should, and still keep it practically the same. It wouldn't be a nerf, it would simply make it embedded in the game. It would still function identically.
---
Okay. Two different teams. Calm down.
---
Saw people probably wanted more money for the cosmetics
---
He never had to be crouched while he stalks. Crouching just makes him harder to notice.
---
I wouldn't even bother playing if that was the case.
---
NOED already slows the game down if survivors go to cleanse dulls. It doesn't need any changes. It's fine as is. The game isn't fun as long as survivors can steamroll killers in 4 or 3 mans. Also I don't play this game to have fun, I play to win. Sure, it's a video game, doesn't mean I have to play to have fun. Tryharding is something I do because I want to win
---
I get accused of it all the time. For reference I live in a rural area and the internet I have is the best we can get here. Most survivors are on yellow ping with the occasional spike. Just because I occasionally get a hit I shouldn't be able to all of a sudden I'm lag switching.
---
No, pussers was right
---
Standby what
---
Jesus, you could get a brain tumor from reading this, I've already seen so many comments like these and on other games as if it's just a small change and won't affect the game on a larger scale later on. You're basically defending predatory schemes, with BHVR testing the grounds to see if they could increase the price even more down the line and do all sorts of greedy stuff, I already proved why the price increase has nothing to do with the license, and it would seem like you think BHVR is low on budged, even with the game being p2p, even with all the dlcs, even with all the cosmetics in the shop, even with the fact that they have 500+ people already working for them and more to hire, even with the fact that they can af.....
---
I'm just gonna stop right here before I actually get a brain tumor from your comment
---
I'm mainly getting adds on and offerings not many perks, I got borrowed time and still couldn't get a purple perk, i've tried 4 times already.
---
I mean that's how it actually works with swfs when you play killer
---
He can't move I can't open the gate
---
You made the witch hotter
---
The main reason I believe *(Because this is just speculation)* The Pig's, Pig Leather outfit costs more is probably because of the amount they have to give the license holders of SAW.
---
So yes, I'd you already have at least 88 cents I'm your account than your fine, but BHVH can't appease the license holders and increase the % bonus of the $9.99 Auric Cells Pack.
---
A chase perk?
---
In MY killer shrine?
---
The point of Adrenaline is to recover a health state without taking the time to heal. NOED says fuck your healing, I'm downing you anyway. The only scenario where Adrenaline would "counter" NOED is if the final generator pops mid swing. And even then, the killer's speed boost means they're catching up to the survivor pretty quick after that anyway.
---
Me too man, me too
---
I love the new weapons because of the cool drill and saw sounds they make but each to their own I guess.
---
I was fine earlier today but just jumped on now and getting this message over and over...
---
That's an area in which I could use some advice too.  I'm definitely doing my best to avoid what are characterized as bad behaviors like camping and tunneling, but I'm not sure what survivors are expecting?  
---
I have opened a cabinet to refill my hatchets, turned around to depart and there's a survivor dehooking.  I got called a toxic [slur] baby for grabbing the dehooker, hooking him and continuing to patrol the generators.  Is that tunneling or is the survivor being salty?
---
just keep leveling your bloodweb and youll get it at some point, you are leveling meg thomas for spring burst right?
---
I think its a bit daft to call it a short cut after all the whole aim for survivors is to do gens. I get gen rushing is annoying it happens to me a lot considering I have no ruin on a lot of my killers, but at the end of the day I wouldnt resort to using NOED because I do belive its an unfair reward. But thats just an opinion
---
4 is literally nothing. And every web has 1-2 perks. They're always random so there's no strategy. Sometimes you'll get all 3 tiers of the perk you're looking for in 3 webs; sometimes you'll be prestige 3 lvl 50+ and still not have seen it.
---
A totem counter would be nice especially for solo
---
From which freddy movie is this?
---
So why is only 1 of the 4 released cosmetic sets more expensive?
---
It lets you get an iron will that also removes pools of blood, plus you get to start with the resilience bonus and a non-zero amount of the time will still get the unbreakable side of it.  I think that's exactly what the perk needs, and the only thing it needs.
---
Use bond over empathy, imo
---
That's the spirit!
---
Meg mains are superior
---
Yeah, it was a Plague. Things line up now. Thanks.
---
Did you know prior that someone was at least over there or did you just throw one hoping to randomly hit a survivor lol?
---
Luv you piggy so cute 🐷
---
It only cost you an additional $5 if you don't already have at least 88¢ in your account. My problem is people are saying the skin costs $15 dollars, but it's more accurate to say " you may need to pay $15 dollars for the outfit" or "you may need to pay an additional $5 for the outfit". 
---
Just out right saying "the outfit costs $15" is a lie and can be misinterpreted.
---
Not always on your side. You can’t count how many times it hit level geometry when IT SHOULD NOT.
---
The issue is, what did the survivors do to deserve to get served on a silver platter like that?
---
Betting that biker set is the last one they'll release
---
It was because of bbq. I just hooked someone.
---
It sounds really ironic to me.
---
DBD is a mobile game, explains the store tactics. Were playing the early access port.
---
Is this skin out yet? I haven’t played today
---
find the hatch? or are there no interaction options on screen?
---
Salty. Don't be the kind of person that Chase's the guy unhooked after being bodyblocked kinda huntress without reason. If they have the only box then sure. They were toxic to you the. Sure whatever it may be you need a reason. Also your at a tough rank were people dc alot. Also you said you grabbed the guy who was unhooking!? How is that tunneling!? That guy is high
---
I’m a new killer, but I’m really only playing for BP. I have NOED just for the survivors that tbag me the entire game. If the survivors play the objectives and finish all the gens, I let them go. I’ll still chase and down them sometimes, but I’ll let them leave since they earned it.
---
"adrenaline counters Freddy"
---
That is true assuming they are able to fix all 5 gens.
---
Never thought id see anyone fuck up delivering that line.
---
&gt;sees teammate crouching at a corner of the map
---
Me being chased: it’s sandbag time
---
I closed hatch that's why EGC started also I can't interact with anything
---
So, I was about to hook someone and they DCed, pretty normal toxic survivor stuff, whatever. But then the game ends, and he's sitting there BMing and making fun of me in endgame chat? WTF? Why can survivors DC ingame and sit in the endgame lobby, and not get banned for intentionally disconnecting? Hello?
---
I realized I didnt completely block out his user name. I'll repost later with this taken out
---
Well, If Nurse got released ~now she’s have a cooldown for her power and higher base speed, so you chase normally but still can blink from time to time. Just talking about how to not change the power completely.
---
Right. Thats basically where I stand lol.
---
What level is your character? At level 25+, you’ll be guaranteed to get two perks per bloodweb. Though you can only get one v
---
...aaaandd I get in and the killer dodges the lobby. Why I bother with this game any longer I don't know.
---
Wether you gotta spend an extra $5 to get the skin because either way it costs the same.
---
I get what you are saying but out right saying "the skin costs $15 dollars" is a lie. The outfit costs $10.88 but you may need to spend $15 if you don't have 88$ in your account.
---
toxic survivor spotted
---
unpopular opinion.
---
Ruin is for killers who can not pressure.
---
It is unreliable and it is hard to play without once you get used to it.
---
So it teaches bad habits.
---
Now I am going to get downvoted into oblivion.
---
BIG FUCK YOU TO MY TWO TEAMMATES WHO DECIDED TO JUST LEAVE ME ON THE HOOK WHEN I HAD TO DO 3 GENS SOLO CAUSE YA'LL WERE TOO BUSY HIDING IN LOCKERS AND FARMING EACHOTHER OFF THE HOOKS
---
x)
---
Awesome. Try it with another killer. Make another killer look B A.
---
I find the opposite. A rank reset survivor has to rely somewhat on teammates, while a killer being reset doesn't really change anything. At most during rank reset it's gonna be hell for survivors unless they play swf for a bit. I mean rank 1 killers going around what rank 15?....smart
---
well that's weird as egc isn't showing on the clip. i didn't even know this game had any bugs /s
---
Can't reply to your other comment, but maybe reread that shit, cunt.
---
Nice throw.
---
Hahahaha that fog really added to it, I got a kick outta this
---
While I do like this point you're trying to make. The problem is that setting those traps take time.  
---
Time = Gens.
---
Even if you do have traps at loops. Some survivors will willingly run into traps if you're chasing someone else.
---
r/subsifellfor
---
The test subject blade makes a custom sound too.
---
But what if the last gen pops in a chase and I’m healthy
---
If it slows down the game wether or  not you have NOED, that's good. The killer has more time to get kills and the survivors  has more time to get unhooks and all.
---
"force"
---
Thanks bro
---
i just got called “ a legion cunt “ &amp; to “ choke on a dick “ rn for using Legion. lol geez
---
I’d honestly love her as a survivor. That would be cool. And btw I love your art style! It’s so cute! ❤️💖💞
---
What is this, a gif for ants?
---
-3 minutes into the match
---
Honestly, I don't play without it as I have a shit memory and can never remember where totems should spawn.
---
&gt;I think its a bit daft to call it a short cut after all the whole aim for survivors is to do gens.
---
That's because you have more empathy for the survivor's objective than you do the killer's. 'Poor innocent survivor players just trying to do the objective' is a really common trope here so I don't blame you, but your objective isn't any more or less noble or urgent than your opponent's.
---
This is so cringe
---
I wish I had the audio to me and my friends party with it, we both yelled and then laughed so hard.
---
That's fair. I was speaking from experience and it's very rare that ever happens. Don't think it's happened once even
---
Now THIS is a good fix
---
IDK but just saying they're being greedy is just as much speculation.
---
#NOOOOO
---
Hm. I didn't buy it so I wouldn't know.
---
In that case I have no idea.
---
I tried searching him up cause ive never heard of him before, but nothing came up on youtube, google, or twitch. Was he banned?
---
Completely new model + "new" female sounds, I guess?
---
Nicely done. Hand drawn?
---
Yeah actually went searching around cause I really wanted to see if this troll was that salty.
---
This is why i just hit delete before reading
---
Omg thank you 😭💚
---
Okay how do you use the shards to unlock characters? When I was looking at it it only said I could use gold(paid currency) to get them.
---
I think that'd be fair. She's definitely the slowest killer when not blinking. So boosting her speed a bit so she could actually be viable without blinking while leaving the opportunity for blinks but punishing you if you miss seems fair to me.
---
At least then every match wouldn't just be a blinkfest.
---
Temple of Purgation is hell for everyone but new Freddy. On new Freddy, nobody questions a single tile having three pallets.
---
I think it's really stupid how they cost more, Instead of just spending 10€ and getting just enough to buy it. You either have to buy 20€ worth of In-game cash or 10€ and then 5€.
---
According to killers mains if they can't 4k every single game it's unfair.
---
It's even more terrifying!
---
The colouring is just icing on this already awesome cake.
---
Too bad I won’t see him until April next year!
---
NOED. Downvote.
---
I'm having problem with both sides, I can't even SWF right now, it doesn't load
---
Should I go back to dbd
---
This is really good, you should colour the first comic too! :)
---
D a r n
---
All these downvotes from sour ass kids cause i'm having problems with the game. makes total sense. downvote me some more. bunch of petty ass faggots i swear lmao. just cause it doesn't happen to you doesn't mean it isn't happening to anyone else.
---
It has a lot of bugs. Egc isnt showing up bc when I was holding him the timer ran out and he didn't die
---
Yeah I'm having problem with both sides, it really sucks, had been like this all day
---
If it ever happens, don't you think it requires dedicated servers first? 
---
9 players relying on the stability of 1 person seems kinda rough.
---
Level 15
---
Small game is now a bloodpoint farming perk lol
---
Because it creates a new atmosphere for the marked survivor that we've yet to see in this game before. It would be revolutionary, somewhat like when Ash was released. I mean, just imagine the implications and different ways this would motivate the survivors to play.
---
yeah. the servers have been noticeably worse today. hopefully fixed soon.
---
Oh, awesome, most of my hours are of me playing killer. :o
---
Oinkers is a real sub lol, check under the "other tabs" bit in the header for this sub.
---
The survivor getting their trap off in the first two boxes has not been my experience.
---
When I play pig, games rarely make it to endgame. I do a full stall build though.
---
Thank you :)
---
Well I mean, there’s 1 now
---
There are some people who just want the killers to never win again
---
I don't play solo ever so I can always tell my teammates to keep working on gens and stuff. I've been using it and I'm liking it so far.
---
He is very bad, generally. His traps are pretty bright, and the time that you'll take to lay your traps in halfway decent spots will allow survivors to churn out a gen or two before you're even ready. But, well, he can be really fun when he comes together.
---
Gonna complain I didn’t give the last guy hatch?
---
\*whacks with guitar, flips over, shoves guitar neck up Ash\*
---
Probably the hype. 
---
Depending on how the license agreement works the license holder either gets a percentage of each sale or BHVR paid a fee upfront. If they paid a fee upfront they probably increased the price on the one with the most hype as a way to quickly reach the break even point.
---
Rarity doesn't mean anything with cosmetics because there's no scarcity mechanic for cosmetics.
---
Oh my god... I think I am in love.
---
I get that and I don’t have empathy for survivors lol trust me, I play killer mainly and I do have moments where I wish I had NOED(tbagging at pallets makes me die inside). But I just can’t bring myself to use it is all
---
This... seems a bit defensive.
---
What you said and what you're responding to can both be true.
---
Which one? Idk what you’re talking about?
---
Bout to kill the survivors with diabetes
---
*questionable dab*
---
Good to know, so far the only killer I liked was the hag, the nurse looks fun but her dash on Xbox doesn’t feel good cuz you can’t turn when you end it
---
This happened to me the killer ended up dcing. I was gonna dc but I had a friend who made it out and he told me I had made 30k bp and the killer only had 7k. Billy was okay with it he said he did bad and he didn’t mind losing the points. I felt pretty bad for him though :/ bhvr needs to atleast fix game breaking bugs such as these.
---
While I would like to see them, wouldn't Pennywise and Pinhead be on the same/similar level of power to the entity itself? I don't exactly see them taking orders.
---
You don't have to buy anything. No one is getting defensive about you not wanting to spend money. The problem is going after people who do. I could not care less if you don't want to spend money on cosmetics. It has no impact on me and I get to enjoy whatever I buy. 
---
The people getting "defensive" are the people crying about others spending money and not fighting for free cosmetics.
---
Ngl I suck at DBD
---
I like me some JoJo memes
---
Good call.
---
Everyone loses sometimes. The nurse isnt impossible to win against.
---
I do, but that's because I play killer too and understand that Pig, Leatherface, etc. Just aren't good for the game the way they are.
---
Heh heh heh... Balick
---
... no We’ll Make It is one of the better free perks. Perks like Left Behind and This is not happening need buffs.
---
Yeah I get some error codes here and there to about not being able to connect
---
I think he's saying that just like this set of cosmetics, BHVR are gonna be prickteases and keep the best for last.
---
He made a passing comment about how some people seem like they compulsively buy cosmetics. Which may be true.
---
I just think you're overreacting a bit. No one is crying here, and no one is "going after" anyone. We're just talking.
---
Happened to me once as hag , needed the daily so i didnt mind waiting for her to dc
---
I've tried arguing this in the past but to no avail. 
---
If BHVR wants the 'Golden Standard' to be 2 live, 2 die, that means in an average game all the generators will be repaired. Which means in most games, the gates are getting powered and opened. It's just what's supposed to happen.
---
This means that after the 5th generator, the killer hasn't 'lost'. Which seems to be where a ton of salt for perks like NOED spring up because people assume that at that point, they're owed their 5k BP escape bonus.  Which I kind of understand, you go through the entire game only to get cock-blocked at the very end. 
---
But I think everyone could do with remembering that the time between the 5th generator popping and the last survivor leaving/dying is a perfectly valid part of the game.
---
Brand New Parts?
---
As long as you don't keep staring at me, sure  🤗
---
The killer already knew someone was there, since the gen finished. Gens don't progress without a survivor on them. You seem to keep going around this point. Nothing else matters in what you've been saying.
---
Possibly, but they should tell us that.  Otherwise assume they set this price.
---
If I accidentally farm someone I body block for them, even if I’m injured.
---
I believe I have that exact jacket. How quaint.
---
Yeah the head looks shite
---
Dont do that dont give me hope
---
But it could still be both?
---
I seriously doubt anyone feels shamed at all about having money :D
---
I'm not trying to aggravate you, I promise, I just have a different view than you on this. That's OK. Anyway have a good day!

Noises made. Kate and iirc Tapp are quiet, but Quentin and David are loud. Apart from cosmetics, that's literally the only reason.
---
this works ten times better because of the cartoon face instead of the real one
---
Okay, but only if I consistently escape and get 4ks. Otherwise the other team is being toxic.
---
Her addons are what make her OVERpowered. Without addons, I still believe she’s the strongest Killer in the game, but I also believe that every killer should be balanced to be relatively as strong as no addon Nurse.
---
&gt;Why complain about it and call the devs greedy
---
Because they are. If a game has 10 dollars and 50 dollar choices and the devs make a skin 10.01 dollars, they are being greedy assholes. Thats it, no other arguments have to be made here. The devs are milking people for money, because they saw they were excited. No excuses for that
---
Huh
---
Obviously it's an insult to your fellatio abilities (unless the recipient is into that sort of thing?)
---
Perfection. Well done.
---
Someone with sense in this hell hole
---
I had to block all non-friend messages on my Xbox account just because of the toxicity from this game's playerbase. I think you'd be better off hiding the endgame chat and making your profile private. I doubt BHVR will be doing anything about it anytime soon, even one of the game's most popular twitch streamers gets stream sniped and harassed on the daily.
---
Well when her base design is p shitty, and the new ones are darker aka free sneak points it's kind of a no brainer.
---
I hope its BHVR tweaking things from the optimization, we havent heard from that in a while
---
&gt;Totems are strewn about randomly, in sometimes VERY well hidden places. Finding all 5 can be quite the chore.
---
I often find totems just by traveling to each gen. They're not exactly that hard to find exept maybe on indoor maps, and even then long-time survivors have all of the spawning spots memorized. 
---
&gt;And this allows them to be ready and search for them.
---
Survivors should already "be ready \[to\] search for them." Totems always spawn on every map, lmao. Survivors shouldn't have stuff to hold their hand. 
---
&gt;However, this still provides the issue of Totems sometimes being STUPIDLY well hidden.
---
It's not an issue. It's RNG. Sometimes you get fucked over by RNG, and that's ok. That's how this game works, on the elements of uncertainty and variables. It seems like you want stuff to be gauranteed, and that's not how this game works. 
---
&gt;Bottom line, NO ONE likes playing perfect all game, not getting hit at all, opening a gate and BARELY getting hit by the killer, oops NOED, and getting sacrificed. Sure, you still pip. But it robs you of victory and a good chunk of bloodpoints.
---
As if the game is over just because you got the last gen done. Survivors are entitled as fuck if they expect to escape just because they got the last gen done. The game isn't over until you escape or die. On top of all of that, if you get hit by NOED, you **didn't** play "perfect" since you obviously fucked up and didn't cleanse all of the totems. And "barely"? Either you got hit or you didn't, there is no "he barely hit me". Finally, victory should be your BP, not escaping.
---
As they rightly can and should. SWF on voice comms goes against the whole design of this game.
---
I mean we new that was gonna happen..
---
I understand what you're saying I just wish there was a legitimate secondary objective instead of cleansing totems because you don't want to get one shot. Also it should tell survivors they are exposed as soon as the gens are popped. They are literally exposed but the game doesn't tell you to help the killer.

people will think that yakuyoke and PB are a yoinking build, but after you hook someone after yoinking, you will see  who decides to stay in gens and who are on the move, try to yoink a second one, once that happens, go for slashing the injured rescued previous one, the fun begins there. No need for more yoinking except people who go for totems

i caught one random streamer with it, so you can see the fuckery it causes:

Shards are earned through levelling up your account. Playing any game will give you XP, which then rewards shards on each level up. Once you have enough shards (9000 per non-licensed character), you go to the Characters tab in the shop, and it'll give you the option to buy them for shards. Licensed characters from movies are only available for real money purchase.

This game would've been 100% more scarier if it was first person
---
Crazy how experienced huntresses can just feel if it will make it. Muscle memory is weird!
---
Then every killer should run identical perks?
---
I know, it still makes me sad Pig though. At least they look great!
---
That's what I call a pigga
---
Dude I feel so bad when I'm killer (rank 12) and get like rank 20's and rank 15's. And it happens a lot more than you'd think
---
no, you don't. The problem here is the skin costs 1180 auric cells, and you can buy 1100 auric cells for 10 euros, but because it costs 80 more, you have to buy another pack worth 5 euros, and won't be able to spend the leftover on anything.
---
Well, that is the lowest-ranked Killer we have now, so true, but it sort of furthers my point.
---
They just justify it so they dont feel bad when they act like a miserable asshole
---
That viewpoint is a major problem that people who dislike NOED have. They see it as rewarding a "bad" killer, rather than taking the effort and time to forsee the risk of NOED and actively work towards denying it. Each totem is at max 15 seconds or so, and with each survivor doing one and the last one doing two, it shouldn't take that much time to cleanse all of them before going back to gens. I've often found totems randomly while just running from gen to gen. People need to learn that instead of considering NOED a "reward" for a "bad" killer, they should consider it as a punishment for bad survivors not respecting the risk of NOED potentially being in the match and focusing only on slamming out gens.
---
Thank you! I HATE it
---
Not gonna lie, most Pig mains on this sub are annoying as hell. Its like they come from Tumblr.
---
Yeah im having issues myself as killer
---
A killer can just wait out DS. I see what you mean about Adrenaline kind of. I lose way more games with the "solo survivor experience" so I only play SWF now and I feel like that is the direction the game is going for many people.
---
Lol yea thank God I have a ps4 or I would've had to forfeit these points it's been about an hour and a half since the glitch

i envisioned them as earmuffs, and the notes were myers humming, but it could totally work as headphones xd i wonder that sometimes too, my dude. probably something funky.
---
The problem is if this happens, the killer will just stand there and wait for it to happen, and if it happens, a smart killer will assume you have DS and just slug you. Congrats, the game has been needlessly extended.

MadPoodle isn't his actual name. Replace mad with a synonym that begins with "A".
---
Replace Poodle with another dog that begins with "P" and is 3 letters
---
No. It would be P2W
---
I love using distortion especially with every single killer running BBQ and chili
---
He’s basically as powerful as The Entity
---
Some people will call any survivor you use toxic, it's just the way of this game.
---
Can you post the link here when you do?

"Why are you booing me? I'm right."
---
There's a type of person that doesn't play for the challenge, but for the ability to show they're "better" than other people. It wouldn't surprise me if those are the kind of people who DC if things aren't going right.
---
The pedo claim is a bit over the top imo, I hate Ochido as much as any other sane person would but the girls were in their late teens and for as far as I can find Ochido is only 20, thats nowhere near worthy of pedo claims
---
Massive creep? Yes. Pedo? No.
---
The head is supposed to be decomposed and fat
---
&gt;as survivor you ARE NOT in control, thats not your role, you didn't choose the power role in a 4v1 asymmetrical pvp multiplayer game, you choose the weaker but more numerous one
---
Looks right but this is not how the game plays most of the time now lol that's why you only see a small rotation of killers at high ranks. Cuz the balance is very blatantly on survivors atm.
---
Are you still there? O.o
---
Legion is imho F Tier, which sucks because i want to Main them, but to make it very simple : You need your Power to chase survivors, but you can't down them with it. Or in other words, Legion is only really able to down a survivor if they are braindead. At rank 10 and better, a survivor will never be catched by a non-frenzy Legion and wouldn't you know, that makes Legion literally unable to down survivors that are atleast decent. 
---
My buff suggestion would only be 2 things : Make exposed work with Frenzy, theres literally 0 reason why Nurse can make use of, for example, MYC but Legion can't. Second buff would be that already injured survivors are downed even with Frenzy on. Now if they have a deep wound (the effect Legion's Frenzy afflicts) it would be like now, that they don't get downed, but if they are injured and don't have a deep wound Frenzy should down. Because right now all a survivor has to do is mend the deep wound and they can just tank another Frenzy hit.
---
Because on some maps the game fails to reach the minimal amount of Pallets and starts placing them closer together

I’m gonna say she is thicc

I agree on the secondary objective, but the totems and inherent risk of NOED potentially being in the match should stay. And if the game told everyone they were exposed as soon as the last gen was done, every single survivor would go into insta-stealth mode and nothing would get done. Of course it should stay that way to help the killer, they've been waiting all match long to use their perk or risk losing it. It's meant to be a surprise perk.
---
Ohh my lifeee!
---
I like the idea, but what if you changed the pitch of the sound to make the entire bottle line from "land down under" just from that one missed swing?
---
Legion sliced david while in feral frenzy, he saw your heartbeat but decided to ignore you since you were wasting time
---
Speaking of bloodpoints when I first got the game on Xbox game pass (it's special edition)  I had like 100,000 blood points already despite never playing a game before but my 2 friends who also got the game didn't get bloodpoints.
---
I HATE IT WHEN NEW PLAYERS GET SALTY BECAUSE I MANAGED TO ESCAPE THE KILLER AND GET THE HATCH. MAYBE IF THEY ACTUALLY LEARN STRATEGY THEY MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN CAUGHT. DON'T GET SALTY IN CHAT.
---
That's all completely irrelevant.
---
Flashlights need a buff, but nothing should ever operate on an exploit. Justifying flashlights using a bug in the design like animation locks allowing free blinds just ensures that flashlights will never get a buff they actually need to be viable AND that the bugs will never be fixed. Oh, and it's actually 60% of the time.
---
GOT CALLED A TRASH NURSE BECAUSE I 4K'D THEM WITH BBQ1 ,NURSES, M&amp;A, SB NO ADDONS/OFFERING BUT SINCE I WAS RUNNING BBQ I'M A TRASH NURSE AND I SHOULD JUST GET GOOD RIGHT?
---
Being able to wait out DS is irrelevant. The killer has zero idea if the survivor actually has it or not until they get hit with it. The killer can slug the survivor to wait it out, but they might not even have DS. The killer is making a choice concerning the risk and potential of that survivor having DS. 
---
SWF goes against the very concept of this game and I hope the devs eventually figure out how to fix it. Survivors seem to want reliability and no mystery, which is the exact opposite of this game.
---
Wrong post, buckaroo.
---
Pretty much. I play both sides and as a survivor i cleanse a totem if i see it. I mean the bloodpoints is what we all want at the end of the day. (Well at least I do)
---
I ain't bout to be the one who leaves
