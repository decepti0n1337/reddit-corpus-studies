The level system is basically a farming simulator, forcing you to do a bit of everything, which is unrealistic. A survivor's objective is to survive. If they avoided the killer, hid successfully, won chases and didn't get hooked once, why should a team who played so efficient be penalised?
---

---
Same goes for killer. You can 4k people in a few minutes with not a single generator done. That should be a pip, I don't care what you say. This whole notion of having to make sure you get points in all categories is ridiculous for a game like this.
---
---
---
Then we should get Sujan as a survivor. Only issue is if Kindred should be one of her teachables (Probably not.)
---
We also have Clyde, Murf, etc. I'd love to see all the "proto-survivors" turn into actual characters.
---
Yeah I don’t know why I typed that glad you caught it so I don’t look like a complete noob.
---
I said it once and I'll say it again, I need to be as high as the rhino
---
Well the former s allegedly based on impersonal facts, and the latter based on personal anecdotes.
---
BHVR said just spinning the camera shouldn't destroy his power. It is impossible that any internal testing whatsoever was conducted as this is a very stupidly large, and extremely obvious error. You cannot test the killer internally, and not catch this bug. Literally playing a single match would of caught it. The PTB is supposed to be larger scale testing to catch things that slip through. Not the only source.
---
That Meg would've made it if she hadn't stopped.
---
Mikan is Ghostface but Exposes herself instead of Survivors
---
I love it!
---
If they were to add a killer for this. I'd nominate evil as with boomstick ( close range insta down) weilding a chainsaw for his Reg attack.
---
IVE ONLY PLAYED AGAINST A GOOD CLOWN ONCE AND PLAYING AS HIM IS UNDERWHELMING SINCE MOST OF THE TIME SURVIVORS PREDICT WHERE ITS THROWING WITH THE ANIMATION AND ARE OUT OF THE RADIUS BY THEN SO IT BECOMES AN ATTEMPT TO JERK YOUR AIM WHICH SUCKS ON CONSOLE
---
Add me and we can party up
---
Name is same as here
---
They could've done this before EGC. There is simply a time limit now.
---
that sloooo mo
---
She's the technical services manager.
---
It happens so much so me and my swf we end up bringing things like adrenaline and wake up for that exact purpose
---
Good Bot
---
Didn't Murf turn out to be Dwight though? Or was he a completely separate character? I'd love a chapter made just to celebrate where they started out, bring out Murf, Sujan and the other OG ones since we've got a couple of "chapters" that are more like paragraphs since they're just the killer.
---
The timelimit is the best part, because you can force them to go trough it till they get sacrificed, and they have no chance of escaping, it's basically forcing them to deal with the unevitable, and it's wonderfull
---
While as I agree with you at the start, the killers should be terrifying, the rest of that is bs. I am a complete killer main, but that should not be the case. The killer will- as long as the game is structured as it is- always have the harder time, and that’s the way it’s supposed to be. The devs try very hard to get the game to be 50/50, and while I’ll respect your opinion that the killer should have an easier time, I think that would be completely stupid. Your ability to do well is based off of your skill, and usually not from outside help (e.g moris) so therefore, your skill should determine how the game turns out. I’m sorry if I lost you along that, it was kind of whatever I thought of, but overall, that’s not how it should be
---
Being brutal and being unfair are two different thing. Being the final survivor during EGC is litterally impossible once hatch is shut. I get if no gens have been completed, the survivor not only doesnt deserve to escape, but they most likely wouldn't. However, imagine mew have 4 gens done but you're the last survivor. Theres a purrty good chance that mew at least deserve a shot at escape, yet EGC makes it litterally impossible against anyone who isnt utter shit st the game
---
No but there is plenty of places to loop unless people are throwing down pallets, and if a killer does kick the gen I doubt they're just gonna leave instantly if they know people are around.
---
It would depend on the map tbh, places that have corn is horrid for Ghostface since you can’t stalk past the corn, but a place like Haddonfield would be great since there’s too many vantage points it would be hard for a survivor too see you.
---
I think you confuse “bully” with “power role”. Just because a killer is the power role doesn’t mean they have to try and ruin someone’s fun to “be a bully”. 
---
You being an asshole on purpose is different than playing a mechanic introduced into the game. EGC favors killers. I don’t know who hurt you for you to need to feel personal power over someone in a game.
---
That’s not a valid method either way. Survivor queue times and killer queue times are miles different, simply queuing at same time will not help get together.
---
Does tabula rasa deny adrenaline? Also love this, most people making fan content don’t know how to balance, this is good
---
Wait do Jane's tits actually bounce that much?
---
It used to be when they were shorter...
---
What’s with “...” every message lol.
---
Idk im edgy today by the looks of it
---
You're contradicting yourself.
---
If he's as strong as Wraith, he **definitely** needs buffs.
---
Well then you get chased? If someone brings the killer over to me I’m not gonna complain I’ll run around with the killer to get those evade points. Do you not like evade points?
---
DON'T FORGET THE PEOPLE WHO UNHOOK WITH THE KILLER NEAR THEN INSTANTLY IMMERSE AND LEAVE THE UNHOOKED PERSON IN THE OPEN BLEEDING EVERYWHERE SO YOU ONLY HAVE ONE TARGET, THANKS FOR THE HELP BLENDETTE
---
Well, sometimes i feel a bit of mercy for the survivors, and do let them escape trough the gate, but really only if i steamrolled the game.
---
Memory might be fuzzy, but I think the line was always "Me and my buddy Keith!"
---
Ghostface’s power is bugged.

---
&gt;We'd love to address everything as soon as possible, but sometimes we don't get the chance to squeeze everything in before an update.
---
Then why didn’t you do a proper test of this instead of sticking it in the beta? Beta testing isn’t meant to be a free QA/AT team.
---
Here comes the Trapper\~ You'd better watch out for his traps \*Trap sound\*! Here comes the Trapper\~ You'd better eat some ginger snaps \*Trap sound\*! The Trapperrrrr\~! Jazz, jazz hands (insert Samination reading the superchat here)
---
Yea that’s pretty true, and after Freddy they’d totally rather put a perk or killer on the weaker side than stronger, which I’ll admit is really stupid. They have this thing called the ptb that lets them test the stronger things out and nerf/buff accordingly, but they’re afraid of the outcry. It’d be nice if they got out of their and the community’s comfort zone- at least on the ptb so they could actually make a strong and fun perk/ killer
---
Better to release a killer weak rather than OP
---
I have both Quentin and Jeff at prestige 3. I love daddy Jeff, but Quentin's P3 Feddy-claw marks across his face are just too cool for me to swap him
---
Congratulations. Your goal is to make people suffer. That makes you an unhappy loser. 
---
I wouldn’t admit to being a sadist. That’s incredibly weird.
---
Homo erectus survivor when?
---
Seriously, Isaac Clarke (Dead Space) would be amazing as a Survivor.
---
I could definitely see one of his perks being a Difficult Skillcheck when cleansing Totems to immediately destroy it via stomp.
---
I always liked the idea of ghost face being able to blend in with survivors the same way he does in the movies, but this seems way more unique and more like ghost face than the ptb ghost face does. We’ve had a lot of killer repeats where their abilities are quite similar (plague, legion) (Myers, ghostface) and this would be a refreshing change
---
Billy is limited by pallets and windows, which Hunterss can work around.
---
Billy HAS to deal with a pallet normally, Huntress can throw over the loop, as an example.
---
Skill ceiling doesn't make a character weaker.
---
Orrrrrr you could just stop being an asshole and end the game.
---
What perks do you run
---
Her boobs look more like they are growing and shrinking than bouncing lol
---
Exactly you can have one survivor stare him down the entire match and negate his power while the other three do gens.
---
Where do I do that?
---
They probably made their own look for him because they couldn’t get the rights for the cloak from movies at the start. Also I think they used own concept to be original on their interpretations and dbd lore (as dbd lore isn’t specific / matching to the killers movie lore)
---
Seriously, this dude is just digger a deeper and deeper "I'm a fucking creepy weirdo" hole with every reply.
---
oh no
---
he's here
---

Pretty much. If I don't have Ruin on a Killer I use NOED to punish people who don't cleanse blanks. And when I get hit with NOED I feel like a fucking doof. If we genrush and wreck a killer, but don't take the other few minutes to cleanse totems when we handedly beat them before, then do we really own that "victory"?
---
4 and a half laugh
---
Profuse Sweating: Your intense perspiration under any pressure is a natural lubricant. While in the killer's terror radius, your vault speed and wiggle speed are increased by 20%
---
Billy doesn't move at full speed either. But from what I remember LF moves at 85% ms when revving his chainsaw and Billy is around 100%. LF's chainsaw is easier to hit, because you don't have to aim(that's why I sai he was the easiest killer in the game), but this slow down makes it so you can't even use his power against good survs, unless they fck up.   
---
So we're at point where buffing his ms when revving may make him OP, but not buffing it makes him being the worst killer in the game?
---
well, after you spend months being able to use only 3-4 killers in red ranks if you want any chance to win you become a bit salty I guess
---
That reminds of this  
---

Stalking with to get Evil Within to match
---
I would hope that’s not what it means. 
---
Michael is only immune to this because he needs to get out of tier 1 as fast as possible. Amanda isn’t immune. And Ghostface is closer to Pig than T1 Michael. 
---
People also act like OoO is a meta perk and that it’s being run because it’s meta rather than knowing exactly what killer they’re up against.
---
But it's very adult content, extremely violent and stuff, disturbing to a child
---
I ATE A SANDWICH TODAY AND MY GRANDMA PUT ALOT OF MAYO ON THAT BITCH, I SAID I DIDN'T LIKE IT AND I GOT PUNISHED FOR BEING UNGRATEFUL. THIS IS WHY I HATE CATHOLICS
---
If Plague's power is no-mither on survivors, so be it
---
The worst part is that his name has a space in it.
---
I make sure to emphasize it just so my friends know how stupid it is.
---
If it's that broken still, maybe they won't release him.
---
Yeah but that’s why I said I hope they get the rights later down the line also is find it hilarious to have Sydney in a game with Freddy or Myers because in the Scream universe they are just movies also the design just doesn’t work on him he’s not the same with out his cloak (I couldn’t care less about him not being one of the killers from the movies because there’s literally 7 different killers in the movies ghost faces whole thing is it’s a bunch of copy cat killers)
---
SWF is a helluva drug
---
No its different because it's the survivor who's the one staring in this one
---
Given how he (is supposed to) stalk people before striking, you’d think “The Stalker” would have been obvious. I know, Mike stops too, but The Shape is more accurate and appropriate
---
Certainly, you are taking this way too serious, you pretend like im bullying people into depression, or stealing candy from babies.
---
All that is happening is harmless videogame banter, and you somehow try to twist this simple thing as something menacingly and evil.
---
Is what i do rude? Yeah, it kinda is, do i feel bad? No, nobody should, it's videogame banter.
---
Do i need to justify my actions towards you? Also certainly not, so goodbye.
---
Pretty sure on the known issues list on the PTB said the unicorn block had the wrong text.
---
I’m not sure if you noticed cause I was writing it as you were writing this, but some killers are just designed for newer players and so they fall off the higher you go, can’t really have an extremely easy to play killer be in the same level as those who are extremely difficult to play.
---
This would also make sense since he’s the killer of a deconstruction of the whole genre
---
That solved the issue!
---

Feel free to block me on your way out! 
---
Creep.
---
DO step in his traps
---
Thanks
---
Well, i guess you also want to change the hatch because it reward the survivors for not doing all the gens.
---
And a one and a two and a...whatever comes after two.
---
The lore behind the game is that you are entertaining the entity. No one wants to watch a clean sweep (gens or kills) that's done in 5 mins. Hence, no pip for not putting on a good show.
---
Yeah, the fact that it seems like they don’t have an internal QA is the issue.
---
Nice format, this is a good find
---
This can have two meanings and I'm not sure if you meant it to
---
If NOED was tied to money, then why not reinstate it as it was; an actual uncounterable buff that triggered upon generator completion? Better yet, if you are to be believed, BHVR should make a Super-NOED perk on the next killer to make BANK.
---
I'll also remind you that apparently Base Game &gt; DLC since NOED is provided free of charge to killers just from base killer perks.
---
&gt; LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE
---
I agree, though for different reasons...
---
He’s so cute he’s the reason i began to main trapper whenever i decide to play killer
---
i didnt even notice ghost face was in this game I dont see him in the menu at all?
---
Yes... it's a test.. and we're supposed to respond to the problems in it.. or else the devs won't know
---
Stop whining about us complaining it's so stupid
---
Ouch, as a clown main that’s sadly true isn’t it
---
BHVR hasn't made an OP killer in so long they're clearly scared of survivor backlash :((( ^^^/s
---
at this point i think gamer girls in video games are extremely stereotypical
---
This went from Florida Man to Moose Season in a paragraph.
---
I don't know for sure what will be on sale. The chapters may be on sale in the psn store starting June 7th for days of play. The chapters would include characters. The actual 3rd anniversary may put them on sale as well.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Mmmmm. ;)
---
Can't be bothered to block people over a reddit argument, if you feel like doing so however i won't mind.
---
Thanks 😁
---
I was in a match with 3 Jeff’s this morning
---
No DLC needed if you're willing to grind or wait for perks in the shrine. Are you going to be playing mostly survivor or killer, or doing both?
---
yes
---
Every time he hits you a quote from Hell’s Kitchen plays.
---
“YOU’RE BURNING THE GEN, PAY ATTENTION PANINI HEAD”
---
ScottJund, ZubatLEL, Tru3ta1ent, Puppers. 
---
Monto is good but only on YouTube while these others are streamers and have YouTubes. 
---
Tru3 is more of the analytical player who talks through killer plays. Zubat is more your “sarcastic” killer who is regarded as the best killer in the game. Scott has a good video on YouTube for how to run map tiles as killers and is a pretty good huntress.
---
So... just pretend it's a copycat killer?
---
Yes. Yes they do.
---
"Our expectations for you were low, but holy fuck"
---
My daughter LOVES him in the Parody and he's one of  my top 3 killers and the reason I got it. Also the reason I'll never regret getting it. But a few people on here seem to have sticks up their butts and don't understand that. My little girl smiled and started singing the song when she saw it, it was adorable. Totally worth it.
---
I have so much trouble understanding why Clown is considered too low. Even without good addons I have really good kill rate with him. He breaks loops so easily. In similar situations with all other killers, when a survivor just barely makes it to a pallet, I never have that issue with him because of the slowdown from his gas.
---
No thanks.
---
Best Mori in the game
---
That's basically what she does in higher ranks, but being injured isn't much of a hindrance if you know what you're doing.
---
I'm not a part of anything but goes off.
---
Blame Microsoft being a piece of shit
---
My main problem is the cloak looks off and I also again would like to see Sydney in the game and have a woodsborrow map
---
I don’t think that was swf, that happened to me in a round where I was solo and everyone got kicked out at the every start of the match
---
I never see Adam or Jeff unless I'm playing as them.
---
PTB stands for Public Test Build, my dude.
---
Your daughters happiness&gt;&gt;&gt; random ppl on the internet... definitely don’t need anyone on here’s approval or to bring you down about it!! I’m happy you got it and your daughter loves it!! It’s really cute!!
---
[removed]
---
He's only playable on the Public Test Build (PTB) until June 18th.
---
Survivors need to stop feeling they are the ones who are underpowered. The kill statistics even prove otherwise.
---
I’m sure it will happen in the future with them wanting to be on every platform
---
Well, it looks off because it isn't the Scream killer, kinda like how Billy doesn't look entirely like Bubba
---
Okay so some killers can beat it, but if you aren't those killers you're screwed. Other skills are all for a limited period of time, and you shouldn't be forced to run a perk just in case someone might run a certain perk.
---
PTB changes do look for the better. I mean, still going to be annoying, but you aren't punished for doing what you're expected to so it's tolerable.
---
DS was broken op and super unhealty for the game, sorry about your crutch biased baby surv main
---
Well, they’re both quite shit but at least on some maps like the Treatment theatre or the Game you can consistently see blood trails with hemorrhage. Blindness on the other hand is just a minor nuisance for the survivor and it only being for 60 second is the icing on top.
---
wELl i DoNT hAVe bOnD yEt
---
Constructive criticism is a far cry from incessant shit post bitching, to be fair.
---
Working with the killer is a bannable offense. Record the match, report everyone involved in the post-game stats, and submit a support ticket on the official website with the recording attached.
---
Hey I’m rank 13 atm but I usually hang between 8 - 12. My gamertag is Shwaaayy, i’ll be on tomorrow 😁
---
Can’t loop me on a tractor, cuz i’m moving faster
---
It’s gonna be a lot of borrowed time and MOM in the future
---
Survior didn't have to come back though
---
Then both sides will be really boring. Chases are the fun part of the game.
---
If you spend all of your time hiding and then instantly going down and dying then the game wouldn't be nearly as popular.
---
Just make it so that the chili addons increase his movement speed while charging his chainsaw. It's not like they actually do anything anyway.
---
Sure, the first time you encounter a survivor.
---
From that point on, they'll never cleanse. Vomiting on them will do literally nothing, and all you can do is run at them and try to m1.
---
Gotta love his little trot too that cracks me up lol
---
Well they got the rights for the mask it’s just a hop skip and a jump away from getting the rights to the cloak (also again I would LIKE to have Sydney in the game) now that I think about I’m not even sure if they need the movie rights for the cloak I think that cloak is apart of Funworlds copyright so they actually have the cloak maybe I’m not sure
---
From what I can gather from your post, it isn’t very much fun for you if people just afk and wait it out, so what’s even the point?
---
Nah, it's Dwight! Source: my dreams
---
Well were they supposed to fix that? Bc that was today
---
I disagree. Her power is very ineffective since it doesn’t stop her being looped and eating pallets, and most survivors won’t cleanse until the gens are finished and by that point it’s too late. If a killers power is solely dictated by the survivors it needs changes. I do agree that survivors need a reason too cleanse instead of just holding the broken effect and just gen rush too win.
---
What do you want them to do?
---
If you make killer super strong then the game just becomes stealth based and everybody is going to be bored out of their mind.
---
Well I mean that’d be nice but there are no killers that have a higher than 115 movement without abilities so who knows the devs like consistency
---
The most human killers should be able to T-bag change my mind
---
\&gt;Killer is too easy
---
\&gt;I main Leatherface **when I play killer**
---
Just because you main him vs 20's doesn't mean playing killer is easy or that he's strong.
---
Most people don't afk but run away, it's the chasing thats fun, it else gets a bunch more bloodpoints for me and the survivor so win/win anyways.
---
If they do end up AFK'ing, well then i just bring them to the exit gate for real and signal that they can leave.
---
It's just simply the Thrill of the Hunt
---
Whoa whoa dont waste your jerma bucks! Invest in some Baldcoin first!
---
In one timeline you are ghostface
---
I thought killer wanted a quick ending to the game not drawn out? You know, survivors staying behind or hatch stand off.  It sounds like you are doing the same thing. 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Dwight's with Trapper.
---
Asian people being very good at video game's isn't anti stereotypical
---
people think it's a survival game when surviving only gives you some points, you can still depip if you "survive" this isn't friday the 13th lol
---
this is crazy inaccurate and the meme is dead anyway...
---
Dude this is nostalgia
---
Lol you're one of those edgy kids that gets pleasure out of ruining other people's fun. Get outta here with that shit.
---
There’s a difference between complaining and actually giving Feedback, everyone calling them out and insulting them isn’t feedback it’s just complaining . State your problems without the insults and it’s fine, 
---
it’s tiresome to see so many people in this subreddit act like the new chapter is going to be the worst thing when it’s not even complete yet
---
Disagree. Hag is good but no where near A tier too me. She’s too slow and is just an M1 killer even with her traps. Plus her traps are easily delt with by flashlights and crouching. Once her traps are popped she’s just not viable, esspecially with MoM.
---
IT'S SORT OF WEIRD BUT I THINK IT'S SORT OF NECESSARY FOR THE MIND GAME THINGS? LIKE, ONCE YOU KNOW IT'S SPIRIT YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU HEAR THE TR SHE COULD BE WOOSHING. SORT OF SUCKS BUT LIKE, W/E.
---
It clearly says party size, not individuals.
---
Was this post inspired by a comment I made earlier in this sub?
---
Well, i never said i dislike drawn out matches, maybe others did, but i enjoy them for banter, well, unless it results in them going afk instead of running, then i just let them leave.
---
Hey man,  I used Hag for my first game and did A OK!  I think I actually won the game!
---
I like her, she's kind of cute.
---
Well then, think I may have a second main
---
GHOSTY NO GHOSTING!
---
This would work in solo games. Unfortunately, SWF would destroy this killer.
---
I just want to point out that Myers used to have an audio cue that played the iconic slow piano riff that **ONLY** played for the Survivor who was being stalked in EW1. It was amazingly creepy and put you on high alert to look around to break the LOS to Myers stalking you. This was removed because it removed the "viability" of him being designed as a stealthy Killer. Over here we have Ghostface; A Killer that takes a little bit of mechanics from both The Pig and Myers. Both of which are stealth Killers, but Ghostface has mapwide alerts and not only that he gives off an audio cue when he's approaching closer to you and it's directional! The worst part about this is that Survivors can spot you in tall grass, reeds and corn of all things yet you can't even see them and you bet that didn't even spot you, but because they have a camera with 180 FOV it counts as being spotted. Like Ghostface stands no chance at even using his power with all these cues being given to Survivors. Even less by being spotted with easily with a 3rd person camera.
---
Lmao thanks
---
Exactly, people think that their just a bunch of co-eds running from a maniac and that once they get out they go home and talk about the horrible experience and maybe get a book deal or two. But live or die, right back into the fog you go. There truly is no escaping the entity for survivors or killers.
---
Yes
---
It's 4head you 4head Kappa
---
Nah man he had, play with your food
---
As a console player, I’m not quite up to par on Ghostface, is he currently snapped out of his stalk by looking at him or something?
---
Often times it’s the closest loop to them, they may have even already used one and need another cause pallet got broke or window blocked, you never know why someone is running a direction while in a chase, best not to assume it’s to lead the killer to you until they’ve proven you wrong.
---
If they dislike it they will probably go AFK, if they do it i just bring them to the exit and let them leave, it's just lategame banter thats all, im not camping or doing stuff like this just to make people angry, i just play catch with them basically.
---
&gt;Last night I got looped endlessly by a team and if I broke the pallet I was blinded. It was pointless I just stood in the corner until they left. Granted every match isn’t like this but the fact it can be that bad says a lot.
---
And in a different match the killer ended the game in 3 minutes with 5 gens being up. The fact that it can be that bad says a lot.
---
Anecdotal arguments are great! :D
---
Thanks for all of that, I'll check out Zubat since I want to play killer mostly. I thought survivors had their own perks? I keep seeing people here telling me to play Claudette for some self healing perk that she has
---
Could decrease the time they are exposed be a good suggestion? Like, to 15 seconds instead of 20?
---
Seems fair
---
So is did Jake's  stay the same?
---
It really looked like it was
---
 Then don't no need to comment

STILL, THOSE PEOPLE ARE THE WORST. WHEN PEOPLE ARE TWITCH STREAMING ME I LIKE TO WATCH FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE AFTERWARDS, AND IT'S PRETTY FREQUENT THAT PEOPLE WHO SPEND THE ENTIRE GAME UPDATING THE REST OF THE TEAM OF YOUR EXACT POSITION AND DIRECTION CALL YOU A TRYHARD.
---
&gt;I think I'll go with my own rank 1 experience and common sense, plus the opinions of other top survivors and killers who happen to agree with me
---
So you’re not open to other opinions is what you’re saying?
---
They mainly bounce like that at the end screen.
---
man chilllllll i’m on console :-/ best i could do
---
I wish i had that amount of optimism.
---
Billy’s big advantage are open spaces and surprise chainsaws, unless you get really good at mindgaming and chases like we see at higher ranks (when he’s rarely used).
---
Myers has a godlike lunge, a fast vault, and exposes everyone without having to prep on all 4 of them.
---
Plague just becomes an M1 Killer.
---
swear on my life his power on paper sounded absolutely fucking broken, in practice i can now safely say this killer is absolutely pathetic...
---
You literally said stop complaining about a killer on the PTB. You didnt say "Hey stop insulting the devs and team" you said stop complaining about the content that we are testing.
---
"DS was broken op and super unhealthy"
---
That's a matter of perspective. I'm sorry YOU had a hard time but all DS ever did for survivors against me was buy them a few seconds before I caught them again. And I never let toxic survivors get in my head. I just kept playing and eventually killed them. 
---
"sorry about your crutch biased baby surv main"
---
I play killer and survivor respectively 
---
Killer rank 4 
---
Survivor Rank 7 
---
Thank you for your time, now to avoid wasting more and looking even dumber than you already do, you should probably go away now. 😁
---
I mean it's definately broken, just not a good broken lmao
---
The main thing people are forgetting is that if you completely fuck survivors very quickly you should pip because why must the killer play against this level of Survivors constantly? Same for survivors, if they completely shit on a killer and escape very quickly, why should they stay at the rank they are at? They should 100% get progression to a rank up. Fuck the "Lore" and everything about it, be realistic.
---
You might like Zubat’s style, or you might not. He tends to play the higher tier killers and slugs people to gain momentum. Nothing wrong with that. But I know some people want to see someone who plays every killer. Most of Zubat’s content on YouTube is highlight montages with an occasional full game here and there. He’s more of a twitch streamer. 
---
Well yeah but you can get all unique perks on any survivor so it doesn’t matter much in the long run. 
---
By the way self care is a waste of time. It’s better for noob ranks (where you’ll be) but largely useless in higher ranks. 
---
100% recommend Scott’s video on how to run tiles if you want to play Killer.
---
If NOED was a mistake from the start, i guess the hatch is also a mistake, because it reward the survivors for not doing the objectives.
---
I don't believe that you're going up against even decent survivors if you're having an easy time with killer and downing people with the chainsaw in general. Any good survivor that knows what they're doing will *not* go down to LF chainsaw unless you're running good add-ons.
---
People consistently say that Plague isn't a good killer, and while I'll never call her Billy tier, the fact that she can play the game with NOED on almost constantly (that when cleansed gives her an insane ranged attack) is kind of bonkers and people seem to forget that. Sure, she's no Billy or Myers with their mobility or lunge, but it takes very little effort to set up and even a single mistake means that someone is fucked without a second chance.

---
I should be numb to it. I've played since release. Guess it just dawned on me farther in than it should have.
---
What’s situational about an undeserved escape when the objective isn’t done?
---
I don’t know why people think that the killer’s job is to waste survivors time. Are we forgetting that the killer is the power role and that survivors should be trying to waste the killer’s time?
---
thanks for the kind words :-) love it
---
Tbh keys are lowkey op. I'm surprised more people aren't complaining about them.

---
They would make so much money though. So why the fuck not?
---
I'm not on about the hatch in general. I'm on about key use. Hatches suck ass but I barely see someone use a key to escape. I think keys are situational because you'd have to search the map over and over so the killer will have to have had spotted you at least a handful of times.
---
Well, yes, but they have to change the killer to only can execute if they down a scavenger 2 or 3 times.

---
Please tell them his perks are omega bad
---
I try to time up the music with what happens in the game so sometimes I need something to go there and I thought it was simple enough but got the point across :p
---
The whole reddit bad thing comes from dumbasses circle jerking each other and thinking that just because people agree with them that it whatever the topic is, their opinion on it must be "right"
---
I understand the point you are trying to make but releasing a character in the the game with such in obvious bug is something not even 1 guy doing an indie game in his basement would even dream of. I would say the only options are that (but who the hell knows with this dev tbh).
---
1.) They did absolutely zero in-house testing (even if it was just the PTB what competent company releases something like that without testing it? There are so many things that could go wrong) or 
---
2.) Nobody at BHVR in any department, especially QA/QC, saw it coming. Which I guess further proof that they aren't that great at their own game/ developing.
---
I'm not trying to be mean or rude, but I just wanted offer a perspective of someone that if I did the equivalent at my job, I would face serious disciplinary action or possibly termination. I really like the game, BHVR, and everything in general but I don't personally agree with the PTB justification. PTB shouldn't be doing basic QC for you.
---
I don’t know why people think Ghostface will be hitting exposed people frequently. Any good survivor near any loop will almost never get down by a Ghostface who has exposed him. 
---
Wraith loses his stealth power against the OoO as well? GF in his current form is bugged. But OoO is a high risk high reward perk. If you fix one, you have to fix the other.
---
i like that art style
---
WOAH WOAH WOAH WORST KILLER?! Boi have you been living under a rock for the past two days?!
---
Seems like he was wiggling to me, he almost got it but not quite.
---
Yes based on the survivors making mistakes. Exactly what the entire argument was about and no one is ending a match in three minutes useless people DC.
---
Wouldn't be a good idea since some people would start complaining about white washing since Claudette was originally the white girl.
---
People run Spine Chill? Im actually mind fucked right now.
---
Well if that's the case and people don't want us shitting all over the public test, maybe they could try playing the game privately first to see if their builds actually work, or are total garbage.
---
Are you dumb? The 360 camera disabling ghostface's power is not a design. It's a bug. The devs already said that it was not supposed to be that way.
---
Its not hard to sit on a gen or tunnel for one objective so you shouldnt be rewarded with “rank” for doing one part of the match.  You are rewarded with rank by doing every task which shows skill more than hiding all game on gens or camping/ tunneling.  You cant seriously tell me doing gens all game and leaving is more deserving of rank up than winning chases, helping others, doing gens &amp; taking minimal damage
---
👏STOP.👋T-BAGGING.👏IT.👋 AIN'T.👏CUTE.👋
---
No, it's that the ACTUAL plan was for it to be disabled for 20 seconds if you STARED in his direction for 1 WHOLE second. Right now it's bugged so that if you glance in his direction PERIOD, it is disabled for 20 seconds. So no, we aren't mad that it's bugged, we know it's not supposed to be this way, but the way BHVR says it should be is still horseshit.
---
That's not the point though. It's that they are apart if DbDs history so they should be represented because of that.
---
He loses his stealth power to that one survivor not the whole team unless I guess survivor with friends if the person is very good at telling them his location. Wraith can still sneak up to everyone else that does not have. Ghost face can’t. To me they should keep it so of course it can still see you just make it so it won’t cancel the guys power when the OoO dude is across the map it’s a simple fair change and I assume right now it’s just glitched
---
You should brush up your dbd etiquette. Quit acting like that.
---
Keys open hatches...?
---
There are three chests on a map without offerings, one always in the basement. The fact that someone can get a hatch opening key, which can lead to a free and undeserved escape, is stupid.
---
It is glitched. OoO will work the exact same way on GF as it does on wraith. Safe to assume it won’t be glitched in his final form.
---
THAT’S NOT MY BABY
---
You’re more like a Cunt then anything.
---
Ya hopefully. That’s the only thing really sorta messed up with him. Once they fix the glitches I think he will be fine
---
I mean, Ghostface isn't actually out yet.
---
If he launches with few changes he'll probably be alot worse than Leatherface.
---
Until then, Leatherface is the worst.
---
&gt;Legion wasn't  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Spirit wasn't  
---
&gt;Plague wasn't  
---
&gt;Clown wasn't
---
Yeah, but at least their powers are working. Imagine legion not being able to sprint. Spirit not being able to phase. Plague not being able to puke. Clown not being able to throw bottles. Ghostface is like that. He is technically just an m1 killer.
---
All I need is a Stu face or something.
---
I know they open hatches? I'm not stupid. I'm saying that I barely see them actually get used. They aren't as favourable as a toolbox, medkit or flashlight. So don't jump to conclusions.
---
When you say it isn't earned...didn't somebody have to earn bloodpoints to get one? If that isnt earned, than neither are killer addons.
---
I mean... Bill showed up in Payday 2, so there IS a connection.
---
Run it and see what happens
---
Keep moving the goalposts there bud. Flat out you said that no one should complain about a killer who is 2 weeks from release being so bad as to be nearly unplayable.
---
Well you're unbroken and therefore get full survival, you also get full generators so there's two iridescents. You should get points for stealth and avoiding the killer so you haven't needed to be in a chase, you can look at it like tormenting the Killer by not allowing them to chase or "feed" off you in anyway, so that should be some points at least, then for Altruism probably you deserve nothing. That still should be enough for a pip minimum.
---
I haven’t seen anyone say “Did the devs not test him?” or anything in he lines of that, most people are just saying he is weak and needs a buff ?
---
Right. I think a good solution would be to make some difficult to master killers. Starting out, the beginner killer would be on the same level as beginner survivors. With a really powerful killer on their hands, but wit no skills yet to use them properly. Like Nurse or Spirit. Give those to a new player, and they will probably not do very well. Then, by the time they develop those skills, they will have moved up the ranks and will no longer be facing beginners. That's my take on it.
---
Oh shit, I didn't even think of him.
---
[Here](https://i.imgur.com/MtMzw24.png) is his PTB look, but I'm not on live right now so I can't compare. It probably did change too.
---
Should not have clicked
---
This 100%. Survivors can craft a 4 perk build that removes any chance of killer success but no matter what perks killers use, all of them can be countered. Throughout the entire history of this game, survivors have always had the upper hand. Exhaustion perks used to not have exhaustion and recovered while you run. Infinite loops and double pallets existed and some still do. (Ironworks of Misery window, we all know the one) Killers were having such a hard time winning on release that bloodlust had to be added. Survivors have been, are, and probably will always be the oppressors in any scenario that doesn't involve killer cheats or exploits.
---
never thought id see DR on this sub lmao
---
Favorite killer.
---
Holy shit thats beautiful
---
I genuinely can't understand why you would want to reward the most boring and repetitive aspect of the game lol.  Chases are pretty much the only reason the game is interesting I don't get how holding M1, Crouching &amp; leaving is entertaining
---
Lmao product placement 😂
---
What I say isn’t really what I mean and being salty about me saying something not in the way I think of it in my head isn’t a valid argument. Also they’re going to change him god. He’s not finished and they literally only released him so the public could test him out and tweak him if necessary. It’s literally the whole point of the player test build.
---
you’re*
---
Myers is really pretty meh, just pig IMO
---
Rise up my fellow Jeffs!
---
How do you figure? You just get within range and hold chainsaw. Once you know the timings etc you know how far a survivor can get before you chainsaw them and for the most part when pallets are getting exhausted, unless they happen to be by a window there's no reason you can't chainsaw them instead of hit. Only hit if you know they can make it to a window/pallet.
---
It's the same as any killer really, you just gotta know when to use the ability. The problem I see when playing survivor is that most of the time the leatherface picks terrible spots to chainsaw, or they rev too early, or they somehow don't know how to maneuver around objects.
---
How does this not have 1k upvotes lmao
---
Wow... no one can ever be grateful can they
---
Well sadly the closest thing you're gonna get is Dwight cosplaying as Ellis
---
Having an alert on a *stealth based* Killer was a bad idea to begin with.
---
I was actually unsure if discord was allowed or not but this cleared my doubts. Thank you mate!
---
I'm pretty sure it's only the description that's broken.
---
...Maybe.
---
I would be fine if it weren't for the obvious channel pitch.
---
Man if only they knew how stressful it is to be killer in hi ranks. I've been through so many Teabags, I ain't even mad about it...
---
The gas traps/bomb remind me of Caustic from Apex Legends in a way! Solid concept!
---
this is so sad
---
Jeff mains Rise up!
---
If DbD is Yandere simulator.
---
He's not used very much. Little usage = few kills on record.
---
Maybe, but dbd isn't a work of parody or satire, so it might come closer to violating IP law if they make the killer too similar to what was portrayed in the movie. I agree that it'd be fun to play with the real GF and Sydney one day.
---
And if we didn't complain and say what is wrong with him, then the devs would go " Hey he's fine, lets ship him how he is."
---
And I cant read your mind. If you want to convey what you mean on a text based forum, you have to communicate it through what you write. You failed to communicate what you meant, and because people aren't psychic, they can only infer what you mean by the text you posted. 
---
I'm not salty, but you cannot claim "i didnt mean 'X'" when you literally write "X". You need to be clear and concise on the internet otherwise people can and will either misinterpret what you write, or more often take it at face value.
---
You barely can get exposed with the way he is now.
---
Jake be out there sabotaging his dick
---
I’m on ps4 as well. I posted at the time of the issue, which was a few hours ago now, but if I run into it again I’ll see if I can record it.
---
If you want to ignore the fact the game is clearly built around survival vs killing, here's the literal gameplay description from the official page: "In Dead by Daylight, you play as either a Survivor or a Killer. The Survivors aim is to escape the level, and the Killer’s goal is to stop them."
---
The aim is to escape. If survivors escape fast and the killer can't stop them, too bad. The survivors succeeded and the killer failed, simple as that.
---
so are we just all of a sudden gonna pretend post like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bxafq7/on_ghost_face_ptb_and_what_will_probably_happen/) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bx9sf5/list_of_changes_that_need_to_be_made_to_ghostface/) don't exist
---
I made it worse by pointing out the fact that killer mains can be just as toxic and hypothetical as survivors mains? Or was it me snapping back at the guy who came at me first with the disrespect? 
---
Well either way, nice job at "helping out" buddy ^_^
---
Red ranks play with loads of potatoes, the matchmaking sucks, are we playing the same game?
---
Noob3 is rank 1 and he gets plenty of locker babies.
---
Probably because most people haven't used it successfully.
---
Crotus Prenn has 2 or 3 totem locations that I know of that are just out in the open. No tall grass or rocks in the way. Just sitting there.
---
They massacred Claud’s hair
---
Hey.. sometimes it's a long chase and I cover a large part of the map trying not to use too many pallets in one place.
---
Been there since the beta. Doubt they're gonna fix it until the update drops since it isnt really that big
---
To be fair, I don't even think he'll be that good even if his power worked as intended. He needs to stalk unseen for 4 seconds straight, if a survivor looks at him with their 3rd person camera for 1 second only, it breaks him out of it, which will be eazy peazy lemon lingueezy.
---
If anything, the survivor should maybe have to make their character look directly in Ghostie's direction for a second or two, or just have their camera look at him for 2 and a half seconds because instant or 1 second look time isn't that big of a difference.
---
What happened?
---
No thank you.
---
Most people here just post a clip or gif with no channel info, though.
---
Least seen consisists of licensed survivors without cosmetics and Jeff
---
Poor Jeff
---
Fucking David looking like he just got the ray gun from the mystery box
---
Oh, doing it again. Your first paragraph sounds reasonable, not unlike the first paragraph in your response to the other guy. But your second paragraph like your second paragraph to the other guy, is full of your shitty attitude. Watch.
---
"So sorry you couldn't see your own assholery but anyone with measurable people skills can tell pretty quickly so sorry but thanks for nothing dickhead😁😁😁😁😁."

Not hard to tell that anyone who writes like that is trying to be a dickless cunt but ok. Way to attack me for pointing that out. And you're welcome for" helping out" inbred cuck.
---
Cant give gold so here's a silver.
---
Lol. Ok. I guess all Killers should be S tier right out the gate so no player ever has to have sad feels. If you like a weak Killer, play them, have fun. You're not entitled to a 4k. This is a game, and different Killers will be different strengths. I play Wraith because he's fun despite his weakness. But I don't come here to cry about it on Reddit and pretend Survivors are the ones acting like victims in the same breath.

When ghostface finally came out
---
You shouldn't release a broken product in the first place and that the PTB shouldn't be the only place where stuff gets tested properly. You're missing the point of Zombie's comment.
---
You're welcome! I hope they go on sale for you!
---
I mean it's a test OF THE NEW KILLER.  
---
  
---
That means he has to AT LEAST be functional to test it.  
---
Imagine if NASA announced a new rocket test live, and then just dumped a bunch of unfinished and broken parts on the floor...
---
I really like your points as well. I think that should pretty well balance him.
---
&gt; What his power besides invisibility?
---
He moves ~126% movement speed while cloaked.
---
I'd say if he was OP it'd be better because it's easier to nerf than completely change a useless ability to actually make it viable.
---
You mean Ruby? She’s just one of the Dark Ones. And she’s the least evil out of all of them.
---
TO THE SWF TEAM THAT WERE BULLYING THE SHIT OUT OF ME AND MY POOR LEVEL 17 SPIRT ON SUNDAY NIGHT, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I ONLY PARTIALLY RAGE QUIT MID WAY THROUGH THE MATCH. THE OTHER PART WAS I WAS DOING A "CHASE FOR 180 SECONDS" DAILY TASK AND YOUR TROLLING ASSES MADE THAT PRETTY EASY TO COMPLETE. CHASE FOR THE EASY, IF NOT A LITTLE TRAUMATIC, 45,000 BP LOSERS.
---
I'm not saying killers should be S tier or get 4Ks. I'm responding to the fact that YOU said there should be weak killers. 
---
Weak killers in this game CANNOT get 4Ks without playing cruely or being subject to survivor taunts because they aren't taken seriously. This takes away from the cool asthetic that people look for playing a scary killer. And you don't seem to think that it's reasonable to ask that all killers be usable at any given time. Not broken or OP. USABLE.
---
He means to jump off the hook in general. He didn’t know he had a 100% chance of doing it.
---
little baby surv main so salt cause he cannot rely on his crutch second chance perk anymore awwwh little baby gonna cry cause devs took his op perk ? poor little baby surv
---
Correct, he will immediately get kicked out of his power and have it completely drained if he is ever even slightly in vision of any survivor for even the shortest period of time, including downed and hooked survivors. This makes it difficult to even activate your power in any scenario where you might want to use it, as the only thing the activation button does is to instantly deplete your power meter.
---
Huh. I never knew that. Could be that Wes Craven wanted to co-opt the boogeyman concept in Scream, although he had already done that with the Nightmare on Elm Street series.
---
Would actually make him more fun to play as since survivors can have a better chance of getting away from him and bill mains will have to think about when they use it
---
Oh, okay. Then yes, i just started paying attention to reddit. Its crazy lol.
---
Aside from the perks, not much. Maybe with all of the criticism, we'll get lucky and another PTB will be held next week lmao We can always dream I guess.
---
Wonder what other Ebony Add Ons could be made
---
I like it. The mouth is very well done and creepy.
---
Too late.
---
Di Molto!
---
Can't use it again for another couple of minutes
---
Shirtless &gt; Open Shirt
---
I mean I made a post saying how since it's a test and it's not possible to have enough experience to call ghostface trash and he's just buggy but instead I got 53 comments telling me I'm an idiot and he's bad :/
---
To me it feels like it's most of the sub
---
How the fuck did you get 8k in the deviousness category and chase category with Myers?? 
---
Scratched mirror?
---
AT LEAST PLAGUE IS FUN TO PLAY, EVEN IF NOT THE BEST KILLER. GHOSTFACE DOESN'T EVEN LOOK FUN, FFS.
---
yep! lmao
---
I read a post somewhere on Reddit that had my favorite nerf idea for Billy. 
---
It was: Billy doesn’t need a nerf.
---
Yeah, the Unicorn Block is the only addon that is different.
---
He may own the character, but he might have given someone else the rights to use the character in media (movies, video games, etc.). We just don't what kind of contract surrounds the character has unless he speaks about it.
---
No David's definitely a bottom, it's always the butch ones, believe me.
---
i mean i could honestly care less about what someone has to say about me online on REDDIT. LOLOLOLOL
---
The only survivor perk that trump Killers' stealth abillities is Kindred
---
Figured the lower rank Add Ons would also be altered so they also boost the fuel he has and how quickly it depletes.
---
It's not rare at all in other games. Just here it's more of a mob mentality as it's between two sets of mains as opposed to for/against specific classes/characters.
---
Basically all killers are lumped together and survivors are all together. Then to make their points each side cherrypicks one character and applies it to their entire side.
---
I tried man :( But people just find the memes more entertaining I guess.
---
&gt;Some people would like to play against someone other than Hillbilly and Nurse every once in a blue moon.  That isn't a "viable" killer using op add-ons to be viable.
---
Very unlikely to change anytime soon at higher ranks.
---
GHOSTFACE IS SO BAD I THINK WE NEED A NEW TIER LOWER THAN F TIER. GETTING TAKEN OUT OF STALK BY HOOKED AND DOWNED SURVIVORS IS JUST REDICULOUS. WHY CANT I STALK THROUGH ONE ROW OF CORN BUT THEY CAN SPOT ME THROUGH FIVE?!?!??!?
---
It really needs a rework
---
Not mine d:
---
Only 110 movement speed, wayyy faster than pig

---
Wrong information again, when the perk released we had this debacle and it was proven wrong. It's 25% total progression.
---
Honestly dude, it’s a good idea to just take a step back. If you’re really this stressed over the game, it’s just in your best interest to stop playing. These devs aren’t good and they’ll never get better at this rate. You’re getting stressed over a lost cause. Put this energy towards something that’s better for you. The playerbase isn’t gonna stop being complacent and the devs won’t get better so quit before you give yourself a stroke.
---
I don’t agree, I very rarely see people say that. Ultimately, a balanced game means that 2 die and 2 survive, most people I see recognize that
---
Tinfoil Hat Time: I secretly think they do it so that the backlash exhausts itself before they start charging money; especially since they can claim to be hearing our feedback and promise to fix it later.  This sub most likely will not remain this level of angry for a full 2 weeks.
---
I upvoted your post anyway ¯\\_(o_o)_/¯
---
You say forgot Ghost Face I’m gonna have to go sicko mode on you just do me a favor and don’t look at me I don’t want my ability to be taken away
---
PEOPLE KEEP SAYING GHOSTFACE WILL SUCK BECAUSE LOOKING AT HIM WILL IMMEDIATELY CANCEL HIS POWER EVEN THOUGH YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO HAVE THE SURVIVORS LOOK AT HIM WITH THEIR HEADS FACING HIS DIRECTION AND SIMPLY USING THE CAMERA WON'T CANCEL IT
---
Well it's a meme template now
---
Still playing Ghost Face though playing one doesn’t make it so I’m not able to play the other I’m just waiting till they fix him
---
Same I feel like I can't live without the New DS
---
At least they aren't on deaths door
---
EXACTLY LOL. Everyone is in pain and he’s just mildly inconvenienced by it lol
---
I didn't say there should be weak Killers. I said that it's natural to have a level of stratification in quality of Killers. Someone has to be at the bottom.
---
I honestly don't think any Killer is nonviable. The fundamentals of Killer gameplay are plenty to earn you a good match, even with the worst Killers. 
---
As for 'cool aesthetics' and the 'scary killer' thing, that's just not something I think is important, personally. I definitely understand the appeal, but BHVR has made it clear that it isn't the kind of game they're going for. Being cool or intimidating isn't a part of the gameplay. I don't think that's going to change and I don't think it's an argument to be made when it comes to Killer design. That said, I'd love to see a similar style game with more of a scare factor. DBD just ain't it.

Do you even know what's going on? Or did you read one sentence and decide to comment?
---
Hex: So Sassy
---
Haha thank you. I am certain a lot of people consider it ironic that I have a criticism of Ghostface post to go along with my front page "this sub right now" meme post. A lot of people think I am defending BHVR's incompetence or "riding their nutsuck" to quote a few, but I just thought it would be funny to make the meme.
---
yea, my guess is they're playing/versing Legions who only tunnel 1 guy even with the ability which is extremely ineffective.
---
Though at least I can agree on 1 thing in that Legion DOES still need buffs, but they aren't far off from being a decent killer.
---
So true my friend
---
I run this perk whenever people say Billy needs a nerf. One of my favorite flex perks.
---
Original Footage 1984 colorized.
---
Well with new killers and perks like these.... yes.  I would agree.
---
But the question asked was:
---
&gt; Why would survivor mains care enough to shitpost on Reddit about a new weak killer?
---
and that was what I responded to lol.
---
No, it's not ALL that is going to keep happening, there are many cool people in the community. But it will keep happening, unfortunately.
---
Did you reply to the wrong post? Happens sometimes.
---
**COUGH COUGH**
---
Dead Rabbit
---
**COUGH COUGH** 
---
M&amp;A
---
Every Myers has M&amp;A
---
I think they want everyone to get these two as they are matching outfits.
---
Get a tattoo of it
---
Git gud, basically.
---
THIS IS A SHITPOST STOP BEING SO TRIGGERED U TROGLODYTE! FUCK!
---
He’s just out here trying to have a good time and people are throwing stuff on him
---
I know, right?
---
Who is the best?
---
How else would Billy's chainsaw function wouldn't it need gas to power it?
---
Then again the same could be said for Bubba.
---
because you can hear it if you listen carefully, its there to make it harder if you are stressed or in a chase
---
Freddy at least can slow down survivors and if his power is used correctly, he can apply decent map pressure. Ghost Face has no power at all if survivors have a brain. The 7 second transition is not enough to make him worse than Ghost Face. That's literally the only negative thing Freddy has going for him. He hardly has any positives, sure, but that one negative doesn't make him worse than Myers stuck in tier 2 with no addons to help him out, except occasionally being able to go back to tier 1 until someone rotates their screen slightly.
---
I would have preferred Shirtless Myers or David, but to each his own x)
---
To good of a buff. It would be a guaranteed down if the nearest pallet was already used. Only thing that would counter him would be windows
---
Omfg and I just started leveling Dwight specifically for bond -.-
---
What I'm saying is that I'm not going to let devs who are, at best, rank 13, convince me - a consistant red rank player of who are OBVIOUSLY the best killers in the game. That being Nurse, Billy, and Spirit. If I or anyone came on here and made a thread saying that the Plague is a high rank killer we'd be laughed off the forum and rightfully so. Just because a dev says it doesn't mean it's any less laughable.
---
Players know who the best killers are. We always have known who the best killers are.
---
I do break the totems. Do my teamates? Not always. Plus it is almost impossible to find the totems in certain maps. And breaking the totems is almost impossible if the killer is on you the whole match. Too easy
---
It’s a necessary perk because it counters adrenaline
---
What character and build ?
---
You need to wait 7 seconds to get hit so run to the nearest loop and  Dont bring him near teammates. If he has fast sleep add ons then just try to get somewhere moderately safe. I just recommend looping his ass while your teammates do stuff also bring self care if you have to maybe get a skill check so he has to waste more time putting you to sleep.
---
Doesn’t PS4 not have Bill either.
---
Wait Bubba has cosmetics?
---
Did. Y'all. Learn. Nothing. From. The. Legion. PTB?
---
I hate when people block the hook.
---
Hes Not i guess really. He shouldnt be able to use bbq and chilli
---
Because he gets looped easily, it’s easy to break out of dream world, the delay before hitting people, has no map pressure, and most can’t see very far in front of him with the mist.
---
And do you have those numbers? If a dev says she’s top tier it’s because they have the numbers to back it up, I’d trust them to know their game more than some random players on reddit.
---
The second they woke up that morning and pondered playing the PTB
---
Because some people like the game and want to play against fun killers. Also the chance to insult the devs usually peaks everyone's interests.
---
Seems like you’re the one being triggered with the full capitalized sentence and the usage of the word fuck while calling me an insult. Ouch.
---
Yeah and just because it’s a Shitpost doesn’t mean people can’t have opinions and don’t have to agree with you.
---
Fam, I learned it all back from the Haddonfield Hooks PTB
---
&gt; at least they aren't Overkill/Starbreeze.
---
OVK actually pulled off and saved Payday 2 though, I'd put BHVR closer to the For Honor devs.
---
I disagree however I do see the logic behind that. If anything I'd say full stack devour hope is perfect for adrenaline.
---
Should have drawn that smug smile of her’s
---
Feng has more than enough cosmetics. Give Kate the bunny suit 😤
---
I disagree however I see the logic behind that. I'd say full stack devour hope would be better for the job though.
---
Yeah because nurse takes absolutely no work, map knowledge, muscle memory, or prediction. Keep telling yourself that, buddy. Nobody wants another fucking nurse. What we want is a killer that isn't babytown easy to counter you twit.
---
Nurse then Spirit then Billy.
---
The sad thing about the whole "not cleansing" tactic is that it doesn't make the Plague bad, it just makes her boring.
---
Really it should speed up his stalking. Also, survivors shouldn't get a red circle indicator. Like wtf?
---
Zoinks they found me out scoobs
---
Any hint of swf scares lots of killers away
---
sorry :-(
---
And after this clip (the fifth one today by the way) I can safely assume you’re low rank with the intention of picking on new players.
---
Pretty much.
---
I thought Corrupt Purge was so strong you only needed it once to get a 4k?
---
Nah. Your build is the best build he has.
---
It is a bit boring but it also isn’t particularly weak. Plus infected survivors are about twice as noisy as a normal injured survivors so you’re easier to find. Even Iron Will doesn’t stop the vomiting
---
&gt; People can peek around corners using the third person camera and spot you without being visible to the killer
---
I find it ironic that the survivors can peak better then the killer, who's whole shtick is being able to peek.
---
Imo OP is perfect for countering flashlights without running a griefing perk. Sure, they can still use is, but half as much. Just make get them to do it at a few pallets and you won't see a flashlight save
---
Good luck convincing every rabid person on this thread here that he is not trash and that killers in general aren't as powerless as people claim.
---
Get	bullied, get suicidal, get aids, get terminally ill, get dead parents, get murdered, get a dead child.
---
Ye this community is kinda sad sometimes.
---
If you did that I'd happily fuck off for like 10 seconds.
---
Why the hell is Trapper wearing a rainbow overalls?
---
Imagine if trapper could though? And if you got hit it still held you in place
---
Have any Devs commented on Ghost Face yet?
---
THAT'S AN EASY **SS** TIER  👌💯
---
I don't care about your justification or borderline ad hominem attack. The fact is that a killer's job is to stop the survivors from escaping the match, and the survivor's job is to escape the match.
---
I shouldn't be punished if a killer is bad and can't catch anyone. Just because I didn't get those unhook points, that's not my problem. It's a fundamental problem with the game's design. Deal with it.
---
Sound like Cannibal Corpse my man hell yeah!
---
Why the fuck did he M1? XD
---
What character do you think it was
---
Just to make sure, the hatch was open, right?
---
Easy counter. Don't tunnel 🙃
---
This is weirdly specific and weirdly accurate.
---
Never said that.
---
It's technically true, but the same can be said for Myers and Leatherface.
---
If that happens, they played like shit and deserved to lose.
---
LGBT Pride Month right now.
---
At what rarity.
---
I don't even own Feng but if their above Tier 20 I'm not buying the pass, since we all need bunny feng.
---
Those blue eyes in the distance were pretty sick
---
Used to be red rank, it was bing bong boi who actually carried me there. Can I still throw in my two cents?
---
Yes, Peanits commented that he is bugged currently and his power is only meant to deactivate when the survivor's head is facing him, not just the camera.
---
I don't get this. They ARE nerfing MOM right?
---
Damn i wish my killer could get Adrenaline
---
where were you two PTBs ago
---
Nice catch, but I would rather have something more like a box like evil within 3, that runs down... maybe looking straight at Ghostface for 3 seconds instead of 1, but welp... we gotta wait for the fix first, before we know if he needs a buff after the fix.
---
Yeah maybe swap bbq with bamboozle and you have a solid chase build.
---
I would play Quentin more if he had cosmetics, damn you limited licensing curse!
---
Use Franklin lol it's better
---
no idea i was clearly in front of her the whole time
---
as long as it was fairly recent, so the info is still relevant
---
Idk didnt think abt that lol but maybe yellow/green/purple for slightly/moderately/drastically im not good with raritys
---
Magical entity fuel. Next you’ll ask how does nurse teleport or where does doctor get power for his electricity or what technology the wraith uses to go invisible
---
Tapp is the only character I've bothered going for prestige 3 on. If I wasn't burnt out for the past couple of months I'd have been switching to him as my main survivor by now, instead I'm still maining Claudette.
---
I can sort of see their point somewhat, the terror radius one would be good if it worked outside of chases too imo. Cause in a chase you're red stain will still be there even with 0 terror radius right?
---
I'm gonna need more than that to consider Spine Chill in my next build. Spine Chill always seemed like a really situational perk to me. You only get the action boost if the killer is looking in your direction but how much cumulative time does a killer do that (when you're not in a chase)?
---
Unfortunately
---
Well on PS4 this would probably be considered lag switching. Which is a very bannable offense. Sony takes lag switching very seriously
---
1. Why did you just stop unhooking the first time?
---
2. Why did you DH before unhooking the second time? You could've saved, used it and the killer would just hit the survivor with BT protection.
---
3. "NOED abusing camper"?
---
Eh. I'd put her on a similar tier to Myers. They both have good tools to shorten chases via instadowns. Myers has more stealth, while plague has gen-delay and a bit of detection via needing to use the fountains. And the ranged utility.
---
He could just report the message to PlayStation directly
---
billy would be pure hot garbage with 110% movement speed. he wouldn’t be able to do anything in loops.
---
Nurses, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury with any speed while cloaked add-on and either the bone clapper or ghost soot is my favorite setup
---
&gt;You can loop the killer while being exposed and yet Myers' power isn't "useless". You can loop the killer who's revving a chainsaw behind you and Billy's power isn't "useless"
---
I was replying to this if I remember.
---
The hand is probably mom and the face is DS
---
Then dont punish the killer for using mori on first hook on all survivors since the goal is to kill
---
THE SECRET IS TO NOT GET EXCITED ABOUT ANYTHING BHVR DO, THEN YOU CAN'T BE DISAPPOINTED ONLY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED IF IT DOES GO WELL (WHICH IT WON'T)
---
I made this for the subreddit but here's the original https://youtu.be/WH-VGs4NVwU
---
To be fair, I don't think she had a choice. She couldn't wait out DS because hatch was too close. Either way, Jane was going to get Hatch.
---
F
---
No idea. The killer had super bad ping and I was hiding in a locker. I exited the locker and started walking and then the game lagged and I ended up back in the locker in 3rd person view, stuck.
---
OK
---
It certainly is an amazing level of incompetency. If there was testing, I am guess it was exceptionally poorly done. The whole "test this use case, verify A or B" type of deal, which really isn't all that great.
---
Literally no idea, the game lagged as I had just left a locker and I ended up back inside but in 3rd person and stuck.
---
What's the point of spine chill at that point
---
Already provided feedback [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bx9sf5/list_of_changes_that_need_to_be_made_to_ghostface/) that detection and aura reading perks shouldn't work against him during his stealth mode.
---
I forgot Laurie existed on console for a while recently, I just saw her a few days ago and completely realized it wasn’t Kate lmao
---
Yes, you can.
---
Yeah no shit bud we know, like 8 people already posted this.
---
Just a normal spot to run a killer? And why are you promoting your own stream lol
---
Ah, but that’s not what you said. You said “This was already announced” like I didn’t know Freddy was getting a rework. You did not say that other people posted this.
---
She could have closed it before picking up Jane?
---
Correct, Doctor is based on a real life piece of shit.
---
We need Jasmine Masters as  a survivor
---
Spine chill is actually a really good perk, it allows you to pressure and work on gens safely, when you're working on a gen and you hear the terror radius you no longer have to guess if the killer is coming for you or not, I've gotten entire gens done within the killers terror radius safely because I knew he wasn't coming for me because of spine chill
---
Somewhat understandable as there is usually a bigger wait for killers than survivors. You need 4x as many survivors than killers. 
---
Note: I said understandable, not happy about it
---
The boost isn’t why most people run Spine Chill (although it’s great if you’re the last one and have to open a gate). I RARELY run it but when I use it I use it in chases. Like someone said above, it’s amazing against a Spirit. Not just prayer bead Spirit but Spine Chill completely negates her mind games. If you get used to using it it can help with loops and losing a killer in a chase.
---
Also getting some preparation that a killer is coming your way can be good so you can get to a loop early. I don’t play stealthy and think Spine Chill is underestimated.
---
Omfg it's just a dame clip
---
😂😂😂
---
You realise it's getting nerfed, right?
---
It is already confirmed from [early alpha playthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2d91TliOys) that the above are old Meg and Claudette.
---
Buddy, pal. What the fuck are you on that your this delusional. Your trying to win a lost argument with petty comebacks that make literally no sense, your single downvoting my comments, which is cringe itself, and your profile is legit just complaining about the game and shitty art.
---
It's fucking gone happy ass hole
---
It was just a random photo i had to use for show. Wasn’t posted for an example.
---
yay for bad karma!!!!!!! REDDIT MEANS THE WORLD TO MEEEEEE
---
Yeah, the escape was cool, but Linkin Park and Jay-Z makes this infinitely better.
---
Right haha. That's what she should have done. To be honest, I have no idea why she didn't expect DS at that point.
---
I'm not sure why everyone is making such a fuss about this. Ya the killer is not that great rn but that's why it is on the ptb.
---
Mister X shouldn't be in dbd unless he has the ability to make pallets explode on him on impact, mister x wouldn't be stopped by no damn pallet
---
I play on PC. Good to know Tapps exist on console though.
---
The problem isn't really that he is bad, it's that his power is so bugged it's hard to tell how good his power would actually be if it worked the way the devs intended, so it's kind of hard to make an informed decision on what to do balance-wise.
---
I was looking for something like this. The bugs are taking a front seat to the PTB when I thought it was supposed to be about the viability of the killer's power (which is hard to test due to the bugs). I still hope the testers get some time with fixed-Ghostface, but my optimism is boosted a little now, thanks lol
---
Literally, just what you have. It's the best build for all M1 killers.
---
Ok. Have a good night/day.
---
Because premonition and spine chill weren’t shit enough, you’re going to take away their one situational use.
---
Countering stealth is kinda their whole point
---
Dude, it’s frustrating but hilarious when you are trying to stalk someone, then you get seen, only to turn around and see that person in a corner right behind you. 
---
I’m really curious how people are going to play him. Seems to be really good at camping, but that was the only way I could really get his power to work.
---
good idea, while i'm at it i can use it to take hits for my other uninjured teammates
---
I think everyone’s mad because how could you release a killer this bad?? Did they even test it at all?? I think constructive criticism is needed and helpful not bitching about it I’ll agree with that, but come on now how can you release something this terrible??
---
I like the fixed hatch standoff aspect of EGC. What I don't like is the Remember Me, Blood Warden and Pig nerfs. Plus the timer is just WAY too long imo.
---
Probably a baby killer that doesn't know how bodyblocking works yet.
---
and these are the old mories too
---
Well don't be like this hag and just immediately smack the survivor trying to block.
---
I mean it’s worth trying but if you prefer to keep the killer busy you might prefer a different perk. I’d say Spine Chill is for the type of survivor that’s semi decent in chases but doesn’t get chased unless they get caught, so it’s good having the pre warning etc. It’s also a good perk against Myers/pig/wraith.
---
But yea I usually main Spirit and the ones who run Spine Chill or Iron Will are the worst to go against! So it’s also from a killer perspective that I think it’s decent. 
---
Any way good luck have fun :)
---
madness can drive you to do crazy things
---
A good fix would be if sick long enough you get put into the dying state, but it takes 2x-3x as long to get to. Would fix the problem with people not cleansing
---
Do other licensed killers have cosmetics?
---
triple
---
I’m almost certain that she wrote the book with the others but then fucked em over. Or do I need another rewatch?
---
I had 3 people playing ghost face tell me to stop using spine chill because it "ruined their fun". Honestly just put any perk that lets you know where the killer is/is looking and you counter ghost face
---
Ya this hurt to watch wish all my killers where like this lol
---
Awesome. Love the animations and the tattoo artist did an amazing job
---
I was hoping someone would say SOMA. I mainly just want Simon as a survivor though.
---
&lt;3
---
Missing one?
---
I enjoyed the video but I'm not going to unmute because I know for a fact the editing will be cringeworthy and unbearable
---
He's so desperate to grab you lmao. "Ugh! Come here you bitch!"
---
That kid they wish came out different
---
Really talented. I love how adorable the Spirit is
---
Fair enough, I’ve never run a full endgame build, nor have I played against one yet 
---
Honestly, I understand why they nerfed the pig, however at the same time if you’re caught at the end, without body blocking you’ll be screwed either way
---
I’m being serious. Both of us were being assholes for no reason, hope we can come to a truce
---
Dude PLEASE just respond to ONE comment, and stop deleting stuff
---
why do you own that im calling the police
---
Borrowed time?
---
I THINK PEOPLE ARE BEING OVERDRAMATIC ABOUT HOW BAD GHOST FACE IS, BUT I SUPPORT THEIR RAGE BECAUSE IT WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO A BETTER KILLER. HOWEVER, I'M SO FUCKING TIRED OF GETTING [TEABAGGED](/INTENSIFIES) IT'S NOT FUCKING CUTE.
---
Zubatlel is a great choice for learning. Very clean killer gameplay. 
---
Tru3 is alright. You have to take a lot of what he says with a grain of salt. His arrogance will often prevent him from critically self-evaluating his mistakes and he'll put out misinformation because of it.
---
It may have been by downing someone after you’ve hit them with borrowed time, then again it doesn’t make sense because it clearly says “with the legion”.
---
He can also reporting you for cursing btw
---
It would be so funny if ghost face could hide in lockers and trigger his ability.
---
These end game hexes are fine if we get a hex counter. It’s really unfun running around trying to find hexes when they’ve already been destroyed.
---
If you tried to play as nurse you'd see. Connecting the with blink and slash is difficult asf
---
If I get hooked and I can see that the last survivor is hiding in a locker, you better believe I am not giving them the hatch. I will stay on that hook as long as possible.
---
You need to put the low amp thing behind the battery or else the low amp will only effect the base flashlight and won’t effect the duration of the battery :)
---
They hate us 'cause they ~~anus~~ ain't us.
---
Did use a shard to make you play as legion?
---
These are good changes. Here are some of my ideas
---
1. I think I'm all ears should activate with ANY notification survivor makes, including perk notification's like thrill of the hunt, and yes, even unhooking (only the unhooker gets shown obviously, and hey, killers no longer will accidentally tunnel)
---
2. Keep the original design of thrilling tremors except only give it a 16 second cooldown, and begin regression of any gen that's been blocked.
---
3. For furtive chase. Keep it a token perk with a max of 4 tokens and 1 token decreases 4 meters from your terror radius, BUT it's a flat decrease, it doesn't only activate in a chase, and get rid of the condition that when the obsession dies you basically lose your perk, that's incredibly silly, a token perk you have to work a good chunk of the game to get, but if you remove it later that just means it's only actually used a very small portion of the game.
---
As a solo I'm going to say that the bottom has way way too much humanity
---
You are triggering my PTSD
---
Why you bully that poor bb like that
---
MORE OF QUESTION THAN RAGE BUT FUCK YOU IM NOT WAITING FOR THE QUESTION THREAD
---
WHY DO PEOPLE ACT LIKE HOPPING OFF THE GEN AFTER MISSING THE PERFECT RUIN SKILLCHECK IS THE “CORRECT” THING TO DO? ARENT YOU JUST WAITING THE 4% REGRESSION TIME EITHER WAY? I GUESS I COULD UNDERSTAND IF YOU HAVE A TOOLBOX TO SAVE CHARGES BUT I SEE YOUTUBERS DOING IT WITHOUT TOOLBOXES
---
Did he have Insidious?
---
She's terrible on console, I'm fully convinced the devs did NOT playtest her for console
---
Wutdafaq did I watch? I mean, after the 50th time you'd think I'd get it but no. I really really really like this video
---
And this is exactly why I say the last survivor should still have the ability to attempt escape.
---
Nope but I heard piggy is getting some! And that ghostface will also have his own upon releaas
---
The 3rd one is too much like Ash's perk, "Buckle up".
---
Poor ghostface just can't seem to get away :(. Quit bullying him claudette
---
Why do people try to fix what ain't broken?
---
Yea I never see Tapp or Quentin
---
He's not going to, lmao? But he wants to, and he needs the devs to fix it before he does
---
I never play Killers and I don't see a problem. It's a strat I'd use. Just because your teammate got baited doesn't mean it's some unfair tactic. Or perhaps I'm reading this wrong?
---
This is nice to hear! Sometimes the pace of the game can be really frustrating on both sides, i.e. the killer wipes the whole team in minutes, or the survivors fix all 5 gens and get the quad escape with no hooks. I'd say both suck just as equally because no one likes to get their asses handed to them like that, but it happens and it's whatever.  
---
I will say that as a survivor, I LOVE a well-paced game. Survivors each getting two well spaced out hooks, almost all/all gens done, maybe one person escapes or maybe none of us get out, but when the pacing is nice and I have time to get BPs, I'm not tunneled or camped... I always try to say gg in those situations. Always. There's just something nice about being able to play a match to the full extent, and to enjoy a non toxic game without all that extra shit during or after.
---
There’s a few good Nurses on console. She’s a lot harder to play but at the end of the day she’s the exact same Killer as PC
---
Yeah... the new MoM scares me, i wanted them to nerf the actual ability, not the stupid requirements for it. And they actually BUFFED, the ability, mom used to be counterable with instadowning, but not anymore
---
Good thing I just bought 2k cells
---
I mean they released a fat chick with a skinny chick who pukes on you as a power.. Bulimia anyone?
---
&gt;Shit, now *I'm* curious. My phone doesn't show one was removed in that spot (just goes from David to Myers), but it is possible I did upload the wrong photo and quickly replaced it with the correct one in the past as I did that a few times
---
Yeah, it has the imgur placeholder of, "the image you are requesting does not exist or is no longer available"
---
Yeah me too but I still want the rework
---
No Mither and Self Care?
---
This is a joke, right?
---
Them timing these outfits/pairing to come out precisely on Pride month is pretty suggestive to say the least.
---
Wait.. What? The hatch might be closed? Like.. Permanently?
---
I remember when plague came out and I was disappointed how the effects of sickness was basically just nothing, literally nothing, it was just a different healing system, I was so excited, I thought there would be all these cool addons that gave the sickness all these different effects and... nope
---
I agree, I feel like his base kit is alright, his add-ons just need to help him more.
---
that's spot on holy shit
---
So you're saying I'm never gonna see them.
---
IF YOU DINT HAVE RUIN, TWO GENS ARE POPPED BY THE TIME TRAPS ARE SET, EVEN MORE IF YOU DINT BRING A TRAPPER BAG ADDON. HAVING TO WALK TO EVERY ONE, ONE BY ONE IS ENOUGH TO GET THAT MUCH GEN PRESSURE GONE
---
Its like they just come up with ideas and don't put them in practice. They just toss it at us and make us deal with it. It's just frustrating.
---
best tits ever
---
I bet it is; I usually scream "Where'd you come from?" as survivor, not killer. I'm interested to go against him in a working state. He encourages the player to actually go in sneaky, where Myers can just run in, maybe nab a gen grab or hit, and stalk as the survivors flee. Of course, Ghostface could do that too, but with less ability to stalk.
---
Okay after seeing the meg mask so many times, am i the only one that thinks it looks like something straight out of Absolver?
---
How about his chainsaw become the only thing that can cut down corns.
---
Yeah, but its actually not. Its just as bad and just as annoying to deal with. There is officially no counterplay to it. It has no downside to use. Survivors literally just have to play the game for it to proc. Especially at high levels. It's just a mess rn and it sucks that perks like this are not carefully considered.
---
Paid characters should never get a rework? That's not possible without going great lengths to balance around paid characters. In any game.
---
No
---
He did this multiple times
---
After they release it...why not fix it then release it....
---
I'm glad someone could enjoy the long post. And I think what you've said is very accurate. When it's a wipe, it absolutely sucks vs games with potential. Maybe what made them be positive was when I had the option to absolutely tunnel and play scummy and refused to. I remember finding someone who just got unhooked, shaking my head no at them and went to try to find someone else.
---
Devil's advocate says, if it were playing any other killer, especially m1 killers, you would have played differently. Maybe! But I want to do my best to just have fun.
---
Would buy in an instant
---
Legion was a highschool dropout
---
The fact that so many people seek and often DEMAND personal validation or encouragement from total strangers for their actions is troubling.
---
Would’ve given the guy hatch but he decided to Tbag on hatch when I was across the map with BBQ and chili to taunt while leaving his friend to die on hook
---
Plunderer's instinct in a nutshell  
---
\*going against a pig\*

\*Gens get rushed\*  
---
\*get downed\*   
---
\*get trapped\*  
---
\*search a chest\*

\*Practically shit yourself when you find a key and the hatch is right next to you\*
---
is this why is called the TEST server? NOW I get it!
---
You know survivors been begging for a noed nerf just because no one seem to be able to cleanse totems on the side. Then when they get hit with it its all of a sudden the perk, that you can destroy before it even have its use, fault and need to be changed. Then you get the comparisons of survivors perks like pre DS vs noed or i guess MoM vs noed and how they're perk gets nerfed or changed but noed doesnt.

Ah my bad, I should then have the built the screenshot in Minecraft and then filmed it with my laptop camera from 2002. Silly mistake
---
I agree, I might have my own little weird lingo and labels for myself, but I don't need that validation from strangers or the rest of the public. I am perfectly capable of being confident in myself as I am. Ah, well. We live in a weird age.
---
More like "Woah! This is permanent!"
---
 It’s said that ol’ Herman here likes the dramatic look of sleeveless lab coats, as stated in his default cosmetic.
---
For anyone wondering, I own all those cosmetics and each changed one ( except claudette) has some major clipping issues on other cosmetics, so these hair changes probably fix that and are an overall improvement
---
Update: I did report him to Behavior and PSN so we will we what happens.
---
If i wasn't a broke boi then you sir would be getting gold, but the best i can do is an upvote
---
\*Current event\* bad give upvotes
---
Does legion even have a shard?
---
What the fuck is that radioactive green Claudette? I want that as a killer.
---
Honestly I run into so many Bills and very few Jakes. Otherwise yeah pretty much
---
Probably because killer perks usually have direct counters and theres 1 killer. What if noed could jump from totem to totem until they are gone? Survivor perks are usually low/no risk, high reward. Killer perks are usually medium/low risk, low reward.
---
I run enduring bamboozle and spirit fury plus ruin
---
Damn
---
I don’t think meta perks are necessarily good for the game. There are so many perks that essentially are useless, if the choices were so good that people played a diverse selection I think that would be good for both sides.
---
Christ, no. I've got my P3-50 Wraith but there is absolutely no fucking reason to remove his bell sound. That'd make him one of the most annoying stealth based killers. Faster than your average killer, cloaked, speed boost out of said cloak, and silent cloak exit?
---
There's a reason it's ultra rare. It makes him a nuisance to play against at the best of times and a nightmare at the worst.
---
I’m an educator and work with kids and salty adults all day long so when I come home to hook some people, I sometimes forget I’m not at school anymore and I hand out “Good job!”s and “You did great!”s like incentive stickers. It’s a curse.
---
As someone who also played since the beginning, dedicated servers came wayyyy to late, and the playerbase like you said left way before then. And also content simply wasn’t coming out fast enough to keep people interested. Constant delays in everything
---
Wait Killers didn't have stun VFX? Like that means they didn't have animations for when they stunned, right? Because if that's the case I never noticed
---
Precision is everything to a Nurse, and Mouse + Keyboard is just more precise than a controller.
---
It will at least cut a chase in half guaranteed.
---
Clearly listed like the on the official website?
---
Obviously survivors will have other objectives like rescues and chases, but that is not the end goal. Whether it takes a simple gen rush or hook bombing for saves, the ultimate goal is to escape and survivors shouldn't be punished for accomplishing that goal because the killer didn't do enough.
---
I feel like SWF needs to have some sort of Averaging system to stop this type of thing, but even without SWF i've seen it happen with just random matchmaking so who knows what needs a fix here
---
Indeed
---
Could you imagine when picking Ellis and he talks like Ash but instead he tells a very long story
---
Go Mad Grit then (Its a legion perk btw)
---
It's a better feeling to not even pay attention to toxic survivors. You messaging him made the toxicity in this game stronger. Besides, he could've just been tbagging in excitement, he can't just KNOW you have bbq.
---
Pooped as he died. I heard that's a thing...
---
I also play at ps4 haha! I usually play piggy but if I see a dwight or jake I switch to bubba
---
I have an open ticket but so far have only gotten an automated response.
---
So if you take a protection hit while getting a safe unhook would you get 2 stacks ?
---
*laughs in Franklin’s demise*
---
I never thought he was bad, he has wallhacks and he completely ignores pallets by vaulting over them
---
decisive strike, deliverance, quick and quiet, and the one with a middle finger i have no clue.
---
So that’s how you use quick and quiet!
---
The style is flat yes. And things don’t feel random. I think he improved later on in the “series” to have more of a theme to referencing game scenarios, like troll moments.
---
The first 2 were ok. But the rest werent that funny to me either. Comedy is subjective though.
---
If where is 1 gen left, and two gens are close too each other, one is 90% done, other one is at 0% which one you gonna fix? 
---
Same with unhooking in front of killers face. Killer can down person who was farmed in 1 second, or chase farmer and if he is good, can cost you a lot of time. The choice is obvious. I'd rather have pressure on and win, than be a "nice guy" and lose.
---
Collision course still holds up, unreal album.
---
I'm not the most active player but I'm closing in on 200 hours mostly as a survivor main and I've literally never faced Plague. Not even once. I'm usually around rank 10. I couldn't even tell you if she's okay with how little anyone seems to want to play her.
---
And then Jay produced The Rising Tied, another unreal album
---
Thought it stood for “Player Toxic Build” the way the community is.
---
You definitely haven't played against tryhard SWF groups or red rank survivors then who will mercilessly loop you across the entire map along with every single pallet. Her own size makes it extremely hard to mindgame since she's pretty much always visible. Also having to rely on a 7000 bp addon just to give her the chance to break a loop only reinforces her image as a terrible base-kit killer. When was the last time you even saw a Plague being played? Even Clown is more popular than her, and that's despite her being the latest killer-release. Now that's just sad.

The concept of lone survivor is what keeps me on the edge of my seat and adrenaline up. I’m not necessarily hating on the meat bags, i just don’t understand where the motivation comes from anymore if the fear is removed from the equation. The Killers are more pussified and survivors have a soldier complex now.
---
You are not wrong about that. Good examples. Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about mechanics and good game design. I’ve come to the conclusion that the best perks help you do what you want to do without interfering with your opponent. Bloodhound is a perk that aids with tracking, I don’t think I’ve ever failed to win the chase once I’ve injured a survivor with this perk but at the same time nobody complains that you use it. Hex ruin is an effective and meta perk but in my opinion is bad game design. It is an oppressive perk that instead of aiding a killer, hinders survivors. If there are any magic the gathering players here hex ruin to me is basically the equivalent of stax strategies. They are strong but aren’t fun for the opponents, something I believe to be important if you want games to thrive.
---
You can if the killer continues to know where survivors are around the map immediately after hooking someone they aren’t missing up skill checks
---
Ghostface breaks his stealth by looking at himself in a mirror.
---
Never forget.
---
Regardless, no need to message people like that. Do what you want though.
---
I mean hey, you don’t have to like it if you don’t want to, I sure won’t force you to enjoy them 
---
Me? I enjoy them poking fun at the games mechanics and the community
---
*Evil Laugh* Bye Bye!
---
Worth a second watch
---
Friday the 13th  accomplished this balance and in my opinion is a poorer quality game.
---
Prob fake
---
Claudette’s becoming more and more immersed. 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
Everybody gangstar until JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind OST: Giorno's Theme "Il vento d'oro" 
---
But my mom says I’m cool
---
It’s dumb
---
bill main here!
---
yeah maybe it was to good to be true, but its not fucking them over if they have the traps on. The point of the killer is to kill and he just let the trap do the work
---
You got what you were looking for
---
That's what happens when Jay met Shinoda, coming right off of collision course. Man that takes me back. Stellar stuff.
---
Maybe i can join the legion ; ;
---
Oh neat this is the first time I've caught it. Thank you.
---
I mean real talk he could theoretically transform INTO Goku and Superman if he got their DNA or whatever the fuck.
---
That said he's got the whole transformation gimmick and a timer (sometimes? I dunno he fucking loses that aspect every other episode). So he'd definitely be weaker than them on average.
---
There's nothing wrong with admitting killers have bullshit perks on their side as well.
---
I'm a survivor main and even I can see why MoM is frustrating.
---
I feel like if the game had text chat it would be less annoying because I wouldn't have to spend time checking the whole map. 
---
I wish I didn't have to search for all them own my own.
---
It feels like hexes were designed with communication in mind to have them destroyed. Just hearing someone say hey I destroyed a dull totem over here , would take a layer of tedium of my shoulders.
---
Sounds fun lmao
---
Its always about sides. Its a tired discussion and the game suffers from this mentality. Thats all im gonna say about it anymore.
---
This is the most respectable comment I have seen on here.
---
You are not wrong haha
---
It was. They really tried hard. I did another game doing the same thing and 2 survivors ended up dying because of the endgame collapse. They wanted to find me so bad 😂
---
You're missing the point. Sure, the OC was worded a bit badly, but what they mean is the noise from the chainsaw shouldn't be so loud.
---
If you have to charge the chainsaw, then why is it always going anyways?
---
Yea! I've been trying to be nice to people (letting them open the gate if I'm 100% sure I'll lose and passive killer). I'm always happy when people message me saying stuff like "Thank you!" Or "Gg!"
---
I like where she is. She can be super good but isnt always. The only problems that I've seen playing her is the occasional vomit not registering after it clearly hit, and her fountain placements on the swamp. Most seem to be at the very edge, where I never see a chase happen unless it started there
---
Self care sucks
---
Camping may be extremely un-fun for the survivors (and it HAS to be boring for the killer), but you gotta realize that if a killer is camping, sometimes it's best to just let the person struggle, and go do gens. It takes about 3 minutes for a person on a hook to die (assuming they don't attempt escape, and they struggle), and that's enough time to do ~two and a half gens.
---
None of your crutches helped? Damn shame.
---
There is a penalty. 
---
It’s called: Lose the game against good survivors.
---
Sounds like someone has been raging in the Wow forums about classic and thinks that same logic will work on the DBD beta test. #SorryNotSorry but your incorrect. Accept it or don't, it doesn't really matter. It's not for streamers to advertise the game that's been out for years in the first place Lmao. It's literally to test the builds, find bugs or shit that needs fixing and report it. Then again I'm using logic and reason, something I doubt works on you.
---
i agree :c adding some things and tweaking some weaknesses like progression upon transition would do just fine. i only bought the game because of him and now i don't even know...
---
Yes please I love these ideas
---
"Yeah, I did well as this killer one time, so he's god tier."
---
I played Ghostface once and got a 4k. Am I ready to face rank 1s yet? No.
---
Yo is that the trappers brother the crapper
---
except when the person on the hook disconnects because they dont want to play against an unsportsman face camper
---
Why?
---
"Am I maaaaaannnn or I am a muppet?"
---
Hell no she's been lacking cosmetics for the longest
---
I actually think he'd be almost OP if the devs did what they intended (making his power break by the character model facing him). Ghostface can just start a chase and stalk, since people wont have time to turn their whole character around for a whole second, or risk getting hit. It'll be like perma T3 myers with added stealth
---
Im more distracted by the fact that youre apparently Vinny from Atlantis
---
&gt;Trapper got a rich boys education knows how to run a business and work with metal.
---
every word in this sentence totally arouses me
---
Why do you say "the illusion of 'you gotta work for it'"? There's no illusion, survivors will literally need to put more effort into getting it active than the previous version of MoM, and due to the circumstances it'll be more difficult for multiple people to have MoM active. 
---
I do wish they hadn't buffed it to counter instadowns though
---
HOW DO I PLAY PIG I DON’T UNDERSTAND HER AMBUSH :(
---
AMANDA MAINS TELL ME YOUR SECRETS
---
(I AM STARTING TO KIND OF SUSPECT THAT MAINING HAG FOR SO LONG HAS MADE ME GARBAGE AT PLAYING ‘NORMAL’ KILLERS)
---
yeah only needed TWO second chance perks no big deal.
---
In a perfect world the PTB would have been used as a "brute force" type thing -- Different PC specs, different playstyles, etc expose games to bugs not found in small internal testing.
---
The problem with GF is that his core power is obviously broken.  It's not a "Hey, it didn't work like the last time, maybe it's a bug? Maybe not?"   It's a "Oh.  This is BROKEN."   A string of people gave the OK for the public to see this in it's current condition.  Do you think, even with the knowledge he may or may not see many changes before going live, that this is good for BHVR in any way?
---
Rofl don't act like peoples don't have legit reasons to complains once again about BHVR's shenaningans.
---
If I'm that guy, I'd be offended being compared to a cowardly character.
---
Plus, no, at least he looks like a normal person. Dwight is uglier. Far uglier. .
---
Murf, Sujan, Aizeyu, Sassy, Clyde, Andy
---
How does Micahel get evil by looking? Where does Amanda keep 4 bear traps? How does the Nurse teleport?
---
Entity bullshit is how
---
It’s more fun playing hide and seek than running circles around pallets like it’s nascar. This games such trash lol.
---
Not exactly; in the picture he's clearly already dead of fright.
---
Nea OP, plz nerf.
---
Me and my buddy made a truck 99% zombie proof. The other 1% tore it to shit.
---
After the nerf Legion isn't that good and in my opinion not that fun. Plague is way more fun imo
---
i'm a red rank survivor. 80% of my games are Billies. i hate them even more than broken hitboxes on Huntress. i am literally tired and bored with Enduring, Spirit Fury, BBQ and Ruin nearly every game. i'm tired of smug idiots who think they're in any way good when they slap on instachainsaw (which is ridiculously cheap add-on price wise yet even i who doesn't play Billy can get ez 4k on red ranks) and just get on top of you and then chainsaw. "boo hoo good survivors won't let this happen". sure and camping is a strategy. yeah. "going back to the hook literally same second someone got unhooked dropping any chase you had is not camping hurr durr". "going after injured to m1 them freshly off the hook is not tunneling - you just found them first". even though you just missed the chainsaw on the other guy so decided to go for the unhooked. doesn't matter your ruin is still there and 5 gens left to fix. 
---
god i hate Billies. specifically hate people who play Billy because they're boring, stale, think they're good when character is literally easiest to learn and use. all they want is 4k to stroke their smol pps afterwards. strategy. what's that? mindgames? never heard of those. no camping and tunneling? what is this?
---
literally, fuck Billies. they're not uncounterable and i can survive them. it's just boring because same fukin perks, same things they do, same "fuck you" attitude, same fukin rage quits when they fail. literally only children play Hillbilly.
---
Plague is more fun but Legion gets you more BP
---
Wheres your favorite place to hide? I need ideas
---
Is this meant to be an improvement? Meg has only ONE nice hair and they are taking it away from us now too? It looks awful
---
Theyre under no obligation to put up with that. Why would I waste my time for my team when I know I have no chance of getting back to the game Im currently sitting in?
---
Alcohol.. :(
---
Pro tip: Just because you're in the killers terror radius doesn't mean they can see you. Don't be afraid to move.
---
Usually the corners of the maps or random tight spaces in map. Don’t go to the basement, it’s too obvious
---
That's perfectly okay! Take a drink everytime you get hit. But you gotta stream it for hilarity
---
I love it and I love you.
---
Look, I don't like camping but from time to time I do it to toxic douchebags like Dweeb, Cuntsson, and Viscunti.
---
I messed up. Forgot about her. I admit my mistake in that gigantic block of text
---
So *that's* who trained Amanda and Legion how to lift Survivors heavier than they are.
---
I STILL FIND PLAGUE TO BE UNFUN BOTH TO PLAY AS AND AGAINST. NOBODY HEALS FROM MY PUKE AND I NEVER GET MY SECONDARY POWER UNLESS IM A SURVIVOR AND THEN THE PLAGUE ALWAYS HAS BLOOD VOMIT FLAMETHROWER POWER!
---
But he has quite a bit more education than everyone below him (besides spirit I messed up I know)
---
They don’t care about that most times. Especially the ones already at high rank. The entire purpose is to be an asshole and make the game unfun.
---
Its nuce that they want feedback from the community, but they shouldnt use the ptb as bug testing programm. They have their own people to do that
---
True, but weapons have durability in that game and resources are limited in terms of how long Counselors can beat up Jason.  There is a way to kill him, but that requires a pretty strict set of events.
---
MAYBE SHE ALREADY HAS ENOUGH STALKERS IN HER LIFE WITHOUT A GAME WHERE SHE IS ROUTINELY STRUNG UP AND KILLED. JUST A WILD GUESS BUT WHO KNOWS. I KNOW IF I WERE FAMOUS I'D HAVE MIXED FEELINGS.
---
Cuties.
---
I chilled in the basement with rancor, noed, and frankies to prevent them from getting the chest lol
---
Yeah, and the thing is, since they are no longer under Starbreeze, they actually have the power to delay the dlc. Where as with Starbreeze, they pretty much had to meet deadlines. 
---
Hopefully plenty of the more dedicated player base are capable of making the sacrifice of not purchasing right at release, until he's actually ready.
---
Some of the jokes fall flat but others like the Trapper in general and the Hookers joke are Gold quality.
---
*Laughs in full black outfit true immersion Detective Fapp*
---
BECAUSE IF YOU STAY, ON THE GEN YOU CAN GET A SKILLCHECK IN THE TIME THAT THE GENERATOR IS REGRESSING, FAIL IT AND FUCK IT UP FURTHER
---
I KEEP MAKING POSTS ABOUT TRYING TO HAVE A DISCUSSION FOR A POTENTIAL FEATURE OR WHATEVER AND I'M ONLY MET WITH NEGATIVITY. IT'S TOTALLY FINE IF PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH MY OPINIONS BUT THAT'S NO REASON TO BE A DICK ABOUT IT.
---
Could you explain why you have this feeling?
---
If Killers made perks. Day 1.
---
Trial begins with all survivors in a broken status and aura of all survivors is shown for one minute.
---
Except worse than No Mither because you're surrounded by an easy to spot fart cloud, leave a blood trail, are constantly coughing or puking which can't be silenced by Iron Will, and if you have an Item in hand it leaves a little easy to follow fart trail behind you wherever you go. Oh yeah, and every window you vault or object you touch turns icky green, making it even easier to suss out if you're in an area. Basically remaining sick is tantamount to giving her anti-stealth on top of the broken status. Honestly I don't know why killer mains complain when survivors don't cleanse at the fountains, they're just making it easier for the Plague to track them, and chase them for half as long as they would've chased a healthy survivor. Corrupt Vomit can be dodged and takes 2 hits to down a healthy survivor, whereas a killer up your ass who can one shot you is far more difficult to deal with.
---
You've lost your mind...
---
OH NO SOMEONE IS FOCUSED ON GENS. SOME OF US ARE SHIT AT LOOPS AND HONESTLY ARE CONTRIBUTING MORE BY FOCUSING ON OBJECTIVES. I GET WHERE YOU ARE COMING FROM THOUGH. THERE IS NO WORSE FEELING THAN GETTING HOOKED AND THE KILLER GOES TO CHASE SOMEONE ELSE AND NEITHER OF THE TWO REMAINING SAFE SURVIVORS THINK THAT MAYBE THEY OUGHT TO COME SAVE MY SORRY ASS SO I GET DOWN TO DEATH HOOK UNTIL FINALLY SOMEONE SAVES ME BUT BY THEN THE KILLER IS ALREADY DONE LOOPING AND IS IN THE AREA SO THEY TUNNEL ME AND I DIE AND DEPIP. FUCK.
---
I approve this message, more YOINKS=more OINKS.
---
&gt;That analogy doesn’t work for a different product under a different thing.
---
That analogy works for all tangible goods and a vast majority of all digital products.  
---
May I ask you in what sense WoW "does this quite a bit"? Because AFAIK Blizzard doesn't just rework massive parts of their expansions people had already paid for.
---
Facts. Spirit was in college and Hag was able to remember and cast magic spells taught to her while she was a child, even after being mutilated and tortured for weeks. A feat indicative of both an impressive memory as well as amazing mental focus.
---
WHY WOULD YOU MENTION THIS? I AM CRYING AGAIN!
---
yeah, i have the same on pc.
---
would lose like 4 pips cause game didn't start when someone dc'd on loading screen. or if i force closed it on loading screen when it was stuck. or if the game crushed.
---
i supposed to be rank 1 by now cause i figured build and playstyle for pipping but with this trash i can't go above 3 with 4 pips cause it just keeps rerolling it back to 4 when some crash happens. and that is plus to already terrible pipping on red ranks where you easily lose 1 when you get tunneled or haven't saved the entire game cause killer failed/greedy teammates or if the killer dc'd mid-game.
---
Amandas coat probably has pockets or something
---
Pretty sure the evil thing is essentially him focusing on how he should kill his target
---
Not sure about nurse
---
&gt;But if the company told you that they can and or would do it when you bought them it isn't their fault.
---
I would like a quote then of explicitly where BHVR stated that they "can and would" radically change the product that I was purchasing.
---
&gt; these things can change for the sake of balance. 
---
There are balance adjustments, something I am completely for.  
---
And then there are reworks for DLCs, something I am completely against.
---
I am working on a meme with a special someone, you better wait so I can defend Pig later today.
---
Don't be sad, just make sure to always be on Piggies side and I want hurt you.
---
Sorry OP, but you’re preaching to the deaf choir, this subreddit consists mostly of asshole killer mains (yeah I SAID IT), who are also partially the reason why the game is going in this god awful unbalanced direction. I know so many people who have just quit, survivor mains AND killer mains, because they see how unfair, broken, and bullshit it’s getting. 
---
New killers are frequently broken, or poorly made. I mean come on, look how dumb Ghostface is? If they had taken Legion’s power and given it to Ghostface with an added stealth element it would have made more sense. The fact that a good chunk of even the DEVS absolutely HATE Legion shows that they never should have released him in the first place. But because they couldn’t come up with anything else or release anything else they were working on yet they just threw him together and threw him out because hey $$$! And that literally nearly ended the game. 
---
That’s what happens when you force yourself to release new dlc every few months/weeks. Things like that KILLED the love for games like COD. (Releasing 1-2 games a year and dlc almost every month means no time to fix anything or design anything worth a shit. And that’s a larger developer that couldn’t handle it!) They should have delayed that chapter and put it on hold for proper design and testing or to work on The Plague instead. The vast majority of the community would have understood and waited. 
---
Bugs on bugs on bugs that go ignored for months at a time and need multiple patches to phase out. (Fucks sake there’s still bugs from YEAR ONE!!!!) 
---
A dumbass for a Lead Community Manager who makes jabs at survivors for being “whiney” on official live streams. It’s literally her job to listen to the community and it’s feedback and relay it to the entire team, and that’s the attitude she has? Good god. 
---
Developers who suck at their own game. 
---
Developers who hate their own creations.
---
Developers who are CLEARLY unqualified or severely lazy.
---
An increasingly toxic community. 
---
Continuously broken Ranking systems.
---
Severe RNG issues.
---
Severe Connection Issues.
---
The list goes on and on and on. 
---
The only team that has their shit together is the cosmetic team in my eyes. 
---
In short, there is no use saying stuff like this on this subreddit. You’ll just get downvoted to all shit, flamed, laughed at, trolled, etc. 
---
I honestly feel like if the devs don’t get their shit together and if something doesn’t give by the end of the year, the game will start to seriously die. Noob3 has been calling all the shit out for the most part lately, and even Hybrid Panda is even getting sick of some of the shit and calling for the devs to fix things. (And he’s an official Fog Whisperer)
---
The Plague is a mid tier character, she has a lot of trouble getting that 4k. The reasoning is that it takes a little too long for her to truly come online. You have to find survivors, then puke on them, and then try and hit them. However, looping her is a breeze because she doesn't have any anti-loop capabilities. Clown has his M2, Legion can vault, Nurse and tele, etc... but Plague has nothing of that sort.
---
You'll be running into more troubles as you climb the ranks. Rank ~5 survivors never cleanse at all, they just loop the Plague like she's a regular M1 killer. This makes her even more difficult to use because her cleansing ability gives her a huge advantage. 
---
That doesn't mean she's a bad killer. Hell, I think she's a damn cool killer, but keep in mind she has some major limitations in front of her. Try to pair up add-ons with her, the ones that makes it so it requires less M2 to make survivors broken. That should speed the chase time, giving you a better window of opportunity.
---
I actually like this.
---
I’m sorry I think you meant Blendette, and Farmdette and Sandbagdette. 
---
90% Claudette mains are the new Toxic Nea’s. To killers AND survivors.
---
instachainsaw is a braindead add-on combo. and at least 80% of Billies on red ranks use it. 
---
i play Leatherface sometimes for dailies or if i see a Blendette to camp her in the basement. and his instasaw is also ridiculous but he has no mobility so it's not that bad. like, balanced, fine, i guess.
---
Sure, but that's not an actual indicator of how balanced the game is.
---
Having a survivor DC at the beginning of the match puts the survivors at a MAJOR disadvantage, and it would be best to disregard those games entirely for the purposes of determining game balance.
---
I would argue the same thing for killers who disconnect early in the game (due a dropped connection or what have you) not being counted as survivors surviving.
---
It is somewere in those agreements everyone skips by, it tells you that any character or thing bought in the game can be changed completly if the creators of the game do so desire it. We all agreed with it since we all play the game. 
---
Also if a killer is 100&amp; bullshit they deserve a rework and since you already agreed, live with it.
---
Worthless skank: You always screw up, don't you? If you fail a skillcheck, you have a 25/50/75% chance not to give the killer a warning, but instead show the killer your aura for 60/40/20 seconds. 
---
"FORGIVE ME ALREADY!" - Mikan  
---
Clumsy: Your natural ability to reveal yourself lends itself to some... weird uses. Performing a rushed vault stuns you for 3/2/1 seconds. if the killer was looking in your direction, they are blinded for 3/4/5 seconds  
---
"I'm so sorry!" - Mikan
---
Meg and Nea have obvious lesbian energy ok
---
Okay, so it will be the first one. The lamer it sounds, the better! A bunch of cringey Gen Z kids are supposed to name the thing, so something that sounds like a lame porno is definitely in character.

Considering Huntress raised herself from a young age and maintained herself, her house,  and her weaponry (*AFAIK all of her add-ons besides Iridescent Head are things she made or scavenged and repurposed by herself; she knows what she's doing when it comes to making and improving weapons*) for years without any guidance or outside assistance, I think she should be quite a bit higher on this list.
---
I also find Michael's placement odd. Sure he demonstrates rather impressive animal cunning in more than a few scenes throughout his films, but I wouldn't put him on the same level as a brilliant neurologist who was employed by the US government to develop a way to control human minds. To be quite honest, I personally don't think Michael fits on this list; he's more of a supernatural force than a thinking and feeling person.

Finally, I feel Nurse's placement is in contrast with her lore as she is stated as having been forced to work at Crotus Prenn because she was "without *any* education". In her case Nurse doesn't mean 'trained medical professional' as much as it means 'person who feeds, bathes, and gives medicine to the inmates'.

---
Good but still not a go to perk. Definitely the second best one for slowing gens down.
---
I'm not saying it's every man for themselves, Im saying we're all here to play a game. I wouldn't expect a survivor getting facecamped to waste their time stalling for us when they could be getting to their next game where they're actually getting to play. Facecamping is an asshole move, bar none, because even if you genrush and escape with only 1k, that one person had a game that was just ".....okay time to smash my spacebar/a button, ohh now I'm dead."
---
It's shitty, and camping shouldn't be justified because it gives EVERYONE ELSE an easy game.
---
I don't get your downvotes. It's not healthy being that upset over a videogame IMHO. If it's such a bother, stop playing.
---
Always try again when you like the killer
---
It used to be Billy, since I started with that guy, but lately I've been playing more Nurse and Huntress. I find most killers fun....I switch constantly. Will be buying the new one too. My Freddy is almost complete so I'll be spamming him when that happens, and after that I'll level up Hag or Legion :3 I can't waaaaaaait
---
i mean i love Whitest Kidz U'Know. i think their comedy is literally top tier masterpiece. my British friend prefers obscure lad humour that to me is just isn't funny. my German husband laughs at dad jokes completely unironically =\ 
---
it's just your taste. i think eggplants taste like old sponge. my mum can't live without them and thinks it's some gourmet shit.
---
I feel like the indicator sorta goes against the idea of ghostface. He's supposed to remain unseen until the last moment. If he gets caught and then just pops back behind cover before his indicator goes off, he's still in stealth but now you know where he is.
---
I like the idea of line of sight breaking his stealth. If BHVR fixed it so that line of sight actually matters, it would be perfect. His idea does look like a better system than the failed one we currently have
---
In general though, since he's only on one platform, there are inevitably going to be less bills than others.
---
Shhhh, he has a 115% movement speed, he doesn't need a power if he has 115% speed 😎.
---
As someone who has problems vs. Clown: how to you counter him? He can effectively force you to drop each pallet early, or at least 4 pallets.
---
I agree with the general point of the argument but I disagree about removing the spotting feature of GhostFace as if they did that he would just be a one shot machine with no counterplay besides running and hiding.
---
From what I've heard, Deathgarden is relatively balanced.
---
Yep
---
He doesn't have any purple or Ebony add ons
---
Would be more accurate if he was still looking away in the second one.
---
Go visit Maddie on Twitter! Her art is suppper adorable! XOXO
---
it's cannon there friends
---
Honestly that would be awesome
---
Ok you know what I'm going to say it, saying that the dev are stupid and Ghostface is dumb is counter productive
---
Imagine being bad at a game and then thinking everybody else in the world must be just as bad.
---
The question is:
---
How much more "teleport" killers can you make before it becomes stale? This is more a problem of the chase/pallet dynamic inherent to the game.
---
Exactly!
---
I got that achievement as nurse. If someone has Deep wounds it counts for the achievement. So if people bring borrowed time it counts.
---
Mario should give that Boo the Super Crown
---
Someone who I really admire and respect.
---
Damn, this community can create some really awesome artwork. 
---
And thanks for including the artist tag.
---
Not to mention if you included that into his base kit he would have two free add-on slots... hell no.
---
You ever drink baileys from a shoe?
---
We were taking hits for eachother lol. Never leave a man behind!
---
Its screenshots of the trappers trailer
---
If you want altruism, you need Empathy and We'll Make It. You have We'll make it at the very least so swap out No Mither for that. After unhooking someone you can heal them fully in around 6 seconds.
---
I agree to an extent.
---
The pig nerf wasn't significant, it just removed an unfun factor.
---
Ghostface indeed does need a serious buff, and it is odd to me how they add weird arbitrary weaknesses, counterplay is one thing, having 2 perks (OoO and Spine Chill) make your killer unplayable and then forcing you to stealth if you want to have a power is another.
---
Jane is not fat. She has a standard hitbox and a regular movement speed. 
---
I am fat. I would have a larger-than-normal hitbox and "walk briskly up the stairs" is an exhaustion perk for me.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
I didn’t do that so I’m still confused as to why they said it lol
---
You shouldn't. They once release perk values, showing how often the perks were run. 
---
Tried to claim SC was run only 21% of the time. 
---
Either through sheer incompetence or willfull manipulation, the neglected to mention that their stats were PER PERK SLOT. In other words, self care was being run 84% of the time. 
---
So yeah. The players have it right here. Never, never trust the developer's stats. Not even the ones that agree with you, like the SWF stats. Just don't.
---

---
Alphadette is giving me the hardcore lesbian vibe and I am all for that.
---
Borrowed Time and WGLF are gonna be a nice BPs farm nowadays.
---
Ok thank you so much! I’ll keep that in mind any time someone starts getting mad at me online
---
I kinda run spine chill mainly to screw with Spirits
---
DC and not choosing to buttonmash to stall for your team are two different things though. A survivor dcs right as I go to hook them doesn't hold the same energy as if Im a camper. If I'm staring at them for 5 seconds, then 10, then 20, It's obvious that they're not getting unhooked. And if they are, even with BT I'm probably just going to down them again, unless their team is well coordinated enough to bodyblock me effectively, at which point nothing is getting done, and if I don't down them again I'm downing one of their friends and they're getting the same treatment. 
---
Dcing when the team can benefit from your hands on a generator, or you getting chased, that kind of sucks. Dcing when your team has nothing to gain off of you except the time it takes you to die, yeah go ahead and attempt escape and just kys. At least we can both move on to games with better killers faster. 
---
I can't understand it, I've never straight up facecamped even the most toxic of survivors because I can always get more done if I walk away, so the logic of facecamping is beyond me except maybe "hurr durr guaranteed kill." But the logic of letting yourself die because you don't want to spend 2 minutes of your life buttonmashing in a game you've essentially already lost, that makes sense.
---
Usually you start a chase with the survivor injured anyway, since they either elect to wait till you're close to stop repairing, or you start the chase by finding and smacking them. Corrupt, on its own, without the timer, is the second or first best killer power in the game, second only to (maybe) a good nurse blinks.
---
Sometimes they're assholes, sometimes they just want to see the animation
---
Would have preferred shirtless Myers but this will do for now.
---
I think that should be added onto lithe just like balanced landing has fall stun reduction.
---
Pretty awesome concept! Took a lot of time I imagine.
---
Debatable, because you have to prioritize getting stacks for the perk and previously you would need to just be chased.  If you run like borrowed time and WGLF yeah MoM will be more effective.
---
If people weren't angry about it they might release it as is due to a lack of feedback though
---
I think you need to calm down.
---
At this point I think it is going to get released almost as is anyway :C
---
Huntress isn't as good as she once was, but 115% would be ridiculous on her. She'd be fine with a few minor buffs.
---
Spirit and Creature both got changes before release so I there's hope.
---
Bond is such a helpful perk and this problem of healing yourself can be solved by just bringing a medkit. If you have levelled up your character to 50, chances are that you'll have plenty to spare.
---
That's rad. Did you make the patches yourself?
---
I would remake this post tbh 👀 I know you edited in the correct version but it seems a lot of people have bad impressions from the initial image
---
Thanks a lot for the breakdown ! 
---
I faced The Plague yesterday and we all drank at fountains as soon as we got sick (level 18/17 survivors), she must have been happy given the posts I see on this sub about her power. 
---
A good Clown is scary as a noob, the only one I met wiped us in like 5 minutes straight. 
---
Very fun game on both sides, I keep switching between Survivor and Killer learning the ropes. Currently level 25 on both Claudette and Trapper. I saw that everyone was using the Self-Care perk so I decided to level up Claudette to get the perk for all survivors.
---
Who is Creature?
---
How would 115 be ridiculous though?
---
Legion
---
It procs off safe unhooks as well? That's awesome! I'm glad they didn't go with just the protection hits idea.
---
OooOooh! What else?
---
Wasaaaaaaapp!!
---
Made it so she couldn’t hear the wooshing noise herself so she could track survivors by listening.
---
&gt; maxed out on altruism
---
If you maxed out altruism but your Benevolent emblem was Bronze or even absent, then you probably sandbagged a person or two
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
Some of the funnest I've ever had in this game. Of course it was at the expense of the killer dealing with four sprint bursts or at the expense of the survivors dealing with a floating Myers head with a chainsaw but fun none the less. 
---
I had one game where I played HillBilly and some survivor brought the hag offering. Because of this I was a hag with no heartbeat and a chainsaw. I 4k'd and they all reported me for something they did lol.
---
The internet connection. 
---
Nah, I'd say Survivors. I meet more toxic survivors than I do Killers
---
Better to be bad and get better then OP and then become super good.
---
When someone asks a question that goes against the circlejerk they’re participating in, they feel personally attacked and vote it down rather than answering them.
---
Thats a very old feature actually
---
in my experience the wraith gets tonnes of blood points for smacking someone right after uncloaking, 1100 if I remember correctly to a max of 8000, hook everyone 3 times so get 12 hooks and smack people lots and kick gens
---
It's not really fair to compare her to Nurse because Nurse is blatantly overpowered. A 115% Huntress would be Spirit level.
---
This is perfect.
---
Brown medkit with 40% of its charges*
---
it's longer. Standard Terror Radius is 32m, her lullaby is 45 and directional.
---
No, are you dumb? I know that the 360 thing was a bug. But, buddy, if you expect every bug to get caught by QA, you’re incredibly naive. Also, just because QA misses a bug, which it’s clear they have. doesn’t mean that there is no QA. Which was what the comment I responded to was saying.
---
I was giving a suggestion on what they could change
---
DAMN, I FORGOT HOW SALTY SURVIVORS ARE WHEN YOU KILL THEM ALL. CALM DOWN, CLAUDETTE. JUST A GAME. EEKKKKK
---
I think it's a platform/region/rank difference. Where I play (PC/Eu/Mid) killers aren't toxic for the most part. Maybe 1 game out of 10 is miserable. Or maybe my definition of "toxic" is way different from general
---
You can see you tried making a good image, drawn meme +1!
---
Honestly I would put Tapp in an extinct. I don't think I've seen him since the Saw Movies.
---
I dont see her being above Billy (yes I rate Spirit above Billy if you were wondering). If the melee-hatchet combo would be problematic they could straight up just increase the cooldown, but I just dont see this being all that OP, as I said this is something which could easily be tested on a PTB.
---
As if Bubba needed a nerf...
---
it's not the side it's the players, I'm never toxic unless I've had a bad day at school or work and want to have more fun
---
Yeah agree, if we get to 1 gen left or if the killer just isn’t doing that well, i just do totems. 
---
My only real complaint is when a killer clearly doesn’t need it. Like a nurse on the game that kills everyone, closes the hatch and hits me with noed. That sucks, but in general i think the perk is fine.
---
Using this with distressing on the Doctor can prove very profitable
---
No, they're cunts. That's it
---
&gt; gen rushing, hook saboing
---
How's that toxic?
---
I get a drawing tablet for my birthday in a few days! I'll make a (Terrible) attempt for you guys!
---
Well, Spirit was considered quite weak on release, because her power was too easy to read and exploit due to sound issues. Spirit became much stronger after adjustments were made, while still being a fun killer to face, thanks to community input. 
---
Hopefully we can expect the same for this killer
---
Killers carry the game literally. They are also 1 versus 4 which adds the bullying element. When survivors get their ass kicked, they either take it like normal human beings, or leave and call the killer player a baby or bad because they are so pathetically delusional that they can't understand when they are trash. But then there are killers who get looped and get mad that people aren't running into their blades. When I get looped the fuck out of, and they aren't tbagging, I'll give them exit or hatch cause it's a respect thing. But all these kids watching noob3 and thinking it's cool to tbag and shit on the killer and then complain when they die are pathetic. Both sides have a hard time being nice players, but at the end of the day, the killer gets the most shit so should be given a pass.
---
These guys are human man. Bugs are gonna get missed. Obviously it’s a big bug, but it happens. This bug could’ve emerged in the most recent build of the game and hasn’t had time to get fixed yet. 
---
The OoO thing as far as we know is actually working by design. The survivor is able to see the killer, thereby negating his power. Does that mean that QA didn’t catch it? Maybe. Either way, there’s so much going on behind the scenes that to say that three things that are currently wrong means that there is no QA at all is asinine.
---
What is percieved as toxic, gen rushing is pretty much always percieved as toxic. sabo on the other hand isnt as much, but some people will say it is.
---
It is a thing...
---
You notice how even the best killer players can struggle getting a win with Billy on certain map layouts? 
---
Billy used to be free dubs.
---
&gt; Killers need counter play indeed, but that counterplay consists out of pallets, windows and survivors perks
---
How is any of that a counterplay to a ticking RBT in endgame?
---
Healing glitch? Seems like a big deal.
---
Lol. Also, friendly reminder that if you leave while being moried, you just be moried in real life.
---
*teabagging intensifies*
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
All queue at the same time, be roughly the same rank, hope not many lobbies are open at the time you try. Back out if you didn’t get it.
---
All survivors I know try to heal ASAP if they run SC.
---
But yeah I agree with that last part
---
Yeah, I see no problem for Huntress to be 115%, her anti loop power isn't as good as Spirit or Hag powers, she doesn't have as much map pressure and  she on top of that has a 45 meters of directional lulllaby ( Spirit and Hag also don't have any lullaby ). With 115% speed, Huntress mains might stop DCing on maps that aren't Autohaven Wreckers or MacMillan Estate 😁. 
---
But, devs would probably nerf her power if they make her 115% speed, so she might become just a other M1 killer with a basic power, like Clown or Legion. I expect that to happen if she becomes 115%.
---
Hello! That is the second time I've been noticed lol
---
Bubba basement is the best
---
That is why I swapped off of Ace. His massive head sticks over barriers.
---
&gt; gen rushing is pretty much always percieved as toxic
---
What _perceived_ as a gen rush, I'd say. Most of the time there's no real gen rushing happening.
---
&gt; sabo on the other hand isnt as much, but some people will say it is.
---
For some people fast chainsaw add-ons are toxic. For some it's toolboxes... You can't claim a thing/action is toxic just because _some_ people think it is. Because you'd end up with 90%+ of the game marked as toxic
---
How do you define camping?
---
Exampled
---
The hooked person is in the middle of the last 3 gens which are very close to each other what am I supposed to do leave the hook and gens unattended?
---
What about the survivors who unhook before the killer even leaves the hooked person?
---
What I run BQC and no one's aura appears meaning they are somewhere nearby?
---
Maybe it's a problem with layouts, not players?
---
Op, just get whoever you think you would enjoy more. Both are fun in their own ways, and I can’t pick for you as you might hate one and love the other.  Legion has discordance which I personally really like, so there’s that ;p
---
I’m not toxic unless I’m being insulted or something like that lol. Eye for an eye.
---
Wow, why didnt I think of perception not being a bias for anything.
---
I think that was Demi, Ardetha, and Ussylis.
---
Players are getting better at learning the layouts...?
---
Adam has started to gain some love.
---
Gotta love pizza :)

Mikan Tsumiki, The Ultimate

Power: Lots of shots: You start the game with 10 syringes, loaded with poison. You can inject it into downed survivors, inflicting them with a Deep Wounds debuff, which doesn't stop on the hook. If the Deep Wounds timer runs out, they are sacrificed immediately. Syringes can be refilled at Med-kits, spread around the map. The syringes can also be used to booby-trap the generators, inflicting survivors with a Madness tier 2 debuff, as well as windows and pallets to inflict survivors with Hindered status effect. Each debuff lasts for 30 seconds.  
---
Perks:  
---
1) Forgive me!: Your Terror Radius is increased by 8/16/24 meters if you haven't landed an attack for 45 seconds. Landing an attack decreases it by 8/16/24 meters for 45 seconds
---
"If you did something wrong... You'd forgive yourself right away!" - Mikan
---
2)  Anatomy knowledge: Your obsession with grim allows you to know where to srike to inflict maximum pain. Landing a hit inflicts blinding pain on a survivor, manifesting in the same effect that can be seen when blinding a killer with a flashlight. The effect lasts for 1/2/3 seconds -/-/as well as inflicts Mangled status effect
---
"Everyone's scared, panicking, and trying to escape... There are so many fun things to watch in horror movies... " - Mikan
---
3) Deadly silence: Whenever a notification would appear, you see an aura of a survivor who caused it for 3/4/5 seconds
---
"It's such bad manners to raise your voice inside a hospital" - Mikan
---
What meme? I wanted to spark a discussion to see which survivors are common and which survivors aren't. If it was a meme, I would've labelled it shitpost.
---
None of the above
---
Wish I could see progress for the trophies on ps4😭 grinding for the heal others for 50 helath states while injured atm and I feel like I’ve healed 200 survivors
---
Some players, for sure. But that's true for killers, too. And I was thinking more about new maps/layouts, not the original ones.
---
If thats not camping how is it defined because I get accused of camping when that happens
---
Imagine not being good at one of the most easiest thing in the game.
---
Then survivors crying "OnLy NuRsEs AnD BiLlIeS EvErYwHer3 PlZ n3rF"
---
I don’t know why people think killers get better. 
---
The only way killers get better is learning mind games, running map tiles, and add ons. You’re still at the survivor’s mercy even if you know how to do these things.
---
Ok my time to shine:
---
Balanced landing 
---
Ds 
---
MoM 
---
Adrenaline 
---
Add a purple flashlight with long life battery low amp filament, because you’re going toxic you have to teabag at every pallet and click the light on every stun
---
I mean, thats how games work now. Remember 10 years ago? You paid for your game. If it was good, great, if not, you got 6-12 months of updates and perhaps a season pass, then you were done.   
---
The cost of the game isnt that important when its a multiplayer game people sink 1000s of hours into, I know its easy to shit on the devs, and there probably was an element of laziness in GFs design, but they do try, and you can at least see how they are reinvesting the revenue DbD creates back into the game. I mean compare Dbd to the majority of other live games in thier 3rd or 4th year of service, and they are actually doing an okay job.
---
ON SOME LEVEL I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'D CAMP IN THE LIVE BUILD, BUT WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK IS THE POINT IN CAMPING ON THE PTB??? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TESTING THE MECHANICS YOU ABSOLUTE MORON.
---
Switch Ace and Laurie
---
Honestly, there are probably more toxic killers, based on what the community calls toxic. But, there are also a large amount of toxic survivors
---
Y'all know ptb is for testing right.
---
I’m playing on a dance pad with my screen turned off!
---
The little pig on the umbrella tho... 😇
---
its fucking them over if the killer blocks the only way to get the traps off and AFK's
---
At least the last 4 kilers released. (To the best of my memory without checking) had adjustments made before going live.
---
IF THEY'RE GONNA GIVE US A GHOSTFACE OC WHY CAN'T THEY GIVE US AN OC SURVIVOR TO GO ALONG WITH IT(AND MAP)
---
I mean, watching really good killer mains, I see tons of things they do that are mindboggling to me. I would never even think about some angles you'd see from Sverkeren's Huntress. And dashes from PsychoScorpionz? There's just no way every above the average Pig main knows how/when to do them. And that's just using powers. Their general game sense is miles above mine.
---
Having played both roles extensively, i see it from both sides equally. I wanted to know what the community experiences more of.
---
It's a bug, I didn't change any of my settings
---
BUT NOED is a crutch perk lol
---
Too bad they're dying now...
---
Marketting.
---
Make this killer weak so people react.
---
Make it better on release so people buy it.
---
Add a dark cosmetic for its power be optimized.
---
100% success and you're all falling for it
---
That makes no sense.
---
Yikes.
---
So down the obsession, who yeets off the hook in front of you, then just picks you up again? Why did this Nurse not just smack you, close the hatch then wait out the 60's. It was so obvious what was gonna happen.
---
If you have the david king (it may be in your downloads for free it was on ps4) use the david king perk wglf its if you prefer playing survivor over killer that is!
---
Don't go out of your way for corrupt Purge, you can lose serious momentum and you might not even find a survivor in time to use effectively. Also Thanatophobia helps as they'll either cleanse constantly for easy corrupt or they'll stay dick to deny you and thana has time to be effective. If you get a survivor broken commit to the chase if it's not a strong loop. Also just vomit on gens and lit totems as everything else is a waste of time.
---
Lmao "MY chest!"
---
Exactly lol
---
I don't really like that Enduring change, honestly. But the PGTW change is nice.
---
You could try Overcharge, A Nurse's Calling, BBQ &amp; Chili, Make Your Choice. It works great with the addons that gives you high mobility while cloaked and breaking pallets/gens really fast while cloaked (Windstorm and Shadow Dance if I remember well). With that build you can hit survivors, then go to break a gen and go back to get the survivor healing nearby. You have high mobility (good map pressure) + you Can deny pallets and windows by bodyblocking it before the survivor reaches it.
---
You see the thing is that time has repeadetly shown that complaining and community outroar is the best way for BHVR to start fixing shit.  
---
It's not devs fault but they allow that kind of behaviour to pass freely.
---
&gt; If you 99 a hate there is no endgame
---
Typo? I don't understand that sentence.
---
But the thing is - you can't escape with an active RBT. Doesn't matter if RBT timer is running or not. And EGC timer doesn't stop. So you have a very limited time to both remove RBT and escape. That would make EGC very unaltruistic (too risky to go for a save, if EGC time is like at 50% - you go down, get RBTed, you die)
---
That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  Killers being powerful shouldn't be dependent on add-ons.
---
Multiple second chance perks, perfectly balanced, BHVR. /s
---
The people that call survivors or killers more toxic than the other, or encourage others to do so (that's you).
---
How is 2009 not 10 years ago again?
---
The game has been out for 4 years, at a low price point, its a game that has a huge grind, and a dedicated community, i wouldnt say its unrealstic to say that most players who play more than an hour or so a day are at at least 1k hours after this long. 
---
Compared to what Dbd was doing 2 years ago, under starbreeze, and how other games from much bigger publishers have treated live service games as a moneyspinner. (EA etc) Dbd is doing an okay job.
---
That's not what I meant basically Billy has no purple or Ebony add ons giving him any as he is will make him Way stronger than he already is so he would have to be rebalanced somehow before he can get any
---
Silly survivor. Your feelings arent as important as MY killer feelings.
---
Are you toxic to same players, though? Or it's a stranger's eye for an eye?
---
You are wrong here, QA can do playtests too if you ask them to. At least it's like that where I'm working at
---
He needs immunity against detection perks and more counter play against survivors who break him out of his stealth, plus, in what univers Myers is quiet ? Myers breathing is literally map wide ... .
---
No penalty?
---
If Survivors aren't brain-dead, then the penalty is 5 gens done by the time one Survivor dies.
---
When you're about to Mori/kill a survivor with this on: You Yeed your last Haw, boy!
---
I try to never be toxic at all honestly. I ignore mean messages, i never teabag killers, etc. Only “toxic” thing i do, is i shake my head no whenever i down a Meg that’s been teabagging and looping me all game lol.
---
What?? I didn't mention GIVING billy more add-ons.  I'm saying the only thing about billy needing changed is the Carburettor Tuning Guide and Thomspon's Mix, which creates insta-saw billy.
---
Play Civilization, for example
---
Wait instant saw?
---
Which add ons are those?
---
Just wondering what people think my dude. No need to be rude.
---
It's still more quiet than ghostface
---
lol
---
I literally just said.  Carburettor Tuning Guide and Thomspon's Mix.
---
I just wanted to say that you need Jesus, but then I remembered that I would want the same
---
Based on how many messages I get it's definitely survivors
---
Can I ask why not 4? Not for an argument just trying to understand the reasoning. It would be no different than Michael. Ghostface is a m1 killer in most cases uou cant catch up to a survivor in 20 seconds without a loop starting
---
Swap David and Dwight
---
What's with Spirit, Plague and Clown? I honestly think they were fine after PTB. Further tweaking was there, sure, but nothing serious
---
Are those the ones that decrease the charge time and cool down time?
---
What's wrong with sub logo? Why is it gay?
---
Seems to be the popular opinion.
---
I played Spirit since release, and she was always visble to me O.o
---
YES!  Have you even played this game?  Do you even play billy?
---
Those are some shinny veneres 😍 Colgate smile anyone
---
hunter lock
---
Omg I need to try this.
---
Unfortunately, yeah. Memes get upvoted into heaven, even if it's a reposted meme that has been posted 10 times already, while interesting discussions rarely, if ever, make it to the front page.
---
Haven't played Billy since Plauge came out
---
I agree and kind of debated with myself whether I should repost this or not.
---
I think I will. Worst that will happen is that it gets taken down for spam.
---
Always wondered the same thing. I'm assuming it's either doctor was experimenting on them or the entity put them there as it cant completely copy the real world
---
his keyboard has autism, be nice to him &gt;:(
---
**THEN WHY THE SHIT ARE YOU CALLING TO NERF HIM??  I'm convinced you're a troll so i'm done with this.**
---
Proud Kate slave
---
I would assume Head On lmao
---
I got queued with a no ed killer for about 20 games in a row (I'm purple rank)
---
&gt; Is there a way to see your own ping in the lobby?
---
Your ping is always 0-5 because you are the killer so the survivors connect to your computer. its peer to peer.
---
Could have great synergy with thrilling tremors if it lasted longer
---
No because I was reading a post from earlier talking about Billy needing to be nerfed and I thought of a good way to do it without making him bad while also coming up with a reason to give him new add ons since he and Nurse are the only killers that don't have Ebony ones.
---
Also not sure how being misinformed because of bad memory makes me a troll
---
*honk honk*
---
SWF is tailor-made for a bully dynamic. There are people who feel empowered being in a group who gangs up on and taunts  a lone person. Especially in an online game where that person (in this case killer) cannot defend themselves physically in any way. That’s why there are so many toxic survivors. It’s just a negative part of the human condition and this game happens to inadvertently facilitate it. 
---
So I would say survivors. There are plenty of asshole killers out there but I would say at least half of them have merely snapped under the stress of the bully dynamic and just see most or all survivors as hostile.
---
Next update, we rally together and befriend survivors. I think we just need to show them alittle love and maybe they’ll stop all the hate.

Tum Tums hate him! Find out how one accent boi triggers the saw wielding mumbler!
---
I can’t tell if that’s just one of your copy paste or you’re serious. But I agree that some maps are cancer for her
---
It is extremely unique? Have you seen the post about the different types of hunters? The survivors even have traits and special abilities. You also have a persona system that is nothing like the perk system in DBD. The core mechanics are the same, yes. But that's literally it.
---
As a QA in the industry myself I can say that’s incorrect, at my studio us QA have an active role in commenting on design testing as well as bug finding, we regularly suggest changes to design and usually these are listened to and acted upon based on our feedback.
---
The main issue you have here is Ghostface has gone from being played internally by a small group of people to the PTB which is a massive jump in terms of coverage.
---
Suddenly you have a lot more eyes looking at this one thing and something that seems quite obvious like his ability being stopped when spotted by a downed survivor or his move speed being too slow becomes a lot more apparent.
---
I’m not sure what you mean by
---
&gt;their stats were PER PERK SLOT.
---
You can only run a perk once so obviously they’d just count it once resulting in lower numbers.
---
I don’t like playing Wraith scummy so I like to run MyC, Bbq, NC and Enduring with Windstorm and put pressure on the hook rescuers and try to snowball altruism from there.
---
This artist is amazing, she did some Chibis of only female killers and it was super cute. I asked her if she was going to make ones for the other killers and she said she'd love to. I'd love to use her art for the actual killer portraits in game, so this is exciting!
---
To be fair I didn't know that was a thing but now I do and will remember to do so
---
This is for real.
---
Truth be told
---
I never escape killers unless they make a mistake or they take too long to catch me and they give up. I basically burn as much time as possible. I'll go to a pallet and hit them and loop around it unless they break it. I basically just keep away. You dont need to escape the killer if you haven't been hooked and one or two gens got during the chase.
---
oh this has to be bait, you're talking about nurse like she's bad.
---
AH. I mean that could help, idk tho since the lullaby also makes mindgaming really hard if the survs listen carefully (provided the sound isnt bugged).
---
I want to play this Plauge you speak of.
---
AND THEY SHOULDN'T SAY IT IS A CHAPTER WHEN THEY TOLD EVERYONE THAT A ONE CHARACTER RELEASE, IS IN FACT A PARAGRAPH!!!
---
The Entity isn't a Dark One or Kandarian, but it is almost certainly a random Necronomicon creature that was freed.
---
&gt;thus negating the bed to add a killer from his world?
---
So? (Bill didn't get a killer, either)
---
I dont have to imagine I see people do it all the time.
---
An then still nobody ranks up, because everybody can't pip without altruism.
---
Escaping may be a "win" but I'd take a death an a pip over an escape an no pip anyday.
---
Gradual improvement is a thing. In 2016 people jsut hugged infinites and didnt pallet-loop, despite there being like 40 pallets perk map. Now there's like 15 and it's still enough. 2016 players wouldnt survive a second in current maps, whilst current players would be unkillable in 2019. And things like curving as Billy is still really rare to encounter, but a lot of billy players are gradually getting better at it.
---
They are joking if they think a short exposed is good for higher ranked matches. Micheals literally wait until they are right next to you to get to tier 3 because even with 60 seconds a good survivor will just run until it's gone if you hit it too far away.
---
I feel bad for the killer if he finds this thread
---
You can install Make Lobbies Great Again (MLGA), it pulls the ping directly from your router/computer, and often the in-game indicator can be off by as much as 50 ping (from what I've seen, but usually it's off by 20-30 only).
---
Considering it's 13 meters less warning, I'd say it would help greatly
---
You can’t compare the fun part of something with the competitive side of it
---
For as much as I wish that they’d buff many killers, I wouldn’t hope for them to buff her. Seeing as they recently buffed MoM, they couldn’t be more survivor sided.
---
Except if nobody gets any rescues, nobody gets any pips. 
---
I'd rather pip and die then escape an barely safety.
---
Also make him IMMUNE TO OBJECT OF FUCKING OBSESSION AND SPINE CHILL. Thanks.
---
Billy is at 100% speed when revving, you go at the same speed as a survivor
---
have you heard how loud ghostface is?
---
LGBT Pride month.
---
Distressing does not boost your BP the same way BBQ does, if you use it for BP on Doc you're wasting a perk slot.
---
Distressing allows you to MAX out the category faster, but it still caps at 8k.  Doc always gets 8k Deviousness. Distressing isn't good for BP.
---
Why gays have their month, but straight people not? I want sexuality equality
---
Play any killer you like (Besides Pig or Trapper) and use BBQ. you should be getting at least 50k per game.
---
Survivors, when you play nothing but powerful easy mode it makes you cocky.
---
Ay at least he look amazing, that's what I care about the most.
---
I think people including me are just scared that we get a freddy 2.0
---
That's what a PUBLIC TEST SERVER is designed for, play testing.  
---
You the players are meant to test it, that's why all these companies have Public Beta Servers from LoL to DbD, it is far better environment for testing new shit as well as regular gamers will test things that a Developer would never think to test.  
---
Major point here is the Devs don't realise that experienced survivors turn their camera around all the time to be observant while on gens.
---
gachiHYPER
---
that’s why enduring and spirit fury exist 😍 with them everyone’s good!
---
oh no they're definitely trying to nerf MoM but just dont know what they're doing. The devs aren't completely oblivious, but they make mistakes, I wouldnt count on the MoM-change going live.
---
Now all we need is a killer with a flashlight so we can click at their faces
---
I really hope so, but how come they don’t know their own game...
---
Borrowed Time, WGLF and MoM and probably We'll Make It will be my go to build for sure.
---
The 16 seconds is like nothing you can still loop him for days.
---
And with Ruin to slow the game down I can't see how he _can't_ win! 😩
---
Maybe it's my ISP or something else, but lately MLGA is useless for me as a killer - in full lobby I see 1 or 2 pings only.
---
I get that they are humans but the thing is they definitely did not test it at all before they rolled it out in the ptb, his power being broken in less than a second from someone slinging their camera around is a very major game breaking bug with him that would take 2 people like 10 seconds to realize if anyone had actually played one match of ghosty. Maybe OoO is supposed to do what it does to him, if so that’s honestly fucking stupid, the fact that one perk would entirely annihilate a killers power should never be a thing, counter and help against a killers power yes that’s the point of perks but completely void a power?
---
Isaac Clarke? I want to see him running around in his high visibility glowing mask and making those glorious echoing death sounds.
---
If one of you has 200+ ping and won't dodge, I will.
---
If one of you has youtube/twitch in a name, and I don't want to be in someone's stream/video, I'll dodge.
---
If I don't want to play against particular items combo, I'll dodge.
---
And by doing this I'll waste more of my time than yours, because for killers wait times are way longer on PC.
---
No real point. I mean if the timer only has a few seconds left I wont get made if they throw me down instead but a full timer instead of a hook is ridiculous.
---
So lying now makes you toxic as fuck? Sensitive one ain't ya. Also from your description it sounds like it was an easy game for them. 
---
what your post should be called is "I get my ass beat in an easy game for survivors then make a reddit post when one of them lies about the basement"
---
Embarrassing.
---
Hey mate I've just woke up. I am fenrirclemo add me please and I'll have a game with you whenever. I'm in the UK so use European servers
---
:(
---
All this rant and you miss the point. No, beta testing is not play testing. Play testing is way before that, to make sure that their ideas on paper actually work. Beta testing should be long after BHVR has already play tested the killer enough to feel confident that he plays well.
---
What? Where? I can't see any link in my message. I'm confused
---
How the fuck do you test what you cannot use
---
I totally understand. It gets sooo old with the Us vs Them mentality this community has, and everyone feeling entitled to escape or get kills. I do agree it's majority survivor though, as a survivor main i've had more survivors curse me out than killers.
---
 Just this week someone on my team was telling me to kms because I pissed them off somehow. I didn't even know what i did and when i asked they just kept calling me all types of dumbass. The other night i tuned into a stream with someone i just played with to catch them shittalking me and calling me an asshole because i took a map from the chest they were going to search. Is it that serious?
---
I love this game so much but the community is making me turn away. It's so hard to have fun now because everyone has a stick up their ass and it's just a constant stream of negativity here.
---
If I see more than 2 flashlights I'm outta there lol
---
I know why. I just don't like how a killer's power lies in the hands of the survivors. It's your power and you should control it.
---
She's not the best killer like on pc, but she's still somewhere above mix tier
---
You said eu/mid it tagged as u/mid
---
I would go for survivors because at max you meet 1 killer a match and you meet either 3 or 4 killers a match.
---
Now I’m wondering do you find T-bagging rude and toxic? If so then survivors are definitely the answer.
---
BHVR should seriously hire u/ImCows and a couple of his friends as playtesters - it would make the quality before relase so much better
---
Ah nice one my dude. Very cool person right here typical reddit user lmfao not surprising, ride the reddit train. Gl in your games rofl. 
---
And yes it does if you are so toxic that you have to make stuff up to feel good and try to make the other player feel bad and spam EZEZEZ that’s toxic. And yes infinite’s are still in the game but they are being fixed according to the dev stream
---
Not on my screen. Maybe I need to edit Eu to EU?
---
That or space it between the / between eu and mid
---
Costumer? Costumer.
---
where is Nea?
---
Oh right......
---
I waited 15 minutes on ps4 to get lobby dodged after 2 seconds. I myself am a killer main and am astounded at the lack of balls on some killers. (Amanda excluded,I understand.
---
Um no every game and movie has some things don't happen in the game/movie. The cashier guy freaking dies in the real world anyway lmao.
---
I think her movement speed definitely should be upped. But that would need some rest design. Or simply changing it to where you don’t walk as slow when holding a Hatchet. 
---
Something should be changed so she’s a better killer. No she’s not bad nor is she amazing unless you spent 500+ hours on her and have amazing throws. 
---
Which I love the skill gap on the huntress she will never be OP but she definitely can be really good with the right person playing her. Like Scot Jund.
---
LOL was there not a struggle stage? Everyone tries to Kobe and immediately dies. Also I kinda like the loud bassy UI sounds like when someone gets sacrificed.
---
Back when it was a meta perk, killers would simply approach survivors without staring directly at them.
---
How do you manage that?  To stay at a certain rank, you have to intentionally play bad or even be afk since pipping is so damn easy... and doing that is just not worth it if the first time you play a game for real you get double pip
---
My man, please stop being such a fucking snowflake. they typed EZZZ and made some shit up you didn't do, so what?? now your feelings are hurt. Grow the fuck up this entire post is pathetic attention seeking.
---
Lmfao you are seeking attention I posted a clip I never said to be toxic an comment on it. Reflect on yourself for a second
---
TWO RANDOS BROUGHT BPS AND THE FUCKING HILLBILLY TUNNELED AND CAMPED ME. I DIED WITH 7K.
---
YOU DESERVED TO GET BULLIED BY THE P3 CLAUDETTE AND FLASHLIGHT NEA FOR DOING THAT TO A BABY DWIGHT.
---
I think it means you need to be closer to the survivors to get you out of it. 
---
Either way you fuck yourself in both situations with a 20 second timer of Exposed. Unless all pallets are destroyed but still.
---
Then you have to work with the annoying, hard and frustrating power.
---
By hard I mean hard to even get it off. Of course until they buff/fix him.
---
Most times you can find a cloaked wraith if the volumes up high enough, but it's still fun looking for bong boy till you run into his invisible body lmao
---
So we get the ability to close the hatch.
---
And then she DOESNT DO IT.
---
Fuckin end me.
---
Meh.
---
:)
---
What’s your in game name?! My friends and I had a wraith do this to us on Tuesday... he had spine chill and we were looking for him
---
I been playing her recently. I'm just getting to the point where I'm really able to get consistant downs with her. In my opinion even with high sensitivity on console some of the hits I get are really just me getting lucky with the auto aim at the end of a phase. Basically if you can get close enough to them with the blink and you happen to being facing them you will get a hit. Going in blind sucks like if you think they are around a corner. A straight shot at someone though it's a very easy hit.
---
I can read those Hiragana and I am proud of myself.
---
Look at her boobs just bouncing
---
Nvmd just saw you’re on Xbox (we’re PC)
---
Well I think he knows some Exposed because right now he’s a m1 killer obviously.
---
With your change he’s a m1 killer that knows where people where. 
---
I don’t know it just seems he needs more power to him which is why I think he needs Exposed status effect. 
---
Typical m1 killers have a hinderance to them if they don’t have a good mobility power. Which is why the top 3 killers all have mobility.
---
Actually not bad, but just wanted to point out the mori flip phone has been changed for a camera (preferred the flip phone tbh)
---
If you look at the top of the sleeves they look burnt. I'm pretty sure the doctor either shocked the living shit out of himself or the wires in his arms vaporized them off.
---
Are you disabled? The definition of reddit: a web content rating and discussion website.  Members can submit content to the site which are then voted on by other members. What are you talking about never asked for comments??? Its your opinion that there toxic.
---
I think it's a sign that Survivors:Killers ratio is skewed from ideal 4:1. If you have 100 survivors and 30 killers there's no way to give everyone fast queues.
---
I wonder if devs will ever implement "give bonuses for playing a role that lacks players" idea that was in one of surveys.
---
My english is awful forgive me. I ment you 99 the gate so EGC timer does not start.
---
You're wrong. RBTs were always inactive until a gen completion. That's why 99%-ing gens is an interesting tactic for swf.
---
The only way to instantly activate RBT was to put it on after gates were powered. That was removed with EGC.
---
Yes that’s a big one. His power is easily and stupidly countered by any and all Detection perks. Which makes him a typical m1 killer with good mms which as we all know isn’t great.
---
as if you have the self confidence to not read everything 5 times over....
---
The Boi himself
---
&gt; skilled billy 
---
That's why "without add-ons" was used, I think. With charge add-ons non-skilled Billy becomes menacing.
---
That's what I end up doing. BT for situations where I am forced to unhook with killer nearby, WMI for normal safe unhooks.
---
I don’t care that they are toxic, lmfao why you looking at clips of dbd in the “shitpost” section if you are gonna whine and complain in the comments like anyone cares what you say... write a book or complain somewhere else, I don’t wanna hear your crying or this other guy who’s writing literal stories in the comment section. I’ll read a short paragraph if you really wanna talk, but this other guy and his novel I can’t bother to read. Reddit incel
---
[Yang Yongxin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Yongxin). A despicable man who subjected countless children to ECT to cure their "game addiction".
---
&gt;Major point here is the Devs don't realise that experienced survivors turn their camera around all the time to be observant while on gens.
---
Oh? Do you remember an old meme from a while back that was essentially "new players" (moving camera around a lot) vs "experienced players" (screen literally only survivor's face)
---
Most commonly, I just stick my camera at one angle where I think the killer may be coming from, then I just hold M1 and browse Reddit on my phone.
---
I agree with this. The developers clearly do not have a QA team, otherwise, clear design flaws or some major bugs wouldn't have slipped past. 
---
I love BHVR and will likely support them in the years to come, but their QA is ass and I always expect major bugs to come with every public update.
---
For the 1000th time they have tried this it was abused by survivors.
---
Maybe if we lived in a perfect world where survivors wouldn't abuse things then maybe you could have this feature but we don't
---
Man, she LOVES to waste pallets does she?
---
Wooooow dudeeee ahah
---
Because I like their perks and I prefer having the whole chapter
---
Wow I never thought about that. This actually makes sense
---
Rank 2 survivor.
---
Hurray, I'm vulnerable
---
Honestly i think this is a cool idea. I've never really cared about what is consider a good killer just the killer themselves, i know people who main freddies and still enjoy the game. it's just all about preference  
---
That being said you could actually implement the exposed status effect into the call itself, forcing the survivors to answer the call basically and be haunted, or risk being instadown. and it wouldn't exactly be op because I'd imagine you'd slowdown or stop when you are going to make the call... so it balances out
---
I still hate getting into chases with leatherface. It's too intense and I simply don't have the skill to get away most times. If they buffed him I cant even imagine the backlash.
---
I JUST EXPERIENCED MY FIRST BODY BLOCKING HOOK STALLING KILLER HELPER. WE NEED TO EITHER PREVENT NAME CHANGES OR BE ABLE TO BLOCK PLAYING WITH PEOPLE. I'M SO SICK OF LOSING GOOD ITEMS FROM STUPID SHIT LIKE MULTIPLE DC'S TANKING ANY CHANCE AND KILLER HELPERS. AT LEAST THE ONES THAT SEEM TO INTENTIONALLY FAIL CHECKS GIVE YOU A CHANCE.  RUNNING AROUND ME WHEN IM WALKING, FLASHING THE LIGHT, FAST VAULTING FOR NO REASON BODY BLOCKING PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE AVOIDED SOME FUCKING HOW. 
---
I WOULD KEEP A LIST OF NAMES TO AVOID IF THEY COULDN'T BE CHANGED. THAT SEEMS LIKE THE EASIEST FIX TO ME. GET IT IMPLEMENTED AND YOUR JOB WITH IT IS DONE. 
---
I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT MOST OF THE TIME I LIKE WHEN A SURVIVOR TEABAGS ME. UNLESS I'M WORKING TOWARDS A DAILY OR USING A GOOD ITEM I WANT TO ENJOY I'LL CAMP THEIR JUVENILE ASSES AND HOPEFULLY TAKE A LONG TIME TO FINISH. IT'S MORE FUN TO LET THE OTHER PEOPLE WIN IF YOU DON'T CARE. THEY STICK AROUND TO WHINE AND I LOVE IT. BE A JERK AND I'LL TREAT YOU LIKE ONE. CRY AFTER ABOUT CHEAPO CAMPING AND THAT'S JUST THE SALT I NEEDED TO BRING THE FLAVOR OUT. I'LL TELL THEM WHY AND LAUGH THEN LEAVE.   IT'S ALL WE CAN DO TO PALLET SAFE TEABAGS BUT I LOVE IT.
---
What even is this reply? It's a weird mix of internet insults and nonsense. You said you want a normal conversation then have one.
---
Your post isn't funny, even some random guy commented meh. It doesn't show any toxicity. All your post shows is salty bitch killer. All your comments show is that you're a salty bitch. Big boy glasses and helmet? What even?  You're like the actual physical representation of a crying internet kid. Stop. 
---
What does my game knowledge of dbd have to do with anything? You dont need to play the game to see your  being a bitch. Anyone from any game ever could read the chat and see youre just salty you lost.
---
No one is crying. You're just being put in your place for being pathetic. 
---
Go cry to my father? Man come on. You wanna say I am embarrassing and you hit me with that. Its just getting sad now.
---
How about the stalk is only if you running and looking into the direction of the killer the same time and only the target and not other survivor can cancel it
---
60% of killers, about 50% killers, and 90% of redditors
---
I mean there intention  was for her to be a larger lady. naturally they wouldn't make the hit box larger or any of that because no one would play her.
---
Why not have 3 killers in 1? Purchase a Freddy at your local Entity-mart
---
Jesus, honestly I would’ve quit dbd for awhile after that.
---
I  enjoy playing both but I guess its hard to have the best of both worlds.
---
That could work, but it would just make it so survivors would just constantly answer calls thou without worry.   
---
Could probs do an ultra-rare addon that causes the clone to actually deal damage to survivors aha, that would make him truly terrifying
---
Claudette's looks so bad, I'm kinda pissed about it.
---
The DbD community has always preferred bitching and complaining over praising and it will always stay that way.
---
It’s most notable when you play with her imo.
---
they're not talking about their own achievements though. like how they play. They're talking about overall player statistics. y'know, the developers WOULD have access to that. I'm inclined to believe straight up factual numbers more than heresay
---
So, in her lore, the plague that people get kills them.  So, what if, once you became broken, you had a timer start (maybe two minutes or so), and if that timer reaches its end, you get knocked into the dying state? Also, make it like other effects where it doesn't tick while in a chase.
---
That way, it pressures survivors to cleanse, though they can wait for a while before having to do so, so she's not ALWAYS getting it, and it lets the plague use her corrupt purge power more often.
---
Honestly, I rarely see her, so I don't really have a great idea of how this would actually play out in matches (making them better or worse), but it feels like a good compromise, in that her power isn't restricted by the survivor's decisions, and the pressure on survivors isn't so great that they have to cleanse immediately. They could even get into chases to buy more time.
---
Or maybe she was going to drop you onto it.
---
Self-fulfilling prophecy, aka a groundwork for breeding more toxicity.
---
Lobby dodging should have an increasing time out on creating lobby’s maxing at 30 minutes imo. 
---
It’s entitlement to what match you think you should play, most survivors with flashlights are absolute dogshit at saves, blinding at pallets is annoying but ultimately worthless as most killers can detect where the survivor is going with sounds. 
---
Toolboxes are an issue for speedy games, yes but you can alter your build to have gen’s slowing. 
---
I just don’t get the constant dodging but thats my opinion.
---
Yikes I like what they’re going for, probably to make hair flow more realistically, but yikes. Nonetheless I think Fengs hair looks much better however.
---
Glorious

There's a difference between QA testing and 5 devs taking 30 minutes to do a very simple test on if the power works and any major obvious bugs like the borderline game-breaking bugs found in the ptb. Questions like, "does the power work on a fundamental level?" "Is the programming we've implemented for this killer working on a basic level?" Is not a large comprehensive test that needs to be done by QA testers. They don't even need to be probing for bugs and crashes and the like which is normally what QA teams do (and what the ptb is kinda doing instead). All they need to do is have a single in-house with a couple of the gameplay programmers and see "oh, thats not right" and if they cant fix it before ptb just be real with people. Come out and say "look right now theres a game-breaking bug with ghostface and we need to fix it, ptb will be delayed for, idk, a week, a few days, whatever." These current shanigans of just releasing it clearly broken without seemingly a single match having been played is unacceptable. You cannot say that "this is what the ptb is for." The PTB serves a number of purposes but if the PTBs purpose is for everyone to get on, play a single match against the new killer and realize he is fundamentally borked then immediately uninstall the PTB,  then bhvr seriously needs to rework the idea of what a PTB is for. Because thats what the current ptb is and ya know I wish we could instead be testing other interactions and how we feel about the killers abilities and addons and such but instead we dont even get to play the killer or see how they perform, because the devs decided to push the ptb despite GF being 100% broken. And I'm not blaming individual devs, all of the devs I've talked to are really cool and I'm sure do their best. My issue is with the higher-ups and likely marketing team, suits who arent actually involved in the game, making an understandable call to release it broken but still a call I strongly disagree with.
---
I Main Kate and Jeff. Don't tell her, but I like him more, even if he's louder and bigger. He gives me bro vibes &lt;3
---
Nurse. No cap
---
That's actually not a bad idea either, have it so that they get exhausted if they don't answer the phone, but in that case, answering the phone can't be too op either. like choosing between exhaustion for not answering or exposed for answering would be bit op, unless they decrease the time you are exposed when answering the call maybe
---
Yep, playing Killer is a pain until you reach a level where you can reliably slap around non-SWFs.
---
And recognize SWFs fast enough to stop caring about the game's outcome.
---
All you need is survivors who are not doing the objective while you don’t tunnel
---
You might get lazy like this when you know it's a normal terror radius killer and there's only one angle of approach, but if it's Myers or Pig or something, you're more alert.
---
I too am disappointing
---
I guess you are right, there is a solution in this response to playing killer and enjoying it. Accepting that this is just a part of the game and maybe just closing the lobby when I see survivors beginning to be toxic.
---
Its hard to not want to try talk with the survivors to try change their mind but I guess that just makes things worse.
---
Don’t forget that you meet 3/4 survivors and 0/1 killers every game. You just see more survivors
---
Ari Ari ari Ari Ari ari Ari Ari ari Ari Ari ari Ari Ari ari ***[arrivederci]***

It’s a test build. Understand what that means?

So we’re just not gonna mention the tiddys ok

A pig that can't crouch when someone looks at her... oh wait

Exactly, who dodged lonbies?
---
I wanna play everyone but I hate not having perks I need a 2x bp weekend ahah
---
Does it not bother you that the hair clips with the top tho?

Just give him haste when he has progress on stalk and add exahstion in addition to exposed on the survivors marked.

See I am the other way I think DS is in a better place now than it was. I never used it prior because, personally as a killer, it was frustrating catching people and they just escape and although you can catch them if they are good at looping they wasted so much time. Now I much prefer it and think its more balanced because it doesn't eat into what little time a killer has, doesn't just gift a free escape but it stops killers tunneling and is still useful.
---
Honestly doesn't seem like anyone on this sub does
---
Imagine being bad at the game, and then spouting your bad opinions online, embarrassing
---
You play, realize he is not good and the devs see that he has problems and then they fix them before releasing him. They already announced they are aware of the problems.
---
If you think about it, virtually none of the white characters are represented in a good light.
---
Nodding killers are so annoying. It's always the ones who are shit in the chase as well
---
Literally a few days ago they praised the devs and now they are shitting on them again. This sub is suck a circlejerk.
---
Hillbilly is "rarely used at high ranks"? Lolwut?
---
At the same time, I paid for the game, so did that squadette, if they want to flashlight BM me all game and do ochido style disconnects, that's their choice, it's also my choice to be a total and complete bastard, if I want to camp cuz I saw your SWF behind that tree, I'm gonna do it, and once you turn off messages and you no longer get the salt mail, it's not that bad
---
"Survivors escape too much! Give us data so I can prove it!"  
---
*Devs give data showing only a 48% escape rate*  
---
"That's not the result I wanted! I don't believe you! I know more than the devs!"
---
Tbh SWF are usually ultra-altruistic morons who hook dive and waste pallets. Except in high ranks.
---
i think you’re confused. imagine that the spirit, on the ptb, couldn’t use her phase. she was just completely visible the whole time. then, the devs ask what you think about her power and what should be changed. you can’t tell them because you’ve never used the power as it was meant to be used. all the feedback and info from the two weeks of ptb is utterly useless because we can’t see the power in action. 
---
ghostface’s power might be great! the problem isn’t that he’s weak (like pig or wraith). the problem is that his core mechanic doesn’t work AT ALL.
---
How? What’s wrong with Kate?
---
So basically turn it into a worse version of Devour Hope?
---
I'm main survivor but I bought Myer's chapter and I'm planning to buy GF's too. I see a lot of people playing Ash, which is a payed surv (that I didn't buy).
---
But, you know, it's a pointless discussion since neither of us have real data on this. Thanks for the answer!
---
I actually want Tabula Rasa. The game needs more interactive perks.
---
TBF the only killer that is simply not being fun to play against is nurse. and that is because she ignores everything that makes you a better survivor than low rank survivors. and "just get good" doesnt apply to killers with 5k+ hours 80% of that on nurse with strong addons, slug builds, moris. Period. Fix nurse and buff other killers and the survivors who still would be cry babies can just be ignored. But tbh all the surv mains I know are pretty chill but just SO tired of playing nurse all day  the other big part what makes being a survivor shit are desync hits and BHVR works on them already.
---
The obsessions player model should always turn into the good version of her.
---
you do realise that gives you a greater chance to catch them right? Instead of being 10 metres away from you ready to loop you at the next pallet they wasted their time to taunt you and you fell for it lmfao
---
No he is ABC out of map tier
---
No, you are the incredibly naive one here. It literally only takes QA to play ONE match, then test Ghostface powers, then have them survivors POINT the camera to Ghostface for 0.1 secs while he is using his power. Boom. Bug detected.
---
TBF I wanna actually play the game.
---
If this all happens over again I'm seriously just gonna drop the game tbh.

OOF well at least you tried to offer advice to them.
---
prove it baddie
---
Wazzaaa
---
Who was the killer? I'm pretty damn curious and I mean what do you really expect from the PS4 part of the community
---
yes but shouldn't survivors be able to try killers out before purchasing them to see how they play?
---
getting chased while injured is still easier than dealing with corrupt purge, thats all i was saying
---
How exactly do you know the killer dcd purposely?
---
why survivors?
---
i actually see prestiged Tapps more than i see regular Tapps lol
---
Lobby dodging is fine.
---
I really don't get the entitlement on that one, people aren't obliged to play with you for whatever reason they choose and don't have to justify anything (maybe they hate flashlights, maybe the whole team is P3 Claudettes that have a massive and unintended advantage of being hard to see, maybe one player has awful ping, etc). You aren't even losing out on much, just go read a book or do whatever other hobby you have other than DBD.
---
I also don't get most of the DC hate. It's  a videogame and most players don't browse this subreddit and post in Facebook groups so probably don't know/care about these "DC rules" and just play on regardless. Sure if someone is toxic all game then they DC just before the final hook, or they get downed and DC immediately that's bad, but Jesus it doesn't seem like this community "tolerates" disconnecting from a game that's going to last 15 minutes at most for any reason whatsoever. Apparently that phonecall/doorbell/food in the oven that's beginning to burn near endgame/random emergency can go fuck itself.
---
True but I mean you can earn them without spending money for them while the others can't also this does bring to question will Ghostface have a fragment for his chapter or not because he is technically a original killer just with the mask.
---
What's a Claudette?
---
Damn this guy makes Legion mains look all bad.....
---
A rework I liked was hexes would have TWO totems associated to them, both needing to be cleansed before the hex breaks. With a rebalancing of a few minor things like cleansing time, and Thrill o Hunt, I'd like it even as a survivor!
---
Well I highly highly doubt, 4 survivor Offerings were used and he magically ended up lagging out. It’s more likely that it was a purposeful disconnect.
---
He is definitely a licensed killer.
---
What does it say?
---
I would say 4k but 3k is in the middle so do that as I'm slightly merciful
---
Brilliant_Vegetable is definitely autistic, but we've seen new killers dominate the rankings for a while every time they release a killer. It takes time for players to learn and implement effective counters. Give it a few more months and it'll probably even out.
---
Instadown killers do very well accross all ranks anyway, Leatherface ranks much higher than people give him credit for.
---

If we can see Fun World mentioned in trailer, they 100% get some money from this DLC. And I doubt they'd agree to get a percentage of your shards.
---
Found the bubba
---
True but we will just have to wait to find out.
---
you got it
---
Hey look buddy, im a noob, this mean, i dont solve pratical problems
---
Man, this really adds to the bubba stereotype. The player really connects with the killer due to low braincell count, lol.
---
But when anyone disconnects on the loading screen now the game doesn't start and it sends everyone back without using anything.
---
3 people prestiged, BPS’ popped, it was clear he ran away after seeing he could make us waste valuable offerings
---
This way of addressing the "people don't cleanse" issue has been suggested from the very beginning, and BHVR did apparently internally test it in the initial designing process to start with. It was just deemed to be too oppressive, which is the same reason why they undid the proposed Thanatophobia change.
---
Whether it actually is too oppressive is another question (current-Thanatophobia is basically useless, anyway), but I doubt BHVR will reconsider on this idea, especially because it is indeed boring to simply reduce gen speeds and such.
---
Add-ons that apply various status effects such as Blindess, Exhaustion, Hindered, etc. to fully-infected survivors could be one thing they can do. Another idea would be to make it matter when survivors puke. It could reveal their aura briefly, or cause them to cancel interactions for the duration of the animation, halting gen progress a little, potentially making them miss skill checks, or delaying their ability to interact with pallets and windows in chases, as well as interrupting flashlights and so on. The only thing that would be somewhat undesirable about that is the RNG factor of it, but then again, RNG is a pretty core mechanic of DbD gameplay.
---
Yep tell me if it's fun and challenging because I've always been tempted to try it.
---
They did say that, i will try to find a link to it hold up. Just turning ur camera is not supposed to work and it should be a whole second of you looking at him should break his power.
---
I play spirit and tbh, that's fair lol. Didn't read her Lord for month once I got her.
---
they are an easter egg for some streamers I believe
---
I recently had a game where the killer was afk as wraith. Didn't see him at all for most of the match and then when he finally did return he went straight into killing like nothing had happened. Just a reminder that even tryhard killers need toilet breaks.
---
*Clown moris him*
---
Hey Vsauce! Where is your finger?

wraith is like the best killer for this I see ppl do it all the time to derank lol

This is nonsense, and easily falsifiable. If you have PGTW and you kick a gen that has &lt;25% progression, it'll turn off entirely.

If its endgame collapse and they are slugged, best believe they are gonna wait for the timer. Likewise i teabag them as trapper with my traps :)

Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught and killed. This is from the Dead by Daylight website, note the part that says “survivors, trying to *escape* the killer and avoid being caught and killed. You should pip if you survive no matter what
---
No i think it's funny. It's the only satisfaction i get after all four survivors run mom and adrenaline
---
Both are toxic but i say killers for the sheer amount of entitlement for a kill. Or when you run them for too long you end up being tunneled and camp. And toxic survivors dont really have a big impact on a game like a killer does.
---
Woah there buddy.. Let's not use the L-word needlessly and cause others distress like that.
---
i imagined this in the voice in saminations video for jane
---
White noise 2 would be good
---
They most likely meant that spinning the camera shouldn't work, not that the character has to face them AKA the camera has to stay on them for a second
---
A STUPID MEG ENDED UP STOP MOVING ON A LOOP THEN THE KILLER LAGSWITCHED, CAUSING ME TO GO DOWN AS HE CHASED AFTER HER AND JEFF, THEY DIED AND I CRAWLED AWAY AND ADRENALINE ACTIVATED, BUT THE KILLER UNCROUCHED AND DOWNED ME AGAIN, TBAGGING AND SAYING “EZ” IN CHAT AFTER HE LUCKED INTO THAT KILL.
---
Refreshing? If I am to be chased around the map for the whole game and die after all gens have been done 9/10 times you will get bronze in unbroken and 10/10 you won’t pip. Even if you didn’t want to be chased, if you survive for five minutes straight in a chase the killer will just want to kill you so as soon as you’re caught you’re not getting saved.
---
Because half of the time even if you get chased for 3 minutes straight you will only get gold on evader.
---

It just comes from wanting to mix things up. I enjoy the game, but I don't play very often so BBQ and Chilli is a must for bloodpoints, and it gets boring just running Spirit Fury/Enduring/Ruin over and over.
---
I figured it's normal to wait at the exit gate in case some other survivor gets hooked.  I'll leave as soon as I'm the last one, or when there's no chance to rescue a late hook
---
No, he's basing his opinion on his own experience and from opinions of others.
---
And you don't see how biased this statement is and how it falls in the us vs them category? They don't make weak killers on purpose, the killer is actually currently not working as it should, so there is nothing to do between this "fact" you pulled out of nowhere as the other guy mentioned and why the killer sucks.
---
Lol the state of this community, full of the most spite-filled people I’ve ever had the misfortune to come into contact with.
---
&gt; Countless times terrible killers get 2-3 kills just cuz of noed. 
---
Coutnless times killers get 2-3kills just because of terrible survivors who don't know how to deal with NOED.

I fixed it for you.

ngl Head-On is the most rewarding perk if you can use it
---
PTB is the *final test*, this comes off like the devs dident even test him once in QA.
---
Thanks for the info
---
I doubt those numbers will change. I imagine they'll decrease the base spotting range to 24m (unless add-ons would end up becoming too op) and increase the time to spot to 2-3 seconds.

What would we have done if he did not tell us?

It only works now if you get downed 60 seconds after getting unhooked

Puppers prides himself on looking like Dweard, so, I don’t see how Dwight is “ugly.”  Puppers himself ended up looking 10 years younger when he changed his hair to look like Dweard.

At least tag it as a Shitpost or spoiler so people don't have to sift through it.

They should put a thong skin on myers
---
Basically just run every m1 killer build of Ruin, BBQ, Enduring, SF
---
Legion is pretty bad. They get free pips though.
---
David
---
Yeah I also think that BPs are very hard to get on the survivor side, so I usually let people get lots of points, unless they behave like dicks, especially towards other survivors.
---
The observer? Can I have a quick rundown
---
I usually start the round off by puking on my Ruin. Then I will not puke on anything other than survivors and intermittently Ruin again. That way I can often tell if someone is attempting to cleanse Ruin, due to them becoming infected doing so, which allows me to keep Ruin alive into the mid game more consistently. This obviously only works until too many survivors are infected for you to be able to identify that they are interacting with your Hex.
---
Personally I just chase survivors and usually stick to a hook-it-and-book-it playstyle, and don't mind if I then don't 4k, because I play for the chases. One thing of note however is that I regularly use Play With Your Food on Plague, since Vile Purge does not consume tokens and therefore allows you to easily injure survivors with it - then only needing one hit to down them, which is, only one token. So my playstyle is interrupted by farming tokens from the Obsession. It's really a rather viable perk pick on Plague (I pair it up with BBQ, Brutal Strength and Ruin). Going for available Corrupt Purge is something generally situational, where the location of the corrupted pool and the current state of the game dictate if and when going for it is most valuable, so there's no clear guide to make that decision. Usually you will want to wait until multiple if not all survivors are infected, since at that point going Corrupt may result in them preemptively cleansing as well. Since Corrupt Purge does consume PWYF tokens, I will usually not go for it if I still have tokens, unless many of the survivors are already infected/injured.
---
If you do care about the 4k, tunnelling, camping and slugging are the strategies you want to (ab)use. Plague is a capable tunneller since the tunnelled survivor cannot get healed, and other survivors only have limited means to interrupt your tunnel, as you can just puke on them without losing much of any distance on your priority target. Camping is also an especially strong strategy on Plague, since survivors will often be infected and therefore injured, rendering them effectively unable to save if you're around. So they either have to cleanse or risk getting downed trying to save - and even if they do cleanse, you could still potentially Vile-into-hit down them before they are able to save, or manage to get Corrupt to punish them around the hook. Slugging is just something that is sometimes opportune to do to create more pressure and winnable situations, and Plague has some slugging utility as part of her kit, in as much as you can spot slugged survivors a little easier with the infection visuals, and as you can sometimes tell if a slugged survivor is being interacted with, due to another survivor getting infected in the process. Perk choices would still be mostly the same, though I would replace Brutal and PWYF with Enduring and Spirit Fury, since tunnelling means you are going to eat Decisive Strikes. While Thanatophobia might make some people cleanse, anybody that understands the game will not, since Thana's numbers are negligible. Even Stridor or Bloodhound are better perks to capitalize on survivors being injured, in comparison.
---
I mean the mechanic does work, I have marked plenty of targets with the stalk. It just gets broken out too easy
---
how was that Nea called? so i can lobby dodge that bitch before she screw us all with her "big plays"
---
Never said it was?
---
Peanits said the current spotting system is bugged. Until that's fixed, we have no idea how strong or weak he *actually* is.
---
Whenever a Hag puts me in the basement I pretty much consider that to be game over. They almost always put a trap next to you and like 2-4 on the stairs or shack which can easily counter borrowed time or dead hard.
---
Toxic as fuck.
---
If you are not in the ptb, just so you know, they look a LOT better ingame.  They look very grainy in these photos, but look better ingame.
---
The fatigue is just too long. Cool down legion was the most fun way to play before the rework and now they're just sluggish in every way. It's just disappointing for a character who's fantasy is being agile.
---
If we are talking bout his stealth being broken by camera spinning, that is 100% being fixed before release....now his shitty weak power, thats another story.
---
Idk man infinite tier 3 myers with STBFL is pretty strong.
---
Once again, Meg’s Red Hair looks better ingame, the ptb is stuck rendering everything low
---
Go ahead! It’s done by twitter artist @vghu780 :)

The guy who owns the archives, the new challenge section coming soon
---
Huntress main here, personally I don't feel much needs to be done honestly. Her hatchets are pretty powerful, if anything maybe an increase to her lunge range or a faster full charge time to the hatchets. But I really don't feel it, I can pretty reliably get 3-4 kills every game.
---
Small brain nurse main
---
Yeah, it looks like a paper mache wig now
---
Its all fun and games until someone gets hit
---
I think a lot of people fail to realise that there is an amount of luck when you decide which direction to go trying to loop or deceive the killer. Sometimes doubling back saves your bacon sometimes you get squashed. People are different and do different things and prioritize differently.
---
Nope. Its wanker
---
Or maybe wraith was just camping and Ace decided to go for the unhook,
---
OP MADE A HIGHER QUALITY REPOST, CHECK IT OUT, THE RENDERING WAS TAKEN CARE OF
---
[deleted]
---
Then you run in with problems with The Face and The Shape. Just sound wrong
---
Tier 3 myers with everybody in the basement = 4k
---
Did you not read? I conceded the fact that they missed the bug. I’m not sure what more you fucking want from me dude. I’m defending the fact that just because a bug is missed doesn’t mean there’s no QA. I’ve literally been in QA for games before - I know how the process works.
---
You’re misinterpreting those comments, they’re about the bug where GF’s power gets cancelled immediately upon being looked at when it’s supposed to require looking at him for a full second. Thus, survivors can negate GF completely by quickly spinning their camera around, which they’re not supposed to do.
---
Is the aura still revealed ?
---
a wraith that can't becomes visible the second someone looks at him... Hang on a second...
---
So you start in the whole Us vs them mentality, taking a stance and attacking a side but are surprised when people call you out on that? You deserve it, that's just it.
---
Nothing like sweaty red rank builds in the morning
---
Yeah I am aware of that, how is that not related to this discussion? 
---
Thats literally the reason that GF isnt worth shit at the moment is that survivors glance near him and he gets his ability broken.
---
Just remember! For every few toxic players who don't appreciate your fairness, there absolutely is a few more players who tried to play as fairly as you!
---
And who definitely noticed that you could have simply returned to a hook and downed that poor dwight. Guarenteed there are survivors who felt that instant switch of emotions when you dropped them on the hatch rather than hooked in front of the gates and continuously hit over and over, because it was a fun game. 
---
We notice! And thank you for playing in a way that encourages others to play just as fairly. The negative often overshadows everything else. But remember there are players who simply want a fair/fun game just like you!
---
Lmao isn’t that gonna suck for me?
---
Actually if you host and we are survivors that may be a good thing
---
Kate’s might be at risk but if you see a P3 Kate people either dodge or are in for one hell of a ride
---
what is deathgarden lol
---
I only play Kate because of her hair - she was the first character to by default have floaty hair it was amazing at the time
---
There was no massive nerf, he just had a minor nerf at the same time everyone started to realise how easily counterable he was.
---
Bond, Decisive Strike, Pop Goes the Weasel and Overwhelming Presence
---
In every game I ever played with online features ever.
---
Thanks :)
---
Everything looks like an improvement aside from Claudette. Don't fix what's not broken. The hair looked fine before.
---
Had something similar happen to me. I was playing on Freddy's map and this Hillbilly was patrolling me after he hooked me for the first time.
---
I gave him a snarky remark via message telling him to get some smores if he's gonna be camping for that long.
---
I then tried to explain to him why he shouldn't camp (blood point loss, getting reported for it, etc) I kid you not he messaged back.
---
"Idc I got my rank up." and he also said "then why don't the dev's implement something to hinder killers from camping"
---
Least to say it ruined my night. Was I salty? Yeah. But people really should understand that camping gets you nowhere.
---
I think this guy brought Legion by mistake instead of Bubba xD
---
Thank you my friend.
---
What do you mean by farmer?
---
Pebble is always top tier for me
---
i do as well and everyone's griping
---
Why should you make the mist thicker? Thats only helping the survivors for better hiding right? OP doesnt have the "see through walls" add-on equiped
---
Amen. DbD was designed around 1 killer vs 4 uncoordinated survivors.
---
Peer pressuring the devs into adding SWF (which was explicitly not added initially, with devs saying it would not work out for these very reasons) was the worst thing that has happened to this game... albeit it likely is the only reason the game got enough players to survive in first place, too.
---
I await a counter argument, until then gibs me the downvotes
---
You only use the bloodpoints to get better perks to replace wglf with
---
Oh okay, so you’re just stating the obvious that everyone already knows, like an idiot. Cool. Bye, hope you stay mad at the world.
---
It's almost as if we like it when they add new mechanics 🤔
---
What perks did you use?
---
But she can suffer from the lightburn effect, even if it's hard to get it
---
Yeah the killer get abused in higher ranks
---
I'd argue Trapper is on par with Hag, particularly with Windows near the entrance
---
Agreed, I expect 1 or 2 changes that do jack shit before he actually releases. We'll have to wait a few months until they actually change him (all in one patch ofc, because doing a stream of consistant changes totally isn't easier to balance,less annoying to the community and better for the actual balance)
---
I find that most of these look worse. Meg's might look more like actual hair, but they also look shaggy. Then again, it suits the Collection theme it came with. Nea's green hair has apparently lost the streaks and waves, though the dreads do look more believable. I think with Claudette the image speaks for itself. Feng's hair looks fuller, but not only was it kinda cute how her ear poked through a little, but now it looks almost too full, like a helmet. Kate has lost her curls in favor of something that looks as if she stood in the wind for a prolonged period of time. I prefer the silhouette of Jake's medium-long, streaky hair over the new long hair version that also seems a little too full.
---
I don't mind these changes too much, or most of any cosmetic changes for that matter, but I guess I don't get why they went and worked on these when there were no real complaints about them that I'd have seen, and when whether these changes actually constitute an improvement is debatable.
---
You took the words out of my mouth. All these dumb things wouldve been found so quickly and easily if they actually play tested him prior to putting him on the ptb, or they literally just dont care.
---
AFTER HITTING 100 HOURS IN THE GAME I EXPERIENCED MY FIRST EVER CRASH WHILE LOADING INTO A MATCH WHERE TWO SURVIVORS BROUGHT BPS AND I BROUGHT SURVIVOR PUDDING WHILE USING BBQ. I PRIMARILY PLAY FOR BLOOD POINTS TO GET THE PERKS I NEED FOR PROPER BUILDS AND WAS ROBBED OF A 5X BLOODPOINTS MATCH
---
It would be fun for a killer, I agree. Not sure about survivor
---
I'd put Iron Will way higher, had so many good laughs because the killer just kept on running because he couldn't hear me.
---
I am in love.
---
There are two types of Spirits out there. The first type, saw the Prayer Beads and decided it would be cool to get some free gen grabs. And they do get free gen grabs, but as soon as they're in a chase it becomes clear they never bothered to learn the killer and be creative with her. They have no idea of her true potential.   
---
The other types are the real Spirits. People of high culture, class, sophistication and integrity. They would never camp a hook or use NOED, it's like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the garage for eternity. Only the lowest of the low would do that, like the first type which you seem to be encountering sadly.
---
They teabag the instant they feel safe for a second i'm liable to hook and camp. We can't do anything else to discourage it so i'll take a 1K if I have to. Then it gets salty and it's more amusing knowing they got upset when they were trying to upset me. I've only got 3 total characters to 20-25 so far and I'm already jaded enough against them to be happy to sacrifice a decent game to do that. Maybe I'm just vindictive.
---
I disagree. He can destroy loops just with the bottle. The bottle can make good loops into bad ones especially with the Bleach add ons looping is your bitch. I also think he can make saving people horrible because he can probably down the unhooker and the unhooked if the person playing uses him correctly. Also he can negate some exhaustion perks with the gas like lithe or Sprint Burst. Then again I could just be going against bad survivors
---
Exactly. You dont even need to load up all your traps around the basement like a lot of people think you do. If you know what youre doing, you can cause complete mayhem with just 2 to 3.
---
It's the other way around for Russian players. They stay still while the killer is near, and wiggling means it's safe to go get them. It's hella confusing for us Europeans as we almost always get matched with Russians.
---
You probably already know or have it,but there is one for myers, i have one of him but if your referring to BHVR's killers then yeah i wish they would
---
When you unhook a person without caring what'll happen next (person will be hit and put back on a hook almost immediately), because all you care about is bloodpoints, that's called farming.
---
Clip is too short to accuse Wraith, at least (I can't remember right now if farming is reportable)
---
Don't know about the gen grabs but yea they're not at all creative, just basically playing a better wraith giving us no head start but basically an M1 killer.
---
You do understand that the PTB is not first testing right? PTB stands for Public Test Build, meaning that there *should* have already been a **Private** Test Build but it's shocking that ghost faces problems were not noticed in the private testing.
---
I always thought it was because the entity has a hard time keeping the different areas seperated and some mesh in at some points.
---
1 next to hook, one on the stair corner &amp; one on top of stairs. All you need, unless your using scarred hand of course ;p
---
Monto has blessed you
---
I know, I don't get why people are so fine with ruining games for people.
---
Wrong flair
---
Either the survivors play a whole game with No Mither or she has hatchets with way bigger hitboxes. She is at least stronger than Michael and Leatherface
---
I SPENT MONEY ON COSMETICS TO FIND A LITTLE JOY INTO THIS FUCKED GAME AND NOW THEY LOOK LIKE SHIT. YES, I KNOW IT'S ONLY ON LOW QUALITY BUT THAT'S ALL I CAN DO WITHOUT GETTING LAGGY SKILLCHECKS. I DON'T WANT THE HAIR I FUCKING BOUGHT CAUSE IT WAS SMOOTH AND FLOWY TO LOOK LIKE FUCKING PLAYDOH!!
---
Thank you for making me smile :)
---
People need to understand that the End Game Changes combine with pre "nerf" is just dirty. If you save a rbt and bring noed you can confirm a kill at end game no matter what. You could outplay a pig all game but if you got down at the end game you get absolutely NO recourse because now you're fighting against two timers that WILL kill you, at the end of the game
---
That's literally just a free kill because you saved a bear trap. That just wasn't the way pig was meant to be played and the devs even said that outright. Reverse bear traps aren't supposed to kill. They're supposed to occupy. 
---
It was already super powerful to be able to do that anyway because big brain pig mains could just apply the bear trap and patrol boxes for a guaranteed sacrifice anyway. But that combine with EGC means you don't have to guard the boxes and can still try and hunt survivors without worrying about that other guy removing his box because he's practically dead anyway. GG.
---
Pretty rare for this game
---
Is this real? Cause I dont remember this episode.
---
and that's bad because why? more bloodpoints is always nice.
---
Claudette! Get the people off the hook! Oh no... She has dicks in her ears! She can't hear us!
---
I’ve never found clown to be that good. He’s not bad by any means, but he’s not that good. The main thing is his extreme lack of map pressure.
---
They're just making sure that they have plenty of "content" for their future roadmap lol.

---
Not sure if you know this or not but that’s an actual fetish don’t ask how I know this.
---
"We've won". So you are implying you are playing swf basically making the game easier if I'm not wrong. Honestly yes I do believe that whole argument is bad but honestly Clown make lack map pressure but since he can end loops pretty damn quickly it makes up for that plus with the One shot add on he can wipe a team pretty easily.
---
I'd say her speed is 110. Unless I wanted to try to be unique and go for 112. Having a lunge that survivors really cant 360 seems a bit powerful to also be 115. 
---
I agree with most of your changes, but I dont think being able to pick yourself up a whole bunch is too OP when it only removes 1 token. If mew manage to do so, the Killer is making a mistake now. You'll most likely only get one use or maybe two(if the killer suspects unbreakable) before the killer stops slugging you. 
---
And for observant having too many variables. If it was cannon, it definetly would. Sadly these things will never be cannon and that doesnt really need changed too much in my opinion. 
---
And for Beastial, it seems strong at first. But mew need to remember that mew cant down anyone without losing part of beastial presence. Maybe mew could increase the needed tokens for it to be non existent, but otherwise I dont see it to be too overpowered compared to other cannon perks
---
Thank mew for the very constructive criticism. I'll be sure to take these points into mind when trying to make another one
---
So you have the answer. Truth is you can do well with him even if higher ranks provided survivors really fck up.

You’re from the past?
---
We had a little chat about Doctor :P
---
I feel you as a killer main myself. The new MoM on the ptb would make me quit for real if it comes live. Hopefully it wont. But the fact that red ranks is full of instaheals/stacked second chance perks used by bm’ming survivors that complain about the only killers who have a slight chance against them is ridiculous.
---
Also what is Botanys max healing speed?
---
Nurse is OP even without perks xd
---
That’s not how you play hag
---
I never said anything about SWF. Hell, I don’t even have friends to play DBD with. I say “we’ve won” as the survivors in general. There are so many factors to winning a game it’s not as simple as “This killer is bad so they do bad all the time” 
---
I don’t think effectiveness should discourage you from playing a killer. I play Freddy, and soon to be Ghostface, because they are fun, not because they are good. Don’t let tier lists discourage you from playing clown though.
---
What an asshole
---
#Entity Displeased
---
Well, thats tachnically not using the perk. Using it would mean getting the stun off, which is amazing if the killers doesn't expect it.
---
This is always what ive said. I dont understand how someone can only play one side, ever. Playing one side helps you get better at the other.
---
200 meters is bigger than any map in the game ;)  Empathy has 128m radius and it's still bigger than any map. And BBQ doesn't have any range. Well, it has, you can see ppl who are further than 40m away from you.
---
I know what you mean brother
---
What language is it exactly?
---
Japanese.
---
Well, it's better than some other killers' powers, that's true.
---
All the other changes look good but this one.  I never ever ever would have spent the money I did on the hair they are changing it to.
---
the 90 degree billy flick around the shack gets so many people its amazing
---
But LF isn't free, so most of newer players aren't gonna play him anyway. That makes no sense.
---
Things can snowball anyway for example hooking two people who've already been hooked, either they die or they get rescued
---
nah fam it's all compliments
---
It is one killer and 4 survivors. Not everyone is gonna survive yet you still have a chance to earn bloodpoints to get more perks.
---
Play as the killers you have a hard time with and learn the game in their perspective so you can capitalize on your gained knowledge by surviving easier.
---
Double pip with farming perks. That's good (/) (°,,°) (/)
---
Knifing someone constantly on hook is quite alarming to me. yes i know its a game but we r humans and empathy its a key component in our lives. I believe the game just exposed a potential future sociopath and who knows whats next...
---
Totally agree. Also the always-present voices that call everything "shit" or only talk in superlatives ("most horrible", "most broken", "worst thing") as if they're frothing at the mouth... yet they still continue playing. Baffles the mind.
---
Because until the Pig *finally* gets a buff to compensate for the massive nerf they thrust upon her it must never be forgotten.
---
A lot of people don't use his bottles correctly. I notice a lot of Clowns attempt to throw bottles too early or too late or even just waste them straight up. You have to gas an early part of the loop. If the loop has a tree or wall use throw it high to spread more everywhere.
---
Clown is extremely strong in the shack and T and L walls if they know how to run them. Most Clowns I face screw up even the T and L walls which is a free hit/down no matter what. Learning how to run tiles and where and when to throw bottles is what will separate a good Clown from a bad one.
---
The yellow feather add-on is also something I don't see used much. It gives Clown much less penalty for throwing a bottle and it has given me hits I would've missed otherwise.
---
Lastly I see tons of Clowns not even charge the bottle. I see them throw it very soon and they end up missing the survivor or hitting a wall. Just charge it up a little before throwing and aim down a little to work with the trejactory.
---
make the tornado being chased for 20 minutes and we got our selves an agreement

You said he ugly though

Most killers wont change the target. Tried this many times with Bond ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Depending on you loadout, I'd say either Doctor or hag

Doing gens, you?

I rank him lower for two reasons primarily:
---
1) His main strength is to shut down loopers, which I never relied on to stay alive and after the Halloween (?) update looping isnt nearly as much of a problem for killers.
---
2) Out of all the killers I think I personally have the best survival rate against the clown

Developer: *creates a test environment for bug fixing and tweaks so products can be as good as possible on official launch*
---
Community: **WOW OK I CAN’T BELIEVE THEY DIDN’T FIND THESE BUGS BEFORE THEY PUT IT ONTO THE THING TO FIX BUGS!¡!¡1! IT’S NOT LIKE RANDOM BUGS AND ISSUES CAN APPEAR WHEN TRANSFERRING THE GAME FROM AN INTERNALISED TEST BUILD TO A PUBLIC TEST BUILD OR ANYTHING, THE DEVS ARE JUST DUMB!! GOD WHY DON’T THEY JUST RELEASE EVERYTHING BUG FILLED INTO THE OFFICIAL PUBLIC RELEASE!1!1!!¡? THAT WOULD VASTLY IMPROVE MY EXPERIENCE!1!**
---
Ok no seriously though, how do people not understand the point of a public test build is to find and tweak stuff that the devs wouldn’t have been able to find in their private test build. Devs aren’t all knowing God’s that instantly find every bug and know how to perfectly balance every killer from launch.
---
&gt;  that outright would improve peoples experience
---
It wouldn't though, every killer would just camp the last hook and slap you down if you kobe.
---
Really, i haven't found it hard at all to kill survivors
---
Yooooo this is good

What is toxic?

if this is higher quality id love to see how bad the other one looked
---
It's the fourth one on the bottom row.
---
This would be a great moment to bring back the old moonlight addons, to make it the brighest and the darkest. If those were in here then ghostface in his darkest costume would make him really good.
---
He's average and SWF destroys him
---
I think it should be used more than once, make it so you can sue it twice, it is a anti tunneling perk, tunneling takes 0 skill so using a perk that counters that seems fair to me.
---
machine gun nerfs were the real goat
---
Its still considered high tier and sees quite a bit of use at purple/red ranks.
---
As weak as anyone who isn’t Billy or Nurse you mean ? I get where youre coming from
---
Plus make ur choice then leave basement
---
I think he's S++++ for me. He is so good. I hope he never gets reworked. Alot of thought and effort went into testing him and it was a success.
---
I thought you were playing as survivor my bad.
---
So clearly this proves the entity gives its' killers super strength
---
The PTB is a test, yes, but not an excuse for BHVR to activelly avoid actually testing the game themselves and make an effort to design the game. The PTB should be so the community could trim the changes and make it perfect, and not for the players to do the job people inside BHVR should have been doing.
---
This, more than one use would be lovely.
---
It’s only a matter of time before one of them gets stolen...
---
Why downvote? He's right! Amanda is the most adorable killa!
---
Great to see new players enjoying the game
---
Oh look a 50th post about the same thing

Or crouched in corner doing nothing. This type of bullshit has Forced me to bring deliverance every game because every 3/5 games I died on my first hook.

risking my job to log in JUST to upvote this because it made me laugh out loud

---
Thank mew
---
Look antothee post from a brain dead person who can't research
---
I dont think anyone is immune to spine chill, are they?
---
I think they should test things more and more efficiently.
---
You can't test something and hope to fix it in 5-7 days (since they have to deliver the patch for consoles BEFORE it comes live, around 1week prior)
---
They should test it before, ANY other game give to A CLOSED TEST SERVER like for overwatch or LoL or any test server, the things they wanna test out even months prior. They should Milk it as much as they can instead of using it just as a preview.. because this game ptb it's just it, a preview to fix very minor bugs that's it
---
Instead abusing it making even big changes or just trying out ideas there might be actually useful. Now they do that just internally but if you put the ptb kinda closed, meaning picking up just few hundreds of people to test things and share opinions would be the right thing to do
---
Just think about it. How many changes in the ptb got HUGE fixes/rethinking before hitting the live server expect minor bugs?
---
It's normal for me
---
A lot of us who had made one of these are not even talking about the bug.
---
The whole idea of not being able to use his power when seen is simply ridiculous, experienced players are really hard to sneak up on, so you depend on survivors a lot for using the power.
---
The sounds he make are also ridiculous, and this ain't a bug.
---
Stalking one person at a time is something not needed.
---
His perks being weak are not a bug.
---
Right now it's the time to say this thing, that is why the PTB is for beside, i don't want people telling me later: "That you should have said when the PTB was on" .
---
The bug was that survivor can just spin their screen and "reveal" Ghostface, in reality it is almost suppose to be instant I believe.
---
I am looking forward to trying to learn to communicate with the survivors.  Can a killer do a hello tbag or is it still be?
---
The devs already know what the problems are
---
I quit Fortnite about one month ago. And im very proud of it. But not even this Wraith deserves to play that garbage. video was 10/10.

The things is, you don't know how good the farmer is. You can be the best god damn killer in entire game, if you are not nurse or spirit, person can run you around for a good while without getting hit. 
---
Good killer does everything in their power to win. Just because you down person who was farmed in front of you, doesn't mean you are insecure, you were given easy win on a plate, why would you refuse it? It is actually more stupid to go after farmer, because he is probably farm the guy the second time, and you get rid of one person easily. It's like in football if goalkeeper tripped and you are in front of an empty net and you refuse to score, because it's too easy.
---
The emojis make this suck, this is a Facebook meme
---
i didn’t fall for it, i broke the pallet and moved on but then they would take turns looping me on the main building, i had like no chance of catching them with how many pallets there were, there were literally 4 with a small range of god pallet and they looped me to hell and back. nobody asked for your opinion anyways on this
---
It is supposed that not the camera but the character has to look at you
---
Injuring 4 people isn't hard. forcing them to heal isn't very hard either. the fact that lvl 3 loses only one stack for downing lets you simply down one guy and quickly get the stack back. even without it, you don't really need all 4 stacks, as currently many find landing greats hard, often landing one pixel away on either side. now imagine them being even smaller.
---
the problem with this perk is that it's almost useless without ruin, and overpowered with it, so it only adds on top of "ruin rng". if your ruin gets destroyed before first gen, you've just wasted two perk slots.
---
it also punishes survivors for healing even more. many people don't really want to heal anymore, as it takes ages, many killers run sloppy and you could do half a gen in this time
---
I find this perk design very problematic
---
Ignore him, you ARE getting better and they aren't easy to counter lop you still need chase sense to survive
---
I think this is the way it should work according to the devs. It's just a  bug in the moment
---
Entity Enraged
---
Re
---
Imagine you hook someone and after they got saved you can't down them for one minute Everytime. A gen is done in 80s so there would be always times where you got dsed even when you weren't tunneling and happened to me many times. 
---
I hooked chased another hooked the other guy and found out the one who got saved and got dsed because I haven't recognized the guy
---
Make it more than one use would be overkill honestly. I like ds now and I can finally use it without feeling using a cheap escapefoefreefromjail card. It's a fine perk now and make a 30-1m chase be longer, playing survivor I don't feel much pressure but time is precious for killers, even 30s it's the difference between a pip and a depip
---
True. True.

---
Yes. 何 is the Kanji for なに. I just started casually learning japanese in duolingo like a month ago and so I haven't even started on kanji yet.
---
But from reading up about it, its probably because its on its own. A stylistic choice. As if you look at it, a lone 何 wouldn't look as good as the Hiragana variant.
---
I'm fairly certain tier 1 Myers is, he might not be though but really it's fucking stupid to have a perk completely destroy your killer entirely.
---
This is the team mate that calls herself a looping god and then complains in post game chat how her team mates went down so fast.

I'm also learning from Duolingo and I'm still cracking my head as to when to use Hiragana and/or Katakana. It's so confusing, haha.

Noed wouldn’t be near as powerfull without the movement speed bonus
---
I have a ton of them and a few black wards
---
I'm not saying they will got away, of course you gonna down them eventually, but I'm saying they can run you around long enough to lose you the game. I speak from I own experience, if I'm let's coldwin farm, where is a barn on one side, tractor in a middle and killer shack on the other side, I can run any m1 115% movement speed killer from one side of the map to the other quite easily, throw pallet down, mind game for a bit, killer brakes a pallet, use tractor to play for a bit, balance landing to killer shack, play where for a bit, waste god pallet, usually one more pallet is around, go back to tracktor, get downed where on toolbox next to the tracktor, so that the killer have to walk around and vault to get you, here it's, if team is not a potatoes, 2-3 gens are done.
---
Again, from reading up on it, its mostly used to make it easier to read\shorten it. Least, the things I found say so.
---
Its not one of the worlds most difficult languages for nothing huh...
---
My first game was like this, not gonna lie, my first few games even.
---
So derpy on mechanics, I swung at more than survivor on the unhook, both while they were getting unhooked in my face and a few times before I noticed it didn't injure them.
---
Of course I wised up pretty fast and wandered off to chase another survivor.
---
Why does every quinton rat out other survivors and then nod at you expecting leniency. Or they get hit once and accept death.
---
Um..Plague was buffed when she came out is what im saying.
---
If this is serious. You're wrong, they can still bleed out and the game will be over.
---
Second, this is KYF, so, I don't think they care that much.
---
Is being revealed by Object a bug as well? :\^)
---
Thats a lie and you know it. They changed both Mettle of Man and DS, They are reworking Freddy AND Maps. They have changed pallets. Stop being a negtive peice of shit.
---

---
You better have beat her ass and killed her later
---
Thats why there should not be regular spawn places. Killers must hide their totems.
---
They will fix it before he comes out live?
---
Mediocre
---
Yes! The EGC is the best thing to happen to this game since the Halloween update that balanced palettes imo
---
It cut out a lot of the trolly behaviour that didnt add anything tot he game
---
Really want too get into this game and have watched vids on gameplay for hours but I just can't bring myself too play as I really don't wana suck and ruin someone's game.
---
What is his moving speed btw?
---
Damn this is quite surprising to be honest. Respecting pallets doesn‘t seem to work against survivors with more than 2 braincells in my experience so you kind of have to eat pallets on mediocre killers like Trapper.
---
Does NOED „save“ a lot of your games in terms of downs, hooks and kills?
---
Dude I feel you. I stopped using spirit fury because on ps4 I rarely eat a pallet. The6 usually throw it immediately and since it's 30 fps I revert rarely see survivors time it right so I stopped using it. I suggest brutal strength because it helps keep pressure up. You can even kick gens and start the chase after.
---
You do realize that the degeneracy that occurs at pride events, along with the fact that it gets shoved in everyone's faces daily, is part of the reason why people are annoyed with LGBT people right? The majority of Westerners literally don't care. Don't mistake apathy for hate. Why should I give any shits about your life decisions?
---
Why didn't he close it??
---
Maybe it’s just your shitty internet?  I highly doubt you’re getting DDOS’d like that on DBD lmao
---
It is OP is wrong.
---
For my build I run BBQ, STBFL, Brutal strength and bamboozle I have no clue why I ran it in  the first place but it actually kinda works well as bamboozle and brutal strength kills loops STBFL is just nice and hard to explain why I like it and BBQ is well BBQ.
---
Same lmao
---
I forgot those used to be a thing. Now i'm remember matches of 4 p3 claudettes three darkest moon offerings and a greater mist thickening addon.
---
As aware as I am that Ghostface's power is bugged and is a lot weaker than it's supposed to be, it shouldn't be disabled and put on cooldown if he's spotted. I think I would much prefer that his stalking is paused while the target can see him.
---
That way, he's still a stealth killer; being stealthy allows him to get close to his target. The stalking gives him that perfect edge on any survivor that he can successfully sneak up to, but if he gets spotted - even if it had no effect on his stealth - he would already be getting punished as any vaugely intelligent survivor would get out of dodge and claim a head start on the chase. If the survivor were to still be downed by Ghostface at that point it would be *their* fault for not staying vigilant enough to see him coming and also solves the issues created by the difference in perspective.
---
With the right addons. Base spirit is not as strong as people think she is.
---
you're seriously stalking and giving me -karma? :D wow i thought you were just stupid but now i see you're pathetic
---
If there’s a generator being worked on, you can usually guesstimate that there’s a survivor in that area. Checking behind the nearby walls would be the first place I’d check so I don’t think it sounds unusual that you’re getting found “a few walls away” from a generator.
---
Just realised that Hill hooks are now the worst place for GF and Basement hooks are the best. Basically gonna be forced to run GF basement builds.
---
Trapper and Hag are the only ones I don’t get hit a lot on bc of traps.  I’m really good at placement.  Everyone else I run enduring.  Noed right now is just an insurance policy.  It’s on average one extra kill.  Not great, but don’t know what else to use.
---
What is a sweaty build
---
115% aka 4.6 m/s
---
That's what i would do if i played Wraith XD it look too funny !
---
LMAO it’s because your internet is bad, i doubt they’re manually disconnecting you
---
That's probably a bigger shitpost than mine. lul.
---
What's degenerate that dosnt happen between hets at clubs and bars every single day? 
---
Not a decision or choice too btw.
---
You sound like a disgusting bitter person, mabey get surfaced drunk and go on grindr one night, suck a dick or two you would probably like it. Most straight guys do on the downlow in my experience. 
---
Peace.
---
I'm proud to be a feng main, sadly I'll mostly be using that new ballerina cosmetic for her though
---
I think this is just a really bad shitpost and that’s it
---
Don't worry about that too much, when you start the game first the matchmaking is usually really good, you get survivors/killers who are as inexperienced as you. And if you don't the other survs will probably just carry you. Just try to stay on gens if you don't know how to effectively waste the killers time and watch a few videos so you get an idea how looping works and you should already be better than 20% of the community ;)
---
WHEN I'VE SPENT THE WHOLE MATCH UNHOOKED AND I GET DOWNED AND THE LAST SURVIVOR DOESN'T UNHOOK ME AND INSTEAD HIDES IN A LOCKER OR CAMPS HATCH, JUST KNOW YOU'RE A PIECE OF SHIT. YEAH, I'M TALKING TO YOU CLAUDETTES, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
---
I don't think there is such thing as useless information. Who knows maybe the devs did not notice this bug if no one does a rant. You think Spirit would be as powerful as she is now if we all just accept her flaws easily. I admit that some of these reactions are just too much, but its for the best, its a sign that the community cares about whats going on.
---
I love this idea!
---
Lol because as a PS4 player you have software that shows you the IP...
---
PEOPLE SEEM TO CONFUSE REAL LIFE WITH THIS GAME, JUST GET ME OFF THE HOOK GUYS, STOP URBAN EVASIONING TOWARDS ME, LEAVING ME TO GO ONTO SECOND STAGE.
---
I mean. People WILL report you it's just that BHVR won't do anything about it.
---
So yeah I guess I was dumb for putting that in there.
---
Thanks I do want too try playing one day iv just never played competitive games before but I really like the look of this. Was looking forward too seeing ghostface plays but I hear he's pretty awful :(
---
You forgot decisive. I bought Michael and Laurie for it and then got it in the shrine and I just don't want to use it against my killer brethren.
---
May the community remember this period of history in DBD as “The Ghostface Fiasco”
---
The match was only like 2 minutes in though no gens done
---
Really? Since I'm a console Pleb I have to wait till the release.
---
No everything should have a fair counter. Things like Noed are reasons why this game csnt be competitive.
---
Correct
---
What does it even work from lockers??
---
"Stealth"
---
Yeah, heterosexual people don't crawl around on all fours wearing nothing but a strap-on. They don't make-out and have sex in the streets. They don't scream constantly about their sexuality. All this type of shit takes place at pride events (in public in front of young children) by the way. Normal people who aren't completely deranged don't find the need to do this type of thing. Doing this type of degenerate shit doesn't make you look cute or hip, because you apparently want to stick it to "hets" in a big way. But you never will because, again, the vast majority of people just don't give a shit about you and your life choices. Don't overinflate your own self-importance.
---
There was a time when a teammate went down and I immediately got into a locker. After they were hooked, I stayed in the locker because I heard the heartbeat soon after the hook. The killer made a beeline to the exact locker I was in out of a set of 3 lockers. Unlucky I guess, I didn't even struggle.
---
What? sit and wait? How? You only use it based on your knowledge of the situation or to get around. if Bbq goes off after a hook, I teleport to a locker close to you and begin chase. If you're looping me at killer shack, I can teleport inside and snatch you from the locker. If you're at any gen close to a locker such as those on EVERY MAP, I use it. Playing a sit and wait is the dumbest way to play the killer.
---
So...all the games I use it in?
---
R1
---
Unless someone else was also looking at him in the game I was watching but either way it seems a achievement to get it to go off, I mean just watch Montos last video lol.
---
Then shit luck I guess.
---
I agree about Legion, but only for Joey, Susie and Julie, Frank seem to be smart
---
I hate it when I swap out Borrowed Time and then go for a risky unhook because I forget I don't have it.
---
It kinda is
---
It was a little toxic but if you didn't tunnel and camp the hooked dude then you are fine
---
It can be annoying especially if you are the one getting camped. But survivors should learn when the killer is camping and rush generators. If the killer is camping he is not applying pressure elsewhere. If the survivors are smart, camping gives the killer way less points.  I don’t think it’s toxic to play that way and camping can be a good strategy if the survivors are just rushing to save everyone.
---
As a killer, do what you want to do if it gets you a win. Survivors will always complain.
---
Eventually you'll learn that Camping/Tunneling (tunneling is the tactic of chasing down the same person repeatedly to kill and remove them from the game) aren't the best ways to win, since Survivors will learn to play around it. However, until that happens, do what you want and don't let their whining ruin your day.
---
No like, they should have tested it internally like every single other video game developer out there does. The point of the ptb is to make sure there’s as few bugs as possible and to perfect the killer. The fact that GF can have his power deactivated so quickly and rarely have the power ever work tells me that this was probably poorly tested (if at all) before they decided to let the community test him out for bugs and balances. Now, imo, all this disappointment is going to do is discourage all these new people they got interested in buying the game and GF from actually buying it now because of everyone saying how shit he is. This could’ve been avoided if they tested him out beforehand.
---
The hitbox for closing it can definitely be a bit weird
---
I’ve just started too- it is toxic to camp, those killers really shouldn’t be standing at the hook. I feel much better about it when they down me and use me as bait by running around the area I’m in and seeing if anyone comes to help, or where I crawl to. It gives more leeway (since the survivor can move, either away from players to bring the killer away, or find a spot to hide) whereas on the hook the survivor is just stuck there. I feel it’s one thing to just stand there and another to use it to try and find others.
---
Well it sounds like you have been to some pretty wild prides then. The most you get is people dressing a bit extra and making out now and then. 
---
And yes, when drunk heterosexual people do some nasty shit too. Ever been to magaluf or benidorm and see the stuff people do? It's hardly exclusive to gays. 
---
But even so when most counties only decriminalised homosexuality in the last 50 years, and we are still fighting for rights, why shouldn't we have a day to be ourselves.
---
Claudette+Paller=Palette
---
If your on console, its probably because they couldn't find anyone else playing at that moment
---
tapp is extinct already
---
1. Survivors now need to look at him for 1 1/2 seconds now!
---
2. Addons updated to make the whooshing noise *moderatly* harder to hear
---
You shouldn't tunnel survivors, it kinda toxic. Camping is quite shit too for both you and the survivor. You're ruining the game for the survivor and while you camp, the rest of tve survivors get on with doing gens so they could have finished two or three gens by the time you've stopped camping, putting you at a disadvantage.
---
As a kate main I am so happy rn, I just wished they changed her latest hair too.
---
It actually ruins the gameplay for killer and survivor. As killer its just freaking boring and as survivor its damn anoying.
---
Yeah the gamepass messes up queues
---
BITCONNEEEEEEEECT
---
I'm glad XD
---
Honestly I just go by "The Entity is basically God" in this world so it decide whatever the fuck it wants
---
Lmao stfu, did you not see the stats? A 4man SWF is like 5% of games and the survival rate isn’t even significantly higher.
---
I tried it for a while, but it seems like a waste of a perk slot.
---
Haunted grounds
---
the wholesome bods and the boi WASSUP
---
Adorable
---
...I did a silly
---
You’re more likely to see survivors throwing pallets early on PS4 because half the time, if you don’t throw it early you get hit after dropping it.
---
Why are we just accepting the battlepass?? Where's the community outrage over this bs
---
Then what is it?
---
Dwight’s fine, he acts extra scared but that’s understandable given the situation they’re in.
---
The fact you’ve watched hours of gameplay videos means you’re probably better than half the playerbase already ;)
---
I'd like to hear the downvoters explain to me what counterplay this perk has, other than tunneling and slugging.
---
That's why it's on the ptb... For us to test?
---
&gt; Congratulations, they all go down in 1 hit.
---
Yes, good luck getting the hit at 115 speed
---
If we think about it, most killers would be very bad and Trapper would become top tier.
---
Don't bully me for this but can't you just crouch at the traps or Flash light them
---
I’ve noticed this with quite a few Spirits as well. They’re the same sort of people who play Billy, chainsaw away from the hook, wait for the save and then immediately chainsaw back and down the guy who got rescued. People who aren’t very good at the game but don’t want to learn, so they pick a strong killer with a lower skill floor and just tunnel their way through matches. They’ll talk about how looping is toxic and how overpowered Borrowed Time is, and if you’re any good at looping you’ll see that they think it’s toxic because they don’t know how to deal with it.
---
No, SgtSuccffffffffffff, the devs actually can't just make a dlc in a week.
---
Okay Jar'Jar
---
I guess toxic culture was probably always in a multiplayer competitive game, but seeing that most popular games these days are multiplayer competitive.
---
Me myself has become a asshole after playing League of Legends for four years, but I try to not turn into more of a asshole.
---
So long as the devs recognise this, thats good enough for me.
---
I was just saying that they always just try to cover up all of the bugs in the game
---
I disagree.
---
I think it's better if they release a slightly OP killer, and then slowly tone it down until it feels right.
---
If they did that, people would still be excited to buy and play the new killer. Right now, they're losing sales because no one is confident that the Devs can get Ghostface into a good place by the release date.
---
Yeah I think the creator just googled it, the question isn't really structured in a way typical to Japanese. Kind of just looks like they plugged translated words into an English sentence and disregarded the grammar.
---
A curse? Seriously. Homosexuality has existed from the dawn of mankind, its as natural as anything. 
---
the fact that you call it a "curse" is more telling tbh.
---
father campbell's... seems good
---
CLOWN LAUGH INFURIATES ME SO MUCH I JUST CANT HELP IT — THE VOICE ACTOR DID A DAMN GOOD JOB MAKING IT SOUND DIRTY AND SPITEFUL
---
I don't mean to be insulting, but from all showcased examples of gameplay, the devs are not well-versed enough in the dynamics of the game to warrant balance decisions. They need the PTB. And I fully support their utilization of it.
---
For me, it makes it a lot easier to refill under pressure.
---
I want you to think about this, have you ever been in a match with all male survivors? And I’m not talking about a KYF/SWF match or picking the same survivor.
---
So you theorise a person is using it, and then... what, just never hit that person again? Let them do as many gens as they want? That isn't "counterplay", you moron.
---
Once you hook someone, you need to go and patrol gens .... not stand by the hook like an idiot.  You wanna keep pressure by keeping people off gens...
---
Spirit was underwhelming in many ways on the PTB at first. And now she's the second strongest killer in the game (You're wrong if you disagree).
---
This cycle sometimes has deviance.
---
Also its 9000 shards
---
This is what I run on my trapper. Along with ruin. Noed and bbq and chili. I’m almost always getting a 4K.
---
The devs are aware of the issues, the playerbase is also definitly aware about them too. Whining every day on Reddit about them is not going to change anything. They don't try to cover up anything, the game needs new content if they want the playerbase to grow, or to be stable at the very least. Not many people would be interested in a game that has no update.
---
Bruh I main Legion but this makes me mad because 1. It makes Legion mains look toxic 2. Legion can sprint therefore it’s easy to get back to the hook if a survivor is freed 3. Camping is awful in general
---
I guess it's alright for a machine gun meme perk. But bbq, whispers ruin and nurses is just such a good combo on her I never swap perks on my huntress
---
You angrily wished all my children were gay. If they are as oppressed and down-trodden as you make them out to be, would that not be a curse upon them? Lol think things through.
---
&gt; If a killer can't hit someone 1 fucking time then they need to get good or play Uno
---
Yes, its very easy to hit someone when playing as a killer like Nurse with a movement ability or a killer like Hag who can trap, Plague has neither.
---
Otherwise, you are just relying on the survivor making a mistake, the Killer skill does not really matter then.
---
fixing problems does not make $
---
REMEMBER WHEN THEY GAVE US GOOD MATCHMAKING AND IT HAD A QUEUE TIME AND EVERYTHING? ONLY TO REMOVE IT AFTER 1 DAY? MATCHMAKING HAS BEEN SHITTIER THAN EVER SINCE AND I CANT BELIEVE ITS STILL NOT FIXED
---
Scratch marks?
---
It also, ya know, comoletly removes the killers powers making him useless against any suevivor over rank 15
---
It’s a net buff. This is good stuff.
---
Swap nurses for maiden and u have my build lol.  People seem to refuse to heal that close to me as huntress.
---
I’d bump plague up, she can fuck the team up pretty hard if they get caught down there, no escape if they are decent.
---
Great art but it really isn't scary it is much more sci fi -ish but great art and concept though maybe make the brain more exposed and leaking liquid? Still love the design as it kinda reminds me of super Jason oddly enough
---
It’ll be better for flashlights and aura keys. Kermit’s are best with Selfcare because you back it up in case you get Franklin’s and are left out.
---
Afaik the rights to the movie are super complicated to get because they've been passed between like 3 different companies since the last film?
---
Year 4 is all about the health of the game tho.
---
Spirit is a real threat.
---
They just don't want all the killer powers to be at that level.
---
This is why Freddy was fine by them for so long. They didn't want to keep adding more and more oppressive killers for the sake of having strong killers, especially since we already have nurse. Killer selection is more about how strong you want to be, and not personal preference.
---
 You can prefer a killer, but you have to be aware of how strong they are, and maybe only choose them when you are ok with losing. I like wraith, but I don't go into a game thinking I will do well. I'm realistic.
---
You suffer less stun. You said it yourself. The recover time is lower than before.
---
I struggle with which side they’re working on when I appear
---
Oh of course. Fingers crossed they deliver, smh
---
THIS. THEY HAVE A HANDFUL OF KILLERS THAT ALL NEED SOME ATTENTION. BUT THEY KEEP ADDING SHIT KILLERS THAT NEED ATTENTION SO ITS PROBABLY JUST A NEVER ENDING CYCLE AT THIS POINT
---
If you’re fullly healed when MoM is active, you’re immune to getting downed, btw. This is gonna be a very sneaky Buff.
---
I'll never get the whole "X developer has the complete inability to do Y" thing. Sure, Ghostface is busted as shit right now, but people keep panicking about it like he's gonna be another Freddy. Hopefully he's not, but I think BHVR is at least able to learn from it's mistakes. Legion was hot garbage when they came out, BHVR fixed them (eventually). Decisive Strike was broken as hell, BHVR fixed it (eventually). 
---
Maybe it's just a bit of hyperbole and I'm overreacting, or maybe I just have a lot more optimism than others, but it's the PTB, people. Just chill and let the developers do their best to respond to this shit show that is Mr. Wazzup.
---
You can't just dive into a locker for a full minute every time the killer drinks a pool, you fucking potato.
---
&gt;fair counter
---
Like cleansing totems? Using a map? Using Detective’s Hunch? Using Small game? Remembering locations as you go across the map?
---
I played my first two games last night, I think I have the same basic anxiety as you so I chose killer ... essentially my purpose is to kill everyone and that makes it a good game.  So it worked out for me lol.
---
Give it a shot.
---
yeah jason x is the main insperation for him
---
I would say Trappers are very nooby and easily bullied. Hillbillies never M1 and just spam that chainsaw all day. Adams will use Deliverance at the worst time possible and get knocked down instantly. Jeff's are pretty chill so are Ashes. Those are mine so far
---
Actually i dont think this would ever happen.
---
Also i dont think its hard to create 1 survivor in 3 months. I mean they dont even have to create a new skeleton or animations. They got differnt models for males like david ace and dwight and differnt models for females. So if they wanna make a new female survivor they just can use the normal meg model and change the skin. Except they wanna make her thick like jane or giv her bigger boobies like kate. All left to do then is giving the new girl a few soundeffects and put in some perks. Done is the new survivor
---
you are right
---
Is Jane superman's alter ego?
---
I must learn this pants glitch 🤣
---
The sounds could be bugs too you know. I think they were worried of making the exposted time too long since he can get it easier then myers. Persroanlly, i think 20 seconds is fine if he gets like a short speed boost.
---
Everyone knows these but I'll tell them anyway. Dwights love their lockers and claudettes love their bushes
---
THIS CAN HAPPEN TO ME ON CONSOLE. IF IM STRUGGLING AND SOMETHING LAGGY HAPPENS ILL USUALLY JUST DIE AS IM PUSHING X LIKE MY LIFE DEPENDS ON IT.  F
---
I think it would  be better if it worked like in the leaks, where he can still stalk outside of the shroud, but maybe make it more powerful in it.
---
Find pallets and gens to break to mop up a few more Bloodpoints is what I'd do. Or at least not be a toxic asshole.
---
Sure, any good books you can recommend? Last good book I read was The Martian.
---
When the Killer that gets Exposed status from his power takes perks that also gives Exposed
---
Idk...kinda sounds like you’re making excuses. Maybe it’s not that easy after all. Oh well, it’s ok.
---
Ooh no I didn’t even know this was a thing! I feel so bad now :c
---
I agree about micheal
---
You sound like you need to play killer. When I was a wee baby and had never played survivor, a lot of the shit they did seemed like BS. Open your mind, olay both sides, and shit will be less of a mystery to you.
---
This would cause such a mess
---
No. Survivors will try to beat you into submission with their goddamned fucking whiny messages until they shape you into the good little obedient killer they want you to be and until you play by their little nonsensical rules. Forget all that. You're the goddamn killer, you play as you please.
---
So salty.
---
That’s literally not what I’m sayin at all. I agree with him on every point. The game is trash and the devs aren’t ever going to fix it because they have a solid squad of dummies that’ll defend their every mistake. I’m being serious when I say that the dude (if he’s being serious) is SERIOUSLY stressing himself out over a lost cause, and that’s not good. BHVR is a garbage developer and getting so angry every time they fuck up is like asking for a heart attack.
---
Hey you can't complain about noed later than, thank you very much!
---
Not with the way WGLF works. Half the time it can be a wasted perk slot or will require you to do things such as bodyblock to get tokens, for no other reason than to get the token.
---
Nope. Just glad to shut you up. You can’t prove it, so you’re wrong.
---
I would love to have his chainsaw have no speed penalty. As both the killer and survivor side of it.
---
Premonition also has that line in the description.
---
Before it was, now its not based off of TR. Iridescent button main use is breaking pallets now. Not map wide detection.
---
I normally agree with you. But no. Not this time. It's a five second stun that can't be mitigated in any way thanks to the enduring change. Giving it multiple charges would be goddamn overkill. Yeah, tunneling takes no skill. But survivors claim to hate perks that reward bad play. Which is what this perk is. Guess only survivors are allowed to have crutch perks.
---
If it bothers you to that degree, make your steam profile private and click on the chat bubble to close the chat. You can play the game however you want to play. That includes facecamping or nodding, or whatever else you may do. Survivors will be mad in post game chat but hey everyone moves on.
---
I understand not everyone has thick skin but there's only so much you can do before you need to say "Fuck it"
---
Wraith's usually tunnel
---
Hag's usually proxy camp
---
Leatherface's usually face camp
---
Claudette's always hide in bushes and are immersed (they run away once they hear the heartbeat)
---
Dwight's like to go in lockers.
---
Nea is toxic
---
And is Enduring/Spirit Fury toxic, or practical? Seriously, drop the pallet early on a killer with this combo and it's really inconvenient.
---
It's called Urban evading properly and taking more caution around the heartbeat, but thanks for confirming you don't know how to stealth and still get things done. Dcing doesn't count as stealth by the way.
---
I used to play clown extensively, but because he wasn’t really for me I stopped. I do agree people should at least try him out, but it is what it is.
---
I agree, I'm gonna get him because it'll be fun to play, creeping corners and stuff looks so spooby :p if I played killers based on meta then I wouldn't have mained Bubbha and now lately trapper :p
---
While it is fun to run numbers, obviously survivors are nowhere near as efficient to actually always be working on a generator at all times, and then with multiple people all working together on remaining generators. Even if we assume perfecty-coordinated survivors that only ever work gens, not only is there the time required to traverse the map as well as find generators, but there are times when they have to heal, rescue other survivors, avoid the killer. 60 seconds does not come close to account for that, even if the killer is only ever chasing 1 survivor at a time, rather than having multiple people occupied as is often the case.
---
Then there are also a few errors I think you've made when accounting for killer perks. Ruin does not only regress the generator by 5% (or 4 seconds) per good skill check, but it also prevents any progress from being put on the generator by anyone for 3 seconds. That's effectively 7 seconds per good skill check. Then you also failed to account for the fact that longer gen repair times increase the average number of skill checks triggered during that repair, especially if survivors keep working during the 3-second freeze. For action speed debuffs, it is important to note that they are only ever applied successively, rather than cumulatively, because otherwise they would approach 0% action speed and could theoretically prevent any progress from happening at all (this happened in the past with stacked healing speed debuffs, after which I assume BHVR changed things). So if you have an 80 second generator, first Thanatophobia's 16% makes that ~95s. and then Dying Light's 25% ~127 seconds. Order doesn't matter. Whereas applied cumulatively instead, it would come out to about 136 seconds. Action speed buffs and debuffs are also not applied cumulatively, so if for example you have We'll Make It which increases healing speed by 100%, and Sloppy Butcher which decreases it by 20%, it doesn't simply overall increase healing speed by 80% (which would be 8.8 seconds for a heal), but you apply them successively too - first 100% buff (8 seconds for a full heal), and then 20% debuff to that (10 seconds for a full heal). Or vice versa, as again, order doesn't matter.
---
I agree. IMO if Beast of Prey straight up removed the Red Stain it wouldn't be overpowered.      
---
Skilled Killers can already use moonwalking for the same effect and there are plenty of short loops that the perk wouldn't work on.
---
A lot of perks are like that for both sides; cool ideas hindered by unnecessary downsides. 
---
Like why do Windows of Opportunity and Dark Devotion have cooldowns? Why doesn't Furtive Chase decrease Terror Radius both inside and outside a chase? Why the heck is Deja Vu on a timer? Why do most perks have to be so useless?
---
Did you even read what he did in this match?
---
It's は not わ
---
We already have David.
---
Hahahahha nice
---
Ripley and Rick. YES. I want them sooo much!
---
Have you heard anything besides the automated response email I got when I put my ticket in 2 days ago for the same issue?
---
This whole conversation put a smile on my face for some reason
---
*thank you*. The low quality version didn't do the new hair justice.
---
In which universe is no mither fun to run
---
google bodyblocker hag, it's hilarious
---
&gt; I swear all you killer mains
---
Lol, your a survivor main so stfu
---
&gt; Killers are FASTER.
---
well yeah, thats obvious
---
&gt; maps are nothing but loops that survivors can be in in 3 seconds. 
---
speak english
---
Don't think they are a good fit or are iconic enough, just my opinion tho. I really dont like The Walking Dead or the Dead Rising franchise. Adding Shaun would just be goofy IMO.
---
Just bring a apple, problem solved
---
Thanks a bunch :) I'm gonna make a trapper one for Sure!
---
items and offerings are used up per match, dc is fairly normal, and breaking pallets it definetly a must, but try and respect pallets if someone trys to loop you with one
---
1000% agree. That cooldown for Beast of Prey is ridiculous. Survivors already know that they are in a chase by the chase music, so why not give killers at least the ability to turn off their red stain for some mind game capability. It's not like such a thing would nerf survivors since killers still need to actually catch and hit them.
---
If you had a good time, then you won.  Trust me on this
---
Thanatophobia is your friend
---
They'll understand when your teammates complete the last gen and escape.
---
OK,thanks
---
Well if Bill from Left 4 Dead is "iconic" enough to get in so is Rick and Frank tbh, they hadlve a way larger presence in pop culture.
---
I forogt the Enduring change my bad. I agree that it is shit now.
---
I read it after hearing the book is better than the movie and I agree 100% with that.  I got earth is room enough that I need to read.
---
Hiragana is more cute/childish
---
Doesn’t make much sense. 3/4 are zombie survivors and the 4th was hunted by aliens so I don’t see any killer options besides maybe a xenomorph but that’d be really pushing it.
---
Gens take 80 seconds
---
Worthless Skank seems like a nerf for survivors.
---
His point is that it was needed 2 years ago and they focused on cosmetics and a bunch of other stuff to make money over the health of the game. Now finally they get around to it and you act like they are great. No they probably saw dwindling numbers and finally bucked up to get it done.
---
Press A to let go.
---
yea i tend not to camp hooks, unless gates are open and i hooked someone.  yea i'm not leaving the area.  i wont facecamp, but i'll be nearby so if their friends want to be ballsy i'm gonna make em pay.  
---
also, if i hook someone i always leave and go to a gen or something.  if i'm still in the process of leaving and they get unhooked, you  best believe i'm turning right around and going after the rescuer.  
---
wait for me to leave at least.  im trying to give yall a window to escape.
---
While people may not consider it a horror movie I think Sarah Conner would be a good choice too. She’s an ultimate survivor in my opinion.
---
“Hey little mama lemme whisper in your ear...”
---
*sworded*
---
“But I was stealthed! How did you see me?!”
---
“With my eyes.”
---
“Oh... right...”

I think the only book that isn't better than its movie counterpart is 'Psycho'. It had some good stuff in it, but the movie made the story better. What's funny is Alfred Hitchcock, who directed the movie, bought every copy of the book he could find just so people who haven't read it yet wouldn't know the plot twist.
---
It's a public TEST BUILD. you're supposed to be looking for bugs. there's always something they end up changing.
---
1. Winning is subjective mostly in this game. But if you got all of them then you won without a doubt.
---
2. Yes to hitting gens and pallets. You can't always do it right away but use your best judgement on when to break them. Usually the sooner the better.
---
3. DCing is sadly very common. If they all quit at the exact same time it could be a connection issue. If it keeps happening make sure your connection is stable.
---
4. Offerings are used up the moment a match starts no matter what, unless someone quits during the loading screen which cancels the match. Add-ons for killer are also used up at the end of the match unless the killer uses the Black Ward offering which saves the add-ons for another use.
---
For survivors they keep items so long as they escape with them or use a White Ward offering. However, they have to be holding the item upon death to keep it in that case.
---
This is the most true true
---
1) Winning is up to you. I recommend you deem winning as if you had fun or not. Or the number of hooks you managed to get. again completely up to you. Just try to have fun and if possible allow everyone to have fun. Typically at least a 2k is considered a win, but i deem it a win if i got every one hooked at least twice
---
2) Yes definitely break pallets. Gens is kinda a situational thing. Sometimes you have to give up a chase to smack a gen. If you're not in a chase definitely smack the gen. It regresses until it's touched again so they are losing progress on their gen if you smack it. there's also perks that apply when smacking gens (overcharge gives them a really hard skill check when you smack it and pop goes the weasel makes it regress as much as 25% if you smack it)
---
3) DC's are VERY common. If you camp or tunnel people will dc. Or if they're salty pussies they will dc. Also people derank to dc. they happen a lot for a lot of reasons and it really ruins every one's fun
---
4) You will always  lose your items when  you use them. The only thing that saves your items is when you use the offering "black ward" but add ons are always one time use until you find more in the bloodweb. If you're a survivor you keep your items and add ons if you escape but if you die or drop it it's gone.
---
Hope i helped. Happy to answer any other questions you have good luck
---
I like Frank West and maaaybe Rick. I haven't seen Shaun or the dead so I don't really have an opinion on him but Ripley is a no from me only because I don't feel like the Alien franchise really fits into dead by daylight.
---
*pulls down*
---
-Every Single Killer Player should Know that only suicidal Survivors would try to fix gens in a 3 Gen setup if only 2 remain.  That situation is basically impossible to finish a gen.  Hardcore patrolling them removes any possibility of them even trying to risk doing the repairs.
---
Even going AFK does not mean much since as far as the Survivors know you could just be wiating there while watching your screen in an attempt to lure them out
---
-Do you not Understand how the End Game Collapse works???? The Killer can trigger it even if 1 Gen is left to complete. Heck, the Killer can trigger it even if 5 Gens are left to complete. The Killer can Trigger it AT. ANY. TIME. THEY. WANT.
---
-Survivors primary objective is to Survive. In a scenario with 2 players left and Gens remaining, the most realistic way for a Survivor to escape is usually to hide until the teammate dies and then go through the Hatch.
---
You are 100% Wrong and Misinformed to say you were unable to further the game. You could have triggered the End Game AT. ANY. TIME.
---
**It is impossible for Survivors to Hold the Game Hostage since the Killer can trigger the End Game AT. ANY. TIME. THEY. CHOOSE.
---
**Somehow you think a Survivor playing badly means increasing their odds of escaping. That is a very weird definition
---
Fuck Ghostface, give us Jane in a G-String!
---
Oh wow! Yeah now I’m definitely going to look into that. Thanks
---
If lobby dodging as killer should be punished for 30 min then survivors that DC during the game should be punished way harder you realize that right?
---
About sounds, you don't play killer do you? Sounds are currently fucked when you play killer, but I guess you didn't knew that for obvious reasons
---
You can find another game in seconds as survivor and isn't a big deal. When they Dodge me it looks 15s max to find another lobby, I prefer that than a team mate that DC because he's bad AF or salty
---
I’ve been a proud bill main for almost two years now, get out of my sight mortal.

Thank you

Refreshing that rank is not based on kd like every. Other. Game.

I hope they fixed the physics lol.

I doubt... There are burned human bodies in the game

Eh. I play pig a lot and I don't really mind too much.
---
i really want brenda meeks tbh
---
Entity displeased
---
ash is 100% a massive douche. they're the ones that drop the pallet way early so they can tbag
---
Even if that were true, what's to stop survivors from slowly 360ing their camera? It'll still most likely interrupt him
---
Read the TOS for the game and the TOS for the shoe. Vastly different.
---

The worst part is that if she injured she would start moaning.

sounds good. i thought ashley was also licensed and that i heard he was buyable with shards (9k apparently, i thought 8k for whatevr reason). alright when ghostface comes out i'll just see if he's buyable for 9k, otherwise it's the dlc from the store either way
---
Hex perks are extra powerful at the expense of being able to be broken.. if you’re tired of your hexes being broken, try using different perks. Pop instead of ruin, make your choice instead of devour, etc.
---
I remember I waited for like 30 min on my last match so I reque back up and just took like a 20 min shower then when I got back the game was already over and I'm like "Are you kidding me?!!"
---
Huh? I’ve never seen a splinter that allows you to play as doctor. I’ve only seen splinters for the licensed killers
---
I'm rank 9
---
"it's just ptb"
---
*Flashback of previous ptb patches* yeah.. it won't change much, ofc people get pissed. I won't buy that dlc even if I would've liked to until they fix it.. sorry """"""dlc""""""" now sounds more real
---
Oh no.
---
I imagine Mikan would be a survivor whose main goal is to attract killer's attention and run him around for as long as possible. Hence those kind of perks which give killer incentive to go after her. besides, would you rather be your aura shown for 20 seconds, which killer might not notice or be otherwise preoccupied, or a loud notification?
---
My right ear is bleeding how dare you
---
Yeah, a couple of times.
---
So?
---
When I reach rank 1 sometimes matches me with rank 10. As my previous post wanted to clarify, it will happen..
---
More often than you think

Wait what action is this

The end goal to rank up is what gets you points. Do the emblems.
---
You're lucky that when you're not seen at least you're powers don't get deactivated.
---
\*Ghostface starts crying\*
---
But yea I done this before It's actually pretty fun. Though in one instance the there was that one survivor that was pretty mad at me because he put a cake down and didn't want to farm in the process because I kept running away hiding.
---
I mean either short speed boost or extended exposed time, those are two alternatives. Maybe a small speed boost when being detected to be like the movies. Also i dont think the sounds are a bug because they talked about them being there in their stream. Lets hope its a bug
---
Time for your PUNISHMENT
---
pulls out flashlights*
---
Honestly you shouldn’t play to please Survivors.  Play how you want. That being said, you shouldn’t really camp because it’s usually a bad strategy. It works against bad Survivors or overly altruistic ones but Survivors who know what they’re doing will rush through the gens while you camp. You also lose points for staying near a hook for too long so you’ll rank up slowly.
---
Fair, fair, but maybe drop them like 10 seconds, maybe evn just 5
---
I'm sad about the Feng changes and the Bloody Kate hair.
---
Tbh, I miss her hair being all over the place when she got released lol
---
Meme builds and managing to cheese an escape give me some of the biggest laughs in the game
---
I love how they were so focused on the stupid mist add-on instead of the actual subject of the post.
---
How i Joined the Hookers
---
Fake interview Casting
---
I always say this at the end of the game when I play plague.
---
"Open up youngling's, It's feeding time"
---
I’ll add to this..  Fight Club is much better as a movie than a book. The overall plot and series of events flow better on screen than how it was originally written.
---
Tbh I would rather have Junko or a different student as the killer rather the Monokuma. Be kinda like making Billy the killer for the Saw chapter
---
Why with make your choice??
---
Pretty sure Frank West could make a generator turn into a mini gun with just a Medkit and a Flashlight. Even if the combinations don't work he will still make a weapon regardless.
---
Cause they decided to put it in the manga and I bought it
---
Persoanlly i think he should get like a 5% speed boost for the duration of the exposed effect. 
---
I do think they are going to change the sounds like with what happened with spirt.
---
When you really gotta get that ruin.
---
Go to were your steam games are, right click dbd, choose properties, choose beta, click the menu that says opt out if alk beta, click public tes, dowaload ptb
---
The safety net of the first 5 ranks is enough
---
It's like in a fighting game making it easier to drill half hp pressing one button to make it more accessible
---
Better focus on the experienced players, always.
---
1 more competitive which translates in more events (e sports/tournament)
---
2 more money from that which translates in improving the game
---
3 self advertisement through players which translate in more money
---
And the circle continues
---
Just look to games like LoL, even if it's competitive af still has a ton of casuals, same for overwatch and so on so forth
---
BTW if you're gonna say "it's a small company," etc etc, still look at riot games. Even if I hate that company they did exactly what I said and look where they are now compared to few years ago
---
outstanding move!
---
TWD is trash so I'd rather have Clementine than anyone from the comic or show.  Frank and Shaun would be redundant as people from other zombie titles.
---
Ripley would be tight as fuck though and they could totally do a xenomorph killer if they were careful about how its abilities worked.
---
I bet when Myers goes tier 3 he says "Oh boi, time to go killing again" with a big smile on his face.
---
Brother I hear ya, I've swapped to full selfish mode now I'm solo deliverance is gold when you get idiots
---
You have to double pip, so make sure you play perfect against all survivors and you might do it. So the better the rank the less adepts.

Legion could have actually pulled you out instead of closing it but I think she just wanted you to witness you're demise by closing it instead.
---
It's a nerf, since it doesn't work against perks that give stuns anymore.
---
I think it's fine to base opinions on personal experiences.  Just because he doesn't base his opinion off of others who disagree with him doesn't mean he doesn't listen to what they have to say...
---
Pretty nice.
---
Enduring was the counter.
---
Idk , for the exposed duration could be either very strong or very weak, neither of wich we want. I like gettibg abigger one for a shorter time when spotted, but that me. I just hope they make him at least viable, not an literal m1 killer that can t-bag ya know ?
---
Because with Furtive chase, whoever unhooks your obsession becomes the obsession. With Make your choice, they can become exposed for period of time. Essentially, one hit your obsession to build up Furtive chase quickly and lose that terror radius.
---
4ks do not earn the achivment you need to be adept.
---
Amazing work!!
---
damn, if that ain't the truth... I like the perk. Sure would be nice if I got to use it.
---
Hah, thanks! xD I don't sell them. I made them as prizes for my Twitch followers. I'd like to make full-sized cards with different art on them sometime.
---
When I play the Huntress and play Basement hunting I just use territorial and whenever it detects a survivor going down I just start chucking hatchets like it was D-Day when they start coming up.
---
I mean, I’ve never had trouble with them. Maybe that’s because I’m garbage and get matched with garbage survivors. But it is generally much much easier to get with survivors, yeah
---
long reply for someone unaffected.  it's reddit, dont get your panties in a bunch.  you dont need to explain yourself.  i dont care.  have a good one :)
---
WGLF is probaly the reason I still want to play survivor sometimes
---
Internal testing should be done before it even hits the PTB.
---
Well yea but the only killer who can take advantage from that is freddy... Maybe with dying light could work but still a thing for a Monto's video only
---
He completely shrugged them off because they’re “at best rank 13” while he’s a consistent red ranked player. He made that assumption with absolutely no basis because he thinks he knows the game better than the people who have the actual numbers. That’s the problem. Not his experiences, my bad.
---
Heya! Not really... I sent you a PM but I can also write it out here. I'm not sure why, but I'm only receiving what looks like partial messages from you. You can message me on Discord (Rory#8450) or Steam (RoryDiesALot) if you're still having trouble getting messages through. Good luck!
---
"ghost face mains" *hasn't been released yet*
---
Ok..
---
When the Pig came out there were some situations where they thought it was a survivor so when the survivors worked on a gen she just pulls them out confused.
---
Nurse cause she’s slow AF
---
Yup, there are still 40 left! If you'd like one, just send me a PM and tell me where to mail it!
---
It's fairly common.  I see lots of expose stacking Myers.
---
Most ridiculous case I've seen was NOED-Make your Choice-Devour Hope-Ruin Myers.
---
Basically the entire game exposed even though he wasn't using a perma T3 build.
---
Got your PM, just wanted to reply on here to let you know I got it and all is good!
---
SOO MANNY LEFFFT.
---
You don’t understand
---
/s
---
You had two teammates who couldnt get an 80 second gen done together in 120 seconds.  The killer def isnt the biggest problem here.
---
No, it’s not a rule, just extremely shitty behaviour and poor gameplay.
---
Nah it’s a tactic that the killers can use it’s part of the game, it might be scummy but we can’t tell people how to play the game they bought unless they are cheating in some way
---
I mean, with how the stalk works you dont get it off much anyway.
---
Camping is *not* a reportable offense.
---
[More info here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system)
---
It depends on the situation. If one or more survivors are around the hook, it’s acceptable. If that is not he case then yes it’s a shitty thing to do
---
Sadly I do.. that's the point..
---
I mean honestly at 1 gen I'd maybe just take it if I didn't think I could reliably get the other two. Better than losing my kill after the gates are opened.
---
That being said the true cringe compilation worthy bit is how they didn't manage to do a gen in that time. Particularly like the guy crouch walking and sprinting around the map. Literally the meme about Rank 20s but in real life.
---
I think they removed the killer's ability to grab hatch-jumping survivors
---
The Trapper's basement is one you're highly unlikely to escape being that you can turn the basement itself into one giant trap plus he has great add-ons that ensures that once you get survivors down there it's difficult to leave. The best part is he doesn't even have to be there, just set the traps and let the survivors do the rest. Simple, but effective
---
WOAH! ITS YOU! I was actually just making a WKUK reference lmao
---
I mean this is one of the problems. It takes realy immersed survivors NOT to allow michaeld to ever get to tier 3, but with ghosty its too easy.
---
"Top Ten outstanding citizens" hmmm
---
She also hasn’t been out for too long and think she’s nicher than the other killers. She could be a few buffs away from being top tier (looking at you spirit) or be stuck low-mod tier like majority of killers. I’m thinking it’s a matter of her just not being as popular so good players don’t play her because they could play the 3 they know get the job done in red ranks. Still, they have some evidence suggesting she, at least does ok at red ranks. I don’t think she’ll be making a new meta or anything though.
---
Thats one way. Again i dont care what they do, just make him viable and FUN.Most imoratant is that he is fun
---
They don’t have 2 weeks because of console certification.  They have more like 5 days.  2 of which they don’t work.  I don’t see them doing such a complex fix by the time it goes live, because 3 days is not a lot of time.
---
Dance with Me is super fun to run, especially with Lithe. It’s hilarious watching the killer spin in a circle trying to figure out where the hell you went.
---
The Winter Eyes cosmetic for Legion suggests the killer player has had this game since the Winter Solstice event afaik
---
It's kinda rare, female survivors are pretty much the meta
---
Trophies on Steam, too. But... people buy DLC just to get trophies? To each their own.
---
The emotes are 1 and 2 on keyboard
---
But if we don't complain the devs won't change anything because appearantly they don't test their own stuff.
---
Improvements to the detection algorithm to more accurately guess when GF has actually been spotted instead of just interrupting him whenever he has a pixel visible on screen I suppose.
---
This is really cool, I hope this one gets added.
---
They have 2 weeks. He comes out on the 18th of june and it doesnt take that long to make a consle certifation now a days. Its much faster.
---
Love it &lt;3
---
Yea. I just think they need to not make his power break as fast at least.
---
I have 4000 hours in Dbd and I would say to keep self care, and use a perk like sprint burst to get distance from the killer. I also use iron will so that the killer cant hear me when I'm injured.

i learn the most from survivors when i play killer.  When they pull great moves on me, i can learn from that.
---
additionally, i learn killer weaknesses/limitations when i play them.  i feel like the game was really made to be experienced from both sides.
---
Rank 15 Killer vs 3 rank 1-5 and 1 rank 15 survivors. Seems about right.
---
You see, with online games where you have character selection, there isn't supposed to be one singular way to play. In Overwatch, there isn't just one set of characters you have to play in order to win, in League, there are better choices than others in terms of champions, but again, there isn't one top tier character comp that you have to play to win.
---
DBD, however, forces you into playing Nurse or Billy if you don't want to get cucked at high tiers. That's why we need more powerful killers. The reason there are so many Nurse mains isn't because she's broken (even though her power is incredibly strong, don't get me wrong), it's because playing anything else puts you at a severe disadvantage. Especially against a SWF.
---
If more killers were stronger, there'd be more diversity at red ranks, but... We all know how survivor only players feel about an actual challenge.
---
Exactly, unlike the survivors perks, EVERY SINGLE PERK, BAR WHISPERS can be countered by the survivors.   
---
NOED: Get your ass off the gen and start cleaning totems, If you cant find them break up your survivor crutch meta and run Small Game (WHICH I MAY ADD MAKES COUNTERING NOED CHILDS PLAY)
---
Btw, try to learn how to get flashlight and pallet saves. You can probably find a yt video on them. Have fun.
---
i love you guys haha #nohomo #peopleofthefog
---
Well we did just get a mix and match with Ash and Ghostface so I don't see why it can't be a mix and match with Pinhead or some other solo killer
---
Thanks for the quick tips!
---
I'll keep that in mind since they sound good, Sprint burst could be good in chases and Iron Will would be good if I'm trying to hide after a chase.
---
The same bug happend to me once, I had lvl 2 pig without unlocking her. I even detailed how it happend. [My reddit post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a6ivwh/i_think_i_broke_the_game_a_bit/)

thanks mate! apreaciated!

Will do thanks man!!(:
---
:O
---
Solider Snake
---
Oh. I get it lol.
---
&gt;i feel like the game was really made to be experienced from both sides.
---
We need more people with this mindset, like, a lot more
---
That or if your not the opession you dont get insta down protection just 1 extra m1 hit, The only people who have a problem with this is entitled survivors, YOU LITERALLY GET A extra hit just for existing you shouldnt get insta down protection just because of a crutch perk.
---
I’m sorry but after the Clown I don’t expect them to fix things fast; and they haven’t really surprised me yet.  I have full confidence it will get fixed, but Peanits wouldn’t use phrases like “in the time left” if they were confident of fixing it before the 18th.
---
That’s what everyone has been saying will do thanks man!!(:
---
I would pay good money for a Shaun pack tbh
---
The most painful experience was getting the Hag when the new system was implemented. But thank god I don't have to do adept again because I'm finished with that shi\*. Until ghostface comes out....
---
You had every crutch in the book including an instaheal and you still barely survived against a noob Trapper.
---
Thank you!
---
Mettle of man has absolutely nothing to do with tunneling, it's getting hit three times and the 4th time you just say "no you didn't hit me"
---
What he was saying is that they will see what changes they can make before he comes out and make changes. Meaning he will at least be different on live. They also did this with  both the Plague, Spirit and Legion beforehand, who all played different on live vs PTB. 
---
I imagine they will most likely do smaller things, like the spotting range, the time it takes for it to trigger, the sounds and the bugs.
---
You have to double pip meaning 2 iridecent and 2 golds If I remember to Double Pip. If you finish the game very fast to where you just hook 4 survivors you don't get any points on Chase and hits. Also probably Hook because you to hook them all 3 times.
---
If you like to play stealthy, I would recommend urban evasion and iron will. Both can be really useful when trying to avoid the killer’s line of sight while hiding. 😊 good luck my dude/dudette
---
I've been experimenting with Flashlights a bit, Like flashing Killers to blind them **or** for them to drop the person they're carrying. Actually just did it Last game! But i'll defininetly try it our more!
---
**Now, Collect your arrow**
---
This looks MUCH better than the last one you made. Good job!
---
I would absolutely buy Shaun. He would be loads of fun, especially if voiced like Ash was.
---

I hate this meme only because this man and his wife were my landlord a few years ago and they were the most awful people I’ve ever met. They are a big reason on why my anxiety is so high! I went through so much bullshit with this man and his wife and it just really sucks to see him getting meme fame..
---
Ah okay just making sure you don’t get banned for this :)
---
Just keep playing fair and use lowercase gg. For some reason uppercase is considered bm. 
---
I have this issue daily on xbox. Its annoying. If I get a "tunneler, or camper or w/e they wanna call me" I just gg and move on. Sometimes they let it go and sometimes they blow up my inbox. Just move on with your day man. Play smart, play fair.

thanks for the info

I’m assuming we will see the audio queues removed.  Everything else depends on what’s bugged and whether they can fix that in time to do something else.  This feels like they tried to reuse premonition, so I’m not sure what they are going to come up with.
---
Tell me.
---
At this point I always assume the video is too loud and listen to it at a low volume to check for that before actually watching the video
---
Modern Problems require Modern Solutions.
---
Yup, I played probably 7 games in a row, every single one with either survivors that DC’d or gave up on the hook immediately. Played as one of the weaker killers and just going for BBQ hooks, not playing in a irritating way.
---
It’s terrible. What’s worse is the devs have said we need to wait for dedicated servers to come out before they will do anything. So, right now we are waiting on that and everyone can DC because they didn’t get in a match with a perkless Freddy.
---
Well if you needed the NOED to get the 4K then not necessarily
---
Yeah, and a slight buff to head-on ;p
---
Nodding at a survivor on the hook isn't respectful. Its the same as teabagging.
---
NOED has in fact been changed. 
---
It used to be only tier 3 that would grant exposed.
---
The other tiers only granted speed boost and decrease time between each missed swing.
---
For balance I guess
---
your kinda right tbh
---
Tries to get killer to chase them instead of someone else &gt; killer chases them instead of another person &gt; surprised pikachu face. Where is the logic?
---
the lack of a dc punishment
---
The issue is you played survivor, and that's lame.
---
Be a Chad
---
This is the average experience of someone that plays DBD often so yeah if I see someone complain about most of the things you listed I assume they must be new.
---
No they aren't exclusives
---
Three of you remember this, I love it.
---
Pallet slap
---
lol, that doesnt make you a good killer tho. if you play fair youre a good killer, if you kill everyone without facecamping and tunneling youre a good killer too
---
I'm thinking climbing might be a good ability in general; walls and ceilings are a completely un-utilized space in the game right now, and no need for a speed vault if you can just climb over it instead.  Would need to be restricted in some places but otherwise would be pretty fun.
---
I recognize those ranks.
---
I had a game a pig earlier today, had a mori and charge attack daily. After I was told to "get fucked" and had 3 out of the 4 of them being rude.
---
Unsure if it was these people, or if it was just people with the same ranks.
---
*Also, how dare people be mean to the poor piggy...* Oink
---
my man :)
---
*uses perks* gets called toxic by survivors
---
*survivors use meta perks* tells killers that theyre babies
---
This game punishes killers for using the mechanics provided so shut the fuck up

I'm gonna miss the preschool

The new MoM is going to counter Noed now. Since Mom can proc on insta downs.
---
Yeah I don't get the meme that's she "has the mind of a child" no, no she doesnt, she is completely independent and lives by herself, she has killed multiple armed people by herself. Just because someone loses their mother doesn't make their brain stops developing lol.

Wait, is this Sharon's stream? dint know BHVR lurked there XD

ttv/[sharon](https://www.twitch.tv/sharon)
---
Ok just stop it’s never going to be changed.
---
Both sides can suck a BBC as both sides bitch and moan constantly oh just use a different killer or oh just use these shit perks so I could win. I just can't keep up with the amount of bullshit rules each side makes on a daily basis. Only cool people are the people that play both sides or just meme around.
---
They arent getting rid of it, but they will change things like having the school itself move to new spots isntead of it always being the same.
---
That's because as bad as that game is,  all of the people who play F13 are fans of Jason. This fanbase is generally made of hyper competitive kids full of baby rage that lack empathy for their opponents.
---
What shitty logic
---
Its not a bad tactic. It's a way to take attention away from another survivor. However, if the person calls you names in the end chat, then they deserve to die
---
Who knew the Player *Test* Build wasnt a test...
---
Eyy, free medkit
---
Cleanse totems you’re welcome
---
Noed has many counters, unlike old D-strike
---
If you are really trying to not be toxic, chances are you aren’t. Many folks tend to define anything they don’t like as “toxic”  and will complain, accuse, and sometimes out right lie about it. Just remember to take a step back and decide what “toxic” means to you, and act accordingly. 
---
Can camping/tunneling be toxic? Absolutely. Is it *always* toxic? Not at all. It is the context and the effect which the technique has on the game. As others have said, sometimes those actions are the more  competitive choice, even at high rank, and you shouldn’t feel bad about using them. Most of the time, however, those techniques not only fail to get good results, but also come off as a bully-killer picking on a survivor for no reason, which is where I think many people get the idea that those actions are toxic. 
---
Killer chases and kills survivors. Survivors run and escape killers. The game is purposefully set up to conjure feelings of “us vs them”, you are going to get a lot of people who take it way too seriously or lose their cool once in a while, myself included! Just keep playing both sides and you’ll come up with what feels bad to you, what doesn’t, and what wins games and what is more fun. Then you’ll figure out how you want to play.
---
Guaranteed mikan has to much murderer potential to even be a survivor
---
NO ONE ELSE IS CONSIDERING THAT JUST BECAUSE CARL IS DEAD DOESNT MEAN HE CANT BE CHOSEN BY THE ENTITY. JUST LOOK AT BILL
---
That’s a buff

I'm going to miss the map as it is. 4ks are so easy on it.
---
not gonna lie but that shit gave me a heart attack, free medkit tho

WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELL HE AIN'T MY BOY BUT THE TRAPPER IS HEAVY

DEAD HARD INTO A WALL GOT DOWNED BY HIS MACHETE

TRAPPING MY HOOK JUST AS MUCH HE CAN  
---
&gt;!I'll give my firstborn child to Canada for Frank West tbh!&lt;
---
bruh this is shitpost and meming, why are you so toxic
---
No this is what the perk used to be a few months ago...
---
ECT works.
---
Yang Yongxin was controversial because he doesn't use anesthesia. When operated properly, bouts of ETC procedures can cure diseases and mental afflictions that no pills or medicines can.
---
"game addition" is also a real thing.
---
DS (incase i get tunneled)
---
Deliverence (cuz i can't trust my teammates to unhook me in red ranks because everyone is a gen jockey there)
---
Quick and Quet (to hide myself better)
---
and Adrenaline (so i can do a gen and be sure ill be healed when i pop it if its the last one) sometimes when i want to meme i put Head On to go with Quick and Quet to stun the killer they go pretty well together.
---
Yea I looked at it now.
---
Because I'm showing double standards.
---
Well I suppose it’ll have to do
---
I play on PS4 so whatever servers default for me in Massachusetts (US)
---
Like what?
---
If I am chasing a survivor, 3 are on gens.  Hooking them and chasing someone else means one is hooked, one is going for unhook, one is being chased, and only one is still on gens.  They just lost two thirds of gen progression speed.  The kicker is that if I kill someone and we repeat this scenario, then no one is left on gens.  So I am incentivized heavily to kill one person as fast as possible.  Most games it is actually the difference between winning and losing.  So the game heavily encourages and rewards tunneling.
---
Im not too big of a fan of playing wraith but that set up makes him worth dumping bloodpoints into. Even without the silent bell, using the one addon that makes everyone hear your bell so everyone just gets paranoid youre gonna pop out on em
---
first of all, killer is playing with 3 perks instead of 4.
---
you can cleanse the totems, which literally isn't hard. each tile has one possible totem spot and you can predict other totem spots by looking where the others have spawned (most lilely, there are 4 totems around the corners of the map and one near the middle).
---
you can run small game to help you find said totems
---
you can run BT and DS to go for risky saves
---
you can take a rainbow map to help you find the totems
---
you can just fucking escape once the gens are done instead of playing a hero and getting you all killed
---
you can run detective's hunch to help you find totems
---
shall I go on?

"Ooo piece of candy"
---
KILLERS AT HIGH RANKS GET SWF 90% OF THE TIME AND IT SUCKS IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN
---
ALSO GHOST FACE ***SUCK***
---
I would get rid of self care because since healing became slower self caring takes way too long for it to be useful, you end up using up a lot of valuable time. Pharmacy is a really good alternative to self care, with pharmacy you are guaranteed a green medkit out of your first chest which can heal you much faster than self care. It also could work well with your plunders because it lets you loot chest very quick and silently saving even more time.
---
Killer: Doesn't feel obligated to follow fake rules, understands when to "tunnel" or "camp" and how NOED is a big gamble that may not even work 
---
Survivors: TOXIC KILLER KYS 
---
Killer: There's a method. Shut up and observe.
---
Then maybe that's an issue with you and your teammates rather than NOED.
---
This sub has yet to disappoint me. BRAVO
---
Straight up, we play this game for fun. Nothing else. Toxic players, and toxic people, will always exist. I may be the worst DBD in history but if I’m having fun, that’s all I care about. Enjoy yourself and only that. All the bullshit is a minor obstacle.
---
Kinda reminds me of [the album art of Fishing for Fishies.](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ca388c45b41c969c8666970/2:1/w_1000/KingGizzard_FishingForFishies.jpg) Very nice!
---
Because noed has counters. Do totems or deal with it
---
I think you mean the best part!
---
That sequence of events was beautiful
---
Honestly, so many survivors shout “tunneling” when they’re just making bad choices and being obnoxious and I’m over it. I’m not gonna camp and/or repeat hook. That’s a bitch move. But if someone gets unhooked after I’ve hooked another survivor I’m not gonna ignore the first survivor if I come across them right away. If a survivor is just repeatedly trying to follow me around or distract me, they’re tunneling themselves. Especially if it’s their 3rd hook then they’re just being dumb.
---
Exactly. People *don't realize* that there's a practical reason for everything a good killer does. If it doesn't fall in line with their stupid, fake rules? Deal with it.
---
I would LOVE to see Ripley added into the game.
---
It says “Amanda” on the back of the umbrella too😭
---
I actually hate the end game collapse as killer, it's not a real threat to survivors whatsoever, didn't buff killers, and all it did was make the devs nerf every single end game build there was
---
Because you're making baseless generalizations.
---
So true
---
meanwhile the same person \*self-caring for 40 seconds\* "i'M a VaLuAbLe AsSeT oF tHiS tEaM"
---
Well, BHVR, if you insist...
---
well yes, but actually no that random ass medkit spooked me
---
You can't be toxic with Wraith; he's the most wholesome killer.
---
no, it's a fix. no perk should have totally different effects on higher levels
---
It was definitely beautiful from an outsider's perspective 😂
---
That's some serious Head'n'Shoulders ad
---
This. Seems like survivors just expect NOED to be counterable without putting any time or effort (or, God forbid, a perk slot) towards countering it.
---
If a survivor is desperately trying to get you to chase then, ignore them, let them waste time following you around, they're not doing gens while doing that, and to get them to keep doing that, you can pretend a little like you're gonna chase them

Kate Hair Best Hair. As a Kate main, I approve this message. For all you other non-kate masterrace, I will light a candle in your memory. Especially you Nea.

I say yes to Frank West &amp; Shaun.

Ow. She got smacked twice in the head, once by the locker and again by the pallet.
---
Side note: This is why ambush dash is not as viable as simply uncrouching and going "Yippee ki-yay"
---
All you had to do was close the damn hatch CJ
---
What's the problem here? That overcharge worked even when you just tapped the gen?
---
Would you prefer it didn't? And then the perk is rendered useless entirely by gen-tapping?
---
Its dumb, but it's the way the game is.

“Ooo some karma”

Here's the source

Thanks I’ll start running some of them

Wouldn't be surprised if causing anger was their sole goal.
---
I used to have that mindset, but the leagues of trolly survivors have corrupted me. Now, I show no mercy. I live off of salt mail.
---
It's even worse when you're killer, trying to hear the last hidden survivor but all you hear is dramatic end game music
---
Agreed. I'm not the best at survivor but hell, if everyone played both sides like us this community would be that much more tolerable.
---
that's 3 more effort than they put into Ghostface's power.
---
I dont have one I just want to fucking die
---
The Mori’s are broke again lol. You have to be behind them (sorta) you cant be on top of them for whatever reason.
---
I think a lot are people losing connection because the ptb servers are about as stable as a 90 year old's hands
---
How aren't we? You're talking about tunneling, I've said that plenty of times ppl called me tunneler, but they lured me to hooks or for someone saving the hooked one.
---
What Am I supposed to do? let them go? Hell no, if someone unhooks someone front of me, I'll hit the unhooker first, then I'll chase down the unhooked.
---
If u don't wanna be tunneled, hope u don't have potato team.
---
Hopefully
---
Yep. Just spam M1 instead LCTRL
---
Yeah I know I sound like a typical toxic survivor but I’m serious they really need to change it
---
you know content is about to be good if its a nea with the graffiti skin hair
---
Also how is this a repost I made this meme?
---
Nah. It wasn't that. This Hillbilly had BBQ&amp;C and knew where we were most of the time and then you saw the annoying one hit snipe. Wasn't gonna make it out by gens anyways after a while.
---
Juggle obsession. Slug obsession. Run enduring. Swing before the check came up. 
---
It had counters, just nobody wanted to do them
---
The adjective "despicable" implies the man in question did something horrible, abhorrent and unforgivable. 
---
The verb "subjected" suggests the people who underwent the treatment were victims of a scarring, torturous procedure. 
---
Then you ended the sentence by explaining it was ECT. 
---
From a linguistic perspective, the semantic field you created was a negative one. Painting ECT in a bad light is what was done, so I decided to explain that it's not all bad. I don't blame anyone for thinking it's barbaric procedure, most do.
---
Not sure if my comment offended you or not; it's exam season for me so my mind is in the critical thinking mode.
---
Happens more often than you'd think...
---
Seems counterintuitive to add survivors known for their ability to live through unspeakable horrors just to die on a meat hook 85% of the time....the other 15% to some black tendrils exploding from the ground...
---
I'm glad they mentioned updating leatherface

Phasing spirit or nurse

---
For what it's worth I don't use it. I don't have a slot in my build, nor do I get much use out of it because I prefer to slow the game than risk endgame where Survivors are more powerful, especially in numbers. 
---
I use it for meme builds and that's about it.
---
Best wraith moment for me with that bell 60 or so seconds into a match... ding ding... 3 failed gen skill checks. I died of laughter. The timing was just so perfect.
---
Waiting for the inevitable "im trying to sneak around but in dummy thicc" comment
---
If you guys stop considering Beast of Prey for its stain hiding, it is a pretty good perk for point gain. 
---
It essentially guarantees 8k in Chase in every game. I love using this on any build where I'm just trying to get as many points as possible (Distressing / Beast of Prey / BBQ). Does literally nobody else care about point gain?
---
Well he got his wish. A quite bad one.
---
That still is pretty valuable to be honest, especially after a hook resuce
---
Sure. I'm also a beautiful princess
---
It's so easy and so dumb saying "I'm a killer main and I think X" sounds like "I'm not racist I have black friends"...
---
A recording of a youtube video really adds depth to how true it is
---
It's easy to say do totems, but when you've done 4 totems and are still searching for the last one and it's in some crazy ass corner that no one will ever look, and you get free kills after survivors search the whole map for your totem, I dunno man. They could probably tie NOED  to multiple totems and when exit gates are powered, you get 1 stack for each remaining dull on the map. So no dulls done, 5 stacks, 1 done 4 stacks and so on. When you hit a healthy survivor, consume 1 stack to put survivor straight into dying state, hitting an injured survivor doesn't consume stacks. So essentially if no one does totems, you have at least 5 insta-downs. But if survivors do like 3-4 totems, you can't get 4 free kills.
---
Bitch please.
---
I don't think BHVR knows how many dollars I'd give them to be able to play as Shaun voiced by Simon Pegg.
---
We already have that, it's called decisive strike lol
---
Yeah cuz enduring didn't prevent the survivor to slip off killers shoulders and get to the closest loop
---
See the difference?
---
It's borderline content and may be considered risky.
---
Too bad furtive chase is a waste of a perk slot
---
If I recall correctly some time ago I think around when D strike got changed the devs said something along the lines that they felt noed was in a good place and had counters and they were not going to change it.
---
Not saying I agree or disagree but I think the chances of it being changed is pretty slim.
---
Also cleanse totems!?!?!
---
Like a personal borrowed.
---
I agree, protection hits aren’t too hard to take if you play more of a rescue build.
---
So it's going to be useless, thanks devs.
---
Lol
---
I cant really play Plague much since she's broken on PS4. do people really refuse to cleanse that much? like they actually think it's better to have permanent 1 hit downs?
---
It's fine, I have faced countless noed, isn't a big deal. Cleanse before or after it activates, that's it
---
People keep parroting the fact that the PTB is a test yet they aren't using the common sense that they released Ghostface as buggy as this. This proves they didn't even look at Ghostface to see if he was working as intended, and just fat fingered him onto the PTB.
---
I was praying this was a video from your channel. More DbD videos, pretty please! I'd love to see more Killer Guides! You're great!
---
Good.  
---
The changed MoM in the PTB is a buffed version imo.
---
Game ends when everyone is dead, so I am not sure what you are asking
---
Ooooooo owo
---
What drawback would there be for closing the hatch?  
---
You pretty much get 250 deviousness bloodpoints, and extra sacrafice points if someone's still not sacrificed.
---
This is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks for the info!
---
When they’re hooked and dying, no chance of escaping.
---
Something to help in chases would be good. 
---
I saw you say the Spirit Fury combo is no good for you so I would try Bamboozle or Brutal Strength etc. 
---
Nurses range is about the same as Trappers heartbeat so not sure how effective that is for you?
---
I don’t like using NoeD personally so those are the 2 I would replace with something.
---
Fair, but definitely not for me. Getting David's adept achievement almost gave me a stroke. Not fun being tunneled because you're a one hit down.
---
1, I play both dumbass.
---
2, Half this fucking sub probably thinks survivors move at 300% speed.
---
3, I did. All I ever hear about are "LOOPS!" so apparently every 5 feet is a loop in all the maps.
---
Yeah, go for it
---
TPB memes are best memes.
---
what were the changes?
---
Oh. Didn't see that. Nvm then
---
&gt; The adjective "despicable" implies the man in question did something horrible, abhorrent and unforgivable. 
---
Because the man did do something I, and many others, perceive as unforgivable.
---
&gt; The verb "subjected" suggests the people who underwent the treatment were victims of a scarring, torturous procedure. 
---
Because having something done to you without your consent is oft a form often a scarring, negative experience, and the pretenses of the situation call for it being that way.
---
&gt; Then you ended the sentence by explaining it was ECT. 
---
Because it was the form of procedure his patients went through under his questionable practice.
---
 &gt; From a linguistic perspective, the semantic field you created was a negative one.
---
Because that was the intent, except that [unlike your interpretation] the negative field was intended for the specific set of circumstances. It is not painting ECT in a bad light, it is underlying the unique set of circumstances as abhorrent because they are. Someone taking ECT as being bad from this conversation is pure interpretation on their part.
---
nothing was said in specifics
---
This matches up with my experience looting chests. 
---
Nice job.
---
Idk, this is probably the information I’m looking for. Idk much about bloodpoint values or how any of the emblems work
---
But do you tunnel tho?
---
I feel like the devs will mess this up some how or just ditch some of the changes and keep others. My hope is they manage to make him good but not op
---
3 protection hits are simply too many for the perk to have any consistency whatsoever. The perk will fade into (semi-)obscurity like too many other perks, when it was the first meta-relevant survivor perk to be released in ages. Between this and vault mechanics being messed with again next patch, as well as Ghostface and his perks being grossly underwhelming, I'm really not excited for the game right now. For now, I'm drying my tears with Resilience and Spine Chill that will finally again affect window vault speed, and the fact that we will get to use Furtive Chase on Freddy for roughly a month and a half.
---
I actually had fun with David’s adept, Quentin’s on the other hand...
---
No it doesn't, I've tested it
---
funny meme still tho
---
addons? or a buff?
---
Truly one of my favorite killers.. The ability to hook a toxic player then vomit directly in their face is so wonderfully disrespectful. &lt;3
---
In my experience they tend to DC if caught first
---
If it’s the full outfit, I don’t like either honestly. I do like Joes black outfit tho and both of his knives.   
---
I don’t like the masks I guess
---
It isn't, they've said as much, and it seems it's much better in the PTB for both sides, so that's good news.
---
Gens doin, you?
---
They calculated base on one perk slot, in other words they never specifically stated that the 21% was for the chance of self care appearing in the first slot, AS WELL AS A 21% chance of it appearing in the second slot, ect. They just said that it was run 21% of the time. In other words, 84% total chance of seeing the perk run in any one survivor.
---
An escape and a free medkit, nice.
---
I think it would’ve been somewhere between 5 and 10 cuz I’m a red rank and we had 2 purples and a green, maybe we’ll see you in the future ;) lmao
---
Yeah the perk is fully dead now. Basically in the state it was in when they first announced they wanted to change MoM to protection hits and everyone was morning it. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. Back to the DH+BL+Adrenaline mega combo.
---
Yeah, that’s how I see it too. Makes for a boring and super inconsistent perk then
---
 Thanks for asking
---
Dying 😂
---
I know you weren't.
---
“Heyyyy sisters, welcome back to my channel!!!”
---
Considering that The Pig can crouch in stealth and it is not being broken by spotting by survivors I suggest to simply remove mechanic when survivors can break Ghostface's stealth by spotting him. In addition I suggest this: when survivor sees Ghostface, expose meter will not increase for all survivors but it swill will not break his stealth.
---
&gt;3 protection hits are simply too many for the perk to have any consistency whatsoever. The perk will fade into (semi-)obscurity like too many other perks, when it was the first meta-relevant survivor perk to be released in ages.

---
At least they are trying to fix things to make him better at all.
---
This happened to me with Leatherface when I DCed from a game while using his splinter
---
Isn’t that like 70% of killer powers?
---
Gives you less points and is dependent on survivors not breaking dull totems (which they usually do)
---
Thrill also compliments a defensive playstyle, so it has another purpose.
---
Niiiiice
---
Legion has a stand now
---
Speaking about The Walking Dead, what would you think about Clementine, Lee or Kenny?
---
Just did all the totems in a game got face camped, lovely.
---
And just breaking pallets you slide over is very underwhelming for an UR tier addon. Legion’s addons are already teetering useless especially with how the Cooldown ones are practically mandatory.
---
They don't change anything from the ptb though
---
It’s a joke from the Ash vs Evil dead series where he says “I’m an alone wolf”
---
Ghostface moves at 4.6m/s. Survivors move at 4m/s. The difference in speed is 0.6m/s.
---
It takes 4 seconds to stalk someone to expose them for 16s. If the survivor, at melee range, literally just runs in a straight line, even accounting for a lunge, Ghostface *still* cannot hit them before exposed wears off.
---
Moving at 1m/s while stalking for 4 seconds means the survivor gets 12m of distance before exposed. 12/.6=20 seconds.
---
Yesssssssssss.
---
Safe Hooks were far too easy to get, in addition to the perk being able to activate when fully healthy.
---
Now survivors have to work for it with body blocks, and it'll only activate when they are injured like it should. Great change. Killers, rejoice.
---
Those hands are on point! ... Great work!
---
Ok! I am assuming that you are trying to make a good build that is quite good but always know that you don't have to follow the meta, or what anyone says. *You* bought this game, you can use any perk you want. (Also I am assuming you only have the characters the game comes with on PC)
---
I will give some suggestions to use, but
---
[Self care](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Self-Care), but note that as you get better in chases it is not always essential to heal up, but for now keep healing up
---
[Iron will](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Iron_Will), it is an amazing perk- 10/10
---
[Adrenaline](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Adrenaline) Absolutely amazing and fun perk, I run this almost all the time
---
Then the exhaustion perks:
---
[Dead Hard](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dead_Hard) This is an extremely hard to learn perk which requires amazing timing and game sense, though *in my opinion* it is the best exhaustion perk.
---
[Balanced Landing](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Balanced_Landing)
---
I would recommend this one since the character has another perk I think you would like, and it is easy to use and very effective
---
[Lithe](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Lithe) I am not a fan of Lithe, but it is quite friendly and useful. Note: This perk is from Feng Min, which is a DLC on PC, but on Console she comes with the game.
---
[Sprint Burst](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Sprint_Burst) I am not a fan of this perk because of the need to walk, but when paired with the perk Urban ~~Immersion~~ Evasion it can be quite good.
---
Notable mention is [Bond](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bond) and [Decisive strike](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Decisive_Strike) since they are in the shop
---
But here are some *immersive* options if you want to hide
---
[Urban Evasion](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Urban_Evasion) this perk is the best for being immersed, earning its nickname "Urban Immersion"
---
Iron will as said before
---
[Spine Chill](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Spine_Chill) Amazing perk for almost any play-style
---
[Alert](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Alert), Dark Sense, and Empathy are all great for knowing where the killer is, but Dark Sense is definitely the weakest.
---
[Kindred](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Kindred) is good, but only use it if it is level three imo
---
[We'll Make It](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/We'll_Make_It) Again, great perk
---
Don't know how to fit this in here but [Borrowed Time](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Borrowed_Time) is an amazing perk as well!
---
There are many amazing perks as well on DLC survivors, so keep that in mind. I would most likely level up Nea or Meg first depending on if you want Adrenaline and Sprint Burst, or Balanced Landing and Urban Evasion. Jake for Iron Will after both of those would be good as well
---
OHHHH SO THAT'S WHY I HAVE BEEN FACING SO MANY POTATOES
---
What. The actual. Fuck.
---
&gt;Because the man did do something I, and many others, perceive as unforgivable.
---
If you are going to say a certain man did a bad thing, then say in the same sentence say said man did ECT people will assume ECT is that bad thing. Yes, it is pure interpretation, such is the beauty of language; you can indirectly forward a message. But it's not mutually exclusive from being logical.
---
he can camp for all 5 gens if it's gonna take your team more than 2 min to do a single gen lmao
---
This is fucking epic I need it
---
I like the TT Series but they wouldn't bring in the cash like Rick. That and the fact that TT is kinda boned now unfortunately so if BHVR did want some Walking Dead stuff they'd have to go to SkyBound for it and would most likely opt for Rick.
---
I was able to spend shards on the shrine before and after the reset for bloodpoints but was only able to play him once. After that I just played as survivor and tried to see how others preformed as him instead.
---
I'll try it out! Thanks bro!
---
Thanks bro, I'll be sure to try it out!

---
Makes me think of Petscop
---
Im glad they removed unhook as way of stacking, this would make almost everyone just throw themselfs for unhooks and ultimately make playing survivor harder since nobody will do gens ans go for unhooks.
---
What if they’d make a chapter with survivors from the game and the comics because they wouldn’t really have a killer? I don’t know if it’d be possible, just saying.
---
&gt; play fair
---
Define.   Your general attitude implies that killers must obey a made up "honor code", yet survivors are free to use any and all available game mechanics to their advantage.   You reek of the incompetence of a salty survivor main.
---
I literally just said I don’t repeat hook if someone just got unhooked. If a survivor farms someone right by me I go after the farmer. Someone getting hooked right away and not being able to play the rest of the game sucks, I’ve had it happen to me plenty of times so that’s why I don’t do it as a killer.
---
Ah, that’s my bad. I haven’t watched much of the evil dead franchise so I didn’t catch that
---
IDK I would just camp if the survivors are taking Gens too fast and are just too organized especially if Im playing as a killer I dont normally play.
---
Yea it's a small little reference, still wish he had a chainsaw hand
---
You asked for it, so here it is. /u/SPIN01ST
---
No, you will get second Myers. We need similar but different ability.
---
there are moments when you get points for "PROTECTION" while taking a hit without getting a WGLF or MoM stack. [Like here](https://youtu.be/5YXorjWrnVk?t=216)
---
Yummy yummy is coming in your tummy
---
Oh yeah I've heard. I was referring to broken status (as in it is good for her for people to be broken, but cleansing makes her insane)
---
t bags faster than the pig
---
Hey, people say the new Legion is absolute trash but I love him. Actually scored my first perfect game with him today, granted I’m only at rank 8. People let tiers effect how they look at things way too much in my opinion. I main Legion, and have rather good results with him, however, I’m absolute ass at Hillbilly
---
I don't know what kind of deals those licensed characters normally get, but it seems unlikely. Especially because technically he is an original character and the only licensed thing about him is the mask.
---
If people are planning on maining Ghost Face already they must be masochists.
---
To be fair, it’s only common knowledge if you’ve watched the show or been active on this subreddit since he came out. Definitely a show worth watching if you haven’t though :D
---
The interview was cool and all, but what was that Ghostface trying to hit in the last clip?
---
If I’m unfamiliar with the reference, my first thought isn’t going to be ‘is that a reference’ but instead ‘that must be a typo’
---
Yet I assume you downvoted my post/comments, if you didn’t fair enough.
---
M’powers
---
who else was?
---
Eek barba derkel? That’s a pretty fucked up Ooh la la
---
Disconnecting players is a real thing, but there also happens to be a game breaking disconnect bug right now that involuntarily disconnects survivors randomly during the game. Perhaps some of your disconnects were because of that, and not ragequit?
---
That’d be awesome lol
---
That pig charm completes this
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T WAIT UNTIL THE SPARKS ARE DONE YOU COULD POTENTIALLY GET A LOT OF SKILL CHECKS BACK TO BACK TO BACK AND MAKE IT REGRESS FURTHER.
---
I'm saying it now.
---
Ghostface is about to be worse than Freddy and Leather face combined, with a sprinkle of legion.
---
I know right, it's great isn't it?
---
That’d have been awesome. The only movie I’ve seen is Army of Darkness because my cousin thinks it’s the best lol
---
How do people still get surprised that this exists? This is standard content at this point
---
I’m so fucking bummed they just reverted everything. Changing to unsafe hooks was such a great concept.
---
&gt;there are moments when you get points for "PROTECTION" while taking a hit without getting a WGLF or MoM stack. 
---
&gt;[Like here](https://youtu.be/5YXorjWrnVk?t=216)
---
Thanks for the footage. 
---
I stand corrected about it not being buggy but the scenarios I mentioned are guaranteed to give you stacks, which usually would be the way to get your stacks rather than doing what Tru3 did.
---
I don't think it would be hard for devs to fix that since it clearly shows that he got the event.
---
Progressive of BHVR to include a character for horny boys I guess
---
Looks like geras from mortal kombat a little
---
Yeah speaking as a Mandy main, just uncrouching is my preferred method of sneak
---
It's a bit different,
---
But I want to see Brutus and Weasel make an appearance in Dead By Daylight, the characters from Mob of the Dead. I think it would be cool, with our first zombie killer too.
---
&gt;Instead, it was that ECT was performed on minors for a not well understood addiction at the time.
---
This is what I've been trying to explain to you. The issue shouldn't be that he did ECT on minors, or that it was done on a not well understood addiction at the time (ECT cures many not well understood issues).
---
My issue is that he did ECT wrong. Using your own words, if that is supposed to be the take away from the original message, then it's still the wrong message in my opinion.
---
I mean what can you expect. She’s got liquid physics when literally no game BHVR has ever worked on involved liquid physics. It certainly isn’t surprising the physics and hitboxes of it are godawful
---
I’d be very touched if that was true, but it’s just not true!
---
I bought the cowboy hat with shards to play him sometimes. I main Feng too. Cowboy Jake is sexy!
---
Sounds like they just wanted a quick game of fuckery
---
“You guys are getting cleansed for this?”
---
It’s fun just to let all that salt soak in
---
I’ve only seen Army of Darkness but I plan to watch the whole series sometime soon, i have a lot of classic horror series i need to see lol
---
Played about 3 games by now. I’m rank 8 I break all the totems and 1 of 2 options happen I get face camped or left on the hook and no teammates save me. Then I get told that I’m useless for doing the totems, yet I get told I’m being useless when I do gens or I run the killer around because I didn’t do the totems. What am I meant to do?
---
Crying about DS in 2019 yikes
---
Which is my point, the perk won’t be used now. They killed it.
---
Saun would be a great addition!
---
it's when you press the left of the menue buttons on the controller (don't know how it's called)
---
If the term “M1 Killer” was in the dictionary there would be a picture of ghostface next to it
---
Are these for sale? Make me some and I'll PayPal you in a heartbeat. I ***NEED*** these
---
Are you hitting the double window button opposite of the start button? That inverts the controls in game and you have to press it again to switch back.
---
Didnt even need to watch it this scene was great and this is my 2nd favorite show of all time. Brilliant dbd apllication
---
Leatherface is the best killer 
---
It's because people don't know how to deal with his invisibility at lower ranks
---
PS4 touching the touch pad inverts the controls, so it’s likely a button you’re pressing! I could be wrong due to Xbox not PS4, but if there’s a button for one there’s likely a button for the other.
---
Some of the most wholesome art and posts come out of this game sub and It makes me glad :)
---
dude I came here to reeeee but this has already been answered
---
uhhh fuck this is awkward
---
I don’t exactly know what the button is called but it’s in the middle of the controller under the main Xbox logo button, the button with the 2 overlapping squares on it. When you press it it inverts your controls until you press it again, I have no idea why it’s like this
---
He is the best killer.
---
Between^ ranks^ 18-20^
---
Agreed. I played a lot of legion because he was fun and I still do play him. To me, when I play a killer it’s more about fun than effectiveness. It’s why I find low tier killers to be really fun. I’m super pumped for Ghostface because he looks fun
---
Sometimes there's downsides to rushing your opponent out of the match. More times than not, it's in your best interest. The others?  Well, you made your decision not to do totems.
---
Yay another dead d tier survivor perk
---
Idk, I killed some rank 4s in one of these rounds pretty quick.
---
Just put ghostface in a "only good for teabag" tier lmao
---
Dstrike would be even better right now if the dang timer didn't keep counting down after the survivor went into dying state. Can't tell u how annoying it is going down after getting unhooked at about 1/4th of the timer is left and killer leaves u until timer depletes.. ridiculous.
---
Idk what it was but i guess it fixed itself cause im finding lobbies instantly now, hope you are too.
---
The fog is strong with this one
---
If you've done 4 totems, that's 4 areas of the map you can eliminate from your search if you're intent on cleansing NOED when it activates.
---
That's freaking amazing great job😍
---
Amazinnggg
---
We uh need a bigger sample size than 1 game to remove him from Freddy tier...
---
That wasn't in the movies, it was in Episode 4, Season 1 of Ash vs the Evil Dead.
---
I only know which episode it's in specifically because I've only seen five of them :(
---
They are like slinkies on her chest lol.
---
I love this. I just found Samination a few days ago due to a friend and I live it! We reference it all the time when we play
---
Nah, nurse is being the breadwinner and is actually getting kills, while trapper hasn't had a killing job for months so he stays at home doing taxes and other jobs.
---
I was on a streak, Iridescents and golds everywhere.
---
This is the kind of post I can’t upvote enough. But I can upvote and add a comment which has no added value to the discussion!
---
This is so true like, I cant see any other reasons survivors going into the PTB other than getting the feel of what Ghostface will be like when he comes out live or perhaps perk balances but I mean like, idk what other killer you would get when majority of the time it will be Ghostface.
---
Left behind is the WORST perk in the game now, it needs help
---
Coulda sworn it was also like in the beginning of Army of Darkness
---
I like Devil-May-Care, I think it's the best skin in the game hands down.
---
Could have used some non-diaper pants, though.
---
? Even then the ptb as a whole is unstable
---
Had a game that I was the only survivor who didn't DC, the killer let me open the gates after we communicated through squats. 10/10 would play with that guy again.
---
The only true stereotype I've run into is that I've yet to play with a David that wasnt a complete monkey and got himself killed within the first 5 minutes
---
If you don't know, Behavior's other game, Deathgarden, actually has a Terminator DLC. So it's very possible they could get the rights to Sarah Conner.
---
Devs, you know I love you.
---
But god DAMNIT stop uploading videos to Youtube with a 30 minute wait timer before the actual content starts.
---
I agree on that actually. I feel like the idea of of it nice but the percentages are like naaah
---
Been playing Scratched Mirror Myers for a couple days now and love tearing through the survivors.
---
You can always platinum it ;-D
---
Seems like a monkeys paw wish
---
Plunderers is op if you're a solo survivor. I've gotten many keys that I escaped with mid match in games I would've died otherwise.
---
I just want Benedict Baker, man
---
Pretty sure all of these are super meta (with the exception of lithe. That's only kinda meta). I forgot that they changed mettle of man to protection hits but it can still help you not get downed so easily for your altruism.
---
LOL, that’s super funny. It was a live Q&amp;A so they wanted to give ppl time to catch the stream :D
---
I wanted to do that xD And I'm happy Hag is top tier, her basement is a death sentence :D
---
he's bugged to hell right now so it's kinda hard to determine what's intentional and what's not
---
They should make a Dead By Daylight card game lmao
---
Ash says hi.
---
And that's not going into Bill or David King.
---
Iron Maiden OP
---
Why are you being downvoted.  As if this wasn't irony lol
---
Im absolutely sure of that. 
---
Started playing 1-2 weeks ago and had absolutely no problems with losing connection. Played at least 30 games without problems. But today? Its outraging and literally unplayable, it happens 3 out of 4 matches. 
---
Also one big problem is the ingame lags due to server problems. They should really fix it asap. I was okay with all that negative points of the game one week ago, but whats happening today is a nogo.
---
probably because the rest of the team was shit. no matter how good a single player is if the rest of the team sucks theyre gonna have a bad time
---
You ever seen Scary Movie 1?
---
Lol only if you make it so
---
Yeah, I just don't get it.  It's their game, their schedule.  There's zero reason at all to release Ghostface in his current state, especially when they know he's broken.  They have to be aware that releasing him is going to result in the DLC page getting review bombed, which means it's not going to sell well.  They're shooting themselves in the foot deliberately for no discernible reason!
---
Happy cake day, also~
---
R1 to prestige
---
Yup,  because when they activate this trap, the phantasm make them run into the corner instead of upstairs. This is the best Hag's trap in the basement ;)
---
OwO
---
There was sooo much salt in the game and this sub during prime DS days. I almost miss it in a way.
---
At least im not alone. Play on Xbox btw. 
---
Btw one week ago, when i started playing, it was totaly fine. No lags, no server problems, it worked beautiful. Idk what happened.
---
We all know the real reason they made ghostface like this in the PTB with these issues, so we can all enjoy the memes in the reddit forums. Enjoying it atm.
---
The game is peer to peer meaning it isn't hosted on a server. So the connection is based on the killer. Dedicated servers should hopefully fix all that. If you have not watched the 3 year anniversary stream you should they mention breifly disconnects and doing something about them once dedicated servers are out. Apparently once they have that server acting as a 3rd party they can do something about better punishments. 
---
I don't know if or how they could tell between a connection drop or crash vs hitting leave game.
---
But I think if you hit leave game you should have at least a 10-15 cooldown before you can host as killer or play survivor. And after that it should go up and eventually result in temp bans and after that perma bans.
---
To deal with those who pull the cord or turn off their internet or close app the first time or 2 in a certain period nothing happens and then if it become frequent start treating them like D/C. 
---
Also they will have to track those who struggle and die on first hook a lot too in some way.
---
It is a tall order and I don't know if possible but I can hope.
---
Right now the worst I know for disconnects is apparently soft bans but I've also never heard of anyone actually getting that punishment. 
---
This is all just me dreaming and for those who say things like people will quit them game and so on my argument is we don't need those kind of players they ruin it for others and drive others to uninstall the game so I think losing then would inprove the health and playerbase overall.
---
I love this game its always changing and balancing and yes often frustratingly broken. Those I can live with given they keep working on it. The damn disconnects almost every match is killing it for me.
---
This is all just a filthy casuals opinion however.
---
I've been seeing this idea more and more the past few days. Where are all these people that NEVER cleanse against Plague? I play her a lot and I get corrupt purge... .pretty much every game.
---
It’s just missing Myers in the trees looking too anxious to come say hi
---
Woah woah I sure came into the wrong side of the reddit forums.
---
Just make him unable to stalk in a chase.
---
This happened to me yesterday and I thought I was going crazy
---
r/youareverystupid
---
Play With Your Food is amazing too.
---
Let’s see your Broken-ass escape my chase with 15% extra movement speed.
---
&gt; I swear all you killer mains act like maps are nothing but loops that survivors can be in in 3 seconds. Fucking babies I SWEAR
---
&gt; maps are nothing but loops that survivors can be in in 3 seconds
---
&gt; but loops that survivors can be in in 3 seconds
---
english
---
Guide or link?
---
They mentioned hag, said nurse was high on their priority list, said the chainsaw boys, and that’s all I can remember
---
Puking on Survivors butts is the ultimate power move 😩👌
---
Says the one who cant string a sentence together.
---
It's a PS4 Skin, I've bought from a brazilian store site.
---
But that's what I said, if you've done 4 totems and NOED still pops, you know which areas of the map you don't have to search. If you decide to hunt for it at that point(and I probably wouldn't, I'd take my chances) it should be a really quick search even assuming it's only you whose looking for it. Even if other survivors joining the hunt don't know where you've been cleansing and might search an area you've been to, that's still at least another pair of eyes, and they're still not going to search the areas they've been to. 
---
I cleanse totems in my matches, and more often than not NOED still activates if the killer was running it, but it's *much* easier to mitigate how much value they get out of it by doing the work early and just remembering where you cleansed.
---
Did you unhook in front or near the killer or if you dropped pallets as soon as you got to them, thus wasting the pallet, could be considered sandbagging. If you didn't do either of these, they're probably just salty.

&gt; 1. The addition of 60 more screenshots to a pool of previously 330 Plunderer's screenshots (17% more data points) only shifted percentages in the results tables by 1% at most. Thus, the current values should be close enough to the truth and more screenshots are unlikely to significantly change the results.
---
I think it might be more than just a rough estimate...
---
Im not saying anything kiddo r/woooosh
---
Only one survivor can be exposed at a time? When i was playing i thought when the survivor couldnt be stalked anymore that meant they were exposed; in which case i had two survivors fully red
---
He launches on the 18th. Changes won't be seen in PTB, though.
---
**it's literally in the picture**
---
Well pig can teabag too except she can also do it while a bear traped survivor is on a hook
---
Obviously. Free Bloodpoints.
---
Depends on how close the killer was. They can hear the locker close even if you don't run into it.
---
I listen to that song every day. Thank you for reminding me to listen to it again.
---
And that achievement is?
---
I think the devs put themselves way too far into a corner, trying to make a killer as "fair" as possible to play against. 
---
Why can't Ghostface just be a stealth killer, who does exactly what you described and once the survivors figure out who they are up against (just like with every other decent killer) adjust by going "Oh shit, we have to carefully keep checking our surroundings now at all times!" 
---
No, instead they add a sound cue to his ability (before anything even happens), so the survivors know that he is there and have his power be entirely canceled out by them randomly looking around and have any progress on the ability expire by almost everything. 
---
If they had that mindset to this degree earlier, you can bet that Myers would've had some sort of cue build in that makes him easily noticeable on level 1. What I don't get about this is that killers are not meant to be "fair" (balanced yes, but not fair), they are fucking killers! Just let them have their abilities and gimmick and balance those directly, instead of tacking on multiple safety features to make them more convenient to play against.
---
You can play this little mind game with any of the older killers and think how they would look if their abilities were adjusted similarly. The Trapper's traps would probably emit some ominous sound or glint when a survivor gets close enough, no extra perk required, etc.
---
This meme doesn't even fit for the survivors lol
---
i just KYS if I get hooked and my teammates aren't doing shit. Why draw out a losing game. I play to have fun.. not have to fight against a killer and teammates.. it's a 1 v 1 v 3 at that point.
---
The one about sacrificing all the survivors before the exit gates are powered.
---
Those are dream pallets. Nea borrowed some from Freddy and upgraded.
---
doesn't running a bunch of exhaustion perks conflict with each other tho?
---
Pig is a qt
---
The Ghost Face *
---
At high ranks a Plague doesn't need Corrupt tbh
---
The Pig has what I would refer to as combat stealth, where she can enter stealth as the chase approaches a loop and use that stealth lunge attack to break the loop and beat the pallet. Ghostface does *not* have combat stealth, you're supposed to enter stealth before finding a survivor and then approach from a distance. The loud noise from entering stealth is to enforce that.
---
Well, least I’ll finally eat something
---
What rank are you? Because it's pretty rare that Survivors will cleanse at Green/Purple and Red Ranks.
---
Psych! They’re removing it for live. For a second you thought the devs were actually going to let survivors keep a decent second chance perk.
---
The only time I could see this being useful is if the survivor being chased is on their last hook. Aside from that, play stupid games win stupid prizes.
---
I play both but play survivor way more. DC’s should have a harsh punishment, I stated that in my first comment both are as bad as each other. On PS4 survivor lobbys can vary from a minute upto ten so lobby dodging is a real issue, you did not consider other platforms obviously. Works both ways.
---
Haha, I'm glad you like them. xD I don't sell them, but I do give them away during my weekly follower giveaways on Twitch. (RoryDiesALot). These are ultra-rare prizes, but I like to try to do at least six giveaways a week!
---
Thank you so much!
---
I agree! I want to make some DBD tarot cards next, but it'll have to wait!
---
You can change the individual struggle key?
---
I’m trying to sneak mast the guards
---
It's bad business to cater primarily to your minority, and they can please the most amount of customers by keeping a lower ceiling on new killers. They're also probably concerned with DC rates, there's no point in creating killers that players will sandbag each other to get out of facing. It's a pretty cynical outlook but I can't blame them, their hands are tied.
---
Playing as alien would be SWEEEET. Although idk about the ability. I’ve thought about it for a bit and spitting acid isn’t cannon/too close to plague. Being able to run on walls/ceiling might be busted. Running at faster speed is just legion. So I’ll just leave it to BHVR and hope they add it. 
---
:3
---
Yeah, once got a game where everyone played Dwight on The Game... somehow all but one of us made it out alive.
---
She Dummy Thicc
---
Still hot. I would do.
---
I just use a macro.
---
&gt; And alot of those "crutch" perks are either A, completely worthless to any killer with half a brain, or B, basically necessary to live because of the super buffed killers thanks to the killer mains wanting to 4K while eating a sandwich
---
You use hyperbole in every one of your points, because you don't have any logical arguments at all here.
---
As for crutch perks, only a bad survivor would say that they need crutch perks to survive. A good survivor can escape regardless of how good or bad their perks are, its just that 90% of the survivor playerbase who are bad.
---
Anyway, if you think plague is strong, do start playing her at red ranks, i bet you will get crushed when all 4 survivors are sick as being sick doesn't impede them from completing objectives
---
Just play the game. The player base of this game is full of whiny bitches. Play how you want. If theyre assholes just move on to the next match. If you dont wanna deal with noed, do totems to help yourself later on. Sounds like ya had shit teammates but unless the killer sat there and watched you cleanse all the totems i dont think thats why you got camped
---
U could also just make a macro to toggle spamming space
---
i get wanting to change the perk from its current state I guess, and I was on board for what the PTB was offering because it offered a new play style rather than just an probably eventual free hit escape... 
---
but now they expect you to get 3 protection hits in order to only activate it while again inured ??? The perk won’t even get 3 stacks in most games in that state to activate it 🙄
---
Oh yeah the devs care sooo much about survivors and they hate killers it's as if they didn't nerf every thing a survivor can do.
---
He's viable at red ranks too. As viable as everyone who isnt nurse/spirit anyway.
---
this was awful but at least u tried
---
Yeah that would work too. I'm sure someone sooner or later will create a gif or picture with this meme :D
---
See, this is how you collect data from the game. 
---
Not by doing shit like “yea I played 1000 games of pig here are my totally none made up numbers”
---
while i agree with doctor’s placement,  i agree for a different reason 
---
he was swooped up basically immediately after high school and the cia recruited him _because_ he was brilliant
---
the cia didn’t need to follow protocol and i won’t even get into the whole civil rights era theory i have either
---
Thank you this is claudes on a daily basis
---
It wasn't intentional really.
---
He's not trash you just don't know how to use his ability. Id know because I play freddy at red ranks, he's as viable as everyone who isnt nurse/spirit
---
DEAD ASS thought this was a Hearthstone Mathematics DBD video
---
I’m no expert with doctor but hex:ruin is good. Also survilence and nurses calling are pretty decent.
---
I mean a game where everyone picked different male survivors.
---
Now im wondering why someone just randomly left a yellow medkit there.
---
Even got a prize at the end, nice
---
The only thing I like are the decals for the light bar on the controller.
---
I also think the bame is, but the fact that its 2 words could be not
---
Oh no I got looped guys remove pallets from the game I'm not a bad killer survivors are just OP
---
are these cut like normal playing cards? It'd be pretty cool to practice cardistry with a DbD deck!
---
Instant breaking pallets useless... Yikes I never run cooldown ones seem to do fine. Legion in a good place right now. IMO
---
XD
---
Oh yeah the devs care so much about survivors,it's as if they didn't nerf everything a survivor can do. But they hate killers
---
BEAUTIFUL
---
I think they did that just to fuck with us.
---
Ok
---
This is false. Billy moves at 92% movement speed while revving. The wiki states so. https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Movement_Speeds#Hillybilly_Movement_Speed
---
Yes please, I use a controller on PC and my joysticks are ground to dust.
---
Then they need to unfuck with us :P
---
Pig stalking Tapp on The Game just felt suitable while looking for easter eggs =P
---
But yeah, she's a very fun killer to play. I enjoy ambush/stalking type killers.
---
Little did you know It was haunting grounds.
---
Ty, i've spent alot of time to put it lol Worth it!
---
You should not run Corrupt Intervention and Hex: Ruin, You will have only two perks after the first 2-3 minutes of the game which is kind of a problem. You do get a good headstart though but survivors can utilize the time the gens are blocked from Corrupt Intervention to break your Hex: Ruin totem
---
Additionally, all of these perks do not give the Plague an advantage when chasing, for Pop goes the Weasel you gotta catch atleast one guy first which is tough without atleast Enduring
---
You're months behind if you think decisive is an issue
---
Because games don't receive content ratings based on mechanics, but overall content.  
---
If you made a game where you played a cute fluffy sheepdog who had to track down four mischievous sheep in a meadow, catch them, and carry them to the naughty corner for a time-out, you'd get an E rating. Replace the meadow with an abandoned hospital, the sheep with human beings, and the sheepdog with some deformed yokel swinging a chainsaw, and you'll get a higher rating to reflect the content you're marketing. Same mechanics, completely different theme, completely different audience.
---
I’d be all for this it’s just that they will probably make the character models look like misshapen clay in order to avoid paying the actors. And people will make memes about how much the killer/survivor sucks and how UnBaLaNcEd they are... poor devs they can’t win ;-;
---
Ok I think we might be thinking about a different sound effect, which noise are you talking about?
---
Hot take: prayer beads should be an ultra rare addon and the one that lets u see blood while invis should take its place as a purple addon.
---
Imo tho spirits fun af on both sides if she doesnt have prayer beads on. Her invis introduces a lot of cool mindgames that other killers cant reproduce (again, on both sides)
---
Hooking two people?  Idk how you think that’s possible, that shot is rare ESP against swf
---
Ouch
---
1, wtf are YOU talking about?
---
2, being good does nothing if you're farmed/camped/tunnulled.
---
3, Plague will do fine if the PLAYER is good. Especially since some morons let themselves die in 3 hits instead of 9
---
Ah! Spooky survivor!
---
Not really, it happens to me all the time and I face a lot if SWF groups
---
The game knew you did so bad to where you start owing bloodpoints to the entity. What have you done to yourself.
---
i recommend either playing as the spirit for a couple of matches (to learn her weaknesses), or if that's not possible, watch a few videos from her perspective. 
---
know thy enemy
---
What did the generators do to you oh my lord lol
---
I don't agree with OP but this rebuttal is just kinda obnoxious to see all the time. Cleansing totems is VERY tedious and also boring, if it's on a map where totem placement isnt bad (like the game) youll probably spend more time looking for them then even cleansing them. Furthermore, theres also no totem counter. Youre playing with randoms? Pray that theyre helping you get totems. To top it all off, there's no guarentee they even have noed, meaning you wasted your whole match cleansing totems that did literally nothing. It's a very unpleasant experience.
---
Normal Spirit is atleast tolerable. Her addons make the game jokingly easy for the killer and I RARELY play against a spirit who isn’t running add ons. Prayer Beads are broken.
---
Both him entering/leaving night shroud and the one he makes when moving while stealthed
---
Make sure you add the "special sauce" gobble gobble.
---
Rush me ;-;
---
Oof I feel that
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
Yep LOL
---
Legit had to dc out of game just now. Due to an swf which was two smurfs and two purple ranks....
---
I have played as the Spirit. Quite frankly I hate the play style given she’s built around proxy camping with her teleport. And although you can argue that point, that is all I see her used for in games. Combine proxy camping/3 genning with Prayer Beads and the game is impossible for survivors.
---
Was attempting to play the doctor (I suck someone help) anyway I got lucky and got my first hook when the exit gates were powered, and the entire team came to try and grab them and I mind gamed them and we played ring around hook, they’d take one off and I’d replace them with their saviour. Anyway I learned you can shock survs out of the savior animation and just shocked and shocked until EGC hit. I got two kills by doing this. Even tho I got wrecked the rest of the game
---
Man they just really want to make use of that cool ass that he makes when stealthed but they have to realize that a stealth killer making a loud obnoxious sound is completely counterintuitive.
---
Hmm, a survivor moving around slows down the meter from filling but doesn't cancel the stealth completely. I like it. First time I've seen such a suggestion.
---
How slow would the progression be? It's currently 4 seconds to fill the meter. Are we talking like.. half the progression speed for a max of 8 seconds if the survivor is moving?
---
&gt; 3, Plague will do fine if the PLAYER is good. 
---
Plague relies on a survivor being stupid and cleansing, otherwise your shit, so yeah.
---
Killer is reliant on survivor playing the game badly, the killer skill does not really matter
---
Understand it yet? 
---
You can't go and force someone to cleanse, to get your Corrupt Purge
---
One shots are great, but you have nothing to help chase, your power to help you chasing relies on survivors entirely
---
Thereforth, not a good killer, just a boring low / mid tier 
---
But you don't understand that, because you barely play killer, atleast i play survivor lots to understand how the other side plays b4 calling killers bad
---
I don’t believe it’s even possible to edit post titles. At least, that’s what I hear around
---
Oh yeah, do you have Thanatophobia? That can be useful instead of Pop go the weasel, because atleast its not reliant on catching people to get gen regress, also to heal they have to let you get Corrupted purge so they might just work through thanatophobia
---
Omg I would totally buy these!!!
---
&gt; TWD Comic was great
---
Only until the timeskip.  It's been terrible for quite awhile now.  I was a huge fan but it's dead to me currently.  Show has been unwatchable for years but the comic is unreadable now too.
---
He's also got the stealth advantages. His power only ends if survivors face him, not their cam, but the survivor themself.
---
I havent played or levelled the nurse tbh so I havent got it. But my bloodwebs an asshole and won't give me tier 2 perks
---
Why don’t you run Iron Will?
---
 wrong
---
Right, I'm saying they can "ruin" matches easily since they know they'll get back into a game quickly, whereas killers have to wait insanely long.
---
Shit he knows we have unlimited prayer beads
---
How dare you camp the survivor at the endgame! Guaranteeing a kill for you and not letting the survivors win? You monster.
---
Well I heard that dbd on the PS4 just isn’t as popular as it is on pc so you won’t be getting as many matches and it also depends on your rank, if you’re too high or low ranked u wining be seeing that many people.
---
Well then I’m not going to buy the dlc just to have a garbage killer with garbage perks to crowd my bloodweb.
---
Gotta get that PC just for dbd 🙄
---
I rock green Susie with Joe’s black mask. Best outfit imo.
---
Uh I think he needs help.
---
Ah, okay. Well, that's the only experience I ever had with all male survivors I can remember.
---
"I kept my eye on them, eventually they just DCed"
---
Is it normal for the Killer to wait a very long time for people to join on Xbox? I get into a survivor lobby immediately.
---
Yeah, apart from the bugs and what not, that one was super odd to wrap my head around haah
---
Well yea but you're not supposed to admit it, so we can have more support and eventually have this in the game.
---
Hopefully when the dedicated servers come people might come back to the game.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Are the dedicated servers coming for consoles also?
---
Killer skill is all that really matters. It's why my friend, Elite, who's always R1 on both sides is so good. He's been having trouble as survivor lately and prefers killer since, according to him, killing has never been easier
---
100 Benevolent is an iridescent, but it takes 880 Evader for an iridescent. So 10 from the sabo play is 10% (half an unhook), but 50 from the pallet stun is worth 5.6% (bonus for surviving 15 seconds of chase). 
---
them being in different categories makes it difficult to compare, but the sabo play is worth almost twice as much of an emblem.
---
It should show objects auras. It sucks looking around a certain area.
---
I don’t have that problem generally, unless I’m a killer, then only sometimes. Has to do with popularity and how the game sets up matches.
---
Switch out save the best for last for ruin, the game might go by fast. I would use ruin to slow it down
---
Hatch closing powering the gates is classed differently than gens powering the gates. They're different Endgame Collapses.
---
I legit get Prayer Beads every other bloodweb and I haven’t even prestiged her lol
---
Region? Provider? Time Zone?  As someone East Coast US with Verizon Fios, I have zero trouble any time of day unless the killer is on Mars.  My friend in a more rural area has significant more trouble at off times.
---
First off the perk is pretty ass, and secondly how am I supposed to know if I’m playing a Spirit.
---
Ah yes, your "friend"
---
&gt; Killer skill is all that really matters.
---
I tried something, still not finished but kinda cool for a tattoo idea
---
so.... did you *make* this errr, what is this post
---
They’re changing it back. You’ll no longer get stacks for unhooks anyway, only protection hits.
---
You mean to slow the game down just a little bit.i feel like as legion its slowed down enough and basement builds slow it down quite a bit anyway.i would do that of its a swf though.
---
I’m in Western Europe and during nighttime it takes me 20min to find a match. Ridiculous
---
Yes.
---
Exactly, it’s usually just in case though since some survivors gen rush.
---
Oh okay I see, so it's like a crossbreed of Pig's stealth advantage and Shape's sightlines. That doesn't sound half bad, actually.
---
They are? I see no info of them changing it back
---
I mean of course but like, her chest isn’t over exaggerated
---
Patch 1.7.0
---
Quality of Life: removed Recovery from physical stun condition caused by Perks, the standard Enduring values were supposed to apply to all kinds of stuns (but did not for Perk stuns).
---
Buff: increased recovery rate 50/60/75 %.
---
Patch 2.6.0
---
Quality of Life: fixed the change introduced in Patch 1.7.0; Enduring now applies its modifiers correctly to any kind of stun.
---
they fixed this bug at the same time they nerfed D-strike. that's partially why it feels like nothing now and why it used to be still fucking long back then
---
New one isn't too bad, as survivors actually need to earn it, and its good that it protects you from the oneshots as well after you earn it.
---
you can use perks like Q&amp;Q, DwM, Lightweight, Iron Will, Spine Chill, Premonition, Calm Spirit etc to counter her
---
Such a fine line to tow with this killer. If you go too far and make it easy to stalk, you have a nearly unstoppable, one hit down monster. Or you have what we see in the PTB. Glad we can test and hope the outcome is balanced!
---
What in the actual fuck?
---
I mean, that’s probably true, but the exit gates are powered. And I’m fully willing to accept this was a bug, but the achievement definitely didn’t progress after a match where I closed the hatch.
---
The perk is bad design.  The effect is too strong if multiple survivors use it, so they are kind of stuck making it really hard to use.  I don’t see how they make it easier to use without it staying too powerful though.  This is why perks should stop giving free hits.
---
I still think this power has more potential than the obviously hashed together Meyers Pig mishmash
---
It’s honestly just a poorly designed perk. There shouldn’t be a perk that gives Survivors free health states. If it’s easy to get it’ll be overpowered and if it’s hard to get it’ll be useless. At this point they should just rework the perk into something else IMO.
---
They aren’t changing it back to how it was originally, they are changing it back to what they said pre PTB about only stacking with protection hits. They just had a dev stream 2 hours ago where they explained this.
---
Exactly! But there’s more to it then just that.
---
I'm gonna dump my salt: 
---
**There is zero counter play to prayer beads. None.**
---
This add-on should not even exist. Tuft of Hair/Tombstone Myers? I'll deal with it. Pill Bottle/Paint Brush Freddy? Cool. Iri Head Huntress? Fine with me. Clapper/Ghost Wraith? Always interesting. 
---
But Prayer Beads? Fuck that stupid shit. Unless you don't wanna do gens and have the game go for 30+ minutes cause everyone is scared of getting yoinked off the gen.
---
No, it really isn’t. It takes away one of the main tracking abilities that **all** killers have.
---
It was on the most recent dev stream. Happened 2 hours ago.
---
They said it on the live Q&amp;A Today.
---
He had a key.
---
Pretty much but then again 50% of killers camp or tunnel already anyway. So that 50 will likely increase lol. Which will most likely drive ppl away from the game
---
You know what, I’ll take them doing a dull totem cause it’s atleast something. Far to many times I see people hiding in a corner or a locker for no damn reason....😒
---
If you are in a rural area of Western Europe, then I would expect that.  If you are in a more urban area than it’s probably your provider.
---
Well I hope they fix protection hits cause they are broken as fuck

Can you still use Deliverance if you’re the last one alive? Like you’ve gotten an unhook already to prep it but then everyone else dies, can you still use it or does the hook still insta-kill you?

Boy, I sure love two week long testing periods that launch with a bug that makes testing impossible that probably won't be fixed before release
---
They can easily fix his problems. Not by the 18th, sure, but easily by mid-chapter.

This was my first reaction and bugged the hell out me. Didn't know it was a reference :/

No it will not lol.  Going back to injured only.

Thank you once again, for your contributions to the DbD community. You truly are a hero, OP.
---
I will no longer use plunderers, as the odds of obtaining a flashlight appear unchanged, whereas the odds of obtaining an useless item (map, key) increase. I'd rather have the extra perk slot. Thank you.
---
Really? That’s sorta lame in my opinion
---
Iron Will is good against all killers. It just works even better against a Spirit.
---
I appreciate the info, but I am aware of that. I usually get into a locker when someone is getting picked up and I wait 1....2.....3...etc. I usually wait 7s. Im going to assume it was just a lucky guess. Maybe someone near me did a fast vault and i didnt know about it. It was on Lery's so who tf knows lol.
---
Meh, back to never using this perk soon
---
New perk, distracts killer for 5 minutes.
---
When I first started the game In thought attacking hooked people would make them die faster. I did this for a long time...
---
Swap out ruin or corrupt intervention with surveillance, and no gens shall be getting repaired
---
*looks in your general direction*
---
It was basically acrossed the map on lery's. I described the situation abit better in another comment.
---
The perks dead
---
Lol really Rasmur? 😄
---
Prayer beads is completely busted yes.
---
Except people aren't talking about Ghostface being bugged or telling the devs to fix the bug (btw, they noticed it on the first evening of the PTB).
---
They are asking the devs to drastically redesign the power, before anyone has had a chance to properly test it.
---
It's like reviewing a car when you only driven it with flat tires; pointless.
---
What does PTB stand for?
---
* Reposts within the last 60 days are not permitted.
---
SWF
---
What were the changes?
---
Actually, I do have a question: was there any tracking of Basement Chests vs. other chests?
---
Still, it should only cancel his ability to stalk the person who spotted him.
---
Are you sure? I thought I did mend other survivors before
---
Yeah that's my point
---
Public Test Beta I believe
---
I wish they could but Michael is a copyrighted character and are not aloud to make changes 
---
Good idea tho
---
The problem is that my current survivor build is sprint burst, adrenaline, decisive strike, mettle of man.  I think the whole point tbh is to nuke it into the ground so that you stop seeing that kind of thing.
---
So survivors, if the exit gates are powered, have 125% move speed. 
---
Lmao what the fuck.
---
they only hinted some stuff, they'll give us more info once shit is done
---
Amazing work! Congratz for everyone who worked on this!
---
No, he can stalk multiple at the same time, but the exposed effect only occurs to those who were stalked
---
I'm The Plague. i love long walks on the beach, corrupt purge, and fried chicken.
---
"Chainsaws"  
---
"Nea W/Flashlight"  
---
"Hex: Ruin"  
---
"Tuft of Hair"  
---
"Claudette"  
---
Those are the wrong things to complain about.
---
Don’t let him stalk you.
---
First, know what you're looking for - Myers is actually one of the easier killers to spot because his black suit stands out well in fog, and his white mask is easy to see through corn.  So always keep an eye out, rotate your camera, because you'll see him before you hear him.
---
Second, you're getting downed in one hit because he's stalking people to power up his ability - break his line of sight.  If he's just sitting there watching you, run!  Duck around trees, behind rocks, through buildings; it cancels his power when he can't see you.  Don't try to hide if he's already spotted you, because he can still power his ability from just an arm or a leg sticking out from behind an object.
---
Third, learn his range and practice your looping - Michael has a variety of lunges depending on how powered up he is, so don't get too close.
---
Look around you; don't feed him stalk.  
---
When being chased by him and you think he's 99-ed his power, play much safer with windows and pallets.  
---
Myres isn't that hard to counter once you get looping down.
---
ThIs Bi*Ch Is WeAriNg thE SAme Thing As ME?!
---
*let's fight*
---
Just for 3 seconds and at the cost of yourself.
---
[LFG sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbdLFG/)
---
Did you just edit that in or did I miss it? Because I see it now.
---
RUNNING DAVID WITH NO MITHER WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY FUN AGAINST MCPUKEY LOL! I JUST DID GENS AND PUKED ALLOT WHILE DOING THEM AND SHE WAS BUSY TRYING TO PUKE ON OTHER TEAMATES, WAS ALREADY BROKEN SO DIDNT HAVE TO HIT THE FOUNTAINS AND WAS ONLY HOOKED ONCE, WE ALL MADE IT OUT.
---
Can't say I've experienced this, but if I had a dollar for every time I pressed space to drop a pallet and absolutely nothing happened I'd be a millionaire.
---
good. a 3rd health-state is so unfair it HAS TO be super inconsistent. Any sort of consistency for that is by default broken.
---
Seems pretty bad.
---
The only thing that a disguise ability would do is encourage survivors to always work on four different generators. Also useless in SWF.
---
Must've missed it lol
---
I’m in love with the way you painted the highlights. It really makes everything pop!
---
It sucks that the first meta survivor perk we get after a year got gutted so fast, i Never ran MOM bc I think it's boring, but like come on. I thought it was the start of survivors finally getting usable perks again
---
That's a good idea. as long, as those people don't leak stuff. there were too many leaks lately, even without telling outside people about it
---
With that logic though they will start nuking every perk including a lot of good killer builds. I find that to be sorta a dumb reason to make a perk useless in my opinion
---
Really? 
---
Since the PTB launched two days ago, we have received a lot of feedback on Ghost Face. We are currently working to find a solution to the following issues:
---
    Cancelling stealth is too easy
---
        In addition, there is currently a bug which allows the survivors to reveal Ghost Face before Night Shroud is activated, causing him to be instantly spotted as soon as it is activated
---
    Stalking is not as efficient as we'd like
---
        The amount of time it takes to stalk somebody compared to the time it takes to detect Ghost Face is not where we'd like it to be.
---
    Audio feedback
---
        There are various audio queues and issues which make it too easy to detect Ghost Face, making it difficult to sneak up on survivors.
---
We are currently reviewing Ghost Face internally and coming up with solutions to the problems listed above. We will share more information with you as soon as we can.
---
Oof deleting my comment to save face. My b.
---
It's more boredom than pain; you just have no power.
---
But “window bugs” is a good thing to complain about?
---
I've had this happen too!
---
Arguably it isn't even a perk anymore because there is no way it can activate.
---
I use claudette but I wear her silver dress.
---
No immersed blendettes here. Come at me killers, lemme pallet loop, teabag, DS and MoM you :3
---
Alpha or Beta would be better imo.
---
Except there’s a minute of banter between Pablo, Kelly, and Ash about it.
---
Its for people to whine and bitch and say things will never be changed of course.
---
Yeah I know but a year ago I told my friend that if ghostface got added I'd main him no matter what tier he is, so I kinda screwed myself over on that one
---
Didn’t know that was a thing, thank you kind stranger!
---
You know they are going to buff him before release right?
---
While I agree that spirit is boring to go against, and her add-ons make her amazingly easy to play, def not the most annoying killer
---
Windows are pretty bugged atm?  
---
I've had entity-blocked windows not being blocked(which is being worked on, I believe) and times where I just vault a window but teleport backwards as survivor.
---
Usually with my luck every hex except noed gets broken lol
---
they pointed out what needs to be done, but their time is limited so they aren't sure if they are able to do all of those.
---
&gt;the reason that GF isnt worth shit
---
Suggesting that there isn't more than one reason.
---
Even with the change, people will break his stealth more likely than not, he still makes too much noise, and 20 seconds of exposed is like one loop.
---
Don't worry, nobody's perfect and my grammar isn't that great either.
---
I can see why people want to play Ghostface, but there's no way I could bear playing him.
---
You're delusional if you think giving Plague Corrupt Purge is better
---
Most likely SWF. GG anyways..looks like you were going for adept Michael.
---
Unless you have urban and sprint burst, you aren't getting out of hag's basement if she sets a lot of traps. You either trip one and get hit or try to slowly crouch through them and let her easily walk back over to stop you.
---
We are currently reviewing Ghost Face internally and coming up with solutions to the problems listed above. We will share more information with you as soon as we can. 
---
Really now?
---
Yeeeah. The 360 is a bug, but from how they made it, it's clearly meant for the camera to face them not the character. If they fix _just_ the 360 bug, it's going to be... Underwhelming.
---
Imagine if Ghostface joined the game during the Freddy Fiasco?
---
Or back when true Infinite Loops were still rampant?
---
I mostly agree with you except on Shaun.
---
lmao
---
I honestly think they should now nerf NOED in all honestly. Since NOED has like 3 ability’s and takes no effort for the reward. But that is my opinion on it
---
No prob fam, hopefully more ppl see this so we can stop with the spam and provide more constructive criticism for the devs so we can have a super awesome killer :)
---
It will be good after the pop buff. But plague isn’t really the strongest killer in chase without her damage state. Overall tho 7/10
---
Totally. Especially against baby noed killers. I would appreciate even if this perk was only intended to counter one hit downs... But making it stackable only through protection hits, wtf
---
Just gonna keep playing Billy 😂😂
---
Interesting take on a change to his power
---
It doesnt help my bloodweb being an asshat. Legit ive had useless perks go to tier 2
---
Cant wait to try new Freddy!
---
No love for laurie 😢
---
Very cool.
---
&gt;However, Half of kindred hardly works because of it.
---
The perk still works, just only after the bubble is gone (IIRC). Kindred is fine.
---
It's dead after the release (with the just 3 protection hits version), at least on high ranks. 
---
It will be something as (probably worse) than Unbreakable. Sure it's good when you can use it, but the times you won't will be way too many to make it even remotely worth it. The times you won't charge it, you get camped, you get out without needing it, it's unusable against M2 hits... it's pure trash imo. I would get others like Family, Bond, Tenacity... over it. In fact, using it will result in incrementing you death ratio imo, you will be playing more risky just to try to charge it just for a free M1 hit... the more i write, the more useless i find it.
---
Safe hooks will not count anymore. Did you read the post before start typing like a bible translator?
---
high tier keys will let you open the black lock (hatch).
---
but the key really gets it's power from add ons.
---
He actually said that. But what use does half of Kindreds ability do if the bubble blocks it. Bitter murmer lasts past the bubble, but since kindred is distance, it needs something to work with as well.
---
Hey now. Trappers got pure seniority at the moment.
---
You know how it goes, the oldest employee calls the shots especially if there's no real upward mobility.
---
Proxy camping is fine if you know the survivors are there, or if the gate is open, there is nothing more boring then getting face camped by a LF at 5 gens and having them type  "ggez" on ur profile.
---
Wish it worked on all survivors instead of obsession.
---
Oh ok, thanks
---
Is there a section in this subreddit for questions or no?
---
She could have just slapped her, closed the hatch, then picked her up.
---
Thanks for the input! I love your idea for Selfless Leader!
---
Easiest solution to comms is to give killers some form of compensation for playing against it.
---
You shouldn’t know what perks a killer is running. Everyone has different play styles some just wanna get out quickly others wanna play it safe you can’t force everyone to play exactly the same.
---
Yes, this has been said atleast 100 times in the past 2 days. We are aware
---
It’s easy to cut chase early, wait for the cooldown, and re-enter chase quickly for some easy Stacks though. Even that 5-10% makes a huge difference.
---
When this sub is so full of stupid that people take this post seriously
---
Sorry. I don't sit in DBD chat. Just stating my opinion  😂😂
---
The key(item) is to open the hatch or track others if you're using add-ons.  
---
The green key doesn't do anything without add-ons.  
---
The two other keys can open the hatch; the time the hatch is open for can be extended using add-ons. The hatch is a mechanic that kicks in once you're either the only survivor left or when the number of survivors alive + generators remaining = 4(3 survivors and 1 gen left, for example). The hatch will only open if a key is used on it, or there's only one survivor left in the trial. A killer can close the hatch if they find it; from that point on, it can only be opened by the key.
---
Nah looking at freddy would wake you up obvi.
---
Idk why they don't make a killer whose ability is literally an extra perk slot
---
When his power works, it’s great!
---
Ok thanks, I'm in a match and I was confused
---
You really would.
---
The best counter to Plague is to not cleanse. If you cleanse, you are fucking over your team.
---
Yeah, i know how good this perk is. But finding an obsession isn't always easy task.
---
Report this to the devs and remove the comment so people won't abuse it.

I do wonder if you unlock Freddy will you start at lvl 2...
---
"We need to wait for live" as opposed to what? If you mean wait for live to give opinions of his current state, then he never would've been fixed. If you mean wait for live to play him, then again, nobody would have found the problems. If you mean wait for live to comment on what his state is on live...everybody is already doing that.
---
To your point, yeah, that's true. They would rather scale a killer UP to a certain power level rather than take away from the Killer, leaving people with a worse taste in their mouths because they saw how much more powerful the killer could have been.  It's something they've done a few times in the past so it's a rather pleasant surprise if they can give the killer something a little bit stronger before release.
---
As for Ghost Face, specifically, the bug and the fact that he's loud tells me that he may have been a little too strong, in that form.  They might have made him more "survivor friendly" - basically, his wimpiest form that they came up with, conceptually, to see how the community would receive him.  With such blowback in his current state, I'm hoping they'll definitely make him much stronger in his release iteration.
---
I love the frustrated slash at the end
---
&gt;the no-cleanse believers tend to be very aggressive in yelling at people who cleanse.
---
guilty as charged
---
Except it does work, it just has some balance issues and a few bugs. If mew manage to pull it off, the power does work how intended. The fact that you're claiming a test version of the game isnt for testing is just pure ignorance
---
No I don’t think that at all.  The killer’s power should function correctly before the ptb is launched is what I mean.  You obviously didn’t listen at all.
---
If you read, slepping with change based on his add ons. Also, his power is also snare traps not just teleporting to gens, along with passive stealth.
---
The MoM changes that were suggested before had almost no counterplay on killer side (other than tunneling &amp; slugging), how is that balanced (or fun for that matter)?
---
I'm glad the perk is getting trashed, we don't need a perk that's old-DS level bullshit.
---
Who is your favourite scary killer?
---
Not you...
---
Dang!
---
no they mean grab, Doctor has a thing where if you spam M1 while in shock mode, you can grab someone, it worked with hatch standoffs too.
---
You had One Job.
---
ONE JOB!
---
I saw an alternate version of this that had a different version for "I'll be right back". It was called "Red Herring". It was an obsession perk that gave the obsession a mini terror radius for 60/90/120 seconds of their own as well as the inability to hear the killer's radius every time a survivor completed a generator
---
Hey, idiot. Did you realize that they’re fixing the bugs THANKS TO the PTB? You know, the public test build they release in order to see these exact issues. 
---
Clown.
---
\*Confused oink\*
---
Not to mention the Apex battle pass also levels significantly slower. The Apex battle pass is what's killing their game.
---
Console Nurse
---
Swap no mither for we’ll make it, altruistic builds will be hard when you are a one hit, but with we’ll make it you can heal fast without a medkit and take some hits for mom, plus mom is useless when you’ll die when you get all three stacks b/c of the broken status effect
---
What does four stacks on BBQ &amp; Chili mean exactly? I'm a little new myself so I don't get those slang terms.
---
"BuT tHe GrAsS"
---
You wrote that his power is snare traps if you bring certain add ons. I’m looking at his power at base level. Also his sleeping changing with add ons isn’t very specific, which is why I said we’ll see more once he’s playable.
---
Auras would probably be too strong for the totem hunting bit, but I'd really like a totem counter. Would give the perk more of a use beyond the first few games that you run it for the sake of finding totem locations.
---
Ah ok. The sound he makes on entering night shroud is so that stealthing mid-chase isn't super powerful, the sound he makes on leaving night shroud shouldn't matter unless you've been spotted in which case that's part of your punishment for being spotted. I do agree that the sound he makes while moving around is weirdly loud and unnecessary.
---
How is DS now a crutch perk? Because you cant tunnel someone off hook anymore? The only crutch perk for survivors now is MoM thats why i never used it because no way they won't nerf it hard and rightfully so
---
why camp?
---
I just wanted to try facecamp.
---
Well I cannot argue with that logic.
---
The only real problem I have is when you are a survivor you would be able to just walk over to a full gen and mess every skill check to where it lost all it's progress
---
You can see parts of the side of her face, as well as ear, not her scalp. Unless the hair flips up anyway, which will most likely be the same with the new rig. The only character that seems to legitimately have glued-on hair is Jeff, with his scalp showing on the side. The black variant of Feng's hair also looks texturally fine. That said, it was mostly about the ears showing, liking the new bangs less, and the new hair seeming too full.
---
Makes sense lol
---
LOL it ain't about life or death so you have no right to expect a quality product.
---
I feel like you didn't read the shit post tag, or looked at the rest of the build
---
Alright, just wanted to make sure too much hasn’t changed since 👌
---
Killers should not require add ones to play.  At base his power is going to be gen warping and either a Doctor or nurse add on that is more conditional.
---
Yeah I am still pissed about that logic.  
---
That kind of behaviours destroys the game for me entirely.
---
I'm littrely just copying this from a dev post, so im going off what was said.
---
I can see how that would be perceived as such. But the range isn't even that far.
---
The reload speed is pretty helpful. Also is helpful when you run BBQ so people can't avoid it. 2 helpful functions for one perk is worth running imo.
---
Not looking for any "real" answers. Just crowd sourcing opinions since I'll be playing all of them eventually. Thanks for the response though.
---
You can, this guy's just talking out his ass
---
GGEZ
---
RIP Ghostface
---
If you get four stacks of it, doesn't that mean you hooked four unique survivors?
---
Trapper: So, what's your power again?
---
Ghostface: Well I can stalk survivors.
---
Trapper: We already have a guy who can do that. You're telling that me that you want to join us now by doing exactly what he's been doing for 2 and a half years?
---
Ghostface: Yes. But my power is slightly different. I can only expose 1 survivor at a time and if any of them see me, then my power becomes unusable and then there's cooldown.
---
Trapper: Wow, that sounds fucking atrocious. Next!
---
Ghostface: Wait, wait. I can also do this: look! *teabags*
---
Trapper: Oh my lord, that's a pretty good job. You're absolutely in!
---
Hooked everyone at least once.
---
Toxicity goes both ways. If you’re teammates were taunting him then they are just as much to blame as he is.
---
Killers have always had the ability to stab survivors down one health state easily and quickly with just one mouse click. NOED gave them a way to easily stab them through TWO health states.
---
Finally, with DS, survivors could stab back. It didn't really damage the killer though. Just a short stun. But it was a start.
---
Now they made DS worse.
---
The only way for survivors to stab back.
---
This game will remain a joke as long as we don't get more, better ways to stab killers. Otherwise it's just completely unbalanced.
---
I had to swiftly nope out when I saw "Michael Myers cums for his victim"
---
No, I figured it's out, it's distance based. It won't trigger if a survivor is close by.
---
A better change would be to get 3 stuns instead. Whether it be by pallet or perk.
---
I just hope they can get some changes done before the official release on the 18th of June.
---
has this been posted already? I didnt find it on the sub, if you could link me the post i will just delete and go there plz
---
Your awesome! Thanks!!!!
---
Rick Grimes and a zombie for a killer. When you kill someone they become an autonomous zombie that goes looking around the map for survivors.
---
I agree with this. Posting someone’s personal information in any capacity, because you’re mad at how they played a game, is not cool at all.
---
Quality meme
---
That kind of stuff should really be in the power description, but it's useful info. That actually means the survivor is really close if there's no indicator right? That's how you know they're right around the corner
---
Thanks - actually went and bought this shirt
---
You know they can do the same thing without prayer beads right?  You wouldn’t hear her phasing if you’re inside her terror radius, whether she had prayer beads or not.
---
i dont get it, has he recommended himself or any other streamers to go do this? Im just asking because i disagree with plenty of his opinions on the game but i truly believe the devs need *someone* to fact check them on how the game is played since they clearly dont understand. Do you have a better idea?
---
Then its because of the brand
---
No one taunted him in that way. The random taunted him into me by whiping him off.
---
&gt;The funny thing is that the random (we were a 3-stack queue) taunted him  right into me after 10 seconds into the game. Got instantly downed  while hiding in a dark corner with Claudette.  
---
Instantly hooked up and facecamped to death. Lovely..
---
They should give prayer beads a downside, like slower power recovery or charge time
---
That's correct. An addon says it decreases the distance before it's triggered, that's how I figured it out.
---
Well if not then that makes it worse. Spirit is an annoying killer to go against
---
So someone taunted him.
---
Quite suitable captions
---
Not read through the whole thing yet but, contrary to popular belief, some people play swf for fun, not to be tryhards.
---
This is amazing.
---
Obviously they would have to sign an NDA, besides, BHVR does a good enough job leaking their own stuff as it is.
---
Nurse players aren’t playing DbD either, so fair
---
You lose bloodpoints for it and rank decreases. You're intentionally causing someone potential harrassment. Report the player like everybody else does. Just because you got face camped doesn't mean your special.
---
Forgive my stupidness, cawhat does captions mean? Did I dissapoint you?
---
Oh my days I never knew I wanted these
---
Not to be petty, but the top left of her hair you can see the curvature of her skull because the hair is floating and parted by magic or enough natural grease to put the homeless to shame. The floating bits are on the right side too, where you can see through her hair for no reason. 
---
THAT ASIDE, I get what you mean by it being too full. It went from flat straight hair with side swept bangs to voluminous and wavy which is so different from the original and I can understand why the changes are suboptimal for you. Hopefully they add new hair you can enjoy soon :)

---
It's just a standard shapeshifter. Plenty of similar fan builds.
---
Good survivors also don’t like to deal with getting tbagged and flashlighted by a teammate who wants you to heal them when you’re working on a gen that’s almost finished.
---
No, it'd be a Bamboozle/NOED Billy
---
I'd love a walking dead chapter
---
honestly i cant argue with this because most survivors complain if they go against a killer they think is unfair when its balanced, but at the same time if they play against someone  at rank 20 or someone just trying nurse they will talk the everloving sh\*t out of how bad the killer is and how they're so good they should "be in rank 1"
---
Right, I’m just giving my opinion on what we know. Like I said things can (and probably will) change but based on what we know now his power looks boring. Even though he’s not a good Killer he is arguably the most unique in the game. Now he’s gonna be able to teleport to gens and that’s really it. Doc’s my second main and fake pallets might get you a hit or two per game but that’s rarely will get you more than that. It’s very underwhelming for a power, and its got me thinking most Survivors won’t even bother waking up and will instead just rush through the gens.
---
I’d honestly love to see this for the other killers lol
---
Then don't heal them. Problem solved.
---
Maybe the wiki is wrong. Im pretty sure through all my games with or against him or on videos Ive always seen him go at the same speed as a survivor, when backrevving is when it is the most apparent (for me anyway)
---
Amazing work, good job!
---
Very cool
---
I find it funny to see you excited over this. Makes me remember my first hours at the game. Gl in your next matches.
---
Yes, I know that, thus the "margin of error" bit. It's just weird that both are deviating up from 50% and by precisely the same amount. Could be just a coincidence.
---
You must just be getting bad spirits then lol
---
I agree prayer beads is op tho
---
I personally think the terrible sound of the voices contributes to the beauty of this meme.
---
People will disconnect even with that.
---
I'd rather it fall on the side that makes him good - if they can balance him to the point where he stands with Billy and Nurse we'll finally see a change to the meta (killers-wise) since Spirit
---
Someone on r/dbdgonewild requested something like this
---
The nurse has always been broken. They will literally never do anything about it. She ignores every patch and buff and nerf and mechanic adjustment.
---
Chad Hillbilly can get any one of his sisters that he wants.
---
« It really isn’t that hard » then why don’t you fix it
---
*laughs in thicc*
---
Not really useless, it means that there will be a box closer to your present location on average if there are more boxes around.
---
Your experiment idea is waaaay too much work needed just for one add-on of one killer, I'm afraid.
---
I'm guessing they didn't talk about the whole 'ThE GhOsT FaCe' thing, which I really hope gets changed before his release as well
---
beautiful

Got my first salt mail today after starting this gar last week. Those are sweeeeet to read lol
---
People can say it’s inefficient all they want but it’s really not true. 32 second self heal = 32 total seconds wasted. 16 second heal on another Survivor is still 32 seconds because its taking two Survivors out of the game for 16 seconds. Then they always bring up “self caring in the corner of the map”. Just because bad Survivors use it poorly doesn’t mean the perk is bad. Not to mention having self heals let’s other Survivors make unhook plays or stay on gens.
---
No pretty sure good survivors want the altruism and would be smart enough in that situation to simply 99 the gen heal the survivor then instapop before leaving.
---
I'd say doctor for Monitor and Abuse.
---
*MY EYES*
---
sooo freed will get the 3 abilities in his kit base?
---
So now you’ve ruined 3-4 other people’s moods who are faced with being forced to leave the game too or deal with an unbalanced game for the next 5-15 minutes.
---
I could run this, actually. I have all perks at Tier 3 on Trapper at least
---
R1 Thotianaaa =))
---
First at all, u don't have to be rude with other ppl, there's no need for that.Second, He's right, they should've at least made 80% of the work, PTB was supposed to be bug fixing, just few stuff.
---
The whole killer seems broken, If It doesn't get reworked, few will buy it, so that means less money for behaviour, less money = less content for the community.
---
I bring Botany Knowledge with a medkit. Level 3 uses 12 charges to heal or 10.12 for green kit. A standard yellow medkit heals twice. 
---
I usually run a green med-kit with Abdominal Dressing and Gel Dressing. I can heal myself in 10.12 seconds and 8.29 seconds to heal teammates with the kit for a total of 3 times.
---
I like it because it allows myself to be efficient with time and remain safe for another hit or if I need to really pull off a quick heal.
---
We'll Make It also awesome. I run both Botany and We'll Make It and it's awesome. I can patch myself up quick and patch others up quick if I didn't get the unhook. If I do then the heal is 6.8 seconds long.
---
Self-care is a time waster and in cruical moments in the game, you can't sit to heal yourself for 32 seconds or 40 with Sloppy. If multiple teammates do it then it's an easy win for killer. There's always the argument of unlimited healing but realistically you get hit two or three times in one game unless you're being altruistic as hell which is bad in it self too if the killer takes advantage of it.
---
If you're gonna use Self-Care, at least bring Botany to cut off 8 or 10 seconds off a heal (depending on Sloppy Butcher) and an item like a key to choose over a medkit.
---
If only I had friends...
---
Being a over dramatic cry baby really makes you unlikable.
---
TrashFace's only redeeming quality is his teabags. Not good enough for my money.
---
i don’t understand why people disconnect against ghostface. if you don’t want to play against him, don’t be in the fucking ptb!
---
My comment wasn't for you
---
It's happened to me about five or so times, where I can't heal or wake someone, the prompt just doesn't come up.
---
Short time for so much to be done, the new killer really sucks.
---
Yes and BHVR needs to learn we won’t give them our money if they are going to keep giving us stuff like this.
---
So block me? If you act stupid, expect to get called out on it. Quit crying. 
---
“PTB was supposed to be bug fixing.” GF’s power is currently bugged and being fixed thanks to the PTB. Keep talking in circles though.
---
They won't hire him. He's overqualified for BHVR.
---
YOU WILL NEVER REALLY ESCAPE
---
Oh wait you right!
---
There are people who host competitive tournies. They have fixed classes, or perk setups, for killer and survivor. Look up Tyde Tyme, I believe he has them on his channel :)
---
It's also the Huntress' perk but with aura reading as well, making hers obsolete. I can't remember what it's called.
---
please don't make fun of the fact that i can't spell :-(
---
I like this idea. If people stop buying dlcs hoping they are good it will force devs to actually drop good/complete dlcs. People should do this for most games.
---
Mhm!
---
Legit entitled survivors would cry their eyes out.
---
"Imma get the unhook the gens nearly done"
---
*comes back to a gen that looks barely touched*
---
"I TOUCHED THIS GEN"
---
It needs to be said 100 more times for the devs to hear it, but they don't just need to hear it, it needs to give them a migraine because this is not ok.
---
But then it'd still be an M1 killer
---
Freddy situation? Freddy was strong at release then they nerfed him, completely different.
---
In the current PTB yes
---
Super awesome artwork!!! I like how you can see the anger even though her eyes are blank.
---
The assumption would be that the killer is no longer on them man.  If you are just refusing heals just to do it that makes you a lousy teamate.
---
Yeah it could go either way for me. 
---
Spirit and nurse are top tier for sure.
---
You should level up Spirit. Very good killer with very good perks.
---
Freddy situation as in he'll be a shit killer for years without getting any work
---
I didnt even think about how it would affect the perks. Thanks for bringing it up. And I know not everyone cares about noed and I normally dont, but for those who do take it seriously but play solo, it can be a large disadvantage
---
I absolutely support it in any game! Dauntless is the same way and that feature has made different options available. I talked to a guy who primarily played it on PC and his girlfriend wanted to play but had only played games on PC. So he was able to log in to his PS4 with his account so she could play on the PC.
---
Wveryone uses that flair now so I cant tell what is or isn’t a meme anymore. Its the only reason people look at posts.
---
Darn by Daylight*
---
of?
---
I ever said it was useless. I said it was underwhelming for the tier level it is. Especially because global TR is effectively worthless outside of running Unnerving and Lullaby and just proxy pressure generators. 
---
And there’s nothing wrong with Legion being decent, but some of the addons that add more fun to the gameplay should at the very least work properly.
---
Killer probably left? Maybe? (Lagged out, Hence why he’s still there)
---
There is literally no reason to cleanse and give her super vomit. Being infected is hardly a big deal. It's way better to complete the gens close to a fountain and cleanse once the generaors are done around a certain area. Forcing the plag (if she wants to get super vomit) to basically throw the game because she's leaving generators unattended. 
---
If you cleanse immeadiatly against a plag you are basically giving her the win. So I don't know but you seems far more delusional.
---
It's a little funny that in the dev diaries they said he will be "closer to what the character is, in essence, so it's gonna go to that fantasy of being 'the nightmare'", yet one of the major changes is that he will literally be able to interact and kill awake survivors.
---
Damn bro, go grab a popsicle from the freezer and chill out. It was just an out loud thought. Sheesh.
---
It is shit content in the current state it's in. They may have poured their hearts into Ghost Face, and I'd agree with that on every level except gameplay. They clearly did not pour their brain into him.
---
No this happened the whole game
---
'good survivors dont like self care'? are we playing the same game??

Dead by Daylight: Death is an Escape
---
This was on a developer stream a while ago. They never responded to people telling them their math was wrong. You can still find old forum posts about it if you scroll back a bit.
---
Comes with a free Frogurt
---
I hope you're right!
---
Only instance i can think of are cow tree and the upstairs window of tompson house. A loop with so little room you can't get momentum for a fast vault.
---
May hurt the Macmillan god windows if you loop them in the wrong direction as well
---
I like it :)
---
its not a bad perk people are just fucking idiots
---
Wtf. Im not even triggered. I'm literally saying that if survivors go against anything powerful on the killer side, they complain. Do you know how to find a point of an argument? Who is triggered lol.
---
First google search found this:
---
https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1693785669853793758/
---
"What's that? Exclusively give you green maps on the bloodweb and chests? You got it!"
---
Exactly, it doesn’t seem to have much conterplay too, notice that ghost face is a survivor and sabotaging gens and you still can’t do anything
---
Maybe he found a key in a chest? It wouldn’t show up in their items on the post game screen.
---
I never said it was or it wasn't. I was commenting solely on the time differences between those two specific scenarios
---
Its obvious; entity got so tired of him getting one kill a game through facecamping; that putting you on a hook actually saved you
---
Don't tunnel and the head on hitbox is tiny you can down if you stay by the wall on the left
---
The medkit was in front of a broken hook so it could've been a medkit belonging to a survivor who got sacrificed there
---
How many times have you ever been Head On stunned? How many games have you gone against it in general? That perk is gonna get picked a little more for a week and no one is gonna run it after because it’s too niche. 
---
And if you hook someone in the basement, put them in the back hook and even if you get stunned the person won’t be able to leave without getting a hit in and you could even down someone depending on their health state.
---
Is this real?
---
I prolly sound like toxic peice of trash but no0b3 is really funny.
---
I watched Bricky do the casefiles on the killers.
---
Those people are dumb as fuck
---
People just don't like going up against certain killers. They'd rather just disconnect and try and load into another game.
---
Whispers is great perk to try and track survivors. Don’t listen to them, they’re dumb lol
---
Ok thanks
---
Hybridpanda, noob3 and monto are the 3 main I watch.
---
Yea let me just play a perfect game at rank 2 with like wraith using only his perks and no ruin
---
They're called entitled survivors. Ignore them. You play how you want to play
---
Ok I’ll try them
---
People DC a ton, Survivors and Killers. At lower levels i didnt notice it much but below rank 10 99% of the time if a survivor is hit in the first 2 minutes of a game they will DC instantly. The worst part about the game are cocky survivors or killers that can't take a loss, both of which will DC when they feel the game is being unfair to them.
---
My advice? As killer just wreak the rewards, quitter bonus is nice.
---
Gonna go with Spirit here. Fantastic perks, strong power, awesome design.
---
Thanks!
---
Even though Freddy can do that normally.
---
It sounds horrible in this video because of how it's explained, but the bare bones explanation is that yes he exposes 1 person.
---
Currently a lot of his issues that hopefully will be fixed before he does release includes how his stealth mode makes a lot of noise which obviously defeats the point of you know, STEALTH. Also currently you only need to look at him for an incredibly brief amount of time meaning you can just spin your camera and it'll "spot" him though that's not intended either.
---
The benefit to his stalk over Michael is that it only takes I believe 4 seconds and you expose one person plus you get the added bonuses that stealth DOES give which to be fair I haven't played with or against him yet on the PTB as I haven't bothered, but I believe he loses his red stain and terror radius in stealth. Just imagine Michael who's fairly tall and how easy to miss him is when in tier 1. Now imagine a shorter killer who can crouch AND lean around corners that is countered by having to look directly at him, it's I'm sure a lot more reasonable to understand how he's supposed to be effective.
---
Basically, yeah he has a similar gimmick to Michael there's no denying that. But his difference is that he goes in and out of stealth but current balancing and a few issues just make him very weak so hopefully after some changes are made to allow his strengths to show through his current excessive weaknesses, he is seen as a stronger killer.
---
I get the feeling that Deathgarden is more likely to see it than DBD unfortunately.  Deathgarden just re-released with a Terminator DLC (afaik it's just cosmetics for the Hunter) and it's more sci-fi action based compared to DBD.
---
The poster just decided they’re giving us stats per perk slot because the usage is always below 25%, that’s completely baseless and just their subjective interpretation of the statistics. They said the general populace doesn’t know how to interpret stats yet they are still part of the general populace, because of that I’m not inclined to believe they know how to interpret stats. They have no evidence it’s per perk slot, they just decided it was, and that’s not what I asked for.
---
I mean they also admitted it probably wont be fixed in time for live
---
Survivor DC meta in the PTB is real.
---
Don't hook the same person twice in a row? If you see pink jacket Claudette say to yourself that's pink jacket Claudette i'll go chase and hook someone else then by the time thats over 60 seconds should be up.
---
All hair and faces look bad. You might as well as list a bunch of dates on a dart board and start throwing at it blind to start taking guesses when they'll put resources toward new character models, textures or meshes
---
So I should just ignore easy prey? That's not logical.
---
For twitch I like Fungoose.
---
I said good survivors don’t like self care. Just because some survivors don’t run self care doesn’t mean they are good.
---
`i have several questions`
---
Its a HUD glitch it corrects itself when you leave the game I believe
---
This is literally like 6th grade fractions, dude. You cannot possibly be that young. You can run a perk once. You have 4 slots to run a perk in. What's 1 in 4, my man?
---
Also, because I love you so much,https://youtu.be/atWYbK2mKpE?t=741. There ya go, straight from the developer's mouth. 
---
Seriously, denial is fine up till a point.
---
Yea, I’ll stand by this statement all day. It’s not meta in 2019.

In addition to the changes, he came out bugged, so he was going to be fixed anyway
---
I mean I play it on everything so yeah it would be nice...
---
But I feel it will be a borderline requirement when the mobile version comes out. At the very least  mobile and one version of your choice.
---
`they said they are changing him, shut up`
---
They said on the Q&amp;A stream today that the graphics updates are far from finished and that it’ll probably be an ongoing process for awhile, I’m sure she’ll get an update at some point
---
I stand behind it as well.
---
This + cross platform would be awesome together, similar to how fortnite does it
---
Uh they don't have a fa-...oh
---
In the video he specifically states that they don’t have to pick him just because he’s bringing up the idea of having BHVR look for outside feedback.
---
It’s a perk I find to be a waste running, even more if the killer has Sloppy Butcher. I just bring a Medkit if I want to be able to heal myself. I run injured 80% of my games anyways so I would use Resilience.
---
Monto
---
the sarcasm is on another level
---
I wished he still did them
---
If you think it's that bad then don't play the game ;)
---
Well not trying to start shit but reason i asked is cause both points were soo off xD .
---
Whispers activates on the hooled person so it aint for camping or patrolling wtf lol its mostly for bigger maps and end game scenarios
---
mematic
---
*Nea and the Pussycats
---
I need one for the plag tbh. But his doctor perk builds got me to like rank 8
---
They said they were changing Freddy and look how long that took
---
It's the best idea I've seen mentioned so far. I know that's only my opinion, but I feel it's a good one.
---
Looks cool as fuck! *gets 10 fps*
---
They said in the stream they are changing whilst he is in PTB. Plus people still bought the freddy dlc.
---
Freddy had already been released at the time. What's more is ghostface is B R O K E N.
---
Hes not working like hes suppose to. Survivors are able to stop his power much faster and easier than intended.
---
Yeah it’s super annoying
---
Yes please!
---
When they released the Freddy DLC BHVR didn't have such a reputation for releasing bad content. I wouldn't be saying this if this were the first time it happened.
---
Your 21% is still wrong then, it’s for the prestige 3 level 50 players. It’s not specific to red ranks or whatever. 1/4 is 25% I’m not stupid. You have to pick from 51 teachable perks, that’s not including the many native perks, and then you only have a 25% chance of that perk going into your loadout. Not every single prestige 3 level 50 survivor runs selfcare, not every survivor who has it unlocked runs it. Also, never once in that video did they say their numbers are per perk slot, once again people are just deciding that it is, which isn’t factual.
---
But they said they were changing this one whilst he was in PTB. It seems to me like they've learnt a little tbh
---
I've seen too much Samination to take Trapper seriously, in a management position.
---
I really don’t think it’s a good perk. Survivors just don’t cleanse totems, so they die to it and then complain. Sometimes I may miss a totem or 2 in a game, but I’ll remember to make sure all of them are gone for future games.
---
Yeah people DC a lot.
---
I hate her. But I love this.
---
you're expected to not "win" chases as a survivor. you can only try to make them last as long as possible
---
Nah, better just downvote you like a bitch cause I don't like facts.
---
You dont like gens do yah.....
---
Nope. Not at all.
---
I can agree with you 100%
---
The anti swf perk build. Oh you want this gen? No gens for you!
---
You're bitching about people bitching, you're even more intolerable than they are.
---
Already happening.
---
&gt; Are you that shy?
---
It's a very cool idea
---
I made this and I can assure you that was not me.
---
DBD doesn’t have bugs, only features
---
In that case I would run discordance
---
Rick would be a great one! Nice!
---
Don't do it its horrible and gut wrenching.
---
I find having a destination or plan in mind to be the best way to survive a chase long enough for the killer to break off. In my experience, running just to escape the killer doesn’t often work out. Get a feel for the map and general palette locations, they don’t change too often imo. Find your comfortable loop spots, too.
---
Its. Fucking. Weird. That's why. And its disgusting too,
---
Yeah it would benice if got tier 2 perks. The plag is level 44 and bo tier 2 perks as of yet
---
Hey there! I made this concept a while back, along with ones for Jason, Xenomorph, and Pinhead. Appreciate the kind words.
---
Its at the top, too!
---
Idk if you meant hooked but what? Whispers just lights up if survivors are within so many meters of you based off tier. If you watch the perk at the start of the game and keep walking to gens it lights up when they enter the range it activates making finding survivors easier so I'm not sure how it's not a patrolling perk when that seems to be it's thing
---
It’s weird, sure, but it’s pretty mild
---
Hey dont worry. Next week around this time you will be getting double BP:)
---
it's great, don't worry
---
I will be too busy revising for my last exam ;-; and then getting drunk
---
Hm?
---
Well, even so, someone who just clicks on it and sees the "questionable" art will most likely be disgusted.
---
Okay, “prolong” chases then. Being in a 20-30 seconds chase is not ideal and doesn’t buy much time. I want to be clever and creative and juke killers. I feel like I’m too stupid for that as I panic too easily. I don’t know. Thank you for responding though.
---
"Noed abusing" ya'll realise that having the perk equipped isn't abusing it, right? Lmao
---
Every time I try to loop, the killer just catches up. Sigh.
---
Love how wraith waa standing there the whole time next to trapper
---
He means it’s not for patrolling a hooked survivor, as the hooked survivor still activates Whispers so you can’t tell if there’s anyone else there or not.
---
Jesus, preach my fellow survivor!
---
And you’re bitching about him bitching about other people bitching. 
---
Unbelievable.
---
True
---
Still have to pay and get Sony’s stamp of approval before then and setup a time and date to do it and your probably going by Sony’s datebook
---
Well thank mew. It's been on my mind for a while
---
I quit if there’s a hostage Doc
---
I have an exam tomorrow (today its 00.45am) and I am not prepared so i murdered people on this game to feel better earlier
---
If I had spare money I'd give you gold. Great work. 
---
On a side note, I'm bummed luck only affects the chance of wiggling off the hook (Which survivors usually never do, as even with offering it's rare) and bear traps. Luck NEEDS to have an effect on chest items.
---
My boy bubba is getting some love. &lt;3
---
Sounds about right. My exams are next week so imma probably do the same
---
Exams*
---
Appearntly so
---
I got that and know hook people still activate it but again the point of the perk is to make find survivors easier at the start or if you lose them and can't find them again. I'm not sure how making 1 scenario where it isn't doing what it's intended for means it is now not for patrolling overall.
---
Unfortunately, 'The Ghost' is a poor name due to it being the same name as 'The Wraith' or 'The Spirit' in some other languages.
---
I aint prepared for shit. Im laid in bed like fuuuuck what have i done
---
Hell of alot better than lettuce head!
---
Idk how it would make sense, seeing as they are all from apocalypse scenarios or in Ripleys case, the future. From what I know all the survivors come from the same world, and it kinda makes sense because all the licensed killers could happen in the same universe, but with these it would be different.
---
If you have it, Have you thought of running Object of Obsession? I use it because I’m pretty poor at chases. I can either avoid the chase and help teammates by reporting on the killer, or I use it to draw the killer to me as a distraction
---
I know I'm not gonna do well so fuck it XD
---
It is meta, but the thing is that it takes like 42 seconds to heal yourself when it takes like 90 (my numbers are prob off) to do a gen. I hate when people run it now that I've learned the math
---
Thank you for not nerding NOED, but rather adding a counter to it
---
Also... why auto-catrect?
