What’s the problem? This is just some normal DBD gameplay
---
---
---
__Nah they are.__
---

---
__But I am fine with camping. It is a guaranted win for my mate.__
---
__Facecamp is just bad we both know it.__
---
I love when suvivors run flashlight when I have Franklin's demise. The knock back animation when I chop the flashlight out of their grubby little hands is glorious 
---
We both know I am far superior than you at this game.
---
She’s tea bagging right next to Ace. You don’t see her ??
---
Lol as a killer?  If you are scared of lobbies and need to dodge swf I sincerely doubt that man.  That's like bragging about how much better of a bike rider you are but using training wheels.
---
No, I'm saying if the strategy of the killer is to camp, that's his strategy. He shouldn't have to change his strategy because you can't adapt. 
---
I don't understand any part of your post, sorry, maybe that's on me. 
---
I hope not. Liscensed killers are so boring I’d rather have something more creative than generic horror villain #4 
---
New DS is anti tunneling not anti camping.  You cant even use it on your first pickup. If anything it gives the killer even more of an incentive to camp so you never even get a chance to use it. People still wont come in and rescue you if the killer is facecamping 
---
Hopefully. Knowing behavior they’ll come out at the same time as console optimization. So never. 
---
Are you exiting out of the gate, or jumping into the hatch? I seem to recall that using the hatch messed up the achievement (though im not 100% sure)
---
Never imply that I fear swf. I just avoid toxic bs that is all.
---
It is good if you ran in it and get destroyed. They were no reason to dodge since a bunch of monkeys would have made you miserable.
---
Mmm yes guess i'll keep using cold dirt and joeys mixtape
---
Rank doesn’t matter but you are most likely better then a rank 20 killer with a lvl 1 perk its may not matter but people get better the higher rank they are some might still be as bad as rank 20 it still shows you have pit time into the game and not just try out killer for the 1st time
---
It goes both ways, I had a game with a friend who has like 10 hours and the killer had ruin3 and bbq3 on a instasaw billy 
---
His power is he can blind you with his highlight before snatching the survivors wigs off
---
Seems pretty clear cut to me.
---
Can confirm i always use controller when flying in gta keyboard for the rest of it
---
So the 3 others gen rush and it is gg. Sorry for your game, at least he will not pipe.
---
I’m not a fan of these fast games so anything that adds time I support currently. One ds isn’t an issue it was just when full teams had it that it got kinda crazy. I never use ds so I don’t care it’s changed. I never needed it. I might use the new one tho cuz that looks interesting. I agree the hatch is dumb but hey at least the killer has to use a perk slot for his version and the survivors can 100% deny it if they choose to. All survivors have to do is pop 2 gens which 90% of the time should be done before the first chase ends
---
Sort of like Michaels stalk/ Freddy’s power
---
Hacks?
---
English isn't your native language is it
---
It’s fine how it is. Killer can dodge no penalty and survivor can dc no penalty, both sides can avoid playing against super cancer stuff 
---
I play on ps4 what is nurse
---
Maybe Jason could pick up the survivor and stick the machete in there face and drop them, causing the machete to slide further into there face
---
Give it like 800 hours and you should be decent at them :)
---
Smh the devs really don't know what they're doing... 
---
But the entire reason that NOED didn't get nerfed is because it already had multiple ways to be countered by survivors.
---
Your solution for DS doesn't work because regardless the killer gets punished for DS and has to waste time recapturing a survivor through no fault of his own. 
---
As the other poster mentioned it's not really the same thing when the oh option killer really has is to pick a perk to minimise the effects of a perk, rather than having some gameplay option to counter it. (and juggling isn't really a solution when you have to be really close to a hook, and it still takes longer than it should through no fault of the killer. 
---
And leaving a player on the ground d until the toner rubs out on the new perk would waste the killers time.
---
 
---
Assuming the killer for the survivor within 10 seconds after they get unhooked, that still leaves 50 seconds of baby sitting a downed player while gens are getting done, which is a huge time penalty. 
---
Compare now to NOED:
---
1. Survivors can destroy all the totems with no perks before it ever procs. This isn't be even. Huge waste of time (unlike juggling) because they earn extra BP for them.
---
2. Even if it does proc survivors can find and destroy the totem (no perk required) to cancel it out. 
---
3. Even if survivors don't want to destroy totems, their main objective is to not get hit, so their regular gameplay cycle involves avoiding damage, and thus are encouraged to continue that goal. 
---
This is the opposite of what old DS does, which punished killers for actually playinythe objective, since multiple survivors could have DS and use it at any point. At least with the new version a killer is discouraged from tunneling as the survivor that just got unhooked might have it, while the other survivors definitely won't.
---
NOED punishes survivors for not doing totems (a separate objective that can help them), old DS punishes killers for no reason with no real counter play, only mitigation. 
---
Also as to the overall theme of your thread:
---
Historically killers have always been in short supply.
---
And this is because historically (especially the further back you go) survivors were the ones with the major advantages. 
---
I've played both since launch, I still remember infinites, vacuum pallets, and survivors that were able to self care so fast they could go back to max health before a killer could recover from their swing (without using an instant heal item)
---
This DS nerf was necessary, because DS was objectively worse for the game compared to something like NOED because it had no actual counter play. 
---
[Here was my concept that I posted a while back. I thought it could be pretty fun, though it ended up being very similar to what was later released as Spirit, funnily enough](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/74ya06/being_a_fanboy_and_doing_the_brainstorm_a_killer/)
---
Soooo what exactly stops you from inviting people to a discord?
---
Because ruin never last long enough to get a hook.
---
I hope this is true.
---
Doubt it. Every licensed killer has had a trailer. I don't see any reason why they wouldn't have one, even if it's for a PTB.
---
He coughs a lot.
---
Or just add a totem counter to a perk/base to give people a real reason to cleanse them when playing solo
---
Was a joke, but honestly the best perk for killer is pretty dependent on which you play overall bbq is only a good perk for the bonus bp otherwise perks like discordance and nurses are pretty solid 
---
This is part of the reason why I run Quick &amp; Quiet. 
---
I think it’d be cool if they added lore with him actually escaping the entity 
---
Because survivors shouldn't just be able to shut down part of what a killer does.
---
Hello Everyone I made a guide for Freddy please enjoy!
---
Sure, but it's also pretty basic. Sorry you couldn't understand it.
---
nope, nothing you can do other than rush gens and leave. It's not reportable. They just want to be a dick.
---
Tbagging isn’t always meant to be a dick move, in fact I’d say it’s generally just light hearted goofing off. Killers don’t see it I guess but pretty much every time two survivors find each other they tbag and point in my experience. When I play killer I think it’s hilarious when I fuck up and the survivor points or tbags instead of just continuing to run 
---
They don’t have much of a choice. Maybe they will add in voice chat with the dedicated servers. There isn’t a way to bridge the gap between solos and swf without it.  Or solos just have to accept the fact they cannot play at a certain level without grouping up because killers have to be able to compete with swf. If killers can’t compete then you don’t have a game. Not that unlike other games that heavily balance around a pro scene where full teams are utilized. Or an mmo where you have to group up to be successful. 
---
There is the option of removing swf but then you lose all those ppl who are just tryin to have fun playing games with their friends
---
This comment is underrated
---
Maybe try to set smaller goals for yourself each game and focus on those?  
---
You might not be able to get a 3k or 4k each game - RNG and survivor skill can often put that out of your control, which can definitely be stressful.  But you *can* ensure that you focus on aspects of your game you want to improve and try to block out the stress of "winning" every round.  Maybe try working on mind games at pallets, or getting the most out of your favorite perks.  You will get better the more you play, especially if you are focusing on parts of the game you want to improve, just keep at it and focus on smaller aspects of the game that you can control.
---
Is this the toxic survivor anonymous. Guys I’m sorry I once said “gg ez babykiller” after he dced with an instasaw. I’m so sorry everyone.

I don’t bitch about tunneling when you have the ability to dodge hits.

I don’t bitch about NOED when you have the ability to break totems.

What kinda argument is that?

I agree with those points, I feel like the best option would be to add a voice chat system with dedicated servers and try to, from then on, to balance with that in mind. Otherwise, SWF still has too much of an advantage.  
---
But, I'm not sure if they can. Only because they struggled with balancing as is. But I guess we will have to see
---
doctor is hot and i will literally drop kick you

This should be fan content with how good it is

Fuck you, Norway!

Those killers are annoying too???
---
A reply that roasts or attempts to calm down the other user that gets more upvotes than it should
---
This... You cant get much out of DS if you cant run the killer for a while. Most of the time ppl just go down in &lt;15s whilst noed can reward you with a kill despite playing bad the whole game
---
lmao I'm glad this wasn't just my first thought.
---
**I'd like it if they had a small terror radius (16 meters), could vault pallets as if they were windows, and could hide in lockers to remove their Terror Radius.**
---
However the most unique thing would be that there are two of them. The player would play Billy at first while Stu waits off-camera**. When entering a locker the player could choose to exit elsewhere on the map as Stu after a waiting period of 5 seconds.**
---
**Stu and Billy would be slightly different from each other.** 
---
**Stu has 115% movement speed and can activate his secondary ability to crouch like the Pig.** Exiting this state leaves his Terror Radius at 0 for the next 5 seconds. Stu can immediately attack from this state, however he cannot Grab a Survivor in this state and attacking causes his terror radius to immediately return. Missed attacks from Stealth suffer from a longer cooldown. Stu's lunge is longer than most Killers. 
---
**Billy has 110% movement speed and can activate his secondary ability to sprint forward at 125% movement speed, fast vaulting both vaults and pallets but being unable to see scratchmarks or hit the Survivor while in this state.** This sprint lasts for 15 seconds at base. Exiting is instant and does not cause a stun. It can be immediately resumed as long as there is more than 5 seconds available to run. It fully recharges after 30 seconds. Stunning Billy while he's in this state ends his power, but does not deplete it. Billy's knife wipe animation lasts longer than most Killer's.
---
**Sorry this is so long, I've bolded my main points. :P**
---
New ultralow setting
---
Where are the girlss
---
He looks like ew
---
I’ve been bitching? Lol ok I guess
---
wow, the "killer that can hide in a locker" idea for the 30 billionth time!
---
Considering that they have a full cosmetic store now which is is a major source of revenue I’m 100% certain they’ll negotiate to add extra cosmetics at launch and maybe to be released over time also with the licensors.
---
the kat von d within
---
Yes, I am joking. Seriously. 
---
I am very well aware of the differences, but thank you nonetheless
---
A real rank one spawns next to the totem
---
How about cleansing the killer? Survivors have to find various materials around the map and conduct a ritual to cleanse the killer of the evil within/the entity's presence.
---
Or more seriously- each survivor must assemble ingredients and bake a cake for Daddy Myers. At the end of the judging, all but a single survivor gets mori'd, winning their very own bakery and $50,000.
---
I’m not assaulting you? Back off the straw manning buddy
---
Non SWF have no way of knowing if the totems are cleansed . you don’t know what anyone else did and have no way to track how many are left . That’s the problem .   Tie a totem tracker into the small game perk  or put a timer on the exposed effect . 
---
I'd say it's more "sadistic" and it's not that bad
---
I’m pretty sure somewhere in the lore or it could’ve been said by the devs once, don’t quote me on it though lol, that every killer is human or was once human, so if that’s true Xenomorph wouldn’t count. It would also be kind of weird lore wise to explain how an alien with practically no conscience or mind other than to reproduce or kill would serve an inter dimensional being and perform sacrifices for him. I’d be willing to see them try and make it work though. 
---
Slowing the game down is the success.  And getting atleast 1 hook.
---
It doesn't make it so you can't hook someone??
---
Yo, wow dude. Thanks so much!
---
We even have a locker Dwight cosplay ready, he'll be using a Cardboard box for it! (:
---
Relevance?
---
I had this gen today with a chest on the other side of a log and a dull totem next to it.
---
Wait do you know hip hop? Khaled whole motto was they dont want to see us win. Thats why ruin being. Is apart of the meme. They want to gen rush and not let us get a 4K 
---
Judging by the tutorial? No.
---
Im not saying this because im a fuckin survivor main but the ds change isnt going to be fun at all UNLESS they make it so when your unhooked a killer cant instantly down you when you cant even run yet
---
There is not one in the Meyers map.
---
They said the new killer is the oldest of them all, so The Mummy maybe?
---
I play on 1440p so I’m trash.
---
Lobby* obviously 
---
Ive done a 3man 5gen before. Not sure how but its definitely one of my higher accomplishments lol
---
no u
---
Shut
---
If they’re swf then they all know where the totem is
---
Just because they're bad in-game doesn't mean they should be excluded in cool art. 
---
Oh, please. Remember the trailer. 
---
Whispers is visual in the sense that it lights up at the bottom of your screen when active as well
---
t1 BBQ. I can get more points from winning than a piddling 60% bonus to my LOSING BP total.
---
how so? 
---
Same I’m on console I literally cannot find a game when playing with my cousin 
---
I space serious games with a stupid games. Survivors being shitheads? Basement Myers. 
---
Immersed survivors? Hatchet practice on huntress. 
---
Some duche following you with a flashlight? Stand on the basement stairs with cloaked wraith. 
---
The main thing is to not psych yourself out thinking every single game must double pip- or single pip even- because that will only suck the joy out of the game
---
Oink
---
No skill legion? Now hold on pardner. I may be annoying as hell, but I am a *mediocre* skill Legion.
---
Accurate.
---
Can it be done?
---
No.
---
Should it be done?
---
Fuck.  Yes.
---
The character itself takes no skill to play for how rewarding his ability is 
---
Nice
---
I’m pretty sure Legion is already in the game lol
---
I got Legion and bought Joey before a.) they were widely hated, and b.) before I found out that Joey doesn't have a separate voice. Also, if you bothered to read my above comment, I was playing Legion for BP, not necessarily for fun. 
---
why Post this again?
---
I needed to change something, needed to get rid of something.
---
I love doing this shit as michael
---
Ok but there’s a difference between defending a hook from their whole team and standing there while all the gens pop. It’s boring for the hooked survivor and i don’t see how it is fun to be a killer who does this.
---
Hatchet daily. That's how I'd do it if I couldn't land hatchets.
---
So why not edit your old post
---
How is that logical at all. Just playing normally will get you more hatchet hits then that.

---
Dunno, getting a gen done before a single survivor is wounded is the way to go, dont immediately jump on a gen and wait for the killer to visit, if everyone does that they only discover someone on their 2nd lap.
---
a pig player let me escape when I loaded in as the only survivor. She played peekaboo. I pretended to arrest her (I was Tapp) in the basement. It was fun.
---
Was playing SWF with a low rank friend and also haven't played much after Rank Reset. I'm Rank 10 he's Rank 15 so we got put against rank 14s and 13s.
---
This guy would chase people and then stop Feral Frenzy when he got close. He had Frank's Mix Tape.
---
He didn't down anyone once all game. I didn't post the scores at the end (Killer left and my game is buggy so it shows them as having 0 Bloodpoints) but the match was pretty uhhhhh... it was something.
---
until dedicated servers no 
---
\^
---
Chane-sah = ayuk
---
I posted a video of this happening to me and it got removed &lt;/3
---
Another time it happened but the killer downed me, carried me away and then let me farm 
---
Yes, but relatively, legion players can be skilled. Instead of brainlessly using your power whenever and wherever, to cleverly utilize game sense and map knowledge, as well as auditory and visual aspects, to make things easier. Notice how I circled back? I hid my red stain and listened for her cries of pain to hear her, saving me a ton of time that could've been spent stabbing her 20 different times.
---
A legion who doesn’t play scummy? (Not that they can do anything if they don’t play a lil scummy) That’s pretty rare.
---
So you decide to Spam us, just for your convienience?
---
Not intentionally.
---
&gt; That was 2 years ago and a lot has changed since then including mechanics to end chases faster
---
Yet chases still last for ridiculous amounts of time with relative ease on the part of the survivor. Strange, no?
---
&gt; See this is the problem with maining one side
---
A killer main I may be, but survivor is still something I play very frequently, and rank 1 is where I've played for a very long time.
---
&gt; 2 years ago doesnt mean they still do
---
As a general concept, you're not wrong; however, in this particular case, you are. Survivors aren't nearly as powerful as they once were, but to pretend they're in a disadvantaged position in comparison to killers is flat out ridiculous.
---
You say you guys, why would you say that if you play both, you aren’t referring to yourself so I guess you are a killer main. Anyways, if killers didn’t lose their addons, it’s basically like an upgrade to their power, might as well give you guys infinite moris.
---
I lile the idea
---
Did you just assume it's gender?
---
cough cough blood warden
---
He is a worse hillbilly with an aoe saw that's only good for face camping. 
---
A missed call, you're in trouble if that's your mother young man.
---
I do agree that gens are getting done too fast, but barbecue and chili is still Op. 
---
Yeah I’d DC too if I saw my teammate waste a precious flashlight like that too
---
1. Hit them and let them go. Get some blood points before they escape. 
---
2. Don’t camp hatch and try to find them before they find hatch. If they get away then they get away, not a big deal. 
---
By camping the hatch you’re advertising to the survivors where it’s at and then you’re stuck in a hatch stand off that is not in your favor.
---
Also STBFL cause the killer can just chase you and down you for an extra stack before leaving you on the floor to be slugged.
---
Unless the survivor was an arse by messing with you or his survivor team, I'd say just let them otherwise it becomes a test of patience.
---
Always a pleasure to see more SFM work by you, Zombiehugger. :D
---
One problem that I saw brought up about this is that the killers could just walk together and trap people by bodyblocking
---
So one way of doing it would be to have one player play the killer of their choice, while the other plays a lesser role of some sort.
---
For instance, flying around as a crow that can ping survivor locations when it sees them, or a 'fake survivor' that can damage generators and works for the entity
---
If you make the killers compete against each other that could alleviate the issue somewhat
---
I.. I'm in lust
---
Oh come on they're doing something at least 
---
i do not do the lie
---
That’s amazing, the shading/lighting really brings it to life. 
---
Tell ‘em Large Marge sent ya!
---
We need Marge from Eggs for Bart
---
Cool I guess? People on this sub act like cellphones and other tabs don’t exist. 
---
Appreciate the complment, internet stranger. They're why I keep making them. :D
---
My baby huntress?
---
I'm on ps4 and I can't aim the flashlight for the life of me and it's all I had so it's useless for me lol
---
In that case, I retract my statement. 
---
man i have jumped out a 2nd story window the killer swings while i'm halfway to the ground and i get injured, have had a killer a couple meters behind me still get hit, i have jumped through a vault and took off running the killer swings after im clear of the vault window and i get injured. I dont think killers are overpowered, i believe survivors are and i am a survivor main, this game needs to be scary and uncertain, we as survivors should be getting caught more than escaping, it is a survival horror game or is suppose to be, honestly you know its getting bad when you are killer and after you down a really good player that loops you or jukes you for a while and as soon as you down them they dc the reason they do this is because they are sooooo use to winning they just can't grasp actually being bested by a killer and all of a sudden because said survivor is soo gooood and got downed by a killer then the killer must be OP, not everyone is like this of course but as a survivor main i say bring on more changes that make it more difficult to escape, make me sweat, make my heart race, make me earn that victory. So many survivor mains have perfected their escaping based on how the game has played for a while and as soon as the devs make a change the survivors start whining about it instead of just learning the new systems in place and perfecting their skill again, it is laziness and arrogance plain and simple. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
TL;DR lots of people including myself have experienced bad hitboxes on pc and console and survivors have it to easy as a survivor main i want more of a challenging scary game so i say make killers more powerful, as of now it is far to easy.
---
(Rebuttal about how rank does matter.)
---
:) that scene in the cab of the truck scared the shit out of me as a kid :)
---
Man I'm at over 1500 hours on ps4 and I still can't consistently hit ruin checks cause of how choppy the FOOKIN game is.
---
Never had those problems. But I get you. Also as soon as you end a chase it's almost guaranteed they have DS. I'm glad they're nerfing it. 
---
she is a polygon nightmare lol
---
Same, I Mainers killer for a long ass time but now it’s just boring how easy it is to 4k a non swf 
---
Why would they nerf an underpowered Killer?
---
Oh wait...They did.
---
It was Freddy. Within a week of him being released.
---
&lt;3
---
Feel free to use them how you want. That's why I include the template every time!
---
You also do not need to tag me when you do post them, but it helps me find it and feel a little bit happier on the inside
---
I hope the next survivor is a girl That will become nea 2.0
---
https://youtu.be/TNNAhcAqi8M
---
Meant to say instead of buffing the killer. And freely wasn't UP but they nerfed him too much. 
---
Well, they did say it was going to be their oldest killer. 
---
There’s not really a point to fix it, it rarely happens and they’d probably just fuck something up if they tried because this game is coded like a rubber band ball 
---
If someone's internet is so bad that they're disconnecting so frequently that a 15 minute ban is a problem, maybe they should consider doing something about that internet before playing online and consistently ruining 4 other people's games. 
---
It basically comes down to making a decision when you down the second to last guy. If you just want to get on with it and move on to the next match hook them and just assume the 4th is going to get hatch. If you're in the mood and have the patience for a 4 man then slug the 3rd and go play hide and seek for the last one.
---
No mither is awful outside of dedicated hook sabotage squads. 
---
Oh look! Another irrelevant number in my life.
---
I've done a few other ones already, but none of them got as good as this one
---
Hey, you've been doing this stuff for a long time now, go for it!
---
dumping points on him till 40 is a better idea. franklin’s demise is a good perk against those lobbies with 4 flashlights or toolboxes
---
Yeah just take your lose and cry about it on reddit, guys DS got nerfed but "what about when I lost the game, what am I supposed to do then? killers not strong enough after they already lose the game can we buff this devs"?
---
Down someone and facecamp them with leatherface. Really calms the soul after some shitty matches. 
---
the paper will be as empty as my lobby when playing killer
---
Why are upvotes disabled? This masterpiece could bring in SO much karma!
---
Would love to see you draw Myers  :)
---
100% accurate
---
Yeah if you suck with aiming that is. 
---
Damn that's a good drawing!
---
This conversation is fucking ascended
---
I tried, but he kept staring at me
---
Hit boxes are definitely goofy. For everyone, not just survivors.
---
Nice!
---
Perk Roulette, various meme builds, working on achievements. 
---
That sucks
---
It's basically making it to where if you do get downed right away you'll be able to get right back up due to the longer stun and increased skill check hitbox
---
yes U DO
---
NOED is very powerful, but I think if the survivors devote enough time, it can be shut down.
---
Blocked And Reported.
---
I mean, NOED is annoying, but I don't think it's a super great perk. Survivors who are playing "optimally" will usually have ds, killers playing "optimally" won't usually run NOED.
---
Would be nice if matches as a whole were stretched out a little bit. Maybe give Survivors alternate ways to escape instead of just gens, but also make gens longer since those alternate means would require more objective consideration and management on the killer's part when trying to impede survivor progress. I dunno.
---
Find them before they find the hatch. There’s not a single reason to be in a stand off. Just hit them and move on if it comes down to it.
---
What's wrong with the Fredster
---
Why would it be? 
---
That spooked the fuck outta me. 
---
Have you made your choice yet?-
---
I mean, only the survivors are to blame if there is an active noed at the end of the game. The totems are part of your objectives and if you don't cleanse them then you can't bitch about going down in one hit after the gates are open
---
Nope. There's a definitive end (you finishing bleeding out).
---
It seems like the devs are actually trying pretty hard lately. Give them some credit, they're not an enormous team. If I had any criticism it'd mostly be that they haven't set their sights high enough; DbD 2 with better coding and less simple game play would be welcome imo, but what they're doing with what they have is pretty respectable.
---
Bought dlc packs but no costumes due to pricing. As some others have said, I would buy costumes I like for $5 but I won’t buy anything for $10.
---
No, because there's a definite end (surv bleeds out). If the killer just trapped them in a corner and refused to let them move that would be a different story. 
---
This is just a dick move. 
---
Huntress is hit or miss for high ranks either you blow them out completely or you get shit on
---
This method doesnt fix the problem that survivors get less bp than killers naturally though :/
---
Which is something I forgot to bring up
---
Ok, so it only counts as holding the game hostage if it literally never ends. Good to know
---
Huntress is very map dependent. She has glaring weaknesses and on maps where she can't reliably hatchet at loops she *really* struggles.
---
Hag is map dependent too, but she is so good at manipulating the map she can sometimes make up for it. Hag is weird because the way she plays is unlike any killer.
---
I forgot all about Legion.
---
Slug the second-to-last survivor and go hunting. This works best for Freddy for obvious reasons.
---
Make up your own little rules, I've seen people do that. I've had killers who would only camp Feng Mins and then let everyone else get out, trap someone in a corner for all five gens then see what they say post game, etc.
---
Or take a break. Sometimes that's all you need :)
---
As in I’m running to a pallet with and throw it down as the killers invisible knife reach hits me.
---
That or clearing a vaulted window and still getting hit. But I guess that could be latency 
---
Exactly. Trapper is kinda the same way, but less likely to do good.
---
I say you guys because its easier and addons arent that strong, most of them at least
---
But you also do not get hit.
---
Some good points about spreading out but pigeonholing into one build seems counter-intuitive as it requires you to farm those abilities first, and then find them on the bloodweb which is unlikely. Also didn't go over which perks not to go for like overcharge as it will make waking up incredibly easy or increased terror radius perks as people in the dreamworld outside his terror radius are highlighted.  
---
Also your fallback strategy on tunneling one person didn't sit right with me. Freddy is an effective slugger and simply leaving them on the ground while in the dreamworld can create a feedback loop on where survivors are. You can weigh whats scummier but if I waited 20 minutes to get into a game, immediately being shot back out with nothing to show for it really sparks my hate for this community. 
---
I've had hit box issues here and there but honestly it's hard to tell if it's hitbox or connection issues sometimes. I'm not sure if you can tell, actually. Outside of that I've been pretty baffled by some of the stuff complained about on this subreddit too. Apparently a lot of people get lobby dodged? I very rarely have. 
---
Wonder if it's a console vs. PC thing, a lot of people don't specify. 
---
It would be too much strong in Lerys and The Game.
---
There is no way to combat it except slugging the second to last guy and drawing the game out. which according to survivors, you are complete trash for doing. So do it.
---
So it wasn't confirmed?
---
I do wish that if you get the pallet stun you don't get smacked, but I can also see why they don't change that. It's one of the few things I will whine about when I play haha
---
Get dodged a million times in a row too. I'll try to play before work and waste probably 45 mins altogether trying to find matches, with a majority of those resulting in me getting tunneled, camped, and mori'd. Make a post on here begging changes to minimize dodging and get tons of downvotes saying "but swf!"
---
It is extremely difficult to get you rank to go down below 15 after you've been above it. You have to not play for many months. Either that happened, or he was just a cheater and his previous account got banned.
---
Your fault for playing on a console.
---
OP was asking for killer tips, not surv tips, friend! 
---
This is great and all, but I don’t know if I should give you credit for making the remake version better.  ANYTHING’S better than the remake. 
---
I feel like it was a printed image, this is way too fucking good
---
You're right, but that makes me feel like we'd be notified before the PTB that it would be licensed (with the whole new character purchase system) and the clues we've been given just don't lead me to any specific licensed character. Of course, I could be completely wrong. Hopefully we find out soon!
---
Would be like Freddy where farmers rush the unhook after a survivor has been hooked
---
I play at 1440p. Why would that make a difference?
---
Tunneling is only optimal for noobs. 
---
Woww that’s incredible! Nice work!
---
That's not a mallet. It's a fucking sledge hammer.
---
Honestly it sounds more like nerf if it happens automatically. If I was facing a wraith and knew that it would make an instant rescue way more viable I feel.
---
Wait, where did you get Huntress? They're playing Bubba in the screenshot
---
If you want to prevent playing against those.  I get to say no caludettes, borrowed time, adrenaline, etc.
---
Hag is arguably the 2nd best killer in the game. 
---
Her pressure, chase potential and defence are insane. She is a God when played well and is unbeatable if the Hag is skilled. She isn't hit or miss unless you aren't comfortable with her kit and play style.
---
Huntress isn't as hit or miss as people think, she's very solid but some maps do screw her more than others.
---
Trapper is definitely one of the worst killers in the game for sure though.
---
ET phone home
---
when has a legion ever outplayed someone by using skill?
---
Ah glass bead lol. 
---
I remember the first time I saw it used it was in a random spot and I wasted so much time trying to figure out what it was lol.
---
It's supposed to be very useful in marking a hatch, but I've only seen it like twice, and never for that lol.
---
Problem I have with stealth killers is that the best stealth killer in the game is scratched mirror Myers. 
---
Not much you can do as survivor other than die faster, but killer has all kinds of fun options. Like seeing how many consecutive traps you can get a survivor to run into with Trapper (hilarious when it works), or a bizarre behavioral thing like slugging someone then staring at them till they die. Had a Myers do this one match. There's also trying to 4k with what people consider poor perks or combinations, y'know handicaps. 
---
You do know survivors run at 100% and (most) killers go 110-115% right?
---
A screenshot of 1v1 survive with friends? Who you trying to fool here?
---
Hahaha that's a joke right?
---
If you swing you have a chance of hitting though... Either way
---
Rank 20s are clueless against anyone.
---
Doctor's only strength without addons is sometimes he can cancel an important action with his shock. with addons he becomes slightly better, but any survivor with half a brain can deal with him easily.
---
Huntress on a map with high walls on the loops gets bodied. It doesn't matter how good you are with your aim if you can't get a bead on them. Without hatchets, she is slow and easy to track with her hum.
---
Legion is surprisingly good if you don't play him like cancer, the mere fact he gets a free hit in a chase makes him better then D tier.
---
Hag is very map dependent, but on a good map she is nigh-unstoppable.
---
So I mean, yes?
---
If there are few chokepoints on a map ( rotten fields, shelter woods) you are gonna have a bad time.
---
Ok.
---
I don't think I can agree, like nurse can absolutely be more devastating and down faster, but I feel legion is way more annoying because the moonwalk technique doesn't really have counterplay, and is way easier to use. 
---
At least when I nurse pushes my shit in I know it's because they put the time in to be that devastating.
---
Obviously wasn’t purple. Also, while I like your spunk, just don’t throw firecrackers at your feet. 
---
Umm? Not at all.
---
She is by no means unbeatable even if you are amazing. The set up time, her 110% movement speed. She really needs a good setup and even if she does, immersed survivors can really detriment her. She's not 2nd best, not by a long shot.
---
So you’re wanting new DS to basically also have borrowed time on it? New DS is made to discourage tunneling, and adding a borrowed time effect on it just doubles down on anti-tunneling. And makes it broke as shit, which is exactly what they’re trying to avoid. 
---
the doctors eyes are pried open of course he’s blinded 
---
Or he runs the killer and carries the game
---
Lol
---
I just feel that he could immediately uncloak and smack the ever loving Nea out of either one of them. Just like a regular killer
---
Thats not what im saying its just unfair if you get unhooked and get hit while you cant move
---
That and because the survivor might have DS, and the killer might not want to risk losing the kill as a result. 
---
The killer isn't really doing anything to extend the match beyond bleed out. 
---
On the other hand I remember a trapper that farmed me for BP, he would set two traps side by side and walk into one to drop me into the other (I had stopped struggling ) and he rinse and repeated for like 20 minutes.
---
I dunno the exact numbers for how fast a Survivor runs, or a killer, so I just adjusted to what I assumed
---
In GTAO, I can fly the fastest jet, swoop down every 2 minutes to blow up 10 vehicles through the whole map without dropping frames in a 30 person server where they are all doing their own thing.
---
In DBD, I can't run across the map without frame drops in a KYF match with 1 survivor (who literally lives 5 minutes down the street).
---
Not everyone DC's to know how it works, point-wise...
---
Heh, I kinda did stuff like that, too! I remember when you had your icon as Dwight being clocked in the face by the Wraith!
---
Unless the killer is literally being drained of bloodpoints the longer they camp them what bp are they losing? Did you forget that bp on the survivors side also requires interaction between killer and survivor like the alturism category (thats more survivor with survivor, but you can only get the bonus for initially meeting a teammate if the killer isnt hooking or hitting survivors) and almost all the scoring events for boldness? How do you lose bp you don't get to begin with. Everyone in the match suffers for bp when the killer camps 
---
She is the only killer who like Nurse can be at 4 survivors at once.
---
Her traps allow for chase ending quickly, map pressure and insane defence.
---
Her 110% isn't a detriment because you aren't chasing with her and if you are you are using her wrong. You build your web around the map and keep survivors zoned inside it.
---
Flashlights are a counter but crouching is not. If they crouch they waste time and leave the trap in play for a later point in the match. 
---
A good Hag owns the match before you even start losing players, it's a game of chess and she knows the pieces
---
Prem only...? Child's play. Prem + Spine Chill FTW.
---
You trap loops and travel paths. Hag doesn't struggle if she knows how to trap well
---
&gt;Doctor's only strength without addons is sometimes he can cancel an important action with his shock.
---
This alone makes him better when well timed.
---
&gt;Huntress on a map with high walls on the loops gets bodied. 
---
This is only on a few maps, though.
---
&gt;if you don't play him like cancer
---
Not sure what you mean?
---
&gt;but on a good map she is nigh-unstoppable.
---
She is *pretty good* with a skilled player and good map. Her problem *is* her map dependency and her various downsides when setting traps or when in chases. She can be good, but she is otherwise not the greatest.
---
Love how I got downvoted for saying I reported literal cancer in human form. Really shows how good this community is.
---
Other than borrowed time what perks can you run to combat camping? The ways to combat a killer who is truly out to camp include: no one get hooked at all during the match, hope he sucks at camping.
---
Borrowed time is easy to go against especially with an instadown killer who won't even let you unhook someone 
---
I see what you did there 😎
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patch_Notes_2.2.0
---
If you can’t move while being unhooked you don’t take damage. 
---
No, its not a swf. I was legitimatly put into a game with no one else except me
---
He is just practising on how to outplay people who run the new Ds
---
Huntress and hag should be higher, but other than that,  I think you done a pretty good job so far.
---
I generally hate destruction 100 memes, but I like the twist.
---
Neat
---
Honestly I've started using haunted grounds with ruin just because if that lol.
---
Start match, they see ruin, immediately find totem, think it's ruin (*pray it's not ruin*) and let the fun begin lol.
---
I just broke Haunted Grounds. -Do you hate me- Are you proud of me?
---
Definitely my favorite killer. Great art!
---
And then they break the ruin when you camp them lol.
---
That doesn't mean survivors deserve to play with bugs that inhibit the game play? 
---
This. Dying light was a neat perk dammit
---
Woah, this is ridiculously good. 
---
Just made the skill check smaller that’s all. 
---
Yah the queue times have been horrible on PS4 today! Then I go play killer and waited 4 mins for people to load in, guess it’s BhVRs crappy servers! 
---
Thank you :D I'm just so fed up with disconnects... Literally 3 games with Legion today. A total of 5 disconnects smh
---
Yup that’s sums it up!
---
Hitboxes not broken... you can swing at air and end up hitting someone
---
Seems normal to me
---
Good list but hag should be higher I think
---
Sounds like communist propaganda but okay. 
---
I had no idea that the distance of stalking effects how fast the bar fills up. Thank you!
---
Big Chungus has been a bit on edge after his meme died and his game Big Chungus 11 sold poorly. I wouldn’t hold this against him too much.
---
Don’t believe there lies brother, soon we will suckle on the bee’s P1 stinger
---
No but if someone else DCs, you'll see they always have 0 points. What magical world do you live in where you don't get annoying DCs
---
Bruh, why?
---
16meters and even with that you can pip, did a little insidious Leatherface basement camping to try the emblem system out and I always piped.
---
And the new map will be called "The Hive."
---
that chainsaw looks amazing
---
I never go past rank 10 anymore.
---
National Treasure Guaranteed Rainbow Map with 2 add ons, Face off - Screams creating a notification needs to be out of chase for 60 seconds, Why won’t you die, Gain an extra phase on the hook for 30,60,90 seconds
---
This blew up a bit thanks guys
---
I mean. I’m just human. 
---
Actually, I’m a Rank 1 survivor and killer main, so nice try. Also, the perk is broken, I don’t know why you haven’t realised that by now.
---
I feel like bots would only cause you to practice skills that wouldn't be helpful at all against actual killers. The devs would be hard pressed to design AI that actually works in  the game without glitching out, much less an AI that effectively mimics player use of strategy, their tendency to fuck up, and the crazy bullshit they try to pull. Playing both sides is 50% mind gaming, and you just can't program that.
---
You have perfected the video I posted of this weeks ago! Applauds all around.
---
Its funny because the same exact thing happened to me in Farcry 5, the sound to open vault doors during certain segments were the generator completion sounds. 
---
Coolio
---
If doc fake switching into treatment mode. 80% of the time you get the grab. 
---
Did an eldritch monstrosity who's sole purpose is to torture the souls of the living in an eternal, cyclical hell give you the flashlight? If not, that's probably the reason. 
---
Regress themselves, alert you and can be retagged with no punishment
---
Meme games can be a good way to bring some fun back into the game! Especially when the other side joins in. These games tend to be more fun then going trihard 
---
but 115% speed on survivors would be way higher than the normal Speed 
---
&gt;infinite t3
---
&gt;no mither david
---
Whats the point
---
I think survivors, in many respects, have been nerfed to the ground is all. It sometimes feels like a lot of killer mains want to call everything a survivor uses or does as too op. Exhaustion perks have already been nerfed pretty effectively and you still think SB is too powerful? And don't even get me started on those hitboxes. They're absolutely garbage and many killers like you think they're still entitled to more. 
---
You’re not P3 Claudette that’s why
---
On PC at least, DbD has regularly oscillated between about ~20k and 35k. Not weird to see a lull now, since the last chapter was a while ago and the last event was kinda underwhelming
---
Honestly each survivor can be hooked up to 3 times, lets say you’re up against a good r1 team, everyone can run the killer for at least a minute + carrying to a hook lets say about 1:20 minutes per hook so that’s 4 minutes just for 3 hooks, in case the killer tunneled only one person, that’s 1 sacrifice in 4 minutes. So 16 minutes for 4 sacrifices. And I’m not even including time spent while not in a chase.
---
The game won’t be killer biased because if the killer plays fair without tunneling games would be long intensive and fun.
---
If noed needs to be nerfed then so does adrenalin, can get a free escape st the end game that otherwise wouldn't normally happen.
---
I just don’t like legions cause of the grey-ish effect when you’re deep-wounded
---
Leatherfaces are usually baby killers who facecamp lmao
---
Do people use Iron Maiden seriously? It just seems so impractical that it's like a meme perk to me
---
I suppose you are giving up a perk slot that could be used for an advantage during the gen stage (I've seen people calling it the 'setting yourself up to fail perk' as well for that particular reason). So I'll take back universal.
---
that doesn't give you points though. It is more optimal to escape and get into a new match quickly. If you are gonna suggest something that killers don't like that gives you points, Try flashlight blinds and farming your teammates.
---
"Who you gonna call?"
---
"Toxic survive with friends!"
---
He's so happy tho 
---
Me: holds up meme
---
"Is this Tru3talent in a meme?"
---
I SAWED THIS **PALLET** IN HALF!
---
Hammer is a bit... big...
---
The mask looks a bit off (it's hard to get it so I don't blame you)
---
But damn that's some nice shade, 8/10
---
Wtf I've played this game so much and I've NEVER seen this addon haha
---
Frank’s Mixtape + Cold Dirt = DC
---
The rest add-ons are fine, so I can have a small chance to escape.
---
It seems almost every time I try to play with my brother/friends who aren't good at DbD at all we get facecamping, hold down M2 Leatherface or tunnel the baby survivor off the hook with a mori.
---
Then they just quit and go on to something else. As a killer main, I know DS can be frustrating but the more I survivor nerfs they push out the harder it is to get people into the game.
---
 I've just stopped recommending Dead by Daylight to my IRL friends as I don't want my buddies to think I hate them and their time.
---
Careful is fine, but for me it seems only way to get any blood points is to be altruistic and to play aggressive. When I use to play a more careful approach I’d get iridescent on gens nothing for chase and silver on the other two, and 12000 bp. Once I got more aggresive I got more blood points, started ranking up faster, and won more games 
---
Wraith: RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!
---
Doctor: *Hides in locker*
---
Micheal Myers: *INTENSE MOUTH BREATHING*
---
Freddy, Spirit, Nurse, Legion, and Billy are all gone.
---
Trapper, Hag, and Huntress are hooked.
---
Cannibal, cradling his chainsaw, hides in a corn field as the inevitable approaches. 
---
I play until I find out they are running franks or moonwalking. 
---
yeah, then again, maps aren’t very useful anyways so it makes sense
---
If it weren’t about low FPS and laggy, I’m really fine with hitting great skill check.
---
No luck loopin them killers then?
---
It’s just the one killer actually.
---
I agree so much with you. Lately I've been playing a lot of solo survivor at red ranks and most games we don't repair the 5 gens. We waste a lot of time going for saves or looking for a totem when someone actually already found it. Actually the fastest games, the ones we repair 5 gens, are the ones I don't try to save or cleanse, because I just assume my teammates are doing it.  
---
I decided to replace 1 of my perks for kindred and games became much more like the 4 man swf experience too. So clearly the communication thing is not something to overlook.
---
And people shouldn’t dc because they should have to play something they don’t want to because other people like it?
---
Take that odd bulb off, disgusting.
---
I actually rarely use flashlights I hate them. 
---
If you ban toxic people, shit that's over half the players
---
Even though I’m a toxic survivor main, I feel bad for this situation cuz it unfair..
---
Omg LMAO
---
Oh, ok. That makes sense.
---
He's in Limbo 
---
I wouldn't rule it out. Wasn't Freddy's announcement delayed because they had to wait on permission from the copyright holders? We've not gotten the slightest hint at why things aren't on track right now. It would make sense if it was because they're not allowed to say anything.
---
Clearly, I'm just saying it'll be far less frequent, like it was before the patch. Only saw complaints spike once it was changed.
---
Just made the ui lettering smaller that’s all. First time I noticed it was when I started working on a gen with hex ruin on. 
---
A lot of people would just legit quit the game if they did either of these things, they’ll never do it. 
---
Very kewl 
---
Why Z-Block is considered as F tier? It should be in A or S rank imo.
---
Don't say that, my heart ;/
---
They encourage tunneling and makes freddy a worser wraith. Out of all addons, blocks give you the least advantages
---
You can cloak yourself pretty quickly and at normal walking speed, I'd rather have the control
---
Did you not read what I said? 😂😂 telling someone to kill themselves is not trashy? It’s inappropriate and unnecessary that should be a banning offense. I love how you get mad at me saying camping is trashy while I agree with the rest of what you said😂😂 salty much
---
My 12 yr old stepson plays like this.  It’s reached the point now where I won’t let him play unless he actually does something other than hide in closets.
---
Trying to do my part for the other survivors out there...
---
I mean,  it's not like you have to kill yourself LOL. I always laugh if I get killer hate mail, it's hilarious. I've also recieved hate mail as survior from killers,  even more hilarious. Just don't read it, and camping to me is absolutely toxic. You're legit ruining the game for someone else,  how can you get more toxic than that? Oh, by saying mean words that you could leave to prevent? Meh. Only way camping is understood is if someone is extremely toxic to you in game or gates are powered. 🤷‍♀️
---
*is Scratched Mirror Myers with Iron Maiden*
---
They shouldn’t have fucked with DS and they shouldn’t fuck with NOED. DS gives survivors another chance or atleast  8 seconds and a third hit. Just like NOED let’s a killer clean up a shitty game. I’ve fucked over killers with ds and been fucked over by NOED, just like on my killer I’ve been fucked by ds and fucked people over with noed. And honestly as killer if you had to work real hard to catch a guy and get d striked and then he runs you some more, you probably should have given up the chase. Most survivors are dog shit runners, don’t tard out on the one guy that can loop you forever at beggining of match. 
---
Isn't that the truth. 😂 
---
Real rank 1 survivors hit the ruin skill check while in madness tier 2. 
---
RIP to me, I ain't doing that shit
---
Idk why dev designed this guy to be a hard camper. Maybe they’d like to promote camping in this game.
---
I’ve never seen Hot Fuzz and so when they said it was from that movie I got super confused because I recognised it from Shaun of the Dead 😂🤦🏼‍♀️
---
Very true
---
That's an in game screenshot put onto paper
---
Jesus that is amazing!
---
That's just the thing. The only time I've ever camped is when the gaters are powered. or if I know they're close. Besides that's obvious because you don't hit rank 1 as killer by hooking someone and standing beside him until he dies. That's how you get gen rushed to death.
---
You expect every killer to play fair. It’s very rare to not have a killer tunnel even if they’re playing top tier. You’re also not including bringing ruin or map presence . If you were to make it longer you would make the game “Kill by Daylight” “Killing is the only good thing you can do because what is escape?”. Killers don’t need to tunnel since things have already shifted pretty drastically. Now I’m not saying gen rush teams aren’t annoying and all. Because they are but making gens longer will just make the game boring. 
---
You're right friend. I just never saw the otherside until I played as both
---
"Good killers" won't be so good once dedicated servers make their appearance. The only reason that killers still get the hit from the other side of pallets is because of the awful latency issues in this game.
---
He is free already
---
I thought she is hard to play
---
If half of us must go to crate a more stable and less toxic environment then so be it
---
Then I would just leave,  and ignore the hate mail tbh. It's never gonna stop,  this shit goes on in all games sadly. 
---
Both are shitty perks that reward failure of the player with a massive reward. Still ur right they arent the same as DS has been changed while NOED has been allowed to remain as the dumb perk it is. Again this discussion is about wanting a totem counter stay on topic
---
Takes a bit of practise. You have to sound whore alot
---
Michael. He's op af
---
I mostly play killer with my friends in a party so idk 
---
Can’t buy him with shards might consider buying him tho
---
This was like a 4% of the entire game..
---
Hmmm, imma dick around in photoshop and see if I can make this even better.
---
Be us. Rank 1. vs a Myers on the smaller Autohaven Map where shack is in the dead center of the map.  Myers already slurped EW energy out of everyone except me and we have 3 survivors alive and healthy.  1 generator remaining.
---
Just outside the shack in the center, another teammate and I are working a hit-and-run on a gen.  (Myers returns, we flee; chases after either of us a bit, kicks gen, we run back in; repeat.) Another gen to the side of the shack that can't reasonably be worked, and last one on the opposing side of the shack, farthest possible distance on the other end of this small map with lots of jungle gym.  Looks like a guaranteed win at this point.
---
We've been keeping this up expecting our third to be making some headway on that far generator.  Well, it's been just about 2 full generators worth of time since this tactic started.. should be almost done by now with the near-zero pressure on that far gen.  I decide to move around the outside to get to that generator and help top it off.
---
Bond reveals a Claudette hiding in the far corner within farting distance of the generator that isn't even regressing; It hasn't been touched AT ALL.  Happy ending to this story.  I start working on the gen, Claudette finds some bravery and comes out to help. I see Mike coming and slip away.  She doesn't.   
---
She gets found, chased, and killed as the center gen is completed and we escape.  I'm certain that I wouldn't have been satisfied with that match if Claudy escaped with us at that point.
---
**TL;DR**: Immersed Claudette couldn't be bothered to touch the safest generator for over 5 minutes.  Eventually died.  Final 2 escaped.
---
90% sure this is a repost
---
wouldn't be surprised if it was a curse
---
Its more then just that. this game has real issues, forget balance, at its core it is buggy, runs like shit, ugly and optimized. On PC there are NO ADVANCED GRAPHICAL SETTINGS. There are still infinite loading screens, no dedicated servers, a lack of content and what do they do instead of fixing their damn game? They fucking port it to switch. Their priorities aren't right.
---
Paint Thinner too high and Freddy's URs are dogshit
---
I bought leatherface solely for bbq. I decided to try him and got 4 people escapes on me. A guy after messaged me telling me to stop playing leatherface cuz I was extremely bad. 
---
Well thats good because since DS got changed i want NOED to be changed. But honestly this change doesnt even nerf NOED it just gives a bit more information to survivors about totems remaining. 
---
Id honestly rather NOED was heavily changed like DS so it wasnt so shitty to go against. But that wont be happening it seems so this totem change will have to do
---
I can totally understand and agree with every point you just made, just trying to offer a solution haha
---
Legion: play out
---
Frank's Mixtape or Moonwalking: Instant MLGA block and disconnect
---
I mean they don't like it for a good reason, it shouldn't be in the game.
---
Honestly they reset ranks to much I’ll leave the game for a few months then come back and I’m back to rank 18 then I’m playing new guys with my built up spirit or I’m looping baby killers with my survivor. Your rank should never reset past whatever color you are if your green, your green till you hit purple and you can’t derank back to yellow. I like the rank play but some aspects are silly
---
The biggest flaw to spirit is when you phase, the survivors are invisible. 
---
I like to get a hit then use phase as they usually run which the phase does show scratch marks (unless you use one of her add ons) so it's an easy second hit
---
That's what you get for playing legion
---
I've noticed a lot of legions like to camp. Like a good 50% of them. 
---
Hag is A or S tier.
---
Doc is C-tier at best
---
Trapper is D-tier at best
---

I had sort of agreed, until this.

Traced
---
I just made this so im not sure its a repost if just similar conent.... 
---
Because at R1 without franks you have to tunnel for a million years to kill anything. But if you use franks, you’re toxic.
---
Vigil should be less useless if it also reducing cool down of Make Your Choice or Haunted Ground too.
---
Myers so many bad maps, without fast-stalk some maps are unplayable.
---
Clown punishes survs for being greedy, but his bottles only shorten loops.
---
At that point if recommend switching killers 
---
Hm, idk
---
Exactly, people act like Behavior ignores these issues. Some bugs are hard to fix. 
---
Oh my god I fucking love Jeffree. New Perk: Welcome Back to My Channel! The first time you find every survivor, that single survivor gains the exposed status effect for 40/50/60 seconds.
---
It’s not their fault legion is F tier :(

My name is "Billy" Thompson, and I'm the fastest man alive.

If we shouldn't care, then why post it here?

I too love giving survivors heart attacks
---
Still better than Freddy tho, gotta give them some credit
---
I’ve definitely seen it, with nea too.
---
No wasps? Okay..

Z Block is meh, theres much better addons. I wouldn't say D but rather C
---
Black Box should be F, Paint thinner C, Z block C. Everything else is great.
---
You sound like such a brat, I’m gonna make this quick - Most killers camp or tunnel because they’re scared of losing their guaranteed kill, or they’re scared of getting t-bagged at the exit gate. Most people playing this game aren’t psychopaths that just like to feed off others’ frustration , is this what you’re implying? That all killers just WANT to camp?
---
If you ain’t gonna say anything useful just dislike my post and move on with your life, you’re the type I hate discussing with.
---
It's still going to fix a lot of problems.

Thank you.
---
Yea but they all died, so who’s fault is that?
---
THANK YOU. Jesus Christ ive seen so many tunneling Freddys with double blocks and noed who complain in the end game chat that hes trash. Learn to spread the pain lmao
---
Hopefully this is a 4man swf otherwise ur ruining game for the last survivor by being idiots
---
Literally was in a game where three survivors just kept hopping in and out of basement lockers while I ran around being chased for 5 mins only to see that crap. Totally stupid
---
If you play pc, leave lobby. If you play console block chats from people who aren’t friends. Only thing devs can do is get rid of post game chat. Seriously just ignore the shit, it is completely in your power to not listen to salty d bags half way across the country 
---
Glad Im not the only one who noticed
---
And you forget that as a business that charges money for software, their job is to improve it when it doesn't work, and when they add new content that breaks the functionality of their code, they are obligated to fix it.
---
Steadily degrading hitbox quality (even with &lt;70 ms ping), infinite loading screens, games that don't load in with all 5 players (very consistently), very unprofessional console ports, game-breaking bugs every 3rd patch that take weeks or months to get addressed and would've been obvious to anyone that played the game for 10 minutes?
---
All of this is Behaviour saying "we know its not up to industry standards, even compared to other indie studios, but we have no competitor and every single one that's tried has failed so fuck you :)"
---
Also, they lost the "small indie dev" excuse the second they released the very pricey cash shop. Nearly every game I play has at least 1 outfit from the shop. It's a very obvious financial success for minimal work.
---
Playing solo survivor is significantly more stressful than playing killer imo, because randos are always such a hit or miss.
---
Click the add-ons section or whatever and then go back to the perks. It's a bug.
---
General Repost!
---
This is the perfect angle, honestly. I'm ready for whatever you wanna give me &lt;3
---
They need to fix the latency that’s the only reason killers get that hit. Once it’s fixed that all killers will bitch about 
---
But Legion is the best killer in the game :^)
---
I'm happy when I stun killers with pallets without being hit
---
Dude, this is over 2 months old
---
I was thinking of how enduring ignored less of it. At least that's how it was interpreted to me numerically
---
I mean, I don't think it should be nerfed, since it isn't a super top tier perk or anything. Maybe reworked.
---
But yes. I really do hate adrenaline. It's the worst fucking feeling, and it double fucks the worst killer in the game.
---
I think it is as they want it honesty. In a horror situation. Surviving solo would naturally be way way harder then surviving as a group. They can add voice chat but they can’t force people to use it. Me personally if I’m flying solo I just play killer. If my friends are on the way we group up and play together. Playin solo as survivor is asking for trouble. Half the time it’s other solo survivors getting you killed cuz they have a separate agenda like getting points 
---
It’s not part of game design

---
Oh Mr. Bong Bong. 
---
Julie would look cooler if her hair was exposed. 
---
It would kill the game sadly. More and more people would leave. 
---
Shit I might have too. Played 2 matches and both killers face camped. Got off after that.
---
You’re delusional if you actually believe that. They are doing it because it takes less skill and they find it to be their easiest path to get kills. Yeah, they’re going to suddenly stop because generators take longer or whatever...please.
---
Spirit. Best in game.
---
Listen here, you little shit
---
More Doctors memes plz.
---
Prestige 3 (Bloody clothes) you can get p1 after you level up to level 50 but when you do it resets the character so all the perks you had are gone but you can get them back its confusing to explain 
---
Still art
---
I mean we’re shrugging off barely any more. It’s not gonna be so much of a change that it’s like “WOW” but I’d rather take a reduced 3 second stun than a reduced 4 second stun. 
---
Most games yes, but against a good Swf team?
---
Blocks in general are pretty garbage, just lowering the transition time is nowhere near as good as most of his other effects which make being asleep much more punishing.
---
Crippling action speed, lowering skill check odds and especially class photo's global reveal all allow you to keep more people asleep at once and penalise them harshly for being asleep which is where Freddy thrives.
---
Blocks just make it so that when you sleep someone you have to wait less time to hit them, which often goes hand in hand with other people waking up faster due to less penalties, and often you seem to be playing "basic mouse 1 killer with a delay" which is the trap newer players fall into and then complain that he's shit cos they get rushed while 3 people are regularly awake.
---
I always find that hilarious lol 
---
*Hooks survivor*
---
*Survivor immediately uses deliverence/Kobes*
---
"Oh  well ok then" *smack* 
---
Like what do they expect??? 
---
F in the chat
---
This is totally baseless speculation on my part but here goes.
---
Well, in a lorestream a while back, the devs talked about the Void: a dumping ground for 'broken' Survivors who could no longer feed the Entity. They also talked about how the Entity might have made mistakes as it designed it's system of trials and Killers, and that those Killers might have been tossed into the Void as waste.
---
What if the next Killer, the oldest Killer by far, is legitimately the Entity's FIRST Killer?
---
It was discarded as a mistake into the Void long ago, in favor of Trapper and etc. However, it survived the Void, warped, changed, and hallowed out by long years in absolute emptiness, but still more or less alive. The Entity has taken an interest in it's durability and is deciding that it might be worth using again; so the Sky Spider restores the first Killer to the trials: a broken, shadowy, ghost-like Killer that is fueled by the life-draining power of the Void.
---
The new Survivor could be of a similar origin. One of the Entity's first playthings, long ago discarded as worthless but recently given a second chance, the Entity intrigued by the endurance of the long time they spent in the Void.
---
**TL;DR:** We called it months back: [this](https://youtu.be/D4-E4R0oHBY?t=2270) is the new Killer. /s
---
Woah, this is the era of technology, don't you know that adding a semi-transparent white layer IS drawing?
---
“They do it because it’s easier to get kills that way”
---
Absolutely, but if games were longer don’t you think they wouldn’t be so pressured to get the kill? 
---
 Very true.   I'm almost exclusively solo survivor (I don't much like the pressure of playing to teammates expectations.  Anxiety, probably) and it's almost always the latter.   I'm no God at survivor by any means but jeez.  I feel in control as killer.
---
T3 still walks and vaults faster than a normal killer
---
People will always need someone else to blame because otherwise it would be their own fault

I would absolutely love a power ranger DBD crossover tbh. 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Amen.
---
Honestly at this point I take the game for what it’s worth and just understand that all humans have the chance to be an asshole. Kinda like real life, but instead I don’t get in trouble for straight up stabbing people who piss me off. 
---
Oh it's prestige! I know how that system works. Ty.
---
Legion one doesn't seem funny because it's what you should do anyways 
---
Oink 
---
I didn't write a long winded spiel in regards to how slugging or leaving the person is not even that much of a counter since my post was getting super long in the first place. Long and short of it, Slugging is not a counter and juggling is a exploit that was left in the game because the devs realized that without it D strike would have nothing even vaguely trying to stop it. 
---
Now in regards to slugging, downing and or hooking a survivor achieves a similar state being the person now must rely on another person to help them (perks not withstanding), but here is the thing. 
---
Hooking a survivor throws them on a hook, instantly lowers their health state (So that another hook will put them straight into a struggle state) and locks them in place to a specific location. 
---
Slugging a person, puts them on the ground, they can still move, they can recover decreasing the time it takes for a person to get them up, and most importantly, they **will not be placed in the second hook state** on their next hook, **UNLESS they have been on the ground for a Total of 2 minutes**, AS LONG as it takes for a survivor to die on a hook from full health. This means that slugging a person in any way that will make a difference to their sacrifice amount, will literally take as long as it normally takes for a survivor to fully die on a hook, and if at any point they are healed from dying before that 120 seconds elapses, then you have nothing to show for the chase outside of a initial hit. This is of course not factoring the fact that a survivor can crawl to someone near or on a generator, and the fact as a killer you can easily lose track of the downed person if you leave them. Giving you no indication of where they got healed. 
---
With all of this factored in slugging a person is generally awful for the killer and in the grand schemes of things, hardly puts a dent in the progress of survivors, so you now have someone still on their first hook, still with dstrike, and potentially now getting healed in a location you have no reference to and that is your 'reward' for winning the chase, a chase that can easily cost you significant progress towards a generator. So while it applies some form of pressure, the actual reward to effort ratio is rather bad for the killer considering as mentioned, a downed person can move towards a objective.
---
Use NOED on Nurse and Billy is a thing, a constant thing now and it is a crutch, but the purpose (late game pressure is good), i feel like this whole 'apply pressure' thing is starting to just turn the equivalent of 'git gud' for people. 
---
Its not simple to apply pressure, and many factors can negatively effect it,especially if you are playing a lower tier killer. Fact of the matter is that Generators do get done to quickly, and most killers don't have the power to rush across maps, meaning that even short chases to hooks, can cause a generator to easily be close to completion. Ruin, BBQ, Nurses, all meta specifically because Killers literally don't have time to be on the prowl searching for survivors. So with that as a present force, having something that does mean that killers are still a threat to survivor post the exit gates opening, is a good idea, its just the exposed execution is too easy for bad killer to exploit and a crutch. 
---
I mean escape as in, escaping the killers grasp either to reset a chase, or to get that final hatch, or to get those exit gates when for all intensives purposes, they lost, they lost the chase, they lost the zero sum equation, and despite this they won because they had a opportunity the killer does not, they got a free escape, in their hands, there was no skill, no gameplay, it was just pressing spacebar right and they got rewarded for it, be that a escape from the trial, or forcing the killer to leave them as they make it to another loop.
---
Yes Dstrike is used by bad survivors, in the same way Noed is used by some bad killers but hey guess what, they shouldn't be balancing the game for bad players, they tried that once, and look at how Freddy turned out because of it. Good survivors using D strike is a free escape,rest,whatever and even as a great killer you options for what to do in that situation are far more limited then the options for a survivor. If we were going with literal equivalents, a Killer D strike would be succeeding a skill check and automatically grabbing a survivor nearby, no interaction, no skill involved, just a free Tick in the teams favor. Changing it to a Anti Tunnel Perk is probably the best thing they could do for it, because then the killers have a choice they have that chance to decide whether re-targeting the injured person is worth the chase reset, or whether targeting someone else is a better option, and the best part, having it not activate until post hook, means that if your get downed or outplayed, short of a flashlight save that first down is going to get you hooked, because in the Zero sum game, you lost.

---
You don’t get in trouble in real life if the cops never figure out it was you :D
---
I don't know about that last part. Most of the DS players I've encountered while playing killer are p3 Claudettes with a twitch.tv name and run in straight lines or loop very wide around corners. Some are good, but most... yeah, no.
---
So far so good. Haven’t found the leftovers yet. Just hope I can finish grilling them up before they get discovered. 
---
What if killer took obsession perk, but no one took ds? Ds wasn't a good one, but now its even worse, so im not gonna use it. 
---
If it's Legion I can kinda stomach the match.
---
If it's Frank's Mixtape I'm out. I prefer to be able to play my videogame.
---
Sounds about legion
---
this is too accurate
---
I knew it looked too much like the promo art. 
---
It’s the “rough sketches” all over again
---
And they wonder why people DC as soon as they see it's legion. 😂 Like it was probably my 2nd worse match ever against legion,  but this guy made it worth it lol.
---
I did a no kill challenge to rank 1.. some games were fun, some boring. I switched between all killers too. If you get Gatekeeper and Chaser emblems maxed out its a pip.  Basically bring Ruin and apply pressure fast . 
---
Haha i like the cannibal and huntress ones. The huntress would be confused as hell wondering where everyone is 
---
I like to location 2 to 3 totems that aren't by exit gates. If I find the other 2 I'll break them. Note: I only look for them as I'm travelling between gens or being chased. When the last gen is done, I quickly sweep the totem spots I've located. If noed is up I break it. Of course if someone gets hit, it determines whether I go open a gate or rush the totems. You don't need to break them all before the last gen, you just need to know where they are so that you can break it if needed.
---
[Exposed?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/auhnw5/saw_a_drawing_today_oof/?st=JSJZJDQN&amp;sh=08dbecbf) 
---
I have a theory on this: it's because the Light from the Flashlight is actually messing with the Entity's supernatural mojo.
---
IIRC this isn't stated anywhere in the lore, so I'll explain my reasoning.
---
Wraith and Nurse both use their powers to access the Spirit World. They both suffer from Lightburn while using their powers. They also both have a golden, shimmering effect and a black smoke effect when they enter and return from the Spirit World.
---
The Entity also has a golden, shimmering effect and a black smoke effect when it manifests to claim Sacrifices. That's because the Entity inhabits the Spirit World. It's brief manifestations all share the same visual effects as Nurse and Wraith, when they disappear/reappear.
---
The Entity also monitors and infuses the Killer's with supernatural mojo. That's how Amanda can carry people and why the Red Stain exists. The Entity is sitting inside Killer's minds, watching things through their eyes, during the trials to make sure they perform well. Still following me?
---
When a Survivor shines a flashlight at the Wraith while he's cloaked or at a Nurse while she charges her blink, they suffer from Lightburn. The light messes with the supernatural nature of the Spirit World and causes both of them immense pain and forces them back into the natural realm.
---
When a Survivor shines a flashlight into a Killer's eyes it disrupts the supernatural connection Killer's have with the Entity and basically scrambling the Killer's brains temporarily as *the Entity suffers from Lightburn*. This doesn't necessarily hurt either the Killer or the Entity, but it messes with the magic driving the Killer and temporarily makes their life a lot harder until the Entity can recover.
---
Imagine there are two survivors left.
---
You are both on hook.
---
Now one if them dies. 
---
Then you are the last survivor in the match and you can still struggle until your timer runs out.
---
A Dwight who wasn't in a locker? That *is* rare.
---
If the killer is running an obsession perk and no one has DS, then it’s just a normal game? 
---
Also DS has been, arguably, the strongest survivor perk because it had no natural downsides. Compared to OoO and Sole Survivor, those had much more serious drawbacks. DS didn’t. To say it wasn’t good is to say you youreself aren’t good with it. Players who were good at running tiles and looping had a simple second chance after eating up so much time already. Even non-obsession DS was still great because if you could manage going down in a dead zone or getting body blockers, you got your own DS too. 
---
This change makes it much more synergistic with other perks, has a clear strength for something Survivor players hate (tunneling) and even has the added benefit of not showing who’s running it until the killer picks them up. If anything this is the ultimate fuck off for tunneling killer’s cause they not only have to use their time to chase and down you after getting unhooked, but since it happens during pick up, not on shoulder, you can be getting face camped during your unhook and get downed right there and still be able to escape. 
---
Hmmm......
---
I’m already trying to get Unbreakable cause I know I’m gonna get slugged out. 
---
Pretty bad joke 
---
Yeah, that’s a copy. 
---
Idk how players still uses that trash perk
---
This is from the promo image. Someone did a side by side. No way to know for sure but it points to this just being a PS edit. 
---
Love it! Both of you look absolutely gorgeous &lt;3

I found this post and made it my discord profile pic on the spot

Really helps that my name is "just the tip"

Why don’t you play killer
---
Ooo nice
---
Killer is hard to choose. I like playing as Spirit + her depressing backstory + her design, with the way she constantly cycles through emotions and her hair defying gravity.
---
I like Legion the most for fan content. I love the drawings people do, the stories, the memes, playlists people make up for their mixtapes.
---
Pig is my second favorite to play and fun to play against. I love the crouching too much.
---
Survivor is easy to choose. I love Jake, especially with a cowboy hat. I like his backstory, how he rejected expectations and a lavish life to go survive in the woods. He's tough but seems sweet. I love the sabo Jake thing (even though sabotaging hooks isn't what it used to be).
---
1v1 games just shouldn't happen; the game should just go back to the lobby.
---
Like, 3v1s and 2v1s are bad, but in a 1v1 there's literally no point. 
---
There's no Hatch until the Gates are powered, only 4 gens for the Killer to patrol, and it's practically impossible for the Killer to break 10,000 bps unless they farm for quite a while.
---
I literally just played a survivor game and got killed by facecamping leatherface :( lost my purple medkit and didn’t even get to use it
---
It bugs me that other drawings of this guy are crap and only this one is good

Were you being a dick?

Anything you really do to an SWF is considered toxic

Killer or survivor main?
---
Play killer u wimp 
---
I do! I love playing as the spirit.  I just want to play survivor right now 
---
How do u survive without dead hard?
---
I do often! I just want to play survivor. 
---
Just had a game where we started with 3 survivors.  Killer hooks first person then hard patrols the hook and tunnels the person.
---
Clown better
---
Make a list of each perk and cross out each one you use until the list is finished or you stop playing.
---
This makes for interesting builds when you start running low on perks.
---
Is it the console's power or poor optimization?
---
What map?
---
Wig!
---
I didn't see a pebble. Am I missing something? The hex was destroyed but that's all I noticed in this clip.
---
In the French version, there are mistakes, too!
---
Chainsaw moves at 87.5% movement speed when charging up, then you let it go 115% speed for a short time period. Besides that the Charge time is longer then the other chainsaw killer billy. so if your not taking charge time addons hitting them with the Chainsaw is going to get more much more difficult. and hes 110 movement speed, and his chili addons don't do anything, your wrong.
---
nni🅱️al
---
That Dwight did 2 gens after everyone else died?
---
He must have been so happy he had Left Behind that match.
---
Oof. Awkward AF. 
---
It's not a sacrifice if it's almost guaranteed to net you a kill or two. It's just using different perks for different situations, which is what killers should be doing anyway. 
---
Knock them down grab their legs lift them up and slam them against the ground as hard as possible.
---
It pays respect to the sleeping bag kill, but doesn't take forever.
---
No one cares.
---
I just started watching hot fuzz today
---
Dude,  the legion stayed on the hatch just like that while Dwight did those gens. He didn't move. He didn't know Dwight was looking at him right here lol. He wouldn't hit him or anything,  he was just full on hatch blocking. Which I don't really know why,  but whatevs lol. I thought he was going to surprise attack with noed,  but nothing. Just stood perched on the hatch. 😂 
---
Literally a fair move that the devs endorse with we're gonna live forever. That Nurse is a dick.
---
I hope you know that huntress is free too.
---
We were all trash when we first started playing, some people just never progress beyond that state of garbage, unfortunately lol
---
This should be quite obvious, but sometimes you don't want to cloak immedietly after hooking someone.
---
Not gonna lie, I laughed
---
rEsPeCt tHe fOuR pErCeNt
---
And the 2 degree angle difference changed the buttons, pant stripes, face and keys? This one's obviously traced to an extent for reference, but your little crop photo literally isn't this photo lol. 
---
Its the entity, the entity is puppeting the killers souls and what are eyes commonly referred as the gateway to? 
---
The entity is darkness, thats why torches and generators are progress against it, all futile in the end for sure but the entity works from the shadows and is chase by the light, the problem is like Kingdom Hearts said, the closer to the nlight you get the bigfer your shadow becomes.
---
Did you mean to link to an album or something or is this intended to be a 12 post installment?
---
Killer waiting at the exit gate with N.O.E.D and he kills you
---
Spirit has been suggested a lot here and I'm totally behind that.    
---
The other good option would be Hag who is in my opinion at least as good and fun.
---
It is almost like there is a way to stop it from activating all together.
---
Poor billy probably uninstalled the game 
---
when i get camped I always think about how much progress my team's gonna make and that makes my average game better
---
You'd be proud to know it's a tracing 
---
A very large map is seperated into 3 sections both killers are put into a section with 4 survivors the survivors have to complete 3 generators in their own section to access the other, this will also allow the killer to team up with the other killer. After completing six generators between the two sections the 3rd section is opened and the survivors have to complete a total of remaining survivors/2 gens to power the 3 exit gates. Every section will have 5 gens making 15 gens total with 5 being unneeded. 
---
If the same hex perk is used twice it will essentially gain another life allowing it to respawn after breaking.
---
2 basements
---
Completly new map, probably an airport for sheer size/terminals acting as gates.
---
2 hatches spawn in the original 2 sections once their are only 2 survivors remaining, a hatch closes 10 seconds after being used by another survivor.
---
Killer can enter the other's section after killing all of their survivors. 
---
TL;DR I made a very unbalanced game mode.
---
They should make them count towards piping (dull totems) and make adjustments to the piping system for survivors 
---
I apologize on the behalf of The Spooky Gang.
---
I respect your opinion, but UE I will never go without. There’s no special reason whenever I have those two in the same build. I often try to change out SB, but I’m too dependent on the speed after getting unhooked. Since I play solo those situations have saved me from getting tunneled so many times. I also like how you can really dedicate to gens when you hear the heartbeat. I understand you think we’re all useless players since you have actually observed this, I haven’t. But I usually double pip in my games, so I don’t see a reason to change right now. You can suggest me a great build though, I’m always willing to learn.
---
No

You two look really cool! :) your nurse mask turned out pretty terrifying actually 😯
---
A guide on how to counter BT:
---
1. Leave the hook.
---
2. Go for the person unhooking.
---
You're welcome.
---
My point was that the game seems more catered to killers because they have to do 4× as much as the survivors do.
---
Fair
---
A mummy would never fit the style of DBD, it would be comical at best. 
---
Here’s another good tip,
---
On how to be a creative wiz-kid!
---
Go and collect some leaves and sticks,
---
And arrange them into your favorite color!
---
“Clown!”
---
“Wraith!”
---
“Billy!”
---
**Billy is not a creative killer!**
---
It's a trace of the offical art, with very minor adjustments(e.g. the end of the pants). It becomes obvious if you check OP's post history and any of his other drawings to this.
---
Because getting together a costume is more effort than sliding the transparency filter in photoshop apps
---
I really wish the devs would give you an option to just permanently turn off the post-game chat. I know you can turn it off, but only once a match completes and you have to do it every single time you load up the game. Then you'd only have to deal with the rage invites.
---
I know I would never miss the post-game chat. 
---
&gt;Buying a mask and a jacket online and opening a box after sitting on your ass is "more effort."
---
As a survivor main, I feel bad for the poor birb who just wants to voice their opinions.
---
LOL
---
Balanced Landing + Dead Hard &gt; Sprint Burst &gt; Lith
---
The fact that you can consistently hit hex skill checks doesn't automatically make you a good survivor either tho
---
Yeah seriously. Do they expect people to be happy and compliment them post game? Just own up to it.
---
Dont remind me of that :/
---
Oof, pink Susies love to hard camp.
---
Hey, good job on using lore info to come up with something, the amount of people saying it's a mummy makes my stomach turn. 
---
"He stabbed him so what, he died of blood loss so that isnt murder" 
---
&gt; Use NOED on Nurse and Billy is a thing
---
It's not a thing; these are the two killers you definetly don't need them on cause you can just 4k 5 gen no problem if you play right
---
You not giving slugging credit makes me feel like you don't play much killer, or haven't been around long enough. Slugging definetly applies pressure- you should try it out and see for yourself at some point.
---
&gt;i feel like this whole 'apply pressure' thing is starting to just turn the equivalent of 'git gud' for people.
---
It IS. I used to think killer had lots of problems, but I watched streamers, learned how to run common tiles correctly, gather game sense and where survivors will be, STILL fuck up and get mindgamed all the time, and still (not counting hatch escapes) 4k like 9/10 of my games.
---
In my head, even against like 3 "seal team 6" survivors who play hyper efficiently, on non-haddonfield maps and playing as like a B or higher tier killer, killer has easy enough of a time. If everyone plays right, interesting chases/ choices are made, everyone leaves the round with minimum 20k+ bp.
---
That's how games feel *currently*. Watch killer mains on twitch and how "annoying" DS is to them- it simply isn't.
---
&gt;Yes Dstrike is used by bad survivors
---
DS has literally ZERO power in the hands of a bad survivor. Even if the killer is stunned 7 seconds and they land it every time, bad survivors having DS (like doesn't know how to use tiles/ has shitty exhaustion perks) is *nothing*. They're great agency for good survivors vs bad killers, but bad v bad = DS sucks, good v good = DS sucks.
---
I seriously just think you need more time in the game before you start talking about this stuff. The way you talk about slugging just gives it away. I'm not doubting your ability to theory craft- I'm just saying you're absolutely misguided because you don't seem to have a grasp on what *actually* happens in games.
---
I thought that was the whole point? 
---
Plenty of artists trace, most commonly comic artists sometimes only changing the colors of the shirts. 
---
Hag tier C hahahahhaha obviously you dont know what you are talking about with her
---
This sub is 99% stolen and repurposed memes/comics and so on featuring characters nobody here owns.  Most posts here are people taking a web-comic and just switching the subject with poorly made DbD edits while keeping the same joke to make themselves look funny.  There's not even any wit to it.  They keep the same joke from the comic and just make it about DbD.  It's like quoting a funny film to make yourself look funny.  That stuff is a million times worse.  
---
That other guy may have traced the images but his colouring work is not bad at all.  He's just practicing his drawing/colouring and made something he's proud of and now everyone is tearing him apart for it.
---
Name a good artist that traces other people' drawings
---
🅱️U🅱️🅱️🅰️
---
A guy disconnected as soon as the match started
---
Was told to off myself because i played as legion (was playing nurse???)
---
I couldn't care less about the 3 randoms on my "team". I play for my entertainment and BP. Considering how many times I've been farmed and sandbagged everyone is also out for themselves. So you'll have to excuse me for not giving a shit if I DC to avoid wasting my time. 
---
Oh shit, this is getting brutal. BRB I'll go get some popcorn.
---
Ur wrong lmfao, if you look at right(clowns left arm) on the original drawing, you ll notice the pen, you re dumb trying to get attention. Calm your tits
---
And if you made that change how does a killer counter it? 
---
Right now, Noed counters hope at the end of a game if the totem survives. But with that change, hope might guarantee an escape from a killer every generator
---
Idk, I have pretty good luck on PC!
---
Aw damm look at that, i hate people like them cluttering up *MY* reddit, they should just be banned right now and exiled to the void
---
But if Mad Grit helped you in that game, it's not a sacrifice. It sounds like you rely on the same four perks, which is bad practise. If I see 4 survs running flashlights or toolboxes, I bring in Franklin's, Discordance and Mad Grit because I know they'll swarm a downed survivor or go ultra generator. It isn't a sacrifice, it's changing up your style to regain advantage. Same as you'd switch out Spirit Fury if you decided to play as Nurse. Being over reliant on the same perks each game is why some killers struggle against an SWF group instead of using perks designed to counter them. 
---
Same but sometimes it gets more laggier than console. 
---
The main reason I don't particularly want to play spirit...
---
One of my favorite builds is Ruin, Huntress Lullaby, and Haunted Grounds. Usually slows the game quite a bit and almost a guaranteed HG pop.
---
Maam pull the plug
---
Haha yep sometimes it's extremely frustrating but it's a great feeling when you 4k under bad circumstances. 
---
This aged well. 
---
You're doin the entity's work here, sir
---
too many people saying it's fake or something like that, kinda happy for the realism I got. Idk I'll make a vídeo to prove it
---
Great roast
---
HAHAHHAAHA
---
I main killer but I'm pretty sure thats either selective evidence or the simple fact that as a survivor you get one opponent and as killer you get 4. Survivors also got more room to be toxic than killers (in-game) if you do toxic shit as killer like camping it will end badly...
---
You traced it. I proved it. Now you are digging yourself a hole
---
Please do :)
---
Its unbelievable how toxic people get. Thats crazy you ended up getting banned, unfair. 
---
It's nutty to me how delusional these facecampers are.  Completely out of touch with reality.  
---
it's not though is it?
---
I didn' know what to do so I filmed all my DbD killers together, still processing but go ser it later
---
*Runs into my sight and starts T-bagging being nearby pallet as soon as the game starts*
---
*Get downed*
---
*Decisive Strike*
---
*Fails to get away and Immediately downed again*
---
*DC*
---
The amount of times this has happened to me is so high I'm half expecting every Claudette with DC to do it. 
---
there are a lot of options that do almost the same thing
---
If you need a free out of jail card try out deliverance, you have to actually do something helpfull to to your team to help yourself out, yes im also sad about the nerf but i can't say it's unfair, you can just hit a fat stab and get out, and that's michael's job
---
The pictures of course.  NOED because of all the skulls
---
No thanks. 
---
oi mate way too many of you just don't believe it's a drawing or whatever, go see the video I Just posted
---
just did, you all can see it now. It include the huntress too
---
Nice drawings :) dont let anyone make you feel bad about your talent. 
---
My point is that you should quit pretending that you drew those ALL by yourself
---
send the video I am curious
---
Time and a bit of effort. 
---
Just sent It see the podt history
---
This goes for every map. All spawns of the first hex perk are static to one area or one side of the map wall.
---
Btw can you make a video drawing nurse for example?
---
You did not answer tho. Is it not traced?
---
Honestly this means nothing. The fact that the stock art for the killers lines up perfectly and looks just like traced/copied art is a fact. People arent going to ignore that. 
---
If you genuinely did these yourself, then well done. Thats a great amount of talent you have and I hope you keep on honing your skills; but getting overly defensive when people call out fair observations doesnt help you out. It doesnt matter if you’re 15 or at school, anyone can use photoshop.  
---
Have a nice day and keep drawing! Be proud of your talent. 
---
Those mindgames probably won't really work, especially with the extremely obvious Jigsaw boxes. I've spawned in, and I didn't even have to have the camera circle around, the Jigsaw box was just sitting there. Gee, I wonder who the killer is, guys....
---
We know the Clown, that's Freddy on the killer select screen, and [Huntress](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/GY6o1)
---
really good, I've seen people that are 16 draw this well but 15 damn you've been drawing since u were like 4 yo
---
Are you sure it's "high end"? My PC doesn't even pass recommended settings and I get a constant 120fps on Medium (Turned off FLS cap before you say it's impossible to get past 60).
---
Definetly not, and If my internet collabs, I'll send the pictures I took since the start
---
Don't get salty by players like him. They know they lost, they just want to rub salt into your face. Just ignore them in after game chat 
---
It's griefing. 
---
I like how the lighting makes Susie look she is wearing thai dye clothes like some 90's hippie
---
There is no competition for DBD lol. I played a ton of Last Year but it is 100% dead, same goes for F13th. I don't play WoW anymore either but I will occasionally check up on the game.
---
awesome!
---
See, he put effort in it so let him post them. 
---
_Laughs in Freddy_
---
The game is done, but barely. It needs an overhaul, not just graphics-wise, but it runs like absolute shit. I can play Monster Hunter World on PC, on High and it only stutters against the most particle heavy monsters in certain areas, but if I play Doctor or look at a burning barrel my PC absolutely shits itself. 
---
and lets go thru your two points. Making their game available to the switch audience should take a back seat to pleasing the customers who have already bought the game. And pulling manpower or not, I *know* the devs are capable of fixing bugs, but they would rather make greedy business decisions. look at the prestige glitch that got fixed ASAP and people got banned for. Man, if only they tried that hard on the infinite loading screen, am I right?
---
You can keep licking BHVR's boots all you want, but this shit is unforgivable. 
---
Just ignore him. Its your fault you got banned. Don't let them trigger you, they just want to get you salty. 
---
Not to mention that Mad Grit only works on missed hits, not actual hits.
---
I don't like it, but until the devs decide to actually admit they messed up, it's pretty much the only thing you can do to get the message across.
---
Not automatically, but maybe if your hold down the power button during the hook animation. 
---
Automatic wouldn’t work with other survivors near by the would just rush the hook. 
---
There are 5 totems on every map so if you destroyed all of them and the perk is still up then it's probably a bug.
---
just so you all understand, I'll post some pictures from when I was drawing, so all the shit stops coming. (If my internet helps that is)
---
Any kind of game can bring you back the fun we once had, doesnt have to be an assymetrical one. Although if I should recommend one it would be Identity V. Kind of a chinese ripoff but it has very interesting concepts
---
New chapter where time shenanigans cause him to be the killer as well as younger him being the survivor.
---
Traced: When you put the image you intend to draw below the blank page and draw the lines 
---
If he was like "practicing shading on dbd killers" i would have liked that. But he claims that he made these all by himself and does not provide any evidence to backup his claims
---
ok mate I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Just posted a picture from since I began this, go and try to "prove" It there.
---
It's first on mine, I thought it would take longer to find the source image.
---
Just draw anything, doesn't have to go in depth with color or shading. Take your time
---
idk man, Im Just sad to see that during all the time Im at school, people all over the internet will be shitting over me bc my drawings are "too real"
---
should I need to prove things, bc it's "too real" for your liking?
---
the passive agressiveness here os almost buzzfeed level
---
1 - thats a QOL change, doubt tier 1 and 2 were ever used
---
2 - that was heavily abused by swf to prevent perks such as bloodwarden to be used. 
---
Agreed. Didn't even think it was a sketch.
---
So youre trying to tell me those things didnt help NOED ok :thinking:-emoji
---
Wait what? There is a new dlc coming out? When? 
---
Are you stupid? I made a concrete proof that you traced the thing. And you claim you didn't. I ask you to prove it, you make a victim out of yourself with all that "im late, im a kid etc". 
---
DEAD BY MIAMI
---
next month I think, might see it in the PTB not 100% sure tho. But having a PTB only for DS seems kinda silly.
---
Okay, aggressive then. You got caught, everything you've posted we've found the source image of and photos of a WIP don't mean shit.
---
While I don't agree with bullying the little fedora wearing Darn-boy, I always thought that the DbD community was kinda hypocritical with Legion. Like: "Waaah they are so bad and annoying" bit creating thousands of edgy fanart for them.
---
Good drawing btw
---
\&gt;"I don't even know what tracing means, but I SWEAR I DIDN'T DO IT!"  
---
Top kek
---
"As if rank matters" yeah, let those rank 20s go against red ranks! that'll show them that rank means nothing!
---
A had a game with a spirit who tried to show us how, us survivors struggeled and she did it easilly. I was the only one who wasen't able to do it :( I suck :(
---
People pointing out the truth got downvotes. 
---
Oh, sorry M'Lord. I will only use Left behind, No Mither, No One Left Behind and Up The Ante. 
---
Why would anyone care what your face looks like? 
---
I hope it's a Pirate! and he has a shark ghost that sniffs out bloody survivors! and instead of hooks you put them on planks where they must jump into a small pool of baby sharks!
---
Classic "I'm a survivor main... BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT"
---
Happened to me too with Legion, even after I bought some perks in the bloodweb. I uninstalled the DLC and put it back on again. Everything was there.
---
That was about 2 months ago though, maybe they have an easier solution for that now. But that worked for me.
---
mate I made that in the drawing course. It was the pictures they gave me, I just made It to paper. And of course, It was on Google images. could any artist do something without a reference? Yes. But I didnt want to make something random. I wanted to draw the clown. And I did it. but now there's all this shit. I'm done
---
Now THIS is shitposting
---
No u!
---
You’re acting like this is some FBI shit, calm down already it’s pathetic reading all of this shit as a grown up.
---
Well, you don't have to care at all.
---
No one is forcing anyone to like something I do. 
---
Yeah, getting yourself banned for DC'ing too much is sure gonna show those devs.
---
I was getting a bit frustrated while trying to get the blood on your face trophy (kill 4 survivors in 1 game)
---
My strats were okay, but in 5 out of my 8 games somebody disconnected. 2 of the others were hatch escapes and the other was a swf that stomped me (which is fine, it's the disconnects that I was annoyed with).
---
So anyway I start the 8th game (also a disconnect during loading screen and was annoyed about wasting my 8th and final mori I had stored up) when suddenly I get a message from a survivor saying "hope you have a great game"
---
Made me all warm and fuzzy inside. I sacrificed one of their teammates and then let the other two go. She then let me mori her at the exit gate 
---
"they had us in the first half not gonna lie"
---
Damn now that's a clown 
---
Can’t wait for that DS rework 😎😜👌👌
---
Individual survivors? Nah. A group of survivors on discord together? Yes.
---
You dont have to prove anything. Just be proud of what you have accomplished, and dont pay attention to jealous people. You are a talented artist. Keep drawing! (I wish to see more of your art in this subreddit) 
---
The.........................................wasp.
---
It was probably bought from the same sound effects pack or something 
---
I feel like every killer main should just start playing Legion, so every toxic cunt who quits at Legion will end up with a high enough DC percentage to get themselves banned.  
---
Then, us not toxic cunts can just enjoy ourselves, survivors and killers alike.
---
Damn Daddy you got my attention now UwU
---
That reload speed as huntress is p goddamn nice. 
---
Agreed. Always assume they’re so salty that they’re trying to get you to trash talk them so they can report you to Sony. Just report and block them.
---
I think your art is legit and really good 🤷‍♂️ everyone else is just jumping on the hate train. Don’t let the internet get to you
---
I agree it needs a buff but not entire map hook aura blockage. Imagine rank 20s,imagine maps like lerys, the game and swamp maps. Perhaps they should increase the aura blockage range but not the entire map 
---
Whenever I get camped for no reason (I never teabag,use DS or flashlights) I just automatically assume theyre bad at playing killer. Simple as that,and then I feel kind of bad for how boring their games must be
---
I am! Sorry you have to deal with long queue times. I play survivor too and queue times, especially with swf is a nightmare 
---
How 'bout no. 
---
I've been matched to the wrong region for about 6 months now leading to me dodge 300-600 ping survivors for ~10 lobbies before i start getting correct region (no, i can't wait for them to leave the lobby because for some reason these guys are perfectly content with 300+ ping).
---
Apart from that i dodge a few SWFs i know just want to make killers' life miserable (sure, i could Nurse em down but i'd rather have fun than face their optimal 4 DS/instaheal squad) &amp; if i keep on getting matched with the same people, since it gets boring to vs them over and over (no doubt it'll get boring for them too).
---
Dis boi is getting exposed
---
And dont forget the Doctor! 
---
No, I am not defending it. 
---
I don't mind this technique as a practice, or if at least the OP mentions the original art/picture.
---
It's just surprising  for me seeing this post calling out this OP when there are tons of examples like this. 
---
And as you said, they get way more attention than original artworks, (happened to me).
---
A lot of "artists" out there only know how to rip off other artworks. And some even make money.
---
I dunno, I think all addons, except for Black Box, have a place in some builds and are at least B tier. Black Box should be less rare to be a occasional pick. Block addons are memes in the Freddy community for the reason that they are heavily overrated, not because they are inherently bad, you could have just used other addons instead, but except for 1 of the blocks, they are never really a Detriment, depending on how you play your transition phase. Red Paint Brush is a gimmick addon for the jumpscare build with Monitor and Abuse, but it is really potent at that as long as you don't play against a super organized swf, since it hits a lot of players unaware, but it is also a bit map reliant (less then jumpscare myers, though, having thick fog and being smaller is pretty good, as well as the better speed and lunge). The rest are more mood picks, with Class Photo being the best addon.
---
I started playing yesterday!  So, it kinda fits still in this smile sunday.
---
So, I was playing a survivor and we started the game with only 3 survivors (one dude DC'd in the loading screen). Which was fine, at least now I know that when we start with less than normal survivors, we have to get less generators... Yet, the other 2 survivors DC'd as soon as the game started.
---
So I was alone.
---
Since I was not in the mood to even try, I standed below a hook and waited for the killer, at least he could hook me and gain some bloodpoints since it wasn't his fault he couldn't play a proper game. So he hit twice, grabbed me and instead of hooking me, took me to a generator and smacked it. I understood he wanted me to do it.
---
So "we" did the 4 generators and then I was like "ok, now he deserves to kill me". Again, I ran to the hook and waited for him there. Then he grabbed me once again and took me to the exit lever. I did one, then he took me to the another one. So, FINALLY, he really deserved to get some points for hooking. I had points for the gens and the exits, so why not?...
---
Nope. He grabbed me and took me to the hatch. So I ran, again, to the nearest hook and spammed the crouch button to "tell" him to hook me. He moved in an A-D motion (as a "no") and grabbed me again to the hatch.
---
I crouched and rubbed myself in him, and left.
---
In the lobby, he said "GG &lt;3".
---
I smiled. For some reason, I was happy. It was fun. Not because I won, but because I know that, somewhere, there is a stranger that is actually a good and caring person. :)
---
oh my god..... is the wraith òwó-ing 
---
Technically he drew "The Clown" at the top left... Pepega
---
What is your process while drawing? Since these are clearly from ingame screen shots/concept art etc. Do you have the original image up next to you while you draw? 
---
Damnit.... you figured me out. 
---
Fam help me out here 
---
This perk shrine has knockout and I am a baby huntress so should I use it on here ? 
---
Perks I am running are ruin , deerstalker,iron grasp and whispers 
---
Honestly don’t let people online get to you. Especislly the people that frequent this sub. 🤦🏿‍♀️ If you like drawing and you say you drew it then just keep drawing, practicing and having fun!! I do recommend probably not coming back to this sub too often but that’s just self care. 😊👌🏿
---
Even The Legion don't want themselves.
---
The drawings are really cool though, nice illustrator skills.
---
And then you die too and you're like  TOGETHER AT LAST BRO 
---
i was never so excited to be chased like i am right now!
---
I had one the other day who was a rank 18, he just did not understand what I was doing and I guess thought I was trying to fuck with him.
---
I kept dropping him at gens as Wraith and he just kept running away.
---
Finally I thought I convinced him to just work on gens, but just as he was about to finish one he missed a skill check and I came out of my invisibility and he ran away as fast as he could. 
---
So we had a couple more minutes of me dropping him at the gen and him running off until I found the hatch and dropped him there. Afterwards he told me he thought that last gen had completed because he didn't realize the failed skill check affected progress
---
To troll
---
"camped from a distance"
---
I don't really see why tracing is an issue though? Its still a nice drawing at the end of the day.
---
It’s obviously satire?
---
If anything this looks more like seeing and drawing something rather than outright tracing, too many imperfection that you shouldn't be able to do if you actually traced it.
---
Screw you mate haaaaa
---
makes them feel happy i guess. i went to art school and some of my other classmates used to trace the shit outta everything. thankfully they didn’t pass, cos like, teachers ain’t stupid.
---
i feel it has to do with all the pressure and then accepting their either not good at art or they just literally cbf to learn. 
---
Just let me stalk you till i reach EW3, so that I can chase you forever. 
---
Join the Pebble People Posse! We are a very welcoming group of fun folks. :)
---
You are a legend 
---
doing god’s work
---
Not saying you traced and I will say your amazing at shading, but at least say you heavily relied on a reference for the poses and “skeleton”, each one is an exact pose/image from google or whatever as others pointed out. You have talent but at least acknowledge you didn’t draw up the poses since it looks really obvious that you put the paper on top of the reference and got the outline.
---
give it 5hrs and these will be locked just like mine were. but hopefully not
---
Nah, I’m not gonna sit in a game I’m not having fun in, all I’d do is just find the killer and kill myself on hook instead the same as most people will do
---
I hate laterface SO MUCH
---
Lmao why are you ashamed of tracing, everyone's gotta start somewhere, hot damn. Good job but no need to lie, no one minds if you trace until you pretend that you didn't, these are just people on the internet, their opinions of you won't change or matter if you tell them you trace.
---
Ah, the ol' crotch grab to taint stab combo.
---
Like honestly wondering the same, is he using a light box or just looking at the reference, the shading is at least great but at least admit you HEAVILY used a reference.
---
I also went to art school and went to a art and design university and when students copied things from the internet made me pissed! If you're not good, work harder! Dont try to get credit for something that u didnt create or credit for something that took 2 seconds to photoshop to create. 
---
Just sad people
---
&gt;"Someone posted something on the internet. Quick call them mad because it must be true."
---
It must suck being you and thinking everyone is mad all the time.
---
A decisive Pummeling!
---
film yourself drawing the clown again
---
Just got rank 1 with her last Night so i passed her to prestige 1 i love this killer so much
---
Well then
---
I just started leveling Bubba and this makes me sad :( Not all Bubbas are the same! We like our meat in the basement! &lt;3 
---
I have more respect for this than all those other ones
---
I rarely make spelling mistakes or grammatical mistakes either, but english is far from my native tounge and there a ton of terms i don't understand in english. That part doesn't prove much, so let's not jump to a conclusion that he's lying about that part.
---
Whatever you say, man, I just see it as BHVR being greedy fucks or completely inept.
---
Free hugs
---
#i didn’t know that... nice.
---
Some people just want to see the world burn
---
A video of you drawing would be nice
---
Personally I think a lot more will be using it. It has a skillcheck you can't miss now and theres no 35% limitation.
---
As someone already said, the person can crawl out. 60 seconds is enough if its close to the gate. Or they can be picked up and use DS and then run out.
---
They didn't have this option before aside crom the obsession.
---
General reposti
---
The Idea behind the guide was to create a 1 fits all build,playstyle and strategy which is why I didn't go over any other perks. 
---
I tried to be suggestive when I said if you wanted to achieve 3 or more kills with Freddy, but you're getting gen rushed you will need to take 1 survivor out of the equation. By all means no one has to tunnel if they don't care about achieving more than 3 kills, but for the current build and playstyle I was showcasing without item addons against a good team of survivors who are popping gens theres no way to achieve more than 3 kills unless you tunnel or use the 3 gen strat or both. This is just my experience with playing this build with Freddy.
---
I really do appreciate that you took the time out to write this comment because if more people feel the way you do Ill take down the guide and rework it or follow up with another video.
---
It's not some high-skill exercise sure, but talentless is harsh and I don't see an issue if they want to share it with people. Don't really think it requires this kind of public shaming at the least.
---
Choking is totally fine with me! But I am not sure about multiple deep stabs. Perhaps we should agree on some safeword, Daddy?
---
Yes, I have them on my phone, and the huntress I had it on the pc
---
I'm that I like to see if people reply
---
The buzzing sound on the exit doors when they’re about to open is the same sound the doors make when you open them in Der Riese. When they added the buzzing I thought “oh shit, I recognise that sound”

Your kinda like jacking off to your own posts and making it worse dude stop lol
---
Myers has come home.
---
I'd say thanks but like
---
it's not traced. I thought the clown was quite colorful and detailed. then I wanted to draw him. I got a promo img in my phone. and then, looking at It, I drew it. Thats it.
---
Pretty sure they did not mean that, i'll say what they might have meant to say.
---
You are just an insufferable man-child that is quick to throw a tantrum but will try to keep cool and throw around insults thinking-no- wishing they will negatively affect people. Your comments are aggressive and uncivil towards people that don't think like you and yet you clearly are trying to show you are above everyone. So yeah, you are bordering on being waste of space here.
---
But but but NOED
---
Thanks, man. They're all pissed bc decisive strike os getting nerfed
---
Tracing linework sure, but the colouring work on show in their drawing required skill at least. I'm someone who can draw (to an extent, I study architecture) and I just feel uncomfortable with OP creating 2 separate threads to shame this guy for tracing.
---
But yeah, they should just admit it. But making it a shameful thing doesn't help with reaching that.
---
Did he have dying light?
---
Get that stick out yer ass already, you had your moment calling out a possible trace with the Clown one, now you are a downright ass.
---
Nice. I’m not to far behind. Maybe I’ll get there one day.
---
He did draw it though! He just used modern technology, known as the "Printer" to do it! 
---
Yeah I admit that comment was harsh 
---
They want you to disconnect I guess because I can't see any other reason (except being an idiot what's also a good excuse)
---
Yesss.
---
Welp I'm going to sleep now, can't promise you won't be in my dreams, hooo boy 😳
---
It even says I escaped but I didn’t get my blood points or the tool box I found 😂
---
I've been in a 2 people, 3 gens since both the others dced and we still managed to escape. I have the video if anyone's interested
---
Of fucking course

People love to shit on F13, but feel free to get locked in copyright hell. I bet you'd love the amount of stuff you're not allowed to put into your game.
---
Nice 1 month repost
---
ok
---
I'll delete the post now
---
And we see that David gave in to the T I P. 
---
He suspect OwO
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
gonna delete it now sorry, just saw one on twitter
---
No one knows how to spell Michael Myers on this sub
---
Completing your objective ie winning or sacrificing is a win. Getting cheated out of all the kills because of rng isnt fair or balanced. You can sit there and act like it's totally fine but it's far from it
---
Traced /s
---
Ohhh so that's what it is! I encountered that once, this fucking dude just heely'd out the exit gate, I was so angry but thought this is one of the weird bugs
---
Basically told us it's fine that he plagiarized the art 
---
What an oof
---
Say it with me now:
---
&gt;If your icon is from an anime then your opinion doesn't count.
---
    btw no h8 on anime but that profile icon is just way too fitting
---
Nobody is calling it a conspiracy
---
It ticks me off to see people gen tapping (or doing one skill check and then sprint bursting off) at Rank 1.
---
Good killers 4k more than half of their games, often with only 1-2 gens done. You can see this evidenced on thousands of hours of recorded gameplay footage.
---
Most random survivors of any rank do not repair generators efficiently, often not at all. Barely last 30 seconds in chases. Even global escape rates have shown time and again that killers average more than 2 kills. You can watch streams of good killers 4k more than 80% of their games with relative ease, on a daily basis, hours upon hours.
---
I will never understand how players can complain about doing bad without even so much as considering that their own abilities are at fault to a large extent. Don't you feel shameful as gamers admitting to losing all the time and rather than trying to improve, saying you have no chance and the game-makers need to help you? If I can show you killers that hardly ever lose, that only rarely have anyone escape through the gates at all, yet killers here always complain about losing and being powerless, don't you realize that you are not good at the game, that you could be a lot better and not have these problems you complain about to nearly the same degree?
---
Voice communications are bullshit, they are basically cheating. But that's about everything I consider to be bullshit about survivor these days, playing killer at rank 1 myself as well. Balanced Landing can be ridiculous, on Haddonfield particularly. Instaheals are bs, but Moris are even more so, and there are a lot more things on the killer side that are bs (insta-down add-ons, Spirit having collision in phase walk, Prayer Beads, Nurse range and blink add-ons, Legion as a whole, new hit reg after window vaults, hook vacuum, spherical hatchet hitboxes, basement stair bodyblocking, latency advantage that leads to hits through pallet drops and vaults, …).
---
This is more a general response. I do agree that gens, in theory, can get done too fast. One thing I do think they could do is remove the headlights from gens, making them take more time to find. Anything else would cripple the global survivor experience only more, and make the game only more boring for killers that already are only seldomly really challenged.
---
yeah, obviously I had a reference. I didnt want to draw random. I wanted to draw bubba
---
[This guy](https://i.imgur.com/fqm68kj.jpg) didn't get the memo and DCed as Legion instead.
---
&gt;That other guy may have traced the images but his colouring work is not bad at all. He's just practicing his drawing/colouring and made something he's proud of and now everyone is tearing him apart for it. It's not as if he's trying to make money off of the character designs or something.
---
Yeah but he keeps claiming its not traced
---
Next level meta. Disconnect because you *think* the Killer is Legion.
---
New to editing? Real question btw, cuz there was a lot you could do playing with the music in this to match hard sounds in game
---
EA finally took over
---
tbh I can, Im making an iron man now, might as well make another clown
---
Hence the word "act"
---
&gt;How can you feel that SWF isn't fun but can't empathize that red moris and instadown aren't either.
---
The same way you can't empathize that my best stuff is now wasted because you decided to DC on first down. It's like saying "I'm not having fun, so you can't have fun either. Fuck you." and taking the ball and going home.
---
&gt;People just want to be able to choose their difficulty.
---
This isn't a single player game. You'll get matched against people of varying skill levels, whether boosted people in high ranks, or derankers in low ranks. You're not going to win every time and you're not supposed to. If you could "pick your difficulty", people would always go for the difficulty they could win every time and the people who don't abuse that system suffer for it and the game would either revert or fall apart.
---
&gt;so I'll express my dislike the only way I can - DC and go to another match. 
---
That's not expressing your dislike, that's being an asshole not just to the killer, but the other survivors. The game is ruined for both sides when you DC. The survivors have a much harder time and it becomes too easy for the Killer to secure all the kills to the point where it's boring.
---
Nobody is acting like its a conspiracy
---
inb4 too many words
---
But seriously good job though 👌
---
It makes me so Salty. Bonus points if you go on about how poorly I did with a weak killer against multi ds on a bad map. Then pat yourself on the back for your swf group spacebar win. 👌
---
They really ought to just make it so that if the killer is within a certain distance, hook progression completely stops.
---
Yea, I'm not saying DS = Skill or anything, but someone like horesto1984, who hides behind rocks with urban evasion, wouldn't have to the killers rancor because XX\_LolGitGudKid\_XX would want to take the aggro, even if he shouldn't.
---
I nave one question, where is/was the jake?
---
Proportions are just right. I'd love to see more of your work.
---
It's refreshing to see a cosplay other than Legion on here.
---
delicious
---
Finally, some good fucking comment
---
People that send you a salty message are just immature adults or kids. They dont know anybetter because its just a game. They are basically winning. 
---
There is actually an unwritten rule for artists. One of them is not copying other people's work. You're doing the exact same poses and not changing anything - only drawing worse than them. You're basically plagiarizing their art. It's tacky and I guarantee if you ever try to sell art and try to do something like what you've been doing you'll get blacklisted so fast your head will spin.
---
As soon as there is counterplay to legion I won't dc
---
Funnily, that's 3/4 of my Claudette, but I use WGLF instead of Sprint Burst.
---
This is one of the first posts in a while on reddit that make me absolutely lose my shit. Good job! 
---
That's kinda creepy
---
if it was 3 alive at least 4 gens need to be repaired for hatch to spawn 
---
Still better than Tyde's
---
Oh hey, another killer main crying on reddit cause he doesn’t get a 4K every match. 
---
Hey, this is pretty good.
---
It's just a generic ps4 avatar.
---
I would miss it some times.
---
There are good people that thanks you aftermatch on both sides. It is nice in my opinion. 
---
After seeing all those comments: don't feel bad about it, those people have no idea how the way of an artist works. No matter which art school you would go to, they would NEVER tell you to NOT use references. Nice drawing, keep it up!
---
The last one helped killers who are running noed to play the game like its meant to be played. Without survivors dying and informing everyone else about killer perks they shouldn't know about.
---
That is removing a scummy exploit, not buffing noed
---
Right, my bad! Just strengthens my point though
---
It's due march 11th I think but the teasers are very late for that date.
---
I think with the way the game is now and all the hate on legion maybe they have had to rework the new killer so they can bounce back.
---
Lerys and The Game are already terrible maps so I agree it would worsen them.
---
But honestly there are so many discrepancies and situations that can occur on those maps I don't think it will make them THAT much more unfun to play on.
---
Those maps need reworks anyway.
---
That is what i thought. 
---
If you don't do toxic or unfair things like camping or tunneling probably you won't get the toxic coments after the game. Obviously there are toxic people who doesn't care about anything and will say stupid things if they get killed or they don't scape, but it is a minority. 
---
I'm fairly new to the game myself and don't wanna face the legion tbh.
---
Clown embraces his beauty. Freddy does not.
---
I like to thank the people who play nice and I get fun while playing, even if I die.
---
I've played just over a year now and I don't like facing the legion just like I don't fancy playing against Freddy. But I won't DC ect.
---
The game has a lot of issues at the minute and many people have left and have said they won't come back. So it's all about making sure the new killer is 100% ready and not be rushed
---
No thanks 
---
How about no?
---
This is your first post ever. I thought this sub had rules against promoting. 
---
Obviously traced
---
that's better with meg face laughting imo
---
I’ve seen this stuff first handed in my friend circle. In that case the police was not interested in responding to just a username and chat logs. Also if I were harassed by someone with a following like ochido, who himself is pretty toxic and whose fanbase also tends to be rather toxic and feral sometimes (not everyone, but definitely has a few prime examples) I would not want any type of publicity on that. At all. Many victims of sexual harassment and similar stuff tend to prefer everyone, including themselves, to forget about their harassment.
---
Regardless of whether or not the artist traced the image (and really, does it matter? enjoy the art or don't, it's that easy), I find it very rude that you would take their art and repost it like this. This isn't your content to appropriate, alter, and subsequently make a joke out of.
---
Its crazy how good light weight is right now, maybe its just xbox or just me but scratch marks have been crummy for awhile it seems.
---
Great way to depip TBH. They lose a pip for AFKing but can claim I’m “just using insidious.”
---
Doesn't matter where you got the anime icon.
---
But why?
---
Unless you post a video yourself drawing on a blank paper (from start to finish) with no image underneath it, just a reference pic at the side, then only you can prove it.
---
Yes, you're able to shade and sketch. But you said you drew it at school but yet it's identical to the DBD art. The small detail innacuracy on his face/lines on his pants does not prove that you did not trace.
---
You did traditional art. You need to draw the skeleton figure first for anatomy, then line, erase, colour and then only shade. But this pic, you have spots where you coloured first, then random lines, yet look exactly like the DBD art. How? Because you already know what to draw - because you traced it from the official art! That is not reference!
---
It should not be a big deal, yes, but you kept denying it. Tracing should be for practice only.
---
Maybe you didn't know that it's a bad thing. I'm just worried... you're just 15 and I don't want you to one day use other artists's work and do plagiarism. And its ok to just admit and apologize. Just next time don't do it anymore ok? 
---
For meme
---
You're under the assumption it's from an anime. It's a still image.
---
Fair enough lol
---
totem goblin lmfao
---
Finally, a confirmation we waited for!
---
That’s a little too good.... is this also a trace? What is happening with this sub. 
---
It’s a blast. And insures you can protect your totems. Promise, it’s worth it.
---
On xbox spamming the unhook means camping or proxy camping, staying still means they have left the area. Doesn't matter either way because you'll still be hook rushed/farmed unfortunately.
---
Bruh that’s not a sketch 😂😂
---
A faithful reproduction of something is still art, and requires skill. Look at OP's shading, how they blend colors, how they weigh their lines out. They're seriously skilled, and I think that you a) accusing them of tracing, and b) judging them based on whether or not you think they traced, is **just an excuse to try to tear down someone who can create something that you are unable to create.**
---
I saw every saw. ⬅️ Lol
---
That's my shrine
---
I like using bubba and haven't done this...til now
---
“He’s good I don’t play this game he’s totally not me guys haha”
---
I actually got five people to get the game and try it, but only three people enjoyed it. I feel like one of them already hated it before trying it and didn’t play with an open mind tho
---
TrAcED
---
Ape brain&gt;
---
Agreed, some killers get toxic due survivors being toxic first and some survivors get toxic due killers being toxic. 
---
What I mean is that OP can't expect survs not to be toxic if first of all he camped. 
---
Take your DS and shove it.
---
Nah,we’re pissed cause you’re karma-whoring
---
No you didn't. And I know this is a shitpost.
---
:) true true :)
---
Weird how much your comment got downvoted. It's almost like some salty weirdos are trying to make it look like OP has no supporters. Well, they're wrong. :)
---
I use that Claud setup frequently and I go for saves 9 times out of 10. Altruism points op
---
You got balls not running dead hard,props to you 
---
He drew lines perfectly first try without correction no artist can do that
---
i dunno why but when i read this i pictured the latina house keeper from family guy throwing hatchets at survivors while saying No No No
---
I think our definition of complaining differs. I was deconstructing a social norm.   
---
Why is everyone so concerned with figuring out if someone is a "troll" or not? Is there some sort of prize? 
---
Had a match just like this with a Legion. Wonder if it’s the same guy.
---
However, BHVR has shown that they value their roadmap **more** than 100% killer balance on release. I expect a PTB tomorrow, the Legion debacle will not have any impact on this. 
---
It’s too early in the morning for this stuff 
---
Okay so, im not the best of artists so I often use other pieces of art as reference for my creations, and they often almost look exactly like the piece in question, even if this artist traces or anything it is still a good piece of work in my opinion
---
Why did this get 3 downvotes? He just have the guy a compliment
---
Wraith is a Freddy that doesn't have to wait 7 seconds and can sneak up on survivors and how does Freddy have slug power he can't stop pick ups for 7 seconds 
---
A) He doesn't owe you anything.
---
B) You can't say that the inaccuracy proves he didn't trace, but the parts that show accuracy prove he did. That's just bending the narrative to fit your accusation.
---
C) Not everyone draws the same way. I don't start with a "skeleton figure." Not everyone starts with a "skeleton figure," or even shapes, or lines. Just because many people do, doesn't mean that OP does.
---
D) "Tracing should be for practice only." What gives you the right to claim that? Look at the way movies and games use CGI--by having actors in body suits covered in little dots provide motion. Look at how many artists start by taking photographs, and then paint from the photographs. He took a 3D, digital image and faithfully recreated it with high accuracy in a totally different medium.
---
I feel you, I main survivor and dip into killer every now and then, it grinds my gears when I see people who were rank 1 survivors purposely de ranking to 18/20 and then spam “GG EZ EZ EZZZZZZ” 
---
More so when only one survivor escapes. Explain to me how that is an easy win?
---
Do you think so soon? We haven't even had any teasers yet. They always reveal a teaser at least 7-10 Days before a killer. 
---
Nah, you're pissed because you can't do what he can do and you're taking any opportunity to bring him down because of it.
---
Never too early to stab someone. 
---
I can do that. :) So I believe that he can, too.
---
Thank you!
---
If you think this A tier killer needs perks then you'll always need a crutch.
---
I shouldn’t laugh, but damnit this made me laugh. 
---
The background remembers me of the TARDIS. Really nice art.
---
\*awkward Trapper smile\*
---
That would be the dumbest thing ever. If the killer got nurse they would win every single time. If they didn't, the survivors would win every single time. 
---
Weird flex, but ok
---
Bringing the 7 second argument makes me think that you are one of those guys that run double blocks, keeps 3 people awake and complains about how bad he is without bothering on learning how to play him
---
Desync aka lag lol. Again not going to be fixed by servers. Reduce the liklihood maybe
---
Ok. You have not read any of my proofs judging by your cheap accusations. Goodbye
---
Until we see a timelapse of him drawing something and his username on the drawing,then I tend in favor that he’s not as good as he claims to be
---
Yeah that’s annoying af
---
I like to back up and create space with the hatch. It's like a game of jukes. If given enough room they eventually will try it. Of course sometimes u have to go ridiculously far back where u dont stand a chance but most of the time it's pretty fun option. 
---
What is mad monster? 
---
Any thing is possible in your dreams! :)
---
Yeah but he said it wasnt tracing in other posts
---
I would be fine if he didnt try to lie and get away with it
---
HiT bOxEs aRE a CoNneCTIon I$$uE
---
Does that mean no proof video? 
---
OwO
---
Legion: Or maybe he doesn't want anyone to see his face.
---
Clown: Because, he's fuck ugly
---
it's a horror convention. 
---
Okay, thanks for the explanation
---
I'll give you "going back to gens after killers kick them", because I see so many people not doing that and it's just embarrassing. Still, it's not something that requires skill. 
---
that literally means nothing tho? 
---
It's not only on PS4.
---
Hey now, it’s unreasonable to expect people to put any real effort into their costume. Why dress up as the trapper when you can just make a mask out of paper and crayons for cheap internet points? 
---
Had this happen yesterday on XB1 against a camping wraith who blamed me for killing my team because I attempted saves. Scumbag campers.
---
You demanded at several points that he post drawing videos. You've never harassed him? You've been doing nothing but harassing him! You posted his art, making fun of it and accusing him of tracing! And when I was talking about "reposts," I was actually talking about your memes (that you assembled from screenshots, drawings you didn't do, etc.). You're not creating anything original, and yet you're bagging this poor guy for possibly tracing something.
---
Look at [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/arv1rv/he_would_definitely_go_inside/), for instance... We know that you didn't do the DBD art, obviously. You probably didn't even take the screenshots. But did you draw that Meg? Did you even give credit to the person who drew that Meg, or try to locate the artist, or ask permission?
---
Nice! Where did you buy it from?
---
THE BEE OR RIOT!!!!
---
I didn't notice. Thank you for pointing it out.
---
You’re a cunt, that’s all. Fuck off
---
Basically entire meme culture is shit in your opinion. Thanks for harassing me. Bye
---
They're trolling you. They got the exact reaction out of you they aimed for.
---
He's 15. Why do you care if he's as "good as he claims to be"? He's producing something, and he's not altering a direct image, and he's creating something new. He doesn't owe it to you to show you his drawing. He doesn't owe you a certain aesthetic or image quality based on your opinion of his drawing methods. He doesn't owe you ANYTHING. Lose the entitled attitude!
---
As someone who used to signal only when being camped, this has started getting me killed apparently. In the past 4 days I've been playing, survs would ONLY start coming for me once I started signaling. Now, as someone with 1k hours plus in the game, this confused me, because signaling on hook has always been to alert to a camping killer, not the other way around, but it seems like it's changed.   
---
From now on I'm using it to signal "Come get me." Just because that's the only way I am getting saved apparently. Not sure how to signal camping now though. Guess just stay still?
---
The alerting-crow sound is like the most stock crow sound also, I hear them in multiple movies and games all the time!
---
If your profile pic is from an anime your opinion doesn't count
---
It's just salt. They're most likely envious of the skill.
---
It’s dependent really. I’m not rank 1(rank 10) and there are days where I hit every great skill check and there are days where I can’t hit it no matter how hard I try
---
Yeah, and you don't know if the dude's tracing or not. If he's making a faithful reproduction of a different media, why do you care how he's doing it? He's not putting into Photoshop and fucking with filters. And honestly, how would you feel if you created something and tons of people started accusing you of things, judging you, reposting your work making fun of it? If he did trace, I can see why he might lie about it--you guys are acting like vultures!
---
No, Hentai is a form of art. 
---
Or just delete Legion.
---
It is if used right and was a funny ass meme! 
---
I mean, look at your post history! You reposted his art making fun of it! I'm not really accusing you of anything, *I'm pointing out things that you actually did.*
---
‘’Creating something new’’
---
Lmao
---
Ur so bad, get good kid. You died
---
This is kind of random but okay. 
---
Hentai 😊😊😊
---
Because its one of the stupid things this game gets wrong... unless you play with super low dpi, the sense will always be extremely high. The devs are kind of stupid when it comes to decisions like that I believe the default is also really low % so you can't even lower that much
---
Hahaha, I'M harassing YOU? I'm not, but I'm actually really glad you feel that way! Maybe this is one small taste of what you did to that poor kid.
---
Hotline Miami 
---
Get a mouse that has the change dpi button so that you can adjust it for different tasks - for survivor, for certain killers...
---
thats amazing
---
Yeah, he did. He did create something new. He created what looks to be a 3D colored pencil version of what currently doesn't exist in that medium.
---
Honestly, I’d rather be rank 1 with people who are doing gens with 1 survivor running around the killer than all 3 others trying to 360 but constantly ending on hook
---
But again I’m rank 10 wtf do I know
---
You should've got his ass banned too then. 
---
By probably lining over a printed image of the splash art
---
This. I flap my arms whenever I can hear the terror radius.
---
It does. 
---
There's a reason why a lot of people play P3 Claudette. She's small, dark and has camouflage patterns.
---
&gt;all 3 others trying to 360 but constantly ending on hook
---
That's the issue with this game. It's so easy to rank up that bad survivors think they're good. Most of the playerbase is trash at this game. Most of the subreddit is trash at this game. Trust me, when you get hundreds of more hours in this game, you'll see. I've seen people with ~800 hours, people with legacy, and people with exclusives who are all terrible. Not just as one-offs, but people I see enough to recognise and they all run perks like Urban, Premonition, and put bulbs and lenses in their flashlights. It's sad, and I do wish that Rank 1 truly was for survivors who were actually good at chases and not playing like actual apes, but then it would take hours to find games.
---
Beautiful. The Pig is the best killer, don't even @ me.
---
Seriously, the reverse bear traps create a nice intensity in the game, for the killer, and the survivors.
---
His legs are priceless 
---
Little books scattered around the area - if you read from them correctly (with some skill checks) the mummy is temporarily weakened. And if you miss it, Evelyn pops up and berates you.
---
Ofc the guy with the anime pic
---
Word of advice; just link the twitch next time. A lot of people here aren't gonna take the effort to search into twitch just to try and find you.  
---
Happy streaming friend!
---
Stab catch up eat the stun and m1 why would you give them a free speed boost with your stun?
---
Yeah, that's definitely possible. But people are looking at the things that are different (like the arm in his cannibal, face lines, etc.) and saying that it doesn't mean things weren't traced. But then they look at the things that look the same (the apron, etc.) and say that it means things were traced. People are looking for evidence to back up the "He's tracing! It's cheating!" narrative and ignoring things that may disprove it. Do you understand how that could be problematic?
---
Also, if he was tracing, do you think he feels safe about admitting it after what happened? A bunch of people immediately flamed him, reposted his work making fun of it, etc. until he felt like he had to quit the subreddit. Do you think this is a community you'd feel comfortable admitting one of your "wrongs" to?
---
Nope franks is trash and everyone hates it anyways
---
Definitely trolling
---
It's the other way around. 
---
Every multiplayer game has a toxic side to the community
---
I'm just saying for the other posts that's been going on with OP, with all the people asking for proofs/video and yet OP gave a video of his other drawings which doesn't prove anything.
---
I understand that you don't have to make a skeletal figure, but OP's drawing is identical to DBD's art (as another Redditor posted a comparison) for him to be able to just whoosh one out.
---
I don't mean tracing in general. I meant in drawing. I thought it's an unwritten rule for awhile now that you should never trace another person's work unless for practice, and you should credit the original drawing if you wanted to post it?
---
I mean no harm, but I'm just abit concerned if he actually was tracing but kept denying it. Wouldn't want him to commit more plagiarism in the future. :/
---
Luckily I’ve been pleasantly surprised with not getting salty messages. Had a perma tier 3 Myers  face camp the first survivor he downed and none of us were trying to rush in to unhook her after noticing he wouldn’t keep chase to go back to stare at her we just went and did gens. She died and of course it was for dying light but we already were grouped up and had finish 3 or 4 gens so the three of us got out.  This was like rank 15 though so 
---
Just blame the lag! I hate when its on the edge of the great, that needle should not be thicc on the bottom
---
Then perish

They're placed in the same tier lmao.
---
I do like the lighting change but now the buildings and walls are black if i'm a certain distance from them &gt;.&gt;
---
Looks kinda traced tbh
---
Me too! He seems like a nice kid.
---
Lmao @DC'ing

Wraith and Myers over spirit? I didn't do that.

I just thank them for knowing my life was worth the safety of 3 others.

So glad I turned off psn messages the games already frustrating enough
---
It's literally his biggest downfall.
---
Anime profile picture to top it off. Bet he went to bed real happy that night while cuddling his body pillow.
---
I just spam it because Im bored, but if the killer is looking at me I just stay still 
---
&gt; Yeah, and you don't know if the dude's tracing or not.
---
[Give me a break](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/auhnw5/saw_a_drawing_today_oof/)
---
It would be the worst killer in the game, actually it would be not even playable. Mending takes almost no time at all, who works on gens while getting chased anyway? All killers already have that, all killers prevent survivors from working on gens while on a chase (except freddy cause the chase starts ages after he pulls you)
---
Im really sorry I hurt your feelings
---
Wait until you’ve got 4 different members of a SWF adding you to groups repeatedly and barraging you. Then you disable messages so they switch to sending friend requests with more nonsense.
---
That was the moment I shut it all down.
---
Definitely. I use watermelon pants on bald dwight and barely ever lose a killer, but when I was a claudette main I often lost the killer.
---
But zoomers are the future
---
No idea why that build particularly would be the "i let teammates die on the hook"...
---
actually, the darker tone skins get tunneled more than others...especially Claudettes
---
A lot of killers do need base stat buffs (wraith/freddy/clown etc) but gens and bad map deign are by far the major issue rn, games can be done in 4-5 mins by a team who have a functioning m1, and several maps have many glaring flaws (Haddon infinite, coldwind size + see though loops with zero mindgame)
---
The sheer lack of time any killer has to do their own objective amplifies every other issue in the game from crutch perks to SWF
---
I hope this is the same salty bubba that face camped me, I still escaped and the video is up on my reddit page.
---
But holy fuck face campers are pathetic
---
lmao 
---
Shitposts are fun debating a survior main who obviously has never played killer is not fun
---
Ok I'm def upvoting just because it's a DD meme. Anyone else ready for dd2??
---
Personally, I think he traced it. But I don't know that, and you don't, either. He could've printed the image out and worked on his drawing right next to it, watching every line and making sure they matched up. We don't know.
---
But I'll ask you what I asked someone else... If he did trace it, do you think you've made him feel like he can admit it? From the time he started posting his art, even the stuff that was super obviously not traced, people have been harassing him about it. He's getting a ton of flak for tracing now. Do you think he feels safe admitting that he may have traced? If you did something wrong and people were spamming your posts and reposting things you did and making fun of you, do you think this would feel like a safe place to admit it?
---
must be hard using its 4-5 counters 
---
Or there is a game offering
---
Do You want the switch huh
---
No, he was down there doing his frenzy shit over and over again. Lol. It was all to be a dick, he literally killed everyone 1 by 1. Wouldn't go after anyone else until he tunneled and killed off the 1st person, if we tried to take hits he would go around lol. Obviously if I thought he did this FOR Dwight I wouldn't of posted this. 
---
Damn there is gonna be a dd2? I could barely contain excitement for Risk of Rain 2 and Mount and Blade 2 but now dd2??
---
easily could pull off a pretty convincing leatherface cosplay. No mask needed! 
---
I was saying you put pig over wraith and hag
---
And myers above spirit 
---
You just need to find some better responses that don't play into their salt.
---
Perceptive, you are.
---
Yeah hatch standoffs are extremely survivor sided unless you have literally nothing better to do with your time. I watched a hatch standoff on a buddy of mines stream that went on for 2 hours and 45 min just because he is stubborn af.  
---
He was killer, and he did win.
---
wait isn't that supposed to be a good thing?
---
It’s alright, won’t really help against good killers
---
Pig is better than wraith by a longshot.
---
I'm contemplating changing hag.
---
I mean he already had killed 3 people,  he sat there while the Dwight did 2 gens, and opened the exit gate which was basically right beside him lol. The hatch was in the basement of the Myers map, and the door was literally right next to that house. I mean,  I'm not gonna stand there doing a frenzy for a half hour,  and listen to gens pop. But hey,  whatever floats your boat. I in MY opinion thought this was funny and knew some other survior mains would as well. But as always killer mains come in to attack with down votes and snarky comments. Like can y'all chill and lef survivors have fun on this game as well? I mean seriously. 
---
/r/Howtomeme

No thanks :)

Just break the pallet

These are some quality memes coming through.

I might get the switch when DBD comes out in the fall, but I’ll probably just use my gf’s.  
---
huh
---
I feel like that this chapter was being planned for a while we got our first information before the Legion was announced , Our other clue was that this is the oldest killer and survivor as of yet.
---
My thoughts are that it could be a conclusion to the hallowed blight event and whoever at the end of the diary is our new killer.
---
Poor taste? Perhaps
---
Edgy? Nah
---
I thought you were talking about a toxic build, franks and cold dirt
---
Soooo, legion auto frenzys?
---
I fucking love Hot Fuzz... but tbh Shaun of the Dead will always be my favorite of the Ice Cream trilogy. 
---
Nope! Artist here :) This is tracing/copying and is not okay. Using a reference means looking at other images of the thing you're drawing to see how to draw it accurately (Like looking at a reference of an ear to accurately draw it- or maybe a pose such) This is copying. Copying is only okay if you're doing a realistic painting/drawing of something. This is a video game character, where copying would not be okay.
---
Hit or miss, I guess they never miss huh
---
I mean Amanda is all alone , sure maybe it wouldn't be balanced to have Julie at max speed multipliers but I hope she doesn't stay alone for long.
---
Imagine using the search bar. 
---
He didn’t write though, he sent voice messages.
---
Yeah in my opinion the lowest possible sensitivity in a game should be impossible to make a full turn. Not that anyone will actually use the setting that low but now people have the option to put the sensitivity anywhere.
---
**No Mither is supposed to be a hindering perk. Enough with the buff suggestions; only use the perk if you feel up for a challenge.**
---
That being said, I do feel that No Mither should give you a 5,8,10% BP gain. 
---
Rip
---
Nobody knows.
---
You’re allowing yourself to become jaded &amp; prejudiced based on the behavior of some people. You’re talking about facecamping some survivors because of actions that they themselves may not be guilty of. Stating that it’s ok to do so because of their builds is just silly. Any player (killer or survivor) should feel free to build any type of character, that’s what they’re there for, after all. 
---
The game is meant for everyone playing to have fun. Stating that you’ll intentionally play less than respectfully because other survivors have behaved that way towards you is just redundant &amp; becomes cyclical. The new survivors would then treat the next killer poorly because of how you treated them. 
---
In this case, it’s just best to be the adult. If a survivors acting like a turd, ignore it. They’re not harming you, let them be immature. Don’t disrespect yourself by dropping down to their level. 
---
tfw community cant appreciate real art smb
---
Yeh I like going around finding obvious totems and keeping them and destroy the less obvious ones 
---
Honestly Claudette is exactly like the Plague Doctor.
---
Some would think she’s a healer but everyone else knows she’s mainly there for toxic blight damage.
---
I don't play much survivor but as a killer main I wish I got more blood points for the time I put into this game. I run BBQ and chili every game just for the BP gain but at least it has a secondary part that makes it useful in-game. The BP gain from WGLF needs to be paired with another perk or introduce a new effect of WGLF that gives it some relevance in game.
---
Maybe even like become bonded with the last person you aided.
---
Wait I actually just came up with that and I kind of love it. The aura of the last person you took a hit for or saved from the hook is reveal for (Blank) time or until you are healed back to full maybe? This perk could be used to replace self care as is offers a BP gain and you can use the aura to go find someone to heal you. And with the new D-strike changes killers will go for the hook saver more often now. The down side being that if you get found and hit without saving someone you don't have self care or an aura to to find someone.
---
I was playing as Nurse against a Twitch livestreamer yesterday, and I always look back on the livestreams to see their reactions and how I did from their point of view.
---
The livestreamer was hiding in a locker and I walked right past it. Not only that, I even looked infront of the locker to see if there’s a pool of blood. There wasn’t, so I assumed nobody went into it.
---
I searched it first all I could find was concept killers, and people making concept killer perks, I searched new and popular from the past month, and the top 5-6 posts don't answer my question, it was just as easy for you to answer "yes in march" than what you said 
---
I'm a survivor main as well, but I get where the killer is coming from hanging out at the hatch.  Bro wants a 4K and if he does anything, Dwight escapes.  
---
I need my warm up games.
---
If I'm only playing 2-3 matches for the day I'm probably missing all the ruins.
---
Get me on a day full of DbD and I'll slam those bitches
---
Jesus Christ leave this guy alone. He might be using the original image as a reference and is probably a really good drawer. The shading is great and it looks good. He even admitted on a comment that he uses the images for referencing. If he spent a long time on this then it is dedication that should be congratulated not criticised for. Since when did the whole community suddenly become art critiques.
---
1. You get 4ks because you're a good M1 killer, and survivors are playing badly against you. Bottom line is, you're better than the survivors you're facing, not that Clown is good. Scott got a 32 4k streak or something on speed limiter LF. Doesn't make LF good.
---
2. No, he slows down while revving it up as well. 
---
3. The bugs do exist. I myself ran into a bug with Clown before I even started my first game (which was Haddonfield lmao) - I didn't start with his teachables. I had to get them in the bloodweb.
---
4. I know all killers have bugs and downsides. But even if Clown actually worked properly, his downsides would outweigh his upsides. That is how a killer's strength is measured, no? Their pros versus their cons.
---
Filthy Frank doesn’t make me want to kill my self though 
---
I doubt a good opportunity came along that quickly. We’ve been talking about this particular killer for, idk, two patches now? When spirit came out and we were getting teased for legion they told us that THIS killer would be the oldest to date, meaning they’ve had it planned out, and I doubt they’re gonna delay an idea they’ve had planned out for a licensed killer. 
---
So standing on the hatch while he did 2 gens was gonna get him a 4k? Lol. Dwight got out. 
---
Its just the concept of 3 survs doing gens fast as they can while 1 runs the killer around.
---
If the killer downs the 1 person or decides to do other stuff and isn't shit, gen rushing gets shut down as a tactic to an extent. 
---
There will always be 3 more survivors than you though,  and i still don't think it's toxic, any more than ruin, just the way the game goes. 
---
I mean you aren’t wrong since they both require timing, but timing for DS is easier to master than it is for Dead Hard. Dead hard requires you to predict when a killer will swing and sometimes your predictions can be wrong and you use the perk too early. With DS, the only really difficult aspect of the perk is the quick skill check that occurs, which isn’t that difficult to master. 
---
Looks more like The Spirit. 
---
Killers: just don't go down
---
Also Killers: survivors creating long chases are broken
---
I'd say Aftercare already fills this aura role, and I believe it lasts forever unless you get hooked.
---
This is of course anecdotal, but matchmaking has been fine for me and the players I know/watch/play with for months now. If anything, with these recent shake-ups of the matchmaking algorithms, it has been getting noticably worse again, taking more time to get into a lobby (especially if SWF), getting a lot of red ping lobbies. Benefit of the doubt: this might be a more-or-less to-be-expected side-effect of the experimental phase of improving the algorithms.
---
Anyway, my thoughts on this are similar: it seems pretty inconsequential a thing that they maybe even put out there primarily to be able to say "we're doing something", when there's really so much that should and could be done to improve the game, that they are just never getting around to, and haven't - for months, sometimes years.
---
"Match-making" changes that I would actually be excited about would be more to the effect of having a preferential pairing of players in dependence on their respective kill/escape rates and playtime. This would of course not replace the usual matchmaking factors region and rank, but would be factored in additionally, making the best-possible match when taking into account those things after-the-fact of the usual matchmaking considerations.
---
Bought the game on pc on Friday after taking a long break from console and played my first game as a WGLF David versus a Cold Dirt Legion.
---
 I just thought you guys were overreacting about how unfun legion is to play against. I learned my lesson fast 
---
i do this all the time because its fun to troll them like this XDDDD
---
If Dwight went for the hatch, yes, it would, because he could grab him as he jumped out.  
---
If killer swung at Dwight before, Dwight would get his speed boost and be able to escape via hatch.  Killer's only hope here was to pull Dwight from the hatch as he was jumping in.  Like I said, lose/lose for the killer
---
My poor boyfriend is so vulnerable to salt but he refuses to not feed into it,  here and in league.  I keep telling him,  mute outs your best friend,  and don't listen to salty killers!

Knowing from experiences gridding is a pain in the butt.

Mclean did a stream a few days ago and when asked about new chapter he said well how have the last 3 chapters dropped and said there is your answer. Thing is usually there is a teaser by now which makes me think this is a licensed killer that a teaser would ruin the reveal of and i know people will say well all the licensed killers got teasers, but the difference is this will be the first licensed chapter that has a ptb that reveals it instead of just being dropped with an update so maybe they are keeping it under wraps so when the ptb drops its a big reveal instead of a teaser ruining it.
---
Yeah I feel like a lot of my friends I talk about this game are already close minded about it.
---
Even my boyfriend doesn't want to try it because the game "it's too depressive".
---
I mean, like, he's dating me. *I am* already too depressive.
---
Normal speed, as opposed to the other female killers who are SLOWED. You got it wrong.
---
When you try to pick somebody up only for the flashlight squad to emerge from around their corner. 
---
Source for that ?
---
Always bring them to the hatch,happened to me as well and had to dc
---
There is counter play to legion. You can smack them in the face with pallets and use stealth to sneak away after they hit you in Frenzy as they have no scratch mark vision then. You could also just do stealth and not get seen in the first place.
---
The only Legions without counter play are the assholes that run Franks Mix tape and Stab Wound Study.
---
Mclean did a twitch stream a few days ago and someone asked when new chapter would be and he said something like "how have the last 3 chapters dropped?.....there's your answer" so if we go by last 3 chapters then there should be a ptb tomorrow and new chapter dropping about 10 days later

Do you not understand that the Switch port will push forward the changes needed to make the game better ?
---
Better performance, dedicated servers, all this will be necessary for the Switch port. It will benefit every other platform.

my eyes hurt just looking at this
---
Correct.
---
In the movie she has a gun, so why the fuck does she have an asssassin's creed blade when she can just shoot survivors. I guess not that much smart for the pig.
---
Nobody wants to see survivor gameplay
---
Moonwalk "exploit." If you can't lose a killer who isn't even looking at you, you should probably just dc from every match, lol
---
no problem, dunno why people gotta be such asshats when people ask questions on here, though even though mclean said this he still didn't give an exact date, im just taking his answer and looking at how the last 3 chapters/ptbs dropped so that would be mean ptb would be this week and ptbs drop on tuesdays apparently so yea tomorrow should be the date for ptb. but if not then i think there is a dev stream this thursday so if ptb doesnt drop tomorrow then i bet on stream they fill us in on details and give us a teaser :)
---
I always get a claudette to d/c because of doctor.. there’s no hiding allowed!!!

Normal as opposed to all killers.

How can you not lose a killer who is looking at the damn ground? lol

Just a fuming knight with a great sword 
---
When I try to go down to the basement from the side of the wall as the killer’s coming up the stairs, only for him to turn around as i drop down.
---
Bing bjöng
---
I mean that gun does get her killed ultimately. 
---
And you guys still went for the unhooks instead of treating it like camping?
---
I had a killer do this as the Wraith, she just didn't want anyone to touch her 1 totem. Other than that we could do whatever we wanted. 😂 It was weird, but I wasn't complaining. 
---
I teach art myself from time to time :) I get your point and I know the difference between using a reference and tracing. It's actually a very hard topic, because I think that tracing for non-commercial use is totally fine and helps people getting into art way smoother. Of course simply tracing won't bring you far, but tracing can actually help people understanding the shapes the human body consists of.

Yea I dont either, the guy who I started the argument could have easily told me the answer, but wanted to be a dick, then he said try searching it and linked me to posts not even relevant, anyway at least I know now, and excited to see who the new killer and survivors are, thanks again friend!
---
camping killers are actually the worst, completely ruins the game for the one guy being camped but at the same time allows the other survivors to escape, so joke's on them, fucking idiots
---
Read the source I've linked you to. The Pig has the same walking speed as The Trapper, Freddy, Billy, Myers, etc.
---
What a trip
---
Can relate. It was a Bubba as well. The rest is history 
---
He will escape as soon as he runs back through the exit. I know it’s not intentional, but it’s kind of a neat Easter egg type thing. You can run all the way around the map and go to the campfire and stuff. Now they’re going to fix it since it’ll get traction in here. 😓
---
Lag is the absolute worse on both side. I can’t count how many times I’ve lost a game as killer because of blinking survivors. On the flip side, it’s crazy the amount of times I’ve been whacked while standing on the other side of a dropped pallet, or had to pause at a window before vaulting. 
---
Is that a scene from Visage?
---
what 
---
Yes, I hate leaving someone die on their first hook &amp; he wasn't the greatest so I was hoping some could get away. The first person had no chance,  second got a decent run,  but had to struggle on the first hook because I got downed under it. So when she got caught, she was dead. I actually got away from him, but yesterday was my off day and healing myself was a chore of missed skill checks. 😂 So I wasn't mad at all he got me. It was actually more of a funny match,  than a rage one. That's kind of why I shared the post,  but everyone's taking it to deep. 
---
Yeah I know I just don't want Amanda to be alone.
---
Stoopid tracer!1!11!!!!! U shuld be bannnaned from dying light!!!11!!!
---
No, im saying its funny how he exposes tracers. Did you forget to grab a few brain cells on the way out?
---
No, I think you just created an environment in which he's damned if he does and he's damned if he doesn't. And I don't really feel pity for him, actually--I'm defending the art. I think that you don't have a right to decide what is art and what isn't, especially when the arena we're in is one of stolen memes and other derivatives.

We are getting closer to that teaser, i hope people don't riot if it's not the Bee.

sucks though when they are SFW and the just say "He has insidious" 
---
Whole comment section is just alot of r/woosh
---
It's okay, I understand.
---
Don't get me wrong, the issue of not having dedicated servers are bad, but in general, I can get in a game with steady 40-60 ping (accourding to MLGA) and I will still get hit when the killer is turned away from me, hits through pallets, the whole deal. When I have 120-160 ping I have the same issues sometimes worse, sometimes better. The hitboxes are the bigger issue in my opinion, but since the update where if you are in the path of the swing, you get hit, it's been real hard to 360, not necessarily the hitbox in this situation all the time. It needs to be back where it only hits when the weapon actually hits your character, not right at the start of the swing can hit you, then it reg when you are 2-3 meters away.
---
Huhuhhuhh EA BAD
---
Basically to be toxic.  Which they'll re-label as meming to try to avoid being called out for camping.  Apparently it's only ok if they do it,  because it's them. 
---
Notice how I started that sentence with "if". You put exploit in quotations, as if you were offended that he equated moonwalking Legion to something that is frowned upon.
---
Yes, the devs confirmed moonwalking as Legion to let the timer bleed out wasn't an intended mechanic, ergo an exploit.
---
Hahhaha, I've done this before as Wraith. I stood in front of my totem &amp; only went after people when they tried to take my totem. I 4k-ed the entire team because they were obsessed with it--it was only thrill of the hunt &amp; I was trying to depip.

The Deep Wounds effect is more visually disorienting than the Clown's gas, and the Clown's gas is more-or-less entirely meant to be visually disorienting.

The screen doesn't need to be that dark and the blood effect doesn't need to block the entire screen. I'd be happy with the old Borrowed Time B&amp;W effect.
---
Yeeah I guess that makes sense, he wanted his one kill. I’ve noticed killers always do that, they’ll camp the person hooked when all gens are done. 
---
What do you expect? You ruin the fun for people by camping, them, of course they're going to hate you. That's not to mention you play legion, which is albeit a dogshit killer without frank's, is one of the most unfun killers to fight. When you ruin other people's time playing the game, expect assholes to verbalize/ textualize their hatred towards you.

No they would still camp and tunnel. If you were to make objectives longer then make hook time longer to counter act the campers that will still be there. You say killers fear being tbagged? Really? There are amazing killers out there who don’t camp and tunnel yes, but there are more killers who do then don’t and making the game longer will just make those killers get 4k when they don’t even deserve 1 kill.

Yes!  Piggy and Huntress for Hotline Miami 3!
---
Exactly 
---
“Electrified dildo”, ahahaha
---
How hard was the “where did they all go” achievement?
---
Yes uwu
---
If the games were longer, it would still be easier to get kills that way and now they'd have even *more* time to get those kills. Just because they have more time, doesn't mean people are going to change their playstyles. Maybe some will, sure, but not all of them. I'd say barely *any* of them, tbh. 
---
So a while back Behavior bought full rights to "Dead by Daylight", publishing and all. When they did this they were now allowed to speak publicly about their future plans for the game. They  said they plan on releasing a new chapter every 3 months with a mid-chapter balance patch being right in the middle. So a month and a half after releasing a new chapter. small patches can occur at any time but the big ones happen with the mid-chapter patch.
---
Hey and I did I made I got 100%
---
...and I’m saying that what you’re proposing as “counter play” isn’t actually counter play. You’re relying on the person playing Legion being an absolute potato, but if they’re even remotely competent, you’re not going to juke them. 
---
S tier- nurse, duh, but Billy is easily looped with little mindgame potential. I'd place him in A tier.
---
A tier- Myers? he has no loop potential and has limited instakill potential. not to mention how awful it can be to get out of Tier 1 against survivors that understand how to fight a Myers. B tier
---
Clown can get gen rushed way too fast due to his pitiful map pressure and how optimal survivors can generally deal with his tonic. B tier
---
Spirit has a plethora of ways to mindgame the survivors and end chases fast or surprise them and get a free hit early in a chase. S tier.
---
Huntress is alright I suppose but I think she might be B tier with my anecdotal exp. with her and against her. Hse feels too slow.
---
B tier- Trapper, really? he can get bullied so easily, if he doesn't get extraordinarily lucky with his traps, he can't get enough momentum to dominate the match.
---
Pig can also get looped very easily with her ability being used just to slow the game down "just a little bit" I think you're right to place her here but I could see where people would believe she is C tier.
---
C tier- I'd place LF in B tier simply due to his instadown capabilities but I'd be willing to bet that this one is an unpopular judgement.
---
Hag should be A tier due to her ability to completely cut off loops and safezones for survivors ie: coal tower, The game basement hallway etc.
---
Great movie
---
For that one does it have to be exactly 3 blinks or can it be more?
---
yaaaaaaaay more people play spirit /s
---
Respect women
---
I'd love a Vigo survivor paired with a Void killer.
---
ya do know that pigs don't have fur? 
---
Should i get the we're gonna live forever?
---
I did 3 blinks idk if you can do more I mean it it says 3 blinks then I think it has to he 3 blinks 
---
You would be forcing them to mend while pressuring other survivors. If mend takes no time, make it take longer I guess? Legion is already designed with this pattern in mind, there's no world where they can viably down survivors with frenzy. Being able to quickly and reliably interrupt a survivor or two while chasing another as an m1 killer doesn't strike me as particularly bad.
---
Sounds good on paper but this will easily allow a killer to keep a survivor on the hook and in game indefinitely
---
Or I juke them, force then to look up and start the chase, and the second they do, I lithe the fuck away....
---
Finaaaaa, Oh wait...
---
Worlds greatest detective back at it again
---
No it's not, lol. If you are good enough, you can force even good legions to look up and find you, restarting the chase and giving you a solid 10 seconds to lithe tf away
---
Yep I only play killer now as the hitboxes,lag,  face-camping and lobby dodgers have ruined survivor for me. Even if I dont kill anyone as killer at least I get a lobby straight away! 
---
Are you in this picture and you don’t like it?
---
I care
---
I know, I'm captain of the SS No Shit Sherlock.
---
Feminism is giving Amanda a 115 gal pal!!!
---
You know how easy this is to fix?  Click on add ons then click back on perks. It happens all the time
---
Given that I think NOED is fine as is, I usually don't like a lot of the ideas, but this certainly isn't bad. But I wouldn't have it tied to a cleansable hex at all anymore, just have it be a perk. Still lets it keep a lot of strength. Maybe with the caveat that if all five totems are cleansed the perk doesn't proc. 
---
seen something like this posted before sounds cool. side note would love for all the dull totems to explode like hex totems when cleansed.
---
And than they walk back &amp; check it.
---
I think playing Legion as intended (without Frank's Mix Tape / Stab Wound Study and not trying to exploit) does help one learn certain Killer mechanics while also having unique gameplay when compared to other Killers, but it's far too easy to fall back on cheap tactics and exploits when the going gets tough and the stigmatization of playing Legion is far too strong to properly enjoy them.
---
I really like Legion but I feel like an asshole when I run Bloodhound, and I get called a toxic exploiter even when I run Yellow addons and stab a Survivor a full 4 times with FF.
---
Legion can't be an m1 killer, he has no base move speed for that. Also as I said you already limit someone from working on gens during chase with almost all killers.
---
I do realise that I'm playing as Claudette but still don't get how that LF at the very start didn't see me.
---
I mean - yeah I did have fun though. Bodyblocks are hilarious. The game for killers is about enforcing a sense of dread - a growing feel of hopelessness.  Whats worse than knowing you're going to get downed and hooked? knowing you cant leave :D
---
I am the bodyblocker king :D
---
Offensive jokes are funny because they are offensive. They make fun out of the offensive.
---
When I make a joke about 9/11 and terrorism, I'm not advocating terrorism - I'm making fun of terrorists, which is the opposite of what they want. Terrorists want people to be terrified; by making jokes about them, it literally turns them into a joke, fighting against terrorism. I think this is a new genre of jokes that people above a certain age threshold will not understand because it's just not from their time.
---
This may sound stupid but I don't think ruin does really anything if your using the fuck-your skill check build cause like your already making ppl hate them selves with distressing and unnerving presence I think I would switch it for brutal strength or something idk 
---
"owwww... i' lealeh hur's..."
---
quite true, they always go for that sweet basement 4k
---
Ain't nothing wrong with that 
---
They didnt get a chance to :)  Just gotta be aware of where those collisions are. :) Theyre lucky I wasnt shock doc that round. That annoys the crap out of people being stuck in the same spot t-rexing over and over :D
---
I never knew I needed this so much, thank you friend
---
Deformed cripple: 230% movement speed
---
No one likes going against a Michael I feel there pain 
---
I'd hope not, since sometimes shit happens. Obviously there's a difference between someone AFKing to depip and someone AFKing because real life but I guess it could also be hard to tell. I guess maybe take a look at their game records?
---
I was hyped, but then I saw the satire tag. Please don't do me like that again dude
---
Lol I just start flailing my arms regardless of what's happening. It's just something I do to help pass the time. 
---
I’m proud of uuuuuu, good job!
---
WTF NO NOED IS A GARBAGE PERK CLEAR THE TOTEMS N00B
---
/s
---
Thanks! 
---
I'm probably totally wrong but I'm hoping the next Killer will tie into the preestablished somehow, since they're the oldest.
---
Soosurvivor can just leave a totem knowing damn well that they wont get down??
---
Why do yall survivors just wanna nerf killers
---
Theyr the power roll
---
It’s a bee, stop lying 🐝 
---
What is more annoying: 
---
Being hit by the killer after throwing the pallet or hitting a survivor in your screen but not injuring him in the game ( this will happen if killers arent the host)?
---
This made me tear up. Your work is awe inspiring. 
---
It's not about playing against a killer that you don't enjoy to play vs, it's about getting to actually play the game.
---
I'm not playing the game of dead by daylight if it's against a Frank's mixtape/moonwalking exploit Legion. I get hit and downed no matter what I do, I might just well leave the keyboard for as much of an input means in that match. 
---
If that Legion wants to ruin other players' game, I'm not giving them the pleasure of doing so, I'm out.
---
No, they would just still do it because they’d achieve even more success with it. Even if by slim chance someone did change their playstyle, as soon as they felt behind in any game they’d just revert back to their old ways. Again, you can’t balance things around an honor system for killers. The devs would have to find a way to actually force these methods to no longer be used, and we know that’s never going to happen.
---
BING BONG MAUN
---
Well played
---
I smiled because I hopped on today for the first time since the Spirit was teased and released and I'm having a great time as killer. I haven't even been on this subreddit in a long, long time because of life stuff but it's as wholesome as ever. I missed you guys. 
---
I'd attach the typical "anime" art style more to the manga art-style but it's commonly associated with anime as well. There are many different styles of anime and not all of them are manga-esque, but most of them are manga-esque which is why the manga art-style is generalized as anime art.
---
True, but with inexperienced or semi-blind killers it can mess with them. I usually tell where they are from the breathing, shoutout to a very nice headset lol.
---
***Bing Bjöng***
---
Who fucking cares? Guy drew a picture for fun with a reference. But there's little proof either way for tracing or not. All you guys are doing is making this a guilty until proven innocent case. Even if he did, so what? Learning how and why someone chose to draw a particular set of lines is part of learning. This is sickening. Sorry OP.
---
The best kind 😩
---
indeed, a good headset and keen ears can help a ton!  ive found so many by rustling grass, which for some reason can be crazy loud on some maps
---
Me too! We'd finally get to learn more about this game's incredibly neglected lore.
---
New killer: The shaman .
---
Power: Voodoo.
---
Hints: Oldest killer and Africa.
---
Anything that nerfs NOED has my support
---
Right, if you are currently getting 2 kills a game doing something, for example, and now you can get 3-4 with it? Why would they stop.
---
NOED is an awful and unfair perk for shit killers imo. Just like DS was for survivor's
---
I'm curious, what do you think the 3 survivors who aren't being run by the killer should be doing in the meantime? 
---
[I'm really sorry but I just can't upvote](https://gyazo.com/32ecaa4d58fb4241c87f75b1f9c663d5)
---
Same here. Didn't see the Shitpost flair
---
When I wasn't at killer shack and I left the person, they would have a person waiting to divert my attention and take me to the house up top at the swamp and loop me at the double window double pallet. It was almost safer then killer shack for them. Also I know about blood lust that wasn't really a problem for them. Cause claud would block the door and if I got too close to quientin and if I charge my chainsaw she'd sprint burst away and if I swing she'd just take the hit and be gone with sprint burst plus my hit move speed. It was very hard, I tried everything I could think of. Didn't respect pallets, respected them, Revd chain saws at pallets then cancel it to fake them. They were just always 2 steps ahead always I couldn't mind game them ever.
---
"Gen rush" doesn't exists but okay
---
He failed to kill students, how should he be capable to kill looping survivors lol
---
Guilty until proven innocent eh? Take a look at the original picture and OP's. For one, the apron is shorter in OP's which makes him look rounder. Second, his arm is farther away from the body than in the original. There you go.
---
Noted
---
No ed is fine the way it is. It is a perk that only works in the end game so the killers are handicapping themselves already. It is a pretty good idea, but it does not need a nerf.
---
They won't do that, they want the killers to be Human
---
Actually a great concept ngl,I’m a survivor main and I wouldn’t mind playing against that
---
I have wanted one to live you tell the story.
---
You can usually spot a SWF group, and can dodge the lobby if you think it'll be bad, though it can be a very good learning experience. Or, play one of your best killers with their best perks if you want to play it out. Also, with SWF, it's usually best to stick around the hook at least for a little bit, because they tend to be super altruistic. 
---
As for the shack, best way to go about it is just to run it. He can only go through the window three times before it closes up and he either has to move on or use the pallet. If you're interested, you can always run anti-looping perks like Bamboozle, Enduring, Brutal Strength, and Spirit Fury. 
---
I'd suggest looking up killer gameplay. It can help you out when you're first learning. I watched a lot of Monto's builds before playing killer and his mindgame tricks and perk builds helped me out. While it seems like you had an irritating game, keep at it! You'll get better and you'll be able to punish survivors who play like them in no time!
---
Imagine thinking that you need bamboozle to counter shack. Yikes
---
It is!
---
Because they're all "personal" perks that directly affects no one but you. Yes they can be used to make saves etc, but they will also allow you to not give a shit about others and just hide.
---
Its also claudette, who is the best to just hide in the shadows.
---
Someone who lets others die on the hook wont go for wglf, we'll make it etc.
---
Someone who goes for saves might go for such a build, but might also go for borrowed time, empathy, bond, we'll make it etc, or medkit/flashlight.
---
You know I wouldn’t be too opposed to that 
---
Changing the hit boxes to match the characters would put too much strength into smaller characters in the game. 
---
Imagine David and Claudette, completely different body types and you need to have some sort of normality for the game to be fair. 
---
That absolutely sucks. Poor Amanda :(
---
Treat facecamps like a badge of honor if it's right in your face
---
At some point it's like collecting pokemon
---
They got their twitch listed and I can listen to what they said on discord or stream. Sometimes they tell me what they said on discord. Again you are the one making assumptions again.
---
&gt;I wouldn’t care if you built your nurse however you wanted lol. I personally think the nurse is fun to play against, regardless of build. She’s my favorite to fight, especially when she’s tough. 
---
Big yikes. Not me bud. I hate playing against a "good" nurse.
---
You said build and play however they want. Then you are telling me how I should play and treat others.
---
I don't understand where I was rude but I don't really care at the same time. That's just the way I write. 
---
Um.... rushing generators...?
---
Well, the pic and everything is great but instead of shirtless why not wearing his outfit  while stabbing?
---
It'll be cool as the actual  Myers.
---
How about NOED is only active if there are two \*dull\*  totems left on the map, and then one of them becomes lit.  For every OTHER dull totem on the map, gain 2% movement speed.
---
uhm you're missing my point here I think...
---
When there are new hitboxes for every site it affects the whole gameplay aswell...
---
It's not just body blocking but looping aswell and looping is a HUGE part of the game to some players atleast and it is sometimes the core gameplay after doing the gens lol
---
Neither do dragons, but you still call it a fursuit
---
They were trying to say "I had wanted one to live to tell the story"
---
Ooo I'm excited!
---
True. She did get to place some bear traps (she had a Last Will) and get some slaps.
---
&gt; Tunneling is the optimal way to win for bad killers
---
Fixed
---
&gt;Legion can't be an m1 killer, he has no base move speed for that.
---
Unless the killer is using an exploit, this is Legion's current state. If it's unviable then the MS needs to be buffed anyway. It's pretty well-understood that Legion is too weak unless you're moonwalking so buffs ought to be coming or else we're going to just have another Freddy.
---
&gt;Also as I said you already limit someone from working on gens during chase with almost all killers.
---
Most killers can't limit someone they *are not chasing.* Am I not doing a good job of explaining this? I feel like you are talking past me.
---
They need to work on stamina
---
Only works in the endgame...yeah but it instadowns at endgame, strongest effect possible so who cares when it procs it's free mindless downs you're gifted for playing a shit game and giving up all 5 gens you're supposed to protect.  It's been used as a safety net by weak players and now that there is no ridiculous survivor crutch ie decisive is about to be extinct it's about time to look to the killers decisive strike too.  At this point in the games balance there is zero reason to need to run noed.
---
Enduring + spirit fury for every single killer period. Every killer benefits from this combo and is a great way to end most chases. Next is killer choice, Bubba holds a special place in my heart that being said he is low tier. Unless your willing to put a lot of time into him and learn how to hug walls with his chainsaw(fun fact his final 6th? Chainsaw swing is just an animation and will not register) than 90% of the time the hammer is his best option. Switch to more meta killers and cry when you realise how much easier it is to use them over the low tiers.
---
&gt; as killers don’t get hit. 
---
Wanna know how I know you don't play Trapper? lol
---
So the killer just holds you hostage forever or until you suicide on hook? Not the best idea. 
---
That Sparta kick was legendary.
---
If you need NOED to play killer you shouldn't be playing killer.  It's a crutch used by baby players to mask how weak they are in chases and map pressure.  I don't even run that babydick shit on my Freddy.  Have some standards man.
---
I honestly not don’t think I’ve ever played with a Leatherface who wasn’t toxic AF 
---
"Haaaaaaaauughjrrhagahjjerraaahhhh!"
---
- Bjork, probably
---
It's a MUST watch!! xD
---
If you play trapper and fall for your own traps that’s a whole different story. I fall out of my chair laughing when it happens in game. 
---
I think hitboxes with regards to bear traps are pretty accurate. 
---
Yea I guess, but if they extend time on hook?
---
Animr profile pic ofc
---
Well I kinda doubt you do research on your opponents before you play them, lol. But that’s not important. 
---
Yes, I said build any build you want. Facecamping is not part of a build. It’s what a killer does when they want to secure a kill. It takes virtually no skill &amp; is hinders both survivor &amp; killer progress. Standing in front of someone isn’t fun, being condemned to death isn’t fun. 
---
Again, play to have fun, but throwing a tantrum &amp; facecamping only shows that you have failed to participate successfully. 
---
First of all, thank you. 
---
Cause i am doing the fans a favour by beeing Daddy Myers.
---
That's the whole reason I created this account.
---
I am cosplaying as normal Michael at cons and events each year.

She perdy

If they target me to get banned on PSN, i just repeat "stay mad boi" followed by "&lt;3"

Meme build, personal favorite of mine is Myers with thrill of the hunt and tombstone piece, its all fun and games until one unlucky survivor catches a surprise mori all because they couldn't just walk out the gate, just to damn greedy for my shiny totem.
---
Only playing LF to get BBQ. But that still doesn't change the fact on a low mobility killer I need to figure out how to do the harder loops and yeah I'm new to killer I have no idea how to deal with the harder loops. But all the other loops T walls, L walls, jungle gyms, and standard pallets are easy. Just kinda lost when it comes to shack and some of the random infinite that are on some maps.
---
Finally some new dwight clothes
---
No ed is a weak perk. If you think it is too powerful, do the totems. Also, remember it does not means you can’t juke them, also exit gates open really fast.
---
There are several killers you 100% would not run Enduring Spirit Fury on.  Nurse, Huntress, Legion immediately come to mind.  That's purely a setup for M1 killers.
---
I had a guy literally lie about being in a SWF group (said he wasn't) and that he "just picked the game back up" when he uploaded clips of him with that person and got achievements in DbD 8 days before. He started blowing me up with shit out of him being humiliated. It was honestly the most pathetic shit I've seen on Dead by Daylight
---
I really don't think their money-hungry like so many people claim. They release their DLC chapters for less money than I spend on my lunch, they have given DLC's and in-game items for free numerous times, and they have never made DBD "pay to win". 
---
I think the Devs deserve due credit and associated respect. 
---
Honestly the scariest experience I had was a Spirit with Prayer Beads coming out of no where. Whats worse was I was no where near a gen and got instadowned because no one knew she had Devour Hope yet.
---
BLAZE IT, MY SERVANTS OF THE ENTITY!
---
Just go away.
---
The recent ds change was fantastic and we can only hope the Noed change will be just as good. (If there is one.)
---
Sure :,)
---
Nah.  
---
I personally only use it on my Freddy build..  but it's in the game and has an easy counter.  If you're team can't cleanse 5 totems because you all want to just do gens and loop and use flashlights, then that's on you if you get downed and lose at the end anyways 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
It doesnt mean much Kenya was legions code name.
---
This was legit just here yesterday. 
---
You better believe it, baby *giggles*
---
May I get an extra stab in the mori? I've been a good girl.
---
Wait how is “A Feast for the Entity” only 500 survivors? It’s 1k sacrifices for PC players. Maybe it’s only for PS4 or console in general? 
---
Huh, must have missed it. Haven’t been here in a while
---
Good job,  now to work on those dlc trophies
---
&gt; I enjoy playing against Trapper because I generally run small game. 
---
yeah this is why I think bloody coil should be base kit. 
---
he's too easy to counter with zero way to stop it
---
I am a former legion main and I switched since it wasn’t fun to play a killer who can easily hit, but can’t down people unless you tunnel with feral frenzy, which is boring. I now play clown and I’m having fun with him
---
Wish there would be sort of platin trophy on steam..
---
I guess we’ll see, but I disagree. I just think people are going to get annoyed pretty quickly when they find themselves being tunneled, but still unable to use it. I don’t know why anyone who is competent at running would ever take this perk, as you can just screw yourself out of it. Plus the shortened stun? I don’t find it strong at all unless they do something about the running 60 sec clock.
---
I only use NOED on Freddy lol. Baby survivors who don't do 5 totems deserve the noed from anyone who decides to run it. If someone pays for the game- they have the right to play how they want lol. Just stop the stigma of noed and counter it or get better lol.

It's called solo queue.  Randos don't touch totems.  I take out every one but they don't even at rank 1.  I'm so sick of hearing just take out the totems because that is only reliable in SWF.  Ever since they took out the pallet vacuum I'd need a shower after running NOED.  The game is so much easier for us now we don't need that micropenis crutch.
---
Killer with first Peron view. BTW I'm more surprised that LF in shack didn't see the crows you got on the locker.
---
What is gen rushing tho? Just doing the objective, or something else?
---
It's so nice of you.
---
Thank you very  much :)
---
Lol instead of ringing his bell to cloak he takes a hugeeeee rip and just thinks he's cloaked
---
Cry some more I guess.  I am a red rank killer and I can tell you rank doesn't mean shit lol.  You should know this by now. 5 totems. That's it 🤷🏻‍♂️ if you don't like it get a group together and play and get all sweaty together or just play solo and bitch about it.  
---
&gt; I'm rank 15
---
Gross
---
They make the steam achievement look boring 
---
Well, it's certainly not because he's killing anybody. 
---
&gt;Well I kinda doubt you do research on your opponents before you play them, lol. But that’s not important.
---
Again more assuming. There is such a thing as watching the VOD after the game bud. After that you just remember it. 
---
There's no discussion to had with you. I'm positive you are on console and that is a completely different environment than on pc.
---
It's not about fun but you don't seem to think deep enough to understand what it's about. I. E. Ruining their fun. 
---
Lol the killers not a baby for running a perk designed to reward them with no skill instadowns for getting destroyed and losing 5 gens they're supposed to protect but survivors are babies for bot cleansing totems.  Lol baby killer logic.  Only SWF take out 5 totems randoms don't.  I've taken out 4 myself to still get rocked by that babydick bullshit from the Billy I ran all game without eating a hook.  Playing killer is stupid easy now since the pallet vacuum got taken away.  If you still need to run that crutch you're a pathetic killer man.  Just a survivor playing dress up.
---
ya heard of calm spirit? does wonders for the Doctor and Clown... ;)
---
That's good to know.
---
I am especially after good girls that want to get choked and stabbed.
---
You can get an extra stab, yes. 
---
Not a big deal haha.
---
I just uploaded one. 
---
I've never see this before. Nope. 
---
Legion is not an M1 killer, he is a "mending" killer. If you play him like a M1 killer he sucks ass.
---
Also as I said mending takes almost no time at all, then you won't control anyone you're not chasing anyway.
---
The huntress one is gonna be a pain in the ass 
---
Clown is probably worth it for bamboozle 
---
The saddest part is that BHVR will never address campering/tunneling. 
---
Is laterface the killer that's always late to the match?
---
Babydick perk man.  Hitting rank 1 killer is stupid easy I do it every month with Wraith and Trapper.  We don't need NOED and I'd you do you're just really bad. 
---
Thank you for your kindness, Daddy &lt;3
---
All the chokes and stabs please &lt;3
---
That's honestly not even the worst one. The huntress downs and deranged pursuit are definitely harder. 
---
Then just avoid the killer if noed pops if you're so good.  It's 5 totems. It has a clear counter. Not my fault you can't handle it lol.  As previously stated- noed is only ran on my Freddy lololol. Still doesn't matter- because anyone can run it. Just because you don't like it- doesn't mean others can't run it. Just keep crying about it. 
---
Cant tell if you're trolling or... 
---
only OBJ in the game. what are we just suppose to evade all together ?
---
I’m not trying to show off, I was just letting them know before they join. I don’t have good teammates.

It can take me 20+ minutes to find a game on PS4... sad face
---
My pleasure. 
---
Nice typos.  Anyways keep crying lol. 
---
So, I UE to a gen, bust it out, I'll see the killer coming, UE away. If I can stick to the gen and finish it, I will then SB away. Or, I'll SB to save you on the hook to get my WGLF stacks. But I am always out there fighting the good fight.
---
Nice, I tried to learn Nurse and I was decent. Then I took a break and now I can’t get a single hook at rank 10 to save my life.
---

---
Well... most builds are with "personal perks" since you can't really help anyone if you're dead...
---
This instance looks like it probably is. Freddy probably sees the Nea in front of him. 
---
Just some statements before I give my opinion (your not wrong, just want to explain my side)
---
1. Hitboxes for survivors NEED to be consistent across characters otherwise there would be a competitive advantage for Claudette over, say, David or bill. 
---
1.5 survivor hitboxes extend past the character models
---
2. Hatchet hitboxes are spheres (I assume clown bottles are too)
---
3. The killers’s hitbox is made so that every killer has the same range for swipes and lunges. It may look like one is faster/can swing Farthwr but that’s not the case
---
Having said everything above, it does explain why there are some hits that look bs. If they started by just taking the largest survivor, and mapping the hitbox to them, it would fix some things. Also take away the sphere hitboxes for projectiles and make them rectangles. 
---
Nah ur wrong checkmate
---
No u 
---

---
Do you even play this game? Do you not notice the occasional immersive Claudette who just urban evades the entire game doing no gens or unhooks
---
Quite a few console achievements are reduced, us plebs only have to cleanse 10 totems 
---
What's the change going to do to the Obsession perks?
---
"You shouldn't have gotten caught then"
---
Like ???? 
---
That's the whole point of the game?

That's  Perfect!

well better than sitting in a lobby forever, id rather play and  lose than not play at all.

Finally 
---
Oh, please let the trace thing become a meme.
---
Wait I sometimes have 90 ping and it still happens to me so whose problem is that ? My connection or the surviours ?
---
theres no need to. camping is strategically an absolutely terrible move by a killer so thats enough of a drawback. 
---
I find matches pretty fast on PS4 believe it or not. 
---
I think this a pretty cool idea. I’ve also wondered if the killer should need to meet some sort of requirement. For example, only survivors who have been hooked become exposed or something like that. I say this because let’s say you are up against a hardcore camper, guy camps on first hook of the game. Now, even killers here will tell you that you should just rush the hell out of gens to punish them. So you do that, and then NOED activates and this results in the downing of one or more survivors. You come on reddit to complain, and now they say “you should’ve done the totems” lol. I think it’s stupid that someone like that could potentially be able to wipe a team out when they did next to nothing all game.
---
Nah.  You wrong again.  NOED is easy to counter. Do the totems.  Any killer can run it top or bottom tier as they payed for the game and can play how they want. If this one perk is always getting you this bent out of shape maybe try a new game or be a better survivor 😂
---
What post is this parodying?

actually that makes sense, original humans were endurance hunters, we could run for far longer than any deer/animal despite how much faster they are than us.

---
The country code names don't mean anything
---
Bro I play rank 1 killer every month which is why it triggers me to see you baby pieces of shit insist on running it.  I know how easy playing killer is now we don't need it.  If you do you're just really really bad at playing killer.  Like you should legit say to yourself e ery game fuck, it took a perk to down this man...it shouldn't feel rewarding it should feel embarrassing 
---
I thought that too at first but maybe they only appeared right as I was leaving the locker. 
---
That's really not that hard to get, especially if you play with friends. Just have one person bring a key and another bring a map with a marker. Maybe burn an offering for one of the easy hatch maps like Haddonfield or The Game.
---
I've done it many times.
---
True, but still not right.

Thanks for typing all of that. I ain't gonna read it. I'll just say again your wrong. Easy perk to counter.  Cry. Rank means nothing.  People can play how they want/what perks.

Lol go baby on in your next game man.  Go lose them gens and "earn" your downs bro.  You're a legend!
---
The Holocaust reference is the joke. That's why its funny.
---
If this is the one perk that somehow turns the tide of the game, it is usually because the survivors are stupid, not the killer. Usually one person get downed and hooked. If the person has no ed you should not try to save them, if you try to and get downed it late your fault for being stupid. If someone has no ed it just means that you should leave ASAP.
---
Beautifully designed, well done! You could pass off as the real thing if you wanted to!
---
ToS applies to everyone, all the time. Instead of egging him on and committing the same bannable offenses he did, you should have reported him and stopped the conversation. Sounds like the ban was 100% your fault and completely justified.

---
Wow just for that?, I'll admit I've said things that would make even the most edgy edgelord go "Woah that's too far" and the most I got was a warning
---
“You” in this sense is used in an ambiguous sense. It doesn’t literally mean **YOU** but it is addressed to whoever it applies to. 
---
I'll post it tonight on on DBD gone wild. 
---
Holy shit is this real?
---
My criticism of NOED is exactly that, the first kill...naturally rest should just leave or find totem if he's hard camping.  But that first dude is basically just a free mindless skilless down rewarded for playing poorly and not protecting gens.  Your goal as killer should be to end the game with gens up, not to gameplan for failure and come equipped with a safety net for that shit.  Plan on dominating your opponents not crunching one out at the end.
---
Yeah... I figured that out, that's why my last response was. Probably best to not be ambiguous on the internet tho
---
agreed
---
also make resilience apply to it, it already does for snapping out of it &amp; etc and resilience was recently nerfed for vaulting
---
No haha it happened when I was like level 2
---
My icon is from An anime and my opinion is that society should change somewhat
---
Yeah console can get laggy with the skill checks, especially landing the decisive at time, some killer will hit an object to cause your frame rate to drop so you will miss the decisive skill check.  
---
Happy to hear that man.
---
Thanks. 
---
I keep forgetting to stockpile points before the PTB launches! I’m excited for the DS change on both sides on the game, and am looking forward to whatever this pre WW1 “by a long shot” killer is.
---
Rank 1 killer monthly doesn't use NOED getting called trash by an infant running decisive killer strike lol.  Oh the irony 
---
Its normally an intense focus on obj, and using things like toolbox, or perks that help with gens, or having a SWF group with spare parts, etc.

IMO Gen Rush is when you play in a 3 to 4 person SWF and all bring items and perks to help you do generators as fast as possible. The degree of Gen Rush varies, from three friends goofing around with Prove Thyself and Toolboxes, to four people all running BNPs, Mechanic's Toolboxes, and Prove Thyself. 
---
'Gen Rush' is a thing because Killers have no defense against the most severe kinds (besides NOED) because this game wasn't built around Survivors having communication and coordination at all times.
---
There's nothing wrong with people who Gen Rush, but it doesn't feel very satisfying on the Killer's end because the match ends without you getting to do much of anything. This stings because it is not as a result of *you* making a mistake, but because there was never really a chance for you to play the game anyway.
---
It's sort of a Killer's version of getting Farmed and Mori'ed off-hook.
---
Hi, please take my Nurse-Main upvote.

Ok was gonna say jeez im devotion 4 idk what level and that took a long time lol

Wow rank 1! Rank means everything and you must be so good!

Lololol that's how I know you suck, because rank isn't shit.  I don't even run noed.  Only on Freddy.  If you are too lazy/ suck too bad to cleanse 5 totems or dodge NOED that's on you bro! Sorry you're trash 😂😂😂
---
I recommend you watch DamnNoHTLM’s videos on dbd. Maybe you could learn something about dealing with those survivors.
---
It’s a common convention of the English language though.

I had a guy send a friend request over 100x... because I sacrificed his 4 man SWF as Doctor. I think they were trying to make me mad, but I just found it hilarious that someone could get so upset over 1 loss. Some people will never grow up.

Exchange sprint burst for balance landing and you have the "im going on chace to make time and lose the kiler" kit
---
Comparing a killers ability and a perk people equip to have easy games is a bit of a stretch.  I like to think people would stop running NOED like I did after all the crazy balance updates us killers got to make games far easier but lots of them didn't get the memo and insist on having no risk at all in their games.  Ending chases quickly has never been easier.  There is no need for that perk anymore.  If you're new to the game okay I guess but red ranks killers still running that shit are embarrassing 
---
DBD kinda biased asking here but this games playerbase is still here 2 years on and has been through some rough times os i think we are here to stay
---
Oh, so genrush requires bringing items? I don't normally use items but I take resilience and prioritize the gens and end up soloing 2-3 per game.
---
You could of a been a sport and gave him a kill
---
No reason to call it build then if its just character + one perk...
---
Wow respect
---
well, like I said we strived on endurance, so pacing yourself was key.

Also, she probably snuck up on deer and crippled them with an axe shot, making running away no longer an option for her prey.

I’m proud to say I accomplished this before switching to PC! Going for the PC achievements as well. Wish me luck!

You're really annoying aren't you? Lol...

And instead it's oh so quiet in here.
---
You know, I haven’t played the game since Halloween because I got wore out from grinding for the event but god damn do I love this community. I unsubscribe from most game subreddits that I stop playing but this one just never stops giving!
---
Seriously. I was the only rank 1 survivor (solo) with rank 8, 9 and 12 against a rank 13 killer. I was trying to give the rank 8 the hatch and chased the killer around and when he hooked me in the basement I tried to kill myself on hook but she came for me and died. 
---
This is clearly just a trace. r/Exposed
---
Yeah I pretty much can't hit greats because my computer sucks.
---
I like your reasoning but you are missing a key factor which makes me also think this a decent chance. The shape was released 2 years before his new movie came out but there was a delay in production so the movie should have came out one year prior making a one year gap....candy man has a release date of 2020
---
So would lit totems like ruin still give a token for being up or is it only dull totems?
---
Nah they nerfed it to 20. I had 22, but stopped playing for three months. Started the game and the achievement popped immediately 
---
Instead of tryharding you could have gave him a kill at the very least.
---
This is entirely started because one person recreated renders of killers to a degree that looked almost entirely the same as the actual render, to a point of potentially tracing.
---
This tracing meme is entirely built off of because of that. Hence playground drama. Now having people make purposefully shoddy artwork and say it's "not traced" is exactly where pettiness comes into play.
---
Hopefully I made my point clear.
---
Dont worry i asked on both of the games subreddits to get an unbiased idea. I noticed alot of people on the f13 subreddit say dbd is better. I havent made my decision yet tho.
---
It's worse when you can't hear the bing bong... 
---
Good note
---
Yeah, i heard that alot.
---
That's... not a source. The source would be you, in that case, unless you can point to the actual game code (which you can't for copyright reasons), or another post confirming your sayings
---
headass
---
I disagree. I'd rather swap out This is not happening and just get better at aiming for the normal great skillchecks. Technician can be handy for repairs if the killer patrols but doesn't come all the way, relying on sound to judge and personally it has helped me hear the more stealth based killers sooner thanks to the generator not being as loud as it always is.
---
That's weird, it might not have changed because I got it before they nerfed it I guess. 
---
It’s not ambiguous in the sense that the meaning is hard to discern. If you speak English as a primary language then it’s a *very* common way of phrasing something . (I *just* did it. I used the word “you,” but it doesn’t refer to **YOU**, it refers to to whoever is reading and it applies to)

I've always viewed the arms waving as the killer is camping. That was the general concensous when I started playing. Regardless, I've played across all 3 platforms and it's literally 50/50 across all three.
---
Dont they release updates on f13?
---
He got 1 kill, but your bad. "Ooooooookay" lol
---
Wow that bulge though. Was that in the reference art or from memory. 
---
I'm honoured. Thank you! Where do we meet for it? &lt;3
---
You forgot the bottle and I like wraith next to you
---
You can't see the ranks until after the match, so they couldn't have possibly known they were rank 19.
---
Hell yeah, and then when all those bee memes came out I was like wtf?? Am I missing something? I’m pretty sure that was completely unrelated though.
---
Okay so normally I don't like juke clips on here but moonwalking into the 360, that's a post for sure.  Nice moves.
---
Lol 5 survivors have gun holsters with no gun.
---
Do you have offerings?
---
The place doesn't matter, the penetration of the knife matters. 
---
I dont see a reason to be rude i was just saying it can help
---
I mean it sounds like a decent idea in practice but I feel like it’ll only exacerbate the issue people have with Facecamping in the long run cause people have a tendency to just be mean to one another and it’s clear the emblem system isnt enough to deter people from Facecamping. Hopefully the DS changes can let people fight against that more. 
---
Way too nice. I explained in another comment. 
---
i do not want to run to another pallet. it would be a massive waste. you are stupid if you think lithe is good. why bother using lithe when you can just use another perk that will actually fucking help you in a chase
---
You don't need every perk on every character.  You just need the good perks you'd use on the characters you play.  Like not having De Ja Vu on every survivor isn't exactly a dealbreaker lol.
---
he was just never there but i think he was replaced with the second feng
---
Well for one if you’re rank 9 they’re probably not deranked. Rank just reset so they may have just not played in like a week. Other than that just try new things to beat them in loops and learn what works vs good players 
---
I think I said from the beginning that I'd only do it to people who deserve it. But every swf group out there never thinks that even one of them could deserve sweaty or booli treatment. 
---
I meant for how it is currently not after the change

You're right. So many places to use it as well ;)
---
I think worst spawn is Lerys Memorial by the exit gate. Nobody checks there
---
They do, unfortunately in the community it's become a meme that the updates tend to do worse than the problems they fix.
---
For example, unless it's been recently hotfixed, one of the most recent patches made it so your character selection gets randomized before the match. Between that and the cars getting flipped every five seconds, the experience is extremely annoying.
---
That' the first image that shows up when you google Jack Sparrow lmfao
---
A few hundred people are able to differentiate between a joke and nazi propaganda without needing to be second hand offended. 
---
Right? He picked Freddy in 2019. He never stood a chance.
---
You are too kind.
---
I'll let you farm some gens and totems, before I choke you and penetrate you.
---
One could say it’s still useful because if you are that good at hitting ruin checks, you’ll be equally as good hitting great normal ones, making the gens get done quite quickly 
---
That's very generous &lt;3 Whatever makes you happiest to stab me &lt;3
---
One may say you’re “devoted”
---
If I ever get this bent out of shape over a perk in a video game, please pull the trigger.
---
happy birthday
---
I just block them honestly. I will not ever give them the satisfaction of a response 
---
who has breathing problems 
---
Just cleanse totems (yes I said it; it's NOT that hard, run Small Game if you're like me and totally blind) or keep track of where a few are and check them as soon as the gens are done (if you're worried you'll miss one like I am on Coldwind or Léry's).
---
It only takes 14 seconds to cleanse a totem; 70 seconds (less time than it takes to do one gen solo) of cleansing and you've hard countered NOED before it can have a chance to activate. If you get hit by NOED, unless the Killer camped a hooked Survivor or dull totem all game, you only have yourself to blame.
---
I'm not saying NOED is a fair or good perk, but it's literally the only perk that *can* ALWAYS be countered BEFORE it activates. Nerfing it again would make it more situational than it already is.
---
The only nerf that wouldn't make NOED pointless would be if there was a buff to Small Game so that you knew how many totems remained in the trial.
---
I have had this problem for months. But as of late, it’s reduced in frequency. For me, I did a clean reinstall onto my C Drive, before which I disabled Steam Cloud synch. 
---
Whenever it happens now, I just restart Steam and it seems to go away. 
---
Its called stock sound...nothing special there sherlock
---
Against the legion
---
100% implement immediately.  
---
Wtf lol, level 20
---
Well both, but getting hit through a pallet happens way way more often 
---
put your graphics in low, it's the only solution i've found
---
That's true for survivors but I dont have all perks on all killers and that is a dealbraker.
---
Thanks I'm on PS4 so I'll probably just turn it on and off again or blow on the cartridge 
---
That might work too, sometimes it fixes overnight for me and I dunno why. Well, regardless, hope the problem fixes and stays fixed and I’ll see you in the Fog!
---
I’m still in green ranks so I’ve yet to come across a Frank Mixtape Legion, but I’ve heard that the add-on is cheese
---
Alright, I'm over it. If you cannot differentiate between two different things there's no point talking to you.
---
Yeah................................
---
Ding ding ding
---
Lol guess some of us aren't afraid to face survivors without the training wheels and some are.  To each their baby own I guess.
---
That's the joke
---
I hope when he uncloaks its in a puff of green smoke
---
One of the most creative ideas for noed i've ever seen. Please send this to bhvr, i would love to see this in game.
---
Good luck 
---
Dead by Daylight and Friday the 13th seriously need to have a love child, *that* would be an epic survival game.
---
DbD is a much better made game, but F13 has a way better objective layout. 
---
Thanks man 
---
How is that a dealbreaker?  How do you need every perk on every killer?  There is plenty of weak or unnecessary killer perks too man.  This ain't random perk wheel Monto.  You can do just fine having the perks you consider to be core.
---
It's a joke about some one doing that earlier, I mean this is just a Photoshop filter
---
You're welcome ^-^
---
From my experience, audodiadact is hard to get to 5 stacks unless you run empathy and really focus on healing everyone. It's return is also not that great. I would say we will make it, as it is really useful in quick heals after unhooking someone, and can be used to heal other people if they too are injured.

Okay so I'm a huntress main but have sub 500h on DBD so take this with a grain of salt. 
---
Iron Grasp with her movespeed is great. That being said, where Huntress has the hardest time is tracking so perks like BBQ are excellent, especially if you're learning to do long range throws. 
---
I finally got BBQ on my p3 baby after a very long grind and let me tell you, it's worth it. Tracking perks always are with her, honestly. 
---
Sloppy is just hilarious combined with her hatchets that apply mangled. (It only applies to her M1 hits iirc)
---
I also wrote a calculation when the PTB and chapter should be released. Same info that is written here. Howerver that one was stuck in new with 0 upvotes.....
---
The mori is just down to impeccable aim.
---
fucking hell
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
I suspect it's due to the fact that any cosmetics you get for free alongside the base outfit is fairly similar to the base outfit. The reason legion is a unique case is because he has to be at least one female and one male(Otherwise they couldn't have advertised the killer as a legion, so much as a single killer with multiple gender MTX'es)
---
It's more so the foundation of base outfits you get with a killer than anything else that left Julie to eat dirt. Poor, poor Julie
---
You’re welcome
---
lol. Why can't it be both? I can be offended at whatever I damn well please. I bet tons of shit offends you. I'd just have to dig deep enough to find what it is. 
---
Another trash ass noed user. 
---
I don\`t think you can balance NOED for both Rank 20 (survivors with no teamplay no dead hard adrenaline ds insta heals etc) and Rank 1. They could add weaker Versions of NOED / RUIN for RANK15 or above that would be fine for me. 
---
Bing *Bjöng*

Thank you ! I am leveling up bubba for bbq right now , only reached 13 hours ago 
---
This game is very grindy man 
---
It really is. Your screen turns to black with deep wound. 
---
Thank you! To me it would still feel strong, but manageable. If you get hit with that, you'd be able to go; oh well I guess that's fair.
---
That would much better, bbq or discordance and that is a nasty huntress build
---
Approved!  
---
Ah that's the comment I expected SALT ON ;)
---
i assume they're testing a new version of the updated matchmaking right now since everyones posting these screenshots rn
---
You are welcome. 
---
*HYEAGH HYEAGH HYEAGH*
---
Yeah, no kidding. I am about 500 hours in on console and like 200 on pc. It's a pretty steep learning curve and can be frustrating but it's worth it if you enjoy the gameplay. 
---
Me either.
---
I propose every other female Killer becomes faster regardless of the consequences for balancing! /s
---
Yeah a notification could really help in Solo to know how many totems are still left.
---
I would love seeing trapper or billy wearing a tuxedo actually. Good idea for a skin
---
Well, maybe a slightly-below-average Joe but a Joe nonetheless.
---
It's not cool to be a dick online but neither is demonizing strangers based on 1 interaction with them.
---
Gotta live bubba's basement if you know what I mean 
---
Btw I am on 120 hours and leveling up for bbq is a pain in the ass 
---
best piece of advice and one few offer.  Best compromise between the other 2 perks and, like you said, its the only one that works on yourself. win!
---
I don’t get the issue with that person tracing the official huntress art. That’s something every beginner artist does while they’re learning. The user was proud that while traced, the piece came out decent enough that they were confident enough to share it on a sub that isn’t the most positive.
---
Yesterday, I had one of those ultra-sneaky-survivor moments, somehow!

I was Black Metal Jeff, as always. Not exactly a stealthy man, Jeff. All that huffing and puffing, big and easy to see - so I never really expect to hide well.
---
We were against a Trapper on the Suffocation Pit, and I hopped off the gen I had nearly finished as he was approaching and hid behind a rock. He kicked the gen, turned around to set a trap, and I decided to be a goofball and jump out to finish the gen as he was standing there next to it!
---
I finished it, then started running circles around the gen, rocks, trees, etc. right nearby and it was just a hoot! He couldn't find me for the life of him, and I was giggling like no tomorrow ;P I know how it is to be against a survivor who is sneaking around like that, so I feel for him, but it was a lot of fun to be on the other side of it this time!
---
I think I just got lucky/he got unlucky with where we both were moving. 
---
I ended up running away, still hysterical, and not long after I was able to cleanse NOED too! It was wild and really fun. I was just so shocked he couldn't find me - I wasn't expecting or trying to hide!! You could slap some Yakety Sax over that clip and it would work great!
---
It keeps the core of NOED but makes it more fait IMO. It's not an instant get out of jail free card for killers who messed up, but it's also not survivor sided IMO.
---
B-but... I thought rank didn't matter.
---
what about "the last year"?  is that DOA ?
---
Was he kicking her out through the hatch?
---
On the other hand, f13 does have actual single player mechanics built in (bots games, SP challenges kinda like hitman missions), so if your time IS limited, it may be a better choice.  Despite the players online struggle, joining a community of players will get you games.  I've seen quite a few MP games with similar or bigger lobbies and similar length matches survive on a couple hundred people. 
---
Another upcoming choice is hide or die, which isn't released yet, but iirc, buying in right now is pretty cheap.

---
Mm, fair. If it was to work without a hex, maybe go farther still then the OP's idea with the number of exposed hits you receive directly related to the number of totems left in game.  3 totems cleansed, 2 exposed hits. 4 totems cleansed, 1 exposed hit. Five totems cleansed, no exposed hit. 
---
Could cause some endgame chaos as no one is certain just how many exposed hits the killer has left. 
---
Of course after 1700 hours helping probably is some of the most fun I have
---
You dumbass kids use words like "salt" and "toxic"  like you don't even know what words mean.
---
Stay trash and brag about 1 noed kill after you got wreck for 5 gens.
---
Video isn't even good content. Wow you dribbled. So amazing.
---
The reason I dont like whispers is because I was unable to play killer without it. I started watching a few streamers who hate using it and then tried it and what do you know, I got better. 
---
The new spies from the shadows is apparently godly. Lmao. 
---
&gt; The degree of Gen Rush varies 
---
The term varies from person to person, I'm describing what I consider to be 'Gen Rush'.
---
Unless you're in a SWF who bring perks and items to do gens ASAP (and even then there are varying degrees), IMO you're just doing the objective as you're supposed to.
---
With how fast gens can get done you really do either need to build for a strong mid-game with generator perks or a strong end-game with gate perks or NOED.
---
The argument that NOED 'rewards you for losing' is weird to me since you can't always prevent people from working on gens and as far as I'm aware no one's actually won or lost until everyone has escaped or died. It's still probably not the most fun thing to go up against but I think that argument in particular is a bit silly.
---
EREDAR LORD OF THE BURNING LEGION
---
He thought it was impressive ad rushed here to show us, expecting praise or something.
---
I was thinking out of the game
---
Nah, that was just left 4 dead wearing a dbd skin and only having 1 underpowered special infected. 
---
All my buddies are over 1k hours and I'm here feeling like a babe even though I've owned the game for nearly a year xD
---
Holy shit. I’ve been grinding the 100 totems for what feels like forever. I’m literally up to 86. Oh well. Either way I’m still having a blast grinding out the achievements, even if they’re harder 
---
What's the difference? In the new spies of the shadow, I tired running it ,it really depends on the map if the map is small and there are crows at good locations then it's helpful but let's say if it's Myers house with no crows other than the corners then it's useless and the constant bugging of the notification pisses me off 
---
when the mixtape is so 🔥 everyone DCs, Frank did a great job 
---
I relate to this on a personal level
---
It's been sounding it's death rattle since about 2 weeks after release.  You're not wrong.  I do think, however, that it's never going to full die.  The hardcore f13 fans (and I mean franchise vs. Game) will keep it on life support pretty much forever. 
---
Basically.
---
I have two different builds that use either one of them. My unhook altruism build uses aftercare, we'll make it, we're gonna live forever, and botany knowledge. Plus a medkit. My regular altruism build uses empathy, autodidact, botany knowledge, and self care. So either perk has their uses, but it ultimately comes down to whether you want to be unhooking people constantly or healing people constantly. 
---
Blind, asthmatic, insane lady: 333% movement speed.
---
I'm sorry that you're physically unable to have fun man, I hope you get better soon
---
Freddy is great. Don't understand the hate.
---
Before it was *75* percent notification and never went off. At all. It was about the same tier level as that one Pig perk I cant remember the name of  
---
Now its 100 percent. Super annoying however it's great when you have nothing better for tracking. I think someone with more hours could probably manually track crows anyway but I definitely cant right now. 
---
The thing is i usually spend  A LOT  of time playing single player games. I want to explore some other online games with some of my friends. Some of them wanted dbd some wanted f13. I was so confused thats why i asked reddit. 
---
Havent heard of hide or die before.
---
Maybe you should just git gud scrub
---
thank God it doesn't, games against legion would be actual hell (as if they aren't already) 
---
At this point, updates are limited to bug fixes and balance.  There's a VERY slight chance that some almost-done assets could make it into the game (Uber Jason), but it's unlikely it will see any more brand new maps, Jason's, or Survivors. 
---
Yeah I've seen streamers paying attention to crows and I am like getting lost in the corn field while chasing a surviour lol
---
It's possible, i'm not sure about how the totems would interact with each other. The permanent speedboost is definitely something that could be explored. That's something that should be playtested to see how viable it is IMO. 
---
Man, you must want devotion related rewards more than *any* of us. 
---
One of my favorite Huntress moments was downing a Claudette through an entire cornfield on Coldwind with a hatchet. God, she must have been so salty. 
---
Louder for the people in the back.
---
Ok console peasant, only can't really take your comments serious ..., from a guy that call a player "stupid bitch" as he drops in a hatch. You seem just like another survivor cunt ;)
---
Have you seen Survivor hitboxes? I'm pretty sure it already does.
---
Thanks! I think a “glass cannon” style killer would work well (if he was ever added).
---
I love Left 4 Dead haha. Only game I miss from not having an Xbox anymore. 
---
Not powerful enough; I think every Survivor should also spawn Trapped in a Bear Trap.
---
Just to give Trapper the edge he needs.
---
They hated Jesus because he told the truth.
---
You disconnect from the match if they're using Frank's Mixtape?
---
In music, if you had done this...you would be getting sued. Or making pop music.
---
Mine was during a hatch escape ,I was following a Dwight and I downed him right before the hatch on the hill by a hatchet and then I hooked him right in front of it on the hill
---
Yum yum , he did say" shit killer and fck your mum"
---
But eh I can take the salt 
---
Okay.
---
On all my killers that I have only leveld to 50, none has the perks I prefer, let alone me trying out new builds. I think I leveld the doc to roughly 80 and I dont have hex ruin 3.
---
&gt;&gt;snuck up on deer
---
Dumbass deer should have heard that humming coming from a mile away.
---
Doesn't apply to snap out of it anymore, since it's not healing anymore.
---
If Resilience worked, Nurses, Sloppy, and Thana would also work.
---
Auf wiedersehen!
---
I disagree, especially about the handicapped part. There are plenty of perks that only work in very specific situations. That doesn't mean they can't be too strong or very unfun to play against. 
---
We clearly disagree on whether it's fine how it is or not. I don't think it is, it's too big of a safety net and this is how I would fix it. I think it keeps it's core strength but makes it actually manageable in Solo survive. I'm not saying it's perfect or the only way, but to me it seems reasonable!
---
I much prefer the ones who teabag me st rhe exit gate then I down them and hook them while their friends run out. So satisfying. 
---
Or hatch grabs. 
---
Apologies for the spelling. Mobile is ass. 
---
*Silver Lights plays*
---
My only problem with having 5 dull plus your hexes is what if you run 4 hex perks? So now we just have 9 totems on the map? Hell wouldn’t it be 10 with haunted grounds? Just seems ridiculous to have that many in one game.
---
Killer mains: "hit boxes arent broken" 
---
I bet this game dies out after this next patch. Ive already been seeing some of the bigger streamers shelve this game. 
---
Oh , that was what I was thinking! I should have put an ' and so on' after the 2 totems cleansed 4 exposed hits. Basically for every totem you cleanse, it reduces the tokens of noed. So if you cleanse all 5, they only get the movement speed but no exposed hits.
---
Probably Japan/Korea. If you look at the DBD section on twitch out of NA primetime there are a ton of korean streamers.
---
Unemployed gamers obviously.
---
Claudette's newest outfit. Spirit's wedding dress. Doctor's Victorian outfit. Kate's ice climber. Hag's leafy outfit. Plus a couple of pieces from random Adam and Kate skins with the extra. I think that's it? So $50.
---
Whenever I have a bit of extra cash that I'm not using I put it back in the game if there's a skin that interests me. Somewhere down the line I'll probably pick up Nurse's newest outfit, Jeff's heavy metal outfit, and one of the Legion skins. I usually use my iridescent shards for the shrine just to get extra bloodpoints. 
---
Bees. 
---
So you are not only salty survivor, console peasant you are also ignorant guy that comments blindly without even checking content out? See I may be killer camper cunt but at least I check to know what I am typing about....  
---
This video must trigger you HARD to make 5-6 comments on it...  
---
Btw [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJmoDCKSRPE) is "better" content you provide? T-bag use DS T-bag some more and run out of the gates really something to look up to! hahahaha
---
Theme builds can be fun!
---
Holy Priest survivor with a map and the beam of light addon, We’ll Make It/Botany Knowledge/Empathy. No Mither sabo god. Bamboozle/Fire Up/Play With Your Food/Brutal Strength Nurse. 
---
Maybe go for some achievements you don’t have yet. 
---
I thought he was hardware banned on PC? Dude must have gotten a whole new PC just to play then
---
It doesn’t in that it will still throw you up against people who are far outside your rank. 
---
Your comments always get a chuckle out of me. Your balance of idiot and genius is superb.
---
The thing about noob3 talking about hitboxes is that he doesnt show a single POV clip from a killers perspective, making it more blatant that its a connection/syncing issue rather than hitboxes
---
Not bad, though thirty seconds might be too short for the skill check effects. I don't know about others, but most times once I mess up a skill check to wake myself up, I move on so that Freddy doesn't know where I am. 
---
From someone who has 1.5k hours in F13 and recently switched to DBD. Don't get F13, here's why:
---
1. No ranking system (the DBD one sucks but it's at least better than no ranking system at all) this means a lvl 1 with 0.0 hours can go up against a lvl 150 with 5k hours and get destroyed.
---
2. The killer is a joke. Even with the recent buffs, you can bully/outrun Jason without any real consequences.
---
3. Playerbase is quite toxic. If you live in the EU, you will get paired up with Russian cheaters and teamers that will ruin your experience.
---
4. The game is \*almost\* dead. 400-500 players seems to be the max. Finding lobbies isn't difficult but you will be playing against the same players a lot
---
5. The devs don't care. They even admitted to not playing their own game on stream. They introduce stupid bugs that any half competent QA team could have spotted.
---
6. No more content updates ever.
---
DBD isn't perfect. The community is toxic and the ranking system somewhat sucks (you will be mostly safe from being matched up with deranking players until you reach rank 15). It also has a fair amount of bugs that make you want to throw your pc against the wall. Despite these issues the game is still extremely fun.
---
At least for me, DBD was difficult to get into coming from F13 because the killer is an actual threat. That's why I stopped playing almost immediately after I bought it a year ago. I decided to come back to it and push through and now I'm 200 hours in and have been to rank 1 as survivor.
---
If you decide to get DBD, Just ignore all the toxic people and have fun! If you have any friends to play the game with then that will help you get started.
---
Do you guys know why he was banned this many times? I know about his initial ban, but I’m kinda out of the loop on his other bans.
---
Have you ever watched the original texas chainsaw massacre ? Insidious Camping bubba is canon to his character. 
---
After the initial it's all ban evasion 
---
If its Nazi propaganda as a joke, then the post is anti-Nazi because the joke is making fun of a piece of Nazi propaganda.
---
The funny idea here is that in a normal society, Nazism isn't accepted, so having a sudden, offensive, abnormal post of Jews getting gassed is unexpected and thus funny.
---
If you get DS’ed because all you want to do is pick up every survivor the second you down them instead of slugging, then that’s on you if you have a 5 gen chase and lose at the end anyway 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Well yeah I know it's perfectly balanced. As all things should be
---
You got the answer already, but in case you didn't know, his perks are on console though. They're just not teachable and can appear in any survivor bloodweb at any point.
---
As a killer your job is to prevent those gens from even getting completed.  If you bring in NOED you are literally gameplanning for failure in protecting your objectives.  It removes all sense of urgency from map pressure since you know I have that good old instadown on someone I can rely on at the end.  It's a mindless down man.  If you choose to camp at that point you're securing an additional kill guaranteed.  I'm not saying all gens done means free escape but rewarding killers for failing their objective is really weak and makes for weaker killers.  I didn't learn how to play efficiently until after I popped off those training wheels.  It forces you to make better decisions during the game.  
---
We should just merge hag and trapper so the traps can be teleported to well catching the waiting dead I mean survivors.
---
For the most part. Nothing against the player using it but honestly it’s just completely ridiculous that something so strong and unfun even exists in the game.
---
Every game has flaws, but compared to most nowadays it's not too bad.  From my experiences at least
---
Actually upon further review, I think the impending movie release dates have no bearing. Freddy hasn’t had a movie since 2010, Leatherface is based off of the 1974 original, and The Pig hasn’t appeared in a saw film since 2010. 
---
Looks amazing, props dude. I wish someone would draw her with her Valentines head 0.0
---
I'm sick of dealing with premades who are leagues above me in terms of rank, it's truly unfair and simply ruins the fun.
---
I love the Scandinavian memes, thank you
---
And the Bee meme. And the people reeeing at Legion meme. I don't see much harm in another dumb meme.  
---
I'll definitely start using "traced" as a meme. Hopefully it'll take off, if not, oh well.
---
How is that a massive waste? You are actively keeping pallets up for longer which allows the late game to still be playable from the survivors.
---
Lithe does help you in a chase. If you don’t find that a 3 second speed boost is a help I guess you think SB and BL are a waste of a slot as well?
---
In what world are you seeing killers running noed without ruin.  At least 80% of my matches against NOED killers are running ruin too.  And that handicap gets them at least one mindless down guaranteed if you're not up against swf.  That handicap results in the strongest possible buff to a killer so in the end that doesn't even matter.
---
Uwot
---
If you make NOED weaker or make it harder to activate or limit it's effect when it does, you might have given survivors less incentive to cleanse them instead of rush through generators. I'm not sure if having the ability to make NOED less effective is more of an incentive to cleanse totems than trying to prevent it from activating at all, like where we are now with the perk. 
---
It's really not a big deal. Gamers gonna game.
---
If you don't want to watch him, press "not interested" on his videos and they'll be removed from your feedso that you'll never see him.
---
Tier 1 myers.
---
Pretty much the same for everyone else.
---
New survivor: Veronica
---
Ehhh that's rng I've had great runs to 50 and shit runs to 50.  Luckily it's on your Doc ruin isn't even that important on him.
---
Theres a guy who draws the killers but he uses references and everyone is giving him shit about using references so now a group of people are going on art and shitposts saying "looks traced tbh"
---
You should know by now that this game only caters too killers, if killers are not getting 4K games then something is wronb
---
nope, not even then will it be fully alleviated - came back to the game after 7 months and hitboxes feel worse than ever. even on killers side (when I see that they're streaming) they get obnoxious hits, like [this one](https://streamable.com/zu95c) and I have a few more videos of that exact situation - the killer not even seeing someone on their screen yet still landing a hit.
---
Being at high ranks doesn't necessarily mean you are good at the game but you should be a quite experienced player. That huntress probably is new to the game and doesn't know how most things work.
---
Aka dwight closets?
---
Gate stalking Myers is the new meta
---
Of all the killers, Michael and Freddy are probably the most purely evil. Its a shame Freddy is such a joke in DBD because of how bad he is.
---
Least favorite Catalonian pedophile, by far
---
I'll main Legion if he gets this as a skin.
---
The last one is Myers with Noed.
---
So much for people deranking to avoid red rank players muhahaha
---
Thanks for taking time off your day to help me. Really appreciate it man ❤
---
Nah, I think it's good to shame him and all of his apologists when they go to bat for him here, he's had a pretty shitty influence on the game and player behavior. 
---
Most people just cleanse totems for points
---
Ha ha ha I can notice..., you are foaming around your mouth "just a little bit" and best thing is your crutch is going BYE BYE soon enough while "mine" stays unchanged! ;)  
---
No problem man, it's always nice seeing someone making shittier content then you (like your trash) and getting 0 traction with it..., from one poor "content creator" to another maybe check some of mine stuff out..., it get's at least some views!  
---
Tbag away kiddo and have fun being face camped while not having Douchebag Strike to escape! ;)
---
To be fair he is based off the new freddy anyways i could swear he didn't diddle kids in the original
---
*YEET*
---
...
---
**S N A P**
---
But you lot just come off as petty, killer main nerds trying to suck the fun out of it for others. 
---
Been playing since beta and my account got wiped once so I have played a ton
---
There is something off with matchmaking specifically today.
---
Currently I am rank 8 survivor and a couple times I've been matched up against killers rank 2 ~ 4 and killers rank 15 ~ 18. Solo queuing. 
---
Well hopefully I'm not coming off on petty to you, I just think that toxic pedophiles aren't great members of the community and it shouldn't be an issue to call that out, maybe we'll agree to disagree?
---
Oh man. You remember infinites then and all the bs back then. I've heard some horror stories, pardon the pun. 
---
Why does this [reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ6aVQxwerw) come to mind?  
---
Eat my sh\*@t.
---
No, that's just criticism. Constructive is when you follow-up with how it could be better. There was no follow-up.
---
**Camps menacingly**
---
what
---
Well, it used to be 90 seconds, way too op. Then I thought a whole minute, but it seemed too much. You need to recover from waking up. And with this, I didn’t want to punish people too heavily for waking up.
---
Okay thanks! 
---
I might try that Freddy joint ngl 
---
where my Sole Survivor gang at?
---
Imagine being rude for no reason
---
Pink perks were dismissed from Dead by Daylight after they lied about being beaten and dragged around with a bear trap by " mask wearing,Trap supporters." 
---
I'd kill for another NOED vs DS post at this point. 
---
Remive killer aim assist at least on pc
---
Meanwhile, streamers that can actually create quality, non-earrape content enjoy a life of not having to recreate accounts after bans
---
We'll Make It by a mile, it's a pretty good perk overall. You'll never get the Autodidact tokens unless the killer is doing a 3-gen strat or slugging like crazy.
---
LoOkS TrAcEd TbH
---
"Normally" should include: 
---
healing when injured,
---
being careful to not get caught,
---
 running away when the killer comes near.
---
If you are downed with 1 gen to go and everyone is alive, you will be shown 3 survivors doing 3 separate gens every few games. 
---
Gen rushing is: 
---
whole team does gens injured because they all have adren, or don't care
---
 repair right up to the point where the killer has to swat you off the gen,
---
finishing a gen while the killer is in attack cooldown right in front of them, 
---
using comms to say "My gen was almost done, it's at X location" and "I'll do the last gen, you guys either come to help me or stand by the gate"
---
Gens done in 4-5 minutes. With ruin up. 
---
At the end 2 gens were never touched, and they are in the farthest corners of the map. 
---
You don’t understand how bad it is to see a p3 bubba insidious camping. Thank the lord you can’t reach red/purple ranks with that method anymore.

---
IIRC when you hit the killer with DS now you get the Obsession status switched to you.   
---
So basically, any perks that relate to doing anything to the Obsession to increase your performance as killer now apply to you instead of whoever just happened to get it first. 
---
We'll make it or Botany Knowledge. Auto DIC DIC is situational and does not work on your self. I suggest Botany 
---
they definitely do lol
---
So what happens if multiple survivors have DS?
---
Just jumps from person to person, as I understand it. 
---
You could start by defining what you think is toxic, and showing me a clip of a full game that shows him being uniquely toxic in a way other popular streamers aren't. That's fair, no?
---
ez karma
---
Yeah it’s pretty annoying, like the Huntress 24m kill on console is 100(?) times &amp; I’m pretty sure it’s way less on PC.
---
Cool idea. What about hits that trigger Borrowed Time? Do they count as exposed hits as well or does counter only decrease when you down a survivor? 
---
 I remember seeing another idea though. It has nothing to do with NOED itself, but instead introduces ways to keep track of totems. You can have totem counter built into small game or even made baseline for example. Or you could have baseline notification for all survivors when a totem is destroyed.
---
And I'm curious about both options as kind of additional objective:
---
* Your version of NOED becomes baseline. 
---
* Survivors get totem counter baseline.
---
What do you think? 
---
altho speed is for balance reasons, not really for lore reasons
---
cuntress would basically always get you from around the corner with 115%
---
ummmmmmm this is traced.......
---
yeah...those terrible people who dc cause they dont have fun and left the other people in the game. Is it a fun game if you play a game with 1-3 survivors left cause they dont want to dc? There are always two sides. 
---
So how's Dying Light going to work?
---
For me the escaping all 4 is way easier but you need friends... gonna be last trophy I get. Somehow I got Nurse’s 3 times blink like a few minutes into the game with the one &amp; only perk that gave me 3 blinks. 😁
---
I'm still waiting for a survivor turned twisted by the entity killer. I think it'd be very interesting. 
---
I remember reading something about a cultist killer based on the idea that sounded interesting. 
---
I'm gonna start by saying, I'm a survivor main. Some of the things you said, I couldn't agree more. Other things, not so much, but here's my critical look.
---
First, neither survivor or killer are necessarily easy. Do I find survivor easier than killer? Hell yeah I do. Hitting rank 1 isn't hard, but I STRUGGLE to hit rank 1 killer (I know, I'm just bad at killer, I'll admit it), where as rank 1 survivor is pretty easy to hit. 
---
Second, you're absolutely right! Without survivors, we don't have a game, but the same goes for killers as well, and it's not a bad thing that they are getting a little bit of attention right now. For those veteran players, we remember a time when killers were horribly underpowered. For a long time, us "whiny survivor mains" got everything we wanted, including nerfs that ruined the viability of some killers for a time. I've said it once in other posts, and I'll say it again here: Dead by Daylight has never been more balanced than it is right now.
---
Third, and this one is the one I expect the most heavy resistance against. NOED and DS. First of all, I might be one of few survivor mains that actually thinks the DS nerf is a good idea. Why do I think this? I feel that, much like killers with NOED, survivors have become way too dependant on it. One perk shouldn't make or break your gameplay, and if it does, then, honestly, you need to get better at the game. I never really run DS, and I do just fine in my games. I gotta assume that means DS is not a perk that is NECESSARY the way so many survivors are making it sound. In comparison, I do still believe that NOED is a little bit strong. Sure, cleanse totems, right? For some people survivors, I guess that just isn't that simple (I don't know why, I've never had a problem with it, but that's beside the point). 
---
TL;DR: You've got every right to feel the way you do, but just understand a few key points. The DS nerf is NOT that game changing for survivors. Us surv mains can do just fine without it, I promise. The game has never been more balanced, despite that the devs are (finally) paying attention to what killers want. Lastly, survivor and killer are both difficult in their own ways. It's entirely up to you which one you find harder, and to tell someone else they are wrong for their opinion is asinine.
---
With that said, good luck and have fun out in the fog! 
---
I usually play around that time but I'm night shift so I'm just usually awake at that time
---
Nobody is having fun in that game anyway. Might as well end it faster.
---
If you're having fun getting frank's mixtaped/moonwalked then good for you, but from my experiences that's not the case for the majority of the playerbase.

As it stands, that Survivor should get the Altruism speed boost and will be the one who needs to die to nerf the rest of their team.

Sure let’s buff Immersed Claudette’s even more.

Bold of you to assume this wouldn’t make me Main her even more.

What happens if someone uses DS after Dying Light has been activated?
---
&gt;The salt is real folks.

You sure sound like it. This is some generic-ass bait you took and the fact you took the time to not only make a reddit post but write up context to call him salty says a lot about how you feel.
---
you aren't wrong
---
i can recognize that holocaust jokes are both morally wrong and funny
---
Oh no finsishing a gen when killer is in attack cooldown. TERRIBLE Oh wait no because that helps me pop adrenalin

I mean it does suck but at the same time I don’t mind it because it’s what helped me get better 
---
Maybe she’s born with it? 
---
All memes are dumb, it's ok to acept that.
---
Well here we go...
---
Luckily I did. I probably would have died like 5 seconds later. All 3 of us were surprised I got the hatch lol
---
But I enjoy toxicity.
---
Nurse cos shes so good and not that hard in the low ranks
---
How many times we gotta teach you this lesson, this is tracing.
---
He probably just went afk on it
---
Well most of the time I’m solo queuing so I guess it’s up to chance for someone to have it. I have gotten a few teammates that have had kindred and I do find it very helpful seeing the auras of the other survivors.
---
guess you could call me a soulless person for doing that
---
Oh you think it's intentionally like that? Boi so thicc I could only fit the head
---
Another one
---
My bad my bad, I should have known better. Have my upvotes then
---
By no means am i good at this game but like the same stuff happens to me when i play killer or survivor. It makes me not want to play anymore and the lack of communication from the devs to the player base really bothers me.
---
It was not swf

never thought i’d see the day of dbd memes crossing with soulless memes LMAO

If your only interaction with someone is them doing shit like this then yeah, it's safe to assume it's not the first time they've done shit like this. 
---
And from experience, these sorts of people who do shit like this usually DO have issues. Most mentally hinged people don't have a need to harass randoms on the internet. 
---

Oh my God yes

Legion?
---
Assisted Living Wraith: You use that add on that takes you out of invisibility when breaking a pallet or generator. That’s the **only** way that you’re allowed to decloak. You can become invisible at any point, but you have to rely on survivors to take you out of it.
---
Perks would be Bamboozle to force them into pallets, Brutal Strength to get rid of pallets, and Enduring because you’re gunna get smacked a lot.
---
I'd rather get into another game faster.
---
Yeah, the infinities, infinite sabo'd hooks, old Meta perks, slower killer animations, infinite noed, Moris didn't require an initial hook, yeah I played through all that stuff
---
Yeah it would be cool if we can all think of some sort of signal. I make my character wave their arms slightly up repeatedly to indicate that they can come get me and most of the time two people will come at the same time to get me, but other times they’ll just ignore me and keep doing gens. I’ve died on first hook a few times recently, I get crappy teammates very often. 
---
You should probably read the other comments. 🙄 
---
If you are a new player at low rank play doc and then thanks me later 
---
No Mither's fine. It's designed to be unviable and basically hard mode for survivors. It doesn't need changing.
---
 * This sub: We need stronger punishments for DCing, I shouldn't lose my items every time the killer bitches out of a match!
---
 * Also this sub: The killer is Legion/3 gen Doc/Huntress with IR hatchets/Nurse with NOED? Yeah I totally get DCing, fuck that dude
---
But presses dc button
---
NO! I will not stand for legion being associated with hotline Miami. 
---
DO NOT for any reason pick the nurse, she is so hard to play with when starting off, play with someone like the trapper, or the wraith. those two are failry simple to understand
---
&gt;I don't know where you get the idea that propaganda can't be funny. Example: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AntiJapanesePropagandaTakeDayOff.png
---
So you think that piece of propaganda is funny? What's your argument?
---
Some guy who has drew Clown, Leatherface, and Nurse. All of which, was traced from game art or pics of models in poses..
---
Did you find the avocados tho
---
Which killer has snowball potential besides a camping insidious Bubba?
---
&gt;Gassing a 3-man gen
---
Is that better? it's not a meta-thing meme in the first place 
---
Lol where is your proof that propaganda can't be funny? Hey bud, you might not think it is funny but it is not serious at all. The point being that there is no such restrictive definition of propaganda. 
---
I really wanted to do a full scene like this for today's, but I also didn't want to stray too far from the original format. So, this is the "full" post for today's.
---
No template for this bad boy (unless someone really wants it?)
---
Holy shit that's me
---
Tfw you get active camo
---
I’m certainly not proud to dc against them but when I load in and see two teammates instaleave and then find out the killer has franks, I just don’t see the reason in sticking around. 
---
P3 on Legion, I'm disgusted.
---
Dont worry I escaped right after I threw the pebble lol
---
Yup step in a trapper trap or get Billy sawed that's it (I think nurse came out then they fixed it but it's been a while since it hasn't so my memory is a little foggy no pun intended)
---
[Template for others who want to nerf Monstrous Shrine and similar OP perks](https://i.imgur.com/undefined.png)
---
Nurse, huntress, billy, hag, trapper, myers, spirit, pig if she gets a kill with RBT, leatherface. Basically anyone except wraith, legion, clown and freddy.
---
Man. I am so never complaining ever again. 😂
---
Tomorrow ?
---
Completely agree, and I'm like 99.9% sure all of these "hitbox" issues people are having are just lag and people not understanding how auto-swings work. I've been playing since late 2017 and I've never once felt like the hitboxes have changed, except on Huntress' hatchets, obviously.
---
So a new trade marked killer?
---
That's because they are mostly apathetic and get a kick out of following people menacingly. I guess it would be more like T1 Myers. He isn't slow because he isn't in better shape than a fat old clown, but because it's more scary. 
---
“Constructive criticism is the process of offering valid and well-reasoned opinions about the work of others,” 
---
It’s a basic definition but a definition nonetheless. 
---
SoonTM as Blizzard's soonTM? If so we fucked Bois.
---
After this she posted “Soon™️”
---
How do those killers "snowball" exactly? Genuinely curious.
---
I’m still lost as to why you posted this... because he tunneled? He’s denying the hatch. He’s free to escape via door... while tunneling isn’t fun it’s a bad choice by the killer so you can just Gen and move on. I don’t like people who sit and wait for the hatch but hey if they wanna tank their score who cares. I don’t get why people are upset when others don’t play how ~they~ want them to. Since he’s frenzying he’s doubling down on the Dwight aiming for the hatch, and since he’s still in game it shows that he was right? Let the man try and get his 4K his way. 
---
You're disgusting
---
can we get the old bt black/white screen instead 
---
That’s not entirely true. I often play matches without ever healing so if I were to run no mither with the buff that is at play I may gain something from it.
---
Side note, I wasn’t concerned with losing the item, because I’m about to prestige so I’m getting rid of good items anyways. I’d rather someone else get them than to see them go to waste either by me dying or me using it just to use it. 
---
That's the sex build.
---
Slow then fast, then slow, and barely leaves a scratch. 
---
The play on words was the best part of it. Tyde with a knife and stuff just makes me uncomfortable. Forgive me lord for I have sinned.
---
^when ^you ^watermark ^a ^meme ^format ^off ^the ^internet
---
Wraith I'd say is probably the best starting killer. Simple power to use that doesn't rely on map knowledge; just sneak up on survivors, bing-bong then thwack.
---
No mither is actually not the worst when used in 4 man. Killer can't slug any of you and resilience is insta active.
---
And he should be able to immediately Mori Survivors while they're Trapped.
---
After all, The Shape can kill people with his power. Why should Trapper be left out?
---
My friend has watched me play a bit over the course of months and finally got the game for himself and in his first match as a killer this happened to him and not only that, they styled on him hard, flashlights, loops, teabagging, pointing, taunting, etc...I witnessed some of his first match and I totally understand why he has never played the game again since. Matchmaking is important if you want new players to continue playing the game.
---
Wow Bjork’s new album title has me shook 😳😤
---
With Ruin and Tombstone.
---
I’m afraid so... RIP
---
But I made the meme. The format is for everyone but this specific version is mine so I watermarked it
---
I posted this because I thought it was funny,  let me post on my reddit what I want too? K,  move along if you're not amused or confused. 🤷‍♀️ 
---
And ebony mori
---
Is it just me or does that PSN Avatar look like the character is just non stop nutting?
---
What? 
---
Propaganda is a term coined to describe media with the intention of spreading misleading or biased information as the truth to the public.
---
If I'm being lied and manipulated to, then that's generally not a joke to me. It's how soldiers got tricked to fight in both World Wars.
---
If something is inherently and intentionally deceptive, deceiving or fallacious, then it's generally a fairly serious issue with me.
---
The meme is based on propaganda, but it mocks propaganda. Its a meta joke.
---
Makes sense
---
I was referring to you using the format and watermarking it.
---
I respect people who create any sort of creative piece, but I get annoyed by people who watermark a meme format just because they added some of their own text to it.
---
Posting a p3 legion on this subreddit. That is not a great idea
---
Nah I’m gonna sit right here on this hatch and wait for you to move along Kay???
---
I’m not reading every comment. I’m just suggesting it at all cuz sometimes I’ll stay at the hatch just so they can find it quicker and go make a sandwich or something. Whether or not that’s what he is doing idk
---
I just want that annoying icon out of my screen
---
As he did,  right out the door. With no problem,  that's why the post was funny. 🙃 But whatevs.
---
draw your own then :)
---
Speedrunning Dead by Daylight, I see
---
That freddy thing is genius. They wont even know you have rancor cuz tou cant see the aura.
---
I must say, even though this particular meme makes fun of my Crispy Boi, I for one welcome our Hot Fuzz overlords.
---
Keep me coming, good fellows
---
&gt; Then the match before it, I was against a rank 13 killer matched up with ranks 8, 10 and 12. 
---
That is actually normal matchmaking.
---
The Spirit looks like a Twitch emote lol
---
He's not, he was just doing a frenzy and what not. Just prevent hatch to be a dick, it was funny but whatever. People are losing their minds over this post,  like for what? 😂😂😂 Stuff like this gets posted everyday,  esp about legion and everyone is having a melt down over MY post.
---
By slugging. All those killers have a high potential to quickly down multiple survivors if they were to make mistakes. Propably the best ones for snowballing are huntress, hag and nurse
---
You forgot the Doctor.
---
THERE'S NINE DOTS IT MUST MEAN THAT WE NEED TO WAIT NINE DAYS !!!!
---
Maybe if it wasn't the legion I would :)
---
Shut it!
---
It was a joke, btw people are downvoting him, R.I.P :(
---
O yea I don’t get that deep. It is what it is. Good on him for actually going to do gens. Most folks seem to think the hatch stand off is the only option
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Oof lol
---
And stop tbagging? Pfft! No way Jose. 
---
What do you mean by that?
---
I was actually talking to one of my friends in a party and he went afk but entered a game. He was pig and had noed. Survivors kept trolling and messing around him and he just downed all of them and put traps on all of them. He laughed like hell and even uploaded it
---

---
Good grief that video made me cringe.
---
His problem with Huntress was that she takes skill to be very dangerous.
---
He put Nurse at the top because skilled players absolutely clean house with her.
---
I felt like shouting at my screen, but I restrained myself.
---
Damn man, don't know why everyone is downvoting you so hard.
---
Gen rushing isn't toxic, pallet looping isn't toxic, it is mechanics in the game.
---
I'd think the effect would be locked in after it had happened. Keep in mind this is going to be a change on the PTR so odds are they'll tweak the mechanics of everything between then and live launch.
---
Hey there mate, you know we have a dbd community on ps4 with 60k+ members. 
---
That's a very nice play on words, ngl.
---
I think a simple fix would be giving the survivors a status letting them know NOED will activate if they don't cleanse totems, which could disappear once NOED can no longer spawn. Heck, I think it'd be fine to go as far as the status giving survivors a small dull totem aura reading radius to help out. As long as it gets survs to do the totems instead of just hoping killer doesn't have NOED.
---
Thought as much. LOL 
---
And another matchmaking post. We get it people.
---
Nope. He did gens, cleansed totems and searched chest lol. The guy 100% wouldn't leave the hatch. But his whole goal was to ruin that game,  which was unsuccessful because it was funny watching the dwight watch him. Kind of the punchline but everyone just got offended, probably because some of them do the same? Lol. I even said I'll defend hatch as killer too,  I'm just not kill hungry enough to stand on it for a half hour.

Unless you’re in a SWF I’d recommend WMI. It’s too challenging and rare to find any substantial use out of autodidact sadly.
---
&gt;Where do you get off even making up rules like that to win an argument?
---
It's not a made up rule - Jokes are not serious because they are fucking jokes.
---
Not even roast worthy. Just kinda hard to believe you took the time out of your day to type something based on a dead meme. 
---
Throw in Sabotage and Break Down and the Killer will need an Ebony Mori to kill anyone.
---
IIRC someone checked and there was only a noticeable increase to finding pink items with the other rarities mostly unaffected 
---
And all you'll have is a stock p3 level 1. It's probably another 2.5-3 million to get every perk unlocked 
---

---
I enjoy the concept of dealing with salt to drop the net total of it. Good on ya.
---
Best Adam, it was a pleasure!
---
Letting survivors know that the killer is running NOED would be a buff to the perk, and a nerf to every other killer not running NOED, since survivors won't cleanse totems anymore if they know for certain you don't have it. 
---
Frank has a letterman skin.

---
You are actually the hottest being in the multiverse.
---
Nobody likes clown what are you even talking about.
---
I'd say Wraith. Super simple power, the toughest thing is learning to bodyblock effectively. Good for learning basic mind-gaming too that you can apply to almost any other killer. Shout out to Leatherface (Cannibal) as well, he's a bit harder to get a hang of, but has BBQ &amp; Chili, arguably the best perk in the game.
---
🤤
---
Because the BP penalty for camping isn't a change that BHVR made or anything.
---
Camping is a strategy, a rather poor strategy, but still a strategy. It's up to your teammates to adapt to this information and punish the camper severely.
---
I'm not sure it needs balanced, it's meant to be a practically useless bragging rights perk.
---
But if you wanted to you could have it so that the player starts at full Health, but is instantly downed. After that point only Survivors can see that they're Broken. If the Killer is using any instant downs you could be Stealthy about your No Mither.
---
Usually I’m with all other rank 1’s (my rank). I was solo in that match, it’s very unusual for me. 
---
Guessing cause it's a crutch perk that gives bad killers a second chance for not applying enough pressure during the game. Just how ds is a crutch perk for people that go down 4 minutes into a game 
---
They uncloak
---
then stop complaining :)
---
🖤 
---
Me: "Ah fuck, I gotta take my Lantus/grab me a juicebox"
---
\&gt;comes back and all the survivors are examining me like an archaeological find
---
Now you are exaggerating. 
---
Looks like a typical anime thot.
---
Thank you for the comment. I am assuming you meant Enduring, if so, it depends on what level both perks are. For example, if Overdose is level II and Enduring is level I, the killer would be stunned 25% longer instead of 50% longer without Enduring and Enduring won’t be as powerful. Again thank you for the comment,  
---
complete with anime avatar
---
I actually love the wraiths stun noise. Rather than just being in pain, it also sounds like he’s super pissed off. 
---
Or you can do your own research and check the code for yourself. 
---
This is why I don't intentionally BM. I know how shit it feels when I get BMed so I don't do it to others.

---

---
Yes, and sadly they can't do anything about Huntress' hatchets. They tried lowering their hitbox back in May, but it resulted on hatchets magically flying through survivors and other crazy shit causing them to revert it.
---
Bing *bjöng*
---
Well I guess do totems or suffer from noed.  Even if noed activates there are two exit gates..  even a hatch if you're the last one.  No one should bank on being safe when the exits open. Hide out/wait for the killer to leave an exit. Try to escape. Loop. Avoid the hit. The perk doesn't need a change when it can be countered so easily. 
---
I mean, you'd think the killers would know the survivors are using those perks already, considering they zoom away at the speed of light....
---
You don't have to be on the sub all day to look at posts.
---
I have P3 lv50 Quentin, Claudette, Ace, Dwight Billy and Myers and tbh id say its not worth it unless you really want bloody cosmetisc.
---
16-20 - actual, true, new players. rank matters very much here.
---
13-16 probably just bad, but they know what the game is about. Not new. Rank matters significantly less.  
---
1-13 rank does not matter. this is purely based on how much the person plays at this point. 
---
The disarm time would have to be extremely, *extremely* long for that to mean anything. It's not risky at all. There's literally no downside to disarming traps ever and simply extending it is meaningless.
---
And no it's not insane. It's completely sensible. It's similar to what Legion's power is supposed to do, but not broken.
---
Are people upvoting my OP unironically or something? I thought it was obvious that I'm mocking people. 
---
Jävla smörgåstårta!
---
It doesnt mattet to them cause when they want to try theyll hop on their 5 blink nurse with an ebony mori because that makes them feel like theyre actually ok at the game. Delusional players tends to stay doing things that usually let them win or anger other people because having to actually use more than 1IQ is too straining for their undeveloped brains.
---
Rank 10-1 doesn't matter. Rank 20-15 definitely does (in that you have to be new or have not played the game in 1-2 months to be there)
---
The userbase isn't big enough
---
Yah but doesn’t it look like a certain thing or object on the picture they have showing it??? 
---
🤷🏻‍♂️😂
---
Oooohh, I like that. Name checks out.
---
Dang, that’s insane. I really wish there was some consistency across all platforms 
---
Huntress probably. 
---
This is confirmation bias but I think Myers mains are tryhard's and that would be my second pick.
---
I think this isn't a bad concept. My only problem is the usual:
---
DS and NOED do not compare. NOED can be a killer's chance to secure a last minute kill and therefore not depip. DS is a get out of jail free card that adds insult to injury and should *not* get you out of the shit play you made to be caught in the first place. 
---
Is it really already dead? I thought it was still getting more people playing.
---
I like DamnNoHtml videos. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ) is one about different wall types and [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UoymuGcBzY) one for beginners. Both have helped me. I wish you the best!
---
Honestly buddy. I’m not a coder and I hardly understand the intricacies of code outside of a meme where one of “{“ are wholly responsible for the downfall of man. I’m not gonna pretend I understand coding and if you do, fucking apply to BHVR to fix the code. Outside of that the coders probably have a fucking hell of a time dealing with some of the absolute spaghetti In their game. 
---
Shit I come from years of League of Legends and even a big company sometimes can’t tweak something without it fucking exploding twenty new bugs. So really to say “it’s not new” is kind of a demeaning statement to the people who understand coding and are frustrated and you probably don’t know Jack shit about it (I’m assuming) and are like “oh what’s the deal here? Why game not work?” 
---
I think this is funny! People get so worked up. Get over it and move on lol 
---
But what if they don't even have NOED? That's just a waste of my time
---
I DC every time a see a fellow survivor 
---
Oh I do too. I have like... uh... *had* 20 or so but used them all. 
---
I just also know the pain as a Survivor.

Yup and then he can improve and then destroy this guys like people like me :D

The build is an insult to survivors and to killers. It completely negates all knowledge and skill on both sides, is incredibly unfun, and has no true counterplay. You're really not playing DBD at that point - the set up is game breaking.   
---
It's honestly the same with some Nurse players, which is infuriating, but the redeeming factor is that the Nurse at least takes skill....
---
No sweat needed, you win matches to fast. Lol Beautiful drawing. 
---
Didnt they lower it from 100 to 20 like a month ago? Many of us wrestled through 100 of those bitches, we will never forget.
---
I haven't played against him much as a survivor. Surprisingly, it's mostly Myers, Doc, and Huntress. So I've never felt that pain, just the coxcombed Clapper. If that ain't the most annoying thing.
---
Yes,but the guy was aware of this and kept blinding/tbagging me and he just went afk
---
I would recomend trapper as start. Pretty straightfoward killer. The doctor is great but you need to find what build most suits you and need to learn proper timing with the shock but it isn't as hard as it sounds. The hillbilly is also amazing but, please, for the love of god bind the turning keys to Q and E. Hillbilly is unplayable without that little trick.

Imagine maining Bubba and camping, when you can be bing bong boi and not attack anyone, just hit your bell.
---
Thats just an asshole move then. Sorry he held the game hostage for you. I hope you reported him.
---
DS and noed do not compare. DS can be a survivors chance to secure a last minute escape and therefore not depip. NOED is a get out of ail free card that adds insult to injury and should NOT get you out of the shit play you made to have 0 kills to begin with.
---
See what I did there? Insert James Franco, same but different but still same GIF.
---
Eventually a killer with some form of firearm is going to happen. Like a cane with a gun in it lol
---
Wow, and this was on PC too. I've never seen this happen.
---
What does the writing mean?
---
As a Huntress main, I weirdly really enjoy playing against Huntress so I learn other tips. 
---
Man, there are some *evil* frigging killers out there...
---
If Coxcombed Clapper is the one that makes the noise across the entire map, that is what I was referring to.
---
I say it is worth it for killers. Idk for survivors.
---
Just faced one with no skill at all just slugging people and waiting for the mend timer to run out. 
---
It's very sad because that's LEGION, it gets automatically disliked by this community. Just showing 32k, BuT BRo, iT's LegIoN sO TrASh xdDDdd
---
onryō which means vengeful spirit got it off Wikipedia 
---
Nah, the one that makes the noise all over the map is Bone Clapper. Coxcombed Clapper is completely silent. 
---
To be honest I love your name. Love me some Rick and Morty.  Anyways- it's a risk. Either do it or don't.  😂
---
Thanks for being a good sport. 
---
Then don't have killers tunnel, facecamp, M1 on hook?  
---
Not happening?   I don't see that happening either.  
---
Its the bee
---
&gt; But BHVR says this is fine.
---
Yes they could be doing a lot better, but find me some sources where they actually say this because this paragraph does not read like a joke. You seem to genuinely believe this.
---
Ok. Cool
---
Children will be children.
---
Because you're incredibly uninformed and keep spreading a false narrative which helps no one. Basically, you're just spreading around bullshit either out of ignorance or you're willfully spreading bullshit because you use mental gymnastics to justify that DS is fair. 
---
Why are you bragging for purposely crippling yourself by playing freddy
---
I've never gotten a 32k before but I've gotten a 31.2k. So close!
---
Obviously the bee. Smh
---
2/10? Damn, when I first saw it, I had a good chuckle. I think its like 7/10.
---
I think humour is a thing that will keep changing with society. Sometimes I worry when I have kids that I will feel out of touch and wont understand them at all.
---
What I'm trying to say is - the OP's post is clearly a joke. Someone looking at it won't turn into a nazi. It was a meme, 5/10, made me exhale suddenly.
---
Man that sucks.
---
They dont do it with a PS4 controller they do it with mouse and keyboard on a PS4 by connecting it to the PS4
---
Oh shit thanks for telling me
---
A friend of mine do it with a normal ps4 controller 
---
To test hitboxes and not internet connection, you need a survivor standing still (test it in KYF). Swing at him a few times and you’ll see that hitboxes are totally okay. Yeah, they are a little bit bigger than player mesh, but not that much of a problem.
---
I don’t think it’s a big deal because I don’t use DS I’m not too good a skill checks, but i am kind of getting tired of nerfs only too survivors 
---
Brad....
---
Then why dont u ask him
---
Ahhhhhh.
---
I did but he cant explain how to do it 
---
Yah I had a Meg a few weeks ago do the exact same thing on this map, I was playing Myers, she ran out until falling off the map and figured oh well she will dc if she gets stuck in limbo. Well I went walking around the map to finish kicking gens and breaking pallets for the extra points and it’s been probably 5-8mins. Then Meg pops out the corner like howdy doody and runs up to me and then runs to a hook and points at it. I message the player real quick (PS4) and tell her to run out the main gate and be free, she messages back saying she has gone out both gates and it won’t let her leave and wants to be hooked. So I said try it 1 more time and if not I will hook you so we can end the match, we make it to the exit gate and it finally works! 
---
just run iron maiden tho
---
Lack of bing bong is hilarious but scary as shit on the receiving end. 
---
We need Brenda as a survivor. Someone created a Paragraph for her and it looks really cool!
---
Also, I feel your pain.
---
Unless with a converter i dont thinl its possible to hook up a keyboard and it to work (ive tried it) but idk it could be possible i just dont know
---
Gimme yo shaaaaaaards
---
Listen the player base isn't big enough. Either we get this or wait 30 mins for a match
---
I have been ***sobbing*** with laughter for ten fucking minutes holy shit
---
what kind of phobia it is
---
I love this, it looks great! Can i ask how did you achieve that 3dish blurry effect? I don't know how to better explain it, are there a blue and red layer on top?
---
No question is mandatory, so you can just answer the against ones.
---
Possible, but 2 games after it was all red ranks, and then the same mix of different ranks. I don’t mind but I feel bad when it’s lower ranks against a red rank killer or when I’m against a rank 20 killer which is definitely not right. The games are coming really fast, too. 
---
I never played a game where hitboxes were such a poorly made design.
---
I don't ask for much, Mr. BHVR, but I must ask for this
---
Where you using Frank's mix tape?
---
Hold your horses, the teaser will come before the TPB amd I've seen no sign of it yet.
---
Just connect ur mouse and keyboard to the place where you would normally put ur charger
---
You’re using unrelenting so it couldn’t have been too bad 
---
If you are old enough to kill you are old enough to read. 
---
Amazing cosplay. You'd spook me irl that's for sure.
---
Does that actually work? 
---
F13 in a nutshell
---
Thank you, I hope so haha.
---
That's my job.
---
Went 6 hours straight without talking, drinking or taking the mask off. 
---
Ive done that it just doesnt work. Idk i might have to fuck with he setting but idk. Ill test it again later tonight. You may be right
---
Two brown add-ons. Irregardless it's legion so....
---
Check the subreddit
---
"POGGERS" WeirdChamp
---
Well idk haven't played since clown update
---
It's a bit more complicated than that (for some games) but yes it works
---
asserting dominance
---
Eh Killers get free kills all the time,  by camping someone till they die. Plus it's not a free escape,  you have to do the required amount of gens to open it. So? 
---
Thank you! Sure, it's actually really simple. In Photoshop, duplicate the layer with the artwork on it and put it on top of the original-&gt; Layer Style -&gt; Switch off R Channel (or any of the other channels, you can experiment with them)-&gt; Then just move the top layer a bit, so the effect becomes visible. I hope that made sense, english isn't my first language. Otherwise, if you look for glitch effect on youtube, there should be some tutorials.
---
Only had one DC when I played Legion for a daily. 
---
yikes a bad meme, modernized
---
Today's been an odd one, i've gotten similar lobbies playing both sides.
---
The DS change was good and needed. 
---
Oh man, *that's* dedication. You have my respect.

This one is pretty cool

WOAH DUDE DO YOU USE THAT KEYBOARD TO YALK WITH YOUR MOM

BBQ and Nurse's Calling
---
Kate: You took the only kitchen kni-
---
wont make the game any less stale
---
YALKING IS WHAT I LIKE TO DO YES
---
Best bbq play I’ve had was on farm. Playing doc and only one gen done. Put girl number 3 on death hook and notice Nea trying to finish a second gen across the map. Walk over in treatment. No screams. Notice locker right behind the gen and no scratch marks. Here’s Johnny!!! I would’ve let her go but I needed that sweet 25% bp.
---
[**Smol Oink**](https://imgur.com/8sMyYUM)
---
This game is trash asf I’m not surprised it’s dying the only reason I play it sometimes now is bc there’s nothing else to play
---
What killer was it?
---
Noob3 is quitting? 
---
When NOED activates it heals all injured or dying survivors fully and gives them invincibility for 2 minutes with 200% max base speed.  
---
The killer must find the hex totem and spend 1 minute cleansing it to get rid of the totem. 
---
Not a selectable perk, comes default with all killers while still taking up the perk slot. 
---
No u
---
So your justification for bullying killers that can't catch you is because sometimes the ones that do are assholes?
---
You must be a fun person.
---
Just saying. It's a good thing. Like, we know dedicated servers are coming, which is something in your post. Rank rewards would be nice tho
---
It was Billy and Trapper. 
---
yea his recent video hes said hes reached his breaking point
---
#1
---
A majority of Survivor Mains keep saying the same bullshit over and over and over: "Oh, Enduring counters DS git gud!" Or "Oh, Unnerving Presence counters DS git gud XD!"  And especially "Uh, we need DS because uhm it's fair and Killers committing to 4 chases is fine."
---
It is a false narrative because it is insanely rampant among Survivor twats. They think if they just keep repeating the bullshit that eventually people will believe it. At any rate, the whole debate is mute because the cancer perk will get nerfed in 2 weeks time so you can fuck off. 
---
Well I won't agree or disagree with what you're saying. I will say that if the population does go down an "x amount" (not sure how far down it would have to go) the devs will surely start doing things to bring players back. 
---
This exactly 
---
i mean to some extent the whole game for survivors is literally hold m1 simulator and run around a pallet simulator
---
Wooo 2 gens. My team gets that done before the first chase ends every match. Camping someone till they die? Sure if they wanna forfeit the match to us. It’s still not the same thing. 
---
you realize that in the clip itself the killer is the host and that switching it to KYF would change absolutely nothing, correct? and that this same exact hit under the same scenarios would have happened, yes?
---
To be honest, I'm not familiar with how borrowed time works exactly because I never run it and barely come across others who use it on ps4. I know it puts you in bleed out but don't know the specifics. So i'm not going to be able to give an in-depth answer to that part of the question. As a rule of thumb though, It would work like any other exposed hit, I suppose (:
---
As for your proposal, I think that might make Killers too strong? As it basically open up a new perk slot while also having NOED as a basic game mechanic, if I understand your proposal correctly. IMO it would be doable, not ideal but doable, with the totem counter added and reducing time on something else, as this would become an actual second goal survivors HAVE to hit. I'm not sure though, it might be possible but like I said, then some of the previous nerfs to survivors to slow down the game should be reexamind. 
---
That video is garbage. It acts like survivors are these oppressed players
---
You keep bringing awesome content to this meme generated subreddit which I always appreciate
---
Dead Hard has an animation because before, it was basically impossible to tell if it was Dead Hard, lag, or the killer just missing as to why they didn't hit the survivor. Now there's an animation to make Dead Hard usage clear. Other exhaustion perks don't have that confusion, and like I said, they already show themselves through their speed.
---
he isnt wrong about a lot of things
---
Flashlight works because killers dont know the counter. But a decent one will just look up instantly if you are facing them, and will only start pickup animation while facing a wall. Making it impossible to flashlight. Also, when 2 or more survivor brings flashlight, you often meet a Franklin’s Demise in higher ranks, since they have often spent more BP in the game.
---
But pig doesn't have a terror radius while crouching, so why use m&amp;a?

Good beevening.

well he was toxic enough to get himself and op banned on psn so you’d assume somethings up with him
---
moonwalking with those perks and addons?
---
Why?
---
Guys kts candyfuckingman
---
Exactly, even with rank reset and being absolutely terrible, they'd probably be at rank 15.
---
Moonwalking works with no perks or add-ons. I'm not saying it's smart or efficient but people usually dc when Legions do this.
---
I didnwatchh that one i never remember him saying he is quitting. I remember him saying its not fun and he is burnt out which might as well be the same thing though. You may be right but idk i looked at the comment secttion and theres no crying about him quitting which ik there would be. Either way i agree with your point i loved this game but now i play a couple of games and its just not as fun idk if it bc of how broken the game is or that i have just done everything worth doing 
---
In my opinion, it would be a bigger incentive but I can not back this up with any hard data or facts ofcourse. It's something that should be tested, but as far as anecdotal evidence goes, I know I would cleanse more dull totems because every totem counts, while right now only the last one actually matters if that makes sense (:
---
&gt;Moonwalking works with no perks or add-ons. I'm not saying it's smart or efficient but people usually dc when Legions do this.
---
Stab twice then moonwalk that's like a 30-45 second down. Plenty of legit chases last longer than that
---
Ok armchair psychologist
---
Thanks!
---
Unbreakable also doesn’t massively nerf you for the entire match. You can’t get yourself up forever, you will bleed out after only a handful of pickups which really shouldn’t even be allowed to happen as the killer should catch on and or just simply ya know, not slug the survivor for 3 minutes straight.
---
Hard enough to where they’re working on it and not you.
---
I just buy the DLCs. Also, you get them with Iridescent Shards, not Auric Cells. Auric Cells are just for specific cosmetics.
---
4 punishable things all together. First, a softban of abuse of game exploits and showing them to his audience. Followed by some Witch-hunting during his streams and after videos. Save file editing. And a cherry on top of Ban-Evasion on console and now PC
---
Because killer is balls 
---
I mean if you can’t control your anger I suppose that’s one thing. 
---
Nice, honestly this post was supposed to be funny, but apparently a fucking stick figure is worth more worthless internet points.
---
&gt;To be honest, I'm not familiar with how borrowed time works exactly
---
It trumps any killer insta downs, that's what matters. So even with NOED active, there will still be bleedout timer instead of down. But let's say I have 4 NOED hits and I strike a survivor with BT. He does not go down because of BT. Should this action consume one NOED hit or should I still have 4?
---
&gt;some of the previous nerfs to survivors to slow down the game should be reexamind.
---
Yeah, I agree with you on this. If devs take this whole second objective idea seriously, they'll have to rebalance gen times and probably healing. 
---
I feel your pain, I play with my susie and imagine how many salt messages I get for just playing legion, I wish I could play with you sometime (as I'm on xbox as well). But don't let it get to you, I don't even touch the nurse, to hard for me, and she's not my playstyle. I like salt messages, so I run legion with noed, sloppy, rancor  (easy mori) and discordance, hell people have blocked me before and there's this one kid I see and everytime he joins my lobby I whip out that juicy mori
---
Huh. Yeah just those two were buggy for me. Played 3 more matches afterward. Legion, nurse and wraith were fine.
---
resilience does work on snap out of it.... it's not just a healing action perk.
---
Killer main with a gate opening daily lol. 
---
Idk what you mean. I'm a killer main and don't really see many problems. 
---
Haha thanks! I wish they would see this and give some feedback, even though it's just an imaginairy concept. That would be pretty dope (:
---
Mind game the loop with the times that you're invisible and bait the survivor when you are visible during the transition. Also Dresses exist.
---
I play on console (ps4 though) and I tried nurse for awhile and I think she just to hard to be really good with on console. When I survive I’ve ran into 1 or 2 who can pull it off but most can’t. I switched to spirit and run MYC, nurses calling, stridor, and MaA. The builds awesome and you crush SWFs especially. I get wanting to learn her but as far as I’m concerned nurse perks on spirit is the console nurse lol
---
They just don't fix any of their updates when they break the game :p
---
It’s similar to spirit but this is what I was expecting from Legion, some kind of dual killer system where we could switch around the map to a different killer. That’s a great concept I’m a big fan of those perks too
---
This happened to Zubat I think
---
lmfao stfu it doesnt take a 15 year master programmer to make ranked rewards and fix hitboxes
---
I'm still learning Nurse. Last game I played I got 0 kills, but one of the survivors said,"That was fucking sad, Nurse" clearly implying that I suck.
---
It’s okay. I got stomped early on by swf while practicing nurse. Just send them a gg or hide the post game chat and keep on practicing. It won’t be long before you get the hang of those blinks and start murdering those cocky swfs :-)
---
You should try seppuku
---
Seriously how you do the moonwalk?!
---
Bro your perfectly fine. Don't let them get to you! You bought the game. If you want to use NOED on every killer build, camp, tunnel, play stealth, for fun, etc it all boils down to you, man.  You paid for the content and just enjoy yourself! Unpopular opinion but seriously play the game to your style.  As a survivor you have one job basically... survive. Killer. Kill everyone.. or most lol.  That's really it! Keep practicing nurse and wreck it for me! 
---
Hey, it happened before with save the best for last!
---
Several times, actually. I just have to be really careful. I'm a pretty stealthy player but it's always clutch. My favorite is where a Trapper slugged me and two other players when the exit gate was open, I managed to recover and rescue my teammate, but one was killed and the other d/ced; So the escapees was the other person and myself.
---
I got a 4 k (well all 4 were down, I gave 3 the door and let them slug race out) with a black splinter (offering that lets you play a dlc killer with no perks or add ons) at rank 10 (high for me) and it was fun as hell
---
I especially like playing Michael with the Scratched Mirror. Jumpscaring survivors is the best!
---
Anything you do as a killer is considered toxic.
---
Nobody likes legion .
---
It is part of the dark land... It is a segment of reality that transcends both time (tyme) and space.
---
It's a place where you can say that Hag is D tier. Also a place where you can get good information about how individual killers work.
---
I find Dead By Daylight is really prone to people who have Superiority Complex/Control and Power issues in their life. The ability of basically being able to pick 1-2 people to face camp and ruin their fun and experience is almost like a drug to these people.
---
It’s rare to run into, but sometimes you’ll face a Killer who will tunnel **only** you, and make sure *you* are first/only to die, and then blindly insult and pester you as if *they* won. It’s really pathetic.
---
This is why a lot of veteran players think that certain things are silly like noed being nerfed back in the day it was a perk that activated on last gen and was indefinite and non destroyable and you could get smacked down and mori'd
---
100% gotcha now. Thank you for taking the time to educate me
---
They fit the group theme well and are the coolest characters. But they aren't really serial killers as much as fucked up "vigilantes".
---
Hotline Miami does have a slasher though.
---
Pig Butcher. Which might be too similar to Amanda but hey we have 2 chainsaw rednecks.
---
&gt;!Pardo also fits the bill!&lt;
---
Real question is who'd be the survivor?
---
He is fictional.... But yeah, your not wrong
---
This isn't even true anymore. When they buffed her crouch speed they also increased her radius to 32 to put it in line with the other 115% movement speed killers.
---
It was all at different times and only in chases
---
I’m aware that the devs made it as a hard mode for survivors, back when infinite’s still existed and the game was a free win for survivors without it. In the current dbd there is no need for a perk to be so bad that people don’t even consider or count it when making lists about the worst perks. 
---
Then you got four ppl that hate legion. Frankly get used to it. 
---
Ur talking to me about confirmation bias? Lmfao ur assuming they are having trouble with dedicated servers when they can literally just not wanting to be doing it at the moment or dont want to spend the money, stfu kid
---
I haven't played in a couple months, decided to get on, I'm a killer main, but thought, hey! Let's play a survivor game! 1 minute into the game i'm on the hook with leatherface staring me down. Didn't loop, didn't teabag, no prestige even lol. I get unhooked by noob teammate, downs us both, continues camping, gets a 4k (was in low ranks) 
---
Postgame chat, leatherface: ez
---
And this is why I'd rather play other games lol
---
Witch hunting is basically getting a bunch of people to attack a person on the internet, things such as harrassment, or report spamming to get the banned.
---
Hmm okay. Was going to level the licensed killers first before the og's. 
---
Hmm good question but it would be so interesting to see for example biker as a killer 
---
Thanks. lol
---
It really isn’t that close. The best Nurse will always do better than the best Huntress. There are certain loops that Huntress cannot easily deal with even when using hatchets. Nurse does not have the problem. Huntress also has a harder time pressuring generators that are far off, while nurse can more easily do so. Huntress main problem is that certain maps can screw her pretty hard while nurse can more or less perform the same on any map.
---
Console is stuck with 100 hatchets throws. Steam got the 20.
---
Borrowed Time used to just turn your whole screen black and white instantly with no fading and no blood. Deep Wounds grew from Borrowed Time, and they apparently wanted it to be less jarring but feel more "urgent", so they added a gradual color fade and the blood splatters. 
---
Oh Jesus Christ I absolutely forgot about that, I'm beyond stupid
---
Yoo this is legit amazing!! You’re very talented 😍😍
---
The devs made it to be hard mode for a reason, so... not sure what your point is. Don't like it, don't use it. It's a challenge for people who want to use it. 
---
I'm talking about the perk itself, regardless of what the killer does. 
---
I wasn't saying Nurse is worse than Huntress, or comparing their skillcaps, just pointing out that Tyde cherry picks his reasons for why Killers belong where he put them (Nurse is good in his video for the same reason he doesn't find Huntress good) and it bugged me.
---
I now see I wasted my time talking to you. Bye
---
We all go down hill eventually.
---
I was wrong, last patch she got her TR increased to 32 m, M&amp;A no longer interesting on Pig
---
*"Alright lad,* _**THIS**_ *is your knife, try not to lose it we only have 4."*
---
Now im rank 12 killer and im too shit for all these rank 8 and rank 10 survivors looping me and stunning me
---
Ok. It's amazing on Michael, though.
---
About as often as the usual Steam sale. Not sure about the consoles if you're unfortunate enough to be on console. 
---
If you mainly use Killer than sure, bure with auric cells to save a few bucks. On the plus side you don't get Survivor dailies for the Survivors you unlocked if you bought the DLC pack. 
---
Yeah, no TR on T1. Add a Dead Rabbit and you get minimum TR on T2.
---
good thanks for showing me i won the argument
---
Every few months at the most.
---
You make a pretty good point. I suppose I didn't quite have all things considered just yet.  
---
I would still definitely place Huntress on at least the A tier, though, simply because if you do take the time to master her, it's like landing all four corners in a game of Othello, and it feels *gooood*.
---
I am now waiting for a trapper throwing traps meme. (I am picturing a trap being thrown and snaps on the head, then instantly the survivor is upside down struggling with the trap as if it were on the foot as normal. Because we all know if this was implemented it would happen like that. )
---
They hid healed and got hatch, I'm not going to be an ahole and camp it.
---
Trying to get those juicy blood points 
---
a hit like this would have not connected around a year ago, which is exactly my point and why I brought up the video. I have encountered this more in the past week than I have in my previous 2.5+ years of DBD, and its especially noticeable when I play nurse - hitting people who arent even on my screen, or """show for 2 frames""" (lol). its ridiculous and not fun to play against - hitboxes are broken, and thats pretty much a fact. just look at [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/SavageLittleKimchiJKanStyle), its also from another killer POV btw.
---
What if Freddy was actually Susie?
---
They made the perk hard mode due to how overwhelmingly powerful survivors use to be. I do believe I said that in the last reply, perhaps you missed it? 
---
If you want to talk about how perks work you need to think about all situations and what the most typical occurrences are. If you don’t consider what the killer does, most perks become irrelevant. 
---
What I'd like to know is how the fuck you suddenly appear in a 3 day old thread in a sub where's tons of new posts along with a flood of shitposts. 
---
So, how in the fuck did you manage to see a thread that had one upvote that got posted 3 days ago and you happened to see this autistic conversation? It's pretty obvious that either (A) you're this guy's alt or perhaps his butt-buddy or (B) you're insanely anal retentive and have no life outside of the computer and have to check every thread every hour. I'm leaning towards A. 
---
&gt; Billy is easily looped with little mindgame potential. I'd place him in A tier.
---
Instadown+Super sprint. He has ridiculous map pressure so he doesn't need to be god tier in chases. S tier.
---
&gt;A tier- Myers? he has no loop potential and has limited instakill potential. not to mention how awful it can be to get out of Tier 1 against survivors that understand how to fight a Myers. B tier
---
He has stealth in tier 1, a lil bit of stealth but normal everything else in tier 2, and instakill+super lunge+ fast vault in tier 3. He doesn't need add-ons but his add-ons make him even more powerful. Low A tier at worst.
---
&gt;Clown can get gen rushed way too fast due to his pitiful map pressure and how optimal survivors can generally deal with his tonic. B tier
---
He doesn't need map pressure when he has 115% movement and tonics that make him arguably the 2nd or 3rd best chaser. A tier
---
&gt;Spirit has a plethora of ways to mindgame the survivors and end chases fast or surprise them and get a free hit early in a chase. S tier.
---
Spirit had mindgames in the beginning but now, ehhh. She's still alright In chases and has good map pressure and has a wee bit of stealth but she isn't godly.
---
&gt;Huntress is alright I suppose but I think she might be B tier with my anecdotal exp. with her and against her. Hse feels too slow.
---
But her hatchets are good if youre good with them. A tier, *maybe* low S.
---
&gt;B tier- Trapper, really? he can get bullied so easily, if he doesn't get extraordinarily lucky with his traps, he can't get enough momentum to dominate the match.
---
&gt;Pig can also get looped very easily with her ability being used just to slow the game down "just a little bit" I think you're right to place her here but I could see where people would believe she is C tier.
---
Both fair
---
LF isn't that good solely because he has no real benefit with his chainsaw unless they're in a group. Aside from instadown that is. Plus his super long penalty.
---
After all the hag feedback, that's also fair.
---
Hell yes he can take my first anytime he feels like it. I mean ahhh scary don’t let him stab me!!

Spirit AFKed early in the game. At first we assumed she was faking a phase walk, but after 30 secs it was obvious. So the survivors all go finish the gens uncontested. The others left out of a gate pretty much right away, but there was another gate right next to where she AFKed, so I open it and start running around in circles in front of the Spirit to get some chase and boldness points before leaving. I'm sure you can see where this is going... I'm running in little circles when this Killer gets back, so he goes into phase walk and pops out right on top of me. Scared the shit out of me. He just hit me once and let me leave, but it was the best and most unexpected jump scare I've ever had.

maybe if you were to swap freddy and clown, this might be true at mid ranks but freddy is useless at rank one and near god tier at low ranks
---
Me too
---
No, I didn't miss it. I'm saying you're wrong. 
---
spirt needs to be higher.
---
There are far too many ways for survivors to abuse how Freddy works for him to be that high.
---
If you buy the dlc it’s cheaper, especially if it’s on sale. With dlc you also get an alternate cosmetic, you don’t get that cosmetic if you buy ingame. 
---
Yes. I’m on PS4 and it’s never been this wacky before. Someone tried to tell me “the player base isn’t big enough” but today is the only times it’s been so off. Getting put with greens and purples against rank 13 and 20 killers is definitely out of the norm.

*Throws temper tantrum in Huntress.*

*Gets mildly disappointed in Clown.*

I love a lot about Clown and I think his voice acting is a big part that sells it. When he gets stunned he lets out a disappointed and mildly annoyed laugh, like he's an uncle at a family get together who just hit his knee on a picnic table. He totally wants to swear or say something crass but he keeps it in.
---
I think the biggest reason I'm a Clown main is his voice. When I hit Survivors I tend to laugh at a dumb mistake they made or at least feel mildly triumphant that I finally caught up with them, so Kenneth and I just laugh together.

Helps that we're both fat fucks who are into the "classics."

Try using blood warden if you like endgame
---
Im still enjoying the game but hitboxes really pisses me off.. Ik its based on the ping of the host but Counter Strike has bad servers as well and its usually attacker who is at a disadvantage.. 
---
Actually, I've been watching your account after you personally attacked me on my own thread the other day, and decided to reply to this comment of you attacking another person. So you were actually wrong with both of those options.
---
I see now that you're clearly a kid who cries because he isn't getting his own way. I'm sorry that your mother had to carry you for 9 months to get the disappointment which is you...
---
The irony of you saying I have no life outside of the computer is ironic since all you seem to bitch about is DBD killer's being weak and survivors strong.
---
Anyway, I'm not gonna respond to you anymore or reply to you. And I've already muted you just after I read that message and before typing my own so it's not like i'll see your response - don't waste your time kiddo. 
---
See you when you grow up.
---
Some games are compatible, such as Fortstupid. However, I don’t think it’s allowed for Dead by Daylight.
---
It's actually the other way around. When survivors git gud they learn to just camp the pallet, which negates Clowns power entirely. Freddy can actually do something against genrush unike Clown. 
---
Shes good but addon dependant, which is why I put her lower.
---
Thanks! Tried to keep a balance between it's core identity and the counterplay to it (:
---
King K Rool remix. Nice.
---
A man of class i see.
---
Only one really, and thats popping gens/totem/gates in your. Thats around it tbh.
---
It's so goddamn enfuriating when people refuse to suicide or leave the match when another Survivor is crawling around. I give them time to possibly get up with Unbreakable but after ~45 seconds I'm not going to make it any harder for the last Survivor to find the hatch.
---
Still enfuriated to this day about the Meg who teabagged in the exit gate while I was lying on the hatch and waited until I was hooked to leave.
---
Actually, I don't really give a damn. Why don't you get a fucking life? Get off the computer, stop checking Reddit every couple of minutes, go outside, get a job, get a girlfriend or boyfriend (I don't judge) and do something with your fucking life instead of stalking some guy's Reddit account you sad and pathetic piece of shit. 
---
Don't worry, I don't run Frank's Mixtape.
---
I run Stab Wounds Study and then Moonwalk you to death.
---
I'm honestly not sure that's any better.
---
GJ. I feel like counting the number of disconnects when using Legion could be a drinking game.
---
As an aside; the number of disconnects has exploded in the last few weeks. I could use other Killers, not even top tier, and salty bitches just DC out of the blue.
