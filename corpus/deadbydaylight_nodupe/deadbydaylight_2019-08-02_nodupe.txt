Yes I just did a couple days ago: https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Spirit-Wallpaper-807711338
---
I once did one that was 2 Minute24Sec
---
Hello everyone, 
---

---
The accounts he is talking about he has no idea of the situation. Instead of civilly private messaging me about a concern he joined my discord channel and immediately started arguing and fighting with my customers (who defended me) as this person shouted scamming. He complains that I did not accept his criticism, but criticism requires civility which was lacking with this individual.
---
Going into my discord in an attempt to sabotage my business is not acceptable, will not be tolerated and he was instantly banned.   
---
Because he was banned from my server he has poisoned Greenmage's mind that i am somehow a scammer, when nobody has been scammed. You can believe this one uniformed person, or you can believe hundreds upon hundreds of my happy customers.  
---
 Please read my message below in response to the points that he makes.
---
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
---
Do not be alarmed by "thekakariki" Nobody has been scammed and I have never done business with that person. If he just talked to me privately things could be clarified (BUT HERE WE ARE).
---
Quoted from "thekakariki"  
---
"Mikasa built up a good reputation for selling codes but he scams people with the account selling."
---
Account ID #114 on my list of accounts that was just recently banned (it was advertised as a non-hacked account). It was not banned before but it is now. The owner of the account that wishes to list their account for sale is still able to play their account (accounts are not static) **Nobody bought the account and nobody is hurt or lost money.** There are multiple reasons for bans, it doesn't mean it was hacked.  
---
IF SOMEBODY were to buy the account and later it was found to be banned due to hacking previously, I will make it right for the buyer.
---
Regarding the account with 500 steam level and 500 games, it was advertised as a legit account, which appeared to be so at the time, and was banned after a short while of the account being sold and is being dealt with appropriately.
---
Each account buyer gets the opportunity to review the account they just purchased with me so that they are satisfied with their purchase.
---
Regarding hacked accounts, yes hacked accounts are against DBD EULA, and the accounts are offered as hacked accounts. The buyer IS FULLY AWARE that the account is hacked and buys at their own risk knowing there is ban potential. Nobody is pressured into buying an account like this.
---
INSTEAD of "thekakariki" civilly talking to me in a private message he jumped to conclusions and IMMEDIATELY and rudely went to my Discord yelling and arguing with people and spreading nonsense that I'm trying trick/scam people in an ATTEMPT to ruin my reputation.
---
This unknown "thekakariki" person has just made **a brand new reddit account** has been posting in multiple places about me, speaking nonsense about situations that he does not know or concerns him. He does not know the reason for which these accounts were banned. Accounts can be banned for multiple reasons, yet he jumps to conclusions in order to grandstand and white knight foolishly about situations he does not know and was not apart of.
---
I have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of happy customers which you can see on my steam page and discord, some of which you see here on these reddit forums defending me without being asked. I am not perfect, I am always looking for better ways to improve the process of account selling so that it is safe for both account sellers and buyers. Nobody has been scammed.  
---
You can believe this one uninformed person, or you can believe hundreds upon hundreds of my happy customers.
---
If anyone has any questions they can send me a message.

#FABRIC
---
Must have missed it, nice one!
---
&lt;3
---
Y'all don't like the doctor? I can imagine it now staring deep in to my eyes never once blinking, and always smiling happy to see me \*swoon\*
---
oh also \*gags\*
---
whats a mechanic that you thought was cool but had to be scraped?
---
Probably a mosh pit.
---
I know im a bit late but do you all plan on giving legion a few buffs since they were hit so hard before?
---
Me: Heck yeah dude nice DS now just leave and
---
*sees the t-bag*
---
No see now I wish you'd died on hook
---
Thank you!
---
:((
---
WHY DONT FELLOW SURVIVORS PAY ATTENTION TO KINDRED AURAS!? OH IM ON A HOOK? YOU SHOULD ALL SIT THERE NOT ON GENS FOR 60 SECONDS, THEN ALL COME RUNNING TO ME AT THE SAME TIME. NO DONT SLOW DOWN WHEN YOU SEE 1 OR 2 OTHER GUYS COMING. EVERYONE COME! ITS A HOOK PARTY!
---
If it glows it goes
---
What if I’m a P3 Claud+Quent main?
---
Ya know sometimes I see people say a killer has speed hacks more than actual speed hacks
---
Bit of a dick for T-Bagging, but since the hag was toxic, it was deserved.
---
It’s honestly so rare though for someone to play one thing some people do but I couldn’t stand that it would be boring af
---
The shape, but i couldnt stalk her for tier three anymore
---
10 months to get devotion 8+ I have no life 💀
---
*insert Sherlock Holmes math thinking scene*
---
What perks and add ons?
---
I can hear the young and impressionable coming to jerk off their fave streamer's ego
---
This was surprisingly motivational, thank you
---
LOADING FOR 10 MINUTES INTO A MATCH ONLY TO BE KICKED OUT IMMEDIATELY MULTIPLE TIMES
---
I said nothing personal man im sorry
---
Yeah the way he walks around as well it's quite intimidating
---
What?
---
I know you did, just relax more.
---
What platform was it on? I do believe PS4 has a bug that can't intentionally be done that just stops sprints burst from ending. It's been posted here a couple times.
---
Yeah of course I got the game like a week ago and I’m rank 10 and I just play who I like to play
---
April 1st you get daily challenges for trapper, complete them and you get the outfit.
---
People complain or accuse someone of having speed hacks more than people who actually speed hack
---
No. Literally the worst killer rn.
---
Nope he had dead hard, self care, adrenaline and i think decisive strike. If i remeber corectlly
---
Survivors would literally run into Myers hoping he has a tombstone. But everyone would be happy saying "choke me daddy" into actually getting choked. Survivors get their fetish. Killers get their 4k. It's way too healthy of a system
---
Will you ever put a fanmade killer/survivor in the game
---
Yea the T bag was unnecessary. Dick move
---
I play as Claduette but I wear the bright pink shirt and the Jean's from the left 4 dead stuff
---
Well uploading the entire match is pretty pointless
---
Exit gates are open you have a guy on the hook are you going to camp him? Or how about this you hook someone but you see people around you trying to save are you not going to camp until you know no one is there? It is fair and good in some cases
---
That was months ago on ps4 you cant report their profile
---
Hopefully you did it at the right time.
---
Giving them two free hits was unnecessary but guess what
---
It’s never fair, chase people away from the guy on the hook. And at the end game is the gates are open accept the L you lost east as that
---
Camping isn’t even that good. I see people complain about it but if I’m getting camped I just tell my teammates to gen rush and GTFO.
---
Than don’t complain when people state you being a dick
---
You were unhooked right in front of the killer. That's practically an insult to us. That being said, if you can run over to the unhooking survivor, you can punish them rather than the guy who got unhooked
---
[removed]
---
I did report him once maybe ten times
---
OH YOU!
---
Your definitely a survivor main I’d camp in both especially if the exit gates are open and I have a hooked survivor
---
A bit of overkill maybe? 😅
---
I have to play solo because I ain't got no friends.
---
Then again, I suck at the game, so it's probably for the best.
---
But at the same time, it goes both ways, a Killer on average should get around 2 kills a game, but survivors have this mentality in which they think they should escape every game rather than dying in around 50% of matches, more or less depending on your skill
---
Pig has stealth, game slowing and little speed boost. She’s definitely not trash.
---
What rank are you
---
How is that an insult to
---
You? Never heard of borrowed time? If the guy was unhooked right in front of the killer then you DEFINITELY have time to punish the unhooking survivor. Not the one being sandbagged
---
Maybe is the key word
---
Not even talking about that camping while you can do it I’m talking about if the exit gates are open or if you see a full team of SWF or just survivors around a hook
---
Oh duhhhh I’m an idiot. Let me just chase 3 people all at the same time. How stupid of me
---
Oof
---
So I’m a rank 6 in both sides but I’m a survivor main😂😂 you’re Definitely an ignorant jackass.
---
Goddspeed, this is my favorite unusable perk in the game. Having it work similar to Sole Survivor would be absolutely amazing, even if the buff is minor in comparison.
---
Honestly the only times I've ever blocked through a window or over a pallet is when playing with my friends. Fuck those guys
---
It’s not my fault you’re horrible at the game and need to camp to ensure yourself a kill 😂😂😂
---
It doesn’t matter how many hits he got he was literally at the furthest point of the end gate he could’ve been , he was gonna make it out when he feel so no he is a pos
---
It's not easy.
---
Oof indeed my friend
---
I say go for leatherface. While you unlock BBQ3 on your main killer you will start to rack up double BP really fast which you can spend on your other killers and in the meantime you also collect shards to unlock e.g. Plague if you wish. Alternatively, wait for the shrine. Mind you the shrine only had BBQ once back in April.
---
Nice survivor main
---
I’m not gonna waste my time trying to explain anything to someone as ignorant as you are.
---
Discordance is decent and people have been memeing with Mad Grit. 
---
Low ranks you’ll have some decently fun matches if you play them right, apply deep wound then use instinct to find healthy survivors. But honestly Legion gets rooooooough the higher in rank you go.
---
Myers was my first dlc killer and I still enjoy him (first P3’d character), and I really enjoyed GhostFace. Look up some YouTube videos and see if he’s your speed.
---
Same could be said about flipping someone off. It’s just a finger pointing up and all the rest are down. 
---
It’s the meaning behind it that means something. It’s just showing off basic disrespect.
---
You lost the conversation and that’s what you’re having to settle to 😂😂😂
---
I’m a rank 3 killer you don’t get there by camping
---
Love the creativity! On a diction standpoint, I would suggest modifying how the downpour was “gently falling.” 
---
I would personally like to see a cool dynamic like this in the game; however, the character looks similar to the killer from I Know What You Did Last Summer, so IF that happens to be a killer they want to eventually add, this one would probably be modified, if even just the outfit.
---
*Flair checks out*
---
Haven’t lost the conversation if anyone has lost its you lol
---
You’re a pos clearly, you’re so blind by ignorance you can’t see that he GAVE the killer more points even though they completely destroyed him, he didn’t have to do that
---
Honestly I agree. 
---
Survivor groups who play with coordination can do the same thing to most M1 Killers and it's not balanced there either.
---
Nurse isn't the only thing in this game that needs changing, but she *does* need changing.
---
Anyone else think this looks like they took some old He-man action figures and slapped a Mikey mask on em?
---
I was all about it, the lucky unhook, you saved your teammate, you both had d-strike so you got away. Then to just rub it in you had to teabag, and that is where you lost all respect. I dont care if you gave 2 "free" hits, your actions from what you showed were uncalled for, especially since you realistically only escaped because you were lucky. Stop being a toxic kid and learn to win gracefully.
---
How is it me? You keep saying a survivor main but have no comebacks or valid points to defend yourself nice try kiddo
---
Ok answer this when he fell would he have made it out?
---
Yes
---
Well playing the game is disrespecting the killer since we throw pallets at them every match and get The Entity mad at them by escaping
---
Um you know most people hold the game hostage just so killers can and watch them be disrespected in there face because people love doing that. 
---
But no we’ll go with it’s to give “free hits”
---
But that just goes for all killers, not just amanda
---
You’re ignoring my point he gave him free points he could have just left without giving him any? He didn’t need to do that but he did. He could have just escaped and not given the killer jack shit
---
Because it’s obviously true in some cases  you need to camp lol being nice dosnt get wins man just saying
---
That’s completely different. That’s using the game mechanics that’s not being disrespectful. That’s just you trying to survive, nice try buddy.
---
You can’t hold the end game hostage with the end game collapse so try again. They put that in to favor the sad killers who complained about it
---
Wow he got more blood points omg he’s so generous, you’re right sorry I’m ignorant I’ll forgive his dickish behaviour for a few extra blood points
---
Never said it did, but being an ignorant jackass doesn’t either
---
Had a game last night where my friend a feng looped a ghost face for 3 minutes and when he got down the ghost face t bagged for the rest of the game and everyone else escaped.
---
Reading the comments makes me think that I should try SWF at some point... I've got 600 hours solo so far.  It isn't always that bad.
---
Well, the prestige 3 Claudette outfit is considered kinda toxic because it makes her damn near invisible, other than that not much
---
Can’t argue with stupid we’ll just say you’re right
---
Killer mains can excuse dropping people in front of the trap door and closing it but tbagging at the exit gates really gets them going huh
---
This sounds sick af dude
---
I like how he is still swinging his hand slightly.
---
But you said camping isn’t fair?
---
That's awesome! Wish I could draw like that!
---
You’re an ignorant asshole I’m sorry It’s not my fault. I’m not disagreeing with you one bit but your ignorance isn’t allowing you to see my point
---
As a killer main I can say that I don’t care what you wear. It’s the actions a survivor makes which decides if they are being toxic or not.
---
Have you noticed true talent getting repeatedly sniped? I feel really sad for him, could you guys please look at his channel and help him out?
---
Mhm
---
It’s not, but if you’re playing like a toxic piece of shit doing things that are unnecessary for your escape then I’ll do the same . Other than that I’ll never camp or tunnel
---
I JUST HAD TWO KILLERS DC BACK TO BACK AND BECAUSE I PLAY ON PLAYSTATION I GOT THE SHORT END OF THE STICK AND DIDN'T GET MY DESERVED BLOOD POINTS FROM EITHER FUCKING MATCH. AND ON TOP OF IT WHEN I CONFRONTED ONE OF THEM THE FUCKER HAD THE NERVE TO CALL ME A BITCH AFTER COMING UP WITH A BULLSHIT EXCUSE FOR DCING
---
So you’re disagreeing that he shouldn’t try to heal himself to get more altruistic points
---
It doesn’t mean anything it’s just survivors being idiots
---
This is probably the best thing I've seen all day here on this subreddit.
---
Excellent editing skills as well.
---
Storm + Ruin + Haunted sounds like a build made of mollases
---
If it was King Crimson he would have just died suddenly but without teleporting back to where he just was
---
Okay buddy maybe you should learn context and how to play the fucking game
---
I usually see toxic behaviour in Mins with blue pigtails and Neas with pink hair. 
---
Apart from that, it depends on the survivor, not on their cosmetics.
---
Head on, borrowed time, dead hard, decisive strike.... Jesus, do survivor mains have no imagination when it comes to perk combinations, or is the meta just that heavily engrained?
---
It is hard ;)
---
And a killer can punish the unhooker by downing you to deny altruism then go after the unhooker while forcing someone else to hop off a gen to pick you up.
---
But it’s a jump scare. I’m pretty sure even the devs know that their original plan to make an immersive scary game is gone.
---
yeah me too mate.
---
I don't really want to take out spine chill because it saves my life a lot, but If you insist I will consider it.

Challenging the Trapper may not be a good idea... he'll trap the Pig into getting checkmated.
---
I understand context and how to play the game. Hear me out on this one maybe you should learn how to speak to people with some respect and just maybe people will actually care about your opinions
---
I'm only for Tbagging the killer when they camp/tunnel. Which is what this Hag did. He deserved those tbags.
---
Mommy huntress can peg me all she wants
---
She's fine no nerf b
---
Needed
---
And the game's mechanics allow us to t-bag
---
I don’t know if you’re trolling or not but it’s common to run ruin with haunted grounds, therefore if they get the haunted grounds totem first they’re fucked
---
Faxx
---
Bt is a good perk but at T1 it’s not great. 
---
Honestly I would start using Bt when you get it at least T2 or T3.
---
HERE COMES THE CRAPPER INTESIFIES
---
Yea it would be alot of work but I'm willing to put the effort it, and yes reddit Is great for a mix of fan opinion and developer interaction
---
Ace uses Decisive Strike!
---
Leatherface got stunned for 5 seconds
---
Learherface uses m1! 
---
Ace got downed
---
Learherface uses Facecamp!
---
Ace uses disconnect
---
I think it's actually cannon cannon, the main reason why Bubba attacked people is cause he was afraid
---
I love our anxious cannibal boy
---
They're probably just astonished that Bill got on PS4 despite L4D never once appearing on a PlayStation console before.
---
No Mither - don't. 
---
STBFL - ignore the obsession and get stacks from others.
---
That’s what someone who gets mad when they get camped would say
---
So you kill your obsession at the end?
---
Ace used Dead Hard!
---
It's not very effective...
---
If this is a means to compare 2 “bad” perks then you have a very flawed outlook upon STBFL. Sure while it’s not the best it’s still a pretty good perk. Especially for M1 killers.
---
So a big ass teenager who drank too much?
---
Love when that happens, ez escape.
---
Myers: stabbing in the dark by ice nine kills
---
Pig: the jig is up by same band as the first
---
Freddy: American nightmare by the same band
---
Leatherface: slashers by the same band
---
I’m a big fan of ice nine kills.
---
Whats m1?
---
The No Mither buff looks great.
---
If you’re not playing with SWF, you won’t have a way of telling the other survivors that the killer is camping.
---
And no its not to compare i just want information on both
---
From the entity
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Although you are right for most killers
---
Eh
---
Exactly
---
This is me with the past 5 games being laggy Ghostfaces
---
Ok I'll try it out back on again. I was finding I wouldn't use it in most games
---
It’s just swinging your weapon 
---
Pc has M1 mouse 1 
---
Xbox and Ps has RT.
---
Pretty much.
---
Ok, I'll start working on my bill next then
---
Thanks
---
I wonder why it’s specifically ressurection...
---
Leather mommy skin makes it worth
---
That’s what they are
---
Oh well STBFL you can ignore your obsession but even get a few stacks is good. It makes recuperating from attacks faster. 
---
I don’t play no mither for how bad it is.
---
According to Putin it's the same thing.
---
That's your call man! If you dont get use out of it dont use it then, in my situation I find the rank I'm at (12) if I match with someone lower than 15 or 16 I tend to run them a long time since I've played for a while, and as dumb as it sounds probably every 4th one that happens with feels like that deserves to be camped and without ds I'd just get rehooked cause solo teammates rarely seem to care if they're farming you or not and don't use borrowed time or at least take a hit.
---
least you didn't get it open.
---
Explanation rule:
---
In 3.1.0 patch pig's ability was changed so it doesn't count as M1 attack any more, disabling most attacking effects from perks (NOED, Franklin's, make your choice, haunted grounds, devour hope, and doesn't give stacks for hitting perks like  Save the Best for Last) .
---
She isn't tho. At least not in high rank
---
Will legion ever get their balls back? As in ungutted. I wanna main them as killer but like.. it seems like I'm just setting myself up to just fail do to how much they got neutered.
---
Ambush doesn't count as M1 attack anymore so a lot of perks don't work with it, including her signature perk "Make Your Choice".
---
Lets say you working for a week at some random job. 
---
You're still new, so you dont make much of it until the last day. 
---
Your other colleagues did better tham you tr whole week.
---
Guess you dont deserve the money you worked for.
---
Streaming is a hobby even if you get money from it. Drawing is a hobby even if you sell your art on a website.  A hobby is never a job, it's only a hobby. They're only a job if you get money from a company to do a hobby.
---
r/dbdgonegay is better 😤😤😤
---
I honestly feel like plague is the killer I survive the most against 
---
It's usually only when everyone cleanses we can sometimes lose
---
Save the best for last on pig is honestly not to bad because you won't lose stacks for ambushing the obession
---
He's trash high rank
---
I want to play DBD tho, not M1 simulator while your teammate gets camped
---
Well she's fun but suck high rank
---
No I’m saying this in the perspective of a killer
---
I'm actually belittling your comment based on the fact that you can't meet any standard I've inquired about that would suggest you have even a shred of credibility. *If* you are red  ranked with Hag, congrats, you use a strong killer that feels easy.
---
And as for Doctor, doubtful, because the internet has no consequences for deceit, hence the reason *I asked for proof.*
---
And as for creativity, you pointed out that killer mains have nothing to do during their long queues but bitch about their actually very easy role. Petty *and* hypocritical.
---
And telling me not to argue if I'm not a red ranked 4K killer, that is *further hypocrisy* because you disregard my claim that only a rank 20 idiot thinks killer is easy in favor of saying that anyone lower than rank 4 can't have argue with your so-obviously idiotic opinion.
---
Lol no i know but that's the joke
---
Just ignore it. I got a message today playing bubba accusing me of using an OP character cause he can one hit survivors, and I did terrible. Literally a 1k, I got clowned on multiple times and someone still bitched.
---
As in next year :)
---
Oof.exe
---
...wearing clothes is not toxic
---
I agree with this 100%.
---
As long as she remains hard to learn Nurse should stay strong when in skilled hands; but she shouldn't be so strong in skilled hands that there's little to no reason to play against her.
---
I was just crouching, stopped crouching and crouching again very rapidly
---
*But it's actually Devour Hope and the killer dcs*
---
AS A KILLER I AM CONSTANTLY MATCHED VS GENRUSHING CRAZIES!
---
AS A SURVIVOR, I AM CONSTANTLY MATCHED WITH PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T FIND A GEN WITH THE MAP AND BOTH HANDS!
---
Hey there,
---
Rank 1 since beta here. Best advice I can give is to get used to playing without Spine Chill. Develop your game sense and vigilance. Learn about vantage point, map pressure, camera work, knowledge of escape routes etc. Spine chill prevents you from taking your survivor gameplay to the next level. It hinders your ability to develop your own built-in spine chill. With enough time you should be able to learn what good killers will do to pressure maps, where they will go and what routes they will run to be efficient and effective. With that knowledge you won’t need spine chill.
---
I’d recommend losing Lithe as well. I do not run any exhaustion perks. Dead Hard is probably the best of the bunch though. Sometimes I play perkless just to really get back to the roots of the game. If that’s too much, run Bond. Years ago when we did streamer run tournaments, Bond was the only perk survivors were allowed to use - and there’s a reason for that. 
---
If you want a good build, Dead Hard with DS, Bond and Borrowed (if you are big balls altruistic) is a nice build though.
---
I only camp when there’s like 2 survivors left
---
No thanks
---
It already kinda does you get assaulted by a random person
---
Cant get licensed characters with shards.
---
Piggie is pettie thiccie
---
That’s exactly what I was thinking too! Slap a fucking sword in his hand and you have masked He-Man going to a cosplay!
---
Um... Is there any chance that with dedicated servers will it allow me to play survivor because currently anytime I look for a game I can't for Strict NAT but atm am enjoying killer
---
Camping killers are good. You could probably as a team get 3 gens done in the time it takes for them to down, hook and camp someone.
---
*piano theme*
---
When Bill takes too many pills.
---
Thanks for the info, I didn't know that I'm quite new only been playing since June 2016.
---
Why does everyone assume Amanda oinks when she has never done so
---
You mean tbagging it doesn’t matter how you explain it you knew what you where doing and you where doing it on purpose.
---
It's because they're too cowardly to actually tell you in your language. There's a difference between calling someone a bitch online as opposed to to their face, it makes them a coward, but this is amplified if they don't even do it in your language.
---
I'm guessing he tunneled you for that
---
well most of them are monsters, soooo
---
Did you do a wraith one by any chance?
---
He tunnelled everyone and camped when we were hooked.
---
Good thing he was mentally deficient.
---
Idk but they said she getting changes like her stealth being better but I don’t know much more than that
---
Now I’m legit curious
---
Completely wasted the pallet.  Just run off after D Strike.  Loop back to it later.
---
1 be on pc
---
2 edit picture files
---
Haha I'm sorry bruv play her at you want man :) it's about having fun. It's just going to be hella frustrating ranking up with her
---
Okay yeah, but all the picture files are just the white icons, not the background, I can’t find the background files
---
Nah, he was awful. I stunned him with the pallet to guarantee my escape as he tunnelled. He couldn’t do a thing in proper chases.
---
I said fuck it since none of my friends play the game, I started to play killer
---
Lol yea pretty much
---
No man seriously as an FYI that was a bad play.  Take advantage of the stun time and run to the next safe area next time and you and the others will still have that pallet for when you actually need it.  All you did was burn it for no reason.
---
Well at least you didn’t dc. 
---
You are one good teammate.
---
Who needs a guy?:
---
Every time a male character saves a female character from the hook, that male character gets put into the dying state.
---
His camera is directly over his rank and he never shows the menu at the end game lobby that shows everyone’s points/rank. This implies that he smurfs so he can basically destroy lower skilled/beginning players. You’re able to just look like a straight up badass when you do this. But the fact he goes out of his way to hide it comes off really insecure and makes me cringe just a bit. Not to be completely hating on him I’m sure he has good content  but I really think he’s better off just showing the rank and not giving a damn.
---
A legion that brought an Ebon Mori got mad at us because he camped people on hook so nobody was ever in a spot to get mori'd.
---
You don’t understand what I said do you
---
Rip old legion
---
I respect the Claudette that does gens, loops and heals others. Not hiding and self caring. Hate that. 
---
Iri Hatcher huntress = DC. No questions asked. I have about 27 of those add ons saved and I vow NEVER to use them. Ever.

I’m fully aware of how to play. This was a bit into the match. I was able to grasp his skill level and dropped the pallet. The other survivors were fine. The killer couldn’t do a thing.
---
Hey, I understad what you think. But It's not always like that, It is pretty hard being the spirit. And some add ones won't last forever as a killer. So even tho she glimses. You do hear her if she is phasing to you.
---
But I haven's seen anyone play as her in a long time now. The most popular is bubba, hillbilly, the nightmare, trapper, the pig. I don't really see these killers as much, wraith, nurse, legion, plauge. And it has been forever I've seen the spirit. If I did forget someone now, then It's been forever I have seen them😅 
---
But this is on ps4😊
---
Yup. I did that as killer for a survivor last night. Hoping it'll get paid forward some time.
---
Nice
---
Look man I’m not a huge fan of the joke either but let people have fun
---
Might have been complaining about No One Escapes Death. Judging from his comment did he manage to get away only because of the speed boost from NOED not being strong enough?
---
LOW-RANK GAME VS LEGION. GUYS STOP DOING GENS WITH ME WITH 3 GENS LEFT AND ALL ARE LOW % DONE. I ONLY HAVE ~40 HOURS AND EVEN MY NOOB ASS KNOWS DISCORDANCE IS THE BEST PERK LEGION HAS.
---
I don’t DC unless it’s for some serious bullshit
---
Your "no one escapes death" perk. He is saying you need to level it to 3 to get real good use out of it
---
Unbreakable tenacity and flip flop. The fourth one is your choice. I promise if the killer is distracted for even a second before picking you up you slither away so fast and get up at the same time.
---
He’s being helpful and saying get NOED to tier 3. 
---
Noed= No one escaped death, it’s a perk. 
---
Tier= how many times you can find a perk in a bloodweb Tier 3 is the best version of the perk. 
---
Well I think he’s being helpful idk. But yeah.
---
It's actually the other way around.
---
this is great
---
This is great! I am happy that you mentioned this😘
---
i didn't have time ;-;
---
Ignore them, Amanda is best girl and she can kill me any day she wants to. She’s fun to play so I don’t care if she’s bad I’m in love with her either way
---
I think people are mostly worried he would look weird if they made him taller, I absolutely think it would be interesting to have him as a killer though.
---
It's a bug with exhaustion not going off like it should IIRC so it could be adrenaline, especially if it was after 15 min I am assuming gens were done. Maybe dead hard but that doesnt sound right.
---
Thank you so much! I'm dropping spine chill right now. I'll use bond, ds and borrowed. I don't have dead hard so I won't use an exhaustion perks and adrenaline or iron will instead. Thanks so much. Do you happen to have any other tips you think everyone should Know?
---
interesting though weather on maps could be, complex to say the least as what about indoor maps or maps that already have weather?
---
also the storm would need to do more than just obscure the killer and his terror radius it should debilitate survivors or empower the killer or something along those lines
---
Okay, when a player leaves in the middle of the game, or in the start or in the end. Could 1 generator being gone then? Like it get automaticly fixed. Or just the number 5 becomes 4 whitout anyone to het fixed. Since 3 survivors is pretty hard to deal with a killer. It's possible bit hard.
---
But if there is only 1 generator left to get fixed, and someone disconnects. Could the exit gated being powered?
---
He's being a toxic cunt complaining about noed even though he probably ain't cleanse a single totem. There's no reason a killer should feel bad about using noed, ok buddy? If survivors wanna use adrenaline and all the other toxic or second chance perks, killers can use all the perks they want.
---
You say this as if killers don't always use a build that is either ruin, BBQ and chili, enduring, and spirit OR ruin, bbq, noed, and pop goes the weasel
---
It’s used for pleasure
---
*prayer beads with 4 hex totems noises*
---
I'm gonna do it for someone. Gotta pay it forward, I was gonna gift that guy some Auric Cells,but you can't buy them for someone else.
---
I disconnect everytime Im against the doctor, I hate playing against him so much.
---
Idk what they were thinking making this PoS killer
---
The BP Build (Survivor)
---
We’re Gonna Live Forever
---
Prove Thyself
---
Deliverance
---
Bond
---
Prove Thyself’s 100% BP to Coop actions greatly increases the amount of BP you will have at the end of the match. Use Bond to find other players and you’ll be able consistently max out Objective Points every game. 
---
The key part of this build is to get Deliverance to proc for the 1.5k BP for the escape, as Survival is hard to max. If the killer finds you first it’s unlikely you’ll be able to get to use Deliverance unless you escape or maliciously use Bond.
---
WGLF is obvious for the BP, but if you’re concerned with farming teammates you can switch out one of the perks for Borrowed Time.
---
Agreed. They should definitely bring back Nancy's face (it was her face we were seeing each time we put someone to sleep) and put it back into Freddy's kit. It was such a unique thing and now all that, along with every other bit of uniqueness to Freddy's kit, is gone.
---
The flickering should also happen more often. It's stupid how I can be awake and still be watching Freddy's every move as long as I'm within x meters of him. 
---
I'm not sure how to fix this either.
---
 cosmetics for laurie and Quentin
---
Yeah man I'm going to need a little red circle before I see him.
---
Stop trying to defend your awful play, he was only trying to help. Four gens are left so most of the game is still left so that pallet is vital. It’s even worse considering it’s a very loopable and safe pallet. No matter how bad of a killer he was, the pallet drop was a waste. Plus since he was already stunned, the pallet drop did nothing.
---
but u have time to die apparently
---
I feel like it would be better if the last panel was blood warden or something
---
**Victory Screech**
---
thank u for being so nice ):
---
Lol I dont know why but thats the funniest shit I have ever seen
---
lol ur right
---
Didn't they say they were fixing the survival category to fix the gap?
---
*sips beer* yep
---
I indeed did :) https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Wraith-Wallpaper-761379236
---
?? i was helping others escape and by that time the end game timer went down to a quarter left
---
don't get used to it if you're gonna keep using noed :)
---
I don’t understand how either way parties were toxic? Or if this is just a meme
---
What does the scanner say about her add-ons??
---
SHE HAS 5 BLINKS
---
Hot also that’s his mori form right
---
“Pallet drop did nothing”
---
Got points for it which is all I care about.
---
I was toxic all game and she camped only for me to find out she had noed but I can’t post a 20 minute video on reddit so I tried to keep it short and sweet 😅
---
What are you having trouble with and what perks do you run?
---
Emojis arent allowed here
---
Oh my bad..
---
I didn't know that because all you said was you couldn't leave.

Should I take the post down?
---
No you dont have to be, i just saved you from getting downvoted to oblivion in other subreddits :)
---
Yeah
---
Okay thanks man... should I repost you think and get rid of them ?
---
No dont, people just dont like emojis. Its not against the rules or something. People just dont like it here
---
Are these builds for survivor or killer?
---
For a while, skillchecks will regress progress made on healing a survivor until you get a certain amount of tokens (get tokens from doing healing skillchecks) and then healing will be crazy fast like 2 to 4 seconds (exaggerated)
---
Good to know thank you! It’s my second post so im still a little new to the community! So I appreciate this.
---
I don’t understand why she keeps getting these pointless nerfs. I hope we see a pig buff that absolutely makes her OP as hell for a few weeks.
---
Are you able to make one in the form of the poster you don’t have too it’s just a request
---
I swear every single shaved hair Dwight I run into is really arrogant and cocky. Default Dwights are always easy to catch, seemingly newer players. Store bought clothing Kates are good at escaping and rub it in your face. Meg's wearing peachy pink sort of sporty outfits point at you after making you chase them around a loop for ages. Adept Claudettes wear black hair and dark clothes so they can become one with the tall grass. Neas drive me up the wall in general. The bloody clothing Neas are particularly annoying whereas the funky hair Neas are all style but easy to down. That's my experiences anyway!
---
No problem :) have fun on this subreddit. It has alot of funny memes
---
Very relatable too lol
---
I get teammates who crouch all game long, looking at walls or into corners. Or if they finally do help, they unhook you in front of the killer. Like WTF bill.
---
Wowowowowow omg that hurted me so much omg omg.... help pls someone, th-this guy said to me that my personal thoughts for something are bad because he doesnt agree omg omg
---
You are moving goal posts. First you said it stunned him so it was the right move. Now you're saying all you care about is points. It was a bad play. You lost some ground.
---
I'M ANNOYED BECAUSE BHVR IS PUTTING THE SWITCH PORT BEFORE DEDICATED SERVERS WHEN I DON'T EVEN OWN A SWITCH
---
DEDICATED SERVERS WILL IMPROVE THE GAME FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING SWITCH PLAYERS DO YOU REALLY WANT THEIR FIRST IMPRESSIONS TO *NOT* BE OF DEDICATED SERVERS?
---
I'll buy Myers because I like his soundtrack :))
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Other than that, meh, will not spend a dime on this game anymore. They need to release dedicated servers first to convince me back to spending.
---
No buy ghostface are pig
---
wHy ArE wE tYpInG lIkE tHiS?
---
Criss angel survivor comfirmed
---
NOED basically does nothing at tier 1 and 2
---
First, all I do care about is points, which I why I don’t care if it’s a “waste of a pallet”
---
Second, it stunned him enough for me to escape. In case got hadn’t noticed, this isn’t a clip of the whole match. There’s a lot you aren’t seeing. That pallet helped me out.
---
This is one of the coolest ideas I’ve heard for a new killer. Unfortunately I think ormond straight up broke the game because of the light snow effect. I don’t think the game could handle torrential down pour well.
---
Yeah, its so look fun to sit on a hook and get hit basically not getting to play the video game, you're just a dick
---
It's just something the survivors don't like when it happens to them. And anything the survivors don't like is going to get a lot of complaints and reports.
---
i love that double take when she hit the ground
---
They went on Sale a little while back. But idk when they'll do it again.
---
Are you planning on buffing or changing Ash's perks at all? they are all too situational to be of use, or too weak.
---
Why in the hell is bubba bot even in the lowest tier? Bruh and why is every girl in the lowest tier? Bold of you to assume.
---
I could go on forever about tips for survivors. But the main philosophy you need to have is this: being survivor (or killer for that matter) is all about time management and efficiency. Do not waste time doing nothing. Always ask yourself: what do I need to be doing? What am I doing? If you aren't doing a gen, go for the save, if you see someone going for the save, do a gen. Find ruin. Always have an objective. Don't just crouch walk everywhere etc. It's a race against time.
---
No it didn't lol. You didn't stun him with the pallet. He was still being stunned with decisive. The pallet did nothing. You are wrong.
---
That was super helpful! 🙂
---
It definitely stunned him.
---
Must be a regional thing I wonder. Iv probably only played against him 5 times at most since rework.
---
ok fair
---
Just bought the plague and freddy &amp; i cant get a decent feel for either character cause i keep getting stuck with way out of rank SWF groups who'd rather take the game hostage &amp; troll the fuck out of me then after 50minutes finally use a key to escape
---
Any plans on buffing wraith? It's so frustrating to me that pig and ghostface can both attack out of stealth and have seccondary abilities but wraith has to spend so much time uncloaking and has to reveal himself to do so.
---
Good smile Company has to show interest and approach Behaviour, not the other way around. Depending on how good the sales are on the trapper, they might want to license other characters, too. I would love to see more as well but unfortunately I highly doubt it at this point
---
LMAO I'm out!
---
Just a warning people are gonna complain about how you need good perks and how trash you are after not reading that you just bought the characters I think there needs to be like a quick play mode and not just survive with friends they said they were looking at a training mode also
---
Yeah I can but there's one more character I plan on making tomorrow but its a secret
---
I would say it's still a ways off. But there is certainly progress.
---
The daily rituals could be better, but maybe my rng is just the worst thing ever. I'll get 8 killer dailies before I get a survivor one. It's actually become so had I laugh when I delete a killer ritual just to get another one:(
---
Look at the points. I got points for stunning him with DS and then points for stunning him with the pallet. I was there, I know it stunned him.
---
Recently they were on sale for 2.99-3.99 on ps4
---
Oh groovy
---
Max prestige too so whenever i need to punish swf groups im well equiped
---
Pretty good question tho

I'd be fine with 30 fps flat if it didn't stutter so much tbh.
---
Interesting. This probably does help even things out. Game by game it might not make too big of a difference, but multiply it over dozens or even hundreds of games, and survivors are definitely getting way more games in.
---
amazing!
---
How is it an insult? The train of thought might as well be either "I literally do not care if he hits me" or "Watch me get this guy killed just as a big giant middle finger to the killer!"
---
Also, why are you mad I was agreeing with you
---
Amanda was the first character I hit L50 and Prestiged. Had a ball doing it. I think her dash is 90% useless, though. Why would I make a roaring noise for a painfully short sprint when I could just creep up on a fool and crack 'em in the back of the skull or straight up rip 'em off a generator? Only use I've seen for it is ducking mid-loop to catch bad players off-guard. 
---
Oh, and her add-ons are varying degrees of poo. Still, I like sneaking up on people and seeing their movement freak out briefly as they jump in their seat.
---
unless they purposely lead you near no walls an have the best add ons.
---
All three of those things are teachables, rank 20s can't get those teachables and they're the ones that need them the most.
---
....picture or n word?
---
Inb4 item stealer outbreak.
---
Facts are facts, America
---
She’s not that hard if you look behind while running to see when she will blink
---
Saw usylis pill this and wanted to try it. It actually takes a good bit of effort to get the killer to come back to you after getting unhooked and open the locker. They know you have decisive so some wait. I put on deliverance so I could unhook myself immediately. That makes it likely the killer will come back since he isn't far.
---
I’m all ears, monitor and abuse, thrilling tremors, and bitter murmurs. The only one of the meta perks that I have for teachables is bbq and chilling but I do not have it for GF yet. I am really bad at approaching to stalk and getting any momentum in matches with him (I keep getting bad starts and I feel like I have to have good starts to do well with him.)
---
Oooh seems like a very strong build indeed. You’re right, I’d put Borrowed Time in there just because I love helping my teammates. Borrowed Time is such a clutch perk. I dig this whole BP build and it doesn’t involve farming either which is nice!
---
Either! I’ll edit the post and add this
---
Would you consider a lobby in which players can request a "quick match"? Essentially, they have no preference regarding Killer or Survivor and just want to get in a match quickly.
---
I agree. Pallets can change the flow of ANY game
---
The original picture of Willam Defoe.
---
Yeah it coulda been something worth while with my looter build
---
I got a good quality mask from them once.
---
We need pantless trapper more than shirtless myres tbh
---
Someone watched HybridPanda’s shrine watch. 🤣
---
Right! And the killer wasn’t even that bad
---
The hag is free is she not? Just go grab some hex ruin.
---
Spine chill legit the best perk, but I've given up trying to convince people. Besides if it's not as in the meta then killers won't try counter it
---
It's a custom pack made for certain streamers that people stole and re uploaded at a shittier quality
---
It's not kobe when you pull yourself off, it's a yeet.
---
Come on.
---
Why is the dream world so bright now? The previous version's lighting was just fine.
---
Why did you nix the fog and moonlight offerings?
---
It makes me even happier that you used Ace.
---
I run Ace in the Hole and Plunderer’s. Pharmacy is nice for speed and sound, but you always get a green med kit. Also use any coins you have
---
You're just ignoring the situation OPs post was about and it's fucking embarrassing. Fuck your straw man argument pal. 12 days, in every single killer game and then mocking Tru3 after each game by chatting and changing their names. It's obvious and is by far enough proof for them to be banned. If you genuinely don't believe they should be banned for griefing and harassing a streamer for 12 days, I know you're just baiting me.
---
Good lord I hope not.
---
Yeah on top of that there's "no tunneling" or "no slugging" when sometimes you have no other choice and when they are at the exit gates they get all toxic. 
---
I haven't played nearly as much as you but there are tons of dedicated people I know that play it and they said once you get into purple/red rank it just becomes so hard to have fun as a killer since you have to use strong killers to effectively kill survivors. 
---
So they play alot of Kill Your Friends just to enjoy the game and it's sad how you have to buy characters for some of the really useful perks. 
---
I do get why ruin is in there rarely since everyone has the hag and they can just grind her levels but you might not really be good with her/like her and if you're in the high ranks it's not going to be easy.
---
HAVE FUN WITH GHOST FACE.  HOWEVER, I WILL SAY THAT MYERS IS THE SCARIEST KILLER TO ME.
---
I CAN ALWAYS SEE GHOST FACE COMING WITH PERKS LIKE SPINE CHILL AND PREMONITION.  IF I HAVE THEM BOTH EQUIPPED, I KNOW WHEN HE'S COMING DIRECTLY TOWARD ME AND WHAT DIRECTION HE'S COMING FROM.  THEN I CAN USE URBAN EVASION TO CROUCH MY WAY INTO THE SHADOWS AND DISAPPEAR, LEAVING NO SCRATCH MARKS.
---
THOSE PERKS DON'T HELP AGAINST TIER 1 MYERS.  HE JUST STABS ME TO LET ME KNOW HE'S THERE.
---
Can also google his power on wiki or a dedicated page and read that for a minute just like you read reddit
---
Hag is only free on consoles
---
Except... no. I don’t use any of those except ruin on my “fuck your gens” meme build.
---
You are a god
---
My first time w DBD I played 3 games as Trapper and got 1 sacrifice. My 4th game was as Pig and I got a 4k. 
---
Pig may not be effective at the absolute highest levels of the game but I have never felt like I had consistent problems getting sacrifices with her, especially after I started bringing other killers' perks in.
---
Now wait a minute!
---
legion is objectively bad
---
This is the best news I've gotten all day!
---
Big buffs???? YESSS
---
Will there be any skins for the shape?
---
As a Pig main I agree w everything you said but I would add that when a RBT goes off and gives you a GAME OVER kill it's one of, if not the best feeling in the game.
---
Sometimes I play survivor because of killer wait times or I get tired of trying hard to get a reasonable amount of kills. I absolutely HATE when I get sandbagged and the killer throws me back on the hook. Now, I can't blame them for going for the win but it seriously grinds my gears that I'm being punished directly for something out of my control. So as a killer, I will purposely avoid the farmed because I'm not inconsiderate and won't subject others to something I dislike myself. But that's just me.
---
Thank you you're awesome
---
The worst part is I didn't even know
---
I'm not ignoring the situation, I know it exists. It's just that the streamer should just make a joke out of it and maybe the stream snipers wouldn't stream snipe more because the streamer wouldn't give a fuck. When you start making a big deal out if it they want to do it again because they had fun pissing oyu off.
---
Dance with me you're using lithe, great combo.
---
Agreed. I main Miss Piggy and see the issues. Until today I'd no idea why my Franklin's Demise often didn't seem to work. I didn't know it no longer worked with the ambush attack. I bring that perk in to get back at those Survivors who hide around corners with ultra flashlights to use on me when I pick a Survivor up, or just to use on me for the sake of it. I think the main issue with Piggy is how non-threatening the reverse bear traps can be a lot of the time. It's one less Survivor working on a gen for sure but I've noticed most of the time the traps are off really quickly. I was farming with some Survivors today and witnessed them all remove the traps on their first attempt and that was with good add-ons. By dafault I think the timer's a bit too slow and doesn't activate soon enough. I also think the traps should by default causes a status condition, maybe increase bleeding and slow down healing. If they're going to be that quick and easy to remove at least make having them cause some sort of issue for Survivors. Alternatively, failing at least two skill checks to remove the trap either cuts the time in half or causes it to activate right away.
---
I doubt a community make killer would be very balanced.
---
You’re a real one if you use spine chill
---
I'm the same as grim, generally try to play the best (to my ability) in a team aspect, unhooking  (safely not farming), heal where needed and do as many gens as i can. I'm horrible with looping, but I do generally try to help the team as much as possible.
---
Is that so? Huh news to me.
---
And yet you still find a way to defend the snipers. Guess rape victims just shouldn't dress so "slutty" and they wouldn't be raped, right? Fucking hell, good bait though. You got me good.
---
Oh no Ace look out!!! There’s a spooky guy behind you!!!!!!!
---
Yikes.
---
No problem. Plunder’s doesn’t do anything besides range when you level it up but AitH is a must rank 3. Had a hatch clutch earlier with a purple key I found
---
Yo I wish it worked like that
---
yep, on PC you have Trapper, Wraith, Billy, Nurse and Huntress
---
😂😂😂
---
The references in here I like it
---
Do I have to break down and explain everything to you? Are you really that incapable of understanding points and comparisons? Ok, here we go. 
---
The streamer is the victim in the situation, as is the rape victim. The sniper is the perpetrator, as is the rapist. Now, by defending the sniper and saying they shouldn't be banned, but the streamer should instead implement things he shouldn't have to do, you are defending the sniper, as you would be defending a rapist should you say the victim could have done something to stop it. 
---
Do you understand now? Can you atleast comprehend that without saying "ThEyRE 2 DiFfErENt ThiNgs!"
---
you know, if you cant pay those 5€ you can always buy her with iridiscent shards for free
---
Nooooo camper, you shall not pass!😂
---
How's life?
---
But I feel like its bugged right now, sometimes it takes over 10 seconds if you stand right in Front of him while he uses no add ons
---
true, but yet again, why should i have to work to get a perk that can make the game playable?  
---
its kinda a plaster fix to the bigger problem
---
Like why is haunted ground getting activated every time.. no one checks the generator if you have a ruin. Never. Ahh, and when I saw someone cleansing a haunted ground, I tried to get them to me, but they never learn😂 
---
Well it it best to get rid of it in the start of the game. Right?
---
Because they are two different things. Having forced, unwanted sex (rape) is not the same as being stream sniped. Don't compare the two at all. You're literally making me think you just want answers at this point and if you compare two COMPLETELY different things again, I will not answer you. I don't listen to people like you.
---
Oh and one question... ik ur gonna lie but here we go: do u play enough legion?
---
I still don't understand how ghostface works. The abilities and all of that. He sees me no matter what
---
Only buy legion if you really really want discordance.
---
Otherwise.....literally any other killer.
---
This happened to me too xD but I died😂
---
looking forward, Nurse nerfs, Legions addons getting better (finally) And the focus on game Health over new stuff is really appreciated
---
Is wounded healer still glitched? Its the only trophy I need and havent seen anything in the patch notes about it!
---
Nobody seems to understand the amount of views this brings in over his usual views. Like, how dense are you redditors not to notice he gets double it not more views on videos with Toxic assholes in it. Its a win/win. Plus yall get salty, even better.
---
idk, I rarely use Ruin (currently only in purple ranks cause I dont play that much anymore)
---
And the only Killer that imo needs Ruin is the Trapper. Im doing pretty good without it on my Mains, Legion and Huntress
---
This post is officially outdated
---
Wow someone actually asked if they will add a swf indicator? The entire point of dedicated servers is to hide the presence of swf so killers can't dodge them as easily.
---
This gave me a unnecessary amount of anxiety...
---
Nice😊
---
go lose your rank if you do that.
---
that feeling when haunted ground would destroy 4 totems when cleansed
---
You know a community is trash when it's still recycling the same memes from almost 2 years ago. Almost as bad as the Warframe community at this point.
---
Hello is that you are going rework mettle of man because this perk is too hard to activate and played
---
Try to save someone for not being hooked in the basement, by using head on😉
---
No, I just don't listen to people who act like two completely different things are exactly the same.  I never said rape victims should wear different clothes anywhere in our argument.  You must be in a different thread than I'm in.
---
u/taylorswiftsfatcock
---
So that means all stream snipers are rapists?
---
Well done😁
---
Except you're listening right now. Oh you didn't "say it" but you insinuated it. If you believe the streamer/victim should be the one to change their ways against the sniper/rapist rather than the latter being punished.
---
idk man, I was always fine without it, even in Red ranks.
---
Of course, sometimes you just get gen rushed to shit, but most of the Time its fine
---
If I don't get Sundowner as a killer with the heartbeat being replaced with his theme song I'm rioting.
---
😂😂
---
I'm in this group and thought the exact same. 😅
---
Can you please address the issue of people manually quitting when people are caught on consoles.
---
Or he can ask reddit on the subreddit that's sole purpose is to ask questions and discuss the game. But then he will have to deal with pricks like you are just miserable and wanna be a jerk all the time for no reason.
---
I like how my comment got downvoted bc I like the hat bc its pink. I've never watched any of her videos.
---
I was wondering if it drives killers to drop survivors. That could produce some nice saves.
---
I never understood the gen rush, do you really like to finish the game ASAP? Haha weird.
---
Well i appreciate you taking the time to talk about this. I love this game to bits but goddamn, its gonna die soon if they dont do something about it
---
Shirtless Davids terrify me as killer. They always know what they're doing.
---
Did you have fun?
---
Thanatophobia is trash on anyone.
---
WHY THE FUCK CAN KILLERS HIT ME WHEN IM.DIRECTLY BEHIND THEM. ITS BULLSHIT AND IM JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE MAN. ALSO WHY THE FUCK CAN YOU HIT THROUGH THE FENCE IN HADDONFIELD EVEN IF THERE NO WINDOW UGHHHHHHHH.
---
God people like you boil my blood. Such a fucking dickhead.
---
Meters
---
YES !! I love it
---
Yeah I agree with you on the "lawyer talk". I appreciate them creating an AMA thread, but let's be honest here; I didn't expect anything enlightening from neither the questions, or the answers.
---
I can only imagine how poorly they would implement the rain and lightning to make me get 5 fps during it
---
What does NOED means? ^^
---
Never Strikes Twice seems like a superpowered Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
Or get a good writer to improve on the cheesy shit and leave some of it in. I find the creepy pasta aspect of the lore to be pretty endearing, I just want more details!
---
This is amazing.
---
Lmao
---
I played him to get the trophy that's all.
---
A perk called "No One Escapes Death" NOED is just the short term for it. Basically when the exit gates are powered, all survivors suffer from the exposed status effect and can be downed with one hit. It’s a pretty toxic perk that most killers have in their perk builds.
---
I’d be so happy if they cancelled mobile DBD all together and put that effort literally anywhere else. Who plays a game like this on their fucking phone ? I turn my lights off and put on a headset or I can’t even focus. It’s so dependent on sound &amp; being able to see details.
---
I’m pissed I haven’t gotten him yet
---
Legacy is scary to me but that's it.
---
Hi bored I'm dad
---
Some people would rather the 5k from escaping easily than the 5+k from playing the rest of the game.
---
Do we have to rank up bill to get borrowed time, unbreakable and the last one to be teachable to my others?
---
Don't forget Hangman's Trick. a perk that's useless 99% of the time, but if you happen to face a sabo squad, a hilarious hard counter to their entire plan.
---
I will destroy your bloodline
---
“Let’s all join hands and sing the praise of the lord! Let everyone share the warm embrace that I aim to bring the world. Even if I’m not a huge fan, I let people have fun!”
---
conclusion: friend. after this clip i got the cabin gen while he was chasing the other survivor and after he sacrificed her he let me do the last gen and get the Left for Dead Achievement.
---
You accidentally didn’t reply and actually commented separately from the other convo you were having on this post. Telling you Incase you want to copy and paste this comment to the reply.
---
Yeah. But we can dream.
---
Why does it matter I’m new to the game
---
Huuuu...
---
REEEEEE
---
The darkest one
---
At this point I think he enjoy these stream snipers. They give him nonstop content and the snipers have their fame by being acknowledge and talked about every game. Just look at this thread, this must be the third or fourth one regarding this situation in the last 24 hours.
---
Lets be honest, tru3 is always complaining about something anyway and he always thought he was being stream sniped or playing against 4 man SWF. At least this time is for real.
---
Streaming is a hobby even if you treat it as a job. If a company is not paying you to stream, it isn't a job. Tru3 is not forced to do viewer requested builds, he wants to.  He isn't payed to win with those builds either. He's payed to use the builds. 
---
The devs won't do anything because it's not their problem and there's no 100% accurate way to tell if someone is stream sniping or not.
---
That's fair I guess that was a stupid question lol, that's a hard spot to be in other than banning people I dont think they'd be able to do much for him? I dont really know though of course
---
when last gen is done  killer can 1 shot healthy survivors and gets a speed boost. A lot of lower/newer survivors think its stupidly overpowered. If they stick with the game for like... maybe 500 hours they will get its not.
---
Oh yeah i got you dude :) https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Doctor-Wallpaper-761231291
---
In this case wait till someones just been hit by the killer so exposed has minimal value, then just wait it out and roll in the BP's baby!!
---
Ohh so I needed to not be on my phone lol. Fucking wild
---
When a Male survivor interacts with a female survivor they are put into the dying state and can be Mori'd
---
It’s the 3 across any chases, and what happens is when the third one gets slammed the survivor after a couple of seconds will get the ability, not immediately. Also looping may still be possible even if the ability is still on, but it will take there speed down dramatically which will help if your getting looped over and over again.
---
I read the whole thing, thank you for the link !!
---
Dang dude I saw the stalking part after reading the story and thought oh boy another stalker but then i thought " huh a killer idea that obscures Vision and audio... Brilliant" I looked at the perks and never strikes twice sounds broken as hell. Although it may never be in the game and might sit in the never ending pits of reddit I love this idea
---
I'm so lucky I dont play much killer, when I get adepts I end up facing a potato group sooner or later lol, good for you man!
---
ITT - survivor uses decisive strike against a new killer who wasn't very good at chases yet
---
Nerf Nurse discussion after the weather
---
20% is hella drastic lmao there won't be no looping going on after that.
---
Gotta remember, killers walk 15% faster then survivors, so increasing that to a big ol 35% is going to end that chase in 20 secs or less, unless the killer is literally a potato.
---
What’s that third perk do
---
There is a perk call No One Escapes Death that activates  the last gen is done and if there are dull totems on the map left. The user below described its effects. Haunted Grounds is a perk that lights up two totems. Cleansing one makes your team go down in one hit for a about a minute.
---
Tunnel vision on a particular survivor.
---
username does not check out
---
He won't ignore them is one of the problems. Just play the game normally and don't acknowledge them and their attention whoring will dry up.
---
Freddy main here. Thanataphobia was good on Freddy before the rework as long as you kept survivor’s asleep and hit them and chose your chases wisely. But now that they took my favorite power from him (seeing survivors auras outside of the terror radius) I prefer pop goes the weasel after someone suggesting it to me in here. But in my mind he was good before the rework. I would run thanataphobia, ruin, remember me, and noed. I would protect my ruin and continuously put to sleep survivors and hit them. The stacking of my dream power regressing their action time, ruin, and thanataphobia was absolutely disgusting. Lol but imo if you wanted to use thanataphobia in its best form you missed it mate. I am sorry.
---
I'm so glad this won.
---
Myers 👍🏼
---
Lol, yeah. If this ever gets added (hypothetical) I know someone will face camp as a dude who’s a hunter 😂.
---
That's an upvote for you.
---
First of all, send this to blumhouse. Second of all, how did they ever almost make that movie, such a mismatch lol.
---
Mmmm I can just taste the sadness
---
Yeah seems useless, most of Freddy’s addons are garbage
---
Myers, even though he's my nemesis, is the funnest to go against for me.
---
Most frustrating would be Spirit. It is such a chore to face her. I don't DC because I'm not that type of guy, but I generally don't enjoy games against her.
---
Jokes on you, the bloodweb has yet to give me ruin on my nurse still!
---
If you're a Gen jocky or immersed and don't go for altruism then yes, its trash. or if the killer has insidious and camps hooks
---
The higher level you are, the most Iridescent Shards you are rewarded. Devotion doesn't increase you Iridescent Shards output though. Infact, when you reach Devotion x and your Player Level is rested to Level 1, you are granted the same amount of Iridescent Shards that you would've been given at Level 1 and no Devotion.
---
This image is the exact emotion I feel when I see a lit totem.
---
In that case here’s a survivor build I made up. 
---
I call it the Good Noodle build and it’s meant to get iridescent emblems:
---
Technician: Muffles gen sounds so the killer will be less likely to check your gen, ergo getting lightbringer
---
Diversion: Encourages survivor to keep near the killer for the Evader emblem, can be switched out for urban evasion
---
Sprint burst/any exhaustion perk: helps with chases, mainly to get evader and unbroken emblems
---
We’ll make it: helps with the Benevolent emblem
---
These perks can pretty much get switched out with anything tbh but the goal of the build is to have 1 perk help with 1 badge.
---
Even with perks that slow down the game, generators get repaired very fast. Honestly if you walk away with one of two sacrifices at high rank, that's a win.
---
No showing names (rule 3). You have to blur the name if someone does something like that.
---
The Huntress fills me with so much dread whenever I am playing. I have no idea why she freaks me out so badly.
---
ty so much
---
You mean everyone wants to play the hot new killer. You don't say. Jeez give it time people will get bored and go back to their old mains once the newness wears off like with plague and GF
---
JUST GOT THE GAME AND IVE BEEN FACING KILLERS THAT HAVE PLAYER RANK 12 AND WITH NO PERKS SO IDK IF THIS IS NORMAL OR NAH.
---
Overcharge and huntress lullaby work almost as well as ruin if not in certain situations even better. Overcharge is not a hex perk meaning it wont ever be cleansed and you can use it with every kick and huntress lullaby effects all actions, healing, repairing sabotaging etc. Overcharge is almost Bi weekly in the shrine and huntress lullaby comes free. And you could grind shards for the killers.
---
Everything else though I agree with.
---
Honestly the teleporting is what new Fred boys will have to focus on. But since they changed him I went back to wraith tbh. Lol
---
I am so gay for them both
---
thank ya mate
---
WHY DO LITERALLY ALL FREDDYS SLUG?
---
I wasn’t dissing on people dude, I was just making a point about how I’d like to go against someone different. I understand reworks and people wanting to play a killer works. Calm
---
Interesting! I would like to see what others have to say.
---
So is this a teachable perk?
---
“Nice 2 hexes”
---
Like hexes are good??? What???
---
I was wondering why he was downvoted to hell. Pretty stupid if you ask me
---
wh...Why is a nurse camping?
---
Poor Pukey girl
---
Exactly! Playing around with build and came to that one. So easy to counter yet so many fail to do it, and get salty for it lol...
---
New Freddy or old Freddy?
---
Dude
---
Nope nevermind. I just played a game where a Clown tunneled me so now Clown is a garbage F tier killer and if you play him you deserve the death penalty.
---
It’s happened a few days ago but not too often
---
I’ve been getting it more than twice a day
---
Ascendence: When playing with over 2000+ ping and get downed, immediately leave the trial.
---
Honestly the only reason I get for why people don't use head on is because people don't understand the stun area. It feels inconsistent to players making it underused. Although I think it was noob3 who had a highlight where a killer got chain head on'd. Funniest thing I've seen in a while
---
I've never seen a killer main on here who supports that
---
you dont need to think it out when youve got so many you can literally put one by every real pallet and force survivors to guess
---
Haunted grounds could be thrown in just to deter them away from seeing more than 1 lit totem if its a SWF but if not thrill works well for a fast moving killer, like hag.
---
Lithe is my second favourite exhaustion perk. My favourite is Head On for the memes. It’s so much fun
---
They're just bored and want a little drama for the moment
---
It doesn't work as often because with the sound changes, survivor uninjured breathing is so much louder now, but generally yes.
---
Urban Evasion works great for making sure a killer who doesn't know you're there can't see you, there are lots of times I'd have been caught if I hadn't been able to move full speed while crouching behind things that would reveal me if I stood up.
---
Rule number 674 never camp last gens if they close together
---
I’m not really a totem player tbh. Sometimes I’ll run something like Ruin but that’s pretty rare for me to do. I like the fast pace games where you gotta be on point to win. It’s intensity that really gets me into the killer role. Even though I main survivor
---
You just lost all credibility
---
Megs carnie hair, carnie too and her mauve presentation pants
---
For me it was this one Myers player on Gideons. He was doing max terror radius with infinite T3 and unnerving presence. It was hard to do gens between the tiny skillchecks and him patrolling efficiently with his instant down.
---
Targeting a Survivor who was just rescued from a hook. With them being injured and coming off the hook means its only a 1 hit down before theyre in dying state and can be hooked again
---
Well, you’re gonna accuse me of either lying or being a noob depending on what I say so I’m just not gonna answer
---
Key
---
they probably had the key and opened it and tried to bring the others to the hatch if no one escaped. Then once you close it the end game starts and i think it automatically opens again (unless another person had a key too)
---
I don't see why he can't just put some kind of layout over his game so snipers can't know exactly when to queue into him? Such a simple fix my god
---
Last night's HybridPanda video...
---
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
---
Takes me 6 or 7 tries JUST to get into a SWF lobby on ps4 for some days now but today it seemed to be fixed (ps4 btw)
---
wraith and trappers are the exact same, I think they should be updated though for sure
---
No
---
I’m on ps4 too
---
On PC she is. On console, well...
---
Aha welll ummm... Huntress??
---
Thanks man. Didn’t think the key did that.
---
Oh fuck that is horrifying
---
Trust me it be like this, I had a round playing hag for a daily and apparently for tunneling the David i killed he spammed me messages while in the same round to annoyed me and also for some reason he tried to threaten me with spoiling end game.
---
A survivor told me that he was going to tell all his friends not to play with me.
---
Nothing changed.
---
This is probably the same.
---
I only got that because I was playing nurse (on console) because I was bored of rounds and rounds of Billy, so I played her for like the 7th time, put on her perks, swf. They were overaltruistic. Yay.
---
It takes &gt;3s to record with the console.
---
Ghostface; City Slicker, Bloody Ghost Face and Wet Tactical Knife.
---
People that suggest this, have you never heard of MLGA? This is how they are pretty much guaranteeing they get in tru3's lobby, even when he hides the screen completely.
---
Techies next killer please.
---
You may not like it - but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
MLGA
---
it's almost as if it doesn't fucking matter you bowl of cabbage
---
Yes it does
---
I honestly thing “rank” should be altered... like i think thats the reason ppl are so salty most times  .. there’s literally no gain from ranks but i still think it should be removed.. people think they playing for money or something lol its hilarious the amount of salty rage msgs i get at green to purple ranks.. only a few people laugh it off geez man
---
Yes, they hide.
---
I wish I was facecamped by you ; -;
---
the legion rework is hardly a rework, it was just a big fat nerf. now they're pretty underpowered
---
Tsun-Spirit would be amazing, she's at least Huntress tier.
---
Nurse though? Like Nurse fanart is amazing, but don't forget that the Nurse basically has a crushed throat and ended up in a car accident that crushed/killed everyone else, she's more of a corpse than the Spirit is.
---
I don't think I could tap that under any condition, the wheezing kills my lady-boner.
---
It might lead people to harass the guy because he's in a clip showing him in a bad way. It's better to report him than show his name.
---
Honestly who cares.
---
Who does man lol its mindgame central against her... nobody’s ever sure where she at lol
---
He was spectating
---
Metalcore
---
I like how she's running away like OH GOD NO
---
Ah
---
*Ive got places to go*: After getting put into the dying state, ascend to the heavens for 5/7/10 seconds. During this period, the killer and other survivors are unable to interact with you.
---
Stridor is the weakest. It has its uses for Wraith and Spirit but your better off with other perks.
---
Nurse's is great, especially on small/no TR killers or against cocky survivors. It is my choice out of the 3
---
Whispers is the best of the 3 especially the fewer survivors there are and at endgame. Personally I never bother with it as survivors either want to get in a chase so they'll just work on gens til you get there or they try and hide and any decent killer will find them in short order.
---
I think they are both trash in high rank. But hella fun to play
---
Cool concept but sounds like a nightmare on my GPU
---
I actually like Dream Snares more.
---
The cool skins are obviously the ones they want to make money off of / you have to pay for with real money
---
Moat frustrating: doctor &amp; legion 
---
Fun: A bad nurse, billy that dont use M1 and a T1 myres
---
Why that floor sticky tho hmmm
---
I wish they made it so X are given for free then the other X make you need to break pallets to place more so you have to make a decision on where to place pallets.
---
Lol I knew someone was going to make a joke about that
---
Better lunges?
---
Repair penalties?
---
Speed boost?
---
Blindness?
---
A Tenacity David a day keeps the Plague away
---
Ok and literally what else are survivors supposed to do other than gens?
---
what about when it is end game and there is 1 injured survivor and you only have an m1? what are you supposed to do? down them and tunnel? just let them go?
---
If you want a worse Myers that can tbag, then yeah
---
imagine old DS in base kit lmfao
---
If the game didn't start you don't have a chance of being suspended
---
legion is S tier wdym? ;)
---
You're welcome! What I do if I think I might have gotten in the locker too late is to leave locker as soon as the hook aura goes away so he can't see me anymore then walk away and hope that he comes to check the locker and by then I'm long gone and he's wasted some time checking and searching the immediate area.. that or I'll leave the locker on purpose before the hook aura disappears so he see's me leave the locker but I just go right back in and hope for the best
---
Nea.
---
It can be around the edges of the map, but I would check inside buildings as well, the only place it can't spawn is the basement (and if you're on the game it can only spawn on the lower level)
---
Most of the time it happens when the games already started
---
I actually find him a lot more fun then Myers
---
being literally almost invisible on most maps is pretty toxic
---
Or like. A friend they want to play with? It's not always nefarious jfc
---
He is a bit better than myers to a certain extend. Myers got better addons.
---
Looks like he had a fantasy about giving that raincoat kid from little nightmares a growth spurt
---
I JUST WANT TO PLAY AGAINST SURVIVORS THAT ARE MY OWN RANK. FIGURE OUT A FUCKING WAY TO CUT OUT THE SMURFING. THIS IS NOT FUN. **FUCK. **
---
The humming, it’s like an indicator that she’s getting closer and it’s extra scary
---
I see it all the time so I’m not sure where you’re looking
---
&gt;* DBD implements a stream mode where the game has a different overlay that can be activated when capture software comes up. It makes it where the perks and addons, as well as the killer, are hidden. If Discord can do it, so can BE.
---
Why would they waste time, resource and effort doing this when people can do it themselves? Just change scenes on OBS. 
---
&gt;* If they really are using a third party software to directly alter the game experience to give themselves an unfair advantage then that is the most basic definition of cheating. If they are using a software then surely there is evidence of it on BE's side, whether it be connection anomalies or otherwise because sheer odds and player count do not make sense for the amount of games they are in. Ergo, ban them on the grounds of using a third party software that directly augments the manner in which the game performs. Even if they do ban them the worse that will happen is they give BE more money, waste their own time, and then they can get banned again.
---
what the fuck... You just forgot one little detail, how do you prove it? Also, they could just snipe to get in his lobby and not watch his stream during the match, how would you prove otherwise?
---
Some people are... "brilliant".
---
As a gay man, I can honestly say at this point I wouldn’t mind a shirtless Huntress. Just saying. 
---
“Hit me Mommy” is much funnier. Lmfao
---
I mean, if I get some silly ideas (and time) then yea... why not
---
Then whats the point of collision?
---
What one calls trash, another calls a culture of fine arts
---
Only if you plan to use his power for good...I mean evil, but use it goodish...good-like? Of a good nature...you know what I mean! 😅
---
If only Europe knew that
---
Then you might have a chance of being suspended unless it only happens a few games.
---
It happens at least once everyday
---
Lol this is why i never post shit to this group, always get brain dead replies like this
---
Nice touch that they're level 50.
---
I think Doctor and new Freddy (at least with the pallets) are S tier. I love playing as both of them.
---
If you’re going to remove collision on hatch might as well remove collision altogether.
---
I was trying to make an ICP joke due to how "4king" can be read as "fucking" : ( [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFabsRFnWy0)
---
Then you’re fine. You won’t be suspended
---
also would like if he opened it the old way, cause the way he currently handles the trap looks odd
---
Litterally all op as hell
---
This is from his channel:
---
[HIDE YOUR SCREEN TO AVOID SNIPERS THEY SAY](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/455626003)
---
He’s right, the community is a dumpster fire that reeks of cum ridden individual giving killers cringe inducing names such as “vommy mommy” and “shirtless Myers” all which are just proving how much this game needs to die. 😁
---
That makes me feel better
---
Which perks would you run on your survivor/killer? Which one is the most op?
---
I see you are a man of refined tastes
---
Not to excuse rushed games but most AAA games are broken POS the first week or two after release. Grand Theft Auto 5 Online was ass at first, same with most big shooters, usually these big multiplayer games take a week or two to stabilize
---
I dare say she is a E cup. Umm 54"

This is incredible

Current perks or out of these?

I think it was the drunk episode with monto and tofu

It’s daddy Myers. Let us enjoy the memes the community makes. It lets us forget how sweaty and toxic everyone is at this rage inducing game

I wouldnt have build. If these were in the game id uninstall lmao

If you're not rank 20, stop running deliverance. You will get rescued on your first hook, you're essentially robbing your team of altruism and now you're broken (and probably hiding, doing nothing) for 60 seconds.
---
Did you also kill lions in the Savannah using only a spatula and a bottle of vodka?

I have deliverance when I’m on SWF so I tell them don’t get me I have deliverance.

Locker Dwighto
---
Did you center him in your screen? Was he too far away? Was he obstructed by an object or person?
---
What do you mean 3 genning? I’m pretty new to the community but i played quite a bit last year. Tryna learn the ways of the gods
---
Biology of course
---
He was about 3 metres in front of me and I was staring directly at him, no obstruction
---
And other time you can reveal him when he hides behind wall. Its so inconsistent.
---
Was he using the addons them at make it harder to reveal him?
---
*laughs in console*
---
MLGA doesn't matter tho???
---
Even if tru3 gets them again he can just dodge and wait a minute before queuing again, unless he plays at rank 1 where you go against the same 5 people anyways it shouldn't be that hard
---
No clue, but I was staring directly at him so why would it matter?
---

Haha git gud salty survivormain 🤣🤣🤣

---
I dunno what to say about it, games pretty buggy, and GF has had his fill with bugs and adjustments. Hopefully just a one-off situation.
---
u/northwastedx I toned them down. Better?
---
I would like to have the full-sized picture of the dude with the gun if you got it and don't mind sharing.
---
Google isn't being exactly cooperative in finding a non-watermarked one.
---
I think I’m really proud of this game so much because not only was it so ridiculously quick but i had all of them down and would be able to put them on the hooks. I’d appreciate any tips if you guys notice anything wrong that i did in the video!
---
I've always wanted a killer whose power is just shooting his load everywhere lol
---
The only thing worse than advertising a channel instead of content is telling people to promote and subscribe to it.
---
I can confirm I have a list, but it's for people who personally BM'd me to the point I actually felt like shit for a few days. AFAIK there's no "Bounty Board" for everyone.
---
He is playing at rank 1, yeah. Which makes it even harder to "prove" stream sniping since the killer population is limited.
---
Monto Survivor videos. Practice my friend.
---
Thank you, I suppose I’m a bot.

He spent all match thinking

Surely someone will come down here eventually

Thanks my friend! Superb job again!
---
She has potential, not the worst, not the best. Like half of the killer lmao.

I'm gonna make it life hell

Yeah, that's a perk I want

I'M ANNOYED AT SURVIVORS ACCUSING ME OF TUNNELING WHEN THE SURVIVOR IS LITERALLY JUST RUNNING DIRECTLY TOWARDS ME
---
I underatand your point, and i agree that overcharge is indeed a good perk. But if a survivor pays attention and can hit the skillchecks both perks become usless
---
It doesn't stack with decisive you dumbass
---
He's saying it doesn't stack, hes not saying it didn't give him points
---
Lol we know man these posts are constant
---
YOU DAUGHTER NOW!
---
it is indeed
---
My proudest fap
---
My last match I chased a fresh Nea in a SWF off a hook since her friend ran into one of my traps (which had honing stone). Hit her in front of a locker, get DS'd, but that's fine. Suddenly she enters the locker. I remember she had Head On from earlier in the game. Oh god no get out of the stun trapper. Oh god he's wearing airpods he can't hear us. Oh god oh fuck-
---
I’m ashamed I never saw that before now
---
And it would work great with perks like BBQ for obvious reasons, and perks like surveillance and discordance to make sure you get maximum potential from the perk
---

Camping bad tho

Pig is not a trash killer. her power helps her mindgame loops and she has stealth and a mechanic to stall the game. killers like leatherface, trapper and wraith are trash instead and are worse, change my mind.
---
They cringe af
---
I don’t mind playing against the doc it’s just annoying when he shocks u even in tier 3
---
No one cared who I was uniting I put on the mask
---
Lol why would you mark this official?
---
And great insight definitely some fresh takes
---
I mean we basically already have a topless Hag skin, actually multiple. Lisa is a huge fan of free the nipple.
---
Love the atmosphere this would create, but I can't get behind making another weak killer.
---
This power...
---
* Doesn't help you down survivors faster.
---
* Doesn't help you get around the map.
---
* Doesn't help you track survivors.
---
* Doesn't buy you time.
---
* *Might* help you sneak up on survivors, but I'm not even so sure about that.
---
If the power was revised with actual, concrete benefits behind each of the tiers, it'd be amazing, but if you're just gonna rely on survivors getting disoriented and running into walls after their screens go white for a split second, this seems pretty ass.
---
Honestly, I get it. The frustration of SWF. 
---
But running decisive strike isn’t toxic.  Pre DS sure.  But the rework is an anti tunneling perk and very situational. If a killer gets hit by it that’s not the survivors fault.   It’s different during end game when there’s nothing else left to do but to camp, but again, if they get saved and hit DS that’s how they survived. They survived because that’s their objective. 
---
Body blocking, yeah shitty. 
---
But the frustration wouldn’t have been so bad if you didn’t initially camp the first survivor so early on.  That’s my opinion.  And to camp them just because they popped your Huntress Lullaby. Again, shitty, but those who play killer know it’s a matter of chance they’ll get it or not. 
---
This game isn’t worth your mental health being tampered with friend. It is what it is. You win some, you lose some.
---
I think Freddy's snares are recycled from an OG Hag add on that made her unable to teleport to her phantasms and instead they slowed people down.
---
It was bad then, and it is bad now lol
---
Emojis detected.
---
Lol I’m sorry if you guys like him. No problem with that. Just the first couple videos I saw he didn’t show the rank at end match. Maybe if you cherry pick and find specific ones? But the two I picked he seemed very adamant about not showing that rank menu at the end game lobby.
---
Idk why but almost every time I play legion I get at least 3-4 kills, I think it may be because I use sloppy butcher which is a great perk for legion btw!
---
Needs some concrete benefits behind each of the tiers.
---
Otherwise, he's just gonna get bullied since the power does pretty much nothing other than look cool.
---
Female shirtless fuck yea I wanna see some nurse and huntress tits
---
yeah it's retarded sometimes literally can't reveal him when your on top of him some times
---
Are you on PS4? And if so, what’s your psn so I can fucking avoid you.

I've seen Torbjorn's summer skin, so no I wouldn't get hot and bothered but would still like clownkini 😂

Lmao ok meanwhile you go out of your way to make an account and post what's already been said a million times a day with 0 insight. Sound really intelligent man.
---
You went into a locker and couldn’t move once you got out or?
---
She would still have chain blinks, just she would have a cooldown on blinking
---
While nobody deserves to be sniped as hard as tru3 has been lately, it doesn’t help that he makes “ 4 MAN SWF STREAM SNIPE TOXIC ON FARM MAP DESTROYED BY BILLY” kinda eggs them on lmao.
---
Everybody gangsta til the Bill is a madman.
---
You really do not learn do you bud.
---
You can actually check who's in your game on ps4 if you look at who's in your game session before the game starts and figure out who's not a survivor. That's kind of a lot of work though so I never bother but I just recently found out you actually can.
---
I'm a survivor main, killer maybe 1 in 10 games. For a very long time, I was in the majority you're referring to (ballpark 75%). But now the only perks I *always* run are self care and noed. There's a handful I rotate through (empathy, alert, ds, ruin, spies from the shadows) but I've been trying to shake things up lately. Distortion is way cooler than I originally gave it credit for. And I recently unlocked bbq+chili... (I wept.)
---
Remember when this sub was crying when old legion got reworked
---
No I’m quite new
---
It would be too op I can’t play with only 1 hand

Facts
---
finally someone realizes this shit. facts
---
yeah i went out of my way to make an account that took less than a minute. big inconvenience. i dont need to be intelligent when i got nuts as big as this. get off this dick. damn tool.
---
All this time, I thought it was a reference to 110% movement speed killers as opposed 115% movement speed killers.
---
I like to let people live when I'm killer (about half the time). Some killers just wanna party!
---
Thats why i bring BT for killers like you
---
im gonna go to sleep ill reply to your tool ass when i wake up
---
I ran a legion around the map for two minutes while ruin was active. Only one gen got done. I only used 2 pallets, 1 of which wasn’t even a stun. I only vaulted 3 times. Needless to say, we had a staring contest. At rank 6. YYYYYYY
---
Since you are still new to the game I would like to let you know the game wasn’t designed to Let survivors be a specific “role” player. However that would be nice if survivors picked a role similar to LoL, I actually thought about that earlier today. 
---
You do need to learn looping. Also one important thing I like to tell people is you have to learn how to chase the killer because taking agro is a big part of the game. A lot of new players make the mistake of “I will try not to be seen the entire match”. Also if you see someone being hooked you need to gauge the situation. Running to a hooked survivor every time/trying to figure out an angle to run to them is hurting your team in the long run if you’re not adamant about doing gens while thinking about these things. All-in-all I just would like to say when anyone has about as much experience as you have they think they’re making the best possible decisions when in reality they’re wasting a lot of time.
---
Damn that was good
---
Run iron will.
---
Oh that's interesting!
---
Wait.. Hag.. No. Hag traps never slowed down did they?
---
Also even if they did, Freddy doesn't have to place them like Hag so he doesn't slow down
---
It's not that hard to mind game with her you just stand still and pretend you're phasing
---
I don't think so
---
He’s commented on every comment thread of this post crying lmao.
---
Fact.
---
Dude it took me less than 30 seocnds to type that.
---
Flashlight saving is absolutely not toxic. Unless you're literally just following the killer around, blinding him just to be a dick and t-bagging him i don't see how using a flashlight is toxic.
---
A good survivor squad should be able to unhook even with a face camper
---
He could go get a real job then? Maybe? I dunno.
---
So? You still cared enough to comment and you keep replying. Thank you for caring so much :)
---
Nurse is not hard, though. All you need to know is your blink range(which I got a feel for quickly since I didn't use addons) and be able to predict where survivors will go.
---
Laurie had tier 1 DS, she'd not have made it if not for that waste of a pallet.
---
Lmao, I'm not saying he does, but it's still a recycled aspect of the game. I was monumentally disappointed when I released this, granted it is WAY better now with how they gave it to him, bit that doesn't change the fact that it's just an old Hag add on.
---
Also you gotta remember this was a much different game when Hag was released. 
---
I like the Snares on Fredward, but they're easily countered the way Clowns gas is countered, you just drop the pallets early. 
---
Is their an add-on for the snares that causes exhaustion? I can't check right now but if there is I'll change my mind on how useful they are
---
Spirt isn't easy I'm sorry. Headphones don't nsgically make you able to track, and by that logic you should be able to hear her too.
---
The only op thing are prayer beads.
---
Good survivors use the environment to dictate if shes phasing. Also a lot of survivors use spine chill. Unless you always look at the survivor the standing still trick barely works
---
Suvivior main spotted
---
most frustrating: spirit
---
most fun: billy or huntress
---
Gotta get em BP at least eh
---
Your brain is large like the corn lords pleasure blade
---
Got nothing better to do. Guess ill prove you wrong
---
Honestly i dont mind killers tunneling at the end of the game that's what Borrowed time and decisive are made for
---
Redditors should teach normies how to be a redditor we shouldn’t forget our roots
---
Because suviviors like you bitch for nerfs so no other killers be good
---
Good
---
True, perhaps she could have pulled an 360 on bubba
---
Fucking incredible. Not even just a cross map, over a fucking building too.
---
Hey thanks for coming and watching. :) Appreciated it
---
Yes, just got home and getting join game failure.
---
They're not gonna upload the gameplay where they get looped lol they're gonna post the games they do good
---
I didn't play back when Hag came out, I think I was around Pig release.
---
No exhaustion devs said they want to try and avoid that cause it's powerful.
---
Nah man Adams always unhook you but it’s only so they can get their deliverance
---
*gently humming The Cult*
---
It can work pretty well at dropped pallets
---
And wdym use the environment?
---
We can go eat and hope for the best when we come back 🤣
---
Did you look at him for 3 seconds not moving the screen?
---
That was so sad and truly disgusting.
---
rank 10 honestly isnt that good
---
GOD FUCKING DAMN IT EVERY FUCKING TIME I PLAY KILLER LATELY IT SEEMS THE SURVIVORS ARE PERFECTLY COUNTERING WHATEVER I DO:
---
* WHEN I PLAY TOP TIER THEY GENRUSH
---
* WHEN I PLAY DOCTOR THEY GENRUSH 
---
* ~~WHEN I PLAY TRAPPER~~ I DON'T PLAY TRAPPER BECAUSE SETTING UP FOR 3 GENS IS FOR PUSSIES AND I'D GET GENRUSHED
---
* WHEN I PLAY WAZZZAAAAA GUY THEY ALL STICK TOGETHER LIKE FUCKING SHEEPS AND GENRUSH
---
* WHEN I PLAY LEATHERFACE I ACTUALLY GET SOME NEAT GAMES AND I DON'T KNOW WHY I MENTIONED HIM
---
* WHY THE FOOK DO YOU KEEP DOING YOUR FUCKING OBJECTIVE WHEN UNHOOKING THOSE 2 POOR GUYS WOULD'VE GIVEN YOU DOUBLE THE POINTS YOU GOT FROM RUSHING THOSE 2 GENS? SEE? NOW THEY'RE IN STRUGGLE FASE! YOUR OBJECTIVE IS NOT JUST GENS YOU ASSHATS
---
I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE THAT PUT UP WITH MY RANT AGAINST DOING THE OBJECTIVE AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CHILL THE FUCK DOWN WITH THESE GENS
---
I thought the last one would be the dbd cover and I would have had to downvote, luckily you are a man of culture
---
Nope, prefer old legion over the new one.
---
She moves grass and you can hear her wind unless she has the add on to make her quiet. Shes really good on the game bc there is no grass
---
That's why I'm saying reduce the amount of pallets to like 5, but maybe give another effect. Maybe you can place them in locations to block off areas like walls. Maybe block off window vaults.
---
Add more thought into it and utility
---
You prefer broken unfun on both sides legion? I have to laugh 🤡
---
He gets so many snipers because he reacts so badly to them and they enjoy watching him rant about sniping for 10 minutes every time. He needs to learn to just throw on Omegablink with Ebony Mori and ignore their existence.
---
Thx baby! Love that you care so much!
---
Eat more anchovies
---
I'm sorry, I know you probably put a ton of work into this, but damn it it makes me so uncomfortable I can't not downvote it please spare my soul
---
**WHAT??! FIVE BLINKS!!???**
---
Ahh bummer, well still, I prefer the pallets over the snares, but they're not useless.
---
I could also be using them wrong, my trap placement is ingrained from maining Trapper an most of the time my snares don't yeild great results but I do chalk that up to my own playstyle.
---
the crippling tower of oppression will be put to an end by our blade!
---
Yuuuuuup! Great way to start out my stay-cation. Guess it’s back to bingeing Drag Race
---
I ate two 😂 died twice. I’m thinking I’ll do like the worlds hottest beef jerkin next. Need something gross to go with it
---
You say that but I have met her once in 100 hours
---
Yes because i want to live
---
You need 12 hooking events and 16 (?) M1s within the 15s after a chase starts to get Iridescent Emblem in two specific categories.
---
Depending on your rank will determine what medals you need to acquire to get the achievement. 
---
Ranks 1-4: 4 iridescent 
---
Ranks 5-12: 3 iridescent, 1 gold 
---
Ranks 13-20: 2 iridescent, 2 gold 
---
Winning quick isn’t enough anymore. You need to play well, hook everyone three times, don’t let too many gens get done, and don’t end chases too quickly.
---
Solid points tho, still a bummer to go 0k bit not a total loss, point wise it looks like it was a solid effort on all sides
---
Yup same here
---
Two posts about the same thing this is next level pissy
---
&gt; don’t end chases too quickly
---
On the contrary. You need to end chases ASAP with a M1, what you actually need to do is land a lot of M1s.
---
is this r/comedyheaven ?
---
Spirit isn't easy. It takes time to learn how to play her in higher ranks and you need to use things that take more skill (like predicting survivors) at times. Playing Spirit without sound is hard too. I've never heard of a bigger streamer hating Spirit as much as they did old Legion,  but ok.
---
Think they just cut the cord thinking it was a lamp.
---
Wishing someone to get laid is the lamest insult I can think of.
---
Well sice you can spam them, use them in loops and place like 4. They can also track
---
You can't hear phasing when you're close lol only outside of terror radius unless you mean outside of a chase

I bet you're fun at parties
---
You need to add one more dic to that
---
I agree, most killers I face don't face or proxy camp which makes the perk useless.
---
I prefer WMI over Borrowed time.
---
I mean I just played against her managed to lose her multiple times. I'd rather face spirit than a crazy good Billy or nurse

True

I got a Russian keyboard, and all I can say is "это не Я."

I really dislike PS4 is only having problems as well. I just wanted to play a bit of killer before I went to bed too :(
---
I like the idea. But listening to rain and lighting the whole game would make me sleepy
---
I'll give em a second chance an try spamming them to see if I do better.

Thanks for the tip 👍

I'm a survivor main (most of my playtime now is survivor) and I disagree about Spirit being OP. The only thing I find OP about her is prayer beads. She takes skill in higher ranks even if she is strong.
---
Adams, Dwights, Claudettes and Jeffs. Like play the goddamn game already
---
This is really cool
---
I like placing them as close to real pallets as possible so it becomes a guessing game.
---
Makes for great laughs.
---
Ok. Thank you
---
What's the news with legion?
---
It’s legion
---
He just needs to be faster while cloaked to keep pressure up. His power doesn't help in chases without addons, so they should just prioritize his strengths and let him switch targets and be where he needs to be faster.
---
Slow the game down just a... lot
---
Haha, always the Myers
---
But like did the dev's say something that i missed?
---
That's bad though. People could block actually good killers and get noob killers instead.
---
It’s the new patch, they needa fix their shit
---
For the summer event we never got

BT doesn't stop them from yoinking you an just drop slugging anyone who attempts to save.

You can actually see Plague before she was well, Plague! And a bit of Ghostface's face
---
Full man-sized Chucky would be weird and would lack authenticity, I think.  I agree, making him a bit bigger, but obviously smaller than the rest of the characters might work.
---
True. Maybe a safe medium can be found. His size is a big part of the creep factor.
---
Idk, he isn't that fun to play. Just kind of basic. Zapping people as Doc, however...
---
yep
---
Like: "Little Pig" Whenever you find a survivor in a locker, you are faster by 5%.
---
"Hex: Chaser" Everytime you chase a survivor, you also get faster. If you chase the same survivor 5 times, you get a Memento Mori.
---
"Unexpected" The Walker's Terror Radius is decreased by 12 meters.
---
"Stomper" The Walker can break pallets faster.

Survivor: “WE SURVIVORS NEED AS MUCH HELP AS POSSIBLE TO ALWAYS BE ABLE TO SURVIVE WHEN A KILLER DOESNT FOLLOW OUR RULES SO STOP WHINING AND GIT GUD GG EZ”
---
Honestly I’m so sick of getting bitched at by survivors because I killed them. If I didn’t do anything close to tunneling or camping a game something else is toxic that I’m doing. I literally got told I was toxic by using TWO Shape Teachables because of obsession meanwhile the 4-Man SWF that I absolutely clapped was using DS and all had flashlights and blinded me every single chance they got even if there was no reason to do so and T-Bagged every time I saw them. So many of them are entitled as hell and it makes all survivors look bad.
---
Just realized it did after waiting for 42 mins xD
---
Yeah no problem! Like I said none of my friends wanted it and I dont want it going to waste
---
I've noticed the most toxic tend to have standard clothing or only minor changes. Could just be me though.
---
Late gamers gang
---
Pig has the advantage of not really been played often so people get rusty going against her. God knows I was when I got one whilst messing around as survivor, forgot you can't just go to any box and be free 😑.
---
I play primarily Billy, Huntress and occasional Trapper.
---
Oh my
---
They still haven’t fixed the bbq auras that was supposed to be forever ago supposedly like late June wtf happened?!
---
Love the look and idea of them just wish they where more fun tbh. Not bad to mess around on though 😁 just don't expect to do to good most of the time.
---
YOU BECAME THE VERY THING YOU SWORE TO DESTROY!
---
Your advice has been super useful, I much appreciate it.  
---
I must ask why Wraith and Spirit get more mileage out of Stridor though?
---
If we're talking about the same hentai, then Doctor is ranked too low as well.
---
Can confirm this for PS4 too. First one of the 80XX error codes during connection in the main menu. I'm now past this, but now all games joined as Survivor disconnected with "not available anymore" after a couple of seconds
---
You must guard the gates even though if the survivor isn’t injured there is nothing you can do if they are anywhere near the exit. I’m kidding. If I hook someone and I hear your buddies around I’m not leaving.
---
We need details who sits where?
---
This guy really just wrote an essay in response to a *goddamn* LoTR's meme..
---
I spend 90% of the time as a solo survivor swearing, it's either toxic team mates been stupid or people doing random shit.
---
Soon as I go on killer against solos though it's another damn thing. Then I'm going up against seal team 6 😑.
---
*"EURGHHHH, GET AWAY"*
---
For real
---
What a dumbass lol
---
I was going to grind for it but it's such a "o shit" button that I have given up. Not bad of you are running a build to mess with killers and keep the team safe though.
---
Wow so much salt. Sorry you had to deal with some toxicity on your first match
---
We Dettes just out here trying to make it. The intro cut scene of dbd already puts us at a disadvantage by trying to insinuate that we are pathetic.😭
---
Don’t worry i am still trying to get my steam Id it’s really finicky
---
Actually no, you can see who the killer is before the game.
---
Mentally deficient? Just like the movies.
---
Wraith everything is kinda muted while cloaked and Stridor helps you hear survivors that might be hiding as you pass. Spirit you can hear survivors easier when you're phase walking, you can ditch the perk after enough playtime as her and you won't need it as much
---
Take your time! I’ll only give it to someone else if you don’t want it
---
My boy wraith over clapping survivor cheeks
---
depending on the leatherface, he's not a virgin
---
You know it works best when the killer camps hooks right? That’s literally the whole point.
---
Community? No. These people that recycle these posts that flood our timeline with useless shirtless Myers are the problem. If we had a vote to block one type of posts these would be gone
---
You cannot view peeks until the match is over. It was extremely unfair when swf could tell your teammates what perks the killer has.
---
This works way too well...
---
are you talking about the killers perk? they made it so it hides what add ons and perks the killer is using so dead survivors wont tell there friends there set up. they added it a while back
---
Emojis and a comment that adds nothing to the post.
---
Everyone downvote OP not because he reposted but because he wholeheartedly believes he created the image himself.
---
The idea of magician killer is interesting and cool, but his power is way too strong as it would place the survivors at a huge disadvantage (especially the teleportation. That’s absolutely wack). I would reduce the vanishing generators to 10%. Also the third perk will be too powerful on some killers due to the timed effect, and would make pallets completely useless when chases are needed. Maybe reduce the use for 12/14/16 seconds or approximately around that range.
---
Can I make huntress a non virgin
---
He can put dream snares down by default which slows you and makes you yell a la  doctor.  Alot of addons for him give him pallets instead of snares which let him put fake pallets around. In the dream world you will be affected by these, as well as only hear a lullaby when hes close.
---
*The Legend of Zelda Breath Of The Wild intensifies*
---
I think they’re more so willing to give our the license willy nilly for shit like this. I have some Myers socks and they are based off Halloween Resurrection as well.

Downfall and Huntress' lullaby would be horrifying.
---
Rip, has anything you said on this post and in the comments going positive?
---
Nice play!
---
Oh thanks, are the dream snares visible to me as a survivor if I'm in the dream? I think I recall seeing big red circles but im not sure
---
It was very effective
---
Simple, if I’m by myself I play killer and if some of the boys are on I play survivor.  People really should play both, it’s easy to accuse when you don’t know what the other side is like.

It was only my first killer match. I’d played survivor with my friends for a while before this

Yup. I swear some survivors just don't get it.  What are you supposed to do? Wander off and stand in a corner? Amazing how pissy some get when you deny them a teabag at an exit gate. PS I'm a survivor main.
---
One game, the killer was so passive that I genuinely didn't see him/her the entire game...
---
Game started.
---
First generator done.
---
Second generator done.
---
All the way till the last one.
---
Gate open, we get out.

End of the game.

I only learned at the very end that he was actually a Wraith but... Where was he for god's sake ?! He didn't do shit the entire game like no one got hurt or something...

A surprising amount of people DC when you have ruin, that or colorful neas try to get your attention with a flashlight, and get immediately downed and then DC Bc they’re not half as good as they think they are.

Personally, I dont think anyone is toxic for using items, perks, add-ons, or offerings, no matter what they are. Yes, NOED is a pain in the ass to play against, but thats why I always cleanse dull totems. Yes, Mori is no fun, but I try to play stealthy so I dont get caught early. Yes, purple flashlights sucks, but they are part of the game, and also part of the defense for a survivor. 
---
It's all about how you play, you have to change up your playstyle depending on what/who you play against. Thats also what makes it fun! 
---
As for abusing bugs, helping killer as survivor, dc'ing, all these things; this is making it almost impossible for others to play the game as intended. Its ruining the game experience, and is also why you can report this kind of behavior. 
---
Now for camping. I think camping is a last resort kind of thing, I understand why a killer would camp me if the exit gates are opened, and Im their last chance of getting a kill. But if Im the first to get hooked, and the killer camps me, I find it unfair, and I think the killer isnt playing the game as intended. I guess you could call camping a playstyle you have to adapt to, but when Im not playing in a SWF group, I almost always get left on the hook to die. 
---
This is just what I think! I usually always write "gg" or "wp" after a game, no matter what, and I only report people if they helped the killer, dc'd or abused a bug.
---
It was 4 gens left. They didnt do gens at all
---
So much effort put into this. And it’s glorious.

Oh ya that too. I didnt run into that one much tho
---
This is really clever.
---
Plus, those shattered limbs can go to places no complete ones can...
---
He said he read it and didnt quite get it.  Relax.
---
Oh that’s bad news, try submitting it as a bug on the website. Other than that just have to wait till Its patched.
---
Hey, if you're submissive, I bet someone like Huntress would be a gift from above.
---
As far as toxic playstyles go, I have played a lot or wraith myself I think I have only ever been called toxic on him a couple of time, but that was back when I didn't really understand how to abuse his movement speed to pressure gens correctly. So what would happen is I would without meaning to camp someone. I have have not used noed since I was a rank 20 killer, just don't think it is a fun perk (it rewards the killer for not pressuring and playing in a way to keep the gens from being done).
---
As far as build goes on him now, I run pop goes the weasel, ruin, BBQ, and make your choice.
---
So ya, as far as playstyles go on killer just don't camp, tunneling is a weird one because sometimes people actually just run into you, and then call it tunneling. But I run make your choice so it makes little sense for me to even pick them up if I hit them in that situation.
---
On the survivor side though, toxic playstyles is just pretty much abusing broken mechanics, such as wake up was, sprint burst(the glitch with it), things like that, where it is not working as intended.
---
The only other thing I can think of that is a toxic playstyle for the survivors would be farming teammates where you don't have borrowed time, and you pull them with the killer right by you.
---
Plague be like "We're gonna need a bigger basement..."
---
and why must you know this
---
Oh ok I guess
---
Lucas is definetely a self care user
---
Same but I want to buy legion
---
On reddit it's pretty pointless. Sure cool you laughed but what does it add to the conversation. Also we don't need your emojis to realize somethings funny
---
Why are you running?
---
Plague: Aaaaaaaahhhh... aahhhhhh, AHHH!
---
David: WHY ARE YOU RUNNING? WHY ARE YOU RUNNING???
---
Doc and Plague are super fucking frustrating... Billy is horrible to go against in a different way I cant really explain... Fun killers to go against are Freddy, Amanda, and GF...
---
Omg leave her alone !
---
He's speaking the language of the gods.
---
Insidious + Blood Warden + NOED + Thrill of the Hunt  
---
Ez
---
I haven't seen all the Halloween movies (only watched the very first one), so I don't know if Michael ever shows his torso.
---
But how fun would it be if he were just... Plain-looking? You know, no major six-packs, no rock-hard nips. Just... A guy. With some chest hair here and there, a smol belly (not Clown-levels of belly).
---
Dream pallets are fine the way they are. And dream snares are better to use anyway
---
Yes, that is how it's supposed to be read : ) I guess that's why my attmpt at a joke didn't work ;P
---
We’ll make it is possibly my favorite perk in the game, gotta keep my boys safe :)
---
None of the perks are toxic. None of the items are toxic. Some combinations of them are just (very) unfun to go against.
---
P3 Claudette with flashlight = bringing the green mori
---
Because fuck you in particular, I’m cool with the other homies
---
take bond out and reolace it with empathy
---
What is happening? I don't get it?
---
Yeah it's totally not cringey and very cool to sexualize everything you come into contact with and ask about fictional characters tits
---
&gt; some perks actually have more than 3 tiers
---
What? Which ones?
---
Oh shit, I could photoshop this, fam.
---
Indeed
---
I thought about empathy as a 4th spot, however I won’t be taking bond out of the build. The amount of support im able to provide with it is irreplaceable.
---
Also I usually play SWF, so empathy isn’t always necessary, however it’s usually 2-3 people and not 4 so I suppose it could help out that random.
---
I appreciate your feedback and taking the time to respond! :)
---
Hmmm... Thats a fair point.
---
*laughs in 15 fps but wait im not on console-*
---
I WISH I saw him all the time. I haven’t seen a Freddy more than like 3 times since his rework. Even though all I want is to fight him.
---
extrmemely stupid and i l ove it
---
I think Whispers is probably the choice for Billy if you had to choose one. I run both Nurse’s and whispers on my huntress. I’d recommend nurse’s for trapper but I don’t use either.
---
no no no 
---
Blood warden + Remember me + NOED + rancor
---
Wha-
---
idk how yall do this shit
---
Tfw you have to respond to a post you find to be false instead of letting it wallow into obscurity
---
I just think his lunge is stupid, its wayyy to big! But then again ive gone against many freddys who overestimate their lunge and miss every hit, lol
---
Small correction: since the y in Amy is a long e, it would be fuck me dad, not fuck my dad.
---
Does not translate to Consoles.
---
I used all my luck lol
---
1) Not all the people he claims are streamsnipers, are actually streamsnipers. I’ve seen him use it as an excuse for playing poorly.
---
2) Most of them aren’t even good if you watch his videos on youtube, so it is an easy game. 
---
3) He does nothing to counter it, he could easily hide his screen when he’s queuing for example.
---
Reminds me of the beginning of any COD Black ops game.
---
Don’t shame my boy Adam or he’ll pebble you to death
---
This looks like dead by daylight's new competition.
---
https://cache.escapistmagazine.com/2019/07/hide-or-die-1112241-1280x0.jpeg
---
"BT is only good against bad killers." If it's a swf, or even just a smart group of survivors one person can body block while the other saves. I assume no one took the time to write that shit out since it's so obvious.
---
ffs almost all of theses comment are sexual idk if I can make one without blending in.
---
I guess draw naked version?
---
I don't see much from that pic, the name of that game is escapistmagazine or what?
---
On ps4 u have autoaim
---
Tunnelling is when the killer shares his distribution of pain evenly, but annoys the survivor anyway
---
The game is called hide or die
---
Oooh now it makes sense
---
There is no endgame chat on console FYI
---
&gt;  If he is that good of a killer he can just play his game and wreck them.
---
Thats the thing... he isn't. He is an average / below average killer, which is impressive considering the amount of hours he has. If you compare him to other killers like zubat or marth, the difference is abysmal.
---
I'd love to be this kind if killer, but with lobby times as long as they are, I am taking at least one survivor with me.
---
This is it https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ppXKLWdgq1w/maxresdefault.jpg
---
Maybe if it raised the rate of regression as a passive, probably working with tokens to make it a percentage more severe.
---
I know he isn’t lol, but that’s what he keeps saying or pretending. He can’t admit mistakes but that’s another thing. I’m not defending stream snipers though, don’t get me wrong. He just plays with this massive ego and I can’t stand that.
---
Lets go through this step by step. 
---
1. The devs dont want an unhuman-like creature. 
---
2. Vicious Bite can make you jump over pallets, but if you fuck up the distance or timing, its a 3 second stun? Hmmmm
---
3. Cold blooded makes you 140% survivor speed for a possibly unlimited amount of time with no cooldown, but no less than 20 seconds. Overpowered
---
4. Bloodhound but worse (somehow)
---
5. Horrible perk and horribly worded (only the obsession can see the obsession's aura... lmao). No reason to use it for the secondary effect since it only helps against kindred and object of obsession (which doesnt matter since your obsession will be on the hook).
---
6. The ultra rares suck because you made the deficits way too punishing.
---
7. The addons really only affect charge time and leap distance, and honestly, i would like less distance on my jump so i dont crash into a pallet or anything when the survivor inevitably jukes me.
---
Which emblems did u get? 
---
You say the gens got done fairly quickly which probably means you COOPed it, which splits the emblem points across all people working on the gen.
---
Imagine if Tenacity stacked with this bug. OH THE JOYS.
---
What flop like last year the nightmare and friday the 13th? Well dead by daylight is more challenging because you can't shoot the killer so probably.
---
dead by daylight is more unique and forces you to always be on your toes
---
He can when the trial starts
---
What would mobile be called? Tap killers?
---
Then the guy on hook gets saved and you have two full health teammates to body block the hook??
---
"Streamer is never the victim" there we go, your true colours. You're just trolling. Ah so it's based on public and private places then? If that's so, rape happens in public too. Now, crawl back under your bridge little troll.
---
I mean, Micheal is strong as fuck so it makes sense that he had six-packs
---
No, but it helps to heal anyway, when you don't have well make it on, which most match you won't. Plus put on a good medkit and you be healing yourself in few seconds.
---
It’s a random, I just said screw it and went for the help, got lucky that the hatch was on top of the hook, then got lucky she had a key, also got lucky he didn’t grab me, got lucky he didn’t hit me again before I jumped in.
---
Doesn't it rain on purgatation though?
---
eye of the storm is really decent
---
Clown is also strong as fuck, isn't he? 
---
And moreover, lifting skinny teens by their neck isn't that great of a feat of strength...
---
Nothing. We dont care if you thought it was funny
---
If they have Insidious then there's no terror radius, meaning borrowed time won't activate
---
Condom + lube should fix all of the problems with bing bong boi
---
Haha
---
haha...unless???😏
---
People who use emojis unironically on reddit dont get to have a say in a conversation
---
Well thats because I'm terrible at the game.
---
😂😂😂 I had a crazy lag switching one once the whole match was a mess
---
And then the ride never stops
---
Fun to play and can be done? Yea. Worth it? Not really imo (coming from a former nurse main). Shes just not good enough on console to warrant the high skill level needed.
---
Yeah I love the doc 🖤
---
true ...
---
This always happens to me, every time I stare right into his retinas and get exposed a minute later
---
Shit you’re right I forgot about how it interacts with insidious, my bad man.
---
Still really effective against facecampers who don’t use it though, I’ve only ever seen a Bubba use insidious.
---
Stop, you’re embarrassing yourself
---
It is pretty inconsistent tbh. Both as playing him and going against him I've seen it be broken by a glance and other times not be broken by someone looking at him in the eyes 😑
---
The Chad Myers is not a virgin
---
This was amazing to watch!
---
Dead by oldmemes
---
I’d say “get gen rushed biiiiiiiitch!”
---
Also Wraith camping while cloaked
---
Im a Ghostface main so I'll try to explain him to you. Currently, revealing him is kind of buggy but basically if you stare at him whilst he is in his power then he is broken out of it. He gets a notification if someone is staring at him and if he is revealed then there's a notification for where it came from(Like Legion when they hit people in their power, they can see others). 
---
Once you have revealed him, his power goes on cooldown for 30 seconds (base time) and he can no longer stalk you. If he hits you at any time and you arn't exposed then he loses ALL stalking progress on you. This means allot of Ghostface players will hit you then stalk you (so if you heal you waste time) or will stalk you to 99% then move on to someone else. 
---
Allot of Ghostface players like to 99% their stalk on people(like Myers) so they can close the distance then expose you right away. He can also stalk multiple people at once and if he is leaning then he stalks twice as fast. If he didn't see you doesn't mean his stalk ability doesn't see you. I like to use the stalk (same for Myers) to see if people are on Gens far away.
---
Same man, same
---
No, you are beautfiul!
---
To body block me right beside the hook after I've grabbed him? Fine, I drop him an continue waiting. Or they get the unhook, I'm standing directly beside the hook an it takes less then 2 hits worth time to wiggle off, an if anyone over commits I down them an put them up instead.
---
If you camp properly, nothing can stop you but yourself. Atleast 1 person will die.
---
Of course this is only at endgame, I never camp during the actual match.
---
Rank 17.
---
Thrilling tremors + pop goes the weasel would make it down right broken.
---
The thing is though most people who use it are like this picture and prioritise it over more important things like gens or savinh someone before struggle. Seriously just take a med kit and use a better perk. Obviously if people use it at the right times then no sweat but sadly I don't see that all too often.
---
I was wondering what was going on.
---
"KILLERS ARENT MEANT TO GET 4KS EVERY GAME!!!"
---
AND YET THEY DO MOST GAMES.
---
"SURVIVORS ARENT MEANT TO ESCAPE EVERY GAME"
---
AND YET, AT RANK 8, ITS RARE FOR THE GATES TO OPEN.
---
*Oh Jesus Christ...*
---
Sometimes I really live by that Seinfeld quote “I’m trying to leave on a high note. It can be good for your soul and social life. Lol
---
I'm not trolling  at all. by private places I mean places where not many people are allowed without permission. You still can't compare rape to stream sniping because they are no where close to the same. If you compare rape to something that IS NOT RAPE you are normalizing rape and that is not good.
---
Rape is a traumatic experienced, forced on you without will, involving a rapist and a person. the rapist is forcing the sex on the victim, and in stream sniping, well, stream sniping, you are going against someone who is trying to go against you, you can't control them going against you, but you can easily control the outcome (be better than them) Rape is forced while stream sniping is not forced. One of them can be stopped while the other can not.
---
You should never compare:
---
* rape and stream sniping
---
* video game violence and school shootings
---
* speeding in a car and games such as GTA
---
and other things too. There's only a few things that happen in real life that do relate to video games, but there are so little you can't effectively relate the two.
---
The thing is once you compare something serious to something not as serious, you come off as a dick. You're comparing something that happens in a video game to something EXTREMELY serious. Sure, I get the comparison, but it's a shitty one at that.
---
Her stealth is at the cost of map pressure and her slow down is entirely rng. I just wish her crouch and ambush was more useful.
---
Lucky part is still missing T_T
---
You mean dudes with tits, right?
---
Is there a survivor tips thread?
---
I like Stray Wolf as well.
---
bold of you to assume michael didn't F U C K L I K E H E L L  just before he went to murder some people in haddonfield
---
Now you get it
---
We were all near the other, also she used phasing to move fast.
---
so almost taking the Doctor's hallucinations and going full steam with it? sounds awesome
---
I would say keep vaulting because then the entity will block it of, forcing them to go to a simple loop where you can mind game them. Or you can watch a video by this guy: PainRelievers, he made a video about countering loops.
---
omg legion and ghostface i love this
---
It's rewind time yo
---
&gt; Nea mains are vile and will do everything they can to piss off the killer whether its abusing loops 
---
That's so true.  
---
I used to think that Claudettes are those toxic survivor players, but that was before I was introduced to Face-Mask-Skin Nea.
---
Everytime I see a Nea with a face mask it's going to be a full on toxic neckbeard on dorito life support.
---
I think the only way to get that face mask skin is to get reported atleast 20 times or something.
---
You got this from Ardetha, lmao. Such a sheep.
---
What happens when everyone is dead and you didn't get to use it? It's just too situational. Not to mention you gotta make it active first.
---
Dcing just proves that you can't face the nurse. That's worse than defeat. It might sting a bit but it ain't gonna kill ya. Get up soldier and go at them'. Says Bill. So I would say DCing isn't a valid option in anyway. It makes you lose rank and points.
---
What? Of course she would have 'made it'.
---
Because he hit from an angle
---
TIL it doesnt show your location. Huh.... That changes some things
---
I really appreciate the comment and feedback on the build, along with Merlot tips. I know deadhard doesn’t really fit with the rest of the build, but I use it because it’s just so good, kind of a must I feel like.  
---
Also I didn’t know WMI and BK stack even though they aren’t supposed to, thanks.
---
I really want to do that actually, I just have yet to get all three perks on the same character. At the moment I have tenacity and flip flop on Ash and I use those together, hope to get unbreakable in his bloodweb soon.
---
Dc'ing makes you a bigger bitch than running noed.
---
lol you're actually getting upvoted. No, it didn't stun him. YIKES is there an influx of newbies to the game or something? The guy's giving you good tips are getting heavily downvoted whilst you're spewing nonsense and getting a bunch of upvotes.
---
big yikes from me
---
Smh as the first avenger I will avenge them “some may move on, but not us! Whatever it takes!”
---
You have to predict the prediction of what the Nurse thinks you’re going to do then be unpredictable for that prediction which means you might have to repredict your prediction of what you think her prediction is to predict what she’ll do next which means you have to do something else then you have to repredict the repredict of what she predicts you will do-
---
Then get a 5th person and do Kill your friends, cause ive literally had matches with 3 red tier survivors and 1 green the same rank as me. People will get to mid tier and then do nothing but swf with rank 20's to pip up super easy &amp; then bully mid rank players with overpowered items &amp; level 3 meta perks, and yah these assholes do seem to have a lot of fun ruining the game for everybody
---
I love playing Claudette just because she's cute as fuck and I love her lore. I usually play her with a kind of medic build, but like I noticed playing with Nea with her Harajuku Graffiti Artist outfit, people usually automatically think all Claudettes and characters with bright outfits = toxic.
---
Snowball from the corner of a parking lot 2 days after it snows

---
How do I save a comment to come back to it tomorrow? It’s easier for me to read longer texts on PC than mobile
---
bro youre so cool when you format your comment and as for your arguments, no one should be okay with taking a loss while having no say in it, and as for shitting on peoples gamer experience, the nurse removes the fun out of the game and all of the mechancis out the window and makes 4 survivors miserable
---
Oh hell no. I feel so bad for the killer. Nice escape anyway.
---
Spirit is not easy as hell to use, the Enduring + Spirit Fury Billy’s who hold W and swing at pallets because they don’t know how to use the power effectively (e.g curving chainsaws) are.
---
Was it -1% for standing too near a hooked survivor by any chance?
---
"bUt I wAsNt ThErE sO hOw WoUlD i KnOw???"
---
yeah its like playing 4d chess similiar to dodging master thresh hooks in league but an extra blink and a lunge removes even the prediction plays
---
I lowered his Max Speed to 4.4 so as to make up for his powerful ability.
---
Right, so you really wanna start your response by shitting on my comment being easily legible?
---
You do have a say in it. You're still going up against a regular human being, who can make mistakes. But lemme guess, you DC against Iridescent Huntress too, right?
---
Evidently, they don't make all 4 survivors miserable, otherwise there would be no Nurse games. Not everyone is as petty as you.
---
I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that they're going to start banning DC'ers with dedicated servers. Maybe then you'll have to get good against Nurse.
---
Basically this. Requires a lot of predicting  until the extra blink and lunge
---
Oh no baby gurl you is so small
---
\*squidwards voice\* **OH NO HES HOT!**
---
Why u so serious caps lock user? The lucky part here is david is not being grabbed while unhooking nea instead of having a key.
---
I was very far back
---
No no you shrunk 😲
---
Not if the prequel is canon.
---
Before he went nuts, LF was a bit of a charmer, so I don't think we can say for sure in that case.
---
Yeah had someone doing that today, Morried him
---
Next game. Feelsgoodman
---
Here i am...
---
i mean if your gonna pallette camp you kinda deserve it, also dont forget addons can tremendously increase/decrease detection range, marking speed &amp; the amount of time it takes to deactivate his power, plus it looks like your camera was aiming more at the pallete than him
---
Explain more... oh and answere my question, coward!
---
How is it battle royal?
---
Thank you random guy on the internet. :)
---
Yea, obviously u dont play legion because ur too scared. Literally. Then dont come to my post and insult me
---
Ghost face is the funniest killer 🤣🤣 Moried Nea ass after sand bagging contest and flash light clicking XD
---
Who wouldn’t
---
Good job?
---
For killer its very rare situations the perks become toxic, like insidious camping hooks for example
---
I once had a killer who was amazed at how he never saw me, except at the exit gate giving him 2 hits. I did 3 gens and saved 2 people of hook.
---
Felt good ^^
---
The stun is the same at every level. What changes is the duration of time DS stays active for after unhook.
---
But there are no rules in the game, or I havent been able to find them yet.
---
16 players compete to be the last survivor with a storm shrinking down on them. There's no weapon to kill other survivors but you can turn into the killer for a limited time.
---
You are speaking about a really tiny % of the community, very few people play in 3-4 mans. It's really not worth the effort of programing it and putting it in the game.
---
And tunneling is relevant to this meme how?
---
Don’t hack is a pretty solid rule
---
Ghost face even went into the grab animation for a couple of frames.
---
That yeah but other than that, nothing.
---
Personally I don't use it because 3 seconds to wait are too much to let you use it during a chase most part of the time. Also the stunning area is a bit inconsistent. I've tried it in a kill your friend and I noticed that if you are in the locker and the killer comes directly to you from the front of it  you can't stun him. We have tried something like 10 times with every possible distance and I didn't stun the killer once. Maybe it was a bug of the moment, I don't know, but if the killer was running to me from a side I could stun, but not from the front. If the time to wait was less than 3 seconds and the stunning area was more consistent I would use it sometimes but at the moment I find it is more frustrating than funny.
---
Absolute yeet.
---
good comment
---
I mean, from the three Saw Bois the evil-est is Hammond, so enjoy your pig i guess
---
Should be the groom from the whistle blower dlc now that's a man who is terrifying.
---
This is just incorrect...
---
*Well all know that The Clown is up there with Myers...*
---
You are not daddy myers, dont tell me what to do
---
PWHAAHAHHAHAAHAHAH hahahahahaah, the guy saying people cry toxic over anything is still offended by teabagging and flashlightclicking, no not ebony mori's or instahels with 4 people, no a little fuckign clicking sound, ahahahahaha and it's fucking top comment too, omg fucking kill me now this world has gone full-rtard.,
---
Oh good another useless thread about this guy.
---
Yea you’d like that you freak
---
I mean, the fact that she sees you as a prey doesnt help either, that freaks me out even more
---
New patch looking fire as always
---
Yeah the grind is bad. I think if the Devs didn't nerf the daily rituals and did more events like Double or Triple Bloodpoints, players will complain less about the grind
---
It's funny cause throwing the hatchet really felt like BO1 summit Search and Destroy 😂
---
But hes not broken. Hes weak af
---
Ability : Can flop his mantitties to expand his terror radius
---
Yeah you dickhead stop being near the hooks when you survivor wants to unhook you asshole /s
---
It's basically the default amount of bps you get for killer games though nothing impressive.
---
I don't remember that game too well, but judging from the DC, they were not too happy 😅
---
Six pack is just a sign of good core strength and low body fat. That being said, film Myers definitely has both.
---
Yeah, agreed. The original idea to have pinhead at the end of FvJ would’ve been the ideal scenario
---
Lifting literally any teen/adult is incredibly difficult unless they cooperate.
---
No, we all knew it but we didn't want to believe it. Instagram normies are among us now.

\*angry bubba noises\*
---
The Boys=upvote
---
Exactly so the game went average overall, points are always a good thing
---
“MOM GET THE CAMERA!!!”
---
why does she look emaciated
---
I play against him frequently,  he got some serious skill when it comes to dealing with looping or mindgaming on tiles. I give him so much credit for actually being great at killer rather than another spirit or nurse. Takes so much more actual skill to do well with the pig. Nurse/spirit players may do well, but how would they do against the same persons with the piggy? Something to think about 🤔
---
More like: RUAAAAAHHH
---
And yes, we all died
---
Using music from my favorite Pokemon game. I wish I could up vote this more than once.
---
The Freddy Rework Dream snares are essentially the same power as the Crapper
---
You can use her dash to counter pallet loops
---
If the air is so polluted why do you breathe it every couple of seconds?
---
Thanks for the Necro replies
---
CJ tech a killer. Just never in the right situations for it.
---
I like how the killer played along instead of insta-downing you
---
i play chest protector sometimes, i use instasaw addons, insidious, bitter murmur, noed and whispers... so you kinda know when ppl is going to try steal from your chest, you must protect it at all cost... some ppl rage and some ppl laughs
---
I have a better idea. Fuck the emblem system, who cause people to play for the pip and not for the excape(cleansing totems, running in mass to save the hooked person, staying in the killer's Terror radius,...). The old system was ok, but the required minimum to get the pip was too low. So, what's my idea? First of all it's ridiculous that actions like stunning the killer and cleansing totems give you so many points. The game it's basically rewarding you for not doing the objective. So less points for totems and stun(i leterally have seen so many people who drop the pallet instantly to get the stun points, and that gives you more points than being chased for several seconds). So what are the minimum bp amounts i came out with? 26k double pip; 20k pip; 14k black pip.
---
This is something different tho... 
---
You can choose a different hex or no hex without a problem but you can't just stop breathing without getting in trouble.
---
Ace
---
I can just hear how bad your breath smells
---
Wait what
---
what damn I thought Adam was a teen lol and I forgot about David.
---
It me.
---
I'll take that as a "yes we're always this whiny". Same for anynone who downvoted, nothing says "I'm not whiny" better than downvoting angrily anyone who you don't agree with.
---
This pic actually makes me sad like please OP i don't want to cry i've already been jump scared enough by ghostface tonight
---
You know everyone can change their display name at any time right?
---
Laurie was 17 apparently in the movies I said excluding Bill 
---
I thought Kate was a teenager.
---
David? idk he might be in his  20-30
---
This is an alien from area 51 trying to integrate into our subbreddit.
---
This post wasn’t very thought through
---
Kate lives on her own so no shes not shes like 23 ish laurie is borderline i was listing everyone
---
I see
---
I mean I forgot about David Tapp being an adult.
---
Wait how old is Claudette?
---
What about Nea I know Meg, Dwight, Jake, Feng and Claudette are adults.
---
Ah, ye. Hes pretty old for a Survivor actually, similar TP Bill.
---
Also, Ash and Jeff are adult as well
---
Idk
---
Nea is a teen deliquent
---
Lol #BubbaThings
---
Most are teens though right? Meg is a teenager and Dwight, Claudette and Jake?
---
depending on your Definition for "teen" most of them are at least 20, I would assume from their lore
---
1,500 hours, I don’t think I’ve ever played a match without a Claudette.
---
Thicc
---
I saw that Laurie post. it looked more like a fuck you than her trying to stun him while he was stunned.
---
mid 20s
---
That is completely possible, as I was using base skins for sizing. I did this because that was her original look so would give the best base to go from. It's possible that sizing was reduced in future skins so as to make it less obvious.
---
Those things they are carrying are for babies, kinda creepy.
---
The plague vs the plank.
---
so these are the teens?
---
- Dwight
---
- Meg
---
- Jake
---
- Claudette
---
- Quentin (can't spell it)
---
- David King
---
- Feng Min
---
yeah shes too short i think the devs have mentioned the height thing before
---
David is an adult it talks about him being in bars
---
I thought they were 17 to 19 some of them, I thought the 2 oldest were Jane and Bill
---
Yeah that was horrible 😂
---
Literally only Laurie and Quentin are the only non adult survivors
---
I know for sure Meg is a teenager it says in her nio and Jake as well as Feng including Dwight.
---
nah, most of them already have a job or are Close to finishing University.
---
Except maybe Meg, Feng, Quentin and apparently Laurie
---
I'd think Wraith is a virgin
---
I always see her as being like 35 but who knows. Huntress is technically 6 so wtf
---
How do you know this person does it?
---
Seriously y'all need to stop with this cringy ass shit! I come here to discuss the game not your weird ass cartoon character fetishes ffs!
---
Well, I imagine /u/Spartan_Two118 meant no rules beyond the following the TOS.
---
Let me guess, you're Nurse
---
Here is my philosophy on DBD if you already have one survivor and you know they will come for hook cause they always do playing around the hook and gens in that area is a smart move. It even smarter if you know they are already on the hook like you saw the scratch marks. Those survivors played bad and the paid for it. You did you job you killed them no reason for you to give them an easy unhook.
---
It still looks very blurry to me. I'll see what I can do to make it less like that
---
I checked the reviews, it's sub 50% on steam. Apparently, it's filled with bugs. However it is still in early access, so there is some hope for the future
---
I didn't know Thanos eats fingers
---
ok it is yellow
---
whoops haha, I tried doing the open image in new tab and not clicking on the image itself lol, sorry
---
It's Feng Min and Ace Visconti as survivors
---
And then, The Doctor and The Hag as Killers
---
Bold of you to assume i do it for the stun and not for the ez 1k points
---
yes, it performs better. Before i changed it, I had little drops of only 1 or 2 FPS and that sometimes felt like I'm lagging hard for some reason. After the change I don't have that problem at all. And obviously the skillchecks are smoother.  
---
I think turning VSync off is worth it and should be an option in the settings tbh.
---
Oh it's Big, it's big enough that it goes through our bodies  😘😉😏🤭🤤❤️
---
I think everyone's who's played Killer's had to deal deal with this crap so you're not alone! To be honest, I don't blame you for camping towards the end if they started getting cocky. They're just asking for it at that point so really have no right to get upset. We've all been camped as Survivors but I personally don't get that upset over it. I'll moan about it if I'm doing SWF over Discord but I've never actually bitched at the Killer directly in the chat about it. I really don't see why people get so angry about it. It's just a game and they'll have more matches.
---
Pig best girl
---
Actually, it's the brief moment of "And I oop-"
---
Who will be next? Please Michael myers, and please 2 different versions (one standing normal and another one I'm EW3 holding his knife up)
---
Every day I gain more faith in humanity
---
It's supposed to be you, because if you focus you will only see your reflection on the phone XD
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Where's Amanda????
---
Yeah man for sure.  Dead hard has that running guy symbol
---
Leatherface could do it in MortalKombatX
---
Possibly I think I might’ve went back to check if someone got rescued.
---
I dont get why freddy isnt lower than everything
---
The real meta is take out more and put in haunted grounds
---
Same!
---
\&gt;camping
---
\&gt;tunneling
---
All gens up and even the gate is open. What camping? To whom hag should have switched? Patrol open gates for survivors?
---
You say that as if both can't be true.
---
He was 6, dude
---
Same goes for you.
---
That’s a better version. I made mine in Microsoft word lol
---
Idk wym I’m just saying she’s a college/university student- it’s stated in her lore 
---
So she’s def 18+, can still be a virgin though
---
GF is only good for memes. You can T BAG survivors xD

I've noticed posts in my country's PS4 community from people having connection issues. However, during the same time I got into games just fine. At this point I don't even know what makes you have issues, as it seems to be completely random.

---
BHVR and Illfonic have locked down down all the major horror licences. Plus this has the Survivors actively harming the Killer, like Friday the 13th. This feature is just spammy and frustrating. Also, like F13, Survivors can die almost instantly.
---
the other day did 4^(1/2) gens on my own without any help, at least i escape with other random
---
I think that's one mode, but there's another that's currently unavailable.
---
I don't remember that well but didn't he break out from his mental asylum then go kill people in haddonfield?
---
Is this like a personal attack or something?
---
Vertical Sync. Basically, having it activated locks your framerate to a set amount, usually equal to your monitor's refresh rate, and prevents things like screen-tearing from occurring. One drawback to it, however, is that it can affect the game's overall performance, especially if you can run the game just fine without it.
---
I try not be,

But sometimes what they do passes the line for me.
---
I'm not saying it's right, but no one's perfect.

It’s awesome for getting flashlight batteries and insta heals
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Have rotated?
---
Comment so I can downvote you ducking insta normie shit
---
Ok you're point is? What does that have to do with this sub?!
---
I see no bugs here, just the game functioning as it always does during an average session
---
Or as Bubba would say, “REUHUHUEUEUUUHHHEHHEHUUUUEH”
---
damn right ;)
---
Politics follows you everywhere so please leave me alone I want to keep my karma
---
So you got 1 bronze and two silvers, that’s not enough for a pip on high ranks. It also means you probably weren’t doing a lot in the game if you weren’t getting chased or doing gens or healing. I’m only guessing but i’m assuming you probably hid for a large part of the match
---
I'd quit if I got hit by that
---
Nobody is asking so I will lol. 
---
Pretend wife? I am conFUSION. 
---
Also these looks great!
---
See that explains it
---
Wtf
---
I asked Ysvil about that, and the Rain's power would simply make it rain indoors.
---
Lmao it stands no chance against dbd. It lacks character and practically anything that builds a games character, the game feels dull and dead. Well our fandom never stops complaining about bugs, this game has way more bugs then dbd (im aware it is in early access). Theres way more reasons for while this game will dead on arrival but those are two pretty big ones. I dont think it stands a chance against dbd.
---
If I was kinky I would comment about eating that 
---
But fuck no
---
I literally never facecamp and I get teabagged all the time.  
---
Not that I would even want to, because face-camping is boring as fuck, but for argument's sake, it's almost tempting to ruin the game for someone when everyone is running around being a dickhead anyway.
---
There are tons of videos where (tru1) gets looped and he says "yeah an experience surv, nice move, etc ) he clearly shows it haha

---
I think that’s why I don’t like GF. Most of the other killers had some kind of tragedy in their lives and that’s why they went off. GF is just a piece of shit incel neckbeard that probably kills to feel superior to those who would reject him.
---
ADAM!!!!!!!!!

RUN
---
Dead hard is a must have for me 
---
This is enough proof
---
I'm russian and I feel so cringy of my country community...
---
I would recommend adrenaline bond dc and dead hard
---
How often are you going to post about Billy needing Ruin?
---
People who DC because they will lose a game need to just uninstall.  I see survivors load up hard and then cry wolf on killer like it's not just a part of the fucking game.
---
Play the fucking game or just uninstall.
---
smell my dick through my jeans... you like that? you like the smell that a man has...
---
fuck yeah...
---
Flashy neas 
---
Assholes
---
But the rare 1% that are nice keep up the good work :)
---
No Mither and Botany Knowledge?
---
Ruin isn’t a chasing perk. 
---
It’s a perk to give other killers map pressure. Billy has map pressure.
---
You realize that 99% of all Doc addons are super useful to him right? If I run through all of them, only Scrapped Tape, High Stimulus Electrode, and Maple Knight are bad. The rest are fine for him. 
---
Does Doc need buffs? Absolutely. He's massively addon-reliant and his power wastes more time than it saves for the uninitiated player.
---
Because she was a priestess?
---
Well not necessarily if the killer closes the hatch with 5 gens remaining the survivor gets adrenaline out of the situation
---
Everyone has that one thing that pushes them over the edge but i try to make that super difficult. So far the only way is constantly shocking as doctor instead of attacking just to get everyone madness 3 within like 5 seconds of the match starting.
---
Pop Goes The Weasel is a great perk but it's nothing like Ruin. 
---
Ruin: active from the start of the match, makes good skill checks regress a gen 5%, can't work on said gen for 3 seconds as it sparks, makes great skill checks give no bonus progess, and requires a totem to he cleansed.
---
Pop Goes The Weasel: only active for 60 seconds AFTER a hook, requires you to kick a gen which possibly wastes time you could be chasing, and you can waste charges of it by hooking a Survivor before using your current charge.
---
I see your a man of class as well
---
What exactly is the issue you're having? Framerate and frametimes jumping all over the place? 
---
If so, which program are you using to monitor them and what are they? I am assuming you haven't but have you made any changes to any of your ini's?
---
I found leaving vsync on works much better overall since it doesn't seem to actually lock your FPS to your refresh rate or work the same way every other game I've ever played before lol
---
This is provided you properly limit your FPS because with default settings this game runs incredibly bad in regards to fluctuations in FPS and frametimes causing annoying microstutter. 
---
It drove me bonkers so I spent quite a lot of time trying to figure out how to make it smooth and consistent.
---
I have managed to make both my FPS and frametimes absolutely rock solid no matter what is happening in game which is ideally what you always want.
---
This can actually be done without changing anything in GameUserSettings.ini provided you are ok with 60 FPS or less. You can have the same rocksolid FPS &amp; frametimes with any FPS provided that your system can maintain it but to go over 60 you must edit GameUserSettings.ini
---
I'm on mobile or I'd explain in more detail, I will be home in less than an hour and can definitely help you if you're interested. 
---
I've actually been tempted to write up a detailed guide because while I was trying to figure all of this out I read and watched every guide I could find, and literally, and I do mean literally every single one was almost all complete nonsense/snakeoil suggesting doing things that don't &amp; can't even work at all. 
---
Things like setting "read-only" on ini files because they thought this somehow can force the game to use whatever setting they changed in there which is laughable. Doing that only prevents the file from being written to, which in itself is a silly idea but also the fact is that any setting you're allowed to change, you can freely and the game will not try and change it back anyway so there absolutely no reason to set read-only. 
---
If you're not allowed to change a setting, or only allowed to alter it within certain parameters and try to change it, the game will automatically ignore that line and use it's default for that line as well as it will overwrite that line. Yes, if you set read-only on the ini it will stop the game from overwriting that line however it will still ignore the invalid parameter again proving setting read-only is useless and suggested by people that don't have even a basic understanding of what they're rambling about.

I don't have the Bloodstained Sack for sure. I want to use the Owl Wraith skin and some of the other killer cosmetics and they aren't in my thing at all.
---
No? They're cosmetics packs
---
I’m gonna start commenting “well as a rank 13 Bubba main..” on everything. Doesn’t matter who we’re discussing
---
I'll doublecheck the survivor ones but I def don't have the killer ones, the Bloodstained Sack cosmetics.

Obscured status bar!

Survivors can't tell who is injured or not.

I couldnt self heal, wiggle, recover or dead hard. I also couldn't walk out of the gate.

Which killers are they on? I never even noticed them.

please do

Killer addons... use your brain

That’s just bad luck on your part, based on where the totem spawns in relation to the survivors

Ain't that the truth.

Reach 2 tokens then the game ends.

\*P3 nurse with 5 blinks, an ebony mori, who slugs and tunnels to ensure the game is over within a few minutes\*

\*surprised when survivors dc because they want a fun and fair game\*
---
I don't have stats for Ruins duration but the average is definitely not 30 seconds. Closer to 2 minutes i'd say.
---
Turns out it's Haunted Ground
---
Frank has no parents and lived in foster care for most of his life and had to deal with a lot of abuse according to the character bio.

Don't worry, [I got you can.](https://i.redd.it/zc8fy1wo4jx21.jpg)

Jojo killer/survivor when
---
Have run into that on Xbox before.  We thought it might be a basement Bubba, a NOED exit gate Nurse, something.  Nope.  Couldn't find anything.  Get to the post-game scoreboard and see it was a Wraith.  Well, alrighty then.
---
and I would much rather have those 30 seconds of gens basically not getting done than a perk that requires me to go out of my way to kick a gen when I could just be chasing the Survivor and thus preventing them from doing the gen
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
100% agree with you when they do it during the game. Let's say im chasing someone and someone else does the flashlight click, the traduction is essentially "Hey that guy isn't of your skill level, try chasing me instead ;)". Nothing disrespectful about it.
---
The exception would be someone that does it while you are chasing them, but personally nobody ever does that to me since it would get them downed lol
---
Doing it at the exit gates does feel disrespectful. Its the equivalent of "GG NO RE". But i'm 32 so i am very used to that, don't care anymore lol
---
The cannon is actually the 1978 movie, Halloween 2, and then Halloween H20.
---
Not cosmetics
---
They're Characters
---
No basement can hold me when I am in this state
---
He has it in his intro song a
---
I respectfully disagree. While it may be more of a case-by-case basis, I have definitely had games where I died but had a lot of fun and told the killer that in the post-game chat. Also, I’ve had plenty of games where I escaped but it was a boring game (generally when the killer tunnelled one person or camped the hook all game).  
---
People need to stop thinking a “win” is solely based on escaping or getting a 4K and just have fun in the games.
---
I threw you an upvote homie
---
I’m with you, I don’t care. Spamming fast vaults pisses me off because I play with headphones and high volume but a little teabag here and there doesn’t bother me at all.
---
He has it in his intro song sometimes
---
That's pretty predictable...I trace the killers steps in anticipation that he is going to check on his hex
---
The best is when someone that only plays one side wants balance for their side and dont consider both sides of the coin
---
He might get looped but he'll usually get 3-4K in most of his vids. Same thing when he plays survivors he's not gonna upload gameplay of himself being face camped he's gonna show himself doing a 4-5 gen chase. I don't really blame him because content of himself doing good is obviously more entertaining
---
You mean *Tydes* has turned*
---
Couldnt do a thing in "proper chases" yet bubba caught u
---
 This your third ruin / Billy post in 2 days... give it a rest
---
&gt; People need to stop thinking a “win” is solely based on escaping or getting a 4K and just have fun in the games.
---
You are def right about this. I actually recently started playing that way (it got me to derank a bit), but its more fun to play. 
---
I don't doubt some survivors are much more reasonable
---
Had the same thing happen except I had the perk that allows you to see the killer after completing a gen, our Nea went down there at the end of the game, we left her greedy butt.
---
Considering how long Killer queues have become, you’re an asshole to DC for any other reason than a power outage
---
I mean, kinda? People are more likely to be salty if they lose, for sure. But if I escape against a facecamper, for example, I’m not gonna be happy because those matches are extremely tedious.
---
This guy is always down to unhook you.  So not true.
---
True. But if the window spawns in the right place it’s something I can try to use.
---
Ya I'm a big fan of tea bag dancing with them as ghostface
---
To be fair I played the 2v10 mode in Deathgarden and it has issues to say the least. The most easily identifiable problem is that two Hunters (Killers) chasing the same Runner (Survivor) is basically inescapable. There's also the big problem that a very high-skilled player on either side can pretty much solo carry if they waste enough of the Killer's time or kill enough Survivors, since so many other players will be around to do objectives. &gt;!(This is more of a problem with Deathgarden's balance to be fair, since you can directly purchase power unlike DbD where you only purchase perks and perk levels.)!&lt; There are other issues that are also related to Deathgarden specifically but are fine in a vacuum.
---
But what I can say is that Deathgarden's 2v10 mode is super fun, and I would love for Behavior to at least *try* it in Dead by Daylight. I think DBD has a lot more Killers with a lot more powers that could make for some insanely strong combos when pared together (Doctor leading Nurse to Survivors, Trapper and Hag blocking off all exits, Myers stalking a Trapped Survivor...) and it would definitely require a lot more balancing than Deathgarden, but any attempt at a different game mode would be greatly appreciated and would go a long way to making the game feel fresh again.
---
that’s all the time i need ;)
---
Deathgarden is made by BHVR too
---
Yeah that could obviously be removed
---
Nice, 9gag has been like that for a long time, good to see Reddit doing it as well

It’s the black mirror

So I guess that theory is bogus 'cus MM is still fucked.

Look at those baby Dwights
---
Exactly. At my new rank i can literally mess around playing LF with 0 perks and still win, its fun. At red ranks i gotta try hard with the best killers and still end up losing many of them.
---
No. Now what are you gonna do about it? You don't want no smoke bitch.
---
So, the plague with useless perks?
---
Oh yea that's true. Face camp matches aren't very fun even if you escape.
---
Actually had a situation like this. Played against a clown and got hooked with 1 gen left. I had adrenaline and saw teammates working on the last gen. I cleansed a dull totem for that extra 1000 points and then adrenaline popped. Got an exit gate open and saw someone take a hit. 
---
In post game, I saw that he had NOED. Feels good man
---
He was a good guy, although not too good for the people he was tearing apart..
---
not really, what a stupid assumption.
---
my cousin joined a Survival game on l4d back in the day and a modder was in there who somehow unlocked whatever locked achievements there were for him and everyone else in the lobby. so you're telling me your snitch ass would have reported him because he unlocked multiple achievements at once? gtfoh snowflake my cousin has never cheated in a game in his life, but pussies like you would be quick to file a report because it makes you feel some type of way.
---
Toxic survivors are not toxic every games. And campers don't camp every game either.
---
That’d be cool, What about Trager or Frank?
---
Your question can be simplified to "what happens more often, the Killer doing a break action or a gen being completed"
---
I still want Candy Man
---
We don't need your multiple obsessive Billy and Ruin posts every day spamming up the reddit, only smoke is whatever you been puffin on.
---
Pardon my French, but you’re an asshole
---
Ruin is unreliable. It is still strong. I like the build I have on my spirit right now: Ruin, Bbq, Thrilling, and Pop goes the weasel. Ruin is there to slow down gens in the early game, thrilling and Bbq tell me where to take my pop stack. Typically, if I can get some momentum, all gens remaining will be regressing and at least one survivor hooked
---
Alert will almost always activate more than Dark Sense, since Dark Sense only activates if you are on the gen when it is completed (aside from last gen).
---
The most common language in the world is mandarin. The second most common is Spanish. English is third.
---
Alert is massively better, you get to know where there is not pallets anymore
---
&gt; German engineering: generators will be done faster with another survivor

but you will know which hooks are 99'ed since you get notified everytime someone touches said hook, and slugging would be easy to do since they respawn after 10 seconds, so you won't have to worry about No Mither/Unbreakable plays as the hook will come back long before they can pick themselves up. This will also make Breakdown less effective as well, and their toolboxes won't last as long since the hooks will be coming back so often.

check on the description, or ask on the comments

Thank you. I'm the same way.

Like has no one else played literally any other video game? Tbagging is all over the place but only here is it considered a war crime for some reason

No I didn't, I implied you could be mistaken and have been failing to end nightshroud for legitimate reasons. Which would be cleared up had you provided a video. See what I'm getting at?

Ruin, BBC, Enduring and Spirit Fury will help you a lot ;)

It's really rare when hooks are too far from each other. so if you know that hook is damaged: don't go there.

No Ruin?

I won't be able to click anything in this subreddit since you constantly post about how nurse and spirit are OP, Billy needs ruin, NOED vs adrenaline.

" Save it for later " there's streetwise from nea who does exactly the same but better. 25% to you and all survivors close

Love that 😂
---
This is a character who, according to everyone in his fiction, was the embodiment of evil, and no one wanted to be near him. Do you really think that would have happened? Loomis convinced everyone this child was severely dangerous and capable of true evil, and he DID brutally murder his sister. I doubt that was on anyone’s mind regarding him. Also, I literally study psychology and have done extensive research on mental institutions, and there’s no denying how shit they even still are. This is also, however, a fictional character set in a fictional world.
---
The satisfaction.
---
Can we have a de pip in There well
---
Yeah I know what you mean. Just yesterday I had a killer game where I burnt a Cake offering for everyone to get double BPs, then they sabo’ed my hooks and used 2 instaheals. Granted I could’ve played better but it was frustrating because I just wanted a fun game. Funny thing is, they all escaped and nobody got a lot of BPs since the game was over so quick.
---
You die. Killer or Survivor you just die.
---
On the inside.

By number of native speakers, yes. That’s a very big difference though. English is the most common second language for most people and it’s the most dominant language on the internet.
---
Death becomes an escape
---
Specifically avoided mentioning the obvious
---
Had a similar game, where leather-face just stod in the basement the hole trial. Waiting for us to pop the last gen.
---
Because gens pop way too fast, even with slow down perks.
---
You get an achievement. Then you wish you were lower rank because red ranks are terrible.
---
I never disconnect. I just die on the first hook immediately.
---
I'm OOTL
---
Why does everyone want shirtless Michael?
---
As annoying as it is I agree I might throw a little salt like nice tent, never get that mad over it tho to insult and personally attack someone
---
What? I'm saying the Bloodstained Sack and 80's Suitcase are cosmetics packs.
---
Your getting downvotes for being a rude asshole, not for your opinion.
---
It's almost like gens are done too fast and instead of constantly trying to add perks to fix a problem they should just fix the issue at its core.
---
I’m at rank 12 😅
---
Well, if we consider every movie to be canon ( I know that only the first and the last one are canon) , he's technically not a virgin.
---
Noted. Will do ASAP
---
No they aren't.

---
Funny post, but please don’t target twitch streamers just because they want to broadcast their games. I swear they are not all toxic.
---
Oh shit, sorry!
---
I should probably re-read the Title 😅😂
---
Ive used people use it with PWYF to easily loose a chase and get a stack
---
You’re absolutely right, they need to fix core issues instead of adding perks (usually behind paywalls) to stop them.
---
Until (or if) that happens we have perks for now.
---
If you’re talking about the recently released film that looks at his younger years, that came out AFTER leatherface was released in DBD. How would they have future vision to predict the release of that film and the characterization that film would have done with leatherface? The development for the leatherface in game concept would have had to have started well before the release of the film. Also, the games lore states that he is bubba sawyer, who is from the original series. The remakes are Thomas Hewitt, a different character entirely and the 2017 leatherface film is a characterization of the 2013 Texas chainsaw 3D leatherface (jedidiah).
---
Lol. Anyway do you know why these DLC are not in the digital edition?
---
You suffer the sweatiest matches of your life.
---
Laugh all you want, it actually happened.
---
He literally is though
---
It didn’t, but go off
---
Shattered Bloodline because Spirit
---
I actually have no idea...
---
Im so sorry 😅
---
Thats the same with ruin, If they just hit skillchecks the perk is useless
---
Purely on the fact it gets found within the first 23 seconds of the game? Aye, I get you
---
Getting high rank isn’t really hard. Just try your best and you can do it! Except for ebony mori nurses.. go with that lol
---
Sorry for wasting time lol xx
---
i think it's that they put tv in their name; they can stream but people don't like them advertising themselves i guess?
---
Shattered bloodline for the perks alone(from a killer's perspective), haunted grounds and spirit fury are top tier. Discordance (legion perk) is good but not great though some builds utilize it very well.
---
Fell off a house onto a rock just like this last week,  took the killer 2-3min to walk off the edge just right to grab me.
---
I can get you a link. Just give me a minute.
---
But the entity said *loud screeches Of pain*
---
Good thing shes getting a nerf
---
If someone wants to ruin your gameplay experience you shouldn't feel bad 4 not sitting there and wasting your time.
---
So does Bloodhound and Sloppy Butcher
---
Because Pig = best girl
---
There you go, although I assume you're still gonna deny it judging from the way you speak without any knowledge of the movies and downvote immediately.
---
Tunneling, camping, lag switching.
---
He's the most attractive killer. Strong, handsome, and mysterious.
---
I have literally written analysis essays on the films and watched them numerous times lmao are you going to provide your link or not?
---
As a survivor the upside is at least your allies are usually good.
---
As a killer... well that sucks lol
---
Dbd in a nutshell
---
I already did.
---
What type of body are we wanting here?
---
Dad bod?
---
Strong bod
---
Fat bod?
---
Fat strong dad bod???
---
By that logic it is fine to DC as well. You're not breaking any rules and wanting to enjoy playing a video game is a real tactic.
---
I did not receive any message with any link from you. You posted one saying that you would find a link and then immediately responded because I downvoted it xD
---
I got chills from reading this
---
Look at my edit smartass.
---
Went against one of those earlier because my friend and I have furry Icons, they were good too.
---
RIP in peps
---
I hate spiders but I try to move them outside instead of just smashing them
---
Fucking his grandniece as disgusting as it is is still sex
---
Did you know: reddit doesn’t notify if you edit a message? Amazing! Also, literally when could this have happened in the film? The only time he interacted with Jamie was when she was a child and then when he killed her. This is a wikia website that can be edited by anyone, and they didn’t mention this in the film lol
---
Just being it’s a real tactic or they’re not cheating doesn’t make it any less unfun to play against. 
---
Teabagging and flashlight clicking aren’t cheating, but they’re unfun to play against
---
What the fuck, that was a thing? Who approved it?
---
Perks seem op but the numbers can be tweaked.  Great stuff man.
---
No it isn't.  Dm'ing too often can get you in trouble, but it is not a reportable offense.
---
You suffer.
---
how would you have sex with just limbs
---
Lol, not even lag switching?
---
Haven't played a single killer game in the last 3 weeks where someone didn't DC on the first hook.
---
Disconnect by Daylight
---
Hey, they put .ttv for the attention, they get the attention.
---
Looks dope, good work
---
I got flashbacks to that one part in Majora’s Mask where you chase the tree dude.
---
I love it when they do it because they pallet stunned me and then they mess up their loop. It’s so adorable.
---
At this point its not worth it
---
"Well as a rank 12 bubba main..."
---
That would be awesome!
---
"Ew it's coming towards me!"
---
I've been playing on PS4 from the day it came out &amp; I can count on 1 hand the amount of amazing Nurse players I have run into. Not just accurate with Blinks but it seem like they get into your head &amp; know what your going to do before you even do. They are scary AF
---
I wish we'd gotten an evil ash killer lol
---
Imagine someone's breath smelling so bad to you scream when you hear them
---
You cant expect your opinion to be taken seriously if you are not red ranks on PC and understand the existence of swf and what a killer requires in order to win.
---
I don’t think it is. You can lose 2 pips, but I’m pretty sure it’s not reportable or bannable. Might be wrong though.
---
Not necessarily. There are plenty of streamers that put in .ttv because they simply want to grow their community. That doesn’t mean they want to be tunneled and mori’ed every game when they aren’t playing toxic at all.
---
Shattered Bloodline for sure though honestly I have been digging the perks in the Darkness Among Us chapter
---
It’s not, check the rules. They specifically state that you can’t report tunnelling, camping or slugging.
---
Also happy cake day !
---
Say sike right now
---
I said *attention*, which pertains to getting support from people unfamiliar to them potentially checking out their stream.
---
Matchmaking is booty but it's to show your not one of the autistic morons who say wraith can win... or all killers OP... those are some scum who need to educate themselves before shooting out some redundant opinion
---
Oh lol i didn’t even realize but thank you!
---
Now, that's a quality build there.
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
A headset is definitely the way to go for killer or survivor. Makes a huge difference if you have a decent headset. You simply pick up on sounds that you wouldn’t notice from most standard speakers.
---
I mean if you’re going to talk about how good killers actually are, shouldn’t you have some experience against the best players?
---
I grew another hand, my hand grew another me, what's the difference
---
"well as a rank 14 spirit with speakers"
---
BUMP
---
No it’s not comparable at all actually. It’s like if you buy out Mayfair and parklane at the start of a monopoly match. Not against the rules but still annoying. Vs that against somebody tossing the board against the table sending everybody lies poor little metal shoes scattering to the wind.
---
*go stalk mode*...
---
*Stalk survivor to 99%*
---
*get pulled out of stalk mode*
---
*hit survivor cause that objective*
---
*lose all stalk progress you had on that survivor*
---
ghost face is easily on argument for the worst killer in the game... between wraith him and trapper it's a close call at red ranks they all shit.

I never played without one but i am guessing it definitely makes a big difference.
---
Btw off topic fun fact: Ace almost has a built in iron will, very hard to hear. Jane almost has a built in stridor.
---
You're getting downvoted by salty assholes. I agree with you.
---
He needed both hands.
---
I got it on the first week I bought the game....... they took pity on me.... just dress up as a baby surv!!
---
*yet the survivors teabag and flashlight click*
---
Pretty sure they are adding the timeout just to punish dcing
---
God forbid you bring a mori of any kind, you're guaranteed at least 2 DCs.
---
Imagine a game about being a ruthless killer having rules lmaoooo
---
Read the report option to the far left at end game
---
Aight bruh I wouldn't be a rank 1 player if it weren't for a good headset... good survivors mostly swf I play against know the game like their own dicks...
---
And the time I waste searching every nearby angle when I stumble on a cranking generator is game breaking, having a headset allows for me to pick up crouch noises, rustling grass, even the survivors breathing and that changes the game in so many ways...
---
Get a headset a good quality one and listen to the game and I want you to find the difference for yourself...
---
Hell if headsets didnt exist spirit would be C tier cause listening is such a huge part of her KIT.
---
&lt;Insert weak argument about how it's *my* freetime so if I want to disconnect and pursue a better game it's completely fine, while disregarding the fact that this ruins the game for everyone else&gt;
---
edit: To those downvoting. There is a reason Rage Quitting is punishable/bannable in just about every multiplayer game.
---
I found this easy to masturbate to.
---
My headset just broke, and as a killer it makes it a little harder to hear injured survivors. It also makes it very difficult to hear footsteps and breathing.
---
Is it the game that’s flawed or the players? When I play killer I just like to kill everyone as best as I can. When I’m a survivor I try my best to win against these killers.  Idk a whole lot about blood point optimization but I assume if you just play you get points.
---
Some dont have it tho
---
I feel you. I guess I just look at it like even if they are trolling and being disrespectful it reflects more on them being immature dickheads rather than me personally. Sometimes easier said then done to ignore it or let it roll off though if it's been 3 games full of dickheads etc.
---
On your 3 points:
---
1) is a fair point, it may not be a common nor effective game plan.. but there's many perks like that, it enables and assists with playing a certain way, that's a good enough reason for most perks to exist the way they do. 
---
2) I'll never consider 'it helps other perks be better' to be a valid reasoning for the perk in question to supposedly not need a buff. 
---
3) this is meme'ing essentially and isn't really a solid reason why it should be buffed. 'its so bad that most people consider it to just straight up be making the game harder when using it's is a terrible argument against buffing it.
---
All just my opinion of course, but I think #1 is the only well grounded argument of the 3
---
If this happened then you'd almost have to put a base totem counter in the game to help compensate for the difference between SWF and solos. 
---
Might be kinda messy with haunted grounds too since you'd be forced to break one of them.
---
"My son was an astronaut when he was just 1!"
---
He was so broken pre rework. It was so unfun to play against and was way too op with mix tape and cold dirt
---
I like this idea. It would give people more motivation to cleanse them. Usually I'm the totem junkie with Small Game....it would be nice if they were a secondary objective.
---
“Try me, bitch!”- The Entity
---
My otp😘
---
There are tons of games that profit off of bm, they sell taunts, voice lines, sprays like "tea time" in Overwatch, it's been a part of pvp games since forever and for a ton of people that's part of the game's charm.
---
Those things are never meant maliciously, nobody is insulting you personally, it's just a game. I just think it's really silly some people get so angry about it. 
---
I couldn't care less if the survivor clicks at me or teabags me, I don't remember last game's BM by the time I load in to the next one.
---
Have you done one for Nea yet??? Love your work!!!
---
Don’t see a problem - you still outdid them point-wise.
---
Y only killers?
---
Salt.
---
I never said that I would report them I was suggesting that if someone has all the achievements it is likely that they can cheat in-game. Trying your best to insult me about feeling a certain way, something I have never talked about on this topic is contradicting yourself as your short temper tells me how quickly you were offended by words that you put in my mouth, maybe that makes you the snowflake?
---
Spirit is better and isn't that hard to get the hang of quickly.
---
I don't care about NOED. I want those delicious bloodpoints.
---
My point exactly no game should be balanced off its average or sub average playerbase...
---
Hell with 4 viable killers in the game 2 of them map reliant...
---
 
---
2 killers who are viable but require either map RNG and specific add-ons to gain that title...
---
And everyone else is pretty much garbage to be thrown away as the useless trash they are... 
---
But without much resistance most would agree trapper, wraith, and ghostface are the 3 worst killers in the game...
---
Wraith has no ability that helps him in anyway in chases or game stall...
---
Trapper has a chase tool but all you gotta do is check the spots where traps actually have an impact, and hold m1 on it for half a second and he has no ability at all...
---
His only real chase ability is the fake trap place which doesnt work on good survivors but I can use it against average ones...
---
Trapper also sacrifices 2 to 3 gens everygame just so set his ability up so it can be destroyed later on.
---
Imo thats a really good thing, means killers actually enjoy playing the game more and doesn’t feel the urge to farm up items and perks to get an enjoyable experience.
---
no u
---
I know this now this will be the last time
---
I would easily put GF, trapper, and wraith over leatherface and doc.
---
Probably didn't want to depip but still wanted to be nice
---
Either this or anal cream. This one has a painful smile though so aight, cop.
---
I love the little stop you did before continuing on 😂
---
Disconnect by Doorway
---
I swear, its always a purple hair feng/ nea that disconnects, after I downed them in a 10 second chase
---
Usually I just play killer though because it's more fun to play against incompetence then to play with it. As in a lot of survivors are really dumb. Also I try to be nice so if there's one good survivor and I just wrecked all of them because they were a shitty team I try to give the good one hatch so he doesn't get dragged down by trash lol
---
Another good one is when you got two people trying to heal you in the most obvious spot ever! And your just sitting there like "leave me alone" I also run the perk that lets you do objectives quicker when hurt so I get ballsy hahaha
---
Yeah no
---
Usually when I see a obvious 3 or 4 man I bring a moron just for the toxic person
---
Nurse is dancing to YMCA
---
I never understand those kinda survivors. Teabag god pallet loop break pallet slug mode activated " survivors starts to run erratically as if never been hit before" slap down. Wiggle and fight hard possibly with boiled over DC on hook
---
How do you know if the killer is running BBQ &amp; Chili?
---
I've survived that once!
---
The true flex is Shroud of Separation so that they think it's a mori.
---
I'm with you. People take this game way too seriously.
---
Are you dumb? Holy shit
---
Jesus Christ are you dumb. EAC is not going to detect anything because you aren't modifying pak files or injecting code. It's basically a console command. Have you ever played CS:GO? Do you know how many cvars they've had to lock down due to abuse? Nobody was banned. It's the developers fault that you can literally set r_fog to 0
---
As a rank 20 doctor main...
---
Sure dude like the time devs tried to introduce the proximity thing where sacrifice timer would freeze as long as the killer was on the hooked guy's terror radius and survivors abused it by having a guy run around the hook while the others did gens, survivors have abused the fuck out of everything they could so far in this game even when the devs had good intentions on improving certain aspects like camping.
---
The way you worded this message makes clear you are one of those survivors.
---
EUW Shoalinmaster2. All fun and games. Dont dc. Dc'ing is for oldheads :)
---
pisses me off when people do that...
---
Dont know why youre getting downvoted theres a whole different sub fir people that wanna see huntress with a cock fucking someone, like really no normal person wants to see your collection of body pillows and mouse pads than can be used as a fuck doll go post somewhere else
---
he meant dcs, which, yes are a reportable offense
---
EGC kinda proves that the entity literally can do whatever it wants to both the survivors and killers at anytime.
---
Wow okay, be rude.
---
Stolen post
---
Had my first game where this happened right now. I play solo and none of us were toxic. When the last gen was done he closed the app and we got zero points :( Can’t believe some people are that petty.
---
Haven’t played in around 10 days as I’m on holidays but I don’t think waiting times have changed all that much. Maybe after the first few days after freddy’s rework the queues were a bit worse. It can be really frustrating as a “survivor main” but at least I like to play killer as well
---
Hooks could just be changed to fit the killers theme like maybe p3 50 hags hook has a shaman look to it, but honestly I think it doesn't matter much, it just shows to survivors you didn't just pick random perks (for killer and survivor)
---
&gt;it's more fun to play against incompetence then to play with it
---
That could be on one of those inspirational quotes lol.
---
But I agree, playing Killer is mostly very enjoyable when you play solo
---
Breathtaking.
---
Email I believe
---
I'm being rude while informing the uninformed, who talk about things they know nothing about.
---
Tapp and huntress together.
---
You don't need to be a douchebag about it though, not everyone knows about that shit. I bet you have a lot of friends! Being rude to them while informing them about things they didn't know! Because everyone wants to be friends with a person like that.
---
I think the "balanced" gen slowing perks such as pop the weasel or surveillance or whatever are fine. The real issue is Ruins.
---
If you don't run ruins and you are using a M1 killer, its almost impossible to stop the gen rush even if you end every chases very fasts.
---
But the issue with ruins is its super rng based.
---
The best thing would be to increase gen repair time but remove ruins.
---
They hook my teammate and then go straight to someone else and hit/down them.
---
Or you have Distortion on (less likely)
---
Even after the 4th hook my teammates at rank 1 don't catch on to the fact that the Billy has BBQ and you need to hide in a locker or walk closer.
---
Maybe allow the killer to see all totems and place their hexes manually?
---
&gt; Might be kinda messy with haunted grounds too since you'd be forced to break one of them.
---
That's definitely a good point. Maybe need to add more totems. Like 10 totems and u gotta break 6/10
---
Are you here from Otzdarva?
---
I say the same of the swf and I get one hundred downvotes
---
&gt;There should be an incentive to hit people with bottles instead of just AOE’ing them.
---
Well, they did this in the form of his Iridescent addon, the pinky finger. Makes victims exposed with a direct hit; but I agree that a base-passive would make him more interesting
---
Yea exactly. Right now not much point other than counter a possible NOED.
---
Of course not.
---
If you had ruin up the whole game and still couldn't manage to apply enough pressure to kill them all, why get rewarded by having it turn into noed?
---
Well, now you know. The rest of the community should too because gaining an advantage by editing 1 line in your config is absurd.
---
Couldn’t agree more
---
Your ratio is off.   I'd put it closer to 1 good for every 100 toxic.
---
I will say, nothing is better than vomiting blood on two survivors teabagging across a pallet. 
---
She takes a lot of setup, but she's fun to play as.
---
I know, I contacted him, and he seemed fine with it.
---
Having a report option does not mean it's bannable. Unsportsmanlike conduct is a report option, doesn't mean tbaggers and campers are getting banned
---
People here in the comments are so lucky :( They can do dulls and escape with their team winning over a noed killer.. Me? If I spend time doing dull totems, by the time I do 3, there's probably 2 people dead ready to rage at me in post-game chat.
---
Dead by the previous evening
---

---
The babies in those giant helmets are adorable but I can’t imagine how heavy that metal is.
---
ps4, PSN: PinedaBro , on the dbd discord im BatGen#2742.  EST time zone. 
---
I have a mic but when i get into a game and become immersed you wont hear much from me
---
Kinda not since he quit dbd
---
Excuse me but new Freddy is so fun. 
---
As or against.
---
Never said it was bannable, but it will probably have some influence on the timeout when it comes out.
---
I have yet to see actual tunneling, just survivors making bad unhooks and then crying that they got punished.
---
Can confirm that on ps4 (at least in my experience) survivor queues are 3-5 min and killer queues are like 10 seconds. May also be when I play (usually late at night)
---
1 kill would've been nice lol.
---
as someone who has only played swf since the game came out (since swf was available that is) and only recently within the past week or so has been playing killer... seriously, what the fuck is with all the d/c's? I'm a surv main and sure i've yanked out my ethernet cable a few dozen times the year the game came out, but disconnecting and losing your items and points anyway while still giving the killer points??? Are kids really *that* mad over video games????
---
No he doesnt
---
Dayum bruh...
---
True, but dat BP!
---
MYC is a good perk but probably not for the Pig. By the time she gets back to the hook the rescuer is probably gone and then it's just dumb luck if you run into them. 
---
V. good on a Spirit, Nurse, Hillbilly, Hag, etc. Tho
---
Yup exactly. Even if it is meant maliciously then oh well just shows how pathetic the person being malicious is.
---
"Nurse = DC"
---
Yea that must be what it is. Not like it’s happened time after time. Silly me.
---
As a no rank main because rank is not on mobile yet..
---
A killer’s real challenge. Dead before disconnect
---
Flashlights can be annoying after the 18th blind with a single flashlight but it's always satisfying to finally hook them
---
thank you i’ll be here all night
---
They’re super rare
---
Lol you asked... like people dont have any idea how impactful a headset is... you pick up the most silent breaths from a survivor, the slight rustle of grass, footsteps, it even allows me to hear survivors in lockers cause they breath which saves me so much time.
---
Now hold on, the actor is NOT dbds pig
---
I think its cause people can get frustrated when they are getting owned 4v1 and they feel like teabagging can be "kicking them while they're down." Its still just part of any competive game in some way for better or worse, no reason to let it get to you.
---
Don’t know what to tell you, been working fine for me
---
Improved*
---
Doesn't make sense since he didn't unhook David yet.
---
Unpopular opinion? Dude I don't even know who you are, why should I know if you care when survivors teabag/flashlight etc.
---
Is blocking 3 gens for 120 seconds "very effective"? It can make finding the first surv more easy but I don't think it slows "very effectively" the reparation of gens, I can find another gen really quicky
---
Huge difference for killer, not much difference for survivor.
---
Press the sprint button, it cancels the heal. Works on the ground too if you don’t want them to farm you
---
Yeah, on mobile my b
---
its funny how I got downvotes
---
I play 80% survivor and 20% killer but nice try buddy. Tunneling is the result of you being trash or your team being trash.
---
Whats effects gameplay the most a tebag or an ebony mori nurse?
---
Lucky you, when I go against obvious 3-4 SWF, they designate one guy to DC (always one guy who's not red rank). One night I had it happen 6 times, same SWF, always a cancelled match.
---
Bro if you're tastezelemon you were also extremely toxic. Using autism as an insult, seriously? Then you have the nerve to tell THEM to grow up? Big oof.
---
Yes, hello.
---
Yeah yeah i get it, but like the explanation.. just dayum
---
I suppose so. In my opinion it's more about the side effects of the perk that make it strong. Finding the first few survivors is made a lot more easier with it, which can make a real difference. Also it's godly on Trapper and Hag
---
I thought keys take a few seconds to open the hatch.
---
I've never used a key.
---
"Buddy" bringing out the pro gamer moves now. Yes all the times tunneling occurs its because of a survivor being trash, not a killer. Makes sense. No such thing as a an asshole killer who wants to ruin you game. Its all survivors fault. If you truly believe that i doubt your percentages are correct cause yikes.
---
It was in the guys name, sorry.
---
You’re the reason why I’m excited dedicated servers are coming. Bans incoming.
---
Im okay with people bringing moris. No surprise for me
---
must be nice to swf only
---
try solo Q where 95% of teams are trash. you can pretth much expect to be farmed in front of killer, a dc after first down, or p3 claus being useless waiting for hatch
---
OOOOH. Okay, I've got you, sorry for judging so quickly.
---
Simple I just make sure those type of players die first which is painfully easy
---
worst comes to worst you can just try to die asap and go next instead
---
Thanks! :)
---
The plagg deude
---
Surprise: Moris are a game mechanic, D/Cs are not.
---
I didnt really even try to hide much man. He'd chase me for a few seconds then I'd lose him and hed go after someone else. Only one person got hooked so unhooking them was all th3 altruism I got.
---
Wheres the ass hats I'm suppose to see?
---
These days I just immediately start cleansing totems. If I'm gonna lose I'm gonna take 5k BP with me.
---
Go for a good pair of cans not the razer/logitech trash, the mh 751 from cooler master are good

the fuck? dbd doesnt even have any music beyong a few notes put together to make a ten second them that they loop on the menus. hope no one buys this blatant as fuck cash grab
---
DBD has tons of music my guy. And it’s streaming services..... you don’t directly pay for it
---
Name does not check out.
---
other games are balanced so that rage quitting is pointless because you respawn quickly or have a chance
---
this game on the other thinks triple iridescent killers are totally balanced against a team with zero items.
---
A lot of the time I bring up discussions about Adrenaline being overpowered because it's one of the most run Survivor perks in the game. Whenever I do I always get big brain P3 Megs telling me "wElL rUiN iS rUn AlL tHe TiMe sO iS iT oP?"
---
Put bluntly: Yes. Have you ever had a game where you can't find the Ruin totem?
---
I did the math: the 5% generator regression translates into 4 seconds lost on the gen. Tied with the 3 seconds that the generator sparks when you can't work on it and you lose a total of 7 seconds for every skill check you hit that isn't a great. Even hitting a great still loses you the value of the great check, though 1.5 seconds lost isn't nearly as bad as 7 (obviously.) ~~(These numbers also operate under the assumption that you aren't using a toolbox or working with other people.)~~  
---
If you don't hit greats on 11 skill checks (fairly easy to do imo over the course of a match) you've effectively *doubled* the time to finish a single gen. (80 second base time + 77 extra time.) No matter how you look at it doubling the time of a generator is overpowered, especially when you consider the alternatives and how little effect they comparatively have. (Pop Goes requires you hook a Survivor in order to remove a mere 25% (20 seconds) from the gen.)
---
Again the big issue is that the game is so heavily balanced around Ruin. I honestly think Ruin as a concept is fine but currently it's far too oppressive to have a single perk that can make or break a game. Increasing generator times with no way to make them faster ~~beyond bring toolboxes~~ would effectively be the same as giving every Killer a permanent Hex: Ruin. While I think it can be toyed with it's a very fine line between making the game too easy for one side or the other.
---
It's not an easy fix but it does need a fix, and I really wish BHVR would stop beating around the bush and tackle the problem head on, even if it ultimately results in them admitting defeat.
---
im friendly when the situation agrees with being friendly. this does not warrant friendliness
---
*gg ez baby killer LOL*
---
I think and I hope this is a desyncronization issue and will be solved someway, with dedicated servers or not.
---
On PS4 I typically get in a killer match much faster than when I play survivor
---
holy shit is that a ss13 reference?
---
It also could've just been a panic.
---
Nah dude thats just regular old latency same reason you die behind corners in fps games
---
*?
---
Thanks for the link. I definitely see your side of things, and you make some great points. 
---
My only comment would be that there are no actual stats on how many streamers are good/level-headed and how many are incredibly toxic. Even if more of them are toxic, I think it’s unfair to assume every one is toxic (and then target them specifically).
---
To sum it up, don’t judge a book by its cover.
---
I don’t completely main her, but I play her and Spirit almost all the time. But lately been playing more Plague. For reference I play at red ranks and have played her at rank 1. 
---
People in higher ranks obviously try not to cleanse, but that doesn’t always work. Staying in 1 hit downs (pair with Thanat) can be dangerous for them. I think she’s highly underrated. Yes, you will come across people who are really good loopers but you want to just leave them and find someone who is a bit more out of position and get it snowballing from there. When I feel like it’s going to be a challenging game I’ll go for Spirit, but Plague is perfectly viable at red ranks. I would maybe just avoid playing her if you’re going against red rank SWF as they’ll rush gens so quick and 100% won’t cleanse. She definitely plenty of fun though  :)
---
Oh no I’ll have to watch YouTube for 5 mins while your queue times grow even longer.
---
makes a huge difference, imo.  ive played with and without it and i do way better and can find survivors easier with a headset.
---
Sounds like you just don't like the game at all
---
Exactly. Might as well get as many BP as you can
---
It’s an optional soundtrack that is no extra charge if you subscribe to a music streaming service. Not really something to have a fit about, considering there’s so much more you COULD be angry about with this game.
---
Black Phillip killer when?
---
They get mad because it's a declaration of superiority. I personally teabag and flashlight click a killer that is weaker than me, especially when he makes mistakes with weapon swinging (hits the window or the pallet instead of me).
---
It probably downloaded in 2 parts, the 8.3gb was what allowed you to play the tutorial and do offline stuff. The rest allows online play.
---
Do you have a cleaner version of 0023.mp3 in the ghostface sound files?
---
&gt;Do not forget ruin's effect is even greater if multiple survivors are working on the same gen.
---
Not really, if the Survivors know how to let go of the gen when it sparks.
---
&gt;I think the opposite. The problem isn't just the balance of it, its also the whole concept of RNG based which is bad imo. Its poorly balanced AND poorly designed.
---
I think the core idea of "game being slow until you find something to make it faster" is good, and I'd much rather that over the game just being slower at the start. ~~Corrupt Intervention.~~ With that in mind I do agree that Ruin is a rather poor implementation of it, and I'd be quite happy with them adding "fuel cans" or other things that you'd need to gather to make repairing a gen faster.
---
&gt;The difference is now you can balance it properly (instead of doubling it like ruins does, you could increase it by just 20%), and it wouldn't be luck based.
---
Ruin doubles it in theory, and can be removed. The problem with this effect being permanent is that it would be a permanent buff to Killers. See my last point about me liking something in-game to make gens faster but not making it mandatory.
---
Honestly I'd actually really like it if they made toolboxes and stuff more disposable and put more of them around the map. I'd totally be down for all items lasting half as long but adding double the chests on the map. It would buff perks like Plunderer's / Ace in the Hole / Pharmacy while also serving to nerf items so that Killers don't feel the need to lobby dodge / bring Franklins if multiple Survivors have items.
---
This comes with the caveat that I don't want to spend 9000 Bloodpoints (brown item with two brown addons) to bring an item just to finish half a gen with it, but the Bloodweb needs a lot of reworking too.
---
Entity: Hold my beer.
---
I actually believe it's quite fair, let me spin this on you, if 20 streamers are nice and 1 is toxic, then bringing a Mori for all of them means I'm severely punishing all the nice ones for 1 thing.
---
Bringing a Mori for 20 toxic conversely means I'm prepared for toxicity for 20 instances even if 1 is innocent.
---
Except all those perks except Pop kind of blow.
---
Honestly
---
Swap “Teammates”  with “Me” and then it will be accurate
---
I never understood the concept that flashlights are toxic. They're an item in the game that's meant to be used. Are they annoying? Yes, but I'm honestly a lot more bothered by a gen being done 50% faster just because a Survivor spent Bloodpoints and held Mouse 2, as opposed to Flashlights which require me to make a mistake and for the Survivor to skillfully capitalize on it.
---
The sound of flashlight clicking is annoying and teabagging has always been viewed as BM in games, but with that in mind if a Survivor is doing it to their own detriment so be it.

Yes!!!

I can hear that last panel screeching

Is this a teaser for the next teaser? The reddit logo, moris you by strangling to death with a wire
---
It honestly really ticks me off when I walk around the map during the end game just to find the Survivor crouching on top of the hatch, just so they can teabag me before jumping in. Like congrats you found the random object that spawns completely based on luck before I did you want a cookie for the 10 minutes to spend touching yourself?

I just take it as a mori. "You beat them so bad they DC'ed!" Bonus for doing well lmao
---
It can only be used once per trial
---
&gt; Not really, if the Survivors know how to let go of the gen when it sparks.
---
Its still going to spark twice more often, so you end up not working on it twice more often.
---

Killers that don't run ruins do need a buff imo. Except for like Nurse, most Killers can't compete vs good SWF teams whitout ruins.
---

---
Sure probably a fun idea for both sides.
---
Ruins is far stronger and its not close.
---
Survivors don’t have to do bones, but we can still complain about Noed.
---
Lmao thanks mate xP
---
This behavior is unhealthy for the game and is more toxic than the 'toxic' streamers. I mod a small streamer for dbd and the streamer has ttv in his name. We play fun and we play fair. Sometimes we get dick bags like you that bring mories, and other times we get nice people who join us for a few games or even just to say gg. I hope this post doesn't get any more karma than it already has because this is a disgrace. It is the reason people call the dbd community toxic because it only feeds into an endless cycle of bm.
---
I mean I think the community agrees that she’s upper/mid tier. I don’t know how that’s underrated
---
Dont forget head on
---
Remember when everyone called Plague OP?
---
GOOD TIMES
---
Ah I see your just another troll trying to goad people. Waste of time.
---
If only it was Myers instead of plague.
---
r/dbdgonewild is that way.
---
But hey. Plague content.
---
If it's a waste of time, the why reply?
---
Could just you know, block me or move along idk. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Please oh god please go to the proper sub for this stuff
---
They’ll boost the search results when more people search for it. It just came out so it has no “traction” or that makes sense
---
he also gets lightbringer because killer diversion is a thing now
---
She’s definitely top tier but at least to me, playing her is kinda boring
---
No, it's not cheating. DBD chose to have their game support Freestyle (it's optional). They also have failed to lock down multiple config cvars including no fog, rendering mist offerings useless.
---
This needs S C I E N T I F I C TESTING
---
I’m living in the past, I never knew that
---
You should take a video in a game, kinda curious to see what it looks like
---
Because it's entertaining to see the lengths at which you will go for attention, so please, by all means continue.
---
I like the current one
---
As survivor, if you get screwed in the early game it's very possible to only get 2k or 3k points, which is basically a waste of time.  
---
I find that even my absolute worst games as killer net me about 10k points.
---
Poor Monto.
---
Big yikes
---
I agree with you. Im a killer main and i play like 30% survivor. And i only see tunneling during bad unhooks. Killers on xbox iv run into have been nice lately.
---
Maybe if you werent such an asshole youd have friends to swf with lmao
---
a full squad of Bill's is the best
---
Love it. Plague is one of my fave killers to play as and against
---
My only issue with her is that she's not great at grinding bp, so Ive been playing other killers until I can get all the perks unlocked I want.  (Almost there!!)  
---
  
---
Nurse is one of my best, Spirit is great, Pig is my fave (F), and then Plag is my up and coming.  Grinding up for Monitor rn, so hopefully thatll help
---
Mechanics are unbalanced im favor od killer - you literally named 1 thing which is not a problem at this point since you have 4 perks right now that can help you get off hook without the killer having a chance to catch you namely:
---
adrenaline (which works under very specific scenarios giving you a health state which i am counting sińce facecamping gives loads of time to do all the gens) 
---
borrowed time (which assuming the killer face camps you should activate every single time) 
---
And last but not least everyone favourite dicisive strike (which is now specifically an anti tunnel perk)
---
Deliverance (lets you unhook and works with dicisive strike)
---
You can also grab an instaheal or someone from your team can do that, flashlights saves are an option 
---
The only killer who can fuck both you and the person rescuing you is bubba but to be completely honest - if you get downed by a bubba you probably deserve to lose, this killer is dogshit
---
Oh and being put at mercy - this is a assymetric team game, if you fucked up against a power role just deal with it - only the top 2-3 killers making the most optimal plays can win 100% od the time but they wont - noone plays perfect
---
Thx for the advice
---
Gamepass is a pound for the first month if on xbox not sure if its on pc gamepass
---
Yesterday I denied a Billy with NOED. Anyone out here could be a clown in disguise folks. Arm yourselves with knowledge
---
Can we get one for cannibal next?
---
Nice. I got my 1st perfect game as Freddy after his update. A great feeling
---
I don't think they have gamepass and don't want to make extra steps for them like getting the pass for a month just to cancel it over 1 game I've been wanting them to try. It's a good backup, but figured free play weekends would be the best bet

Thought this was r/dbdgonewild for a sec, yea this is gonna get taken down by the mods.

r/lossofalovedone

I know right. The game has been the same as 3 years ago, only with a few improvements here and there. Also there are millions of people playing around the world and many of them are buying cosmetics and chapters. They got the money flowing into their bank accounts but still they don't invest in something major that improves the quality of life (except servers I guess), especially on console where the game is still a shitshow. I mean a game like this, in 2019, is simply unacceptable, but people keep throwing money at them so I don't think we're gonna get major improvements in the near future (and I'm being optimistic).
---
I would actually main Ghostface if this was a thing AND it made a 'baa' sound each time I teabag'd.

&gt;Have a good day.

I know that's why a lot of people do it I guess my point is why would I get mad at some random nerd trying to flex by spamming crouch?
---
I don't know but I know what they season it with.
---
I mean the entity is a god so they probably don't need to.
---
Shattered Bloodline has one of the best killers in the game and some really good perks.
---
Yep this is a good idea. Make it usable TWICE, but also make it unusable if the Killer hooked someone else in between.
---
I've had a few games where my FPS dropped to 1 and it's so annoying
---
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S1-7-JMYO_X9MYx7zoWrBFpl_R9mJQn1/view?usp=drivesdk
---
Imo, no. Often times you spawn with your teammates anyways so the other secret offerings are already useless. If that happens and you use vigo's, that is one happy killer.
---
I dislike using Ruin because in my experience Ruin is 99% of the time gone super fast, and corrupt intervention is much more "Reliable". Sure it is countered by just waiting but at least it lasts 120 seconds, which is longer than any time I used Ruin before I simply gave up and switched to CI.
---
Yes.
---
It's a mix. This game has lots of issues. Behavior knows these, and are trying to fix them without changing the game too much (many people stop playing game because they change too much). BP grind is infinite, so that will never change. Players, both sides, will bitch about many things. A long time ago, survivors would get in 4 man groups and bully a killer. The flashlights, insra-heals, brand new parts, DS, it was a mess. Rank 1 was like esports to killers. Survivors could win 90% of the time (Swf). Solos was a very interesting game. Killers called out survivors bitching, and then came the fighting. Survivors bitched about BBQ, Fraklins, any perk that gave the killer a one-up. Killers fought fire with fire and they bitched about DS, Adrenaline, and the usual top tier perks. When Behavior brought a huge balance, survivors pleaded with thier perks. I remember Bodhi saying "Just make (DS) an item or something". That wouldn't change anything, and he knew. But the game seems alot more balanced now do hopefully we can avoid that again.
---
I have not played this week...... Its been the best week of DBD to date!
---
Regardless of playing solo or with people, you should be trying to maximize your loop value.
---
"Ruin your gameplay experience"
---
This is a good question.
---
Optimally you should save as many pallets as possible, but when i watch streamers i notice they often are too greedy and end up getting caught. I think that when in doubt, its way better to waste a pallet than get caught.
---
As an example, even if you literally just wait at pallets and wasted them all, you could probably run around the Killer long enough so that your team can do like 4+ gens.
---
Think about it. Running the killer around for just 1:30 minute is already 3 gens done if you have 3 partners alive.
---
She can wear tight enough tops to be able to toss hatchets.
---
A 2v4 or 2v5 mode in DbD would be easier to do and cooler. It'd be like regular DbD, but killers would fight each other. Wouldn't need new maps too accomodate all those people either.
---
The new killer looks great
---
I too am a person of well defined tastes!
---
I waste them if I have to like if it's a clown with the Bleach(extra hindered add-on i believe) I ain't risking it but I always make sure there's atleast 2 pallets in each area  so my team isn't completely doomed if they are around there.
---
I mean if you just move toward it at the beginning its usually guaranteed to last at least 1 minute or 2.
---
It actually is if you’re waiting for a killer to leave the gen area, idk how it is on Pc but I can shit out a ton of videos on PS4 from killers walking past me or losing me from a chase because of bushes from Ormond/Myers map/ ice room pig map/ lery’s/ and any hook in corn fields ( the lighting buff didn’t help I guess lol)
---
Choosing not to play is not a tactic.
---
I try to save the good one’s but all that ends up happening is the next teammate to get chased throws down the Shack Pallet immediately anyway and uses all the safe loop Pallets within 30 seconds.
---

Remember when she used to move at full speed when purge was charged? D:
---
No it's not just you cuz this is a repost
---
Yeah but almost every time it's "Oh there's my ruin off in the distance let me go check i- AAAAAAND IT'S GONE!"
---
I get what you're saying, but I don't think you get what I'm saying.  If I'm *first on the hook*, I'm at the mercy of literally everyone else except me. 
---
Adrenaline -- is going to be 100% useless for me, because I'll be dead before it ever activates.
---
Borrowed Time -- I have to hope that my teammates have it, and that the person who comes to get me is willing to potentially end up in the same situation I was just in.  Even with this perk, there's a very strong chance I'll just get tunneled anyway, since I'm playing against a face camper.
---
Decisive Strike -- could work, but first I have to rely on someone else pulling me off the hook while the killer is staring at me, then i have to hope i can escape and not get tunneled.
---
Deliverance -- is literally a wasted perk slot if I'm the first person hooked.
---
And really, the best move for my team at that point is to gen rush and let me die, while I just stay alive as long as possible to buy them time.
---
I'll admit that face campers almost never get 4k's, but my point is that being a survivor *always puts you in a situation in which you have to hope the killer is going to "play nice".*
---
It's not even slightly fun when you get camped, and you don't even get points as a compensation for being camped.  
---
So, the game mechanics can be used to *create an incentive for people to rage quit*, and everyone who plays DBD knows that DCs happen a lot more in this game than in others (and it's almost always survivors doing it).  That's why I consider the mechanics to be broken:  the killer can literally choose to make the game more annoying than fun.
---
Yeah, I just see so many salty survivors telling me they’ve RePoRtEd me for not playing how they like. Most of me knows it’s bull but I guess I get a bit nervous
---
I never understand why survivors dont want the BP they got from me chasing them. You want BP but still gonna lose? Do totems, easy 1k.
---
Yeah, if a game is going south, I'm a dedicated totem hunter.
---

Actually a killer main, but would love some decent teammates as I am improving playing as survivor peepoHappy. Currently @ rank 8, hmu.
---
If they wont change her base kit, i hope they make add-ons that
---
A: prevent survivors from seeing box auras but extend the timer.
---
And B: all RBT's timer starts so long as the first generator has been completed.
---
(They could also change the box odds from being 50% chance per box to being 25% per box for 4 boxes. As well as change a few add-ons that dont encourage tunneling).
---
UwU
---
Yup.
---
How is it a buff to tunnelers what
---
Real talk though... Do people ACTUALLY use the report function?
---
Try it now. Should be fine. Had to encode.
---
stop crying because you've fell victim to the dream pallets. Freddy is in a good spot rn we dont need the community to cry their way into getting him changed again.
---
Because u can use it twice instead of only once like right now.
---
All three of teammates dced because we were up against Legion, what bunch of babies.
---
Ghostface is a somewhat unique situation. Ghostface in DbD is their own character, all they had to do was get the licensing to use the mask. 
---
Pig and Tapp took a really long time, and I'd imagine they're painstakingly trying to get cosmetics for the other licensed characters, but that requires them to (likely) make designs and show them to the license holders who have to approve and then work out how much they want for the rights to release cosmetics.
---
Since i main billy this never happens to me :P Takes 14 seconds to cleanse, i get there before.
---
Take my upvote as he takes the downvote.
---
Idk just an Ide
---
Well maybe he did. Or maybe he's not seen Ted 2. (Assuming he's a he).
---
Awww most I find are fine. I always run jump scare hag to give em a scary time.
---
She's not the size of a toddler.
---
I do see your point, but let's take your face camping concept here.
---
DBD is an asymmetric survival game. 1 vs 4.
---
The 1 being a powerful killer who can easily slaughter, but is only one. The 4 being survivors, weak players who must stay hidden from the killer, and have many tools and tactics for staying alive, and, their biggest advantage, being in numbers.
---
To win as a killer, you must sacrifice a sufficient amount  survivors and be good at chases and stopping gens from being repaired.
---
To win as a survivor, you must do gens, help others, avoid the killer and escape.
---
Let's say a killer gets ya 2 minutes into a match, 1 gen done, and he facecamps you and you go the full 2 minutes or something on the hook, the others will easily be able to get all the other gens done and escape.
---
So the killer probably broke a pallet, hit you twice and gets a full sacrifice on you, he'll get like 7 thousand blood points, a handful of xp and probably one bronze emblem. While the survivors got a bunch of gens done really fast, probably a few items and maybe a totem or two, and escaped. That's most likely a safety pip or maybe even one pip. 
---
Withen the face camping strategy you are talking about being in favour of killers is really false, sense it goes towards a depip and measly loot for them, effectively making him lose.
---
I do understand what you're talking about not being able to effectively counter it, but it does result in a loss for a killer, so it can't really be a broken mechanic in favour of their side.
---
New account for learning the Nurse, yet plays Billy . . .
---
Yeah that checks out.
---
Also rank reset was recent so a lot of the crap-ranks are actually high-end survivors.
---
Just finished season 1 and holy shit i was entertained the whole way.

Wimps like you are the reason he got nerfed to hell, please learn how to play the game before making such shit, emotion fueled posts like this.
---
They say they have 130 employees, but bhvr moving at a turtle speed. Took them 9 freaking months to somewhat fix console performance, over a year to rework Freddy, some major bugs left in a game for months. I wonder that a hell are they even doing most of their work time, because it doesn't seem they are being very productive. 
---
Like yea, we can't make bunny Feng, because we are working on dedicated servers... What a hell are these two things even have in common? Do artist program the game? Which would actually explain a lot. Yea, we have plans, we have plans, but nothing changes. New killer added with new garbage perks no one will use, or if they are good, get nerfed immediately, go back to using same 6 perks, we don't like variety. They are scared shitless to add something too OP, so we get nothing. And as survivors we will never get anything good again after mettle of man fiasco. Just random perks which work once every 10 game if you lucky. Or meme perks like pebble and head on, so YouTubers could make funny videos of these garbage perks actually working. Hahaha, so funny.
---
Holly rant, I went to a dark place but fuck it. Instead of doing something new they still to this day have to fix their failures in map design, killer design (legion anyone?), perk design, and in just everything. They will have to actually fix ghostface someday too, because removing him from shroud rules are made and work how they want. And nurse.... Oh the nurse............. Oh the nurse....................................... Changing add ons, nice, most nurses play without them anyway. And 4k in 3 minutes.
---
Hardcore tunneling is just unfun. I lose 2 gens every second I tunnel. You have DS, Borrow Time, bodyblocking. What do you mean you cant fight that? Tunneling is the last thing any killer would do (besides DC). They know the survivor isn't having fun, and they aren't either. Some killers powers promote anti tunneling. There are perks to stop tunneling, Play w/ food, BBQ (the BP bonus), and many more. Play some killer instead of making unfounded claims.
---
The Wiki page can give you a better description of how it works, but basically when they hook someone they can see everyone else's aura for 4 seconds, but only if they're far enough away or not in a locker.
---
If your teammate gets picked up and is about to be hooked you can slowly get in a locker. Then once they get hooked, you wait 4 seconds, then slowly get out.
---
Either that or if you're close to the hook when they get hooked, just stay put because they can't see your aura from that close.
---
You saw the grab animation start. It was lag, happens every now and then when both killer and survivor are in a conflict about grabs
---
it looks like the mobile version tbh
---
^Facts^
---
Well, that's your opinion. When Survivors teabag at the exit gate, it's not saying "GG", it's BMing you.
---
Personally, I don't understand why people like you think it isn't when it's been proven that Survivors are conveying that message by teabagging.
---
if u dc i report
---
I did that once for this reason. 3 dcs upon hooking in one game i was the only one not hit/found despite having pulled two people off of a hook. When i was alone, I decided fuck this, found the killer and waited for him to end the game. Aaaaaaand that particular killer wanted to watch me bleed out and take as long as possible with it.
---
Ohhhh now the table has turned on the other side,that is the side you are on
---
At least he’s kinda nice about it
---
Kinda
---
What is tunneling?
---
i mean .. look how cute he is.
---
Its ridiculous how true this is.
---
Thats exactly what happens,I leave the good pallets for the team but when I watch them while doing a gen they just throw it immediately to avoid a hit and don’t loop it
---
Some survivors would rather Take the L than learn strats other than loop, flashlight, and swf.
---
You’re bad mouthing both my boys Ghostface and Wraith and that’s a problem that I will do absolutely nothing about.

As a tactic to get attention I don’t mind, it’s just after a long game of getting completely destroyed and frustrated, it feels like being kicked when you’re down.

---
+ Empathy means i know wheres safe to go next
---
Well, maybe it's more fair to say that the game is broken on both sides.  I've definitely had survivors make me their bitch before as killer..
---
That said, even if you have a terrible killer game you're probably at least going to get some points.  If you're getting camped as a survivor, you're gonna walk with a completely negligible amount of points.  That's why I think you see more survivor DCs than killer DCs.
---
That’s if your team even touch gens lol
---
Lol thanks for that great observation, it’s almost like I put the persons Instagram in the comments to give credit 🤔
---
Thats why literally everybody one runs it? i know yall survivor mains like to make excuses for why all your BS aint BS but DS3 is active for an entire minute, if i go back to the hook after patrolling literally the entire map &amp; you're just finally trying to hooksave that aint camping, also leading the killer to or looping the killer around the hook area isnt camping either
---
It’s agony when killers do this. 😅 I try really hard not to be toxic, but you get into a situation where you’re at the mercy of the killer unless you DC. At that point, if they want to farm points, you can only go along with it or just stand there, and that is not a fun gaming experience lol
---
Lemme guess , ur a dwight main
---
I agree! I was a big fan of her cardigan and skirt look in the first movie, and having an outfit based off the Rob Zombie remake would be a nice change too. Older Laurie from 2018 movie would be kickass, but I don't think they'd have the rights to that. I also had the idea that a Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz costume would be really cute too.
---
No(p)ed
---
Well if you are a low rank player with the kind of partner that don't touch gens much, then its way easier to run be more "optimal" and save pallets more. The issue is more at red ranks where any tiny mistake will get caught by the killer.
---
exactly like all those spirit players using purple + pink addons which are not display in end game scoreboard. You're like : "Wtf that was without addons ???"
---
This reminds me of how fortnite added titans after the devs of apex said that it wouldnt be balanced in a BR.
---
I stream on Twitch, but I don’t have TTV or Twitch in my name and seeing people with TTV in their name infuriates me for a different reason. When you put TTV in your name, it’s almost like you think because you stream on Twitch, you deserve to be seen. It makes you look like a giant douche. You’re a sheep. 
---
Big streamers don’t have that shit in their name because it doesn’t work. If you’re not good enough to bring in viewers without lazily advertising yourself by putting TTV in your name, then you don’t really deserve to be seen.

Underrated comment
---
I elaborated more in the comments but part of it is also I dont care if they are BMing me. If someone wants to be an immature dickhead when they dont even know me it just reflects badly on them not me.
---
Oh is this from the killer's rulebook for survivors?
---
I agree that it's a bad strategy for a killer, but that doesn't stop it from happening *a lot more frequently than it should*, and it may not be the only cause for survivor DCs, but it definitely is one.
---
As a survivor, I'd just be happy getting some extra points because I was camped.
---
JUDGE EYES
---
YES
---
But you do realize balance is what makes things enjoyable right? Why would I want to play against two killers both chasing me at the same time and ending a loop? 
---
Or one hunting while one camps and tunnels. 
---
Sorry, but while people THINK this is a cool idea, it will not work with the way the game is laid out right now.
---
Except that you're a Trapper that only needs to hit survivors once. Why does everyone always forget this? Like her Corrupt Purge is great, but she doesn't need it, and it's not the thing that makes her a good killer, it's just the thing that makes her fun to play.
---
Only if no one else is, I hate to say it but bloody survivors scare me so I tend to make sure they are dealt with. But I mostly like to kill people in plain cloths and let people with unique outfits go.
---
&gt; i just said screw it and went for the help
---
you mean you had borrowed and wglf, intended to farm her and probably die
---
&gt; also go lucky he didnt grab me
---
like i stated, grabs have been utterly fucked for a while.
---
&gt; got lucky he didnt hit me again before i jumped in
---
doesnt matter at all. you can still hop in while downed. it can be a ***bit*** finicky but you can still get it ez pz.
---
Theres only 5 licensed killers out of the 16 i think more than  1/4 of the killers being licensed wont be a huge deal.
---
Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.

Michael left since pink haired Nea found him in a locker. I wanted to die.

Btw do you guys like go And check youre Ruin or what hex perk you have At the start of the game or not? Presonaly i think it is a waste of time And when i am playing surviver i Find myself finding the hex 40% of games beacouse killers go to it first
---
You dont pallet loop nurse, you hide from her. Her only strength is when she finds a survivor. She has no map control or gen slowing. Maybe the best choice isn't the first.
---
I doubt anyone would take this mode seriously. It would be just for the memes, like let's say rumble mode in rocket league.
---
A lot of these are unfamiliar. Like the licence plates, cap, boards ect
---
i dont think ive ever had a Swf that wasnt a group of tryhards tryna annoy the fuck out of me, and wither i win or lose im getting attacked in messages a by these assholes.
---
Happened to me once, used BPS and so did two survivors. Game was over in no time at all and no one got much for it. Biggest waste ive seen.
---
License killers are great and all but original killers means more unique concepts, think about how similar ghostface is to pig and Shape that’s because they are all the same kind of jump out slasher characters from movies,
---
Are the perks good at least
---
Get your damn hands of my gurl!
---
Then there's a 'fix' for it! If you're being camped or more attractive to the killer then other survivors you can gain alot of points for being the 'distraction'. It would need a bit of work but it would certainly be a really welcome addition.

Not a single one.
---
As a killer I'd recommend never using this perk or at least not using it with any totem perks. Because as a survivor the moment I load into a match and see the gens blocked I'll just spend that time cleansing all the totems.
---
I guess that's why some killers will spot you even through impenetrable vegetation walls... Just had one like that
---
Bassically, the killer decides to focus on one survivor. In more extreme cases, the killer even ignores other survivors just so they could get to the other survivor quicker.
---
*I am so Confused right now* but i fucking love this response lmao
---
Why not

Literally 3 times today
---
Freaking brilliant idea
---
He’s too powerful for the game
---
That’s very true. I’ve had it lately where I am behind the person I hooked and they’re exposing me. They definitely need to tweak the way it works.
---
They were testing the number at 6% per survivor on the PTB at some point, and the perk actually became useful for like a week without being completely OP. Then they nerfed it again. Because fucking BHVR.
---
Reset is just buffed PGTW
---
Determination is a confusing ball of trash
---
And kill or be killed is overpowered.
---
I also find it very annoying. My guess is they would rather start a new game instead of starting with a disadvantage.
---
Imagine the sheer amount of sodium in this community with NOED and Eye of the Storm
---
Sometimes bhvr will release a solo character because they cant think of a counterpart that would fit the other, or maybe some perks for that charachter at the time. Or the more probable thing, make quick money.
---
Theses are called paragraphs instead of chapters. Maybe someday they can just release a paragraph that complements another and merge them into a chapter, idk.
---
Yeah, that's about right.
---
Um aren't you the dude who posted saying you leave every match theres a mori? Lmao wow man
---
I mean, do you want back times when almost no one played killer because it was extremely annoying to play against survivors using glitches, infinites and basically bullying killer even solo? Let's not pretend the game has been always in favour of killers, that's completely untrue.
---
Camping is problem, yes. But literal camping after catching first survivor. However I got called "camper" many times, even though I try to roam as much as I can. The thing is, when I see some dumb survivor trying to unhook someone in front of my eyes, what should I do? Just turn my head away? Yes, I got called camper for these situations for years, basically since the release. Also when some moron on higher ranks was wasting my time on infinite loops, you can bet I was facecamping him and enjoyed his salty tears.
---
Look, I'm not camping, never did. I'm not saying you said this, but seeing some people on this sub wanting it to be reportable behaviour is just ridiculous. Survivors bullying killers are just as annoying.
---
i don't see how they 'ruin the gaming experience' i don't see any harm in taking what, 20-30 minutes max to get a fair amount of bloodpoints ('fair' meaning enough to get like 5 items or something because the bp economy is going through some massive inflation')
---
Yep. Played that one game with the config. Deleted it and was amazed at how much better you can see with it. It's night and day.
---
Did you get 4 stacks of BBQ? If so, you won. GG.
---
Both are op. I posted about it yesterday. No counter play to a spirit that watches what you do then phases. Only luck.
---
I don’t hate TTV. I have friends that have TTV in their name. One of my closest friends is a TTV streamer. He admitted to me and 4 other friends DURING HIS STREAM that he only has it in his name because he doesn’t know how to network.
---
My point is these streamers use TTV as a solution to their ignorance about what it means to be a streamer.
---
I agree. It’s not easy to be a streamer. It’s hard work. Putting TTV in your name is not going to make it easier. Do the work. Network. Create content. Make an effort.
---
It’s a job not a get rich quick stream.
---
Also told him I could do a nice photoshop before posting.
---
I am absolute trash with a flashlight, so I ignore those. Also doesn't help that I'm on Xbox. But those medkits with, and without, the insta heals are great too.
---
I'm a hypocrite what can I say?
---
its boring and not what I expect when when I Start the game. I want chases, jukes, traps and maybe scares.
---
wasting 30 minutes on maximizing points can be alot for everyone who cant play that much
---
Git gud
---
I did. So yea that’s true. But they def felt like top rank survivors the whole game lol.
---
Ya that’s true
---
Just learn how to juke against nurse, and use your ears against spirit? I’m not saying it’s easy but it’s certainly not difficult.
---
Literally had that happen to me yesterday, a bill was hiding while I was chasing everyone else, took me basically ten minutes to find him and when I did he found the hatch
---
I'm still a few weeks into playing if that's your speed lol. I'm missjersey1246.
---
More like Nurse = DC. You don’t need a Mori to fuck up a survivors day
---
Because the licence of ghostface (FILMS) and ghostface (character's MASK) are different licences, they didn't pay anything to the creators of Scream, they paid to the creator of the GhostFace mask, that's why GF's outfit is different in dbd, it's not like the movies, only the mask is the same
---
funny because the guy in the first pic got a bullseye. nice ableism bud
---
*The power slap* dude don’t know why but that shit made me laugh so hard
---
quit spamming you garbage here
---
I used to be, but the best way to practice is to bring a yellow one in with a battery and a grip. When the killer goes to break a pallet, shine it in there face. It’ll narrow, then spread out once they’re blinded. It’s really fun (and annoying) getting saves by blinding the killer
---
Killers are already OP versus survivors soloing. Deal with the SWF every now and then. I solo survivor all the time. It isn’t any better when I get baited and farmed either. It’s part of the game
---
This is why I wear cosmetics. However I do play Claudette so I dont even try to fight it.
---
If youre going up against a lot of spirits and nurses, run iron will
---
Lol! Have you seen spirit? What do you do when she has you at a pallet and then fake phases? If you run away she phases and hits you, of you vault into her she hits you. If you stay there guess what, she hits you! There is NOTHING you can do against a good spirit. Everyone knows nurse is op so I won't even mention her.
---
ok dwight
---
Killers are far from OP to survivors who can use perks to work around the killer. This game is still super unbalanced either way.
---
Then you did pretty damn good, especially as Freddy.
---
woah epic gamer meme bro, haha epic!
---
Add me! My unsername is demetriustt222

The best part about dedicated servers will be the tracking and punishment for people who commonly dc. Reading the inevitable false-ban posts here will be a glorious era. So tired of losing games to these morons.

And I thought the people with a cloning killer were dumb
---
wow you have big brien
---
Can’t be toxic if a killer runs a perk freely available to them, designed by the devs, not nerfed or changed, never denounced by the devs? Sorry bud you ate just wrong.
---
I used a white ward on a purple med kit yesterday. Survived and lost both somehow. This game is flawless

N
---
Meh he is decent but not great in my opinion.
---
There is no "git gud" vs god tier nurses. You can only pray they make mistakes.
---
Sometimes dude. You’re gonna need to let the killer intentionally find you to help out the team.
---
He starts it with pure intimidation.
---
Looks like a scary killer. Imagine being chased by a wolf...
---
That's pretty toxic to assume any time you DC you must be a pussy. People cheating in your game? Pussy. People suddenly have much worse ping than they did in lobby and you want to leave? Pussy. People trying to intentionally make you hate playing the game (survivor or killer)? Pussy.
---
Entity does some magic shit allowing him to turn it on just by raising it and turn it off by lowering it. Honestly the only answer I have.

Honestly this is so wrong. It's literally such a good perk u are Probably just a smelly cunt who flames people in end game lobby

Wtf is a pretend wife

what the hell did you say to get banned

Nurse 100% needs a nerf
---
Spirit isn't very fun to play against but i wouldn't call it broken like nurse.

See, i want how he physically does it with entity bs

i called the person a fatass type 2 diabetic with high blood pressure and that he needs to get a day time job

lol you know it!

I mean you play games to have fun, and if people want to take that fun away why are you playing?

Gwar would also be sick as hell.

You're not wrong. I only expect ruin to be up for one hook.  Amy more is bonus but all I want is at least one hook

You get pts as killer for not tunneling right?
---
Bubba doesn't need perks, he got a chainsaw :^)

it's some magical chainsaw that probably activates if you pull some sort of trigger, since he is a tinkerer

or maybe these kinds of chainsaws actually exist i dunno

We just don't know. Like how does Ghostface make people instadown just by looking at them or Plague consume bloody vomit and injure with it.

Where do they get that?

Don’t go to tier three on me please
---
There's no really tips for him. He is the easiest killer to play.
---
Just remember to use your EW3 wisely as it is limited to 4 times in a match. And also remember to stalk a survivor to 99% of EW3 and activate when you are right behind a healthy survivor
---
meh Billy is right where I would like all top tier killers to be. nurse has always been on the OP side of things but honestly it's been like this for so long there's really no point in nerfing her. theres enough good killers now that it's not just nurse over and over so it's pretty bearable. most aren't that good anyways so it's aight
---
They don't as it is too much of a safety risk.
---
Looks good but I think the clasdic pose with the saw above his head would've been better.
---
Can someone tweet this to the game director?
---
What killer did you play vs them? (Just curious)
---
Maybe it has a starter motor, duh.
---
Most of these perks either don't work on their own and need a pairing perk or are just bad
---
True, but how does it start, like is there a pull cord?
---
What are you on? If you are on the PS4 pressing the touchpad makes the controls inverted and back if you touch it again
---
Or just until someone gets a skill check on a gen (for ruin). Just how hexes should work imo.
---
You're on the bleeting edge of technology.
---
This isn’t worth it anymore. You’re too far gone
---
Omg I’m not saying it’s a constant thing but every now and then my controls will invert when I’m hooked and I know that I haven’t pressed the touchpad
---
Ya dude you honestly deserve it and I'm not even a killer main
---
There are 2 different edits of Curse of Michael Myers. Maybe you were exposed to one and not the other.
---
Bruh, there's no way bubba is higher than Ghostface
---
wow, glad I am not a PC player, that just doesn't even look fair to play with those settings.
---
Yeah someone else requested that too, I'll definitely have to do that
---
You completely deserved the ban. Maybe if you weren't such a toxic person, you wouldn't get facecamped.
---
&gt; in favor of killers
---
Are you shitting me? What possible mechanic is brokenly in favor of a killer? The only thing you seem to be citing is camping. That's not a mechanic any more than endlessly looping is a mechanic. 
---
&gt; If the killer decides...I don't stand a chance...game is just over for me at that point
---
Ok, and? That's the way it goes, like it or not. It gets so old when people treat this game like Call of Duty. This isn't team deathmatch; it's more search and destroy. You get one life, and if you're the person killed first, then that's the way it is. You get to play another round and try again, and while I sympathize with the whole having to queue for another round thing, at least the process doesn't take that long. There's no rule anywhere that says you have to be "merciful" or "fair" in this game, so if you don't like it, then this game, and others like it, aren't for you. You aren't entitled to "the full experience" in a match. You survive as long as you can, and if that happens to be a short period, then it's a short period.
---
&gt;  totally at the mercy of my opponent
---
I don't know what part of this is so difficult for people to understand, but *it's supposed to be that way*. You're supposed to be at the mercy of the killer, not able to stand toe to toe with him. Your level of choice in how or when you die is dictated by how well you play. Outside of that, it's up to the killer, the altruism of your team, and dumb luck.
---
Well depending on the level of the perk you have to break 4 pallets (1), 3 pallets(2) and then 2(3) pallets. The ( ) are the level of perk
---
is there a pull cord on your car?  Or does it perhaps have ... a starter motor?
---
Well, looked trough steam on my phone just to be sure, and neither of them are called chapter there. Just "Ash vs evil dead" and "Ghost Face". On the wiki however, ghostface is called a chapter while ash vs evil dead is a paragraph
---
What? Why? It's a gameplay mechanic.
---
Killer power is pointless and eye of the storm and downfall are ridiculously trash perks
---
He’s disappointed in all of us
---
Cake.
---
But how does he start the motor?
---
Please take my updoot for a 10/10 comment.
---
I had the same question at first. The campfire is the loading screen and you automatically have a boost to your healing speed when you’re in the match with botany knowledge.
---
This sums up my luck
---
this made me forcefully exhale through my nose. Thank you
---
Whoa there save some pussy for the rest of us
---
Fuck dude, yeah, you deserve the ban
---
Are you for real right now?
---
Yes, i want real answers
---
claud probably picks them from the other dimension she enters to turn invisible
---
Shot had a game last night where we had to grat cakes and those bastards let me die on first hook then billy slugged 2 others just before I died and went after the 4th survivor and we only had 1 gen done and maybe 2 mins into the game
---
Nah, but there is a discount for killers.
---
And we both know that BHVR doesn't do jack crap with those reports.
---
Its really hard to say from my perspective, Mostly it can be because the survivor hates putting up with smart killers or being out played, Or the survivor in general getting bum fucked by the RNG that is the spawn positions.
---
I've stayed in matches where i have been hooked in the first 20 to 30 seconds into the match, only to be tunneled cause the 3 man SWF are gen rushing instead of one doing me a favour and tanking a hit for me to prelong the chase.
---
In all fairness their is a plethera of reasons as to why people leave, but the most common and understandable one is
---
**RNG**

But if you kill your self on hook after being out played within the first 30 seconds, Tbh to me i percive them as a little bit small minded?
---
It's not the action itself, it's the meaning behind it, so that's what pisses off the killer. It's like giving the finger to someone: the action is not offensive in itself, but the meaning behind it is.
---
He has a button.
---
Does it make sense? No...
---
But ghosts faces power on paper is pretty good...
---
In-game its not... hes far to easy to hear since he makes a audible flapping noise from 24 meters and makes a leather stretch sound from 16 meters when leaning or crouching ir standing.
---
Since everyone uses a headset he basically has a 24 meter terror radius in stealth lol.
---
He also has no snowball potential like Myers...
---
While myers can 99% his tier 3 for a max impact moment...
---
Ghostface cant really 99 survivors...
---
If I manage to stalk someone undetected I'll 99 them, creep close before exposing so I close when the chase begins... but as far as 99 survivors it's literally impossible.
---
Because you lose all stalk progression on that person once you hit them...
---
If I 99 2 people or whatever and I get revealed before finishing the stalk... and I hit them I lose all that progress and I'm a default m1 killer.
---
Ghostface could be viable if- they remove ALL SOUND HE MAKES while in stealth... perfect silence only rustles grass like everyone does...
---
-and make it so survivors stalk progress remains the duration of the entire match until they are exposed and downed... then and ONLY then will stalk progress reset...
---
This means ghostface will actually be able to be a sneak boo, and it means he will be able to expose people cause even if he gets 25% stalk he will eventually fill that bar since he will have that progress to build on top of until they are exposed...
---
This makes him an m1 killer with the potential to 1 shot down a few times per match roughly at his choosing...
---
But no hes loud and he loses stalk progress when he hits someone normally sucks to suck but that's why hes bad.
---
Leatherface at least 1 downs given open space of a late game dead zone and I think that's more consistent and better than ghostface at red ranks at least... low ranks ghostface is called OP...
---
Thank you! ( ♥ 3 ♥)
---
Play as you want! Don't feel bad for playing as long as you don't tunnel or camp.
---
I usually let the last one escape if I'm in a good mood.
---
To be fair, neither would OP considering how much of a whiny baby he seems to be about getting killed in a game.
---
Yes, this is gen repair simulator
---
Nope, you play what and how you want, if survivors gets salty just ignore them, you did what you should do as killer. Kill. Don’t let any survivor or killer change that. You play your own playstyle.
---
I mean yea sure. If I get credited
---
You dropped this /s
---
No as the killer your objective is to sacrifice all survivors. However if you want to give the last dude hatch that's fine imo
---
Hey OP, do you take constructive criticism?
---
PS4 UK, just looking for some people to play the game with, PSN is tinytempah4 feel free to add me up and shoot me a message.

Spine chill, or lithe but i recommend keeping lithe
---
Just to hazard a guess: I would say the vanilla test was to see the balance between killer and survivor and test escape rates and such.
---
Thanks for commenting! And I give hatch sometimes to the people that I think have earned it too
---
I mean it's pretty much the only killer where skill check perks are useful. Since his madness makes it so you have skill checks in random parts of the screen, those perks are like 10 times better
---
No, it's your objective to kill all four survivors so don't listen to a P3 Claudette that burnt her whole flashlight to save her buddy five times calling you toxic for sacrificing or MORIng her
---
So some r/guro material  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ?
---
^^lmao truth.
---
Just pour some gasoline on them and it’ll be fine.
---
Fuck dude, yeah, definitely don’t deserve a ban
---
It’s funny because deathgarden has a 71.67% player decline since launch of the new game lul.
---
Your flair
---
Omg
---
Kiss me already
---
Bro it's the only measurement of skill we have on PC at least... even people cheesing up with nurse grinds learn about the games techniques and how to read the survivors play.
---
Ranks matter you dont gotta like it but it does.
---
Well if he is a virgin, he won't be for long! Not if I can help it at least ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Nu you
---
He was nice though
---
About C I believe
---
Sounds like someone’s salty about fake pallets
---
Rusted shackles for real spoopy effect.
---
This sub can be really fun sometimes. Last time someone made this post, they also had the gonads to say that survivors did not have the same privilege. Lol. Not saying you’re saying that OP, but this sub cracks me up with the survivor rulebook while simultaneously the, admittedly smaller, killer rulebook is A-Okay.
---
Can you even report a friend request lol
---
Just get the base game for now :)
---
You gotta do what you gotta do
---
For the upteenth millionth time. Its the intent. Not the action.
---
"Flipping a person off is just you holding up one finger, what are you getting upset over?"

Good for you, glad you can enjoy the game despite the dickholes, but you pretending like its such a hard concept to grasp is just plain stupid.

---
But why?
---
I want servers first. To many killers running around with 2 potatos for internet.
---
And cutest
---
Also prettiest
---
Not a problem cause he's not the one who will be the stick ramming into the hole
---
You definitely can get to any gen in time, doesn't mean you're using time effectively
---
😳
---
What does the special edition do?
---
Oh really? I never really noticed, I've had only like 4 matches against him as a survivor and I usually manage to evade gaining madness pretty well
---
What tier is it at? At tier 1, you have to break four pallets. At tier 2, it’s reduced to 3. At tier 3, you only have to break two pallets.
---
I thought it was implied that the hag was raped though?
---
The only add-on I would suggest is the Charity Case cosmetic bundle on PS4 because I personally like the cosmetics but I wouldnt get any killer or survivor DLC just yet until you play the main characters first
---
Soooo 2 names.. cool
---
An avocado; thannnnkkkss 👍🙃
---
I to like legion.
---
I have perk plans and ideas that may or may not work at rank 10. Wish he was better but I am determined to find success without running Ruin.
---
Ranks don't mean anything. Every game is a 50/50 on which type of survivors you get. If you're gonna play this game you have to accept that sometimes you're the bird, and other times you're the unfortunate soul that gets shit on.
---
I always played Freddy because he was my favorite slasher.
---
Right now with the right perks he is pretty strong as well.( I run a straight gen stopping build with thrilling tremors, pop goes the weasel, discordance and whatever i feel like at the moment) Most of his base perks are garbage, Blood Warden can be pretty cool when you get it to work though.
---
Quentin comes with pretty "eh" perks. Pharmacy is probably the best out of them.
---
*Just a little bit*
---
I love this. I helped someone learn to play recently, coincidentally while playing Wraith.
---
The higher ranked players are much better than me
---
I mean I evade madness pretty well too xD
---
At Tier 1 Madness there's a 33% chance of a skillcheck in a random part of the screen.
---
At Tier 2 it increases to 66% and the hallucinations start.
---
At Tier 3 the only skill checks you can get is when you're Snapping Out Of It, and I'm pretty sure it's 100%
---
~~also you cant just go from a horny thread to here without me noticing ghostface boi~~
---
Right?! Lol everyone gets so upset.
---
Tip 1 to many fake pallates?
---
Sounds good!! :D
---
They’re from the movie Split
---
It says it comes with 
---
“Killer: The Hag
---
Killer: The Doctor
---
Survivor: Ace Visconti
---
Survivor: Feng Min
---
Killer Outfits
---
Survivor Outfits
---
Map: Léry’s Memorial Institute
---
Map: Backwater Swamp”
---
That just sounds like the normal version of the game to me and they slapped the “Special Addition” title on it to make people buy it. Someone can correct me if I’m wrong because it’s been years since I originally purchased. But doesn’t the game just come with all of that anyway?
---
Honestly I thought I was the only damn person with this mentality
---
How did I forget that? Have you seen this post? https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cikue4/reminder_that_the_pig_has_a_fully_modeled/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Well you added remember me that don't effect gen speed.
---
Yeah he looks off like he bought a knockoff Michael Myers costume
---
I might get back to you on that
---
Well as a rank 11 Bubba main I think that facecamping is not a very effective strategy for points.
---
At least wait for the stun to finish and throw it down to add the second stun. It is still a HUGE waste though, but if you can't resist...
---
Then why don't you do it then?
---
Love it when you down someone with red kool aid and she followed up with her angry ritualistic language.
---
Doesn't matter what platform you're on. Happens to everyone.
---
Its just a joke bro lol
---
Of flesh and mud + madness spark are free on ps4 since the game is more expensive there.
---
All the swf are unfun to play
---
3 or 2 times realistically when you kill survivors who can still be stalked.
---
Pig = upvote hahaha
---
I hadn't but thank you xD
---
She *kinda* looks like Amanda in Saw 2 I guess
---
Rank 19 Bubba main here. I am also here to explain why you're wrong.
---
Is the purpose to follow with mori?
---
Makes sense. I’m a PS4 player so I’ve never played without those and didn’t even recognize other versions of the game come without them.
---
i mean... nea was like that on her movie
---
And thats what I did. Your point?
---
Again there are definitely balance changes that would have to be made but what pisses me off is that they don't even seem to want to try.
---
I am rank 1 with both killer and survivor and if you had done that move at this rank I would have heavily insulted you.
---
Ok. I still will. It’s disrespectful af
---

---
lmao I was hoping so, you can just never tell with texts.
---
They lessened it they didnt remove it...
---
It used to be 36 meter flapping, and 24 meter stretch audible...
---
Even now it's still to much he needs to be perfectly silent you should never be able to here him except the grass he walks through and that is a standard 10 meter range for survivors and killer alike.
---
The vast majority of people who play the game that I speak to seem to really think that we need to stop getting new chapters and focus on updating old characters that never see play.
---
I think they could probably add new Survivors every now and again since Survivors don't take nearly as much work as Killers, but I'd much rather they rework old broken Killers than add new ones.
---
Perhaps we could get a Pig buff/rework along with Lawrence Gordon as a Killer? Or since Freddy got reworked recently we could maybe get Nancy along with another Killer rework? ~~I mean Quentin needs his perks reworked too and he could use a remodel to be fair.~~ It's wishful thinking I know but one can dream.
---
How many times has this been posted?
---
it's my time.  in my world my time is precious, yall are just along for the ride.  so sorry not sorry, will d/c.
---
Would pyramid head be as slow as he was or would he be faster?
---
Te white noise was completely removed, but the leather sound continues.
---
Agreed. Like they can take what they have now, try a “beta” phase and tweak things. But I don’t think there would be more than a drastic change other than power/perk interactions with other killers and generator # or repair rate. The events are fun but they aren’t enough. It’s been years and we have one game mode. Every other multiplayer game I know has several modes. Some games even have dozens of characters too. I love DBD but I wish they would add more than characters and a map. Take what they have and see what else they can do.
---
Especially with the bp buff &lt;3
---
I just posted and deleted it cause of the crop job. Unless you’re talking about it being posted other times.
---
Honestly I think that Overcharge and Pop Goes should be baseline. (IE kicking a gen removes ~10% of the progress, and touching it will bring up an [easy] Overcharge skill check that you'd have to hit or else alert the Killer.)
---
Big hands=big cock
---
We must petition to have it as a head cosmetic
---
People have suggested that gens take gas countless times. I'd personally love if they made items (namely toolboxes) not last as long but have them be way more effective, and have a lot more chests spawn around the map. So you could either do gens about 10% slower than they currently are or go find a chest to get a toolbox and do them at their current speed (brown toolbox) or faster.
---
DCed by flashlight?
---
Yes you’re a horrible person im reporting you right now
---
Idgaf about the downvotes, I mostly lurk and it's pretty easy to see which side gets rustled up real quick-like.  The funny thing is I'm also dealing with the bullshit, I just consider them games to even up gen-rushing or troll games. 
---
If I'm going to be an asshole survivor, it's unsurprising to me that killers are going to use perks to stop me.  Waah?
---
The whisper is gone but the leather flaps passively and it makes a louder noise when moving via crouch, stand, lean etc... and he stalks too slow and loses his progress too easily for someone so loud...
---
He needs a buff in his stealth  and in his stalk progression along the lines of what i recommended
---
a piece of my soul died
---
Naw, man. As long as you don't tunnel or camp, you're good. Have fun
---
Tremors is definitely not a standalone perk. It pairs beautifully with pop though.
---
Yea, he is. He’s really fun once you get the hang of him.
---
F
---
It really depends on the rest of your build and who you're playing. It's brilliant on Trapper, for instance,  but meaningless on Billy.
---
Love the title
---
All I can say is REUHUHHHUHUUUHUHHUHHHUH
---
I want them to fix his hands that are not in proportion
---
I like the white one better. The mask is white anyway
---
Meg looks just like her
---
I’d rather see sexy Myers reposted a thousand times than literally any of the Salt/Rant posts so I’m down with this ❤️
---
The base characters are the best for beginners.
---
Claudette and Meg are best for their perks.
---
Trapper and Hillbilly are the fastest to learn, with Hillbilly being a top tier killer.
---
I'm a firm believer that one should survive for the sequel if you are using a licensed killer but that's just me lol
---
Seems very plausible, although I think the hook ability might be a bit too much, I get it the entity runs the show and all but in the end he wants to have fun too, that's the only reason he created this world. It'd probably be better if the ability was to place a survivor on one of the end game collapse spikes, but only once per survivor, and there is no struggle phase so it's a quicker sacrifice in the end, but when the spike has a person on it, they can see the aura of the spike itself and the survivor for a bigger noticable aura. Blindness would be a valuable effect with this killer.
---
Or when her aura reveals and you're the obsession
---
No, the ad would say what model the processor actually is, and the graphics is integrated into the processor, this is an older laptop, definitely not a gaming laptop. Look for something that specs out an actual video card like nvidia 1050. ATI and Nvdia are the two names you should be looking for. Shame in the seller for trying to swindle someone.
---
Some people just can’t loose with some class / dignity whatever you want to call it.
---
did absolutely nothing. this bug is active since ghostface came out, all they did since then is correct the error message text. but no streamer or youtuber are having this problem

Plague's just like "nope nope nopety nope"

---
When a totem is cleansed the perk weakens rather then turns off.
---
Not all generator skill checks are effected by ruin.
---
Huntress lulaby and devour hope cannot have more then 3 tokens.
---
NOED has a 25% chance of activating on a hit opposed to 100%.
---
Haunted grounds unchanged.
---
Why ?
---
Lmao I can see the messages storming in already
---
It does feel like this!
---
But then you're excluding 90% of the people on this sub
---
"something original"
---
-reposts dead stolen memes not dbd related
---
I think they're trying to get at ranks don't necessarily correlate with skill, but moreso play time. If you play pretty consistently and are decent you can get to rank 1 pretty easily, but it's likely you aren't the best of the best.
---
how are they not dbd related
---
Or being chased by Myers/Ghostface
---
Yeah, it's really not fun. But I find it easier to just take the L and move on to the next game and forget about how much you just got trashed
---
Congrats! All that grinding paid off!
---
I made it to rank 7 and felt so happy! Then realized it means I keep going against red rank survivors and turns out it's pretty stressful ...
---
Heres a start. Her red stain resets when she's real phasing
---
I originally had it to where he could teleport, a-la Freddy, to illusion generators when they vanished but maybe that’s too OP?
---
I absolutely love it! The only thing wrong though is the power should maybe be a perk instead only because it doesnt have a trigger effect like Doctor Shocks, Reverse Bear Traps, etc etc. 
---
Ability idea: maybe make a generator disappear for like 5 seconds or something. He can kick the generator or Make it disappear.
---
Its still a bit too strong youre on the right track just maybe tweak the numbers a bit.
---
No that'd actually be a really good idea
---
Been working on a concept, and I figured I might as well get the idea out there despite my nervousness. I'm not entirely sure how to make icons like I've seen for other killer concepts, but if I can figure it out I'll probably re-upload.
---
:)
---
But will it help in the chase?
---
Well, should someone who doesn't understand completely the game have a opinion on balance? On the aspect fun everyone should have his opinion listened.
---
Might do that one :)
---
Disconnect Before Daylight: Horror Multiplayer Survival
---
I agree.  And honestly, if you've got a toxic survivor they're kinda asking to be camped.
---
Im going to preface this with the fact that I don't get triggered by BM either. But I do get why a lot of people do. Everyone has different reactions to things. Amazing right? Just because you don't *get* it, doesn't invalidate those people's feelings. You're not special. And your opinion isn't unpopular outside of this subreddit. Other people just didn't decide to make a self congratulatory post about it. Good for you, bruv. Have a cup of Yorkshire tea, you've earned it.
---
Definitely not. If you want to do any kind of gaming on a laptop - you're definitely gonna need something with a dedicated graphics card at least.
---
the worst thing about this is that people argue the 'averages of the ranks equating to yours'
---
like it doesnt matter a rank 12, under ANY circumstance should not queue with a rank 4
---
Theres a reason people refer to the game as dead by disconnect
---
People say Trapper is a trash killer and I honestly do so well with him. Don't listen to the haters, play the killer that jives with you.
---
just run iron will... it’s not hard
---
I mean, I don't care but if you annoy me i'm going to tunnel you. Generally i'm not annoyed by that stuff though.
---
Probably used an insta heal at some point either that or 2 people had the same outfit and you went for a different one
---
What if I am non-toxic solo surv? :/
---
No one gives a shit
---
no one cares
---
Fair and balanced ^_^
---
Next level Dc'ing:uninstalling the game
---
Too OP doesnt work.
---
Why dont you play against Ranks 1's? are you even able to hand;e the rank you cheesed yourself up to?
---
you're just deeply out of touch with the reality of Nurse.  it's obvious.
---
I'm not playing because I feel like I deserve to win every time.  Sometimes I'm gonna lose, and I get that.  
---
But if I'm not having fun due to the way someone is playing, I'm done.  I'm not about to waste my time playing with people who are trying their best to troll me.
---
I'm relatively new to the game (and online gaming in general) and at first I thought people crouching at the exit gates without leaving was just a means to avoid calling the AFK crows in case whoever was still left in the match needed saving. I even did it myself every chance I got, not realizing what I was actually doing until much later. I'm glad to say I don't do it anymore, though!

Appearance: A ghoulish figure with pale, sickly skin, and a grin ripped open with exposed sharp teeth. His top hat obscures his wild reddish hair. His eyes are small and glow a dim white/red (with the color intensifying in Fury mode). He wears 19th century British aristocratic attire: a gnarled trench-coat with a vest and shirt beneath, ripped trousers leaving him exposed below the calf, and bloodied bandages wrapped around both arms.

---
A fiendish killer who stalks the night using his power, Prowling Grounds, to separate his victims. Survivors who work cooperatively only deepen his fury as well as his strength. Survivors who work alone must contend with his manipulations.
---
His personal perks, Dead in the Water, Lambs to the Slaughter, and Surgical Precision emphasize singling out weakened survivors and disincentivizing cooperative play. 
---
Difficulty Rating: Intermediate

And she’ll be the one given the hatch. :) what fun
---
Spirit is the only one I'm not sure about. She was a college student, probably had a romantic experiences.
---
I got a rank 2 once
---
Hey. If all survivors, suicide by killing themselves, with the locker hatchets, smashing in their head, then the Entity won't get any pleasure out of it. Then the entity will eventually die.
---
Damn I'm a genius.
---
Lambs to Slaughter needs a major nerf
---
I went against a freddy who i looped so well he didnt land a hit, he got 1 kill and 3 of us escape. He messages me an HOUR later with "Youre straight trash".
---
Your girl?? She’s my girl!!
---
I'm telling you Dead by daylight loves the hag,this and the fact that at level 10 I got ruin 3 and devour hope 3
---
That looks horrible
---
I've watched a lot of streamers and youtubers so I know a bit about the game and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be a killer main but I'll obviously play survivors too to see how I like them
---
Damn I wish I got red ranks like that
---
Fucking sameee
---
thanks!
---
I've only been playing for 2 months but I'm decent! I don't remember my gamertag but I can add you if you could message me yours :)
---
Then it's the things you say on stream, the quality of your stream, how watchable it is for the killers visiting.
---
I read "I did it" with 0 emotion and it made the ending even funnier.
---
2 min for hooks to respawn, idk how many hooks u can sabo from a toolbox also if they r using the perk they can keep going, just slug them.
---
r/whoosh
---
No, got hit by noed on the way out.
---
What rank are you? It's very possible to juke a chainsaw swing. And at least you kill yourself, but it's what you sign up for going into a match, don't screw over your team. Bad etiquette and all that.

"If the game is going to be too hard then I'm allowed to just ragequit because I'm special"
---
I hope you're not allowed to vote.
---
Yeah, I'm very unsure of how to properly balance with actual numbers. I was going to perhaps change it so that the person saving off of the hook got the effect instead, but I thought it might be a bit much if paired with something like Make Your Choice. The length of time could definitely use some tuning! Thanks for your suggestion
---
Feels bad man
---
Yoooo can I use this? It's fantastic
---
P H A N T O M S A W S
---
I play solo most of the time, so yeah I am lol. Once again, you suggested kyf so why not play it yourself?
---
Yeah I hit them each time but dropped my survivor in the process. Maybe I’ll start to run iron grasp. I ended up getting everyone on the team but I feel like it was toxic. I’m still new to the game..
---
Brought an ebony mori so I vould do the mori a survivor ritual. Cue 4 mid mori d/c notifications.
---
Rank 10 and it'll be fine they wont survive anyway
---
Probably not lol, but I was feeling creative and wanted to try a hand at coming up with a concept for a killer I've seen talked about in the forums a bit.
---
99 your evil within power until you are right up on a survivor within range of hitting them
---
Soo you admit is dead meme reposts
---
Great job
---
I always look to see how good the killer is if he's bad I assume noed and do the totems usually always right. I also like getting a few gens done before I start really looking but if I see one I do it
---
Clearly not what I was saying. I didn't say you should DC any time you stub your toe, but when people run the incredibly unfun stuff like 5 blink ebony nurse or hostage doc what is the point of playing the game out? I play the game to have fun, and if people are being cocks I am not obligated to wait in the game.
---
Run tampered timer and jigsaws sketch or crate of gears and just play around making people waste time searching boxes.
---
I 100% agree but the reality is on games like this there's gonna be those type of people pretty regularly. Unless there's some way to punish them the best you can do is try not to give them the satisfaction of getting to you.
---
i use the mobile app to message
---
Bro I literally said it’s not lag.
---
let me out. 
---
let me OOOUUUUUUUTT
---
True. If someone unhooks in front of me I'll hunt down and camp the unhooker. I play way more survivor than killer and its so annoying when people do this. But sometimes the killer just wants to tunnel.
---
Toxicity doesn’t exist if they don’t say anything rude at postgame lobby(that’s what survivors usually say) yesterday I had a game with 3 flashlights, I adapted my perk (billy perk that makes u impossible to blind) and slugged those bitches, al died at the same time, adapt and prevail, that’s the best advice I can give u.
---
Yeah obviously you don't want to walk straight to it at the start of the game.  Exception is maybe Freddy if it spawns next to a gen - you can drop a snare on it to gen teleport to it and actually defend it.
---
Uhh I think you're the one taking my opinion personally and extrapolating on what I'm saying. Of course people can have whatever reaction they want and some people are more sensitive to dickhead behavior online (I don't mean sensitive as an insult) for a variety of reasons. I'm not being self congratulatory at all it's not that serious one way or another.
---
I actually hit great skillchecks more easily while under the effect of unnerving presence
---
if someone uses autism in their name they’re ~~probably~~ definitely a shitty person 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
what annoys me is they fix bugs that is not hurtful in anyway like the yellow envelope working for everyone that has been in the game for years yet they fixed it a little bit ago
---
That's because most of us were 16 when that game was out and we grew up after a decade, I guess not everyone does though lol
---
I'd honestly put it in "very effective" tier.  Against good survivors it often outperforms Ruin (unless you actually get a good Ruin spawn, but how often does that even happen?).  Even on killers without good mobility skills it's still really damn good.
---
Wow, there’s a lot to unpack here, I don’t know where to begin. If you’re committing minutes upon minutes to one single survivor without getting them down you can’t complain about ‘Le tOxIc GenrUsH!!!!’. If you haven’t injured them after 30 seconds of chasing, you need to give it up and pressure gens. You weren’t gen rushed lmao. 
---
&gt;borrowed time
---
I love how the new circlejerk is that borrowed time is somehow OP. In what parallel universe is a perk that only activates if the killer camps overpowered? 
---
&gt;Killers should be able to tell if they are facing a SFW team
---
Lol, imagine being that fragile. If killers can see sfw lobbies, survs should be able to see what killer is being selected and with what add ons then. Of course they shouldn’t, you should embarrassed you just said that. 
---
&gt;Idc if you’re an entitled survivor main
---
Jesus Christ I can’t believe you’re not even 1% self aware. Imagine making your post and then accusing other people of being entitled lmfao. Maybe, just maybe, the team you played where just better than you. You’re genuinely wanting the third best killer in the game to be buffed because you lost a game. Grow up for fuck sake.
---
Oh ok you just want to be a contrarian. Have a good night dude :)
---
Yeah michael looks like a PS2 model
---
in order for the pip system to work you need both the survivors and killer to have a good game. not always the case.
---
Why the attitude?
---
I think the equivalent of a mori list for survivors would be a “leave behind” list.
---
I love all the camping tunneling killers who be like, gee why’d they DC. Learn how to actually play the game. Rather DC and try again then get camped and tunneled.
---
It's not a hard concept to grasp. I also wouldnt get mad if some random teenager flipped me off because I'd just assume they're a lame edgelord just like survivors who do "maliciously" teabag. If youd get bothered by that then cool you're entitled to your feelings as well
---
Youre right, Spirit shouldnt be able to hear survivors while phasing and Nurse should have to wait 10 seconds after a blink before she can hit you. 
---
Seriously though, if youre going against a Nurse who is good enough to be landing all of her blinks then she deserves to get kills. Same with Spirit. 
---
Iron Will, Spine Chill and Distortion can help you with both of these killers. 
---
If youre in Red Ranks then youre going to be going against good players, and if thats proving too difficult for you then you belong at a lower rank with killers who arent as good
---
Magic wand is actually broken.. Survivors without pallets for that long is a guaranteed down unless the killer is complete ass.
---
I like the entire concept of the killer though, albeit he essentially has no power once the illusion gens are gone. He’ll need to have a secondary ability that can help him in the chase or else he’ll be a lower tier killer.
---
The fact that survivors will often stop working on gens to look for it means most survivors think otherwise.  I hate it when Ruin gets blown up 20 seconds into a game but that doesn't mean it happens every game or isn't still REALLY GOOD even if it only lasts 2 minutes.
---
I mean you could, and nobody could stop you. But perhaps toxic behaviour breeds toxic behaviour? And purposely playing a video game to piss off another person on the other end a couple hundred miles away sounds like a pretty miserable way to live imo 🤷‍♂️
---
Freddy is kind of a gardener already
---
I didn’t even know that existed. I’ll need to get that for next time I’m on PS4
---
Is there any perks you would recommend? I play spirit.
---
Your skill doesn't matter against a god tier nurse. She takes all the hours that you dedicated playing this game and throw them in the garbage. 
---
A chase against a spirit is a coin flip; it is a guessing game.
---
So you can't actually "git gud". You can hope that they make mistakes.
---
Tinkerer only activates at 85%, which might seem like a lot, but honestly I've used it on a lot of Killers *especially* Nurse and it doesn't really do much. It's mostly used for the no TR effect
---
I’m pretty sure he’s on PS4 since he’s pressing x to struggle
---
I love Head on and use it a lot of time \^\_\^
---
What I think of people who post pics of them making it to Rank 1.
---
Most actually good players just play between ranks 10 and 5 nowadays anyways since you don't go up against tryhards.
---
I couldn’t see that.  But it must be lagging. Maybe the killer quit before you were able to get out.
---
Tbh, I don't understand why BHVR haven't made survivor points a team effort kinda thing. The whole scoring system is fcked. Like honestly...survivors are supposed to be 1/4th the power of the killer, are "supposed" to work as a team....yet get separate points? What?
---
Freddy can teleport to the gen
---
I was getting chased the WHOLE game!   Uggggh!
---
Even after buffs a lot of people were putting her in mid-tier, which always made me crazy, I always knew she's second best.   
---
Just watch Tyde Time's tier list(he puts Hag in low tier, so it can;t be good)
---
Nothing like seeing this picture on the sub twice a week.
---
Hey hey some Back To The Future Meme’s! Keep them coming!
---
No, it's morally reprehensible. :)
---
I dont think so since it didnt disconnect for us and the timer kept running. Im in ps4 and trying to level up bill for borrowed so those 5000 bp couldve been usefull
---
No, you’re playing the game and completing the objective of Killer

"WHERE'S YOUR ENTITY NOW, PLAGUE?!"
---
Since Miss Piggy can freely run about the Trial area’s, I want a Kermit De Frog Outfit! 🐸
---
Because you can climb ranks super easily doing relatively nothing skillful and playing against killers/survivors that aren't good either.
---
Someone could be a rank 15 survivor and a rank one killer funneling blood points so their Claudette has sick perks, rank just doesn't matter.
---
I could do nothing but spam generators and hide, never learning to loop and still get rank 6+ as a survivor. There's a skill difference between me doing that and a rank 6+ that spends all day looping killers.
---
Hell when I first started playing I hit rank 8 killer in a few days just camping and tunneling with Insidious cannibal, that's straight braindead.
---
Would be Dope!
---
 😔 I miss my extra 30 seconds 😔
---
Ohh I really like this change I think it would be really fun to play as and against because it would make you think more when playing against a trapper
---
listen man believe whatever you wanna believe I honestly don’t care lol I was just pointing out that people are talking about two very different versions of a character
---
Yep it was laggy, though it was a strange kind of lag. I couldnt heal myself (it didnt give me the option), but everything else (repair gen, move around, etc) i could do it just fine
---
That’s pretty sad. Like why be like that..
---
For Casey, her perk could be "Pure". According to the movie, since she has undergone hardship, the beast wouldn't attack her. Translated into gameplay, this could prevent the killer from injuring the survivor 10/15/25 seconds after being unhooked. Might be a little broken. Overall, pretty cool idea but I dont expect it to ever happen due to copyright agreements and shiz
---
It’s fun but too many bugs that can make you not want to play anymore. Dedicated servers are coming so hitbox problems and disconnects won’t be too much of a problem anymore. It’s one of those games where everyone complains that something is always unbalanced between both sides.
