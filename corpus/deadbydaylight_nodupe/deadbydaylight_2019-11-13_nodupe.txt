Spirit should be altered because she's so powerful that the game stops being fun (for both killer and survivor - I'm a killer main, and spirit often feels like a brainless task for me). She takes away the whole mindgaming loop aspect of the game, which is a large chunk of the moment-to-moment gameplay.
---

---
I don't feel this is the case for billy. Yes, billy is strong, but it still makes for very fun games where everyone has to play their best. (Not everyone is Zubat, you know.) This is what should inform balance discussions instead of "this thing looks more powerful than everything else, therefore it should be fixed".
---
He's mad at you for wanting to play the game as it was intended. We sentence you to the basement lockers for all eternity Wraith!
---
I bet his dad works at behavioral, and he knows the next killer is actually Doctor Robotnik and the new Survivord are Sonic and Tails.
---
Never said you couldn’t; just don’t complain about the matchmaking being unbalanced when you’re using the most unbalanced offering ever made. Not to mention, your post is breaking the rules.
---
Welcome! I play rank 9-6 killer about 80% of the time. Especially since you're just starting out, focus on developing strong overall skills rather than relying on perks. Get good at mindgaming, going around loops more efficiently than survivors, etc.. But, the biggest thing to remember when playing killer is to treat the gens as objectives, as much or more so than the survivors. Don't get locked into a chase you won't win in the first minute while the other three survivors rush you.
---
DBD tends to be all-or-nothing pretty frequently, as you describe - 2 kills/2 escapes is about the rarest outcome, I've found.
---
Some people just like to watch the world burn
---
I like idea of terror but i hate part you get slowed . If there was that part survivor would gain classes like gen rusher and killer looper but when looper gets slower its end to him so that dont make sense
---
I watch the shit out of Orz lmao I love him. I dont have STBFL, or PWYF, or Discord, Whispers is only t1, no BBQ, no ruin, no haunting, no corrupt. Im just at a loss at what I'm supposed to do when I don't have any of the good perks.
---
20+ minutes? lol..uhh yeah, that's never happening..like, no matter what perks i use..perhaps you meant 10+ mins
---
Pop definitely does something but
---
Sloppy doesn't stall anything because they just decide to not heal(you may think it's good because they are oneshot, but they will see you and run to a pallet or a stupid window) and dying light is kind of a joke tho..idk, i have a complete different experience than you even tho, the rank is the same
---
The problem is not the spawns, it is the fact that the majority of the maps have such stupid loops where you can't do anything about it if the survivors are good, they will predict any sort of mindgame..and compared to last year..jesus christ, survivor got good and it's finally showing how unbalanced and quick the games can be.
---
whats this whole thing about items being taken from maps? what did i miss?
---
Bruh- 
---
I’d love that-
---
You lose all of your current perks, offerings, items, and add-ons. It's a completely clean start. Any unlocked teachables will stay unlocked.

He hasn’t streamed for months now and I’ve been using my twitch prime subs to him ever month while his off
---
Ok now THIS changes everything
---
It's great! Very spooky
---
Has he died?! Fr.
---
I was going to put down Cannibal but then remembered he actually has different faces.
---
Wait, no terror radius in tier 1 now? I was using M&amp;A for no reason then
---
Also of those two, STBFL is easier for me rather than PWYF as A) PWYF requires you to find and lose your obsession multiple times and B) you lose each of only 4 tokens every time you attack, whether you hit or miss. So prolly save that for later.
---
It'll take time to build up your perks from the Shrine and otherwise, until then just have fun experimenting with some synergy in perks. I like doing infectious fright with STBFL hex 3rd seal or knockout and maybe sloppy butcher or bloodhound if you have a hard time tracking, or whispers if you feel confident about tracking but struggle to make the initial find.
---
I don't think that's something they'd do, it kinda dooms the survivors that are still in the match.
---
&gt;This. Killer queues on PC are unsustainable especially for ranks higher than 4 and ranks lower than 16. 
---
??
---
I've been getting instant queues as rank 1 killer on East coast ever since they changed SWF matchmaking.

Yes but you don't buy the faces. You earn them.

I sexually identify as an unoriginal joke. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of surfing reddit dropping shitposts and derailing actual conversation. People say to me that this has been really going on for far too long and and it trivialises gender identity but I don’t care, I'm a massive asshole. I’m having a plastic surgeon install a mountain dew dispenser, a catheter and and a poop shoot on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Logical Gamer” and respect my right to freeze peach. If you can’t accept me you’re a god damn tumblirina sjw cultural marxist liberal and you triggered lol?. Thank you for being so understanding.

This hasn't been the case for a long time. There's a max turn rate that you can't do anything about with keybinds (affected by addons), you could at one point cheat it by inputting keyboard turn along with mouse turning, but it was fixed long ago.
---
Yeah now he no longer looks like either Jim Carrey's Grinch from the live action film or that kid in Jumanji when he got turned into a partial monkey.
---
What I am saying is the killers lose by default no matter how well they do, as long as the survivors did really well. And OP means overpowered, how are you overpowered if you are 100% going to lose as long as your opponent did really good?
---
my personal favourite is ghostface, it gives me a good chuckle.

God dammit I just bought Quentin for pharmacy

At least Hag can use her traps in chases

Here is the thing, you might not agree with the system devs came up with but you can't say **it doesn't work**. Your screenshot just proves that the matchmaking **it is perfectly working as intended by the devs**.

#This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
Yeah, I get about 12k-15k most matches, sometimes around 18k-20k, but I’m generally much less than those who didn’t do any gens, so that was confusing. I had a game the other day where I got 4 gens, got 2-3 saves, escaped, but somehow had less points than someone who didn’t escape, someone who kept getting immediately caught. 
---
But it sounds like I’m being “punished” because I’ve gotten really good at completely avoiding the killer? Your description of boldness and survival I thought was kinda the point to avoid.
---
4.5 mil for P3, but it's 6 mil if you want P3 50, which you would since you need to keep rerolling perks four times.
---
I wood love it if they brought these back
---
Then maybe lower your expectations a bit. 
---
Its like asking people to play by your made up rules. If the Survivor game sucks - play Killer. And vice versa. Still not having fun? Play something that IS fun to you on your limited schedule.
---
Theres maybe not as much but still people who are satisfied with this game for the most part. Devs scheduling of things then not living up to it sucks but otherwise....
---
Nancies feel like the new Lauries.

Then he should set his stuff to private. Takes 2 seconds

no matter what you identify as i still luhv you unoriginal joke. Or 'logical gamer" whichever you prefer.

Oh shit!! I had this guy before! He said the same thing to me like a week ago when I didn't let him get hatch

Haha I know this guy he said the same thing to me verbatim like 2 months ago when I was playing the doctor, and spreading out my hooks to get max bp
---
perhaps i should have said "potentially" predictable, based on survivor skill level. my bad.

Did the devs say anything on the topic of basic character perks in the Shrine?

I feel like it is really stupid that they constantly appear there. It is almost never worth it to buy them and they are just wasting space.

When u have a jake tag, but forget he even exists
---
On release legion had 0 counterplay. If he saw you, you were dead he wasn't as strong as the nurse but he 100% the second strongest (and at least the nurse has a bit of counterplay).
---
I play bill and i am annoyed i cant make him: shirtless, a pizza delivery boy or a gamer
---
...Which is how it's supposed to work. If your opponent performs better than you, you lose. What your comment says is that killers should always be able to down survivors regardless of skill level, which is silly. 
---
And I didn't say all killers are OP, I said you want them to be OP.

I just wish it was a little more even honestly. I either get smashed in a 7 minute 5th gen or I've gotten 2/3 on second hook by the time they've done two gens. I'm getting better about not chasing as hard with playing huntress more. If I miss a second hatchet and at least get them injured I'll just break the gen and force them to mend sloppy. So far I've gotten about 12 4ks and only flat out lost a handful of games but each game I lose is one that by the time I even find someone there are already a gen and a half up.
---
I didn't hate the original design, but Sonic looking a million times better is basically universally agreed upon which is odd considering the internet NEVER agrees on anything
---
Schpanks!
---
Yea I'm guessing he sent that and both of our messages went through at the same time
---
&gt;God dammit I just bought Quentin for pharmacy. Every fucking time I swear to God
---
Leveling up a character for their teachables is always a better option than buying from Shrine.
---
&gt; Did the devs say anything on the topic of basic character perks in the Shrine?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I feel like it is really stupid that they constantly appear there. It is almost never worth it to buy them and they are just wasting space.
---
Yeah, I wish they changed Shrine to only contain DLC perks.
---
Yeah me too. I’d like to play on pc but there’s no way I’m starting from zero. And it’s not just the amount of time I’ve put into it; I’ve bought all the dlc characters except ash and I’m not trying to buy them all again.
---
Yea, he shouldnt have to let a kill go just because he didnt want toxicity
---
Because it’s blatantly stupid and wrong
---
Good thing legion is a god at ranking up though
---
Wtf how? Vommy Mommy is fun to play against.
---
I didn't see any others when I glanced through the recent posts. I checked first. Must have missed them I suppose
---
Can't decide between pig and wraith. Love them both.
---
There is some truth to this, the younger crowd are more likely to play on console due to the fact that a PS4 or Xbox is roughly $200-$400 while I've never seen a decent gaming PC/laptop for less than $900 (maybe less if it's a laptop and there's a sale).  And in my experience, tweens/teens are more likely to t-bag and camp and other such behaviors in online games because, well, maturity.
---
So spirit finally gets her revenge so she is not needed anymore. Guess the devs are actually deleting spirit lmao.
---
Rin... meet Ron.

Ronald, "The Samurai" Yamaoka.

Y'all remember your first time you heard the roar

You’re 100% right, and the people that downvoted me think I’m saying all console players are like this. Just shows you how little they think.

---
And that makes a difference... how? You should be playing with the volume cranked up as Spirit anyway.
---
All of my arguments are based on if both sides are equally skilled. I never said it should be that a noob killer can easily down good survivors. What I am saying is good killers should down equally good survivors relatively faster considering the other 3 survivors are doing gens while the killer is chasing and I present the math that if survivors do gens really efficiently, even 34sec per chase is far from good enough for the killer to win.
---
You got that right.
---
Getting hate after a 4K makes me thrive even more haha
---
&gt; The only other male survivor that was in the game when Bill was added was Ace
---
What about Dwight?
---
Even more reason to gen grab the non-Chills.
---
The assumption with the categories is with boldness and altruism, they sort of expect you to eventually get chased and get trapped whether that's pig's reverse bear trap, trapper's traps, etc...
---
There are players like me who enjoy running the killer, and we get given a lot more points than those who do gens. You can max boldness out in a 2-3 gen chase, which is useful as I like to run the killer early then gen jockey while others get chased.
---
If you do avoid the killer and successfully break chase and lose the killer, you're still given points, just not as much if you ran the killer well while in chase.
---
Survivors dont earn a lot of points anyway. Killer earns the most points in the time of a match, he also has 4 survivors he can individually attack, meaning he can find a weak link and use that weak link to bait in the better players. Allowing him to easily kill survivors and get points.
---
Also BBQ &amp; Chili is a really good killer perk that also doubles Bloodpoints, so it's always a must run unless your build demands more synergy.
---
While minimal, spirit still has some counter play, i honestly hate when viable characters get nerfed to shit because of survivors relentless complaining. Play spirit a bunch and learn how she works and learn how others juke you. I did this with nurse and it has helped me run nurses better than any other killer, before her nerf too.
---
I'vr just witnessed the biggest backpedal in recorded history
---
Is it tho
---
I don’t have any macros but the keys don’t seem to be stuck.
---
You clearly haven’t seen ranks 5-1 on console. (Xbox)
---
Honestly the solution is just controller based lobbies. If you use a controller (on PC/Xbox/PS4) you get queued with other controller users, and if your KB/M you get queued with KB/M.
---
Bruh moment
---
Ah okay, I see. Np then. I played a little before the legion rework but most of my experience at the 20 to 17 rank was getting tunneled off hook or face camped so I didn't really see the issue at the time, and I hadn't bought any killer DLC yet
---
Slowed at some times, sped up at others. I think the devs could find a way to balance it so it was fair.
---
Nah that’s just me being left out of the group
---
Nah, life sucks enough already.  The real take away should be that no one should act like jerks in general and we should all work on being better every single day, not "lower your expectations and get over it".  It's completely fair and valid to vent your frustration about anything in your life, especially to a group of people who also experience what you're talking about and understand, like op posting to this sub.
---
You are incorrect. King addon has all Carter's Notes effects of other addons: pallets mapwide, illusions aura reading in T2 and T3, etc. You need to shock ppl 5 times to apply all afflictions with King addon.
---
Restraint addon effect can be useful sometimes if survivors do not move, sitting on gen, hiding around gates/hatch, otherwise aura will stay for 7 seconds at the place where survivor was, by the time Doctor arrives survivor can be on other side of the map.
---
Smart idea that encourages the right things
---
There's a sword missing from the Yamoaka map, and DBD has posted a couple of things about it on twitter
---
Your recorded history must be a very short one. I didn’t change any of my replies, feel free to quote me.
---
It's a shit meme what can I say
---
So is fugitive chase worth it? It's the only one I don't have.
---
ty
---
Ahhh because she’s a spirit and can defy physics
---
It's one or the other it seems. You're either toxic as hell and the worst person on earth, or you're a completely awful player that sucks. Like there is no in between
---
Not really, it is a gimmick more than a useful perk
---
damn, didn't see that sorry. ill take down the post.
---
Why are you mad dude, your not to be the judge of anybody. Maybe if you learned to play against spirit then you would be better off.
---
6 remove her
---
It's not really confusing. The Entity rips people out of their place in their universe. We can all agree that Left 4 Dead and Nightmare and Halloween don't all occur in the same universe, therefore the entity rips people out of different universes. This means it would be easy for her to have ripped Vigo as a survivor as well as The Alchemist as a killer. Same with Rin the survivor and The Spirit the killer.
---
7 remove
---
I have another question, why is Furtive Chase even a perk?
---
Omg I knew there was something he reminded me of, he definitely looked like the kid in Jumanji.
---
Wait, we can't do that anymore??
---
At least it isn’t the Overwatch tutorial
---
Nah he's just fucking awful at uploading lmao
---
... Well that's terrifying.
---
Bro it's frustrating as fuck from both sides. Had one swf game on The Game where nobody could break him out all game. Couldn't even *start* to break him out.
---
Then towards the end I break him out *once* and guess where we were? Well I was on the middle stairs, and he was in the **corner bathrooms** by the basement.
---
Shits 100% broken.
---
Shit like this is really what this sub has come down to huh
---
Or, the entity is possibly his father, who kills those people until they do his bidding, think about it, when Evan didn't do what he was told, his father beat him, when trapper (evan) didnt do as the entity told, he was tortured, I know it's a bit farfetched buuut....
---
&gt;Check his video about fun in dead by daylight. He refers to spirit as an example of a well designed, strong killer. In the context of that video, the inference we should make is that her design inspires confidence in the dev team in making killers that are fun to play as and against. No stipulation was made about that fun being one sided. Not until the last couple months. 
---
We are talking about [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8006FDP4Iw8), right? All he says is that spirit is a strong killer and that she's his favourite.  Nowhere does he say that she's fun for both sides. Plus the video came out at the time when old Legion was around, which kinda overshadowed Spirit and Nurse in the general discussion due to him being way worse.
---
&gt;But I do know that this narrative about spirit needing to be nerfed beyond just prayer beads
---
Would u like to show me what the counterplay to spirit is in a kyf game? Something that isn't just randomly guessing and hoping to get lucky?
---
&gt;You mention OhTofu.
---
Yes, I've mentioned that his new video (along with Scott's) didn't start this. I am aware that there were less people back then who disliked her, as you can clearly see they've changed their minds about her as they got to know her more, that's kinda the thing that happens when you get more experienced with things.
---
She is one of the best killers in the game, easily same tier as billy, her entire kit revolves around killers being good enough to hit their hatchets consistently, she is too slow to chase and m1.  Good huntresses will win all these chases in seconds.
---
*FUGITIVE*
---
I agree, there are a lot of things both games should learn from each other, to be honest. Such as the instaheal spray, it is the only way to heal and it's also way overpowered. The stamina, that just needs to go, so does the screen darkening, it's not scary, just annoying. 
---
Customisable perks, DBD does that much better. 
---
A killable killer, that's a neat concept, but it takes some of the fear and power away from the killer, which is what makes it such an approachable role. To be an unkillable, unstoppable, relentless, bloodthirsty killing machine. 
---
So many other examples, though.
---
me: waits patiently for shirtless skin
---
It's good for some builds, but unless you have plans for it, its not worth buying.
---
&gt;So it’s pretty lame that the killer can just hold the game hostage by just not picking anyone up and just leaving people to bleed out.
---
FYI, this is not holding the game hostage since you'll bleedout in X minutes.
---
Hmm the hate between Spirit and Claudette... I can't tell which is worse.
---
For my social experiment, in that case,you would prefer not to say.. i assume.
---
You should put this on r/perfectlycutscreams
---
You’re being downvoted but no one as made a valid argument or reason as to why. Lol. Just shows how much of an asslicking community this is.
---
Well then shorten the fucking timer.  No one wants to wait that long it’s ridiculous
---
See that's the thing. They seem to be afraid or incapable of dismemberment/explicit gore. Aside from the hag and, to a lesser extent, clown, body parts usually don't come off or melt. The Demogorgon's would be the best in the game if it actually ripped the head off the Scoops Ahoy Steve it was eating.
---
the timer is you bleed out. if no one is picking you up then thats on your teammates not the killer. second of all slugging is okay cause there is a risk reward to it as the killer player and its the easiest way to create pressure when you down a survivor and know one of the teammates is around. the fact you think its unfair or total bullshit means you have a certain lack of understanding of the fundamental aspects of the game and are still trying to grasp how to be an effective survivor
---
ok do you think id care enough for you to come and tell me
---
Wat
---
Ill put apache but wish there were revisions to conform to all of us..:)
---
And that will suck balls too lol why to we have to pretend things that sucks dont suck?
---
Either a DLC pack based off of The Thing, where the killer can disguise as a survivor, but can't do certain tasks (or maybe a physical flaw, something noticeable) or The Ring, where there could be scattered wells or tvs that the killer can emerge from. Just cool ideas in my opinion ;3;
---
I know how the games works dude.  No one likes slugging.
---
Hey the terror of an uncertain job market is a legitimate horror movie theme.
---
I'm well aware of what a troll is.  Me calling out toxic time wasting players for doing something that legit ruins the survivor queue experience doesn't make me a troll.  I'm not going to mindlessly agree that lobby dodging is cool just because a few idiots say I'm a troll for not agreeing.  What you guys are doing is wrong.  You're just abusing the lobby system.  Devs show you survivors so you can counter their items not so you can refuse to play them.  This ruins the game.  You guys are part of the problem.
---
Fair enough. Appreciate ya
---
.... I'm playing survivor.
---
Only real issue with Fredbert imo is his snares having basically no limits to them, with the only counter being "just don't be asleep 4Head".  He can also just drop them in the middle of a chase and has no real penalties for doing so.
---
Yes, I am!
---
Alright, I’m a killer main and even that made me chuckle
---
Uhhhhhh, meow?
---
Ah, damn. That's all I can think off the top of my head, I hope you can find the solution! :)
---
T R O L L
---
In power concept i mean
---
I play a shit load of killer and I never slug.  It shouldn’t even be in the game.  When you down someone a timer should start for you to pick them up and hook them.  It’s just an excuse for killer to want a easy 4K at the end or to ruin the game at the beginning by just slugging.  It fucking stupid and everyone knows it.
---
dbd titter posted a gif about a sword on spirits map and now its gone. and the text is on the post is about spirits dad. basically he got stressed then killed spirit and she wantes revenge so bad the entity took her
---
it is supposed to look funny man why you like dis I KNOW he didnt see me or he wouldve smacked that ass
---
The first person camera helps me forget until I’m happy enough to be blinded by my merciless.
---
Pig would like to have a word with you
---
Oh got you. Like you are trolling me right now.  Well I'll leave you to troll other peoples I don't provide trolls the time of day anymore.  Good luck with that man.
---
Why do you have 2 posts?
---
ok survivor
---
If it makes you feel better even though he said in the video that that doesn't work people in the comments are still saying it.
---
Us dbd players are use to having patience. 4 minutes is nothing.
---
Plus lag switching is easier to do on PC, I think. Console to console I dont really mind. PC also runs better so less frame drops for them, but more for console. I would prefer if they honestly just fixed dedicated servers and make those perfect as possible before even thinking of crossplay.
---
Because I fell off
---
Devour Hope, Huntress Lullaby, Thrill of the Hunt, and who could forget No One Escapes Death if the gates are powered. 
---
I run into these far more often than Haunted Grounds.
---
There is no middle ground with Spirit though. She's too fragile to change. I also don't trust these devs to make any form of "tWeAk" to her. These devs have a poor track record. They WILL manhandle her, period.
---
Everyone screams for poorly thought out nerfs that signal their opinion should be discarded on sight but are, ironically, "tunnel" visioned on Spirit's power. Bad movement speed, bad lunge... she's super reliant on her power for map travel and to end chases. She might actually have old Legion movement speed... old Legion lunge too, before that was buffed.
---
Are you one of the dishonest debaters, currently trying to make me think a specific, idiotic way, who think "blue scratch marks" is a good idea too?
---
Also, against a good Billy and his massive saw hitbox, it won't be baited. lmao His weaknesses are vaults and walls. Which is what loopers love and ALWAYS default to. You hate Killers who don't have to respect these (Nurse, Spirit). Who force you to play a different way. Simple. You want to be able to loop every single Killer the ol'fashioned way because you're afraid of change. :) You know you have a bully simulator, and you want it to stay.
---
Rather smart of you to ignore how she's reliant on her power too. Because then you'd have to admit that she would need to be buffed if her power got nerfed! After all, "there is a middle ground" right? ;)
---
She isn't OP, there's perks and tactics you could use. But why try to learn how to beat a Killer when you can just throw your hands in the air, give up, and scream until you don't have to learn anymore? It's proven to work many times now. =D
---
I currently have an absolutely useless support ticket in because I will disconnect at best every 5 or 6 games. More common is every second or third game is a dc. DBD is the only game I have issues running. I have done literally every single troubleshooting thing there is and can not find the issue. i7-8800k, Gtx 1080, game is on a seagate ssd, and I have a 1.4gbs fiber connection and I am 45 miles from my ISP data center.
---
But she can't even go through vaults when phasing.
---
We wait enough in the lobbies, we don’t need to wait while we’re playing too.
---
You obviously tried to be done when you deleted the whole discussion showing how hypocritical and entitled you are.
---
Who’s fault is that, then?
---
Schpanks Ill keep an eye out for em. Now BHVR please give me a wraith buff :(
---
I play solo cause my friends either don't like the game, or get so spooped they can't play much. I run Spine Chill and Bond in all builds when not doing an achievement or memes. The knowledge of the two is weaker than the 5th perk that SWF get but it helps!
---
That honestly just makes it worse... People don't fact check things that do fit their narrative and ignore or irrationally hate on things that don't.
---
I play both sides but would consider myself more of a killer player. Once the gens are done anything goes.
---
I mean other than his bullshit fucking lunge I don’t have a lot of problems fighting new Freddy (that lunge needs to fucking go though)
---
I think the only issue they have with that is, some liscensed killers dont have music, (ie, Leatherface, Ghostface) and theyd need unique music for each killer. theyve done it for the new killers in the menu but its still the same dbd theme just varied.
---
&gt;"Taking the time to hear from us is awesome?" 
---
Are you serious?
---
Man, I know I’m an asshole to hypocritical, entitled crybabies.
---
The difference is I can stop being an asshole to those that don’t deserve it. You’ll always be a hypocritical, entitled crybaby.
---
Keep DCing whenever you start to lose. Definitely shows you’re not a crybaby.
---
Ghostface, but I really wanna get going with pig.
---
Lunge is actually the same size as everyone else’s it’s just the animation because his weapons so small. The only fix they could do would be to give him yaoi hands.
---
I play both (more survivor) but camping is camping and the only time it's allowed is on toxic survivors
---
Just how much have you played? lol
---
I'm Tier 21 and I wasted at least 35 hours since it went live.
---
I play both sides, I think it's ok to camp at end game, I just don't do it personally because I don't really care about ranking up.
---
When gates are 99 or open yeah because what are you gonna do? Just let them go free?
---
That’s not true. Spine Chill doesn’t mean the killer sees you. Just looking in your direction. 
---
If you run away every time it procs, you’ll never complete anything. 
---
Spine Chill is used so you can be more aware of your surroundings. Not a fail safe.
---
There's always gonna be plenty of suckers that tell BHVR exactly what they think BHVR would like to hear. Then there are people like me who will tell BHVR what they don't want to know.
---
This survey is as pointless as nipples on a breastplate and a complete and utter waste of time. It would be more productive to stare at the wall for five minutes.
---
Mano, a galera não deve ter entendido nada desse meme kkkkkkkkkkk
---
Some people just want salty messages too. Back when killed could literally facecamp but standing still and blocking the u hook prompt I had a guy donut to me and proceed to message me “mad your friends can’t save you?” 
---
His PS4 profile said you mad? Invite me to the party like a man instead of sending little messages. 
---
So my friends invited him and it gets heated.  It’s all for a YouTube vid with a crap ton of views.
---
People want to make people mad and people want to see people make people mad for some reason.
---
Hook camping? Well once the exit gates are powered I try to keep a closer eye on my hooked survivor then during the rest of the match, the other survivors are obviously coming to save them so I'd say it is a strategy, but dont be a dick and face camp unless the person hooked has been an asshole all game, then knock yourself out.
---
Thought she was flipping you off at first
---
one of my favourite builds on Michael, but never get the proper offerings to give the survivors a good scare :(
---
one time i got a lerys offering and I gleefully offered it to the entity, only to also have a coldwind offering he burned as well. You can probably guess which map loaded :^)
---
Oh yikes, a "lucky guess" person.
---
Don't go "uh no" with me. You straight up said "reliable counterplay", you MEAN a reliable method of beating her power.
---
"but she needs ***reliable*** **counter play** that isn't straight up guessing."
---
  
---
You do realize that Spirit only has so many possibly paths at vaults and you should be taking options that stop \*multiple\* Spirit options instead of standing right at the pallet and pretending this is a "two choice" guessing game, right?
---
It's because you can't change how you think that you lose against Spirit.
---
Oh really? "Freddy is a pretty good killer", huh? What do you think of his dream pallets? I see you didn't mention them... ;)
---
And most Survivors DO want easy wins. Their proposed Spirit nerfs prove this. As well as how the community has clearly already made up their mind about Spirit and won't listen to reason. As well as their unwillingness to listen to Spirit players and red rank Survivors who know how to beat Spirit already.
---
Because of scratch marks. You’re not supposed to just run away everytime it procs. That’s dumb. Lol

have you ever seen mortal Kombat fatalities?
---
You may be able to control it easier with keybind QE etc, but you don't actually turn any faster than using mouse only or mouse and keyboard. I use keyboard turn on billy aswell, I find it a lot easier, but they removed it giving any additional turning long ago.
---
Nea made it smell like fish in there
---
Yeah I agree, I’m trying to get better
---
Trying to read the title gave me brain cancer
---
Whelp, time to buy Pharmacy because the Q boy isn't on switch.
---
Slash slinging. Mash flinging. Sash singing.
---
i literally use one perk and i’m level 1 with ghost face and i 4k survs all the time he’s so fun
---
I brought pharmacy!
---
Yeah I don’t know why that dude is telling you that.
---
It is not a thing, you can control it easier with keybinds, but you get no additional turning for using 1 method over the other. Way back in the day you could turn superfast by using both mouse turning and a keybind turn, they removed this long ago.
---
I love DBD been playing for 2 years now, but what is this Alchemist stuff? Where did it come from? What is an Alchemist and why would it be stealing objects from different worlds?
---
Not funny
---
HELLO FELLOW JANE MAIN ✊
---
Replace the knife sounds with billy's weapon sounds and it would be alright
---
Thank you. I'm so damn sick of all these Spirits father posts. They are absolutely ridiculous. It's obvious the whole Katana thing is a red herring to make idiots think it's something to do with her or father.
---
Vedy nais !
---
The new tomes + last year's Hallowed Blight event shed some light on him.
---
Off topic but just yesterday I got a full 4 man DC with legion with surveillance, BBQ, discordance, and STBFL. They said I was lagswitching and (I quote) screen cheating
---
May as well secure the last kill
---
Hmm... I must’ve not been paying attention then. Lol
---
shit son
---
You keep ignoring the fact, that all other "trap" abilities have one HUGE difference between them and Freddy's traps. They deal damage directly or indirectly, but they deal damage. Getting in trapper's trap means you lost the chase and triggering hag's trap means you are either taking a hit or are forced to waste a pallet immediately and even that doesn't ensure you are bot getting hit. 
---
Freddy's traps do not end chases immediately or create a situation where you are taking a hit without any good chances to avoid it. All Freddy's traps actually do in chase it that they shut down a second loop. You cannot run around the same pallet on the same path against Freddy. You are forced to always choose a new path and build your strategy around this. If you are unable to do that, then the problem is not in Freddy.
---
I'm a killer main.    
---
Camping IS an end game strat and a good one.    
---
You're in a very strong position as killer when you have someone on a hook and the end game has started: Gates are open or 99th. Climbing ranks you'll find survivors get more and more altruistic. Use this against them. Do they want to unhook the survivor? Fine, but make sure it's a 1 for 1 trade. Don't let a survivor get to the hook before they're injured or else you might not get the down and they (all) escape. 
---
If you choose to chase after someone else after hooking a survivor, you either need an instadown or else they'll get m1'd, get the movement speed boost and Usain Bolt to nearest exit gate, getting out whilst the hooked survivor gets unhooked. Unless they're already injured, of course. Then by all means go after them if you think you can get them before they get to the exit gates. Don't fall for an injured survivor that's going for a strong loop. If there's still a pallet at the loop, be very wary as to where you want the survivor to end up. Usually it's best not to break the pallet, as it gives survivors time to run to the exit gates. Be smart about your movement. Bloodlust them down if necessary.   
---
It sucks for the survivor on the hook, but remember. You're playing killer, your objective is to stop gens getting repaired and kill survivors. When all gens are done, you can only kill survivors. Survivors WILL come for the unhook and WILL try to bait you into following them, don't fall for it. DON'T feel bad for survivors, they don't show you any mercy and neither should you.    
---
I'm not advocating for just plain (face)camping, but in the end game staying near the hook is a very strong tactic and it's actually bad to leave the hook without knowing that you'll down another survivor.
---
Cool story bro.
---
It's kind of amazing you missed it. Lol
---
I never do, I absolutely love that park with him.
---
Feedback is something they used to pay people to get by testing the game.
---
Here's some tips, and they're free. Congrats! 
---
* The rewards suck (Charms?! What am I? A child?) 
---
* and they take too long to get (and by that I mean the pus, 180ish hours for the same thing that would have taken 90 only with a huge chore list, and no fun new mechanic). 
---
* YOUR BIGGEST EVENT. HALLOWEEN. SUCKS. It doesn't have anything to do with the petals and they're being way cheaper than they were last year (less skins, and you have to really work for a lot longer, a lot harder, and spreading out your time way more, to get them). 
---
* The game is the same it was a bazillion hours ago, chasing down petals and lanterns was at least something different. A crappy chore list, that I can do one at a time, things that I've actually done a million time before (good thing I can't see my stats). Isn't really new or that fun.
---
* Don't be cheap, you're a niche game, and in cramming The Archives and your big event together you kinda blew it. I can get way better and way more rewards from something like Rocket League and surprisingly that never gets old.
---
Do...do... they not understand legions power?...
---
Exactly this, especially after a game where they steamrolled out the gens in 2 minutes. If I have no intel on where the other 3 survivors are why would I just allow the one I do know the position of to be saved? If it’s been a fun competitive games I’m more inclined to try and leave the hook find the others try and down them but when it’s been an extremely lopsided match I normally just want it to end. It is such a waste of time when survivors open the gates stand there for ever
---
I took spine chill off for one game just to mix it up, then got grabbed off a gen twice in a match by prayer beads spirit. Never again
---
Probably doesn't want to waste time getting looped by a blendette, and is just gonna bear trap the exit gate instead.
---
wow i didnt expect such an in depth reply, this was really useful thank you!
---
Counterpoint, who instadowns an injured person? 
---
Hill Billy using his chainsaw on an injured person is indeed quite niche lol
---
I depipped twice yesterday because I had two separate matches where I was the first one hooked and my teammates didn’t react at all. They just kept playing as if no one was hooked. I’m guessing it was a 3 person SWF both times and they just said screw him.
---
Then don't have such an expectation. All I'm seeing is you wanting to say gg very badly for some reason and the other person is clearly not in the mood for conversation. Don't push people.
---
I play both sides, and I say once the exit gates are powered, you’d have to be a fool not to guard the hook. There is little to no chance that you’ll catch a survivor so far out of position that you’ll be able to get an additional hook without guarding your currently hooked survivor. The only chance you have to snowball some kills is punish overly altruistic plays in the endgame
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
Not even the company who owns the largest game in the world can write good bots. What makes you think a far smaller Canadian company can?
---
I'm all ears is easily one of the most slept on perks in the game. I'm not saying its S tier meta level but more people should run it, you'll have a lot of fun.
---
So I'm trying to go for a Plunderer's Ace in the Hole build, how good is Pharmacy?
---
How is it toxic? It's a strat and if you want to use it, just use it. You shouldn't be concerned if something is toxic or not. Survivors do way worse things and they don't care. Survivor main talking. I don't do toxic stuff though.
---
Pig traps can kill you. There are a limited amount of them. Some add-ons remove them like Amanda's letter. They will blow your head up and permanently kill you if you don't get them off. And prevent you from leaving. They are a unique and new mechanic.
---
Doctors Madness prevents stealth. It's a counter to Urban immersion survivors hiding the whole match. It messes up generators and can create mind games with fake pallets. Same with Freddy. You can easily counter him by staying awake. There are plenty of methods to doing it. And you don't see nearly as many Freddy's as Legion. Freddy takes more brain power to play than Legion. Legion is the easiest killer to "learn"
---
On the other hand you get those Legion players who aren't even trying to kill you. They just have Sloppy Butcher and thanat + pop and ruin. They make the match last 20-plus minutes. Having to mend and possibly heal constantly is incredibly boring. Along with extremely slow generators and taking forever to heal after already mending. No match that lasts 20 minutes is fun. I partially blame it on cowardly team-mates but oh well.
---
Also it's kind of boring seeing lazy people do Legion cosplay as on here. Free upvotes for minimal effort. After the 10,000th one it's kind of boring. It's legit just a hoodie and paper plate. Minimal effort just like designing the legion. They were made for a borrowed time we work out of leftover deathgarden skins. Nothing about the legion is fun or original. At least their Mori is fine I guess. Can't be worse than the original Three
---
i want one too :3
---
I only play survivor. Camping end game is absolutely fine imo. In fact in a lot of cases it's really your only option to secure anything from the round. Good survivors will 100% understand you have to get something from the round and if they happen to be on the end of it then gg wp.
---
I don't mind getting camped during the collapse, what other options do you really have.
---
I play more survivor than killer — usually only play killer for daily’s or archive challenges now — and camping after gens are done is fine. It sucks if you’re the one on the hook, but can’t blame the killer for wanting to do their objective and secure a kill.
---
Aside from there being a pallet every 2 feet
---
Ok I'm done replying over and over again I wanted to say gg and he was acting like he's dealt with way too much toxicity so I wanted to make sure he knew I didnt want to be a dick even if he has his own reasons I just wanted to say gg and ask a question I didnt know how he was gonna act at all. I didnt want to change that
---
I’m level like 41 and I no life the fuck out of it lol. Looking forward to tomorrow so I can get to level 50
---
Hmm might have to pick up pharmacy... been debating swapping self care for it in my ace int the hole plunderers instinct build but not certain I want to give a chance at something more preferable when I only get 3 shots.
---
D E T E C T I V E  F A P P
---
I agree it's funny. I thought you were asking why it happened the way it did.
---
I hadnt heard of this, but I'd say no. Kind of a risky move bc you're practically sacrificing 4 gens and it'd be pretty easy to run thru her traps while she's taking someone to the hook. I wouldn't be mad facing this as a survivor.
---
That sounds... terrible.

haha i'm kinda corny, i just play afk survivor on a monitor next to me as i work at a computer all day. not a bad strategy for someone who can do that. i'm not afk all the time, but i only pick up the controller to unhook someone, then i put it down again. perks WGLF, deliverance, borrowed time, bond/bind.

by majority of games you mean FOS, where precise mouse control is important, DBDs closest thing to this is huntress, and a mouse won’t give you that much of an advantage, even 360s are fixed with low sensitivities. make it toggle able.
---
Dark souls 3 memes. Wow. Nostalgia has pierced my heart.
---
Oh i just wasnt sure
---
It could just be that Evan is so submissive to the entity purely because it reminds him of his father
---
Better yet, what if Evan's father is The Alchemist, torturing other superior killers the same way he did his own son.
---
So badly that they had to buff him with an entire rework! I can't imagine they'd be that hippocratic.
---
How much experience do you get every match? I get between 520-620...
---
*SPOILERS FROM ARCHIVE*
---
From what information we have most suspect The Alchemist is either Vigo or Benedict turned insane through injecting himself with serum. I think it’s more likely to be Vigo due to his inventing nature, vast knowledge of the realms (It is known that the Hatch was most likely created by him as it’s not the Entity’s) and the fact he was experimenting with serum. He’s been into The Void and also escaped it amongst other feats.
---
Ghostface and wraith. Silent bell and insidious on wraith is hilarious.
---
When you are getting ready to make a skill check, take into consideration the time it takes to press the button, so dont start pressing it once its ontop of the success zones, but rather a little bit before
---
Plunder’s/Ace is more fun in my opinion; you stash up a lot of good items and add-ons. But, if you want a consistent green med-kit then obviously Pharmacy.
---
Are you being sarcastic about bad players or serious? I just started playing recently and I'm honestly wondering.
---
I’d be up for the challenge, and seeing some replies, I would also be for an optional choice and would opt in to play against PC players.
---
Yeah god forbid fans get excited about discussing who the next killer might be. Fuck them for trying to get hyped
---
Plunderer's and Ace in the Hole and you get yourself an insane medkit with eventually an 'insta' heal
---
#lets slow the game down just a little bit
---
\+1
---
I don’t own all of the killers, this is just dbd bugging out.
---
Honestly, I’m at level 35 with Meyers and I’m still not finding an optimal way of playing him like Montz or Ohmwrecker does, anyone got any tips or personal play styles they like to do with him including the addons?
---
Still no MYC :(
---
I can sympathize with wraith, bring petals while they are here.  Its free real estate.
---
I agree but as others have mentioned here and in a similar post a few days ago it would be near impossible to program decent Bots. What I really wish they had is some form of single player killer mode. Close to the same thing you're asking for but it could be some type of open-world linear story with completely different purposes and objectives for the Bots.
---
What's your healing option? Despite its nerf I'm still content with self care so am not sure I want the medkit from pharmacy. 
---
But the emergency medkit you get is quite good, if not a little low on charges
---
He’s always had massive breaks it will be fine
---
That would be cool!
---
I want The Cell to have its own chapter. I've never seen anybody suggest it before. It has a great killer plus two survivors. A lot of different skins for the killer already and could have some awesome ideas for a new map.
---
I wish survivors were not just skins. Just so I can say damn you Quentins!! Or Jane is OP. That ass is to thicc.  Then again we do have a ninja master Claudette in every lobby. All in jest. Sorry I'm a killer main and all that I read about on here is how I should not play a killer by a person who does not want me to kill him. I can't tell people to not be on coms. That's OP against me!!! That would be crazy of a killer telling a survivor how he wants them to play. I think the more people complaining about a thing they don't like. The more attention they bring to it. I believe it's called the Streisand effect... Look it up.
---
"I've lacked inspiration for decades. My work became mundane, AIMLESS! I've come to crave a new form of entertainment!"
---
It’s a ‘win more’ perk. Like dying light or barbecue. If you’re benefiting off of hooking a survivor, it’ll just make it easier to hook the next one.
---
Okay, Spirit Main.
---
Cries in clown
---
I love Steve but he sounds too.. weird. ACE MAINS RISE UP
---
So they lost to being retardedly altruistic and tried to say you’re hacking?.. lawd the entitlement is real.
---
i feel it :( so much potential
---
Okay survivor that chooses to remain ignorant
---
I'm no editing professional, but it looks pretty good to me! I never thought that the music would work so well.
---
That's cool and all dude but you really just came in here for a humble-brag and said absolutely nothing about the post. Literally nobody cares.
---
I find more ebony mories than greens ngl.
---
Wtf are you talking about? 5 second fatigue stuns never existed, *literally ever*. Even on 5 blink Nurse your fatigue stun was capped at 4 seconds. Her base fatigue stun is 2 seconds and every chainblink adds .5 to that timer. The current fatigue time for Nurse is the same as it was before her changes. It was not changed literally at all. And as for your whole “she can’t spam her power as much” that’d be all fine and dandy if she didn’t need her power to do literally any basic killer functions. Imagine if Clown couldn’t down survivors without his bottles, he’d be tremendously weaker than he already is. 
---
Send me a link to where they have said “we would like to implement this change but Nurse/Spirit/Billy would benefit too much from it”. The Badham rework is a pure example of the devs restructuring the map to favor killers in a way that was completely benign to Nurse and Spirit and was a giant buff for Billy.
---
Spirit doesn’t need nerfed nearly as much as other killers need buffed. I don’t think you understand that this game is a survivors game. Spirit is one of 3/17 of the killer roster that is viable at red rank. Do you think that’s bc the remaining 14/17 are perfectly viable and those three are just standouts? Or is it maybe the other scenario, that the remaining 14/17 are NOT red rank viable and survivors sniveling and crying about Spirit are pissing off killers that just fucking lost 1/3 of their red rank viable roster and are soon to lose now 1/2 of it. Did the thought that maybe. Just maybe. There are more problematic parts of this game than Spirit right now? And that the only reason Spirit is on that chopping block is bc there’s a brigade of crybabies on the nerf hype ship threatening to not buy the latest cosmetic if BHVR doesn’t giganerf her to old Freddy levels of bad? Seriously you have to be stupidly ignorant to think that Spirit is the biggest fucking problem with the game right now.
---
 You have chases designed to last multiple minutes when 3 generators can easily get done in less than 3 minutes. You have the fact that survivors can 3 gen themselves, be in a prime position to lose (as they deserve), and get a key for a miracle escape that they don’t deserve. You have totem spawns that are literally surrounded by *nothing*. You have less than half the fucking killer roster viable at the Highest levels of play. You have disgustingly survivor sided map structure (cowshed. Rancid. Haddonfield. Ironworks. Coal tower. Suffocation. Groaning storehouse.). ALL of that is shit that survivors abuse the living fuck out of still and yet Spirit. *Spirit*. **SPIRIT** is the overpowered one. Yeah no, maybe the issue with Spirit is that she’s the only killer that most of this bullshit means absolutely nothing to. But no, can’t ever think beyond “red rank killer good? Must be OP. Nerf for my flashlight clicking blendette squad to bully without penalty pls”.
---
GG congrats! What killer were you playing? :)
---
Congrats! I just recently got mine with the doctor the other day.
---
I never said to run away, just hide until the killer passes
---
Its "who bring moris or bnps and keys" sided
---
Fair enough. But will latency be better or worse.
---
You one item per prestige it goes up to P3
---
*furtive chase only activates on hooking obsession, with the obsession changing with every unhook.  The obsession changing makes it have interesting potential in some builds.
---
Well when you see a Babysitter, you know he’s gonna get farmed instead of you.
---
There's 3 levels of prestige.  
---
Level 1 gets you the weapon.  
---
Level 2 gets you the torso.

Level 3 gets you the head.
---
I know, its why I'm mad, didn't even get the choice to not take it since they were the early bloodweb
---
They would have to censor the whole character model.
---
it's fun for BP and catching immersed players but it's only like "functional" on 3 maps, maybe 4
---
I want to do 360 spins toooo! Not 45 wiggles
---
P1 - Bloody Weapon
---
P2 - Bloody Body
---
P3 - Bloody Head
---
You should also get better items/add-ons etc. from the bloodweb but that has proven to be more of a myth
---
You don't get all of them when prestiging, it's weapon body then head from what I can remember also there's no reason to prestige unless you really like the bloody cosmetics or like completing them fully
---
You dont even need normal chat, you just need a tm8 spamming what a save! On your first goal conceded even though you've cleared the ball and saved the ball countless times that match. I honestly think they should have clears be an area on the leaderboards. If they were there I'd have like 26 clears and my tm8's couldn't say "LOOK YOU HAVE 0 SAVES"
---
Uh I didn't leave the game. In fact I firecracker saved a meg and got everyone out. What.
---
Stridor is bad on spirit in my opinion, makes the sounds louder but can be deceptive making them seem closer than they really are
---
Are you stuck in a gen?
---
Can you elaborate on that please?
---
Unless you’re against a wraith, pig, ghostface, tier 1 myers, who can just drop their terror radius and follow you.
---
Nobody cleanses totems in higher ranks, they're just doing gens dude...
---
I’m confused help
---
OHHH FUCK OP
---
The first survivor who’s actually a killer holy shiiiiit
---
Its pretty ironic the ultra rare is more common than the uncommon
---
What do you mean? I dont have an issue getting Hawkins Lab, Lerys or the gane with my Hillbilly... the only killer whose power gets utterly fucked by those maps...
---
In my book, rule #2 is
---
What a save! spam = instant mute
---
This same point has been done to death. 
---
DEATH I SAY.
---
What is that song name? Gets me every time
---
Doesn't make it any less true.
---
What I don't understand is why this would be a problem, someone care to explain to me?
---
Like, in my head I can't see why they would need to get the rights for the franchise again when all they're doing is updating Quentin's model (something that was included in the license they already got in the first place to bring him to the game) to match the actor's face because he agreed to give them the rights to use his likeness. The franchise owns the character, not Kyle's face, and because BHVR already got the rights to use Quentin and now the rights for Kyle's likeness, I really don't think there should be any problem when it's just an update for the model?
---
No need to say it's dumb. Reason I asked for opinions is because opinions can be wrong and they can change. From what I've read only control advantage would be on huntress and nurse so I stand corrected on the advantages then. Id still like them to optimize keyboard and mouse for console.
---
First of all: If you want to create a strong build you need perks that help you not allowing gens to be done. So the only useful part of Bitter Murmur is being able to see survivors when they finish a gen. And now is the question: why would you want to go to a already done gen?
---
But it's said that he's not in the entity realm anymore, maybe a cutscene from the past?
---
Sweet moves
---
I can't *imagine* Pennywise would have the same mechanics as The Clown.
---
Spine chill and premonition counter undetectable
---
You must be really fun at parties
---
Spirit has plenty of counterplay. Learn to use the pallets and loops effectively to trick her while she can’t see you. There are multiple ways to do this and buy yourself tons of distance. Stealth is also extremely viable.
---
I stand corrected on my opinion that's why I asked for them. Just hoping it brings more positive then negative if it's done.
---
Wait you got points for vaulting
---
Sorry I was just overly passionate about my stance on tye topic.
---
Basically. If you got the time, try it out. Discord and Surv  both have gens pretty locked down, BBQ and whispers for anyone trying to ninja unhook or swap the last one with STBFL. I know Otz brings it up in most of his videos but in situations like mine, it does work. Also don’t forget the green button and the fuming mixtape to find singular survivors at the start of the game
---
Only in chases I believe
---
Pharmacy and Furtive Chase are the only perks worth picking up here considering they're both perks belonging to licenced characters. 
---
Furtive Chase kinda sucks though, not gonna lie.
---
Come on now, DbD doesn't even run well relative to other console games. There's nothing snobbish about taking issue with a game that struggles to maintain a stable 30fps, especially when that game is competing with cheaper, better polished titles.
---
Aight I will try thx for the tip
---
Official. This was a few years ago, but the devs tried to add AI killers to fix queue times. But all they did was stand in place and spam m1
---
Why not Daryl and Carol.
---
I'd be ok with a double survivor chapter or maybe just have them be unrelated to the killer but still released together.
---
I got a few words that ruin that whole plan .....plunderers instinct and hatch keys
---
thanks, i love how the song perfectly fits dbd &lt;3
---
It's all good this communities already toxic enough though lol. I know for a fact I'd rather play with the nurse on keyboard and mouse than controller though. That's the only thing that won't  change about my opinion lol.

When entering a chase with the killer you scream and shit urself instantly losing one health state
---
Heyo I am not a Miguel connoisseur, but think I can help. So when playing him your number one goal at the start is to get out of tier 1 asap. Even if you see the opportunity for a hit, just stalk instead. Also find the sweet spot for the range of your stalk. If you can stalk from afar then it's very advantageous. As for play style it's sort of straight forward. Just play aggressively and try to zone survivors at pallets. If you can tier 3 someone instead of 2 hitting them then going for the tier 3 is usually the right play. Add ons that increase the amount you of evil within you gain off stalk along with addons that increase your tier 3 duration are very strong. Michael is very good at snowballing momentum so slugging the right amount is important. I think whispers is a very good perk on him to help you find survivors early and get out of tier 1 fast. I think he suffers worse off from a bad early game than most other killers.
---
I was mostly disagreeing with the statement that PC and Console shouldn't have crossplay.
---
I'd be perfectly fine with keyboard and mouse being available on any platform as it is basically the same thing as a PC player choosing to use a controller.
---
Make you do a pretty good job.
---
&gt; Guessing and luck
---
It’s got nothing to do with luck. No rng is going on inside the spirit player’s or the survivor’s head. The spirit makes decisions based on current evaluation of the survivor they’re chasing and the past survivor’s they’ve played against. The same is true in the other direction. Therefore there are expectations from both sides about the other side. These expectations can be subverted. Therefore it’s only a guessing game if you choose to simply guess. 
---
&gt; Random bots and random decisions by people.
---
Yeah no shit. This supports nothing. If a decision made is randomly then it makes no difference whether a human or machine does it. But you don’t have to make random choices, you’re a human being with a big beautiful brain. You can learn what is expected of you from the killer and defy those expectations. I may not be able to beat the spirit who makes the perfect play, but I can beat the one who makes the human play. 
---
&gt; Proof?
---
My evidence to support my idea would be the sparsity of changes spirit has had over the last year and the rise in hate towards her. Paired with the survivor attitude I often see in teammates and opponents where they just quit and run to the forums when something doesn’t go their way, it makes me think it’s got more to do with an unwillingness to get better than a genuine frustration at unfairness (See the change to enduring). Make no mistake, I understand there are legitimate grievances players have with spirit that need to be remedied, but they’re so often misdirected or sound like a parrot on the shoulder of their favorite content creator.
---
key. you can use a pink key.
---
He probably had a key.
---
Keys can unlock the hatch.
---
Why even bother putting Enduring on there? It's from a free killer so it's a pure waste of shards.
---
A good killer doesn’t need meta perks to wipe the floor with survivors at rank 1. Yes, even SWF.
---
It’s very rare but I’ve seen it happen.
---
can yall stop with these hazbin hotel posts, they arent even funny
---
Ok
---
I try
---
They don't disappear when you close them and can be opened with a dull or skeleton key
---
Yup I feel all of this comment
---
Plenty of people have told you what you get so I’ll skip that. I will say to be sure you don’t ever want those cosmetics, though. If you stay 50 and get all the perks upgraded and build a huge supply of add ons it will really suck to lose all that if you change your mind later.
---
-Frank, seconds before stabbing the janitor
---
Lincoln's mullet!
---
whats plunderers instinct lol
---
Because that’s what he excels at. Dude is not good at map control. He excels at camping.
---
Thats not really that apparent
---
Nah, Pharmacy and Plunders for all your item needs
---
In other words, a save up shards week.
---
Sold
---
awww thank you so much, it’s really my first time,  i’m glad you liked it &lt;3 all killer’s trailers are uploaded on youtube, i took all the material from there. there’s also a compilation of all of them https://youtu.be/-p-0NlZ0UwE
---
Well first, those are essentially pro players, you're not at their skill level yet. 
---
The most important addon is the J Myers Memorial, as that gives you a 25% stalk increase, and the Memorial Flower gives 11%. Judith's Journal increases the stalk by 40%--on your obsession. But that is a lot of stalk. This is useful if you're running perks like PWYF or STBFL; you don't want to hit your obsession, so you just suck the stalk out of them. Or a perk like Furtive Chase, which switches your obsession around. The other important addon is Dead Rabbit. Myers' TR in Tier 2 is 16 meters; Dead Rabbit drops it down to 12. That's before Monitor &amp; Abuse. It increases your TR in Tier 3 but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 
---
Now, Monitor and Abuse used to be THE Myers perk, but the new change means he has 0 terror radius in Tier 1, so it's less important these days. Still, it drops your TR by 8 meters when not in chase, and that would drop Tier 2 Myers TR down to 8. 
---
Anyhow, when in Tier 1 you decide either to get out ASAP, or try to go for gen grabs. It's perhaps better to do the former. 
---
Remember that when you stalk people, distance matters. The further myers is, the more he's penalized for stalking. Stalkin gpeople in groups spreads the stalk among them so it drains each of them less. When you chase people, let them drop a pallet in front of you then drain them over the pallet. Don't try to drain a target fully unless you are ready to kill them. Don't kill a target if they are full of stalk; that's stalk you will lose.
---
So you stalk people until you're at 99, then get up behind them, pop it, and feed them your knife. But since you have a minute of Tier3, try to get anyone else you can; maybe not hooking immediately if you think a survivor is nearby. Or with agitation basically chasing someone down while you go ta survivor on your back. 
---
Perks, Myers greatly benefits from Nurses Calling because the range is 24 meters. So unless you're in Tier3, you can see survivors before they know you're there. Nurses pairs well with Sloppy. Myers benefits from Discordance as it signals when there's multiple survivors you can drain/tier3 and stab. Whispers is definitely useful for finding people. If you want to kill your obsession, Remember Me is a nice perk; being stuck on a door switch longer with Myers running around is terrifying.
---
I mean last trailer seemed like it was gonna take itself seriously, but the new one is way jokier.
---
Ahhh, thank you. Something in the back of my mind was pinging to tell me Vigo wasn’t right but I couldn’t remember why lol
---
I guess suicidal people should be left to kill themselves
---
Better than the constant 
---
*survivors complaining about killers*
---
*killers complaining about survivors*
---
*new players*
---
*people who play both sides*
---
“Is this original content?”
---
I feel the main issue would be console performance. My ps4 gets frame drops any time I get any sort of status effect (like exposed) or get hit. Cross play would definitely be awesome between xbox and ps4 but PC should be kept separate.
---
makes you think you just deleted their servers.
---
No problem
---
Saw this same exact post. Nice try for upvotes.
---
I mean I haven’t seen too many, I just saw this picture and thought of this
---
You could honestly make both pics the one on the right and it would be true
---
Nah you just slug the penultimate til you find them or til 4 gens are done so hatch spawns.
---
Cant loop end game collapse.
---
Ghostface is stronger and more fun to play IMO.
---
I’ve been spending the 7 dollar subscription for like 4 months now lol
---
Dont do this, im a virgin
---
"Wait is that a freddy"
---
"No, its THE Freddy
---
Except spirit doesn’t require any skill with PB and she’s godly with it unlike good Nurses who had to spend time learning to play and earned it.
---
Because it’s over and done for. Nobody is going to ever spam instaheals anymore, they made them so much weaker, that last week was people getting it out of their system.
---
Level the Pig or wait.
---
Make Your Choice.
---
If you hate slugging soo much just bring unbreable
---
This is both wholesome, but the language is rather vulgar.
---
Is this an Adam Ragusea meme? 💀
---
Honestly the plague doesn't bother me, it's the teammates who are purple rank and up with me that dont realize how often we die cause 1 person decides to cleanse lol
---
A green medkit is really good, but in my opinion, the main appeal to Plunderer’s is  getting a key, rainbow map, or purple toolbox.
---
Good point, I dun goofed lol
---
This was the most clever response you could think of?
---
I approve.
---
Nurses, Ruin, BBQ, Discordance. And of course, Prayer Beads.
---
She’s operating at a lower frequency, that’s why you can’t see her and thus she has to interact with solid objects
---
Nah that doesn't make sense. It sucks to get face camped but you shouldn't get free points for it.
---
Why do you think this? I know a couple r1 survivors that play on controllers to a relatively high efficiency, and Umbra (a relatively popular Huntress streamer) said that the best survivor she knows is a controller player. 
---
Controller only really matters for killers from my understanding.
---
Didn't you say you were done with me about 3 comments ago?
---
Just can't give it up, can you? Someone calls you out and you're so stuck on always having to be right that you can't accept it, but you can't let them think that you were in the wrong either?
---
Nothing you say has changed the fact that you:
---
1. Tried to dictate how other people get to play their game.
---
2. Admitted to DCing when people don't play the game in the manner you want.
---
You're still just a hypocritical, entitled crybaby.
---
Ok that’s fine just wondering me and some guys on discoed we’re talking about it and I don’t know about you but I would love to play a murder monkey
---
Had a key.
---
I’m gonna play a quick match and see
---
stay the fuck away from my totem
---
I used to DC when I was new to the game because I didn't realize how ass holey it was and how much it fucked over the team. Sometimes as killer I feel like DCing against toxic SWF groups, but literally I just give up and let people farm.
---
How much of a pussy do you have to be to be scared of hate mail lmao
---
Prolly for a daily
---
The thing is when I play fun and use a weak killer I get messages telling me how trash I am and the usual ggez. That doesn't exactly incentivize me to play nice so I'm gonna break out a better killer and play sweaty.
---
I'd just like the console optimized. I think its way easier as a nurse on PC than console.
---
It’s just annoying The_Beast178, it’s just fucking annoying. Go find something bigger to cry about than something that already happened.
---
I think he means fo you dont derank. Just points in the emblem categories. No bloodpoints involved
---
It'd be neat but that's not something a large company like BHVR would invest anything into.
---
Let me know. If you're getting 800+exp every match, I want to know what I'm doing wrong. I was under the understanding that it was 1exp/sec played...
---
Neither side is op, quit bitching when shit gets nerfed. When they are nerfing something that doesn't need a nerf I feel the need to complain about it. I paid for the game I can voice my opinion.
---
Most important that if there is cross compatibility that we retain the chat after matches that shits gold sometimes.
---
Lol take my upvote. I see a Hazbin Hotel meme I upvote. Thank you.
---
I genuinely can't tell if everyone else here is being wooshed
---
Yeah but also toughen up a little... a horrible message is barely the end of the world.
---
Man's gotta eat
---
I finally decided to buy and start leveling quintin to P3, 1-50 took about 1.5Mill and 1-50 p1 took me almost 2 mill because I got less concerned with my spending
---
Lol "that same guy" was me. Dontcha worry I have so many more templates from the show I'm ready to use but imma tone it down. You all won't see any more from me for a couple days and it'll only be one every other day if that.👌
---
I'm pretty sure I came across this person with that profile message before. I didn't realise it was for YouTube "content" but that's so sad.
---
Nah screw that, if I'm trying to learn a new killer and keep getting hate on for being bad I will break out a good killer i know for a match or two before going back to learning. Makes me feel better lol.
---
Ya I can see a safety pip being fair.
---
Just NO aim assist unless you want to unleash the ez mode huntress
---
How? I never understood that
---
When everything gets drowned in the chase music or the ambience and the ambient sounds are too loud to discern audible noises lol. There is such thing as too loud.
---
Yeah he really didn’t play the game he just wanted hatemail.
---
As long as it's constructive
---
Yeah, the narrator be reading too fast lol.
---
When it comes down to it, Michael is an M1 killer. He has nothing to counter loops, so getting better at mindgames and running common maze tiles is essential. Doesn't matter if you can instant down if you can't get that hit in the first place.
---
Knowing when to tier up is key as well. Don't use it if youre not in a position to get the hit. Nothing feels worse than getting looped for your entire T3. 
---
Make the most of your T3. Infectious fright is such a good perk bc you can instantly know if theres someone nearby to down as well, or if it's better to just hook right away. 
---
Hope these help!
---
Using up ALL my data, but worth it to keep up, y'know?
---
I'm getting the same thing, playing on a different account rank 10 killer and I get 3 rank 4s and like a rank 20 lol.
---
Takes too long to setup with
---
Do you mean Yao-Guai? Because Yaoi is... Very different
---
And then I'll equip PWYF and run back and forth to a survivor and then-
---
NO!
---
JUST HIT SURVIVORS THAT AREN'T YOUR OBSESSION
---
"OGs" but doesn't mention Jake smh
---
Are you pranking us or are you a baby killer? I think we are being jibbed here
---
:)
---
Being stealthy isn't how you get good at the game though, it's better to be practicing looping.
---
Much endurance, friend
---
I mean bringing a non meta survivor build against a killer with their best add-ons and a Mori with their best perks is basically an auto lose too, with the only hope being the 4th getting a lucky hatch escape. What's your point?
---
I really liked the lantern event this tying the bonus to some random gens was bah.
---
Fuck bill, I rather get him to perks threw the shrine.
---
Same but Quentin Smith, Quentin Smith and Quentin Smith
---
Yo this thread has helped so much against spirit. Also to learn a little more she'll be the next killer I buy since killers have really been the shit lately
---
Who asked though.
---
I don’t recall making this post, cuz this is exactly what I did.
---
I'd absolutely buy a switch copy if my profile stayed the same with my PC version. It'd be nice to have that exclusive trapper cosmetic mean something too.
---
Kate is the quietest female in the game
---
Cool you saved someone and went through the hatch
---
Excellent work, soldier.
---
I get what you’re saying, totally, but
---
&gt; Also using FPS as an excuse I feel is poorly thought out. I can almost guarantee most people that games over 144+ FPS don't have an advantage over players at 60 FPS, because most people aren't pro gamers, or play at a super high level and have the reaction time to take advantage of those few extra milliseconds.
---
**60 fps?!** Are we playing the same game?! I’m lucky if my DBD runs at 15+ fps! As soon as I Nurse blink, gain Bloodlust, or get hit by Sloppy Butcher it’s literally single digits for a few seconds.
---
The scratch marks would be on the other side of shack.
---
Free wall hacks told me where to go before I even saw scratch marks.
---
Also wouldn't have been able to sneak up on her if I just followed her scratch marks. She would've seen me at shack and either loop it or drop from the hill she climbed up.
---
It could also be point boosters making them pass you. Some boosters like the event item, calculate the points on the score screen, others after.
---
Well like Ash and Ghostface, if they do another solo, but yeah, I'll take Carol, old lady, have the short or the long grey hair, I'm sure they come up with some good perks, TWD should be in this somehow but no killer works. Lol even Negan would be funny
---
Agreed. I don’t think many of the “she’s fine” people will, but those are the people that always get dragged along. 
---
They have been flying various killer mains to their HQ for help in the rework, so here’s hoping they got the right people to properly change her power with good feedback.
---
Idk why he was texting like a jackass.
---
Ok i think what causes the survivors to cough up blood is because ghostface is stabbing them multiple times in the lungs
---
Uh, I play on both PC and PS4 and can't tell the difference. The only advantage PS4 has is the ability to not read those toxic messages of you choose to do so.
---
Crusader Kings!
---
Cool you replied to my video
---
I want this so bad, just a buyback at 50% or even 25% value would be fine imo
---
I’m not going to use all of the 50+ petals I have nor the majority of my brown offerings lol
---
No but it's super unfair to play killer when you have internet that can't really handle you hosting. I'd get annoyed too if I were them honestly, but messaging you isn't the right thing to do and no you can't get banned for bad internet.
---
Fuck....I actually did know that...
---
Ghosty boy. He is so good and if he gets nerfed, I will be so sad
---
my dad coming out of the attic with a bat after screaming "deus vult" 37 times
---
The devs can tell when someone has bad connection or is cheating. You’re fine.
---
Thank you for this! This is what I was looking for! What do you think about the “ jump scare “ build he has?
---
either way if she was paying attention as u mentioned she would've seen u walking in general towards her the perk kinda helped here but she was more oblivious than anything
---
I didn't say shred was as good as the chainsaw, I said it fundamentally shuts down loops faster just like the chainsaws do. I mean if you miss all your shred attacks and just blindly spam it, sure it  won't work. But it offers mindgames and makes survivors rethink where they go, since shred gives an obvious tell that you're charging it up, but you can easily either lunge forward or just switch back to a basic attack, allowing for Demo's unique mindgames that can end chases super early if used well. Shred lunge goes far and ruins any straight line walls., which is nearly present in every single loop except maybe the Z-wall I guess.
---
Totems are fine in Hawkins, unless you're arguing for totems to be super easy to find? Which is a problem everyone has had for totems, so them being semi difficult to spot for survivors should be a good thing. Also the strong survivor loops in Hawkins can be ran without BL, sure BL opens up many possibilities, but it's still possible. Also the abundance of  pallets allows for survivors to stall decently in chases, yet due to the majority of them being unsafe allows for the killer to have the upper-hand eventually, which is what it should be, unless the survivors are efficient which if they want to win they should be; it literally offers a dynamic of whichever side is better/faster will win which seems fair to me.
---
I've never had a problem on Badham to the point where it felt unfair to play as survivors, so idk what your issue is there.
---
What are you getting at with insta heals, I'm confused? Are you upset they're gone or something? Who's complaining about their change? I'm actually glad they were reworked properly so that they weren't just destroyed into uselessness, but instead each offer unique benefits that make them still worth bringing.
---
&gt; Nerf her add-on, not her kit

And I quote, with bold for emphasis and to highlight:
---
&gt; Regardless of whether he wins or not, a doctor running straight to three close gens and only shocking gens for 30 minutes **is holding the game hostage** (Your games described the doc getting a 3 gen because YOU were stupid. Not because he went to a 3gen from the start of the trial. So your anecdotes are useless here).
---
&gt; **I will report the doc and dc** at the 30 minute mark, because I'm not playing the game at that point. I'm just watching a bar go up and down for half an hour and holding m1.
---
Different guy from the original, but still admitted to DCing. This one even reports killers that try to win.
---
Well I actually I don’t play killer often, I usually only play for the challenges to get bloodpoints, I main survivor because of my bad internet and the five minute wait between matches
---
yes, face first please behavior
---
Which is the next step to naked Myers

This kinda reminds of Diablo 1/2

Really depends on what you want! 
---
Enjoy the way you play Hag? Level up Bing Bong Boi!
---
Feel like you're hitting a wall with your favorite killer? Get some more perks for her!
---
No wrong answer imo, except if you level up other killers you end up widening your available perk pool for killers you level up afterwards, for better (Save The Best for Last) or worse (Dying Light)
---
Check his history, dude has a major hate boner for BHVR, this game and anyone that isn’t playing killer

4man swf isn't that common though, and I wouldn't be surprised if a significant portion of 4man swf aren't really "tryhard" either.
---
Sure plenty of players have the I must win mentality on both sides, but that doesn't stop most killers from being effective. Also I don't think your definition of effective should be always getting 3-4 kills every single match with only 0-2 gens popping or else this killer isn't viable.
---
*Sighs and unzips pants*
---
Naw he is fine , you cant do those janky ass hits anymore where you flick him at end to do like a 180 chainsaw.
---
Looks like the actual Diablo fight re-imagined
---
I mean I've seen and ran into these red rank survivors, and although close, it isn't impossible to 2k off of them, which if everyone played well should be balanced right? There are killers that struggle to do it I agree, and I pointed out that lot, I'm right there with you in wanting to buff the low tier killers, but there definitely isn't 14/17 of them that need these major buffs.
---
Even if you have to play like an "asshole" to win, it's possible. Keep in mind I'm not talking about playing by the "survivor rules" or even the killer rules of no camping, tunneling, slugging or no using the strong loops or flashlights. If everyone uses what they got, I more than not see these games with 5 sweaty players usually end up rather close, sure it may tip to a 1k or 0k with 1 last minute clutch play, but just as often as with that lucky last minute down or something that results in 3 people all dying right at the end game.
---
WTF, why do you use the analog stick as the button for skill checks?
---
Watch us be so fucking wrong.
---
Im literally the onlyone to hate ghost and love billy
---
Sorry but I'm obviously going to go with the trends I've seen, aren't I? Fact is most people are trash at this game and can't hold a chase for more than 3 seconds, waste pallets all the time, and always fuck up flashlight saves. Those people have a STRONG correlation with people who run perks like Spine Chill and Premonition. I understand that you're upset and want to try and assign some "dickhead" narrative to me where I'm on a high horse, but I'm not going to argue with my first hand statistics.
---
Does knowing where survivors are going to run and effective trap herding just come with experience? Because I try to make this grand trap layout and it just falls to pieces as gens get done
---
everyone put down "Not scary enough" so they'll hopefully make this an actual horror game
---
Clown, Legion, Doctor, and Wraith have spoken.
---
DbD has some of the best design and art ive ever seen in a game. The minute details you can see are the best as well as just how great it looks
---
I don't much care what people think in regards to the replies to him and the other two like him in the thread. They throw a tantrum and people just ignore it, they keep thinking throwing a tantrum is acceptable.
---
If you think I'm the crazy person for calling him out, and continuing to call him out everytime he pushes his thin argument of ignorance and double-standards, maybe you should reevaluate things. Maybe you should be calling him out too, instead of just sitting there shaking your head and saying nothing.
---
Cause doing nothing just supports them. It's why some people think it's okay to report the killer for daring to try and win.
---
Wow, that was a lot of salt. With a lot of potty mouth. Relax. It is just a game. 
---

---
Scott, OhTofu, and I aren’t saying she needs nerfed. We are saying they way she plays does not allow for intelligent interaction from the survivors which makes it unfun and frustrating for survivors. That is the problem. Regardless of how she can get downs at higher levels, that remains a problem. 
---
Yes there are other issues, but those don’t fix how unfun it is to play against a halfway decent Spirit. Legion was underpowered originally, but was also unfun to play against. Same problem, different lethality.
---
2&amp;3 I agree with. make his shock range the range it is with mouldy electrode and it'll be perfect. Change scrapped table and the piece that makes you see your shock range as well.
---
1 I kinda don't get. When I first started playing doc I never found him hard to play and he actually became my favourite killer to play after just 1-2 games with him.

hey, i haven't heard from that, could you send me a link to the article?
---
They would basically have to create an entire new game
---
Trapper and hag would destroy everyone.
---
Absolutely atrocious
---
That would be a hard feature to implement since the term “face camping” paints a lot of situations with a wide brush.
---
Ok and you going around attacking random people and comments is fucking annoying u/antagonistdan
---
Oh just realized you're likely a troll based on the name lol have a nice day.
---
Sure:

https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/The_Hallowed_Blight
---
This is quite possibly perfect, keep up the good work
---
it really just do be like that 😔😔
---
Back then in 2017/2017 it was possible to just walk out. It was a bug, and since we all know that DbD is spaghetti code that bug might be back.
---
Just change some animations and keep it as it is.
---
Awesome, that's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much and again great work.
---
Being upset isn’t the case. I’m simply stating to you what the facts are. What you have is an opinion. Confirmation bias of that opinion as well, based on your comments. Here’s your opinion: You don’t believe SC to be a great perk because in your experience as a player, you think there’s a correlation between that and bad players. Here is the fact: Your experience alone does not dictate or set a precedence to follow. Got it? If you want to argue that, then I could easily counter that by saying (as a red rank survivor and killer) that the best survivors I’ve gone against run SC. I hardly run into shitty survivors at red ranks. As a red rank survivor, I find SC to be amazing as it usually allows me to avoid chases all together. But again, that’s simply my experience and not a fact. Neither is your experience. My comment about you being on the high horse is simply because you seem to think you can speak as an authoritative figure on the matter, when at the end of the day, you’re another player with an opinion like all of us. Get over yourself.
---
True, would be more scary but don't know if it can actually work.
---
LOL, that sounds very amusing.
---
He's clearly going to check your vibe 👌😳
---
&gt; It’s got nothing to do with luck.
---
It's got everything to do with luck because you as the survivor aren't working off of any information. You are guessing what the other guy is doing. They are standing completely still, looking at you or looking in the distance. You have no information, you are making a decision based on nothing and hoping it's going to work. If she hits you, yay she guessed right!
---
&gt; But you don’t have to make random choices, you’re a human being with a big beautiful brain. You can learn what is expected of you from the killer and defy those expectations. I may not be able to beat the spirit who makes the perfect play, but I can beat the one who makes the human play. 
---
You are working off of no information. You don't know if she's phasing of if she's taking a sip of her drink, either thing can be happening. Your argument about human reactions would be vaild if spirit gave **literally any information about what she's doing.** Any other killer can be read in a chase and you can avoid getting hit if you make a correct split second decision based on what information the game gives you. You are an active participant of the chase, even if it's vs Nurse that you can't loop. None of that with Spirit, you flip a coin and cross your fingers.
---
&gt;My evidence to support my idea would be the sparsity of changes spirit has had over the last year and the rise in hate towards her.
---
Nurse got no changes after her initial change right after launch, just like Spirit. Nurse got absolutely no changes over the years after that till she got reworked. It took y e a r s for nurse to get a change. Legion got no changes after the ptb till he got reworked. Freddy got no changes for a long time after his initial hotfix, then he got reworked. If you think Spirit is an outlier then you're wrong, plenty of characters recived changes after being left alone for a long time.
---
&gt;See the change to enduring
---
The change to enduring is a buff, outside of using stairs to cancel distance gained nobody competent actually tanked ds unless it was the very start of the game. Enduring and it's combination with sf got buffed, and it's really noticable. 
---
&gt; Make no mistake, I understand there are legitimate grievances players have with spirit that need to be remedied
---
Ok no offense, but you've just said this a few messages ago:
---
&gt; I’m not a bad-idea epidemiologist. But I do know that this narrative about spirit needing to be nerfed beyond just prayer beads started about 3ish months ago
---
So I have a hard time trusting you on that one. You seemed pretty set on the idea that besides the beads Spirit is fine.
---
don't get me wrong i would love to see it work somehow but the game has now been designed and made for the survivor to have a third person camera and would be to drastic to change right now. It would have been something they would have had to do whilst designing the game in production.
---
Huuuuh? Where you got this information? Lol
---
Trapper Traps would arguably be more vissible, boost sound of trap setting and you know where he put it as in 3rd person. And Hag could be adjusted slightly as well.
---
Doctor has been my favourite killer since his release and I want him to be more viable. :(
---
Bro, its a game. You're seriously acting like they committed a crime. Its not some argument over politics, its just a guy who has a different opinion, and yet, you're following them to different threads and then 'calling' them out. So yes, you do indeed look like a crazy person and honestly, you should probably chill.
---
It's pretty shitty for any M1 killer. Especially if the survivors have BL
---
It would literally be a 4k every single game
---
I try pretty hard to avoid bad teachable perks sadly got forced to take beast of prey, but eventually I will end up getting them amyway.
---
I remember hearing it from back when the bee was a meme
---
Agree, new animations, more details to generators etc. But imagine going trough the corner and suddenly see killer red stain, this would be true horror experience i belive. Maybe make it like additional mode? I mean like in PUBG? And i dont want to sound like an asshole, but they making yearly DLC and have cosmetics as well, now with pass included. I belive they could put those money on good use for team handling this.
---
First of all. Even a child could tell you that fatigue Stun was nowhere near 5 seconds. At WORST that was 3 seconds. Second, I’m talking basekit Nurse. Tru3 is running a meme build in that video with 2 addons that used to increase fatigue duration. But even then. If you do the actual math, you see that you are wrong. There is no fancy dancing around it. Ur just wrong. Nurse has never and doesn’t have a 5 second fatigue stun, the fatigue stun was not adjusted at all in exchange for the new changes. You are, say it with me, *wrong*. 
---
Also the forum discussion there was discussing mostly how McCote pulled the “if you don’t like the game play something else” stunt he pulled. But they also talked the “if you wanna win play Nurse or Billy” Line. That *highlights* the issue and doesn’t at all prove the devs were refusing to change aspects of the game bc they were too afraid of how Nurse or Billy would take advantage of it. You aren’t addressing anything. You are grasping at straws looking for an argument when it’s clear you don’t actually understand what’s going on. 
---
Also. The complaints are that Spirit is OP and frustrating. I have news for all the survivors who say “I shouldn’t have to run X perk to counter Spirit”. I shouldn’t have to run Noed bc gen defense perks suck and gens get done at the speed of light but look at where we are. If one side has to suffer it with no change on the horizon, you bet ur ass the other side better be suffering too. But no, they won’t be. BHVR is catering to the sniveling crybabies who can’t stand the idea that their blendette squad can’t bully 1/17 of the roster.
---
Making terror radius louder by killer promixity would fix that imo and Spine chill would be new Meta perk.
---
I mean by your logic, flash lighting and teabagging are part of the game... so not really an exploit lol. Just say you’re toxic and go.
---
btw in vigos description in the wiki, it says he is also called ''alchemist'' is that a mistake or what?
---
It would fix most of the killers problem. Being vissible from miles away and make gen rush much less viable because of limited vision. I belive it would fix a lot of issues and make killers threat, as they are now, i ask killer rank 6 have sweaty matches all the time, and if reds take new parts i have no chance at all.
---
Spirit hasn't even been nerfed yet? Calm down.
---
so you're just being a salty killer?
---
They seem upset that you prefer the PC version. The difference is night and day.
---
I play on both and the PS4 version runs so bad compared to the PC version, but I put up with it for the few friends I have left on that platform that play DBD. I really want cross play, but cross progression would be good too.
---
This is one of those instances when camping is a valid choice,  the other being when people are insanely aggressive, i.e., saving, healing,  clicking flashlights in front of you especially if you already are leaving the hook before ...etc. against you. Don't mind what the survivors say to you at this point because: 
---
1. You have to kill them/secure a kill for whatever the reason, a daily hook or just wanting to increase kill count or maximizing bloodpoint gains.  Note that if you are near the hook, you lose emblem points towards gaining a pip for ranking purposes and so that is a risk you might need to take.
---
2. You don't have any generators to prevent from being done and/or gates from powering up. This is especially true if you hook the unfortunate survivor near a gate! 
---
3. Corollarily from 2, survivors don't have any more other objective other than powering the gate and saving their teammate. Knowing this, they are most likely near the hook in an attempt to save their teammate for whatever reason, like wanting everyone to escape particularly if they are SWF,  or from the potential bloodpoints gain from altruistic actions. 
---
Due to this three reasons, you'll find it hard to find a killer who doesn't camp at the endgame.

I agree, looping with pallets would be impossible because you can't check your distance. Killers would outplay literally every pallet if the survivor didn't drop the pallet down early.
---
the post clearly says "gameplay"
---
Quality sodium post
---
I need more No0b3, Monto &amp; Puppers drunk videos/streams. They're an amazing threesome.
---
it really do feel like that sometimes
---
Anyone know how to purchase with these things? Im on a pc and dont see an option to use or anything! Driving me nuts!
---
Me while playing: “TRAPPER IS ON ME AHHHHHHHHH- hey that’s a nice detail they have for Springwood. Really nice consistency-AAAAAAHHHHH!”
---
You can only buy the event skins with it;
---
I think the bigger fear is a homogenization of Killers and how that will quickly make the game boring to play. We saw Freddy go from a unique playstyle to a Master of All Trades that completely invalidates a ton of killers (Clown, Trapper, to name two).  I mean, Freddy's rework gave him close to the same kit as Demogorgon, and you really wouldn't want to play a teleport killer with a sub-par ability as opposed to a teleport killer that destroys loops.
---
There seems to be a general consensus that if the Killer can't teleport across the map on a moments notice or have insane movement speed (or in one case, actually attack at range), it's a garbage killer that you shouldn't play. Ghostface is the only Top Tier Killer (who a ton of people argue isn't even in the top tier) who has no mobility whatsoever, and I personally am extremely worried with the direction they're taking recent killers.
---
Spirit is one of the only Killers that requires you to play differently against her. Watch Tru3's video, his shit works. Survivors as a general rule don't like playing differently against any Killer since it's "general knowledge that the game shouldn't work like that", and that *is* going to kill the game no questions about it.
---
I think we can all agree that she needs to have some (better) indication that she's phasing, and Anal Beads needs to go. But she's fine for the most part.
---
Bug. 
---
The splinters appear for any dlc you don't own. It should let you play as a lvl 1 killer essentially, with no perks or add-ons. 
---
I've used a few, once for pig, once for cannibal and twice for Myers. They worked every time. 
---
I do recall seeing someone else complain about a splinter not working recently, and it may have been Freddy, so that could be the issue. Either way, submit a bug report and hope it doesn't happen again I guess?
---
DS works so well in these moments!
---
only on console, pc has to pay for feng.

Anyone know how to get the option to use as currency... i dont see any. Im on a PC through steam and dont see sh(t.

Hey! That’s an insult to bulldogs with Down syndrome! Apologize!
---
Nice, no real point to mending in his face tho lol. If you are in a chase it doesn't go down anyways.
---
That change would be an add on, of course.
---
There is only so many scenarios that it would actually be that strong, but sometimes it'd let you go somewhere else if you intended to slug the guy anyway.
---
Make button for looking back. Like f or something to briefly look back. Would be hard to master but same effect. Maybe change Red Stain in chases to be more informative or some six sense to survivors? I mean i am not a designer but there could be some solution.
---
Yes. I used to be nice 😭

You’re right, I shouldn’t be saying their name in vain. I apologize
---
Yeah, I realised that after the fact, I was talking to my friend while it was going on and just sorta doing that on autopilot.
---
Ghostface, Myers and Legion. In that order.
---
Doc is easy to pick up but generally one of the hardest to master due to how pin-point precise you have to be swapping stances.
---
Doc's two big focuses are finding survivors and shutting down loops. Higher rank games the survivors aren't hard to find and shutting down loops with him is much much harder than it has to be.
---
Right there with you bud. I also just want to know what they are to see if I can even do them. Those Tome IV challenges scare the shit out of me.
---
What the hell was that? Is there a rank 21 I don't know about?
---
Why do you people like this shitty game?
---
The previous version of emergency medkits when used with botany allowed you to fully heal yourself or teammates twice and still have charges leftover to keep it. Now you can no longer do this.
---
Freddy and Billy are the most balanced killers in the game, change my mind.
---
I'm also a survivor main so I cant tell if I'm salty.
---
Umm pink hair Neas and blue hair Fangs
---
Where is the bad matchmaking? lol
---
Good man, besides, she looks more like a female version of Quentin
---
Or... people could lighten up too? It’s a game.
---
"If you play doctor and get haddonfield, you're gonna haave a baaad tiiiime."
---
This would completely break the game. Fundamentally it's been balanced on the FPP/3PP basis from the start, changing that would force them to rebalance ever aspect of the game. 
---
It would also put survivors at a massive disadvantage, and would just kill the game by running off the survivor playerbase. 
---
Change your mind, cause you haven't thought this through at all.
---
Science
---
Honestly I don't like getting face camped either but a lot of killers don't really have a choice anymore. All of them but extremely extremely talented players are left in the dust. You're either forced to play Killers like Spirit Freddy and Ghostface or get bullied the whole match. In my opinion nurse is no longer viable on a lot of maps.
---
Not to mention bully squads will fuck with the killer the whole match a lot of the time and kind of keep this chain of toxicity going. One side is rude to the other and as a result of One Survivor or killer having a bad experience constantly... They end up becoming toxic themselves. It's an endless cycle.
---
Face camping is a bad strategy though. Good survivors will do all of the generators while one person buys them time. And the killer gets next to no points for face camping so that is their punishment.
---
Then again killer queues are almost instant and survivors have to wait for quite a while. I'm guessing it's because nobody is having fun as killer anymore and just waiting until rank reset.
---
It’s probably because of his move, which he’s doing for better internet and to take care of his cat

Seems pretty solid. One thing I noticed is that you currently don't have any slow down perks. That isn't a problem necessarily, but it does mean your build has to be very aggressive. I might suggest potentially swapping out BBQ or Whispers for Infectious Fright if you currently have it. It allows you to potentially snowball a win off a tier 3 pop. Also combos well with monitor.I personally also like to run Enduring on my M1 killers. You can basically ignore pallet stun with it. Brutal Strength is also an alternative to Enduring as it's not bad on Meyers. I believe you're  talking about the build that uses Vanity or Scratched Mirror. Vanity keeps you from passing tier 2. Scratched keeps you from passing tier 1. They allow you to see the auras of survivors at a certain range when you stalk and your terror radius is either nonexistent with Scratched or 16 meters with Vanity. It's a fun build, but they are very map reliant. Usually you use them with a Lery's offering. Though the new map might not be bad. Haven't tested it there.

 A perk that makes it easy to find hatch keys in the chest in a trail
---
ok unexperienced player
---
People thought that last year, all those cut scenes were about him too and a year later nothing.  I think his purpose is for furthering the lore.
---
Which perks neede to be rebalanced? Could you tell me? I am genuinely confused. Some overall game balance sure. But which perks are 3rd person reliant except alert one?
---
How did she face camp you?
---
Thanatophobia is top tier on Legion imo. Hex: Ruin is mandatory to optimally slow the game down. Other than that you've got a ton of flexibility in perks. My personal favourite build is BBQ, Ruin, Thanatophobia and Third Seal.
---
Idk, I mean I feel as if it's like a fourth or fifth of the content on this sub, I just didn't think anyone was being "not calm. "

Everyone here saying it takes forever for survivor matches like what?!?! I have to wait at least 7-10 minutes or less if I’m lucky. Takes me like 2 for survivor.
---
Yeah. If all three other survivors are near the hook and obviously trying to bait a chase away while the gates are open... You're supposed to follow the healthy survivors most killers are unable to stop due to a useless power.
---
At least according to the survivors rule book for Killers that's how it's supposed to be done. Always take the obvious Chase and never camp. Camping implies staying on the same side of the map as a hooked Survivor at any point during the match.
---
Before I get downvoted. That is sarcasm. Sometimes you are left with no choice but to camp. If one Survivor in a match is extremely toxic for example... I will purposefully let the other three go and just take that one person.
---
Either you dont have it tier 3 or the killer has stridor
---
Keep both first person is fair deal or make killer 3rd person as well?
---
Lol why are u getting downvoted?

You’re the one that sounds like a rank 20 to me, because people generally like Ghost Face. Have you even played against a skilled Spirit?
---
Prove thyself, commodious toolboxes with all fastest gen speed add ons, and my dumbass not bringing ruin, it’s definitely possible. Even without toolboxes/prove thyself, survivors can have gens done ridiculously fast
---
&gt;I think it ends when the archives end?
---
This is just for the Serum. The themed generator, hooks, flashlights and medkits are gone tomorrow (or today depending on your timezone).
---
"Maybe I'll be Genji..."
---
Y’know youve been watchin too much of the office when you get confused as your see Dwight
---
I feel like we are disagreeing for no reason and want the same changes to happen but for different reasons lol.
---
But imagine this - you go into a game and get unlucky enough to be tunneled, hooked and camped. Throughout your time at the hook you can't do anything else like repairing and healing etc for bloodpoints, inevitably leading to a depip or derank. 
---
I know that there's a lot of RNG and different sorts of people in this game, but people who play maliciously/bad sportmanship-like, aren't punished enough like DC'ers and people who take the game hostage would. With those affected receiving no to little compensation for this.
---
Well all the Hallowed Blight survivor cosmetics are labeled as “Vigo’s ___”
---
What
---
I meant in general, not this post.
---
What is genrushing?
---
Guilty performing this action a couple of times as a survivor :(
---
Yea cause he’s a spooky character we’ve never seen plus do you think Dwight actually became his apprentice? No their just fun outfits
---
Can we get an F for F13?
---
I would like 3rd person killer so i can see the cosmetic i'm usin ngl, but yeah that would be killer sided af, they literally couldnt hide.
---
This guy is so up his ass its frightening.
---
So you're saying you get a killer lobby instantly? Interesting..it takes a year to get into a lobby for me and maybe 10 seconds to find a killer as a survivor.
---
I always feel so bad for my yellow and green rank friends who insist it’s fine that I play w them as a rank 2, and then they proceed to get wrecked by a spirit every other match
---
Mention your platform and rank somewhere!
---
"Calm down" was directed at OP acting like Spirit has already been nerfed when she hasn't. As in "nothing's even happened yet, calm down".
---
I did in the post I made before this but I’ll leave it on this one too :)
---
Hold up, just checked the wiki
---
It is him
---
I main legion and enjoy stronger killers getting nerfed.  The baseline of trapper and ghostface are nice, clear playstyle and counter with good payoffs.  Red ranks is supposed to difficult, players who keep relying on top tier killers just so they can have an easy time is counter intuitive.   
---
Especially the ones who go "I 4k everytime". Whats the point of playing survivor if thats indeed the case
---
It's the excuse survivors always claim, when things don't go their way. Video evidently shows that.
---
Because taste is objective, what is shitty to some may be enjoyable to others.
---
How many matches did you play?
---
Hahah "Fuck off MYERS leave me the fu--is that a golden toolbox? --aaaand i'm Mori'd
---
I’m on PS4 rank 4-5 survivor btw :)
---
Game favour to survivors, i belive main part is how much info they have from such a massive viewpoint. Also it would IMO helped to reduce SWF advantage. There would be needed minor tweaks sure. But nothing drastic.
---
It's usually because someone is self-caring next to a pallet, at least on console
---
It's fine, you get nervous, or maybe misclick, we don't judge you. ^^
---
The total number of survivors in this list is 506, but it’s taken from survivor and killer points of view
---
and then the killer swings and suddenly ur frames drop to 5fps
---
Wow, that's a very original post you have here. I totally haven't seen seven other of them today.
---
Example: Every survivor except one getting a gen, with the fourth being "bait" to get the killer to chase them, resulting in 3 gens going off at once, essentially a loss for a Killer
---
Look at everyone sleeping on Amanda.. tsk tsk tsk
---
It was shitty of her to farm you, but I t-bag moris all the time. Hilarious.
---
https://www.everydayhealth.com/emotional-health/psychological-projection-dealing-with-undesirable-emotions/
---
Billy and Freddy would both like a word with you. Both of them are real powerful and perfectly capable of dominating at high ranks. 
---
Also Nurse wasn't "overnerfed", she just got nerfed. She's still perfectly viable and played at high rank. 
---
The problem is reactionists go "oh God they nerfed nurse she must suck now, guess I'll have to play Spirit since she's the new meta". So now Spirit is everywhere, Nurse gets dropped by all the meta killers, and the cycle continues.
---
Well killer cant hide as well, better reds will see even Ghost face coming miles away and thanks to perks. I see what you coming from, but survivors have biggest advantage in are info
---
Ahh okay, wel I hope everything is well I miss him lol
---
I just wanna play as Zoey
---
Heck yeah, my two stalky boys up there in the top three.
---
So you frequent bushes and tall grass then?
---
I had a similar issue, we found a lit totem early on, so we cleansed it, was HG, after it expired we found another lit totem, that was also cleansed, in the post game i saw the killer only had haunted grounds, he had no other hex perk. Yet 2 lit totems were cleansed like 2 minutes apart from each other, was really wierd.
---
3 meters or less from the hook. Hitting the survivor the entire length of their hook states. Any further I can work with with bt and ds which everyone should always be running.
---
I think it’s neat the way it is.
---
This should also go in for apex but yes I absolutely think there should be cross progression in dbd and all games
---
Tune in next time for, "101 uses for Corrupt Intervention"
---
It was still a fun game and I improved from it, I think they need to make playing with lower or higher ranked friends case by case
---
So then its The Father
---
I play Xbox it’s unless I’m killer Its extremely unlikely to see nurse now.
---
Imagine get upset at someone for facecamping. Yikes. How sensitive are you?
---
Yeah but legally that decision isn't up to him at all. It means nothing that he said that
---
Ok killjoy
---
I mean, he does need a nerf with his slowdown potential, and the dream pallets are utterly busted and unfun to go against, but other than that he's in a really good spot.
---
Me: \*sees Noob3 Meme\*
---
Me: Ah i see, a man of culture
---
(Holy sheep sonic is cute af!!)
---
Why I season my hooks NOT my survivors.
---
Holy fuck shit that's cool
---
I love some ideas, dislike others. Best idea you have is naked Myers. Mmm.
---
I have used Demo portals in chases before, it works most of the time depending where the portal is
---
I see what you did there 😆
---
Remember: If someone gets in an argument with you on this sub, it’s gonna be damn near impossible to change their mind even with common sense and proof.
---
So just avoid arguing altogether. It’s not worth it, nobody learns anything.
---
Wraith and pig arent so strong for example, as a killer i fell u are supposed to be lookin for your prey, as a survivor u hide from the killer.
---
Would be good for gameplay matters, but not for balance in my opinion, and in an online game that is important, maybe if we get offline mode
---
dude, making chase themes cost too much, the only way the spirit and the plague got it was from a youtube video allowing them to use it without copyright laws. plus that song has copyright
---
pro gamer move and wow I could feel that killer’s shitty internet through the video...w the laggy balanced landing and unhook. unless it’s just dedicated servers
---
Well I’m pretty sure everyone here knows it’s Vigo.
---
1. Vigo is already known for being somewhat of a Lunatic, and an experimenter
---
2. Last years animatic and this years details the same exact person
---
3. The cosmetic for survivor are labeled with Vigo’s name. Of course none of these are true, with Vigo’s apprentice, assistant, and marauder, but I don’t think they would just slap Vigo’s name on them to be spooky. They all clearly have a relation to the serum (most clearly is Jake and Claudette) and The Alchemist is also obsessed with the stuff. It’d be logical to theorize witching this tiny little cosmetic story that Vigo could be using these guys as his puppets to do his work. Of course he doesn’t actually
---
But idk, you make a compelling argument and I commemorate you for that. I wasn’t here for last years event so I don’t know about the signed notes or anything.
---
Don't shoot the messenger mate, I'm not on the Nightmare On Elm Street Legal Team
---
Probably be faster to just kill them quick and get it over with. There's gonna be some endgame salt, but it is what it is.
---
I'm like 3 months playing and still get lost in that beautiful temple.
---
The hate for Freddy is heating up, the fury of this sub's users needs to be focused, and Spirit has been drained, now it's time for Freddy
---
Which is bullshit because freddy isn't that strong. He's good at applying map pressure but honestly his abilities don't exactly make him end a chase quickly. Freddy is a B tier at best. A tier with best add ons
---
Baby sweet yes grown up!!!
---
How am i upset? You get mad for people pointing at you and have to stand in front of them to prevent a unhook. Hope your happy.
---
Well that’s fine I thank you for being respectful with me on the plus side on dbds YouTube channel they have last years animations and you could find the notes from last year as well on the wiki I’m sure
---
Honestly Spine Chill and Premonition are a dynamic duo, Premonition helps you determine where the killer is and Spine Chill helps you determine whether Premonition gave a false positive or not.
---
Maybe spawn with 1 or 2 traps automatically?
---
If you solely want the medkit, Pharmacy + Ace In the hole is better to get good medkit add-ons since all Plunderer's does is increase the likelihood of finding better items which is overwritten by Pharmacy for the first chest. Though if you just want to get all the good items as fast as possible, running all 3 would be a fun looting build.
---
I guess he means just bc it’s technically working flawlessly doesn’t mean it isn’t dumb asf. I know when I verse a rank 10 as a rank 4 surv it’s fairly noticeable even before the match ends and it’s rly unfair to them
---
Reasons I don't run Dead Hard anymore, that's an epic Dedicated Servers moment right there.
---
They shouldn't lose their offerings though
---
Ah, good idea. Thanks!
---
This would make detection perks useless while working on gens, totems, etc. Looping would be broken as you can't anticipate where the killer may go.
---
Which cosmetic is that?
---
15 seconds you're fuckin crazy
---
Botany Knowledge would be better, as self-care efficiency is only 20% whereas Botany Knowledge is 33%
---
Just dont watch live then. Lol watch highlights haha
---
Merely trying to survive urges killers to camp. They consider leading  along chase or looping as "toxic". Crybabies.
---
He is supposed to either be haunted by the Entity (tryin to “feed”, lure him into its realm, I don’t fucking know), or be spiraling real hard, because the backstory mentions him hearing a voice motivating him to snap while he nears his end of the rope
---
No way, that would be so boring. DBD is essentially 2 games in one, first person killer and third person survivor. Making survivor the same camera angle would make me quit.
---
He's more interested in guarding that gate than in being baited into a chase by a P3 Claudette while everyone else makes their escape.
---
Bill, bill, and bill here! :)
---
Tbh the demo has better teleportion abilities vs the hag and he also lacks the really good slowing/jump scare effects of Hag's powers. Every Hag game is a jumpscare for me and it is far more unpleasant then a demo.
---
"me good you bad haHA"
---
What build do you use?
---
Fair point. I guess it just relies on whose playing killer.
---
Yeah the obsession switching is the main reason anyone would run the perk
---
True. But this time we had straight up lore on him. We learned that he steals from killers and survivors. He collects objects. And last year we learned that he was doing Alchemy with the blight sap.
---
We also got another cutscene on him and the first time of the archive heavily focused on him. I truly don't believe they would do the spirits father since the spirit was just released. It would seem weird having another ghost wielding a katana
---
I had a feeling most of the community would support that buff for Myers. He can keep the pants off. Just remove the top part as well.
---
1 lik= OnE respec
---
I don't hate her. I just don't understand her vomit fetish. I'm not into it but she'll vomit on my chest without my consent anyway.
---
I don't even care if Clown is weak or not; I love him and his ability AND his hilarious laugh when he hits and gets hit with pallets. It's more about playing fun killers and builds rather than spicy ones.
---
You're a knob.
---
What map and may I recommend Sonic Windstorm Wraith Build for funsies?
---
Freddy needed the rework because he was too weak. I agree that pre rework he was unique and fun to play, but unfortunately i don't think they could just adjust some numbers on him and turn him into a viable killer using the same mechanics. 
---
I know the tips and everything people have tried to share as viable strategies against her, but I still think she needs work to give a better sense of counter play. I'm certainly not pretending i have the magic answers to fix her, but i hope they take their time and find a fix that keeps her near the top of the food chain for killers while being more of a killer that has reasonable ways to counter play.
---
People need to not jump to conclusions though and assume that they're going to beat down any killer that's strong. I understand the fear of it, but survivors went through a year+ of constant nerfs and now some top tier killers are out of whack with their internal statistics of how they're preforming. They even said themselves that that's the reason they're looking at spirit, its not because of too many people complaining to them.
---
We also should be having some much much needed killer buffs for some of the poor guys on the lower end so hopefully the killer side of the game is a lot more balanced from top to bottom in the next half year or so.
---
so true, i love playing piggy cuz her cute lil stun noise, but she no fun without super try hard build
---
Yeah, 60fps high rez gamma boosted players vs us peasants.
---
Exactly they won’t see it coming
---
Ah I see you are a man of culture that also doesn't like to be thrown up on
---
I absolutely love the Archives, though I tend to read the lore in my head and turn the narrator off. :X
---
It's an easy fix. Just have a UI element that states something like "in queue for: console only" if you're on console or "both PC and console"
---
To top it all off make sure you say ez in the chat after you escape
---
Pig is my #1. :D Clown is #2 and Plague is #3 for me personally.
---
&gt;I guess he means just bc it’s technically working flawlessly doesn’t mean it isn’t dumb asf. I know when I verse a rank 10 as a rank 4 surv it’s fairly noticeable even before the match ends and it’s rly unfair to them
---
Maybe but from what I can see, most people have no clue that 6 ranks above or below yours is considered "normal".
---
what Freddy is running thrilling when they could be running Dying Light. I love Freddy games they're way more fun than Huntresses
---
sameee💛
---
Im only ok with it if i can turn it off cuz im not playin with no pc people
---
Definitely not any corn map, try the Macmillan estate maps.
---
Why did I ever try an argue with you? This is more fun for a quarter of the effort.
---
How can you be mad at beginners!? do you get mad at kids as well? or god forbid... do you..get mad at dogs!?
---
But still i think if the killer goes around the map to stomp stomp pallets, its not the best situation but workable than the no drops but downed early surv
---
I noticed. He's also a hypocrite.
---
Spirit nerf into ghostface rework. Ghostie is the new old freddy. Just unfun to play against. I play enough games a day I'm not opposed to suicide and just move to the next round the few times I vs him.
---
Please give me just 1000 bp for each chalk pouch and brown reagent id be happy
---
Cross progression is the single biggest feature I need in this game. I played for a long time on pc, but my pc was old and ran the game poorly. When it came out on ps4 I switched to ps4, hadn't looked back at pc.
---
Now, after a lot of content updates and grinding on ps4, I have a good computer again and could play it on PC. But I can't really, because I haven't played since like... shortly before the doctor came out on pc and I can't do that whole grind again.
---
Please Behavior, please give us cross progression.
---
I did some more digging around and the data mined code name for the next killer is “Sweden”, guess what name has roots in Sweden?...Benedict (or Benedikt)
---
When does the Spirits phase walk audio cue start and why do I sometimes not hear it? I've heard there's an addon that makes the audio go away completely, but I've played games where said addon was not used, and still she appears out of nowhere in my face.
---
yeah idk why they don’t just bring back average ranking, I think the devs were just lazy and gave up and on trying to code it
---
Perfect. At least you're good at comment comprehension. Nice one!
---
When I play killer (which is not that often) I only say gg if someone else does first. If nobody says anything or they start to get salty, I just type ez and go to the next game

I’m not playing to be friends 🤷🏻‍♂️

---
Class A Narcissist right here everyone 👌
---
All aura perks for survivors abecome far harder to use and dead hard too. What you have suggested isnt thought out in anyway and the entire way the game is played would completely change so there would need to be full rebalance
---
Baby Dweet has grown up!!!
---
Why because the gens take 4 years lol you’re exactly who this post is about
---
Before I had the internet connection I do now, I used to get accused of lag switching constantly. Still do every now and then even tho my connection is better. People like to make excuses instead of a accepting maybe it was something on their end.
---
*crazed laugher*
---
not bad, kinda like the spirit's prayer beads. even just removing the motion blur is a good idea by itself, with no reason for it to be ultra rare
---
honestly I don't care who is added, but this theory is genuinely interesting. like maybe the alchemist is stuck in a limbo realm because he is as neutrally Evil as he's good
---
ps4 is active enuff without it but it sounds nice. youd be getting gamertags from other systems, like ones that allow spacebars in the name. pc nurses would kill console survivors
---
There's no reason for the devs to NOT allow free character perks on there, if anything it only benefits them to have said perks on there due to having a lower chance to have a perk like Ruin or Decisive Strike
---
I don’t why but i never get spirits
---
no I’m not even talking about cross play I’m talking about cross save meaning you can have console data on pc vice versa
---
is claudette #1 because of her ninja camoflauge abilities? im surprised kate's not higher since she's obviously the popular cheerleader of the group
---
Let me clarify.  The devs have pigeonholed themselves into these metas.  Gen slowdown perks are a CRUTCH just like borrowed time, and DS for survivors.  If they plan on supporting this game for 5 more years they need to revamp gameplay so it is FUN for killers and survivors not just easier to get 4ks because gens become 4 minute projects.  Sitting on a gen for 4 minutes + IS NOT FUN GAMEPLAY.  And not being able to use cool unique combos as a killer because you are running 3-4 slowdown perks as a CRUTCH is not fun.  I have 1000+ hours and I play both sides almost equally.  Not fun.
---
Let’s be honest here, if swf get shown a lot of killers will just lobby dodge.
---
Thanatophobia sloppy corrupt STBFL is one of the best builds imo
---
Even better with pop
---
Sloppy butcher instead of third is my build
---
I’ve actually been maining Jeff since his release.. but I’ve actually began playing Quentin more and thinking about switching to him
---
It *is*, but it's still frustrating to have more than half of their objectives done before Killer can even get one hook
---
I voted against it because it isn't as difficult to gain bloodpoints as much as it used to be. Most players won't be affected. It would be beneficial for not buying multiple characters and im sure they will do it eventually
---
Billy, Nurse, huntress, and Hag still exist.  Did you forget?
---
Why’d he stop uploading anyways?
---
Ugh here we go, third killer up next to get nerfed.
---
how could you be against having your main account be playable on any platform without having to complete start over and lose all cosmetics?
---
Why are you talking about me like it’s soooo bad
---
Surprisingly Nea started off with a good lead on everyone, but about two weeks ago she really slowed down and Claudette shot up above everyone else lol, but I didn’t realize how popular Kate was, I thought she’d be down by Ace and Jane in the teens
---
1 - let her see survivors auras when she is phase walking
---
2 - let her move 5 times as fast when phase walking
---
3 - make phase walking last until she decides to cancel it
---
4 - her attack insta downs
---
5 - she can always mori survivors even if they have not been hooked
---
6 - she gets 20 times the blood points as other killers 
---
7 - playing as her always gives you a pip 
---

another guy is needing help on a DBD quiz too.  [https://linkto.run/p/Z1V47OQJ](https://linkto.run/p/Z1V47OQJ)

That means we gotta save it for last
---
Freddy was in a really good spot until they gave him undetectable. Now he's just ridiculous. Either that or it's just the one's I'm playing against. Either way he shouldn't have undetectable while you're in the dream world. It should work the opposite way. Undetectable while NOT in the dream world makes much more sense considering you can't see him until you're in the dreamworld... movie wise at least.
---
He's still going to be really strong no matter which way you look at it and I don't have a problem with it. It's just the disgusting builds people use with him that I hate the most.
---
Forever freddy is annoying, but i dont think it needs to change tbh. Freddy is good and slightly annoying
---
Of course you are. Console players are pretty much free kills
---
Fun fact! T rexes actually didnt see based on movement! They actually had some of the srongest believed olfactory senses in the entirety of the dinosaur kingdom. :)
---
Some people enjoy punishing themselves.
---
Runs away to self care. Gets injured. Runs to corner to self care again. Never does gens. 3 teammates died on first hook. Hatch spawns but too busy hiding to find it.
---
Cant have survivors escaping. Not like this is supposed to be a balanced game or anything...
---
Had a game against a red rank Freddy running Dying Light, Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel and BBQ, with Swing Chains and Jump Rope. 3 DC's in the first two minutes and then he just instahooked me. 
---
Survivors need to stop DC'ing. It's such a cowards tactic, and there needs to be harsh punishments in place for it.
---
Uhh i didnt even know whispers made a sound :( i watch for the icon because my hearing is dog shit :(

Sorry, but your points are just wrong. I pointed to where you were wrong, and you are denying them. You are missing the actual issues due to your emotional investment. 
---
I don’t think you are open to any real discussion based on how you handled the last couple of conversations. 
---
Have a good day and see you in the fog.
---
if they wanna use that guy for every archive forever, then he may never appear as a character, insomuch as the entity would never appear as a killer
---
Very nuanced opinion my friend

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dvm9t5/weird_glitch_coldwind_farm/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
They need to just get rid of his passive slow down addons, those things are broken. Going against a ruin/pop/DL Freddy is annoying enough, but having a ruin/pop/DL Freddy with Swing Chains and Jump Rope makes me want to castrate myself with a spork.
---
Good thing myers isnt On the nerf list
---
Sloppy's also really good. I usually use Third Seal on rank resets to make the grey-ranks panic when they can't see stuff.
---
Why bother if it got removed before? Lol
---
Kindred already does one of these things. Your other idea is convoluted and would just make the game unnecessarily complicated and weird from a game lore perspective.
---
The face camping gets worse the closer rank reset gets. But it’s been non stop rampant on PS4 lately, if it was every now and then I wouldn’t care. For the killer who got steam rolled the whole match and the gates are open and gets that one guy, sure camp him get your kill I won’t care even if I’m the one on the hook. 
---
This post was made because here lately on PS4 the face camping has been rampant game, after game, and that’s from the start of a match with rank 6 killers, all running good perks. Then yes you have to wait 15-20 mins for a survivor match just to end up being face camped or banging thru the gens and get out with no other play. My nephew said it best when I tried getting him to play this game, “it’s bs and nothing but a hook simulator” I just played a few games tonight and no shocker, most the killers all face amped. Had 2 decent matches against a spirit and Myers.
---
I agree with that especially at red ranks you should be setting an example not being the biggest cowards.
---
I can guarantee you’ll get destroyed (on similar ranks ofcourse). 
---
Some happend with Fortnite, which made my friends quit the game because pc players have a bigger advantage.
---
Plague is my second main 🥺💖
---
The fuck you gonna counter pop
---
A lot of it is time of day. 
---
Mine takes 10min around 2 pm.
---
Lol Legion is easily redeemable. Aside from Frank maybe. They’re stupid kids who got roped into shit they didn’t wanna do in the first place (again except Frank).
---
Didn't read the text. Answer is no it doesn't.
---
I don’t T bag and still get tunneled
---
Well to be fair in the early game Killers should focus on injuries instead of downs, that way you have more time to cover bases while players are healing. Thats one of the reasons why Sloppy Butcher is so useful because Mangled gives you more time to apply damage and also stop them from repairing all the gens. Double it up with Hex ruin and a fast moving killer like hillbilly or wraith and you're unstoppable.
---
And so it begins. Called it.
---
Not gonna lie, I get more hate mail playing dbd than any other game. That includes siege.
---
Wow this makes the most sense I feel dumb
---
Why would plague be next in rotation? She's not even next in line content wise. Next would be huntress, clown or pig in rotation. There's been several killers that have already had a rework done to them or some minor changes made to them. 
---
Wraith, Freddy, hag [had some minor changes], legion, nurse, spirit [had a slight change a little after she was released.] This isn't in any specific order but I'm just saying why the fuck would plague even be remotely considered to be next in your opinion or thought process?
---
Sorry bro but you're retarded
---
Gambling isn’t a mindgame. Clearly nobody here has ever played a fighting game if you really think an opponent that has no animations is totally fine lol.
---
Hag also does well tbqh
---
Cross play/cross progression and better matchmaking times are the only thing I think could benefit the game. I play Xbox and it takes a couple minutes to get a match as a killer. I only imagine it's a little faster for survivors but that's no fun for me.
---
Someone here was like watch entity edu and otz then play a few games. It will make way more sense than going in blind as fuck and rage quitting. Helps that otz is super fucking fun to watch. Honestly just watching him mind game people is so entertaining because he will call it out as he does it and youre just like wait what
---
Just don't get hooked lol.
---
totally dude noob3 definitely isnt tired of playing dbd and he only uploads videos as a source of income haha nice meme i am laughing
---
Because people are starting to bitch about her. A lot. Same shit. “No counterplay” “unfun”
---
Well, what typically happens when you play against a  LF, is you play hook simulator. That’s not exactly fun, it’s just a waste of time. The first guy should’ve waited to see how you were playing first. But the rest of them I wouldn’t blame them if they left
---
yes, cuz I’d rather be sitting on the lobby screen than slugged - at least I’m still playing and if my team is decent, I’ll be up in a jiffy.
---
&gt;I don't think the hatch should open if there are still 5 gens left. The killer should be rewarded for dealing with 3 survivors swiftly enough to make escape impossible, not punished by giving the last survivor a (arguably random) chance at escape , since the hatch could open very close to them, and even if it's found by the killer first, they still have a chance to escape through a gate, which is pretty much a 50/50 if you're not Demo/Billy.
---
Hatch spawning at 5 gens is not to give a free escape for the 4th survivor even though it works that way.
---
Hatch spawning at 5 gens is a way for the killer not to be held hostage by that survivor because he got mad for being destroyed and decided to hide.
---
Ranks?
---
It gets faster the higher up you go. I'm at rank one and the que times are almost instant.
---
I really hope we get cross play! I can definitely see why cross progression would be amazing, but I think it'd be more convenient for players to just get cross play. I don't have the money to buy a console (I play on PC), as well as rebuy the game and any other DLC I've already gotten. I totally understand some people's concerns about difference in skill, but that's why we have a ranking system! I'm sure with the larger player base that would come with cross play, it'd be much easier to make matches with people who actually have the same level of skill/knowledge regarding the game. I know there's a few other technical issues, but I truly believe they'd pale in comparison to the advantages of being able to play with friends who play on other consoles as well as a pooled player base.
---
On Xbox I have no data but I have gotten a lot of Freddy at red ranks. Goes Spirit then Freddy then Demogorgon ill track my next 100 and come up with some numbers for Xbox
---
The beauty is I don’t have to. Her power can be unfair and still be mediocre, that’s the rhythm with BHVR. She shouldn’t have collision in phase, she’s a ghost and it only results in unintuitive gameplay for both sides. 
---
Her addons are an entirely different story, I know I don’t have to explain myself when it comes to those.
---
I wanna shoot up the flower puss.
---
But thats on the killer to either catch that survivor quicker. Or give up on the chase amd disrupt what those survivors are doing to maintain pressure. There's a youtuber out there with a pretty good philosophy, if you dont get a hit or a pallet dropped in 15 seconds of a chase give up and find another.
---
That one will likely wait 15ish seconds hiding to make sure they really lost you and youre disrupting another. You might have more success trying that.
---
Oink
---
I think it should be a trade-in/upgrade system. Like destroy/combine 5 brown add-ons or offerings to get a yellow one in the same category. And so on, 5 yellow for green, green for purple, purple red. I think that’s more than worth it and a good way to recycle hardly used items.
---
I usually slug the last 2 people and I also have chilli on so I find the other guy who is down and nobody lives 😄
---
I don't think it's a gore issue or anything, it's simply because they are the first killers so the original Mori's aren't really creative. I'm sure many of us can think of dozens of ways to kill someone with a bear trap, but Trapper doesn't even use them in his Mori and both him and Wraith basically have the same one of smack the survivor a couple times and that's it.
---
What? Nobody is talking about a nerf for ds
---
Yes please. This game should be able to cross play so easily with it's simple control scheme. 
---
I'm new but I got a friend who'd love to transfer his characters and cosmetics to his steam account from the other platforms or invite his brother etc.
---
She always has had counter play from the very start. Don't cleanse and if you suck at running loops then you better start figuring it out fast. Simple. 
---
Fuck, I have been saying that from the very beginning when she was released and scrubby noobs on this sub kept saying that was actually the only way to defeat her.... bruh, no. You give her power to become a limited range instant down huntress if you cleanse and all loops become unsafe. If you don't cleanse you force her to become just another wraith.
---
Benefits of not owning any of the good perks. I just auck until I dont ;p
---
I dont know if you noticed the word "slowly" in my original post. I was mostly joking but we have 5 good killers, but the fact is the 12 other ones are subpar and hard to play in high ranks, while survivors are the same besides perks. So theyre gonna slowly burn all the meta killers out of the game at this point if they did nerf them. Which seems inevitable at this point.
---
I'm in red rank and i see an incredible amount of GF ( wtf?) I hate this :(
---
Btw please read, I am talking about cross save not cross play, that’s a whole other bridge to cross I’m simply talking about cross data save
---
They been riding rins' dad's dick hard.
---
Enduring, furtive chase, botany knowledge, pharmacy
---
Well I don't want to be that guy but don't get hooked if you don't want to be camped. If you're getting camped then the Killer is losing points as well. You're buying your team time and being a martyr. I find matches pretty much instantly for Survivor and killer. I know survive with friends is having trouble with matchmaking lately.
---
The main culprit I seem to see is that most killers are exhausted of being bullied or treated like shit every match and a lot of people have stopped playing killer entirely after nurse was gutted. It's pretty much either play Spirit Freddy or Huntress and hillbilly with super good add-ons... Or be dominated every match. And a lot of people are just choosing to opt out. Meaning very long queue times. But almost instant queue times for killers.
---
I know the only reason I would ever Camp a Survivor is if the gates are open or they did something that was quite toxic that match.
---
The build isn't thrilling it's thana or dying light. The perks isn't the problem it's the add-ons in addition. It's stupid broken tru3 went through almost a whole map of pallets in like a 25 min game. Zzz
---
I see what you mean. I find that Ruin can be countered very easily by survivors(with some practice). In fact just repairing normally and eating the hex with another player is sufficient, as long as the survivors have Bond or Empathy they can easily overcome ruin without wasting time finding the Totem. It's just a minor hindance to the average player with 100 hours.
---
Wow, the killer mains down vote a funny piece of art because it doesn't cater to their power fantasy? I love this community.
---
Here, take my upvote. Hopefully some decent people start seeing it soon. It's really cool, well done.
---
I hate people who use the word “crutch” like they’re not part of the game....  same people who say they’re crutches are the ones who complain gens get done too fast.   Play both roles and this post of yours wouldn’t exist
---
True. Although I'm not certain that the Alchemists and the Observer are the same person. I always had a feeling that the Observer may be Vigo.
---
I feel like the final Killer maybe the entity taking on a physical form perhaps. Or the final Survivor maybe Benedict Baker since he was the first named character mentioned in the lore.
---
Evil: well yes, but actually no
---
Some things about certain killers definitely need to be reworked or altered but flat out nerfs suck. Especially when they've recieved a nerf every update for no reason ever since EGC became a thing. COUGHpigCOUGH.
---
This. 
---
Have the same amount of hours, but probably 550 out of 700 on survivor. Completely agree.
---
Why do they do this I don’t understand is there more points involved does it benefit them somehow?  I thought you get more bp if your actively trying to kill survivors.
---
after 0 days gone by without Quentin hate and getting tunneled by Freddy, he gets his retribution

They really should buff him. I think getting Robert Englund to record voicelines and create a cosmetic with his likeness would be a great buff.
---
It picks perks randomly
---
She is my main as well but I've grown quite sick of playing her. I've been practically forced to Spirit Ghostface and Freddy.
---
Just because whenever I play Huntress I either get corn or inside Maps. I never get decent maps for whatever killer I'm playing as. It's very disheartening.
---
You need me to be your brain? I use Distortion or hide in a locker so the killer can't pop my gen from BBQ. If i know the killer has pop then theres no reason to work on a gen where someone is getting chased and probably going down. Ive been getting Pop on every killer i play against and Ive pretty effectively strategized not getting every gen constantly popped by playing like an idiot and getting downed by 90% gens. Its a good perk it can be used well or not work at all for the killer if you play against or you can be an idiot that doesn't play against pop and keep working on 1 gen and getting that gen constantly popped because everyone goes back to the same gen and dies and lets the gen get popped twice. I can't think for you but if you know the killers perks you can always find a way to counter it by not letting them get the most effect from their perk. Thats why you hide in lockers against BBQ works good when killer has BBQ and Pop
---
They really pulled something unsalvagable back together in an impressive manner, i commode them for the work.
---
I think there’s just some people that downvote any art they see on this subreddit tbh, thank you though friend!!
---
uh, meow?
---
Thanks🖤
---
yeah im referring to exactly that perk. It's my best perk as a newb right now i think.
---
&gt; Tbh of killers can get free one shots with NoED for essentially not being good enough to stop gen progression then I see no problem with hatches.
---
Killers only get free one shots if survivors allow them to. Killers can't possibly protect dull totems so NOED happening or not is completely on survivors hands.
---
Maybe sonic as is, and the halloween blight horror skin can be pre-patch sonic design.
---
Wow,thank you🖤
---
Wat... Did you even read what he said or you're just that dishonest?
---
Bruh. That’s terrible. Feel bad for your team.
---
I tried it for fun with clown one time, and its real bullshit.
---
Each time i chased a guy, he ran on the other side of the map with sprint burst and the 3 other guy was rushing the same gen during the chase
---
Its unplayable, how can people complain about this ?
---
Yeah at this point it feels like a must-have when Ghostface is one of the more popular Killers right now.  Also in general it's great for telling when a Killer is coming nearby, and it also gives you that 10% bonus to every action which can come in pretty clutch at times with exit gates/totems/gens.
---
Yea its so hard to get kills. Even if you let them complete 5 gens there’s still NoED which even if its cleansed you can just run instadowns next time. I dont want the game to be unwindable for killers throughout the trial and then multiple ways to screw over the entire team once the gates are open. You can make arguments for Adrenaline and Balanced Landing being too strong if youd like but it’s just completely disingenuous to say if they remain the way they are killers have no chance of getting a 4k.
---
Exactly. I have so many useless broken keys, bad maps, and Mist offerings that are terrible for the character I am on. For example survivors lessening the mist or Killers thickening it.
---
If the bloodweb forces you to buy a broken key. You should be able to sell it back for half price. They could even introduce a new character like The Observer. You sell this character items around the campfire and he could be the one who refills the bloodweb. Idk
---
If you can't even get a single gen done before \*all 3\* of your teammates die, you did mess up. It wasn't just your team's fault. NOED is an entire other issue, I agree it's a crutch perk and I personally never use it.
---
I was just about to say something similar. Looks like he's their next target. It worked once for Freddy, will it work a second time?
---
By the way for everyone who is new - the google translation for "Unfun to play against" means "Good enough that I can't easily defeat with my low skills."
---
Low skilled survivor mains don't like killers like that. If at least two of them don't escape per trial"
---
1. The rage quitting tantrums begin. 
---
2. Then the low skilled survivor main devs will make up a lie on their dev streams to tune of "We feel Freddy is over-performing statistics" while nodding their heads at you as if you couldn't see through their bs. 
---
3. Then the devs will make a blog post saying that they have some "great plans" in the works for Freddy to give him "counterplay." They might even claim that it's only his addons being worked on, but it's all a lie and the base is going to messed with.
---
4. And finally the nerf will come.
---
When the nerf comes and you rightfully are outraged, there will be some low skilled survivor mains who will scold you for being upset and will tell you that "it's just the PTB, the changes may not go live", and when the changes go live they'll say nothing else about it.
---
Recognize the signs, and never fall for the banana in the tail pipe tricks.
---
&gt;Interesting perspective. Though in my opinion crows take care of that pretty well, and you'll eventually find them if you're adamant enough.
---
Oh silly child... You've never been in this situation.
---
As a survivor you can move around the map, very slowly and never get crows. Without Whispers on big maps is practically impossible to find someone who's only goal is to hide.
---
playing killer will be the real horror even more
---
More fun for killers, maybe. Solo queue at ranks 8-15 is hell.
---
no when she vaults a window she phases. so you have no idea she vaults until she already has done it
---
Slugging is needed to slow the game down at points. If someone is downed and you are chasing someone else, that's 3 people not doing gens as 1 person needs to come pick up the slugged survivor. This helps greatly, especially if a few gens popped already. Give the killer momentum. Run unbreakable if slugging bothers you that much.
---
What are you on? Just so I can avoid taking any.
---
you dont have to spam it fast, just consistently.  sometimes going too fast can read as holding it instead of multiple presses.
---
Just gotta let it slide right off of you. Besides, it's fine to run weak Killers, just more incentive to run sweaty perks and add-ons.
---
No cosmetics and he's ugly bro. Think about the children bro
---
Some people are straight up braindead. I don't get affected myself but I can understand that for other people isn't like that
---
I guess empathy is really hard to understand. And is a borderline sociopath can understand that and not people like that, there's a problem
---
does this break her? is that what you are trying to say?
---
Not to sound like I'm bragging because I know I'm not, but I've ~150 hours, and it's definitely more than a minor hindrance, as it allows for the Killer to patrol gens more and look for survivors longer than they could without Ruin
---
You come off super angry, you should check your blood pressure.  And “pretend” that I do lol what? Like how you’re pretending that you know I don’t? Lol calm yaself
---
Actually Doctor is getting his add-on looked at, at the very least.
---
I’d love this, but yet another indoor map. :/ If they make it super wide open, tall ceilings, one floor (maybe one small balcony area), that’d be cool. Huntress has been getting screwed by each new map they add, would be nice if they had an indoor map with high ceilings for hatchet throws.
---
Same thing as bill. Someone owns Quentin. I really think bill should get his left 4 dead beta outfits and we should get quentin and freddy cosmetics. I gladly pay double for a Robert England freddy.
---
does my change break her? is that what you are trying to say?
---
Are you kidding me? Freddy is top 5. He’s a great killer now. Hate going against him, but he’s a good killer.
---
I wasn’t being super specific about that build because there’s a few ways to run it but ruin and pop are always the core.  And I agree ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzz that’s what that makes me feel like playing matches as and against it
---
It wasnt a question.
---
The somewhat speedy healing is alright, but I don’t think it’s worth running with BK anymore, which means one less off meta synergy.
---
I used it everyday and like it
---
"Just wanted to make them proud

Leprechaun/Jennifer Aniston
---
Survivor main here. Sent you a friend link via DMs.
---
Thats look like a toxic survivor but the fact u didnt mean it haha
---
The difference is im not calling for any of those things to get nerfed. Nice strawman but maybe next time you want to argue about a topic i hope you arent as dismissive. If you actually want to make the argument that if spirit remains the way she is survivors have no chance of escaping, i would love to hear your points but i expect youll be satisfied by this poor deflection.
---
I did something similar once and the top three were also Claudette meg and nea
---
*iF yoU ReAd tHe whOLe POst* yeah, we read it guy. 
---
I think we ALL can agree this game is something truly special. Same repetitive shit. Same overused perks etc. but we don’t need people coming to reddit complaining about Freddy, who isn’t NEARLY played, as much as Spirit who actually needs a change. Leather face needs it drastically.   Not every killer is meant to be played the same.  If you wanna slow down the game, cool grab Freddy. You want to be spooky?  Play GF, Pig or Michael. You wanna be brain dead? Play Spirit.   Freddys rework is great compared to what he was.  And it’s funny because he isn’t the only killer who has map pressure. I.E Billy, Spirit, a good Hag. 
---
And please, don’t bring up **crutch** perks. When they’re just helpful in a bind. I’m sorry but I’m not going to wait 20 minutes to queue in a game for it to end in 5 minutes..
---
and walls, dont forget walls
---
Exactly
---
Yeah, that would be awesome. I love Hawkins lab, but I can def see that being annoying as Huntress. But yeah I def see a mall as not being claustrophobic, with real high ceilings. Like an outdoor map indoors.
---
I forgot to add: the perk Infectious Fright is scary on Myers, esp if you have dead rabbit. When you down someone, anyone in your terror radius screams, showing their aura for 6 secs. And has no cooldown. Which means when you're in tier3 and have a huge terror radius, you can quickly chain downs.
---
I'm just wondering what perk icons you use because they look really cool.
---
Being forced into a perk for counterplay isn’t fun
---
Just slug the third guy and find the fourth to prevent that
---
Surprised so few people play ace. He has some of the most bling cosmetics and also built in iron will
---
What else should they do while a survivor is being chased? Watch?
---
and friendly ghost flashlights
---
It's what Leatherfaces do.
---
The last man standing :(
---
Right?! I think it would be amazing. Run the Scoops Ahoy skin, get that roleplay goin.
---
keep on dreamin, son
---
I believe he was having issues with a good internet connection where he lives and is moving
---
I would 100% be down for a game mode where no one got to run perks. Or maybe only 1-2 perks.
---
I think collision makes her base kit B tier instead of C/D tier, seriously. Her add-on make her good, but that is the story for most killers, though.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong. I would like to hear opinions.
---
You speak true words. However if they buff the Demogorgon much I think I’ll lose my mind. I already get shit on at T-L walls and Shack
---
I personally did it as a begginer because thwy haf gates open and i finaly caught one of the swf. And i was too scared to let him go. But this was my first time getting someone on hook. That guy has spent money on the game and still does this. Also. Insidious basement camping is allowed.
---
Guys, he’s not saying Freddy needs nerfed. He’s just pointing out that it’s boring, and gets old when it’s every. damn. Freddy. 
---
And he’s right. 100%.
---
The Aftermath skins on the L4D2 workshop looks amazing.
---
I normally carry to hatch, close hatch, then make them open gates, then I down them and drop them at exit and make them crawl out..... like yea I’ll let them live but I want them to think I won’t
---
I don’t know about all that.  But it’s alright for sure
---
Blackface Cannibal like CNN btfo

Ps4 really need it. All red ping make us leave this game for awhile. Please release in ps4
---
It's a joke
---
and floors!
---
I dont smash as dast as I can as I can. It press it a solid rate just like wiggling. The difference.
---
The differences wiggling doesnt stop.
---
Also no very fast pressing cant be holding unless you dont let the key reset completely and it's not a game thing thing is your fault. My macro does it a couple hundred times a second and keeps me alive.
---
Nah. Its cause we over estimate the killer and we think he knows where we are still. I get hit and hooked a lot because I dont under estimate killers enough. I think surely they will atleast know to do this or that so I try to do the opposite and it bites me in the butt.
---
Here comes the true face of dbd reddit.  Let me drop a little fact for you, Freddy is currently one of the most played killers according to the most recent dev stream.  Your post has nothing of value in it.  You basically projected your own frustrations onto a killer that you can’t handle in general without reading my full post.  “wE rEaD iT gUy” sure you did... that’s why your post doesn’t reference nearly anything I talked about minus the word Freddy.
---
Still doesn't change anything if you punish for DCing. 
---
Let's say a DC awards the offending player with a half hour ban. Cool. Problem solved, right? Not even close. Instead of DCing, the player will suicide on the hook to get out of the match faster. What did you even achieve at this point by making the change to punish disconnecting?
---
Well it makes sense if the gates are open because otherwise you’re basically just walking away and allowing survivors a freebie to unhook their buddy and risking not securing the kill but other times it’s just not a good strategy.
---
If it was balanced and fun UPVOTE UPVOTE UPVOTE
---
This channel is great, love the commentary mixed in at key... moments. Plus has a lot of usefull info.
---
I honestly don’t want them to change killer. And that’s coming from a person who plays 99% survivor
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dvli4q/when_is_withering_blight_ending/
---
yes he will return! ha ha!
---
Impossible, this game is too perfect and has no flaws what so ever😤😠😤 and I’m also a console player
---
im trying to make her fair and balanced here! phasing through floors would be too OP
---
sometimes when i down a toxic survivor about to get hatch, I pick them up and drop them about 10 meters from the hatch to assert dominance
---
Clown is a straight up lie. I’ve encountered him once. And oinkers at least 10 times
---
If someone dc's early or I absolutely roll a team, I'd give the last person hatch, but if I have to work my ass off to 4k and it was a close game, I feel like I deserved the 4k so I don't. I also don't give the hatch to P3 Immersed Blendettes
---
Sigh... jokes aside, my point was not actually that survivors had no chance of escape, my point was just to make fun of you calling Dead by Daylight a horror game so survivors are “supposed to feel helpless.” It’s hard to make someone feel helpless  and not frustrated when it’s supposed to be a balanced game.
---
The main point of playing your role in this game is just choosing how you want to play. It’s not about if you want to be scared.
---
Anyway, just some things I hate:
---
 • Prayer beads. Just... prayer beads.
---
 • Standing still for a chance at catching a survivor for a free hook (skill btw)

 • Wakizashi Saya, although not mentioned much, is seriously busted. The lunge is seriously bonkers. You could just M1 with Spirit, and only phasewalk to get the post-phasewalk boost, and it’s still absolutely insane. I guarantee that if you land within ~15m of a Survivor with nothing in the way with this addon, you are basically guaranteed a hit if you’re not a potato.
---
sad boi trapper :(
---
real talk though buff trapper already
---
100% why you don't ever get the hatch, and rightfully so lmao
---
I either overestimate their abilities way to much or they are playing elite level mind games on me and I'm actually underestimating their 4d chess maneuvers.

Gen rushing, otherwise known as survivor gameplay

Thank you friend!
---
Tunneling, otherwise known as killer gameplay
---
That happened to me too
---
anyways when will BHVR give us speedo Quentin?????
---
I never said you didn't. I just said I got tunneled.
---
I dont know. All i know is i need it
---
Only character I bothered prestiging on console bc no cosmetics.
---
Not only that but the alchemist mentions specifically he would do anything for a putrid flower and to escape the void. He says he would rip survivor or killer apart limb from limb. This guy isnt trying to research anymore. Hes being consumed by the serum like an addiction. Hes nothing more than a educated fiend now and he cant help anyone in the fog like vigo was doing.
---
Jesus mains rise up
---
Sounds like it's time to 
---
1) buff the shit out of the other killers and...
---
2) buff the shit out of the many useless survivor perks.
---
And id wager he hasnt changed much since that outcry. See what happens when you dont give in to people crying for nerfs immediately, it forces them to learn how to play against it or keep losing to it. Now the doctor is B tier at best, not through nerfs but through simple experimentation and knowledge. Its hard to learn how to deal with something if you die once to it, DC and cry for a nerf. I hope the doctor can share how he avoided the nerf hammer with the other killers that this sub is constantly crying about.
---
I was going to reply to your comment, but wasn't at home and didn't feel like typing a whole thing on mobile. Now I forgot what I wanted to say. I'll probably remember at some point and reply then I guess. Also, it's spelled Marley lol
---
I agree COMPLETELY with all that's being said, DBD has so much potential but I feel like just hitting skill checks on gens gets so repetitive and monotonous.
---
how else will I counter the toxic genrushers!?
---
Oh no I have flasbacks of vietnam and legion... Oh legion you was so much fun to play now you dont have legs
---
Makes sense thanks
---
What platform? Played Hag a lot the past few days. Often let last guy go.
---
why not?
---
The petals offering gives 1k additional points on the hooks marked yellow and 3k if YOU brought the offering up to a maximum of 6 hooks.
---
You need to go into the AppStore and you have to change your region in App Store to Sweden
---
Priority 1: Perks, take the best one you can, or if you dont care for either whichever one will allow the entity to claim the most nodes. The sooner you get them out of the pool offered to you, the less bloodpoints you have to waste getting new bloodwebs.
---
Priority 2: good add-ons/items.  If you see any add-ons your killer really loves to use (ie Trapper bags for trapper, Stalk power for Myers, ect.) get them, even if it stops the entity from taking more nodes. Same thing goes for good survivor items (Commodious Toolboxes, Med kits, red/purple keys, flashlights if your good with them) and good addons (styptics, medkit charges, toolbox repair speed/charges)
---
Priority 3: in this order - Bloody Party Streamers or Black/White Wards, Survivor Pudding/Escape Cakes, Favorable maps for killers
---
Priority 4: Other offerings/addons you dont want to use.  Try to get the Entity to take as many as possible without losing anything from the higher prioritys.  Most single category offerings barely give you the return on your investments.  Fogs tend to be useless outside of specific, chance, circumstances (useless on some maps, may make stealth killers stronger if stacked, and little effect if not stacked).  Luck offerings are gimmicks at best, same with shrouds and hook offerings.  You will gain enough of them by chance as you level up. 
---
Coins are hard to place.  For survivor they can be useful.  Plunder builds really want coins, but you don't need many, as full plunderer builds aren't great to run constantly.  Cut and Scratched coins are traps outside of meme builds (try playing insidious leatherface with cut coin, and just stand by the chest, not hurting anyone unless they touch it)
---
Literally all the splinters I get are for killers I already own. Never get Plague, Clown, or Legion splinters.
---
Keys, swf, toolboxes, flashlights, 4 neas, four claudettes, people to good that is painful etc
---
My deal is I try to think a smart killer would just go this way and get me so I will go this way instead and it turns out I mind gamed myself. Or the killer is really good with mind games or I'm trying to mind game a unsafe area.
---
Laggy killer
---
with the nerfs and all..... it's no wonder
---
For real. I guess they only chose to ask about things they had some intention of looking at changing.
---
Oh well. There's other games out there, I guess.
---
double hooked everyone, maxed brutality (through slugging ig) hunter is ez, and got a lot of uncloak hits
---
I wouldn't want  cross play for console. As a console player I feel there is still many many issue BHVR ignored with console since their main focus is PC console still have issues with frame rate, sensitivity and connection since many are wifi players. I think if they're gonna do it they really need to optimize console.
---
I’m just so confused how he stabs people with it
---
Doesnt make a difference anyways. I intentionally kept myself between rank 12-9 this whole season and I still frequently fight killers between 5-1.
---
(Console with average que time of 1-2 minutes during nighttime play)
---
That only happens if the survivors are absolute idiots. If they play right they could easily escape a leatherface. Also by "not being fun" I don't agree, because it really isn't fun to play against loopers and such, but it's part of the mechanic of the game. If they want out just die on the hook. What's the point of DC when being carried to the hook, or on the hook itself? They weren't saving time. They were being shitty.
---
I think they could stand to give her a secondary power, so that way she isn't powerless in certain maps. No idea what it would be but it would definitely help round her out
---
Lol yeah that happens, bigbrain survivors. Oh someone else will get him.. anyyyyy dayyy now. Oh he's past 50% well now someone *has* to get him so it's fine if I'm chilling on the other side of the map. *Survivor dies thanks to useless teammates*
---
Thanks for being thorough!
---
from my experience as killer if I can tell they’re in a swf and I’m chasing one of the better ranked players, I’ll just move on to a different survivor. if I manage to kill those 2 rank 20s quickly, there’s only so much the 2 red ranks can do
---
Until they re-work the prestige system, it isn't worth it anymore. It used to arguably be worth it, but with better cosmetics available, prestige is not worth it.
---
what kind of black magic are you using
---
I love my quentin cosmetics!! They didnt even cost a single auric cell!!
---
This and the game are 2 maps I typically DC on as killer
---
Did you buy the dlc packs or the killers with cells/shards? I have read that killers purchased in the in game store as opposed to through dlc can still generate shards.
---
“What was the point you were going to send hate mail if I didn’t” you don’t think assumptions like that are rude or your skull is just that fucking thick?
---
Too bad in Japan people work hella overtime here, not to make that sweet, sweet yen, but to look good in front of their boss/coworkers as a fellow suffering member of the team. 
---
Homeboy ain’t admirable
---
I will make petition to that when u do 3p on meg u get bloody hat bc that's what need a real megHEAD
---
Since there's one gen left, my guess is that this lf got ran around for a while and then decided to facecamp
---
cause those don't exist
---
I’ve bought them through the Xbox marketplace as well as straight from the store with cells.
---
That sucks.
---
It wasn't working when it was "average" it took off the lowest. Or at least it did every time I played lmao.
---
During loading you don’t; it goes back into inventory.
---
consistently in green ranks. maybe in part to the occasional yellow rank teammate that leads to a yellow rank killer with minimal skill, but it gets rough out there.
---
the other green rank teammates try to help lol but it never goes as planned. they usually sought, proceed to face camp me and then face camp them as well.
---
Same
---
I mean, killers have "proxy camped" (term is dumb but only way I can convey to this sub) but an actual face camp was only 1 time.
---
Reminds me of how I was playing against a Spirit with Prayer Beads a few days ago and she let me go because the rest of my SWF DC’d after I told them she had Prayer Beads lol
---
i still depipped
---
plague i understand, but the rest? first time i hear of this.
---
You have BL, windows, DS, and a toxic bright shirt. Why do I feel like you brought the killer to this map knowing damn well that Haddomfield is broken and easily the best map for your perks?
---
To be honest people can say they never DC all they want, but you can't tell who's genuine. 
---
A lot of people will always have an unless. I never DC *unless* the killer tunnels/camps/etc. It's a problem that will hopefully be improved by adding punishments for DC'ing like every other game ever.
---
Yeah, nobody wants to start close but the killer wants them to be best buds. I think Vigos shroud is really the way to go tho ngl
---
si you not know how to screenshot?
---
yeah I remember swfs were skewed to have rank 20 killers at one point which was rly unfair, hence why I said that I thought devs were just too lazy to get it to work correctly
---
Man, there's a bit of misinformation on that page. The "child" depicted in the webcomic that started the pedo rumours isn't actually a child. He's 18. 
---
As far as stealing other's art goes, while a shitty thing to do, if she's not profiting of of it and it's not present in the show, then idk.
---
Agreed, Freddy is the best balanced killer by far. I think it has to do with his power diversity; lullaby confusion, swappable powers that are both good, gen teleport, default slowdown (everyone ends up getting clocks at some point against freddy).
---
If all killers had a passive and a secondary ability it would do wonders for balancing
---
I’m a switch player and we don’t have something called the “archives”? When it does eventually arrive... Is it an event or does it last forever?
---
They probably camp then to secure the kill because in new players that dont know the ranking system facecamping actually hurts them.
---
But you're also right lowkey. Isn't it easier to play on PC ? That just means you will have the upper hand over console players. Then ppl would be crying months later saying how they cant beat these PC killer players hahah
---
How is this the killer facecamping? All I see is your teammate purposely fucking you over
---
Or are pissed off at a survivor that teabags flashlight spans and more
---
I shudder to think how many people I've pushed away from the game.
---
oh, absolutely. face camping guarantees no pip or even a de pip.
---
As of now I only see tinkerror viable for LF. There's been some situations where it works but that's only because I was in close proximity. Other than that it's completely useless, the gen will be completed before you even get there.
---
I am so excited! I want to know where Claudette’s story is going! I’m eager for it. I love it! :)
---
You are if you're better than the survivors your facing.
---
You definitely shouldn't 4k against *good* survivors every game
---
Once again, I never said insta 4ks I said “easier to get 4ks”.  And pop is only seen as a well designed perk because it’s ruin in disguise with a full match duration, and even then, low mobility killers usually can’t get the same effect that hag billy nurse spirit and can get. Not even close.  And that’s the issue with the game as a whole in its current state, too many new perks designed to kill metas has pigeonholed the devs into designing almost every “good” perk around tunneling, gen rushing, and camping.  Barely any players even consider running anything not filling those 3 requirements.
---
Probably the first “nice” ebony mori + noed killer, lol. Whenever I encounter that ‘build’, they usually guarantee the 4K at all costs... plus BM. Plenty of BM.
---
What’s his gamer tag I wanna talk to this poor man
---
The killer has 60 seconds to find a gen to pop. There is a total of 7 generators so a 1 in 7 chance. He'll have at least a gen or two close him when he hooks someone, so he will narrow it down very quickly. When it gets down to 1 or 2 generators he will definitely find one to pop.
---
Busted how? You can track pallets when you're awake, and you can wake up to avoid them. Most people just prioritize windows when up against pallet freddy
---
Strong =/= busted
---
Lol, I have to get him up outta there first. He be a problem at the end
---
I play equally killer and survivor like I said with 1000+ hours that’s at minimum 500 hours on killer more like 700 or 800
---
He doesn't have undetectable, you end up having oblivious (unless a patch changed it and I missed it)
---
Seems 50/50 to me, but I don’t frequent this subreddit. Mostly just watch a variety of DBD content creators, both survivor and killer main alike.
---
our swf would just alternate between giving them two free kills each match this would happen, four red rank survs against a baby demo is just filthy tbh
---
wouldn't mind doctor getting the freddy treatment
---
As someone who played dota, and still am, I always skip post game chat. People just wanna put a blame on someone but themselves. If they don't, it's their fault, and they don't want that.
---
I do but how would I post that easily to the Reddit?
---
Uh fam where have you been since the rework
---
"Spirit always instakills all injured survivors on the map waaaah"
---
You in every thread lol
---
desktop reddit/send it to yourself
---
so this is what sprint burst level 6 looks like
---
that would be fucking busted
---
Yes! This literally just happened to us. We broke a totem at the start that was lit, cleared the other 4 dulls and escaped, only hex totem the trapper had was NOED
---
Don’t forget about my boi Demogorgon in the first paragraph
---
Been thinking of turning off the chat myself for good. Doesn't seem to ever be anything good in the chat.
---
Only reason I never DC is bcuz I hate having my time wasted. Time is most valuable and I simply cant bring myself to quit a match and literally gain nothing from it....I'd rather just at least try to get as many points as I can.
---
You said yourself that ruin is almost necessary at red ranks... even if it’s only to give you 2 minutes to make your first plays.  So how do you remove a perk like that? You can’t without changing gameplay.
---
The game needs more objectives if it wants to stay fun.
---
Rancor roulette!
---
I use it a lot, it is kinda underrated. Not as underrated as wglf tho
---
Well hire a musician to write the music. People do it for free on youtube. Hell, get in contact with the guy who makes the music on youtube get him to do it
---
Scary for your teammates when they need those pallets...
---
Fair enough
---
Yeah no i use it pretty much every game! Its really useful
---
Most games have a good balance. When you hit x amount of DC's within a time period, you get a short ban (10-30 minutes). If this keeps happening, the ban times get progressively longer. That way people who have one or two true DC's don't get punished, or only receive a short ban, while those who abuse the feature get punished heavily. 
---
And honestly if real life is interrupting to the point that you're having to DC enough to get banned, you shouldn't be trying to play online multiplayer in the first place.
---
Nono the old sonic design is going to be a killer!
---
do you have the link to her store?
---
I might be evil but if a game ends really quick ill let the last person downed find the hatch, if they can find it while crawling before bleeding out, but i give them a chance and most of them succeed, so its fun to watch
---
It’s so stupid that legion gets punished for using his ability. if you miss your swing, it’s a stun, and even if you hit the survivor, if he successfully 360’s then he’s suddenly gone because no scratch marks.
---
Just no. Removing motion blur of wraith is a HUGE deal,and would be really strong no matter what drawbacks you add to it. No blur + no bell sound addon = a broken killer who can freely guarantee any hit as long as there is any good tree or wall around. 90% of wraith counter play relies on knowing if he's coming. With this, he can hit someone, then just stand there and wait for them again, because they don't know if you left.
---
Honestly I'm not running into too many deadly Demo's in red at the moment. Now that I've said that I'm sure I will however.
---
I can't DC the shot out of you without getting closer
---
This. The biggest thing that gets under my skin is blatant ignorance with no intention of bettering themselves. An example being that I just can't comprehend how people can take anothers words and twist them so *impossibly* backwards, that it makes absolutely no sense to anyone but themselves, then act like everyone else is idiotic. What's even worse, is that they will use bigger words, and somehow people think that equates to being more correct.
---
I stop bothering with larger words the deeper and more heated an argument gets, because they aren't worth the brain power. I only recent realised that people who can't see the world in anything but black and white (and as such, need literally every sentence I type explained through a paragraph) aren't even worth my surface level brain power, so I just respond with whatever generally gets my point across. And then I keep copy and pasting the same response until they either get it, or stop responding.
---
This is a great idea wow
---
idk if people like Demi but i'll just leave this here and maybe people will change their minds..
---
[https://youtu.be/9WcMxkAWwX0](https://youtu.be/9WcMxkAWwX0)
---
I don't know how many pallets I've lost trying to heal someone under a pallet
---
Lmao give him reward im to poor
---
So for me (PS4) furtive chase costs 2700 shards. I assume it's a glitch?
---
Is that the case? Benedictus means "spoken-well-of" in Latin, and is typically translated "blessed."
---
Blue Hair Feng here. Get hatch a decent amount. Probably because my outfit is cute as hell and I play fair.
---
[Me seeing this Shrine like...](https://youtu.be/4GE7sNFx3JE?t=8)
---
But hey at least Enduring's on the Shrine for the 40th time. :)
---
I don't even use ruin anymore because I only have it for 30s into the game, i just use pop you get more value out of it.
---
that’s what I’m saying tbh, if he hated it so much he could just turn off messages from non-friends on PS4 easy
---
What?! Why does it take that long for a game?
---
I need more Claudette lore NOW bhvr :(
---
I have gotten from a new rank 18 to a rank like 9 and now I main killer because it’s so fun to play.  the big boi also called the wraith basic
---
Yeah, memento mori is latin. It basically means YOLO
---
just do bones lol
---
I put up a Hawkins offering randomly while I was playing Steve and facing a bunch of trappers and spirits all day and got a huntress, her power is not great either on that map and she would’ve probably 4ked instead of 1ked me and the randoms on another map.
---
 It’s okay though because she pulled off a cool hatchet as I was just a couple feet away from the exit and we both GG’ed each other because it was epic
---
I don't complain about Spirit as much as I see on here. But Spirit has gotten PLENTY of hate since I started playing over a year ago. I don't know why people are acting like she just started after the nurse nerf. That's simply untrue.
---
Never have, never will. Patiently awaiting the day they finally add real penalties for DC’s, since some seem to think the lack of punishment makes it an acceptable tactic
---
That’s... what he said?
---
The internet connection is too good and that's why he's leaving?
---
I think so too, makes it a little creepier and it becomes more apparent that you are in some kind of pocket dimension created by the entity
---
I see significantly less posts where people complain against spirit than I see people complaining about posts complaining about spirit.
---
Why didn't she just wait. My heart. My soul.
---
Bill doesn't have any other outfits possible, maybe one with his jacket off. But in the L4D games there isn't another model of him, just that one so probably none for him.
---
I swore I never would during the first two months I started playing. I still never do and never will as Survivor. But once I learned that survivors lose points when I DC as killer I now do it occasionally. I do it whenever they decide to be toxic, the first time during a match that somebody teabags on the other side of a pallet, immediate DC. If they teabag at the exit gates, immediate DC. Up to that point I've had some fun so it's not wasting my time but I'm going to do whatever little thing I can to punish people for being obnoxious assholes. I've gotten to the point where I have pretty much all characters leveled up to where I want them so I'm not worried about losing any BP's that I might have earned by finishing the match.

More like freddy teleport and reverse huntress
---
It goes faster but each person has an individually reduced speed. 
---
Alone, you repair at 100% speed
---
but when another person joins you get a collective 20% penalty for both, 10% for each one that joins.
---
1 doing a gen: 100%
---
2 doing a gen 80% each: 160%
---
3 doing a gen 70% each: 210%
---
4 doing a gen 60% each: 240%
---
Please rephrase this post aside from 'stupid and proving nothing'. It's rude and uncivil and you can't force your opinion on top of others.
---
Incorrect. That's doing the objective.
---
Genrushing: at least two survivors bringing BNP OR commodious toolboxes with both repair speed add-ons, ignoring other people dying just to get the gens done as quickly as possible
---
It's not just this sub dude. It's reddit. If you go deeper you can even see the same people saying two different things. I've seen it plenty of times. One day they say "Spirit is op" the next day they say "She's balanced" It's all about the thread and the circle jerk. People care so much about upvotes lol
---
Wow any reason why? Finally a benefit to console yay!
---
WTF i literally just unlocked Enduring on Billy, oh well i dont got any shards anyways
---
think it’s u. i just finished a game
---
drawback - A directional sound saying "Ho ho ho its me,  Ojomo!" up to 32 meters
---
please never say squadette again that's disgusting
---
because the game's kinda dead
---
Were you just wrecked by a demo? Cause I was.
---
Dang what a bummer, thanks tho
---
Agreeing with smallfrenchone, I get error codes all the time and it seems to always fix just by restarting my game or validating the game files.
---
Respect Doc.
---
Well 18 is still the teen years, technically.
---
Archives is a new section of the main menu that contains The Rift and Tomes.
---
The Rift is a battlepass like system where you get cosmetic rewards by leveling it up, it stays for a limited time and then gets replaced by a new rift with new rewards when the previous one is done. Additionally, the Rift has a free and premium version, the premium version costs 1000 auric cells, but returns that sum back too you so you can purchase the next rift for free.
---
Tomes are challenges that, iirc, stay forever. The challenges help you level up the current Rift it is released with, give you new lore, bloodpoints, Rift Shards, and cinematics.
---
I answered the same as you. I’m not sure about your reasoning, but for me I care a lot about game balance, as it’s one of the deciding factors on whether a game is fun. Having cross play may sound good, but console players simply cannot play as optimally as PC players for hardware reasons. I’m not insulting console players, I’m sure that it requires a ton of skill to do well on console. However, if I’m playing survivor with 3 console players against a PC killer, the truth is that our team is almost guaranteed to die. Other way round is the same. Consoles can’t move as fast as a mouse. It’s extremely easy to 360 someone who can’t follow your movements.
---
Exactly. Waiting year to year for flowers must be maddening
---
This would definitely be interesting. I don't see why adding something like a thumbs up type emote would be a bad idea
---
It bypasses all killer stealth abilities, and is especially useful for chases where you can’t see the killer and need to know which side of a loop he’s coming from, when you’re on a generator and don’t know where the killer is, when you need the perfect time to get an unhook when the killer is nearby. It basically tells you when you’re safe, and when it lights up, you know to get out of dodge. There are many more uses for it that hopefully some other people reply to this with, it’s so versatile. Watch PainReliever survivor gameplays on YouTube
---
Isn’t the max score 36k
---
Because their knobs who have this belief that all PC players are god-like just because they can use keyboard and mouse. I'm all for cross-play also as it would increase the player pool.
---
I love it, but the pacing on the narration is so weird, I have to read and not listen.
---
This is kinda cool, but I don’t think the clip needed to be so long. Nothing happens for the first 20 seconds.
---
I'm solo queuing?
---
He finally got dem moves
---
Good question ahaha
---
Havent hears of the entity one but definitely on the call outs dude!! Like, there are so many times where he'll call out a cross map trap pretty much exactly on time...it's incredible.
---
Plus he's the least toxic person in the whole community.
---
I dc. I try not to. Even if im losing on either side most the time im a good sport. Its when the other side just is out to make my life miserable. If you face camp and tunnel me as a prayer bead spirit, im out. If youre sweaty swf death squad is teabagging me and chain blinding me, im out. I dont try not to dc out of courtesy for the other side but if you’re not gunna respect me im not respecting you and i have no problem just leaving the game and moving on to the next one. You have the right to play however you want but if your being an ass dont be surprised when i dont wanna continue playing with you.
---
You casually forgot that the lesbian couple is portrayed as "the good guys" and the main character of the whole show, which is shown in a near non-stop relateable and positive light, is a lesbian. Also, in the pilot there is a homophobic character which is unequivocally and undoubtedly explicitly referred to as evil.

Part of the entire point is that everyone in hell is a bad person aside from the main character. It handles that kind of message in a somewhat edgy manner but that doesn't reflect on the creator especially due to the way it portrays the actions of the denizens of hell, which is with proper irreverence.
---
Learn to spell friend it's "literally" And I'm not throwing out any "repressed anger" I am just calling it how I see it. Oh and that " boy getting fucked" Is 18 canonically because the fucking person who drew it, fucking said so. A concept I know and on that same point WHO THE FUCK CARES? Its a work of fiction representing LITERALLY HELL itself. People like you are probably what is responsible for the dark age that set humanity back a 1000 years in technological advancement. Thank fucking god most people have wised up to the bullshit you and your kind spew constantly. Do us all a favor and kindly remove yourself from this planet.
---
Nice flair
---
Yeah, it wouldn't clutter controls, at least on console as only half of the d-pad is used for emotes currently, and it would definitely help with communication without a microphone. The only downside would be the added size or maybe taking time away from the animators but those are minor issues and I, at least, would be fine if some "Good Job" emote and/or another was just a pet project.
---
I'm off tomorrow let's play
---
Please take your time to explain how to beat spirit so it doesn't rely on a coin flip
---
I mean if you are getting looped from pallet to pallet then you are doing something wrong
---
It was on PS4 just a couple minutes before posting this
---
who the fuck pissed in your cereal u keep going like this and a mod is gonna tell u to stop
---
Maps leave something to be desired. But the killer designs are really special. Lesser teams would have pumped out a ton of more generic shit by now.
---
This is also a very good point!
---
Devs : No. We need to increase DLC sales. Look at this chart showing how many players bought Bubba DLC for BBQ and Chili📈
---
Tru3 recently popularized the No Stalking Ghostface build where you use your power purely for its Undetectable status to get hits, so people are leaning towards that way to play him. You can play him as a stalker just as well, so its up to you how you want to play him.
---
I recommend watching Otzdarva's "comparison" videos: [Stalker Ghostface](https://youtu.be/l-S27H27Xy8) and [No Stalk Ghostface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He-PltRCDTU). However he does end up stalking a lot out of habit in the non stalking one, so check out a tru3 video as well (I dont watch him so I cant recommend any of his)
---
Otz replaced Ruin with Corrupt Intervention in Tru3's build, but Ill give you the run down on who has the the perks.
---
Ruin: Hag teachable, very important to get if you dont have it.
---
Corrupt Intervention: Plague, swappable with Ruin but not as strong imo. I would get it if you can, but its not as important as Ruin
---
Thantaphobia and Nurse's Calling: Nurse, these are for non-stalk, so I would level up nurse after hag to get these if you want to play that way. Nurse's is also good for stalker, since you can possibly find people healing others and expose everybody participating.
---
Sloppy Butcher: non teachable, you'll get it anyways
---
Surveillance: Pig teachable, important for stalker ghostface. Id get this ASAP if you can, probably easier to get from the shrine if you dont have Pig.
---
Surge: Demo, Otz uses this in conjunction with Surveillance since it hits all the gens around and activated Surveillance's ability. Lets you know when survivors are working on any of those affected gens. Dont use this if you dont have surveillance.
---
My personal recommendations for perks for stalker:
---
Discordance: Legion teachable, A more accessible version Surveillance since it is from a character you can buy with shards and it can be used in its place until you get surveillance. Lets you know when theres several people to stalk at once on a gens. 
---
Whispers: great for stalking ghostface, I dont use it, but it helps you find people very easily and preemptively plan your pathing
---
Pop goes the weasel: Clown, very important perk for higher rank play. Its something you use on either build to delay the game a ton, as it instantly reduced a kicked gen by 25% after hooking.
---
Might be or the confirmation bias, I just see lots more every time I look it up new posts
---
If I was playing killer and saw all but one survivor DC I would have mercy on the lone one as well haha. Sucks that you depipped because of it though
---
A bad one
---
It’s not that you get looped for several pallets, it’s that you have to break *so many* pallets between all chases that it’s just annoying. I easily prefer the pre-rework version of it
---
Not sure what the issue was but I’m back on now :)
---
The power of Rochelle's T-shirt was too much for The Doctor
---
Most of the time when it’s a long game, I give last survivor hatch. There’s no real reason, just feel like they deserve it for playing for so long and surviving
---
I casually forgot the lesbian couple which is in hell solely because theyre gay, the sin they comitted is that theyre gay, one of them being hysterical most of the time, noting that she is a woman of color, woc being hysterical is totally not a stereotype and hating as well as having a distrust for men because thats totally not a harmful stereotype for lesbians. The homiphobic villain, i take youre referring to the reporter, is simply homophobic, i appreciate you not being absolutely mad like other people in my replies btw but saying something is okay because "its supposed to be racist its supposed to be homophobic" is a defense thats not a defense tbh, theres corrupt worldbuilding thats done well, mathe cyberpunk genre has nailed that one i think because its pprttrayed as an unfair system that hurts people and theres edgy 12 year old redditor world building in which people are just shitty because hell thats it deal with it
---
That looks more like seven minutes with someone that has a weird ass kink.
---
Green rank Killer on PS4? I wonder if one the 6 (six) total Ashes was me lmao. 
---
This is interesting though. I almost never see Kate but she seems to be pretty popular. I should do this as well and see if there's a difference.
---
All too accurate for a night out.
---
And he’s dead in L4D so even if valve ever learns to count to 3, Bill won’t get anything
---
If people knew Google exists
---
Plus if create odd drawings should be seen as immoral, you never actually used internet in your whole life
---
🎶It's all about the game, how you play it🎶
---
Much like TF2s metal system no?
---
Friend: "You better be doing gens, I've been distracting him for a while now"
---
Me: "Dang, I've never realized how detailed the temple is"
---
The game costs $10 more ($20 vs $30), the chapter is $6.99
---
Its pretty ridiculous. Like at what point does the survivor have to accept that they lost. Oh all my teammates died without doing a single gen but hey theres still hatch. Shit he closed the hatch guess ill try to male it to a gate. Oh unlucky the gates are pretty close together guess ill try to plunder a key. Like dude you shouldnt have 3 chances of still winning after youve done 0% of your objective thats just absurd. Im sure someones gunna bring up noed, which i believe should be nerfed however 1. It is a perk you have to bring and give up a slot for where the hatch is built into the game 2. You can cleanse the totem once you know the killer has noed 3. You can cleanse all the totems before the end game to just nullify it completely
---
"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind"

Have at it!
---
Gonna have to agree with you on Wraith. It's between him and Trapper for me, just because their is nothing so satisfying in this game as catching as survivor in a trap.
---
I'm a Jesus main, and this made me sad. :(
---
looks like the rob zombie myers
---
Looping as well
---
The same could be said for the person who I was replying to. I would however encourage you to go and count each set of those types of posts within the last week. I’m curious which of us is showing blatant confirmation bias but not curious enough to find out myself.
---
But if it's survivor Eggman, we can put in the Sonic.exe chase scene!

Thanks!

my keyboard is covering the screen im on mobile have mercy oh master of moral high ground, could you refrain from throwing out capslock all the time its kinda obnoxious, why do you keep referring to "my kind" and "people like you" you act like im a different species its the internet chill for a goddamn second, wits literally just the internet and you tell me to kill myself because i dont like your googoo gaga cartoon yet i am the bad person, god, youre blaming me for hindering techomological advancement for mot liking your cartoon, youre literally hysterical, what kinda bitter incels are dispersed throughout reddit, look do me a favour and gain a brain little snowflake because the world will not bow down to your special special needs you puny incel, youre delusional hysterical, you say youre not angry yet you tell me to kill myself and that"my kind" (people who dont approve of childporn) has set back humanity and you want me to take you seriously like 😂🤚👌
---
Before I see anyone complaining...
---
Take a second to look around as survivor: gets downed and hooked 
---
Looks around as killer: gen pops 
---
It ain't an easy world for both sides
---
Kindred trumps all stealth abilities..
---
Thanks fellow susie main. ☆
---
You guys are missing the point. Like in my case, me and my brother are both pretty good (atm I’m rank 5,) and we like to play with my wife and my best friend (both around 19). We don’t look to bully anyone, just have fun together...but if they get bullied by much better killers it’s not a fun match for them. They got matched with someone who should’ve been chasing me at my skill level. It leads to them not playing as much. You see the problem? I play killer as well, and if I recognize a baby survivor, I’ll hook them a couple of times but i won’t finish them off. They need to be having good experiences to keep coming back. Just my thoughts on it anyway
---
What were the stats taken from ?
---
Ah, okay. That works really well.
---
Love itt
---
Yeah pretty similar to that. Maybe not have a monetizing ability but if so eh, I’d take that over nothing. I hate having so many offerings I don’t want.
---
yes it is if you don’t have hex ruin or any perks like it. sadly we live in a world where people love to hear rappers talk about money corners and females and how they could take ya girls but let someone say they got. a 4k and everyone so salty

i saw the tweets of her saying blackface is an opinion in correlation to blaire white doing blackface, i saw thedrawing of the guy getting fucked by a snake, with homophobic movements it was referring to two youtubers she praised for their "controversial opinions" and when someone told her that those ytbers were ableist, made fun of nonbinary identities etc she told them that she didn't "cater to you" refering to the person who had concerns of her supporting said youtubers but please tell me the truth with your words then :/

Hi satan

I rarely get that of losing problem thanks to my main.

Well 13 just has limited design
---
I got 2 scratched mirrors and haven’t gotten a single once since
---
i don't, or at least i have yet to, but some people really make me want to
---
The way it was explained to me was it's a hours thing (so long as you're trying to get better and whatnot). A friend of mine can consistently loop rank 1 killers with 2k+ hours for 5 gens, so I felt like hot garbage playing with him since I usually panic instead of thinking clearly during a chase and end it way sooner than I could have even though I have 1k hours and feel like I should be a lot better than I am by now. The guy explains (in a nice way) that he has like 6k hours and is familiar with essentially every aspect of the game and that 1k hours is hardly testing the waters when it comes to nailing loops and outsmarting killers. Oddly, it makes me more comfortable with where I'm at and I've felt much less self-conscious about my gameplay compared to where I want to be at.
---
give up chase if they go to a god loop you can still find another survivor
---
I like a lot of these but for the love of god dont make wraith faster. For some reason I can never outrun that fucker.
---
I think nerfing strong killers is ok, because devs should buff all killers after that
---
plenty of killers complain about meta perks that survivors run
---
Constructive argument i see lol. How? Keep in mind perks like Iron Will and such do not count as "counter play".  A good spirit will not be affected by these perks? Why? Because they will phase out as soon as they lost your trail, and easily be close enough to chase and capture you before you can do anything.
---
I drop my item to them or just run around happily

I mean I've played for over a year and still can't watch Clowns and cringe(in a frightened way) at some of the others

It's called make up. It works wonders.

That's kinda what very heavy makeup does, yea.
---
I think it's easily the best perk. But had to feed millions of blood points into Tapp to get it.
---
Yo PM the other streamer you’re talking about
---
Radio demon is my spirit animal
---
When you play with friends, matchmaking finds killer by highest rank. That's how you can encounter rank 20 in high rank lobbies
---
You can remap your controls, for me things like gen repairs and healing are on RT/R2 and window vaults, pallets, etc. is on Lb/L1.
---
No. Whenever a perk is one the shrine for the first time it cost 2700
---
Mist survs don't give a damn about the killer experience. Especially higher ranks.
---
I mean.. Blair white is a piece of shit who deserves all the hate possible
---
About the movement thing I will look it up since I don't know and seems interesting. Especially when her current work actually promotes diversity and promote LGBT movement, which is really good. plus I've seen she has apologized and it might've been because she changed position on certain things. This is just speculation on what I did read and saw in her recent work since I had no idea who she was few days ago
---
I'd like to know which YouTubers she supported and when it happened to look it up what also happened next. As far as I know there was an allegation which throw shit on her due to a drawing used to someone unrelated to her and picked few things she said and extrapolated a worse take than the original
---
As I said, sounds weird for the message she try to communicate with hazbin hotel for example, which is inclusivity and acceptance. More left leaning with the ideology, that's what I saw but I'll be glad to be corrected if I missed some key info. Still, so far as long someone support LGBT, it's ok for me (unlike that shitty Blair white that shit on trans people all the time)
---
I really appreciated that, it’s a small thing but it meant a lot.
---
furtive fucking chase lmfao
---
Susie tries to avoid killing you but trips and the knife lands in your chest
---
It's not stated or implied anywhere that Vaggie is in hell because she is a lesbian. And Charlie is only a denizen of hell due to her birth, which is why she's much kinder and nicer than the other denizens of hell.
---
Im unfamiliar with hysteria being a stereotype of women of colour. But I cannot think of any examples where Vaggie is hysterical or uncharacteristically emotional. Her being afraid of men is a valid complaint that bugged me as well however.
---
On the subject of the reporter, she's the way she is because you're meant to hate her. She's the main voice of opposition to the happy hotel in the beginning and they portray her as a total prick to try and get the audience on Charlies side. The reporters name is literally Katie *Killjoy*.
---
If you think the world building is poorly written then that's a different conversation. I just don't think that it reflects poorly on vivziepop's beliefs enough to warrant drama of the current scale. Especially since a lot of the allegations are founded on lies by omission.
---
ruin bbq ds and borrowed aren't crutches and you know it
---
Clown or wraith
---
Oh, you want my attention that badly? Fine, I'll make sure you die for your troubles. Thanks.
---
WHOS UGLY NOW HUH
---
the game is one of the most killer sided maps in DBD
---
Take her swimming on the first date.
---
They could just undo all the nerfs that they used to gut the Legion when the entire whiney community was spamming that they're broken.
---
Literally they just needed to remove the infinite mend exploit and make the chase mechanics work right with Deep Wounds. DW staying paused in the entire Terror Radius is shit lol
---
Is there that much hate? I've been playing her a lot the past few days and only got bitched at once.
---
man fuck warner brothers 😩
---
Since you're supposed to throw a pebble that you "created" from things you got on the ground, I had the idea of making it charges depending on the distance you walk in the trial, so it could work against every killer.
---
Does your test are on L3? Why?
---
Frankly, you shouldn't need to use an RNG-based perk in every build just to stand a chance in high ranks. I think ruin should be reworked into something consistent, or at least introduce a perk to *compete* with it.
---
Red rank survivors think it's balanced lol
---
Her Depeche Mode shirt always makes me stick out like a sore thumb, but I can't play matches without representing the L4D gang

me, twice for some reason
---
Neat relic, unfortunately the Ghostface from the movie is separate from the one in the game. They have different licensing rights for whatever reason so they arent even the same person.
---
Extremely important
---
Tests*
---
Can the new development company add content or still stuck in legal limbo? If I recall the original devs were not allowed to do anything other than fix bugs.
---
Wrong. Thats just you only applying pressure on one survivor, which you shouldn’t do especially if you see theyre looping you for a while. As the more time the first survivor loops you the more it costs you (one of the only cases where 3 survivors are on gens). The term Genrushing was born when survivors used to use the old BNP (that insta completed a gen), and only do them without caring for saves
---
trapper just needs some changes otherwise agreed
---
The Quen mains are pleased by this!
---
*stabs*
---
I'm interested too it's just that I take too much time to do my tasks
---
Truetalent has popularized this really effective playstyle.
---
Sloppy Butcher, Thanatophobia, and Nurses Calling to spread the damage around to the team, keep them hurt, waste their time, and slow the game to a crawl.
---
When everyone is injured, its makes him an ever present threat when he can appear without warning for a kill. It allows for juggling of survivors so you don't have to commit to a chase and leave the other three to their own devices. Stab them, break off to spread the damage, or even fake a break off and sneak up for the kill.
---
I personally hope it doesn't get nerfed, but I could see why people aren't thrilled about it.
---
Does that mean nurse is the worst then ? Doctor is hard to master sure, but he's not THAT hard. He is actually one of the strongest killers in the game. Not top tier tho, but still very strong.
---
I'm sorry did you just say to make plague like legion?
---
The cosmetic prices are scary.
---
I think the devs should makw it so Trapper can drop traps like how nightmare drops dream snares
---
Besides being weak, Legion is also incredibly boring since the nerf.
---
Ghost Face was never just one person. He's kinda like The Legion, so it works out for the lore.
---
So you'd need to walk a certain number of steps to gain a pebble? That would be unique. I like it.
---
There's this window on Lery's that's maybe 3 feet from a pallet. I've lost track of the amount of times I've tried to slow vault the window just walking around the map and accidentally thrown down the pallet. I do it like every time.
---
Joker (2019)
---
I see the opposite of this. Killer queues have been getting progressively shorter and shorter because people are abandoning killer
---
Yea hes very over powered but like. I personally think all the killers are good. Not as balanced as they could be but they arent bad. So my next thing was well the harder they are to play then worst they will seem. I've faced against countless of docs that over shock you and forget that you can be hit. Then I get OP docs that use their shock correctly and know what to do lol. It's just my opinion :p
---
How do you encounter Bill on a PS4?
---
Even if I get gen rushed in the first 30 seconds, I refuse to DC. It's so scummy and I hate when people do it to me. I'd rather lose a pip over losing my pride.
---
Leatherface is the worst, even wityh his best addons hes crap
---
Trapper needs a buff to how many traps he can carry and getting out of traps should not be rng
---
Clown, Wraith and Doc are weak but im not sure what you are meant to do with them. Maybe give them there best addons? The problem with them is that another killer has a better version of their power
---
I like guest killers in general. They give the opportunity to pull more people into the game and it is pretty hype seeing them get in. Kinda like seeing a character you want in smash bros. When I first saw the halloween trailer for Myers I thought it was the coolest thing that could happen to the game and here we are now with all these other great movie killers and a lot of original ones too. 
---
Right now though my focus hasn't been on Jason because of the legal disputes but if those work out I would love to see him in. My focus has been on Alien/Predator since Demigorgon got in. I never thought they would do them because they aren't human but once I saw the monster from stranger things I now believe they are a solid possibility. Wouldn't mind anything though new killers are cool in general I just love the hype of guest killers
---
Bad idea...
---
You mught have missed the patch notes from her rework but Hag currently has a 24m terror radius.
---
Finally someone gets it. Nurse wasn't "ruined" she was very slightly changed.
---
Not its kinda a strange build honestly
---
For me, I'd say Wraith, Bubba and Demo are all in pretty rough positions.
---
Killer main here and real killer main 800 plus hours and like.... Pff 10 survivor hours I think.
---
Its a good idea that if you feel its a bait survivor with talent for dodgeing attacks its best to break off And go back to Feb rotation.
---
For me gen rush isn't really a thing my other killer mains think it is. Just my opinion its thier job to do gens and it's our job to outplay em.
---
I was speaking from a killer viewpoint :) I'm a killer main.
---
I guess survivors are just easier at times. Me personally, I think survivor is harder to escape with compared to getting a 3k or 2k as killer, but that's probably because I've never gotten past r10. (potato survivor here!)
---
Ive never seen Umbra, may check her out as it goes.
---
Wow, kinda fucked up for bringing their noob friends against a red rank killer
---
I believe 11am EST
---
Why does freddy have tits wtf
---
They only recently started adding cosmetics for licensed characters so Quenton might get one later on in future, but Bill most likely won't.
---
I like hurting people.
---
Well he will never gift the hatch anymore now :(
---
Honestly I kinda want to see a version where Quentin looks like the meth goblin he is in DBD now. Poor bastard hit every branch of the ugly tree and then the entire tree fell on him. The actor is cute tho and I love this art!!
---
I hate when survivors do that. I used the Mori because I wanted to see the animation, not some cunt who thinks he's good but DCs the second he gets downed.
---
"OMG you used a mori? During event? Sooo toxic!!"
---
That's so unrealistic I wouldn't even believe it if it happened in a movie
---
It's not fun. 
---
A friend of mine got obsessed with it, streamed it and he just dies over and over and over again, getting tilted and lashing out at everybody. 
---
I'd rather watch a gay man fart bloody, shitty cum out his asshole than see another second of this game.
---
I'm curious why people are so interested in cross platform anyway. It just seems console would be at a disadvantage.
---
This this this I had so much more fun completing the challenges and not caring as much about rank or escaping/getting the 4k
---
Quentin looking like a snacc tho👀
---
I knew I saw a lot of Self Care I just didnt know it was that many. Makes me run Nurses a lot.
---
I'm pretty sure the next chapter will have something to do with Spirits father, he'll most likely be an Oni or some kind of Samurai
---
Wraith already keeps undetectable for a few seconds after he uncloaks but 15 seconds is ridiculous lol 
---
The motion blur thing is a cool idea tho definitely
---
I always hated Freddy's the most. It just looks dumb having the survivor inexplicably stand up, do absolutely nothing and then get stabbed. Freaking Fedora-man
---
Ok, moris are great when there’s a new killer and mori to showcase, but fuck your fun if you bring a mori. I’m gonna make the most of it by getting a laugh out of teabagging my teammate while they get murdered. 
---
Moris are fun when it’s tombstone Myers or you do it on death hook tho.
---
They need to fix his meth addiction first, otherwise, who would wanna see that??
---
Basically, what you need to know for Doc is simple.
---
This killer's best build are gen protecting ones.
---
His signature perk Overcharge along with his power is a deadly combo to make sure you can never finish those gens. Apart from finding survivor with your anti stealth power, what you need to know to play him is simply to zap every survivor as much as possible (1 or 2 times is enough most of the1 time) you hit 'em, down 'em, out them on a hook, abuse Overcharge and other gen centered perks you might have and you repeat. And keep in mind that he is one of the best anti noobs of the game.
---
Of course you can use other perks like Pop goes the weasel but with that in mind and overcharge, you should have a good base to use him efficiently.
---
I've seen people risk their lives for a brown toolbox
---
I hope not. We already have one Spirit wielding a katana. It would get pretty boring having two. Kind of like how we already have like six small killers with a small knife
---
Flash stunning is not a good reason honestly? Only time you really even get a shot at it is during the times the killers is locked in animation
---
"Let" would you have been able to stop it? Good job on finishing the gen
---
I had spine chill. I knew he was coming, hence me looking to the right, ready to let go once he rounded the corner.
---
Playing against pc survivors on console would also be a disaster I could only imagine being 360ed an 180ed until I just through my control than got spammed in the newly add after game chat “GG 2 EZ bby killer .. look at those spin moves” 😅
---
pretty much the same, i use ruin but it gets found in under 30 secs, or they’re competent enough to hit the great skill checks. i know ‘gen rush’ technically isn’t a thing, but man is it infuriating when multiple gens get done and you’ve only gotten zero or one hook. i mainly rely on them being over-altruistic and slugging *shrug*
---
Not necessarily. It was what I thought up on the spot so she would actually get to use her power to its fullest potential. Legion don't have a power, Taking a bunch of free points for not Downing anyone.
---
Legion need their power completely removed and rebuilt from the ground up like Freddy. No amount of before Nerf will make them fun to play against
---
Because it would be unfair? That would just make it easier to get to a hook and give the survivor no chance at all to wiggle off
---
She had a better view than I did, I was hoping she’d have a quicker reaction... should’ve known, though, cuz it was made clear that she was a newer player earlier in the match. :P
---
If they touch anything it will be his slowdown addons. Freddy's got the best slowdown in the game and if you combine it with something like Dying Light, Pop or Thana he can basically bring the game to an unrecoverable position for survivors because the gens just go so. fucking. slow. In the hypothetical world that BHVR decides to nerf him they probably will just make his slowdown addons not stack or something. Maybe pill bottle too because that's becoming more popular but I haven't seen survivors catch on and start complaining yet lol.
---
Id say that ubless you think you could have pointed as well in that time youre fine
---
He needs something and that's all I could think of that stays in line with what his power is meant to be and how his character Acts. His power should guarantee a first hit. You usually have to start running before he uncloaked. Hug the wall near a pallet and he'll never get you.
---
Ooft. i play ps4 and came up a against a p3 spirkt that got 5 stack devour hope on the game and moried us all. proceeded to message the spirit saying gg it responds with gg ez git good this at rank 10 survivor
---
I just wish they’d ditch the narrator. He’s so cringe.
---
As long as you don't face camp, I don't see a problem
---
Yeah. I know what you mean. I love playing as her but I don't want to have to use a map offering every time. But I know if I don't use one I will either go to Lerys, the Game, Hawkins, or a corn map.
---
Why's that?
---
I misread it and now I cant stop thinking about how funny itd be if this said “sprite” instead of spirit
---
Pc
---
What about PC?
---
That luck is crazy
---
Be honest, how long does it take to find a match? 5-10minutes?
---
Get good
---
I watched noob3 so much that I just went from rank 16 to rank 4 in 25 days and I don't know how to play stealthy anymore.
---
Same but Nea Karlsson, Nea Karlsson, Nea Karlsson.
---
If you think new BT is better than old BT you clearly didn't play back before the changes
---
15 - 30 mins, not even joking survivor btw
---
Did it happen to you too?
---
\+ I get matched with the same people
---
"it's ok for me.to be toxic because people were toxic to me". 
---
God I see posts like these every few hours from toxic players trying to justify their toxic behaviour by calling other people toxic. 
---
Just stop being toxic. Sometimes you'll get flashlight stunned/tbagged, sometimes you won't, but being toxic to others is just likely to make more survivors toxic towards you.
---
Killers and survivors need to be punished for DCs. Losing a pip isn't enough. Half the people don't care about rank because there's no incentive in raking up. They should add some kind of cosmetic two players who reached a certain rank similar to the charms in Rainbow Six Siege. They should also implement a 30-minute ban for those who purposely disconnect.
---
*confused spirit noises*
---
I'd change out spies from the shadows with whispers, because whispers is kind of fantastic. Excellent tool for knowing where survivors are and are not. Stops you wasting time patrolling gens they 100% aren't at. Change out shadowborn for sloppy butcher.
---
Oof, im sorry to say but you cannot unless you’re using a vpn. Though it’s probably against ToS to use vpn.
---
3am for me. Rough.
---
No problem dude, we'll get there.
---
I'm so excited!
---
I always thought it would be neat that if he decloaks within a certain amount of meters of any survivor they are hit with a random status effect (except for exposed) for 60 seconds and the cool down doesnt start until you escape from the chase.
---
I have the same bug
---
Yeah.. and Europe has to wait until 17pm cet -,-
---
I have today a free day and it sucks to wait just for this which doenst need so unlock at a specific time
---
Wow dude, you really pranked us!!!!!! Fuck off
---
This sub is literally molded by unfunny overused memes. Take a drink of water.
---
Have you been taking data during the rift because people will have been playing claudette a lot because of that which kind of throws things off.
---
Welp I am dead then, Before when the killer is the host I get in a game in like 3 mins, Guess will wait until they fix it.
---
My man
---
Bloody head, bloody body and bloody weapon. It doesn't carry over to cosmetics however, it's only for the base skin.
---
Yeah I start work an hour before it comes out my time so I can't play til about 5pm oof
---
This comic is a lie, no survivor would suggest ruin
---
Onion head vs Claudette. Who will win!?

---
While I think this is mostly true, starting EGC when the hatch opens instead, and reducing the time the survivor has (say, 20 seconds less per gen not done, minimum 30s) would be a more fair way to approach this.
---
Nah he would be like AHOY LADIES
---
Damn I'd be salty if they nerfed Freddy he's honestly fun to play against. They reworked his kit I thought a while back so why would they change it again?
---
She just nae nae'd on those stairs
---
Plague’s whole thing is that she makes everyone broken. If you bring no mither, you literally did her job for her. She just has to touch you with a tiny bit of sickness so you’re loud and gross, and then down you straight away.
---
Nah man, I'm a doctor main myself and hes for sure one of the worst. I'll give you that hes probably the best of the worst but hes quite bad. His power is buggy and he gets looped to hell.
---
That fits one was mabye a 90
---
Trapper = Jason
---
Cannibal = Leatherface 
---
The shape = Michael Myers
---
Nightmare = Freddy Krueger
---
Pig = Amanda 
---
Legion = Rip off Ghostface 
---
Ghostface = Stu
---
The doctor = Cenobite (with the right skin)
---
Why? DBD isn't FPS so PC players have 0 advantage over console players in all honesty big portion of PC players use gamepads while playing survivors (including me) there are some minor benefits on certain killers like Nurse, Huntress with easyer aiming and that's it.
---
Why are console players so scared of PC crowd like we are some kind of boogyman...
---
Damn, why am I getting downvotes? Is it because I made a post that isn't complaining about Spirit like everyone else?
---
Once had a Hag get to five stacks for DH because no one could find it, she just blasted through us and 4Kd. Couldn't even be mad because getting five stacks is nigh impossible and it just looks amazing.
---
It kinda ruined the whole thing.
---
Just a very trappy boi
---
I agree. Mainly because I think it inflated my rank since I relied on it. Now that I'm higher rank as a killer, I just get looped for forever and the Ruin disappears before that 1st loop is even finished.
---
B tier???? Freddy??? Lol you wild. Freddy’s A tier.
---
I am
---
Its debatable. I could be slightly biased because I'm pretty good with wraith but I'd argue clown and leather face are worse. Wraith is at least stealthy and fast as hell. Clown and leather have 0 mobility and can be looped off the edge of the earth lol. But yeah, hes really bad.
---
Remember when we all voted against a battlepass? Yeah
---
Trapper might be bad but every cry shows how run it is
---
"probably"...
---
PC players are generally far more skilled and dedicated as well.
---
It's just the way it is. That being said, overall, I think this game needs something like this.
---
Nope
---
Wraith: Bing Bong
---
Huntress: Hatchet Mama
---
Plague: Pukey
---
Hillbilly: Billy
---
Demogorgon: Democorgi
---
wait did the cosmetic get released already?
---
Oh by the way I forgot to answer that first question but whenever I'm close to reaching red rank, I just stop playing on purpose until rank reset.
---
I'd rather fight diverse survivor with different build than the sane red rank swf over and over again, red rank just isn't fun to me, regardless of which killer I play.
---
I think just faster frenzy speed and make deep wound not hot garbage and they'd be in a good spot. There's literally no threat from deep wound right now. So easy to counteract currently. Like you could just run around doing gens or whatever until theres a sliver left and start mending and it just pauses the timer, that is if it isn't already paused by just being on the same map as Legion.
---
I actually haven't faced many spirits at all in red ranks these last few days... mostly Huntresses.
---
I would just like a QoL update to trapper and I would be happy
---
1 good perk,2 bad perks,1 mediocre perk and 1 good add on and no offering not even close to OP
---
No skill checks for killers
---
It becomes a valid strategy to purposefully screw over your teammates and get them killed? Camping is a valid strategy? Deranking to go against people who are new to the game, people who might've picked up the game that day, is a valid strategy? Yeah, these are absolute scumbag things to do, and before someone says "Well, the devs say camping is a legit strat", what other pvp game is camping considered a legit strat except by children, noted trolls, and hackers?
---
Why would I DC when I'm having fun as trapper. Only games I seem to lose are when I get bad RNG on spawns but oh well I don't wanna rank up again
---
I would be quite happy if they added crossplay, since I could finally play dbd with my girlfriend while not having to grind for perks and such again if Im playing on the same platform, but I agree that it should be a thing a player could toggle by their choice.
---
I'm sick of survivors not realizing I'm just playing effectively
---
Not the chest stab and drag? That's the really nasty part.
---
Leatherface is the worst for sure on most maps he literally doesn't even have a power imo wraith right now is mid tier because he's got very good add ons and can do good stuff in Chase's like body blocking windows and windstorm mind games at pallets and gets pretty good map pressure from his power
---
They don't have anything to do with the population though. It's their own changes and "fixes" that are to blame.
---
They should learn how to be even remotely elegant in their ways. As currently they just go all one way or all the other, or counter one issue with another, and it's super tiresome. They could so easily fix the matchmaking system with just some slight effort on how opponents are chosen but nope, just all one way or the other, like always.
---
English language, motherfucker. Do you speak it?
---
Pallet.
---
Vault.
---
Yeah I get that. Its insanely rough at red ranks. People bully so hard. Especially when I main doctor lmao. I dont minding to much though. My only complaint is that when i switch to a killer i suck with (nurse) I'm still red rank and get my shit pushed in. I wish killers has separate ranks. I enjoy the practice vs the sweaty bastards and the blood points are just way to nice for me to grind survivor the entire time lol. Man I wish they'd do something about survivor bloodpoints.
---
It's because of the rift.
---
F
---
The yellow dark add on only makes traps like 2% darker the green one is top tier though
---
&gt; *"Oh, it’s a case of they think I’ll think that they’ll do A, so they’ll do B because I wouldn’t think they’d think of that, but then because I might think I know what they’re thinking they’ll do A after all because I wouldn’t think they’d think that way."* - Will Treaty
---
Now that they are going to nerf Spirit since she's "over performing" who's going to be the next rank 1 champion?
---
Bubba was my main for like 6 months and that’s the only non base face I had cause people only played as p3 Claude (before skin store).
---
Cuz my friend told me to and eventually forced us all to stab a security guard that we could have just fled instead and he went missing we went looking for him so now we are here

The green medkit is so you can run
---
Plunderers, ace in the home, pharmacy, sprint burst.
---
Zoom zoom get your medkit, if you get chased that's ok you can heal up later. If not then your next search has 80% faster search, get your items asap with sprint burst and leave all chests open before anyone gets hooked. Then get to Gen repairing with your sweet stash.
---
I think it comes from a need to atleast get one kill. If they leave the survivor might get unhooked and their desperate for atleast one kill.
---
You're really not. And could ask you the same thing. 
---
As for why I'm angry, blatant obliviousness/stupidity in people tends to do that. You have both in spades.
---
If they got rid of this, fixed deep wound (it's a joke right now), and maybe added some speed to Frenzy I feel like Legion would be in a pretty nice place.
---
I love it as killer whenever people with flashlights follow me arround the map.  
---
They won't do any progress and I allways end up winning.
---
What is the advantage of PC players over console outside of  few killers like Huntress or Nurse (and that is miniscule)
---
This isn't first person shooter that you can gain something with easyer aiming I'm using gamepad on PC to play survivor as is..., we all gain so much with cross-play and lose nothing...
---
It baffles me how insecure console players are..
---
looping isnt, teabagging is.
---
Buff other killers then maybe you’d see more diversity up there 😂
---
11 am est
---
I can't see anything with BBQ and Chili about 75% of the time in higher ranks.
---
Looks like some cool ones for the Trapper as well in there. Two different trap ones. Potentially a good Pig one as well but with a reverse bear trap, the one where they snap it around their head and push them away.
---
Trapper: bone mask boi, wraith: bing bongHag: ghoul huntress: Anna, Ghostface: Danny ,Demogorgon: demi
---
😂
---
Otzdarva is probably the best killer player I've seen.  
---
Most killers are under performing on red ranks, especially against SWFs because of balance issues.  
---
Usually they are that bad, that I've started to think that sometimes you just "can't win" even if played perfectly.  
---
Then I watch Otz playing some low tier killer without ruin and getting 4Ks like it's nothing (Usually because of slugging) - while still being positive.  
---
He is the ultimate killer main.
---
I'm rank 1 Doctor main, I do not play Billy and Nurse, play Spirit veeery rarely for rituals. I do not play Ruin on my Killers. I do lose games from time to time, but you cant win them all. I play mostly Doctor, Clown, Legion, LF, Trapper. You dont need Ruin on any Killer.

Nah this isn't the short weiner page
---
I can just picture the survivor grabbing onto the window frames and trying to throw your balance while you vault.
---
Fuck thought this was porn
---
i posted in the edit that im not including ruin because while it's meta, it's required. ruin isn't something you can really complain about
---
🙈🥴🤤🤫🙄🤔😏. Message me hahahhahahah
---
Reminds me of the dwemer ruins in Skyrim
---
Ikea, perhaps the next map will be?
---
and survivors are sick of killers not realizing they're doing the same :)
---
Only people who want this are PC players who want to destroy console players and console players who have never played it on PC
---
Survs probably broke it before you loaded in XD

heal her, this orange dripping liquid from a flower with mini tentacles might

---
I feel as though people didn’t get the joke
---
I have like over 600 hours played just on Legion and my top winning build is Thanatophobia, Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's Calling and BBQ
---
It works surprisingly well even without Ruin. BBQ on this build is just god tier (I use it to get info on surv locations to keep them injured)
---
Sloppy Butcher is used to make their healing last longer discouraging healing.
---
Thanatophobia punishes them for not healing and if they do heal they waste time.
---
I use Nurse's Calling to puniah them even more for healing.
---
For add-ons use Iridescent Button and Sketch Book or both the Nasty Blade and Dirty Blade for more time on mending.
---
It's kyf so palettes mean nothing to me. I was trying to teach him he needs to just break palettes, but he was insistent on trying to get me thru them lmao. And he was a rank 3 killer btw
---
You don't want to be that guy that doesn't whine about not getting the perks he wanted?
---
He reads it so.. strangely. There’s no emotion sometimes but sometimes there’s a hint of it, his pacing his weird, there’s just something really off and unnerving about him...
---
  Those "stretchy arms" actually don't exist, any small character simply has a lunge distance that matches a character model that is larger than theirs.
---
  Lunge is normalized based off of the 115% movespeed character known as the trapper, people thought nurse had a longer lunge too but it's the same thing.
---
  What nurse actually had was a faster lunge, it was unidirectional (as opposed to omindirectional like all other killer lunges) but was about 8-10 frames faster I think?
---
 
---
  TLDR small characters don't have bullshit lunges it just looks that way; things like character walk speed vs model size just don't look right sometimes.
---
Lol thank you!
---
Usually with every new shrine post there’s always somebody like “I just leveled Bubba for BBQ! I just leveled Hag for Ruin!” Etc..
---
**Wake Up!** 
---
When the exit gates are powered, you see the killer's aura for 5 seconds. The killer also suffers from the *Exposed* status effect and you can beat the shit out of them.
---
Your vote is really good but listen, you could change "salty survivors" to "survivor who just want to have fun bcs this is 20th prayer beads spirit in a row"
---
Well, I'm on PC, red rank killer, and my lobbies are pretty much instant. Guess I'm lucky...
---
Weird, cause that's considered one of the weaker addons by most of the huntress mains I know. If the huntress is good enough for you to need exhaustion perks to get away from, they're probably good enough to nullify all of them.
---
Legion was also Kenya.
---
We wil only get pennywise if dbd follows mr.Skarsgård
---
What no he doesnt,
---
Hes just pulling on his shirt stretching it
---
I havent seen the camping but there has been a weird amount of NOED for sure.
---
I'd love BHVR to give bonus BP to the killer whenever a SWF is in game. Calculate this bonus on the number of survivors together. I'd take a 4 man every damn time, man.
---
Sure
---
Jack Nicholson if it is Shining
---
Learherface?
---
I don't want pantless myers or shirtless myers... I want 2018's version of Myers
---
You've actually encountered the clown? I've played like 40 games as survivor now and havnt seen him once, still dont even know what he does.
---
Some killers do this intentionally, but some newer killers might not even know they are getting penalized for this. A quick and easy way to fix this is when the game is finished, if the penalty tracker is deducing points, place a pop up for the killer letting him know hey don't do this. It'll help the killer and the survivors in turn.
---
I expect more bad balance changes from the shit tier devs
---
When I first got moried, it wasn’t a Mori. It was Rancor
---
Do gens noobs
---
They can't downvote you if you downvote yourself first
---
The harder we get the faster we learn
---
Depends where you live but it’s the 13th EST
---
Finally the spoon got an upgrade
---
Implement the fan killer music that replaces the generic ones.
---
I feel like Ghostface suffers the same problem that OG Legion did, where the problem isn't exactly that they 4k with ease but that even a bad GF can too easily ruin one survivor's day, more so than other killers and even other stealth killers. I'm not sure what the fix is to this though. Maybe make it so he can't build expose progress if he's being exposed?
---
Another Killer main here. It’s not a thing.
---
Except for to mori everyone challenge and the survivor in my game arguing, that killing all survivors includes sacrifices smh. Also sacrifice 3 survivors during zur endgame collapse  if tome 4 is to come as is.
---
Was this meant to be funny?  The apache joke was overused in 2016
---
People so blind they talk about crossplay lol. You think you do but you dont. Crossplay would be awfull
---
Just turn the narrator off lmao
---
Yeah
---
He looked behind to see if you were there just as you passed by each other. A rare example of having sensitivity too high.
---
I thought it showed you the 3 closest gens to your location?... Not the 3 gens closest to eachother?
---
Also not a thing unless you really going out of your way to attack one person only. But if you get unhooked seconds after I just hooked you and the two of you split off and I happen to chase you don’t cry.
---
Wait, we already have an aim assist for melee ...
---
Imaging playing 5 FPS, this list is irrelevant.
---
For tome 1?
---
Punished how? Account suspension or
---
It hasn’t been out long enough to show up. We are still getting Ghostface’s perks showing up for the first time.
---
Camping, as a strategy, is by itself bad. You get one survivor chased and hooked, and in the 120 seconds it takes for that survivor to die, the Generators end up completed and the 3 other survivors escape.
---
HOWEVER, Camping, as a strategy, works because it's not by itself in a vacuum. Survivors, particularly those not in a SWF, are altruistic and will go in to save their teammate. They won't all be on generators, or know to rush the generators as the objective to counter the Camp. They'll literally run in and take the bait, there-by rewarding the Camp. And once a second survivor takes the bait, the other 2 survivors won't be able to guarantee that the generators are complete and the doors are opened in time before the Camper breaks off from the hook.
---
Bad survivors don't know how to counter a camp. Then the camp works and the killer comes out of it with 2-4 kills. This provides incentive to the killer to camp again. And that camp succeeds, and the next, and the next.
---
Maybe the killer only gets 1 kill, maybe the killer gets rewarded with 4 kills. To the killer, there's an above-average gain. 
---
So when it comes to Guaranteed 1k with a chance for 4k, and the statistical probability of having potato survivors that'll take the bait of the Camp, Killers are taught to Camp. And then they're never taught otherwise.
---
Bad survivors create campers.
---
32 (8x4) but extra because of the event
---
Your loading screen was longer then theirs. They broke it before you loaded in
---
It really depends on if there's a lot of people in either the killer queue or survivor queue that I play.
---
I mean it's easy to understand, I don't know why people allways act like they don't see ANY reason why the killer would camp them.
---
Not every killer BP min-maxes every action and plays the game like chess.
---
I would say like 90% of killers don't.  
---
They are just trying to have fun. And it's pretty hard to have fun as killer when you face good SWFs or just good players in general since the game is slightly balanced in favor of the survivors.  
---
So why do some killers facecamp?  
---
Maybe because they are frustrated towards you. You t-bagged them? You BM? Perhaps they want you do die.
---
Another reason might be the fact, that the game is almost over and they want to secure atleast one kill so they don't feel like they "completely lost".
---
And lets not forget that camping can me the right move in certain situations. Lots of people don't mention this or act like this isn't true.  
---
"tHeRe Is NeVeR a ReAsOn To CaMp In DbD!"  
---
I mean, there are, though.  
---
Especially when facing bad survivors, altruistic survivors and SWFs.  
---
I had lots of situations where one guy was dead, one was hooked, and I could see the other 2 ppl standing 10 metres in front of me spamming emotes trying to lure me away.  
---
You're not doing any progress. So why should I leave the guy and give you a free safe? You're not putting pressure on me, so I'll do it enforce the next hook stage.  
---
Then there are these SWFs groups that go for saves no matter what.  
---
You literally JUST hooked the guy and turned arround and allready see how 2 people are sprinting towards you to hook dive, even though you're a Leatherface.  
---
What do you want to do? Rev your chainsaw and down them, or turn away and run towards the next corner so they won't call you a filthy camper afterwards?  
---
I know what I would do :)  
---
So coming from a red ranked killer main: Usually camping isn't BP effecient, but there are a lot of scenarios where camping is actually the right move, since most survivors don't punish you for doing it/also reward you for doing it.
---
Ghostface after getting pallet stunned
---
There’s a bug where killers can’t see their totem. Found it kyf, ruin was still up but killer couldn’t see the totem aura and at a certain distance it looked like a dull totem.
---
This is the best comment I've ever read
---
He's also my favorite to vs. I'm not the stereotypical leatherface camper and if by just removing his penalty speed when he revs the chainsaw he would honestly be overpowered
---
Finally i can get a halloween cosmetic
---
Im not OP. The link is https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dvhqap/poll/ but I found it hilarious yea.
---
Enduring is strong for a lot of killers and botany is very underrated.
---
Clown, wraith, trapper, legion
---
Lol at least you can save your shards
---
No, besides the newest Map i think the vast majority is ugly, you feel that they are machine created and not immersive at all. True, the Temple interior is great, the outside though is just generic stuff like on every other map.
---
Rinse those pallets. Chuck em down. Chuck em early. Chuck them all. If there's a pallete on the map it is not safe from.

 da ba dee da ba daa
---
I read it as broWN toolbox
---
There was a time when I go out of my way to not tunnel farmed unhooked survivors. Now I immediately down them just ato when they complain in post chat, I can ask them to report farmers.
---
Their is a difference between having a shit teammate and deliberate abuse of a fair killer.
---
was that the case before tome 1 got released?
---
Maybe I should make my gamer tag the pallete hunter 😳
---
cool drawing. whats the costume going to look like?
---
Mori everyone challenge? Are you talking about the 4k challenge? Cause you definitely didn't need to mori for that.
---
It's a shame green medkits are just brown medkits now.
---
Well brutal strength was the only character perk that was there and it was in the shrine, plus the devs said it in a livestream
---
Wraith = Ding Dong, Cannibal = Leatherface, Then you have Freddy and Michael.
---
My main arguments that he is fun and popular and yeah kinda weak vs good players. And I guess  you are right will be back to nurse then
---
Seriously? Then bhvr did a bit oopsie with the wording since in the paar killing Always was different from sacrificing.
---
I've seen a few people just suck it up and take the rank hit to farm one or two games for the Trapper-specific one. I feel like most people know what you're doing and will be decent enough to take the easy win in exchange for stepping in a trap twice.
---
To watch for fun and entertainment, CowsIAM. Also Ussylis and HybridPanda.
---
So instead of wasting 2 perk slots bring a medkit,adrenaline plunderer, or inner strength
---
ty, didn't know about it
---
When do we expect the second Tome to be available?
---
... A past lost in space 🎶
---
I ALWAYS wanted cross play before...when I was a PC gamer. Now I play console and I don't want it for this very reason. I already get it on the PvP IN Sea of Thieves. Other PC players can even tell I'm on console just by watching me move around in the game. Yay...
---
It mixes the ranks. For example I was rank 1 killer and now I'm rank 10 with 2 pips, and a rank 8 became a rank 13. Normally as rank 1 I wouldn't (or shouldn't...) be matching with a rank 8, but now as a rank 10 it can happen with rank 13.
---
See more info about rank reset in that link (season tab) https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank
---
Hey nooooow... You're onto something!
---
Check the news in game.
---
Today.
---
I definitely feel like they are one of the weakest killers at the moment.
---
As a purple rank survivor, I'd honestly like to see other killers besides the Spirit or Billy. It's not because I think they're overpowered, it would just be fun to see something else. I have around 250 h in the game (not much, I know) and I've seen the Plague maybe 2 or 3 times, I've seen only one Demogorgon since the hype about the Stranger Things chapter stopped.
---
Mainly because it would increase the players (making matchmaking faster), instead of having...3 different communties separated

Face camping is toxic though
---
How so?
---
The changes you are suggesting are too survivor-sided, and I'm pretty sure it's a bug. Also, how could you get this much if you were hooked once, and I'm assuming got farmed with bt, so got hit twice after this and still don't have any chase/altruism bps?
---
Camping isn't toxic, face camping is
---
Oh damn, that's tragic indeed!
---
You're right... I'm not ready or worthy of that responsibility. You've humbled me, truly humbled me
---
it's a survey, not a quiz.
---
I know it’s mainstream but Noob3
---
Yeah but you aren't facing off against another nurse qho has better control than you, just survivors who I don't really think a controller would make much of a difference for. Console players will just have some potentially better killers to play against than they're used to. The fact that the game is asymetrical makes cross play between platforms work so much better than, say, pitting people playing an fps on controller against m and kb.
---
When killer moves near you and you drop a pallet and suddenly realize they haven't seen you before and were walking somewhere else
---
hey man your guess is as good as mine making points on surv is too hard killers to ez
---
I mean, it's not. But okay.
---
Nothing it's just more Jane hentai
---
low ranks in a nutshell
---
Fraddy’s face is awesome)
---
Before it worked really well on Freddy pre-rework since being in the Dream World also affect the time to open doors, and combining Remember Me just made it take forever to open a door. He also had wall hacks so he could slug easily and find other survivors. 
---
I think if they just revert it to 30secs it wouldn’t be bad. The 2nd change is I’m kind of iffy about. It would already take longer to open an exit game,
---
If "progression" includes all purchases and content, then in theory you should have all of your characters and cosmetics on every platform that they're available for (noting that some characters are just outright not present on Switch).
---
If I have to explain it to you, then you won't understand anyway. It's just as toxic as t-bagging after a pallet stuns or at an exit gate. It's like someone corner trapping you. It's like when people would hold lobbies hostage back in the day, forcing either the killer or survivor to quit. IT IS TOXIC. There is a big difference between camping the hook and standing still, starring the survivor directly in the face and constantly hitting them while they are on the hook. If you can't figure out why this would be considered toxic, you might have a problem. Take it from a killer main, face camping is toxic behavior.
---
Ah ok, that explains it a lot. Was a rank 7 survivor, now rank 13 and had 3 of the easiest games lol
---
Check out FunGoose, best educational streamer.
---
I definitely gotta disagree ESPECIALLY at high ranks. Sentient killers can and will still find you even if you have iron will and nothing can counter stridor. There are WAYYY better perks to run at high ranks imo
---
You're an idiot, and the lowest rank you get to is probably 18
---
It's a problem with some maps where there is no floor and you can just fall down. It's dumb.
---
Is it is it really
---
Ah I got you. yeah had a rank 15 killer who would have been rank 12 against 43 survivors who would have been rank 6-8 lol
---
I am red ranks on both sides.
---
You seem triggered about some petty stuff. Something must be wrong in your life. I feel bad for you.
---
Enjoy your day mate :)
---
I find Tru3 the most racional and wise streamer I've seen. You're not going to see show of like monto or oh tofu or rage quits it or popular opinions in his channel. He gives his opinion based on his data. He's probably not the best on both sides, definitely better killer than survivor. Although, I think the skill cap for killer is lower than for survivor. Most of the community thinks zubat is one of the best survivors out there and he probably is but you will see him dcing against a prayer beads and you'll never see Tru3 doing it.
---
Another YouTuber really good is pain reliever.
---
It's probably unwise to hold yourself to the same standard as an actual DBD streamer that's logged many hundreds, if not thousands, of hours ingame.
---
How are you currently playing him? Let's look at improving your effectiveness for the way *you* play him.
---
Ah the long anticipated sequel.
---
The alchemist went pretty crazy after juicing up from that flower that he said he'd do anything for, even go back into the trials in the cinematic.
---
I wear Survivorface because holy shit those Jakes were so rare. I got it before Jake got new cosmetics
---
I dont know many of these channels but i'll check them out now.Thanks guys.
---
Enduring.... again!
---
In the long run, bad teachables are almost moot. You're not going to notice the difference between a 1 in 28 chance of seeing the perk you want, and a 1 in 29 chance.
---
Do... do you know how the internet and reddit works?
---
Only bad survivors depip to get paired with bad killers they can beat. Rank reset drops the actually good survivors to green ranks, which is a cake walk for them after facing try hards all month.
---
Yeeeea It was his key and he was NOT happy
---
... no, I've never seen a dog do any of that as a matter of fact. That's a bit of a stretch, no? Monsters usually aren't just trying to break necks, they suck blood and eat flesh in most horror movies I've seen (like the Hag).
---
Lol you've clearly never played killer
---
Nea second most popular? I feel so basic. Time to main Jeff, who I'm surprised isn't higher.
---
I think, it's either 19:00 or 20:00 from where I live (GMT +1). It's happening today.
---
I would be interested in buying it for Switch to play when I'm elsewhere. But it doesn't seem like the Switch version is worth it or ever will be.
---
Tried trapper (my main) without Ruin from rank 1. Deranked pretty quickly, two gens are done by the Time you placed your traps.
---
That doesn't really relate to the platform. Your ping should be mostly the same, unless the develooper made some weird fuck ups when porting the game.
---
Oh no, this dude was definitely using some sort of abusive cheat engine. 
---
[You can watch him disappear through a wall here.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/507614702?t=02h30m10s)
---
Also during this game, I downed him once, and upon going to pick him up, I was entirely unable to do so. Like no prompt for spacebar or anything.
---
First day after rank reset is wild west. It's the best day to use meme builds. It's not even easy, it's just... Weird
---
Nice try AaronPlaysTV...
---
Ok, cool!
---
Other way around for me
---
I mean, yeah, but that'd be more of a universal improvement for console players. Nurse (and Huntress) are harder on console because aiming is inherently less precise with a joystick than a mouse.
---
No hes played rank 20 killer 🤣
---
It depends on your rank
---
Pants on? Or off? 😏
---
Lol yeah I've dropped into green ranks and man it's so much easier!
---
He's not exclusively DBD but I've been watching his DBD videos since the beta. Ohmwrecker is super enjoyable because he plays survivor and killer pretty equally.
---
He will report u co-op with the killer muahahaa
---
You nerfed her boobs already :(
---
True, not in this case tho
---
more like rank 13 but thanks for the assumptions and useless comments guys
---
&gt;If I have to explain it to you, then you won't understand anyway.
---
Because it can't be explained. It's all about personal preference.
---
&gt; It's just as toxic as t-bagging after a pallet stuns or at an exit gate. 
---
No it's not.
---
Definition of toxicity in online gaming:
---
**Toxicity** (in **games** or any social context) is communication and behavior that BOTH risks harm (including emotional harm or distress) to other participants AND achieves no significantly higher objective. 
---
By camping someone you still follow your objective of killing the survivor, which allready makes it not toxic BY DEFINITION.
---
T-Bagging at the exit gates doesn't follow any of the survivors objective and just exists to trigger the opponent, which could make it toxic, yes.
---
I could close the case here, and since you allready raged at me in another thread like a little baby, I would not lose any of my time. But I will still explain it for some other people that might read this.
---
&gt;  It's like someone corner trapping you. 
---
Wait, what?  
---
Holding the game hostage/bodyblocking for no particular reason? Yes, that would be toxic.
---
&gt;  IT IS TOXIC.  
---
You might say this. But as a fact, it is not. I know that you won't change your opinion because you're stubborn and you don't WANT to change your opinion, but I'll still give the reasons why it isn't. :)  
---
&gt; If you can't figure out why this would be considered toxic, you might have a problem. 
---
I am fine. I win most of my games on rank 1. There is a lot to complain about on both sides. Camping being toxic isn't something of these things.
---
"Camping" in general can't really be defined. Every survivor (and killer) has their own definition of camping.  
---
If there are only 3 people left, one is hooked and 2 are standing 10m in front of you spamming emotes trying to lure you away.  
---
Are you facecamping then if you are refusing to leave the hooked guy, even though it's a smart move?  
---
If it takes you 10 seconds to trap the hooked guy as Hag - does it make you a facecamper?  
---
If you see scratch marks arround the hooked area and you waste 20 seconds looking for a guy nearby - are you a facecamper now? Yes? No? Just a regular camper? A Proxy-Camper? A toxic piece of shit?  
---
Some might say yes.  
---
Some might say no.  
---
&gt; Take it from a killer main, face camping is toxic behavior. 
---
Take it from a killer main that plays both sides on a competitive red rank level for more than 2 years.
---
It is not.  
---
Streamers like Otzdarva and Tru3Talent agree.  
---
People that know the definition of Toxicity agree.
---
Some random people crying on the DbD subreddit don't.
---
And since you allready raged at me in another thread just because I don't share your opinion, I'll leave it here.  
---
Have a nice day, even though you're talking bullshit :)
---
Epic Bruh moment from me then
---
FeelsBadMan :(
---
I don't get it, he's the most attractive male on the roster imo. Lack of cosmetics hurts him tho...
---
He was boring for the survivors before the nerf...
---
Removed unrelated to dead by daylight
---
No problem MilkFetish95
---
Not related but I was trying to enjoy Ifunny but the community is very toxic for no apparent reason.
---
Destroying the world? It would break anything.
---
It's absolutely a strong add on, being able to deny perk (or multiple ones) is extreamly impactful. Especially dead hard, which fucks her over on loops a lot.
---
You can't nullify someone dead harding behing a corner when you have them in a corridor being a sitting duck.
---
The problem with exhaustion add ons is that the timer doesn't mean anything on them. Back in the day exhaustion went down as you were running, so if you were good enough then you could realistically outlive the timer. Now there is no difference between a born and green, 15 seconds and 90 seconds exhaustion add ons. Once it's been applied, it's there for the rest of the chase, so you are effectively playing without a perk.
---
It's like I could equip a toolbox add on that made ruin do nothing, or got a medkit add on that nullified nurse's calling, stuff like that. 
---
You can see that the devs aren't fond of exhaustion add ons, as the last 5 killers they did have none. I was actually really pleasantly surprized they didn't give plague an exhaustion add on.
---
Funny you mention that cause unfortunately a lot of killers we've been running into have been tunneling. They just dunno how to loop efficiently which is expected so yeah... None of us run obsession perks so I think killers realize there's no DS and don't hesitate to pick up recently downed people.
---
Tomes are done so quickly
---
When I play Trapper I abandon first 2 gens for territorial preparation in 3-4 gens zone, and I stay there. Pop for gen protection has a lot of value.
---
Three scoops.
---
Haha no, just my username
---
Im from south America and I like playing killer a lot, from rank 20 to 16 the time can be like 10-15 min but from rank 15 to lower is like 5-7, which isn't so terrible actually
---
Change them both!  Just because both sides have unfun things doesn’t make it okay.  I personally am very much a killer main with a side of swf, change haddonfield and change spirit.  Change keys and Change moris.  Change survivors perks and change noed.  Get rid of everything that (as a general consensus) is unfun to face, and replace it with something that is fair and fun for both sides.  There is a way!
---
Fix it how? You got instadowned and then camped, you dont get points in that scenario. 
---
If you got downed instantly by a leatherface you fucked up anyway, killers are disocuraged to camp in every way possible.
---
Yes
---
&gt;Survivors who Boop the Snoot are exposed
---
I would be fine with a honk sound when booping tbh
---
Im rank 8 killer and find games very fast. Im rank 6 survivor and it takes almost 10 minutes to find a game.
---
I see a furry.
---
Stop nerfing killers ;( This game is already so survivor favored. (Except Nurse)
---
HybridPanda. He's a lot more authentic when he's having fun, and doesn't dial it up for the votes.
---
Yeah I started appearing offline when they play so they don't invite me. I think they genuinely feel guilty leaving me out even though I personally choose to sit out (they are really nice). It would be fun to play but gonna wait for them to get used to the game more.
---
It had a potential to be the best map in the game but they put it in the Red Forest which doesn't fit the atmosphere at all and looks shitty from the outside.
---
Lmao
---
I hit disagree because crossplay is just another way to introduce game breaking bugs, when the game is still full of so many, with new ones popping up constantly.
---
Now for real. Do you know that killers are heavily punished for camping right? If a killer camps, he certainly will not win the game and he will depip. I'd say camping is a meme strategy if you face one, at least wait that your team do their jobs and rush the gens and get out of that game. And I'm a killer main who sometimes do the meme camping build.
---
Console DbD is definitely not in the state of competing against pc right now, just think about a console killer (where fps is crucial since you're in 1st person view dealing with 3rd person opponents) running on those 35fps against a pc team..
---
even tho some matchmaking times make u wish they added cross-platform..
---
I always feel like male survivors take up all my screen and their run animation is slightly comedic to me, I always play females
---
100 % legit
---
Same. It gives me hope for the old man Myers skin in the future though.
---
Looks really cool, I like your style.
---
Best is that the game is literally lore wise made for the killers.
---
Goes from boi to boi with a lot of make up
---
No problem. Hope it makes it into the top posts, you deserve it.
---
imo he needs inbuilt darkened traps and carrying 2 traps at once, instead of having these as addons.
---
that'll make him a much better killer already.
---
Dawwwww🖤
---
Can you still get the rewards for completing time 1?
---
I didn't know it was possible to do that badly as a survivor.
---
People only de rank so far so around rank 20 or so you have to find other new people
---
Yeah, on the right she doesn't look like the pig-faced girl as much.
---
Now what.......
---
Ah you’re right, I guess it is a little biased because of that, a lot of them that I can across were p3 lvl50 blendettes though lol. Still, I’m sure there were lots of people playing her just for the challenges, good point!
---
That should be a disconnect icon, but okay.
---
Haha, I didn’t even post my opinion, just my experience, and people never seem to like it.
---
Most people in this subreddit don’t play both sides, and say only people who play both sides can give balance ideas, yet when I actually say anything after playing for 2 years, they take back their word pretty fast to protect their opinions.
---
I always hit Quentin when I'm Freddy and I hook him. Role playing...
---
NoOb3
---
sometimes i lose the killer but don't realize it, then drop a pallet because I think they are right behind me
---
Yeah the Tomes are permanent.
---
Nah. He is around mid tier, his kit is pretty loaded and he is a good all-rounder, just not top tier. You need to know how to play him though, many people just have no idea how to use Shred, which Perks to run on him or how to use Portals and then get wrecked.
---
There are dozens of us! Dozens!
---
Shadowborn and Spies from the Shadows are dogshit.
---
You actually lose points as killers for being in close proximity to a hooked survivor when no one else is around them. My personal favorite is the face camp + getting hit repeatedly on hook. And there are people wonder why other people dc from this game...
---
Im genuinely surprised about how rare Ashs are. He's one of the biggest Horror Icons wtf
---
Yea but do you still get the rewards for completing everything like the eye charm
---
Freddy, hands down.
---
not a surprise that base survivors are played most
---
Name a killer that's better in areas with pallets and windows.
---
I guess you could say... Bill is getting... *Left Behind.*
---
Was facecamped by a demogorgon on the third game I played
---
CowsIAM, Zet0r, not Otzdarva, Scott Jund, Tru3Talent. Not all are youtubers per se, since some just upload twitch highlights
---
Did you play last halloween? Alchemist tried to follow vigo's journals. Aparently he's not Vigo
---
I feel like this was definitely a glitch but your BT suggestion was already previously in the game and was taken out for good reason. Trust me I get it though being face camped sucks and when I’m making a risky attempt to rescue with my BT I wish I could get the same benefits as the person I unhooked but it’s just not balanced.
---
Oh shit nvm, that guy is pos. Hopefully that's a rare occurance.
---
new around here?
---
A ten second search [turned up this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/awjsr8/contagious_laughter_sound_on/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
This the one you mean?
---
I just started playing killers literally yesterday and started with the spirit. I can't wait to see what changes she gets. I had fun with her so I hope she becomes more accepted to play.
---
Every game I played as survivor over the last month or so, I just wrote down what killers I faced in every match and added them all up. This was on PS4 at survivor rank 3-5
---
No0b3 Puppers and Pain Relievers
---
Yeah, it's surprising when he's the most mediocre of DbD streamers.
---
You should remind that all survivors got 2 types off hitboxes. The one you mean is true the actuall hitbox  for every survivor is the same. Like when a hatchet or m1 hits a survivor its the same hitbox. But there is also a collision hitbox for every killer and survivor. The collision hitbox obviously prevents survivors/ killers from walking through walls for an example. The difference isnt big but its still a thing. So feng meg and kate got the same modell. But jeff has another model then dwight.  Example: There are a few places on different maps where survivors like kate are able to fit in between 2 barrels and jeff or david cant. This may isnt a huge difference but its still a difference
---
Not like Claud but atleast she doesn't get mori'd all the time
---
perhaps this video from Otz could be useful
---
https://youtu.be/P0aFo4lPARw
---
Ace and Tapp are the quietest survivors
---
Kate is the quietest female and she has the advantage that she's shorter than the males
---
They can be great for new players.
---
If someone only plays a certain character they might not want to waste points on other characters. Shrine having base perks also helps those who are just starting to level up. Say I'm starting fresh and I like to play Kate. Now I want to get adrenaline from meg, or iron will from Jake, bt from Bill. I'd have to grind to lvl 40/35/30 to get those perks, I can get it from the shrine. You gotta think about the new guys too.
---
Umm, myers? You get to become so intemat with that beutifull shape OwO
---
I need them blood points. I need my fix
---
Grats. I got up to 14 once.
---
Trappy boi, ghostie, billy, bubba and mrs.piggy.
---
Imma rebel
---
Spirit is way better but I LOVE playing Clown! He's so fun.
---
As a "new" guy myself (or someone who has very little survivor playtime, almost no survivors levelled and has been dumping everything over the last 2 months into killers) no, not really. I would never buy a base game perk from the Shrine, levelling them is so much faster than getting 2K Shards (the math gets posted in like every Shrine thread).
---
Not to mention new players would benefit a lot more getting perks from characters they haven´t bought than just to save a little time (and again, not really since it´s faster to get to lvl 40 than to get 2K Shards).
---
I pointed this out on my stream a few days ago i was pretty amazed! Now we just need Jeff without a beard.
---
Well the challenges are at least free to do so there is that
---
It's cool we can't beat them either.
---
Sincerely, high rank Survivors
---
God im glad the community doesnt balance the game
---
Wait reverse pallets are back?
---
Whoever sh was is lost to the spirit, she is but the embodiment of fear, anger, confusion, her abillity to reflect on what is going on around her has been lost. Shes a spirit, not an indevidual.
---
The addons leave a lot to be desired in terms of creativity and power-wise. But some good addons to run are Rat Liver and Deer Lung. Also a guess as to why they did this is because f they mess around giving a kilelr too strong uncommon and rare addons they need to tweak their powert o make it less powerfull so addons don't overtune them. That being said the very rare and ultras need some changes. Btw have you visited the wiki? It has some very informative numbers on most addons, some addons end up being stronger than you think even if they say slightly.
---
It's not imbalanced, this is not a classic fps game, the only one who plays in first person is the killer and if your opponent is playing on kb+m or gamepad doesn't make any difference.
---
Also a good nurse on pc will destroy survivors on pc and survivors on console, again, no difference.
---
PainReliver, his voice is very calming
---
Where was this taken?
---
We literally just had him and died in the first 5 minutes :(
---
I think it's more *categorizing* an *event* rather than *labeling* and unfair or unbalanced game mechanic. The latter which I think most toxic players would misunderstand.
---
"Killer mains" bruh the *only* killer I can play is freddy and I still upvoted it
---
I mean i've got about 700 hours i stopped playing though cause the game is just damn boring to me when most of the killers are being toxic imo. But i've been able to loop killers for up to 5 gen's since i had like 400-500\~ hours lmao
---
It really depends on what you mean by "kill them early". Tunnel? Hook camp?
---
Level a survivor to get the perk and then use a toolbox with add ons that are for more skill checks and make the great skill check thing a bit bigger.
---
I didnt do Gens while this challenge I did hooks. 
---
I am also Bad at great skill checks, but that is how I did it.
---
I always try to protect my friends when they're being tunneled/bullied so I understand where you're coming from but it is not your job as a killer to give survivors a good experience. You're doing what the game is having you do for your own experience. The devs need to understand that there should be a totally separate lobby for ranked and casual players.
---
Thats literally what I said. I said its a COLLECTIVE 20% penalty for both people.
---
I stopped recommending DBD to my friends because they would want to play with me and me having a red rank and getting super sweaty killers would make them not enjoy the game.
---
It was both sides, even I wasn't having fun since they won't do generators or do noob mistakes and I would keep dying because of kt.
---
Welp, after they'll nerf spirit, some other killer will get hate and DC, therefore overperforming since DC count as kills and inevitable nerfed. That's how it is
---
Whats the drake one?
---
Yous should not react that way with foreigners... As an English speaking person you don't understand how it is to have to learn another language and we can't avoid these mistakes we have to do them and get better. Ps last mistake was a typing mistake
---
Why the TBH? What other horror game have you put hundreds of hours into that you were still scared shitless by?
---
It's just how it works
---
The official response was that the challenges "weren't final", but to the best of my knowledge no one has stated whether or not they're accurate in terms of direction.
---
Like u/0megaFlames I just want to see the lore, I don't follow the logic that insists I play some truly horrific games for the privilege.
---
Gamer mice have X3/X4/... switches on them. They make 3/4/... clicks for each time you press the mouse button. That is probably the easiest way to do it.
---
Anyone else just instinctively down vote when people are scrounging for up votes?
---
Yup it is, me and my 2 friends would make a plan to play DBD and would be staring at the campfire for 20 minutes before a friend decides to just leave but this has been happening to DBD as far as I can remember, the matchmaking is quite messed up.
---
You're lucky you didn't get to experience matchmaking queues when they updated the matchmaking ranks. It was an hour to find games... a legit hour.
---
I bought Ash for MoM when he was first released, can’t imagine how bad the sales have been post rework
---
It's not even that people want her piledrivered to hell with nerfs. She just needs to be fair. Her counterplay really isn't as fair as it should be.
---
&gt; There's....

&gt; Somethingonthewing...
---
&gt; Some...
---
&gt; THING.
---
We don't need players like that, they're the types to dip out after you've done 4 gens and unhooked them 3 times because the door opened because it's just too scairyy
---
The fuck you on
---
My friend, I admire your optimism. But with a game like DBD it sounds kinda impossible considering how unbalanced the game is naturally. And everyone's always gonna have something they dislike/complain about.
---
There hasn't been a Nerf to nurse in her power they nerfed her broken insane addons.
---
All they changed was each blink takes 3 seconds to charge after using like a cooldown so 2 blinks takes 6 seconds person I have to be a little slower but it hardly did anything to me.
---
Except half of all games people have their terror radius set to one penis length away
---
You're absolutely right, my bad i rewatched the video. I'll edit the post. I still stand by it being pretty toxic to play so negatively but I shouldnt have said that without checking first. I'm sorry
---
Ummmm maybe they're not Swf?
---
I usually play solo and I get killer messaging me saying I was sweaty for playing SWF. Higher ranks= experienced survivors.
---
Thanks, all i had was paper and a pencil sooo yeah
---
Oh wow thank you :0 that’s really cool
---
Woah wtf why's Jeff so low? He doesn't even suck lol. He was the best part and the saving grace of Chapter 10
---
No
---
it's horrendous, I told my friend to fuck the tutorial I'll give him my own in game.
---
Nea                  the healthier Nea
---
*casually glances over the fact there is no counter to Spirit with stridor*
---
Youre still relying on a "crutch" perk in this case and gen locking. If you truly didnt need ruin/corrupt, you wouldnt have to rely on locking a 3 gen.
---
For Trapper, Ruin as a totem exisiting in any fashion is potentially a game winner. One trap in front of the totem and at an escape route will usually catch somebody, they'll waste additional time disarming these traps on top of ruin already extending the game, and likely have 2 people attempting to break the totem (half the survivors doing nothing essentially). The totem is bait that also has a purpose.
---
Regardless, Ruin is essential to this style of Ghostface, which is why I'm telling him to get it. You arent being helpful at all to the question.
---
More time on gens = more stalk time on more survivors. If they break ruin quickly, oh well, but it contributes to your overall stalking ability to have people taking longer on gens as long as it is up. You can also have a good chance of pulling somebody off the totem
---
He doesn't. Based on previous interactions with him
---
Well yea... That's one of the downsides to SWF. You want fast lobbys play alone or with 1 friend
---
Yup id prefer it if crossplay is just between the consoles.
---
So get the perk? Its a default perk.
---
Other than that not doing one rift challenege doesnt make you lose anything, a few rift fragments which you can get just by playing
---
Nope, you'll only be matched against or with ppl close to your region and there is no way to change that sadly.
---
Vpn
---
It's not, I get games within a minute almost every time..
---
What game are you guys playing or do you just suffer from the worst case of ADHD possible lol
---
Until you realize the M&amp;K hardware used on console is specifically designed to fool the console into being recognized as standard controller inputs.
---
Lol who ever said anything about hunting 1 survivor the whole game?  I said that killers go after the ones already wounded, and a good killer will branch out instead of camping the hooks.  But if a survivor is dumb enough to unhook their friend when the killer is right there (or try to unhook someone in a chase of all things) then I don’t think it’s wrong of the killer to strike the already wounded survivor who was just unhooked.  When that happens to me, I don’t get pissed at the killer for taking the easy hit, I get pissed at my fellow survivor for pulling that kinda stunt without BT.  
---
Honestly, at this point it just seems like you’re arguing for the sake of arguing.  Like you’re purposefully missing all my points.  Kinda losing interest here.
---
You'd think Freddy would be played more because he's so good. He's the good example of how to make a strong killer.
---
He was only loyal out of fear of them. He grew up with an intellectual disability and a degenerative facial disease and his “family” made him believe he was ugly because of it. They were incest and cannibals and used him to support that. But I mean that’s really only if you’re watching the 2003 remake and not Tobe Hooper’s original. I wouldn’t necessarily call him a coward because he didn’t know any better but I can see how he can perceived as one especially if you watch the original.
---
Thats very well drawn man nice job
---
Reeeeeee
---
Thank you🖤
---
 Ok... so this, is what IT feels like, This is the killer we longer for.
---
One important note here: during a chase you are not required to loose a Killer. You are required to make him waste enough time for your teammates to complete generators. If a Killer chases you for at least one gen, you may already consider yourself a succesful looper.
---
Just run from pallet to pallet and learn to throw them on a Killer's face. Then make sure a Killers statrs breaking it, as once started, he cannot abort that animation and therefore will waste his time. In time you will learn the most popular jukes and counter-jukes.

I'd like aaron more if he didn't use the exact same music for every single video.
---
There’s no harm in dropping points on GF  even before you get the perks you want, as you’re clearing the perks you don’t want. And you want to play him, and to do so takes addons. But focus more on Leveling other killers, yes. GF is also a killer that benefits from more experience as a killer; his no red glow let’s him mindgame and you don’t know those yet. 
---
Pay attention to the Shrine of secrets. It has teachable perks that change every week and you spend shards you gain as you level.
---
What do you mean by "optimize"? Optimize for what?
---
An exhaustion perk of any sort is kind of required for most build, so Lithe is my suggestion as a Lightweight / Urban Evasion replacement. Lightweight is not even that good, if I remember correctly. It makes it easier for Killers do termine which direction you are going, as they only see yuor latest scratchmarks.
---
Also a solo play build in my opinion benefits from Kindred, because random people are so random.
---
Nice contradiction. There was a nerf to her base power. You even told us what the nerf was.
---
Also, the biggest nerf to her was fixing the animation. She was able to swing before survivors could see her after blink. They made her appear earlier. This changes a lot
---
Lol same, that's y I stopped running Dead Hard, it's too dependent on ping sadly...
---
Yup, I was very happy to see that inclusivity. BHVR did a pretty good job.. unironically
---
Same dude
---
Quentin’s secret 4th perk: Unleashed Revenge
---
When Quentin gets camped by the killer, he becomes uncontrollably violent. If the killer is within 8 Meters of the hook Quentin is stuck on, he rips himself off of the hook, tackles the killer, and beats them to death, Mori-ing the killer and instantly ending the match.
---
Definitely no
---
I can't even call the blink recharge a nerf bc it barely did fuck all to how I play her anyways the only real nerf that has happened to nurse is dedicated servers messing up her blinks and getting u stuck in the smallest of things
---
Gotta appeal to everyone so fights don’t happen. But as I say this I know there will be some people who will try and start a fight over soemthing this small lol. 
---
Reality is ya can never win with people lol.

jeff needs a jesus skin where he just wares a robe/bath robe

I've always been slightly confused about one aspect of whispers and that is, does it pick up on hooked/downed survivors? through my use of it I could never tell so a direct answer would be appreciated.

---
I know, just a word, but there are two “levels” already and two other things that some people also call levels. I just don’t want it to be more confusing
---
The full entries are online.
---
It's a default perk. You're not stuck for months. You're lazy.
---
Oh, not this "Self Care is bad" bullshit again. Healing self is just as useful, as it was in 2016. People just need to learn to prioritize self- and assisted healing.
---
You are not locked from anything. This challenge is on the side. It’s optional
---
I paid for the rift pass
---
It should be the dc symbol
---
What even is this?
---
I really like the attention to detail in the art!!! On this map, there are giant horse sculptures (the stand alone structures w/locker and a pallet) that have six legs due to the fact they are a composite design based on the fact in the Babylonian era, it was common to sculpt multiple angles and combine it into one composition. To get the horse from the sides and front point of view, they added 2 extra legs, creating a six leg beast!
---
I was so excited when I saw it! They really paid attention to such an obscure detail!
---
Why would you put an ebony and left the last escape?
---
You mentioned that you dont play survivor too much, which probably means you dont have many teachables. Therefore, I find it hard to believe that you still haven't found the perk in WEEKS.  Either you're exaggerating or spending bloodpoints on multiple survivors to find the perk (bad strategy) or you are spending most of your BP on your demogorgon and not enough BP into your survivor bloodweb.
---
Well that's a different thing from challenges
---
Mamma mia marcello un italiano
---
im referring to perks not playstyle
---
It is super unfair for survivors to play with a laggy killer, because on the survivors' end, they literally teleport backwards towards the killer during a chase.
---
They probably just dced because they couldn't stand so much lag.
---
What...? I wasn't being shady, I thought what you said was funny
---
But why were they there in the first place?

(Also I don’t mean to be *that* guy but it was a janitor)

I'm glad the first post I saw about it was approving and not someone having a tantrum about it.

I have to disappoint you, I've heard that with end of the Halloween event, the serum will no longer be available in the rift. :( But it's only a speculation, I'm no really sure.

---
Tbh you were in range of the attack 🤔
---
But you are that guy look what have you done
---
Not taking sides here, but you guys were talking about freddy as a Killer and its pretty hard to permaloop him, just throw down a couple of traps after the first loop they wont get to round 3 or have to abandon the loop.
---
*stares at hands in horror*
---
Can't get mad at perks I know are coming
---
The lighting on her face looks different at least
---
At this point its baseline for any company to do it simply because not doing it is more likely to cause a shitstorm then it is to list it and have people saying they are conforming or whatever it is.

Yes I still to get use to reddit
---
Bc I forget
---
You can run it with streetwise and grey bandage, streetwise actually got buffed not that long ago!
---
I saw it as a third state using R1 on PS4.
---
On PS4, for killers R2 is the attack (so M1 for PC) and L2 is the power (M2). And R1 is the third thing that only a few killers like Freddy and Demogorgon use.
---
Basically, he would turn intangible instead of invisible.

This guy is talking about sharing progress and people responds that cross play is cool lol

Yes, since archives released you now get 100 vault points and 200 pallet drop points when in a chase. That, and survival points for wiggle progression

Don’t you dare

I meant could you explain why crossplay would be awful
---
You say that but I remembered a game where my team were all working on gens and 4 done with ruin active
---
GOBLIN ARMY RISE UP
---
Hahahahaha shiiieeeet
---
Cross play between consoles - Yes (but can't be done for obvious reasons)
---
Cross play between PC and Console - I don't think so. It appears to be a completely different gaming landscape on console. for instance, on console I am a red ranked survivor and don't see constant spirits, billys and nurses as we are led to believe. The controls and fluidness of PC would give an unfair advantage. This isn't the answer to their matchmaking problem.
---

because they are talking about introducing it for normal matchmaking and PC players have a big advantage. It is a different game in the top ranks of PC.
---
*laughs in the bushes*
---
Lol
---
In fact, every killer deserves a buff. If in a chase the survivor is not downed in 15 seconds he gets teleported on to a hook and becomes broken for the rest of the game. Also any survivor that is doing a gen suffers from the exposed status effect for 60 secs for every second they are on the gen. Seems fair right?

Yeah I didn't said it but this is an awesome work, from a spirit main.

And again thank you,from a spirit main😂😂😂😂

This won't fix the huge disparity between the two.

Thank you
---
I want to make a PSA for the commenters here:
---
Genrushing is not a bad thing! I play both sides, I understand it's just playing the objective. However, it's still frustrating as Killer to have it happen, even if you stop chasing whoever you were to go after another gen.
---
This meme was all in good fun, I never meant to offend either side!

---
Without balanced landing you can only loop a house once. Other than that you are hoping that you will get a good rng variant of the fences.
---
All of the pallets are really bad and very far between. The car pallets especially are incredibly weak. Haddonfield without balanced landing is definitely not a good survivor map. 
---
&gt;(A) justifies that it isn't OP if what it does is cancel out a perk that lets someone worse than you beat you and
---
I don't understand why you think that removing someone's exhaustion perk only affects someone worse than you. It's an extra health state, it's going to help you no matter what.
---
&gt;(B) completely illustrates how it doesn't need a nerf if its only really useful on one map that huntress players will never bring a map offering for.
---
What? It's useful on any map, in any game where survivors use exhaustion perk (which is basically every game) it's going to be very impactful. Exhaustion perks extend chases significantly. Removing 1,4 or more perks from the match just because you brought an add on isn't fair.
---
&gt;but to complain specifically about huntress having it
---
The topic of this thread is huntress. We were talking about iri heads before, and I chimed in saying something about exhaustion add ons, since she has them. I'd say the exact same thing about Clown, Doc or Pig having them.
---
Then stop talking about this nobody
---
Or, as most other players I've spoken with seem to think, for the challenges that prompt you to play the game in a different way for tangible rewards.

It should be today

Nowhere near OP. The only perk you have that’s good is Ruin, but even then it can be bad due to totem spawns

Am I the only one who thinks the animated comic book style of the unlockable Tome cutscenes are a lot like Twisted Metal 2: World Tour's?

I feel like it's add-ons need a rework, one of his best add-ons is a common (Rat Liver) &amp; one of it's worst is a ultra rare (Red Moss), I wish there were more than 2 add-ons for shred, which aren't really that good anyway.

---
Pretty sad that you find an overused years-old joke that belittles NB people hilarious
---
I see this happen more often than not.
---
The Killer keeps expecting the Survivor to mindgame or do other tricks and the newbie just plays it straight. Throws them for a loop.
---
Its like the old trusim of a master of anything will not fear another master or amateur but will fear a beginner as the beginner doesn't know what isn't possible yet and is therefore unpredictable.

Yeah, shame it's so extreme though. I like Nea's cosmetics a lot, but I hate that her heads all boil down to "Do I wanna look like a sleep-deprived bulldog, or do I wanna be in Ru Paul's?"

You also get huntress for free

I have a hatred for DC's. If I'm a survivor and you DC, fuck you, you've condemned us all. If I'm a killer and you DC, fuck you, you've condemned them all. I never DC though god knows sometimes the games you get could quite easily drive you to it. Just see it through!
---
Whether focusing on injuries or downs is better is debatable even without considering that good survivors will do gens injured and wait for adrenaline.
---
Healing during a match is for solo queue dweebs that can't loop. (Only half sarcastic)
---
You can remap the controls, I've been telling my friends to do this for ages now but they keep on dropping pallets when they heal xD
---
P3 Tapp checking in....and checking out. Back to the fog.
---
Honestly, if they learn the meta and how to loop, it's not bad. I've taken my rank 15-19 friends into purple ranks before, and most of us escaped pretty often.
---
It's interesting how I am seeing quite a bit of spirits in rank 13.
---
*angry de-pip noises*
---
We established at the beginning of our conversation and multiple times throughout that I’m talking about going after wounded survivors, and that when most people talk about tunneling (in my experience from watching videos, looking for group posts I’ve joined, playing online with other people, etc) they’re talking about going after wounded survivors, not just hunting the same person the entire trial.  
---
You’re not acknowledging anything, you’re just arguing shit that I’m not even saying.  So I guess the thing we have in common here is that I’m giving up on you as well.
---
trappers story is really interesting so far
---
I HATE it. It's not fun for either party. When killing it's much more rewarding to track down the genny being worked on, rather than stare at a hooked survivor. Fucking asshats man.

Upgrade that NOED and Iron Grasp with Bitter Murmur and keep that Ruin. No survivor gonna like you after the match

I’ve been an addict of Iron Will for this past month. It has saved me a thousand times over! That, paired with Urban Evasion is (as the French would say) ‘je ne sais quoi’.
---
As survivor I crouch in front of their grandeur. As killer I do a head nod.
---
I agree with this guy, except matchmaking is still royally fucked. Me as a rank 6 killer trying to climb was getting matched with rank 2 SWF groups, which was so unbelievably toxic and frustrating (and the harassment was nice too) that it led me to calling my friend so furious I was in tears. Matchmaking still gets abused left and right. 
---
There needs to be changes made that lock you into getting matched, as a killer, with survivors in the same rank *color* as you. If I"m purple rank, I should not be facing red ranks. If I'm red ranks, I should not be facing green ranks. The only exception should be SWF.
---
I dont see the issue?
---
That’s awesome as hell but for some reason I gets sassy feels from Freddy due to his stance and his hand stickin our like that.
---
Yeah we have nothing that reloads or charges by walking or running so I'd like something like that.
---
Billy. And then the DC fest will start against him until BHVR says hes "overperforming".
---
Imo Billy is overrated and easy counter-able.
---
Ur mistake is assuming red rank survivors didn't get Nurse excised from red ranks.
---
I mean Freddy has always been [a little sassy. ](https://giphy.com/gifs/deal-with-it-sunglasses-freddy-krueger-PK7IAHdB0l9mg)
---
a LOT of killer stuff is overrated (Ruin) and easily counterable (Noed). Has that ever stopped survivors from whining about it?
---
True
---
Stop your pc isnt gonna have sex with you no matter how hard you try
---
It's kinda funny seeing all these nicknames (and Freddy) and then at the top there's just "Michael"
---
I know. The only good add on was when you shred, you destroye pallet but now its in the game. So bad addon
---
I tried to play nurse last night and failed miserably I hooked one survivor and everyone escaped 😢
---
Nah Nurse is down for the count. The basekit nerf is far more detrimental than the addon changes. Basically a cooldown on a double blink is 50% longer than the fatigue time a 5 blink Nurse went through. Think about that.
---
I think it’s so he can find traps, when you’re running it doesn’t show you traps.
---
There is a difference between “powerful” and “overpowered”. Overpowered killers warp the game itself and force survivors to run specific perk combinations while STILL leaving them disadvantaged, whereas *powerful* killers force survivors to adapt their playstyle while simultaneously letting them have relative freedom over their perks. They are similar, but there’s a subtle line between the two concepts.
---
In terms of Spirit, it’s as simple as removing Prayer Beads, removing collisions while phasing and a 2-second cooldown on her power. Oh and make Stridor make sense, so that Iron Will counters Stridor completely. These are my proposed changes and I stand by them.
---
If you use BBQ you can get 1 million Bloodpoints in roughly 20 matches as Killer. You need less than that to get a character to lvl 30 (where Enduring is).
---
You need more than 70 matches to get 2K Shards. 
---
You decide if it is worth it to buy the perk with Bloodpoints or spend Shards on it.
---
Sadly some people are ass. If I had a fun time playing as killer for the match I ease up.
---
Mah neme es jeff
---
Thats a good point
---
You know, I have to agree that I rarely ever see Jeff, but I do see Ash a fair bit more than was listed on the statistics. I also think Meg and Claudette are a little more tied up there with Nea. Claudette maybe even a bit less nowadays, if we factor the recent tome out of the equation.
---
If you buy a teachable you have it forever, but if you forgot buying it when it appears in the bloodweb you'll need to relevel them to buy it.
---
They could easily add support. Even custom buttons and swapping sticks would be welcomed. I understand the majority of console players wouldn't use it but they might just try and think it's better, I know that if given the option people couldn't argue about competitive edges in cross-play because it we have the ability to use keyboard and mouse
---
WOAH
---
Me and 2 of my friends played a game where no gens were done just messing with the killer
---
They go back to lvl 1, you have relearn any ability but it remains unlocked for everyone. Like buying them in shrine.
---
You don’t lose the teachable but you lose all the perks you unlocked for them, items, and add ons. They say there is supposed to be a bump in finding rare items or perks of your prestige but I think it’s a negligible amount so unless you want to bloody cosmetics it’s probably not worth it.
---
I’ve never foun him sassy I’ve always found him more of a dark comedian with a lot of one liners lol.
---
Prayer beads isn't even her strongest add on but that's all I ever see you guys complain about. Parrots and all that I guess.
---
Another argument I hear is better frames, but there’s probably no difference skill check wise between red rank survivors on console and pc. I guess it’ll just come down to playing against PC nurses and huntresses as a console survivor, and given the latest changes, that might even be cut down to just playing against PC huntresses.
---
"wait, hold on a second of bitch!"
---
Awesome thanks.
---
Right... Thanks, but I can distinguish the difference between two adjectives. What side are you on? You say it's good for the game to have powerful killers, yet you are proposing a number of nerfs to the Spirit - clearly showing she is overpowered.
---
Thanks.
---
Link? :o
---
I just want a rank reset button that I can use once or twice a week.
---
You do not lose their teachable they stay available to the other survivors after the first time unlocked.
---
Prestige gives you bloody cosmetics and they say a better chance at rare items in bloodwebs but people have tested it a few times and if there is a difference it wasn't noticable.
---
Prestige has no worth other then hey look what I did!
---
On survivor side I got all my survivors to level 50 and picked and P3 neabecause she was my first snd I wanted the trophy.... but I have ash now so I P3 him just because and will get him all perks and then I'm done survivor side they are all just essentially skins so may only play my favorite forever.
---
 [u/profanitycounter](https://www.reddit.com/u/profanitycounter/) u/leeemmmy
---
You speak about getting the teachable perk or getting a teachable perk for another survivor
---
How many games exactly?
---
4*
---
Man you guys really think every survivor group is a 4 stack. I've played as a 4 stack before and understand how strong it is, but have you ever played solo consistently at red ranks? It's almost impossible to win with a 2/2 split, 1/1/1/1, or 1/3.
---
Streetwise, botany knowledge, self care, empathy, then run a purple medkit with double charge addons (gel dressings and self adherent wrap) 
---
You are now the God of healing. You have a medkit with 3.5 base heals, but with an additional 58% (78% on self healing) item efficiency. This gives you around 8 full medkit heals, at the fastest possible healing speed in the game (for a medkit) oh and you can see injured people across the map. Very fun build
---
I have seen otz do some pretty cool meme builds with this. Synergizes well with perks like stbfl and PWYF becuase it allows you to reliably switch obsessions.
---
That’s because there’s a metric crap-ton of people who want to see her burn and want BHVR to give her the Legion treatment. This kind of mindset is dumb and unhealthy for the game, which is why, even though I agree that Spirit needs changes, I believe she should remain powerful.
---
He makes me horny
---
Have you heard of the pallet technic from Truetalent?
---
Lucky! Looks like console gets way more Ghosty Boi. Feels like pulling teeth to get him on PC.
---
Oh I see thank you
---
The purge in the mori looks a little darker than the green puke she sprays for Vile. It's not quite as dark as Corrupt but it definitely looks more like the damaging puke. But I definitely see your point, unless there's some special acidic property then getting blasted in the mouth with it shouldn't instant kill you. Still looks cool and kinda funny tho lol
---
I'm not sure what you mean so I'll just give a simple example. 
---
I level Feng to 50. Along the way I buy her Lithe and Technician teachable perks, but not Alert. 
---
If I prestige her, Lithe and Technician will both still be available in everyone's bloodwebs, however, because I didn't buy Alert, I will need to get her back up to level 40 and buy it. 
---
Does that make it clearer?
---
Plus he has a tough time on a few maps.
---
And that is all fine and dandy in FORTNITE it is a shooter and you benefit more in building due to better movement/modable keybinds for building etc...
---
DBD is far simpler game with limited movement, small number of keybinds and options there is some argument in Nurse, Huntress and niche argument about Hag biding teleport to mousewheel those are 3 killers out of how many?
---
Survivors can 360 and do everything else even easyer on gamepad then on mouse/keyboard no benefit there and we have higher more stable FPS (let's be honest DBD isn't that pretty of a game and it was suppose to be optimised on consoles ages ago...)
---
1982 the thing
---
Well we all interpret things in different ways, some of the things he does come off pretty sassy to me and he can also be considered a dark comedian. “Welcome to prime time bitch.” I will never get over that, absolutely hilarious.
---
Just level bill?
---
Spine chill is the biggest “fuck you” to prayer beads spirit and I’m here for it
---
Hi boi
---
Ho boi
---
Idk man nurse has still best ability to chase survivors even after nerfs. No? I guess hillbilly then right? Or legion
---
Actually we’re red ranks
---
So you admit she is currently overpowered?
---
I‘m not saying you aren‘t contributing to your team! I believe you when you say you‘re working on gens, but finishing gens isn‘t the only thing that matters. 
---
Of course being useless doesn‘t apply to all immersed Claudettes but sadly it is a majority of them, so if you main her you have to live with the way Blendettes are treated....
---
And speaking of looping, I‘m really bad at looping too and I still managed to get to red ranks, there‘s only so much hiding you can do in higher ranks. It‘s also way more fun to play a little more risky than play immersed all the time. 
---
If you are looking for quiet survivors I‘d recommend you play Ace, he is relatively quiet compared to other survivors. 
---
Of course playing other survivors won‘t guarantee you a free hatch but it‘d be interesting to see if sth changed playing someone else.
---
I just woke up early but still this sub needs to stop with this guy, like we get it he's a streamer
---
Ruin was there a couple weeks ago tho
---
Ghostface hair grabs and Myers goes for the throat. What more could you ask for?
---
That was just an example, it could have been anything else really.
---
Trial sorry
---
The meme there is that Legion, asides from the moonwalking exploit, was never good just godawful and I fun to go against. I honestly think legion needs some completely different ability, like they did with Freddy.
---
Probably helps them realise how diverse their audience is... More diverse questions could pop up in the future.
---
Could help influence any future survivors, backstories or cosmetics? Idk.
---
Where can I get this template?
---
No question that directly allows you to give feedback on rank system omegalul
---
Yes I thought that teachable perks appears only once in others bloodwebs... eg if you want head on from Jane on Meg it appears only once in meg's bloodweb
---
LMFAO he is kind of Shatner-esque, isn't he?
---
Wow rank 3 with wraith? you must be so good, please enlighten the rest of us /s
---
Steve Eleven
---
Love it
---
Yes we do but I just I can’t just shake my head around him being sassy. Just more of a dark comedic ass lol. 
---
“Welcome to prime time bitch” is a classic amazing one liner! 
---
God that’s such a good movie, I love the whole veins coming out of his arm like he’s a puppet. Jesus whoever thought of that is fucking brilliant!
---
I'd say Enduring is essential for every M1 killer. If you have only one slot in your build to choose between Enduring, Brutal, Spirit fury and Bamboozle, it's Enduring for me, hand down. But Enduring + Brutal is a great combo.
---
Steleven
---
I remember the first few times I played DBD and encountered a Myers. Was in the killer shack once and too scared to move while crouched. I spun my camera around to see Myers just standing outside and looking at me from the window. Much as the baby Dwight joke goes, we stared at each other a while before he tiered up and I realized it was time to start hauling ass. It was terrifying!
---
Idk about the color thing. You don't thinks it's perfectly acceptable for a a rank 5 killer to face a group of rank 4s? I think the +-5 thing is the right way to go. Maybe reign it in and make it +-3
---
Can't find them I Google archives lore entries leaked and it didn't come up with anything
---
I love this. I hate Freddy now so this really makes me smile.
---
Maybe he will get all the upvotes
---
Crossplay should be only for console. PC players have better FPS and controls as advantage.
---
I did bill for all of them because bill
---
Naw it'll keep showing up until you get all the perks.
---
Weird. I probably get one Plague for every five Pigs.
---
&gt; 3) The Killer cannot climb through windows and/or break pallets
---
*laughs in shack pallet*
---
\+-3 at the most forgiving. The difference between rank 5 and rank 2 is VERY stark.
---
Steve Harrington
---
Ok kid, read back then actually get a grip jesus christ
---
Strongest? Mayyybe not. Most annoying/unfun/least counterplay? Definitely.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Being free also helps
---
The issue isn't that her chase potential turned into garbage. It's still among the best. The problem is that her map pressure took a hard blow and there is too much forgiveness when playing against her. One juke sets you up to hold her back long enough for at the bare minimum 1 gen to pop. And that's all before dead hard, styptics, and any other shiz you can account for. There is, as of the current moment, WAY too much leniency against even a good Nurse.
---
dont let the door hit you on the way out
---
Xbox and PS4 crossplay... Sure
---
PC and Console crossplay... No
---
Thank you lol
---
As of last patch, wraiths cloak, pigs crouch, ghost faces shroud, and tier 1 Myers, all grant the undetectable status effect to their killers, meaning spine chill no longer bypasses stealthy killers when they’re using their stealth ability.
---
He's genuinely good, nice, interesting and informative and not a negative ass 
---
Seems like a recipe to be popular
---
Thought the wiggling mechanic was only to prevent killers from hooking everyone in the basement?
---
I agree with this in theory but worry about what it would do to que times
---
that's what ppl like to say just cause it is almost impossible to wiggle out but it can still be done.
---
Why does Freddy look like the Rake in a fedora and sweater?
---
Don't think there was a need for that snarky comment
---
So how much healing can you squeeze out of a basic Emergency medkit without add-ons now? Since you won´t really get add-ons with Pharmacy.
---
I am thinking about it, but I am running Inner Strength now and the 8 second heal after doing a totem that you can prime anytime anyway seems much better.
---
I'd rather have fewer fair matches than more unfair ones. 
---
You have NO IDEA how miserable it is to face down as Huntress with yellow addons against a 3 man Pinkie Nea squad with the OLD needles. (which has been replaced with flashlight clicking now). Only reason I got the Laurie was bc she WAS the same rank as me.
---
They just need to bring out better penalties to DCing. Right now you MIGHT get a ban if you do it excessively....nobody cares.
---
They need to give increasing timeouts. DC once, 2 minutes wait. DC twice 10 minutes, three times an hour. Or whatever, the times can be changed, but you get the idea.
---
[Memories](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Memories) and [log entries.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Logs)

Im just trying to be safe and heal myself. Then boom i dropped a pallet cuz im big brain like that.
---
Pig is worth leveling up imo, mid range killer with 2 good perks and 1 very bad one. Pig is also a tonne of fun
---
One word...
---
Cunt
---
Like damn, some people have messages disabled cause of toxic shit and others people have notifications disabled. People might also just not see them or don't want to farm.
---
Like damn, how stupid.
---
Because no one starts out popular?? You dint make a twitch account or wherever the fuck he streams at and suddenly have a fanbase that's huge. He probably got some sort if shout out or something by an already established large streamer or something.
---
Either way it doesn't matter , he's popular now and that means people are going to talk about him, just like they talk about the other ones whose names I dont know because I dont watch any content with Facecams
---
pharmacy
---
To bad rank reset is today
---
Tbh green toolboxes better than purple ones cause you can make them last longer.
---
Obv purp toolbox is still great for gen rushing tho
---
Your plague solution is basically what was wrong with old legion, she could just moonwalk for east downs.
---
Well all true but kinda other killers don't have same problem? I mean if it comes down to not having abilities and just using legs
---
This just be the work of an enemy stand user.
---
No i use a laptop
---
This was out of 106
---
Thats why you run sprint burst, so you can run from the gen to blind the killer!
---
That's valid
---
Looks like Steve has to do dish scrubbing duty
---
OP’s not talking about the perk being rare to find during a match, OP is talking about the perk being of rare(green) quality when it should be Very Rare (purple) quality
---
Shatner's face was the basis for Michael's mask, makes sense his voice is the basis for the narrator.
---
Lemme guess, Leaderface (Dwight) and Survivorface (Jake)?
---
Ok perks but nothing worth buying with shards
---
Nah it was hilarious
---
Whenever I see leather face in a comic he always looks so goofy

ur a wizard harry
---
yeah i just thought it was funny asf
---
Yep
---
yeah still pretty weird tho xD
---
I've gotten a nurse's calling and self care through the shrine, so it's great for new players
---
This is just you having shit internet lol
---
This is the new single from dead rabbits formally know as escape the fate
---
How are you getting that impression? You seem more than eager to hate on killers
---
I've been so close to rank 4 but I keep bouncing back and forth between rank 5 and rank 6
---
Myers bra and underwear
---
Bhvr where is it we need it
---
I haven’t had substantial disconnect issues since like March. Very rare in my experience now
---
Furtive chase might be one of the worst perks in the game
---
Yea iron is pretty cool, so is steel
---
Probably because she's a complete headache to play against good survivors and half her power is rng bs?
---
And what counterplay do killers have to maps full of umpteen safe pallets? None.
---
And if its an unsafe loop, one with no LOS and the killer can mindgame, hide the red stain etc, a lot of times its just a gamble for the survivor as to which side the killer appears at.
---
It says your the trapper but your the nurse and you used a Freddy offering? Wtf game
---
"are you done? Can I ring my bell now?"
---
JEFF UP
---
Mu answer? Are you typing from controller? My life is good, i have a 3k PC what the hell lol.
---
dbd costed 10 more on console, so its bundled with the first 2 dbd packs, which is basically $5+$5 to equal $10. Makes up for the price hike
---
Wait so what's the other paid pack on pc?
---
LMFAO, my thoughts exactly!
---
They honestly don't work as intended right now. They're very buggy, and seem to go off at completely random times.
---
hag
---
Put down traps around loops Not directly at the pallets and that's it, for the Challenge I Set Up traps at the infinite and shack on Iron works and went AFK, after that I Had it completed xD
---
Why no David king on which survivors have you purchased?
---
Thank you! The only nerf Spirit needs is something regarding Prayer Beads, that's it, and at base, she has a 15s cooldown, 110% walking speed, and can't see blood tracks (only scratch marks). If anything, some survivors don't want to accept that they keep failing for the mindgame AFTER she just used her power, while some killers complain she's too easy to get 4k's with (the survivors' incompetence is not their problem).
---
They nerfed Nurse, and after Spirit, they'll be moving on to Freddy, then Billy, and probably Hag or Plague (in which I'd stop playing). Make the other killers viable instead of nerfing the already  viable ones because some survivors would rather complain instead of actually attempting counterplay. 😒
---
Its frustrating as fuck on both sides
---
Are you on console? What rank are you?
---
God I miss Freddy. 
---
New Freddy is good as his own thing, but as a portrayal of Freddy Kreuger he just kinda misses the mark. 
---
Old Freddy did too, but he was closer, just missing a secondary ability.
---
I have around 500 hours too and quit a few weeks ago hoping I would go back but I am just done with the game, sure there are a lot of bugs but this community pushed me over the edge.
---
This community is just too toxic in order to have fun.
---
I feel so bad that they have to pay for her, imo she a really good killer to play as and is alot of fun to go against
---
Heh😂
---
It’s so good.
---
I personally hate playing as her, and don't really mind playing against her but hate the forced camera turn.
---
Doc main here. There is no saving you.
---
Poor wraith didn't actually want to play the game. Had a nice chat with some internet strangers though
---
I have no idea, but I know that even some streamers do it
---
I can agree with that. I'm sure it's possible to make a fun and good killer that lacks static counterplay, but we have yet to see one make it into this game, and I doubt BHVR knows how to make such a killer.
---
I'm a pig main lmfao nice try.
---
I had those frame rate drops too, especially as killer in chases, but now I have a new PC and it went away.
---
Game is not coded that greatly so it can stress your GPU quite a bit
---
I rather think it might come in a mid chapter update tbh.
---
then the distance between swords was much shorter. It's much bigger now
---
Eh when people talk about getting "only a little upvotes" its annoying but good format so take it
---
In the OG days I really enjoyed TydeTime but recently he doesn't play and when he does it's all salt. Otz is best boi though. I wish I watched his streams because he usually only uploads the really good/interesting stuff to YouTube.
---
I know I've owned a PC.
---
same heres to hoping for it.
---
The goblin army is approaching from the east
---
Yeah but you will only get the Medkit without add-ons from Pharmacy right? So that means one fast heal with Pharmacy without running any other perks.
---
Might be fun for a healing build with all the perks you mentioned, but for general use I think I will stick with Inner Strength.
---
If the WoW equivalent of lol triggers anyone I’m uninstalling life
---
Rusty shackles hag is nightmare to go against and a hella fun playing as, not as terrifying as scratched mirror myres tho
---
No, they really aren't great for new players. They trick new players into spending Iridescent Shards instead of Bloodpoints. Iri shards are much harder to farm and can be used to buy stuff that could otherwise only be bought with real cash, whereas bloodpoints will eventually be overflowing and useless.
---
New players don't know this, so they spend their slow-earned shards on stuff they can easily pick up later whenever they want... and when they do want a DLC perk, they're pressured to spend real money on it instead. That's the strategy to make money, which is why perks like Calm Spirit have been on the shrine 17 times and BBQ two or three times.
---
Damn I have like 300 hours and I feel like I play like hot garbage (I do) I can't fathom doing anything for six thousand hours wow
---
You have to do more than just kill them
---
That's not a counter. The Spirit can read that, depending on the loop and add-ons she doesn't even need to. It's a tool you can use to outplay her. I've done that since basically her release. It's nice. It's good. It should be considered. It's not a counter.
---
Yup, exactly.
---
Your makeup looks great babes
---
But 50k bloodpoints
---
That’s nearly impossible at this rank. I genuinely do not understand what you could possibly have done to cause this
---
ITS ALL CONNECTED
---
First time I tried I used it on Hag and on end screen I was Freddy but in-game I was Hag
---
I feel more unique maining Jeff now :D
---
Me waiting for tome 2 because the first part was finished within a day
---
I feel like the issue is that queue times are already massive so if you opt out of crisp pay when it’s implemented you’d be waiting days for a game
---
You must not, *bud*
---
This is obviously a problem very particular to you
---
Should have gotten a gamer chair my dude
---
Alright, i'll see about it
---
thanks btw
---
🖑🖑
---
legit so true like I was literally punished for not seeing a message, toxic af
---
I really don’t know if I should but pharmacy just for the fact that Quentin isn’t on switch. Only chance I’m gonna get to have this perk unless they bring Quentin and Freddy in the 3.3.0 updat
---
I agree, but to add to the bad, camping can cause you to pip and or rank down Alitalia and then you wont really play with true players
---
I don't tunnel and I don't camp, I just play lol. I hook, and then roam and look for more suriviors to kill
---
I actually just got a pip from it.
---
I’m sorry I can’t celebrate my victory
---
Um I'm allowed to defend myself that's not being childish.
---
Just a tiny little one. Pointing at him breaks him out of stealth and sets him on fire or something
---
I’m glad my Boi Adam gets played over Ash. Lol
---
I was hoping today
---
I just wiped them all out before even one gen and got a pip, but I didn't get one from those last 3 games??
---
So you don't think console players should be able to use mouse and keyboard for the nurse for what specific reason. Why shouldn't a console killer have the same capabilities as PC? Do you think nurse is easier on mouse and keyboard? If so why shouldn't console players have the option.
---
"sleep-deprived bulldog" GIRL you could be on Ru Pauls with your shade-throwing abilities xD
---
When I started as the pig it was extra easy to get people because she's strong it's not a matter of time it's just the way it is..
---
Imagine saving a mori for higher ranks for no reason OMEGALUL
---
It’s because of the Mori. You’re not getting enough hooks
---
no
---
I said, both of you, that guy was already being childish by making a snide insult that makes zero sense here anyways, whilst you can easily be the bigger person and not give in to an obvious bait.
---
Not just that, what the fuck are you wearing
---
It happened with non-mori games too, I played 4 games, didn't get a single pip
---
And then you pipped and rank resetted back to rank 17
---
I just know the drill
---
Mori'g people kills your emblems and can stop pipping but honestly i have no idea how you arent pipping at brown ranks. Red ranks has kinda dodgy pipping reuirements but not brown ranks
---
Right, I’m 20, I’m Gen Z, if you want Boomers, r/theDonald is right there to trigger you.
---
I always use deerstalker no matter what
---
1.5 hours from now iirc
---
If you’re playing games where you’re getting 4 hook sacrifices I highly doubt you’re not pipping up. Especially at rank 20
---
Lol European High Rank Survivors on PS4 are actual tryhards. I took a 10 month break after the Legion Chapter and when I came back Gen Rush was insane even on lower Ranks (which wasn’t like that at all 1 Year ago)
---
It looks like something grom Don't Starve. I like it
---
I love the Temple of Purgation. The sounds when you're in the center under the arch, the altar beneath, and if you look up it just reminds me of the Tattered Spire from fable, one of my favorite games. 
---
I hope one day they go back and rework it, so it's not in the Red Forest where it doesn't belong. I'm also not a huge fan of a Generator electrically powering that ancient gate in the Temple.
---
Nice
---
Lol is Ace really that Quiet? I never noticed
---
He wasn't calling you weak. He was talking about the pig being a weak killer herself not you.
---
my friend just played a game where he looped a Freddy for 5 gens and then got facecamped
---
in the postgame chat Freddy said he was “bored of chasing him” so he only wanted him and was gonna let the rest go
---
Even using a good killer isn't a free win.
---
I know right, spooky isn’t it.
---
Assume you play mostly survivor if you say it's relaxing.
---
Well I am, that or one person disconnects and I get 3 instead
---
His name is 'troll' trolls are typically incels. That makes sense and maybe you can stop acting like the almighty morally righteous and let people defend themselves how they please.
---
I have 200 hours and red ranks still seem far away, but I was so proud for reaching 10 this past season.
---
I only play for a couoke of hours 2-3 times a week though
---
He needs a little buff somehow so more players wold play him  I love this doggo
---
Wow that was awesome lmao
---
unrelenting is good on spirit when you still arent very good at her, nurse too
---
Hmmm I'm willing to accept that if I can insta mori while he's on fire.
---
And what rank were you when you started playing Pig? Because she is used so little, a lot of newer players have only gone against her a handful of times. I have 250 hours in the game and have seen her three or four times. This skews the results as when you get to the top ranks, where tier lists actually become relevant, people know how to play against her.
---
Today
---
Ohhhh okay then I apologise I read really bad :l
---
deal
---
I want to both upvote and downvote this.
---
*okee dokie*
---
I’m not, there’s rules here, like on every Sub-Reddit, typically everyone should be the bigger person and simply report childish remarks and ignore them. 
---
Attacking me isn’t getting you anywhere, it’s making you about as bad as them now. I’m defending common sense and was defending you even, continue to assume things though, I was handling the situation appropriately.
---
Really don’t know what to tell you. If you’re hooking everyone at least twice and keeping them off gens and winning chases you’re guaranteed to pip up. If you’re not camping at least.
---
What exact reason does that make sense though. That's kind of just saying PC killers will always be better when in fact they could just give console the optimization. I know on console my controller gets inverted about 1/3 of the games I play. If you read the recent shit or the last part of the post that was edited. Why not give each player on each platform the same capabilities if it's crossplatform.
---
No I thought it was funny since I'm a claudete main bc I have all the perks on her and I wanted to main Jake but it would take awhile so once I fully pregtige everyone I'd main jake
---
Honestly feels like crossplay is becoming standard and i really hope it does, being able to play with friends who do not have a good PC or only have it on console/mobile and a few other things would be amazing along side cross saves for if they ever do matchup mobile players/pc players and sofroth - can play on the go!
---
Also, population increse that could maybe help with getting things more smooth :P
---
nice! now just give me a ghost rider cosmetic
---
Heh,thank you🖤

She's not good. She's below average, no decent chase power. No good map pressure. Only 5 reverse bear traps that don't activate at the end of the game. The only decent part of her kit is her crouch since she gets a free hit assuming they don't see you or have an anti stealth perk like Spine Chill. But crouching everywhere makes her super slow which means more gens get popped, Might as well play wraith. She's not good and the only people who say she's "one of the strongest killere" are green-yellow ranks. Best killers are nurse, spirit and billy. What do they all have in common? Chases end super fast. Great map pressure. Not m1 killers.
---
You’re the only one upset
---
It’s very obvious what you’ve done, you have almost no chaser points which either means you got all your downs by traps, or you camped the hook. You also didn’t hook them enough, you probably hooked each survivor once. You don’t want them to die on first hook, at least 2 hooks each person at your rank
---
Just because Spirit is considered a top tier killer, doesn’t mean that when you’ll first play as her you’ll do great. I’m a fully-prestiged spirit and I’ve played her for like 5 months now. I still lose games since I can’t locate survivors right with her phase-walk or if I even have stridor because it messes me up. Trust me, we were all bad once, and it doesn’t always go the way killers' want it to be. Hang in there. &lt;3
---
Lol yea I only bring out the blendete when some one deverses it
---
When I started as nurse or hillbilly I probably has downed a survivor by the time you walk to them, so I don’t understand what you mean.
---
It was great before the lawsuit. Way better than DbD. Then the lawsuit killed it and DbD kept going
---
This has been my issue playing Myers. I need to figure out how to farm points in other ways because just chasing and hooking leaves me stuck at level 20.
---
*Sad Oink* 🥺
---
Yeahhhh, make up be like that
---
It may or may not relate directly to me
---
God it’s super annoying
---
If he wasn't wiggling you should have gave him hatch.
---
It wouldnt be this way if swf wasn't overpowered in red ranks
---
It is a nice thing to add though. People want to be included and honestly, if a company doesnt have the option, I dont throw a fit. Sure it sucks, and I email saying “hey could you do this if it isnt a hastle” and I get a response saying thanks for asking and sure. 
---
It is just a common decency to be inclusive. 
---
Honestly I see more jokes from nonbinary people about only having two genders listed than being upset. 
---
I like that dead by daylight made me feel included. It is a great feeling when a company does this! So thanks at the dead by daylight team!
---
Myers is the narrator confirmed
---
Oh OK don't worry I'm french as you can see in the clip so sometimes I need explanations for English jokes
---
Was thinking the same thing
---
So you camped. Listen I play this game a fuck ton and know the system. Staying near hooks loses you chaser points. Your chases weren’t too long I presume because you have decent gate keeper. So this means you stayed near hooks and you just confirmed it.
---
how tf are u getting any points on her? it’s annoyingly hard to get deviousness due to her ability. that’s like one of the main reasons I stopped playing her.
---
Buff enduring to how it was before DS Gamers had it to neutered
---
Even if I understood what you said I wasn't sure
---
Tbagging when using a glitch smh
---
Yeah so your point is anyone who thinks pig is not strong is bad at the game, without giving any examples, evidences, supporting arguments whatsoever. Sure, great post, have a good day!
---
Well I think a bit of the differences would be in sensitivity, how quick a killer/survivor can react to the other. That's just from my view. Even that isn't that big, but some people make such a big deal of it.
---
At the end of the day, it isn't much of a difference, it's really just people making a big deal of it
---
She got nerfed because she was TOO strong you need to learn how to play as her before you can even attempt to say 'buff' she's a very strong killer.
---
"Disconnecting is totally fine." - BHVR
---
my first game against Billy I was the only one left of my group (we were a three an swf who all bought the game 4 rounds prior). we were all terrified as I was crouching around the bushes on the swamp when we see Billy charge acros the other end of the map, and all snicker and one of my friend goes "nyoooom". That game ended with the first long chase I was in, and we were all mega stressed. it became a solid memory because of it. we still call him nyoom from time to time.
---
Is It true?
---
Forgot where I got it, but look at those master challenges!
---
Demi was right
---
It's very easy.
---
'ight, i'mma head out
---
no wonder that freddy lost what a shit show of a build
---
Okay salty you too.
---
She was phasing so she didn't see that no spirit feelings were harmed in the making of this video
---
“Learn to play” - she hasn’t been good for a while mate.  Add my steam, same as reddit name. I’ll show you how to play her. She gets stupid unnecessary nerfs, like no exposed on dashes when they are harder to hit, like wtf.
---
I was new so I didn't know it's and old clip
---
Solo survivor is so frustrating sometimes. I had a game last night where the killer got devour hope up. I went down in one hit because there was enough tokens on it and get put on hook. While I'm hanging there I'm watching all 3 of the other survivors off in 3 different corners self healing. You're already exposed such a waste of time. I then got facecamped out of the game because I was the only one that knew where the totem was.
---
I would like it if they just made WGLF base kit for all survs because of how much less blood points survivors get
---
All of you are wrong! It was Jeepers Creepers this whole time!
---
I’m literally hoarding ultra rare light bulbs because I’m scared of the flashlight challenge lol
---
[Looks like they made them even harder than the datamined challenges for tome 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dh664v/full_list_of_all_archive_challenges/?st=k2xelwjm&amp;sh=afdab40f)
---
Wonder why they did that. It's like they heard all the feedback and decided to make it even harder.
---
I wasn't too happy with the specific survivor challenge, since I usually skimp those in the daily rituals (my Claudette was lvl 1. XD)  Sure, I'm losing out on potential points, but eh, I only have limited time to spend on this, so I may as well just make it as enjoyable for me as I can.
---
I don't need to I already know how to and it's pretty fucking easy.
---
You aren’t done, you’re still here. You’d leave if not
---
sometimes I mindgame myself the most against rank 20 potatoes, because I would assume they would play around the loop or pallet and I react accordingly, but instead they really just simply run in a straight line most of the time. While I'm here trying to double back, hide my red stain(as killer), or manipulate my scratch marks(as survivor), and the other person probably doesn't even realize I'm doing this and it works in their favor.
---

---
Pallets bugs can also be annoying for survivors
---
There are 5 free killers in the game and only killer-specific challenge is put the same survivor into a trap x times...
---
This is what yall get for nerfing every killer into oblivion so 90% of them are nonviable in higher ranks
---
#1:Claudette
---
#2:Tapp
---
#3:ash w/ ashy slashy
---
Did you camp?
---
Your chaser emblem and your devout emblems seem really low.
---
Yeah but she’s still dog shit. Just need to revert the unnecessary nerfs that weren’t needed
---
Also you're complaining you can't play well as her while telling someone you'll show them how to play as her LMFAO
---
much obliged
---
that doesn’t answer my question. her dash attack doesn’t give enough points compared to others, and it’s definitely more situational than something like the demogorgons. you also get like nothing for putting helmets on people. how is it easy to get points on her?
---
thank you good sir
---
Okay? Good for you that you play this game a lot, but so did I. I didn't camp any hooks at all. I just finished a huntress game and got the same kind of scores, with a "-1 Proximity to hooked survivor", I'll even link the screenshot if you want.  
---
Link:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/eeQgrwn](https://imgur.com/gallery/eeQgrwn)  
---
So stop being a smartass, because you're not correct at all.
---
Same! Logging in and finding out that its not unlocked yet was very very dissapointing!
---
imagine assuming people have a dlc.
---
I get salty because you cannot talk properly? Nah I know better than that..
---
No one said they can’t play her well, you just assumed that. But then you’re too scared to play against my pig. So like... you’re too closed off. Lost cause
---
lol pretty sure he knows what it is and was just trying to make a point
---
Giving her enough points and buffing her mechanics is different I thought you meant that.
---
Check the link I sent below to show that I don't camp lol.
---
Who downvoted the truth? Why would BHVR give away paid perks instead of slowly forcing people to buy dlc? Lol
---
That's sounds better than buffing I'll agree on that
---
You see that the op cannot say anything other than, it’s easy, it powerful, without elaboration. He is probably trolling or something.
---
you said she’s one of the easiest killers to get points on, while she’s definitely not.
---
I like to insult people after they've insulted me.
---
"Me waiting for it only because I want to get the free cosmetics fast to look spook."
---
I am definetly not a fan of how the tomes text has been presented so far, not to mention the narrator.
---
For me I still get a lot idk if that's to do with experience though
---
Honestly I think some killers might just hate prestiged people and try to kill them because the killer thinks the prestiged person is too much of a threat.
---
YOU ARE THE PROBLEM, look. Bronze on all 3. Your chases are too long. And you aren’t hooking enough survivors. Like seriously open your eyes. -1 proximity, 1 survivor found. 😂😂😂you need to listen because you don’t play this game much. You’re getting bronze in all emblems but gatekeeper bc you go against bots
---
Thats the joke
---
you dont, unless you’re getting potatoe survivors who let u dash hit them every time.
---
I don't really see gen rushing as an issue unless you really get caught up chasing someone and the gens being completed are well dispersed.
---
The gen spawns in this game are really shitty at times with 3 gens very close together. If you pick out 3/4 closely grouped gens at the start and focus on keeping survivors away from them, gen rushing isn't an issue.
---
Agreed, the community is very toxic. I’ve actually only just started playing killer (for the Archives and Rift) and my first few matches I experienced what everyone is stating, it’s not fun. I drifted through matches focusing on completing Archives and only had fun a few times with some good matches. 
---
Even today, I played once and it turned into abuse, took down one survivor, hooked them, went over to a nearby generator they were working on and damaged it, went back just as they were being unhooked, caught them, then everyone started ramming me, trying to block the hook, I was swinging left, right and centre. Hooked survivor DC’d, everyone else ended up getting downed trying to test me, they all DC’d for being petty and childish and not playing it right. 
---
Then one of them (the hooked one) had the audacity to start abusing me in my messages stating I was “camping” and calling me many colourful insults that I rolled my eyes at in their predictability and pathetic lack of creativity and blocked them. Again, because I was trying to play a match, only did two things and then they all started losing their minds, running around like headless chickens, trying to break the match and I killed them all for it, as I should, I’m the KILLER!!!
---
I love being Survivor way more but there are matches where team members DC as well and ruin the entire match, I had one where I was the only person left and by that point just pitied the Killer and gave them a chase, dropped my item for them and let them kill me. 
---
They need punishment for DC, big time. It’s ruining matches and the Game itself, it’s becoming a recurring behaviour and it’s not being done with any good reason except for a small minority of occasions (like other toxic behaviours being engaged in by either parties.)
---
Oh and of course there’s multiple times where I’ve just seen blatant toxicity in this sub-reddit for differing opinions and posts, it’s crazy. I even posted a story on here once regarding a match I played that was pitiful with this kind of behaviour and I was the one attacked by Reddit for stating what is plaguing the game being a Killer. And I haven’t even been Killer for that long!!!
---
Sometimes I wonder if the majority here really are 10 year olds based on behaviour alone, like JEEZ.
---
Well aren't those people fun to be around
---
A lot of the DBD fanbase is cancerous and toxic but here we are. Undertale is an amazing game, seriously worth playing.
---
ive been rotating between pig, demo, freddy and spirit (only because i leveled her up to 35 to get haunted grounds and now i have a ton of pestula pedals.  cant let those go to waste)
---
pig and freddy are def my 2 favorites.  demo is very similar to freddy and i CANNOT land that lunge attack with him to save my life.
---
Having two separate match making will just make queues worse. Maybe if they do the cross network that would be feasible.
---
Yeah, although I feel bad when I do that. It feels kinda cheap.
---
I call alot by their actually name
---
Like Evan for trapper
---
Amanda for pig
---
But for some I go off their killer name so hagatha, fredward etc
---
I kind of hate that a term has evolved for this, since obviously survivors aren't doing anything wrong, it's literally the only objective. I think the complaint has always just been that gens go too fast if survivors are disciplined and stay on the objective, really annoying that it was turned into a term that makes it sound like it's this scummy "strategy".
---
get hit, drop it, dead hard into me, get hit again
---
Are we really complaining about the difficulty here? Complaining about the level 4 difficulty has *some* merit. But this? Give me a break
---
I'm at rank 4 survivor and rank 14 killer (or I was before the reset today) and it's literally every other match I get a DC. It doesn't matter if I'm playing survivor or killer. I'm glad you haven't had to deal with this! It's pretty crazy
---
Ussylis is the best and funniest for me
---
Then do gens.
---
An M1 killer is an example of how to make a strong killer...? Freddy is ok at best, but definately not strong and much less viable.
---
I'm not really complaining about these, but it seems weird they cranked the numbers up.
---
How am I the problem when you literally just said that I go against bots lmao. Half of the people in my games disconnect the moment I hook them for the first time, do explain how I control their PCs to keep them in the game?
---
I mentioned this during level 1 and people got mad at me, saying that too many killer specific challenges would be unfair to some people
---
There have been too many times where I start to chase you, blink and suddenly you are fucking gone and I am think "Wow I am a dumb ass, they were right in front of me" and then you drop a pallet.
---
Whats funny is making people lose holiday items they've been saving all year
---
Yea at that rank I'm not to worried lol. Now make em 2 and 1's and its more time
---
That's it. Oblivious. My bad. Long ass day for me yesterday. That shit has to go for him.
---
and then you play against a plague and want to cry, lol
---
I mean, you're not wrong. Ghostface is my other favorite.
---
Iridescent gatekeeper with all other bronze. Shows you struggle in chases and that you only 1 hook them. But they do no gens. Learn the emblems mate
---
today
---
doesn’t rank reset just mostly put you with people who were around ur rank before, because the lower people also had their ranks reset?
---
Same as the other one, credit goes to wherever this came from, I just found it and shared it.
---
And that’s if we keep our FPS capped
---
Let's burn this up.
---
Laughs in Claudette with High Visibility Jacket on.
---
Oh okay, so not "targeted." He just couldn't catch you and then defended his only hook at end game
---
lmao
---
They just need to make them somehow good. I like Wraith and Myers but I never play them because I like to play the game, not just get completely demolished with no chance of winning.
---
I kinda agree. I do like the challenges, it really makes you play this game for a reason. However the rewards really suck. The only charm I like is the arcade one, for the rest they all look really basic and boring. The cosmetics are also pretty lame imo. The auric cells and putrid serum are alright, it's very logical I think, but I definetely expacted more from the cosmetics.
---
Overall this is their first archive. I personally find the challanges really fun! I hope in the next one they bring out better cosmetics, and maybe even something new. Emotes for survivors would be cool (obviously not like fortnite dances, but maybe a waving hand, a finger snap or a frightened face would be funny). 
---
If the next one will be like this one I will be highly dissapointed though
---
I don't struggle in chases at all. I end them quickly. I literally had a game about an hour ago where they didn't even get a chance to do a single gen. I got a pip from that game.
---
OP literally just told me that my doubts about his story were totally correct
---
Before the change, the problem was opposite, where low rank killers were abused by high ranking swf members. While it is regrettable that your group suffers for it despite meaning no harm, many, many others abused it and it turned away the killer players. Stick to KYF if you want to show them the ropes, don't drag them into ranked, then it's on you if they get ultra murdered.
---
Stop acting like a know-it-all when you literally don't have a clue lmfao
---
I haven't played the game in 3 weeks, I am still a member of this sub because I like to be up to date with the game (DLC's, reworks or anything new) for if I come back.
---
And I never said I was done with the game, I said I quit for a few weeks playing it, I even said I wanted to come back. That's not the same as saying I am done forever.
---
I think people vastly underestimate how long it takes to learn how to do seemingly routine or simple things in this game. You show me the player that can consistently hit great skillchecks in just 100 hours and I'll show you a DBD savant. Hell, I have almost 1500 hours and I'm still only hitting greats like maybe 40% of the time. It's not even automatic for streamers who literally play this game for a living.
---
Actually, it's more like GET THE *BONG* OUT FRANK! you see, bings and bongs are two very different things
---
it does, but everyone is at such similar rank at that point that there’s a good chance that on the first day of rank reset you get a mix of everyone
---
&gt;Escape the trial without being hooked once with Spine Chill.
---
oh no. There will be a MASSIVE influx of Blendettes running Urban Evasion, Distortion/Sole Survivor, Left Behind, and Spine Chill literally DOING NOTHING the entire match waiting for their teammates to die to grab hatch. If they get downed they'll just DC to jump into another match and try again.
---
Finished 👍
---
Yes the game with trapper they struggled with gens because iridescent gate keeper. Look up the emblems because you’re talking nonsense
---
Bing bong, k you ding dong
---
And you shouldn't react that way either. Just because I'm an excellent English speaker doesn't mean I don't speak other languages. I've taken multiple years of French, German, Italian, Spanish, and a year each of Latin and Arabic. I have a knack for learning other languages.
---
That said, the original line is a movie quote. It's meant to be funny.
---
why tf do they want us to get multiple unhooks during end game collapse? do they forget killers are usually super defensive if they down someone at that point?
---
The confusion is real
---
I use predator a lot.
---
He started off just on YouTube. He only started streaming relatively recently. Why are you triggered by people liking a streamer? Lmao
---
Imagine the worst killer game you've ever seen. Now imagine a survivor main doing that game blindfolded.
---
That's me with the Pig. I can admit it. I'm so bad on her it's boinkers. 🐽
---
It looks like all they did was kill and chase. They didn’t place a trap or kick a generator/pallet
---
So it's a bad meme then?
---
They might be doing that to compensate for making level 4 easier. They said they may change level 4's difficulty
---
Aight man, whatever you say. Go talk out of your ass elsewhere lmao.
---
As a killer I usually feel bad when I get a 4k against a swf and see that two of them are below 11. There's no way they stand a chance against red ranks, but how am I supposed to tell in the heat of the game.
---
Immersed survivors isnt exactly an uncommon thing, ill be bored af during that challenge though
---
They changed that, it works on tier 1 now
---
Yeah, pharmacy is more for a looter meme build, just add plungerer's, ace in the hole and use a purple coin offering. Loot all the chest quickly.
---
idk, I have started playing some months ago and I already have, Spirit Fury, DS, Ruin and Haunted Grounds from the Shrine. No need to buy Spirit or level up Laurie
---
However this week's perks suck lol
---
Red rank queues are really good right before rank reset. That's when most players are at their highest ranks. Red rank killers are also prioritized whenever a red rank survivor queues in SWF, no matter the rank of the other survivors.
---
Honestly I would love too, but there is very little incentive to look up other than to see Jane Romeros ass as shes healing me.

He’s literally the deadliest killer based on stats the devs release. He’s easily top 5 after his rework.
---
haha wow. rin's mom voice is deep
---
yes!
---
So uhhhhh.... spirits father?
---
That was a pro gamer move.
---
Just to make sure no one gets the wrong idea, cross progression rarely means cross-purchase. Xbox, PS, Steam, etc all make money off the purchases, so if you bought DLC from one source, you probably have to buy it again on the new platform.
---
You are correct in your edit. They counter aura reading, spine chill picks them all up now.
---
Sending to my lower-rank friends.
---
This, and a cake.
---
No apology is sufficient apology at this point.
---
these extra difficult challenges are the reason why i'm not buying the rift... i'll never finish them all. bhvr pls, let me give you money.
---
at the point where you have sole survivor, distortion, and left behind all on the same character, you should be able to play the match normally and just try to survive instead of letting ur teammates die. the hatch is super inconsistent, and anyone trying this  strat for that challenge would be super dumb and probably useless anyway.
---
here comes the demon samurai
---
New killer: The Mask
---
New survivor: Jim Carrey
---
It's called out of the blue everyone started only talking about him and it got annoying fast. Like we get it, he like stbfl
---
Why do they put perks from base game killers in the shrine? How does that make any sense?
---
Spirits dad as a sort of witch doctor thing i guess. 
---
Cool, have to say really hope the next yamakoa map is better .
---
If you look closely, you may notice that this teaser seems to have a connection with The Spirit
---
Is it actually gonna be spirits father wtf. Ill reserve judgement until i see what it pans out to be but so far im dissapointed
---
The Alchemist and it is Rins Dad for sure. Trust me, this is the internet.
---
We just got original one this March with the Plague. And where does it say it's gonna be Spirit 2.0? It could work entirely differently than Spirit for all we know. I for one won't judge anything I see it in action.
---
I'm going with The Oni. No clue what the power could be though
---
lmfao no
---
Literally bring back something like legacy prestiege.
---
Seeing how the Entity can grab people from different dimensions there is a possibility of a "what if" chapter where the Entity indeed took the dad and Rin was left unchopped. Would be hilarious to see a match with 5 rins in it though.
---
Or we could get the mom as a survivor and the whole family can be together trapped in the entity's realm.
---
Idk maybe we shouldn’t jump to conclusions bro
---
Can't wait for Joe to be the new killer omg
---
no shit sherlock, but at that point you the killer can find it first and close it. if u get gens done, you can find it before it opens and just let ur last teammate die.
---
Guess you didn’t see the classic skin that’s being released today
---
You know he’s been waiting his entire Reddit life to do that
---
Try 1.1K
---
Please use the pinned Megathread.
---
lmao imagine if she were to be a survivor and she got nerfed not the killer one
---
IF DEVOUR HOPE IS UP WHY ARE YOU WASTING TIME HEALING? YOU'RE GOING DOWN IN ONE HIT ANYWAY UNTIL WE CLEANSE THE TOTEM!
---
because its worthless to make it if anyone can complete it. Not everyone needs to be a participation trophy. Not to mention completing it makes it impossible to gain new money from future rifts cause its a constant recycleable 1000 cells
---
what?
---
Listen here, I am so damn tired to meet always Spirit in my Survivor games that, at this point, I'd welcome her father: they are going to be busy with each other, trying to solve their family arguments, so, for once, I will be peacefully left alone and able to work on those damn gens without risking heart attacks because of her grabs!
---
No, what I was doing was leveling other characters, like for example I wanted to play doctor when I first got the game. I didn't want to play nurse, so I didnt level her, but I checked the shrine one week and saw a nurses calling, and for me at that time it was a better deal to spend 2k iri shards, than to put 1m BP into a killer that I would never play. 
---
I hope that clears it up
---
The Oni is also a good guess, nothin else it could really be tho "The Father" sounds boring af, but I'm gonna go with a activatable rage ability that can make him break pallets and do literally everything faster im guessing, i think hes going to be a killer based around chasing and early game
---
Can I have a link to the survey can’t find it
---
Bill does have 1 cosmetic outfit, although is part of a pack and Bill's skin can't be bought sparatedly so you have to get the pack.
---
&gt; I think its sorta cooler that it took both.
---
I'm with you on this. However, I think survivor Rin would be rad. Peak Entity is to bring in her human form to have her tortured by her killer form
---
So a "survivor" that is also the killer. Alright then.
---
they're downvoting me because they can't handle the truth, this must be how Jesus felt
---
The Oni makes sense. I can see The Samurai, too though. I can't wait!
---
I don't commune with childish comments
---
The joke really flew over your head..... r/Woosh
---
It does feel lazy, all the things they could have gone with and they do this. Let's wait and see I guess
---
What’s joe?
---
Yeah I don't hate the idea of it, I'm just surprised.
---
AFAIK, the Entity can take people from any point in time, so it's possible to have a pre-incident Rin, or maybe someone from the father's past.  Doubt it'd be someone related to Adam but that's potentially on the table too, I guess.
---
Now I'm thinking of all the other characters referenced in the lore we know...who else might we see at some point?
---
Not sure why people have been dancing around this, but maybe there won’t be a new survivor. They’ve already set that precedent for a killer only chapter with Ghostface
---
I mentioned it MULTIPLE times in other threads, if you;d had bothered to read them, you'd have known, neither did you ask about it, both of which are entirely your own fault.
---
ok
---
Me neither, hopefully he isnt too op or underpowered, I have a really good feeling about this chapter, the stranger things chapter was amazing, maybe this one will be two in a row :)
---

Why is everyone assuming that her father would just be a replicate killer lmao BHVR knows how much Spirit is hated.
---
poor mother would be chopper around by her daughter or her husband
---
Pfft you moron, this is obviously a pennywise teaser
---
Alien gender when? lol, it's funny to see companies adapting to this bs
---
You mean to tell me the DbD community will always find a way to complain? I'm shocked to my core.
---
Efficency is how long the toolbox lasts, higher efficency lets the toolbox consume charges slower letting it last longer.

Oh my god I'm sorry I just assumed cos I've been posting memes lately a lot xD

who shit in your Cheerios today?

Keep disliking my posts real tawk I hope your family dies in an automobile wreck

Not if you bring a key, since Left Behind shows the hatch's aura from 32 meters away.

Again some survivors are braindead and I expect when Tome 3 comes out, EVERYONE will be complaining about the Blendette Apocalypse. Survivors will complain about there being so many people doing nothing the whole game, and killers will complain about at least one survivor DCing every match when downed or if the killer is Doctor.
---
Sloppy, which gets played enough, but also... _Bloodhound_. I lose survivors in chases, but now I don't. Blood trails ending at the feet of lockers make me happy. The chases are inevitable.
---
I’m really hoping it’s just a demon that wears that Oni(?) mask than Rin’s dad.
---
Usually it says by your hands when it means mori from what I have noticed.
---
Efficiency affects how many charges from the item you expend per second.
---
Normal efficiency means you spend 1 charge for 1 second of use.
---
But let's say you have Tier 3 Streetwise, 25% Efficiency bonus.
---
Now if you're using an item, you're only depleting 0.75 charges for  every second of use.
---
Undertale isn't quite a horror game :/
---
I'd be fine with a skeleton or a lich, though.
---
That definitely seems like something the Entity would do, especially since it feeds on strong emotions like hope and despair - imagine being taken to a nightmare realm where you get chased down by an evil naked ghost version of yourself.
---
at the point where ur doing all this to survive why not just do the objective lmao
---
I mean, I didn't expect them to actually have Rin’s father for the next chapter, but I'm all for original Killers. I can only hope his power is distinct enough from Rin's.
---
Excited to see how this shakes out.
---
Oni, time reversal
---
The one sweat in the party chat "YO WHO TF CLEANSED"
---
 [https://imgur.com/gallery/FZyoaTs](https://imgur.com/gallery/FZyoaTs)  \-The game with no leavers. So instead of insulting me and calling me a camper right off of the bat, use your words to actually ask, or your eyes to read the other threads. Thanks.
---
Just because it could be her father doesn't mean the playstyle would be the same.
---
Haha I just typed how I read it, got a chuckle out me to be honest so no harm done lmao
---
It honestly did.
---
speed is different
---
Speed = increased amount of charges per second, 80 charges over 80 seconds normally instead at double speed its 80 charges over 40 seconds.
---
Efficiency increases the amount you get done with charges. So 80 charges gets you 80 ticks of repair, but 100% efficiency makes it .5 ticks of the toolbox for every 1 charge of repair, essentially giving you 160 charges
---
All those numbers are pulled out of my ass, but the idea is the same
---
I'm a rank 20 killer but have 220 hours of survivor within the past month. My experiences tells me that you'll rank up regardless of current skill if you have the foresight to think of your plays as you play, as well as adapt your situations each time you learn something new.  
---
Even losses have valuable insight within them.
---
If it's not the dad and it's the spirit 2 I'm gonna cry in disappointment.
---
See? All you can do is insult others. You cannot take on any arguments. You cry like a baby “No, I won’t listen, she is strong”. While calling others childish. How pathetic.
---
Tracer from overwatch as the new killer, but how would time reversal work?
---
You haven’t answered my question, you just restated your position. Why does other people having what you have make it worthless? If you buy a $10 skin that I also buy, is the skin now worthless?
---
But Google says
---
&gt;It ’s yours and Yamaoka ’s.
---
I had hopes that chapter 13 would bring Jason
---
His tp has cooldown based on how many survivors are asleep. His snares only work when you're asleep. His snares have the same slowdown as clown, which is a terrible killer. You can loop him plenty and finish all the gens before you get to use all the pallets if you're somewhat good survivors. Freddy is still weak. Not as weak as before, yes. On par with most killers, yes. Weak, yes.
---
&gt; Not to mention completing it makes it impossible to gain new money from future rifts cause its a constant recycleable 1000 cells so the devs have an incentive to not make it easy
---
Does anyone know which mask that is?   
---
I mean, there's a man speaking, I know, and it's very likely that it's the Spirits father. On the other hand, we know that he slowly turned insane and maybe this happened solely because they owned a "haunted" mask or something like that? When I googled for the mask I found this:  
---
Red Hannya and black Hannya are so jealous that they have lost control and even kill people and eat them for the grudge. This is the personality of the Hannya in the theatre piece, Kurozuka (黒塚/ black mound).   Jealous is not something you can control. Even you know it´s not good but it can convert a woman into a demon. And if Hannya is one of the most important characters in Noh, that shows that the jealousy has been around very long time.  (Source: [http://www.iromegane.com/japan/culture/a-little-history-of-hannya-mask-why-its-so-scary/](http://www.iromegane.com/japan/culture/a-little-history-of-hannya-mask-why-its-so-scary/) )  
---
And this mask represents a female demon?
---
Very exciting!!
---
I definitely feel you on this. I played 2 matches last night on the first one had a teammate immediately DC because killer was Plague (dc had a healing build and medkit). I then ran the killer for 3 gens and then caught. 1 person ended up escaping through the hatch, killer cut us no slack because of the dc (which is whatever, they are the killer). 
---
The second match was a teammate that DC'd against Spirit because they were pulled out of a locker in the first 2 minutes. Followed by the most camped I have been at Red Ranks in a long time. I just decided to be done for the night after that. It isnt fun for either side when someone disconnects and the game isn't balanced for 3v1. It can be done for sure, but it is an extreme uphill battle and there should be a penalty to people who leave matches.
---
What are you talking about? Have you even ever seen the movie before? The mask is just a mask until Jim carry puts it on.
---
I wouldn't even mind having to repurchase the game so long as I knew my stats and cosmetics would be there
---
I always do this when I get nervorous...
---
Is painfull -_-
---
WAAAAAAA
---
Yes that is part of your comment, you are correct in that is something you said. Why do you keep dodging the question?
---
i think its definitely possible that the whispers her father head were from an Oni rather than the entity, and thus the killer is that demon
---
I know I'm hyped. I can only hope his chase music is just "PEPSI MAAANNN" extremely loudly.
---
Chapter 14 new bug: bloodstains disappear twice as fast but after 2 seconds everything around you lits up, got it.
---
So... he thrives on injury? Thanatophobia made into a killer?
---
seriously that theory was so braindead lmao
---
Makes sense now why the roadmap for year 4 didn't include a map for chapter 14. Well played bhvr.
---
Truth
---
Grins in Calm Spirit.
---
Thats a really nice suggestion!
---
I figured out it was because of having early disconnecters, been having people disconnect after hooking them once a lot thanks for the suggestions and such everyone!
---
I feel like its expanding upon a character the fanbase enjoys and expanding upon their lore within the realm of the entity if they choose Rin's father. With them adding more story elements into the game for lore lovers it would make more sense to spice things up and expand upon character already made rather than creating a bigger licensed base. If it is truly Rins father it goes along with the whole story they've been creating. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Spirit is the one most in depth storyline with many other characters that aren't licensed. So, thusly it makes sense from a marketing and story aspect to make it him.
---
What part am i dodging?  Im telling you why its worthless
---
She just has a cold
---
oh look it's the teaser for SpiRiT ReWOrK
---
I don’t see how it wouldn’t be Rin’s dad considering he was originally chosen by the Entity but it chose her instead. The Entity is probably all like “ you know, I may as well just pull him in as well since he also shows potential and has even proven himself by killing his wife and daughter”
---
Not gonna lie, I originally wanted the father over her so this is pure hype for me and them linking killers together like this is a new concept for them and I’m living for it.
---
He' reverse spirit. You can let you body go forward but your spirit stays on the place (and camera too)

All online translators suck.

---
Thank GOD, someone gets it
---
They do?
---
Doubt.
---
1. The insta-down people are talking about refers to lines of code containing "one_shot". But these are also lines of *audio* code, so they mean that the sound plays once per activation.
---
2. These leaks were only found very recently, yet BHVR have been working on Chapter 14 since the release of Ghostface. Thus the "crazy" status is more likely in reference to the Killer for Chapter 15, who I speculate to be The Alchemist.
---
So what you are asking for, from what I can infer, is a big ass monster. A killer that due to his size/stride moves faster than other Killers, but can't fit into smaller spaces/windows/loops, and tires out easier.
---
Sounds interesting-ish, but every generator in a building (even killer shack), jungle-gym would be safe. The killer would not be viable at all on most maps (but might do surprisingly well in Coldwell).
---
I only clicked on 1 of the links. 1+1=3, I told you I saw 2, but hey you expect me to read you blabble SJW shit.
---
Quentin is my boy &gt;:)
---
Thank you!
---
Could take it with Spasmodic Breath (115% for 60 seconds after a Blink hit) or the combo of Play with your Food and Matchbox (a permanent 105%, going up to 120% if you get max stacks). For comparison, the former is T2 Myers and the latter is T1 Myers.
---
I'd ask u/Otzdarva on stream, but I'm working on saving enough Common Fruits to remind him of the Iridescent King Doctor game (unless I missed it).
---
btw you may not know - Jim Carrey is the *actor*, well known for starring in films like "*The Number 23* and "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective*. He is not actually a character in the movie. The more you know!
---
Obviously 1 gen isn't enough but OP is suggesting he deserves more points for diversion because he was running the killer around while the rest of the survivors did gens. For anybody who doesn't know diversion is something awarded to you for diverting the killer while gens are being done as to offset your inability to do gens while being chased
---
I don't understand what you mean by this. I didn't mention either of those things, but fair enough lol.
---
Im thinking it could be Rin's ancestor. ( The samurai who owned the estate)
---
I think the spirit chase music made by Jon Rob will be used for the new killers chase music imo
---
Loops incoming
---
Yeah, Adam's only connection is that he was taken while in Japan, right?  That's why I think it's pretty unlikely.  Who knows what might show up in the Archives lore though...
---
LMFAO, what has SJW got anything to do with another set of game stats? Seriously, grow up, you're such a child lmfao. You can't count to 3, simple as. Too funny.
---
Totems seagoing design yo
---
(Tried to type “totemo sugoi desu yo”. But auto correct changed it)
---
tho her father would be a badass killer already doubt they would do that.
---
Exactly. Even shitty PCs get a consistent 30 fps, but I know people can easily get 200+
---
Exactly, that's my main gripe with it. I'd rather see someone new in the lore. The mask looks cool tough.
---
Get outta here with that bigoted crap, dude. Not cool.
---
Fuuuck I really wanted to mori the father as spirit. -. Not liking the odds of that being a thing rn tho.
---
Plot twist: It's not her dad, it's her distant ancestor who originally wore the mask
---
1,3k*
---
No one called you an SJW, didn’t even mention it what’s wrong with you??
---
it’s okay, all those smacks fueled this art
---
Furthermore, just because YOU didn't click on the link, doesn't mean I only showed 1 game, I showed 3, but because you have the brain of an ape, you can't seem to wrap your head around that, it's your own fault you didn't click the link, not mine.
---
I think really msot survivors are not connected to the killers at all. Just because they are released together doesnt mean they have any links
---
Glad to hear you're having fun!
---
Ignore any salt you get and keep slaying!
---
Cynical part of me thinks that maybe they’re running out of ideas, I kinda thought this already since for rework Freddy and Demo they gave both a bunch of mediocre powers instead of 1 good power like the rest of the killers. And also that Spirit has one of the least interesting lores of all the killers, just my personal opinion. 
---
Optimistic part of me thinks it’s cool that they’re exploring the lore of the characters. And this will almost certainly make Spirits backstory more interesting.
---
Jeff painted a mural of the Legion, and he got taken by the entity when he went to visit them one day.
---
Only pathetic if he enjoyed the sequel.
---
You good man?
---
I actually have a rebalanced emblem system for all of them since a lot of them miss a lot of good factors for each one and emblems like unbroken are completely static which could be improved, I only have survivor emblems atm but I'll probably end up scraping it since the game is such an unbalanced mess
---
Thank you! I almost missed the doctor skin thank you very much!
---
His Mori is grabbing them by the arm, flinging them up, then hitting them into space with a tennis racket.
---
"  but hey you expect me to read you blabble SJW shit." ???
---
I mean yeah but new survivors shouldn’t be punished for it also. One side suffers either way
---
It's not too much of a tie in, but they've interacted. Basically someone (probably frank) asked jeff to do some art for their gang up in the lodge at mount ormand. He painted a mural which had bloody letters that said "the legion" and he got paid for it. It's in his backstory
---
It's been a long past couple of days...
---
Dear god stop it with this show! It's not that good and these memes are shit!
---
They outright say that the person doing this is a Yamoaka.
---
Sorry, laddie.
---
Guess you'll have to deal with it.
---
Also don't forget that the mask is the "Hannya" mask, wich represents a jealous female demon in Noh theater.
---
Underrated comment
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if this update came with a slight spirit rework
---
What's the one with the baby mask in it called again? classic
---
Oh cool, I never knew that part, thanks for telling me!
---
yeah, thats evidence that the killer might be Rins father. and tbf its entirely possible that he will be the killer, and that there will be no survivors, since the last chapter had 2 survivors
---
... at least empathy gets insane value? Idk yeah that would for sure ruin this build lol
---
Sh**t that to graphic for Bhvr.
---
In her defense, you get kind of cold when your organs are in multiple rooms at the same time.
---
Shit my guy I know. My pipes froze last night, my house has no heating, and I'm slowly dying. Shits rough man.
---
Pretty cool idea to use something from the japanese folklore. A japanese survivor would be pretty cool aswell. :&gt;
---
Depending on what you play on, (Steam allows you to Family Share games) you could create a new account and just play a vanilla loadout so they can play killers their rank and you arent bullying some new killer. I did this myself to play with friends that are new to the game so they wouldnt have such a steep learning curve.
---
It's less about fights happening and more about seeing gender options like non-binary normalized. I wouldn't ever throw a trantrum if the option wasn't there, but if the option is there, then yeah I'd praise the devs for caring and putting it
---
Dementia?
---
Everyone thinking it might be papa Spirit... What about Rin's mom?
---
Incorrect, it's obviously The Nun smh
---
Yeah I was kind of getting hyped for The Alchemist as a killer, but this opens up interesting potential with the lore, which I'm also interested in, so I can get into this as well.
---
What would we call him, The Oni?
---
You don't TP for every pop hit. Just when you need to and know your able too.
---
Survivors are asleep most of the game... so.. the second point is moot.
---
Snares on both sides of a loop and running right though the middle will always catch the survivor. They won't make it to the other side unless they drop the pallet early.
---
&gt; You can loop him plenty and finish all the gens before you get to use all the pallets if you're somewhat good survivors.
---
[Not at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5uUUAz7m1U)
---
Just because hes not as powerful as Spirit doesn't mean hes weak.
---
Most common killers you see?
---
Her Pervy Uncle who killed her father to avenge her anime tiddies
---
Mori is he shoves the muffler and tail pipe up the survivors ass.
---
Smoked one too many cigars.
---
Son of the Mask.
---
Rins mother with a mutilated body as a survivor!!!!
---
That’s your fault.
---
some of u guys are stupid. being related to Spirits story doesnt mean they'll have the same power??? her power is realistic because she is dead. she is LITERALLY a spirit. neither her dad or the demon are dead, and them being dead isnt a vital point of their story.
---
Feng
---
Dwight
---
Meg
---
&gt; the killer will have an instadown
---
It's not an instadown, that was referring to music files.  Basically telling the track to play instantly.  The crazy status is real though, the killer has multiple states and it also extends to the weapon as well, so it's not another M1 killer.
---
Rin’s pervy uncle
---
Spirit is allowed to be strong. I just want her to be less annoying as all fuck to fight. A simple directional phase sound outside of terror radius and mayyyyyybe remove collision when she phases, and we are fine
---
Just hook him if your gonna kill him that hard
---
Has the developer published win rates for different perks, killers, maps, etc? If so where?
---
Comedy is subjective.
---
Seeing the predictions of my friends slowly come true is kind of interesting to observe. I look forward to the PTB.
---
BP is not directly intertwined with emblem scores
---
Link? I've not seen anything that concrete.
---
The most I've heard is the dialogue in the teaser "Your blood belongs to the Yamaoka"
---
She also has a render for her Survivor counter-part made out there somewhere (made by a fa i think)
---
Tromaville?
---
Okay, so, allegedly, based on the datamines, this guy has an instant down ability, as well as some sort of Madness status effect.
---
So, it's really looking like this is Rin's dad, given that he went nuts due to stress and committed murder.
---
Everybody is acting like this isn't true but it totally is lmao. I'm rank 10 survivor now after rank reset and somehow even my rank 12 team mates are hot garbage. First game back we got wrecked by a trapper with self resetting traps. I did 2 gens by myself and got 2 heals and hook save tho so I pipped so I  don't mind. Just don't go in hoping to escape.
---
Jackie!!$ one more thing!!!
---
Bless this man
---
Lol I'm the really altruistic I sacrifice myself for others even if there randoms unless they farmed or didn't save me.and btw you can be super altruistic without self-care and inner strength you just have to be smart about it I use but if I'm feeling nice.
---
Dude, if you don't like it, then ignore it. We all have our opinions, I use it sometimes because the show does have some stills that can make for some good templates. I admit I've spammed a lot over the past few days, and I'm toning it down, but it did seem appropriate. The show was great in my opinion, a lil cringe at times, but the art style is amazing imo and it's not all that bad.
---
This would be the most Meta reveal ever and is now the only theory I'm accepting from here on out
---
Entity: "Yes... NOW I look like a normal human female..."
---
They were apparently working on Chapter 14 when Ghostface came out, and the stuff you're talking about is from a recent datamine - odds are, that stuff is all for Chapter 15 (Alchemist, hopefully) and not 14.
---
Chapter 14 is obviously just an announcement for a new spirit mask cosmetic.
---
Lol claudete morel is a nice survivor she blends in if your nija mode
---
The skins aren't part of the event technically. The serum will remain on the rift for as long as it's left (I think like 55 days now). You have until then to earn the serum and then I think you get 2 weeks or so to spend it
---
His wig got SNATCHED
---
The Entity did originally choose him but Rin was an easier target to turn to its whims because of her lust for revenge. I guess the Entity didn't want to just go back on its original plan with her pops anyway. 
---
I'm guessing Rin's mom is the survivor.
---
I know but.. I‘m still fascinated by how you can be truly disappointed about something you don‘t have enough informations about to judge.
---
OH WHUT, IT‘S SOMEHOW JAPANESE?I DON’T LIKE SUSHI... Chapter is going to be diSaPpoInTinG for sure guys!
---
They'll just be floating, no longer attached. Just like the rest of her body parts.
---
If you have been playing since nurse and never had any crashes you are insanely lucky. Hopefully you can get it fixed.
---
New Killer: The Daddy
---
New Power: The Belt
---
First of relax you child. Emblems are self progress not team progress you potato
---
Eventually they will but I wouldnt pay much attention til actual changes are announced, they often take months/years to actually change things.

It’s funny but I have probably 2000 hours plus and I still suck lol
---
I just wish they had expanded a different part of the lore, just a personal opinion
---
Yeah I guess you're right...I may love the show too much...
---
have you ever gone past tier 1?
---
You leave
---
Myers is the only killer that cant bloodlust because his power can boost his speed
---
I like you theory I guess we just have to wait It could be Rin father we just have to wait or it could be a nerf for spirit.
---
It runs pretty good for me but there are some things like David King’s face doesn’t fully load in in the lobby and it takes a little bit for some characters to fully load in the lobby like when I play demogorgon. There isn’t too much lag in the game and if there is it is mostly not noticeable.
---
...But why wouldn't that be lazy, too? This being lazy was your criticism
---
I want the killer to be called “The Oni”.
---
Simple sexy inclusion. This made me happy to take the survey.
---
I’m shocked that survivors don’t look behind themselves when they’re running and just throw pallets blindly. Pallets are precious resources.
---
Love the artwork thumb up.
---
Thanks man, finally a comment with some itelligence. Yeah it's pretty rough, it seems like if even one person leaves the game when I'm playing Trapper, I don't get enough points to pip. Playing Huntress again now and it seems to be going better.
---
sami deserves more recognition
---
Not really the point my point is that it is very possible to get a decent rank using a poor killer.
---
How cool would it be if the new killer is Spirit's dad and the new survivor is Spirit before she got slaughtered
---
I wish we got Kuchisake Onna somehow. She would be so terrifying.. But I doubt we'll ever get her.. Considering with this chapter we'll have two Japanese killers. At least I'll hope we get a Japanese school map, or a dark Japanese mansion.
---
That would be awkward as hell, if someone is playing her as survivor but they go against a Spirit
---
Your original reply was only
---
&gt;dude it's just a joke.
---
Look at all the shit you edited in. I only just got done wiping my ass too. I wonder how much you'll add in by the time I'm back from work if you added in 2 full sentences in the short time it took to wipe my ass.
---
Watch Ussylis and PainReliever, they're pretty much the reason why I learned so much about the game. If you're interested, there's a spanish guy called ReudigRuediger. He's the best surv I've ever seen and I improved soooo much watching his vids
---
Rank reset is the reason I find it hard to get back into the game because I’m gonna be rank 20 because it’s been so long and it’s not fun bullying poor players that are new to the game
---
Imagine a killer who starts as a survivor,  then after a short timer becomes the killer. 
---
Probably couldn't really work in practice,  but it seems like a really cool idea to me.
---
 this is why i think the killer isn't the dad but the ancestor, the red masked warrior using the katana to kill the tiger on the lefted illustration. And the bloo soaking in the mask is the blood of Rin and her mother. So it makes sense to me that he is the spirit of the family, revived with the blood of his fallen family. HEre to get revenge and give back his family's name glory and honor over the atrocious act of his descendant, Rin's father.
---
Finally...SATAN joins Dead by Daylight. Getting all the Licenses pogchamp
---
It’s a counter play to the spirit, after doing a certain amount of steps it will become possible to done the mask and kill her.  Most likely all killers. 
---
Similar to the steps needed to kill Jason in The Friday the 13th game.
---
I mean
---
You're right though I hear it only from edgy memelords
---
I'm of course talking about survivors.
---
My comment as it currently appears is the only iteration it ever had. I You're either in the grips of a fever dream or trolling, but either way you're being insanely aggressive for no reason at all so I hope your mood improves
---
BET
---
Also another person's and I don't see you asking them
---
So the entity took rins dad after he went full psycho and hacked her and her mom into pieces
---
Level II out?
---
This is my bet as well
---
Yea its fine we all get like that with something we like at some point. no personal hate towards you id just suggest switching up ur meme templates  to keep things fresh:))
---
Nice job, even without a shattered Katana
---
out now
---
I thought that legion also killed Jeffs dad
---
It'd be cool if it was a shogun or oni.
---
maybe a female demon who took the body and blood of Rin's mother ?
---
Okay, this is epic
---
The reason they don't up the gore is it would complicate content releases in certain countries that are tight about graphic violence if I remember correctly. It's why the Demogorgon just thrashes the survivor until their neck snaps instead of straight-up biting their head off.
---
exactly my thoughts ;)
---
Yep, had to restart the game to see it
---
Sucks for you, I'm hype as FUUUUCK.
---
I did ask them, actually
---
Eh, I like it. [the fandom toyed with the idea of survivors turned killers before ](https://aminoapps.com/c/deadbydaylightd/page/blog/survivors-turned-into-killers/7ej2_nKxcPu467KQQKdDB2DjK0MRKlB2eR8)  (there’s amazing art and perks/powers ideas), and I would rather have the OC killers expanded on than another licensed killer
---
If it’s her dad, his powers are not going to be at all like hers, although maybe the map added will be only an expansion of the Yamaoka one. If they are basing him off an Oni, then the concept is great and it adds depth to both her story and the Entity’s realm
---
Rin, Wraith, Nurse, among others, are killers that evoke empathy. This could be setting a start for a survivor Sally, with someone from Spencer as the killer, or survivor Philip, villain Azarov (idk). It would also be amazing to see survivors turned killers
---
just go full bubba's basement build post-rank reset and you'll get them pretty quickly. (agitation + iron grasp + any 2 other perks)
---
If you use snares right, most pallets become unsafe as fuck and he can get a hit off. He can definitely end chases very quickly with his power, hook them, tp to a gen and regress with pop. He can get around larger maps faster than billy and nurse ffs. He's easily A tier.
---
Looks very nice!
---
Small tip, if you cut a lower arm in two you will see two bones (radius and ulna) instead of one.
---
I think Bhvr has to take a break from license killers and come up with their idea because when they do it great most of the time don’t get me wrong I think licensed killer are great but Bhvr should take a break for a while.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong sorry for getting away from the main topic.
---
Came here for this. Thank you.

I don't like him because he is just another player with 2000+ hours who dominates every match as killer. I love seeing newer people play, or meme builds, not this dude getting a 4K every match while being unemotional.
---
Ill be guilty sadly.
---
I dont wanna play as claudette 😭
---
Interesting theory! :)
---
Google translate is notoriously unreliable. I'd take anything it gives you with a large grain of salt
---
So she is living for another year?
---
What's the entire outfit called?
---
The Quentin is not fugly enough.
---
Looks like he's actually had some sleep....
---
Source? This looks like an interesting read.
---
Hannya are more typically for female demons, Oni masks, which the one in the trailer looks much more like, are for male demons, generally. 
---
The third eye is much more indicative of an Oni as well. 
---
Given the killer is likely male from the voice, the emphasis on blood and all, and the Oni implications, it's definitely more of a rage mask, I would say.
---
Honestly, could be me. Started playing again quite a while ago, play mainly killer but still got to rank 9 with survivor, and yet I havent seen her once. Like, if I ever play against her at this point I'll have no idea what im doing. Apparently cleansing is bad but thats pretty much all I know about her.
---
Okay, that's a "relief".
---
not to sound like an entitled memelord, but you should have used : [] after “new survivor”: and blank
---
But (unless the system screws up) rank 10 survivors should never go against a rank 1 killer. If they *decide* to play with a red rank survivor then they are also deciding to test their skills against a high rank killer.
---
Killers have no such option, so the SWF balance should be against the highest rank (as SWF is already super strong compared to solo)
---
Sorry for my ignorance but is that like a Japanese demon? I have heard the term but cant remember what it really means
---
Classic Ghost Face.
---
Spirit doesn't need a rework, you Survivors are just salty!
---
I'm a huge fan of Agitation. It's fun to get free hits or even free downs on overconfident survivors thinking I can't hit them.
---
I really don't think that's true.
---
Coulrophobia gang can finally (probably not tbh) shine!
---
Firat off, fuck off
---
The implication is that it is considerably easier to run spirit and win then a killer like trapper.
---
Tbh, I think they have a pretty good handle on making balanced killers now. Freddy’s rework was legit and so was Nurse’s. I’m not afraid of them destroying Spirit
---
Fucking child
---
Recycled content PepeLaugh
---
I think in the lore most survivors just sort of crumble away and vanish once they give up hope, although some might end up as killers, like the Alchemist.
---
Quentin at the left corner being useless as always
---
Dead By Daylight wiki, that lore was confirmed in a dev stream
---
Can you show all the new challenges?
---
You're the douchebag idiot, and ypu edited your comment because it made you look like a jerkoff
---
what show is this?
---
The iridescent addon ideas actually sound like they would be interesting but i don't think anything Else needs to be changed

---
Rip i was waiting for this outfit and didnt know when it came out so i got impatient and spent all my cells on a spirit outfit last night :,).
---
Yeah, I know, but honestly I really want them to just say "fuck you guys" to those countries. Or just release timid versions of everything for them. 
---
Gore update is one thing I will continue to wish for and likely be forever disappointed on, and I'm okay with that, haha.
---
Well why do you think
---
this isn't very convincing lol
---
Survivors are crying on Freddy already, because reasons.
---
Nurse became extremely unfun to play actually, especially against those who knew how to juke her before nerf. You get punished for anything you do in a trial and it feel awful.
---
I am the 666th upvote
---
Everyone wants to know who/what the killer is. All I want to know is their speed and power. It could be Thomas the tank engine for all I care as long as the power is new and cool.
---
Survivors doing their objective.
---
idk tbh, this tome is trash
---
Thanks for your tip,i appreciate that🖤
---
Ah hello Traveling Yoda
---
Blarg!
---
I added to it, didn’t change it. Still 1 gen isn’t enough. You need to relax you man child
---
Even worse the level IV challenge requires that you do 4 gens. Killer and teammates must be complete potatoes
---
He unlocked commando pro.
---
Big spike in challenge difficulty.
---
Time for the botany and self care combo.
---
Hang in there my man
---
Yeah Jasmine, I don't think that's smart. It's common sense to spend the Iri Shards on things that can only be bought with Iri Shards (Payed DLC, cosmetics) and Bloodpoints that can be grinded much easier can go towards things that can be unlocked with BP. 
---
There's nothing truly "wrong" with it I guess, but it's definitely a poor way to spend your shards, and I wouldn't encourage any new player to fall into that trap. Everyone should keep Shards so they can save real money, rather than the instant-gratification of unlocking perks they already had access too. Imo.
---
FIRST MATCH OF THE SEASON AND I ALREADY [GOT TUNNELLED SUPER HARD](https://i.imgur.com/l8arFS6.jpg).
---
TO MY TEAMMATES: SORRY FOR THE BORING GEN REPAIR SIM EXPERIENCE, I DIDN‘T ASK FOR SO MUCH ATTENTION.
---
TO THE KILLER: YOU PROBABLY READ THE [RECENT REDDIT POST ABOUT TUNNELING BEING THE ENTIRE POINT OF PLAYING KILLER](https://reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dvb9sl/unpopular_opinion_tunneling_is_the_point_of/) - I HOPE YOU’RE NOW CONVINCED THAT IT’S A POOR AND BORING STRATEGY.
---
oh, I see. That makes sense, thanks :)
---
I bought the classic outfit the minute I opened DBD and saw it. I didn't know it'd be available so soon cause I've been behind so it was a 10/10 surprise. This day is starting off fucking great so far.
---
I don't think it's extreme, though I would probably just tell them to play without me.
---
Yeah for sure, I don't think the playstyle would be the same that would be a total failure, but the theme and backstory will be redundant.
---
Yes. [Here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests).
---
Just nervous speculation on my part!
---
Wow! I can't wait to play the horse; It's a great idea and very well balanced! I wouldn't change anything
---
Best part about his Mori is he pulls out a rose and puts it in his mouth before he performs his Mori.
---
I can't wait for a new killer to kill my whole noob team with NOED because they camp the hook and watch the idiots run right up. Hopefully he has a stealth ability or better yet another teleport.
---
I'm surprised you saw even one Quentin and that Tapp is played more than Jeff.
---
Nurse just requires more skill. Even more than before, but she’s still the strongest imo.
---
Survivors just don’t like a challenge. The reason why Freddy, Nurse, and Spirit feel OP to them is because those killers don’t limit players like other killers do. Just because you play as Spirit it doesn’t mean that it’s easy to 4k with her. It just means the player isn’t limited by shitty game mechanics. The 4k isn’t given to you, it’s earned
---
Oh well
---
Afraid he'll be sucked in
---
Play with potatoes
---
We had one a few months back that was posted here on the sub and on the forums. You may want to dig around and search for “Statistics/KillerSurvivor Data”
---
Bloody coil: BOING. Tremendously increases lunge range
---
I see iri shards as a bonus. Every week you can earn 2000 easily, even more. Spend bloodpoints on characters you want and for those who you don't want to, wait their perks to appear on the shrine

1 doesn't show anything. 2 is showing stuff from the other 3 points. 3, the teacher was 19, the student was 18. 4, VivziePop apologized and said she shouldn't have drawn the picture of the snake and person, and she said it was cringe. 5, she apologized and said that she no longer supported the said youtubers. Dear heavens man, that's an old post, and there's not any proof when you look at the points. People change and really the only thing that she actually did for a fact was draw the beastiality stuff. This is getting old how people will dig up old, and false facts about someone to hate them.
---
Killers can fuck up regardless of rank, y'know. If I really wanted, I would go to red ranks without much issue. Yet earlier, playing as Legion, I picked up someone, under a pallet no less, knowing full well there was a claudette right by who was just unhooked and had a flashlight. Guess what happened?? -.- 
---
It's just people behind the screen. They will make mistakes/bad decisions. Maybe not all the time, but they will. And they're going to have days where they knock that shit out the park over and over again too.
---
If they release Rin as a survivor I can't wait to immediately see the spiderman pointing at spiderman meme plastered all over this sub
---
theory: the trailer shows the entity reversing time (blood pools receding, candles relighting) to grab rin before she was near death so she can be a survivor :)
---
They can be taken at any point in time, but arent they essentially removed from existence at that point? It doesn't really make sense to take someone to another realm and then their future still plays out. I dunno timey wimey stuff I guess.
---
Very aura perk unfriendly though. There could be 3 survivors doing gens on different corners of the map and I'll be lucky if I get a BBQ reveal when hooking the 4th.
---
SWF
---
Oooooo, awesome!!
---
Pretty much sums up most of the fanmade killers i see on here.

Because you're a transphobic asshole. Just wanted to make sure.

Yeah just stfu,you've managed to prove your a pleb on multiple posts
---
No problem:)
---
Have you not seen the 4th tier at all yet? It's gonna get worse, trust me.
---
Of course it is.
---
Then why were u asking what it was?
---
That's lame af
---
They must mean killer and killer?
---
I've worked for a company who did that. I wouldn't be surprised. They just put it so it wouldn't cause a shitstorm but don't take the answers into account
---
My theory is that the new killer is actually Rin's Mother, seeking for revenge
---
Don’t be triggered, you’ve embarrassed yourself. Don’t stop the salt now, keep going I was enjoying it
---
inb4 killers with full slow down heals
---
That’s what I wanted to do but the killer rage quit.
---
I know it will get worse but those are likely place holders.
---
Alright you can either take my argument with a grain of salt or just stick to a piece of my point that has nothing to do with my reasoning?
---
woah!!! 20 hours a week? calm down there mr esports gamer
---
ckech you're fax bro, this ain't wraitH
---
Well then it's better you're rank 20 right, that way you'll have a better chance of readjusting to the game. But yeah, maybe give it a few days for the ranks to become more balanced again ;)
---
i assume we can use a medkit while having self care right?
---
+ resilience
---
Why did we get a ghostface outfit which looks a lot more like the movie ghostface as MTX-content and not at release date? 
---
What kind of greedy tactic is that?
---
After reading over both back stories I can't find evidence that legion was involved in his father's passing but maybe I'm missing something
---
oh i like the animation and the show i just have issues with the creater dude  and i aint here to fight
---
&gt; arent they essentially removed from existence at that point?
---
I think it's like a multiverse thing, considering we have characters being pulled from points in their story that "canonically" continue, ie Laurie, Steve, Nancy, and Ash.  Multiple dimensions makes more sense to me than the Entity making copies of people, or something like that, since most of the survivors vanished and were never seen again.
---
Just like Steve he has the meme outfit
---
Tennis aces waluigi
---
His weapon also has a golf club skin
---
this is the most boomer reply i have ever seen
---
*nods* Hopefully they get toned down a fair bit before release.
---
This is getting out of hand, now there's two of them!
---
Okay okay good. I'm not either I'm just sick of people who feel as though even though people make mistakes that people can't actually have character growth and change ya know? Good night it all gets old...
---
When I started the game I used lesion and got 3k most of the time but I camped alot it was a bad habit but when I started playing trapper I got rid of the habit then I moved to wraith and it's sort of still there but not much I check up on them every now and then when a survivor is hooked
---
Spirit 2.
---
I'd understand that, but a lot of videos I've seen are hyping "the FIRST family relation in game!!!!!"
---
I always have time to chat with a  reddit know it all
---
Okay troll andy
---
They get tossed into the Void when they're entirely out of hope/a soul. They're not dead nor are they alive, they kinda just sit there as a husk for eternity.
---
Lmao well unless there just so happens to another killer who speaks Japanese with the surname yamakoa I'm pretty sure it's rinsed father
---
Your entire argument is basically get good. Has nothing to do with my post. I can use a good killer and play fun and still get hate.
---
A japanese ogre, Usually with one or more horns, taller than humans, man-eating, a metal club with studs or spikes being their weapon of choise, normally having red skin, muscular.
---
I see survivor mains on this sub complain all the time that they always do 3 or 4 gens as they teammates do nothing.
---
Have none of you seriously ever completed 3 gens?
---
give me a fucking break.
---
Michael and Laurie aren't siblings in the first Halloween movie tho.
---
Yeah, I've had that happen to me once before. Game wouldn't even allow me to tap exit and leave match. Sadly, the killer DC'ed before I could even Alt+F4.
---
Someone need to edit a sh**t post of Waluigi perks and weapon and the survivor of that chapter mmm someone do that .
---
*non-licensed
---
Have they announced when the archives/ new legion skins and upwards are coming to the switch? The skin tweets claim they’re “available on all platforms” but this clearly isn’t true
---
I really dislike the ones that you have to do in a single trial like hooking 2 survivors in the basement with agitation or blinding the killer twice. i feel like they're just gonna bring out the worst in people desperately trying to get those done.
---
^smol ^Yamaoka
---
Japanese demon is pretty much spot on. They've got their own mythology for them and there are different types of oni that behave differently as well.
---
But she dead af
---
Yea, all that matters is that you're healing yourself and have the perk equipped. So throw on a Green medkit with some brown bandages, tank some protection hits while the killer is carrying someone and then heal up super fast after.
---
Thanks alot for the reply! I have no clue about these kind of masks unfortunately. But I felt like the mask kinda absorbs the blood, the starting of the fire implies that it comes to life in some kind of way? I think there are movies where these kind of haunted objects make humans go insane, spill blood/do evil, to regain their body/power
---
When they say that, they aren't referring to licenses, licenses aren't exactly lore friendly. I'm not even entirely sure that they're canon.
---
The bits don't float!?
---
lol i love u
---
weird flex by okay
---
oh look some people have legitimate reasons to avoid bcos of trauma and stuff, (which is why i avoid her personally)  but i mean people can change 
---
i dont hold anything against ppl who like it just justifying why i personally have issues with &gt;only&lt; the creator
---
Maybe it's so the survivor can have one last chance at escaping! Fuck you, and fuck your mentality! You've already won if you have a 3K. The last survivor is like the bonus round!

Nah, they're kinda glitchy too. They block a shitload of my screen. I'll about to post about that too.
---
Completely repair 3 in a single game by yourself? Yeah. Ok.
---
yeah I was thinking something similar! KumaTenshi said it's more likely to be a male "Oni" mask though, a "rage mask"
---
5 min game. he even closed the hatch
---
What if a demon drove Rin’s dad mad and thats who the killer is, and the survivor is Rins Father.
---
The only issue with this is that the Micheal and Laurie we have in game are OG Halloween Micheal and Laurie. They didn't get the family connection until Halloween 2, and was the god honest worse idea they had in that movie. Micheal is a Myers, and Laurie is a Strode in Halloween 1.
---
“First of, fuck off” , sorry what bud
---
they are siblings in the first movie though?? that's his motive for trying to kill her? and some of the newer movies dont even follow the same universe,,
---
At least its not fortnite bad minecraft good meme
---
So you just admitted that spirit plays whole argument is that they shouldn’t have to have skill to play a game while simultaneously bothering others? Compelling argument...
---
Catering to mentally ill, nice.
---
I'm glad they don't float but they block your VOF in-game?
---
I hit mine for the first time too. Felt so proud. Then got rank reset. Lol congrats.
---
You're aware their relationship was retconned in the new movies timeline right?
---
I guess he doesn't like Spirits lore? lol
---
But I'm really enjoying this. Instead of some random unrelated killer it feels like they really are deepening the lore of the dbd universe.
---
Are we getting Rin's father as a killer? Please tell me that's what we're getting!
---
I think I've only been moried once and that one time was by a hag
---
Done, check my other comment
---
I think maybe in 6 or 7 months? But that's just my guesse.
---
Yeah, might just be a one off thing tho. I've only played one game so far.
---
Her father should be a survivor, itd make more sense
---
You to
---
Its not a greed tactic. They didn't get the rights to the OG ghostface costume at release, only the mask which is owned by Fun World. Fun world doesn't own the OG costume so they weren't able to get it or anything like it. Which is why DBD ghostface isn't Billy Loomis or any movie version of him, Its a DBD version of ghostface named Danny.
---

---
Can we just have him added as a 2 player killer mode? Maybe the other killer can ride the Horse... I know it sounds crazy, but I am just spitballing here. He seems a little underwhelming and would probably need some tuning to even be mid tier. Good luck at you new job at BHVR.

These are the reboots?
---
You are looking for an argument and I honestly don't give a shit about your opinion. If you don't think spirit takes skill to play then get to rank 1 pick spirit with the best perks and let someone who is green rank killer try to 4k. You are an idiot and douche and blocking you so I don't have to suffer your bullshit replies any longer. Buh bye.
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
Yeah, okay.
---
For starters, I have done 3 full gens in one trial multiple times. Secondly, they do not mean from start to finish - they mean the number of overall charges that equal 3 gens so you don't even have to actually pop them.
---
Dedicated servers.

It IS a mental illness.

Legion’s first and only murder was and old custodian
---
I mean, I suppose. The main argument against that is  that the whispers her father was hearing in the lore was the entity reaching out to him to seek and destroy the main reason that was causing his unrest - which was his wife. The entity isn’t supposed to be the voice of reason or search out people just because they have a vendetta, it finds lost broken souls and crushes them further.
---
Ah I see. Got it, I understand.

Does it work with custom games?

Yup, it literally says "Your blood is of Yamaoka"

Damn you cant count or read,pathetic
---
I main Bill so that I can't be judged for not spending real money on cosmetics.
---
You did it too early, and dead hard isn’t for baiting the killer like a rank 21, it’s to be able to loop a loop one more time if you are too greedy.
---
You are correct. In the very 1st movie , before anything else came out Michael and Laurie were indeed related. She was 2 and he was 6 when he murderd thier sister. It has since been changed though.
---
Behavior should really care about their maps and not make them look like PS2 graphics. They should have good graphics and not look like a copy and paste
---
Step 1: Put on the perk
---
Step 2: Enter into a match
---
Step 3: Work on gens
---
Step 4: Profit?
---
Jeez, if this is level 2... what’ll 3 be like? I know 4 was ridiculous but I was hoping it’d be a bit easier for level 2 and 3
---
They don't state that they're brother and sister until the second movie, Laurie's outfit seems to be from the first movie. The whole brother and sister thing has been wiped away if you follow the new movies. I guess it all depends on how you want to take it.
---
It would be great if it only worked like that in certain countries. You'd have to split up the servers but eh
---
There are so many things wrong with this post that scientists are studying it in order to identify if this amount of incorrect statements will cause a gravitational pull akin to a black hole due to how dense the original poster is.
---
Not rng, a key to each trap is assigned to a random box of the four at the start of the match.
---
That was a far to aggressive response to a simple argument. I think it’s fair for people to have a discussion without you having to become violently aggressive. I’m just trying to make an argument that spirit is a bit easy at the moment and should be nerfed. And my argument is to get good, just playing the game makes people better and appreciate more aspects of the game.
---
Yeah I noticed that. Definitely unintended. Submit a bug report with this image.
---
Classic Ghostface is out?
---
Big spike? lmfao
---
It's not just implied, it literally states in his lore that some kids paid him $50 and some beer to paint a mural saying "The Legion" in Mount Ormond. This is the only non-licensed chapter where the killer(s) and survivor are directly related to each other. The next closest being Nea and Nurse since they were both taken from Crotus Prenn, although even then they never had direct contact before entering the realm.
---
I didnt know that :0 thank you for clarifying
---
It only takes a 60 second chase to lose 3 gens.
---
Once you add in the time to pick up the survivor, carry them to a hook, hook them, and then rotate to a gen they're working on, anyone who started a gen before the chase will finish.
---
In fact you can lower that to 40 second chase if it takes the killer a bit to find the first guy. Which let's face it, it usually does.

Submit a bug report. Definitely unintended.

Actually, FunWorld *does* own this version of the cloak in-game. You can see it [here](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XPAepGw5L._UX679_.jpg). It's not the version used in the movie, it's just similar to it. The movie Ghostface doesn't have things like a belt or those long cloaks under the arms, along with some other minor differences. 
---
They totally could have added this cloak from the start, no idea why they didn't. Maybe they just didn't want to associate with Scream yet, for whatever reason.
---
Unless they change this challenge, the best way to do it will probably be to have swf, prove thyself, and some tool boxes. Then hope your killer is bad. I'm pretty sure that challenge would work if two people fully repair a gen.
---
Thanks! These perk icons belong to a streamer named Dowsey and you can find the download in his discord: https://discord.gg/feZeMcB
---
we need to know if it means being on the gen when it finishes, or fully repair 3 gens. First options is a LOT more doable, with the right perks.
---
I think you just need to participate in 3 gen completions. Atleast, that's what I heard. Could be wrong.
---
I thought it just said a “quiet whisper” or is there somewhere else it 100% confirms it was the entity?
---
The new teaser says otherwise
---
Steve needs a man bun
---
Lolol
---
Clearly
---
Sometimes being nice hurts and is not worth it. Some people, when nice, can’t endure being insulted for being so polite. I certainly can’t. If I’m insulted while constantly just being at the very least a neutral person, I will drop the pacifism an go into a tirade of insults right back like they just shoved me into a huge rubber band expecting me not to fling back.
---
Well that explains a lot, thanks ! ;-)
---
Yes they do. You have to be on a gen from start to finish. Otherwise, it would say equivalent.
---
I don't think it's too much but deplete 6 medkits. New players don't even have those. And it kind of teaches bad habits of using your item completely.
---
*Mmmmmmm female balls*
---
Congrats, every stereotype and this is why people dont like you

Yeah I love his moustache

---
He didn’t say those were exploits im pretty sure, lad.
---
And its not even repair 3 gens, its repair 3 gens yourself so you need to get the set amount of ticks or charges meaning if you help others or if someone helps you then you probably won't get it. Best bet is to pay a 3 person rank 1 swf to distract the killer while you complete the gens.
---
Which makes way more sense than the father, which would be dumb lorewise
---
I have about 70 on my Legion.

Hey chromosomes dont equal sexuality! Even in cis people! Intersex women can be born with XY and intersex men can be XX! [source](https://www.who.int/genomics/gender/en/index1.html) 
---
Also it isn’t a result of mental illness. The DSM-5 Only lists gender dysphoria which can affect anyone. The APA even says that trans people are not by default mentally ill, just like cis people. 
---
Do research instead of spouting outdated lies
---
*OUR GOD
---
this is totally false. I completed the related challenges from level 1 without doing it start to finish. and BHVR descriptions are literally always inadequate
---
I’m not against the idea of an Oni demon, I just don’t want it to be Rin’s father.
---
Ooo I'm glad you said this, I'm gonna make sure I jump in some traps too!
---
Do you think they are going to go out of their way to get the licence and implement it into the game just to give it away? Some of the stuff is a little bit overpriced but man, just give the devs some respect.
---
Obsession perks give you a huge benefit at the cost of giving a survivor an advantage. It's called BALANCE. Heard of it? I guess not! The obsession should have increased altruistic action speed to encourage you to take them out with dying light, PWYF is self explanatory, and STBFL? If you could hit any survivor you wanted and get stacks without penalty, THAT WOULD BE TOO OP. IF YOU'RE SO GOOD, DO IT YOUR-FUCKING-SELF! Hell, why don't we make all survivors broken at the start of the round? HMM? Would that satisfy your bloodlust?
---
But he needs at least 2 killers to hit tier 3 right? Still, I can relate
---
Equal pay? I don't think so.
---
5 games now, 5 campers, 3 of them in the basement giving up gens and everything lol
---
\&gt;  after I get everyone on death hook.  
---
And then the game isn't even halfway yet.
---
Thank you for this description! I have definitely seen such enemies in Japanese games before. I know exactly what you mean now, and that would be a badass killer
---
maybe it's the spirits dad? I mean it would probably make sense due to the lore of the Yamaoka history with the dad killing the spirits family and it would be a cool thing to add to the game; or a spirit rework? that would be interesting
---
Interesting. I think this has the potential to be a very fun dlc!!
---
So, the Oni?
---
I have no problem someone saying "I'm this" or "I'm that". It doesn't bother me to call them whatever they please. It has no bearing on me thus it doesn't bother me, but literally every person is a man or woman from a scientific standpoint. Man of course being male and woman being female. Again, this is from a biological perspective and not a social one.
---
I mean, its definitely going to change the way you play. Last time there was that Plunder 3 chests with Plunderers Instinct. That was rough, had to find the perk, then instead of playing the game to play the game you have to play differently.
---
Thanks,I hate it.
---
This is gonna be awkward
---
Nice to see they're making them a little tougher. See you in the fog realm!
---
I've run Killers for 3 gens before after doing 1 gen solo, and I earn enough Killer Diversion to give me a Gold Chaser.
---
It might have been because it's Wraith. Did he cloak a lot OP?
---
Everybody is talking about the killer being Rin’s father, but I have a different theory...I think the killer could be a grudge, or ju-on. 
---
What is a ju-on? The ju-on is a curse that is created where a person “dies with a deep and powerful rage.” (see, Ju-On, Wikipedia). The ju-on stays in the location of the death and applies itself to others that come in contact with the location (or, in some instances, come in contact with someone who is already “infected” with the curse - see, The Grudge, film). Those infected with the curse tend to die; their bodies can remain behind, but, sometimes, the bodies just disappear. It should be noted that the ju-on is not the ghost of someone who died, it is a separate entity. 
---
Why this theory could be correct:
---
- - The ju-on is Japanese folklore. The teaser trailer focuses on the Yamaoka estate, a traditional Japanese house. The Yamaokas are Japanese. 
---
- - The Yamaoka estate is the location of two brutal murders, including the murder of Rin Yamaoka. According to DBD lore, Rin was filled with rage at her death: 
---
*“A dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She would not rest--not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge”*
---
*“She inherited incredible fury from her ancestors. The wrath that flows through her veins is her legacy. The terrible pain she suffered set it off. Swift and lethal, The Spirit exacts her revenge endlessly.”*
---
(see, The Spirit lore, Deady by Daylight wiki)
---
The Yamaoka household seems perfectly ripe for the creation of a ju-on. 
---
- - The first trailer contains the words (translated) “Your blood is Yamaokas.” (Thanks, /u/Goldenpoopdispenser) It could be the ju-on talking to its victims in the Yamaoka residence (whether it be in this realm or the Entity’s realm) since the ju-on primarily manifests itself in the location of the rage-filled deaths. 
---
- - The bodies of victims of the ju-on can either remain behind or disappear completely (as seen in the films). Perhaps the Entity is taking some of the ju-on’s victims?
---
- - The Entity feeds on strong emotions, such as hope and rage. The ju-on is a physical manifestation of strong emotion. 
---
- - The Grudge is the 2004 American remake of Ju-On, a Japanese film. The Grudge is scheduled for another remake in 2020. 
---
Why this theory may be wrong:
---
- - The ju-on is a physical manifestation of strong emotion; does the Entity have the ability to transport it to the Realm? Not sure. It transported the Demogorgon, but that is an actual being. Personally, I think it could be within the Entity’s power to take the ju-on. 
---
- - I’m not sure how this theory explains the missing katana in the first teaser trailer posted on Twitter(?) where the poster asks viewers to identify what is missing. I suppose that the Entity could provide the katana to the ju-on since it was present in the location of the murders and the Entity doesn’t understand quite understand everything in our realm. It’s a bit of a stretch, though. Plus, two katana-wielding killers? Idk.
---
as long as a Myers isn't using a add-on that requires him to stalk more to tier up, a single Survivor will have enough stalk to level all the way from tier 1 to tier 3 once.
---
Someone was complaining earlier that these were all super difficult. Other than 3 gens using Dark Sense, none of them seem that bad.
---
Its not some greedy tactic... They got the license for the mask and the owners let BHVR make an original character with it. Danny "Jed Olsen" Johnson is an original character with his own lore made by BHVR, but the Ghost face persona he uses is licensed.
---
That fucking sound effect brilliant
---
Probably isn't tho
---
Naniq
---
My flashlight aim sucks haha!
---
That could be the reason, or they probably wanted to stick with the canon that Danny is an experienced Serial Killer so he'd have an outfit to match that. I imagine they just wanted him to be as close to a DBD original as he could get, Thanks for the info about the cloak though!
---
Stop enabling and normalizing mental illness.  Don’t become the 41%.
---
Nani
---
Oh man i was so disappointed when a reverse bear trap activated on my head only to make a silly little blood effect. It feels so wrong. They should really turn this into an actual horror game.
---
The fake gender made it in but attack helicopter didn't? Shameful
---
I would say either The Oni or The Demon. But yeah, I was 100% more hyped for The Alchemist. I'm not too hype about this one.
---
I think it will work if teammates help you with a gen. The daily ritual "repair the equivalent of 3 full generators" doesn't just count the ticks you yourself has contributed to the gen, it counts all the gen's progress as your own, so youd only need to do 3 gens with a teammate instead of like 5 and a half or whatever. But that's just a thought.
---
I still hope for a gore dlc
---
I'd definitely pay 5 euro for a more gory game and it would finance them having to work on 2 versions of things.
---
Us Jeff mains are a rare bunch
---
Yeah, I just edited to add that the flashlight and 4 traps challenges could be hard for some people. But certainly not unfairly difficult.
---
We do it all the time and we're fine
---
First off, why would you not play a single-player game because of its community ?
---
Second off, you're already playing a multiplayer game with a notoriously toxic community. I think you'll be good with this one.
---
Such originality for a killer,never used before in any game except all of them.
---
I DISLIKE THE WORD CUNT!!! YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT, BUT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO LIKE IT!!!
---
HAVE A NICE DAY!!!
---
Ugh, why is Dark Senses a Master level? No matter how good you are it's purely dependant on either being in a SWF that lets you have generators or having terrible teammates get hooked and doing generators instead of saving them.
---
Thanks for clearing that up, I haven't read the lore in a while!
---
If you and u/damboy99 like bad news, [here's the original challenges as seen on the PTB](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dh664v/full_list_of_all_archive_challenges/).
---
Survivor challenges Appeal to Heal, By Any Means Necessary, Generosity, and Dark Senses all had their requirements increased.
---
Killer challenge Agitated Advantage had its requirements reduced. Reverent, Manifest Distress, and Hungry Jaws all had their requirements increased.
---
Yeah it couldn’t be any other reason, like
---
1. Probably requiring a whole new survivor model to be made since the male/female models wouldn’t work with the character, meaning less time spent on more important things in development
---
2. Potentially being blocked from countries like china, meaning a lot less revenue/success for the game
---
And probably more that I haven’t thought of in 30 seconds
---
That guy’s definitely just a transphobic asshole though
---
YUJINO NEO KILAY
---
thank you i will not enjoy my stay
---
Sure you're not mentally ill. There's only 2 genders you freaks.
---
Yea in the 80s Jeff’s dad passed away in modern times
---
Yeah for sure. They are called 'challenges' so they should at least take a little effort haha. Gives me something to aim for anyhow
---
That wasn't a nerf to her specifically, it was a change due to game mechanics.
---
-the kkk circa 1865
---
He describes them as if they aren’t available and it something survivors are doing to exploit the game, it’s a mechanic just like slugging or camping or whatever, just silly to be mad at survivors when he’s equally toxic.
---
Nop is the spirit 2
---
Maybe, I always have trouble with that daily so I imagine its going to be harder. I could have a match where I do 3 gens but then it will only count 1 and a half for the daily.
---
Yes take my upvote
---
probaly freddy or spirit
---
The enitity wanted to take rins dad as a killer before so he's gonna be a killer
---
I’m going to guess that if it is Rin’s father he will be called either the Ronin, the samurai, or the oni.
---
If the only way to unlock Tier 70 in the Rift without grinding is through the Tomes, the Tomes should be easier or passive.
---
A casual looking at this isn't going to want to buy the Premium Rift.
---
Hell, I know I can do these but since I don't want to grind and I don't want to grind challenges, the Premium Rift is looking like a waste of $10. 
---
Congrats BHVR, you played yourself.
---
The entity’s causing some family drama
---
That bastards make me use self care
---
Hotzdarva
---
Yeah I'm more hyped with regards to the implications of the lore than for the killer itself.
---
Someone from the support team replied the same to my ticket, but also mentioned that they’re working on a fix, which they’re planning to include in the next patch.
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting multiple disconnected players (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
* Unapproved advertising - If you wish to advertise on /r/deadbydaylight, we ask that you seek approval from the mod team beforehand.
---
...you don't have to. You just have to use Self Care. None of the challenges require you to play Claudette.

Wow I loved the research you provided! Thanks for engaging in such nice intellectual discourse where you didn’t at all attack someone! /s

But seriously. Science changes all the time. People believed the sun went around the earth. Now we know the Earth goes around the sun.

Western nations used to think that there were only two genders. Now science says otherwise. I’m not mad at you, but I wish you wouldn’t be so stubborn and rude. Sometimes things change and that is alright. I hope you learn that someday

This is by far the best take on the next chapeter imo.

I love the artstyle so much! I wish I could see more of you! ♡

Before 5 beers, after 5 beers

 This is always how it is on killer. Survivor is so easy though. Level everyone just enough for the teachables you want (David will NEVER have no mither unlocked for everyone). Then pick one survivor (namely Tapp) and just level their webs for the new perks. Grabbed pharmacy from the shrine and had it at Tier 3 in exactly 3 webs. 
---
Plague NEVER wanted Thana. I have 61 petals on her since Thana was on the web last week. Probably took me around 20-30 webs to find. Unreal.
---
I'm glad Ghostface has the classic set but it just feels off to me. the flappy bit on his arms just look weird and rub me the wrong way and the knife he has just looks eh, the mask is also very unneeded as we already have it basically just slightly dirtier
---
actually, i did this one without using it. Went against the plague, healing  in the pools counted towa
---
prayer beads spirit real shit
---
That's not that bad. I think in Tome 3 or 4 there's an interrupt 4 survivors challenge. 
---
Anyways an easy way to get it is the "Grab Happy Doc" exploit. Just get Doctor, hook someone, swap to treatment mode, and facecamp the hook spamming M1 as fast as possible. As soon a someone even attempts to fake an unhook, you'll usually insta-grab them. 
---
Or you can play Jumpscare Myers. Or Prayer Beads Spirit.
---
That’s why the outfit costs 900 and not the usual 1080. Personally I think having a whiter and newer looking mask is cool but I’m also a giant Ghostface fan so I’m biased
---
Nope still 2
---
Dady  UwU
---
Maybe Rin's mother will be the new survivor
---
The Mortal Kombat sub is also infected with this sickness. The Elder Gods and The Entity must combine their powers if they wish to excise this disease.
---
What do you want them to do give it away for free with how many people whining for the classic ghostface. You would expect at least be grateful they got it for you
---
I don't understand why people thinks it's rin's dad. Would be dumb lore wise and lazy as idea
---
Plus what he says sounds something someone related with the family but in a wider prospective. Like an ancestor would say, not her father
---
Someone displeased about it's family in a way since is been used お前 (Omae) which is used when talking with to someone inferior than yourself (it means you in a more derogatory way)
---
Plus how the blood, smoke and everything else looks like shrinking, almost going back in time, is a major clue that made me think something like that is more plausible. 
---
Emphasis on the mask of an Oni that also recalls a past era. A missing sword, used in the past in many battles as primary weapon and in those battles the use of a mask wasn't unusual to instill terror to the enemies. Idk, I don't think BHVR would be so lazy to just bring Rin's father, especially after the spirit release back then when everybody was sure 100% that the killer wasn't the girl but the guy with the sword. Oh boy if people got it wrong back then
---
Let's not jump into conclusion. My opinion is this, I might be wrong, most likely. But thinking it's Rin's father it's just too obvious and wrong at the same time to be it
---
Huh
---
I'm a huge fan too, but at the end of the day they could have put a bit more effort into it by making it look like the actual one from the film, or giving it a slight off white/yellow tone like how most of the classic 90's GF masks tend to look due to aging.
---
Or ultra sneaky ghostface.
---
Spirit hears whispers right as the entity takes her. You really have to be doing some mental gymnastics to think its anything else. Additionally, the entity has taken the roles of cultural/religious icons before (Plague), so he could be appearing as a demon if you think that is has to be that, which would probably be unnecessary imo
---
Yeah but I've only been playing for 2 months...I dont have it as a teachable
---
Thanks for the explicit clarification! :)
---
Or Coxcombed Clapper/Ghost Wraith
---
No Bing Bong, motherfuckers.
---
Jeff just came to visit
---
Is non-binary a hermophrodite?
---
ahahha
---
2 times more survivor challenges than killer challenges, thank you Behavior, really not hating killer mains, not biased at all
---
Lets see how many hermophrodites playing DBD
---
\*Angery Jeff Main noises\*
---
Technically you are not wrong. It shows 2,2k upbongs.
---
That's actually a really good theory, considering that Rin's fury was inherited from her ancestors.
---
In game not possible any more but before it showed when you finished tier 1. Prob screens around out there somewhere.
---
&gt;literally every person is a man or woman from a scientific standpoint
---
That's not true, see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex
---
If you’re as big into science as you claim, you’d know that biology often mixes nearly everything around, it’s never that cut and dry. If you’re worried about the basic biology of it, you should look up Klieinfelter’s Syndrome (probably spelled wrong), or other XXY disorders
---
Simply put, some people are medically ambiguous (their genitalia is ambiguous, or they possess both genitalia to varying degrees). Some people have brains that are demonstrably hard-wired to be one gender, even though physically they are another gender. Some people simply want to change their identity because they’re more comfortable identifying a different way, and that’s all it is. It goes on and on, but the point is there’s nothing cut and dry about gender anymore, even from a medical standpoint
---
Both bullshit reasons. The characters have multiple body types. Why was this a non-issue with Jane? Overwatch has LGBT+ characters and they're not banned in other countries. You're also trying to say that companies from democratic nation's should kneel to authoritarian nations for money. 
---
 Also, ignoring all that, how exactly is responding to someone hoping for a trans character with "hmmmnope don't do that" *not* transphobic? Quit being ridiculous.
---
Steve? Meh. Bill all the way
---
It took me like 10 minutes to figure out what the fuck you meant
---
Or farmer John
---
Where can I see all the challenges?
---
True, sometimes people see losing the horror element as losing the purpose of playing the game; if you want to play a horror game with the aim of being scared, it's not fun if it doesn't scare you anymore
---
I use "Tbh" here because I'm actually happy about this, I find the resulting gameplay is compelling regardless of the horror
---
I always try to 99% my items on the off chance I’ll escape with it.
---
WHY IS RANK RESET SO OFTEN? I JUST GOT INTO RED RANKS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND NOW IM RANK 12!!
---
Ace mains playing no different than they usually play for that one.
---
I’ve never heard that phrase before. Is “one joke” the new “vibe check” or something?
---
I'm not arguing with you. You're blatantly transphobic, and would use any possible reason you could to dislike me. Responding as you did to someone hoping for a trans character *is* transphobic. Responding this way to me, not caring about how you're acting, further reinforces that.
---
Completely repair 6 generators while in a chase with killer using the perk dark sense.
---
This must be done in a single trial.
---
There was a separate thread discussing the challenges, but I guess that goes here now.
---
For me, it's not so much the difficulty as the playstyles they'll encourage.
---
Basement builds, Franklin's Demise vs 3-4 survivors trying to blind a killer at the same time, more Spirits because EZ grabs...
---
If you want the lore, you *have* to do the challenges. **You have no alternative.** If you want Rift rewards then you either do the challenges or play for over 2 hours every day.
---
I had been given the impression that the Rift and challenges were to keep the population up and give long-term players something to do other than mindlessly grind BP or Shards. Things you could do during normal gameplay that rewarded you with lore. A way for BHVR to guarantee some income rather than gambling on players liking new cosmetics, or having to make better and better perks so that people will buy the new character. What's the benefit of encouraging players to brutalise each other?
---
**Note that almost half the Challenges have had their difficulty increased since the PTB.** ***This does not bode well for IV.***
---
Personally I'm really disappointed. I was already nervous from the PTB and leaked live IV, and II has basically confirmed my suspicions. I expected better from you, BHVR.
---
Bring an emergency medkit and you'll get it in like 30 seconds, the extra efficiency will help it last too since it has very few charges.
---
King Crimson killer when?
---
Yeah only 900 cells
---
u can also do this by convincing ppl that ure just goofing around, and then when they trust u enuff to do a gen in front of you, grab one of them. likely with spirit, so that u can do her thing
---
I wanted some fresh OC, not one related to a killer we already have. I don’t know. There were a lot of cool ideas when the “tomb” files were leaked and this being just, Ron’s dad, just doesn’t interest me at all.
---
No, they should get the license of the original ghostface before they release a "fake-ghostface".
---
Still pissed classic Ghostface didn't come with a switchblade.
---
Oh I know a few, a flying killer for obvious reasons and a killer that can turn into a survivor again for obvious reasons, for a idea that could slightly work would but would never happen    (because it'd be unfun for the survivors) which  would be a killer that stalks a victim and when that victim goes near anyone else it show their location and the longer they stay near teammates the more debuffs they get(it also effects the other survivors) basically either meaning you deal with the debuffs or you be a outcast and can't go near anyone which sounds unfun.
---
Question, can you continue working on tome 1 if you’ve passed the epilogue and moved onto tome 2? I completed all survivor challenges in the first tome but I’ve been waiting for better killer queues.....
---
I stated why, not in this reply but in this thread
---
Its like the spirit teaser all over again. "Oh the killer is a samurai".. and spirit popped up. At least try to think twice before getting the obvious answer which you can be sure is wrong. If is too obvious, is wrong. That's how it is with these teasers but I guess people like you haven't learned yet
---
Let's ignore the distorted voice, the time going backwards and using a derogatory Japanese to call someone, which can be referring to literally anybody of Yamaoka family. He sounds like critiquing someone using お前 instead of あなた, someone who did something wrong.. like killing it's family.
---
A katana is missing and a mask, used in war on ancient eras, are also clues. Your comment instead sound kinda delusional believing that something obvious is the right answer ignoring small details
---
ive met three transpeople, but I know what you mean. 20 years ago there were none. like, at all. Not saying it's just a trend, but it sure does look that way.
---
Well also they had themed “phantom of the opera” cosmetics.
---
Fuck! I just prestiged my Claudette
---
Referring to how cis people (most of the time ignorant or far right which is the same thing I guess) always go to the singular trans joke; "I identify as X!!!" 
---
 Also referred to as Ricky Gervais' whole career nowadays.
---
Why haven’t any of the other killers gotten this treatment?
---
you couldn't write anything and it would still have more substance than your comment.
---
Sacrifice 5 survivors.
---
"̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶k̶i̶l̶l̶e̶r̶ ̶w̶e̶ ̶a̶l̶w̶a̶y̶s̶ ̶w̶a̶n̶t̶e̶d̶"̶
---
0 excitement for this
---
Hope its not Rin father at least,probably the worst choice for a new killer.
---
I'm jumping, ITS THE FATHER AND SHES THE SURVIVOR... 
---
Its makes sense lore wise
---
It's worth it buying killers. Each character, both survivor and killer, has three perks unique to them but if you level them enough you gain the ability to learn those perks on other characters.
---
For instance, the Hag's perk Hex: Ruin is one of the best killer perks in the game, but it is only available to the Hag until you level her to 35 and unlock the teachable, then you have a chance to get it on any other killer.
---
For recommendations, Leatherface is typically considered to be the best starting killer, not because he's strong (he isn't) but because of his perk BBQ chili which increases blood Points earned allowing you to level characters faster. Aside from him, other good starting killers are Trapper, Wraith, and Hillbilly. Ghost Face and Myers are pretty goodtoo.
---
Given your tendency towards teleporting killers (Hag and Nurse) I would also recommend Demogorgon and Freddy as they both possess similar teleporting abilities.
---
Welcome to the game, and don't be afraid to ask questions, while the community as a whole can be toxic, this subreddit is good at helping newer players. Good luck!
---
Ah yes i've gotten this as well and I just started trying to get off my addiction of running Shadowborn.
---
So your calling google dinosaur weak?
---
I still have about 70 for Ghostface band 4p for Nightmare
---
Maybe ribs father is the survivor/killer hybrid we’ve all been asking for
---
Alrighty, thanks.
---
Imagine still complaining about the syringe though
---
this is still a mask of a female demon isnt it? what if its spirit mother? or maybe a hidden (twin) sister? who knows...?
---
King crimson skips time doesn’t reverse it
---
I really hope it's that way. I love BHVR and the game but the monetization aspect is getting out of hand.
---
I was actually thinking about something like this, a survivor could "scavenge" a broken pallet for pieces, Once he gets 4 pieces he can create a new pallet which would break faster than standard pallets. Scavenge time would probably be around 16/14/10 seconds.
---
Alright, so once in a full moon then.
---
Hopefully this means we get another Yamaoka l Residence map
---
“Pretend to be a Rank 20 Survivor for 2 health states”
---
Then the killer has enduring and yoinks you off the pallet anyway
---
With my teammaes I do 3 gens alone anyways /s
---
I had to kill 4 survivors by my hand in a single trial. That ended up being 3 games with Ebony  Mori's because people.kept DCing. I can't say I blame them but I needed  it for the Archive.
---
I don't at all, just think it's a really pathetic joke
---
Why do you feel like a mansplaining prick?
---
The challenges don’t need to be easier but we should be able to have more than one active at a time
---
If you're so sure will you suck dick if its not then?
---
It’s been a long past few days
---
Bro you really need to shut the fuck up, you have been bitching  nonstop on every post i see on this reddit for the last hour so how about you do us all a favour and log off reddit for the week so we can have fun here
---
God you come off as incredibly entitled
---
Now we need a crusader. Don't ask why we just do
---
That's gotta be a bug, that shouldn't work
---
None of the characters are confirmed LGBT+.
---
I’m queer and I don’t think this is necessary in a game like this. We have such loose lore anyway. I mean it’d be fun if someone’s sexuality was confirmed as not straight but it’s also totally irrelevant to the game.
---
Can't tunnel obsession with dying light
---
The entity originally wanted him, but when he attacked Rin, it saw more potential in her Rage than his despair and took her instead.
---
Oh sweet, a killer based on the horse from horsing around! Nothing is scarier than depression
---
Flashlight blinds aren't bad, wait till a killer kicks a pallet and go for the blind. Aim for the neck area.
---
its not a bad thing to have a single killer that can't be bullied
---
here, I found one for you -&gt; /r/Diablo3Crusaders/
---
&gt; *You cursed brat! Look what you've done! I'm melting!* ***MELTING!*** *Oh, what a world, what a world!*
---
Absolutely
---
It was never meant for causuals.  They want to stroke the epeens of the most toxic members of the community and give them more opportunity to pretend to be better than you....while charging for it.
---
I mean, BBQ usually requires you to spend real money or Shards on it first. And let's be real, grinding up Bubba is a pain. He has great perks, but his actual kit is pretty lackluster. 
---
And on Survivor side, the only perks similar to BBQ are from Dwight and David.
---
And in some cases, if I only want one perk from a Survivor/Killer, it's usually worth it to just buy the perk I want from the Shrine Shop instead of wasting my time leveling up someone I'd never use.
---
Is that not literally a pay to win system?
---
That's it, I'm getting Diablo noe
---
I agree. When the game started I was like "Fuck i'm NEVER doing this archive quest". Game ended and tadaaaaaaa.
---
Damn Genji with the Oni skin as killer?
---
It kinda makes sense, there's more survivors in the game than killers. And if everyone was trying to play killer at the same time the queues would be miserable.
---
If it translates to “Your blood belongs to the Yamakoa’s.”
---
That means entity is a family counsellor and Rin is having some Father-Daughter bonding time VIA murdering innocent people. 
---
Cool.
---
Remember spirit teaser? "It's a samurai WOW!!2!2!2!"
---
Yep.. a samurai..
---
Almost half of II had their requirements increased since PTB. If the pattern holds, IV is going to be even worse than what was leaked.
---
Have you seen them yet?
---
I had to rush a little bit to grab BBQ but I'm glad I was able to get it. Hag actually looks like a lot of fun so I'm not too bummed about no Ruin, I'll probably buy her.
---
I'm hyped. I hope it's not "just" her father. I hope he is gonna turn into a demon or oni and his power could be gaining power by hurting people and collecting their blood. Maybe even time reversal teleports who knows.
---
Now that's what I call, big brain plays
---
hahahahaha oh boy...
---
sorry for bringing diablo to this subreddit!!
---
It may be irrelevant to some, but representation is very important to many people, and helps to further normalize LGBTQ+ people. It's only a good thing.
---
[MY NEW GHOST TOAST COSMETIC IS BLOCKING THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF MY SCREEN, I LOVE THE OUTFIT BUT STILL IT MAKES ME WANNA RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE](/intensifies)
---
He has issues with the game obviously, but he’s so positive in spite of it. I’ve really been drawn to his streams because of that. There’s too much negativity as it is, I’m not going to watch negative streamers and make myself feel worse
---
Good luck finding a pallet when you need it, too.
---
No worries brother, the crusader must continue
---
he was talking about his own comment maybe ? xD
---
Swear to god these tomes are gonna force me to be a friendly killer lmao
---
I am finally the 1%
---
Oh shit
---
It is, yes.
---
Not saying it's not annoying for the gens to get done fast. but if you bring a mori I'm going to get out of the game as fast as possible
---
&gt; Blendette 
---
I hear that all over the place - can someone please ELI5 it?
---
I'm pretty cool with all these tbh. I just spent the past weekend doing all the level 1 challenges and I am honestly excited to do these new ones!
---
Like rank 16 on both sides. Tbh if it'd speed up match making I wouldn't mind having the option to ignore ranks or match me with a specific range of ranks.
---
I remember a pushback on the ability of survivors to hear the direction of the phase walk. So they buffed it. I would think the former made for better balance.
---
I don't think it's fair for you to plant your flag on the point that stridor counters iron will. Sure it sucks but there's so many survivor perks that couinter killer perks and even their abilities/play styles. But they need to remove prayer beads. Just get them out
---
boi you saw how that blood got picked up it obviously Mr.Clean
---
Ah then fuck no.
---
Lol who came up with these
---
At 2 AM, under a full moon, Hook 6 Claudettes together in the Basement as The Trapper with his full Prestige 3 outfit equipped while using only his teachable perks. 
---
This must be completed in a single trial
---
New leak! It's the father and he has the same power as Spirit but he can phase walk as long as he wants, can see survivors while phasing and can hit them while phasing.
---
OK then but how does this let insult me bc I try to learn English as much as you were at my age I guess
---
Let you*
---
YASS. whoop his child molesting ass quentin. ❤
---
Sleep-deprived bulldog is now my spirit animal.
---
the thing would be the best, a killer based on paranoia and mistrust of your allies
---
oh wait....
---
You're right, my bad
---
Distorted Voice: Rin's voice was probably not a reverberated mass of cries and screams when she was alive
---
Time going backwards: Entity literally controls time and space, he could be going backwards to claim what he had intended.
---
Voice critiquing: Her dad went insane and killed his family, if the leaks of it being a killer than switches into a crazed mode are right, it could be a "split personality" or something similar, where he is aware he messsed up but is too far gone to actually care. I dont play Overwatch, but I imagine its similar to the new hero Sigma, who from his teaser I gather is incredibly insane but has an inkling that he isnt doing the right thing.
---
The katana and mask are owned by the "current" day Yamaoka family, its not evidence that its somebody else.
---
It COULD certainly not be her father, but "probably not" is a stretch of someone that just doesnt like the idea of it being that
---
buffed*
---
Not to RUIN (kek) the party, but last week just had BBQ &amp; Chili -- a S-level perk. So you can't say they never have good ones.
---
Same.
---
lmao what the fuck my dude you are angry as fuck. who here is "having fun?" This entire comment section is a pissbaby whine fest about needing to do generators
---
**For an Astronaut themed killer**
---
*Silent Void* - The killer provides an “atmosphere” within the terror radius.  Audio notifications for survivors outside the atmosphere are suppressed, and survivors will slowly gain tiers of suffocation.  Survivors can reset the counter by entering the atmosphere or finding Oxygen Canisters around the map.
---
Suffocation tiers provide status effects, increasing in severity as they tier up (Blindness, Exposed, Broken).  Survivors in high tiers of suffocation will gasp loudly for air upon entering the atmosphere.
---
*Active:* The killer takes in a deep breath, reducing their terror radius to zero and forcing survivors in range to drop 1 suffocation tier immediately.
---
**A Dryad-type killer**
---
The killer is a nature deity, angry at the destruction and repurposing of the forests
---
*Living Wood* - The walls do not appreciate the abuse they suffer under the hands of the survivors.  The killer can activate to drop a pallet, damaging any survivors passing beneath it.  Pallets dropped will remain dropped for X seconds before returning to an upright position.
---
Haha nice, might have to try that later. Hopefully they don't fix it by then
---
All of you are fucking stupid. It’s definitely the Nun. Duh.
---
Examples?
---
nah, I’d say it’s 100% Hellraiser
---
How is this question relevant at all?
---
It's not necessary, but representation and inclusivity is important.
---
And most of the characters lore aren't that relevant to the game from a gameplay side to begin with.
---
We are exploring Claudette's past right now, so who knows which survivors end up being queer :p
---
So is nurse and spirit and hag and doc and pig and ghostface from my experience... the countering part I mean, not the flaws.
---
Spirit - crouch behind something **if she stops moving**, wait for as long as she would have spent shifting, then bolt or jog in any direction you think will work that isn’t directly towards her. If she wasn’t shifting, you made her waste time standing there waiting for you to run right into her and gave allies more gen time. If she did phase shift it doesn’t matter, you are getting outta dodge anyway so the chase continues.
---
Hag - why aren’t you crouching when you go to gens, pallets, windows, hooks, and gate levers? You should be doing that.
---
Doc - crouch to a locker if he hasn’t already discovered your whereabouts and hang out inside to avoid shrieking. Oh and don’t stand idly by at a pallet, lest you get shocked and smacked for standing there waiting for the shriek to finish to throw it down.
---
Pig - Go into MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE when it comes to scanning your surroundings and occasionally hide from time to time if no one has gotten hurt recently, even if you don’t see or hear her. Just... do what you usually do when on watch for stealth killers. Oh and ignore hooked comrades to remove that ugly hunk of metal on your head while you’re at it. 
---
Nurse - she’s just lil ms. mindgames. Almost like spirit except you have to figure it out as you go along.
---
Might be anything if anybody remember spirit teaser and everybody thought was a samurai
---
For me is something in the past, someone really far back since they really emphasise about everything shrinking in time, smoke, blood and the fire that wasn't set ever there since was just a decoration in Rin's time
---
Linked to Yamaoka bloodline (like her chapter) but ancient. Ancient enough that the only weapon that existed was a sword (that miss rn) and where masks were used in battles to instill fear into the enemies on the battlefield
---
Wow they don’t have furry as an option smh
---
"you'd better watch yourself, kid. things are looking real bad for you."
---
Ok then. I don’t consider those exploits either luckily.
---
Killer based on ancient Japanese history...
---
Giant Enemy Crab 🦀 attacks survivor weakpoints for massive damage!
---
Everybody, ban together and downvote him back too 3!
---
Think he will have a tracer like ability
---
I am not excited to have 4 survivors trying to blind me at the same time, or seeing them DC the second it looks like I'm going to the basement.
---
I am not excited to be unable to find a pallet because my "team" have wasted them all just to advance their challenges, nor am I excited to face Spirits non-stop until everyone completes the grab challenge.
---
Your mileage may vary.
---
It is now well rated. It has a negative -1 when I posted.
---
Could be. I mean, mine is only a theory based on what has been provided to us thus far. I don’t mean to imply that I am absolutely correct.
---
Deviljho next licensed killer?!
---
What are her survivor perks?
---
I only bought the costume itself for the 400 credits. No point in buying the mask or the knife imo.
---
Is anybody else having the archive page 2 challenges get completed twice as fast?
---
- I self cared myself once and got the master challenge for doing it twice
---
- I used up one emergency medkit (16 charges) with addons that made it 32 charges total, and it says I have depleted a total of 4 medkits now
---
Didnt have to wait long after this
---
Is it too obvious? Then discard the idea, that's how it works *cough like for spirit teaser cough*
---
This is dope. Can’t wait to get more information!
---
1, take it or leave it
---
No that's stupid. Pay to win has no business in this game
---
Not even a survivor main and I think that challenge is pretty damn hard for no reason. Especially since if you think about it the only real way you can get 3 gens done is if someone else distracts the killer, or you get lucky and don't get found. How do you complete gens while being chased or on the hook?
---
Oh yeah?
---
It seems like you've never done any mistakes and you were always perfect
---
But what if they complain about tunneling?
---
Probably just to avoid the outrage mob
---
BASED
---
Some things like Photoshop Flowey, the True Lab and Chara were quite disturbing though.
---
Nah, most people have at least one treasure hunting build and then throw on a coin. Got that one done and even escaped.
---
As you've probably found out, that particular challenge didn't need a Mori - normal sacrifices counted too.
---
Y'all it's *clearly* pinhead.
---
Their are as many genders as there are viable killers
---
Ok it's pointless if you're that delusional to discuss with you..
---
I never said that was rin voice but strawman and go for the obvious answer is a ritual I guess
---
Welp, only time would say. Like for the spirit teaser and everybody thought was a samurai. You must have been one of them at the time
---
Wait, facecamped by Hag?
---
That's... pointless
---
I’m talking from a no perk perspective. Neither killer nor survivor has a perk in the examples I gave. It’s a base scenario example.
---
Ofx perks will counter killers and survivors, lad. That’s why they exist.
---
r/woosh
---
Is exactly for that reason.. I explained it 3 times already
---
It's fine. Dw about it
---
Alot of people already own most perks and the dlc so they have alot of shards saved up. Having the ability to buy certain add ons for example spirits prayer beads would be a nightmare for survivors.  People would dc and waste the add ons that you bought.
---
Even tho the only way to get shards is by leveling up if you could buy them it is considered p2w because people would just buy the best add ons
---
Yeah don't worry, I had the same reaction at first until someone on this sub corrected me. They should have worded it better, especially considering "dead" and "sacrificed" are two different things in game. In all other contexts "kill" means using a mori or equivalent perk/add-on.
---
Really stupid that you get so little from a disconnect,  I suck snd usually get 20k bp so a disconnect should be 5k. 3 downs+3 hooks is more than 2k pft.
---
She's getting her shock therapy in 🤣
---
I'm sure I've made mistakes in grammar and syntax. But the internet's been around a while. Spelling hasn't been an issue.
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dphg5i/saw_someone_in_a_server_im_in_accidentally_gain/).
---
So should the full reveal happen tomorrow or Friday?
---
I love these moments as killed, but I also enjoy playing along like, “Oh sorry, I guess you are busy; I’ll come back later.”
---
How dare you not credit me. ):
---
I GET THAT AND WOULD LIKE THAT TOO
---
Nurses calling here I come!
---
Yeah, just did it. What's the problem?
---
Only reason I see to tunnel someone is if they teabag  otherwise use good perks and map knowledge to your advantage. It helps lower the toxicity of the community.
---
I would be behind this. I have so many worthless add ons just sitting there
---
Sorry hard to tell to many people keep thinking I’m talking about cross play
---
Play spirit or nurse
---
Every pallet has been dropped early in the few games I played this morning.
---
Like people forget how to stun because of the challenge.
---
Guys
---
It's obviously Rin's mom
---
Oh, that one was the same way. I ended up slugging for that one too. I apologize in post-chat because I felt like such a jerk.
---
I've had this happen but like, at the shack, on god pallet, when I didn't even know they were near me
---
They’ll complain regardless, do what you gotta do to win, fuck their feelings
---
Or, Cha Ching
---
*you can ignore comments who put a Q or a + at the end of LGBT because those are the extremists*
---
I say this because anything after T has only ruined the image of the LGBT as a whole and has caused them to lose support
---
Yeah! I'm stoked to bring in more chapters related to existing characters. Not to mention, another location on the Yamaoka estate would be pretty neat to see.
---
Let me ask, if I’m the killer and you get hooked and then unhooked and I run back and happen to only see you running away.... what should I do?
---
Non-sarcastically, this is the one thing I want most in the game right now (for all killers).
---
I can’t find a link to it :/
---
well hopefully its a killer that's enjoyable for you lore wise. As long as they're fun, I dont really care either way
---
It's because the mask is the only license, the character himself and his background is original so naturally his outfit is also original.
---
So I can straight up buy the new cosmetics and not need to actually buy anything else? Like if I was to buy scoops ahoy Steve I wouldn't need to buy the stranger things pack?
---
Open the game go to news tab and the link will be there
---
Alright hear me out, i'm probably gonna sound dumb as shit but here it goes.
---
I don't think it's Rin's dad, rather a family ancestor or something. Rewatching both this trailer and the original spirit teaser, the voices sound completely different. Obviously the entity or whatever spooky abyss magic could have warped his voice, but i don't think this is the case. With the video going in reverse and the blood going back into the mask, i'm thinking that maybe just maybe, Rin's dad going all sashimi chef on his family broke some sort of seal or something, causing this ancestor or demon or something to come back. Again that's just a weird theory i have but it would be cool if this were to happen. Also Rin's father as a survivor would be pretty dope.
---
I ain’t at home rn so I can’t do it without a link sorry
---
Wrong, it's most likely one of her ancestors now from what the teaser implies. Probably the guy mentioned in the estate lore.
---
Man thats some really cool dbd fanart, but who is the killer on the left, is that a fanmade killer?
---
Well at that point it's all fair game its partially my fault for not staying with my team and its partially my team's fault for not taking some hits unless you have make your choice or your a bubba I see no reason to not take some hits for a teammate
---
I agree with the notion that it encourages people to play like assholes, but they aren't difficult. I haven't looked at all of them but they really don't seem so hard. With Agitation and Iron Grasp I easily did the first challenge in a game. Same with Self Care and Botany Knowledge for 2 self care heals in 1 match. I haven't seen anything difficult yet. But we all know what Level 4 looks like...
---
Very true, I moried 2 people after double hooking them and hung the other 2 like my dirty laundry!
---
They probably know spawn points and you don't. Some maps are ez for hatch.
---
Not screaming doesn't mean we don't get notified. jsyk. It just means that you don't scream. ;)
---
I would really love to see survivor versions of existing killers, and vice versa. I don't think that *all* of them would do well as opposites, but I think there are lots who could be really interesting and add a little more depth to DBD's lore.
---
Pinhead is, hellraiser
---
From what I’ve seen, not common at all. It usually favors the killer. I wonder if maybe the last survivor was hatch camping
---
You need to buy the character too...not necessarily the whole DLC pack. You have to own the character you want cosmetics for.
---
yeah that’s gonna be a phat DC from me and my friends tbh, that shit is painfully boring
---
All of those perks are good to counter most of the killer roster. But if you're having trouble with certain stealth killers (for example) then you give up one of your "meta" perks and put that spine chill on or something. And I rarely see a stridor spirit unless they just started the game.
---
Rank reset maybe? You have to do less for merciless at a lower rank.
---
I never been so hyped since ghostface for any game before
---
Yeehaahaa boi
---
you are whining about absolutely nothing
---
&gt; I feel like its expanding upon a character the fanbase enjoys
---
really? with all the "spirit bad" posts on here i couldn't tell anyone enjoys her lol
---
Hard agree. I thought the sacrifice one surv in EGC meant the entity had to eat them so I had to slug and play like a dick to get it done. Only later did I learn...
---
Because i too am sick of the bitch especially when you are the one who started it
---
It was so obvious the whole time. I wish Behaviour wasn't so PREDICTABO with who it was gonna be.
---
But you look great
---
Oh I see lol I overthought that
---
Tunneling isn't chasing the weakest survivor. Tunneling is exclusively chasing one survivor, to the extent that you're ignoring everything else around you.
---
Thats the actual meaning of tunneling, which comes from tunnel vision which literally means you focus entirely one one thing.
---
Why do people like to play dumb and rewrite the meaning of words?

For anyone looking to buy the classic Ghostface costume, it’s currently bugged. When I hold up my knife to stalk, the entire sleeve covers up the right side of the screen.
---
She had the deaf boys ear
---
Not one bit.
---
No it’s a exterminator vs tough bastard rats experience
---
What if this is a start of something and they're going back to the lore and recreating the events that led the killers to be..well, killers.  
---
What if we end up getting Rin's father as the killer and Rin herself as a survivor?
---
Stridor Spirit is the meta bro, did you watch last weeks tournament?
---
Oh so I need to pay £4 and then however many auric cells it is for the cosmetic
---
Are there specific spawn points for the hatch? Or does it randomly appear?
---
Maybe? Most of the survivors did indeed vanish mysteriously, but I think it's fair to suspend expectations and just go with whatever the fuck happens in the Entity's Realm - it can obviously pull people from many realities, times and places so why be limited to a single universe? :O
---
Its too bad they stuck it in the shittiest realm for some reason.
---
is it safe my security says that it could harm my device?
---
So...
---
 I crouch quickly twice in rapid succession as a "Thank you." I do this to survivors who heal me, killers who let me leave, etc. Am I the only one? Would this be considered toxic?
---
The EGC one was the bane of my existence, as a primary survivor player who only really only plays killer for dailys.  All my killers are still level 1 because I’m relatively new and focusing on survivors, and with matchmaking being as  atrocious as it is I spent days and over a dozen games before I got it, and only by being a scummy facecamper when I finally got someone on a hook during EGC.  I was just thinking “I literally don’t care if everyone else escapes, I get this single kill and I can finally go back to not caring if the survivors crush me/all escape and make playing killer fun again.”
---
I felt a *little* less bad since it was a game of getting teabagged at pallets and general BM because matchmaking decided throwing a level 1 killer at rank 16 against a 3-man SWF at rank 6 was gonna be a fun match for anyone involved, but I still hate doing it and wanted more than anything to not be in that situation.
---
Legion doesn’t have an obsession perk but yeah you can stack them
---
I don’t think this is true. Peanuts clarified on the forums that you only need to be involved in the gen’s completion, not be on it from start to finish.
---
Yeah? How? Lmfao, you need to be injured. What are you, Tru3? *misses attack on uninjured survivor* "is that dead hard? fookin' dead hard man".
---
I thought he has a ponytail and that's a new hair for him
---
Getting grabs with Meyers isn't that bad, especially if you bring use dead rabbit and monitor and abuse. Definitely relies on the map though.
---
Imagine being mad at a satirical post. My discord is going to love you, enjoy the fame.
---
No waaaaay
---
Well that all depends. If were all grouped up and I happen to be injured then no its not tunneling but if my team is blocking you or trying to take hits for me and you still refuse to go for anyone but me than yeah its tunneling.
---
32,000 is the max amount of points you can get, unless you have an offering or a perk that grants you more. It’s the same cap for killer and survivor
---
DBD was already in the violent video games compilation that the White House made a while ago...

God, I hope so. I’d pay good money for an Oni samurai with some authentic armor.
---
It's more than cool actually... DBD Killers can't function without internet, but guess who can

Oh if Peanuts said it then it's settled, I'm glad if this is the case.

I don't give a shit about your discord. Be sure to link the post tho k.
---
same
---
I am, r/KarmaCourt
---
This sounds so cool, Dad is fine but this seems like it has more potential character and is atleast somewhat distanced from Rin. Id love to see this come to fruition
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one with this issue.
---
As far as I know, I haven’t played since the very beginning. It’s been that way for 2 1/2 years though.
---
Yes curve me at a window that takes 3 seconds to get to either side. I can slow vault that bitch all day and force an m1.
---
Press the ability button while looking at a survivor to stalk while stalking they’re outline will turn from white to red when it’s a deep red youve gained all the evil you can from them and cannot stalk them anymore (I think you’re able to hook them and that resets the evil but I’m not entirely sure) at tier 1 your terror radius is very short you move slow and you have no red stain at tier 2 he’s basically an average killer at tier 3 you perform actions quicker and can one shot survivors as long as it’s active about perks I’m not sure I’ve seen people use monitor and abuse on him a lot so that’ll probably be good
---
Bamboozle is the meta perk for billy, next!
---
There’s a “challenge” to drop 15 pallets while being chased. This isn’t a challenge, this is asking to screw your team over.
---
WAAAH WAAAH
---
I said I might not say it because it was my opinion. Shelter woods and underground facility are better for killer imo.
---
Have fun with that. I've got better things to do than argue with a child you have a nice day.
---
None of these seem super difficult they just seem time consuming, they better have a high bloodpoint payout
---
The point of the post though is that it's promoting unfun gameplay
---
A child that pissed off an adult with a satire post. Mmmmm, yes.
---
Not everything has to be a narrative dude. If it says that you have to complete 3 generators by yourself while before the game clearly said to do the "equivalent" of 3 gens then it's fair to argue that this time it's different. I'm not trying to fight you I just didn't agree with what you're saying.
---
But anyway, apparently peanuts confirmed that you don't need to do 3 gens from the start by yourself, so that's settled. I'm glad that's the case.
---
This is some good content. I'll take another.
---
Not for Switch :)))))))))))))
---
Tag yourself I’m the guy who got hooked first
---
But which survivor wouldn't suggest DS?
---
That’s why it feels arbitrary and lazy.
---
Depends on if ure playing killer or survivor and if u take the game from both perspectives. the story of the spirit is interesting and her overall gameplay is something different to the game. is she an annoyance to play against if u get someone good? Yes, but it pushes ur buttons til u play well enough to outplay the spirit. most people just get annoyed though and say shes too overpowered. instead of taking into perspective they just have to learn how the overall character works, if that makes sense?
---
I'm betting it'll be an ancient Oni that's terrorized the family for generations.
---
I like this theory! I mean, it IS showing us a mask, and clowns do wear masks (paint, etc.), so I agree that it could still be Pennywise!
---
What kinda hybrid have people been asking for?
---
I understand that, but I've never seen it spawn next to a person who is just standing there before, but I've seen it happen the last 2 games in a row.
---
A lot of people will use monitor and abuse so his already small terror radius in tier 2 becomes even smaller. Ideally at the beginning of a match you will approach where you think survivors are and stalk them. If they don't see you while you're in tier one, just stand there and get to tier two. You have to hold the stalk button for it to go up, it's not a toggle.
---
I'm just happy you can buy the outfit.
---
I run self-care because I'm solo, but watching people try to get off the hook ruffles my jimmies
---
Giving the mentally disabled people their needs. Seems kinda wrong..
---
I got to R1 playing wraith Pre-Wraith box about a month after I got the game- It was not fun, I only new anger and hatred and I decided to put the game down for a while due to toxic survivors. Wraith is boring as hell also.
---
I got to R1 playing Spirit coming back to the game after a year in like 1 week- Incredibly fun, dumpstering cocky SWF and Sweats with big brain plays, I got tonnes of salty messages and I enjoyed reading each and every one. It took me a day to pick her up and get really good and I have a natural affinity when it comes to competitive games and I learnt new techniques and put them to practice nearly every match.
---
Your argument sucks. Spirit isn't a free win if you know how to play, survivors are lazy and don't want to (Or don't have the capacity to) adapt and overcome
---
tomes can be completed any time, even after the rift closes
---
Do you mean like in Deceit?
---
no im reds. and like I said Devs dont care about rank one play? They are balancing this for casuals. You're getting a little toxic with me and everyone else commenting when we are just trying to discuss. Chill dude
---
Yes, probably why I got 30 some stealth on top of the 70 chase percentage
---
smh my head now you're creating the narrative there isn't a narrative
---
&gt; I'm not trying to fight you I just didn't agree with what you're saying.
---
Look, what I'm saying is literally how the previous round of rift challenges worked. That is what I am pulling from. It is objective. I Suppose it was possible that was a bug or mistake, but it's true. So I see no reason, yet, why it wouldn't also apply in level 2
---
Him and 150 of his friends are all rank 1 tournament players so he is obviously right lmao. Spirit fury enduring is also meta on nurse didn't ya know?
---
Babysitter Ahoy
---
Worry not! While everyone else is doing this challenge, do the dark sense one since they're too busy self caring in the corner to do gens!
---
Because I wanted to know what it meant???
---
I must warn thy, a bug is currently going on where the classic skin completely covers about half the screen when you are in a chase. God speed
---
That makes zero sense.
---
Spirit is counterable tho
---
Stalking is just looking at survivor while holding M2
---
Tier 1evil within you have no terror radius and no red stain but barely no lunge and walk super slow
---
T2 Evil Within  20 meter terror radius and normal walk speed and lunge range
---
T3 Evil Within you instadowns big terror radius, long ass lunge range and increased vault speed but after some time you will go back to T2 and will have stalk to get back to T3
---
merry cakemas
---
I was pretty sure it would be Daddy but I forgot about this. Good catch.
---
Well it's not a free game so I asume you can't.
---
This is even better than my idea! Mathieu, is that you?
---
Me when I try too get DS before I prestige
---
\*laughs in Commodious Toolbox, Instructions, Socket Swivles, Prove Thyself, Streetwise and Red Forest offering\*
---
Have you thought about dlc crossing over too though? Imagine playing on console or PC and moving over to the other for some reason after buying the dlc characters, then having to buy them again if you want to play them even though you bought it once already
---
Pig is inherently unfun to play against and ineffective- if she just follows a trapped survivor its a guranteed game over. She needs a larger variety of traps that increase her skill ceiling while simultaneously allowing for more counterplay.
---
Not to mention they don't even work, the drop 15 pallets in a chase is impossible since it wont count even if you do it correctly and escape.
---
Neigh
---
She’s not OP it’s a guessing game.  The game is INTERACTIVE.  What’s interactive about fighting something you can’t see
---
You're so full of shit &amp; you know it
---
Yes. Just yes.
---
Go to settings. Open system settings and press Up, Down, Left, Left, Up, X, Up, Square, Down, Down, Left, X, X, Circle, Up, Square. If entered correctly, you will hear "Just pay for it dud" from Ohpedo. Dbd will be free for download after.
---
Wait i don't get it... What do these people have in pants?
---
The best deterrent from me chasing you is to not play shirtless Jake. Or... pink hair... whoever has pink hair. I honestly don’t know survivors and their outfits as well as killers.
---
I want a time travel ability. Like just put the game 10 seconds back.
---
Yeah today
---
I dont know why people are downvoting this, would be putting a trans survivor in this game really be a bad thing? The cast is already incredibly diverse. I dont see the problem.
---
Are easy ones?
---
And now that guy is the next killer
---
perk: absolute Chad
---
when in a chase, you get a massive erection. your walking speed increases by 7%/8%/9%. Ignores bloodlust.
---
Never heard of it until now. That game looks really awesome, like a complex "Trouble in Terrorist Town". 
---
But yeah, similar to that. Hypothetically a fun idea
---
The new bright Clown cosmetic was also bugged, on this case it was the knife. It looks like you're "fingering" the survivors. xD
---
No they are pretty tedious
---
Ah so there are 17 genders
---
Holy shit, I actually would have understood what this meant without looking up a translation. I'm such a weaboo.
---
This gender does not exist
---
Game not worth playing.
---
All the rank reset asshats are farming self care acheeves...have died on my first hook twice now.
---
Time for a couple day break while the rtards mess up the game for everyone.
---
&gt;I was trying to poke fun at myself. chill
---
That's why I've added the shaking my smh head! I was joking too :D I'm sorry, I'm not that great at humor.
---
You can read their description in the archives, first one says to repair a total of 2, second one says to repair 3 completely.
---
I hate when this happens then I die on the first hook.
---
Not... *completely* overpowered, I don't feel like she's terribly oppressive, but I do believe she is overtuned and needs to be changed
---
Google translator is pretty bad.
---
That quest is bugged in general. I only self cared once in trial and I still got full credit for the challenge. I was only ever injured once too. I died on my first hook after that.
---
Just i imagine
---
Wow, those challenges are rough. Looks like I’ll be forcing my boyfriend to play it with me because I really can’t think of easier ways to do some of them.
---
Yeah,  I could see why,  just thought it'd be a cool concept
---
The Japanese at the beginning was a male voicd
---
Seriously wtf?  Who thought some of these challenges were a good idea?  It's just going to lead to major sandbagging/unfun tactics.
---
Thinking non binary people are mentally disabled is like... oh why do I bother, we both know you dont give a shit or have applied any thought to this, you just hate lgbt people.
---
???
---
&gt;Imagine if a 2 killer and 8 survivor mode came out
---
Imagine twice more bugs. But still would be fun.
---
Honestly, that would be so fitting and satisfying having Rin's father be doomed to an eternity of escaping his daughter's rage and bloodlust that he caused. I actually can absolutely see BHVR doing that, as it lends credence to the idea that the Entity works to harvest the pleasure of killers catching and sacrificing their prey.
---
Just use brown medkits, or are you complaining BHVR wants you to heal when the meta says "you should be doing gens"
---
i seems neither of us has any ability to communicate humor at all lol
---
Maybe even The Father
---
Blinding killers and hooking people in the basement happen all the time regardless of the challenges. It may seem like unfun gameplay but they are still mechanics in the game and people still play that way so why not reward them with a challenge?
---
It’s frustrating being blinded as a killer but you can still do well, and same goes for being hooked in basement as a survivor. 
---
Personally I appreciate the challenges regardless of what they are because it gives me something to strive to.
---
It's ok, you win some and you lose some. Not every horror ends with the killer on top, you'll kill em next time, I know it
---
*Ursala was hilarious! You little snot!*
---
This would be cool as hell, and I like the idea way more than Rin’s dad. And if the design is a samurai in an Oni mask, I’m sold.
---
Look at me, I'm the killer now.
---
Oh that's weird but queueing up as 4 davids is perfectly normal. Of course.
---
you cant buy shards lmao
---
Why, because I stated an opinion and it was wrong? Nah, I'm a little more thick-skinned than that.
---
Ahhhhhhhhhh!
---
Sorry for the incivility but you're a dumbass
---
Do you mean they escaped immediately after being the only survivor left alive?
---
If so, the hatch spawns after (number of survivors minus 2) generators are finished, and only opens when one survivor is left. They may have found it beforehand.
---
Sex and gender are different
---
mind games my guy
---
they are going to nerf her so hard that she becomes a survivor and her cool daddy become the killer
---
There was a Tome level 1 challenge requiring you to escape as Claudette.
---
One joke
---
You totally sound like an entitled “memelord.”
---
Um what idiot killer are you tunnelling and getting d striked? Lol. Its a 60 second timer you cant down them and chase someone else for a minute? Or not try to hook the same survivor right away? Good killers dont get d striked because they aren't that stupid. Sure you can eat a d strike or just play around it but you're probably getting d striked 4 times a game tunnelling the injured unhooked survivor huh? Doesn't make sense. Unless its endgame camping a hooked survivor that's the only time that d strike might be unavoidable besides that it's your fault
---
Not a glitch, that's just how the cosmetic is designed.
---
It is incredibly disappointing you're the only one who comprehended my post.
---
I finally got that done.
---
I tried the Agitation + 2 in basement challenge, I even switched from my main (Plague) to Legion so that I wouldn't screw people out of their healing challenges. 2 DC's and a suicide on hook once I got one person in the basement and left. smh
---
You can’t see where she is, not sure how to mindgame something I literally cannot see
---
That supposed to mean something to me?
---
I will continue to normalize it to the day I die because it is normal and it is valid, and it certainly isnt mental illness, that's incredibly ridiculous you have no idea how much of a clown you sound like rn.
---
They need either a rework like Bubba or a buff. Before they were annoying but now they’re barely an issue if they don’t play extremely well.
---
/r/unexpectedBryzgalov
---
It's not a physics issue, either. If you wear the real version of this costume, you'd get the same thing.
---
and a Viking ?
---
We shouldn’t be accepting mental illness
---
I don't do swf except the occasional friend that I added months ago that invites me
---
why did you create this
---
smh ur brain is just too small i guess
---
&gt;I can't say I blame them
---
You should.
---
Mouse 1, where they only have one main attack
---
Did they confirm a new killer?
---
It's not a "trend" people are just discovering something new in gender theory.
---
Soloqueue during rank reset, people there are fucking morons
---
Legion is arguably the weakest killer in the game imo. Not really sure what can be done to make them better without making them stupidly strong, maybe not lose frenzy charge when you normal hit even though its only a small buff it could help I guess
---
well if u cant mind game the spirit ur really just not good at the game dont be asking for nerfs if ur juts plain not good
---
Have you not seen the teaser
---
It doesn’t work that way
---
They just need to make the sleeve roll down when he lifts his arm. It’s cloth anyways, it should fall down his arm.
---
who would unhook that guy ?
---
It's not like they are actually helpful, once I had them and wanted to use them before doing prestige.
---
All my matches were 2-4 dcs which ended up with brutal killer and very few BP lmao. I get more out of not using them.
---
I didn’t. Is it pinned on the sub?
---
Well it's just that you seemed so sure.
---
Omg its john wick robbing jamoaks house
---
I know this. I love seeing representation.
---
But what does that have to do in a situation where everyone spends the rest of their lives in a hell being killed or escaping killers forever? I know ship art is cute but I really doubt anyone is getting it on in the realm.
---
Legion is in a decent spot right now, you can injure multiple survivors and snowball pretty hard sometimes. The only thing i would do is increase Frienzy speed,  duration or even both of them and it would be in a pretty good spot.
---
Imo Clown, Doctor and Trapper are in a worse spot
---
See above response.
---
Punishing the farmed survivors for unsafe unhooks is considered tunneling by many. It's also more often than not the optimal play because that player will likely be injured. Tunneling is not.inherently bad killer gameplay from an optimal perspective.
---
i really hope hes a bigass oni dude wielding a club
---
Yeah but you can't  just run in a circle till  she catches up so it's too hard to beat
---
Pffft of course, why not. Four shirtless moaning men that look exactly the same is perfectly normal 👍
---
Hey I might’ve been one of your Quentin’s! The flair is my actual PS4 name, and if I’m not on Quentin I’m on Jeff and Meg.

Now at tier 1 he has no TR.

Way to delete your comments, and it does work that way, goodbye.

Isn't that stealth and survivor-esque gameplay kind of Legion's thing?
---
This game is like 80% paid dlc averaging 10 bucks each and still not F2P.

Was going to buy this today, hope it gets fixed soon

Asperger's is what I got out of it.

You say that but I'm not wrong. When people see lgbt now all they think of crazy SJW clips they see on YT. 
---
You dont have to agree with someone for it to be true.
---
Nice b8 m8
---
What I dont understand is how this actually got past the testing phase, the testing is literally meant to make sure shit like this does not happened.
---
Lagswitch is the boogeyman bad survivors blame when they lose.
---
He’d also cancel those out probably
---
Thinning or thickening the mist can be useful on any side though? It just depends who you're going against. If you're against a wraith and you made the fog even thicker it's gonna make it harder for you to see him coming but if you make it thinner you can see that wavy bastard make his way to you faster
---
Clown and doctor is understandable but why trapper?
---
Bruh wtf
---
Okay and.......? Doesn't take away the fact that it affirms players' gender identity.
---
What I was referring to is called Gender Dysphoria and it's a mental disorder
---
1 is incorrect, huntress has to grab new hatchets. That’s my only complaint with your list. 
---
3 doesn’t have to happen if you trap pallets and windows before starting a chase from my experience at rank 10. Not saying it’s incorrect but rather I just don’t see how that hurts trapper from my experience, even against purples. I don’t consider this a complaint.
---
That's an interesting solution, I like it!
---
I would also like if the stalk meter gradually went down. Potentially being 99% all game with no way of knowing is unfun.
---
On the other hand, he would need huge buffs in other areas if this were the case. I think much faster stalking and much shorter cool down would be good.
---
Can we have Nioh as survivor?
---
Except they didn’t dangle a carrot in your face. It was never even hinted at by the devs that pennywise was coming. They just followed a prominent horror author and you guys took it as confirmation that pennywise was being added. That on you, not the devs.
---
For Honor
---
Agreed
---
Wll obviously its gonna tack, she would be even more op andin dire need of her747464759795736263758696847262258062634th nerf
---
Or maybe they followed king because they are a horror based company, and he is considered one of the masters of horror?
---
if he catches a survivor in the locker... oh no. the possibilities. maybe he like, shoves his dick in their mouth and carries them to the hook
---
Yeah, just dont get hit noob, get gud
---
at first i was gonna ask what info do you have for it to be a guarunteed pennywise but then i realized the problem with your arguement is that in the past three licensed characters they pretty much just straightup said that these were the characters that are coming so then what arguement do you have for a garunteed pennywise
---
anyone else on playstation unable to get into a game as killer or survivor since the level 2 tome release?
---
That's exactly what I was thinking
---
Facts
---
I thought they fixed the blind hitbox, meaning you need to aim at the face?
---
Please tell me you’re joking. How does them following Stephen King mean they teased Pennywise?
---
actually swf got nerfed in the past with the gen speed being reduced when several people are on it at once
---
Behaviour needs to optimise console dbd first before that can even happen. The only way I can think of to make an option fair is by making it so only those with the option on can play together. That includes killers and survivors. This will increase queue times by A LOT.
---
Ironic. He could save others from downvotes but not himself.
---
Leatherface was a paragraph though
---
They did that follow on purpose.
---
So no it’s not “on me”
---
They literally knew people we’re watching their follows on twitter when they followed Nancy and Steve’s actors.
---
They actually unfollowed and refollowed Stephen King on purpose purely for this fact.
---
Maybe there's a chance they're still working on a deal for Pennywise? Calm down dude.
---
Only way is to derank to rank 20, have a full 4 swf, they juke the killer for the whole match, you repair
---
Yeah, I've been playing rank 1 survivor this week on ps4, I absolutely love the variety on console
---
“An excellent response”
---
I assure you I am quite calm.
---
Basically rin is very smol
---
imagine just watching Johnny fucking sins just slapping his dick against a generator in horror

Because a good team basically nullifies his power, also wastes a lot of time taking the traps and then placing them

---
Seeing as they admitted on stream that their idea for the entity was inspired by IT and that lore verse, I dont see why they wouldn't have been following him from the beginning.
---
So... rng? 
---
"Random box"
---
What's the translation when he speaks?
---
So what's new?
---
I know, was referring to Tome Level 2
---
Well I'm getting downvoted for you not knowing what the fuck you speak of. Go look it up! You are wrong. From rank 5 to 12 is 7 ranks guy. Not 5. Go read before you act like you know what you're talking about and being a dick about it.
---
I was, and I was wrong and I'm okay with that. Looking forward to some badass samurai ancestor killer.
---
At low ranks where you're at the majority of killers will be the free ones
---
No! What are you doing? Making the game fun for everyone involved and not just focusing on survivors complaints? How dare you!!!
---
Anyone want to SWF to get these done? Just inbox me if you’re on PC.
---
Have you been using the red or purple add ons
---
I don't see that as a problem, as the mask is already in the game, on Yamaoka's map.
---
Can you explain? How is dbd ghost face not Scream? Is it just licensed to the mask?
---
Idiots, it's clearly a spirit need.
---
Stats dont mean much, but new freddy really is viable and one of the top tier killers
---
Yeah, was thinking Kate and Feng would be more popular, but then I realized I think Kate comes from Clown DLC, and I'm not sure about Feng? Maybe it's just bad perks for her, people get too invested in characters with good perks and don't want to relevel what's essentially just a skin.
---
I would spend an infinite amount of money on this game if this happened
---
Yup, not trying to fuck with you I just found it funny. I was actually kinda disappointed at first that we were finally getting a Japanese themed killer and it turned out not to be a samurai.
---
Of course the game costs money, the devs have to keep the lights on.  And you still get top-tier content without any paid DLCs.
---
Chapter 69: Sinful Thoughts
---
Rin father worst killer choice ever.
---
Because they knew people were watching who they follow based on when they followed Nancy and Steve’s actors on twitter.
---
This is how we basically got confirmation that it was a stranger things chapter before it was officially announced.
---
They purposely unfollowed and refollowed Stephen King as a way to low key signal it to the rest of the community.
---
It was definitely like a nudge nudge hint hint kinda deal.
---
Honestly? It would throw balance out the window if Survivors had more than 4 people, or if there was more than one killer.
---
Which is why they should let you change the number of survivors/killers in custom games but leave public matches as 4v1, Custom Games are meant to be fun matches played with and against friends. They can keep balancing the game in favor of public matches but I want to be caught in a bear trap while afflicted by Madness 3, asleep and with a reverse bear trap ticking on my head.
---
For sure, I think either way if they're going to introduce Dad Yamoaka, he needs to be a Survivor. If he's the Killer, Rin needs to be a Survivor (Outfit for Feng) otherwise they miss out on the dynamic.
---
You don’t die faster on hook anymore though
---
I can only imagine how good that must feel :P
---
It makes me so mad that I want to rip both our shirts off.
---
This reverse psychology thing that killer mains are trying to do to stop survivors from using Self-Care is super transparent. Just like survivor mains who say Ruin is a hindrance to killers.
---
You're arguing with another person over pipping? Calm down keybaord warrior.
---
And still holds more value than your pointless cynicism
---
Pretty sad that you go on random posts that have nothing to do with gender identity to try and stir people up and act high and mighty for putting other people down.
---
You can play anyone and put points into whatever bloodweb you want.
---
Ruin is top tier in rank 20-7 after this its just better to learn to use something like corrupt intervention.
---
No joke, as a pig main, I'd kinda want this to happen for 1 or 2 days.  Most killers would play Pig that week either for memes or to help their homies out, the entire bloodpoint economy would collapse by the end of it, everyone would max out their characters and gear, and the grind would FINALLY end.  Then, when everyone has a billion of the most busted things in the game and is free to use them indiscriminately, maybe the devs would see just how fundamentally broken the game is and try to actually change it on a fundamental level rather than just applying increasingly elaborate bandages.
---
Ghostface is so mad. He's all about attention, and the biggest attention grab of his entire career just got stolen by some angry Japanese man.
---
the max has always been 32k, but the event postula petals let you get +3k per hook for each petal so maybe that
---
Nah I think the dad could be pretty cool
---
Nah, you just sound like a dick
---
Oh fuck I can’t believe they done this
---
Man, if only there weren't 8 other posts about this already.
---
Reminder that gen tp doesnt effect your movement speed in any way and you can constantly spam a fake teleport on any gen during a chase. I highly recommend it, it has no downsides and it pressures survivors a lot and/or conditions them to fake teleports, so that when you actually do teleport they might not have left the gen.
---
\*looks down\* uhh, there's only one problem with that.
---

---
I vault window vault never happen  killer is far away i get teleport to the killer and got hit ?

---
“It was definitely like a nudge nudge hint hint kinda deal” 
---
No it wasn’t. They simply followed one of the best horror writers on Twitter. Nothing more. If you’re complaining that it’s a “red herring” that’s on you. They didn’t tease anything.
---
You want the terror radius to be in frenzy tho?
---
That is unfair asf
---
Kinda sorta depends on if you're the killer or survivor.

If you're the survivor in question just run decisive strike, Bill in a can purple med kit replacement for Insta heal, speed perks like adrenaline or sprint burst off the hook can help. Lithe could too. 
---
If you're the killer tunneling them right off the hook for no real reason you're missing out on applying pressure and more bp
---
Yea, it requires you to play a bit differently for a few rounds (depending on luck) but you could knock both challenges out in 2 games.  Just be sure to talk to the other survivors, and ask them to let you do your plunder challenge.  Especially if you say you're bringing a gifts build (Plunders+Ace) where there will be tons of nice items left around to pick up, many will even throw a coin on for you.
---
I'm sure they'll fix it. Something like this:
---
**Right Arm invisibility:**  **Price:** 600 auric cells.
---
Im on console i have video
---
So I'll get these challenges done very quickly is what you're telling me?
---
Console
---
Also worth noting that you should use the time you're in tier 3 as well as you can since there's only so many times you can do it per match. If someone is red when you stalk them and you have a choice between them or someone else you should go for the red one because they won't give you stalk for the rest of the game. Also abuse the fact he has a bigger lunge in tier 3 since people get so used to the normal range they get cocky and easy to hit
---
It’s a cumulative total of repairing 3 gens
---
Not only this, but contracting licensed killers still takes time, which means they may be doing one of those killers still. So be patient and quit acting entitled.
---
and the fact that he wouldn’t stay dead would make it worse
---

Time to play slow heals legion
---
gg piece of shit
---
I meeaannnn no on has said it yet soooo I feel like it must be said: Nea’s the killer Confirmed.
---
It’s why she’s separated and there’s no one in the “killer” spot because you can’t have 2 but she’s posing as a survivor.
---
Any match, around the icon for his power there is a bar that fills up as you stare at survivors. In Tier 1 you have no Terror radius or red stain so at the beginning of the match you can find somebody on a generator and usually pull them right off it for a quick hook. Once you get to care to you start moving faster and are a normal color. Then it's a good idea to stalk until you're far is 99% filled up, then wait until you're directly behind a survivor to finish filling it to go into tier 3 because at base it only lasts for 1 minute. Tier 3 is when they are exposed and a one-hit down.
---
Has perk play with your food is really good. You have to chase the Survivor that is the obsession and let them go and you gain tokens for it changing how fast do you move depending on how many you have. Easiest way for me to do this is memorize 3 player names and their characters in the lobby, then once the match starts you look in the lower right corner to see who the obsession is so you know which one to chase and let go. then I like to use pop goes the weasel, spies from the Shadows and surveillance. Hope some of this helps, good luck.
---
I’m not sure either cause at a certain point a lot of things escape the BHVR testing phase.
---
Goose new killer?!
---
Exactly, and then I run around with the items I don't need and hook them up with primo medkits, toolboxes and flashlights with awesome addons.
---
off topic: is BK good for an altruistic build?
---
My idea for legion to make him more fun and useful is to make the idea of hitting all 4 survivors with frenzy much more beneficial. 
---
They start fairly similar to as it is now,  but as he gets more survivors tagged his frenzy gets more powerful.  Duration gets longer, movement and vaulting speeds are increased and terror radius increases. So one hit resets duration like it does now, but also increases timer by like 20% and a small speed boost. As he hits the 2nd and 3rd survivor, the duration increases even more, increasing the likelihood of hitting the 4th survivor. 
---
Where the real fun comes is hitting the 4th survivor, it would be an instadown attack that immediately takes them out of frenzy and reduces their terror radius to 0 for a set amount of time. 
---
The idea is everybodys mend timers start going down instantly. (And perhaps the 2nd or 3rd survivor hit has a shorter deep wounds timer). Legion can go for the hook or slug and try to capitalize on the no terror radius to hunt (honestly probably should be the undetectable buff)
---
The idea is being the first or even 2nd survivor is critical to avoiding legion to prevent the snowball effect, but to also give a good reason for legion to go for all 4 (and much more achievable)
---
There’s a wraith with his pink wrapped dong add-on
---
:(
---
I have the challenge with plunderers on my tier 1 still and cant accept it.
---
Ash, Feng, ans Jeff are the only valid answers.
---
And redpilled
---
Yeah that's a very good point.  The problem is DbD has no voice chat, and I find at my rank (14-16ish) often my teammates will just be sneaking around in bushes or following me anticipating the unhook when I am running from the killer.
---
Also, you can buy some killers (like Spirit) with the level up shards (not blood points or auric cells). So you don't even need to pay to access all content.
---
If you got the game for free like many did last year, you literally never had to pay for any content content unless you wanted it. So many skins are available through those shards.
---
Now comes the fun part of trying to get out of red ranks
---
Ohohoho nooo
---
The fact that everyone knows who Johnny sins is gives me hope for humanity, but remember it’s no but November 😤
---
When you realize his dream bullshit is in YOUR dreams that YOU control
---
Can we just stop pretending that making Prayer Beads ultra rare somehow makes them balanced? They're broken. Old MoM and DS had far more counterplay
---
I'm the survivor, I dont run DS because most killers I go against go after the one that unhooked, especially at the beginning of the game.
---
Yes but generally people dont do chests so there are frequently games you can do 3 chests in 1 match.
---
I really hope we get Rin as a survivor.
---
&gt;Completely repair 3 gens using the perk Dark Sense (single trial)
---
what the fuck.
---
You're a really kind person have a *boop* ;)
---
Though you forgot to reduce her movement speed to .00009462
---
restart steam.
---
I... feel pretty stupid now. I was just hanging here, pressing that button “oh that’s blurring my screen, pretty.” and just continued with the game. Thank you.
---
TF you talking about? If you didnt 4K as pig, there is no hope left for you concidering how op she would be
---
Special Attack: Jigsaw Box RNG
---
For each survivor with a jigsaw box on their head, there is a 25/50/75% chance they will get it off on their first try
---
Okay boomer. Relax.
---
Survivor collision while phasing is my main issue with her. The "no counterplay" argument is mostly garbage, but there really is nothing you can do when an invisible force slams into you, prevents you from vaulting or whatever, and can then immediately hit you
---
"His tp has a cooldown"
---
Lol ok? It will be full by the time you need to tp somewhere after hooking a survivor, still incredibly useful. No other killers have it.
---
"His snares only work while asleep"
---
 true and valid, but you're overstating the consequences of this, a lot of the time survivors do not care to wake themselves up, so more often than not survivors are asleep
---
"His snares have the same slowdown as clown, which is a terrible killer"
---
This isnt really an argument at all, clown is a bad killer sure, but that doesn't make a 15 percent slowdown bad at all??? Freddy and clown are two different killers with two different powers. Freddy is just a BETTER clown.
---
"You can loop him and finish all the gens if you're a good survivor"
---
Uh ok, that's what the game is, literally applies to every killer (maybe not nurse, but just replace the word loop with juke and it still applies)
---
Tldr freddy is a good killer and the only legitimate complaint of him you made is that his powers dont help in chases if the survivor is awake, which isnt too harmful to make him bad, a small downside.
---
See but the thing is a good survivor knows to check windows and pallets because thats obv which is where the mind game part comes in also huntress has to get more but she can hold multiple hachets and not just one
---
No you can't. If you had No Mither I think you can twice
---
No you can’t.
---
It was a joke dude

Thanks a lot. I’ve read about getting the Evil Within II to 99 but not activate the Evil Within III when I’m behind a survivor.
---
As if they had a choice in this day and age?
---
Team Yamaoka blasting off again!
---
well you probably just got lucky with the 4%, I’m assuming you mean using unbreakable off the hook, not off the ground cause that’s actually impossible, while unbreakable will give you the 100% of getting off the hook and slippery meat will only increase your chances of escaping the hook, you probably just got lucky and got that 4% chance of escape.
---
Ahem
---
&gt; Ruin
---
&gt; Pop
---
&gt; Corrupt 
---
&gt; that other perk im forgetting the name of that blocks gens when you down someone
---
&gt; Don’t stay in a chase too long
---
&gt; Kick more gens
---
&gt;
---
OH SHIT! I forgot to mention she cant put them on survs, only the other way around.
---
i actually agree with you, especially since the opening quote is "your blood belongs to the yamaoka's." rin's father wouldn't say that.
---
however... this also means that the new killer will need a whole backstory as to why the entity would choose it. it'd be weird to have  rin/her dad's family haunted by a demon prior to the entity getting involved.  has there been any precedence of supernatural things happening in "the real world" prior to the entity coming into play?
---
Your argument is that wraith is a boring killer, that is just your own preference you found a killer you enjoyed and that’s a good thing. However spirit is been statistically shown to be easier to play and ravaged survivor teams. If not a nerf she needs a rework. This isn’t special to dead by daylight characters in these types of games go through checks and balances and are nerfed or buffed constantly. But having one character dominate over others through a really over powered power totally breaks down the availability of other characters. It turns people away from other characters who want to succeed or just want an easy victory. I can see how that would be frustrating for the survivor team as well. Also it’s kind of a double standard saying survivors should try to overcome issues when you couldn’t overcome toxic survivors as other killers.
---
well i’m sorry that your sensitive ass is offended by a joke from a few years ago
---
Pig is fine, she doesn’t need a rework or a buff. Git gud
---
Shugoki?
---
I try to avoid killing survivors and I still end up pipping because I do literally everything that isn't sacrificing survivors.
---
There is talk in the lore of an ancestor of the family who was a great warrior, he's got my bet.
---
Called it.
---
I was planning on buying it, can you guys tell me how stealthy it is? Is it actually dark in game? Or did bhvr make him a fucking neon reflective sign
---
That's exactly what it was. They could only get a license to the name and mask, not the outfit.
---
Man that's was an awesome choice
---
Yeah I only run SC solo. 30 second heals suck but self care has won me so many plays/games.
---
A single play test would have caught this like lol
---
He did facecamp tbh
---
The only one even slightly hard is fully repairing 3 gens in a match.
---
2 flashlight stuns and 4 traps are the next tier simply because some people don't really use flashlights or play trapper.
---
The rest are pretty simple to do.
---
I think it's something like "your blood belongs to the yamaokas" or something.
---
I've been waiting for this Ghostface outfit for so long! THANK YOU DEVS!
---
Its always possible that it isnt an ancestor still like an oni or something? Well have to wait who knows
---
Uh what?
---
I'd let Rin wreck me in that schoolgirl outfit any day. OwO
---
basically. i was thinking more like the nioh onis
---
You complete 3 gens it’s pretty easy you hold down a button and hit skill checks
---
Not necessarily, when I play killer there’s four survivors I put in my chart, and when I play survivor there’s three survivors and only one killer I put in my chart, so I mark down far more survivors than killers. But I do play killer quite often
---
I’m not talking about you fairy princess.
---
No I didn't dis connect
---
Imagine a world where a follow on social media has power to control your emotions.

2k upvotes?

It's annoying they have done trapper again

I play Dota 2 and am very familiar with the fine-tuning and balancing on a meticulous level, BHVR ought to take notes because they seem to be more interested in selling nostalgiabait cosmetics and bing bing wahoo funnyman clothes for dwight

In the map lore the first yamaoka wore that mask and killed many with a katana so I think it might be a samari
---
He’s a murder that wouldn’t make sense because again he’s a psychotic murder
---
What? The entire first tome is Claudette and Trapper.
---
I never see them. It's always him being good and... That's about it. He doesn't struggle at all playing killer. It seems so easy for him, and the fact that he seems so unemotional when there is struggle makes it uninteresting to watch.
---
Thanks to you two. I never really learned how to main him because I only played as Leatherface before. Even though he’s pretty hard to main.
---
Pretty Accurate, for the stranger things one it was about two weeks, same with ghostface
---
A killer that hops from body to body so survivor players find they are a killer briefly. It would be cool except SWF would mean just farming friendly killers.
---
Imma tell you
---
WHY THE FUCK DO YOU DISLIKE THE WORD CUNT! IT MAKES IT MY FAVORITE WORD DUE TO EVERYONES HATE OF IT.
---
No, you just avoid her the best you can and don't cleanse until everyone is infected. Then you all cleanse simultaneously and play like you're against Huntress.
---
Reminder that furtive chase has been left in it's useless state for 3 months
---
*n o t*
---
I don't think gens need to be directly nerf. I think it would help a lot if survivors had an objective to do before they could work on gens.
---
I'm fond of the idea of having the survivors find an item to allow them to begin repairing a generator.
---
Stop running.
---
4% is your chance of escaping the hook, so I’m saying they got lucky enough to escape the second time.
---
Its garbage still
---
that Ghostface looks Photoshopped from a year ago lmao
---
Please dont let bhvr think this perk doesnt need changing by saying it has interesting potential
---
It really does get in the way its bottom right dark
---
OKAY THANK YOU NOW that was useful.
---
Someone said it above, but I think it's a super possible idea: The killer might be an Oni, and Rin's dad is the survivor. Entity gets to harvest the pleasure of Rin chasing and killing her dad, the fear of Rin's dad running from the monster he created, plus we get a cool Japanese mythological killer.
---
There's nothing that says a chapter based on a Stephen King novel won't come in the future.
---
Mind blown.
---
Bs mate, I never started shit. People will see it before they see what I said and will already have there own thoughts about it in there head. 
---
Plus as you can see only you and one guy replied so how am I starting a fight? Exactly I’m not go home you are drunk and blind.
---
&gt; In an ideal world, we'd have challenges that have a survivor and a killer condition, and if either is met the challenges completes.
---
I think it depends on what the goals of these challenges are. There are some advantages of having them separate, as it forces people who mostly play one side to step outside their comfort zone. This makes at least half of the challenges "tougher" without having to resort to gimicky ways to inflate the difficulty (looking at you, leaked Tome 4 challenges). 
---
However, because these challenges are tired into unlockable lore, I also can understand the logic of saying the challenges should be more accessible. To that end, I'd agree that your ideal world would be the better option.
---
The oni
---
I've been trying to build my surv perks (as a killer main).
---
I did Laurie first for DS (naturally), I have now gotten Meg, Meng and Nea all to their notable teachables without getting DS over level 1. Including Laurie btw.
---
Getting pretty fucking tilted over it tbh.
---
You do realize literally everybody has been saying this since the teaser yesterday right?
---
This is all a Pennywise trick cuz Stephen King remember?
---
Kicking gens = regressing them = slowing down the game = more time to chase survivors, its in the game for a reason, especially when i said you could run Pop
---
Medkit is a better selfcare
---
I guess we'll see if it evens out after our obligatory "wacky week" of rank reset.
---
Glad to hear someone's having a better experience than me, at least.
---
“Some of this”? Nope your whole comment helped a lot. Thanks a million.
---
ZOOOM PUNCH
---
They're not wrong
---
I quit the game for a while and came back to sounds being fixed, sorry.
---
No thanks I've seen enough NOED legions today
---
Not really. Depends on the situation. I was playing a match last night, and an Adam farmed a Claudette off 2 hooks right in front of the killer, without Borrowed Time. Claudette DC'd. I don't blame her one bit. She was just going to get downed again, and then death hook. This was in the first 2 minutes of the match too.
---
He proceeded to do the same to me. He farmed me off 2 hooks, then hid in a locker, refusing to heal me (although I healed him earlier.) Demogorgon was coming for me to put me on my death hook, and I said "fuck it." I ran to the locker and pointed right as he downed me. He then grabbed Adam out of the locker, hooked him, waited for him to die, then walked me to the hatch.
---
Even then it scares them away from an easy distance maker like the window or pallet because they know it’s there and have to take other paths, unless they wanna wager a health state to remove a trap.
---
Dont know why you're being downvoted, you can absolutely hit survivors across gaps like this using your lunge
---
If it’s Rin’s dad, BHVR needs to give him a brown addon called prayer beads.
---
Strangely enough, I just completed the self care challenge without healing myself once.
---
I completely the Tier 1 challenges within the first couple days. So I'm looking for some challenges that will take more time to complete since we got 2 weeks before the next set of challenges come anyways.
---
That’s gonna be an awkward family reunion
---
You literally just copied my Feng post.
---
Steve is best boy, but Feng still best girl.
---
I mean... the entity was not wrong.
---
VERY ^smol **angry**  Japanese girl!
---
You change tiers by stalking survivors, hold down the stalk button while looking at a survivor directly and they will have a white outline that turns more red the longer you stalk them, as that's happening there will be a progress bar around your power showing you how close you are to the next tier. At tier 1 you have 0 terror radius but you move slower than the survivors and have a smaller range on your lunge, going to tier 2 puts you at regular speed for most killers and gives you a terror radius that can be affected by add-ons, once in tier 2 you won't go back down to 1 for the rest of the game and your lunge range is normal, in tier 3 you have a bigger terror radius and instantly down people on hit, it only lasts for a certain amount of time unless you use one of two add-ons for his power but those make it take longer to get to 3 to begin with. As for perks it depends on what kind of play style you have when playing him. Enduring and spirit fury work well to just force pallets down while in tier 3 and still be able to get a quick down, whispers also helps him get tier 2 early so you could consider running that with him. He also has a faster vaulting speed than most killers, especially in tier 3 so you could potentially use Windows as a means to trick people. Basically unless you're playing a build that involves staying in tier 1 all game, you need to get to tier 2 as fast as possible when you load in because you will be at a disadvantage early if you don't get that done fast

---
how can i chose the new missions? i have to do everything on level 1? i'm on the end but i didnt do 2 mission, yet i cannot chose anything on the new one.
---
Lol u have clearly never played a high rank game. In red ranks ruin either disappears in the first minute or they just hit greats
---
Probably. 
---
Whenever he cloaks it 'ends' the Chase. So all the time he spent around you cloaked you didn't get Diversion points because, according to the game's internal logic, you weren't in Chase; you were just running around.
---
That may also be why you got an Iridescent Chaser, since you 'won' a Chase whenever he cloaked.
---
Making fun of boomers via a dead meme is almost a paradox

Why are you responding to yourself?

I'm glad he got punished for his BS
---
I wish the graphics in-game would be HALF this clean. That said, Killer: THE ONI?
---
I had the biggest boner for both of these two.
---
Just hoping for BBQ soon. That’s the only way Switch players can get it.
---
...and you can't hit them, you have to catch them with traps.
---
Merciless Killer = double pip, has nothing to do with BP
---
Do you actually make that face when " **When you're Rank 18 and the only one on the team doing gens while everyone else is running around and you get all of the gens but you die and everyone else escapes** "?
---
Because i would be pissed instead of dumbfounded.
---
Can't wait to see his mori where he Lifts a Survivor up and breaks their back!
---
I got the same bug the other day! I was on Thompson House and tried to BL off the harvester but it didn't go off, then the Ghostface hit me and i started running at 150 for the rest of the game. Every time he got near me i was across the map before he knew he missed his swing. it only stopped after my adrenaline popped
---
Good to know I can always rely on the dbd community to bitch about new content
---
True I didn't think about the fact that there was more survivors per game than killers, but at the same time didn't you get to like 905 on the survivor list or something huge like that?
---
Yeah lol. I can see spirit in an almost good place but some of her add ons (Look at painrelievers newest video) can be a bit broken. So she just needs some fine tuning most likely. (This was my take and an argument I’m no expert on game design)
---
I wanna see the one where he crushes their head with his bare hands
---
That's just lag unfortunately man.
---
It’s possible. I had some games where I did 3 gens solo but they’re incredibly rare. It shouldn’t be possible though, as it relies on your team to absolutely suck ass. Won’t really help that multiple people will be going for it at the same time
---
Still though, even with SWFs it would still be a finely functional M1 killer. Could work!
---
Lol u have clearly never played a high rank game without Ruin.
---
That's what the killer told me post chat!
---
Killers are way stronger than survivors right now due to them needing survivors too much. Yeah, let’s nerf the main objective now. What the hell?
---
Yeah, look at my flair and trust me when I say I can't wait for the doc rework, but spirit is in such a gross place right now that it's very plausible her rework got moved up, and would definitely fit in with a chapter involving her family. I'm not saying there's proof of it, but just because this was a chapter teaser doesn't mean it's not coming.
---
I thought it was a ponytail... it actually looks kinda good.
---
I predict r/dbdgonewild is going to get really uncomfortable here soon.
---
"A dark whisper would keep [Rin's father] awake all night, reminding him of his hopeless situation."
---
...
---
"A dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. [Rin] would not rest--not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge."
---
Was gonna correct you on the lore of Amanda (Entity took her because she was such a bitch to the ppl who did her traps and she didn’t feel guilty about it) until I read the rest of this masterpiece. Lmao 10/10 they should implement this
---
That would be interesting but some people would still bitch and moan
---
there has been no solid info. it was said by devs in a stream they would like to address her but that might not be what all the yamaoka hype rn is about.
---
I'd easily pay 5 euro or 500 rubles or 5 usd for a "brutal" mode. I want Manhunt 2 levels of gore.
---
Why play Nea who only looks good with make-up when you can play Feng with equally fabulous options for both?
---
....how would that... work?
---
I think it counts if other survivor's use there's as well as I had a Dwight delete his and it counted progress for mine
---
You keep bashing him but giving no reason. He plays well, isnt toxic, is very educational, very friendly, interacts with his chat etc.
---
Wtf do you expect? Why you gotta be such a hater?
---
I do it at least once a night with ghostface.
---
This works at low ranks with shitty random survivors (I know cause that's where I am) but with good teammates you shouldn't ever really be doing 3 gens, let alone the next level challenge which is 4 gens
---
Will we get samurai jack as a survivor ? Lol
---
&gt; Aim for the neck area.
---
Does it work like that for all killers?
---
So theory. It’s not Rin’s dad, but an ancestor. The potential ran in Rin’s family, so it’s possible one of her family further back was better suited. The original owner of the mask for instance.
---
I’m gonna guess he will be called The Oni or something like that
---
I just came into the game and this guy caught my attention ...   
---
Might just play him a lot more :p
---
Imagine a world where I’m merely expressing an opinion on a message board full of opinions that is made to come express your opinion. Wild.
---
Also lmao pleeeeease, fuck outta here with that controlling emotions shit. Literally never.
---
And as far as overestimating hopes I did say that this was an unpopular opinion.
---
Because nobody wants to be stuck at tan ranks for more than a day. The lower your killer rank the longer your queues.
---
Honestly just hope you get queued with the people I normally do. Easy challenge. \o/
---
&gt; Probably couldn't really work in practice, but it seems like a really cool idea to me.
---
No probably about it. A 4-man SWF (hell, even a 3-man) makes any killer that has this as part of their kit a complete dud.
---
I challenge you to give real reasons why otz stream is bad rather than just spewing out hatred

This is infuriating. The survey seems to have skipped like 50% of the questions for me.

I wasn't asked about:

\-How scary the game is.
---
\-My opinion on the post-game chat.
---
\-What my top 3 most-played characters were.
---
\-Whether I'd recommend the game to a friend overall.
---
\-What I think about game performance. 
---
\-Details about the Stranger Things chapter, despite answering that I have it
---
These are all things I've seen screenshots of or discussion about that I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE ANSWERED. If other people are experiencing this, it makes me worry about the sample size of the bugged-slash-"this-person-isn't-worth-asking" questions...
---
Ruin lasts 1 min if you’re lucky, pop needs a hook, corrupt lasts 2 minutes then its useless, and thrilling tremors needs a down and has a 60 second cooldown at tier 3 so if you only have it one or two its 100 and 80 respectively. And even with those people can still do a gen before you can walk in a straight line to the closest gen but yea you should just kick more gens.
---
Love it when killers realize that you got bullshitted someway in a match and give you the dub.
---
Joke’s on you, the killer is more like Meowth: useless.
---
I’m just trolling my guy :)
---
I'd be fine with gore if there were an option for it like in For Honor. I'm not a huge gore fan. I'd still play if there was gore, but I personally prefer it how it is.

The invis is ridiculous imo. I play wraith and Imagine how many gen grabs you could get with this and the clapper
---
“But how will we gen rush?”
---
Team Spirit - Play in a match in which all four survivors play as Rin and the killer is the Spirit.
---
Weebtwins activate.
---
Some are easy yes. Some are pretty hard or time consuming.
---
But drop 15 pallets during chases is an example of a very easy one that can be completed without changing your gameplay at all
---
Well, he'd be strong against master loops as he'd could just tear the entire structures down lol
---
I still hate u legion :(
---
Maybe we'll get the First Yamaoka as the killer and Rin's father as the survivor.
---
To clarify, apparently Peanits said you don't have to do the entire gen alone, you just have to participate in the completed repair of 3 gens.
---
Hes great eye-candy and his streams arent boring
---
The gen jockey.  Just ignore your allies.  Other survivors will go for the unhooks I'm sure.
---
I like your flair
---
Is anyone else unable to select challenges?
---
Eh probably not for awhile
---
Lol!  Dude it's your fellow teamates getting stuck with you as a teamate telling you that Self Care is hot game losing garbage past potato ranks.  You waste wayyyyyyy too much time slowly having yourself everytime you get a boo boo.  Learn to be useful while injured and get geals from teamates or a medkit.  It isn't reverse psychology from killers.  Self Care is hot garbage sincerely all your teamates.
---
I want the one where he just sits on them like the Shugodki he is.
---
At high ranks the game is extremely survivor favored. The math is pretty clear on this. 3 survivors working gens can get more of their total objective done in the time it takes the killer to hunt down whoever he's chasing than the killer can by getting a first hook. Even if the survivor isn't great, and can only loop the killer for 20 seconds, that's enough. If they're actually skilled and can loop them for 40 seconds or more, it skews further in the survivors' favor. 
---
As the number of gens completed increases, I think the killer's relative power goes up, especially with stuff like surveillance or discordance, but unless they maintained a 3 gen strat, they're still likely to lose.
---
Ok Bloody Spirit
---
A-ding-ding-ding!
---
Well the basement hook challenge isn't going to complete itself.
---
thanks
---
His 3 teachables?
---
Read what I posted. Survivors will basically throw a match to complete their objectives. Because so many of them are based around healing and saving people you’re left with no-one actual caring about generators and escaping as they all want the saves. 
---
The games become an absolute mess. If I’m not finishing gens or on the hook no-one else is. I saw 2 Claudettes chasing the killer chasing another Claudette so they could heal or save her first. It’s ridiculous
---
So the next chapter is just a previous chapter from another perspective.  Neat.   Should have released it in June for Fathers Day
---
this such a funny idea  i love it
---
Oof
---
I believe you might be right. I asked my Japanese friend and he said the voice in the new teaser can be translated as "HONK, HONK HONK".
---
Oh god that is going to be bad.  I've gotten multiple "grabs" that failed to trigger.  So I'm stuck in this awkward animation while the survivor gets a head start on running away.
---
If you dont think it's a mental disorder you're definitely in denial
---
You think thats bad, wait until you see me on a level 1 Claudette trying to get this : P
---
Sorry but I don’t think blocking a third of the screen is an intended feature. 
---
I hope not anyway
---
Fuck yea 🤤🤤🤤
---
You don't seem to get the difference between having a "gender" and a personality, people are who they are, Tony is not the average boy, and Vera is not the average girl, who plays with the same toys share the same story, and in fact, the "gender" which they hide from is just, THEM, their personalities who they are, their individuality but those theories want to do all the same that facist wanted, put people in a category. a square. something they can blend in by fear of individuality. Kinda the same story  that you both shared isn't it ?
---
I agree gens are way too fast, but at the same time holding M1 for 80 seconds is already kinda boring to begin with, so increasing that timer is going to really hurt the fun of survivors. 
---
A lot of the slow down perks are pretty mediocre TBH. The 2 good ones are ruin and pop.
---
I used one med kit in a match and it counted as 2 and I used a partial and it counted as 1.
---
My graphics setting are too low for me to be able to appreciate the beauty
---
I think this is hinting at Michael myers from Halloween it would be so cool to have him in the game
---
So sad.
---
He rocks everything
---
Either way you have to play really sweaty...  
---
I usually let the last person go, but for the Tome I'll do what must be done :/
---
Oof indeed.
---
True dat
---
Will this chapter be just a killer? I would assume we wouldn’t get a new map since killer is blood related. Or maybe we’ll get the early non-damaged version of Yamoaka estate (with upstairs, hopefully!).
---
The amount of people in those countries that play is probably peanuts anyways, so.
---
Bye-bye
---
Toolboox with the Best add ons , no mither the other perk I dont remember the name, better togheter or prove thyself
---
During several circumstances in that game, Bill was doing these things right in front of the other survivors. In my eyes, I thought they were either queued with him or were just seeking a free win. 
---
Obviously I was proven wrong, and ended up apologizing to them for the misunderstanding shortly after.
---
If you are absolutely stomping them, you need to "play with your food"
---
Bold survivors can and will tap a generator you've kicked mid-chase just to stop the regression. Takes less than a second, compared to the multi-second cast time a kick takes. Pop is a good tool for dealing with that but you need to score hooks, and if they complete the generator before you get back, your pop kick is wasted. I had a game last night where I would consistently be just two or three seconds walking distance from the generator after hooking, ready to pop it back, and they'd finish it off. Pop didn't do jack shit for me there.
---
Entity doesn’t necessarily crush everyone it takes. There’s more than a few killers who enjoy it in the Realm and went very willingly.
---
Pennywise!
---
May the Entity have mercy on you after a pallet blind.  
---
I swear I get tunneled/camped every time I land one.
---
It's ridiculously easy with Ghostface.
---
Ah I see where you are coming from. Like BHVR should not get credit for making this decision since this was possibly mandated??
---
I still feel like this does not warrant covert (or overt in other instances) language that disparages and disconfirms those who identify outside of the binary
---
Yeah fr. I would be equally weirded out if BHVR went out of their way to make a prominent a straight relationship.
---
The hybristophilia all over this fandom is weird enough already (I wish there was enough brain bleach in the world for me to forget all the Leatherface reader insert pregnancy fics I've stumbled on), we don't need sexuality mainlined in a near-narrativeless slasher game.
---
Extra   T H I C C
---
I have no problem playing against Freddy's, he just didnt need to tunnel to win
---
Removing vacuum pallets, and giving killers auto aim making 360s harder to pull off, and the insta heals was a completely un-necessary nerf.
---
heh
---
yeah and then pull them out like you're yanking a lawnmower start cord.
---
Make sure to make plenty use of your power and kick gens and pallets frequently. Michael is one of the harder killers to pip with unfortunately though.
---
Never said that, but you don't know much about it if you said it was wrong to give into their needs.
---
Rookie numbers..
---
Pallets were more or less rng when jeff came out, they reduced the spawns so much it was ridiculous. Theyve buffed them recently even if they havnt announced it the maps have pallets more frequently again
---
Wouldnt it get tiresome after a couple times though kind of like Fknal Fantasy summons? Whenever I get mori'd anymore I just grab my phone.
---
Beat me to it
---
*Stares in Tier 1 / Scratched Mirror Myers*
---
It is kinda poor wording. When one challenge says sacrifice a survivor and another challenge says kill 4 survivors, people will draw an obvious difference between sacrifice and kill.
---
If survivor Rin was a thing, she'd be my new go-to survivor instantly.
---
Yo is that spirit's father? That's awesome! Although I am sad it's not pennywise.
---
Can’t believe they added Tracer to DBD
---
Sexy samurai cosplay
---
Ignore my allies? How many matches have we played together again??? I must have forgot you somewhere along the way. For your information, I always go for unhooks. It's not my fault that I don't find this challenge "challenging." Way to jump to conclusions, though. ;)
---
Please nerf
---
The ol Friday the 13th twist
---
Considering everyone is running ruin, and gen rush is still a thing, that's not enough, especially since they don't have to rush the same gen, they can work multiple at once, communicating the killers position. Seems pretty unfair to me tbh
---
Except kicking gens regressed them at .25 ticks a second while repairing gens repairs at 1 tick a second. Not only that, but the killer has to leave chase to kick gens and survivors can stop gen regression mid chase with almost no penalty. Gen kicking is really inefficient at slowing the game down.
---
I've got a few rattling around in my head.
---
I had some swf try telling me that I shouldn’t use that perk as it isn’t very good and use something that is more viable.. I mean 3/4 escaped but they each lost a key, rainbow map, green toolbox and flashlight.. so they won but weren’t happy with it
---
So improving the games health was wrong? I see. Well, you changed my mind. Nice.
---
Why would you need to split anything, a gore dlc is only client sided cosmetic changes
---
Yeah im pretty happy rank reset happend
---
Half the challanges are just broken for some reason.
---
Ghostman cometh
---
Gens OP.. remove them from the game. Survivors should just need to find exit gate or hatch from the start.
---
We're all entitled to bad opinions
---
It's not like that on Fortnite anymore.
---
Crossplay is forced and console players are getting sick of it.
---
*Re-Followed
---
It was done on purpose.
---
Kudos, but I’m not one to sit and watch influential people like TrUe try to spread false information that could change people’s opinion on a killer that clearly needs some sort of rework.
---
 WAGA SHUCHUU NI ARI
---
Meh. He is far too weak. I would tweak some things to make him a bit more viable but other than that hes pretty well balanced.
---
Jk, I would love to see a non-humanoid killer tho.
---
I agree with that. I don't get tunnelling killers.
---
I mean I didn’t see it, so sorry if It’s similar
---
Devs : Just use the left side 4head
---
That sucks man but keep trying you will get it I Believe
---
Killers are not holding anything by hostage by slugging lol
---
Say it with me now
---
WAZAAAAAAAAAAAAP!!!!
---
Not me
---
Well from my experience just now, over the next few days killers are gonna camp the basement so just stay on gens.
---
Oh nah, mah Doctah is at tah bottam
---
Yikes. I stopped playing fortnite for DBD.
---
Is that what's up there?
---
So I've noticed 🤣
---
I love him, though, so I'll keep playing him. I might try hag, though, maybe that will be easier to pip. 
---
the emphasis on the mask makes me think it's not Rin's father or mother, it might be one of the Yamaoka ancestors that created the bloody legacy
---
Only 501, but still about 5x more survivors than killers
---
I love Ghostface, but the way people play him (like massive dicks) makes it so unfun. :/ I don’t mind dying, but being tunneled/camped then mori’d off first hook isn’t fun.
---
As long as you're not awful at the game, rank is more telling of time played rather than skill. A few 2-3 hour sessions a week isn't enough to get high rank unless you're double pipping every game. I was perpetually stuck in green ranks until this past month and I don't think I improved that much
---
Crossplay would be a good thing and it would probably be entirely optional, they made it optional for fucking windows and steam so lol they're definitely gonna make it optional on console.
---
I knew it was a lot higher but damn did I make it a lot more in my head, sorry about that
---
I understand if a survivor is being a toxic piece of garbage.
---
Can’t make much good of it when 3/4 of my team aren’t playing properly
---
I like the idea of it being an ONI, more of an ancestral demon than necessarily Rins father
---
...while having only the Padded Jaws add-on equipped.
---
Survivors are pussies
---
I don’t think he was talking about you bud. he was just pointing out a way to get a done. you okay? did someone hurt you?
---
You’re so edgy.
---
Wtf is that supposed to mean?
---
Honestly I'm kinda with you, looks like things are going to get worse too if the leaked final set of challenges aren't changed.
---
Its wrong to accept their train of thought instead of actually helping them. They need mental help and not us just agreeing with them
---
If you pause the game you can see what account name is which character too so that helps to stack PWYF
---
I like your logic!
---
If you're simply looking to pip, Legion is probably the easiest.
---
I know what you mean though, I love Myers. At the end of the day pips don't mean too much. The DBD rank system is pretty janky.
---
yeah lmao females stopped existing in 1995, when they were replaced by androids by the japanese government
---
I have prestiged my legion twice and still havnet gotten BBQ
---
Forgot to mention you have 0 collision while stalking and if a survivor is inside you while you do it you can't actually gain charge off of them
---
I main and adore The Pig and I'd actually love if if they did this for an April's Fools or whatever. Am I the only one who thinks Piggy is adorable?
---
It's genji

This post is very well thought out, I was expecting a non comprehensive ramble, thank you op

Thats all you have?
---
Bigger Plot Twist: Rin's Mother
---
I understand that fact.  May as well strive for it.  Those problems we can point out can get changed
---
Eh, not really. For some reason I constantly play with 2-3 bots who run Self-Care and Urban at rank 1. Only thing this changes about my experience is that I had to run it for one game.
---
I believe there is 2 reasons for this:
---
\-He costs money
---
\-His perks are shit, after MoM got nerfed no one wants him other than fans of the ED franchise.
---
You’re all good
---
I hope, I was watching a few videos on this and finally read the description of Yamaoka's Estaye and it talks about the mask in the house being haunted by the original Yamaoka and his blood thirst. So maybe we are getting the Original Yamaoka.
---
I kinda agree with this actually. Prayer beads should be removed or nerfed to remove all sound cues from survivors for Spirit. That and collision removal would be enough for me imo.
---
Have it be an extremely rare easter egg.
---
Dude.....
---
But as you said earlier survivors dony necessarily need a counter, just the ability to outplay someone, it's a strategy that works consistently
---
Somebody stop me!

---
Something about finger guns Ace just invokes humor
---
whoops

At some point but the devs said they don’t know when so don’t expect it anytime soon

Hey i think your friend is wrong, because i asked to my *intelectual japanese friend* and he said that the voice can be translated as "***RAKE IN THE LAKE***"

I do this literally every game.

That is one freaky mask.

Perhaps they will go the opposite direction and have the map be the battlefield that he fought on...
---
How has life been since the divorce with the Huntress man?
---
I heard Rin might have a bit something something for black men.
---
Ah yes the "free currency" that takes 60-70 games just to earn enough for a single killer.
---
Denialists like you guys suck.
---
Same. So much so that sometimes I make builds that revolve (almost) completley around self-care.
---
Gotcha, chief. It seemed as if he was personally responding back to what I said. You can never really tell on Reddit though. 
---
And no, no one "hurt" me. I simply answered a question. You okay? Did my response somehow "hurt" you? LOL! :)
---
I hope if he is the killer in game he just screams a lot of angry Japanese when shit happens
---
I usually infect two people and start M1'ing the rest of them. This way if they cleanse I can hook someone close to the corrupt and down the rest of them with it and infectious will help me find if anyone is closer. I know this only works in low ranks but I usually stop playing killer after I reach green ranks.
---
I feel like that’s a lot more obvious than people think. I don’t feel like it would be Her Father for any reason nor do I feel like that’s super interesting or being hinted at in any way. But I think you’re right and I’m absolutely stoked about it.
---

The entity CHOSE to not take her father. While the entity was influencing him, the entity saw potential in Rin's rage, so the entity made a deal: serve and you will get your revenge. Killers don't necessarily have to be "evil" for the entity to see them as killer potential, they have traits the entity believes will make them a good servent. Often times, they are bad people (probably because they'll be less reluctant to kill survivors over and over), but they don't have to be bad people.
---
The spirit and the plague are two killers who have obvious motives to serve the entity while not being really bad people. As said before, the entity took the spirit for rage. The entity took the plague because she was religious: she's is a devout servent to a god already, the entity can seem like the god she already previously worshipped, which makes her much less likely to question if she's doing the right thing, because she already feels like it's God's will and she loves God. She didn't even kill anyone, she honestly thought she was doing God's work and she believed she was helping people, yet she was still taken.
---
That and sum dust
---
Yeah but ain't nobody wanna play trapper
---
As long as the devs dont destroy her and still allow her to down survivors in a UNIQUE WAY (I want killers in chase's to feel different) I'm ok with it, I'm attracted somewhat to spirit not because shes strong but because her chases are more unique than most killers.
---
Unless it’s 3 entire gens by yourself I don’t see the issue. It’s entirely possible. Maybe not every match but it is certainly doable. It seems like most of the hate seems to be coming from survivor mains who loop the killer all match until the gens magically pop themselves
---
Killers with extendo arms, a tale as old as time
---
Except for spine chill, iron will, (not sure) premonition, object of obsession, and that item thing.
---
There could be more counterplay, but I don't think it's fair to say there isn't any.
---
They need to rethink their entire challenge strategy as almost every single survivor one sucks. Drop 15 pallets in a chase. Deplete 6 medkits. 3 Gens with Dark Sense in a single match. They’re already getting to be way too much of s grind and way too boring.
---
In a different game this would be acceptable but some of this shit they’re asking us to do have achievements with less bloody values to them. Also half the T4 challenges look outright impossible unless you farm with the killer to do them.
---
I was so excited for this but it takes far too long to Tier up. The rewards are honestly shit. Challenges don’t give near enough Rift fragments (Master challenges should give 10, Normal should give 5) and I haven’t even received any of my damn Auric Cells from tier seither (Xbox) I’m just about done with the game.
---
It sucks there isn’t another asymmetrical game that’s actually survived as DbD honestly just feels trash now. It’s the worst it’s ever been and I regret every penny I spent on recent chapters, skins and the Premium Pass.
---
I BEG YOU CLEANSE THE TOTEM AND FREE US

Actually the robes is also a fun world product they didn’t use it cause it ain’t that big of a deal the mask is the selling point plus they were able to make their own Ghostface so giving him his own outfit made sense plus funworld knows people wanted his outfit too so they can sell it for more
---
Win a match: *Must be done while the game is not running*
---
Steve and Nancy cost money but they're pretty popular. And perks don't really matter for Survivors since they don't have any unique playstyles
---
Technically speaking you both see grass movement for each other
---
facts get downvoted now? ouch
---
More gore doesn't mean more scary or mature, just more gross. No thanks.
---
Just saw it on the survey and didn't know. That wasn't an opinion. Also read the thread before you repeat something that's been said already.
---
Incels will hate being chased by demon Chad
---
I couldn't disagree more. The fact that moris and things like the RBT opening being having less gore than an episode of rugrats is what's tiresome to me. Every time a new killer comes out and everyone wants to see the mori I roll my eyes. You all already know whatever it is it's going to look like shit, so who cares. Lemme grab my phone.
---
Merely just mentioning 'upvotes' immediately makes this unfunny.
---
Sorry to sound harsh, but this kind of 'content' needs to die
---
Well he was tortured by the Entity. This is confirmed by the Devs. He never wanted to kill and refused to for a long time, that’s why he has hooks sticking out of his body and all of those scars.
---
The whole point of these tomes is that they give us Trapper and Claudette Lore...
---
Of course it's Trapper.

We go into killer games very differently I always get worried I'm gonna get wrecked.

That thing has a long chain...

How do you propose they make money?
---

---
Thoe personally it’s better to buy from steam you get another body for Ghostface turns his robe white
---
Ok but imagine how terrifying it would be to point/pet the horse and all of a sudden he gets on two fucking legs and starts chasing you around the map. 😨
---
that works great, except that grass doesn’t cover 100% of the maps and some maps have no grass
---
I mean you can't argue that survivors didn't receive a ton of nerfs for awhile there.. They reduced pallets, nerfed some of the more broken loops, changed exhaustion so it doesnt recover while running, nerfed BNPs, nerfed flashlights, nerfed healing speeds across the board, got rid of pallet vacuum, changed fast vaulting, and some other things I'm sure I'm leaving out. 
---
You can say those all improved the health of the game because survivors were too strong and I'd even agree with you on that, but you can't pretend these weren't all nerfs lol.
---
did you read this?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dvvhbz/new_killer_first_yamaoka/
---
i think it's going to be the first yamaoka, with rin's dad being the survivor.
---
I know this is only tangentially related, but skill checks for certain Killer Perks/Powers would actually be pretty cool.
---
Yep, indoor maps are disgusting with her
---
Git gud, blendette
---
Add 3,498 to that number
---
Yeah, but Steve and Nancy come from a more recent and currently more popular series, plus there is a special version of the game that includes DBD + the stranger things DLC, it also helps that 3 characters (Demo, Nancy and Steve) come in a single pack and all of them have nice perks.
---
there’s only 2 genders. Male and female. Nobody gives a shit what your liberal arts teacher says.
---
Then... they haven't read the post in the first place, and wouldn't give a shit to begin with.
---
And you have one joke
---
Wait what? I was questioning the idea of the spirit being a him, but no all killers have 3 teachables
---
True... true
---
Fuck Blendettes too, along with all Spirit mains
---
&lt;squints&gt; I was trying to continue the joke.
---
Sweet salty tears my friend lmao. What's next? The game starts with the gates opened?
---
I get it's a game aspect but I hate being slugged or camped because it prevents me from actually playing the game.
---
Eh, Demo and Steve are really shitty perks expect for Mind breaker and Second Wind, which are really only okay tbh
---
And just like that Michael had a chance to use the mori and infinite tier 3 addons successfully
---
I literally said that they made the game better because survivors were way too strong, my only point is that they're still nerfs. Just because they were healthy game changes doesn't mean they weren't nerfs.
---
“Our game” isn’t ours. It’s BHVRs and they want to allow as many people to play it as possible, even if it means not adding a little thing like gore so that “their” government will continue to allow the game to be played in their country. How would you feel if they added a killer that was extremely fun to play, but caused the game to be banned in whatever country your in?
---
Oh, I will commit sopeku to ovoid an r/woooosh
---
I/incuuboy : don’t look at the watermark.
---
Me: 👀
---
"Git gud" perform a moderately, kinda easy, but also hard, but simple skill check and all survivors die.
---
Yeah should do. Its not like he is a spirit and she descended from him. He just went apeshit.
---
I bet they kind of thought, 'wait a second why do we have lore about a brutal murderer that leads to the innocent young girl'?
---
This guy was theorizing about it being rins father and in my head i was like "that sounds fucking stupid"...
---
Idk, I don't mind being slugged, it makes sense for the killer to slug in some situations and it can backfire for them when they overdo it.
---
You're definitely not alone
---
I was so hyped for my Ghosty boy's Classic skin, but after this trailer dropped I... still am lol. Nothing can take the spot for Ghostface-related hype on me since he's my fav slasher.
---
And tbh I'm not gonna lie, I'm not really excited about another Yamaoka related killer. Kinda wanted some other Japanese creature as the next Japanese killer like a Futakucchi Onna, instead of a Yamaoka family member. I'll still wait for more news tho since him being an Oni is the only interesting thing about him for me rn.
---
and then theres "blind the killer 2 times, needs to be done in one trial"
---
Good luck me, i can´t even blind killers destroying pallets
---
Found the tru3tard.
---
So that's where the sword went...
---
You're complaining about having to pay for optional content. DBD has to license existing horror genre killers. That costs money.
---
WHAT'S WITH TRU3 AND CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUSING STRATEGIES THAT PEOPLE ARE ALREADY DOING? NO YOU DIDNT INVENT NOT STALKING IN GHOSTFACE! KEEP CRANKING THOSE HOGS MY FELLOW GAMERS!
---
They be flat tho
---
GhostFace is the first that comes to my mind
---
Yeah, I agree. Although I would want Rin as a separate survivor, not an outfit or anything. It gives the chance to get a flip around the Spirit’s perks (rancor, haunted grounds, spirit fury) and of they introduce the father as an Oni or similar for killer seeing him as survivor would be interesting too
---
&gt;I get it's a game aspect but I hate being slugged or camped because it prevents me from actually playing the game.
---
Devs already buffed recovery bar to 95%, your teammates can easily just tap you up.
---
the fact that they saw you nodding and didnt stop to think it COULD be Haunted grounds is astonishing
---
I feel like it’s Great great great great great Grandpa Yamaoka. His ancestral sword was used to kill two people in his own bloodline, and shattered, and He’s not happy about it.
---
Literally hits the frame of the window
---
I like Otzdarva, PainReliever, Farmer John, and ZubatLel.
---
I would love this so much. Who’s to say the Entity is bound to any set of rules? Who said the Entity doesn’t possess the ability to go to an alternate timeline and make Rin a survivor? The Entity kidnapped Steve and Nancy despite their continuing existence in Stranger Things. Besides maybe this would open up possibilities for future killers having connections to other killers. In a lot of the lore there are other potential killers that relate to existing killers. We could have that patient from the Nurse’s lore, maybe a family member of the Trapper. Who knows? Nobody said it isn’t possible. Although I, sadly, don’t believe Rin is going to be the survivor. Even if her dad becomes the new killer, we’ll probably get some random white chick/dude who has nothing to do with the Yamoakas
---
Someone who never played the game themselves.
---
surprised I don't see flashlight instead of syringe on killer side
---
One that helps her with getting stabbed

Id blame my government for being so fucking dumb. Cowtowing to horse shit demands of countries is how china has become what it is now. Fuck that shit.

I'm *assuming* this is just badly written and counts for generators you've worked on even if other people finish them.  If they expect you to complete 3+ generators from start to finish on your own, they're insane.

yeah it's easy to do. and as a killer main, I love it because they waste time blinding me while I'm stuck standing still during the break animation anyway. and since they could have used that time to run away instead, they're now close to me when I can still walk their direction by hearing them.
---
one of my favorite kills I earned was when an injured Blendette blinded me at the shack pallet. I walked forward and swung at the spot where I knew she was standing, and she screamed and went down. 
---
I heard the Disconnect sound before the blindness even wore off.
---
I wouldn't say confirmed but I certainly hope so. My big this is cross-progression. The only reason I havent bought DbD for the switch is because I've already sunk 1k worth of hours into pc progress and 500 hours into xbox. I just dont think I have it in me to start fresh for hand held dead by daylight.
---
You run bind, and every chance you get you bait out others, and then finish gens for them.
---
I haven't played against it as survivor, but the thing is pretty dark. But from what I've played with it, it's much darker than the default one. Like  it's just straight fabric black, no fancy stitching or anything that makes it brighter.
---
Or someone has had too many bad games with Blendette and has no sympathy for the character because the playerbase made me hate her.
---
Here's the thing with slugging. It is the best and most effective way by far to slow down the game. 
---
If you slug just one survivor, that's...
---
* One on the ground
---
* One being chased
---
* One going to save the slug
---
* And if they're an organized group one on gens. If they're not organized then potentially no one on gens.
---
Personally I see more of the opposite, sjws complaining on Twitter or people on cancel culture attacking things they want to create a non-troversy out of.  There is some of both to be fair
---
Aha, a man of lore as well.. sadly you even explain in the sentence that the entity does have mind manipulation. This is true, and it ain't stupid, so to the entity, erasing whatever deal was made and just making her remember how her father killed her and her mother would surely enrage her allowing the entity to have a killer that is thirsty for vengeance, that raw hatred will manifest into a multitude of emotions feeding the Entity for a while, forgetting about whatever emotions the spirit invokes in the other killers and Survivors
---
I wonder is it some sort of time reversal power? Based on how the blood and smoke flow backwards.  
---
Also I think the mask is more representative of the Entity/ The Yamoka bloodline than the killer as it was heavily featured in the Spirit's teaser also, so I don't think the killer will be anykind of Oni.
---
Sure. But I want an example of a direct nerf that made playing a survivor absolutely weak. Most survivors will sut here and bitch about the devs catering to killers yet have no real conscious of how game balance works. I can only assume it's refreshing to hear a survivor speak their mind and have a solid argument.
---
Infectious fright would also help you get more out of your tier 3
---
You angered your God, you shall get downvoted now!
---
It could be an Oni possessing the dad?
---
His 3 perks are trash, its probably better to not level him at all.
---
Please show me one legitimate angry unreasonable complaint from someone about a poll not including a non binary option
---
There’s the toxicity I see everyday
---
You were sick (plague), ran though a window that would have added to it, and then tried to cheat the hit box and failed.
---
Very true and you have a point but we’ll have to wait and see, but after scrolling through this subreddit for the past 20 minutes there is a pretty bud possibility that it’ll be Rins father
---
I’m surround by snakes😳
---
New killer: Dio Brando
---
New survivor: Speedwagon
---
 The big thing thats being presented is Yamaoka. Something big is most likely going to happen there or its just a rework on spirit like everyone says. Or a new character which im 2% sure is correct.
---

---
It’s all about the positive mental attitude my guy, believe and achieve
---
I mean I never took a liberal arts... didn’t go to college. Decided to educate myself on my own through medical journals my mom had on hand, library research, etc.
---
The problem is you’re mistaking sex for gender and even genetics show a bit more mixing than you want to let on, which is why intersex folk exist. There’s a distinct lack of proper testing on people for genetics as well, with some evidence showing that people can have different genetic make up even within the same body. 
---
Meaning you could have the best parts that don’t fully make up an XY or XX chromosome the same way as the rest of your body. 
---
Assuming it’s strictly a mental disorder is denying that the physical aspect exists.
---
Gender itself is (a social construct), which no one ever explains what that means so I understand why people would be annoyed and shrug it off. Gender in society strictly refers to how society expects each sex to behave in their society. This can also be fluid both due to environmental factors and genetic ones as stated above.
---
This would be like saying that a woman is a woman. But then talking to a Kurd, where a woman in their society will kick your ass. Or a Russian. Which would likely result in the same face. Or in various indigenous tribes, where again, a few have women doing the fighting vs the men.
---
It’s not liberal arts. It’s basic concepts of genetic and sociological aspects of life. If you had any inch of basic conservative-state based public education (IE: i come from Indiana), you could figure this out on your own.
---
That isn’t to say there aren’t people out there who are super annoying in either direction, no one likes being called out for “misgendering” and people who do it without giving you a chance are still assholes, but frankly it’s a lot more fluid scientifically. Per science. Not liberal arts. 
---
Anyways, good luck with not-global-warming and flat earth or whatever you believe in.
---
How bout the one kinjite execution where he grabs them and snaps their neck
---
Ngl id buy both
---
There's a difference between salt and annoyance. Slugging is just annoying. It doesn't matter who you are. It's not about being mad or 'defeated', it's about another person in the game intentionally making sure you can't play.
---
Oh ok. That sucks.
---
Or Maybe one of the pillar men
---
Yeah! Paint.net!
---
Thanks for the compliment!
---
Calling me a survivor main? Lmao you sound like a salty killer main.
---
Being shit with legion imagine that lmfao omegalul he literally gets a free hit, meaning he only has to do half the job of a normal killer. Git gud.
---
Also less ad hominem...yet you throw around labels like “entitled survivor main” look in a mirror buddy
---
Tinkerer... it's time to shine!
---
It's Kindred time.
---
Right, because forcing a killer to actually do their objective is equal to survivors auto-winning the game.
---
One of the pillar men with alternative outfits,  legion style
---
That’s what I was thinking!
---
Why does this have upvotes? You know what? If you can't respect the devs, get out!
---
Because the whole campaign has started the past few months. Around summer anyway.
---
Nobody said shit from October ‘18 - Summer ‘19, in fact she was often regarded as the most loved killer by many.
---
People really convinced themselves it was going to be a chapter based around It/The Shining and are now disappointed that it's not the case lol.
---
No, slugging is used to apply pressure as even picking up and hooking a survivor takes so much time it can allow gens to be done. I get being slugged for 4 minutes is shit but slugging when someone is near or grouped up is the smart play and shouldnt be punished. You still have to be downed as a survivor.
---
It IS a recent thing and many people will attest to that. As is the disconnect plague against her, and the “spirit takes no skill durr” line of thinking
---
'possibility' I mean.. the teaser did bring back up Yamoaka by Name, map and by removing a family heirloom I the Entitys rendition of The Estate. I mean yeah it could be someone else but looking at the clues it's safe to put money on it and even double down on it being Rins Father.. good debate btw friend :D
---
"tried to cheat the hit box" if anything, the hit box cheated on me
---
Kill 5 survivors.
---
Must be done in a single trial.
---
But it reality it's not that hard. If you practice blinding them at pallets and bring a really good flashlight, you should complete that after just a few tries
---
Personally I think non-binary is ridiculous, but I don’t see the harm in including it.  If it makes some people happy to include it then so what?
---
Not always, ends up with the last person being chased, gets someone up, one of them goes down again
---
Hahahah
---
Spoilers: Rin's father is the killer, Pennywise is the survivor
---
**KEKKA DAKE DA**
---
For me it was
---
&gt; At least on hook you can kill yourself. 
---
Then i skimmed through. At one point he acknowledges how stressful killer is 
---
&gt; And yes, I do main survivor, but that is just because killer is too stressful once you get to red ranks
---
but argues against something that makes it a little bit less stressful...
---
doesn't omae imply an air of disrespect?
---
3-20 minutes long queues are the norm
---
I had a billy against me that literally tunneled  every unhooked survivor. He hooked one person in the basement, and was about to hook me in there aswell. I think the DC this time was justified (rest of team was already dead)
---
Im playing against them. They’re getting wrecked at red ranks, like most killers.
---
In green ranks spirits are total shit.”, like all 110% killers.
---
Well now you're moving the goal post. Originally you were just asking for direct survivor nerfs, i gave you some, and now you want nerfs that made them "absolutely weak". I wouldn't argue that survivors are absolutely weak because of nerf X so i can't help you there.
---
But we already have Nea
---
Oh crap are we getting the spirits dad
---
dude Im playing rn I fucking hate it but something makes me keep going
---
Just know that feeling is about to be way worse because I remember seeing on the final level repair 5 gens completely with the perk Dark Sense
---
I read it all and it was super useful. Thanks two million times. :)) I’ll consider these when I’ll play.
---
You
---
&gt;interupt and grab survivor
---
Prayer beeds time
---
Doesn’t change the fact that it’s broken rn
---
It's an official Fun World mask so it could happen. However I think these masks were actually made AFTER Scary Movie as some official merchandise, unlike the original mask that was made WAY before Scream, so Fun World's license may not be enough for them to bring the Ghostface Spoof mask(s) to the game.
---

---
Possibly this, in early October:
---
&gt; Integrated an updated version of the Unreal Engine (4.22, from 4.21.1).
---
You're just talking waffle lol
---
Ok but that would imply mori fail animation and yes please, imagine winning against legion in the knife fight
---
yeah but i don’t think he wants to grind just for sc
---
Lol yes exactly, people used to love her.
---
Jund is a bit of a tool though and often exaggerates or says things to big himself up. “Oh killer is so easy these days, anyone can 4k” then you watch him on stream get trounced and he goes on to state how blah blah blah you literally cant do anything.
---
Also don't mention the 360, that was like my 2nd match today :)
---
Except when someone gets downed on their way to get you. And a teammate is already on the hook. Now 3 people are out of the game, and it is up to one to get them all, and there's nothing two of the three teammates can do except sit on the ground and wait for the game to be over. Those scenarios are just painful, and usually cause people to DC because it's faster than waiting. It does nothing for the gameplay. Spending half of the game unable to even play, after having just sat in the queues and lobbies, is incredibly annoying, and makes you not want to even try to queue again.
---
The clipping brushes just messed up on the switch to unreal 4 I think. It's not gone forever.
---
I’d love to see Sidney in the game
---
we stan a man who beats up pedos
---
For a moment I thought Ghostface pulled out the strap to pop one into Meg's head
---
who is The Alchemist and what is he from?
---
it's mostly just a safety perk in case the killer is hard core into tunneling. Usually unless you did something to piss them off most killer mains such as myself are more interested in getting hooks on others, usually for stacks on BBQ
---
The clipping brushes just messed up on the switch to unreal 4 I think. It's not gone forever, they're gonna fix it.
---
Standard killer wait time particularly during reset is 10+ minutes
---
Ever heard of a place called r/wooooosh?
---
u r the reason i run sloppy
---
Everyone is talking about Rin being the survivor, but what about her mother?
---
I understand that, I even mentioned it...That's why I said a timer after full recovery. Getting fully recovered is a significant amount of time already, plus a certain amount of time before the skill check appears. In that amount of time the killer should have either already caught the person, or decided they need to secure the one they have.
---
I just couldn’t quite capture the Steve Buscemi put through the garbage disposal look quite right
---
Yes! I've been waiting for  (https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810CmEBNRKL._SY445_.jpg)[Spirit 2] for awhile now.
---
Man tf was that 360? P3 dwight cant 360. No dignity    /s
---
its odd sometimes.  
---
i  had a game where i got 2  maybe 3 hooks total.  kicked a bunch of gens and hit a bunch of survivors, but they all managed to heal  quickly hence why so little hooks
---
and i still didnt get entity displeased
---
i had a game last night where i had  5 or 6 total hooks.  sacrificed the one dude (he was on his 2nd hook i believe)   kicked a bunch of gens, and somehow got entity displeased.   
---
still cant figure out the formula.
---
And that's what he's talking about, plus, some dev who was streaming trapper a bit ago said smthn about it as well.
---
I will wait as long as I need to for BHVR to give him the plastic surgery he needs as long as it’s good haha
---
FUCKING CUNTS!
---
I agree!
---
Just be immersed af, I don't think you need to fully repair them. If they're halfway done and you repair it until it pops it should count
---
So weird how we have teenage boy wearing robes and a ghost mask and ancient demons in the same game
---
/dadbydaylight
---
Don't bother with people who don't get the difference between gender and biological sex. Boomers gonna boomer.
---
It's hard to 360 with cold fingers covered in rust 8(
---
No, just no. Your down, and dying at a slower rate than being hooked. Run unbreakable if you hate being slugged, you shouldnt just remove killer pressure at base level.
---
Never said it had to be a generator grab. You can grab them off windows and pallets, too... (You gotta injure them, though.)
---
Classic Ghostface needs too be fixed. his cloak has weird physics and causes his entire ride side of screen to be blocked. Its like the cloak is stuck to the dagger lol. Looks awkward
---
r/deadbydaylight in a nut shell. Dozens of people asking the same question.
---
How long did it take you to snag all those links? Just curious.
---
No one picks Jesus?
---
The 'kill yourself' bit is more so about when there's only one person left and you are on the hook. Like, if they are being chased and you know you aren't getting saved, you can give up, and give them a chance. You can't do that on the ground.
---
Or just rank reset enough times til your Rank 17 and you wont even need Prayer beads.
---
Low rank Survivors have no clue how spirit works.
---
I got unhooked by a dwight with well make it and I felt so bad self caring in front of him 😔
---
Lmfao. Makes it even funnier.
---
it's reddit you dolt just laugh at the picture
---
What are they?
---
That and wearing his cloak is like a nerf. It blocks of the ride side of your screen. The ends of his cloak have weird physics and attach to his dagger or juist hang there in air awkwardly
---
I was about to go to rank 7 today but the rest put me back to rank 13 and then I ended up at rank 14 after some dodgy matches. Ever since the rest today I've had nothing but camping and tunnelling Killers and teammates who let me die on the first hook.
---
*Alrighty then
---
But you’re wrong. There’s more to biology than what you learned in middle/high school.

you only need to be on the gen when its completed! if you run bond or are in swf it makes this a lot easier.
---
The killers object is to HOOK the survivors. That's why you get points for it, and why it's required to rank up. Slugging people is just a way to say 'I know there's nothing you can do about it. so i'm going to do this', even though it's blatantly ignoring what your objective actually is. It's cheap. It's greedy. And it ruins other players experience, just so you can get that sweeeet 4k without having to worry about the last survivor actually having a way to escape.
---
You add them to a document?
---
It’s 50/50 for the survivor in what they can do.  They have 2 options, try to mindgame the loop, or run away.  It’s a guessing game, and is uninteractive.  You don’t know how the spirit will act.  It’s an INTERACTIVE game.  Guessing is not interactive.  You can’t guess every time because eventually you’ll lose, it’s just fact.  You guess right once, she gets her power back and then you guess again, and again until she gets you.  It’s not skill involved.  50% chance she doesn’t catch you, that’s pretty good odds right?  Well let’s take into consideration she uses her power 3 times.  You’re already down to 12.5% odds of getting away if it’s three times.  It’s like pre-patch legion.  they will EVENTUALLY down you and that’s a fact.
---
I couldn’t agree more and I actually quit playing recently because every game I got into was toxic. Killers/survivors only seem to take the game seriously at red ranks but it’s pain trying to get back there.
---
&gt;I'm not blaming the devs. It finally gave us a reason to play!
---
Jeez, how did we ever fill a lobby before the rift?!
---
That’s most likely it, thank you.
---
4 is all master challenges unless they change it.
---
Nea Karlsson, Nea Karlsson, and Nea Karlsson
---
Here come the crapper
---
The problem isn't the United States government. It's countries like Australia and Germany who are known to outright ban games with graphic content.
---
Someone who really hates the players.
---
I never had one to begin with.
---
Dude not all Claudettes are immersed af. I main Claudette and try to loop killers as much as possible.
---
I really hope the new killer is the alchemist but it doesn't look like it will. I think it's redundant to have two yamaoka killers l.
---
Made my day. I was just browsing DD sub too lol
---
the only thing separating pc players from consoles is the higher framerates and that is something behavior can fix then implement crossplay
---
Pretty shit killer if he cant even cut a playstation in half, let alone pallets
---
Science (and history) says, “Enbies are valid”
---
I doubt it, it’s just fan service to the original films. Not saying it’ll never happen, but I don’t believe this outfit means they’ll add characters/locations from Scream anytime soon.
---
All but confirms Rin's Father
---
Base product is like $20 and each DLC costs $7. With a total of 13 DLCs (a lot of which you can grind in-game currency for to reduce the own cost by paying with time instead) you pay about $110 total which I personally think is more than acceptable for a game with this much content. Not to mention that the DLC goes on sale all the time (I bought like half the DLC half off) and buying DLC bundles makes the cost significantly cheaper.
---
But no keep calling people who want to spend their own money on things they enjoy "denialists." You're so woke that you don't buy Dead by Daylight DLCs while you spend $10 at Starbucks per day.
---
I actually like to think that what this post says might tie into the oni demon theory, a oni demon that goes from generation to generation via the mask as it encourages slaughter.
---
Same here.
---
Exactly. I don't want offerings to thin the Mist as Wraith or offerings to thicken it as hillbilly and Huntress
---
Lol I love this list guy
---
Heres the strat, run dwight, for obvious reasons, prove thyself, balanced landing, Ds, and dark sense, go to mount ormound with a yellow or commoddious toolbox with a clean rag and socket swivels, did it first try.
---
That's a neat build, I usually do it on Hag but I'm going to have to try it on Spirit.
---
Where is this lore from?
---
Milf killer
---
We haven't ever gotten a related killer either so maybe we'll get a related surv too
---
Ohhhhh...  
---
I like the way you think.
---
Another possible option. I liked the rift idea... just to find out that the objectives of certain chapters are not doable. They can never do something right.
---
Did this man unironically use "EA" as an insult?
---
I'm actually dying right now
---
Fully repair 10 generators as The Ghost Face. Challenge must be completed in a ^single^ trial.
---
ok boomer
---
Brutal strength comes into play
---
Yeah but I meant in the same chapter
---
Snork killer when?
---
Most 110 killers are top tiers but ok.
---
Also are you really saying spirit is balanced bc you, a red rank player. can beat a green rank spirit?
---
That's already in the game, it's called fUcKiNg LaG
---
Agree
---
You just sound salty that you got destroyed.
---
So the killer should not eventually catch you? What do you think this game is a 1v1? If you make a few good reads and run her for 60 seconds your team can pop 3 gens if they're good.
---
The situation you just described would take forever especially if we are talking 2 health states. Soooo yeah she is counter able lol 
---
Is she unfun? Maybe. But again, that does not make her OP although I do admit prayer beads are broken. But that's an addon not spirit herself
---
I know what gg means but why tf is every one saying "gg piece of shit"
---
I wasnt doing anything toxic, I just ran through all his blood traps to get them off the map.
---
EVERY TIME
---
I've played 3 games with it so far and it definitely isn't blocking my view
---
That's a bad pig that will get one kill though. If the killer wants to throw away their whole match to guarantee One Survivor kill like a camping Leatherface... You can argue any killer is inherently unfun. Pig is the least commonly played killer though and Legion is like top 5 most played at every rank. Because Legion is brain-dead easy to play and I don't know why so much of the community seems to pick this character. When Legion is certainly still the most hated thing ever added to the game.
---
Pig needs some serious Buffs to discourage tunneling. It's pretty unfortunate the developers seem to hate her and nerf her every update. Although I've never encountered a pig that plays that badly despite hearing of them constantly.
---
Your argument is pointless. By that logic, why bother with any sort of backstory?
---
Survivors will complain about tunneling no matter what
---
so basically hag?
---
What this challenge means is completing three generators while dark sense is equipped
---
Rin Yamako's Father is gonna be the new killer?
---
So I just got that challenge done by only healing once?
---
The joke wasn’t funny. Even with a /s.
---
This had me laughing cause it made me think what if the next killer was Christine or Cujo lol
---
You forgot the part where I said that it did not go down in chases as a solution to tunneling.
---
Either way I refuse to speak to Legion Mains and block all of them instantly.
---
Stfu and take my upvote you silly betch.
---
&gt;You add them to a document?
---
I just open my profile and you can easily see my previous comments.
---
Mend works with this challenge.
---
Why don't you think Billy is balanced?
---
Exactly, no harm done at the end of the day
---
...what
---
For me it glitched and i got it without even healing one health state (still self care equipped) maybe getting unhooked counts???
---
Exactly. Like a clown nose or something. Give you 500 points and the exposed status for 30 seconds
---
I can imagine a survivor working on a gen and then looks up to see the hillbilly working with them lmao
---
While I agree, and don't condone that type of toxic behavior, being able to make sure another person can't play the game is not fair regardless. It's like when sabotaging hooks were permanent. It's not progressing gameplay, it's not making it fun for anyone, it's just preventing a player from having any fun what so ever.
---
Maybe the Ronin too
---
i honestly think people need to stop listening to streamers sometimes. self-care is a whole lot better than they make it out to be.
---
Yes. Because this video game character ruins the experience of one of my favorite games I have spent years on. Legion and Ghostface are intolerable for me because they are buggy masses that have both never been anything but a problem since they were released. I can't stand either of them. And it doesn't help most of the toxic scummy players pick those characters. It's mind-blowing to me that these mediocre characters are so played. I hate seeing them one out of every three matches.
---
I would much rather go against fun characters like doctor or Leatherface and hillbilly. It's to the point where I just instantly disappear against Allegiant Ghostface. I'm exhausted from playing against them so much.
---
I've said it a million times and I will say again. Fuck anyone who plays as the legion
---
I love how you stand there after like, "Did you see that?"
---
Thanks I was planning on buying that but I guess I should wait for the fix
---
LOL! :)
---
No, they wouldn’t be decayed and have body paint/tatoos and an evil-looking decorative mask.
---
It's the ancestor, not the father. It's what they've hinted at in spirits demon form
---
I just did my rank 1 achievement before reset last night for killer and I will never play in red ranks ever again. I hate it so much, it's the most stressful thing I've ever done in a video game. I can, I just hate it.
---
What did you just say about my hair?
---
It not about how strong she is its about how fun it is for both sides and for most survivors its not fun to face a spirit who you have to guess against each chase.
---
Don't understand why anyone *would* have a tantrum about it. It's just an option on a survey that has little to no impact on someone's day.
---
But just in the replies to this post alone I've seen people throwing a hissy-fit about how Behaviour "only did it for money!!!!1111" and "are just appealing to the SJW community!!!!!1111"
---
Some people get triggered by everything, to the point that they are more triggered by the "triggered SJWs" they claim to be against.
---
I can at least understand why someone would be mad about misgendering or something similar. But imagine being upset because someone was being inclusive and nice.
---
It’s tough to explain it.  Watch Scott Junds video on spirit
---
They do? I always run it
---
Theres honestly no reason why that would be the case. The devs arent THAT narrow minded. I think the killer is bound to be very different from the spirit anyways to distance itself from that idea
---
Sorry, but can you tell me where to download the same perks as on the screen?
---
This is why I love (most) of the dbd community. This is bloody brilliant 😄
---
I was doing my agitation quest and I was swinging around for fun after hooking 2 survivors in basement. Gg ez baby killer...and call me tunneler cause I only hooked 2 person x 2. Conveniently forget I left them 2x on floor. Told them off in chat and they seem cool later. But this is  so disappointing . Sigh
---
one time I was literally omw to the hook w plenty of time left before second stage and the random attempts to escape anyway...I just stopped mid-run and left the game
---
i do this literally every game
---
Your face when omaewa mo sindeiru
---
I had a shit ton on Ghostface, and when I finally decided to Prestige him about a month ago, I went on a ‘Gateau Gauntlet’, where I just played a load of matches back to back, bringing in the Gateau each time.
---
Oh, if that's the case it's not that bad. *puts pitchfork back in holster*
---
Why?
---
If you have to slug maybe you should get better at winning chases, since you are clearly worried about it.
---
Thank god I havent played my killers for long and it got back to rank 19 from rank 1 and it is very easy to do these at low ranks but the problem is I have to wait veeeery long queue for a single game which sucks / Major reason I havent done some the killer challenges yet but only the survivor ones
---
If you have enough time to place that many traps for that to happen then you have given them to much time to do gens
---
I hope so. It's hard to say since the rift is still completely new. I also love the variety the challenges give you. I think that's what they're meant for. However many people seem to only focus on the challenges, wether they have to be toxic to do them quickly doesn't matter to them
---
That’s the rule 34 DBD subreddit. So...Daddy/daughter porn?
---
It’s a part of the archives lore
---
aaand you have confirmed his point. how tf is he trying to start a fight
---
U suck omigosh
---
I have literally noticed no difference at all. You all are literally noticing shit that has always happened and people have always complained about (see: every Rage Wednesday) and are now just applying it to the rift because reasons
---
Fair enough. I respect your opinion.
---
Respect is earned, not given. When they fix core issues and show a desire to improve upon them OVER focusing primarily on shady monetization tactics, I'll start respecting them. Otherwise, I'll throw digs at them when necessary every chance I get.
---
Like u/YuriPetrova those are both bullshit reasons. A transgendered person doesn't have three legs and two heads; they look just like any other human being and Behaviour wouldn't have to make a new character rig for them. And while I understand that China is a large market there's more than enough controversy about American companies (Blizzard) bending their ass over backwards to let China fuck them for cash. But even under the context of bending over backwards for China they could still easily make the trans character American-exclusive and just release the perks as generalist perks akin to what Console players had for Bill's perks.
---
The new perks aren't going to involve Tumblr-shaming the Killer for assuming your gender. Characters are just skins and there's no reason for the skins to not be inclusive.
---
Yeah... Just gotta play Gen Jockey for a game. Put on Bond so you can see your teammates who are doing Gens and Dark Sense (for the challenge) and you should be good to go. Gonna be almost too easy in a SWF over voice. Have people 99% gens for you and calling you over.
---
I think I would prefer a native American themed killer. That would still fit in with the tribal shaman theme while making it different enough from the hag
---
No, Mathieu Cóte went out of his way to clarify that the roadmap is just the bare minimum when King mentioned that there wouldn't be a map next chapter.
---
I do this all the time cause boredom they have bad game
---
Agreed, I don't tend to worry about pipping, I'm just trying to have fun. 
---
So that can be my excuse why I have over 100 hours and still LVL 20. 🤣
---
Congrats, you're every stereotype and this is why people don't like you.
---
Many are speculating the first Yamaoka. Who built the estate, wore the mask, and wielded the missing katana.
---
Thanls for your honesty, is appreciated! But yeah that type of gameplay does ruin the experience for others. You will get the self care and pallet drop challenges even if you're not focusing on them. So it isn't necesarry
---
why cant Karl from the ghostface trailer be the next killer...oooo a samurai killer! Lame...
---
you dangled that carrot in your in face
---
Are you like 5 seconds old on the internet? Japan best us to this shit decades ago
---
Her jean outfit from the first movie would look so cute!
---
The community is never satisfied. Who cares if it's Rin's father? I think it would be cool.
---
5 seconds is a bit harsh, but something like 2 would be nice.
---
It would also be nice if injury had a downside besides being easier to find when being immersed is generally a bad choice, anyway, I agree.
---
“I thought you Pig mains LIKED getting thrown into life-or-death scenarios!”
---
“We do, doc! But you know what we don’t like? Getting nerfed into the fucking ground!”
---
That too could be quite interesting.
---
I did lol it's a joke. Watch Tru3Talent's video responding to that video. He explains every bit of why that's bullshit. Quite an interesting watch.
---
In ScottJunds own video he said the average chase time against his spirit was 34secs, with some lasting up to a minute. If 2 people are stacked they can easily finish a gen during a 34 second (average length) chase and if it lasts a full minute up to 3 gens could pop.
---
But yeah, that totally proves spirit is op lol
---
Yeah she actually looks like a girl with night out nea
---
It could happen someday in the future you never know. Especially with a new scream movie in development.
---
Unfoetunately yes
---
Oh nice. I play on PlayStation, but i can respect that you enjoy your experience on an Xbox.
---
Lol I knew what the sub is, but didn’t think incest porn lol
---
Oh I do not mind the rank and am not frustrated by it. I just feel like when you drop down, its because you personally did bad. It's only that part I do not like, when I had no choice in how the game went
---
Don’t buy the mask, useless
---
Tome I is for Claudette and Trapper only. The rest will involve other characters.
---
A killer who’s power is that they are like a survivor, people usually ask legion to be reworked to have this power.
---
That's exactly what it is. It's the demon that started it all. Hence spirits new cosmetic
---
It’s certainly playable (I’ve been going on a Ghostface Gauntlet tonight), but it’s very annoying.
---
I was talking about the fact that they would be fliating, because she's the spirit.
---
Okay, show us some of these raging mobs. You say that they are abundant, so it cannot be that hard to show them.
---
&gt;!inb4 breitbart links!&lt;
---
Dbd wiki on the yamaoka estate
---
He’s also super Blood themed, with both the phrase at the beginning and the blood traveling to the mask, almost like a sacrifice of some sort, and he powers up?
---
H O N K
---
She'd be the most broken endgame killer she wasn't nerfed and egc came out
---
Sinful Thots
---
Yea, this is a weird one. It's basically 'spam a lot of games', have perks that help you be immersed, and just do gens. Sadly, none of my friends play this game, so SWF isn't really an option. Maybe I will try and look for some people on the discord channel to do it, but I'm in no rush right now.
---
They really need to implement a system that allows people who have momentarily lost connection to reconnect. It seems plausible to just leave the survivors character in place after they DC, and allow them to take control of the character again if they regain connection.  
---
If you are on a wifi connection you could be experiencing interference, especially if you have other wireless devices such as headphones, mouse, keyboard, etc.
---
I'm guessing they expect the survivors to be potatoes at all times.
---
I guess they can’t do alchemist cuz the tome isn’t complete and the outro involves him etc. so I guess the whole tone is a teaser. But I mean The Hunger is already finished and it’s clear he is a killer.
---
Holy crap looking at all the deleted / heavily downvoted posts at the bottom of this post lmao. 4channers getting triggered over an option on a survey.
---
"SJWs are so easily triggered! They complain about anything lmao! Grow thicker skin Tumblr crybabies!"
---
"There's more than two genders."
---
"REEEEEEEEEE PANDERING TO SJW CULTURE ONLY DOING IT FOR PR DEVS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT MONEY THAN MAKING A GOOD GAME!"
---
True that's a good point
---
Nurse has a gas mask
---
It's not the father. It's the demon that started it all in their bloodline. The real hint was in spirits new cosmetic.
---
Nurse is in a couple gas masks and a hazmat bag at least
---
This. Loved Evil Dead, loved MoM. And now that it's nerfed I regret buying him.
---
Gg piece of shit.
---
Lot's of people have noticed the toxicity today (also in comparising with last days). You can't denie it has nothing to do with the challenges. I'm happy for you you didn't notice it though!
---
It’s probably his stealthiest outfit- it’s completely black (with no red like City Slicker has), has no wavy tassels that give you away easily- it’s probably his most practical outfit. 
---
*Well aside from the big ass cloak covering the screen.*
---
Good thing my challenge bugged and I completed it even though I didn't even fully heal myself once.
---
Usually the more simple explanation is the correct one.
---
It definitely does
---
It very well could, but we’ll have to see I suppose.
---
Why the fuck did BHVR use "kill" when that has literally always referred to moris while "sacrificing" is the act of killing someone on the hook?
---
Just the mask and nothing else? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Sexy.
---
Even a nurse is better because a trash nurse can't really get you while a trash spirit fairs better
---
This is most likely the case or the demon that got to the first yamaoka, considering spirits new cosmetic description
---
Sure but at the same time it means they’re not obligated to go beyond the road map and make a new game map.
---
Lol whoops nevermine
---
No gore.  It’s not necessary at all.
---
fuck that would give nurse a run for her money
---
Dude, I think we're already ripped. *flexes*  
---
You know what, you're right. The pants have got to go.
---
Wow. I watched it and didn’t realize how narrowly I viewed the utility of the perk.
---
Thanks, friend.
---
I want to put myself in a square I actually choose and I feel great into, not the one society and bigots want me to fit in at the expense of my own happiness/safety.
---
Yea, since the medkit changes and now self-care being less used as it already was, I still managed to easily get the done and used botany knowledge to take less time.
---
Next time I play Terraria I now want to name the NPCs after DBD characters.
---
Well, Spirit, and then maybe Nurse, Billy or Freddy.
---
None of those need nerfs, but they don't really need buffs.
---
Voodoo inspired killer with a dapper as fuck suit.
---
Think Baron Samedi from Smite.
---
I love that Trapper more than I thought I could love any drawings.
---
I bought it. I love it. It is definitely darker than his first black costume. The mask is a brilliant white though, brighter than his first mask.
---
Except if they're saying we need to do the equivalent of 3 complete gens in a match (like the dailies where we have to do the equivalent of 3 heals, etc..) that's almost impossible without coordination of some sort (or letting people die on hook while you do gens, or the killer regressing gens over and over.)
---
As someone who is a consistent Rank 1 survivor, I don't see spirits as often as people say, I think it's people being exacerbarating it all. Yes, she's there which makes sense since she's one of the best killers
---
Just watched scream last night I was thinking Stu’s house would be awesome, basically a big mansion maybe with smaller features around it, you could put some corpses around where people died like in the garage or the front porch or in the tv van. But I really like the idea they would use the movie sets from scream 3 because we could have Stu’s house and Sidney’s house an maybe Casey’s house.
---
And I would want randy as a survivor personally but I understand why people want Sid
---
Honestly, if you give your team notice before the match, things will go smoother assuming the killer wont dunk on your ass for no reason.
---
Same here, mask looks identical to me (potato settings). And if you were to show me the basic and the new knife, I wouldn't be able to tell you which is which. Also, basic knife has prestige.
---
Mine was glitched. Got a campy Leatherface. Didn’t even get a chance to try and heal myself and it said the challenge was completed.
---
Spirit part 2 Battle Tendency’s
---
She is getting eventual changes, that's been confirmed by a couple of devs, but what those changes are and when they are coming into effect is still unknown.
---
TRUSCUM FUCK OFF TO NARNIA

Are we making up words now?

COKE MILK
---
No harm done - By seeing Jonathan's way of fighting, you have seen and learned how much of a true gentleman he is. Being near a survivor for 80/60/40 seconds unlocks a token. The next time the survivor is hit, you get injured instead. Up to 1/2/3 tokens per trial.
---
"I, Speedwagon shall allow no one to harm this gentleman!"
---
A little boost -  Just being there for your friends helps them.  Whenever near a survivor being chased by the killer, they break into a sprint 150% their normal running spree. Causes exhaustion for 60/50/40 seconds.
---
"I was worried about Jonathan, so I came back with him."
---
Dirty Trick - Living from the slums has taught you some tricks. Gain the ability to put dropped pallets back up. Can be done 1/3/5 times per trial.
---
"Let's dance."
---
I saw Otz Orz...what’s his face. He used it with Judith’s journal to have tier 3 ready **every** chase because Judith’s journal+J Memorial gives you +65% stalk. 
---
Granted you could get a similar effect with Maje Your Choice. I think FC works nicely with MYC because the little audio cue tells you who’s the exposed target.
---
They aren't even close to ea.
---
All words are made up. Read up some semiology, truscum.
---
then you notice every pallet on the map is gone

dc.

Its gonna be hilarious when people dc once the 5-10 wait after dcing before you can queue again is implemented

I can't do the 2 hook in the basement with agitation I'm so crap .-.

Something like this
---
I can’t wait for it to be over. I have no interest in completing these challenges and the game feels almost pointless to play right now with so many people going to be playing dumbly for months.
---
**KOREMADE JA**
---
This just makes getting survivors into the basement easier lol
---
Memes
---
It's literally clarified... &gt;.&lt;
---
You just have to be on the generator when it completes. How much of that gen you participated in doesn't matter. Be on the gen when it goes from 99%-&gt;100%.
---
yes i do too
---
The average well adjusted person does not have that in their vocabulary. Obviously not you. You type like someone obsessed with Twitter/Tumblr.
---
This is not what people wanted when they asked for variety. We want new game modes or actual objectives beyond “do this thing 10 times.”
---
Last one seams a little to overpowered
---
You don’t need to buy jack shit to have a good time. You can buy cosmetics and characters by just leveling up.
---
Well, you know, atleast hes confident?
---
I run nurses, ruin, bbq, and discordance. Most of my games end with around 3 gens left to do. Some swfs will get out, but with a decent ruin spawn, its gonna take them a while
---
HOW ARE PEOPLE STILL REPOSTING THIS?
---
I HAVE NO IDEA, SHEEPS I GUESS
---
I know this was my first thought. People are blowing this way out of proportion
---
Spirit isn’t op
---
S M O K I N
---
Well, it would be a good combo with other obsession perks if 90% of them didn’t encourage you to leave your obsession alone lol.
---
But I asked for direct nerfs to survivors and you just reinforced a point twice. Eitherway, game is pretty balanced at this point, the time management needs looking into.
---
Bone Tomahawk
---
Noticed this this morning. I got camped in the basement by hag, while all my teammates were self caring in corners. Managed to do the challenge anyway.
---
I heard someone say it was blind the killer twice in a single match while they are carrying a survivor, I was pretty mad at the sounds of it. Pretty relieved it's not true
---
And there is illustrations of Onis drinking alcohol so I would think so.
---
I am unsure about the magic part, from what I know of the folklore, they are usually used as generic bad guys and brutes without magic powers (but a lot of physical strenght), kind of what cyclops are to Greek myth.
---
You did it a more honorable way than I did. I ran NOED and blood warden. Let them complete all the gens without chasing cus I felt horrible about what I was about to do. Last gen popped, NOED knocked a guy, hooked him, and facecamped him out. I have never sent a more apologetic message in my life.
---
You got my upvote for this mask!
---
Then being leaked won’t move up their timetable. But did the leaked videos relate to the Alchemist or blight at all?
---
ThE aVeRaGe PeRsOn
---
Fuck off.
---
Probably never. They really want the game to be super survivor sided but then everyone wonders why queue times are so high.
---
Spine chill lights up when the killer is looking in your direction.
---
Interactive as in you react to the other side.  Nurse is interactive, you can see when where and how far she’s gonna blink.  When huntress goes to use her hatchet you try to dodge it or break LOS.  Survivors react to that.  When spirit stands still, you don’t know what she’s gonna do.  Is she gonna phase?  Which side is she gonna go to?  You simply don’t know.  You react on your own will and then spirit reacts to what you do.
---
Great rebuttal 👍
---
The thing is there are builds you can use with those offerings to make them work but yeah it is annoying to buy things in the bloodweb that just get deleted or never get used
---
And I gave you direct nerfs so I'm not sure what the disconnect is here.
---
Explain how they aren't
---
Most of the game is paid dlc and the only way to get it's free currency is to grind your ass off for a single character or 1 perk from the shrine which rarely even has anything worth buying in it. Ie bbq only being in there a total of 4 times
---
I'd say BHVR has at least tripled their original investment and then some. Especially after the huge boost after the stranger things dlc.
---
If it was a f2p game I'd understand *but it isn't* it's a $30 dollar game with well over 100 in micro dlc
---
That's exactly how old legion worked, if a survivor was out of chase their clock went down. The only reason the current legion's system doesn't allowed for the old legion cheese is because it's based on their terror radius rather than the chase status.
---
Hopefully a bird will shit in your eye, truscum.
---
Yes but just in case ur forgetting we also have Steve nad Nancy but I like what ur saying
---
No, since it can easily be countered by breaking the pallet. Plus it only has a limited number of uses
---
FYI this can be done with a medkit, but you must have self care equipped
---
Best solution for you : slugged for 30 sec = you die
---
Intersex people are not common at all. They are 0.01% of the society. You are delusional if you believe the number is higher than that, but then you also believe there are more than two genders, so there’s that.
---
This is basic scientific fact. Chromosomes are only XX (Female) or XY (Male). Sometimes there are deformities such as XXY but those don't make a new gender, its just a deformity.
---
Looks great but I can’t really see her katana
---
10 on bubba and ghost face
---
Damn...either of these people could be the new Killer. Rin's father as the Entity already had him in it's sights or the Ancestor.
---
Rin's father could come with a new map featuring the factory he got fired from since it sounded like it was going under. He'd probably undergo a similar transformation as the Wraith since he's just an ordinary person. Unless he just dons the ancestors mask. This would be a bit strange though considering Rin wants to kill him and the entity knows this. Huh, could grant her wish though actually if her father is made into a survivor.
---
On the other hand, during the teaser it looked as though time was rewinding, take a look at the blood and smoke, it's reversing. This could imply time itself is reversing for the Entity to grab the ancestor themself who killed many people mercilessly while wearing the mask that instilled fear so it's connected to him as an heirloom and since the Entity can rip memories out of Killers the associated map could be a battlefield.
---
Found the bhvr balance team employee
---
aka The  Devs themselves.
---
That moment when yiu're so bad at fortnite that you didn't notice the difference.
---
Ahh, that's great news. But that can also create its own problems such as getting a gen close to done and being chased off of it by the killer and having someone else top it off. I guess I'll just save that one for last and hopefully complete it by the time the next rift comes around.
---
Yeah, there were three videos, one was the full thing with the Alchemist using a syringe on a pustula flower and then injecting himself and his eyes went all glowy and orange.  The other two were extremely short teasers for Claudette and Evan's stories.
---
What do you get when you cross a killer with an ebony mori and a toxic SWF? I’ll tell you what you get.
---
I’m pretty sure your arms are bigger than mines, damn! 
---
Yeah, I’d love for you to take a look at my butt since I’ve been working on it a lot lately.
---
Nah the blood was going backwards, its GER
---
So random question: if you have the Withering Blight skin for Plague, does it make her puke the yellow liquid instead of the normal color? If so, which piece of her costume affects this change?
---
So what will it be this time? The Oni? The Yokai?
---
But that's by design. Notice how better perks like Spine Chill only appear later in bloodwebs? The devs decided it's fine to have objectively bad perks instead of trying to make them all viable.
---
We'll never reach the truth I guess
---
Guys, i think they are trying to tell us something?!
---
Sometimes I feel like the devs don't play their own game..
---
Take the hit.
---
Almost all traps on that map are bugged and invisible idk why, but shhh let's keep it a secret between us.
---
Maybe because Self Care is 50% speed, it counts that as the equivalent of 2.
---
It's a teaser for a new spirit skin
---

---
The system works just fine. It gives you access to perks that you don't have the dlc for. That in itself is generous of them to do. You're You're just an entitled gamer lol. All original dlc can be bought with shards as well. The only thing you'll be missing out on are the license killers/survivors. That's it. Not their perks. Only the killer power and that's it. You sounds so entitled it's actually wild.
---
Wack
---
ah yes spooky myres time
---
Wait is it out?
---
you said it yourself lol, then use it to get perks/killers, especially the perks you'd otherwise have to spend money on to acquire
---
Let's hope so, granted that doesnt really solve anything. Just moving location
---
Its also ruining any real variety as every killer is trapper just about and he’s a fucking chore
---
ha. I had NOED, Blood Warden, RUIN and Haunted grounds selected for about 5 seconds and then the guilt set in and switched NOED out for Pop Goes the Weasel. Haunted Grounds is never that helpful for me so I swapped it out for something else after a couple of games.
---
I have not once said there was more than 2 throughout this entire argument, merely a predisposition for a sliding scale between the two (see: 0-1, with 0.5 existing). Mind that, you again ignored then very fact that humans can consist of multiple genetic components, as shown during DNA tests where testing a certain part part of someone (of their original body, not an implant) resulted in a different dna result than expected, with one example showing a mother not having the same dna as her own child. 
---
Also your example number only indicates those that have been reported for that number, so yes that number could be greater, and also only tracks for those that general populace would look for a physical trait of, meanwhile I’m speaking about genetically intersex, which is something that logically could exist but no one really tests for.
---
I find your discussion style strange. It points to certainty in a field that has shown we don’t fully understand it and speaks strictly from a point of view of personal perception rather than scientific discovery and discussion.
---
It’s... pretty well brainwashed thinking. Of which I’m certain you’d say the same of me but it’s a little hard to make that argument when I’m self taught unless you’re going to argue that I am either just insane or brainwashed myself which, frankly would just be too obvious and stereotypical of a direction for you to take this discussion.
---
I guess my curiosity is leading me to question more about why you even think this way. You speak with such certainty about something quite uncertain.
---
All hail the Demon Sultan!
---
Unfortunately the lore is only tied to the master trials, which are the hardest ones.
---
The Oni
---
Oh, yeah, mandatory minimal-effort base-covering. Utterly heroic.
---
Excuse me but why the fuck are there 5 killer challenges and 11 survivor ones? That's just fucking annoying as a killer player.
---
self-care, botany knowledge, empathy, auto-diadact. become the realest healer to walk the face of the earth and use self-care to get auto-diadact stacks. improvise, adapt, overcome
---
The pallet drop ones are probably going to be the worst.  Some of these challenges are basically asking Survivors to sandbag.
---
switchblade???
---
Keep in mind there’s normal and crazy state still
---
Yes please daddy.
---
I would too, I really hope it's the Rin's father being possessed by her super great grandpa because it would allow for SO much more lore options in the future with future killers.  Maybe even opening doors to other killer related killers like Archie MacMillian or Anna's mother.
---
To BHVRs defense, I'm pretty sure these were never really meant to be done fast. In other words, they should take more than just "some short time".
---
Yeah, but we don't know how. Ideally just the vault animation and nerfing beads, maybe lighting her up more when she phases.
---
Run Pharmacy, produce the med kit in the match, lose it by the end, no net loss.
---
Oof you just unironically said entitled gamer
---
No m8 I just think games that are almost entirely made up of micro dlc should go free to play.
---
If x amount of sales are made of micro after initial return on investment, then going f2p should be a requirement
---
This would stop any games from becoming a cash grab
---
maybe they're just sick of the trans circlejerk on reddit
---
You seriously think their player numbers and profits for these places are anywhere near NA and EU in general? Come on.
---
They need to do what Total War Warhammer did and just release a DLC pack for something like $3 that adds blood and gore to the game.
---
I don't think the putting pallets up 5 times is good maybe 1/1/2 but maybe that's because I'm a killer main
---
Sloppy Butcher + Nurse Calling all week hell yeah.
---
Extremely plausible.
---
Any of these available for the Switch yet?
---
I can't even accept the challenge in the first place.

My theory is that the yamoakas inherited wealth from an ancestor who promised a demon a future child in exchange, that demon owns yamoaka bloodline, it messed with rins fathers head, rins father had something whispering in his ear, it coulf have been the entity but rins father felt hopeless because of then going broke and his wife being sick
---
I also wonder if were going to see tentacles/tendrils in the game ;)
---
If im correct, truscum means that you believe that you need gender dysorphia to be trans, which is, well, true. So I have no idea what the other guy is on about.
---
Ok...?

golden freddy is ness

In the original movie ghostface used a switchblade

Thank you !!!!
---
In case you didn't notice, he is just making fool of the king because he says that he is almost sure of who the killer is by a couple of hints
---
Took me till 46 on nurse
---
I believe it’s because you can only do it early in the unhooking animation. Like you have to stand on top of them when they start the animation early.  
---
OR they could be faking it, baiting you into an m1 so that they can get the unhook while you are recovering from the hit.

Lots of survivors consider it tunneling if you hit them more than once per game so it's nice to see someone who has at least a little common sense.
---
The house/forest would be a good map.
---
At higher ranks, every second counts. I often just get on a gen injured and if I run across another survivor I'll get them to heal. Self care takes too long, and with some killers running thanat+sloppy combo, youre gonna waste enough time self caring when you couldve gotten a gen done in that same amount of time. I often see survivors run off into a corner to self care which just wastes more time... 
---
As a killer, i love it when people self care :P
---
The mori rift challenge (Mori one survivor) that was datamined for tome level 2 was replaced so at least some of them are being looked at.
---
I dislike the Mori and NOED related ones. I use NOED and Moris myself sometimes but I dislike the game "forcing" me to have to use them if I'm not in the mood for it. Also this means survivors would see a massive influx of NOED and Moris and thats never fun.
---
I am NOT looking forward to escape without being hooked with spine chill. Expect a MASSIVE influx of Blendettes running Spine Chill, Urban Evasion, Sole Survivor, and Left Behind waiting for everyone else to die to grab hatch. If the killer ever finds them they'll just DC.
---
I’m not making fun of anyone specifically. It’s just a joke
---
He looks like a damn wannabe poser, W H E R E S M Y S W I T C H B L A D E BHVR?!?!!
---
That's why I like asking what it means whenever someone complains about it. Forces them to describe survivors literally just playing the game.
---
I thought it was intentional in a totally unwarranted Trapper nerf, but apparently it's just an accidental Trapper nerf.
---
Chinese or a feral killer.
---
just finding an empty USB takes 15 minutes lmao, then opening up the files, uploading, switching PC on, downloading the files, and uplading to reddit would probably take up to  half an hour, for a mostly inconsequential thing
---
Why hello there, we just had a match together!
---
Honest question; is there anything to make you think their powers *wouldn't* be distinct?
---
Yeah I'm going to have to agree with that DBD was meant to be more of a casual game where you can hop on play a game or 2 to relax then do something else
---
Can I also say that just 4 different versions of "Catch X survivors in bear traps" is a really boring set of Trapper-based challenges.
---
Seriously, I'd prefer something similar to an easier adept match at least once.
---
It’s a glitch the other person did and some people got banned for it
---
Ayy &lt;3
---
Yeah, the cap has always been crippling. But, you know, gotta preserve that economy.
---
Thanks although I am getting tired of some killers not understanding where some survivors are coming from with some complaints and vise versa
---
If you looked under the comments of the teaser on the video on reddit everyone’s saying it means Your blood is the Yamaoka’s
---
did he say waaAaaaa like spirit?
---
I'm a killer main too, I think it's fair enough. It's not like the survivor can immediately pick it up, I think of them as coming back later to do it.
---
Besides, I usually immediately break pallets when they get dropped
---
If you have Doctor simply facecamp in treatment mode spamming M1 as fast as humanly possible (Mash your left mouse button as fast as you can) in front of the hook. Since you don't swing your weapon you (usually) can grab survivors as soon as they go for the unhook, even if they try to fake it.
---
It doesn't always work, sometimes it'll force out a hit instead (IDK how since you're in treatment mode, but it can happen) but it'll usually work.
---
I wouldn't call Nurse's changes small. Small would be nerf beads, vault anim, and no collision when phasing. Nurse's nerf would be stun when coming out of phase.
---
Even the blood in my dick?
---
Have you made sure to claim the previously completed ones?
---
No u
---
I would love to see them fix the sleaves of the ghostface skin
---
The Hag Blight Skin still makes you drop FPS when you’re placing a trap.
---
I honestly wonder if they even have a testing team
---
:]
---
No harm done is potentially ridiculously overpowered.  
---
Say you stay near a survivor and get 3 tokens. You let that survivor run the killer on the other side of the map. He gets hit, you take the hit on the other side of the map.  
---
Bring a purple medkit, botany knowledge and you can just heal back to full, repeat that twice and you have a survivor who needs 5 hits to go down. The killer can’t just come for you on the other side of the map.
---
Are you sure you want people running Bond, speeding by you, then using your own Perk to ditch you with the Killer?
---
Ahaha 
---
It does suck though, I don't play regularly. Only with friends. I'm decent but holy shit PC players just crush you in a build battle.
---
They can assign shortcuts, build insanely fast, have better accuracy etc. The only thing console players get is a slight aim assist, and PC players complain about it... 
---
I'm like 🤭🤭🤭 I honestly can't play that shit without friends.
---
How's the mask different?
---
I've gotta have self care for the rift though
---
They for some reason don’t have them done by the time I finish putting those traps down. Also I go for the closer ones usually and abandon farther ones until I end up closer via chase.
---
Jumping.
---
I play at high rank, it's still invaluable and teammates I've found are even more unreliable.  Self care doesn't take long at all unless you're running thanataphobia, and even that can be countered by a med kit.
---
You need to be alive to do gens, I'd rather delay the game a bit and be able to take another hit and waste more of the killers time than simply focus on generators.
---
samurai incel vs oni chad
---
That sounds bad. Nah.
---
Just go to low rank.
---
Not even joking, had 2 games tonight already where I did 3 gens solo. Shame I didn't have this challenge active.
---
Could just take a while.
---
My bet is on the name of The Oni.
---

---
Funny, but the challenges aren't that hard. There are a couple of hard ones but you have what, a month to complete them?
---
I want to watch the world burn
---
I like how this game has an accurate portrayal of a woman without makeup actually. That’s kinda cool.
---
do you mean rank reset? it happens today at 5pm pst i believe
---
thats the same as saying "just bring iron will against spirit" NOTHING should be ok simply because there are perks that can help with it. the game should be balanced around the highest skilled players at base kit.
---
Look at her putting on iri heads when she can't even hit a clearly telegraphed vaulting survivor
---
You guys are all idiots we getting barney
---
Ah yes, The Oni. To make sure he's balanced, he cannot break pallets. Have a great one!
---
TAKE THAT BACK. I love mid to end game trapper especially when survivors inadvertently have the remaining few gems next to each other.
---
Also, perks shouldn't be mandatory. No perks should ever be MANDATORY. The thing that makes them PERKS is giving an advantage, not allowing you to hold the baseline.
---
He probably hasn't gained enough pips to rank up at all.
---
They don't have to, and they won't. Is it an indie game. They arent a large company either. They can do what they want, its their game. And you shouldn't play it. Considering the fact that you're whinning this hard about it.
---
So far that is my first and only teachable I've unlocked and I'm thrilled it turned out that way.
---
"They both might wield a katana, therefore they're definitely going to have similar powers. Yawn."
---
*Goes back to playing Myers, Legion, Clown, and Ghostface*
---
Just realized u could possibly be running hex ruin i was thinking no perks still but if u werent then theyd have 3 gens done by then
---
Yeah, but usually if you have bad games you de pip?
---
P3 Blendettes 2 op man
---
Huntress and Plague don't need much of a buff either. Maybe a small rework around Huntress' add-ons if the community sets their sights on them, or a change to cleansing and Plague's Corrupt Purge, if BHVR feel like it. The arguements there aren't that strong though.
---
Protector mask spirit, for patrolling gens, and Vengeful for attacking?
---
im half blind, did not read that properly
---
I mean its prolly not a lot but sure!
---
Especially with a screencap of Spirit killing Rin with her mori.
---
Fair. I was only meaning it as a joke tbh.
---
When I get a auto aim miss I make a high pitch ohhhhhhh!!!!  You win again auto aim!!!! Damn you!!!
---
Dropping that item with franklins and trap it as the Hag is borderline bullying. Done it a couple of times. I'm not the kindest man in the fog. :)
---
Oh, well damn...
---
Nah. I didn’t say I was playing without skills earlier, I was saying in a no perk situation those were the counter plays to killers.
---
Of course I’m running perks. I’m running brutal strength, enduring, stbfl, and iron grasp.
---
This time around the grind has majorly increased. Save 15 off books safely, heal 10 survivor health states, fully deplete 6 medkits etc. 
---
The grind still isn’t major but people will be grinding them out which leads to major toxicity. I have one more health state left to heal thanks to slugging killers. Then it’s the dreaded Dark Sense master challenge for me
---
Every huntress with half a brain using IR Heads know it’s better to keep the axe until you’re right next to the survivor for an almost guaranteed hit
---
So your saying it's ok to tunnel but not ok to recommend perks also no its not really the same since the spirit is a specific killer although I agree no one perk should be needed to play against a specific killer.
---
I just passed an Nsfw post so idk about thatttt
---
It won’t ever be over. The tombs and archives are staying and change every 70 days so you’re going to be gone forever.
---
Hahaha, sorry, I'm a filthy casul and only want to play characters I recognize like Michael Myers and Freddy
---
You'll throw digs at them even then! I've seen your comments! Explain why having chests be locked, and requiring a dull key to open is a good idea! Explain why you have a bias towards killer!
---
Ohhhhh, my bad
---
This is the 667th comment.
---
So close
---
Same, it blocks a pretty significant amount
---
There not that hard but you have to go out of your way to play different killers and play with not good perks that you might not have
---
Tbh I find the teammates self caring more unreliable. Lots of killers run sloppy already, you can bet there'll be more running it for this level. 
---
I guess we just have different play styles then!
---
2 basement hooks with agitation is pretty simple with trapper
---
Ghostface would love that you know that.
---
But are the two versions of DbD similar enough to be the same game, or will things bug out?
---
No no, you cant argue dbd is a small game anymore. It is THE horror game and it has a small bit off being competitive which tracks even more of a crowd.
---
God and then when they got demo? They probably brought in so many more people than they every thought they would
---
Your argument was valid 3 years ago but definitely not today
---
What do you get?
---
is there supposed to be a new survivor this chapter?
---
It's still the same color from what I've seen. Though I omly bought her body and weapon pieces
---
That was not the question
---
FWIW he is essentially Great Value brand Part 3 Jason. Even has a beat up TOTALLY NOT A HOCKEY MASK
---
While it is possible Rin’s father is the killer, I find it possible he could be the *survivor* since The Spirit’s lore mentions that Rin became a killer after an agreement with The Entity that she would get revenge on her father, and what better vengeance is there for Rin than having her father be one of the many people she torments.
---
Because he can't read lmao
---
Was I not meant to cleanse? I always do
---
Really hoping for the ancestral samurai. It'd be awful both lore-wise and to the sake of a satisfying narrative if it were Rin's father.
---
Look at my new meme
---
Oof that's actually brilliant, and yeah not the nicest 😂gotta find fun as killer where u can get it lol
---
Oh he’s a little nervous
---
I too would also want randy but also understand why others would want sid. Both would be pretty cool though.
---
Me claudette with spine chill
---
Yeah because repairing 3 gens will be hard
---
It has 213 upvotes
---
I can't tell you how many times I've been screwed by reds blowing healing skill checks.  I'd rather have my life in my own hands.
---
It being BOTH is great because we could get an ancestral Yamaoka samurai as a Killer and Rin's dad as a Survivor.
---
You also cant pick up pallets that are broken so that's pretty fair
---
You think grab animations are borked, I started a hooking animation that stopped halfway through yesterday and cost me a game.
---
I always viewed killers into one of several types (as a survivor)
---
Loopable/not loopable
---
Run/hide. 
---
Spirit is a nonloopable/hide killer. The more aggressive you play as a survivor, the most difficult she is. She gets rewarded by you being super focused and objective orientated. I usually slow down, and focus more on baiting out longer games because her power isn't as good against people taking the game slow. Yes you want to end quickly, but she wants you to rush. To run around everywhere, to work gens together.
---
&gt; But how many games will be ruined by someone camping basement to confirm the 2 hooks?
---
What? You just need to hook them, not sacrifice.
---
So Rin can mori herself?
---
Watch the joker movie and you'll get it 🤣
---
Better yet is getting all the items in the basement, then being Ultimate Basement Guardian Bubba
---
You have to catch them with a trap and then grab them while they’re still struggling to get free. That’s why is says “catch” 10 survivors. Don’t hit them or let them free themselves.
---
Thats just unfortunate. Tbf tho not all red ranks deserve to be there... definitely been some questionable players Ive met there lol
---
Kinda seriously messed up of the entity to take someone on the spectrum. Like, I get that the entity is not nice or anything, but I feel like that’s just another few degrees wrong. It’s like if little kids started popping up in the trials.
---
I checked that as a claudette main
---
Shugoki smash! Would be a must
---
Gonna have to wait until November's over for this one.
---
Oh, thanks
---
Me after reading the lore: Dead by Depression :'(
---
That actually takes long enough that it seems fair. Blow a minute searching, get a second God Pallet.
---
&gt;Yamaoka is the name she carries from her ancestors, who unleashed hell on the battlefield.
---
I must have missed this. anyone know what "Yamaoka" means or references? Google Translate just says it means Yamaoka.
---
Good. Speedwagon is meant to be overpowered.
---
On the serious side, I can fix that to where after getting the a token, you cant get it back. So if you got one and use it, you can only get 2 now. And so on
---
I want David S Pumpkins
---
I don't understand the logic people are using. Rin has her powers because she was murdered and is now a ghost; did he also somehow turn into a ghost? How/why?
---
I said a 60 second chase. The spirit spends time finding a survivor, during that time the other 3 have found gens. Then a 60 sec chase, then about 2 secs to pickup, maybe 5 sec average carry time then 2 more secs to hook. Now the spirit has about 10 seconds to try and interrupt the 3 people working on gens. At best she has bbq, makes it to one of the people as their gen is at 97% begin another chase (with her power depleted since she used it for distance), the other 2 gens pop, one person unhooks while another finishes the 97% gen so she damn well better hope that chase doesn't last 34 seconds or shes probably gonna lose a 4th gen.
---
A 60 seconds chase is very strong. And while we are talking about them not countering each other point, scottjund literally gives no good reason why Tur3s mind games dont work. His explanation was "they all just involve dropping the pallet right away" and then goes on to suggest the spirit should follow this person around the map just breaking all the pallets as they drop them lmao
---
Any good team will absolutely wreck you before you destroy 90% of the pallets on the map. Even if the survivor is literally just running from pallet to pallet, throwing it down and waiting for the killer to break it. All the other 3 survivors need is 3mins. But yeah that apparently proves all of Tru3s spirit counters wrong and means shes op. Cuz ya know, just break every pallet on the map. Duh ez win.
---
The main reason Scott even seems to think shes OP is becuase with certain skins you cant tell when shes phasing. But I think we all can agree
---
that's a bullshit glitch that needs fixing. It's not a nerf it's a bug fix
---
But now people on that challenge will camp pallets and won't conserve ressources, meaning that end game will be fucking hard as a survivor
---
Co-op Killers.
---
Back in the days when infinites were still common, I said Ghostface should be added and his power should be that instead of a power, someone else is playing a second Ghostface on the same map.
---
Obviously it'd take some adjusting now, so it could be Legion doing it too.
---
By the time you become killer the gens be done already lmao. Maybe if on survivor form you could sabotage gens so they're all fucked up it could work but it would require some serious tweaking. That kinda concept is always broken as fuck or underpowered as hell.
---
On ps4 the majority of players use this perk. Can't speak for level 1-5 players but honestly it's the most popular perk
---
I’ve already hit puberty.
---
I'll forgive a killer for "tunneling" me if it's another survivors fault for poorly timing the unhook. You can't blame the killer if survivors serve each other up on a platter.
---
Gotta make it super grindy, makes sense
---
Not the community, the dev team itself is small. And it is still an indie game. That's what it is classified as. I don't know what what else to tell you.  Also saying "probably" instead of giving actual stats of how many players were brought brought in, isn't a "fact" everything you've said so far has no meaning behind it.
---
Then Ultimate Basement Guardian &lt;M1 Killer&gt;
---
Honestly the first set were dumb but not annoying.
---
These are fucking tediously idiotic. I don't even want to see level 3 or 4 they'll be literally impossible
---
Those are the most broken perks I've ever seen. Imagine a nurse that could see when you were kinda near a pallet
---
Cant depip below rank 16 ( rank 15 as killer)
---
I'm really just here because I'm addicted to unlocking stuff. I need Miss Pussins, then we'll talk about leaving!
---
X
---
I always thought that a samurai would be a much cooler killer than a naked chick with teleportation
---
Some are easy some ore really hard. Almost all of them are tedious and needlessly tine consuming taking multiple games to complete
---
I'm afraid I'll be sucked off
---
Truscums also deny non binary identities. Therefore, the other poster is a truscum.
---
When this happens I'm always grateful af lol. I'm rank 17 and still new so when the killer is higher ranked and see me struggling 😔
---
That Nurse's Calling (if that's the one where your aura is visible while healing) is gonna wreck so many players trying for this challenge
---
The second one seems to specifically counter NOED/Iri heads/Exposure status  which I'm all about. It's an end game perk so its usefulness only extends to endgame build killers so it would seem to punish anyone who's taken too long to kill i.e. campers. It would be hell for people who genuinely couldnt get the kills before end game though. 
---
It seems to be situational as well cause it could be be countered by things like Bloodwarden.
---
That’ll be it. Ta
---
Infantry Belt
---
Won't even let me claim them. I completed them, tried to claim them, no button.
---
In japenese legend. When a person dies in great rage or sadness they come back to torment those who made them feel this way. If the person is innocent they choose random victims to prey on. The entity seen Rin's fury and passion as more useful and fitting than her father's petty meltdown.
---
Or maybe not have them start as a survivor, but just have the killer mimic one so other survivors didn’t know and then after a while of them stalking you then they change
---
I would have used monstrous shrine instead of ruin but I didn’t have it.
---
Although I'm pretty sure hatchets do proc it, unfortunately no one comes in the basement when I'm playing Huntress with Insidious. I wonder why...
---
More photos [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dpw69x/unable_to_progress_in_my_archives_despite_doing/).
---
Lol , best time to run slipy butcher
---
Sorry the flash was a bit strong
---
Bro it's probably just a tease at the spirit rework
---
Nea didn’t burn down the asylum, she just graffitied it
---
It's kind of interesting, but there's not much for potential payoff. Killers never meet lore-wise, Survivors can't fight back in-game, and nobody has voice acting.
---
Licensed Killer/Survivor pairs would probably be more enticing if the Survivor could actually have reactions/interactions with them.
---
It’s simple you don’t
---
Its rank reset. Rank 4 should go back to 11.
---
Think the rank 9 you saw is just the example photo they use for rank reset
---
I dislike a lot of those because it makes people play worse. 
---
None of these should be in a single trial.
---
Yes it's good.
---
Frames are capped at 30 but consistent.
---
Lobbies are super fast (in the U.S. at least)
---
Freddy and Leatherface are not in the game as of yet due to legal issues
---
Everybody is relatively new and their is practically no in game toxicity
---
No end game chat or way to message people so no toxicity their
---
Has dedicated servers that work really well for the most part
---
DC's are only really an issue at the red ranks or very low ranks
---
Graphics actually look really good when in handheld mode due to the smaller screen, docked mode is okay.
---
Where did you get that from? Nothing about the definitions I've seen or the usage of it means that they deny non-binaries, purely that they think that you need gender dysphoria.
---
Isn't Doctor also connected with Nurse?
---
So is his mask. I've always found Asian urban legends and horror far scarier than anything us Yankees here make.
---
It's not obvious at all. Maybe when you're 30 miles away from her and she's standing still. But when you're caught at a pallet which WILL happen eventually, there's no way to tell when she is and when she isn't, especially with the schoolgirl outfit.
---
She can wait 30 mins standing still actually faking it, but decide to randomly phase and you will have no clue, and no reason to believe she decided to start phasing.
---
I agree. I hope they do something with the japanese folk lore.
---
damn it, I was so happy to get 9. thx for the info
---
Yeah the community would be very hyped, wouldn't they?
---
You don't need to camp, just hook and go that's what I did
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank#Rank_Reset
---
There's no way you'd be r9 after reset
---
Peanit isn't really clarifying anything since they're just assuming based on how they interpret the challenge. Some people are saying that being on gen when it's done isn't counting and you need to repair the gen all the way through.
---
The whole point of The Spirit’s lore is that she didn’t get the satisfaction of that though
---
&gt; I started off watching TrueTalent to learn to play killer but he can get so salty.
---
He complains constantly, and every upload he does is OMG THE MOST OPTIMAL SWEATY SURVIVOR TEAM or the same Ghostface build over and over.
---
i always took it that Rin is trapped in the moment the Entity took her, during which all she could think of was revenge and hate. same reason she's still in pieces.
---
Its come at such an awful time. Last week at red ranks it was fun, plenty of time to mess about.
---
Now its rank reset and im put with survivors who go down in 5 seconds per chase. So busy pulling people off hooks and being the only one to do gens i dont have time for the challenges
---
Impossible without a SWF group
---
I keep getting my canon mixed up sorry, I just remember the fact that the nurse has a box of match sticks and a plaid flannel which are both likely Nea's. Also her clan tag is Mashtyx
---
It's just a name.
---
Or a movie set map with Stus recreated house as a part of it? 🤔
---
You rarely get the satisfaction of escaping as a new player, anyway. They might want to at least get a decent perk loadout and some familiarity with the maps first, though.
---
Or **BUBBA**
---
The spirit needs nerfed/reworked. I use iron will and urban evasion and still get caught by her because I can't tell if she's phasing or not
---
Wouldn’t it be The Oni? The mask is in the trailer.
---
Even though the teaser that went up is literally called Chapter 14 Teaser
---
I'd say you hit the nail on the head.
---
I have seen truscum used in the manner I used it on r/traa, which is where I picked it up.
---
Pretty sure grinding is still necessary to an extent even with the challenges, but the challenges obviously reduce the grinding.
---
Is there another teaser? Because I'm thinking of the last one
---
You can get it by doing the equivalent of 3 generator repairs in a single match with the perk on. For example, half of two different generators counts as completing a single generator.
---
Your telling me the next killer is rin's dad.
---
So gore isn’t necessary, but bad language is? Gotcha.
---
Before anyone else does yeah. You have to outperform 3 other people.
---
Or escape a match with Claudette while also using self care to heal two health states... it would be so satisfying completing both in one match
---
Did you just ignore everything I said? I addressed this in the message you replied to.
---
They are supposed to get more difficult. Have you seen Tome 4?
---
Sadly my teammates know how to do generators, even though they don't know how to loop or unhook people. I wish it would be the other way around. "I do 4 gens and you keep looping the killer!"
---
Time to derank to 20...
---
Right?! Poor Danny was born in the wrong decade, he would have a blast with instagram. I mean, yeah, switchblade!
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dvz4dt/noticing_a_lot_of_glitches_with_plague_since/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Yeah but if you leave the person on the ground and chase the person who needs the hits, that leaves another survivor (which is the 3rd one,)  not on a gen because he needs to rescue the downed survivor. So that’s 3 people not on a gen. Which is a good thing.
---
Never thought of that, never played killer
---
Yeah i fully agree
---
2 gens, no. 3 gens, kinda. Basically saying repair 3 gens all by yourself with no interruption from the killer. Good luck
---
As a survivor main I love playing against spirit. One of the most exhilarating parts of the game is when you hear a spirit coming and you juke them out by walking the right direction and they can't find you
---
Commies mad
---
Well, otherwise players will have addons and offerings and perks and that'll ruin the game.
---
Wait, all the veterans already have those, and all the newbies wouldn't be overpowered with them.
---
...but I'm sure there's SOME reason. Gotta keep consistency!
---
...wait, they keep adding more perks and diluting the possibility of getting the meta ones.
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
We got one yesterday and one today. You've probably seen this already but if not here:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2nh3Xbj3\_M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2nh3Xbj3_M)
---
Yea i think it is the former. I know about the cheesy stuff you can do to avoid it like tapping which is stupid as hell. But honestly they should make the time window a bit bigger.
---
LMFAO
---
My bad.  I’m an idiot with rage issues. Sorry.
---
Can I have a link to that compilation?
---
Ahh, that's a shame - that would have been a neat little effect! I think I'll probably just buy the body then, just wanted to make sure I wouldn't miss out if like, the weapon made it change color or something. Thanks for the reply!
---
Happened to me so many times. I like to believe that it is a mismatch between server and client and i shouldn't have grabbed in the first place just to make myself feel better lol
---
That's true I didn't think about that when I posted it
---
Honestly as long as they never introduce loot boxes I'm fine. I don't mind buying the dlc chapters because it helps support the devs. I never really feel like buying skins because appearance means nothing to me. Every once in a while I might use my shards on cool kill one weapons but that's about it.
---
Okay okay hear me out. Japanese is spoken in the trailer. Japan is in Eastern Asia and more specifically in the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean contains the Mariana Trench. Trenches were used in World War 1 in combat. World War 1 was primarily fought in Europe. Europe is a geographic location on earth. Earth contains countries, which are defined by humans. Humans created several things, among those things was religion. Most religions involve demons. You know who else is a demon? Pennywise. Coincidence?
---
SIGH. You right. I guess I'm a Trapper main now.
---
Yeah, probably the worst part of the whole game is the 5 pages of perks and only about 1 page of perks being viable. Really on both sides most perks are complete garbage.
---
I'm almost 100 percent sure that's not true. Pretty sure Ghostface uses a hunting knife in all the Scream movies.
---
Yep had that happen in the match I did before work.  Thankfully somehow me healing myself to about 90% with a medkit somehow completed the mission for me.
---
Then they probably chamged the meaning or use it differently, because they call transcum transphobic, when theres nothing transphobic about being truscum so idk.

---
Fucking try me. 
---
And that's just steam. That's not counting psn, xbox and switch
---
&gt; would be super easy to do
---
Why do you think devs want you to have easy time doing challenges?
---
It’s nice to know ! Thanks !
---
Will somebody please upload a screenshot of the new ghost face cosmetic?
---
Plague's mechanics are just messed up. Right now she has a binary of being too strong if you can't loop her and too weak if you can. I still think she should build up Corrupt Purge with time Survivors spend infected, but not be able to take it from fountains so it's safe to cleanse at all but the last one.
---
Of course, the resource competition for the single-use fountains could get salty.
---
What if the killer is Rin’s mom... and the survivor is her dad
---
I've seen a lot of people just mentioning challenges like that in pregame chat :) It helped me get some of them done, that's for sure!
---
What is that, a perk that gives Mangled or something?
---
Wtf is this supposed to mean
---
*her,sorry for the mistake
---
Omai wa mo shinderu
---
Bamboozled
---
I've got a few remaining, but some people got stupidly lucky with them in their bloodwebs.
---
Mine is working now
---
A ***FOOLISH*** Yamaoka warrior wielding a magic sword
---
Mikey is also good, specially with scratched mirror, although that might not work on high ranks.
---
Also it says "interrupt" but that does not mean its only for gens, unlike the "Silent Approach" achievement so I am thinking window grabs should work too right? or even locker grabs when the survivor is trying to leave the locker or entering it.
---
My man.
---
They share similar professions and some outfits but lorewise no, Nurse was active in the early 1900's in the Mental "Health" profession, doctor was active in the 1960's-1980's (rough timetable) as an aide to the CIA as a perfectly humane information extraction and interrogation specialist
---
Imagine if Rin was the new survivor
---
I believe just touching a gen counts as you completing it if it gets done. Thats how it was w Tome 1 for me at least.
---
She's barely overpowered, add in collision and she's fine
---
Wow I didn’t know that. That’s actually pretty cool
---
Ok!
---
\*Clown accidentally slices own finger.\*
---
“Meme Templates” = You screenshotting every single frame and calling it a Dead By Daylight meme
---
Seriously, these things have been clogging the front page for almost a week now, enough.
---
I've already concidering saying fuck this game because every game is toxic garbage anymore. I've completely stopped playing killer.
---
These challenges might be it. I might drop dbd completely
---
Spirit isn't really fine. It's not even her strength, just that she doesn't give any feedback. It pretty much becomes a singleplayer game at that point.
---
They were around for the game's third anniversary.  Chances are we'll see something similar for the next anniversary event (roughly around June 2020) but they'll probably up it to 104%.
---
I mean we can use "it helps the dev" for EA to but given how big the playerbase is along with much micro bs there is and how small the team is means they raking in quite a bit of doe
---
Which again, would be fine in a f2p game.
---
Don’t mean to rain on any parades but check out the leaks sub right now, you’ll see that this isn’t the case.
---
Oh okay, so that means it’s okay to spam this annoying Tumblr-Girl cartoon everywhere.
---
True hahaha
---
I mean, I like the Spirit as a character. I just think there should be an indication when she is phasing but other than that I like her. I just think it would be very interesting to have her as a survivor.
---
If that meant we got some ancestor survivor that would be pretty cool
---
I like delivery boy, I’m doing this next time I play solo
---
Well I’m sorry I’m not making templates out of game models and handmade sculptures
---
I was getting downvoted and screamed at for saying you don't need to do 3  full gens start to finish. A lot of people here owe me an apology
---
You mean iaido?
---
But the worst part is... using this meme format
---
You'll lose gens even faster tunneling.  That's 3 survivors you're not pressuring at all that have nothing else to do other than repairing.  Tunneling is practically begging to be gen rushed off the map.
---
The devs have confirmed on the official forums that you just need to be on the gen when it's finished. You don't need to work on it 100% solo.
---
watched that loop like 8 times before I realized what was going on.....
---
I’m the killer 10/10
---
Low effort meme and a guy bitching about the game in the subreddit of the game who also doesnt even seem to have a user flair. 
---
You dont play the game do you?
---
You know that there is a reason that this community supports the devs like this right?
---
Dude wtf is your problem, you responded to me twice on two different comment threads about how much you hate this meme
---
Yeah well it looks like they'll just have a harder time completing it
---
New challenges don't really add anything to the game.  Same old game, just more behind the scene schmaltz.  Prove me wrong
---
Actually, this is really easy, all you need is to equip self care and heal, no matter who heals you, you or someone else
---
This seems likely, it also mentions about the mask and katana which is missing
---
First time we've built on the same killer though. Also this is still fresh OC whether it's her dad or an ancestor, not like it's another licensed killer
---
That's 30k in a 24 hour period. 70k ALL TIME HIGH. That's not that many, and I guarantee there's more people on pc than console. So that's sad. That's a yikes from me.
---
Pretty much, just really tedious. But at least there is a reward
---
Easy, so escape through gate have the gate glitch happen, fall off map and land next to hatch. Boom easy challenge 😅
---
&gt;I did the entire first Tome in one day, it wasn't easy, but there were exactly 3 challenges that couldn't physically be done in a single trial, for example, cleansing 8 totems. But overall, I'd say I completed 75% of them in a single attempt.
---
You just gave the perfect example why games become such a clusterfuck. People trying to rush the Tome Level in a single sitting instead of taking the 70 days to finish it by playing normally. 
---
Another problem is the fact that we can't do multiple challenges in the same match so either rush your objective so you can change ASAP or find yourself wasting time throughout multiple matches only to complete 1 challenge. 
---
&gt;But how many games will be ruined by someone camping basement to confirm the 2 hooks?
---
I am pretty sure you don't have to **kill** 2 survivors in the basement, just hook them. Why would it encourage camping?
---
Damn they’re adding Akuma to Dead By Daylight? And in Oni form too?
---
There is a flair that clearly says "shitpost/meme", can you not read?
---
And yeah because even though its EA lite there isnt a real alternative for people to go to.
---
Im a survivor main and even I think something needs to be done. I don't think a flat increase to the time it takes to complete a gen is the solution because that would just feel boring. I feel like this game really needs to introduce some new mechanic that survivors need to do other than gens. It would make the game more fun and more balanced.
---
Who is ger
---
that's not in level 2.
---
U are fast 😁
---
Good examples are trapper, wraith, doctor, LF, GF, and non-corrupt Plague
---
She is in pieces because the entity imbued her with power and it adapted to her condition to make her power, it's how any killer without a distinct ability/pre-existing technique eg the Trapper. It's also the reason the Wraith was given the Wailing Bell, he wanted Justice for that man but took it too far and the entity capitalized on his anger at himself and the ability to be better at tracking secrets, hence his ability to track survivors worked well and the Bell was used to get closer to them. As for the beginning of your sentence, I can understand why you'd think that but the entity can't stop time, it can only really manipulate and influence people drawbacks of lacking the power to enter 'our realm' with it's body as the devs once put it.
---
3 is a horrid idea man.  Allowing her to see blood would be beyond broken.  Have you ever used that addon before?  You could literally play her without sound and there's nothing they can do.  That addon is almost as broken as Prayer Beads it just isn't used nearly as often.  That's a hard no making that base kit
---
You too
---
Did you get healed by someone else? I think you only need to have the perk on, doesn't matter how you get healed.
---
ooooof. You think spirit is op? Y I K E S
---
O be some other name, what's in a name?
---
[Because.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/202/330/4b8.gif)
---
Please stop posting this. It’s getting super annoying now.
---
It can be seen as a better strategy to not use the fountain giving her access to her higher tier vomit that can actually injure and down.
---
 However, i just personally think it's debateable considering how loud and easily foundable you are when puking.
---
If youre running something like Resilience and other perks that help when injured maybe, but otherwise i would say risk it for the biscuit considering her upgraded power has a timer and she can start with a fountain already corrupted anyways so 🤷
---
Nope, Billy and Stu both seem hunting knives (and a gun). Also it's a single killer in Scream 3.
---
thats mommy
---
Hopefully the belt becomes a useable item in the game.
---
I’ll be sure to use it on myself if I end up in a game against Legion.
---
See one of Otz’s videos and check if you can find anything useful
---
Dude all I've seen you do is insult the size of the playerbase (which is reasonably large). You clearly think we are still back at launch
---
We don't talk about Scream 3 bud
---
Het father as a survivor and her mother as the next killer!!!!
---
Nurse, even though she still is more strong than spirit is more counterable than spirit because there are visual and audio cues for when she is using her power. Spirit doesn't give audio cues unless you're outside of her terror radius and the visual cues (glass shattering and hair animation resetting) can not be seen if she wears some cosmetics
---
Throw Iron Grasp in there and you've got a stew!
---
oh dang now I have to go watch it again
---
You kinda can interact with the phased spirit, she’s still present physically in the matter of speaking.
---
Oh that’s funny, thinking Kindred does anything when playing solo
---
I thought Rin made a deal with the entity to get revenge on her father? How will she do that now that he’s a killer?
---
1 it's a paid game that's mostly micro dlc
---
2 the "free currency" is grindy as hell to the point where if you play casually you might get enough shards for a single character by the end of the month. Assuming you dont spend any on the joke called a shire
---
Bro if I’m paying £7.50 for it it better take up the whole screen!
---
The one who doesn’t have DS.
---
Well I say that because as killer, all survivors will have DS. However as survivor, no fucker has it.
---
About to do this Challenge now...
---
Major bugs that i havent heard of in 1 1/2 years good job hUrr durr dis game 2 bugy 4 me i no play and make shitpost on redit comunity hurr durr &lt;3
---
Y’all seen the new teaser for chapter 14?
---
You can grab them from an exit gate when they think you let them go
---
ghostface isn't op, but he's very good. he's the only killer who can really constantly take advantage of 0TR in chase, which can throw survivors off especially at loops like shack
---
Truth. 
---
Doesn’t help that a lot of survivors have their messages sent to “Friends Only”.
---
If they waited long enough or readied up, the match would play out as usual, except there wouldn't be a killer.
---
I've seen the first Scream numerous time and neither one used a switchblade.
---
I'd suggest being able to meet in the middle. Creating a system that's a little more fair and balanced.
---
say a SWF group is made up of two rank 2s and two rank 18s. A middle rank opponent would make the most sense. Somewhere between 8-10. 
---
Not too skilled to obliterate the entire team, but didn't just download the game yesterday either. 
---
Some of my best games have been played at purple and green ranks. Anything red is just sweaty and straight up not a good time for me. But I feel bad having yellow opponents because they're so new, or unskilled. No one likes potato teammates or baby killers that chainsaw Billy into rocks :/
---
Mad grit &gt; Monstrous
---
No it's clearly lizzy
---
Oh shit I'm sorry
---
"Introducing decisive strike"
---
I'm excited that it looks like they'll be adding more to Yamaoka's as the realms with only one map come up way less and I'd like to see the themes more, but also that map is sort of ass so maybe I don't want to see the idea more?
---
I could've sworn he used a switchblade
---
Through an error, I saw two in the fourth level. 1) hook all four survivors in basement and 2) unhook three survivors during endgame collapse in a single trial. 
---
Nope, not joking, saw them last week. No idea how the second will ever be able to be accomplished, hope they change it.
---
Works fine for me, and I'm not even green ranks with survivor yet
---
Then amen, it's a bit better than I thought
---
gets hit with pallet
---
"NANI?!"
---
That's exactly what I thought
---
Sacrifice 7 seven survivors, 2 of them must be your obsession
---
Must be done during a single trial
---
god i love this victimhood mentality. hilarious
---
Are we better rewarded for the increased difficulty? I haven't been home yet to look
---
Already went over this. 
---
Dlc cheap? In dbd? Its like 10 bucks for a single outfit and like 7 per dlc character pack.
---
And again shards only buy a half of a dlc. The "60-70 for a dlc" is bs because it only comes with 1 part of it. If you want both halves that's double the matches. You know. Assuming your devotion doesnt reset on you making your grind even harder. Prestiging should be optional
---
I don't know, the Entity did promise her revenge against her father
---
That’s not a good thing. If you’re running into her then she’s just gonna unphase and hit you
---
A few things:
---
1. Nurse and Billy have dominated the meta for years and have been largely unchanged - in fact, both received buffs, with Nurse being able to blink to different elevations and with that also being able to short-blink despite holding a fully-charged blink, and Billy registering chainsaws on survivors at any point of them interacting with a dropped pallet.
---
2. There has not been a single killer in this game's history that was nerfed out of the high tier (we don't speak about pre-rework Legion, which was in an "anti-gameplay" tier of its own). Freddy has been buffed into it. Spirit has. Hag has. Huntress has had a change revised that would have made her significantly more difficult to do well with. Iridescent Head as well as a whole bunch of other add-ons that all elevate killers into high tier have not been nerfed. Moris are still the most game-changing item in the game.
---
3. When Nurse did finally recently get changed, it was not because of any sort of "complaining" or "community pressure". That's a pretty naive narrative. Nurse changes have been something that the devs had been "wanting to do" for years. And they had announced changes were in the making months and months before the eventual update too, unofficially even earlier.
---
4. Nurse is a broken design at her very core, but with time most people have simply accepted that fact. A really good Nurse player will basically never lose. But since really good Nurse players are rare, and mediocre/decent Nurse players not unbeatable and actually fairly fun to play against, complaints have mostly mellowed out over the years. There was a "recent" spark in controversy due to the popularization of stacking range add-ons, since they allowed even those mediocre/decent players to more or less easily dominate with Nurse, but that is also something that was at its peak long before the rework, and never constituted a collective outrage or pressuring of the devs either.
---
5. After the "rework", Nurse remains a broken design. Really good Nurse players will still barely ever lose. There have already been highly-competitive tournaments in which Nurse dominated just like she has in the past. There are things the devs could have done to actually address the fundamental flaws in her design, but they didn't.
---
6. Players of both roles have been concerned about Spirit pretty much ever since she got overbuffed after the PTB. Many might not remember, but not only could you reliably tell that she was phasing due to phasing noises in terror radius, but the phasing noises were also directional. Further, audio-tracking for Spirit was not nearly as precise as it is now, with her having loud chase music drowning out survivor noises during phasing, and general issues with the game's soundscape at the time. And finally her base values got buffed, without adjusting the add-ons accordingly. These are not recent concerns, Spirit has been in the game for more than a year now, and the reason BHVR themselves gave for their motivation to look at her now is that she is "overperforming".
---
7. Spirit has clear design flaws. Her gameplay is supposed to revolve around predicting, guessing, mindgaming. That's what people regularly bring up in her defense as well. Yet some of her mechanics currently outright contradict that design. In-Phase collision means that the player can - intentionally or accidentally - "feel" the survivor while using her ability. There is no guesswork involved whatsoever in using her ability this way. Audio-tracking similarly takes the thinking out of using her ability - if the player can simply tell where the survivor is by hearing them, they do not have to predict or mindgame them to catch them. Further, there is a lack of feedback for survivors to actually know when the "mindgame" part of her ability starts, making it less about mindgames and more just random guesses. Even without all of that, a lot of confrontations at the usual tile play of pallets and windows end up being more or less coinflips against Spirit, having to commit to one side of the tile and hoping she won't reappear on that same side. This would be less of a concern if Spirit weren't able to use her ability in short bursts over and over again, quickly turning the odds in her favour to end up close enough to get a hit, again with little thinking involved. Her add-ons exacerbate these issues.
---
8. The idea that Spirit is one of the very few killers that are able to do well in high ranks is ridiculously and demonstrably false. The statistical fact is that even the *least-deadly* killer character still kills 2 or more survivors in red ranks more often than not. Fact is that some killer characters are in the 70% kill rate range. Some players even beyond that. If the devs say Spirit is overperforming, I can't understand how people are still suggesting players are "entitled" to say the same thing - the reality is literally that Spirit is imbalanced, and changes are therefore justified.
---
9. More generally, I will never understand how so many players can have so little self-respect and ambitions to become a better player, just seemingly succumbing to the idea that they can never win and are overwhelmed and survivors are effortlessly beating them all the time, having apparently no issues whatsoever in admitting that they are a bad player. It is again a demonstrable fact that there are many, many players that play killer at red ranks on a daily basis, all around the world, hours upon hours on end, and barely ever lose, comfortably killing 3+ survivors 80+% of the time, absolutely without always using the strongest characters and strongest add-ons too. It is demonstrably true that one can become a good enough player to win the vast majority of their killer matches with even the weaker killers, without strong add-ons, without Moris... There have been demonstrations of players going on 4k-ing sprees without any perks, add-ons, offerings, using weaker killers. The global statistics also show that all killers at all ranks do better than survivors. So for people to say things along the lines of "survivors are unbeatably OP", which is not seldom around here, they have to be below average players.
---
10. That the core balance is tilted in survivor favour barely matters for public play, which are the overwhelming majority of actual matches that are being played, which again, see killers perform better than survivors on average. And then outside of the already killer-sided average, a good killer player wins far, far more games than they lose. I see this on killer streams all the time, to an extent where I get bored of watching because games are seldomly even close. And if they actually use the strongest killers and add-ons and let alone Moris, games are almost guaranteed to be 4-5gen 4ks.  I myself have only spent about half of my total playtime on killers, starting out as a killer main, and I also win more of my (red rank) killer games than I lose, despite regularly preferring to play weaker killers and even going out of my way not to tunnel or camp.
---
11. If I look at some figures that appear to frequently be in the middle of such killer-biased mentalities, and in this instance specifically, the player "tru3ta1ent", I wonder what they really want from this game. Looking at his VODs, it becomes immediately apparent that he wins the vast majority of his killer matches even while using lower-tier killers and gimmicky builds. And he is not even one of the people that camp and tunnel and slug as hard as really "tryhard" killer players do, nor regularly using the strongest perks, add-ons and Moris. To be frank, he isn't even one of the best killers out there either, there are better players. Is he basically saying he wants to win 99% of his games, instead of the 95% he does now? Even without using the strongest stuff? As long as we are not talking tournament DbD, much of the "survivors are OP" complaining I see seems to point mostly in two directions: bad players that want the game to accomodate them when it is already factually possible for plenty of players to dominate as killer consistently, or good players that are already only seldomly really challenged but apparently want the game to be even less challenging and more boring for them. (And if we are talking tournament DbD, tournament formats and rules can easily be adjusted to make up for any base game imbalances, "killer vs. survivor" balance is not a concern at all there.)
---
12. There are definitely problematic things left on the survivor side that should be addressed to an extent or another. A bunch of the lower-tier killers could totally do with a few buffs. Spirit should also still be strong after the changes, even similarly as strong as she is now, she should just yield more challenging and engaging gameplay. I think it is a good thing that the game is statistically killer-sided; I think the average survivor experience should be a struggle uphill. And since a group of 4 good survivor players will also win far more often than they lose, I think the game is in a pretty good state now where good players on both sides have the ability to win most of their matches, and the average game sees a killer kill 2 or more survivors more often than not. And in the rare cases where 4 good survivors face a good killer, the games can still be competitive.
---
he chose erotic asphyxiation for his double-homicide-suicide? that's how to go out
---
Nope, not in the first one at least. I can't speak for two or three because I haven't watched them quite as much but I can say for a fact that both Billy and Stu used a buck knife.
---
dumb question, I guess finishing the gen on duo didn't count, right?
---
People need to be punished for DCing, usually this happens if Ruin gets cleansed within the first 3 mins. This man had corrupt intervention as well.
---
Everyone doesn't seem to think of this for whatever reason but really all u gotta do is have a game where u let killers regress your gens and work on it again you dont even need to escape. So do a gen almost all the way start another one else wherr and hope the killer goes to kick it let it regress and go back to it. If they got pop even easier for you.
---
&gt; You can't denie it has nothing to do with the challenges
---
One absolutely can since the exact same things people are blaming on the rift are the exact same things people here have been whining about for years without the rift
---
It’s actually 900 points and totally worth it.
---
I love this
---
ah, a family reunion
---
Is it, though? Killers work for The Entity. We still have more to see about him. Will he be enslaved? Or will he escape? Will we play him doing anything for "one flower"?
---
Look up some Asian horror movies if you feel adventurous.
---
That was a hard deflection. Someone is butt hurt over a reasonable critique
---
Darn those people wanting a functional game daaarrrnnnn theeemmmm
---
The shrine can be pretty garbage but idk man I just don't agree that the DLCs are overpriced. 10 bucks every few months for a new chapter is far from unreasonable in my opinion, but you're welcome to disagree.
---
This post sucks shit though. The whole "haha why are y'all so TRIGGERED I was just giving my opinion" thing is so tiresome.
---
Sane  but I cant comment so I'm using this to comment...its really good!👍
---
I just had a game where ruin spawned in a wall. Very slow game man, 2 got out still because I haven’t played in a few weeks
---
The match started but it ended straight away as if someone disconnected. There was no killer information at all.
---
I mean, they're supposed to be at least somewhat challenging. And you don't have to do every one. I think most people on this sub are overblowing how bad they are. If you complain every 2 weeks about the new challenges, behavior is going to take the complaining less seriously, and **actual** very-hard challenges probably won't get changed. Stop crying wolf over challenges that you have literally months to try to complete.
---
I'm sorry, I thought it was balanced. i thank you for your feedback though. I will keep this in mind for the future.
---
They better change that cuz that's just stupid
---
Him as a survivor would be OK but him as a killer isn't
---
I really like this! Good job
---
You can cleanse in certain situations, but it usually is a bad thing.
---
The fountain is far away from gens or near completed gens.
---
Nobody is broken, so your teammates don’t have to get one shot by an uzi. They will have time to react to her having.
---
It’s the end of the match and the fountain isn’t too close to a gate.
---
go cry more sissy ass, all 80-90% of you fuckers on here just cry about wanting the game made more easier and convenient for you. shut up already and deal with it. getting every perk isn't a necessity kid, so your shitty argument is invalid
---
Outfits are expensive yes, but they are *literally just cosmetic* they are not needed to enjoy the game. And yes, 7 bucks for 2 characters is cheap, especially when they go 50% off at least once every few months
---
Thank you *honks*
---
I thought so aswell
---
Only 2?
---
what is it?
---
Each tome gives more BP than the last one
---
Having an excellent time as killer with Thana and Sloppy right now :)
---
I think there's a big difference between "counterable" and "balanced" and "fun". You can "counter" Balanced landing loops in Haddonfield as an regular killer if you chase them long enough that half the gens go away, or you can "counter" it by giving up on the chase whenever the survivor runs into those buildings. That butcher building infinite with long interior fences and side window open is also a "counterable" in the same way. Is it fair&amp;fun for killers? No, unless you are playing those few killers that have abilities to prevent it.
---
Spirit is the exact same in how she is "counterable". You can mindgame her, and you can juke her every so often (especially if she's far away). But Spirit's ability refreshes every 5-10 seconds if she's chasing you (you don't usually deplete the full gauge) so that is quickfire non-stop mindgames you have to play. Even if you juke her, her ability also serves as a gap-closer so she will immediately be on your ass unless you're in one of those maps with tons of LoS breakers, or unless you have a mix of Lithe/dance or QQ. Plus, the Spirit gets both visual and audio cues to locate survivors if they try to mindgame, so unless it's a particularly messy jungle gym, it's hard to get bamboozled much as Spirit. You can just start piecing the puzzle together once the scratchmark ends, and even if you make a mistake you'll be on their ass within seconds anyways. Many of us who play both survivors and killers can also abuse survivors' patterns/habits in trying to mindgame--most of them will show a tendency in game. You can kinda guess what they'll try to do once you know the maps/survivor gameplay anyways.
---
Anyhow, my hope is that **both Survivors and Spirit get nerfed**. Survivor nerf (either in gen progression or loops) will make most other underperforming killer more fun and viable in red ranks. As of now, mid-low tier killers in red ranks basically lose the moment they make a couple of mistakes. Also nerfing broken loops like Haddonfield BL spam would make it something you wouldnt wan't to insta-DC as killer. But Spirit, and maybe some nerfs to other tier 1 killers will be needed to make any respectable nerfs to survivor gameplay. Otherwise every game will turn into hatch game--as if it isn't pretty close to it already with decent Spirits. I think people need to understand that nerfs can and should happen on both sides.
---
Bruh you do gotta lvl up and max out perks to increase the chance of getting the one you want.
---
That’s exactly what I was thinking. Four in the basement in a trial? Hard but can be done. 
---
Three unhooked during endgame collapse? While not impossible it would be near so without coordinated SWF and a chill killer.
---
There not crazy difficult their just really tedious and make you play trapper which is annoying
---
They did. They were asked to wait while it's investigated. They're just impatient.
---
I wonder who the survivor is going to be.
---
GHOSTFACE slipping and falling on the ground is canon, so this only proves we got more accurate in the game!
---
Did you just find out about make-up?
---
get 20 gold emblems. situated at the start of the killer's challenges, creating a chokepoint. they should have had the fast challenges at the start, and the heavy ones at the ends
---
This is hilarious! I’m not toxic because u hid the entire game while the killer found me on gens or helping others escape hooka/chases. I’ll struggle to the very last second! It isn’t just 500 points either, it’s 883 😂 sure maybe it is not as many as you’d receive for escaping but I literally owe u nothing! U sound very selfish right now
---
You get what you FUCKING DESERVE!
---
How about.... dont play them... cross play is coming and you console players are gunna really suffer, devs should never done that.
---
Long ago in a distant Trial,   
---
I, Rin Yamaoka, the phase walking master of disconnects, unleashed an unspeakable evil.   
---
But, my foolish tired father, wielding the family sword, stepped forward to oppose me. Before the final blow was struck, the entity ripped open a portal in reality, and flung me into a new reality where its evil is law.   
---
Now, my father seeks to return to his daughter, and undo the future that is the Spirit
---
If Rin gets released as a survivor I’m absolutely maiming the shit out of her.
---
Does it only take gold, or gold and higher?
---
Yes I have and escaped them noed included. And when I said it's awful playing it's not impossible playing against it's just annoying with zero tr since I've gotten more done myself then ppl just running around doing nothing. Plus I've played ghost face walking backwards with zero tr so spinechill don't go off. Spirit I don't even have dead hard,MM,Bt,or DS. Plus you can see her coming it's not that hard with spinechill since she has to look where your scratch marks are coming from.
---
Do these work on KYF groups? Or with SWF?
---
And the pose already fits her Mori stance when she “teleports behind you”
---
The issue isn't having the opportunity to grab, is actually grabbing, it's so glitched.
---
Where is all this talk of the alchemist coming from? Haven't been on this sub too much lately, were they leaked or teased or is it just speculation?
---
lol I made a comment so that people wouldn’t say this
---
Aaah nothing over a good round basment trapper!
---
I keep one, just to remember...
---
All I’ll say is you’re a cunt and should go wrap a plastic bag round your face :)
---
I mean you can make a game last hours but you cant win.
---
what if xbox/ps4/switch match making pools were merged (so they can't be matchmade with pc players) and if you were to play SwF with a pc player you'd get matchmade with a pc killer
---
I deadass had to prestige my bill twice until I got self care on him.
---
This made me really mad bc he is my solo q main bc he has all my good gen rush perks.
---
This is what I’m saying! 
---
God crossplay is such a stupid decision and it makes balancing things even more hard lol.
---
Wasn’t that bad, definitely the weakest of the 4 but not all bad
---
Overall the perk doesn't do much. It ensures that there will always be an obsession in the game. Whoever unhooks somebody becomes the new obsession. If you can keep track of who is or isn't the obsession as they play roulette, you may want to run perks such as Dying Light, play with your food, I probably would not use Save The Best For Last. Or maybe that would work out pretty good. It's very situational. Most of the obsession parts require you either keep the obsession alive or get rid of the obsession sooner than the others.
---
No you can’t.  Trapper also has to spend a good portion of his time setting up these traps that only work in one specific area at a time, and can be disarmed by one of 4 survivors in the map.  Spirits power can be activated anytime during the match and brings this inability to react whenever she wants.
---
The community manager stated they uploaded the wrong version by mistake and it'll be fixed ASAP
---
I think something that might be worth noting is that with the archives they are starting to explore character stories in earnest, beyond simple biographies to give us some character flavour.  
---
At this point, past relationships might actually become relevant to the story, in which case it would be pretty neat to see some LGBT+ representation. Wouldn't you agree?
---
Continue the story!!! Did she make it??? :O
---
Looking like a very scary boi.

I only realized till it was too late that he looked like he was smiling.

i love it

Gold and higher
---
*misses attack*
---
THIS GUY IS SO OPTIMAL
---
What is this for?
---
Yeah I finished the teir one challenges but now I can't accept  any of the teir 2 ones and it is quite annoying
---
Welp console killers will be 360d all day, console huntress, nurses, demogorgon are all gunna lose horribly... console survivors are gunna die insanely easily to every killer.
---
Basically say bye bye to fun.
---
I got it in 6 games, its not that hard.
---
Hex: Dishonor
---
All survivor become Asian.
---
If a survivor fails a skill check, their gpa lowers by .01 and become exposed for the rest of the match.
---
“B+? Failure run in blood”
---
I agree that it is badly designed. I would be ok if it was cut in half but having to play 5 matches to finish it is dumb and that's IF you get 4 in every match
---
That goddamn cafeteria scene ruined it for me
---
[Video ](https://youtu.be/-1VkIJu-MRw)
---
you guys both are kind of... ugh.
---
both would deserve it.
---
And a monster with a flower for a face. This game has everything!
---
Yeah I have like 12 of them for my Ash still cause I stopped playing after that event
---
if they ever make an april fools update, i imagine like 10 stupid ass items being added, this being the first
---
Who’s would I stop mashing struggle. I need those sweet blood points!
---
Got I hope weird weeb magic makes rin split into a survivor and a killer
---
Was kind of hoping the mouth would shut at the very end
---
Oh yeah that was bad for sure but wasn’t that scream 2 with Mickey and mrs loomis
---
It's not hard but having a time sink that early on in the archives suck
---
yes because running right into the killer with a katana whos goal is to injure you is genius and will do wonders for you :)
---
There should be killer slowdown perks that make it more interactive. Perk that turns the skillcheck into a pendulum that swings across the bottom 2/3 of the meter, with the skillcheck zone slowly moving. You have to hit each time it passes by, or you lose a little progress, and missing entirely still acts as a failed skillcheck. Stops all the problems with Ruin, makes the activity more interesting, distracts the survivors from the killer's activities, and allows good survivors to be rewarded for being skilled.
---
How about no PC/console cross play... console players will literally suffer vs PC players. Yall have every statistical disadvantage... so if this goes through yall are fucked.
---
Pretty sure it was 3.... Could be wrong tho. Haven't seen them in a while
---
I’m becoming a Jeff main because of this
---
I’ll definitely check them out! Hoping to see you around here more often
---
My plan for this is Dark Sense, Open Handed, Bond, and Prove Thyself. It sounds like you only need to be on the gens as they finish, so I'll be scooting to find anyone who might have a chance of finishing a gen, and toolboxing my way through it.
---
I love him so much, his little pixels of hatred &lt;3

Bloodpoint economy hard on everyone lol
---
The only good thing about if pc and console are together is getting matches should be way quicker
---
Yes, the jumping over pallets is taken directly from fan made ghost face mock ups.
---
That being said most if not all of the killers are based on someone on some level.
---
You'll remember our venerable house
---
Have you considered not watching him? I am not very fond of his content or some other content creators so I simply don't watch them.
---
Even when I do choose to watch them, I won't make a thread complaining about how they are because I deliberately choose to watch it.

You’re talking about when sids boyfriend starts singing to her right? Because Mickey was in that scene lol

---
Link? I haven't been playing the past few months but it's caught my interest
---
i know that we would be fucked but i want to play with my PC friends ;-;
---
Yeah it did, you just have to be working in it while it completes
---
Depends on the kanji but its probably not significant. The most common way of writing it would pretty much mean "mountain hill."
---
It’s a good strategy if the pool is out of her way
---
Just get a PC?
---
She should definitely have an unphase timer longer than instantaneous
---
He must've had to go or something--
---
Escape without you and your teammates completing generators or using the hatch.
---
Ouch, that hurt
---
I actually got lucky getting both ruin and bbq and chili back to back in sprite bloodweb
---
The issue is it's very easy get two hits with the vomit, so it's best to never give them the opportunity.
---
DS/Head On/Saboteur/Deliverance with an Alex's Toolbox with the Saw and Cutting wire addons. Sabo hooks and get unhooks and watch as the killer just ends up slugging you bevause they just can't.
---
I understand it's a Jake perk. My Jake is P1 level 50.. he just doesn't have iron Will tier 3 on him and I main Tapp.
---
You missed the entire fucking point lol 
---
34 seconds was the average. How long do you think you should be able to run the killer in average, in order for a balanced game?
---
The effort here is so low, it wouldn't even make it on the Arkansas football team.
---
Camping at endgame is allowed especially on hooked survivors
---
Lmao, He either has had a really shit day or is just another toxic person that doesn't feel like playing if things don't go their way LoL
---
But think about all the sick montages you can send to Ochido /s
---
I've been getting tunnled a lot lately.
---
By that, I also mean my teammates unhook near the killer and refuse to try and take a hit for me.
---
:^]
---
fat
---
Jeez, did the post personally attack you ?
---
Who the fuck wants to use distressing, like the agitation thing is possible because Agitation allows you to do things you couldn't but fucking distressing, wish you could do more challenges in one game tho
---
I'm just laughing at the Otz circlejerk :)
---
A good survivor should be able to run the killer for more than 34 seconds. Not a lucky survivor
---
&gt;I think a dbd youtuber said it. I'm not sure which one though. Sorry
---
nice source, lol
---
I see what you mean but ~~in my opinion~~ *****NO*****
---
I would say give swf a repair debuff maybe 10%. The advantages that swf have over killers really aren't fair especially to average killers.
---
#MAYBE
---
Its a question. If you dont care, dont reply.
---
I feel like it could be an alternate costume? Like how the legion has a male and female model, but i’m honestly not sure. And it would come out alongside the Spirit rework.
---
If your gona make bait at least put a little effort into it
---
Yeah I've progressed all killer up to clown coming out to either p3 or p2 level 50 and had all perks for billy,nurse,myers, and huntress. Havent barely messed with killers other then billy and spirit on console.
---
They don't call him "chuckles" for nothing.
---
Keep healing yall
---
Escape the trial as Sidney Prescott after the End Game Collapse. 
---
Must be completed in a single trial
---
Me?
---
They should be able to run an equally good killer for more than 34 seconds? How long? Give me a number. What's fair? 45 seconds? 60? What should the average be??
---
Me too! Check my post history.
---
What time sink? You’ll be playing those games anyway lol
---
A lot of these challenges are broken atm, don’t tell anyone.
---
I used a medkit for the “deplete 6 medkits” and it counted as 3
---
This’ll be a pleasant family reunion...
---
I’ve seen people claim it worked just being on a gen, and others that say it hasn’t.
---
With the Dev’s clarification on the forums, I’d more put it as “if it didn’t work, it’s bugged” rather than needing to 100% a gen completely.
---
We’ll see though. I’m hopeful that it’s “be on a gen as it completes.”
---
‘PERHAPS’
---
I literally notice no difference. I play with other Rank 10s, who were Rank 1's yesterday.
---
The thing is that it doesnt have to be a good spirit to quickly end a chase. She is easy to play
---
Most of 9GAG fucking hate it for being popular.
---
True but it is still a sink. Other challenges are much quicker then that.
---
Possibly?
---
It's the same on PC
---
Doesnt the trailer for the spirit also show that adam went to rin's house and she jumpscared him grudge-style?
---
Also kate playing guitar in the woods and clown spying on her
---
And I think that Jane did a story on the plagues era or something similar
---
My issue with your play style is there is no real gain for doing the challenges asap. While I am not dictating to you to not play that way, I feel as if you're removing a fun part of the game for yourself in a dumb way. What I mean is that nothing you gain from rift or tomes is anything outside of cosmetics. I too like the cosmetics, but to force myself to play a certain way just to have something I would get through natural play anyways is boring. I like the rift and tomes because having the challenges gives me a new reason to play and potentially adjust my play style a little bit, but not too much. For me, the rift and tomes make the game more fun and because there is no actual gain from rushing it all, you might not enjoy what BHVR has added as much as someone like me. I do hope you still enjoy playing the game, though. The last thing this game needs is for the playerbase to stop playing. See you in the fog friend.
---
I'm not a fan of his either but this is entirely unnecessary to make a thread about.
---
I definitely like the idea of a perk that rewards you for doing totems.
---
Honestly I would love to see a 2-killer glitch which is just RinDad and Spirit slashing each other for the whole game, only hitting survivors to get them to not interrupt their battle.
---
So easy to play =  OP?!?
---
Because this forum is full of fucking crybabies who force their pet crybaby issue into everything
---
It’s the same situation as with the This Is Happening quest, though.  You don’t actually have to use the self-care ability.  The way this quest actually works is “[Heal 2 health states] [with Self-care equipped]” not “[Heal 2 health states *using* self-care]”
---
Thank god I'm not the only one that read it like that
---
You get less points for pips but I do agree something else needs to happen
---
nice
---
P.A.R.T why? Because I gotta!
---
• stacks 
---
Everyone runs it so the killer can see the obsessions aura for 16 seconds.
---
Oni killleeerrr &lt;3
---
I would like the first perk but take away the obsession part
---
You are drastically overestimating the effects of cross play
---
See how blood is regressing? Possible Rin survivor?
---
No that's not what I said
---
Easy to play+hard to counter=OP
---
I did it solo after rank reset, just ignore your teammates and pick engineer toolbox + new part, took me 2 matches.
---
I watched the scream movies this Halloween and I think they were trying to be completely true to the character design from the original 90s movies. This costume is exactly identical to how Ghostface is portrayed in the OG Scream trilogy, arm flaps and all.
---
How do I get to this quiz?
---
This.
---
Probably not.
---
&gt; You'll throw digs at them even then! I've seen your comments!
---
Aw shucks I'm flattered. No no please.. no pictures. 
---
But seriously, I would actually compliment them on finally giving priority to important game issues. But since I feel they are first, second, and third about the money and dead last about improving the game, I'd sooner expect to see a vegetarian at Burger King than see the devs put game health over monetization.
---
&gt; Explain why having chests be locked, and requiring a dull key to open is a good idea!
---
Already did in that thread. Chests would be buffed in that more things would be in them, and nerfed in that they need keys to open. More rewarding for survivors, and for killers it can slow the game down a little more. See moronic devs.. *that's* what's called "balance". Nerfing something and not giving anything back is just called a straight nerf and that's why I always call you out when you decide to "balance" something.
---
&gt; Explain why you have a bias towards killer!
---
Well it's by far the more skill based side in the game, and since I'm ultra competitive I want to dominate matches by outplaying the other side without the devs nerfing the other side or comms to help me. 
---
However I do have some respect for solo survivors as they are often shafted and I have made many suggestions to buff them. SWFs though.. pfft. Most of them are low skilled and not respected by me. Without their precious comms they would be a road apple to any decent killer main. Their ideas for balance is the last that the devs should take since they aren't good enough to make it to red ranks as a solo player. I respect skilled players or those who are working to increase their skill. Those who want the devs to nerf the other side just because they themselves are skilled are the survivors I want to kill non-stop 24/7 in the game.
---
&gt; EXPLAIN WHY YOU THINK KILLERS HAVING PERKS THAT NEGATE SURVIVOR ABILITIES ARE FAIR, BUT SURVIVOR PERKS THAT NEGATE KILLER ABILITIES AREN'T!
---
Hmm, you'd have to refresh my memory about me saying the above. I always argue that if survivors can have perks for certain things, then killers should as well. And that since no survivor perk helps the killer (and there is no survivor perk which helps the killer) then why the fuck do they create killer perks which help survivors, mainly the drawbacks of their bullshit obsession perks for killers.
---
As soon as I see DS reworded to "If you successfully stun the killer with DS, the killer becomes immune to all pallet stuns for the rest of the trial." I'll shut up about the idiot devs' choices for obsession perks. But they'll never give survivors such a drawback with their perks. Nah.. such things are only for killer obsession perks, amiright devs?
---
That good idea it super terrifying where the picture from.
---
I had to do a pointillism assignment in art too and it was so fun, yours looks amazing! I love the sepia tones.
---
Even if you play more than like 2 or 3 I am with you in the sense that we should chill and play the game. I feel like sometimes people take this like an esports game where they are risking like real-life stakes on a win. And again, everything in rift is cosmetic so theres no reason to rush. Im going to make the tome last so I have something to enjoy doing while we wait for more.
---
"I do not like something for it offends me, therefore no one else should like that thing."
---
- u/Red_Sincosite
---
That’s my boy
---
What a fascinating comment. Say more fascinating things
---
You crashed that's it. Games been buggy lately. Seen so many posts about being kicked out mid game. Has happened to me before as well
---
Mhm trippy boy
---
Yup, it's time to run that no mither build
---
I use both, personally I experience A LOT more on ps4 than pc but that can just be my experience
---
Good point.  We really need to stop using that term since they aren't a thing anymore.
---
Another spirit. Yeah that's totally what we survivors facking need.
---
This would be way funnier with sound from the original clip.
---
"SPIRIT 2!"
---
*Silence*
---
legion is a good killer
---
&gt;!oh!&lt;
---
You are the Bojack Horseman of dbd.
---
This is Happening worked the same way.  You just needed to hit greats while the perk was equipped, it didn’t matter if you were injured for the perk to activate when you did it.
---
if it's gold or higher that's not so bad. I get at least a gold emblem every game I play
---
And yet you refuse to answer my question.
---
Forget the spirit. If you have a highly skilled killer (any of them) and a highly skilled survivor, how long should an average chase take? Assuming the survivor is at full health.
---
I honestly think 34 is a pretty fair number lol
---
supposedly a dev said you can actually just be on the gen when it finishes and that will count. but I havent tried yet. the wording is unclear.
---
But there are plenty of instances where it's useful. What I'm wondering is what changed recently? Why haven't people always thought it was useless?
---
Not op
---
I think rins father will be a killer based around the oni. He will probably be called the demon, if not something in that area. my guess is he is going to have powers dealing with blood. I pray to god it’s not another teleportation killer, I hope he has a really cool and unique feature, especially since they are probably not gonna add a map for this chapter. Maybe he could hide in lockers?
---
When your father ain't done beating you just yet.
---
I already said they would never do it because they don't give drawbacks to survivor perks, just killer perks.
---
See what I said about to you is unfathomable right? Yet killers have a "reworked" perk (Dying Light) which gives a survivor a 33% increase action speed in addition to that survivor being immune from the effects of the perk itself AND if that survivor dies then the killer's perk is disabled. But that doesn't sound ridiculous to you right? The DS one did, but not Dying Light. Dying Light, a killer perk, helping out a survivor for ALL of the trial is fine, but a survivor's perk helping out the killer isn't "balanced".
---
Gotcha. I think I've made my point here.
---
This lore is literally as old as the spirit is. Where did you think the father theories were coming from?
---
challenges shouldn't require SWF or rely on the player's teammates to be awful or sabotaging the game.
---
On the real though, those Samination parodies just keep getting better and better.
---
Getting to listen to no0b3 and Cahlaflour argue in the latest one was cute too.
---
Just because the new killer is Japanese doesn't mean the two are the same.
---
Oh god oh fuck my opinion was invalidated oh shit what am I gonna do oh fuck oh shit /s
---
Hooks survivor
---
“HINJAKU!”
---
maybe
---
The chase times should vary from killer to killer because some killers have powers that help them in chases and some give other advantages. 
---
Idk a number but freddy is a good example imo. He has a good ability that helps him in chase but has counter play in the fact that survivors can SEE THE DAMN KILLER and avoid his traps
---
Opulent and Imperial. Gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the moor.
---
I use urban evasion, spine chill, balanced landing and iron will
---
When you use your ability its bugged and his robe is stuck. Needs fixing
---
It was supposed to have been patched, I got this last night accidentally. I was scared of getting banned for it so I made sure I recorded it
---
Please no, the first candidate for ''the killer is also a survivor!!!'' should be Benedict Baker, not Waluigi
---
so do we blame BHVR or Sony for this 🤔
---
Probably just will be laggy
---
It really does and it's sad tbh, cause I love it. Hopefully they fix the physics asap. People need to complain to them a lot so they notice cause otherwise they'll probably just ignore the situation.
---
I don't recall. I will check when I get home.
---
Well it is hinted to be a ghost, and if not a ghost definitely some undead. Been there, done that. If it's just some random *living* killer that so happens to be a Samurai, they better pull some really good lore, or else it'll feel like a bad For Honor collab.
---
You can just use a medkit instead without wasting a perk (green medkit is fast as fuck now), or use stuff like Inner Strenght which will easily heal you over 8 seconds in a locker.
---
True. They actually tend to do the opposite. For example, Plague is the oldest killer in the game, while Jane is the most "modern" survivor.
---
?
---
Do the devs actually play their own game to think most of these are achievable?
---
Pig was far from broken, they nerfed the fuck outta her
---
Just do these challenges while farming if it bothers you that much, I don't want to play killer now so I let people farm each game while I also do my challenge.
---
Use it right, don’t do it instead of grabbing a teammate from a hook and healing eachother, but heal during downtime, when nothing is going on. It’s my favorite perk in the game and I struggle to not run it because of how amazing it is.
---
This trailer could be showing that the entity has the ability to turn back time/go to a different dimension where instead of rin becoming the killer her father does and in turn making her the survivor!
---
I use the top with a different hairstyle, am I toxic? 😂
---
K well no number so I'm out lol have a nice night!
---
Why cant you accept it?
---
Is the Switch's shrine different? BBQ was just on PC's shrine like 2 weeks ago.
---
Doubt they’ll ever get the license for Scream, don’t think we ever will :/
---
I did it on a first try. all it cost me was my team dying in the basement
---
link?
---
Lol it never got the chance to camp
---
I'm talking power wise, lore means nothing in the grand scheme of things due to people just caring about if the killer is good or not (or great to fuck over or not).
---
Aww man my feelings! I was having so much fun talking to a whiney person on the internet! Damn I guess I have to go have fun now
---
You can equip a medkit to get the achieve. 
---
Self-Care DOES have a secondary effect that improves the efficiency of your healing item by x%.
---
Blind twice? Easy.
---
Blind twice WHILE CARRYING? Not easy.
---
This. I don’t see why the father would be chosen anyway. He was already deemed to not have as much rage as Rin which to me would make him a lesser killer lacking passion.
---
Quite possibly. No one on Switch has it thus far to my knowledge.
---
Damn. Though I don’t think I’ve got that on him either
---
Because it was better awhile back. The only time it's useful is with baby killers. Since it was nerfed it really is a waste of time especially in higher ranks.
---
Keep complaining and we will get spirit 3
---
even on low settings?
---
I completed it first try. I’m not sure exactly how but i didn’t do any gens alone.
---
My slightly increase chance to go to haddonfield worked too
---
It'll definitely run, but your friend will most likely be looking at around 25-30 fps on low settings. If they're okay with that go for it!
---
...............is it your first time?
---
Yeah but if it in the corner of the map, she has to talk all the way there and then back to start a chase. You even get a sound notification to tell you to become a bush.
---
Why does he look fat there 😂
---
Demon embrace incoming.
---
Not at all actually
---
A small price to pay for looking cool
---
Convince BHVR to buff you. Must be done as The Pig.
---
Yeah, people always think Self-Care is a bad perk because it's so slow but they don't actually realize it helps you get more heals out of medkits.
---
That's literally how this subreddit works
---
Yea this sucks so much, killer deff depipped too. I dunno if it does anything but I report every dc at end of game and hope they’ll get what they deserve
---
That's the point. I'd take the ivis over the 15 seconds. I'd even make it so that he loses the speed when uncloaking and doesn't get undetectable at all for the invis. It's annoying to have an invisible killer that isn't invisible
---
oh ok, thank you
---
I saw it while browsing Instagram, there's lots of content there for ideas. But this one just struck me.
---
Figured thanks 👍
---
Have you ever been in a situation where there are two people, you (slugged) and your friend who got spotted, I was on the ground for the whole bleed out timer while my friend ran the killer for the whole time. This kind of slugging would be solved by this system. It would also give slugs a sense of hope. You could still slug for pressure but not forever, y’know? (Obviously the numbers would have to be changed, and instead of a skill check maybe a small chance with a min and max numbers of attempts before escape.
---
My hope is the Dark Sense one is broken.
---
I only play solo survivor as well and i think 90% of the killers in this game are weak.
---
Ok? I wasn't talking about gameplay. Nobody is thinking this is the Spirit 2.0 in terms of abilities. It does appear to be the same in terms of lore and theme though, even sharing the same map as the spirit. That being said, I'm *sleep*. This is like adding another hillbilly who so happens to be his dad, has a scarecrow costume and runs around with an even bigger chainsaw/axe.
---
It depends on the person. Some days I have good matches and others nothing but tunneling campers. Just because it hasn't happened to you doesn't mean it hasn't to others
---
It’s sadly overused
---
 Mori in the basement? Toxic lol 
---
/s
---
THANK YOU I was so disappointed the other guy wasn't singing this one
---
Nah been playing for a little while now, about half a year. This one seems to be worse than the other ones
---
I get that alot
---
I love the cat name. Really creative
---
Being rude isn't celebrating.
---
20 gold emblems is not hard to do. (Esp. after rank reset \^\^)
---
You don't need to finish this chapter in a day, last time I was done after a huge DbD binge and twiddled my thumbs for the two weeks slowly crawling through the rift tiers with normal xp.
---
Probably because of the archives
---
BTW, I only touched/ completed 3 gens. Also equipped prove thyself for this.
---
1- gen slightly touched, completed it with some help.
---
2- gen from scratch but got help 25% in
---
3- gen halfway done, finished it with someone.
---
It doesn’t say complete it alone. It’s doable
---
So....... I want to make sure I'm seeing this right
---
The person that
---
Brutally murdered his wife
---
Brutally murdered his daughter
---
Has no remorse whatsoever
---
Would most likely do it again
---
Is getting added as killer the same team as the person he murdered and the entity promised revenge to 
---
Dang why did the entity have to do rin like that
---
I died with a medkit and counted 1 out of 6 i didnt use the medkit all the trial, anyone else?
---
Blood Warden my guy. Run that with NOED and teach those teabagging shits the meaning of fear.
---
I feel like this problem is not being talked about enough (or maybe I’m just not seeing it).
---
My girlfriend is having the same issue, she’s got a bit further down the challenges, but the rewards can’t be claimed for the one that was just completed, nor can any new ones be started. 
---
It sucks that there are some people who can’t continue with these Challenges for some extra Bloodpoints and Rift progress.
---
So when they say this I'm assuming they're needing spirit again or something? I've followed this loosely but have kept up as of latley.
---
I'd also like to play Rin as a Survivor...... Forever caught between two roles.
---
I Think it's a ancestor of rin's.
---
We need more Asian based urban legends in this game basically.
---
The aswang would look horrifying. So would the pontianak.
---
I can’t say I’ve ever encountered this playing on PC. Have you been able to replicate it?
---
Some of them seem obnoxiously hard, especially the ones in the 4th tome. Like, to the point where it'll come down to luck rather than skill, and that just straight up isn't fair.
---
I’ve had that happen to me before. People thought I was a psychopath who got back to Rank 1 in one day.
---
This is a fake tweet I made dude, LMAO.
---
Look at the Flair "Shitpost/Meme", this is supposed to be a joke tweet to be the same as the tweet they made about the new killer trailer, revealed to be Spirit's father.
---
Good
---
I got asked how I was in reds when I was running urban. I simply said cause I'm solo lol. People who play solo usually have very different perks than a swf group.
---
It *could* be her mother but in the Spirits story she got gutted. It is possible for the entity to grab her but I doubt they would bring the spirits whole family and the spirit killing her mother would be very odd. Killing herself though could make sense because maybe she is jealous that the other her is not cut to pieces or maybe shes in disbelief and ignores it.
---
There may also even be a "we used the Rin to destroy the Rin" for a toxic survivor vs toxic killer game
---
So glad I didn't buy the pass!
---
Don’t be scared to reach out for help if you need it! My DMs are open if you’d prefer a stranger to vent to, but it’s always good to let people close to you know that you’re struggling. I hope things start looking up for you. :)
---
Its grey fox, kojima has created death stranding just to distract us.
---
yeah actually what the fuck
---
You’re wrong. You have to fully repair it.
---
Especially when other survivors trying to do the same challenge xD
---
Not really. The AoE for the bottles isn't big enough to keep someone from unhooking, and if you're close enough for the bottle to hit, you're close enough to just stop the unhook.
---
Might have just been a Clown with the sacrifice daily, and they were doing whatever they could.
---
What’s wrong here?
---
A direct denial of sexiness.
---
He never used a switchblade in the movies
---
Dude like chill criticizing a play just because the person teabaged for second is kinda ridiculous, I can’t imagine that you’ve never teabagged a killer even for such a tiny reason before.
---
Oh shit my bad. Just looked at the picture and didnt really pay attention to anything else. I guess it pays off to pay attention to all the details lol
---
I really hope it’s not an actual demon
---
you can’t play mind games with people who don’t have minds like you and just play a braindead killer
---
Even better the “guy pointing at the mirror” ‘found the fucker who’s been ruining my life’ template for survivor rin’s who die to Spirit.
---
I think the devs were afraid of overtuning Demo's abilities with add-ons and also wanted to keep the base ability kit at a strong-enough level without add-ons. And lazy, not wanting to deal with add-on balancing.
---
The add-ons could definitely do with buffs though, many of them are much too modest. I'm not sure I would really want more add-ons that change Shred mechanics such as increasing Shred range and such, but most of the other add-ons could also easily be more impactful than they are now. The add-ons that apply status effects upon coming into contact with portals for instance should be way more punishing, since coming into contact with a portal can be easily avoided much of the time. Lifeguard Whistle for example should put survivors on 30 or more seconds of Exhaustion, rather than a mere 5 (albeit on a flat timer, still counting down while running, like all Exhaustion-causing add-ons should). Leprose Lichen should just reveal all survivor auras period. Upside Down Resin should do something like injure survivors if they cleanse a portal. The add-ons that do change Shred specifics could also be a little more neat, with Mew's Guts and Black Heart maybe applying to the cooldown on breaking pallets as well, and maybe another add-on to increase movement speed while charging Shred.
---
Ever since the Trapper and Wraith add-on reworks, BHVR have definitely been lazy and uninventive when it comes to creating worthwhile add-on sets. Legion has terrible add-ons now. The Nurse add-on rework was a little more inspired again, at least. But I doubt we'll see Demo add-ons be touched any time soon, if ever.
---
I've read all your replies and I'm not saying you're wrong, different playstyles and all
---
I'm just saying that for me personally I'd rather use that perk slot for bond, have team mates heal me instead in half the time + now I have x-ray vision on my team. 
---
(Also I'm sorry for all the small-brain survivors who have traumatized you with their failed skill checks)
---
Except that they have little to do with skill and more to do with luck, seriously. Only the absolute best players will even come close to completing them. They're basically telling everyone else, 
---
"Hey, you wanna know more 'bout the lore of the game and get a cool charm? Well guess what champ, that ain't fuckin' happening!"
---
hes joking that the mask and knife arent that different
---
I’ve done the challenge. It doesn’t
---
i haven't tried, but i doubt i'd be able to
---
What the fuck are you talking about? You literally can’t play against console players
---
It looks soooo much better being completely clean
---
Legit expecting when Tome IV drops to have all 3 survivors stand still, get downed, hooked, then unhooked by their friend who needs the challenge.
---
Expect someone to be in the Killer Shack making noise, then they get downed and suddenly 2 survivors with flashlights come out and blind the killer
---
I'm not upset, and I'm not sure why you'd think I am. I just don't want people to be rude when other people are just playing a game.
---
I was wrong about the body types, I thought they all had the same models but I think I mixed that up with the killers (?) or maybe another game? I remember reading something about how the stranger things chapter was really time consuming because they had to make a new model for demogorgon, so I guess I got that idea from there. 
---
Yeah Overwatch has LGBT+ characters but I don’t think they are described as such in certain countries due to political reasons, not that that matters though cause dbd could do the same thing in theory. 
---
tl;dr: didnt know that, u right
---
what about dead ard
---
You only need to be on it when it finishes
---
You have to get to the epilogue of Tome 1 at least
---
Also lol at thinking console players don’t have the movement to dodge shred and hatchets or look behind them holy fucking shit
---
See that’s how I feel about those challenges. 
---
Everyone take some look at it whines and says impossible but I don’t think they’ve tried it yet. 
---
Some challenges seem a bit much and I’m mostly talking about the killer ones.
---
This is so funny thank you
---
The cross platform test they did literally a week ago.
---
Only 1000 players were allowed but it happened, you didnt get in?
---
I have like 65 on Hag. I bust one out every week.
---
I stabbed the first survivor of the game, an Adam I believe. DC'd immediately and basically ensured the rest of the team got the max amount of points we could get without his sorry ass.
---
For real??
---
Each map only has a few tiles that the hatch can spawn in, and usually in set locations. Some maps even have weight to where the hatch spawns. If the survivor knows the map, they can just stay near one of these spots and get an easy escape when they're alone.
---
Do a pretty good job so far.
---
Must be completed in a single match.
---
I don't know dude.  All I know for sure is I'll never finish all of the Tier 4 challenges
---
ironically it was my first game naturally, but a lot of people are still going to be pricks about it
---
The dev's are probably gonna pull a 180 and make the mother the killer and the father the survivor
---
Important factors at high lvl play and controller really hurts it.
---
Sure rank 20s like you might not notice a difference but rank 1 console players are gunna derank really quick
---
I wouldn't be surprised, since they don't all work properly / the wording is unclear. The self-care one doesn't actually require you to heal yourself, for example.
---
...that is not a thing that ever happened
---
archive stays, rift is gone
---
I did too, but switched it off because of Destiny 2 and OverWatch. 
---
I still get the occasional killer/survivor salt, but I’ve grouped up with so many survivors after a killer match that I can’t go back lol.  Xbox here, I feel like once you hit the purple ranks people don’t waste time typing messages out unless you do something really heinous.
---
Um....
---
Yah I like these certain picture because their pretty cool and I’m trying to look for the lore behind the mask in the new chapter 14 trail I’m looking to see if has any meaning in culture thanks.
---
It’s not the same as pc, way less.
---
Clown milk?
---
I understand you dont need to kill them, but how many insidious leathers are going to be popping up for this?
---
Genuinely when I first started playing I thought a few killers were unfair but now I know what I'm doing my opinions changed. I think I only thought killers seemed unfair because like me at that time my teammates were dogshit haha.
---
What surprise me, is that people who complain about nurse ans now spirit still dont get it, that they play against same killer over and over again not because player who play it likes it a lot, but because he forced to do so if we talking about red rank games. I hate Spirit but i forced to play her because any other killer suck so bad vs good SWF
---
Sorry, i just assumed when you said console
---
Imagine taking a video game this seriously
---
Shit is going to end up ruining the game
---
I found out the hard way... How was this allowed??
---
i was there.... i was there
---
He plays builds people give him so theres that
---
And true gives you tips on now to beat the killer while playing killer
---
Need og photo in exchange for an up vote
---
But all SWF suck against a good killer player.
---
I just cant get into his videos
---
They just need to remove the cooldown so it'll have real utility again.
---
Solely the fact that they're related. While thematically, it would make sense for them to share something, I'd hope it's only visual and not gameplay.
---
Probably leaker Trapper cosmetic. Looks cool but he should have traps set up
---
Spirit has a skin where she wears a dress that has a similar problem to this. They should really make it so you don't see these flappy bits of skins in 1st person.
---
Because of your reaction to it.
---
If you have to resort to yelling about rank, you have nothing. I play both sides at red, btw, which is utterly irrelevant but you had to bring it up because you have nothing
---
I know your joking but with two spirits we can have two clowns boom penny wise
---
Freddy sees nothing wrong with a few children showing up in the Trials :)
---
**Mori's self**
---
She still has non working add ons
---
it's gotta be the umibozu
---
I wish I could read
---
Same!
---
Certainly hope you reported in post-game, and then put in a support ticket on the official site.
---
wholesome 100 eplic
---
if it's going backwards wouldn't that be Mandom? GER doesn't reverse time it returns to zero and Mandom reverses time 6 seconds
---
Just take a medkit
---
Thank you, I appreciate it!
---
BBQ bad
---
I know he will probably have a katana, but I *really* hope he has a kanabo.
---
I think I know what I’ll start calling him...
---
This can go in the sbubby sub reddit whatever its called
---
Who does that make the survivor?
---
Me preferring spirit or him preferring gore are just opinions. People are kinda stupid for downvoting opinions imo.
---
That would be pretty much like the Demogorgon ...
---
Let's keep this out of gaming
---
The Key
---
I always kill and slug them just so i still get the slowdown and pressure of a hook but im not being an asshole tunneler.
---
Hey, at least he died having never seen the impact his work would leave on the world. I mean, if you had to ask for someone to be punished for their beliefs, you can't really get worse than that.
---
Ore wa ochinchin ga daisuki nandayo
---
What about when you can't relax because your puking could give away your location every ten seconds?
---
TydeTyme looks different.
---
Zoom in bro
---
They have the devil mask already, so...
---
Breitbart LUL you know literally nothing about me and you assume I’m a conservative just because I disagree with you.  I’ll share some YouTube links of Antifa instead, oh and how about that recent nontroversity with that drumming Native American at that university?  Literally everyone and there mother believed it was the student harassing the Native American but it was 100% the opposite. Here’s one recent example of an antifa riot in Portland:
---
https://youtu.be/yEiHgJItZws
---
Her clan what now?
---
I get it pretty consistently when the situation arises. It's just most people that are decent don't do slow or medium vaults when the killer is up their butt crack.
---
Unironically love the idea of Spirits father fucking up so bad his pisses of two ghosts
---
The only good killer left is Spirit. Billy, Nurse and Freddy also not bad, but only Spirit is in S tier right now
---
Ice cold
---
Its really annoying bruh
---
Doesn’t she have an add on where she can see auras when they puke?
---
His brother, Hanzo, of course. Can't have one without the other. Nothing says family bonding like two family members trying to kill each other... *cough* Spirit (and dad?). *cough*
---
Lol I knew someone was gonna bring up that guy.
---
Ps4 has way less? I have a completely different experience to that
---
I guess it makes it a little easier considering "blinding killer while carrying survivor" is totally different from "get a flashlight save". Cant tell you how many times I got the killer blind, but not the save.
---
If someone didn’t finish the first tome, are they still able to finish it? Or are they locked out now?
---
The Entity probably
---
Brenda should come to the game only when we get the girl from The Ring in.
---
THIS BITCH IS MESSIN UP MY FLOOR!
---
Yeah, I always have mixed feelings on 'pandering'. On the one hand, yay Tracer Overwatch is gay. On the other hand, Blizzard is a toothless company that would only ever commit to a gay character if they were sure it would bring in $$$ in return for minimal effort. I'm finally seen and acknowledged and all it cost was the commodification of my identity, or something.  
---
I think in the case of this survery, having a non-binary option isn't even a matter of pandering or representation though. It's literally just acknowledging how people choose to identify themselves and is going to be increasingly important in demographic research.
---
Like, if for whatever reason BHVR went on to discover that somehow 90% of the player base is non-binary, hells yeah they would add a non-binary character - and that would be pretty cool!
---
But I'm just rambling at this point.
---
That depends on the hairstyle you use
---
I play both sides equally. When I'm survivor and I see teammates self caring I frown and when I'm killer and i see survivors self caring I smile.
---
