My bad, I thought they reset. Thanks

The pigs leathers weapon looks like she should be hunting templars
---
Sick of disagreeing at this point. Great idea, much wow.
---
Being in suspension for a "lot longer" does that to you.
---
I'll do you one even better. You can change the red stripe to [this](https://i.redd.it/xoskfvhn60y21.png) instead with the original mask equipped.

---
It's gunna look straight badass.
---
Gremlins?
---
Everyone dodges when they see my P3 tapp so I have to switch at last second which gets me tunneled
---
its the same every week...
---
I was doing a daily for hag with the teleport hits and a surv caught on and gave them to me at the end gate
---
Honestly, that “thank you” or “good looking out” fells so rewarding. Even though it really happens 2/10 times.
---
Until you meet someone with the trapper
---
Umesh
---
If you consider playing this game entertaining, sure.
---
You know too much about me...but I've played nurse on ps4...I cried on the inside. The frames, the slowest turns, it's just so bad. That's why I stick to playing her on pc now.
---
Is the hate against Franklin's a relatively new thing, or have I just avoided it up until this point? In the past I've always used Franklin's to counter keys or a team that I have any reason to believe is using insta-heals, but recently I've seen much more hate against it. Multiple times I've seen it called a "Crutch perk" or something similar. I'm aware that people don't like losing items, but this seems to be a brand new thing with EGC. Any thoughts?
---
I hate to be “that guy” but what did he say?
---
Don't have an absolute favorite. Top three is Myers, Spirit, and Wraith.
---
Bc for how powerful he is, he's too easy
---
You know, some people have been wanting chucky or other small killers, but so far  one of the recurrent problems is how would they carry survivors and hook them.
---
So I tought this would be a good idea, instead of carrying them, they would drag them in a headlock, survivor would be trying to escape like people try to escape a headlock (hands on the killer's arm trying ot break free) that way the stabbing from Decisive would still apply.
---
FOr the hooking part, Magical beings like chucky could pull a nurse and use magic to hook them. Others could jump and climb the hook with the survivor in one hand and then hook them (Jump to the hook's pillar then to the uper hand and then hook).
---
Of course this will be longer than normal hooking, but also the headlock most likely would be faster, so it would be a trade off.
---
Why do I lose a pip when the killer disconnects from the middle of a match?
---
 I don’t think NOED should change because you can just cleanse all the dulls, but maybe 12/18/24 minimum because 6 seems small
---
Usually it’s a teabag and a dead hard out without even giving a free hit :(
---
I don't have a problem with it specifically, but I wouldn't mind if the 'Exposed' icon was consistent, whether it's always visible when it's active or whether it's only visible until you're hit.
---
Gloating aside, there are a few reasons to stay at the gate. Survivors get points for being near the killer and the killer can get a free hit in.
---
Well the idea is that the exposed doesnt reach too far, but you’re probably far. The thing is nobody cleanses dull totems except for points, yet still complain.
---
Since Ghostface releases next Tuesday would you be able to buy this week's perks to instantly prestige him? Just curious also this shrine sucks besides maybe Remember Me
---
I feel personally attacked
---
I should have been more specific in the tittle is more about hooking and carrying mechanics, but yes, I would like to see Gremlins in DBD.
---
God damn it I just want head on since I don’t wanna put points into Jane

You know that this is just edited, right? There are only 4 skins. 3 reskins of the original outfit and then there is the Raining Blood one, nothing else.
---
Why is NOED overpowered but the hatch isn't? Survivors can have a free win without a perk needed but killers can't sacrifice a perk slot for exposed status effect at the very end of the game? Billy, has NOED and super speed all game. Devour hope is a better NOED that kicks in faster and has Mori. If a killer wipes a team using NOED and they all "should have escaped" they were probably messing around and deserved to get hit. Oh and you can break the totems, there's only 5, and they aren't hard to find.
---
I'll snag mad grit i need somerhing for my agitation.
---
Aye, the console life sucks. I play on Xbox, so I’m forced to play billy in high ranks, and my only type of computer is a Mac, which everyone knows cannot handle any online actions. I’ve tried nurse, and it hurts.
---
Survivor screwed up the taunt pretty bad lol. You can still scape while downed, but being extra cocky ruined it for them.
---
Facecamp /s
---
What a fucking miggrt
---
Scarecrow ghostface would be great.
---
As a Minnie and Mandy main, I am eating good this chapter
---
Those are the people that die to NOED. People that actively take precautions to play against NOED don’t care.
---
The week after buying Leatherface and leveling him up, I get BBQ in the Shrine of Secrets.
---
The week after buying Kate and leveling her up, it's got get Dance With Me.
---
I never even wanted to play either one. ffs
---
As the EGC is ticking down and it causes you to abandon your teammate, sounds healthy.
---
Not everything is hated because it's overpowered, sometimes people resent things because they feel it steals something from them that they were entitled to. In this case, people resent NOED because they felt they were entitled to victory just for powering five generators. This is why you'll always see the line *"why should I be punished for doing my objective...?"* in these threads, as if repairing five generators was the goal the entire time, and not just a means to an end. In reality, escaping alive is your objective as a survivor, and sometimes countering/preventing/avoiding NOED is part of that.
---
Cleansing every totem, even if none are lit, just seems like a waste of time in preparation for 1 perk.
---
Ehh? Why would i be a dick
---
Yea or small game, which tells you where they are also. You may or may not know but they 95% of the time spawn by a generator, so if you see a gen, there's a totem close by. Survivors need to get over that all 4 of them aren't gonna make it every game.
---
Like, don't go for dumb hook saves without Borrowed Time. All you're doing is risking yourself and pretty much guaranteeing the guy advances a hook state. There's a perk very much for if you want to do shit like that, if you don't have it don't do it.
---
I mean. Tier 3 Michael.
---
Full-on notification when they could have just easily made it so you only know when you see him holding his knife differently.
---
asian ppl (usually from japan) afk farm with a modded controller &amp; sell the accounts with 1mil bp for $1
---
My friend was cleansing a totem at he beginning of the game, thinking he slick and commenting about how toxic he was. Then it was haunted grounds.
---
Max "I drive better while drunk" Thompson on the lowest?
---
Sorry that other people like fun over rank my dude
---
No, this was after my rank reset and i got back on the game
---
Until you run into experienced players. I cant count how many times i have faced billy players who cant down me inside a loop or a jungle gym and just ends up dc'ing. Thats without playing like an ass, t bagging, flashlight flicking etc. Just pure outplay.
---
I've been there myself as a young billy player. I waited until rank reset so i could play and learn him at the lower ranks. 4ks after 4ks every game was a joke until i started facing ppl who knew what they were doing and most games ended up in depips or black pips.
---
To the really goood billy mains out there who pulls off perfect curves on 90% of the loops is just well deserved and not imbalanced imo. That only tells that he has hundreds if not thousands of hrs on billy.
---
It’s just people being salty they lost their items. It’s not even a crutch perk like noed or ruin.
---
I hate infinite tier 3 Myers it's so hard to avoid.
---
Which is completely agreeable. I don’t get NOED, I just made this as an idea to, I don’t know really. Maybe take the ESCAPE in No One Escapes Death a little more seriously? Idk
---
Yup, exactly.
---
You’re not the only one but that doesn’t make you any less of a dick
---
You can see the flame?
---
I cleansed it and it went BOOM!
---
No clue it was hexed
---
There nothing else to do besides gens, imagine if a killer could disable survivor perks. Survivors can actually take away perks from the killer and they are too lazy :p
---
That's the point. Sometimes it *is* a waste of time. Sometimes, there's a consequence for trying to rush your opponent out of the match. You can't go into every match having made every right decision, you're going to get greedy sometimes and too cautious others, that's unavoidable in an asymmetrical game.
---
You nailed it, like he was upset that he spent time cleansing a dull... ez 600 points in my book
---
Does it? I thought you're notified because your character screams and become exposed. 
---
Is it me, or does only Hex perks behave this way? I remember when NOED wasn't a Hex perk and was on a timer I think it used to say Exposed the second the gens were done.
---
Well remember, the entity feeds on hope so it's not entirely allied with the killer either. It will indeed do some things to give the survivors a belief that they have a chance, maybe even an edge, making their sacrifice all the better.
---
It's not useless... It's just actively against you.
---
I once was trying to locker dodge a Hillbilly's chainsaw and accidentally revealed someone. I was able to make it to another locker and the Hillbilly unrevved and got the guy in the locker.
---
If people complain about NOED, but don’t bother to cleanse dull totems (it’s direct counter), that’s on them. 
---
I’m a survivor main, but if we get to have Adrenaline, they get to have NOED.
---
&gt; Wait what?
---
The fuming mixtape: "Dark beats, violent shreds and unfathomable vocals from another world fill the mind with a vibrating sixth sense."
---
The entity has a hard rock band!
---
&gt;Get some pots and pans and some friends and you're clear!
---
Now that's sound advice.
---
Are you insinuating that you don’t like the game? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Does it matter?
---
Yea I use rancor just for those pesky MoM, D'S, Andrenaline users, which i see those 3 perks together way too much. Even if I'm not trying to tunnel, DS is a pain, a minute is a long time.
---
Ah I get you, yeah there's a lot of vocal critics of NOED but those players need a change of perspective more than the perk needs to be changed.
---
If 1 person in a match did 1 totem each, boom NOED’s gone. What’s the time to do 1 totem like 20 seconds? If that seems like “meh too much time” then you can’t really complain
---
Good to know I’m doing all right then.
---
No scream, but yeah with MYC you're notified that you're exposed the moment you rescue a teammate from a hook, with a visible timer and everything. No hit necessary.
---
If they're doing it right, they should still fall into the escape.
---
I've never seen this copypasta before, keep up the good work!
---
Why do I sometimes die on my 2nd hook and sometimes 3rd?
---
The devs have mentioned how the Pig works.  
---
If I recall correctly, each trap has a "key"; when the match starts, every key is assigned to a box. After searching a box, the game matches every key in that box to your trap, and if they match, the trap gets disarmed.
---
Thanks! I definitely will.
---
Why am I getting a hentai vibe out of this?
---
Who are you planning to buy next?
---
The problem is the devs had been saying that for a long time, even when it wasn't always the case (look at the post I mention).  So I wanted to test it to see if it had changed, and it actually had.
---
Good, now my "fuck your windows" build is complete. I'll probably also grab Mad Grit as well.
---
The title is OP asking how to become a better killer and you're telling them yo use NOED?  That is literally the last perk they should be running if they want to legitimately improve their killer play.  Playing without it will force them to play better and make better decisions midgame.
---
Must proceed quickly
---
When I bought Kate for Dance With Me, I also got Feng Min for Lithe. But I think that's been on recently, right? Might be another Feng Min perk coming soon then!
---
Small advice as a killer:
---
You need to be stealthy, even if you have a terror radius and can't duck (mostly) you need to be as stealthy as possible, try to avoid being seen.
---
Remember, always try to guard generators so they don't end up too far from each other, if you manage to end up with gens too close it will be easier to defend the last ones.
---
Learn when to let go, sometimes we focus on an annoying survivor so much we end up losing the game, So if the chase is becoming too hard there is nothing wrong with cuting it and going for others who might not be as good or not in a such a good position.
---
Sometimes when survivors try to bodyblock you, the best thing to do is to just hit them as soon as they get close to you.
---
There's three hook stages. The one where you can attempt to unhook yourself, the struggle, and death. You slowly move towards the next hook stage while you are on the hook. Each hook puts you on the next hook stage. So if you were on the first hook stage when you were unhooked then get hooked again, you'll be in struggle. If you were in struggle when you were unhooked then get hooked again, you'll be dead. So what I imagine is happening is either people are taking a long time to save you or you're trying to unhook yourself, which puts you in struggle, meaning you die on your second hook. When you die in three hooks, your teammates always saved you before you got to the next stage.
---
When I play Myers, I normally keep my tier 3 ready at 99% right? 
---
Well, a few toxic survivors who sandbagged their teammate then tbagged at the exit gates refused to leave. So what did I do? I pretended to be friendly and moonwalked in front of the gates and all that jazz, swung in the direction of the person they sandbagged and shook my head yes, and slowly moonwalked to where the person they sandbagged was
---
The fucking dumbasses followed me after that because I pretended to be friendly and gestured them to heal that poor survivor they sandbagged. That was a huge mistake lmao
---
I popped my tier 3 and slugged them both, hooked em, then took the person they sandbagged and dropped em at the exit. I felt like how Keanu Reeves and Elon Musk must feel after browsing pewdiepies subreddit for more than a minute
---
You die on your second hook if you stop spamming the struggle button, but on your 3rd hook no matter what you’re dead.
---
Yea saw that at when it first came out. I was so damned confused
---
yes. more specifically when the exit gates are powered. so if there's5 gens left but only one person and you close the hatch, noed activates
---
if there's no totems left it doesnt activate
---
Yes
---
Skillcheck bonus is 2%, not 5%.
---
Only after the last generator is completed; if all totems are completed beforehand, no hex spawns and the perk doesn't activate.
---
I need this in my life so tell me where it is RIGHT NOW
---
People always get pissed when you bring Franklin's. You likely just avoided it.
---
megs scream slowed down kinda sounds like homer simpson for some reason and i am only finding this out from watching this clip 10/10 shitpost
---
What if there is one totem left? Will it activate?
---
I need to know where this is Right now
---
Dbd makes it own lore for their characters so... that problem is fixed. They can also give slender man new powers
---
you need to make the big brain play and wait till she is chasing a healthy survivor
---
*is ruin*
---
*uninstalls*
---
should I save 3 dailies for the double xp weekend or does it not work that way?
---
I can confirm that that’s either not true, OR several keys can spawn in a single box, because I have watched 2 survivors both get their helmets off on the same box.
---
There is no reason to believe there is any difference in any two player accounts, as it would make no sense for the game to randomly favor one player over another. As such, chests obtained by a different player than me are assumed to be just as well as if I had opened them myself and constitute the same population. I'm rather surprised I'm having to explicitly state this: it's a given to pretty much anyone you ask.
---
If not all **dull totems** are broken, the hex will spawn and the perk will activate.
---
It's already been done I think
---
A completely new totem? Or will it possess the remaining
---
Several keys can spawn in a single box.  
---
"The game matches *every key in that box*"
---
This community doesn't take to having different opinions well...
---
I don’t remember exactly but something about making sure he teabags at the exit
---
Same here, my friend tried dbd, spent about 70 hours on it and then quit because of campers and farming teammates.
---
Freddy is very much a low-rank stomper, because he's good against people who don't know what he does. Once you can loop decent and understand how his power functions, he isn't that good, but he's very much a terror at first.
---
Okay admittedly I also do really poorly against him. I know how he works, I know he shouldn't be that hard, but I always get fucked. I can point to at least one game against almost any other killer where I did really good. Got gens done fast, looped for a really long time. Never had that game with a Freddy.
---
Dailies won't give you double XP. Only the in-game points you earn.
---
It will take the place of an intact dull totem.
---
Beautiful human you are
---
I’d buy this in a heartbeat, good work
---
Thank you
---
The year 4 roadmap said September-ish.
---
This just took a turn for the awesome!
---
It was a Dwight wtf do u expect
---
Any of the exhaustion perks are decent, though Dead Hard is considered by some to be the best. We're Gonna Live Forever is good for points, though it gives you no in game benefit. Self Care is great. Borrowed Time is good for hook saves. We'll Make It is also decent. I like Small Game because it makes finding totems way easier, though I don't know if it's good once you know the spawns.
---
[removed]

F
---
There are a lot of answers to this - what's your playstyle? Are you a gen jockey? Do you like getting in chases? There are also fairly frequent threads that come up here with the same question, but you might have to sort by New to see them.
---
Ever since the Shrine moved, I completely forgot it exists and don't check it. I'm only rarely reminded of it by visiting this sub. 
---
They should definitely move it back, imo
---
It doesn't require Fragrant Tuft of Hair. I think people like Tuft of Hair with it because once you reach T3 you can just mori for the rest of the game. I think you can't get it if you run Tombstone piece because there's only enough juice in people for three T3s with that. You need the full tombstone.
---
Quick Time Event
---
Xbox doesn’t have an after game chat, so people will take the time to open your profile click send message and directly write you gg alerting you of a notification. It’s not a big deal I just feel like it’s unnecessary on Xbox
---
Fucking love this
---
 Because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy.
---
Mind blown
---
That wraith skin is terrifying....I’m getting it
---
Your right lol I look back on my message and I see the dramatic side of me
---
You really lucked out then, managing to escape with these three.
---
No, no worries. My comment was rude. Can't hurt to ask twice and be absolutely sure.
---
I'm pretty sure the devs are the Entity, since they (both the devs IRL and the Entity in-game) control what goes on in said game and award points based on specific actions (the devs control what amount of points the Entity awards for those actions, though).
---
Trappers with hex totems aswell
---
I was actually scared this was the sonic remodel and now I'm filled with an insane amount of relief
---
I ask alotta questions when im not sure
---
Slender Man is too supernatural for the Entity to take. All of the killers were human at one point or another, whereas Slender Man never was.
---
With the way the keep coming out with trash killers. *looking at trashface disabling his power* what do you expect.
---
Nope, I checked afterwards and I still lost it
---
Not necessarily bad, it's more... mmmmediocre...
---
Take Mori’s out the game #Summer2019!!!!
---
Oh my god why haven’t I thought of that before
---
Yes! The killer disconnected so he didn't get any points.
---
I think you did a pretty good job on it
---
I wouldn't say any are toxic but hex ruin can be annoying sometimes.
---
spies from the shadows can be quite useful, its pretty easy to notice them if you arent playing hag
---
&gt;The game is actually built for survivors to not be communicating with each other, and for the risk of fellow teammates perhaps not being as good as you want them to be. The Steam page even says this. Everyone seems to think teammates have to be good all the time, but yet another problem with SWF is that it allows the survivor team to be far more efficient than they were ever supposed to be in the first place.
---
I won't waste as much time arguing with you because you seem to be one of those annoying killer mains that want survivors to start the trial on a hook. 
---
I don't want god tier survivors, read my post again. I just don't want useless survivors who don't work on generators or go for rescues even when they can clearly see that the killer is busy with someone else.
---
Would buy and switch to only playing David.
---
As killer: MoM, Deliverance, Unbreakable(I slug a lot), and Balanced Landing at main buildings.  
---
As survivor: Bamboozle, Franklin's, Third Seal and Knock Out(I play solo), and Dying Light.
---
Probably MoM but that's getting nerfed so I think the survivors are fine but for Killers I can't stand NOED as it takes no skill to use  and is  a crutch for killers even though it can be countered.
---
I just want nurses calling :’(
---
DWIGHT IS A CUTE BOY AND THE GAYS WOULD STAN HIM
---
(cue endless “is he gay?” comments)
---
What is this, a crossover episode?
---
I hate Rancor more; you can't play the game if you're the obsession.
---
Emotes so i can floss as spirit
---
Take insta-heals out with them.
---
i am the entity
---
Well yeah, it’s BM. I don’t think anyone disagrees with that
---
trapper+agitation+iron grasp is my new go to swf destroyer build.
---
they stop body-blocking pretty quick once i actually start chasing them with a survivor on my shoulder
---
NOED, barbeque and chili, nurse's calling, ruin, make your choice
---
make a [change.org](https://change.org) and i will sign
---
Or agitation
---
I never see Rancor in a killers build plus they are technically nerfing it with MoM as it will now counter 1 shot abilities or perks
---
This was funny to me, because I was in the Marines, so I would know that if you were a seal, you wouldn't want anything the marines have, it's all junk :p I could hold my rifle up and see light shining through all the seams it was so old :p
---
literally unplayable
---
Not a typo. "Jules" is an affectionate nickname, also shown in promotional material for Legion.
---
"Jules" is a nickname for Julie, I believe.
---
I feel that’s more accomplishing then getting a million blood points. Nice job.
---
but why is survivors teabagging such a big deal on this sub, but not the other? the other party is out of options in both situations
---
[Me too!](https://i.imgur.com/Vs4pc5p.png)
---
U leave with a broken key with this perk build?
---
I don't think anyone is going to disagree with this.
---
Only T bagging survivors care about Noed
---
They said they were going to change MoM from the PTB.
---
I wish I had the patience to save up that much haha
---
Can I grab a blank source?
---
Indeed
---
I think you're misunderstanding me here.
---
You obviously deserve to be genrushed. That's not a matter of debate. You're choosing to stay in one section of the map.
---
I quite enjoy playing him and don’t find him too underpowered. Although he has some downsides I think it’s just a matter of finding perk builds that work best for you and experimenting.
---
I’m the scroll wheel
---
Not every killer needs Ruin. Learning to pressure gens over tunneling Survivors will do way more for you than tunneling with Ruin.
---
Ruin only helps with the pressure if you're good at pressuring gens.
---
I've had matches with Ruin where we gen rushed a killer within 4 minutes and no hooks.
---
I've also had matches WITHOUT Ruin where 7 min in, we still didn't have a single gen done and killer was already up to 7 hooks down.
---
Same with a good killer running Ruin, Devour, and Thrill who can pressure those hexes and prevent them from being cleansed and waste a lot of time for Survivors trying to take out the Devour instead of gens.
---
A good killer can pressure a good group. Ruin is there to help that, not act in place of it like most killers treat it (and then complain Survivors are OP and Ruin sucks if Ruin gets cleansed ASAP)
---
wat
---
Hillbilly, Spirit, Myers. There is no other killer on console past rank 5 accept maybe a pink hatchet huntress if someone’s feeling bold.
---
Did you get sucked into the chainsaw? It looked like your character moved back
---
r/unexpectedsuperbad
---
Are the Xbox servers not working right? I can’t find people to play with
---
Seriously, I do the same thing. The 4th stack is way more valuable than a kill to me.
---
I feel like every time I run third seal, i don’t get much use out of it or it gets broken right away
---
Plague isn't that great as long as survivors don't cleanse.
---
Noed is broken, hasn't worked two games in a row on huntress
---
I think she isn’t on where the tier lists are made
---
Keanu Reeves as a Survivor/Killer when?
---
Also yes.
---
1. Nurse
---
2. Spirit
---
3. Hillbilly
---
4. Myers
---
5. Hag
---

Just my personal opinions from both playing as each killer and facing each killer.
---
Oh shit I’m blind
---
Oh my bad, that actually makes a lot of sense! Thanks for that :)
---
Is there like war going on between pig mains and other killers?
---
Not a problem!
---
Because survivors aren’t always the brightest bunch. Half the time they run straight towards me too focused on my terror, the other half they just barely notice me to avoid getting within my field of view
---
Dfq u on about?
---
For me it’s not really about the numbers being low it’s that a lot of the time survivors will heal against thanatophobia (at least in my experience) and with sloppy butcher as wel it’s a pretty decent time wasting combo
---
The Third Seal can be incredibly strong if you aren't against an SWF group; it lets you put immense pressure due by slugging.
---
No but it’s still in the game and hasn’t been removed. I can’t get reported for playing the game a way it was intended after all.
---
Sorry about that! That makes a lot of sense. :)
---
I personally only heit the survivors once when on hook only to shit up that god aweful screem which begins to get repetitive so....A quick hit shuts em up and then I am on my way. 
---
 I personally would not do it if yhere was an option to maybe quite the screem when hooking or even add a bit more variety of voices but It feels very generic for me to have so many different survivors but really only 2 screems when hook.....well....it at least feels that way
---
Can cowboy Jake duel with him?

I’d be all for a Mr Slave outfit

&gt;Imagine being the kind of person who watermarks their memes. While using other people's images, no less.

you can't stay that to glenock because pig posts arent nonexistent
---
How do it get a user flair?
---
I feel like slugging is the best use with third seal, but I still think it’s the weakest hex. Either that or huntress lullaby.
---
nobody:
---
me: *entity displeased*
---
Yeah that perk sucks now.
---
Would Ghost face be 19?
---
I've always felt that Carrie would, at the very least, be visually interesting. The prestige clothing alone would make it worth it.
---
What if he actually gained power from being looked at?
---
you're supposed to kill them, don't feel bad
---
Its mostly people calling me a salty killer main. Its just for shits and giggles.
---
I wonder if it was a mistake to do that......nah.
---
These are nice, might grab wraith and leatherpig.
---
I want to level tapp for that cop outfit too but I just don't have the bloodpoints :(
---
I think that if anyone actually takes your posts seriously, they need a reality check.
---
You can't enjoy yourself. That's not what this game is about.
---
Ruin is pretty much a necessity on nearly every killer. Don't feel bad for using it, it helps level the playing field.
---
Sometimes I also lose survivors mid-chase
---
As a Myers main i will say this: you cant avoid it. Like you CNA break line of sigh tot slow him down but fi he has ruin or a slowing perk of BOY will it be hard to rush him and once he gets it, its game over.
---
Tombstone however is a joke and you can loop him or get into a locker to stop being insta moired
---
It was up like 2-3 weeks ago I think. Might be waiting a while
---
My bad.
---
Haha alright then, thanks for pointing it out
---
Nobody disagrees. This post is unnecessarily adversarial
---
Pretty much. I mean ffs its a shitpost.
---
tell that to my extra 1200 bloodpoints for cleansing those 2 dulls.
---
Been there, tried to get them to come at me. It was just really quiet.
---
Hhmmm I submitted a ticket and got the auto response last week but just today got an email to submit proof of bp. I did but still no response. Maybe the office is closed for the night. Just didn't want to wait another week been going on since 6/4. I play daily and just regrinding perks on an alt currently.
---
I just leave because I’m not an ass hole
---
I'm fairly new to the DbD YouTube scene as I only started playing the game 2 weeks ago but I really enjoy both Monto and HybridPanda. They both have a really fun and "not taking things too seriously" kinda vibe about them that makes it fun to watch. Not sure how much if they stream at all.
---
it's that you can be sure that no extremely toxic survivor is going to come in and strictly ruin your game, farm you, lead the killer to you, box you in, etc.
---
I'm not saying those things aren't shitty, but (as the Steam page even says...) a part of this game is the risk and uncertainty that should be there, no matter which side of the game you decide to load in as. Plus, could you really trust everybody in this situation? Hardly. People would try to survive in different ways (some definitely to the detriment of others), and that's also a part of this game. 
---
SWF isn't needed, at least in the sense that it "allows" voice comms. Your issue seems to be with solo queue survivors, which means they need to learn. Not to allow people to join up with each other and load up voice chat.
---

I'll never understand the people who inject politics into the most unrelated shit ever
---
every killer is viable at your rank
---
Do you mean add ons? Or are there actual perks that reduce killer ability cooldowns?
---
One thing is that people do not like what you do (like me), but send you private messages? LMAO! Why do not they just block you?
---
please prove me wrong, I really WANT to use pop goes the weasel but I need evidence it actually does that
---
what in the goddamn
---
leave Billy's weave alone
---
oh poor simon, he didn't deserve everything he went through
---
Why is this a gif?
---
Really worth a post? The guys scum but just report and move on, that's how I see it anyway
---
If you don't have the time to play around NOED you shouldn't be worried about the end game yet.
---
Maybe do some for killers too so it balances out? If people just see one side, the side you're against would probably hate your guts, but if you did both sides, at least each side has things to laugh about.
---
Like if killer made perks:
---
At start of the trial, all generators are blocked for 120/150/180secs but their auras are shown to survivors.
---
While any dull totems remain on the map from the start of the trial, all survivors suffer from the Exposed status effect. 
---
When survivors perform a safe hook rescue their auras are revealed to the killer for 60/90/120secs.
---
A failed skill check while repairing grants the killer a 50% regression on generator progress and 20% increased movement speed for 60/90/120secs.
---
Need attachments to increase beam accuracy to blind faster
---
oh, he's hot garbage lol for sure. but that's a damn cool skin!
---
Were all your totems broken?
---
There isn't an add-on that makes you blind faster.
---
no, they all have the same lunge distances, except for myers
---
Why does it always turn political? I can handle a whole salt and I understand the blind salty rage of DBD but where does that shit even come from?
---
Nobody expects the Tenacity Inquisition
---
If you really want to ignore one of your primary senses in Dead by Daylight you would need to increase the other ones. Lots of people have "all-seeing" builds that allow you to visually track survivors. Monto, a popular DBD youtuber has a couple all-seeing builds. Killers that can also help with their abilities would be Doctor, Wraith, and Legion (although legion has its own issues).
---
Odd Bulb does
---
No one forces you to camp.
---
That's never affected me before now?
---
So far it’s very fun besides the shitty randoms and body camping killers.
---
still pretty bad
---
i know.. makes me want to play wraith again but i'll instantly regret the purchase because he sucks as a killer. so.. pig skin it is
---
Could you link the section of the stream, OP?
---
It doesn't.  
---
"Tremendously increases the beam's visual brightness.
---
Tremendously increases the Blindness duration.
---
Slightly increases the Flashlight battery consumption."  
---
It used to, but now, it just increases the blind *duration and visual brightness*
---
Holy crap. Not often you see a toxic anti-SJW... they're typically okay people.
---
Unless they're kids. ;(
---
YES IT IS, this is how I know you're rank 20 with 10 hours of playtime, you're complaining about facecamping and you haven't witnessed this yet, go afk as killer, crows will appear lol
---
I need to get better with trapper. Proper placement seems the key. I keep getting out-played, like they're three steps ahead haha
---
He had #TRUMPPOWER #YOUMADBRO #YOUGOTTROLLED and #USA in his bio so those are probably the only thoughts ever running through his head.
---
Oh yes, the camping meta. lol
---
It is what the entity wants it to be.
---
And the worst part is if you fight against survivors who have played long enough to memorize those hex spawns that your hex totem, whatever it maybe, can get cleansed in 30 or so seconds, and the game even warns survivors that they are under the effects of a hex totem at the very beginning of the match.
---
"Visual brightness" = blinds faster, iirc
---
yeah me too
---
Bond, all the way, is a better selfcare
---
I'm almost certain it doesn't affect the blinding time.  
---
I might just be confusing shit though.
---
Mmmmmmmm “very fine people on both sides” 🤔
---
Is this Rotten Fields? Because if that’s Torment creek thats Busted
---
&gt;Loved by everyone  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Fun for everyone
---
Seems like every or at least most Wraiths I meet camp the hook while cloaked.
---
I once heard a great quote:
---
Hex Totems: Great for knowing where survivors spawn
---
Go check out the first post on the front page mate
---
But the survivor perks are more fun.
---
"hey you little shit, just a heads up, im crouching my way towards you right now, so you better pay attention or ill be able to use my power, that only lasts 20 seconds and even when working properly has zero jumpscare potential beCAUSE YOU ARE GIVEN A NOTIFICATION WHEN YOU ARE MARKED LIKE WHy??"
---
Thank you! Personally do you think it's worth it?
---
because if its not official does that mean... better visuals? 
---
seriously though, i want a killer/survivor game that actually looks good for once and is actually backed by a big studio.
---
Theres a reason why that hasnt been fixed, its not a bug.
---
No, Mad Grit is shit.
---
I come across many so far, who as last person try and go after one of the last two hooked survivors and ignore gens. Guess I'm not supposed to play with logic, just be some dumb killer. Gotcha. I dont stand next to one person on a hook like I've came across a few times but dang
---
Yea... No.
---
Haha what fun you are, main killer, this is just shitty content, content made to complain about other complaints
---
well good thing peepee poopoo shut up
---
Like I said, agree to disagree. The unpredictability of killers and other teammates is awesome, but the number of purposeful saboteurs is just insane. And I shouldn't have to play actively against one of my "teammates" as well as the killer
---
depends, what was the last thing you ate? was it hope?
---
You know that Hex perks suck when the only one of note is ruin ;)
---
I'm not sure if it's the same issue as mine. My PC runs the game at constant 59-60 fps on Medium but a lot of my games were stuttering so I switched it down to low, and it still does the same thing. The game runs at 59-60fps most of the time, but in certain situations like when I enter killer's terror radius, or when killer M1s a survivor anywhere on the map, or me, my game gets all stuttery for a moment then back to 60fps. It's not my connection either as bad ping would cause me to teleport backwards, not blink forward during stutters.
---
Bond, once you start using it, you'll never stop
---
but billy isnt nothing, theres a big difference between baby billys and legacy 5000 hour billys, if billy is so easy and has no skill ceiling, please tell me every mindgame and tactic that you know of his
---
Play how you want and ignore people lol. Survivors and killers both do toxic things lmao. No one plays the game the same, everyone has different playing types.
---
I love the look of fear on the survivors faces when they try to body block and you just straight up drop the cunt and start chasing
---
still underrated
---
Well, I'm not one to hate, at least you put it in a nice sort of "haha that's kinda true" kind of post instead of a "yea survivors are easy mode, nerf this, nerf that, it's unfair for killer" kind of post, you do you :)
---
what do you mean?
---
Well, there IS KYF...
---
Yup the idiots at BhVR said camping and tunneling was a non ban able offense, so all the scrub players on PS4 took full advantage of it!
---
 I wish they would make it where if a killer camps they lose speed depending how long they are staying next to a hooked survivor, but if you have that idiot waiting to hook rescue it won’t go against the killer and you can blame the teammate. 
---
I’ve tried getting people on here but no luck because of how trash the camping is and it’s the 11th today and holy hell the camping has been horrible this evening. Didn’t matter what rank it is, because rank reset is coming and no one cares.
---
I know lmao
---
I was just surprised that it seems the community is so toxic. I play competitive madden and kids cry less which up until now; took the cake for most crybabies.
---
Wounded Healer is also a thing as well.
---
I see your Quentin is in fact not bloody :p
---
Yeah. About the only thing that pisses off a Wraith is a flashlight for obvious reasons. Other than that he's pretty chill.
---
Hahahahaha. Right!
---
So I'm supposed to just go leave the hook and sniff my farts while 3 Survivors point at me and teabag in the distance instead of doing gens?
---
I would LOVE this.
---
Bloody face, I like to change the two items of clothing he has sometimes. :p

Have you checked out the perks I made?
---
I would LOVE to play her. But as I said, every time I do my power is basically useless. It’s even worse when using corrupt.
---
Yep. The only reason that person on the hook didn’t get knocked down when I saved them and they got hit was because I had Borrowed Time which lets someone take a hit before being downed no matter what
---
#YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE KING, YOU KNOW!

Interesting how you decided to talk about if this "hurt" me, instead of talking about the fact I was defending you from the people who send you PM
---
Why is this game so shit yet I keep coming back
---
Pretty good job
---
I'd use that David outfit, but I don't play David. : (
---
I've had survivors do a lil sneaky on me and purposefully infect a locker so I would look in it.
---
Compare spirit and nurse to huntress and billy. Spirit and nurse takes time to learn, but in the end all you have to focus on is learning their power. Spirit has a bit more learning to it than nurse imo, since nurse is all about muscle memory. But my point is that both of these killers ignores the core mechanic of the game so loops and such is relatively irrelevant. 
---
Billy and huntress.. oh boy where to start? Not only do you need to learn how to aim your hatches, how they curve, their hitbox, their speed, determine distance and movement of the survivor,  controlling the chainsaw and so on. But on top of that  you have to learn every map, every loop, which loops can i throw hatches on for a guaranteed hit, which loops should i avoid, should i pull up my hatch this time at the pallet or go for the next round? Rew my chainsaw just enough to  get the animation so they think i will commit, can i curve this loop short or do i need to take it wider so i dont hit the tiny pipe sticking out? I can go on and on with it but i think you get my point. Its obvious that billy and huntress takes more time to master due to all the info you need to go through and learn when you face the really good survivors.
---
Wouldn't be nearly as powerful
---
I just try to do normal skillchecks when I'm in a situation that would disadvantage me (or a teammate) a lot when I failed one
---
No mither isn't for slugging. It has anti slug capabilities, but unbreakable + tenacity outclasses no mither as an anti-slug perk in every way.
---
And this is how NOED wins.
---
Mood
---
yeah true. the hitboxes are janky. i just use vomit on generators and just wack people
---
Also waiting for all other survivors to get to the exit to be ready to take a hit
---
The devs said they want to make changes to the nurse, the day will come...
---
People crying about “gen rushing”. That is literally the objective of the game, and if you want me to not do it so as to not hurt your feelings, you can go back to preschool and stay there. Use Ruin, and if it’s getting destroyed too quickly, use Corrupt Intervention. There are perks like this for a reason. Also, patrol the gens when you’re not chasing people. Looking at the same 2 gens the entire match is not protecting them.
---
I can’t even log in
---
Mad grit HYPEEEEEE
---
When will people understand that followers or subscriptions are earned? Otherwise they are dead numbers
---
You could try some random stuff like Unbreakable, spine chill, pharmacy (as opposed to self care), etc. not the most meta perks but they work
---
Yeah...no.
---
It's the offering that lets you play Freddy for one game
---
:(
---
You mean Smokey Splinter?
---
How can I get this video???? This is incredible
---
Agreed. Now if only Wraith was worth playing..
---
This happened to me but in the basement ;-;
---
Anyone else getting random dc’s?
---
I've never played Bubba except for dailies, actually.
---
In his defense, he was suffering from serious brain damage. I think him being slow was intentional.
---
Bubbas Basement
---
you don't need tactics with Billy. just couple shit simple things. 
---
- get on top of survivor before revving. take few moments to predict if they will spin.
---
- hook, leave the hook, come back in 10 seconds or as soon as unhooked. m1 the unhooked
---
- in loops fake chainsaw till they drop the pallet
---
- run stale motherfukin build and instasaw
---
- change to keyboard for easier chainsaw control lol
---
like i'm close to 3k hours, okay? 90% of that time i spent on red ranks, survivor and a god tier Freddy and Spirit main. i've seen GOD tier Huntresses who would go full perkless and destroy a very good team with their insane aim and prediction. i've seen same with Nurses, of course. there is an insane difference between god tier Nurse/Huntress and god tier Billy. there is no such thing as god tier Billy on the first place, he's fukin braindead. as a red rank survivor, fam, all i see is just Billies every fukin game. i know all their shit tricks. they're boring. 
---
i'd also like to withdraw my previous statement and say Nurse isn't too hard(still harder than Billy lol). i just never gave her the time and played solely on red ranks without learning. i spent few hours on husband's account with Nurse on green ranks, came back to mine and did better than some red rank Nurses i meet on a fukin Yamaoka estate with two blendettes on my rank 1.
---
so if you think Billy is in any way hard to play, i bet you can't do kills with Freddy without noed and 3 second transition or end chases with Spirit in less than 15 seconds. 
---
Freddy needs tactics. Legion needs tactics. these two in current condition can't win without big brain if you want to play fair. i don't think any of them is weak, i think people just don't want to think and pay attention like facing Spirit they often dc cause can't be arsed to think, listen and learn.
---
Billy has too little downsides to the amount of power devs gave him. only argument here from Billy and survivor mains is that he can be looped. ginger, what? literally every killer but Nurse can be looped. if you have ears and situational awareness, i swear looping Spirit is possible. same with Hag and Huntress.
---
keep on stroking your ego thinking you've accomplished something if you can play Billy or against him.
---
I go for great skill checks personally. You’d be surprised at how good you get with just a little practice.
---
They were likely talking about Switch or Mobile release
---
Unhooking a survivor in front of the killer will get them killed faster.
---
Welp.
---
I think about this. This game has such a bad reputation for a toxic community I didn't play it for a long time. I'm a noob sitting at 18 right now and I find it's a mixed bag. Sometimes as survivor I do get a serious facecamp. That sucks, but I still got some kinda points and that guys probably another noob who's hopefully going to learn better. There's also lots of times when I play killer that other survivors close in so fast they don't even give me a chance to leave, and I have no interest in camping. So it's all everybody's fault, and for some reason it's fun to experience the 31 flavors of everyone playing shitty.
---
They all ragequit, no DC. I tried to let the last two guys get xp but no dice. I guess ruin is too BM at this rank?
---
How did he not hear your loud as hell moaning in pain?
---
Some people just don’t realize it’s called an ‘asymmetrical’ game for a reason... it’s not necessarily going to be fair for everyone all the time... and people actually get upset (especially survivor mains).

Oh Tofu is one of my favorites. He’s a super funny, super chill dude. He plays both survivor and killer and he’s pretty good at the game.

Another funny one can be AngryPug. He does get triggered easily and his chat is completely on his nuts though. So that does get annoying pretty quick.

tier 3 Myers and Nurse have longest lunge
---
Unnerving presence and thanatophobia. What a unit
---
Jesus fuck someone really went above and beyond on that one
---
I mean, trash killers can easily still get downs.  There are dead zones where you can't really do much of anything, there's stuff like instasaw, prayer beads, etc.  I was downed and insidious camped by an instasaw Bubba yesterday who was really, really bad.
---
Borrowed Time
---
you have pretty terrible double standards, billy tactics are just "shit simple things" but with any other killers you act like you have 1000 iq for playing well with them, anyone can belittle the tactics of any killer to make them seem like they're for dumbasses. "bro spirit has no skill ceiling, just use your ears lmao" I think the only real argument you have is you're tired of seeing nothing but billies, and thats valid, but its not a real reason to hate billy players and that doesn't make him a badly designed killer, hes just fun to play as. you really need to chill.
---
and btw you didn't name everything billy has in his arsenal, so much for low skill ceiling mister 3000 hours
---
&gt;Not often you see a toxic anti-SJW

I would say that the issue is they're licensing ghost face as a character. If he were "the ghost" it wouldn't say ghost face in the game anywhere except the name of the dlc in the store.

I love how he casually leaves and jumps out the window
---
I like the map and weather ideas.
---
be grateful you're not *hooked* on PUBG
---
Have a look at Behavior Interactive's Death Garden: Bloodharvest
---
No, I leave the game because I have other shit that I’d rather be doing than waiting for the killer to come to me. Guess being a full grown adult will change your perspective on things. If I was 15 again, I might find it as fun as you do.
---
If I am playing killer, it doesn’t even bother me since I’ve been teabagged so much at this point. Honestly, unless I BM you first or you pulled off some sick play, you just look dumb teabagging.
---
You’ll have to forgive this Survivor. We purposely trained him wrong. As a joke.
---
1000 points is a 1000 points
---
That's just simply not true though. You absolutely can still play while you're the rancor obsession. Endgame is more difficult sure but it doesn't stop you from playing the game

Idk, I hit Ruin greats consistently but I can rarely ever hit greats without it for some reason
---
4 isn't even the second worst.
---
that's some intro for a 2 minute video

Idk I just feel like 4 was just obviously designed to be a modern retelling of the first film and it didn't really add much to the series and was full of annoying characters. I haven't watched it in a while so perhaps my opinion could change

Fuck you. You're the reason why I play One-Punch Freddy. (Freddy with STBFL and Rancor so you just get downed in one hit and then Mori'd after being ignored the entire match. You don't even get the chance to use the instaheal or DH, or even Decisive. Just Downed and Dead.)

Hybrid Panda, No0b3, AngeyPug, Puppers
---
Ironically, the people who are on this Reddit, know this already, the people you are targeting most likely don't use Reddit, or they would know better  :/
---
You know....you’re right. Totally forgot about that.
---
Why's she black now
---
Thrill of the Hunt is my go to locate survivors while earning extra points. I dont have the cannibal DLC so this is my 2nd hand BBQ and Chili :(
---
Sarcasm yeah, IMO its a feature because its hilarious and awesome every single time.
---
ONE WHOLE SALT
---
I can’t find any matches :/
---
That never stops, tried killer yet? Its not for the person with kids in the room.
---
Bing bong your opinion is wrong
---
Haunted Grounds. The entity dares you to cleanse it.
---
What you get for using Bitter Murmur
---
?
---
Threadbare Thirties David and Jake were pretty much those skins. They were even released during pride month.
---
Why was my comment downvoted... It was a question
---
What rank are you? I am really doubtful you are consistently getting 3K/4K at red ranks with Freddy.
---
i was once 1 off, it made me so upset
---
I used to use Empathy and Botany isnt bad. I'm definetly biased since it's my favourite perk, but I cant recommend Well Make It enough
---
I hate it when im can't do gens as a killer
---
I really want to try the combo of quick and quiet, lithe, and dance with me. Just need to unlock dance with me or decide to spend my iridescent shards on it in the shrine right now
---
Which perk should I switch for WMI
---
Upvote for best boy
---
Yeah but she's pretty much white in-game lol
---
Than you for your service.
---
It's not great, but it can work.  
---
You might also want to try out Lightweight; it's the most underrated perk in the game imo.
---
I just assume those artworks for outfits show who talk to whom.
---
Noed wins because it's a stupid perk.
---
Did you really just steal this post and post it in the same sub? Original.
---
that mask almost looked like max, from sam &amp; max
---
I've used it a few times but still tend to be found. Maybe I'm misusing it since I tend to lead my scratch marks a lot, but still
---
Hey, it's one thing to say the Clown is useless,  but to argue that the Spirit is better is a different thing entirely.
---
I actually recommended Legion for """""""""""fast""""""""""" farming so r.i.p to that peace offering, lol.
---
Prove they self is only useful for capping cooperation points soon assuming you can tag team gens but it's not efficient to work on the same gen.
---
Still wont net you any bonus bp.
---
If they’re getting salty or raging it just means you kicked their asses.
---
(it has yeah, sorry for your downvotes lol)
---
This makes me glad I changed messaging settings. This community has the maturity of freaking five year olds
---
"Trappers with hex totems" doesn't sound very rank 1ish
---
WMI and botany wont work together, since WMI doesnt stack with other healing speed perks, but WMI also only works for a limited amount of time after you've met a condition, so it's up to mew there. Though I would recommend swapping it for Botany or DS, since DS isn't exactly the best perk after the nerf
---
LOL
---
Is the only way to get a new character by using Auric Cells?
---
Also, is it possible to purchase Auric Cells using cash that's already in my Steam Wallet?
---
I was disappointed when they capped healing rate at +100%. I used to love running Botany and WMI on my Claudette for super fast healing after an unhook. Throw in a med kit and it was a zooming bar.
---
I've been hearing from just about everyone that it isnt that good. I might swap it for Lithe
---
He’s still a fun guy
---
how can you be killer and survivor main?
---
Legit I just bought kate and started levelling just for dance with me. At least I can save some blood points this way
---
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
---
How many hours you have? Hag is actually one of the slower killers besides using her traps. (110% movement speed compared to 115% movement speed like most killers. Other slow killers include Huntress, Doctor in Zappy Mode, Nurse when not blinking, EW1 Myers, and Spirit when not using her ability.)
---
So yeah there's no real movement speed difference in MOST killers outside of ability usage. Hillbilly when not chainsawing is just as fast as Leatherface, Clown, Freddy, Wraith, and so on. I swear Legion and Clown feel slow as hell when I'm playing them but they still move at 115% movement speed so IDK why they feel so goddamn slow.
---
[deleted]
---
Lightweight can throw off killers that know the way scratch marks work and try to cut the survivor off and zone them.  
---
It's not going to make you disappear or anything, but it can be a good perk if you know how scratch marks work from a killer perspective and work from there.
---
Ouch
---
Honestly, it helps to have thick skin, or let things roll off you like water off a duck. It's not as bad on Xbox as PC, and you have the option to block messages from people not on your friends list.
---
Depending on how you play the game, you may end up getting more messages than others. Behaviour that's considered unsportsmanlike to the community will often result in salty messages.
---
I tend to stay away from the official forums, because that place is way worse than here.
---
I remember. It was practically an insta heal with the green medkit
---
When you're just trying to "lol" at funny "maymays" but the editing makes you cry.
---
:'(
---
More like useless bitchass devs.
---
It's very sub rank 1 like 6-12 it happens all the time. IDK if that's just me though because I get trigger a lot by them
---
Freddy and Quentin's perks are also missing quotes.
---
I do to an extent. I'm not a great killer, only sitting at about rank 13, so I'd probably need to play more to understand fully. I'll give it another try though
---
I think you have to go to old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight and there should be an option on the right hand sidebar.
---
me when clown
---
this brings back a memory that happened  few months back. Friend was new to the game and didnt know what to do so all he did was run lol and while I was in a chase, I tried getting into a locker and ofc.... he was inside. We both bursted into laughter when the killer saw the locker being used.   
---
My friend died lmao. We still laugh about this to this day.  He says I got him killed. I love moments like this.
---
Can try using Black Ward if ya have it - but you then run the risk of losing it upon using it, unless you use the pearl add-on. With Killers now being able to close the hatch, it does give ya the chance to re-open it while they go to the gates.
---
Alright, thanks for the tips!
---
Don't forget obese asthma ridden 80 year old Clown not having quotes on his perks also
---
I started playing a week ago and I’m hooked. Figuratively and literally. Help.
---
Yeah looking at more in game references now I see her base colour is more pale in the games blue lighting, but some darker lighting gives her more brown hues. I guess with my work being flat you don't get the highlights or light source. Something I'll have to work on in future.
---
When a nurse brings noed 🤔

I mean they HAD quotes but were removed for whatever reason.

They literally want exactly that, yeah.

"Nurse is balanced", "Hag is so fast she can probably get a 3k match without using her phantasm traps ", "Clown doesn't need his bottles"... Dude... What am I reading
---
But why, if you know the others aren't being productive?
---
He loves you too. &lt;3
---
No, because I have my own findings that agreed with everyone else, and I don't record. But to show my point, let me explain this once more. By default, total progression DOES means 25% of 100%. Imagine survivors are adding percent up to 100% on a generator. Pop Goes reads the total amount of the generator as how much to reduce by. Thus, if a survivor did half a generator, that's 50% out of the 100%. A Pop Goes kick would then bring it to 25%.
---
You see one piston on a generator going with Pop active. You kick it. The piston entirely stops. That wouldn't be possible at all if it was of the CURRENT progression instead of TOTAL. Get what I'm saying?
---

---
Important detail here, I remember my first weeks of playing and asking “what the hell does exposed mean? Can the killer see me now!?”
---
Not trying to be rude, but... How can you ask that when your post is tagged (by you) as "shitpost"? Just by that you can know this is not only Q&amp;A reddit
---
oh shit
---
&gt;Nurse requires skill and is also balanced to me. I like the idea of a second, shorter-range blink. She's my second main.
---
that's a bait, boys, let's get out of here

[Why does this happen?](https://imgur.com/a/BmD148y)

I had a very good game as killer, only one survivor escaped and I got 5k in each category, yet I barely kept my pip. Why does this happen?
---
NO DON'T CLEAR THEM
---
* This reply brought to you in part by NOED Crutch Gang, LLC.
---
this has to be bait
---
Honestly Pig and Legion are pretty similar in what their powers do.
---
Getting the first hit off in a chase, and having stall.
---
Legion can apply his stall more often, and it has a set time.
---
Amanda can't apply her stall as much, but it can be powerful depending on RNG.
---
Legion can get a pretty much guaranteed first hit off in the chase, and go spread the pain.
---
Amanda can't get the first hit of as easily, but might be able to end chases quicker with her dash.
---
Legion has tracking.
---
Amanda has endgame potential.
---
As much as everyone likes to say "legion bad", he is probably equal to Amanda. They are both okay choices depending on how exactly you'd like to play.
---
but whatever, pick whoever for whatever reason you want. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Nice

I feel like unbreakable, tenacity, and flip flop is just such a potentially game changing combination. If they don't pick you up right away, either you get up on your own or you have such a high recovery status that you can get off their shoulders.
---
I only 3/4 upvoted because it wasn't default Dwight
---
Honestly, I would just save my shards.
---
I've had this happen to me 3 times as a survivor. 2 were with a friend and I said "Watch this totem end up being noed" as they were finishing the last gen, both times it happened we didn't cleanse any at all until it happened to spawn noed on me. The third time was the greatest and is hard to believe. I was on Yamaoka Estate alone with random team mates. We weren't doing very well but managed to finish 4 gens with 1 person dead and everyone else on death hook. I started doing a random totem for the hell of it and it broke right as the last gen finished. The timing was so close that it was impossible to tell if the totem or gen popped first. I ran around and broke a few more totems and saw someone get hit and that the killer didn't have noed. Two of us escaped but the third guy died. The end game screen showed they had noed... I apparently broke the noed totem at the exact time the last gen went off and didn't realize until the survivor who died was laughing in the end game chat about the timing being too perfect.
---
Console. Enough said.
---
HybridPanda. My favorite by a mile.
---
Haha
---
I mean who doesnt love ignoring every mechanic a survivor has to escape? Its SO fun being chased by a Nurse, just as fun as Legion was! Once both find you you WILL die no matter what! How interactive and fun! They cant nerf her either without making her power useless, and the common "Just use stealth 4head" sucks because any half decent player will find you an you will die
---
fair, though this is my 4th reddit post so cut me some slack :/
---
I like Tap's Beat, Dwight's Chute, and Ghostface's Blood, but the others are really meh. Why is Wraith's face branches?
---
yeah console is a nightmare
---
"How do you like it?"
---
**The Plot Twist that Nobody Wanted:** That's actually the Nurse's thought.
---
Welcome then, do you have some questions?
---
Were you the obsession?
---
You get more points chasing and hooking other survivors. I like to use perks that encourage me to be distant during unhooks to activate.
---
Is it really that bad?
---
It depends on whether they have their online status set to ‘appear offline’ or not
---
Rancor and Haunted Ground both notify the survivor as soon as they apply.
---
Nothing at all as all of the perks are useless besides Remember Me but even that's  a stretch. Just save your shards for more useful stuff
---
"I was thinking about calling it "all work and no play makes Homer go something or something""
---
I mean, it's better than just letting you go into stage two on your first hook. 
---
At least you can get a few more Boldness points before you get hooked and camped again.
---
Huntress', it's the most brutal one imo.
---
(They're all fully healed though)
---
It should be up to each individual killer how they approach a situation. There's no one true solution to every situation
---
Oh, shitpost, cool
---
This romantic reunion needs to happen
---
whenever i see a blendette(do not confuse with Claudette) i know several things as survivor:
---
- i'm gonna be left dying on the hook cause she will camp the hatch
---
- she will get off the gen with slightest heart beat even though we're red ranks and there's obsession in chase
---
- she will self care instead of doing gens/uses self care as if it's 2017
---
- she will be the first one to cleanse the sickness and the one to dc when she gets hit by corrupt purge
---
- she will be the one dropping pallet on injured me when i'm in chase
---
- she will dc if she was found and downed first
---
as killer i know one thing:
---
- blendettes die in the basement or get a pink mori that i will solely use on them, no one else. just to send the message, ya know
---
Right. Survivors want to blame everyone but themselves when they lose. Why harass ppl over a darn video game, it's not that serious.
---
What if he was avoiding him so he *wasn't* tunneling?
---
99.9% of anti-SJWs are toxic

You’re right that’s fucking ruthless
---
I mean.... have you seen [THIS?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztxEHtrgTRg)
---
Cat in the Hat is perfect for horror.
---
Favorite is legion's. I like the way the survivor actually tries to fight back in that one.
---
Least favorite is either hag's because it's gross, or Trapper's because it's uninspired and boring
---
Anyone else having buggy menus/lobbys more than usual?
---
My favorite one is the clown’s mori. Dunno why I just find it creepy in a way. My least favorite is probably the trapper’s sadly. Always felt it could be a little better

---
Ghostface Because he takes a selfie
---
hah
---
You've got the match wrong
---
The nurse causes pallets to cease existing
---
Cancerous is obviously too far, and his messages are deleted so I assume he was being a dick about it, but that is a fairly toxic build you're running there so I do understand why he was making assumptions about your playstyle. As a killer main though, keep up the good work 😂
---
Perhaps I need to rewatch but I don't think my opinion will change
---
You hate you for this joke.
---
Do what you want I just like to get bp and pip. Hard to with 6000 points end game and one chase one sacrifice. And I'd be bored af.
---
It's hard not to have a good time playing Wraith. He'll always be a favorite of mine
---
Pebble, Wake Up, and Pharmacy?
---
Freddy never stood a chance.
---
Nurse's mori is the best. or maybe i just have a choke fetish so my opinion is biased.
---
also Michael's. i'm no fan of his but hot daym harder, daddy.
---
oh god i used to wear chokers, forgive me for these comments, daddy issues speaking. Hag has best most brutal and goreish mori.
---
what's yours, op?
---
What character was he?
---
I need to know for... science.
---
I literally said these are just opinions. 🤦 The internet these days. 😂 I'm not forcing you to read it or agree with it. You don't even have to like it.
---
I love it when survivors stay at the gate and I down them and kill them.
---
I hate it when they stay at the gate, get downed, then DS me and tbag before leaving
---
I think the fact that the survivor tries to fight back is reflecting the fact that they’re probably the most human of all the killers. Of course the clown, Michael, etc are human, but they all seem more like a force of nature than a normal person.
---
I agree with the trapper and hag to an extent
---
How's the nurse unbalanced?
---
Can someone help me I got the error 302 and I'm on xbox
---
My friend used to main her because self care till he could get it into someone else but he used it after running the killer around so me and everyone else could gen rush but he would only camp hatch if he found it and he knew that we opened the exit before he found it and if someone got on the hook he would go to save them instead of camping hatch
---
Omg. 🤦 Whatever about the main part. The point is that I play both all the time. I didn't want anyone to attempt invalidating my opinion because of which I play as.
---
What if he attacks by running?
---
I’d say that it’s because he tastes their fingers lol. 
---
Yes, unfortunately the trappers isn’t very good.
---
Thanks
---
Shiiiit you right 😂 but fr it is a pretty good mori
---
Yep. It really do be like that. 😐
---
If only Wraith had a decent Mori animation
---
that's one person. i speak statistics

Nurses are either noob or god tier. If you face the latter, you’ll learn that they need nothing but their own skill to kill you. A god tier nurse has proven to have patience and wit. They are to be feared.

oh, true. the lil bitch slap Adiris does is extra cute

I’m more of an Ohmwrecker watcher. He has a YouTube channel. Pretty corny, but good player
---
Can I be honest the crooked sounds way cooler then the hillbilly
---
you bother me with your stupidity. 
---
one person to play blendette like any other survivor instead of how blendettes usually play. statistics say people who play blendette are trash, can't run killers around and ready to sacrifice their teammates to save their own arses.
---
N-no, not really.
---
Whoops I was thinking of empathy. I'm gonna go sacrifice myself now.
---
Fuck. If it weren't for the rework, I'd now have no reason to buy Freddy
---
I mean if you call back to the first movie Billy does shoot Jamie and Jamie only gets injured so...🤷‍♂️
---
I can definetly relate, it doesn't make sense to still get hit while already being through the window
---
I get the Devil's Rejects vibe with that song lol.
---
I'm going to take a guess that the game itself wasn't very long. One major factor in the killer scoring points is being able to get multiple hooks on survivors. If they died on their first hook, the killer is awarded fewer points, as they have fewer opportunities to score hits, hooks and uses of their powers.
---
I speak my mind freely, therefore I must respect the rules of the /r/karmaroulette
---
Legion, you can see the bloodlust in their actions, relentlessly trying to gut them no matter how much they fight. It really captures what the entity wants as servants
---
+++ cute. I hope they also change Freddy’s mori with his rework.
---
Not sure what he plans to do with it though.
---
I mean does he have phone service in the entiys's realm or something?
---
Sloppy butcher, spirit fury, enduring, save the best for last is an interesting combo. Sloppy wastes time since people have to heal vs legion now (you can catch up to them without sprinting), and the other 3 perks help shorten chases for faster downs and for more hits when you’re in frenzy. The drawback is that you can’t hit your obsession until later in the game or the perk is useless.
---
I've played for about a year and a half so I can't say I'm smart with the game
---
That'd do it. Thanks!
---
This but not ironically.
---
i hope they change Trapper's and Wraith's moris cause these are literally same =\
---
I instinctually dialed 1-800-273-8255 after reading this.
---
Do you play on console or pc?
---
Hag is so brutal that it earns at least a top 3 coolest moris 
---
But leatherface’s mori is so satisfying to use and is really cool to see
---
That makes sense, just the unwillingness to give up killing this person goes to show that.
---
You will need a headset, as playing as both the killer and as a survivor put utmost importance on what you can hear. The sound of a survivor walking through bushes, or the heartbeat signalling the approach of the killer can make or break a game, depending on how quickly you can pick it up.
---
noooo oh god not what i meant
---
okay, that's useless
---
Exactly, I love the leatherface mori
---
No it's my fault for missunderstanding I get it now
---
How are The Nurse and The Spirit different, gameplay-wise? I'm considering getting The Spirit, but if she's just a worse Nurse, I'll get The Plague instead
---
yeah thats what they could do where he appears on screen but yeah i forgot about the height thing completely
---
When you hop the window but the game lags and pulls you back so you get hit and have to jump over again
---
Definitely the opposite. They aren’t gifting me with bloodpoints
---
There’s endless possibilities for moris, the only issue they’d have is fitting into a small enough time frame.
---
I agree that most advice is gonna be subjective.. personally I recommend, if not playing killer, then watching high ranked killers on YouTube or twitch. Seeing what killers do when you play survivor will help you understand the full scope of the game better and will therefore make you a better player!
---
I've ALT-tabbed out of the game before thinking I was on my first hook. After about 10 seconds I checked to see if someone was on their way to save me only to see my character being pulled into the sky. Nice.
---
would be cool if they made paid mori animation. but then there would be too many moris in game. F
---
It captures the character well enough I’d say.
---
He probably has a collection or sum
---
This is obviously Freddy’s basement
---
I struggle. Especially if I’m in a game where my entire team got our asses kicked and basically no gems are done. I gotta get points somehow.
---
90% of survivors nowadays: Gens? What're gens?
---
I'm not one to critique art much since my own isn't great and it feels unfair, but the gun is in a great spot to be the immediate focal point and has good dimension to it but that feels lost by the time the eye reaches the body and especially the face. I think changing the angles so they're all based along the same perspective lines would really help the dynamics of it. 
---
Overall, you did great, and I hope we get to see more work from you in the future.
---
Check the second picture, I got 5800 points in sacrifice. I usually let them unhook and run off safely so I don't think it can't be that. Also they got all 5 gens and escaped through the escape gate so I feel like it was long enough. Is it possible they cut off pip rewards if I disconnect? (I crash on loading screen like 1/4 of the time, thanks BHVR)
---
Kinda like how Clown collects fingers?
---
I don't have any of these survivors or killers. Which of these would you guys suggest? My brother says dance with me or mad grit
---
That’s a thing? Now I’m going to run it without any exhaustion perk, just to screw over my teammates
---
Downvote. This is actually made by u/Chattywindow Lmao also the dumbass watermarked it with his Instagram
---
not sure if it affects team mates, but it definitely affected me :(
---
keep in mind this was around 2 weeks ago
---
They’d have to be some pretty damn good moris for me to pay for them lol. 
---
It’d have to be something like this [this is what a good mori should be like  ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Ewb3MojAs)
---
You can buy characters that aren't licenced can be bought with game play ( iridescent shards).
---
Yes, you can buy auric with steam wallet
---
Tbh I just leave instead of doing a free hit I get why people  do it but it seems a bit dickish to me seems more like you’re giving the killer a hit because you think they’re shit and wouldn’t have hit you otherwise maybe im just looking too far into it
---
Teammates spending the entire match searching for ruin instead if trying to do gens.
---
Yeahhh, they all probably have a collection of some sort
---
Doom slayer isn't gonna be in mk11 at least not within the next year
---
And he won't be In dead by daylight ever
---
What did I just read and should I notify someone
---
I like to look for them on open maps right at the start to get an idea of where peeps are
---
The broken key doesn't show anything unless you have addons. And you don't see items picked up from chests in the endgame screen so they must have brought it with them.
---
unfortunately, flip flop isn't that great at what it does. 50% of the wiggle bar full is pretty amazing, but that's only if you are 100% recovered, which is impossible to achieve without unbreakable (Recovery stops at 95%) and at that point you are already off the floor. There are very few times where the killer leaves you alone long enough to get flip flop useful, but not enough to get you up with unbreakable. It is good if you already used your unbreakable and you position yourself in a corner away from hooks.

Fat
---
Doom Slayer isn’t evil though... He kills evil... the entity would be screwed if Doom Slayer ever entered his realm.
---
I’ve seen the same, even had a third that was relatively close. I felt bad for the killer.
---
“Honey that dress was ruined when she bought it mhhhmmm”
---
Get the picture of him with the knife though
---
Nurse: What's a... loop?
---
Wraith: ***elephant screams in invisible***
---
no
---
Even better
---
Person you've hooked twice:
---
**Decisive Strike**
---
**You down (-2 stacks), hook, and kill them**
---
**Obsession now dead**
---
What's worse is being that one guy who does gens, then when someone gets chased, they comes STRAIGHT TO YOU ON THE GEN.
---
Like, guy, go the fuck away! 
---
I'm tryin' t'work here!
---
My only question is if there any things that are universally frowned upon on reddit?
---
It's the dbd equivalent of walking in on someone in the bathroom
---
But dont complain when you get the shits.
---
dunno
---
 [Welllll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZqo4OZ0Pqs)
---
Can’t tell if this is a joke or not
---
Quentin was sick and tired of his shit
---
Your post, apparently....unless you're new.
---
More like P.H.A.T. Amirite?
---
If I was, I would've given myself the damn perks I wanted right away instead of delaying it for 30+ bloodweb levels.
---
The gun isn't bad, the detail is good. However, the handle is far too wide (a pistol grip is only slightly wider than the bullet) and the fingers should curl back to point at the doctor. The finger in the trigger guard is extended further than the rest, and so only the last segment should be visible. This throws the perspective off and creates a disconnect between the barrel and the grip. 
---
Also, it seems like you wanted to center the perspective on the shoulder, judging by the vanishing point the barrel lines follow, but the lack of arm separation (forearm/upper arm) and the lack of perspective in the body, as u/ketterno mentioned, make it seem more like two drawings spliced together than a single piece, and confuses the eye. 
---
It would probably be helpful to use a reference, especially when attempting perspective drawings like this. I routinely take pictures of myself in the poses I'm drawing so I can see how different body parts connect and scale.
---
That's good advice, thanks
---
I can't already see the Wraiths crying
---
Gens, you?
---
I like to use one blink nurse on resets. You get to practice predictions and the survivors feel like they outsmarted you.
---
That said I also 5 blink base skin pumpkin nurse with run noed to meme swf. They rarely get it though :(
---
Brightly colored cosmetics? Looks like it's your fault ^^/s
---
That’s one of the main reasons why I use tier 3 empathy. I can see anyone whenever they’re hurt so I can tell who’s getting chased. If they start running near me, I know to move.
---
lmao
---
All I want is Shirtless Myers
---
They should redo trappy and wraith.
---
Yes ruin is easily countered if survivors can hit the skill checks but it's effective for killers because a good portion(from what I have seen) of the time survivors will waste time searching for ruin instead of doing gens. Although a killer doesn't need ruin to win, without gens tend to pop pretty quickly
---
Me: *still don't have a level 40 survivor*
---
Me: *Only two survivors over level 15*
---
Game: **bE iN A cHAsE aS dAViD kING fOr 200 seconds**
---
Ditto. And Bond so I don't run the killer into someone else.
---
Just drives me crazy when I KNOW they know I'm there, but are running the killer to me to get them off of them.
---
Like, is you or is you not ignorant here?
---
How about just a not stupid looking robe? :)
---
Still think they should implement johns pig costume
---
haha free bird
---
Sounds like low-rank Wraiths because
---
1. they're camping
---
2. you saw them
---
3% increased rarity per prestige. P3 = 9%.
---
The difference is really negligible, I P3'd my killers for the accomplishment and bloody clothes.
---
Now, if you aren't sure whether or not you are going to prestige, getting a character to level 50 full perks is a waste of bloodpoints. 
---
I made up my mind really early so I would level up my killers to 50 using the cheapest route possible and prestige immediately, spending something around 1.500.000 per prestige.
---
As long as you follow the rules of each subreddit, everything will depend on the morality of each person, do not get carried away by the numbers and be yourself
---
They are both similar in the set where they both have chase control and can get short chases by using their power but Spirit has the ability to win and lose mindgames with her power and because of how borked audio is in most patches, she can be hindered by her power. Nurse, however doesn’t so much capitalize on survivor mistakes but makes reads to down players and the survivors have to make themselves hard to read to escape her. 
---
In a nutshell, Spirit is like Lite Nurse. You’re still strong and can be mildly oppressive with your power but there’s more wiggle room for the survivor to escape. With the same knowledge and read-power on Nurse, there is no escape.
---
Hell yeah, I will finally complete my Houdini build
---
When I'm hiding behind a wall but the killer can see dat thicc ass
---
Then buff stealth
---
I love wraith but playing him without enduring and spirit fury made me want to give him up. I went through several games in a row with at least 15 pallet drops.
---
Where did you get the 3% info? I had never seen that before
---
I'm sorry. What's a....loop? Also, can you go through stuff? Bc I can
---
Without a doubt
---
eugh that’s a nasty ass, she doesn’t even wash 😖
---
See what I like to do is speed-limiter (more bloodpoints, chainsaw does the same damage as basic attack), chainsaw only, noed Leatherface. I've had survivors baby rage on me for playing with noed, which is the best thing ever when *I'm only using my chainsaw anyway*
---
Yea, breathtakingly broken.
---
No need to add a run to the meat when it’s got built in flavor
---
Obviously the cosmetic would come with hair. It is a head cosmetic after all.
---
I tend to just ignore salty messages. My time's valuable to me, I'm not gonna spend it worrying about what xXx_PuSsYdEsTrOyEr69_xXx thinks about me. I just wanna gauge how often I'm gonna get salty messages during my learning phase. Thanks for your reply! One more question, in a game about being hunted by a deranged psychopath, what's considered unsportsmanlike?
---
I really like the idea of adding in a mini game to change things up. But I fear it’d be too much of a radical change from the core game that they wouldn’t do something like this.
---
play meg
---
Sauce?
---
great idea, and laurie can have built in ds
---
We're sorry to hear that. Could we get your name and number so we can get back to you at a later time?
---
And it is nerd shit.
---
Thats 2 people not on generators though. I don’t know the rates, I wonder where it breaks even
---
Trapper should grab the survivor by their hair and lift them up, bring the hook of his club to the front of their neck, and behead them.
---
Couldn't be closer to the truth
---
I go for a late great skill-check, so if I hit it awesome but if I don’t it’s still a good skill check anyway. 
---
Been playing against ruin almost non-stop lately and it’s really been helping me reliably pull em off.
---
Something special to laurie like she does everything faster in the killers heart beat
---
Hey, just to say thanks for answering in those threads.
---
Started the game two weeks ago thanks to GamePass and I’m having a blast playing both sides equally. Keep up the good work !
---
I've managed to get one of these as Freddy and I was absolutely baffled as to how much of a dumbass they were
---
One thing to keep in mind is you lose all of your add ons and items and kind of start over (perks too? Can’t remember. Only prestiged ash). So if you got some ultra rare items use them up! And you get slightly more rare items in your web once you do but as others have said it seems negligible.
---
i appreciate bing bong bois bodyblocking windows and pallets but not trapping someone in completely
---
Just had to deal with a Meg like this last game. She was being CHASED by the killer. Hillbilly was right on her ass, and she just takes me off the hook. And of course, she doesn’t have borrowed time or anything. Then she had the nerve to get downed right after he smacked me.
---
She’s pretty damn thicccccc.
---
Stealth is boring.
---
Get over it
---
yes
---
It was just a little discussion calm down lol.
---
It's been like that for a while now.
---
TopKek
---
Only tribial brain dablage!
---
Look like the best haunted ground placement ever :)
---
Sometimes they are trying to lead the killer away so someone else can get the save. If you got four that leads one to pop generators. Depending on the state of the game it can be a smart move. Need more gens done? Get that dude off the hook. Only one and someone’s on it? Might as well try to be a homie. But yeah sometimes it useless and not sure what people’s plans are.
---
&gt;Where did you get the 3% info? I had never seen that before
---
Can't remember so I just edited out.
---
This guy got farmed
---
We get a new chapter every three months there is always stuff to buy after. You just have to decide what you may or may not want. Nothing is crucial and you can unlock perks on the shrine so essentially if you wanted you could buy no dlc.
---
Yeah, she is worse than Nurse, but every other killer is worse than Nurse, so I don't see why you compare her with Nurse. She's still one of the strongest killers in the game, she's very fun to play ( more fun than Nurse ) and she's WAY better than Plague. With Plague, you will end up playing like a Trapper without traps if survivors decide to not cleanse.
---
I love all of these skins. Feng min legit looks like a fairy princess tho.
---
r/cursedcomments
---
He is a more boring worse Spirit. Prove me wrong. 
---
I he is the only killer I have no interest in playing. He needs a rework. The spirit is him but with a much more interesting design.
---
Not just pig cosmetics either, but ones that give black clothing. The difference might be marginal, but having a dark coat instead of a bright red one might raise her stealth capabilities.
---
This would completely ruin skins variety we see in game (more than already is, look at you Claudettes). Everyone would play that one survivor with better passive. 
---
Currently I can play any survivor at will because they offer the same gameplay.
---
I think Franklin died that way
---
I made the switch from Kate to Jane. I never look back now. ;)
---

---
It means that I'm the entity
---
I just got the achievement for this a few weeks ago in a similar scenario. It was so lucky!
---
Quentin has a girlfriend doesn’t he
---
Botany and We'll Make It does stack. WMI's description is there to state it doesn't stack with itself.
---
Unless it's licensed
---
The shittiest bug I have encountered is that my game crashes every time the game picks Ormond for a map. Apparently the serial size for one specific piece of foliage is different from what the game expects it to be, and the game crashes.
---
I play Feng with none of her perks...
---
I don’t get it
---
I get trying if there’s one or less gens left. But my post is more aimed at the people who just watch the first survivor that got captured get facecamped. Ex: Leatherface caught Dwight first and facecamps him. Everyone else proceeds to crouch around and watch, still 5 gens left. Dwight dies then Leatherface catches someone else and repeats the cycle.
---
That would be terrible. He'd have 150% movement speed.
---
Pig sell late...pixelate.
---
What game are you playing?
---
Ah I see
---
What do you mean? Licenced perks show up in the shrine. If you mean shards to buy characters I forgot to mention you could do that too. Except for the licenced killers of course.
---
Space Coconut has become kinda shit now, he uses NOED every game, makes constant mistakes in every video that I watch of him and on his Hag perk tier list he put Courlophobia higher than MYC...
---
Yeah. Sometimes I think it’s people just giving up and trying to farm points. I mainly play Xbox and it just went up on game pass so we’ve been getting a ton of face campers and newbies trying to get every single save.
---
For me thats the problem everyone is a skin other then p3 claudettes you have all skins and then invisable claudette there passive arn't going to break the game just small boostes that you get for pick a charater
---
After playing with Tenacity, Flip Flop, Unbreakable and Boil over for dozens of the games to get progress towards the "Cutting Out" achievement: Unfortunately it really isn't (wiggled out 0 times).
---
I really like the game, but BHVR have given me very few reasons to believe that they might actually be competent. The last big things that were added that really added something were the EGC and before that, the Spirit who is in my opinion one of the best designed killers in the game, and few decent perk changes in there. But the Spirit came out in September. I came from Smite, and I thought HiRez were bad, but BHVR have made so many baffling design choices that they have almost caused their own game to implode. After Legion was released, I don't understand how people even defend them anymore.
---
That's sorta what it's supposed to be. It's supposed to poke fun at all the horror remakes of the late 2000s, like how Scream 2 poked at horror sequels
---
&gt;one ever at all
---
Is that even English?
---
ok
---
Everyone just plays the survivors with the best starting perks anyways
---
The killer isn't some brainless ai who needs to think like that. Planning and making smart choices are a part of the role.
---
The licensed characters is what I was talking about
---
Nice play!
---
Somebody had to say it
---
There are paid dlc's (characters from movies) and dlc's that you can play with the currency of the game. Also... The best 3 killers are free
---
Absolutely
---
Its console nurse...
---
Yessir go head doc
---
I'm just saying who is stealth fun for? The survivor who holds the crouch button and walks around a rock? The killer who walks between gene with no progress and walks around other rocks? It's by far the most boring part of the game.
---
It's bad enough Ash is in the realm of the Entity. The Entity would go from 100% fucked to 200% fucked
---
It does but to such a small degree that it isn't really worth it unless you only play one or two characters
---
“Dirty hoe!”
---
Would this be a good build for Trapper : Hex : Ruin, Hex NOED, Nurse’s Calling and Enduring ? 
---
It takes some time at the start of the game to set up traps so Ruin is here to buy me some time. 
---
Nurse for spotting people having escaped traps, since Trapper isn’t great for spotting survivors. 
---
Enduring to help with chases since Trapper has no tools to win chases apart from trapping pallets and windows. 
---
And NOED because it adds a lot of endgame pressure. Could maybe switch it for that perk that lock down 3 gens at the start of the game but I don’t have The Spirit unlocked yet. 
---
I’m playing at rank 11 by the way.
---
Baby survivor gg ez
---
I think that's my favorite "getting hit by a pallete" sound in the whole game. Even if I'm frustrated with something, I always fucking laugh when I hear it.
---
"Mistsa shoots innocent civilian who just stated that the number 4 is the best number" Circa 2001
---
The biggest flex here is that you didn't hit them on the hook to BM back and showed that you're the better person
---
ara ara
---
Lmao which killer item is this
---
The problem with a different height killer to that degree is they would need to animate more options for the small killers.
---
From a business perspective it's dumb to introduce a killer that would require more resources rather than bring in a killer with a similar height that can just piggy-back all the current existing animations.
---
Though I'd love to see chucky make an appearance, I find it quite unlikely.
---
When you look at Ghostface
---
This is some of the most stupid stuff ive heard
---
Looks like Patrick Starr (The youtuber)
---
This has happened to me all day. Sometimes it misses when it should've hit. Sometimes vise versa. 🤷
---
It really does, and it does a better job of characterizing him. I might just be me, but the word "Hillybilly" doesn't imply an overflowing amount of intelligence, but the Hillbilly himself is implied to be intelligent and mechanically inclined. The Crooked can not only apply to his physically misshapen body, but also to his warped and broken mind.
---
I go for great skillchecks when ruin is up, which requires me to focus on the gen more, and once ruin is down I just chill and whatever I hit I hit. You just need to practice those skillchecks, especially as you go higher in the ranks ruin is near-omnipresent. It’s not really about getting gens done faster without ruin, it’s about actually being able to finish the gens before you get caught when ruin is up. It’s a lot harder if your pc isn’t as good: I just upgraded mine, and before I did it was almost impossible to hit the great skill checks, so that may be a part of the problem as well?
---
I don’t think this ties into Ghostface at all bro
---
I ran boil over + flip flop + tenacity + unbreakable + Alex toolbox for that achievement. Sabo all the hooks near a corner and shove yourself in that corner when you get found. Boil over makes killer think the nearby hook auras are just invisible, when in actuality they dont exist anymore. Run a decent amount of matches with that and you should be set.
---
wraith gang we make bing bongs for the people

---
You mean concrete?
---
&gt;Everyone just plays the survivors with the best starting perks anyways
---
When you are new. After one or two months, you choose which survivors you want to play.
---
I started with Claudette but haven't touched her since I P3d my Meg, Dwight and Feng. 
---
A lot of players choose to main Nea as well, since she has some cool cosmetics.
---
It doesnt affect on FL saves im almost certain.. but probably on other blinds
---
The entity Loves survivors.
---
The entity Hates it’s bastard killer children.
---
The entity Never showed us any love.

And so the cycle began.

**My Story for an OC GhostFace:**
---
Gregor Nielsen was born to very ordinary parents, who lived in an ordinary neighborhood, and raised him in a very ordinary way.
---
He went to school and graduated with a nearly perfect record, he earned a trip to a nicer college than he parents could have afforded, he graduated with another nearly perfect record, and then he went to work at a very well paying job where he did very well.
---
And he hated it.
---
Gregor found his life too simple. Too boring. Too normal. Too dull. He didn't want to live his life watching and dreaming of exciting movies. He wanted to live those movies. He wanted to do something.
---
Something risky. Something dangerous.
---
He started chatting around online, talking to other bored and crazy individuals. He met someone, someone who wanted help performing a crime they'd make movies about: the bloodbath of the century.
---
The idea of killing didn't appeal necessarily, but the bloodbath of the century? The idea of living the movies? Of carving his name into the history books with blood and death? Of pitting himself against the law, against the government, and against everyone else to show them all exactly what he was capable of?!
---
It thrilled him.
---
But... they didn't want him. They found someone else. 'Someone better'.
---
Better? He was infuriated. He'd show them better.
---
When their stupid plan failed, because of course it failed without him, he planned his own murder spree with the help of a new, and more respectful, friend from online.
---
Behind the silent plastic scream of a Halloween mask, he watched his victims carefully, he drew out their suffering, and he made sure to make every murder into a masterpiece; something you'd take a picture of. Something straight out of the movies.
---
For three months he held the city in the palm of his hand. Nobody went out at night. Everyone shut their windows and locked their doors. He loved it.
---
Of course, he wasn't perfect. He messed up once or twice. One victim managed to make him bleed, another somehow survived six stab wounds to the chest and had seen his car as he drove away.
---
But when he was done 12 people were dead and he'd filled the newspapers with his exploits. He'd struck terror into an entire city... 
---
and he'd set in motion a legacy to outlive him. 
---
Because even as the police beat down his door, his accomplice was using the money from his boring job to set her own plans in motion with a new partner.
---
Secure in the knowledge he'd started something bigger than himself; he put his overly dramatic costume on, he got his favorite knife, and he lunged at the SWAT team as they burst in; one last movie moment.
---
But that wasn't the end. After the screams and the gunshots and the cold, black silence, Gregor woke up; still in his costume and still holding his knife.
---
He wasn't sure where he was or what had happened, but he felt *it* watching.
---
"An audience."
---
And through the Fog he saw four defenseless figures. 
---
"The rest of the cast."
---
It looked like he wasn't done making horror movies yet. There was time to make more masterpieces.
---
I believe on the steam they said 32 meters, way too fucking far if you ask me.
---
I don’t get how anybody thinks most M1 killers are better than legion. 
---
Yet everyone who says these kinds of things is always rank 1 and can consistently 4k as other M1 killers.
---
Okay you play meg say she got a passive that when she is in a chase she get momentum the more she runs the faster she gets but never getting faster then the killer and it only stays for 10 seconds or until you escape the killer that would just be a small bonus for play a suvivuor you like
---
The best part is when you spawn besides the totem 1 in a million
---
Yes everyone would say that, and if they don't say she's underpowered they would say shes pretty balanced.
---
Samination?
---
Half of your opinions are just flat out wrong though. You called hag fast which she has slower than base movement.
---
Specifically I’m referring to when they’re just invisible all game, happened to me today while playing Freddy
---
A spirit having a FIVE second stun after coming out of phase??? Then why is she even phasing in the first place. To catch up then to lose people again? 
---
I can’t believe what I just read honestly.
---
This.
---
And the guy below me I threw off the cliff because he couldn’t land a counter grapple.
---
It's a dev's personal headcannon that nurse and wraith have a thing.

I mean they do use pistols in the movies so ...
---
Can they detect you through obstructions too like Jungle Gym Walls?
---
I mean, all you did was list what billy can do, not really why hes overpowered
---
lmao fhe one ace is superior
---
Kill me, I’m in constant pain.
---
It's enigmatic how regular salt can make you feel a little bad but then you get someone who uses things like 'libtard' to insult you when you beat them. It's immaculate how I could feel pity for someone like that.
---
Only thr killer can lag switch because they are the host. You probably just had a really bad lag spike.
---
That's your internet, as the killer you're hosting the game.
---
Yeah that’s me, me and my friends freaked out when we realised we could be Mafia bro’s
---
Exactly! Then I’d run around aimlessly so the killer can see my scratchmarks 😞
---
shit, time to run pop goes the weasel I guess
---
The killer was probably freaked out they were going against the ace mafia
---
All 3
---
U hook one up
---
1, 2, freddy comes FOR YOU
---
He killed the rest of them but actually let me go, I guess he realised he was no match for The Don
---
WELL POP THAT BITCH AGAIN TIL SHES DOWN
---
If I sat in a locker the whole game, waited for you to open the exit and then walked out the door then I would say that I lost that game. Wouldn't you agree?
---
***Pigxelated oink.***
---
"Excuse me can you please not? I'm trying to get the electricity back on."
---
"Oh, sorry, I'll let you finish."
---
I've been at green and purple ranks and they still do that. And communication is a thing, you know.
---
how do you define "overpowered" if not by abilities and downsides to those abilities? he practically has none while balanced killers have amount according to power.
---
Survivors don't need to bring items, killers do

Hah I'm starting to understand cause every game all the survivors are just disconnecting. Thanks again.

That happened to me yesterday with a camping huntress. I teabagged and flashlight clicked at the gate when everyone left and ended up dying in a weird way and got picked up. Someone sabo’d some hooks before they left and I was able to make it off and escape. Don’t know if I deserved the win
---
Stolen
---
I am more the stand and die type. I like the diversity.
---
I just gave you the fourth Upvote... I feel blessed and cursed

Idk why you're being downvoted. Solo queing into any game that matches you with teammates you can't communicate with has obvious difficulties.
---
Please , don't.
---
OMGGG EXACTLYYYYYY!!!!
---
Give credit to the person who made the David skin if you're watermarking the image you fucking toaster
---
he can be looped like an m1 killer, you said before you can loop any killer, thats not really true, you cant consistently loop a hag or spirit or whatever
---
Leader is better imo
---
is it worth going for kills rather than just hooking everyone multiple times as a killer?
---
Xbox miggrts
---
...Why are you playing then? Lol
---
Yeah, my point
---
Didn’t know who made it, got the img off google greaseball.
---
OMG Space Coconut is a human being who made some mistakes and have some bad games, so because of that he's shit now ? Dude, just shut up, Space Coconut is probably stressed because he's gonna marry in 2 weeks, of course he can't be as concentrated on DbD, because the most important moment from his life is gonna happen very soon. He even said that he play bad in these matches and he said that he uses NOED because other stall perks ( aka Ruin ) are too laughable. Plus, he even doesn't use NOED constantly now, he changes his builds from match to match.
---
And stop spreading misinformation, he never put Coulrophobia higher than MYC in his tier lisr,  just show me where he put MYC lower than Coulrophobia, I bet you can't. He even put Make Your Choice pretty high, even if he considers that perk situational and he's right, MYC isn't too great even on Hag against good survivors.
---
This game is more alive on PC though and it doesn't require that much of a rig. I would never play it o  consoles.
---
The sweetest irony is that he's talking shit saying how you must need a safe space when he's the one having a mental breakdown over a videogame
---
Have to grab Mad Grit for those filthy body blockers
---
Definitely. I've personally always wondered why the devs went with Hillbilly instead of Crooked. 
---
The Hillbilly doesn't exactly sound scary (at least IMO) or describe him or his power in any meaningful way.
---
First custom killer idea I’ve seen in a while I really liked. Power is neat and the perks are cool and don’t seem too crazy. Resurrection perk seems like it might be too good but I know nothing. Divine shroud is cool and it’s not gamebreaking. The other perk is the one that would probably see most play imo. The other perk is really cool. I imagine it only triggers once per game and would it keep the totems stacks if it’s lullaby or devours? Could be deadly with those or the obvious ruin to slow the game down or haunted grounds. Neat killer, power, and perks. Could even make a custom survivor being that families eldest son that went missing.
---
Spirit even doesn't have the perk who block 3 gens, LOL. You should change Nurse's, it's useless on him because he has a normal terror radius.
---
I love Dweets &lt;3
---
Omg those pig cosmetics tho.
---
But... Dwight looks GOOD
---
Because you're not my dad and I do what I want.
---
Its not worth tunneling for a kill for the most part, you'll ultimately do better if you branch off and go for hooks since it'll mess up their team's rhythm. Hooking everyone will grant you more points and break up their progress
---
Yeah the thrill of staying just out of sight when a killer is searching an area is pretty fun for me
---
There is a very little difference in getting better addons. It should be rephrased to getting less bad addons
---
Don't act like a fucking child that's too stupid to come up with solutions. 
---
Give the nurses blink a cool down. It's not that hard.
---
but you gotta think about the likelihood of the spirit having teachable ruin/third seal/dh/etc. vs a perk they start with
---
this is iconic. point, blank, PERIODT
---
##DING DING DING
---
Right now, yeah, but just because he's bugged. Survivors shouldn't detect Ghost Face through jungle gyms normally.
---
*'Hits blunt'*
---
Question as a new player, what was it like before the change?
---
Bruh
---
No. 
---
Legion is easily mid tier.
---
you can. i do that cause as Spirit main i know their tricks. even without Iron Will you can just by realizing you can abuse her collision as much as she does lol. ginger, just run where it doesn't make sense to run. scratch marks appear with delay and sounds are fucked, she'll never know unless she bumped onto you and even with that it's just 1 hit and sprint burst you get. while with shit latency chainsaws down you behind corners and windows and you instantly on the ground. 
---
with Hag, pay attention to range of her traps. if it's big, avoid by tripping them and changing direction. if it's normal just look at the situation or change loop spot. 
---
i loop these two consistently.
---
cow
---
Legion gang is disappointed in this comment.
---
They're very fun to play. Try them :(
---
That's enough, Bertram. Go to your room!
---
Entity be like “mmm cow”
---
Watch ZubatLEL's last legion game on yt
---
Alright, seriously thank you guys for the assistance, it's nice to actually have some numbers to go on :)
---
What is your Houdini build?
---
Alright, I'll go ... for now.
---
It actually scared me, I didn’t even know copy pastas were even a thing.
---
Watch Otzdarva, he's a super huge Trapper main! He has a small Trapper guide on his YouTube Channel "Not Otzdarva"
---
You even have the sharp ruler :D
---
Depends on which platform you’re playing on. On PC nurse is unrivalled. On PS4 she’s a lot harder to master (I still haven’t totally mastered her but I did get pretty good with her). 
---
Spirit on the other hand is one of the strongest killers on console and is a joy to play as!
---
The problem with your build is that you have no ruin, you'll get genrushed every game against competent survivors, and if you do run ruin with these perks you'll have perks that don't help you in chases at all and you'll get looped until the end of time. Legion is an m1 killer nowadays and there is a reason spirit fury enduring is a must on m1 killers
---
It shouldn't be our job to provide them. Numbers like those are important to know and it should be BHVR's responsibility to make sure that players have access to them.
---
ZZZZ if only we could earn 350 bp at a time.
---
I ended at 1963 yesterday, missed bond :/
---
Claudette just making entire bits of the map invisible to hide in
---
I say yes, that locker stun skill is hilarious
---
Nurse is balanced. Sure she is op once you learn her but is really hard to learn
---
I’m mainly a killer main but when I play as survivor NOED does annoy me. If the killer is good and has been playing well all game but we managed to do the gens and he downs us with NOED I don’t get annoyed at all. Fair play. But when a killer is just really bad and hasn’t downed/killed anyone all game and then gets a NOED down after the gates are powered it’s just really irritating. But there’s nothing wrong with it, it’s just annoying :-p
---
Just leave the pig alone.....
---
For the Legion pay attention to the clothes they're wearing
---
If its a hoodie and a skirt, it's Susie
---
If its a black hoodie and black/dark brown pants, it's Joey
---
If it's a leather jacket, grey hoodie, and camo pants, it's Frank
---
If it's a jean jacket, a gray hoodie, and camo pants, it's Julie
---
Should've used balanced la-
---
Wait a moment
---
&gt; OMG Space Coconut is a human being who made some mistakes and have some bad games, so because of that he's shit now ?
---
Yeah he's been playing like shit. Even Croquedead, who you mentioned being a master at Hag has said the exact same thing, dm him if you want. It was my mistake saying that he thought Courlo was worse than MYC, someone, I think one of the hag masters said that he thought courlo was better than myc.
---
Listen, I like the dude, but I cant deny that he is not playing very well
---
Yes but what was being said was while that's cool and good, what if ash had reverse enduring, or claudette had built in self care. It's not that meg wouldn't get a passive, just that it wouldn't be as good as someone else, and given this games balancing history, there would probably be ones that are op af, and some that are worse than ghostface.
---
Ah yeah that's the thing, survivors not knowing what we have to deal with. And when it does happen that a survivor main tries out killer and finds out that they're the bad guys the whole time, it's sad m? :(
---
Cant believe they nerfed speed limiter billy. LF speed limiter is still pretty funny though.
---
So I see The Nurse, The Huntress, The Doctor, The PLAG, Frank with Susie's mask, Frank, and Joey with Julie's mask
---
That cute. Sadly many killer wont even get near the gate anymore because they fear getting teabagged
---
It’s ok bud, we all thought these things were wack the first time we saw them.
---
LOL yes, then I'm like 'the moment you go for that save and he sees you, I'm letting myself die' only to hear that scream of you getting hit as I get sent off
---
Is dance with me worth getting? Got plenty shards so trying to get every half-useful survivor perk I can.
---
Question as a new player, what was Tinkerer like pre-change?
---
Perfekt 5-7-5
---
&gt; Nurse is balanced
---
&gt; Sure she is op once you learn her
---
Nurse, the person gets strangled and he tries to fight back but it's no use, and in the end Nurse goes 'hush' lol
---
Hag has the most brutal one to me, but I have to level her up still to enjoy her fully :(
---
And Legion is the most realistic killer you can have, so that mori is special to me
---
Why do I want to do nurse’s mori on OP?
---
Iam disapointed by the lack of elephant noises
---
Well you saw what happened, come to the realization that you shouldn't expect them to be nicer to you and go ballistic, nobody leaves.
---
I am at red ranks. He is the 3K's to be fair.
---
Sometimes it makes the killer waste more time on you so that someone else can be rescued during end game collapse. But if everyone is safe, I usually just leave. UNLESS it's a nurse, I always let them hit me because it's hard to play her on console so people really struggle to do her dailys.
---
You can't grab someone jumping through the hatch any more.
---
To grab someone you quickly press attack button. Not a long press (as when you lunge), that will end in you simply hitting them.
---
Deep Wound time
---
Plot Twist: Its Haunted Ground
---
That makes her inherently broken. She's only hard to learn because they made her controls so clunky and hard to use but once you do learn her she breaks the game.
---
What did he type? It says it is deleted?
---
Not that I know off?
---
Please tell me this isn’t what they changed sonic into... it’s even worse
---
What did the post say? It was deleted?
---
&gt; balanced
---
&gt; is op
---
wait what
---
Because no one goes for your bait.
---
Okay a built in self care is usless because it's a normal perk I mean stuff like little stat boosts like faster healing for Claudette or fast actions for Laurie while in a terror radius nothing to over powerd
---
She looks like a thot
---
I wish I could tell you but that place is a damn labrynth, I never know where I'm going.
---
I got this.
---
I haven't tried the new Legion, but the old one? I was addicted. Usually when I play killer I switch and switch between 4 or 5 killers, if not more. But when Legion came out, I was hooked and played just them. I saw a stream once of a guy going against Legion and was shocked to see that Legion's vault animation is slower. I hope my eyes deceived me, cause that vault gave me that adrenaline rush, but I fear for the worst, because it's not an unknown fact that the Dev's updates can screw up a killer lol
---
Maybe I am just biased since I have yet to try the new one, they have 115% movement speed now which is good, but the vault, man :(
---
One really good Trapper streamer I know uses the Block 3 gens perk. I'd use that, Enduring, Spirit Fury, and maybe Brutal Strength ? Don't get reliant on NOED.
---
Well, of course, you drain your evasion pool over time
---
I can relate
---
Answer this question for me: Are you a horny 13 year old that masturbates to dbd chicks?
---
I love both, the leather one increases stealth which is nice.
---
Something about "I still won't give in" and other shit that made no sense out of context lol
---
INB4 Deadhard like Tracer Recall at the perfect time
---
Well, you could argue that the reason we get licensed killers is because we want them, much like how the entity picks it’s killers.  So yeah tbh, we very well may be the entity.
---
I'm blind (Not actually but y'know) so I'm just gonna ask
---
Where is Myers?
---
he came to my Piggy heaven sub reddit and asked us to convert him or some shit? Really weird.
---
Makes me feel like a claudette wannabe
---
Better hope it isn't a Clown with a Mori
---
And you can't deny that he has a wedding coming soon, probably DbD isn't even top priority right now for him. 
---
I couldn't care less about Croquedead opinion, he seems to talk shit about everyone lately. Btw, I saw a match of his Hag and he played like a rank 20, your Master Hag got 360's from a Laurie 3 times in a row, Space never played as bad as him in that match LOL.
---
Croquedead has anyway weird opinions, he said that Spirit is just a Billy with a cooldown ( comparing Spirit and Billy, 2 completely different killers, he clearly doesn't know nothing about Spirit and he's still talking shit about her ) or saying that Deliverance is a broken perk ( from all survivors perks, you really think Deliverance is broken ??! ). 
---
Again, Space can't play optimally in every match, especially in this period of his life, he still has good matches through and he will still have. And stop listen to Croquedead, he changes his opinions too much to have a relevance.
---
If you had entered he would have seen you closing the locker regardless.
---
I mean, I saw some of Bubbas who had BBQ and yet refused to move an inch away from the hook even when a gen right next to them was being fixed
---
So, I went on google and searched up "when will ghost face be released forum"
---
Here's what it had to say, in big bold letters: June 18th, 2019
---
Ghost Face will be available on all platforms on June 18th, 2019.
---
I've been seeing people ask this every single day, and not one of you can do a quick google search. I didn't even know what day he's getting released but going on the DBD official forums seems like a great place to start. God dammit
---
 june 18th
---
When David decides to fight back to Frank
---
&gt; (from a survivor perspective)
---
Insidious and noed probably.
---
Spam crouch with the other survivors for good luck
---
Sorry sorry
---
Oh I thought you meant because Bubba is a cannibal and you didn’t realize that was the point of the name, sorry(:
---
The entity is the name for God on the lips and hearts of all crows
---
Yeah a way to sort would be pretty cool
---
Farmer john
---
Ace is stunned by the glory of the tree
---
Pig=upvote
---
Well i'd prefer a stick movement to wsad for survivor any time. But for some reason dualshock is kinda wonky in DbD on PC
---
Only the Dwight and I escaped flawlessly
---
...Well somebody had a bad day. All they were asking for was the release date, no need to act childish.
---
thats my swf group except everyones a diff character w the rooster shirt and red bottoms, and one of us is pimp david w the rooster jacket
---
definitely!
---
Kinda defeats the point of trying to look like OG Ghostface...
---
See my point in case
---
True but I would much rather have you working on a generator to ensure that the other three can all survive
---
Sooo... with this cosmetic set for huntress are we going to get some sort of lore about here being related to Deathgardens Stalker and Trapper being like Poachers Great great Grandfather?
---
Woah dude calm down lmao. I remarked that Space has been playing like shit recently, it doesnt matter whether he has a wedding or whatever, i just said he was playing badly, which he was. I don't subscribe to all of Croques opinions either, I just agree with him when he says Space is playing like shit recently. Calm down dude geez
---
Hol' up, what they do to my billy boy?
---
The kid represents everyone’s first time being mori’ed by a brand new killer
---
You could've done the dick move of trying to open it in front of the killer too!
---
 I play on PS4 as well and it tripped me up too lol. You can hold R2 to lunge with aim assist towards the survivor, or pressing it to just do a quick swipe instead. If you click it very close to the survivor, you can pull them off hooks, generators, and exit gates and such :)
---
Just keep in mind that dead by daylight, is well... dead by daylight. So there’s gonna be times where you pick people up when you don’t deserve it and when you’ll swipe at them instead of grabbing. It’s just how the game is, nothing you’re doing wrong if it happens. Hope this helps!
---
Killer’s terror radius is suprisingly thicc
---
That's just the community though. Constant toxicity :/
---
Pig&gt;anyone else
---
Piggy, Piggy, Piggy.
---
You run and jump over the window.
---
I’ll definitely dodge if I see the same sweaty tryhard survivors.
---
Gotta get those cosmetics.
---
Yeah I feel it, idk I’m new to the Reddit community for dead by daylight so I just assumed people wouldn’t be as toxic on here...? Guess I wasn’t thinking clearly  but it’s all good lol
---
&gt; The Pig's reverse bear traps slow down the game so much. I've played against her at least 10 times now. Every single time I had one put on me, I only (and just barely) got it off on the very last trap remover. It's NEVER the first one. Not to mention she can also patrol the trap removers. They also tick hella loud after some time. The Pig's crouching feels almost as fast as your walking speed and even when she's not in stealth mode, she's faster than you. 
---
*Laughs in Oink*
---
Probably compensation for the poor souls who actually already unlocked it and are now tortured by it appearing in every bloodweb.
---
At least what I feel like.
---
Man, people still get my stats wrong. It doesn't show odds for removing them, it shows you how often survivors remove things at an x amount of tries. There is % on a ox it is one box has it and 3/4/5 don't.
---
you typically want 1 healing perk, 1 to help with looping/running from the killer, 1 utility perk, and 1 perk to help your team. 
---
A good build would be something like: Adrenaline(to heal), Dead Hard/Balanced Landing(to help with looping), Iron will(utility), and Borrowed time(to help your team). 
---
Another build that's similar might be Botany knowledge(with a medkit), Dead Hard/Balanced Landing, Bond, and prove thyself. 
---
It really just depends on what you want to do. 
---
Strongly advise against Self care and urban evasion. Even though they do technically allow you to heal yourself and hide from the killer they teach you really bad habits. Eventually you will have to loop the killer regardless of how good you are at hiding, and self care takes an extremely long time.
---
its funny cuz he said "can't find the answer anywhere"
---
Like, how can you be this failure? I can't imagine the struggles these people have in life with easy tasks.
---
They nerfed the bloodpoint gain to 50% rather than 100%.
---
Clearly it was OP
---
It's just that the most campy killer of the game has perk that endorses leaving hooks
---
Ruin is kinda necessary in the high ranks (1-6). You should probably get Hag to level 40 so that you can unlock it for the rest of the killers and then probable level up Hillbilly to level 30 for Enduring. Some other good perks to unlock for all killers is Nurses Calling (Nurse, lv. 40) Spirit Fury (Spirit, lv. 30). If you're having a little bit trouble finding survivors, a good "training wheels" perk is Bloodhound (Wraith, Lv. 35).
---
Also the Hag is kind of a noob stomper, in higher levels she can still do good but people learn that you can crouch to stop her traps from setting off or that you can get rid of them with a Flashlight.
---
It does help alot, both comments make this easier to understand.
---
Okay listen, say fuck you killer, say cock licker, put a cactus in my throat. But NEVER say fuck you Pig. They went to far.
---
Yeah I get what you mean now
---
Something we can all aspire to be.
---
Oh you don't want to see the rest of the Chat Log...It's a really dark road back there. The pig needs more respect on these games man.
---
What even is that
---
My dude, no killer in their right mind would go away from the hook if every other survivor is hiding behind a wall next to it. I will gladly go for a chase when I see one, but if I see no auras on my BBQ I ain’t walking away from the incoming hook rush
---
Are you on ps4?
---
wraith with BBQ. 
---
if you come out of invis and hit someone it's 1k BP per hit. pretty insane.
---
Sad times :(
---
Thanks!
---
Oh don't worry, when the Freddy Reworks happens Pallets are going to be a nightmare for survivors.
---
It actually stresses me out looking at it
---
Yeah! I love that she's an updo kinda gal, but she needs some fun variety.
---
And his opinion about Hag doesn't matter right now or what ? He said about Hag being reliant on survivors mistakes months ago, he said that at his own Hag guide as an answer to someone who said Hag still depends on survivors playing stupid to win like almost any killer. 
---
I don't know why you answer me in the first place, when all I said about Hag was true.
---
Yaaas, an iconic look for an iconic queen.
---
force him to M1 you through a window or something rather than use his chainsaw. if he M1s you that will give you some good distance to cycle to another loop or hide.
---
Yhyh. Only just got Reddit, but wanted to post some of the clips I have saved on my phone
---
Must have to do with how the entity isn’t great at perfectly recreating locations from memories and the rules of the normal world
---
To be honest most of these are pretty mediocre since "Mad Shit" only provides an advantage in two situations and two situations only: basement meme-builds and encountering altruistic SWF
---
"Loop with me" is okay when combined with Lithe or Q&amp;Q otherwise it's meh
---
"Forget me" is pretty mediocre as you're preparing yourself for a situation you really shouldn't be in and even then only the top killers can utilize it fully with high mobility.
---
And "Tenacity aka Unbreakable 2.0" is alright but as I said only has full potential with Unbreakable which is receiving a buff soon so you might try it.
---
Just my opinion btw
---
Kinda makes me wish they could liscence Jason. I used to play F13 a ton and while a lot of people say dbd is broken, in its current state F13 is arguably more broken. Coupled with the legal battle they can't release any content updates either, so the game's pretty much dead for me. Would like to see how DBD would've handled our summer camp dwelling friend.
---
They need to add a killer with gun , similar to huntress .
---
Found that dude that takes everything on the internet seriously lol
---
Thanks ! 
---
I like how he explains what he is doing when he plays
---
Yes, it did sound like a nice plan, I even brought that sabotaging toolbox and hook distance offering, sabotaged two hooks around me and he STILL managed to carry me to the hook.
---
*shrugs*
---
I like having every perk on every character. It’s part of completing everyone. That’s why I have every perk unlocked already.
---
Not really mate just feel like this sub is quite literally the embodiment of teenage lust
---
Thanks !
---
It’s arranged alphabetically amongst the colours the perks are.
---
No offense to legion players but I wanna stick to Oink Oink
---
When you see a TTV/Twitch name with a SWF group.
---
SEXEH reference
---
Thanks ! He looks very good at the game
---
what
---
This can only happen when there are only 8 pallets on the map so you only made it more difficult for your team and not made it “fair”
---
I just said in the post that I already knew FarmerJohn ahah , thanks anyway
---
I know I just made the mistake of starting with Huntress, Legion and Myers before I finished all  the others to P3 and know every Bloodweb feels like garbage.
---
Oh wait. I read the post completely opposite. I thought as a survivor the killer was a turtle and as a killer the survivors were turtles. :D
---
ok its time i stop browsing by new
---
I think if you click the touch pad it inverts the camera, so if it happens just click it and it should fix
---
It's like a fighter pilot games. Up is down and down is up.
---
Isn't Mad Grit for the first time in shrine? If yes, you already have it unlocked amd it gives you 250k bloodpoints then go for it
---
Ahh. 
---
Well if you’re aiming to have everything on everyone then in the long run you’ll be fine. 
---
I’ve learned my lesson though for the switch version: Bubba and David first, get them bloodpoints!!!!
---
Ok I'll check. I just got done with a game so I'll look next game
---
Last week had PGTW. DS, and bond. You mean the week before last week?
---
Thankkkks! I was searching for a good dbd educational streamer🙏🏼
---
I play with one hand.
---
Joke cosmetics that make you look like an idiot. Haha I felt this one in my soul
---
Minimum pallets increased from 6 to 8 if i recall correctly. If there is not enough space to place all 8 it overrules the minimum distance requirment. It looks very powerfull but for the entire game you have only 8 pallets to work with.
---
I feel you bro.
---
I feel like chucky’s special thing about him would be the fact that he’s small as hell. It would help him mind game but might be a slower killer due to that (and his little legs)
---
Lorddddd.. never mind.
---
`Y u did not jumo thru window?`
---
Dwight and Jane cosmetics?
---
What killer are you trying to main? I know I usually use Freddy and go straight for the toxic dream state before I go for kills just to slow the game down a bit.
---
Sex pistols requiem
---
how is that supposed to work dude
---
Yeah I wasn’t sure about that. I know he would definitely have the longer vault time and get an animation of him climbing to the top of the window or something along those lines.
---
Just stun the mccree while he is using high noon
---
I got remember me was that a bad decision?
---
I guess the Cat in the Hat brought Douche 1 and Douche 2 today instead
---
What else did they say?
---
One in the chamber, CoD style. If you hit, you get another bullet.
---
All jokes aside, I have no idea how that would be balanced.
---
I mean, you would be too, if you had been there in person
---
https://youtu.be/jSo4uFj-BM8
---
This is a really good, short video explaining the game!
---
Mom Jokes to the 21+  sexual extreme level of sick sadism. Its sickening. It's that bad.
---
What is the percent ratio of this working?
---
I highly recommend farmer john.
---
So far 100% I’ve tried it on about 10 people and I’m rank 7
---
I think you and sniphskii need to grow up. This question gets posted every single day, and it gets so annoying that able-bodied people cannot do a quick google search. Like I said, I didn't even know when he was released. I just did a quick google search, that's literally all it took. And, at the end of it all, it's toxic? Really? 
---
I had a great day. I studied hard, hung out with a few buddies, and I'm taking it easy for the night. But, hey, some random dude on the internet reads a comment the wrong way, gets defensive, and calls you toxic. It's sad to know that your parents spent all this time and money raising you, for you to end up as narrow-minded as this. Truly sad.
---
What else we’re they saying? I’m intrigued now
---
I wish the devs would actually do something about toxic cunts like these. People like these guys 
---
make people not want to play the game
---
I just said in my post that I already know Farmer John ahah , thanks anyway
---
I wish there were more perks like Diversion, it and that locker stun are the only ones that add completely new gameplay mechanics to survivors.
---
Very sickening things that I didn't even think it's even possible unless they live through bondage themselves.
---
Dude that would be awesome if there was an offering to make the fog super dense for survivors only so killers could be more menacing when near survivors.
---
I would recommend you to buy doctor DLC. easy BP farm
---
I’m playing Michael solely because he’s my favorite Killer in this game and I’m hoping for Jason. So far using noed sloppy butcher iron grasp and thrill of the hunt only because I have nothing else
---
Bruh Wraith sucks tho. I've never lost to him lmao
---
Yea but we know it's not going to be possible no matter how much we report or say they would just get a warning and walk away. Do it again. There are the good people and the negative ones. But this one I have seen to the extreme.
---
Yeah dude sorry but I stopped reading halfway once I realized you’re taking something so light, far too seriously and overreacting. I’m new to the Reddit community but I barely see anybody talking about it, so clearly you’re over-reacting. Have a nice night bud.

It’s really amazing seeing pc after game chat, lmao, there seems to be a lot less toxicity on ps4. Either that, or the extremely toxic people just don’t feel like typing out messages on console, cause the worst i’ve been messaged is being called trash as killer, which is fair because I was just doing a daily for nurse
---
Also, downvoting somebody’s message(s) simply because you don’t like what they have to say... isn’t that a bannable offense 🤔🤔🤔
---
I said MoM is the only crutch perk for survivors not in the whole game :)
---
Deserved it for running self care
---
Which perks are in the shrine?
---
If we get zombie related characters I would REALLY like to see a punk from Return of the Living Dead. And if lucky get Tar Man as a killer.
---
Agreed, there are way too many punishments for other people DCing, losing add-ons as killer when you barely even got to play a match, de-pipping as survivor cause the killer DC’d early game, etc. it’s quite frustrating to be honest
---
I got my first one in the 30s
---
Yeah but what's the name of that clip?
---
Got knocked back down to rank 14 cause of games like those
---
Head On would be perfect
---
I'm sorry baby I love you
---
All you Chucky fans seem to forget the one detail of putting survivors on hooks. How would a little doll accomplish this I wonder?
---
No, the most boring part of the game is running circles around pallets, followed by holding M1 on generators. 
---
Sneaking around a gen with the killer right next to you is a blast.
---
You know that you simply have to destroy the totem? Dont camp the gate because its obvious where you are then and killer can chase you out. If you see that somebody got downed because of noed, dodge BBQ by staying close or hide in a locker and then look for the totem. Killer rarely checks noed totem and even if you dont unhook them you can make it possible for someone else.
---
The game doesnt end when the gens are done. This person most likely helped you get to this point so you should help them.
---
No one would win if everybody would just think about themselves.
---
You know some old weapons can only fire once in 5-6 seconds right  ? A musket is one of'em .  an old themed killer using a musket would be balanced . He also has a bayonet installed on his weapon so that's how he attacks from close distance . He will right click to aim just like huntress and shoot .
---
*"It involves murder...DUN DUN DUNNNNN"*
---
-the Cat
---
her controls are mostly muscle memory, but quite still straight forward. The hard way to learn her is figuring out how to predict survivor movements and how to deal with sight blockers.
---
Homeboy is like a demon, he’d just throw them up there after he drags them😂 might seem a little unrealistic though. Maybe a dbd Chucky would be hitting the gym doing squats 24/7... that’s if a Chucky is even able to build muscle lmfao
---
Yeah, Michael isn’t bad. I haven’t used him much yet cause of my play style. If you’ve played mw2 I’d definitely give huntress a try, she won’t disappoint lmao
---
To Amanda?  YOU SICK FUCK! I definitely DONT play against Amanda with one hand too
---
I only play Killer when I need BP sometimes, and every time I realize that Survivors are way more toxic it’s ridiculous
---
Right? It’s insane I thought killers were just being douches but no lol
---
Is this some kind of joke?
---
Dance with me: Useless alone, it's very synergistic with Q&amp;Q or Lithe.
---
Tenacity: Too situational and really useless in that.
---
Remember Me: Got nerfed to death. Can be fun in endgame builds.
---
Mad Grit: Situational. If you want a basement build just use Iron Grasp and Agitation, they help more than it.
---
It was made as a joke lol
---
Introducing a new role: the Savior
---
I think NOED and BBQ, becasue I see survivors mains complaining the most about these. Not all of them, just some entitled survivors who still think "BBQ is OP".
---
&gt;	If you wanted you could buy no dlc
---
Unless you want to play as a licensed killer

I use Bond instead of SC so I can easy find someone to heal me

HOW I COULD HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT ONE COMING
---
Lol, of course it was a dwight
---
It could be the vengeful spirit of a civil war soldier
---
The entity gives him super strength? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
oof
---
imagine getting this worked up about something this dumb. its genuinely embarrassing lol maybe delete this man
---
Well, Wraith players will choose not to associate with them, just like how China refuses to acknowledge that country that definitely doesn't exist.
---
Downing a survivor with NOED and the timer is halfway done or further is an instant 4K for the killer
---
The best part is when you're doing S. Fury + Enduring and you lunge-hit them as they stun you, but the pallet breaks and cancels your wiping animation allowing you to easily get a second hit, basically turning the pallet interaction into a gain for the killer
---
"What are you doing, shortie?"
---
I don't actually think Chucky will ever be in DBD but I'd love to see Chucky just ridiculously somehow jumping 8 feet high heaving and slamming survivors onto hooks
---
What in the world is this from? Is this a manhwa?
---
Credit it now then.
---
Ah, a classic.
---
Personally I play basement trapper a lot and that's probably one of his most reliable/fun builds since he's pretty weak. 
---
Also Corrupt Intervention (block 3 gens) is the Plague's perk, not spirit. But you should get Spirit for spirit's fury if you're gonna be using enduring
---
I disagree, i never needed Ruin on any killer after the "learning phase".
---
Who shit in this guys cereal. I do like the assumption of a higher calling while condemning everyone to H E - double hockey stick, classic Incel.
---
In awe of its size
---
Ideally the second chase you get from BT will buy us more time to do that.
---
Unless it's Leatherface, Hillbilly, Nurse, or Huntress, saving a camped Survivor with BT is usually a better move than just leaving them there.
---
This is next level
---
And the Test Subject head might look a little more human at a cursory glance.

Beautiful spot on cosplay

Frank's Mixtape final song
---
If it ain't fun, that's a problem with the game. His complaint is valid.
---
Yeah you come back with 4000 hours after a month and a bit off... ooo rank 15 are we and you get a lobby of new players... and you know it within like 2 seconds of entering the game.
---
I disagree, I find it super rewarding to sneak around when a killer is near and not get spotted.
---
Diary of a part time Freddy.
---
The Fuming Mixtape has, and I quote, "Dark beats, violent shreds and unfathomable vocals from another world"
---
Tik Tok memes dark for the mind, it makes people violent, and it's full of unfathomable lyrics so it has a possibility of being canon
---
I don't think Billy is fun yet saying that gets lynch mobs set on me for daring to think different from the circlejerk that he's a well designed killer with a high skill demand. 
---
What you find "fun" I don't give a fuck about. I personally find stealth to be far more fun as a Survivior than running around in a circle until you drop a pallet, rinse and repeat ad infinitum
---
I took care of Amanda and she was doing great.
---
Alright, doesn't matter what you do or don't give a fuck about, it's still gonna be a valid complain.
---
 I like stealth too, but it does make the game just that much slower and can be hell for everyone
---
This. I run WGLF so I’m mostly unhooking you for the bp, but I always run it with Borrowed Time as a courtesy.
---
I’d love to see the guy from scream as a new killer.
---
the perk made add-ons that effect charge time more effective, at (I think) 5,10,15%. It really only mattered for his charge add-ons and trapper's trap setting tools.
---
How I think I default vs how I actually default
---
Slower games benefit killers massively. And buffing stealth doesn't make the game hell. Buffing stealth leaves a decent power position for Surviviors and opens up looping to more nerfs/reworks without gutting Surviviors. 
---
Think about who it indirectly nerfs too. Nurse, Spirit, Billy, and Hag. 4 of the top tier killers all of which have been able to patch their stealth weakness with the strength of anti stealth perks vs the weakness of pro stealth ones
---
Lol who downvoted this guy just asking a question? Lol. 
---
I think the console edition comes with 2 paid DLCs (Hag and Doctor, as well as Nurse and Huntress who are free on all platforms) and then Freddy, Leatherface, Myers, Pig, Spirit, Legion and Plague are paid DLC (+ Ash and Ghostface). They're 7 bucks for a chapter and 4 bucks for singular characters.
---
How to do it to em by moving like that:
---
Step 1: Act like you're having a seizure, but are really trying to do what you are trying to do
---
Step 2: Lose about 20% of your braincells
---
Step 3: Yeet Fortnite Legion Banana Default Meme Tik Tok Apex Legends
---
The entidy is doing it cuz it feeds off emotions. Not for entertainment!
---
Dude a killer similar to that one story "The Most Dangerous Game" would be lit.
---
Imagine being THIS serious
---
it boosted specific add-ons but it was a lot of work to code and didnt work on all killers so they reworked it.
---
But they can fight back in real life, so jokes on you
---
See about that ping I've noticed that some survivors join with very stable ping like 50-60 but then in the game they can sometimes jitter about even making me question the hits I get like windows for me now that I got better wifi I went from 2mbps upload and 10mbps download to 70mbps upload and 80mbps download so back to what I was saying I can not longer rely get those hits when survivors fast vault windows in swing range and it throws me off but if I would have to find middle ground it is probably a mix of hitboxes and lag
---
dont listen to this guy he's plain wrong. I dont know your issue but flashlights work exactly the same for the surv no matter which addons.
---
Cough Cough **MORI** Cough Cough
---
"benefit the killers massively."
---
 Eh, no. Not really, if by benefit you mean more time they have to kill, sure, but also you wanna see what good stealth does in this game? Rotten fields. Looping and chases are just better for the game
---
 Stealth isn't going to make any of them worse  overall, and it isn't gonna make anyone(with the exception of like... Freddy or Doc) better either.
---
 This game, even if you take out all the anti-stealth perks, isn't made for stealth. It doesn't work, and wouldn't ever be fun, not to mention it take a full rework to make it even slightly enjoyable.
---
DS, BL and MoM / Rancor.
---
vPinchr, the king of downvotes on this post
---
I’ll
---
Dog Legion is best Legion
---
He will also have a generator teleport. Map pressure is probably the most important attribute of a Killer, so even just that will be potent if it is not too restricted. As for the traps and pallets, slowing survivors is very effective to end chases quick, and they've confirmed that Freddy won't need to stop or slow down to place his traps. His pallets on the other hand are not like Doctors that vanish when you get close, they only disappear when they are used, so you can probably get a free hit from one if a survivor tries to loop with it.
---
Maybe the real entity was the friends we met along the way
---
"Nothing...just chillin'...killing" :P
---
It's the pattern of it. The irregularity of it all...
---
Do you, though? Do you REALLY?
---
nice!
---
Doing this but you overestimate the survivors and they insta break it
---
Assholes are assholes, those dark rogues are cast out of normal Wraith society don’t you worry

The Killer is running Hex: Claudette cosplay
---
My dude ghost face is just the mask
---
Drake sucks and JoJo is amazing, you used the right template
---
they're mad because you did more objectives than they did
---
I wish haunted grounds was buffed, right now it's out performed by devour hope, it's honestly not that good, it's temporary noed that only activates when the survivors want to activate it. Survivors will literally just go immersed the whole minute, so its only good in a chase... but if you're in a chase... there's a 50 50 chance they're already injured, so it's a waste. Maybe they should make it 120 seconds like plags gen perk, or maybe let one of the totems stay up even if the other is broken, like having two instead of one
---
The Legion is just teenagers/adults wearing normal clothes with masks with knives though
---
Sub's rule number 3.
---
You know what would make this cosplay better?
---
A custom made mask and another hoodie
---
Please don't take this in a bad way
---
mikey sad
---
Where's bunny feng :(
---
this looks like the guy that camped be because "he was tired of survivors running away" 
---
what the fuck else am i supposed to do??????
---
Lol, no. Because you are incapable of reading. That is borderline below the retardation level. Try again kid. Go look up how to do this or run back into your safespace.
---
That would make sense, it would be like cabin in the woods
---
Mario, Luigi, and modern day Peach
---
If this ain't the most relatable shit
---
I like the idea but it would be a significant buff to Surviviors. 
---
My idea was to remove items from the game and replace them with abilities. Obviously these abilities would be heavily defining of a playstyle, and it would lock a character into this kind of role. For example Laurie would be like a protector kind of Survivior. Claudette would be a healer. Meg would be a chaser. Feng and Tapp would be objective teammates.
---
But it's a lot of work, would be a new dimension of balance, and would be difficult to implement without backlash
---
Micheal Senpai please don't put me on the hook **U**w**U**
---
this is more of a symbiotic action, The killer gets hit points and the survivor gets protection points.
---
He choking
---
Omg yes
---
Dude is Mori-ing himself
---
Silent Hill it seems
---
Is Ace worth it? Does he suck? If so is he fun to use?
---
There abilities should have something to do with their lore like meg has something with running tapp can get information really well but items should stay the same but lose a perk slot
---
*French snorting intensifies*
---
Of course it's not going to be fair, killers are powerful.
---
Any one killer (even Freddy or Legion) with only one perk is going to be more powerful than a Mettle of Man + Adrenaline + Decisive Strike + Balanced Landing survivor; because one killer perk &gt; four survivor perks.
---
That survivor won't even manage to reach a loop.
---
/s
---
Aww, little toxic player is getting mad
---
Good question.

maybe
---
Haddonfield's fence wants a word...
---
Good cosplay, just a bit triggered at one thing.
---
Your GF's mask, the mask is 3 pieces held together with the ... string things (I think), and she (or you) just put eyeholes
---
Otherwise, good cosplay, just that tiny detail
---
bruh
---
Head on/ Poised , Dance with me, Lithe, Quick and quiet
---
Some of the saltiest survivors I've ever seen are after they abuse bugs (eg; can't Mori, getting killer stuck in pallet - still happens, unable to pick up) and blow through three instant-heals while teabagging in the exit gate to four-man escape.
---
I play on Xbox
---
That's why you keep getting entity displeased! because we're all fed up with the bs!
---
I cannot afford a proper gaming PC now,so i'll continue playing on xbox. But thanks for nothing I guess
---
You can report them.
---
Also if you can't handle words just close the post game chat...
---
'NiCe tUNnELiNg'
---
For me, it doesn't matter how good the cosplay is or when you started or those types of things, it's good as long as you tried, you're having fun, and the character is recognizable
---
Good cosplay BTW
---
It's actually more gen efficient to self-care while someone else repairs, as you don't get the 20% efficiency loss of 2 people repairing. If you have botany(2&amp;3) and heal someone, it's more efficient, gaining up to 4 more charges on a generator. 
---
Whether you self care mostly comes down to if it's worth being full health over extra gen repair, among other things.
---
Pig and Tapp&gt;Laurie and Myers
---
It's LeviOsa not LevioSA
---
Ik you can report them but reporting barely ever does anything,  and I never said I can’t handle people being butthurt over losing when the opponent played fair. But people who say this kind of stuff deserve a punishment
---
Thank you for sharing this with us and not saying it was you
---
It’s so simple, but so good at the same time.
---
You can also buy characters through the DLC page for the game on Steam. Some characters have a bonus cosmetic dor getting them this way (Kate Denson for example gets a black variant of her default shirt).
---
So that what his pink add on does
---
The only time I like to use NOED is to surprise tea bagging survivors at the end of the match.
---
It'd be cool for me if NOED was changed to no longer be a hex, but to only work for one hit. That'd be perfect.
---
Three words
---
Dwight is beautiful
---
Imagine trying this on someone that is capable of thinking while playing killer
---
&gt; reporting barely ever does anything
---
It does if you got proof.
---
&gt; But people who say this kind of stuff deserve a punishment
---
Agreed.
---
Doesn't happen to me cause its PS4 and I can bet half the players are kids who got it for free last October and think they are hot shit and play like their life depends on the game.
---
Funny thing is, I had an argument about DbD with a guy, who told me he's a computer science graduate 26 y.o. with 1000h in the game. Funny thing was, I never asked about that. He didn't ask me about my education, career, age and experience in the game either.
---
P.S.: also he was "downvoted by rank 20 keyboard warriors"
---
New Perk skin: Woodwarden, blocks the exit with trees instead of the bloody entity tentacle things.
---
It got nerfed so yeah...
---
It's tough because it's all grey areas. Most salty survivors will say any amount of tunneling or camping is shit. They also get mad at certain perks or combination of perks. Some characters powers can be used in a shitty way. On the flip side survivors have infinite loops which killers hate, body blocking, teabagging, and gen rushing.
---
While your at it someone make a change.org petition to save the Zumzizeroo
---
Nurses calling, although it doesn't reveal mending survivors, is still useful just for the fact that with legion people are going to be injured a lot. Sloppy pairs well with this because it increases the aura reading window of nurses.
---
Well of course.
---
**WTFWTWFWTFWTF**
---
The official release was in 2016, there's an anniversary event coming soon. It was the switch release they were talking about in the dev update.
---
Exactly, your backstory seems like it would fit a different character entirely
---
trappers a bit of an odd one in that his mechanics are really simple, but to play him well you have to know how survivors think. so its counter-intuitive that you play him in the tutorial, when for new players he's pretty useless.
---
when i first started playing dbd i had no luck with trapper but now i find i can clean house with him, mainly because i just think 'where would i go from here when playing survivor?' and then place traps there. 
---
on the other sides of vaults, not on hooks but where they will run if they're unhooked, and on pallets near generators being worked on are your the best bets. you can essentially remove some of the best loops from the game just by trapping them so unless one survivor is going out of their way to disable traps (which also means they arent doing gens, unhooking other survivors, or cleansing totems) you can make your job a lot easier. 
---
i see hes never ranked above C tier on lists but when played correctly trapper is amazing imo. being able to trap your ruin, and exit gates really helps game slowdown.
---
I use ruin, nurse's calling, agitation, and iron grasp, and have gotten a 4k for almost every game.
---
Haddonfield but all of the gens are near the Killer's house
---
I could feel the pain behind the lmao there
---
And There was a pallet on the left
---
Been looking to buy Tenacious, so that's cool.
---
Bruh I just unlocked tenacity with Tapp.
---
What a fucking Twist. Just think about it this girl plays as Jill in Scream 4 and a survivor. We have her as a Survivor and we have Ghostface. 
---
Yes she’s not known to be Ghostface in the dbd world but remember Ghostface works with 2 people.
---
Did everyone bring thick mist offerings?
---
What is the point of this? I don't get it.
---
Ngl, i haven't seen scream 4. The last scream i saw was in like 2004
---
I like to use him - he can be pretty clutch by finding keys to open the hatch
---
It's a beautiful night outside
---
Crows are chirping
---
Survivors are looping
---
On nights like these, survivors like you
---
**Should be Mori'd to Hell**
---
I honestly feel the opposite. If I can get at least one kill cus someone decided to be a teabagging exit camper and not just leave then you deserve it. And going back for anyone currently hooked is a decision you make. I have never had a problem with noed as survivor but the only time I really get use out of it on killer is if they are being scummy.
---
Trash from Return of the Living Dead would be my pick.
---
Oh I agree with that for sure. NOED is the ultimate exit gate teabag punisher and I have no problem with that whatsoever!
---
I rarely play killer, but when I do I love when survivors are this dumb. 
---
As a survivor, I stay near the gate in case a fellow survivor may be lost or I want healing points if I know someone injured may come. I run (without t-bagging) as soon as the killer approaches. I played earlier and was the only one who lived despite 3 of us in the exit at first. The fourth was sacrificed already.
---
I leave if other survivors are all safe and are all butt dancing together in a circle. I don’t want to be a part of that. I use it to say hello or thank someone only, not to celebrate against the killer, who may be knew or have just had a rough match.
---
Still worth doing them. When other survivors see the broken totems, hopefully they'll remember to do their part too. That's how I remember to do them when I forget about them. When I see others have done a few.
---
So additional details: "if your power gets cancelled 3 times, you can wield a pistol for 10 seconds or until you down a survivor"
---
"Hey killer, so i've been running around for a while now so please hook me"
---
That guy probably got stuck in rank 19
---
This is definitely a troll
---
Straight Outta Badham
---
Crazy motherfucker named Romero
---
And yet he still gets more pussy than you
---
Sub's rule number 3. This isn't a place to shame other players.
---
Yet so hurt remembers a post made weeks ago...lol. The influential impact I have on imbeciles is incredible. "Inconsequential" when you bring up rank in most of your posts...lol. Just pathetic. Listen kid, you really need to do some research on how not to be a dumbfuck. The fact you dont know how to properly fence on the internet continually shows your young age. Know how I play huh? Just like how you DC when you fail to be a little twat. Yet again, you say rank is irrelevant and then the sentence after you talk about it in significance...hopefully you OD on tidepods and later do the world a favor. Have fun! :)
---
&gt; WMI and botany wont work together, since WMI doesnt stack with other healing speed perks
---
False. It stacks with everything that speeds up healing, be it item/add on or a perk.
---
Well you should it’s good
---
Just be thankful he plays like that - you have a 75% chance of not being his victim.
---
I also saw yesterday someone on instagram being proud about getting 3 4ks in a row. I mean, what elsw exists? Dows it count as a different result if people rq? Nurse main here, pls explain.
---
How did I just know you'd have a comment on here already?
---
You’ve just oinked your last goodbye
---
I'll give it a shot.
---
I never knew this could be done until now. That is awesome!
---
The best thing is you can do this with a couple killers and still make it make sense.   
---
Ghostface's strands can be his "ears", wraith's twigs on his head, hags hair, doctor's electric shock, freddy's snow
---
I think it'd be cool as a power too.
---
Imagine super dense fog spawning in some area, probably on top of a gen, w/the killer being able to decide where precisely. Would be a neat mind-gaming/stealth killer. The thing that might seperate this from clown is the lack of distortion in vision, instead it could just make it where you only see things nearby (5 meters?)
---
Just please don't add a slow in the fucking fog this time lmao. Clown fucks me up.
---
Oh hey, I encountered this guy in-game not too long ago. Super fuckin' weird guy.
---
I mean, doesn't that seem to apply to a lot of toxic shitheads out there who are playing the game though...?
---
Huntress would be so pissed
---
Seems hard and stressful
---
We can try and see if it works with characters I got gifted... You know, for science?
---
Better:
---
You lose all your tokens getting your obsession down and the she/he DC's
---
As a 🐖 main, I was super excited for 😱 but now I would rather have new 🐖👕👖
---
Spirit is a chase killer. Wraith is a stealth killer. You can have your opinions, but the only comparable aspect is invisibility.
---
Tapp player pro tip: Don't run any of tapps perks.
---
what abt piggy
---
Meg has nothing compared to Jane
---
that's the joke
---
Leader is better because it doesn't require an injured teammate, but I would probably just run self-care instead of those.
---
If you were playing badly he prob felt sorry for downing you so quickly. Killed the others because they put up a good fight. Also he could of been doing daily rituals and prob thought you were a newer player so went easy on you.
---
I found it

---
Solidarity had potential but went all in the WC.
---
They could just buff to 80% at least and make it that it works with medkit and especially other kind of healing bonuses. For example, it doesn't work with We'll make it: the 50% bonus will be just 25% because of the 100% speed progression, and it doesn't count if someone is healing with you.
---
I'm still kinda missing a "bitch" survivor in the lineup. I mean, almost every classic slasher sequel has them, so it's time for DBD to get one as well
---
Self-care is completely different of a healing speed bonus lol
---
why does it look like you took a picture but the Legion ran up and posed before you took it
---
That would be cool. Make the killer basically invisible but have thicc fog that follows him around and he can use his power to spread it out in a large area infront of him. If a survivor is inside of it, he gets a notification and the fog lasts longer
---
It freaked me out too at first, but you can tell he’s just playing with the boot in the second picture. From child abuse to cute kid pic😊.
---
There are no infinites left. And most of the times "gen rush" is not a real "rush"
---
Oh yeah baguette crumbs
---
Im all for a snarky, bitchy survivor. Closest we have is Ash, and as much as I love him he's more bitchy like whiny. Not like rude and tough. Chanel would be the whole package.
---
Because I am everywhere...
---
Y’all Amanda is not cute under that mask
---
How does Freddy’s manipulation of the Dream World seem ‘out of character’? It’s more out of character for him to pull them into the Dream World, which he does right now. If anything this makes him much more accurate.
---
Not for heal speed, just consistency. Neither of the mentioned perks make much of an impact.
---
Equip Dying Light as well, you will never find them.
---
correction
---
 Leader decreases the time it takes to heal you by 1-(1/1.25) = 20%
---
Amazing idea, and love the idea of the mori too.
---
Are you me
---
I'd run neither and get used to being injured. It'll help your play a lot. Dropping self-care and running only adrenaline for self healing, at least for a week or two, is the best decision you can make to improve
---
Well the new Mettle of Man update requires you to take “protection” hits in order to get stacks so if players are body blocking more for that reason you know why and can’t complain.
---
Zubat's chat would like to know your location.
---
Sloppy Butcher is an alright Ruin alternative. BBQ is obviously really good. I also really love using Surveillance on her.

Im pretty sure that when he says "Infinites" he refers to those really long and safe loops that can be done really easily with no skill at all, there still exist, and normally happens with a window not being blocked in certain places like in the groaning storehouse and the torment creek's main buildings.

Repeat the pointless argument again, please.

Can't you just send him a message directly?
---
Silent Hill killer confirmed?
---
I don't know what Thrill Of The Hunt is doing here other than some bonus points. I'd take Dying Light for memes or a detection perk
---
Maybe one day.
---
I think Ardetha left DbD if I am not wrong.
---
The rework looks way more in character. Opinions of balance and fun aside, you can't seriously think current Freddy is a more accurate portrayal, right?
---
Pig and Feng... I want it NOW.
---
Dance with me and lithe are actually really good if you know where to go and the killer likes to mind game a lot. I dont recommend using it by itself though.
---
Or ruin to ~~give you more time to find the obsession~~  slow the game down, just a lil' bit
---
Exactly. You're not going to be doing any hitting besides for the Mori so extra chase points is better than nothing.
---
I mean, I'm sure you are tough enough to handle being slapped in the face with a fish.  
---
  
---
It doesn't you want to just let others slap you in the face with a fish, and it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.
---
I was chat banned and he was gone from my recent players by the time I got around to it unfortunately.
---
Just make it such that hitting a good will result in the gen being locked for 30secs so survivors have to do other gens and rotate, and make ruin extend that time to 50/70/90secs. That should keep them busy.
---
Oh heyyyyy, your the Dwyane rock Johnsons versus a grizzily bear guy
---
I run bbq,ruin,nurses and save the best for last, it's a sweaty build and I'm not proud of it.  But man I get 3k to 4ks all the time.
---
Fuck that was good
---
They could have made ghostface Jill Roberts from scream four and she was a “bitch”
---
then you play on Gideon meat plant where not not even the fucking killer knows where their hex totem is...
---
Spirit and Ghostface are the best two. Doctor and Plague are also really good    
---
Hag’s Mori would look way better if it was more graphic, it just doesn’t look right. Huntress, Trapper, Wraith and Billy all have fairly lame looking Moris
---
Is it okay if I use that picture as a Profile Picture! Not only is Huntress my Main but it's cute!
---
What does Save the best till last do again? It's more of end game perk I'm guessing.
---
Preach it brother.
---
Surveillance seems to be a common perk to use on her, I just hope is shows up in the shrine soon so I can get it. Thanks for the list, I'll most definitely be trying them all out!
---
He just wanted to, happens a lot to me. I dont get it. My friends are like do you know them, I'm like idk what's there name!? 9 times out of 10 I dont know them.. I just hit them with the gg thanks.!!  My friends get mad lmao.. 
---
But I've given people hatch plenty of times as killer like here ya go...one time I gave this claudette the hatch because I killed her whole team and I went looking for her and she was just working a gen. I had respect for that so I downed her and carried her to the hatch!!  She wasnt creeping urbaning in a corner.
---
I want Tenacity for the Flip Flop and Unbreakable combo      
---
As much as I want Dance w/ Me, I’ll just wait til I level up Kate
---
...until they get muscle memory for that to.
---
Reshuffling skill caps isn't going to change anything, if you require the skill cap.
---
Also the position of the skill check is random anyway. If they are aiming for the white bit, they are aiming for the white bit. It is the same with 'extra hard' skillchecks for DS and busted geny's. I find these easy to hit because I have gotten used to it..
---
Throw on some Boil Over with that combo all you will almost always wiggle off 😂
---
If the objective is to escape then no, I wouldn't agree. Not at all.
---
If you sit in a locker for 30 seconds or so, you get birds over your head and the killer starts to get notifications. If he ignores those notifications, that's his mistake. And it would be him losing out.
---
I mean, you can report people who spout shit at you and you can close the post game chat = no salt ever so there's a solution already.
---
Lol right !
---
Hitting a 'good skill check', results in the gen being locked. Lmao do you hear yourself..
---
At the end of the day, if you are the killer and you don't have map coverage then you are just not playing well. it is nothing to do with "Well if that survivor had to take 200 more seconds to do that gen then i'd be fine!". 
---
No.
---
You failed to check it, you were probably locked in a chase, change your game strategy.
---
Yaaaaaaas please!
---
After not getting Sidney, Chanel is the next bestfriend thing!!!!!
---
No troll, Nurse is one of the few killers I enjoy being chased by because it’s not the same “run these extremely safe and boring routes” or “I have Balanced Landing on a certain map so this is pretty much an infinite loop” like it is against the remaining killer cast. 
---
I wish we had more killers who could dictate chase flow like that because to me, it’s way more rewarding to survive because I’ve outsmarted the person on the other side of the screen rather than it be because I ran to the same structure during every chase and because of how animations work the killer had less room to interact with it.
---
Nea, David, The Nurse, and The Huntress are free, if you have the Special Edition you also get Ace, Feng, The Hag, and The Doctor for free aswell otherwise you have to buy them.
---
Bill is free for PC but his perks are available on console as regular perks.
---
Kate, Adam, Jeff, Jane, The Clown, The Spirit, The Legion, and The Plague (Ace, Feng, The Hag, and The Doctor too if you don't have the special edition) are all Original DLC and can be bought with 9000 Iridescent Shards (Ingame currency that you obtain by playing the game) each, 500 Auric Cells (Premium Currency which is $5USD each) each, or $7USD for the Chapter which gives you the Survivor &amp; Killer.
---
Laurie, Quentin, Tapp, Ash, The Shape, The Nightmare, The Pig, The Cannibal, and (soon™) The Ghost Face are all Licensed DLC and cannot be obtained with Iridescent Shards but may be bought with 500 Auric Cells (Premium Currency which is $5USD each) each, $7USD for the Chapter which gives you the Survivor &amp; Killer, or $4USD for the Paragraph which gives you the Survivor/Killer.
---
Each Survivor and Killer has 3 teachables which you can unlock for all other Survivors/Killers by leveling them up enough or if you don't have the DLC may purchase up to 4 of them from the Shrine Of Secrets each week using Iridescent Shards.
---
Did you not watch it till the end?
---
&gt;skilled survivors can loop bill just fine and that the other killers should be stronger.
---
 I’m a survivor main, I was play playing the hag to finish some daily challenges and my first round I ran into a swf with 2 Claudettes and 2 neas! The toxicity was awful 😩😂 the whole round they bullied me.... after this round i stopped tea bagging the killer at the exit gates.
---
Lmaooooo survivors are Op? Oh please sounds to me this guy needs to git gud.  Hooking people multiple times equals more blood points....  which is what ya need to get better perks.  I will never understand camping and nothing can justify it...
---
It is
---
I’ll add another vote for nurses calling. It’s amazing how far people don’t run before they start healing. With her ability, you can hit them before they’re aware you’re there. I also use Chili so I can see where everyone is, noed sometimes because I can often down one right at the exit since they wait, then they try to save the one I just downed, so more are downed. It’s a cheap tactic, but they only suffer for it it they’re hanging around the exit when they could leave. I usually play survivor and always leave ASAP if there’s an invisible killer. 
---
I’m going to try some others suggested next time if I have them, so thanks to the OP for making this thread.
---
Not sure if anyone mentioned the bird one. I occasionally use Spies from the Shadows. Nurses calling is better imo because they’re be in one spot healing whereas you get an image like you get with doctor when they scream when they pass a crow near you. So it shows their general area and not exact location like nurses calling.  I’ve tried Strider too, but haven’t noticed a big difference. It’s only at level one though except for nurse, who I never use anyway, so maybe it’s better at higher levels?
---
May the strongest edgy teenager survive.
---
And here I complained about killers 😪😪😂
---
Did anybody else know that the hag can have like 8 fucking pop ups?! 😂😂 I just about shit my pants last night she was chasing me and I set all 8 of them off around the totem so my teammates could destroy it while she was still chasing me but I wasn’t expecting that many and holy shit it scared the shit out of me lol
---
Rather have the lead from the third movie be the Killer.

---
Claudette legit ran a blog about plants and it seemed to do well so idk
---
He does know that people might be getting out because he's y'know...
---
Camping survivors instead of actually learning to play the game. Also, they seem psychologically disturbed.
---
No.....
---
Sure, go ahead!
---
I know it is a bug, but I missed these
---
I’m sorry 3?
---
Lmao I was being sarcastic, if you've read the 30572 other posts about gens being too fast and needing a nerf, you'd know where I stand. Gens are fine as they are.
---
10 is Max for Hag unless they have changed her since I last played her. ( Which is over 8 months ago tbf, don't play this game alot.)
---
Well yeah, I saw a good number of people say they think the others should be buffed to meet him and the nurse. I'm to assume from your reaction that's not a good idea?
---
Oh, I thought they were. That's... weird. I recall remembering it being like 5k in each category to double pip.
---
Haha OK thanks for the clarification, I agree.
---
I would imagine it is the classic issue of there being massive differences in the way the game is played rank 1 on PC and rank 15-20 on console.
---
It's even better because he's staring at YOU in that poster.
---
Yeah while she applies the clown makeup.
---
I lost count after 7 or 8 hahaha it’s just one after another after another it was insane. 10 is a lot tho like holy shit I feel like maybe that’s too much

---
An available hook in the basement is about to be taken.
---
Some survivors just play more optimal than others, just like how killers maintain a certain distance or view of a hook to make sure they can rush back if they spot a potential rescue (I'm not supporting camping, I mean some actual distance where you don't just take 5 steps and you're at the hook to tunnel someone). Each side has different ways to optimise their game, it's just a matter of which side outsmarts the other. Potato teams get outsmarted by killers, potato killers get gen rushed by strong teams.
---
You what?
---
god I miss the 2000s
---
Some time ago I read about a rework on DbD, regarding rules or certain game changes, not too sure. Did anything like that happen yet or is it still in the future?
---
*cries in bad trap placement*
---
I don’t. Now I feel mean. The only time I have pity is if I keep running into the same person randomly; I also don’t rehook if their teammate unhooked them in unsafe conditions. I go after the unhooker, who was the one I was chasing initially.
---
I don’t play killer often, but if someone does something stupid, I hook them. For instance, a Meg was running from me, but stopped to work on a generator. I hooked her twice that way. I caught her normally the third time. She was rank 20 with sprint burst only, so I hope it was a learning experience - don’t do gens while the chase music is playing.
---
A pallet left has much more value for survivor's team than a lithe triggered
---
Counter: Tenacity is really fun to run. DH is great for finding Hex totems. Stake Out is great for countering...Ruin, I guess, not that good though. 
---
Really though, there's actually *two* Tapp styles of play. Body Vest Tapp is your altruistic Tapp. This signals to your team you're gonna have Borrowed Time, WMI, that medkit is for YOU, etc. Bodyblock, distract, everything you can to help your team. Casual Outfit Tapp is the gen jockey, the stealth king, the one who does 4 gens before the killer even remembers they're there...or the other survivors. You gotta live up to the archetypes. Trust me, people will appreciate you for it. You'll get lots of good karma on that one.
---
Nurse is broken, she should be reworked and tuned down. She doesn't "play" DBD. Nurse ignores walls, pallets, floor levels and can cover huge areas in short period. Playing Nurse is like bringing a Gun to a Sword fight. 
---
The words "Nerf and buff" are far too used in this community. 
---
You don't have to straight up buff the other killers to make them more competitive. The community asked for 115% mov speed as a buff for Hag and devs ignored it for years. Instead, they tweaked the numbers for her mechanic, slightly changed her add-ons and she climbed a lot of spots in the "viability list".
---
Some killers could use this tweaking to be closer to Billy.
---
Redemption Arc?
---
Was this the revolution you were talking about?
---
Aren't you perceptive! Nice!
---
There are opinions that people disagree with, and then there are opinions that are literally just wrong.
---
I am
---
They were always fun to play. Not fun to play against though but this has changed they are okay to play against. Few things are as satisfying as injuring 4 people with one feral frenzy
---
The people playing the game are obviously awful but the actual performance and visuals look fantastic!
---
Nah don’t generalize all survivors cuz of this fool
---
😂
---
Lol. At high ranks I like to prove how broken the emblem system is by just picking wraith, standing still while invisible, and waiting for the match to end. Since nobody gets hurt or chased, nobody can unhook or heal and as a result everyone depips.
---
The emblem system RELIES on the killer doing something. If the killer does absolutely nothing like stands in the corner facing a wall, everybody can depip because of it.
---
Sadly that's how this game works . They'll keep adding killee with mid-tier powers at best with awful perks . Nurse was their first killer and she's hard but fun to play , not to play against but her power truly doesn't belong here
---
Fair enough. Just did a little digging and yes, there is a button to mute the chat...
---
Once again however I need to highlight that I'm referring to muting it "by default" as my title suggests. 
---
It's not my fault for getting confused over the evidence you sent. You sent evidence of a pre-game lobby to screen to back your argument saying that it was post-game. It's not my problem that you "don't feel like" getting evidence of the thing my post was actually about.
---
And also Youtube videos exist, you don't need to play a full match / DC to see it (I just verified it on Tru3's channel)
---
As a killer main I see my fair share of survivors who think that killers are trash if they use their powers or perks. One time I had a survivor who though I was hacking cause I one-hit him with devour hope and NOED.
---
Billy as needlessly complicated? I dunno about that...
---
I just dont understand why youd play killer that is a very stressful experience even without the toxicity. When I play killer, my heart races. If I'm doing well I'm going to show it. Like in soccer when you score a goal, do you really expect the other team to just go back to post and start the next play? No, they're going to celebrate by sliding on the grass, taking their shirt off. If the other team is so sensitive to them losing then dont cry.
---
Ace has found his new religion.
---
One down a few thousand more to go. 
---
This game forced me to disable messages. That's how bad the community is.
---
Ohhh I guess they're just not my cup of tea then
---
You’re weird for using both together though, and if you use Noed then you’re probably not a very high rank, I’d say you’re 9 and above. So obviously you’ll face some idiotic survivors.
---
As a rank 1 killer, all post games messages (PS4) are either: Gg’s, compliments, or them complaining about their teammates (for some reason they feel the need to tell me how shit their team was)

Yeah I’m in green ranks. But point is, there are a lot more survivors that are like this guy than you think. And I play on Xbox and from what I’ve seen a lot of people here are calm. But I guess every part of the community has those idiots or toxic assholes

yup, thats it. I couldn’t remember the name

Sure will

If you know how to "dig", why didn't you dig for "how to close chat?". Some people...

I certainly don't understand what you mean "mute by default". Once you click in that option, chat is gone for good until you reopen it. Wouldn't that be the same thing? or at least, achieve the same goal?

dunno if i should upvote you for Pig or downvote you for Tapp

My friend! He doesn't only Oink... He goes "Oink Oink \*Intense breathing\* Oink"

Also used to be civilians without weapons and anyone who shows them respect but I don't know if they changed that
---
Literally? That's Freddy.
---
I spare people when I feel like it maybe I just like the survivor who just wanna give someone an escape maybe I have killed everyone else and they are the last ones so I bring them to the hatch and let them leave feels good to be nice
---
My teammates when i solo queue
---
I think a whole asymmetric survival game based on The Most Dangerous Game would be incredibly lit. 5 Hunter types, 10 Prey, the prey have to survive traps, wild animals, gun shots, knife wounds, and more. Winning state is either survival, killing the hunter, or somehow escaping the island.
---
I know about these add ons but this bug permanently erases the terror radius. Like much longer than 6 seconds
---
“Trash baby killer no skill” - every survivor that dies first
---
From the bloodweb
---
Wraith, piggy, huntress' tantrum, and I forget which killer does that mincraft-esque "ouerghf"
---
so basically there are a few ways to get perks for survivor and killer. one being just playing a charater. if you want to get other characters perks. you are going to have to get said character to level 40 to unlock the perk forever universally. there is also the shine of secrets where you can purchase certain perks that change each week
---
so i just level up by constantly using the same char?
---
Where'd ya go?
---
fortunately i use my eyes in chases, ducking behind walls never works on me :P
---
/r/whoosh much?
---
If you missed the point any harder it'd leave the same bruises your parents did.
---
I’d just turn off comments if you can or leave before discussion on PC (unless you like laughing at them;). When I completely sucked at killing, I didn’t get many except gg ez, which implied they aren’t very good either and rely on newbie killers if they consider an easy game a “good game”. It’s boring to play against really bad killers imo.
---
Once I started doing better (still far from great), they’d start spamming me with invites and friending and unfriending me repeatedly several trials later. I miss communication with some people, but decided blocking all communication would be best so I wouldn’t have to block individuals. 
---
I felt bad for a clown that DCed. It was endgame and two people were tbagging at the gate, while I was gesturing for the last person to come on (which was obvious; in retrospect, I don’t know why I didn’t just leave). Once the last Meg was close to the exit, the clown DCed. I don’t understand why - he would have got some points just for hits and chases. It fit the sad clown stereotype though and made me sad.
---
Not really that much. Remember she ain't a chaser. For her to be viable you need to optimize the placement of the traps which can be countered with flashlight and crouching. Also you need to have them spread across the map.
---
I honestly thought this would be The Plague’s power when she was first teased with that incense thing, creating massive areas of smoke where you can barely see so you can’t see her coming.
---
Oh hell yeah, that'd be great actually.
---
im assuming you are not facing red ranks nurses. no way in hell you can feel that if you are facing high level nurses.
---
Can't I just hack him
---
Ah yea that makes sense haha I’ve been playing for a while but I still haven’t fully figured getting away from some killers
---
Moo they'd need their own perks!
---
Now that Endgame is here why do exit gates spawn really closer together?
---
Some people just don’t like arguing. FWIW, I think it should be default as well. I’m a console gamer and can block messages so I never have to deal with people. Occasionally I want to ask something or thank someone, but I don’t like hearing whiny people.
---
You say she’s not fun to play against but that’s a very objective opinion. Not saying mine is any more right or wrong but I just disagree. 
---
Having killers who can dictate chase flow like Spirit, Nurse, Hag And Clown (to an extent) is what this game needs to keep being interesting in tandem with killer powers also just being really fun and interactive like Myers or Plague. 
---
When you play this game enough as either side, chases become very very boring as certain killers. The repetition of safety makes games boring. L wall to T Wall, windows through the jungle gym to double back on, killer shack with unmindgameable pallet, loops with low walls so the killer can’t try anything, repeat ad nauseam. 
---
And all of those structures become less about the killer doing something and more about the survivor making a mistake somewhere or if you have Bamboozle or Spirit Fury. 
---
When you get someone like a Spirit or Nurse, you have to actually read the player and know you’re being read too and try to be unpredictable. If Nurse wasnt in this game, it would be a much more boring and uneventful game to play.
---
DON'T FUCKEN CLEANSE DAMMIT I'M RUNNING THRILL OF THE HUNT FOR BP AND YOU ARE RUINING IT!
---
Not acurate at all, when you get closer to red ranks you'll find the REAL killer experience. Witch is lower than hell itself.
---
I use ruin, thanatophobia, haunted ground, and predator. It's a random combination but it works really well.
---
This seems like the person who would DC when they're first put on the hook.
---
Did it gone sexual at the end?
---
Thanatophia seems redundant since it only gives survivors a penalty of a maximum 16%, and that's only when one is hooked, plus most survivors bring in toolboxes or can work on the same gen together.
---
Although I might use in in place of hex:ruin and sloppy butcher while I don't have them.
---
You can assume that all you want, but I’ve been rank 3/4 after every reset and matchmaking puts me against those same people. 
---
Even so, all the way to mid-Purple it’s still the same. Once you have a solid grasp on the game’s mechanics, chases are very boring and repetitive because majority of killers don’t have a way to dictate that flow or simply rely on a survivor mistake and can’t make an opening. 
---
I want fun and interesting chases where I can outsmart the person, not run to the same building-cowtree-tractor loop on every farm map.
---
It's easy to nerf Nurse. Lowering her base blink range, increase her post blink stun duration, lower chain blink window, lower base move speed, lower FoV, lower vision clarity. There are many ways to nerf her and not utterly gut her power while taking her off her SS tier throne. But then we all remember BHVR looks at compiled stats across all platforms and console players skew the Nurse kill rates drastically because console is so optimised.
---
I see two clowns in this match.
---
First off I just wanna say I'm happy you're enjoying DbD. It really is a fun game, but beware, toxic claudette's that crouch throughout the map are waiting to spam your message inbox every time  you kill them. 
---
No but really, this community has a lot of crybabies in it so get ready for some hate mail. Also, Billy isn't OP at all. He's a very strong killer, especially against survivors who are bad. However, as you play the game more and climb the ranks, you'll start to notice that Billy will lose his consistency with survivors who know how to properly loop.
---
So you get a majority of the game for free  right?
---
Thanks you that was actually very helpful (;
---
You see as Nurse survivors depends on you making a mistake because if they make any you'll hit them , and the fatigue state isn't that helpful for survivors, on the other hand spirits power is more balanced and fun than nurse , it's like they tried to keep her shut by making sound more noisy and having slightly dimmer scratches and a lot of things just to keep her from going to Nurse's level and i appreciate that . On the other hand nurse's power is unlimited . Imagine of Nurse got to do something to use blinks? Maybe making blinks 2 modes , deadly and normal . Deadly can be used after chasing for 20 seconds (?) And it gives double damage to her for that 5 seconds after blink , maybe make her a 105% killer so she can catch up a bit . 
---
Her power is just wonderful to work with and balance , but they aren't even considering it.
---
I honestly think it would make more sense to get Brooke from the Scream series. I love Chanel too though. I'm fine with either one.
---
anytime :)
---
If you're looking for thiccness I'd recommend Clown just look at dat ass.
---
Me standing 3 feet from the gen
---
Oh ok that’s pretty nice thank you
---
MayB
---
You were probably being matched with beginners like yourself. The game seems killer-sided at the beginning, and that flips once you start going up the ranks. Billy is one of the strongest killers, but it's not his instadown that's his greatest asset, but his mobility. You'll understand why if you keep playing. I don't think using him from the get go is a crutch, you still have to learn tracking, map pressure, decision making, and mind games.
---
Aren't you a cool person! Nice!
---
Thanks a lot for the answer (;

I died a little when she threw the God pallet 😭

Couldnt the survivors jump in a locker across the map?
---
Side note(s), when I first saved a replay at 0:28 it was because I thought I just had this same exact bloodweb around 3-4 webs ago, I tried to save it but my instant replay goes only 1min back. That however wasn't an issue because I got the same exact web in a row, third time within 5 or so webs. There's a jump at the 40 second mark, caused by the game stuttering for a second when it loads a new web, the same happened in the very beginning for the first web. Either way this proves that bloodwebs are not random and actually follow a pattern that has to include everything but perks.
---
I feel like I had this guy last night... I got hooked and he just stood right in front of me making the sound of the chainsaw, I think to try bait some people in, I’m not sure. But there was no chance of someone getting me and he was not leaving. 
---
That was such a fun 5 minute game for me, I was salt whilst it was happening of course. But I went on to other great games so I’m glad it ended quick. No point crying over spilt milk I suppose!
---
I took off spirit fury because now survivors just throw down the pallet way too early.
---
Why when if they use any tracking perks it makes it useless
---
Oh boi, i will buy both skins for her
---
If you showed that out of 500 survivors about 250 removed it on the first box, then this does show (or is at least indicative of) that the odds of removing it on the first box being 1:1 or 50% if you prefer.  I redid your experiment and got 20% on the first box.  What am I missing here?
---
Cringe man.  So much cringe.  You're such a bad troll lol.

I just want to give you the most detailed answer, you can pull people off gens, powering gates, hook saves, and vaults. As every one else said you have to tap R2 and not hold it. In all of these situations they must be in the animation for you to get the pull, so if they get off the gen or gate you won't get the pull off. As for vaults, they must be injured. So if somebody is injured and they do a really bad medium vault in front of you, don't lunge, just grab them out of the window and they will already be on your shoulder

My best friend had never played killer before but had played survivor for months. On his first try with Billy, he killed everyone. And then he did it a few more times and got bored. However, I played with Billy and could never use the chainsaw correctly - it was horrible for me. Billy is ranked as an easy killer, so I quit playing killer. Later, I read about Spirit and wanted to try her since I like Asian ghost stories. She’s rated hard, but I can usually get around 25000-50000 bp with her and kill all 4. There also wasn’t much of a learning curve. I’m also horrible with nurse and cannibal’s chainsaw. I think it depends mainly on your perks and play style how easy a killer is. I also think playing both killer and survivor helps a lot since you see how the opposition thinks.
---
When playing against Billy, I survive about 75% of the time, which is no different than against other killers. For me, I think the balance overall favors survivors after playing both, since survivors can form groups and communicate. I play solo, but I always imagine how easy it would be to talk to other survivors. My boyfriend wants me to play with him (and his friends), but I think communication would make it too easy to be fun. I think all solo survivors vs 1 killer of any type is matched well if their ranks are all similar.
---
Not all the community is toxic I feel that low ranks are filled with salty people because 1, they deranked to bully new players(and mad they died because you actually did well) and 2, alot people get salty over the smallest thing in this game as alot of players can get easily butthurt.
---
Myers &amp; Abuse, TOTH, Haunted Grounds, Ruin
---
Hilarious.
---
I wouldnt worry about it. People will always be shitheads. Just play to have fun.
---
Borrowed time is a necessity when you have camping and tunneling killers.
---
no, keep it. I knew what i was getting in to
---
Yes.
---
I get that crap from my Piggie games too
---
But for real, proper for-Legion versions of these NEED to be submitted to the competition. If want them in-game.
---
In a game where its assymetrical someone will have complaint
---
this is why I really hate being at rank 1, everygame it's always a nurse/hillbily/spirit, very repeative
---
It's beautiful, what you have given us
---
You're not likely to come up against many nurses on console. The lesser framerate and the lower accuracy of using a controller to aim blinks and attacks means she's even harder to learn on console than on PC. You do very occasionally see a good nurse player on console but I've been playing for 2 years and could probably count the number of games I've had against good nurses on one hand.
---
No meta perks, but fun to play. It’s up to you.
---
u/CRUM43 u/toybasher I have designed some perks and I’m working on some redesigns of the ability. Not long left, I’m also making a survivor to come with the killer which I’m calling “The Raven” what do you think of the name and would you like to know the perks I’ve made?
---
4ks or just angry  survivors?
---
Use Devour Hope, survivors rarely expect it or assume you have Haunted Grounds. Spirit is good enough that you don’t NEED Ruin.
---
God dam that would be so fucking cool
---
&gt;I know you liberals get butthurt
---
Oh the irony.
---
I'll assume youre playing at lower ranks, no offence. But once you're at higher ranks, you realize his power is nearly useless and he can get looped for a frustratingly wrong time since he has nothing to help him on a loop. You can wake up insanely easy and it's pretty easy to predict where he is based on grass movement. Good players and especially coordinated players will absolutely shit on him.
---
Hes already getting a rework soon so the devs agree as well
---
I LOVE BROOKE UGH
---
me that tbagger and flashlight clicker:
---
hahhaha he fuckin hates me and i am proud
---
Haven’t gotten the game yet but strongly considering. My 3 friends and I get together on Xbox live pretty regularly to play video games. We usually prefer to play a custom game with just each other (avoiding toxicity). Can you do private matches in DbD? And if so, can you do 1v3 instead of 1v4? Or would we have to get another player to fill out the survivors team? Couldn’t find specifics about this online, and this would heavily influence whether or not I get the game. Any input helps. Thanks!
---
Furries? In MY game?!
---
He’s fine at lower ranks, you can run any killer you like even without perks when facing anything lower than purples. At higher ranks survivors will know how to loop, when to save, when to use pallets, when to spare pallets and their perks will be meta- you could and probably will be facing borrowed time, dead hard, mettle of man and decisive strike. So when you’re faced with that, Freddie is a poor killer. Without add ons he takes 7 seconds to hit someone. That’s a massive disadvantage right there which could be the difference between a gen being popped, exit gate being opened or someone being unhooked. If nothing else they’ve got 7 seconds to get themselves into a good position to run a loop or drop a pallet. Freddie has poor map pressure and his power doesn’t give him much of an advantage. Self-care counters Freddie’s power quite well too. I think he’s fun to play, and like you, I usually do quite well when I use him. But if you stack him up against other killers, even with add-ons, he’s quite poor. Let’s hope the rework does his some justice.
---
I'm newish to the game. Watched it before but just started playing. What's looping
---
Amazing game, but it’s filled with entitled players, if your on console, I would advice turning all your messages to friends only so salty people can’t message you at all.
---
Duh, it's because Randy is the third killer, and the partner Billy actually intended to keep alive. Stu doesn't know about him.
---
Dwight would be too nerdy. Let's be honest with ourselves here.
---
I let people go pretty much every match, especially if they're noticeably new or not too good. Theres no reason for it most of the time, dont think too much when it happens
---
😭😂😂 i dont even know what to say other then it does be like this sometimes(one time i got saved off a hook, and then hit again...every fucking time i get tunneled....anyways the killer went towards me after i was on the ground for 2 mins, and i actually thought he was gonna put my ass back on the hook, but instead.....he mori'ed me...ah, i just love my life.)
---
Devour hope is a clown perk, right? What does it do, I forgot.
---
The fact you even came up with this is fucking legendary
---
Oh god, time to unsubscribe from this guy, I didn’t realise he was a wigger wanna be.
---
That kinda reminds me of a fairly recent video by Monto:
---
"One of these guys is gonna get pulled off."
---
(Zoom in shot a survivor's aura turning red)
---
LMAOO you actually throw the hatchets?? 😂😂 Are you too bad to hit with the one YOUR HOLDING?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Kill Your Friends let's you do private matches that let you do 1v1 to 4v1 (+ additional spectators) and you can deactivate perks and items and choose the map.
---
Which is your favorite DLC killer? I have Cannibal just to get bbq, Spirit (who I main), and Huntress, who I am abysmally bad at playing. Besides those, who is the most fun? I’m getting bored with the game already on the killer side of things, and want someone new. Maybe Plague? I thought Huntress would be fun since she can throw hatchets, but I’m hopeless at hitting anyone with them. During one game, a Jake noticed I wasn’t really trying to do anything but hatchet practice and helped until the collapse, but I missed once even while he was being still. I also thought about Legion, but it seems like everyone thinks they’re not very good. I’m not really interested in Pig and her traps. Any suggestions?
---
Sure didn't used to be. I remember when the red ranks were pretty relaxed because most of us there were vets who'd seen each other a couple of times.
---
I feel this. When you don't play in months and.. omg poor rank 20s
---
This loops very well
---
Like [Van Pelt from Jumanji](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c7h8MJhRg6s/maxresdefault.jpg) not sure how he's supposed to personify the father of all the survivors but he's a cool character nonehtheless.
---
Yeah i guess mid purples can be doable, def way different than facing rank 1 legacy 3 nurses. There is no way in hell you manage to last 30 seconds on a chase let along surviving the game. Also the way you describe looping seems to me you are facing 'W gamers' type of killers, if they do the same path as you ofc looping is braindead, the thing is, good killers will make you take shitty routes,zone you, mind game you, moonwalk, you will take the path you can, not the path you like and you have split seconds to adjust, 1 mistake and you are dead. its all about the opponent level really. The way you see it , its a completely different game than what i experience.
---
On old timey soldier would be cool yeah. Or a pirate with a pistol. Or a plain old gentleman duelist with a pistol+rapier. 
---
Straight line shot, iron sight aiming.
---
But only one shot then needing to reload, which could be a 10 second or more animation that also stops all movement for killer.
---
Wouldn't overstep into Huntress territory as she can carry 5+ at once, and keep throwing with just a second between throws, and reloads in mere seconds at a locker.
---
I'm very happy for this.
---
You use leatherface with insidious... You are scum, good sir.
---
I'm glad my main is the first to get cosmetics
---
agreed but not in this situation...did u notice how many gens left? 1! did u notice how many survivors left? 2....the guy mentioned mori and possibly the myers had bbq...so u have to keep the chase running as long as possible till the second survivor finish the last gen specially in a map like The Game....
---
I barely play killer but I‘m 100% buying the first Pig skin and the Huntress skin. They look so good. 
---
Also might have to start playing more Feng now because I love her skin too.
---
No its ok I would love to play a game like this
---
What a charming bunch.
---
So this is what my teammates do when im on a chase huh
---
This seems impossible to pull off, maybe in rank 20
---
Quantity of victories over the quality of the victories, sad but true fact at rank one.
---
I haven't played since the Chinese NY event. Downloaded the game last night once again. Looked at my dailies, and decided to do the doctor one. I didn't even bother to check my rank, add-ons, nor perks, and just queued up. Got the Game map, perks I was using, BBQ, Unnerving, Lullaby, and Distressing. Add-ons: King and something else. 
---
Two minutes into the game I realize the survivors are fucking up far too many skill checks, and are way too easy to catch. Then it hit me, I'm playing against new players. All four survivors combined had less than 40 hours. They didn't even have 4 perks equipped. Let them all escape. Wasn't fun at all. 
---
Worst part, the next 3 games were pretty much the same.
---
I approve of this comment. *oink*

I don't like the masks, I would rather use the p3 one. But love that they are from the movies. So ez cop anyway
---
Favorite DLC Killer? That's a tough one, and I would say it's a toss up between Myers, Huntress, and Spirit. They're all so fun. 
---
Do you play on console? If so, which one? I'm on xbox and it took me awhile to get good with Huntress, but now I'd say I'm pretty decent with her. Can at least 3k most of my matches at rank 1. She just takes a lot of practice. I play on a monitor and an xbox one x so my frames aren't too bad. 
---
Plague can be fun at lower ranks because survivors cleanse against her giving her a power, but higher rank survivors will won't because they know how strong it makes her. Myers can be fun as hell to sneak around with people. 
---
If you're getting bored of killer, I suggest trying out some different builds! Endgame Pig, Scratched Mirror Myers, Bodyblock Wraith (these are just a few, there are many more) - they all can be fun!
---
Now its full of sweaty swf teams who just want to dominate the mach and say "ez" on the end of it... i hate it.
---
yeah i don't really like the masks aswell but the weapons and suits are sickaf
---
If people were saying you weren't helping as a survivor i can only assume you were crouch walking the entire game. Learn to loop and chase because it looks really bad from a hooked survivor's POV if they see you crouch walking from across the map when somebody else is in a chase. You're new and that's cool but from a veterans POV unproductive crouched teammates are very aggravating. As for killer if you stayed around the hook and you never saw anybody then it's pretty annoying. If you were attacking the guy who was getting saved from the hook that's tunneling and it's pretty annoying. Not saying you're not allowed to do these things but it takes the fun from the survivors. Getting unhooked and immediately hooked again is never fun. Not telling you how to play or anything, do as you please, just beware that this community is very salty and if you're playing in a less than desirable way you will definitely hear about it. even if you're doing things the "right way" you will probably still get messages but if you got the 4k without camping or tunneling then fck em they're just mad they lost
---
Are they....are they really mad because they didnt win...and instead they lost?...immature.exe 
---
Salty.exe (its not the killers fault that they are shitty at the game and perhaps trash
---
If they drop a firecracker on you. You must look up so it doesn't blind you.
---
All I want is for them to update Laurie's hair.
---
I can't even put into words how mutch i love these
---
I’m about to have a stroke trying to figure out what stfblshdkdhdk is
---
It’s a Nea perk. You can land a one hit down when performing a slow vault.
---
Dance with Me is honestly one of my favorite perks in the game. Pair it with Lithe and it makes it insanely easy to lose the killer in a chase (even easier if you run Quick &amp; Quiet with it as well). As someone who is a potato in chases, DWM saves my ass consistently when I get found.
---
I like the Doctor's shivering "rRrRrRr~", it sounds like he enjoys the stun.
---
Yeah, how dare you look at them! Go stand in a corner facing the wall and count to 100, like any fair Killer would!
---
Ohhh. I'll try running it today, thanks.
---
1. Nobody can hit 100% of their skillchecks. No, not even you.
---
2. The penalty for missing a skillcheck is significant.
---
3. The number of skill checks you get working a gen from 0 to 100% can vary wildly, from 0 to as many as 10, **based on luck alone**.
---
4. Luck is therefore a factor in how likely Ruin is to fuck you up.
---
5. What was your point?
---
Yes it's Rotten Fields
---

And vice versa, you can depip because survivors dc/suicide on hook/ don't rescue each others :D
---
Not sure if this will help or not, but it fixed it for me. You can raise the framerate to your max monitor fps through the cfg file. Also I have an RTX 2080Ti paired with a g-sync monitor and because of this if I start my computer from a cold boot I get micro stutters in most games I play, restarting the computer (not shutting down) appears to solve this issue. So everyday I turn on my PC then restart it, it may be g-sync only not sure but took me hours of google searching to find a fix.
---
I have no idea why they havent implemented that yet. Like I get it, you can just leave the lobby but I shouldnt be forced to leave the lobby asap just because some dude wishes death upon me
---
Cow
---
I love that :D
---
The jagged blade 😩
---
Shhhh let's pretend I meant the speed boost you get
---
I like meg the best
---
Yeah I really enjoy playing as, and against Spirit. Did she actually spirit-walk or is she mindgaming me? Can I evade her while she's in the spirit world/keep track of the survivor while in the spirit world? It's a lot of fun.
---
If the killer is far enough behind you, hiding around this hole works amazingly well. 99% of killers assume you went down there and only realize you haven't when it's too late.
---
For me about 20% at red ranks
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_Devour_Hope

Yeah, I sure do love those days where I play Myers and every god damn map is Coldwind. Sure is fun all right!
---
It's a Claudette I was wrong aaa
---
"bit darker" he says, lmao
---
Thats a black woman my dude.
---
Right thanks.
---
Save the best for last, Nurse's Calling, Ruin, Make your choice, Devour Hope, , Pop goes the weasel, BBQ&amp;Chilli, Haunted Ground(with another Hex), Discordance, Surveillance.
---
I may be incorrect, but I’m pretty sure if you hide the chat once it stays hidden until you unhide it.
---
Can’t wait to get Entity Displeased on the go 😍
---
When a killer is chasing a survivor and the survivor "loops" the killer around terrain to extend the chase.
---
When the dedicated servers come out, this will likely stop being an problem.
---
2 questions. 1. Are you 12? 2. What makes you think people would even enjoy this enough to post it?
---
And if I hear one more complaint Barbecue and chilli is getting turned to a hex!
---
Lots of people have said surveillance so I'm now set on trying to run that, as well as Devour hope. 
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
*Also proceeds to nod alot before moring
---
If they had ideas, they would let the survivors fight the killers a bit
---
re
---
Sharpen the ruler
---
Those ones like to DC when you down them Haha
---
You can see the players at the end of the match!
---
I can't possibly be the only person who evades Nurses/Legion, right? "You WILL die no matter what" Uh huh...sure...and Twilight was the most beloved vampire franchise of all time! lol
---
That's not entirely true in my experience. In the situation as you describe it you should have at the very least gold lightbringer, iridescent unbroken, bronze benevolent and bronze evader. Which is a safety pip. If you didn't make at least those four scores then I would argue that you didn't participate and deserve a depip.
---
alternate timeline where Leatherface makes masks out of his own skin
---
You can see her eyes
---
Yeah some killers do it, i do it if survs get bad luck and run into right after getting unhooked or are just bad, sometimes i just feel like being nice
---
Personally I'll linger in the exit area in case someone gets hooked/downed, and also to waste the killers time and force them to run me out. If someone gets hooked I'll go attempt a rescue.
---
So we would have yet another stabbing killer? And his power will be — I don't know — stalking?
---
As long as i get my BBQ stacks IDGAF what you do
---
Have fun giving deep wound to people
---
I think a lot of us who have been playing the game for a while just decided to say "screw it." To the red ranks because essentially in order to be there you have to play your best Killer and that's about it, along with there being no actual incentive to stay there. Hopefully whatever the devs do to ranking will actually help us a little, not to mention the whole "having separate ranks for separate killers" thing has pretty much been requested since day 1.
---
I don't think I foresee anything with this movie happening anywhere.
---
From what I heard, the wife of Dr. Seuss hated this live action representation of cat in the hat so much she completely forbid anymore from being made.
---
Its still sorta like that on xbox dbd, i get the same players and most of the killers are fair players at rank 1, friended alot of people at rank 1 we just join eachother and play(without mics cause i dont like playing with comms)
---
It's cheaper than R6S cosplays atleast, and those cost alot
---
So I can down all 4 survivors within 10 seconds, or of I get noone within 10 seconds I keep the gun until I do down someone
---
Or is it that if I down a Survivor it instantly ends, and if I don't down anyone in 10 seconds the entity whips my gun away anyway?
---
Genuine question, the wording of such things has always baffled me
---
Ye that's true I didn't notice that... But I gotta be honest, after so much hours on this game my heart hurts anyways. I would have gone for the large loop,  then use the pallet at the right moment and then go for the window downstairs.
---
Yeah I don't get people's aversion to cleansing dull totems.
---
"But it's a waste of time!" not if the killer has noed it isn't, and at the very least it's worth a few BP.
---
"but unless I cleanse all of them cleansing 1 of them is pointless" Not if you're teammates are also cleansing. And even if they're not, 1 less dull totem on the map means 1 less potential noed spawn location. I've seen people cleanse noed while its active, the fewer dulls there are the more likely this will happen.
---
Ruin's job is to allow you to get your snowball going before losing all your gens. This change would make the perk even more worthless.
---
Well I say that cause if it gets destroyed there’s no more use for it, so you’re venerable without it
---
Bill is going slowly towards Dwight to take his flashlight and flash it DIRECTLY in The Nurse's eyes
---
Why?
---
Only worthless if you can’t get a down, once you get one though you can keep the snowball going. Main problem is that at red ranks, gens go really fast even with ruin up but that’s not the perk’s design fault
---
Same. I have a lot of old friends from Rank 1. I also agree with your stance on comms.
---
10/10 would not T-bag at the exit and be toxic
---
What are your guys’ billy builds? I juts started using him this week and he is awesome! Lately I’ve been doing BBQC, Ruin, Make your choice, and NOED.
---
My m e t a build is just too good for him.
---
Wow it actually runs at 30 FPS. Now you've got my attention BHVR.
---
Thanks! Is that an add-on or is it part of the game already? Just making sure
---
Here's another thing--I think that rank reset should be bi-monthly or even quarterly. I seriously don't have the time to play this game enough to even attempt Rank 1 anymore.
---
&gt; He's not as ridiculously strong as Freddy
---
Come on now
---
I also endure solo cause 
---
1.My IRL friends are bad and dont play the game regulary
---
2.It just feels right playing the game without comms, makes me feel more immersed plus hearing is a big part of the game and dont want someone talking while im trying to survive

It's definitely not fun as a new player in the teen-ranks with only a handful of perks to be matched with/against  killers and survivors with hundreds of hours, a multitude of perks, and sometimes even P3...
---
All I wanna know is why the Ash puppet has teeth
---
Also, were there any Clown cosplayers? Because I hope you didn't run into them, get hooked, get taken off the hook, and got Mori'd
---
There was art made by the team for that and it was mentioned in the description in some clothing.  Unfortunately it ended with wraith killing the nurse.
---
Less people message you on ps4, but when they do, they sully your message board. Ive been messaged to go f*** the c*** of my wh*** of a mother and suck the fat c*** of my abusive father who doesn't love me. That was just from a guy that instatly dc'd after I found him first as huntress.
---
I don't know why i put myself throught torture playing killer at high ranks anymore... sigh...
---
Ugh you just *know* there would be those awful teammates who just don’t work on the gen for the entire duration until it’s gone.
---
Once you get your first down/hook Ruin has done it's job, the purpose of the perk is to simply slightly smoothen your early game for consistency, this is what would happen with your idea:
---
&gt;Spawn as Huntress
---
&gt;Map sucks for you (most maps suck for Huntress these days)
---
&gt;Roam at 110 speed
---
&gt;Find surv
---
&gt;1 gen pops
---
&gt;Down them after a few loops at a safe pallet
---
&gt;2 gens pop
---
&gt;Hook them
---
&gt;Survs have 2 gens already being worked on and ruin just NOW activates
---
&gt;Proceed to lose miserably because you didn't get a hook between the first and 2nd gen pops.
---
When the SWF survivors on the other team are being toxic and you're finally able to hit one, but miss
---
I never felt like it is, but maybe that's because I watched a lot of killers on Twitch before I got the game.
---
My usual match is this:
---
Always leave the hook after throwing someone on it. You don't have to immediately go to the other side of the map, but letting them unhook just means more prey.
---
Don't tunnel on one person for the kill. Less people to chase makes the game less interesting later and makes the other survivors rush gens. Plus, what horror movie ever had the killer show up to the same person 3 times in a row?
---
Don't loop for more than 20 seconds. If a survivor is using an infinite loop, or a very long one, just break off and go find another one further away. Gotta keep the map tension going.
---
Act like a horror film killer. Fuck ranking up and "winning". Winning for me is everyone having fun (and after around 35 hours no one's been salty or BM'd me after a match).
---
It's time for a oinky crusade.
---
It is RNG, it is not percentage to remove it but how many did it. If I re did my yest I might find 80% or 2%. it is all possible, it is however to high to not s;ightly buff Pig.

Several keys can spawn in the same box. It's made so to prevent  
---
1. Pig knowing which boxes have been used so that she don't need to patrol them  
---
2. Survivors knowing which boxes have been used so that they avoid boxes in which their friends found a key.
---
What you see when you Mori her vs What she sees when you Mori her
---
"sprints directly into you after being unhooked"
---
"tunneling scumbag!"
---
You should consider getting a real life and a job if you are this salty about a question being asked on a public forum. Idiot, lmao.
---
Have they changed him at all yet?
---
You arent allowed to press m2 now.
---
The ghostface balance we didnt realise we needed.
---
Yeah i'm pretty hype for this. Thanks for posting! After seeing the state of the 5 fps mobile gameplay i was nervous for the switch. But it looks clean. I wish this asshole playing would have sprinted more so i could see if the fps drops but the killer's hook animations looked smooth so maybe this will actually run well :D Definitely doing a switch stream first day it comes out lol
---
What if he can ONLY attack by running?
---
This whole sub breaks rule number 3 unfortunately lol
---
She suits the Legion aesthetic the most, since she’s a runner.
---
He's being reworked so might as well deal with it. How exactly is Freddy unique right now or even fun?
---
Buffing him just makes Him more overpowerd at low ranks. Wont fix him a high
---
How long is it taking you? I've found the search times to be better than usual over the last month. Usually takes me max of 5 mins with one other friend.
---
Yeaa i think it's about how many killers are on at the time. At peak times it doesn't take very long but early morning/late night it's a 5 minute minimum wait. Try killer you will find games in less than a minute
---
Yeah I do see what you are saying here, but this new Ruin idea changes its purpose. Instead of slowing down the start of the game (which you can now instead do with Corrupted Intervention), it slows down the rest of the game. I do also agree that gens would pop insanely fast at the start, but I think that’s just because gens go way too fast when the survivors know what they’re doing.
---
Well most people arent playing at 10 in the morning

You're good at drawing, the detail and body proportions are well done and you'll get there with some practice, but you appear to be stuck in a similar pit I was for a while, where you focus more on the details of the drawing and lose the forest for the trees.
---
Perspective is all just where you place the observer. One, two, and three point are all fairly common, and googling any of those will give you examples, but the basic principle is the use of vanishing points, or points where lines converge. 
---
Single point: imagine looking down a hallway. The floor/walls/ceiling will converge to a single point in the center of your vision
---
Two point: Looking at eye level along a horizon. The two vanishing points are on the horizon, and you can see the slant of lines toward these points, for example, on the edges of a building. They'll be more angled the closer you get. 
---
Three point is more confusing, and usually has two vanishing points along the horizon and one above or below. Imagine being at floor level and looking up towards the sun, you'll see two points on the horizon and a third in the sky
---
As for how to improve your figure drawings, references are huge. Ive been drawing casually for 20 years now and I still won't attempt a drawing without at least posing in front of a mirror to see how things are going to line up. Pay more attention to the posing and the location of the observer, again going back to the point of view you're going for. Think out your poses a bit more, the best way to add depth to your drawing and avoid the flat effect is to pose your characters. In this case, I can see what you were going for, and you did an excellent job planning out the pose of the arm, but again, the body is just.. there. Turning the chest a bit to the side and turning the neck so doc is looking down the barrel would evoke the sense of depth you were going for in the arm. 
---
With some better posing and a bit of perspective work you'll be there in no time. That said, despite the book of criticism it is a good drawing and you're right to be proud of it.
---
Absolutely 😂
---
I want a small killer too, like a child killer or something. The only issue is their FOV, Hag already really struggles in corn, crouching Pig's FOV is horrible.
---
Thank You for your contribution
---
Decisive Strike for cucking tunneling killers.
---
Alert to see the killer when they break shit.
---
Spine chill to get a heads up on when the killer is coming.
---
Iron Will to stop moaning.
---
Quick and Quiet for epic^tm plays
---
Those are all pretty good perks that are fun to use. They are worth a try.
---
"You didn't kill us plus you didn't camp and/or didn't need to tunnel: Here, have free hit points. :) GG. You'll do better next time."
---
It could be due to your Rank. It’s literally Rank Reset tomorrow and most active players will be above Rank 15.
---
The purpose of Ruin is to remove inexperienced survivors from generators at the start of the match and send them in a totem hunting adventure, meaning no gen progress is getting done. This is where Ruin shines. 
---
In some matches you will have survivors that give zero fucks about ruin and just continue to brute force their way through it and generators are done just as fast. 
---
Having 3 out of 4 survivors sitting in generators at the start of a match isn't optimal for the killer, even if you down that person relatively quick.
---
KYF comes standard with the game!
---
Ashy Slashy was made from Baal in attempts to trick ash into thinking he had a mental break down. There are two versions of him. The nice ashy Slashy. And the sentient version of ashy Slashy that is fully aware of his surroundings and constantly is nagging “Kelly.” But ends up dead because that bitch ain’t no friend.
---
True, true
---
Not to mention if you've hooked everyone once or twice already by the time you're down to one gen or endgame the kills just start rolling in
---
I was about to comment you still had the filter on but I realized I don't have enough gas mask filter knowledge to say that
---
Then I realized the gas mask filter has a thing on the bottom where the (filtered) air goes in and out
---
Change NOED and MYC for Enduring and Spirit Fury.
---
Save the Best for Last. You get tokens every time you hit a non-obsession, which make your successful hit weapon-cleaning animation go faster, but you lose two of these tokens every time you hit the obsession, and lose the benefit entirely when the obsession dies.
---
When you have to go to a con at 6:00 and Chernobyl at 7:00
---
It's not a straight up 4k build, but it's certainly making survivors angry that they can't get rid of Ruin reliably, since you will just snatch them off the totems.
---
Double points if they instigate a chase on the other end of the map to force you to abandon the totem, just for it to be Haunted Grounds :D
---
Ochido soundboard "I want to die" goes directly through my brain.
---
Don't get hit at the exit gates  if you wanna pip, the struggle is real nowadays
---
No that’s exactly what I expected. But good meme, have upvote
---
What were they
---
take my upvote good sir
---
If we don't get new cosmetics for Freddy and Quentin when his rework comes out, we riot.
---
Toxic like some frogs too but... Which animal can t-bag?
---
&gt; lose the benefit entirely when the obsession dies.
---
You simply can't gain new stacks and keep your current ones.
---
Maybe, but I only see this at low-mid ranks, otherwise it's a swf ready to rush the hook
---
A much better idea.
---
same as it is, but buff it to "Good Skill Checks result in **5/7/10** % regression on the Generator." and make landing a good skillcheck no longer stop the gen from being done for a moment
---
Make your choice, BBQ, Ruin, and Stridor.
---
MYC is very strong on her, it uses your husk to decide whether it triggers. Stridor is necessary until they unfuck the sounds.
---
Whats the release date?
---
The pig duh
---
As a Wraith main I agree - only thing better is pulling a survivor off a gen when running The Ghost &amp; Bone Clapper/Coxcombed Clapper addons.
---
For real? Huh, that's better than I thought.
---
"So grow up  cry babies and get some skill" -previously admitted to getting run for five gens consistently... What skill do they need??? Not being downed once an entire game?!
---
Yeah I like the idea, only problem is that at red ranks, most survivors hit almost all of their great skill checks anyway. And while we should definitely reward good players for doing so, the killer still has no control over this and gens will go fast.
---
What was it like?
---
Once you save another surv from the killers grasp with Head On you won't feel satisfaction from other saves ever again.
---
Reasonable but I still like it
---
True
---
Legion Meg looks fucking bad ass holy shit
---
Yeah I definitely agree with you here. I guess the main thing I was trying to fix is that experience survivors will just sit on the gens through Ruin and speed through them anyway in its current state, but then when you lose Ruin because of a bad totem placement it gets even worse.
---
I'd rather prefer a Laurie Crusade 🤨
---
1. I just realized this isn't you in cosplay
---
2. Now you made me want to know what the Huntress looks like in a Gorka
---
3. You have alot of skill
---
It’s funny but what about it is incel?
---
Couldn't have said it better myself
---
Oink
---
There is so much counterplay to legion as of now, your getting annoyed playing a killer that can get a first hit off you due to his power but then reverts to a M1 killer that can get looped in everyway. Bitches only dc against legion, there is so much you can do against the potato. If you get mad at a power that can hit you but cant down you, your perception on fun in dbd is misguided.
---
kangaroos?
---
What a ego! I agree that wraith is super underpowered but that doesnt mean people cant have fun playing him!
---
Yikes ... when dbd somehow is the most erotic game in the world :| also it isn’t this subreddit it’s r/dbdgonewild
---
He doesn't have a realm so it is his placeholder as I guess they would need something there.
---
Me in every "toxic" community, just bathing in the salt people give me
---
I thought I wrote it so that it's understood that either [10 seconds] happens or [down 1 survivor] happens first.
---
Probably the most efficient way to use this if ever is to wound everyone then down 1 survivor, a bit like Legion.
---
I have never seen a p3 Tapp, you guys are rare!
---
*Bovine~*
---
We test (or at least I do) to help see on average, what the chances of something occurring is.  I think you may be prescribed to a fatalist mentality, which really doesn’t matter here unless you are omniscient.  Your data showed the key was not randomly put into a box at the start, but rather each time a box was searched, it had a 50-50 of being in there.  
---
You can arrive at this via the law of large numbers or if you prefer a more exact approach, you could use hypothesis testing.  Either way the data helps see what the percentages are (aka how the RNG works)
---
Yes it is possible to get 2% or 80%.  However, this is extremely unlikely, to the point of absurdity (assuming a large data set, and it being one of the two cases up for discussion). Data points to how the RNG works.  Your data strongly suggested one thing, 50-50 each time you search.  My data strongly suggested another thing, all equal probability.
---
Percentages is way we can describe how the RNG works.
---
Why can't we have a hidden cow on every map instead of a golden toolbox?
---
Unless all 5 totems are done it will not activate when the gates are powered. If there is one totem left it will still activate. If all 5 totems are done it won’t activate
---
Yeah must be placeholder. LF doesn't even have a realm on his page so that's kinda weird
---
That’d be so cool and he could look like a scarecrow
---
I wonder is it even worth it to make them so detailed when you will never notice it in-game
---
I think that's because he is only in the PTB so they just made it quickly as the whole page is just kinda setting up for his release and they'll probably remove the realm from his page
---
Solo survivor que average 8 min
---
Lmao
---
I may have to test that theory
---
Killer it is I guess
---
everyone disliked that
---
It’s summer vaca lmao
---
Teachers need shot to do at 10am on our time off
---
Are we not supposed to try to find ruin? Cause I try to find it all the time, especially if the killer is chasing someone else.
---
&gt; From a business perspective it's dumb to introduce a killer that would require more resources rather than bring in a killer with a similar height that can just piggy-back all the current existing animations.
---
Yup, altough it depends, it is a cost-benefit thing, if let's say the upcoming Child's play movie is a hit and people becomes really interested in Chucky again and BHVR manages to get the rights to use him, it might be after all profitable to make some extra animations. not to mention they open new possibilities with that:
---
They could add leprechaun, Gremlins, some imp monster, some possesed doll and so on that would need not much further work.
---
Turns out it costs 10k auric cells and wearing it makes you mori the killer.
---
Yeah I’m still new to the game so I never know any of this stuff. I legit need to take a class on everything DBD to catch up. I understand 2% of twitch convos
---
Makes sense, thanks for the reply
---
I don't know why but it triggers me hard that they miss skillchecks and don't run! Why they do not run?!
---
My game was crappin out last night. Believe me, this was not 5 thicken mists offerings stacked.
---
who cares
---
Cannibals are always face campers. Thats why I just gen rush. It’s better to avenge that teammate by escaping than letting everyone die to a lazy killer.
---
Not trying to say anything "bad" but to me it looks like you put a gas mask (GP-5 specifically) on and managed to put a pillowcase on your head and make it that shape
---
I rate this 42069 dead memes out of 360 360 no scopes
---
I'm fascinated on how well it runs. Bravo team, bravo.
---
I mean that's my experience. I play a lot of dbd, usually more survivor and i probably spend more time in the lobby than in the damn game. But killer, press triangle, boom already someone joining the lobby. Fun little fact for ya, i also play on PC and it's kinda backwards. Survivor, you press ready and you literally jump right into a lobby. Like not even a 10 second wait time, but killer you can be waiting as long as 5-10 minutes (might be because rank tho)
---
Have a worse sleep schedule than me then you're set
---
what a fucking idiot
---
All stats show even at Rank 1 Killers are still averaging more than 2 Kills/Match
---
This requires 200 iq to decode.
---
Why not just balance for high ranked play on both sides instead of trying to make everyone happy. You're making no one happy by attempting to please everyone. Why are we nerfing people who have good communication and follow their roles? On the flip side; why are we nerfing killers because the majority of players are good with him? There are **obviously** exceptions to these questions, but I would rather have them balance for high ranked play because if they do, you're going to have to put more effort to strive for a higher rank or have to put more effort into playing a killer. If you make the killers too easy, you're putting low ranked  killers in a higher rank, meaning that you're making the skill potential bigger in those ranks. This means that instead of people you are with/against being a similar skill than you, you could have people who are **slightly/greatly/tremendously** better or worse than you like how it is now. It is different for everyone but I've seen rank 10's who are more towards rank 4 in gameplay but I've seen rank 3's play like rank 13's. There are some seasons where I climb to rank 2 merely because I get like six-ish games with shitty survivors and then the next six are pro players and drop down dramatically. 
---
Additionally, why don't we have games where there are mixed ranks for the first 10 or so games and then calculate starting rank for players that are level 20 or only queue games according to the highest ranked player if you are SWF? I understand that they want people to play their game but why are we making things catered towards newer players instead of fixing the obvious balance issues that this game has? There's no salt here, I'd love to talk about this with anyone who wants to change/enlighten me c:
---
He isn't OP for sure. He's good but overrated.
---
and everyone draws porn of fucking em, but if you actually did that everyone would freak out
---
Didn't they release the statistics to show the survival rate difference between SWF and solo is minimal?
---
Also I find SWF groups easier than solo. They almost always suicide bomb the hook (as long as you're not camping). It's like shooting fish in a barrel
---
You could but you're not guaranteed to find it, and while you're looking for it, your team is short of 1 person on gens, more if others also look for ruin. Gens are guaranteed to be in their spots and visible, so you could push through ruin and not have to risk having no gen progress. Unless your RNG is always good and you always spawn beside ruin, or ruin is always spawned in plain sight.
---
Claudette can't happen. We already have one invisible and fast bitch, omg.
---
i think he thinks that hatchets are supposed to insta-down with NOED, which does not happen.
---
I'm getting Edgar Allen Poe vibes lol likin' the name! And yeah, feel free to share!
---
Four drugs
---
lolwut
---
Nah, it's Nea.
---
"Let's all greet the newest killer The Nea... I mean The Entity brought... THE PLAG!"
---
Another thing I'm curious about. How did they change decisive strike
---
I've got DBD on PC &amp; PS4... definitely getting the switch version to show my continued support.
---
Please let the next killer be the cat in a hat.
---
Wish we could have that mask in game
---
That isnt loss
---
But this is
---
|, |l, ||, | \_\_
---
No source? Thats kinda shitty :/
---
Here is the original post: https://otherwindow.tumblr.com/post/181163729850/dead-by-daylight-legion-survivor-cosmetics
---
It was probably the developers so I think you had a pretty good guess so far.
---
It only prompts the skill check if they pick you up 60 seconds after you get unhooked.
---
The killer we all need. The survivor can be the babysitter.
---
I stated the OP in the title, is that not enough?
---
You could literally just leave the match without reading the post game chat.
---
Idk I actually really like the masks since they have a shorter snout
---
Awesome!
---
Mini Hatchet, for when you wanna put people in the dying state, but with the smallest thing ever
---
Sure, let's Nerf the only true killer in this game to C Level.
---
Ok thanks for the tips ! I don’t know who has that perk then lol
---
I've also heard abt barbecue and chili. What was that one cuz from videos I'm watching they haven't explained it
---
Yeah, but most people sleep in
---
I’m running Brutal Strength for now since I don’t have every perk unlocked and it helps quite a lot for chases indeed. 
---
I’ll look up Spirit Fury.
---
It was a decent play but he could’ve looped it first and then used his lithe later lol
---
Just make your masks a bit smaller then it'd be perfect
---
For me anyways, I dunno about these other people
---
Incel? What
---
How does this work on humans with eyes?
---
Dang you beat me to it 😂😂
---
This ^
---
That’s what I thought.  Wa****
---
In all honesty. Yes.
---
Idk if they’ve changed it recently, but right now it gives you +25% bonus blood points gained post match for the first time you hook 2/3/4 people, and shows the aura of people that are x/y/z away from you
---
Ok thanks a lot man ! 
---
I guess for Basement you use Insidious ? The few times I hook basement it’s pretty fun indeed, people getting trapped left and right.
---
When it's Christmas, but you still want it to be Halloween
---
Edit: So while doing this, a error occurred and it said don't panic
---
I'm silently panicing
---
Imagine not running self care
---
On xbox you also can connect a keyboard and mouse " thanks for nothing " lmao I'm giving you the best advice to save you stress (I'm main nurse) and you respond that
---
Yeah, with his luck I can reorder my unlock list priorities.
---
When the killer hooks survivors, the other survivors in an extended radius auras are shown to the killer for 4 seconds. 
---
So in other words, when the killer is about to hook someone, hide behind an unfinished gen, or hide in a locker.
---
From a survivor perspective there is nothing worse than a Claudette who uses urban evasion all over the map and self-cares herself. If you are a healing build you need to be unhooking and healing others. Just don’t run urban evasion and hide all over the map. 
---
From a killer? Toxic is an overused term, but people will say someone with a flashlight and tbagging. I don’t mind those survivors as they hate when I chase others, I actually assume they are very hard to catch if they act that way.
---
You might as well just delete your comment buddy,I said what I said
---
I took a break from stuff like this, I had a bad streak were the killer DC'd ince his totems got popped or we were about to escape. 
---
So I switched to mordhau for a bit.
---
Did you ask for permission to use their art?
---
In awe of the size of that lad
---
Indeed, corn would be hell. Altough maybe due to their small size they could also benefit from it. After all, a standing Chucky is still smaller than a crouched pig, even if not in height, in overall size he is.
---
That's the old ranking system.
---
I was expecting a lot worse when it came to the performance. Props to the devs!
---
Plague has that perk and it's called "Corrupt Intervention".
---
Oh look Kermit and Miss Piggy are under the mistle-hatchet
---
The creator put their work on this very same subreddit already. I’ve credited them in the title. If they are unhappy with me posting this again for people to see then I’ll happily take it down.
---
What miserable life you must have if you talk like that to those who seek to help you LOL I feel sorry for you, "buddy"
---
Well, for one, he advocates hitting women, as long as they, and I quote, "Deserve it."  
---
He includes this in his Steam profile description as well, but you can't see it in OP's screenshot.
---
Yes, Dance with me!
---
Now I can wait until later to unlock Kate... if ever.
---
Also bonus tenacity? Dang good shrine for survivors TBH
---
I don’t use Urban evasion. I run empathy so I can see injured teammates, self care for myself, botany knowledge so that I heal faster, and leader so I can help other people move faster. Of course, I still unhook people, that’s why I used a quick heal so the game can continue for them.
---
I mean i only spare baby dwights and neas, cuz thats what i was way back when, but other than that everyone dies
---
Yeah youre right my life is miserable but its not because of how I'm talking to you right now buddy lmao
---
Well this is not what I expected
---
if you want to make it bigger thats fine but i still like it at the current size
---
Use msi afterburner and set a custom fan curve to make sure your gpu isn't throttling from high temperatures. I used to have this issue also. (I run the game max settings with very high fps and a i7 3770k and 2080 and that 2080 usage for dbd is always in the high 90s)
---
So far the game hasn’t gotten me that upset to stop playing. But this one hurt a bit lol.
---
Nothing has changed. I would recommend skepticism regarding the alleged experiment in the post you mentioned.
---
I got knocked down two ranks and just felt like it was unfun.
---
It's funny you mentioned this, because it reminded me of something else I'm annoyed with.
---
I can't stand when I'm killer and I put in the work to chase someone down if they're fairly adept at looping and get my second hit - only to have them stay up due to MoM. MoM as it is currently just feels like a cheap extra life for survivors that requires no skill. I'm glad changes are coming.
---
The absolute worst is when someone goes for the unhook during EGC and you decide to kill them instead, only to have them get away and escape due to MoM. SO FRUSTRATING!
---
*urban evasion in the title* nah, can’t be an ultimate guide
---
Would be cool. Does the one on the fractured cow shed count?
---
I’ve noticed that Ebony Moris and various other high level add ons pop up more frequently for all my characters (even ones that are only level 20) after prestiging one character.
---
Claudettes have the stereotype of hiding throughout most of the game. We’ve been given the name “Brown Town Claudette”. Not because of our skin color, but with the right clothing, we are basically impossible to see. And we love running urban evasion.
---
Lmao, how so? :p  
---
Urban = big sneakyboye
---
I joined the sub not very long ago so I didn't know. Thanks!
---
First one: 
---
Joey: Frank. Wheres the survivors.
---
Second one: When the SWF team is being toxic
---
Third one: Joey is just staring into your soul
---
All jokes aside, I'm glad this redesign of Sonic is fake.
---
Everyone could tell it is miserable, it was not necessary for you to affirm that. And yes, I said "**if you** talk like that to **those** who seek to help you" I never spoke only about myself, that's something you tried to grab to answer me LMAO you can't even think properly
---
You will rarely encounter any hardcore body blocker group to justify the perk space.
---
You are better off using agitation IMO.
---
u r right...i would have tried to loop as long as possible this tile as well before throwing jt down...but hey...fast thinking :D i just realised that the other survivor was healing at the end instead of gen rush :D i just wanna know what happened at the end....
---
Looks great. Hilarious gameplay!
---
Dark skin ≠ black
---
I hope so, I was building an escapist survivor build using Lithe, Quick&amp;Quiet, Dance with me and Urban evasion.
---
I got the feelign is going to save my ass a bunch of times or at least make me waste a lot more of the killer's time when used correctly.
---
:V Brah!
---
baby megggg
---
Ah yes ! Another Killer to farm with then :D Thanks for the help.
---
Immaculate? I'm not trying to be pedantic but I can't figure out what word/meaning you were going for there.
---
Imagine if all the killers were actually like a big family forced to do this, then ~~babushka~~ The Huntress making Christmas clothes for everyone else
---
The only "toxic claudette" that comes to my mind is the one that wears the most appropriate clothes to camouflage + urban evasion - that together would not be a problem, but also... - they play in a selfish way without saving others and without bein chased by the killer when everyone else was already hooked and she not even once
---
That’s the players themselves being stupid. When you face a SWF group playing to the best of their ability, the level of communication and co-ordination they have is nowhere near the level any solo player can compete with
---
Which brings issues when you balance your game around solo queue play. The majority of nurses suck because she takes time to learn, that in no way at all means that nurse is weak. In the same way that many SWF players being bad doesn’t mean that SWF itself isn’t too powerful
---
Hello everyone. To clarify, the video shows a salt mine. A basement bubba provokes a lot of salt and thus this is funny. No problem
---
A lot of them are kids. There's lots of shitty people on both sides as well, no need to try to polarize people into "good group vs. bad group" like the guy in the screenshot is doing.
---
I don't get it.
---
**Ben Nye the dirt guy**
---
I have the all brown just for realistic reasons. Like I run sprint burst on my Claudette lol but the ninja outfit is always gonna be harder to see so why not?
---
OP didn't say it was finished yet though
---
Dude sometimes it takes me and my boys upwards of 30 min if we are swf. It’s just the matchmaking system on console. It’s impossible
---
They said it was 25% when applied, I believe them.
---
I’m a Claudette main too my boy. I always run the ninja fit unless I’m feeling toxic and want to run the killer, then I run my Christmas sweater. I transitioned out of the urban evasion, self care, and hiding phase. Now I run sprint burst, deliverance, adrenaline, and iron will
---
He uses emoji's, clearly he knows what he's talking about.
---
Whoever wrote that is very insecure about his dick size.
---
That Frank mask forehead tho
---
Who is Carrie?
---
But when you hit a great skill check with ruin it doesn’t say “great skill check” it says “hex skill check”. The whole mechanic at that point is changed, therefore awarding points for failing to hit a “hex skill check” doesn’t make sense.
---
Okay, thanks McLean :)
---
They would be definitely harder to see :)

Given the data you presented you shouldn't, which really make me doubt your data now.  But that doesn't really matter anymore.  This thread was more to say traps are working as expected.
---
SWF can go one of two ways. All the gens get done in 3 minutes, or 0 gens get done because they act overly altruistic
---
Define "winning". Usually when people dc because of your addons you get less than 8k bp and a depip, once one of them dcs the other won't likely bother to continue the game after also noticing the addons.
---
This is specially obvious if you ever played Myers with tombstone or Huntress using the insta hatchets, you shouldn't lose your rare addons if 3 or more people decided they didn't wanted you to use your rare items. Seems pretty unfair survivors get to keep their items if they escape or if the killer rq, but survivors can dc on a killer using rare addons after the start of the game and force him to lose them without actually getting to use them or having a full game.
---
I'm saying the Devs should trash that whole system and have the perk actually work as its description says. If Ruin played out as its description says, then it would be similar to Autodidact.
---
What a strange violin/viola bow
---
Suffer by touching the lenses
---
leader doesnt make others go faster, it only increases actions speeds.
---
There are no good/great skill checks with autodidact, only one skill check bar. Ruin you have the option to cancel out the perk entirely by hitting the hex skill check. Autodidact you gain stacks to complete heals faster. Are you saying there should be some sort of the same system with Ruin?

Pretty much unworthy trophies, they hunt as a sport, so killing unarmed humans that are also way weaker than them it is dishonorable.
---
I think it’s fine the way it is. At first I didn’t see the need for the devs to buff Ruin like they did, but now I don’t mind it. As long as you have a couple people on gens while 1 runs around the map looking for the totem, and you have a decent idea where the totem could spawn, Ruin is decently counterable.
---
Yeah, that. Sometimes I forget the general term/phrase for stuff so I just fill it in with whatever I feel is the closest in my head
---
I know what mew mean. Almost every game I play that a killer DCs, the killer force closes the app. It's only when I play with my lower rank friends and the killer that DCs doesnt know that force closing will help them that I dont depip on a DC. I hover around rank 8-10, and I seem to depip on the regular when I just do good and the killer cant keep up. 
---
Then I just depip cause I suck the other half of the times
---
Gonna have to try that move myself
---
It's not meant to be good. It's meant to be a challenge perk.
---
Thanks for the confirmation regarding your life.
---
11/10 needs more blood
---
yes this is a joke and I did mean 11/10 and not 1/10
---
Oh yeah that makes sense in my mind it wasnt because they were unworthy it's just they didn't like hurting people that don't threaten them
---
I don't understand.
---
I mean the joke was you gave yourself anime hair with the yellow scribbles.

A majority can be unlocked for free at the cost of a lot of playtime (the earliest you can obtain 9,000  shards is going from level 1 to level 46 which is 9,110 shards if you spent none)

With hag when cleansing totems it takes the same amount of time as self-healing normally and skillchecks on totems?
---
these are r/Deathgarden af 
---
would still want them either way.
---
No he's saying there shouldn't be a period where you get no progress after hitting a good skill check with ruin. It should just regress then progress as normal
---
Ur the one calling DS toxic
---
Always surprises me how Meg's face actually looks normal in this SFM.
---
\+1
---
It should give bonus bloodpoints then.
---
Ohhh ok. I feel that should stay, but I do see OP’s point about saying the devs should add that in the description.
---
Yeah, well, SOMEONE'll say something nice about me in the comments!
---
Why nobody but Legion mains likes the Legion:
---
Agreed
---
I'm comparing the regression penalty that is present with Autodidact to Ruin.
---
Also, you aren't canceling out Ruin by achieving a Great Skill Check "Hex Skill Check", you're still denied any progression bonus. The only difference is that you aren't subjected to all the other dumb things Ruin does, that isn't included in its perk description.
---
Clown OP pls nerf
---
This is correct. Hide it once and it'll stay hidden.
---
That reaction time tho
---
Killers too strong please nerf. They shouldn't be able to move
---
I don’t remember that, sorry
---
Yes, please. 
---
Keep just one of the effects tbh. If you hit Good skill check, the gen stops or there is a flat regression, not both.
---
Lmao nice wonder if it was on purpose
---
Goku hag 
---
Nice 👍
---
1.There a few perks that allow killers to one hit survivors. 
---
NOED:hex perk that activates when all the gens are done or the collapse starts 
---
Devour hope: a hex perks that grants killers tokens be being more than 20 meters away from a survivor getting unhooked
---
Make your choice: If a survivor rescues another I think 25 or more meters away from the hook the rescuer can be one shorted for 1 minute 
---
Rancor: at the end of the game if the obsession is still alive they can be one shot and MORI’d
---
Haunted grounds: It will occupy 2 tokens. If one of the 2 is cleansed survivors will be exposed for 1 minute. The over will become dull 
---
Myers: if he reaches tier 3 he can 1 hit survivors but this only lasts for a minute 
---
2. There are a few ways a killer can Mori a survivor without being hooked 
---
Yellow Mori:allows the killer to kill the LAST survivor in the trial 
---
Devour hope: I stated how it gains to end above but if it reaches 5 the killer can Mori survivors 
---
Tombstone Myers: myers has 2 addons that if he reaches Tier 3 he can Mori healthy or injured survivors but it will put him back to tier 2 
---
Rancor: explained it above 
---
And I think that’s it
---
Thank you so much, I’m extremely grateful to have these lessons you’re giving me. I am usually not confident to post art online but people like you are encouraging me and truly making me a better artist. Thank you random citizen! I’m trying to make this sincere as possible but I don’t have the largest vocabulary ;)
---
Me playing Feng after noticing a Myers stalking on the distance:
---
"Hey no wait, I am shy, I didn't even put makeup this morning, I need coffe, **DONT LOOK AT ME!**"
---
Yes, perks keep reappearing in your bloodwebs until you have unlocked them all.
---
was definitely on purpose she even t-bagged me 😂
---
Same, so far every Legion perk has appeared in the shrine except Discordance. They know how good it is so they're pulling a mini-BBQ with it, it would seem..
---
Terror radius: *exists*
---
Myers nibbas: lol
---
Doctor nibbas: **ASCEND**
---
Yes, once you unlock a teachable perk it adds it to your pool of available perks that your bloodwebs will pull from. Once a perk is in the bloodweb pool, its there for every survivor and will eventually show up.
---
When you buy a perk from shrine of secrets, it will start to show up in bloodwebs randomly. Don’t worry there will be chances to get the perk again in the future. If the entity blocks off a perk than there are gonna be chances in the future that you can get it again, it’s never gone forever. Regardless of whether you got it from leveling up a character and getting their teachables or getting it from shrine of secrets you’ll be fine
---
Lol that's great I'll have to try and remember this but I dont take people's stuff. It should be a good joke though
---
oh the mother fucker took it, gave him a purple torch for a yellow tool box 😂
---
I agree. Red ranks are sweaty pits of hell that you never want to find yourself in. You get salt after nearly EVERY match no matter what you do. “oH yOu UsE sUcH a MeTa BuiLd AnD oF cOuRsE yOu UsE BiLlY cUz YoU cAnT wIn WiTh AnYoNe ElSe” god its a scummy place to be
---
Like in the movies, but I prefer the bloody one. They are not bad by any means
---
To be honest, I get it, but that would make ruin even weaker, and to be really honest if you're struggling with ruin then keep practicing, long time survivors have no problems working through it as is, I'm not saying they hit 100% ruin skill checks, but I do know people who practically do.  I'm not even a killer main and I feel like the perk actually needs buffed, the only times it presents a problem is if I solo queue and my team is too pepega to work through it.
---
okay thanks! :D

i don't like angry messages

---
I am pretty sure the spirit does move grass and corn while phasing. When she moves she still has the properties of a physical object since she has collision while phasing. 
---
While phasing you can hear grass moving if you walk through it.
---
I personally don’t think the Nurse needs a change to her power, but more so to her addons. Two blinks is fine. Three is enough. Anything more is overkill. 
---
There are so many tweaks and changes that can be and should be made all over the place but it’s all sensitive and requires more time than one fix could make.
---
Does anyone know the outfits rarety and how much it costs? Is it available in Iridescent Shards?
---
Who wouldn't
---
It makes her ass look saggy lol
---
We already have a Mike Myers, do we really need 2?
---
Thank you! I'm glad you like it.
---
Nobody:
---
Me: If (most) of the killers are able to stomp on the ground so hard the Hatch closes, is there a possibility that they can crush a survivors head/bones just by stomping on them, and if they could, should that be a killers future Mori animation?
---
While typing this I forgot about Kennith, but what if instead of just stomping on their head, they break their skull/bones/spine
---
Thanks friend
---
Exactly, you run to her and hope she moris you - it's how you truly win a pig game. Duh.
---
WHY DOES NOONE USE WE'LL MAKE IT, ITS SUCH A GOOD PERK. GTFO WITH YOUR DS, DH, SELF CARE AND MOM. TRY A FUCKING TEAM PERK FOR ONCE
---
I'd like to see more variety in killer play style in general.  Nurse feels truly different in playstyle.  But she really lacks weakness which is a functional problem.
---
Any killer should be a balance of strength and weakness.
---
Nurses strength is mobility... the problem is the balancing weakness was also supposed to be mobility... she has a slower standard movement speed that survivors.  This doesn't actually balance out because there's not a meaningful recharge timer on Blink.
---
A better balance for Nurse would be to let her have Mobility as her strength but make something else a weakness.  Like having it be easier for survivors to wiggle out of her grasp.  Imagine if the Nurses "wiggle" meter was 25% smaller than other Killers...
---
Sure she can get to you and down you, but the counter for Nurse becomes sabotaging hooks because if she can't get to one it makes it more difficult for her to down survivors and then hook them.
---
Is this survivor cosmetics or legion cosmetics?
---
At least a mansion would be nice. Or something relatively with some jails?
---
I love how he’s like “how am I suppose too catch a survivors who’s juking me for 5 gens?” It’s called leaving them and going for another survivor xD.
---

---
WHY DO PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT NO ED? YOU CAN LITERALLY REMOVE THAT PERK FROM THEIR INVENTORY! IF YOU DECIDE TO NOT CLEANSE TOTEMS THATS YOUR PROBLEM. WE CAN’T GET RID OF YOUR DEAD HARD, METTLE OF MAN, BORROWED TIME, SPRINT BURST, OR ADRENALINE, SO STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT NO ED!
---
Minecraft with render distance on short
---
If the killer is far enough behind and goes down the hole at all, they are making a big mistake. Might as well loop the red barn.
---
MOST OF THE TIME WHEN I USE WE’LL MAKE IT THEY RUN TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MAP BEFORE LETTING ME HEAL!
---
FUCKING SLUGGERS THE ONE TIME INLM NOT USING UNBREAKABLE
---
That is true thats why  i look for grass movement with freddy and spirit.
---
Dont mind the sweaty watermark there haha

STOP FUCKING RUNNING FROM ME THEN LIKE JESUS CHRIST THE KILLER IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP! WHAT'S THE POINT IN RUNNING TO THE ABSOLUTELY ORDER OF THE MAP?
---

Huntress nibbas: "Heartbeat? Nah, B, buy my mixtape."
---
im just going to leave [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/SullenWonderfulButterflyOSkomodo) here

and how do you loop him then ?
---
Then write a better one that’s the point of this post
---
Not trying to be negative and ik I can’t do any better and I know it’s your first ever dbd art, but here’s some honest criticism to improve. The huntress has a lot of upper body strength so you could make that bigger. You could try making the lips a bit smaller too. Also using a picture for reference can be beneficial. But the details are spot on, it’s just a matter of resizing.
---
Gotta love the xbox community
---
Just mute the chat, it saves those settings to your INI and it stays hidden. Why do we need a box to check in the settings for it
---
She does move grass, so does Freddy and nurse while blinking.
---
KILLERS WITH INSTA DOWN ABILITIES THAT USE NOED ARE THE BIGGEST INSECURE PUSSIES IN THIS GAME

Dance With Me, Lithe and Quick &amp; Quiet is the best vault build - you can silently vault a window, get a speed boost after vaulting, and leave no scratch marks for a few seconds afterwards.

Here's the wiki for all perk questions, it should include accurate information about how perks changed between versions:
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki
---
Urban is what Survivors run when they don't know how to loop. They tend to be immerive as fuck and if they so much as hear a heartbeat they leave their gen and hide in a locker or a corner for most of the match.
---
Urban and 2nd chance perks are the reason some survivors have over 1k hours and still suck ass at the game. Why get better when you can eventually crutch your way to Rank 1?
---
This is frighteningly autistic. Actually scratch that, I'm being mean to autistic people. This is some monkey brain shit. Actually, scratch that too, I'm being mean to monkeys.
---
DEAD HARD MIGHT WORK ONCE AGAINST ANY DECENT KILLER. SPRINT BURST FORCES YOU TO WALK EVERYWHERE OR RISK NOT HAVING IT NEXT CHASE. METTLE OF MAN REWORK WILL ENCOURAGE OVERLY ALTRUSTIC PLAYS AND WILL PROBABLY BE LIMITED TO TWO SURVIVORS MOST GAMES. ADRENALINE IS ONLY USEFUL WHEN THE GAME IS ALREADY GOING WELL FOR SURVIVORS AND THEY'RE BEING CHASED (ONE PERSON), SLUG META, OR THEY'RE PLAYING RISKIER ON THE GENS.
---
been using him more lately and i have to say i do better with him than some other killers that i actually want to get good with
---
so bing bong boi wll be getting more play time jsut because of that
---
this made me laugh so hard. BHVR has done it again, folks! 👏
---
A new trapper skin &lt;3
---
That's what they're suppose to do.
---
And her Deathgarden mask was basically og legion
---
It’s actually part of her power. Setting off a trap has that ‘jumpscare’ factor that makes you look at it.
---
dont think there is and if they changed it itd be a pretty big nerf for her tbh lol
---
The reason I run, and recommend to run Urban is actually quite the opposite. I recommend running Urban for all three playstyles. In two of them to hide from the killer, yes. This is because these playstyles actively want to avoid being found. As for the third playstyle, the runner: I suggest running Urban to allow yourself to be versatile and get a moment of respite to self-care when you need to in order to keep your ability to run the killer around up. You can’t avoid every hit ever... *ahem* latency.
---
oh my god i did this one time but i chased EVERYONE
---
it got the the point where no one was doing gens for 20 minutes so i had to start hitting people

---
**Calls pig and Plague almost OP**
---
**Says that Hag can get at least a 3k without her traps**
---
**Says Wraith is unbalanced**
---
**Complains about how Trapper’s trap should give you a tiny notification warning when near one**
---
**Says spirit should get a small stun after coming out of the ethereal plane or whatever it’s called Idk**
---
Okay bud, please come back when your more experienced and are in rank 9 or higher please
---
I don't have a screenshot, because I'm at work, but the hag with her lettuce head and red dress looks bananas :p
---
Monkeys, who also, as it turns out, fling shit at each other.
---
It's only Jane that got a new outfit today
---
Self Care is honestly the best perk in my opinion and it should be S+ it has helped me too many times
---
When a Survivor dies it's everyone else's fault, especially the killer.
---
&gt;reading comprehension
---
Doing it once it totally fine, doing it twice a video for like 6 videos in a row is getting annoying. There's only so many times "thenk u guis 4 u're subbort" before it gets grating.
---
Humor is subjective, but to be honest you have to be a twelvie to find his shit funny. I love the dude's voice, it's great, and his initial videos were fun to watch. Problems arose when he does the same "echo filter" gag over non-funny """punchlines""" every video. Also nah, I don't watch streamers. Would rather hang myself on my balls than watch streamers.
---
It'll be you and me out in these streets working our ASSES off for a stalk and somehow loving every second of it
---
Who teabags in general, much less with 3 generators left?
---
I mean all four are alive and Ruin has been destroyed and this is a 46 clip, they could've duo'd and popped another generator in this time and they didn't.
---
Bad players definitely deserve the hook. :P
---
Yeah, no this is complete bullshit. Freddy, wraith, spirit and nurse all move grass etc when unseeable.  100% false
---
Fun fact: the Emblem system won't penalize you for camping if there's an unhooked Survivor in your Terror Radius while you "camp."
---
I just want to make more oinkie squeals C:
---
Who is this ugly woman
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pressing-a-boot-on-your-own-head

Easy to say when you're not in that position
---
Sorry, but running urban isn't allowing yourself to be versatile. It's really not necessary to have for hiding behind cover in most cases.
---
Not a killer, but feng looks ridiculous with blue hair, that green robe thing and her red dress.
---
Omg, mind blown.
---
I'm not a new player, itll be a year in August. I feel like it always the ones who are just doing dailies that seem to be nicer lol.
---
Meg looks fire holy moly
---
His dick’s so big he has to wrap it around his waist.
---
I don't think this necessarily means they're not random. I too have had 2 exact bloodwebs in a row. Idk bloodwebs are bullshit anyway. Also you not buying the 3000 bp things over the yellow ones was driving me crazy
---
And Micheal's not a shape. It's just how the game names killers.
---
AMEN
---
As a Myers main and a cat guy, I am amused
---
It's possible that they aren't randomly generated but procedurely generated, which is still in a way random. So it may be programmed so if it's this way it can only be this way or that, and so on, but that makes it so you don't get a bloodweb of all the same things.
---
Well I'm a Nea main so what's about THAT!
---
WHY DO I HAVE TO BACK OUT OF EACH GAME AND REINVITE MY FRIENDS WHEN IM PLAYING SURVIVE WITH FRIENDS. WHAT AM I MISSING!?
---
Same here buddy... Same here
---
Did they already make some adjustments for Scream in the PTB ?
---
No it’s not, I’m so fuckin tired of Coldwind and Autohaven, there’s too many maps. They need to select it by realm instead of map so some of the others have a higher chance of being selected
---
SELFCARE IS SUCH A TRASH PERK.. PLEASE REMOVE FROM GAME... IM SICK OF HAVING TEAMMATES HIDING IN CORNERS SELFCARING WHEN THEY COULD BE SAVING OR DOING A GEN YOU ARE WASTING 32 SEOCNDS EVERY TIME YOU HEAL.. TIMES THAT BY 3 OR 4 AND YOU COULD'VE HAD A GEN AND HALF DONE BUT NO YOURE SELFISH... 
---
THAT IS ALL..
---
they are seed based and there's sometimes a glitch that causes you to get it twice in a row (OR, very rarely, you just got it twice by chance)
---
I can tell they are seed based, because once your progress doesn't save and you get a "soft reset" you'll go through exactly the same bloodwebs that you had before reset
---
I had a Streamer running Object of Obsession (one of my most hated perks because it lets them see when you're coming and gives them ages to reach a safe loop, and is also heavily abused by SWF to such an extent that DS+MoM+Adrenaline together can be less frustrating, and that's a salt mine already).
---
Well you know whatever, I'm trying not to be baited into it, but I do dedicate to the first chase and down him. There's a nearly repaired generator right by the hook and two survivors are missing from BBQ&amp;C.
---
Time to patrol then, and he gets unhooked when I did stop patrolling (30\~ seconds) around and move off, like the moment my back is *honestly* turned to the hook rather than turned as part of my looking around.
---
I turn around and nail that sucker, he's running OOO and why the fuck wouldn't I get rid of him? He keeps using it to determine when and where is safe and run off and starts teabagging me after the generators are powered, **I have NOED and you're far from a gate, toxic Dwight**.
---
Needless to say he raged at me for tunneling and camping but I was just like. Maybe the survivors shouldn't camp the hook, thirsty for a rescue? Like duh. Maybe you shouldn't abuse OOO with your SWF.
---
Certain perks promote being tunneled, OOO is one of them.
---

I just don’t think anyone else sees how it is a “pretty good song”
---
Pretty much, but that requires too much brainpower.
---
I'd say level up Claudette first for Self Care. That's what I was told when I first started, so I'm passing it along to you! 
---
As far as perks, I main Nea, and I use Urban Evasion, Sprint Burst, Self Care, and the fourth one is interchangeable for me. Right now my fourth is Borrowed Time. I'm fairly new as well. I've been a casual player since December, but just recently got.....hooked. LOL! Hope this helps! If anyone has any advice on better perks for me to use, let me know! Always love hearing what experienced players have to say. :)
---
Thing 1 and Thing 2 come out and beat you to death for the Mori animation.
---
If he wasn't killing you because he needed more time to get Play with your Food and Save the Best for Last he probably would've left you slugged, as well.
---
Not ridiculous but hear me out. If you equip the Wraith's Fury Waist Wrap and Putrid Cavity/Masquerade together, you get a very good view of his (nippleless) torso - and I gotta say, he's a looker. Gotta give credit to Hybrid Panda for showing this in a video.
---
But you can't yank them out of the hatch anymore
---
thanks so much will def do this!
---
He wasn’t in the hatch. Literally was tbagging around it.
---
I don't understand the infatuation people have in nerfing her. There are plenty of ways to avoid her. Here's a simple one, cut LOS on a rock, then 180 that rock and go the opposite way. Works 90% of the time at Ranks 4-5 with me.
---
Puppers, Noob3, Monto
---
clearly this man wasnt paying attention when he tested it lol. But on a another note have any other spirit players noticed you cant grab anymore off gens? i mean i get the animation then  it turns into a swing.
---
So you managed to down them and pick them up before it opened? Nice
---
I'm not trying to polarize anything, sorry if I made it seem that way...
---
And yeah, you're right.
---
I think bond (dwight teachable perk) is one of the best perks to learn, you will be able to see what other survivors do, whether you learn from their mistakes or their skillful plays. And when you are in the best ranks, bond still remains being an incredible perk due to all the uses it has, you will find out as you use it.
---
Ah, I see.
---
NOED activates once the generators are finished, before EGC begins.
---
If there's NOED and you want to save people, 99 the doors and EGC will be delayed for as many years as you want to keep urban evading around the map.
---
If you're actually a scientist and know statistics.... well you may want to rethink your comment here and these assumptions you are making.  You're at a great risk of making a type 1 error but whatever.... best.
---
You may be interested in my Reverse Bear Trap writeup: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bu81wi/reverse_bear_traps_a_complete_guide_how_they_work/
---
One hit per survivor and I'd be okay with this, as long as the use of instant-heals reapplied NOED.
---
Eh, the smart antis who made the label popular IMO, have probably moved to the egalitarian label. As anti SJW has become filled with children and idiots.
---
Your right spirit definitely isnt stealthy. You dont go invisible and ambush people on gens. Then you definately don't go invisible in chase to take advantage of its speed and confusion. 
---
Its a harder but more effective wraith that is less clunk. Wraith looks badass. I want him to have a power that makes him stand out so that I can play him.
---
Yeah and was greeted  with a whole container of salt after the match. They were already injured so it was dumb as hell on their part.
---
I just bought a Jane outfit three hours ago oH my fuck
---
seed might reset daily then
---
Of course that's actually normal, but somehow pointing it out makes it sound alarming.
---
You do know Legion can only hit you once in frenzy, right? And then they are auto stunned. After that you can juke them like a normal killer until their cooldown is over, and even then, if they hit you again, it's still going to take a long ass time to down you. You can run them without much issue and even make them give up on chasing you, so I don't know where this "you will die no matter what" thing comes from. That's simply not the case. 
---
Nurse is a lot trickier, mind you, it really depends on the skill of who is using her more than anything. You can bait their blinks to some degree and juke them that way, but if they're half decent or better, yeah, you more often than not will kiss your ass good-bye. It's not impossible, but it's unlikely.
---
Nope.
---
But apparently, this subreddit has quite the hive mind if your comment and a few others are being upvoted this much.
---
This subreddit is SJW infested then, I guess.
---
I KNOW YOURE NOT SWF BUT CAN YOU PLEASE GO UNHOOK THAT POOR FUCKING KATE THAT CARRIED THE E N T I R E GAME FOR YOU, YOU PRICKS? SHE KEPT ME BUSY FOR 2 GENS AND SAVED TWO OF YOU WITH FLASHLIGHTS AND DISTRACTIONS, AND YALL SELFISH INGRATES JUST DASH OFF ASAP. I WISH SHE'D BEEN THE ONE TO LIVE, AND I HAD GOTTEN TO SLICE UP YOUR ASSES INSTEAD
---
Because you don't see it as pretty good, then you can't understand how anyone else can? Well that's simple because all people have different opinions. Just as you are allowed to dislike something, other may like it. It's well within the realm of possibilities. This applies to music almost more than anything because of how different it can be. A big time music critic once told a band that "Their band would fly like a lead zepplin." They went on to become Led Zepplin :) maybe in 10 years we will hear Ardetha on the radio ;)
---
And I'm sorry that you're lying to yourself.
---
Did... did you just say, "Legion you will die no matter what?"
---
Legion's just an m1 with a horrifically long 20-second cooldown on Frenzy that also breaks every single time they whiff

You need to learn to counter that, because it's basic stuff, and Legion is definitely more than fine now: Legion is only impossible for immersed players who need to spend the entire match in stealth.  They're guaranteed to track you and hit you in Frenzy at high levels, but they're no worse than Doctor in that regard.  With the nerf to Frenzy speed and Frenzy vault speed as well, Frenzy also can't be used to patrol anymore, and really needs to be committed to in a chase.  Moonwalk isn't a tactic anymore, so there's nothing to worry about there, and Frank's Mix Tape is dead as a doornail: Legion's meta is now all about Frenzy duration.  Also doesn't hurt that, to borrow from D&amp;D lingo, mending is a free action.
---
Learn how to more consistently mindgame the killer into whiffing with 360s, and Legion goes from problem to no problem *real* quick
---
That's up to you, just look at some gameplays and determine which ones seem the most fun to you. The times were I feel more relaxed playing as killer is when I don't want to kill anyone, just want to get into chase after chase, I don't even hook them sometimes
---
I think that new archive thing that will be added will be something like that. I think we will start to see more variety of the killers assuming BHVR keeps up on adding new stuff to the archive
---
Apparently there's a similar psychological trick in real life. When you're talking to someone and they are holding something in their hands (i.e. they are focussed on the conversation, and not on the item), reach your hand out as if they were about to hand you the item. Surprisingly often, people just absent-mindedly give you that item.
---
Also works the other way around.
---
Pancake lookin ass
---
Yes, I must agree that’s usually the case, you hate going against the ones you like
---
Alright so your clearly a pissed, salty player, but that's okay, all lives matter. 
---
So I'm gonna bring up again where I said the game does not always work out that way. It only takes one uninformed or ignorant survivor to open a door and start this all. The frequency of full SWF teams that could coordinate not opening the doors to allow more time is very low. The devs gave the actual statistics of full SWF teams and it was a minute percent. 
---
So I'm gonna go ahead and say once again your point does not at all deter from my statement of NOED being unhealthy in the state it currently is.
---
GODDAMN IMMERSED CLAUDETTE MADE ME WASTE A TOMBSTONE MYERS BUILD BY DISSAPEARING THE WHOLE GAME
---
If I'm playing with a Killer that can use their power to get points (Hillbilly, Spirit, Legion, etc) I just go away from the gates and farm points a bit with the power. Better than looking at a crouch spamming Survivor.
---
I'm one survivor. If the killer doesn't interact with me in five totems of time, he's dog shit. 
---
What you're saying is not at all necessarily applicable.
---
NOTHING. THIS WILL BE A FEATURE SOON ACCORDING TO THE LIVESTREAM. IN GAME PARTY SYSTEM.

ciayo | chapter 32
---
&gt;now i loop him 'cause he couldn't put a trap at each important spot, so…
---
It's exactly the same as it is right now, he just has to spend less of the game setting them up. Trapper is trash against good survivors because he gives up a ton of pressure at the start of the match to set up and go around picking up his power. A killer shouldn't be forced to run rare add ons every match to be anywhere decent.
---
&gt;And for hag traps i just trigger them instantly when she's chasing someone else.
---
And you can do the same with Trapper's traps, so I don't get what is the problem here? It's even easier because you can see them better than hag's and you don't risk getting hit. If you see him setting it up, just deactivate it the moment he's gone.
---
getting used to self-care is the biggest mistake one can make. it's much better to go for bond which teaches you a lot
---
all the skins this chapter have been great, but ive been waiting for this skin for a while so im happy
---
Spirit and wraith seem the most popular ringtone now. I’m sensing a theme here...
---
First things first . Her 3rd blink should be an ultra rare . Just to make the two blinks a default and make her charge speed visible maybe so more familiar to new players . Also her " see your landing " addon should be a common . That way her whole power is developed around those 2 blinks
---
haha trapper
---
It just seems way too unlikely to get them 3 times in 5-6 webs. I am inclined to monitor all webs from now on and see if there's actually a pattern to perkless webs, with the layout of perks and the mystery boxes.
---
Ara Ara
---
safest option
---
Ruin,BBQ, Pop, Make your choice
---
if you like to take risks,
---
BBQ, Make your choice, Devour hope, Haunted grounds and go ham
---
Edit: Typo
---
It actually looks better than my pc , because in PC i can't get Anti anilising on without medium settings and it makes everything look blury
---
Billy because winning more often than not is fun, and Myers/Pig mechanically.
---
I realize webs have some randomness factor to them, but I think there's a clear layout for them, a predetermined one. Why? No idea, you'd think it would be easier to make it actually random with its patterns instead of this.
---
I have the most fun playing leather face. I like the noises he makes. My favorite perks to run are Coulrophobia, Nurses Calling, Sloppy Butcher, and whispers. It's fun to force them to constantly heal and then pretend like you've left and then finding them with nurses calling and using the saw to butcher everything. Really only works on altruistic yet inept survivors.
---
My point is that it's weird that there's a set pattern. You wouldn't expect to come across the same cave twice in minecraft, would you?
---
I'm just suggesting it as a way to be taken more seriously on not wanting to be called dude, rather than people misinterpreting your intentions behind it
---
sorry if I seemed like I was attacking you directly or being rude or anything
---
Are you actually me?? I've been doing the same thing lmao
---
Pig is satisfying to play as on god.
---
Billy is quite fun as well.
---
No. Because the entity likes to battle you over the bloodwebs.
---
Feng is a great starter. All of her perks help new players. Alert is great at telling where the Killer is and what they are doing. (Note worthless on freddy unless you are in the dream state) Technician makes learning skill checks more forgiving since it gives you a 50% chance of not triggering an explosion on missed ones. Lithe is one of the best exhaustion perks  in the game . It is useful on all maps and if you pair it with Quick and Quiet or Dance With me and it is a easy tool to lose a killer 
---
Claud is also great to start with self care is the perk most people would tell you is best from her, and it is good, though don't under estimate the power of Alert. Alert is like a mix of Bond and Alert. You see injured survivors and is you pay attention to their actions you can tell if they are in a chase or not
---
Uh oh.
---
You don't need data to tell how useful having coordinated voice-comm apps are. Nobody thinks they're *all* out to depip killers or something, often times they suicide on the hook when their friends are killed just to rejoin a match together or play like idiots in general, but Discord/Partychat can make for some really shitty matches for the killer if they're playing "competitively".
---
Pretty sure it’s sacrificing them 25 times
---
Ah in my case I’m going for a few specific perks on my David because I prestige’s all my other lvled characters without thinking it through first so I’m just gonna get a full build with all the works on him and then level my others while still playing as him cus I was dumb lmao.
---
I posted this exact clip with Laurie a bit ago on a trapper, lots of fun
---
Love the head and the shirt , not so much the pants tho .
---
"I'm sorry but what's a... pallet?"
---
There are other ways to communicate the killer's perk. 
---
Depending on the region and due to low population, most rank 1 players are friended on steam.
---
Whenever they are in the same match (which is frequent), they can just communicate the killer's perks to each other.
---
Also twitch is a thing. A lot of people enjoy joining a TTV chat just to let the streamer and his group know all the stuff being used by the killer. 
---
As a solo player myself, it sucks not being able to see what the killer had but is for the greater good.
---
Yeah but that wouldn’t work with the mechanic of the entity taking at least 4 of the items in the web depending on what you take
---
Ok meg .
---
Actually, I really like this idea. Just a pig skin with a bunch of needles sticking out of her.
---
I mean im a killer main and play survivor too. I HATE tunneling with a passion  right off hook so in that situation i would have punished the fuckhead teammate that wanted BP just for saves. There is and probably always will be a argument for and against tunneling, some people say its toxic others say its a viable strategy because the lion goes after the weak/sick zebra not the healthy ones.
---
I don't think it's an actual bug but more just certain players being dicked over by chance
---
Wont work because of the entity but i think a setting to make it a single click (instead of a hold) would be nice.
---
k
---
https://youtu.be/rEq1Z0bjdwc?t=7
---
It’s a good strategy but it is a little bit toxic. With his other teammates there, you should have just downed him then have gone after and injured the teammates. Then come back and hook him.
---
So the pig with just a bunch of needles in her?
---
"Yes, Freddy is no longer going to have aura reading while survivors are in the Dream World. This was confusing for new players who did not know that Freddy could see than and frustrating for stealthy players who try to lose the killer."
---
Ugh, why must they pander to stupid baby players and take away cool stuff, I feel like so much is removed or ruined in this game because rank 20 Dwight who doesn't know how the game works anyways would be "too confused"
---
It’s sad when I’m betrayed by a fellow Claudette because they’re just crouching around while I’m on a hook. Funnily enough, doing gens is my main focus, but I generally end up being the first person killed.
---
It really isn't, he's a mediocore killer and it's easy to just set his traps off and undo all of his work.
---
He shouldn't be forced to use rare add ons to be a decent character, it's like making Nurse only have 1 blink at baseline, or huntress to have 2 hatchets without add ons.
---
I’m 100% down for this change (mainly because I never use more than 2 blinks unless i’m going against a realllllly good team). 
---
However, they need to rework all of the hugely negative add-ons and make them more usable. Some of the purple ones are straight garbage.
---
I’m not sure that they would ever give her a skin without her mask, but... fingers crossed. If they do, then surely they can also add a skin of her first appearance in the saw franchise as a victim.
---
Hurts my soul to see them crouch/walk everywhere. I know it’s their first time but that doesn’t mean it still doesn’t me cringe
---
Yep! Always good when survivors actually get a taste of their own medicine. I play both sides but usually favor killer even though it’s 100x more frustrating.
---
If you want others to have a speed boost use prove thyself instead . All survivors within a range on generations get a speed boost .
---
So...the doctor
---
BECAUSE I MISS ED MAN, WHAT DID ED EVER DO TO KILLERS TO MAKE THEM SAY NO TO HIM?
---
Hmm. I like the sound of the risky build so I'll give that one a go, thanks.
---
Until they unfuck the sounds?

---
When stacy doesn't have sex with you even though you held the door open for her, then she loops you for 5 gens.
---
\-Because you could just add the other survivors mid-game to circumvent that restriction and relay the perks.  
---
why would you do that?
---
Even if you add them, the are playing and they are not going to accept you mid game.
---
What are the chances of that?
---
Wow another cosmetic not available with shards what a surprise.
---
I like playing the doctor a lot. He has no surprise effect at all, but it's fun to see the madness raise and force them to switch objectives ^^
---

I've had this done to me once before and I was really impressed when they did. I mean, I still downed them though.
---
Everybody is giving made-up answers. The actual answer, as explained by the developers when they added the feature, is that the game doesn't know if you're in an SWF at that point. This is the same reason you have to re-join your SWF after every game. Once they get dedicated servers, hopefully they'll revisit it.

You can't remove her mask. Even her lore says that she is stuck with it.
---
You can't even broach the subject here though. There is a 100% chance in these discussions of Discord/PartyChat apologists trying to muddle the argument, pretend that what you really resent is *friendship*, and not the voice-app boosts that undermine perks and mechanics. "wHy sHoUlD i bE pUnIsHeD fOr pLaYiNg wItH fRieNds!?"
---
When this happens, switch to killer. great change of pace
---
I don't know about perks, but I know what add-ons are best for her, use add-ons that decrease your phase charge time like the hair brooch, and ones that increase speed like the uh... shoes
---
BING BONG BING BONG
---
I can see how that can be annoying
---
Seriously, what's that guy even talking about? I run two blink no addons nurse and running around a rock and back isn't going to do shit against me. With no addons, I'm going to get closer and closer to you until you are forced to stop and run something. And once you do, you're got. And if you run, you're still got because I'm literally right there. If I run addons, it's a joke. I'll use the first blink to get close to you. Every blink thereafter will just be a shorter and shorter blink until I've pinned you down and the most you'll be able to do is dead hard one hit. But I'm Nurse, so it's not like one whiffed hit is going to slow me down.
---
Host DC
---
I would say the Halloween chapter bc Myers is fun to play even without any perks. Also I can't tell you how many times DS has saved my life.
---
Yeah, pain sounds and regular breathing noises have been drastically reduced, so it's much harder to phase on top of a survivor if they walk so as not to leave scratch marks, or retrace their steps, or do anything tricky with the scratchmark placement at all. Also means you'll still be able to hear them a little even if they're running Iron Will (which normally fucks Spirit over).
---
These are actually my favourite skin concepts in the game now.

End of.

Nothing else to say on the matter.

Okay, okay you win you want bonus comment. 
---
Tough luck there is no bonus for reading. 
---
*Rings bell and turns invisible*.
---
*Whispers* 'Psst the comments over move on'.
---
It would really either need to be either no-perks or a curated selection of perks (probably the better option), items limited (probably by quality and perhaps number of repeats), and map selection would also be curated (only maps that are fairly balanced in the rotation). The only major rule I'd see would be no dcing for hatch (possibly no suicide on hook for same).  For "competitive", I'd either ban comms altogether, require killer to be included in comms, or allow comms with a perk slot penalty.  Ideally, I'd say competitive would use something like f13s comms, where it's in-game and killer can overhear Survivors when close enough (even better if directional). Actual enforcement would be rough.  Outside of an esports setting, I don't know how you'd do it.  Either BHVR would have to package monitoring software to pic up on communication programs or general mic usage, and/or in-game comms would have to lock on open mics.  It'd be a logitiscal nightmare.
---
WOW YOU GOT IT IN ONE WHOLE GAME, AMAZING. AND AGAINST RANK 1 BILLY TOO PEOPLE. WHO GOT ONLY 1K, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T REALIZED HIS NOED IS NOT WORKING. AMAZING STORY, AND BELIEVABLE TOO. MANY RANK 1 KILLERS ARE COMPLETE MORONS.
---
Kinda why i like it tbh. It’s be super cool to be chased around by the people we usually see running around and hiding
---
Yeah DS was my main reason to get it. Thanks for the comment!
---
That sucks. Hopefully it'll be fixed when ghostface comes out since they have to update the game then.

You mean [this](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/270/X1L1JQEBEOMA.jpg) statistic sheet? The one that says the survival rate at rank 2-1 is 60-80%? 60% survival rate would mean less than 1 kill per match. You don't hit 50% survival rate until rank 9.
---
I didn't even notice the Pizza Cutter for a weapon. *That's* hilarious.
---
the part about getting underestimated because you are using a low tier killer is real, whenever i play or play against freddy all survivors die, why? because they fuck around, bully ma boy and have a false sense of security like i know the seven second thing, but survivors dont care, and they end up fucking up because of that
---
Eh depends on the situation
---
but you're all default base characters with no items. That's like the only lobby a killer WON'T insta DC from.
---
WHY DOES RUIN GET FOUND EVERY GOD FORSAKEN TIME FIRST 1 MIN OF THE GAME OR FIRST 20 SECONDS OF THE CHASE?!?! WHY DOES EVERYONE PAST RANK 7 USE BORROWED TIME AND DECISIVE STIRKE AND METTLE OF MAN. I FEEL LIKE SURVIVORS HAVE SO MANY PERKS TO STOP MY MAIN OBJECTIVE AND I HAVE 1!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
---
SURVIVORS: DON’T FARM YOUR FUCKING TEAMMATES

KILLERS: DON’T LET FARMERS GET AWAY WITH IT BY KILLING THE PERSON BEING FARMED

YOU ALL KNOW IT’S SHITTY AND YOU ALL KNOW IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE YOU’RE WORKING TOGETHER

FUCK OFF

I believe they will work on this when dedicated servers come out. For now though, we unfortunately have to deal with it. Pretty awful with how many killers and survivors DC. :/
---
Can you read?  Im sorry but like reread the post, you obviously did not, nor did you understand what I was talking about.
---
This is exactly why I run NOED. The second I equip it I'm gonna trash the survivors but the second I take it off they're gonna be experts that screw me into the ground. Just being able to get one kill while he teabags the exit makes it all worthwhile for me.

Got it from a facebook group. Someone posted the template lol. That doesnt make it stolen at all lol. Then ur saying whole memeeconomy sub is stolen
---
I know everyone hates it, but in game comms and balancing around it is really the only solution that doesn't involve removing/limiting swf.  In a perfect world, with only players who aren't dbags, it'd be locked open mics and the killer could hear it directionally when close enough.  Setting that aside, first steps would likely require either some base kit aura reading for killers, or Survivors losing a lot of their helping hands installed over time (like no more big warning lights for ruin, exposed, etc) and a lot more limiting of their aura reading.  With the current set up, anything they add to help solo Survivors is magnified in power for swfs with no trade off.  Devs original vision was 4 separated Survivors who were limited in ability to coordinate.  They need to just admit that they've turned it into a team-based game and work from that.

WHY DO I SOMETIMES LEAVE THE END GAME LOBBY AFTER CLICKING ON THE 'RIGHT' BUTTON SO I CAN GET TO THE END RESULTS QUICKER WHAT IS THIS BUG
---
I thought crate of gears was bugged and applied no time penalty, did they fix it?
---
No one is obligated to do anything, a killer doesn't have to leave the hook if they don't want to. There's no rule that says a player must be courteous and leave the match when they're able, no. I recognize there's situations where you don't want to leave ASAP in case your teammate gets in trouble, that makes sense, but otherwise if you suspect they're not, it would be nice if you just left.
---
I just started spamming bubba and I somehow thought this was just a me struggle but God damn does that last stack always seem to be in a locker at all times

I started with Claudette and Meg because I wanted Self Care and Sprint Burst. Those perks I felt would be beneficial to have in almost every survivor's bloodweb. Over time, I realized that there are MUCH better perks, so I began leveling up the others: Laurie (for Decisive Strike), Bill (for Borrowed Time and Unbreakable), and now Nea (for Urban Evasion).  
---
One thing I will say is that there are other perks, like Kindred or Spine Chill, that beat the boots off of some of the "character" perks. I don't play ANY matches without Spine Chill now. For someone who is really bad at looping killers, it's indispensible in allowing me to get away from the area before I'm found. Pair Spine Chill with Urban Evasion (you can crouch away rather than run and leave scratch marks), decide how you want to play the match - altruistically? objectively? - then choose your final two perks based off of that.  
---
One last thing I want to throw out there is that the grind as a survivor is rough, the BPs just aren't as high as playing killer. But, if you enjoy playing survivor, play matches back to back and allow the BPs to build up and then knock out 4-5 bloodweb levels at once. I found doing it this way rather than 3-4 nodes at a time makes it more tolerable and fun. :) Good luck and welcome to the fog!

Why's that? Everyone else here is saying it's a good perk to start with. Please explain.
---
Bond, you say? Thanks!
---
Personally, I've always thought that as rank increases, so should skill check difficulty.  All the little effects of certain killers/perks should be used as you rank up.  Rank is "supposed" to indicate skill, or at least experience, with the game.  So as you get higher in ranks (or maybe in survivor play time), why not start adding in effects from doctor's madness, huntress' lullaby, and the occasional overcharge? Other ideas that folks have mentioned over the years are skill checks that swing anticlockwise, skill checks where the indicator flickers in and out intermittently.  I'm sure there's many more creative idea that can be applied.  This also means thst low rank/hour players can get slightly easier skill checks to learn with for a little while.

Sending messages through XB1 or PS4 about the killers perks is super easy and quick. You don't even need to open the message if the sender keeps it short and to the point as the part of the message shows up on screen if they have notifications on, at least on PS4. Even then you could just quickly look at your messages on the mobile app.
---
I know it's more difficult to send and receive messages to and from  strangers on Steam but I doubt BHVR are willing to make 2 versions of the game. One where solo'ers are able to see the perks on PC before the match ends and a version on console where it is like what we have now.

You should probably get Halloween chapter, Laurie has 2 good perks and Myers is very easy to play, while also being very efficient against average survivors, so I think it's your best choice.

But Jane also has funny perks to use, like Head On and she's a THICC girl.

---
Haha this is funny.
---
I just wish my unlocked perks showed up in my bloodwebs for the characters I want them on. This along with getting the rank 3 version of perks on everyone BUT the survivior the perk belongs to is frustrating.
---
This is a stupid idea, you can always run Unbreakable if you are slugged with DS.
---
Oh ok I thought you just meant like the indicator of the number of gens or the indicator of who is hooked at the moment. That perk would be op but swf would counter like all things unfortunately
---
A lot of killers, if they get a lobby and there's three dudes pounding gens, looping well, and using things like dead hard effectively and 1 lone Dwight who blows up every Gen, runs straight into a wall/corner every time he gets the hit speed boost... Well, a lot of those killers will smack Dwight around a little and go kill everyone else. 
---
If Dwight is a serial Gen blower, I will drag him around to gens at the end so he can get some skill check practice.
---
You seem to be going for a hook farm build, I'd suggest replace prove thyself with borrowed time
---
That's a super clever juke! I definitely would have dropped down. 
---
Now I will keep my eyes peeled.
---
Nono the killer was far behind
---
Why leave all of what he said and focus exclusively on the bloodpoints ? Fine we don't need that 50 anyway . Just don't make the gen repair stop for a second after fail skill check
---
Is that the individual killer leaderboard/rank thing they were talking about?  I'm hoping that will incentivize people to mix it up.  It can't come soon enough.
---
The mask is custom made. And yeah I could see another hoodie being better
---
It’s usually easy to tell when it is swf
---
Dude look behind you when you play... make sure the killer is still on you or If they took a different route that hit was easily avoidable if you just looked behind you after you vaulted that pallet. .
---
But yeah something definitely crashed.
---
The killer hides from these guys
---
Truthfully the community is entirely survivor sided and that’s not changing anytime soon. Anyone to neglect this fact is stuck in their own closed-minded world. Survivor main btw, I play killer regularly as well. The game is always more frustrating for killers. bUt NurSe aNd BiLlY, yeah not everybody plays those two killers and when the time comes, they’ll receive the appropriate nerfs.
---
Honestly nothing more satisfying than killing those kind of survivors.
---
Ughhhh I hate when people play this way.. so boring for both of you.
---
It'd be cool if they actually did like a workshop thing, like what valve does. They pick the best ones for the game and the creator gets a significant portion of the revenue from the sales of that thing.
---
Piggybacking on this highly voted and factually correct answer which is nevertheless not the reason:
---
The actual reason, as explained by the developers when they added the feature, is that the game doesn't know if you're in an SWF at that point. This is the same reason you have to re-join your SWF after every game. Once they get dedicated servers, hopefully they'll revisit it.
---
I mean it's a definite time and dev file space save from making two whole versions of the same model, one low detail for ingame and one high detail for promotional renders. Just compressing the high detail to a low detail in the engine makes it so that once that is implemented they don't need to spend modelling and art time just seperating the two models
---
it makes you addicted to being on full health, making you more likely to escape in low ranks, ofc, but in the long run, it makes you heal when you really don't need that. healing yourself takes 32 seconds (40 when the killer has sloppy butcher). it's a huge time investment. add on top of that the fact that many new survivors don't know where to heal so the first thing they do is running to the edge of the map, wasting even more time. bond on the other hand teaches you how to be efficient. It tells you where the gens are (you can see other survivors working on them through walls), what your teammates are doing and where they are if you need heals
---
Lol when I leave my team calls me out cuz I wasn't there to save them after they screwed around with the killer too much. Like annoying a cat and getting astonished when they claw you. They deserve the death.
---
I did that as wraith, with a nickname "Ruin Security"
---
He gave you hatch because he wrecked your team lol.
---
I ran borrowed for a while, but I found it quite useless most games in my rank (I hover around 8-10). Maybe one out of every 20 someone would be camped. If they were and i wanted the save, i was willing to go down for it. Plus one of my friends normally runs borrowed when we go into games so theres that
---
you easily can come across two the same caves in minecraft. I even spawned two of the same worlds once. it's also seed based.
---
YES, Iv been waiting for Tapp perks forever!
---
&gt;Once they get dedicated servers, hopefully they'll revisit it.
---
Hopefully not, for the reasons I mentioned.
---
It’s actually not a bad movie they ended it off pretty nice. It’s not better then number 1 for obvious reasons. But it’s pretty good.
---
Is this why survivors always crouch there? I'm pretty amused that this works at higher than green ranks lol
---
Because of the the big youtube streamers cried and cried about it until they changed it.
---
What's bad with that? +1250 BP extra before dying. It's the equivalent of survs waiting on the gate so the killer can earn more points by hitting them
---
NO I WAS A MEG IT WAS A FEW DAYS AGO
---
Your dedication to carrying that torch is admirable, little oinker.
---
The worst mori is from the first killer the trapper, you can really tell the devs were new or underfunded when they made that mori
---
The only way those reasons would win out is if your priorities are basically "A tiny handful of killers will be inconvenienced if we don't do it, so let's inconvenience every single solo survivor who ever plays the game." If that's your priority, it is totally valid — preferences are personal things — but I think it's also fair for other people to hope for a good solution for most players.
---
At any rate, my point is that the reason it works this way is explicitly a technical limitation, not the reasons you gave, though your reasons are completely accurate.

I hate you so much you bastard
---
Have an upvote
---
Sad thing is I died on that hook, 2 people got downed tryna save me. Haven’t even played the game for a week and this already has happened far too much
---
good that it's available for bloodshards..
---
Most people also aren't noobs close to rank 20.
---
Guilty of this...those Pig cosmetics are so fucking good.  Pig is top 3 fav Kilelrs of mine to play as

Why the fuck is someone down voting him for realizing it's HIS internet that's the problem?  Ffs.
---
No, the cd is fine. It's 5 seconds, not a ridiculous time. There's a bug where the indicators just straight up don't show up though. That makes it useless, not the cd.
---
Shit teammates
---
Looks connection related, reset ur internet and if ur on wifi switch to ethernet
---
thought the same.. feels like 80% of the outfits released are not available for shards atm.. bhvr must be short on money or sth
---
That's not wrong
---
Nice!!!!! Good job!
---
Yeah so I was looking up stuff on poised and dance with me is actually in the shrine right now.
---
Of course!
---
Ohh ok I havent used it in a while.
---
No
---
It does have the filter on, but you can block airflow into an old gas mask with or without the filter.  Not sure if newer ones have more vents or not.  That Era is usually just a single small vent though.
---
Dude I feel ya. Play swf so you can communicate and tell them to not save or create a distraction.
---
Personally im a no5 fan. But Oberlain would probably be the best.
---
I think that was me LOL
---
myers is spooky bc it can be hard to tell how close he is to t3. hag and spirit have decent jump scare capability. that's about it tbh, game isnt really that scary once you get used to it
---
In my opinion stake out is probably one of the best perks low. Key if ur constantly in the terror radios of the killer like myself, plus it makes good skillchecks great. Im not the best at hitting great skillchecks myself. Thats the pig dlc but u can buy some of them with the shards if u would rather just buy a solo survivor or killer, I myself like tapp
---
You aren't very good at debating, you most enjoy playing the op killers of dbd.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
The nurse, spirit and plague never did anything wrong either.
---
Chapter package. Comes with Giant evil baby killer.
---
Clones or teleportation considering the red devil  seemed to appear everywhere to the point it was more than 1.
---
As for weapon, he used a lot of things, so id say go for the axe.
---
Myers. He’s completely undetectable in Tier 1 especially if the killer is using M&amp;A, his lunge is better in tier 2 and he vaults faster and has an instant down in tier 3. Every tier presents a new danger.
---
DS WENT WENT FTOM BROKEN TO USELESS. BVHR DOES A SHIT JOB WITH MIDDLE GROUND SOLUTIONS, ITS EITHER TOO OP OR TOO UP
---
Ngl, I didn't like the very first scream. I saw it as a kid, but I found it bery boring. Probably because of how dated it was by the time I saw it.
---
thank you mister artist sir!
---
Hag because they're mostly likely to camp. 
---
Trapper because he makes windows unsafe and I almost always run lithe. 
---
My teammates because I always solo queue.
---
MAYBE IF OTHERS ACTUALLY FUCKING HEALED ME I WOULDNT RUN SELF CARE

WE HAVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE CANT RELY ON KILLERS BEIJG DECENT SO WE NEED TO USE PERKS THAT CAN GIVE US A CHANVE AGAINST A TUNNELING KILLER. WE WANT TO SURVIVE, AND WE ARE STUCK WITH THE FEW META PERKS THAT DO ANYTHING IN THE GAME.
---
I watch on my phone while I play on my PC :/
---
I REALLY DON'T LIKE HOW ON STEAM MAINTENANCE DAY, YOU WIN OR LOSE A GAME, AND YOU GET REWARDED YOUR PITY POINTS AT THE END OF THE MATCH BUT THE SERVERS ARE UNSTABLE AND YOUR POINTS AREN'T APPLIED TO YOUR ACCOUNT.

I'D RATHER PEOPLE GET DOUBLE BLOOD POINTS TO WORK AROUND THIS THAN PLAY A MATCH AND GET NOTHING.
---
Constantly outputting content requires some input of money. Shards don’t help the developer. They can’t create content for free forever, as their work time creating content is more valuable than your play time accruing shards.

I'm a massive fan of DnD and that was fantastic. I'm thinking of running a campaign about it using these now. Please do more

---
Arsonist. His mori would be to dump gasoline on the survivor then burn them alive.
---
His ability would be something like pouring a trail of gasoline across an area of the map. If he chases a survivor through that area, he can light it up cutting off the survivors. If the survivor goes through, they’ll take damage or go down.
---
Edit: Of course, his ability is probably horribly unbalanced, but I just want an arsonist.
---
Doctor. I can’t stand it when the skill check jumps all over the place.
---
You can unlock the faces of the first four DBD survivors by completing hidden achievements.
---
Mine could slow down time in a radius
---
One add-on which she desperately needs is an Exhaustion one, where if the survivor is Broken from her Vile Purge they are Exhausted until they Cleanse. 
---
It would give incentive to Cleanse and would make surviving being Broken without Dead Hard/Balanced/Sprint Burst as a backup a bit harder. I mean the Clown has one and all he has to do is throw the bottle in the general direction of a survivor and now they are Exhausted for the duration of the chase.
---
Edit: I wouldn’t mind her base kit staying as it is so long as she got more “Status Effect” add-ons to make Cleansing more appealing or needed. 
---
Imagine an add-on where every time the survivor throws up they become Hindered for 3-5 seconds and couple that with an Exhaustion add-on and she’s be great.
---
If by chance killers slug after tunneling and I’m up next with DS I’ll typically just jump in a locker. Sure, they can just wait too but that’s a little much if you think about it. Especially if you have head on. You’re getting stunned either way fella
---
Didn't the plague perform a large number of human sacrifice rituals that obviously didn't work?
---
I SPENT 20 MINUTES TRYING TO LOAD INTO A GAME AS A SURVIVOR FOR ME TO GET AN ERROR MESSAGE THAT THE KILLER AND/OR ANOTHER SURVIVOR DISCONNECTED. MY FIRST ACTUAL GAME, THE OBSESSION DC’ED 2 MINUTES IN THE FENG MIN KILLED HERSELF ON THE HOOK THEN DAVID DC’ED LIKE WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. IM DEPIPPING AND DERANKING BC IF THESE FUCK ASSES
---
Kill 25 of each of the 4 original survivors
---
It is viable when none of the Survivors do gens and just point at you while you camp though.
---
I love when he uses that lmaoo
---
Pretty much. It's why I love maining Clown and Wraith. A Survivor drops a pallet and then teabags behind it so you throw a bottle at them, break the pallet with Brutal Strength + Fired Up, and they kinda just have to sit there and go "Guess I'll die."
---
Sacrifice on hooks 25 times meg, dwight, claudette and jake
---
By that logic, more than 99% of memes are stolen
---
for fun, i choose myers because its fun to scare survivors
---
Using a template isn’t stealing a meme
---
COST A LOT OF TIME MY FOOT. MOST OF THE TIME THERE IS A DULL TOTEM ALREADY BY A GENERATOR AND YOU CAN JUST CLEANSE IT AND THEN CONTINUE ON THE GEN. SURVIVORS ALREADY IMMEDIATELY SPEND 15 MINUTES LOOKING FOR RUIN AND YOU CANT CLEANSE ANY DULL TOTEM YOU FIND ALONG THE WAY? YOU DONT EVEN NEED SMALL GAME TO FIND TOTEMS THEY ARENT EVEN HARD TO FIND. IF YOU’RE A SOLO SURVIVORS JUST TELL THEM TO CLEANSE TOTEMS ALONG THE WAY IN PRE GAME CHAT. I AM A SURVIVOR MAIN. PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT NO ED ITS THEIR OWN FAULT.
---
Really does look great, wish there was a way to transfer progress, then it would be a no-brainer buy.
---
yeah, because they arent coordinated
---
All survivors have a model without clothes then they are put over top. The pig has a face under the pig.
---
I never figured you could take her beanie off. Do you know if there’s any pictures ?
---
Probably a Fortnite Fifa player
---
Was there really a point to sharing your lover's quarrel on this subreddit?
---
Idk try Google. Theres ones of huntress without a mask too. Same with trapper
---
That place is the entity.
---
Or now that they added player level, have ranking based on that so that devotion 5 players dont come up against total nubs.
---
Any plans to just rework the night are chapter as a whole, and fix Quentin's face since you're already reworking Freddy, and the map?
---
Oh yeah, I didnt think as much about advertising!
---
There are so many things they could do with minimal effort to improve plague. I won’t bore you with all my ideas but I really hope she gets some love.
---
*YIKES* sad but true :(
---
Opinion query: how well do you think trapper would be if he places his traps like hag?
---
A demon. For a mori they throw a survivor into a portal to hell and they burn alive, and he takes them out and they are all crispy. Dunno what they would do, just would look cool doin it.
---
I’ll give it a shot, thanks.
---
This only seems to happen when i’m playing spirit, oddly enough.
---
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU A FREE ESCAPE BECAUSE YOUR TEAMMATE IS AN ASSHOLE.  RUN DECISIVE IF YOU DON'T WANT REHOOKED.   I'LL PUNISH THEM IN MY OWN WAY BY LEAVING THEM SLUGGED FOR THE FULL BLEEDOUT TIMER.
---
No he hates fortnite and doesn’t play fifa he plays gta but still plays fortnite even though he hates it
---
He is also the kinda kid that would actually hack someone instead of just threatening it and he is like 10% bark 90% bite and he barks A LOT
---
Yeah or just guard the gens. They have to do them to get out anyways....
---
No, I don’t think so. I saw it just the other day.
---
PERFECTLY ALLOWED TO DO THAT
---
IN MY CASE I WAS FARMED TO DEATH WITHIN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES OF THE MATCH, THE KILLER DOWNED ONE OF THE FARMERS, DIDN’T HOOK THEM, CAME AFTER ME INSTEAD AGAIN AND LET THAT PERSON GET PICKED UP
---
ORDINARILY I DO NOT BLAME KILLERS FOR MY TEAMMATES ASSHOLERY BUT IN THIS SITUATION I FEEL MY ANNOYANCE AT BOTH PARTIES IS MORE THAN JUSTIFIED
---
NOBODY WAS EVEN ON GENS THEY WERE ALL RIGHT THERE AND SHE COULD SEE THEY WERE DELIBERATELY FARMING ME
---
It was also really popular with machine gun huntress.
---
I’ve always wanted one that blind survivors, so like within eye sight of him he would use his eyes sorta like the flashlight and if you looked into it, it would blind you for a short period of time the longer you looked at it the longer it paralyzes you,  the more times he blinds you the more blind spots you get, causing your survivor to have a harder time doing gens, his Mori would be like pennywise from IT, except it comes from his eyes, but every time he tries to blind you it cause him to stumble so he can still walk just not straight for a few seconds to let the survivor try to run
---
Ooof. From what it sounds like though, that means the map is running on the bare minimum of pallets that have to spawn. Outside of those 2 double pallet areas, were there large dead zones?
---
Imagine having to use a med kit every game
---
Trapper be lookin fine
---
Whoa big boi
---
You must be new to the internet. This shit is everywhere.

Take my well deserved upvote

I’d be fine with this but it needs to be less than a minute

Do you play on console by any chance?

Ok, tonight I'm trying out killer for the first time. I'll start with Wraith, looks fun.

---
Didn't you all hear? The Devs said their ~~made up~~ stats proves that she is a top tier killer at the highest ranks and that she doesn't need any buffs. Even though anyone who plays the game consistently knows this is not only bs but is a laughable 'santa-clause-is-real" type of bs, we should totally believe them. The only killer who's power gives survivors the base ability to instant heal is totally on par with the Nurse, Spirit, and Billy.
---

Normally I do look behind it was my last game late at night so I was too tired to look behind me I just wanted to finish the match and go to bed.
---
It's Adam in his white coat.
---
I like this idea
---
Lovecraftian horror. Ability: Can go into one locker and exit from any other with extra movespeed OR under the guise of a survivor. Can't run and teabag while cloaked. Can see auras of survivors near lockers while stay in locker. Rate it on a scale of 0 to 10.
---
Not going to lie, that Leatherface one made me laugh. I could immediately tell what was going on.
---
They look great!
---
There is a perk called mettle of men, also borrowed time, those can make survs tank hits
---
Perks.
---
Well said.
---
Lmao now we need this http://imgur.com/gallery/A9TrwXX
---
Because then people would just tell each other the killer’s perk. Ok Xbox you don’t even have to friend request someone. Just press their name and start saying whatever it is you want to say. And if they can’t type they would mosh likely make a party to voice chat each other. And plus why would a survivor need to know what perks the killer is using? Just answer that last question
---
Thank you gents. Much appreciated.
---
Thank you sir.
---
just asking! looked too real
---
His electric attack doesn't deal damage, it's only two hits unless they had mettle of man but they'd glow white in the third. Also they can heal themselves if they meet up with other survivors or have a certain perk
---
So certain killers have addons or their power allows them to one shot. There are also perks that allow one shots as well. So the doctor has to use perks to one shot either it was (NOED, Devour hope, Haunted Grounds, or any other perk that makes you expose or one shot.)
---
AND GIVE THEM A FUCKING DAGGER SO THEY CAN HELP ME HUNT DOWN THOSE LITTLE ASSHATS BECAUSE I KNOW, I **KNOW** THEY WANT TO
---
Interesting. Thank you kind sir.
---
Laurie has 2 good perks? Whats the other one lol

Did they decide to remove the red flash effect on the PTB when Killers get hit by a pallet? I’m not epileptic or anything but just watching videos of that makes my head twinge. I’d hate to see what it does to someone with legitimate photosensitivity.
---
Oh.
---
It's that way for most games :)
---
Hillbilly: rev up chainsaw. At 1st second, you get fast turning, then it's slow. Chainsaw can break pallets and one shot survivors. You get a cooldown when letting go of your chainsaw or bumping into something.

No problem
---
"It's always everyone else's fault instead of my own." Great attitude for self-improvement /s. Everyone has room for improvement. You can't improve if you're delusional and convinced yourself that your play is perfect, and you're unwilling to be self-critical.
---
Correct. You get plenty of things with shards. You’re already rewarded for playing the game. Expecting more free stuff is silly. If players want constant content that costs time and resources to create, they have to pay for it. The fact that killers and survivors can be purchased with shards, instead of exclusively behind a pay-wall, is brilliant.
---
Nurse killed a fuckton of,people in an aaylum, so unless all of them called Keanu Reeves a cunt, i’m pretty sure she’s just a killer
---
Sounds like these people would be the kind to not heal her if she came to them injured anyway.
---
I think the word your looking for is neanderthal

Moris ruin it, DCs can severely hinder it, but double pipping isn’t that hard until rank 4. 
---
Freddy’s is probably the hardest.
---
Edit: You can use add ons and offerings.
---
Holy shit! Nice job man!
---
Keeps eating my addons ;(
---
Thank you so much!
---
I absolutely love this idea.
---
I think it could be balanced if the gasoline trails were fairly small so the killer had to be clever and optimize its use. I just worry about a wall of fire around a poor hooked survivor lol. 
---
Perhaps, instead of a cooldown, the killer needs to periodically collect gas cans so the trade-off is giving up time to patrol gens to get gas.
---
Got to get my reading glasses and enjoy this good book.

Isn’t there some other matchmaking value? I seesaw between getting stomped to doing the stomping enough that it doesn’t really seem random.
---
WHAT'S THE POINT OF A PTB IF THERE'S NOTHING TO TEST AND YOU NEVER UPDATE IT?!
---
What if you don’t attach any?
---
The gen teleport will obviously help, but I'm not sure if it will be enough. I'm used to playing billy and just running across the map without any cooldown. And good survivors can counter billy pretty well. However, it is most likely too early to tell and you might be right, I don't know.
---
For a long time I played dbd on a shitty laptop on 20-25 fps on -70% resolution. 30 isn’t bad for a portable console
---
&gt; Ultimately, if survivors decide not to cure their sickness (Which is admittedly the smarter option), Plague is just an M1 killer 
---
An M1 killer you can't heal against. That's pretty challenging on average. Not to mention if one goddamn idiot decides to cleanse then until everyone has cleansed, she's a machinegun of death that instadowns people who haven't cleansed yet.
---
God I hate the survivor that cleanses halfway through the game. At least save it for the end.
---
I feel personally insulted. Dont get me wrong I wont complain when i dont switch but I feel bad now
---
You can usually get better at dbd by watching other more talented players play the game and learn from how they play. 
---
I would recommend damnohtml as he has some very educational content on how to run loops and a 3-hour video showing his winning streak with Speed Limiter Leatherface. 
---
A twitch guy by the name of Fungoose is one of the best killers I have ever seen. Very talented and is always happy to educate other players. 
---
Zubatlel is one of my favourite killer and survivors to watch. Incredibly talented player. Doesn't do much explanation on his actions but hes very good for learning slugging techniques.
---
1) No mori's allowed, must kill by hooks
---
2) I think there's a very small chance you can double pip if one person dcs but i would think you would have needed to at least hook them twice before the dc. Your best chance is with no dcs
---
3) You are allowed to use add ons and offerings. You can only use the 3 teachables and no other perks
---
4) Yes you have to get a double pip. You double pipping is directly tied to emblems and not points. 
---
5) It's not really about which killers are 'easier' it's about how you play according to the emblem system. No matter what you have to follow the emblem system, while some killers are easier in some ways, it's more about how much pressure you can apply. My biggest recommendations are this:
---
Hook everyone 3 times to guarantee iridescent devout emblem. If you are using a character who can 1 shot, do not do it. You have to land a certain amount of M1's so you want to regular hit as many times as possible. When you win you want there to be as many gens left as possible. Also you want to always be kicking gens. The more they have regressed the better chance you have at iridescent. and finally for your chaser emblem, you simply want to end chases quickly and get into many chases. You get points just for finding someone so if you see someone, initiate chase, and then decide to go kick a gen, you actually helped yourself because the chase technically ended quickly and you got points just for spotting.
---
Hope this helps (:
---
Yea 30 is bad compared to what machines are capable of these days. However, 30 fps doesn't mean unplayable.
---
pretty sure hes just disgusted at the sight of a salad
---
Most survivors who say that are just toxic, don't listen to them, play how you feel is the best!
---
But in short, camping is when you hook a person and just keep patrolling the single hooked person rather than looking after the gens, which itself is just punishable due you losing a lot of generators as you keep looking after that single hooked survivor to not let anyone unhook them, it's their own fault for trying to save them if you're staying with the hooked person rather than fixing the generators.
---
Tunneling is basically chasing a single person down majority of the game, no matter how long it takes, which again, is also punishable as hell on it's own for the same reason. Just play how you like and see working, it isn't your fault they make mistakes instead of punishing such a playstyle.
---
Is it RP or just sad?
---
What’s the sound off?
---
I JUST GOT CHASED FOR 3 GENERATORS DESPITE THE KILLER AND I BOTH RUNNING PAST MULTIPLE GENS THAT WERE AUDIBLY BEING WORKED ON THEN FACECAMPED BECAUSE THE KILLER WAS MAD THAT HE GOT GENRUSHED AFTER MAKING NO ATTEMPTS TO APPLY PRESSURE TO THE OTHER SURVIVORS! IM SO TIRED OF THESE TINY EGO KILLERS RUINING GAMES FOR PEOPLE BECAUSE THEIR FEELINGS GOT HURT BY THEIR OWN SHITTY DECISIONS

Honestly I wish I knew, it wouldn’t surprise me if it was a voice track for some type of Vocaloid program.

Being "better" does not mean you need to stop camping or tunneling, if for "better" you mean always getting 4 kills, a real experienced killer recognizes the situation and makes the best possible move, and sometimes that move is to camp or tunnel. Do not let the criticisms (or rather cry) of others impact you, play the way you like, that's why you paid for the game, right?. If you want to learn from the experience of others, you can see creators of content on youtube or twitch. If you have a specific question, we are here to answer
---
The Ghost Face we got is not the Ghostface from Scream. They did not acquire the rights to any part of the Scream intellectual property, they got the rights from the mask manufacturer.
---
she isn't because the GF we got it's not indeed GF and the only licensed thing about him is actually the mask
---
Also seeing them hugging that window waiting for their end
---
pebble too op pls nerf!!!! :p
---
This is not verifyably true, it is my hypothesis from playing a lot of spirit. To succesfully grab someone off a gen the entire animation has to complete while they are still holding the action button. I think the reason this happens is that the survivor lets go of the gen in the middle of your animation so the game changes it to a swing. This is more common at higher ranks as ive seen where players generally have higher reaction speeds and can let go on command when you appear. Especially true once players realize what you are doing, they will always try to take the hit and run.
---
Heck the guy who dcd when I was going to mori him for my ritual and then later sent me messages calling me trash, not cash money.
---
THEY DEFINITELY NEED TO INCREASE THE PALLET INTERACTION RANGE SINCE RIGHTFULLY NERFING THE PALLET VACUUM. KILLERS ARE STILL FINE THOUGH
---
The 18th
---
Some people use late game builds
---
It’s a Switch, what are you expecting
---
The difference is this game isnt free to play
---
Best advice for a baby killer to avoid camping and tunneling: don't even worry about killing survivors. Hook someone then go hunting for the next meat. Whether they got hooked once already or haven't at all, whether they're injured or not, you see someone, you go after them, you see a pumping gen, you kick it. Just act like you're instinct-driven and forego strategy.
---
You will on average have a better time since it's much less stressful and lets you better concentrate on the chases themselves, and you will on average get more points and less complaints than if you camped or tunneled.
---
Learning Leatherface's perk Barbecue and Chili is pretty damn helpful for this approach, it points you in the right direction for your next chase and gives you a whole asston of extra blood points.
---
That way he can have multiple trails and light the one he is closest too.
---
Thanks man
---
Imo 30 for how demanding dbd can be sometimes as it isnt optimized the greatest is amazing for the switch. The switch considering even Bethesda's Wolfenstein 2 runs at 30 fps dropping to 360p at times. So this is a win more so for behavior it's a start now if Panic Button was helping them with it I'm sure they could minimize the size much more for more frames
---
This is also an issue on PC. If the killer closes the game, everyone gets disconnected, don't get any bp, and even lose a point on your rank. It's infuriating.
---
typical unreasonable toxic anti-SJW
---
you're so [obsessed](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/btxemx/ek_snatches_my_friends_bracelet_ed_shouts_at_us/epx2xnp/?context=3) with a meme caricature of people you disagree with it's amusing.
---
This. I have never DC'd out of a game but there was one time I was like || close and it wasn't even because of the killer.  
---
I was playing with what I assume was a 3-man SFW group, because all were playing as matching Nea's and had matching names. At some point in the match I'm running from the killer, one of the Nea's is running kinda parallel to me while running from him as well (he could see both of us), and I decide to zig zag and hide in a locker. The killer didn't notice this but the Nea who was running with me saw it, ran back and baited the killer, and ran right over to me and opened the locker in front of him. She then vaulted away. Lmao.   
---
Of course I got snatched up and I was fucking livid. I hate asshole teammates, especially SWF who sacrifice the non-SWF in order to win.
---
I disliked the first scream when I saw it as a kid too lol. I was usually scared of horror movies but this one I found dumb. 
---
I can’t say I dislike it because it’s dated well I’m not that old but I love all the old horror movies.
---
Well shit...
---
I feel that the original was fine. Pretty standard serial killer story. Normal, boring office worker during the day, just waiting for the sun to go down so he can let lose and relieve some frustration. Your guy just happened to grab the mask while fleeing from an accident
---
The only time I clense is at endgame or deathhook
---
Just pull your self off next time.
---
Yeah tbh these kind of people are partially the reason why I don’t even post on reddit anymore cause you’re just gonna get constantly harassed if you confront them or even spit a word from your mouth. It’s disgusting. I’m glad you’re not like that homie 🙌🏻
---
How does not healing make things at all challenging? You still run her at any loop. Good survivors don't even bother healing anyway, unless there's reason to (Like We'll Make It or a survivor in the basement). And cleansing once someone finally "breaks the seal" isn't hard since the rest of the fountains are available and they're pretty abundant.
---
That is a significant buff. Interested to see how it plays out.
---
He seems alot better but still kinda weak. Edit: I feel the exposed effect is kinda too long maybe lower it by 5ish seconds but besides that he seems generally ok now edit 2 electric boogalo: these changes may seem good on paper but I want to see them in game to see if they make him actually balanced or just OP.
---
I like the original too I just also like reading what other people write, and seeing as ghostface is my favorite movie killer I’d like to read more story’s about people with a motive who put on the mask.
---
So what's the difference between the Ghostface in DBD and the actual Ghostface from the original movie?
---
I AM FUCKING. SICK. AND. TIRED. OF GETTING HIT 5 FEET AWAY FROM WINDOWS AND THEN MY CHARACTER RUBBER BANDS BACK TO THE WINDOW. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK.
---
These changes seem really good, what he should have been on the PTB release, can’t wait to play him next week
---
[PTB survivors when they see the changes](https://media1.tenor.com/images/d3ecb83c2970a6041a0ad43698883b57/tenor.gif?itemid=5025900)
---
&gt; The global audio cue when activating Night Shroud has been removed
---
The range of Ghost Face’s audio has been reduced to 8m from 16m when Night Shroud is active
---
These are good changes that will make his stealth more viable. Now he's more in line with Pig &amp; Myers who have loud breathing and Wraith who has his footsteps plus bell ringing.
---
Okay. So since I bought the base game for $10, all additional content that gets created should be free?
---
No one needs cosmetics. No one forces you to buy them. You want it, pay for it. It’s in game clothing with arbitrary value.
---
WHAT PRE GAME CHAT, I PLAY ON CONSOLE. EVEN IF I SAY " HEY, CLEANSE TOTEMS YOU GUYS" I WOULD GET BIG OLD FUCK YOU CUNT MOST OF THE TIME. PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY GAMERS ARE KNOWN TO FOLLOW ORDERS FROM A RANDOM DUDE. YEA, ITS ALSO SMART TO CLEANSE TOTEMS IN OBVIOUS LOCATIONS AND LEAVE THE ONE WHICH IS WELL HIDDEN TO BE NOED TOTEM IN THE END, BRILLIANT PLAN.
---
AND OF COURSE ITS COST TIME. THOSE SECONDS FOR CLEANSING TOTEM NEAR THE GENERATOR COULD MEAN A FINISHED GEN, OR A GEN WHICH YOU GET CHASED FROM, KILLER KICKED IT AND REGRESSED A LOT WHILE YOU GET CHASED. 
---
LOVE YOUR PLAN ABOUT ALL 4 PEOPLE DOING TOTEMS, IN SOLOS IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN, IN HIGH RANKS ESPECIALLY, WHERE DOING TOTEMS MEANS YOU ARE CLAUDETTE WANNABE.
---
Can I use this for a pfp? It's really cute!
---
STOP FUCKING TUNNELING ME OFF THE HOOK YOU PIECES OF SHIT
---
Yeeeaaaaaah.  That’s the shit I’m talking about.   I love being Mori’d.
---
Not cleansing could maybe cause exhaustion as well as the broken status, I'm not sure if that's overboard or not though.
---
Use whispers so you know when to sneak, and learn to use her sneak at pallets to mind game. Also if anyone says "dont", do what you want :) this game is about having fun and everything is viable at rank 12ish :)
---
they're so pretty!! the leatherface is so accurate lmao
---
Watch PsychoScorpionz on Twitch. Best Pig main streamer and he will answer every question you have on playing her.
---
I mean, just look at this: https://www.twitch.tv/psychoscorpionz/clip/NastyVictoriousYogurtOneHand
---
So now the survivors don’t even need to look around. If they are being staked and looked at, it’ll notify the survivor!?
---
The prestige for Ghostface was changed in the ptb from the leaked dev build. The mask has more blood than it used to.
---
Very epic
---
u/glenOck
---
Sounds like your area of expertise!
---
Take your upvote and post cat memes somewhere else!
---
Try discord
---
Ah that's what I figured
---
&gt; I feel the exposed effect is kinda too long maybe lower it by 5ish seconds
---
Myers has 60 seconds to down every survivor on the map. GF has 45 and he can down only one... Doesn't sound too long for me.
---
There was a decent amount of pallet around the map but it was clear that these two loops took their toll
---
I swear to god, if people start complaining about him being OP...
---
I got this!
---
Stealth i begin, use crouch for mindgames at pallets use all traps, no tunneling but hit them if seen. Oink a lot and use ruin+enduring+spirit fury and something you like.
---
Only just read the lore 1/2 days ago. Apparently an actual plague hit her city and she helped the priests with rituals to heal people. Eventually the priests got sick aswell and she kept performing the rituals by herself to heal people untill she in the end also got sick. She then exiled herself for her failure or something and along with some of her followers went into a cave and died.
---
That's the blood hunt.  Anniversary event comes after
---
This scene is why I have a phobia of hypodermic needles
---
Wraith also has his very noticeable snarls when he's close and cloaked.
---
Leatherface isn’t viable they said.
---
I Read "this is brilliant" in Farmer John's voice
---
Why isnt Claudette on there?
---
Pretty sure I read something something about a notification to survivor that is being stalked. That’s still a big weakness right there. Literally they don’t even have to look around now.
---
What changes? Link plz.
---
Hahaha, username checks out. No wonder you're happy.
---
They talked about increasing the amount of him that has to be on screen, but I hope you can still spot him from just his head, otherwise that'll be really tricky.
---
gRrr I hAT cHelLengrs!!1! LEt me wIiIn fR fReE!!!!
---
thanks for the info
---
I personally wouldn't like that. Makes for some boring survivor interactions. Probably not a good base power thing.
---
Oh he's gonna be OP as hell!
---
It's the 45s exposed coupled with a *cumulative* 4 second stalk time that is ridiculous.
---
Plus the lack of a red stain, EVER, when stealthed means you get ezpz mindgames.
---
This is a good step to fix him before release.  Let's hope he's now able to be a worthy killer to play as and not an auto-F anymore.
---
I am very excited! Scream is my favorite movie of all time tbh, and I had been super disappointed to find out we wouldn’t be getting Sidney or a map with him and then even *more* disappointed to find out Ghost Face himself was super weak. These changes definitely make me much more excited! And yeah, I’m hoping he’s not super hard to spot, but perfectly in the middle.
---
I feel ya on that
---
Hell yeah
---
I notice you are conveniently ignoring the PS4 and XBox Data. PS4 the Survival rate is Under 50% even at Rank 3.  I also believe this is only the Data for SWF.  
---
The fact that even players at Rank 3 in SWF are either below or barely at 50% Survival Rate is quite Informative
---
Camping is if the killer is still in the map after hocking someone
---
Now it's actually worth to buy
---
I didn't say it's impossible to get a hit. It does, however, make it much harder to have pressure. Hence why Billy can't do much against well-coordinated survivors, yet Nurse will shit on a team indiscriminately. 
---
A better question is what fucking tournaments you're even talking about.
---
He's gone from Freddy-tier to almost Hillbilly-tier.
---
I
---
AM
---
SO
---
EXCITED!
---
probably 2019
---
Had a bug with the spirit with gen grabbing at phase walking. I pressed at Claudette and the camera was stuck for a solid 20 seconds, I couldn't move or attack. It only got back to normal when she finished the generator, then I grabbed her. Was a really "WTF!?" moment.
---
I personally don't think he'll be OP but we don't know if he will as we haven't seen them in game plus these Developers do kinda make stuff that sounds good on paper but doesn't work out well .
---
Please yes. I love MK so much.
---
They aren't siblings in Halloween 1 ;)
---
In cases like that I think it's better to just treat him like Myers and dip behind cover. That might be what they are going for.
---
"Hey uh, Claudette, do you see that air moving towards us with threatening intent"
---
Yeah I prefer to wait until I say my final judgements but with alot of these changes he seems like he'll be very strong maybe OP but we have to wait and see.
---
Well the entity feeds off of torture but that doesn't mean I don't too
---
WHY  DO SOME KILLERS NEED SO MANY DIFFERENT PERKS FROM DIFFERENT CHARACTERS IN ORDER TO EVEN WORK?! I FINALLY GOT THE LEGION TO WORK AFTER I LEVELED UP THE HAG FOR RUIN, THE DOCTOR FOR MONITOR&amp;ABUSE, AND LEATHERFACE FOR B&amp;C! (THE LAST PERK IS NOED BTW! I KNOW FUCKING HATE ME FOR IT!) 
---
IT'S NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT FOR SURVIVORS REALLY BECAUSE WITHOUT SELF-CARE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME BUT AT LEAST THEY WORK!
---
Nice watermark for a dbd meme. A shitpost too...
---
from your user history, i see that you are very big pig main
---
No red stain in Night Shroud means he can mindgame certain loops (i.e., jungle gyms) when his power comes off cooldown and the survivor doesn't have clear line of sight. You could even play him as an M1 killer only and exclusively use Night Shroud for mindgames, if you were so inclined.
---
This is why I play Pig at red ranks. It takes a bit of know-how and a lot of skill, but you can hit at almost every loop with one dash.
---
Nasty
---
Object of Obsession is good too, this perk literally makes stealth killers ( Wraith, EW2 Myers, Pig, Ghost Face ) and trapping killers ( Trapper, Hag ) worthless, this perk is very strong used by a good survivor and especially in SWF teams, killers even don't chase OoO users because they know that these survivors are probably very good at looping and they will just waste too much of their time. 
---
Nobody likes to go against OoO users, especially if you don't play strong killers.
---
Thats why i say he needs a haste buff when a survivor is marked to make him more of a threat in chase.
---
I would keep Dwight on Frank's model since they're both the leaders of their group.
---

---
Random ones found on YouTube, I have no idea of the size and importance of these tournaments but they involve organized 4-man teams of red rank skill. Maybe that's just completely below your skill level and that's why you have a different perception of what "good players" do, namely, not bother healing.
---
r/UnexpectedPrequelMeme
---
“The off-screen detection indicator is now visible for the entire duration of the reveal phase”
---
If you have Netflix it’s one Netflix man.
---
Can confirm, I would consider myself the Pig guy, so anything about Pig must be approved by me or else....nothing happens since I have no real power.
---
I can only imagine what the Feng must have thought.
---
wtf were they doing???
---
It's good in certain hands but bc of how difficult it is to use and considering how it can bone over Surviviors at the start of the game since it will trigger while the camera is auto panning, I'd argue the general community should not regard it as anything above mid tier.
---
I believe that's sort of what they're doing with the cosmetic contest. It'd be nice to have contests every once in a while rather than just for the anniversary though.
---
Haha that's why i said "If it works as intended" because if looking at him does work as they want it to, knocking him out of the power will not be very easy. In some cases you will have to actually get up and go toward him to knock him out of it. But yeah i'm curious to see how this does in the ptb. I kinda want him to still require skill and hopefully stalking people won't be a braindead task that any dummy can do. We'll have to see how it looks on the ptb
---
OP? I can't see that from the notes.
---
And even if he'll end up OP on release, it's way easier to nerf than to buff, I think.
---
It protects you if you time it right. Pallets shouldn't be free God zones like they used to be.
---
If you like horror you've got a new movie you need to watch! Carrie is the title :D
---
WHEEEEEZE. You made my day.
---
This response goes against your original comment and i'm confused
---
That's not very BigBrain of you
---
Hit
---
Thanks for your advice! I'm pretty sure Halloween is gonna win!
---
I think you misread my comment then. I was saying that BHVR are stepping in the right direction with Ghostface by making him powerful.
---
intersting idea. But i'm curious if it be possible to knock him out of the power mid chase to reveal the red stain
---
I agree with Mr. Dong. I play both sides as well
---
I personally feel these changes will make him strong but who knows. I wouldnt want him to be OP on release though as will probably get nerfed to ground I'd rather them release him in a kinda weak state and examine what people are saying that he is good and bad at and fix him but hey I'm not a game developer.
---
Claudette is shown as the 4th person
---
I NEVER SAID ALL 4 SHOULD BE CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR TOTEMS, ONLY ALONG THE WAY. AND IF YOU’RE THAT HIGH RANK AND STILL CAN’T FIND ALL 6 TOTEMS THATS A YOU PROBLEM. YOU SHOULD KEEP A MENTAL NOTE OF HOW MANY TOTEMS HAVE BEEN CLEANSED NOT JUST CLEANSE THE ONES BY GENERATORS AND FORGET ABOUT THE OTHER ONES. AND NOW THAT I KNOW YOU’RE CONSOLE THAT’S A DIFFERENT STORY, CONSOLE IS GARBAGE AND YOU CAN’T HAVE FAITH IN RANDOMS. AND ONCE AGAIN YOU TALK ABOUT WASTING TIME YET ALMOST ALL CONSOLE SURVIVORS IMMEDIATELY START SPENDING 15 MINUTES LOOKING FOR RUIN, I SEE THIS WHEN I’VE WATCHED MY BROTHER PLAY ON CONSOLE. AND EVEN MORE ON CONSOLE YOU CAN INVITE THEM TO PARTIES, BASICALLY SWF EVERY GAME SO WHY DON’T YOU? ONCE AGAIN IF YOU’RE THAT HIGH RANK YOUR FELLOW SURVIVORS SHOULD KNOW THE BENEFITS OF COMMUNICATION, IF NOT THAT JUST SHOWS HOW MUCH OF A BOT HIGH RANK XBOX PLAYERS ARE.
---
On ps4, 30, 15 in a corn field. Sometimes I can count the frames as they pass by ;)
---
What do you mean? I see no 4th person
---
I have to be honest, i'm not sure what that even means. What is the detection indicator? And by "reveal phase" that means only when he is being revealed, not mid stalk
---
sorry, but what's Oink...is this some kind of term that pig mains use?
---
Just pay attention to your surroundings. It’s a 1.5 second cancel.
---
Yeah motive is important and I agree the BHVR one is pretty weak but I don’t see anything wrong with it. Maybe you could just interpret it as a group with different backstories like the movies
---
30 plus clever use of motion blur (not spyro trilogy levels of motion blur) can look alright, especially on a smaller device.
---
Getting hit by pallets, the Pig has a cute Oink stun noise, it is really cute so get hit with enduring so you get max Oinks!
---
Hang in there baby :)
---
He tried to hatch grab btw
---
Yep I really want him to take skill but these changes make me feel he'll be very strong but I will wait until we get footage if he is OP or not because who knows maybe he'll be extremely bad still or be extremely strong or actually balanced
---
This is why we’ll never have proximity chat in games now, people are so soft
---
Kids aren’t even supposed to be playing these games and anyone over the age of 13 can hear a curse/slur without losing their shit
---
ah okay i see now. Your 2 lines weren't connected my bad. So you think he will be powerful but not top tier. I mean any killer without the ability to zip across the map already kind of misses out on being top tier but if exposing and downing people is as easy as it seems he has a good chance
---
Or
---
Ok this is getting creepy and appealing at the same time
---
Well he does have 45 seconds now, should be fairly reliable to get kills with.. no red stain and insta down should make counterplaying looping reliable enough of a power.
---
Don't forget the Grim Pantry main building or the Halloween fence that has one vault but is so long that the killer can't bloodlust you. Those are just some of the worst offenders off the top of my head.
---
Well all characters cost $80. I know you can get most (not all, especially some that have great perks or powers can't be gained free) 
---
You can unlock some by playing but it takes a long time and you can't use those cells to buy cosmetics either.
---
Or at least give her add-ons for increasing crouching movement speed, Ghost Face has 4, she has none ...
---
I hope for Xbox PS4 crossplay, but I hope we don’t get lumped with switch players ever
---
You say I am the only one to complain, go search for pig buff. Atleast 30 other players have asked for it this month alone.
---
They
---
That also fits the character of ash Williams. Even after he triumphs, he gets a nice bite in the ass at the end of each movie. Except army of darkness.
---
Basically legion but not connected
---
What it's like to play Wraith without Spirit Fury AND Enduring.
---
FTFY
---
THOT DESTROYED
---
All her add-ons are trash. (not all but I need to bring a point across), They could rework her add-ons and fix every problem she has.
---
I loved the shape..... now I love eye bleach
---
This meme is a mess
---
I'm on pc..
---
Right on playa
---
I have a sneaking suspicion you don't actually run much killer
---
Correct. It takes a long time because they want you to spend money on some of them instead of grinding for them. For me, that's okay. I'll buy what I want on sale. Again, new content costs money. They aren't making this game out of the goodness of their own hearts. They want to make money too.
---
What’s identity V?
---
It's just a bullshit hit.
---
I definitely agree. They buffed everything at the same time so if they decide to make changes it will be hard to decide if the exposed part is too long, or the knocking him out of the power will be too hard. Idk as long as knocking him out of the power is as challenging as i'm imagining it's going to be, he will at least be a decent killer with an actual power at that point
---
I play console mostly and a steady 30 fps feels decent, which is mostly when I play survivor.
---
However playing killer is prone to dipping which really fucks with the game play.
---
As long as the switch is a solid 30 fps then its it's good.
---
Idk if people are getting ready for Ghostface or what
---
Ooo hell yes
---
In regards to Leatherface needing work, I don't really think so but I'm not a main. The only thing I would change is increased reach with chainsaw or charge speed with it since you have to be right on top of them to start charging to land a hit. Beyond that I see no real issues personally with his character
---
I mean, "don't slap people who can kick your ass" shouldn't be too hard a guideline for anyone to follow.
---
Or just do a gen...
---
Am I the only one that noticed that literally all of the complaints also had some variant of 'killer is too fast'?  It seems like what the poster wants is killers that move below even base speed, since they literally called just about every killer too fast except the one that needs blinks just to catch up to survivors
---
*Reads proposed changes from the community*
---
Would you look at that, where the hell have I been the whole time?
---
I really enjoy his rumbling sound . If anyone have that I'll like to listen to it
---
Dude I feel ya. I hate selfcare with a passion such a waste of time.
---
THANK YOU FOR AGREEING WITH ME
---
Billy has the best map pressure in the game and he doesn't have to waste time stalking to gain his instant down. I see no point in comparing him to Ghost Face, which doesn't have map pressure and his instant is limited.
---
I mean, what part of "everybody" do you not understand?
---
I had a plague game like this recently. Spirit as well. Survivors, dont group up too much! Some killers will just down one after the other.
---
I wonder if you can face stalk (aka, if you still get stalk progress while they are looking at you), because if yes (and even with a no to some extend), you can just stalk to 99 percent, deactivate your power, get in a chase and trigger your power (and the stalk of the last 1 percent) during the chase, getting your exposed effect of like a Myers. Add to that that depending on the structure they try to loop you, you have no red stain even while walking normally, and GF could be pretty scary to face, since he might already have stalked you to 99% while you weren't even aware of it
---
Spirit is the killer that makes you really think with every move . Like Nurse but fun to play against
---
Play killer, use offerings as often as possible, get Leatherface DLC and level him up to level 35 to unlock BBQ teachable and get this perk on your favorite killer
---
Why is self care garbage now
---
Maybe Jeff will get a brewery outfit at some point - but yeah, you're right. Would love to see painter Jeff in the future.
---
I'd love to participate but I'm having a tough time staying awake
---
Oh he's OP, but he has to be to sell the DLC.
---
Worst case, though, is that you'll have to wait until mid-chapter for a nerf.
---
Ez depip
---
But besides all that shit, what has Ruin done for us *lately*?
---
Excuse me, stop acting so competent BHVR.
---
He also has add ons that shorten the range you can spot him by plus fast stalks so he could definitely become OP with these add ons kinda like a certain killer that can hold the Knife just like Ghost face and just like Ghostface he was broken for 2 months then finally balanced. I feel like we got a legion situation because if he has a certain type of add on combo he'll become unfun but his base kit is generally ok or at least in my opinion. Because I feel the main problem will be his add ons and how good they are.
---
Are you really trying to defend a person wasting 32 seconds to heal against a map wide instadown on the off chance the pain grunts give them away? When they could do a gen, find the totem, LITERALLY anything else than waste time?
---
Oh definitely, I love tenacity. I just find it to be super niche unless paired with unbreakable. I wish they'd buff the reveal time of DH though, or at least let it activate even if it wasn't you who finished a gen.
---
Where can I check said changes?
---
Trapper makes me not trust grass. And spirit with beads makes me gen tap for days
---
What in God’s name were they doing?
---
I'm not even talking about that dude. I agree, the PTB is to get feedback and make adjustments. It's a test. But many people were quick to say there should be a test before the test and that the PTB wasn't a place for these kind of adjustments.
---
Yeah, they really should make a claudette skin, but then all the survivors would complain that she's harder to see than an invisible wraith
---
Did you actually read what I said, or are you still salty as shit over the match? Pain grunts are some of the biggest giveaways toward survivor locations. Not really a waste of time if it lessens their chances of getting found, is it?
---
I'm a killer main so I won't have to deal with this but I want survivors to actually play the game rather then pull the plug and DC when they see it's GF but I'll wait to see if I'm wrong or right. I'm hoping I'm wrong. He just feels like he will be Legion 2.0
---
HUUUGE BUFF, Thanks DBD. Even when he was bad I still have a lot of fun as this killer, being sneaky beaky
---
That's an indicator for The Ghost Face so that knows what direction he's being revealed from.
---
One thing caught my eye:
---
His crouched movement speed has been increased to 3.6 m/s from 3.45 m/s. 
---
Is this a typo? Watching the PTB, he didn't seem slower than the Nurse when crouched. 
---
I'm guessing they mean "increased to 4.6 m/s from 4.45 m/s"?
---
breh chill sorry to hurt your lil billy feelings. The guy said ghostface won't be top tier because he gets looped. billy is top tier and he can be looped. it wasn't a comparison, i was simply stating that you can be top tier and still be able to be looped
---

---
As neither of those two, I am also amused
---
Sort by hot and it should be 4th or 5th post down.
---
Yes. Yes it absolutely is.
---
Increased crouch speed: the real buff.
---
Gotcha
---
I agree because legion was a brain dead killer and ghost face could just as easily be braindead and stalking might be really easy but legion had a straight up exploit. Hopefully we never see anything like moon walking legion in this game ever again.
---
Make sure you both have an open nat. I used to have issues with dbd when I was wireless every now and then. Then i installed ethernet to the xbox, havent had an issue.
---
\*cries in oink\*
---
WHERES YOUR FUCKING CAPS LOCK MOFO??? 
---
YES, BUT THEN GET REVENGE WITH NOED WHEN THEY THINK YOUR BEING FRIENDLY, WORKS MOST OF THE TIME :)
---
Never
---
All of this is pretty much exactly what Ghostface needed. Interested to see how he plays on PTB after the buffs. I hope he's at least halfway decent now, the idea/playstyle they're going for really seems fun to me.
---
Hello there
---
Im pure killer main and my Statement to everything you said is: "No"
---
Nah
---
What happend to my BHVR?
---
I know that. But if they made it available through shards it wouldn't be a big deal and they wouldn't lose that much money. Shards are still hard to get so either someone buys that outfit or a new character. Either way if they want both they have to pay. It just gives them the option.
---
They probably wouldn't need as much money if they planned ahead. For instance.
---
Also a lot of their money goes into reworks now. Which I'm glad they are doing reworks but it takes a ton of money to do one. Look at freddy. It probably took months to fix him which means they need to put staff for sound effects, visual effects, coding, and so much more. Which this cost probably took all the money they made releasing freedy. 
---
So yeah they probably need the money but it's due to the team releasing killers in a state where they don't work.
---
I guess it proves you right in a way that they are a company and the bottom line is money but a huge financial burden could be stopped by getting some people from the community who are experienced in the game, make them sign some NDA's and then discuss ideas on what they want to add that would work.
---
On jungle gyms you  can just moonwalk anyway and at pallets it doesn't help much if not at a all.
---
Time to throw pallets to scare myself and the killer
---
I REALLY, REALLY WISH THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY OF A SEPERATED LOBBY, EXCLUSIVELY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DONT WITH ALL THE TOXIC BULLSHIT AND DETERMINED TO PLAY THE GAME IN A DECENT AND FAIR WAY FOR BOTH SIDES.
---
AS A SURVIVOR, I'M DONE WITH ALL THE FUCKING TUNNELING AND CAMPING. CAN YOU FUCKING STOP? I'M TRYING TO PLAY A GAME HERE AND YOU COMPLETELY PREVENT ME FROM DOING SO!
---
AS A KILLER, I'M DONE WITH SURVIVORS THAT THINK THEY'RE THE GREATEST FUCKING ASSCLOWNS IN THIS GAME, DOING THEIR SHITTY LITTLE FLASHLIGHT THING AND TEABAGGING AND SHIT. EIGHT OUT OF TEN TIMES, YOUR ASS WILL STILL END UP DEAD ON HOOK.
---
IT'S JUST DRAINING ENERGY. WHY DO YOU HATE OTHER PLAYERS SO MUCH? THE MAIN REASON I PLAY KILLER THESE DAYS IS TO GIVE A POSITIVE EXAMPLE. FUCK THIS SHIT! I WANT A GOOD GAMING EXPERIENCE! I DON'T CARE IF I DIE FIRST, OR IF I GET A 0K, AS LONG AS EVERYONE HAD FUN!
---
the blood tracking addon is bullshit
---
Because with the healing nerf it takes about a year and a half to do now, and gives the killer a ton more time to get pressure on the map.  If you feel you cant live without self care, just bring med kits.  They're still viable.  If you dont have medkits to spare, run pharmacy.  
---
I personally enjoy empathy when i solo q, so i can always find another wounded friend and start a healing party!

This...does put a smile on my face
---
I’d say for survivors and killers whoever you choose you have to use their three perks and then your choice for the last one. Also maybe no items and add-on over green? I feel like those could be good. Also no one can play the same survivor.
---
ROFL, so ignore all data because someone who seems to wear a tin foil hat says so. Sounds like a solid plan
---
I don't think that was ever an intended mechanic. They didn't mention but i'm almost 100% sure that was bugged
---
PIG MAIN HERE, PLEASE USE SELF CARE EVERYONE. 
---
I LOVE SLOPPY BUTCHER + NURSE'S CALLING
---
Honestly so what if she was, right? Look at the different skintones on Billy, Jake, Dwight. It's common to change it up a bit. Since when has diversity been something you tryina stray away from
---
Hard to say how the changes will effect him, but I'm very excited to see they are willing to try these things already. It usually takes months after release (Spirit).
---
Rip your karma
---
In my experience, the second group is just the first group as perceived by somebody who's overly defensive of a video game. People will talk about the distinction, but in practice, there's basically nobody who was "legit pissed the killer was shit in the TEST server." I'm sure there were like one or two people who felt that way, but it was mostly just normal people talking about how much Ghostface sucked in their experience, and a few streamers who were pissed because they would've liked to stream the PTB but they didn't find it any fun because he was broken.
---
The idea of him having to be pointed at i heard floating around still sounds like a better way to cancel it then having to look at him.
---
Okay, because that was a huge nerf to his potential.
---
Isn’t her new cosmetic literally her in Amanda’s clothes?
---
Be careful playing on tuesday nights.  Steam maintenance = Dbd down.
---
Is this Myers' buffed little brother?
---
I am inclined to agree, but I would rather go with this and see how it turns out. 20 seconds was just way too low. If the survivor was anywhere near a pallet or window, you didn't get to use your power.
---
ENTITY DISPLEASED
---
Yeah but Legion was still OP even if you didn't use the exploit because he had Frank's mixtape and Cold dirt and Ghost face has the caught on tape I believe which is his Ultra add on(that reduces the time to stalk tremendously) he also has the Victim schedule (or notes I forget the names but its a purple add on) that shrinks how far you can spot him so I feel that combination could be very unfun. I just feel Ghostface is in a awkward position with these changes
---
Dead By Guns
---
It is pretty [Disingenuous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disingenuous) to call her JUST an M1 Killer. Her power is basically a permanent NOED if nobody heals
---
Yeah that was pretty much spot on lmao
---
"Need as much money" this is where your line of thinking is wrong. they don't have a quota. they want to maximize profits. I agree with you completely, I think they allocate resources improperly. They put very little effort into Killer balancing until after-the-fact, which shows they're offloading testing on to us to cut development time and costs. But that's not why their business model is the way it is. It is this way because they want to make as much money as possible, not as much money as necessary.
---
Love Vince (aka Scott)
---
He’s prob a D-C rank killer now with the buff
---
The only issue I have is I wish there were an indicator for her black incense. With legion for example, yes they also have global detection, but you know it because of the terror beats. If there were some kind of indicator for the survivors, then they can either choose to be constantly revealed, or they can give plague her corrupt purge.
---
Most ultra rares are , but arguebly makes her a better doctor
---
Most likely just a typo. I didn’t notice that when I first read it
---
It’s the pants are baggy it’s not her ass
---
Miss (after Huh we will be finished as I don't want this to go on for a long time)
---
I was talking about that thing that will have quests/missions to do and will reward you with bloodpoints and cosmetics for doing it. When they showed it in the live stream the only thing they showed was catch one survivor in a bear trap after a vault. I'm guessing that they will have other specialized conditions that will require players to learn/use other killers to do specialized things like maybe down down 2 or more survivors at once with Leatherface or Perform 2 grabs with the Spirit.
---
Brand new parts?  I havent bought one of those off my blood web in a loooong time....
---
Thats the intriguing part is we don't know how this is going to look and what changes they think will need to be made. I'm definitely happy for a strong killer but i'm not excited to see crying survivors who think the game should be easy.
---
(Disclaimer: not a killer main so people please don't downvote like crazy because i said survivors have the capacity to be cry babies)
---
Old tinkerer was kind of gamebreaking... the devs even said "They didnt want to release any new power bar killers since tinkerer was a thing." It was really hurting their design space, but ouch is it useless now
---
HiDe
---
Wait, *that's* what you're saying is wrong? That there should be internal testing more than two weeks before release? How is that even controversial? Ask any project manager at any software company, "Should we work on a feature for months and not do testing aside from a public test two weeks before release?" and I guarantee they will not come out on your side on this.
---
That's much quieter now, it'll probably only alert you if he's right ontop of you.
---
Not by release but I heard soon after
---
Looking for "pig is best" ammo or something? lmao
---
Costume for legion or survivors?
---
I laughed a little harder than I should have xD
---
You know hillbilly's speed addons? Picture the best ones, but they work twice as fast
---
Please no
---
I mean, apparently they did.  Some of the issues with Ghostface were so glaringly obvious it's kind of amazing they even got into the PTB to begin with.  *Nobody* noticed the instant stalk-cancel effect until it went live??
---
Simple but great.
---
Farmer John and No0b3 anyone?
---
I'll set... you on fiiiiiire
---
Red stain change is BIG, ultimate mind games coming up, this is gonna be scary to loop
---
I agree.  I mean when she was still in testing it was a bug that the glasses were on all the time , and i thought it was essential,  but now that i play her it's not even worth the slot . The one that speeds her up is not worth it to because no scratch marks , almost every killer's pink addons have more bad than good in them
---
Yup we'll see. I'm gonna be all over that PTB tomorrow because i'm very interested to see where this lands him as far as tier. Also want to see what bugs come with this because they're inevitable and were pretty much a huge reason he has been so unplayable
---
40 SECONDS???? He might as well be Myers. 40 seconds is completely unfair oml
---
Thanks for posting this man. I’ve been looking to see if it was changed all over. I’m definitely p3ing Wazzup boi
---
Same thing happened to me in the EXACT same area 😂
---
Yea you really feel bad for her in saw 2.  Less so in saw 3.
---
Good changes but I'm worried they didn't mention anything about how powerful object of obsession is against him despite mentioning that being an issue during the intial backlash. Hopefully it'll be addressed in the official ptr patch notes.
---
* Increased the amount of the Killer that needs to be visible in order to begin revealing 
---
That's actually pretty big too. It means if he's leaning around corner while stalking you, there's probably not enough of him visible to be revealed, so you'll just have to run and hide even if you do spot him.
---
Probably a camping wraith main...
---
Please god just give her 100% crouch speed already. She’s not incredibly strong as it is, she just has sooo much potential to be better if tweaked a little bit.
---
Ok well I'm hoping I'm wrong as I want him to be balanced but it doesn't seem like it but yes this was a nice discussion have a good one I guess if you don't make another post idk
---
Thankfully I had grinded perfectly a week after his release in the ptb.
---
His original bloody mask was so underwhelming, it was like P3 Doc tier, hardly different than the normal head.
---
I like this P3 a lot too :D
---
He can't stalk when not in shroud. So you'll have to be keeping out of their vision while in chase if you want to do that.
---
Getting 45 seconds exposed status effect for stalking someone for 1.5 seconds, you can just stalk while chasing someone...
---
I'm glad to see he has made a comeback after his horrible PTB release.
---
Still a bit concerned regarding the whole detection aspect of his power considering the number of maps that lack LOS blockers. They never mentioned his issues with corn so concerned that they may have left it as it was in the PTB
---
A bit upset though that they didn't alter his perks to make them have some kind of use.
---
I already got a machine gun full.
---
It’s more a matter of consistency (Tier 3 EW, Corrupt Purge, things like that), and remember, they only need to see you for 1.5 seconds where you have to stalk for 4. With only 20 seconds of exposed, it was often wasted because there was no way you weren’t going to get looped before it was over
---
That's kinda how it works. If only like 10 people complained about it, they wouldve been less likely to change it.
---
:O holy shit you're right. I can't wait to try this!
---
No you aren't, not with all the crutches and extra chances survivors have now.  
---
You have to down them after they were hooked, but they were rescued with someone with BT, so they don't go down. Then then go in a locker, forcing you to pick them up, and get DSed. Then MoM absorbs a hit. Then gens are done and adrenalin pops, you don't have NOED or all totems are down, so they get another free hit and free speed boost. Then if they have an insta heal they can use it. By that time 30 exit games have time to be opened and they are gone.
---
Does it go Body to Mask or Mask to body I'm curious because I want to do a lot of combinations with the body instead of the mask plus I'm ready to prestige him basically instantly when he comes out
---
How he is even closer to be OP ?
---
He breaks the game mechanics like Nurse ? No !
---
He has mobility and map pressure like Hillbilly ? No !
---
He can counter looping effectively like Spirit or Hag ? No !
---
Spine Chill and Object of Obsession still hard counter him too. His power is worthless against these 2 perks and I don't know why he still doesn't have immunity against detection perks in Night Shroud. His stalk also doesn't give him any other benefits than exposed status.
---
Myers for example has immunity to detection perks in EW1 and he has in EW3 a longer exposed status effect on all survivors at once, faster vault speed and longer lunge range. 
---
You can play mind games with Night Shroud around loops or jungle gyms, but you can already do this with Pig and her crouch and Ambush attack. And Ghost Face's stealth is on a cooldown, unlike Pig's stealth. And Pig's crouch speed is still faster than Ghost Face's crouch speed, but at least Ghost Face got some add-ons for his crouch speed. 
---
He still seems like a discount Myers and also he will be very map dependant, open maps like Autohaven Wreckers, Red Forest and Crotus Prenn Asylum or maps with corn like Coldwind Farm are gonna suck for him.
---
Too bad you can't hit the bong...
---
Ching chong bing bong
---
&gt; GF could be pretty scary to face
---
&gt; GF
---
/r/absolutelynotme_irl
---
Knife  --&gt;  Body  --&gt;  Mask. 
---
His prestige mask actually looks pretty good with his default body, it's kind of a shame, since his normal mask doesn't look as good on his prestige body.
---
Almost as stupid as every single PTB before this not having updates mid-PTB, and the killer not receiving the changes they needed until they went live (if they got those changes at all)
---
So let me get this straight. It took them weeks and hundreds of peoples' feedback to figure out that this killer is utter shit and this weakest killer ever. Well done BHVR, not only did you manage to make a killer worse than Freddy but you also buff him before buffing Freddy even though Freddy has been released for well over a year and Ghost Face is still only on the PTB. You have once again proved you are an incompetent company full of idiots.
---
Edit: I forgot to mention that they also nerfed Freddy shortly after his release, so please keep that mind before you try to white knight them.
---
I do have to agree with that, I’m All Ears sucks, Thrilling Tremors could be somewhat useful as a monitoring sort of perk, but I think Furtive Chase remains his best one
---
Myers is 60 at base, and this is 40 for one person. That’s a reasonable time once you get the notification as long as you don’t run out in the open.
---
Rank isn't necessarily any vestige of skill. I'd recommend watching some noteworthy streamers to see good survivor gameplay. Jendenise and ZubatLEL are my usuals.
---
Then by that logic, the killer could leave you slugged on the floor for a while, then pick you up and still get D-striked. That's not tunneling. Besides, if your teammates don't pick you up and heal you before the killer gets back to you, that's your team's fault and the killer shouldn't get punished for that.
---
I was about to say
---
Lol are you asking me why a fake non specific mystical power did or did not do something? The wraith clearly killed people too. So it’s not like that he’s innocent. The only true innocent one is plague. Then by your logic why was she chosen? 
---
There’s also ppl saying if you disobey the entity it makes you a killer too. So you don’t have to do something wrong. The entity could have done it...you can’t know.
---
40 for one person is quite some time...
---
I actually laugh because you really think that I care about Billy, LOL.
---
They were right to be annoyed. The killer was visibly terrible in ways that could have been figured out immediately by actually playing him, suggesting the developers have no real internal testing process. The PTB is supposed to be for ironing out kinks right before release, not making sure the killer functions on a basic level.
---
Add kitana Feng to the list after we get BUNNY FENG
---
I recommend looking back. It's quite the view.
---
Survivors have the same issue. If the killer decides to dc early on all of the survivors lose a pip. Its not fair for anyone.
---
Still no Carl :(
---
Huh
---
Lol.  Being better absolutely means you don't camp with gens up dude.  Over altruistic survivors that swarm hook in seconds while you're still there is one thing.  Routinely planning on staying to camp is a different thing entirely.  That's for trash players and it also loses far more games then it wins.
---
I can hear the to pic saying "Anything?"
---
&gt; I feel like he will be amazing low rank
---
everyone getting one shotted in seconds sounds really amazing and interactives for low ranks
---
I am more worried if the Devs fixed his issue with the corn. 
---
If not he is going to be powerless in Corn Coldwin farm maps considering the corn does not hide him and denies him his stalk.
---
If they do fix his stalk ability through corn, it might affect Myers stalking as they both utilise the same mechanic.
---
Going by past precedent (bad Pig changes etc.), they literally did.
---
Here's an idea:
---
If you don't want to be revealed, cleanse yourself.
---
You can't tell if the killer has Surveillance or Discordance, you need to feel it out.  If plague mommy is always up your ass when you're sick, maybe it's because she's got incense.  Time to clean up.
---
Bad ping
---
Is 'Killer Instinct' effect what Legion's frenzy red survivor symbol indicator is? 
---
Red stain removed for all stalking now just crouched is so nice, and the change to stalk progress is awesome but I seriously didn't expect them to actually go so far in buffing him. Definitely excited to see how he pans out now
---
I wanna insta teabag as Piggy
---
Lowest, it's the only option that removes the horrible anti aliasing.
---
#CEASE
---
Thank God because I think the devil mask and prestige Body will look great I also don't really like the bloody mask because the blood looks too light and not dark enough but hey we all have different opinions plus I mean I am prestiging all my killers so it isn't a big deal that the bloody mask looks odd.
---
Doesn't he take 4 seconds to fully stalk?
---
I like how there's a parade of sycophants patting themselves on the back saying, "See? You didn't need to complain!" when complaints were the only thing that got these changes made in the first place.
---
Legion
---
Truetalent has a shitload of killer videos on his YouTube.  He's a solid killer who provides a lot of info in his videos and plays all killers.  You can learn a lot from him starting out.
---
Is the see through walls part of Ghostface stalk going to be similar to Freddy?
---
I'm curious, why do you think Furtive chase is his best perk?
---
From my perspective, Thrilling Tremors seems to be the only perk he has that will actually impact the game but even then it's a minor impact. 
---
Furtive chase just seems to be a lot of effort for a very situational perk.
---
JUST had a game where the survivor escaped with a trap. Has to be a bug
---
K, I would choose Jake because it looks more like him
---
Brutal Strength (and I guess Enduring) is one of those peresults that sound really basic on paper but they're actually very good and OP. They can fit into almost any build.
---
With that being said, it doesn't work for end-game now, because if you have DS still saved at the end, you can just D-strike the killer for a free escape and they lose their kill.
---
I see you like taking my words out of context so I'll say this and be done with you, every skin in the game is at the bare minimum consistent with the original design's skin tone. Any differences in skin between costumes is either because of intense, thick layers of dirt or muck or because of the lighting. Entity's realm isn't a clean one. Plus if you look at the art Behavior have made just very recently for her Arts and Crafts set, she's quite evidently white. Making her black out of no where, not only would make no sense with her other cosmetic pieces as you could have mis-matched skin tones, but also because it'd be inaccurate to the developer's vision for the character.
---
Situation: 2 or 3 survivors around the hook. Your solution? Do not camp. Yeah... Good luck with that.
---
I would suggest lowest. 
---
The anti-aliasing in dbd makes the game appear blurry to smooth out the edges. As a result, the game appears out-of-focus and darker as a result.
---
While playing on the lowest you see all the textures more clearly as the blur like A-A is removed and everything is a bit brighter which makes the game substantially easier to play.

---
yo cat in the hat would make a great killer. imagine him having no terror radius but laughing when he gets close
---
hillbilly has high mobility and always an instant down, pls don't compare him to b tier killers.
---
I never knew that was Amanda. I've also never watched through an entire SAW movie
---
Exactly had a game the other night where everyone ended up on the gen I started by and as I went to go to another one I notice the Myers who in about 2 seconds went from tier one to tier 3.
---
Man if I get hit by a stranger, don't matter who it is I'ma Batista Bomb the bitch off the top rope through two tables ! NFG 💯
---
You can just walk to the pallet and they won't be able to relianly time the drop.
---
This is awesome, I was getting worried for my future main LOL
---
I also get that. The reason I said it wasn't about saying they shouldn't try to maximize profit, and only make as much as they need.
---
I said it it because they need to make that much money to sustain themselves. They have said they want to give as much "free" (earnable) content as they can, which is great. But people are getting upset most things you have to pay real money for.  
---
It's a balancing act. When you release something people have to pay money for people will get upset and depending how much and what is only available through real money they will be upset.
---
But if you make everything obtainable through gameplay you will make less money. The key is to make it so people are happy and still will pay money. Right now people are saying there is way less "free" stuff and they want more.
---
And honestly I agree. If they made this skin obtainable right now with shards as well only people who play the game constantly will be able to get this skin and other skins, killers, survivors die to the limited amount of shards you get through time. So most people would buy it with real money while feeling like they don't have to. Basically your making more money over time by releasing it as "free" since it makes the community happy.
---
Did.. did you bother reading that part in my comment about over altruistic survivors swarming the hook or are you just a fan of typing redundant replies?
---
It’s situationally average. Depending on location and routes, it could be enough time to get someone with their pants down or you may still get pooped depending on the area. If they just run in a straight line like a lemming, then sure but a decent player can evade the killer for 40 seconds easy.
---
At this moment, you could just simply start a Pig cube :D.
---
The survivors can hear your lunge and higher ranks will drop very quickly, also if they suspect a mind game pallets are often dropped early which completely counters it.
---
What is a Pig cube?
---
So many people were saying the BHVR wouldn’t fix him until he was added and then it would still be awhile. Well they fixed him before they even released him.
---
I have a theory that Sidney will be added eventually, since Ghost Face IS a “full” chapter, despite only being a killer. They’re gonna work on getting the rights to Scream, then Sidney will be added later down the line.
---
I wonder what kinda speeds he can get up to with the movement add-ons.
---
Are we really having a conversation about this?
---
Since stalk doesn't regress naturally, GF can potentially 99% the stalk and get an insta-down on a survivor later on in the match. Similar to Myers 99% tier 3 on a survivor. Interesting way of snowballing against survivors.
---
It do really be like that sometimes though, Sometimes survivors want me to give them a chance and go for another survivor once they unhook. I don't care, I'm killing whoever needs less hooks. You wanna win, I want win too.Living the Fred life ain't no joke, especially on high ranks.
---
Yeah same here. I was looking for that too and I'm surprised no one else mentioned it.
---
*Spins camera*
---
*Gun jams*
---
But with the buffer, and the short delay on the knocking him out of it, you may be able to tap it on quickly mid chase. Guess we'll have to wait and see.
---
Hillbilly can't remove his terror radius, has worse mindgames and can't reliably use his insta-down at loops/jungle gyms.
---
O h  y e s
---
Fair enough, I guess it’s the sort of situation I was thinking of using it. Things like pairing FC with Remember Me and situations like that. Thrilling Tremors is good no doubting that it’s just not **HIS** best option, but put TT on like a Nurse or Hillbilly and **GOOD LORD**
---
3.6 m/s is almost pig crouch speed though. I didn't get to play him on the PTB much so I'm not sure quite how slow he was, but poor pig if this is the case.
---
I'm really happy about how the stalker meter doesn't go down if you fail to get a stalk off. Super nice.
---
Monitor and Abuse, Lightborn, Spirit Fury and Enduring
---
Not saying it's fun or balanced for low rank, I'm just saying he will probably do well there.
---
At high ranks most people will look around especially on gens and even more so when they know its ghostface. 
---
Also I just realized if you have a swf group someone could just stalk ghostface. Sure you are down a survivor but he can't ever use his power. Maybe the indicator on where the survivor saw you will help prevent this but I doubt it.
---
I approve this SO much!
---
About the Freddy rework, guys: if Freddy won't put people to sleep himself, what will cause the dream state?
---
&gt;Being better absolutely means you don't camp with gens up dude.
---
If you say this, how can I don't say the same thing?. You contradict yourself if you say that but then say something like "unless the situation is...". You are giving a resounding NO to then put an exception, you realize that that does not make sense? Also, you are downvoting my comment for things that you are sure I said but I never did, when did I talked about "Routinely planning on staying to camp"? because that's what you said, not me
---
Very interesting, looking forward to seeing how this does in the future!!
---
If Myers is allowed to do it why can’t GF? Plus Myers gets exposed on ALL survivors when he hits Tier 3, Ghostface still has to stalk them individually. And I believe the stalk meter resets if they do get marked
---
I wouldn't be opening a message mid match on console, not on xbox anyway. You lose the audio from the game, with my luck; the killer would see me stand still
---
That's not Tapper, is it? Looks like it's just a statue of him.
---
You could have just downed him and chased after the unhooker. It stalls the game because someone else will likely come to try and save the guy on the ground and you’ll be chasing another which is at least three survivors not doing gens which is beneficial to the killer.
---
You can only ever give the hatch to the last survivor alive.
---
Ask them if they forgot that.
---
Maybe they should have stayed alive for the hatch.
---
Thanks for the really long strategy. I’ve used some of that, but the majority is new and really helpful. Thanks again, I really appreciate it! Its also cool to see that you’re polite to the survivors, I enjoy seeing people not taking games to seriously.
---
I thought it was 14th
---
For purchase??
---
Why lightborn? Flashlights are annoying, but if you are prepared for it, then getting blinded shouldn’t be a bad issue.
---
This, but unironically.
---
Feng Wins. Flawless Victory.  FATALITY.
---
I agree, the blood on his eyes and mouth seem... too bright? I don't really know how to describe it, but it doesn't look natural.
---
We need booty short for Myers!
---
I meant shadowborn, I always confuse the two 😂
---
Amanda's shoulders. -unf- 🍆
---
That’s the blood hunt
---
The only time i save a survivor inside the killers heartbeat is when i have borrowed time and he is camping him. If the killer is around and i dont have borrowed time ill do my best to lure the killer away while someone else gets the save. These survivors did none of these and just kept farming or not even going for saves
---
well it can also be seen as courteous to let the killer smack all of you out too. In this instance it is 4 people waiting at the gate letting the killer smack them out, that's minimum 8 hits which is 2400 brutality and a decent chunk of malicious/chaser emblem, which isn't something to scoff at in terms of points.
---
I don't really use self-care to heal myself to full, I just self-care whenever I can, for instance while the killer is trying to mind-game me at a pallet, and that saves some time if another survivor later heals me.
---
Also it's good for those situations where you get healed at hook and Billy charges you before the heal finishes. Just self-care those last 10% at the next convenient moment.
---
People who self-care 0 to 100 with no medkit while mangled... aren't really credit to team. Unless they need the full health to go for a daring hook rescue.
---
Well done, my child
---
Tunnel and killing them is the solution. You should literally know where *they* are just like they know where you are
---
Time to P3 Tapp now
---
I don't think so. There tends to be some way to look for invisible killers, freddy moves grass even when not sleeping, pretty sure spirit does the same.
---
Also if spirit has prayer beads and it's quiet, you can hear her walking when phasing
---
A cube is a patch that is focused on a certain aspect of the game. The most recent cube was Hag cube, a patch that brought a lot of changes for The Hag ( changes for her base kit and for her add-ons ). There were also cubes for Doctor and Wraith tho. I am surprised you didn't heard anything about these cubes.
---
Killer Insict is in fact the Red Thing Legion has. I tried to tell people to wait until they buffed him /shurg
---
Oh absolutely, im just responding to the first comment saying '45 seconds exposed for stalking someone for 1.5 seconds' isn't accurate
---
Remember, Pig's crouch *always* removes her terror radius and she can ambush from it.
---
https://i.imgur.com/CvijHvd.jpg
---
This is the part I realize I’m on weird side of reddit
---
Mad grit
---
All of these situations are still better with a medkit though.  You could essentially still play it that way and have an extra perk ^*cough*^^adrenaline
---
Enduring, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, and probably Whispers. Or fuck it, Brutal Strength.
---
Exactly besides that it looks great.
---
Remember Laurie Strode? [This is what she looks like now.](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/79/590x/secondary/Jamie-Lee-Curtis-pictures-latest-news-1804133.jpg?r=1553884273691) Confirmed new cosmetic.
---
Yup. They gave him reasonable fixes thankfully and nothing like the shitty suggestions posted on this sub
---
You try to camp me on this, the day of my daughter's wedding?
---
I cam agree with spar on this one.  The grunts are what I use to find survivors who I lost track of as the scratch Mark's are not always reliable.
---
I guess with four of them you could theoretically complete an entire gen in seconds but... then you are all down an addon and you have a shitty toolbox + 4 gens left.
---
*This comment was written by the Commodious Toolbox Gang*
---
Uhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
I always assume there's a Claudette in every locker.
---
Sometimes I'm wrong and it turns out to be a Dwight.
---
You don't know Ghostface like that. Maybe he likes dick...
---
Is the pattern on her apron the plague’s addons?
---
There's a common trick I use which is to bury my red stain in the wall next to the pallet. I delay my lunge and it usually lets me trade a stun for a hit.
---
End screen has Feng sitting on a throne made from the Entity's tentacles.
---
These are some really cool ideas, not only for gameplay but I could imagine what some maps would be like with them as well! I still think there would be some needed tweaks but these just concepts after all. Overall though they seem really well thought out and creative.
---
Sorry for any misspelling im writing on a phone
---
Honestly every day people post here many of they thougts about changes in the game, most of them without meaning or that would unbalance the game, but this... Sounds very good and makes sense with the horror theme of the game. It would add a bit of variety, I'm sure those stealthy killers would be played a little more if it worked that way, because it would be a less frustrating experience for those mid-tier killers
---
It's a good start but just that.. a good start. 
---
There was nothing in the notes about removing the ability for downed and hooked survivors to remove his stealth power, nor anything about Object of Obsession removing his stealth power. These issues are massive and must be addressed. Perks should help you counter a killer's power somewhat, not remove that killer's power all together. And downed/hooked survivors should be helpless to all killers' powers and *never* in a position of strength.
---
And none of his weak ass perks were addressed either. That also requires serious attention.
---
I mean at least they’re listening and making changes before he released? Remember how long it took them for Legion.
---
Oh! That makes more sense, but FOV perks don’t stack.
---
If I have a medkit then how am I going to be a toxic shit with my flashlight?
---
Also it's very bold of you to assume I don't also run Adrenaline. :\^)
---
Also also I don't really bring flashlights even. I just run Adrenaline - Self-care - Ace in the hole - Plunderer's Instinct.
---
I'm so fucking good at this game.
---
Would the shrines be like the fountains or more like the jigsaw boxes? So could a cursed survivor just keep attempting at the same shrine or would they have to go to another shrine if they fail? I like the power and perks. As someone who plays both sides I love them as a killer but would hate them as a survivor.
---
I hope they will have the rights.
---
I hope she's also going to be a fun character to play as.
---
but if they are in SWF, everyone knows where you are while you know where only one of them is. it's also not that you can simply kill them. they can even still people where you are when they are hanging
---
Straight up anti-loop lol
---
The wraith is exceptional at getting the first hit, as with most stealth killers. Spirit can reliably get downs, but without prayer beads, her vacuum noises prevent you from ever ambushing someone and getting that free hit (Unless they're rank 20). Her power has the most application in a chase, whereas wraith uses his constant speed boost + invisibility to traverse the map quickly and surprise unsuspecting survivors.
---
They need to make aura reading perks like object of obsession not work on him while he is in his shroud.
---
Nah, I'm sick and high on prescription cough medicine and a low grade fever. You're still sane, it is I who has gone off the deep end here.
---
huntress humming intensifies
---
Do u happen to have the name and description for each piece?
---
AS cool as this sounds I dont like making perks useless against certain killers... Beside, if I play someone and they have OoO I just kill them fast...
---
But my logic applies specifically to the Nurse's situation. There are 50+ dead bodies that have clearly been murdered by the strangulation marks on their necks. It makes sense for the entity to choose whoever committed the murders. The only way I could see the Nurse not being the murderer is if she became enraged by what happened, in a similar vein to the Spirit's lore. Problem with that is that we know she hated her job and that she wouldn't be angry at her patients being murdered.
---
Also I never said that Wraith is innocent, but I will say he's far more innocent than the Nurse because the only person he intentionally killed was another killer. The difference between Wraith and Azarov is that Wraith was enraged about having killed people unknowingly, while Azarov did it for money because that's what his business was for. This is likely why Wraith was chosen to be the Entity's servant and not his boss.
---
And you're right that you don't necessarily have to be a killer or guilty of some horrible thing to become one of the Entity's killers. Seems like you have have to be surrounded by death of others and being angry makes you more likely to be chosen. However it's pretty clear that Nurse was chosen because she killed 50+ people.
---
Might want to rub out that hate boner before posting again...
---
I can put them here if you'd like, sure!
---
I think they will, they're adding an in game friend system rather than just going through steam or xbox/ps4 and that usually means a gateway to cross platform
---
even tho you shouldn't just chase as him, typical chase build will be a decent default build to go with
---
I'd try out: 
---
M&amp;A because low TR is fun
---
Enduring + Spirit Fury to get people faster
---
BBQ for points
---
This is what I did mean. It is a question in regards to: Can we continue stalking while they look at us, esp with the buffer in place now? Because if you can, that could mean some cool things. Biggest drawback would be how fast your power regenerates
---
Oh I’m not judging, I too am a huge fan of dick
---
Thank you!
---
Dude I contradicted nothing.  Having an exception is logical not a contradiction lol.  Naturally if the whole team swarms the hook before you even have a chance to leave that's on them.  You trying to frame this as an absolute thing as your argument is simply nonsensical and lazy.
---
I know I was so worried when they showed gameplay in the live stream and it looked horrible. (Maybe it was mobile) But the live play I had seen was great looking and way more detailed than I was expecting. Though seriously the person playing had me yelling at the screen. Like how hard is it to hit a skill check
---
You cannot balance the entirety of this game based on 4-man SWFs That will absolutely ruin it for a majority of players
---
That’s fine, I don’t really care too much about the FOV in Monitor, it’s for reducing his terror radius
---
I think survivors should also get a pip - both if the killer dc's or their teammate dc's...
---
DC's screw everyone left - not just one side.
---
I don't think OoO was supposed to remove night shroud regardless of position, I think that was a part of the glitch that they fixed. But until tomorrow, we don't know.
---
&gt;We are currently reviewing it internally to determine what is the best way to go about [the new pallet stun VFX].
---
Here's an easy fix: Remove it. We've had the game for 3 years without it and it's already literally impossible to not tell if you've been stunned. It is completely extraneous and unnecessary.
---
Huehuehue bloody party streamers galore... wait. Oh god oh fuck!!
---
Will it have cross progression? Don't wanna start over tbh
---
Barbecue and Chilli, Hex:Ruin, Enduring and Spirit Fury, the regular M1 build boyyys.
---
Maybe Surveillance could work instead of BBQ, Surveillance is pretty good on stealth killers, so it might be good for Ghost Face too.
---
I hope that nonsense was just a bug too. I'll test it tomorrow as well.
---
Ghost face will most certainly be one of my mains, but he lacks the map presence of billy that puts chainsaw boy in A tier. Regardless, he should be a fun killer.
---
WHY CANT THEY JUST REWORK LEFT BEHIND THE PERK FROM BILL? IT STILL DOES NOTHING AND NOW 100% DOES NOTHING WITH END GAME MECHANICS.
---
The changes are insanely good and actually viable.   
---
Well done BHVR, you did really good with ghostface
---
40 seconds of being tunneled *really* hard. At least Myers can change targets on a whim without losing the advantage of his power.
---
there is one. give more info to solo players first, then try to balance around everyone.
---
Wet Tactical Knife - Even with the blade drenched in blood, the guard keeps the handle dry.
---
Sodden Shroud - The long jacket helps to keep the rest of the clothes dry as blood splashes with each stab of the knife. 
---
Bloody GhostFace - Just a simple plastic mask, though its expression seems different when blood-splattered.
---
you’re still destined to die lmao
---
18
---
Someone understands
---
I would legitimately take this over the low-effort *when the x do the y FREDDY SAY DARN* garbage that presently congests the front page.
---
thank god these changes are finally gonna make him viable
---
I like the changes, it makes him viable (it sounds like, at least).   
---
Well done BHVR
---
That sheet is for all survivors, SFW or not. The SFW datasheet is [this one](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/771/II0BH5BS6HP0.jpg), though do note that this is the average across all ranks on all platforms. As for console survival rates I can't really comment since I do not play on console myself.
---
I like Huntresses tantrum. I also love that shes a motherly figure and the female legion also has a long drawn out stun. "AUGHREREUEURERUURE" and her child goes "AUGH AUG AU AUGHH"
---
we need booty short for the entity
---
You just saved me a lot of grinding. He's some gold!
---
Thats a big boy
---
But he still doesn't have immunity against detection perks. RIP Ghost Face against Object of Obsession and Spine Chill. Everybody will use these perks in the PTB.
---
if you want something more interesting,
---
Discordance to get some info about survivor's location
---
Whispers to know when to activate your TR reduction
---
M&amp;A still looks great on him
---
Devour Hope/Haunted Ground for fun instadowns out of stealth without needing to stalk
---
what i find weird is that it took so much time to have an outfit for Jane and it's not even sexy !
---
I'm agreeing with you, dude.
---
40 seconds of being absolutely tunneled seems like a long time to me. We'll see how it goes in the PTB.
---
Well shoot. I just wanted to see the P3 as well, and maybe get a few points... But heck, I didn't expect that! You're most welcome! :D
---
They are not useless. They will still work if killers have their terror radius back (uncloaked wraith, standing pig, normal ghostface, etc.).
---
yeah 20 seconds was enough and completely fair for like 4 seconds of stalking?
---
Part of the build that was there had Ghostface with all new cosmetics for pig. Plus learned about an update of PTB coming tomorrow.
---
It's more a convenience than anything. You can easily get by without it, as I've come to learn from running meme builds (shoutout to Deliverance), but it is handy to have.
---
But that's all it is: Handy. Convenient.
---
You will learn respect.
---
I think the Entity also pushed the Nurse into killing all those people. From what I've read in the Lore the Entity sees people who have potential to kill and influences them into killing. Like with the Spirit, her father was originally chosen by the Entity who drove him to madness. But, when the Entity felt Rin's rage and lust for revenge it decided to choose her instead as she had more potential.
---
Edit: Unlike the Spirit or Plague, the Nurse did kill people before being taken by the Entity. However, she was pushed towards insanity by the Entity and if the Entity didn't exist this most likely never would have happened.
---
Just because someone has white skin doesn't mean they're caucasian .w.
---
damn straight we are, and its time to pick your side, this is war
---
Then let’s hope the devs take notice and deal with those next, this is a step forward though
---
As long as solo players are on equal footing, then sure the game would be a lot easier to balance. Unfortunately, I don't see this happening any time soon :/
---
I KNOW SEE WHY BABY SURVIVORS CANT RANK UP! STOP HEALING AND GET ME OFF THE HOOK BEFORE I GO INTO PHASE 2. STOP WASTING PALLETS AFTER YOU GET HIT. STOP WORRYING ABOUT THE HEARTBEAT ALLL THE TIME. AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP LEAVING RIGHT AWAY PLEASE! I CHASED THE KILLER AROUND FOR 5 GENS AND GET HOOKED DUE TO NOED? STOP SITTING THERE AT THE GATE AND FIND THE TOTEM!!!
---
Rofl nice
---
45 seconds from 20
---
Maybe a bit much or is it ok?
---
I use pizza cutters. Like a normal fucking human
---
Holy shit, what’s happening? I’m actually *excited* to play ghost face now, weird
---
Wasn't wraith after hag?
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Having a pair of scissors (just regular, theres pizza scissors and they are amazing but don't see much use when you can just use regular ones) in the kitchen is very useful, alone for cutting paper or the like
---
You
---
Waaaazzzzzaaaaappp
---
you have chosen... poorly
---
It's a term that the devs use for a big rework/change to a killer, but I don't think they've called anything a cube for a while. I think the last "Cube" was hag.
---
yes pls
---
They made the stalk no longer regress?! Now he can just 99% stalk you.
---
Kinda dumb
---
sometimes, it just doesn't cut it
---
Did I say she was Caucasian? lmfao
---
I know people like to give crap to the dbd devs, but man.. I really love Mathieu.  I wish i knew him irl!  Such a fun guy xD *fingerguns*
---
Anything
---
Yeah people are overlooking how big his stalk meter not decaying is. It means even if you get spotted before the full exposed effect you can either chase and grab the last bit of stalk during, or disengage and next time you find that survivor you can expose them far more quickly.
---
Off topic. Can we talk about Ghostfaces buff in ptb? That shit sound good af
---
Did you straight up go through my reply history for this?
---
Holy crap, you're perfectly matching the "Reddit SJW" stereotype now. I've seen memes of this but never until now.
---
"Toxic" Prove it.
---
"Unreasonable" How? It's not hard to take a guess as to why people disagreeing with you. And if the guess is wrong... well, they should have commented instead of simply downvoting and moving on.
---
Also... my god. LGBT flag Trapper icon on this subreddit. People just can't stay apolitical, huh?
---
EDIT: Oh man. Stating the truth is "toxic" now.
---
You probably support this right here, huh? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgQy70_LPS4
---
That will definitely help with sneaking up on survivors. Probably need to add surveillance or discordance to help combat that gen rush tho
---
The Plague's story is fucked up if you think about the fact that her faith did nothing to heal those people and when she was taken by the Entity she was given the power to heal with her fountains but only to be forced into killing innocent people.
---
Perks:
---
A Bloody Accident:
---
If you do an action that would normally change the status icon will have a 10/15/20 second delay the change the status icon. Will also work on a finished gen or a survivor being hooked.
---
(Can be used to make solo survivors confused on their progress)
---
Search And Destroy:
---
While in a chase, if you look at the survivor directly for less than one second you can see the survivor’s aura for 3/4/5 seconds with a cool down of 30 seconds
---
(Good to know how to out smart the survivor in a loop)
---
S.L.O.W:
---
You gain tokens for hooking each survivor once. Each token gives you 2% faster movement speed out of chase. With a max of 2/3/4 tokens.
---
(Helps get around the map faster without making survivors helpless in a chase)
---
Nurse with even three blinks is insane. The second blink is effectively there to close the gap or to take a second chance, which is entirely fair because you can't guarantee you'll blink right on top of people the first time... When you add more second chances, though, it becomes an issue extremely quickly.
---
I was thinking about Thrilling Tremors on Prayer Beads Spirit. IMO There are better perks for Nurse and Billy, but for Spirit, it might work.
---
He can only stalk and expose one person at a time. It's nowhere near Myers' who can chaindown a bunch of people.
---
Sounds like you all need to just get back on fortnite
---
We'll see how it plays out though - these are a lot of buffs, gotta make sure everything works at first as he now basically is completely revamped, and when he got on the PTB first, there was loads of unintended stuff
---
I will never forget the one game I played against a 5-blink tunneling Nurse. I was out of the game in just over a minute and there was genuinely no escape. Literally the least fun I've ever had in this game, and I'm the type that already gets salty easily, so at least to me that really says something.
---
I'm actually somewhat concerned that this is going to make him unfun/oppressive to play against, and is something that might get Ghostface nerfed in other areas. Because in a way it'd be like a 99% Myers, but instead of being forced to take advantage of the 60s you have, you can just keep on doing it every single chase. If he'll be able to pull this off consistently, I hope they revert this change so that his stalk once again decays rather than destroy him with unnecessary nerfs in other areas.
---
In the ptb and at the release of ghostface, sure. But give it time and people will eventually stop doing builds to just counter GF.
---
they were talking about building kindred or bond into survivor's base kit, but it's been a long time ago. I wish they added them, but that'd mean the perks would have to reworked. (they could make is so the build-in kindred doesn't show the killer and rework kindred to do that better, no idea about bond tho. you can't make bond just increase the range of the built-in bond, cuz there's Open Handed for that)
---
So SWF is more important than killers? That's quite a selfish mentality.
---
Oh baby a triple!
---
I have no idea the testing that happens before PTB. But the PTB *is* a place to test new features, and make adjustments.
---
Might want to get a better roast before posting again
---
Remember how fast it took them to listen to survivors and nerf Freddy?
---
Genuine question. Why not?
---
True, I was mostly thinking of putting it on those two because they can cover so much ground in such a short span of time, Spirit can do that as well of course but not to the same extent
---
All to well!! Happens to me way to often
---
\&gt;spirit
---
\&gt;fun to play against
---
i dunno chief ill take a nurse over a spirit any day, shit sucks.
---
That data was corrected by Peanits within hours of its release. The rank 1 statistics were only considering post game rank 1 players. (So anyone who pipped and was already rank 1) Pipping for survivors is basically surviving.
---
He stated that the overall survival rate actually went down at rank one, not up.
---
&gt;This one is a little bit of an oversight. The game takes your rank from after the match, not the start. In addition, these stats were collected from April 1st to April 7th. This was when it was significantly harder for survivors to pip. So what ended up happening was that most of the survivors that died would derank and count as a rank 2 death, whereas those who survived would remain at rank 1 and count as an escape. It was very rare to die at rank 1 and not derank at that time.  
---
&gt;**In short, it's actually much closer to 43% if you took the starts from a week later.**
---
tree
---
I have completely grinding as well! I should have at least 1,270,000 bp to spend when her comes to out (that includes saved daily rituals and shrine). I am pumped!
---
And yeah, I agree that this mask is so much better. The old one looked like someone flicked red paint once on it and called it a day. It looked hella disappointing. 
---
I’m glad to say that now he looks fucking great.
---
Same here it’s usually just a daily thing but this one stood out to me lol
---
Considering the fact that survivors who reveal him are shown, that would be a dangerous tactic.
---
BUT I SHOULDN'T BE THE FIRST SURVIVOR THE KILLER FINDS!
---
JUST GO CHASE SOMEONE ELSE AND I'LL STAY IN THE GAME 4HEAD
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests
---
4-man SWFs were less than 10% of games played, while *over* 50% of players were solo. So no: balancing the game in a way because you can't stand those 5~7% of players is *selfish*.
---
Sadly Thrilling got neutered with its cooldown. A 60-second cool-down will effectively mean that most of the time you will be using the perk every second hook. 
---
FC ability to change the obsession is interesting but with the current perk roster, it doesn't really help much in my opinion.
---
STBFL+ FC prolongs the obsessions life which actually works well. That combined with the ability to potentially find another survivor mid-chase can allow you to quickly switch targets mid-chase for bonus tokens.
---
Dying Light + FC is a horrible combination. Prolongs the obsessions life.
---
Rancor + FC will scare survivors from saving the obsession if they are on the hook incase they become the obsession. Could actually be very useful if you want to target a specific player, perhaps a talented one to allow you to focus on the other survivors.
---
PWYF + FC might work. Changing the obsession around increases the chances of you meeting the obsession. PWYF still a bad perk though.
---
Dark Devotion + FC would work I suppose. Changing the survivor's obsessions can confuse them as they may not expect you to use Dark Devotion. 
---
Remember me + FC kind of clash. FC prolongs the obsessions life meaning that killing the obsession would be significantly more difficult.
---
Furtive chase might work well on Leatherface. Getting close to another survivor mid-chase might benefit him if he catches them out of position. Same with Hillbilly. 
---
Myers will literally have 0 TR while in chase which will be strange. Very scary with Tier 3 and having only a 16 meter TR. 
---
I need to try it.
---
Time to re-download the PTB
---
"Hrrhurrhrrrhhhr?"
---
"Yes Leatherface, you did it TOO fast."
---
"Hrrrhurrhrrrhrr."
---
"Well it's not my fault you don't know how to M1."
---
Yea. They'd need to add a whole bunch of auras for survivors and possibly even voice chat to match SWFs
---
&gt;because you can't stand those 5\~7% of players
---
It... it isn't about not being able to "stand" those players. It's about how SWF, especially 4-mans, break the game. And it's not just about 4-mans (since you're the one who brought up that number for some reason...); it's about *all* SWF. So yeah, not caring about changing/balancing that is *selfish*. It's basically saying that survivors and their fun are worth more than the killer's fun/the game's balance.
---
Will they ever change the port from the Xbox?.every time i log on the ps4 with the mouse and keyboard at the settings shows Xbox one controlls but this is not the best part... i can’t use my mouse. When i do a gen it shows me press M1 for skillcheck but there is no M1 because The mouse input it’s fucking blocked
---
Double range addons turns nurse into a god. I’m only a pretty average nurse, but with double range, I can literally not lose with my absolute insane nap pressure and survivors can’t make any distance on me at all even if I miss one or two blinks
---
I wouldn't want to see that changed though, cause in the live version I don't like seeing some perks made irrelevant in a match just cause your facing a certain killer.
---
I mean I’ve got scissors in my kitchen, yeah, but I would’ve literally never thought to use them on pizza. Sounds fuckin wild
---
Skip to 9:52 for a **scrumptious hit box**
---
###
---
The real question is, can Ghostface stalk through tall grass and corn?
---
Thank you, yes. Self care and urban evasion = horrible teammate. Even if I loop for 3-4 gens it won’t be enough while they hide.
---
Yep. I am not saying if it is too strong or not, but it definitely is one of his most important changes right now. Depending on how he looks tomorrow on the ptb update, and later on live, it might be important to look at how oppressive he is, and if it is too much, disable stalking while survivors look at him (which would still give Ghostface a advantage, since the survivor needs to look more then 1.5 seconds at GF just so he can't activate his stalk.)
---
True, but swf will make his job much harder (like all killers but his much more so).
---
Hopefully they can address this other than showing to you who revealed you since then you become a shitty version of a tracking killer.
---
I am baffled that they did not make him immune to perk detection during his Shroud. 
---
Considering his whole power is based around stealth, you would think that this would be a staple. Hell, even Freddy is immune to aura readings and he isn't much of a stealth killer.

We'll have to see how easy it is to break stalk. I'm thinking against average players you should get exposed about 1/3 of the attempts you try. Any more than that and I think it may feel unfun or unfair.
---
WHY DOES MICHAEL ALWAYS HAVE TO BE ON MY ASS WHEN THE OTHER THREE SURVIVORS ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP?!
---
This works for me.
---
who the fuck wants leatherfaces chainsaw to charge like hillbilly's. all I want is increased speed and 100% movement while revving.
---
Please no. If my experience with post game chat says anything, I'd rather not be screamed at by my teammates.
---
Are prequel memes ever really unexpected?
---
You guys are just salty she started the charged hit animation before you were even at the edge of the pallet.
---
Fortunately this also applies to lots of other places - various parts of Russia, Canada, Europe/UK, Australia, certain Eastern areas.
---
Gonna keep it real with you, 18 is not the standard age of consent in so many countries, and even those where it is usually has caveats.
---
I believe some areas in China don't allow anyone over 18 to couple with someone under 18, but two people under 18 is fine, and they don't even have to be teenagers as long as they're within two years.
---
Depending on how the changes to revealing him work in practice, he seems pretty solid on paper.
---
Aren’t there some killers who already do that though? Perhaps they could lessen the effectiveness of perks like OoO or Spine Chill against GF, instead of making him impervious to them or something?
---
Photo taken moments before disaster
---
Because the Switch will be the only port with a stable frame rate.
---
Hillbilly can fake his instadown to get the survivor to run ahead making them vulnerable to a hit or use his curve to get an instadown in loops if he is skilled enough and is either running speed ad don or catches the survivor off guard.
---
Weeks? Didn’t he go live on PTB like a week ago? That’s the point of a beta - it helps developers realize when their vision is incorrect. They saw the feedback and responded to it. This anger is misguided.
---
Lessen sounds good to me, would be nice to see the stealth have an effect at least, just not a complete counter. And there is, Freddy, tier 1 Myers and I think wraith are, which is why I'm concerned.
---
I mean, this isn’t any different from a lot of other killers though. The only killers that don’t have to worry about this are Myers, Billy, and Bubba.
---
The Confederate. Sure that works.
---
... He'd totally have racist perks tho.
---
teammates with urban evasion
---
Can only recommend, they saved my sanity more than once now
---
Geez at least they fixed him. You looking for something to be mad about?
---
I know I said object of obsession but now that I think of it spine chill is also amazing. Honestly I'm surprised not a lot of people use that perk considering it's great against the pig, wraith, nurse, hillbilly, spirit, and now ghostface.
---
Surveillance, Enduring, Discordance &amp; Ruin.
---
His power will work well for stalking survivors doing gens. This build kind of capitalises on that.
---
Surveillance allows you to find targets to stalk. Will probably be a staple for him considering that is when survivors are most exposed. 
---
Discordance is amazing for finding groups of survivors and since he can stalk each survivor simultaneously, he can double mark them. 
---
Ruin to reduce survivor situational awareness as more effort is in skill checks and slows down the game.
---
Enduring to speed up the game and burn pallets down faster. 45 Seconds to down a survivor means you need to take advantage of them throwing down lots of pallets to avoid you and also allows you to not waste time being stunned.
---
Legal in *most* places in *most* first-world countries, it's only illegal in about 20% of the US for example.
---
The last time I've gotten a BNP was from the winter mystery boxes, just haven't seen them in ages.
---
Can you shed some light on that perks description plz
---
Yeah, but no killer can be stopped just by looking at them (not including flashlights.) So swf can coordinate against that.
---
Also I feel like bubba is really weak against swf, since they can say not to grab them of the hook since bubba is nearby.
---
I love Farmer John so much. Also, Vooshy, RyyFii, and ScottJund. 
---
No0b3 is fun, but his audience and their troll messages that you have to listen to the whole time when they make a donation make it not watchable at times.
---
I would say the survivors pick 1 perk that cannot be banned, and the killers pick two. For example Adrenaline, Enduring, Spirit Fury. Then the killer can ban X perks and the Survivors can ban Y killer perks. I would say about 4 banned survivor perks and 2 banned killer perks.
---
Another twist is the survivors cannot use more than two of the same exact perk, except for the picked perk.
---
There should be many smaller rules for example, I don’t really know if I want exhaustion (non head on and adrenaline)perks to be banned because that perk is usually a huge part of a players play-style so what would happen is people would look at the players favorite exhaustion perk and ban it. I was also thinking of making BT to be made unbannable because I expect quite a bit of camping, but since DS is also an option what could happen is if the killer bans both save options and camps, the survivors will have more deadly weapons to use during the match as they are not banned (so I don’t know what to do). Also imo the survivors don’t have many good mid tier perks so maybe they should have less banned perks but the killer has many mid to high tier perks to use. There are many other mini rules that could be decided upon as they come. I was also thinking about implementing a killer pick and ban system to encourage the use of more un used killers. Also the ranking would be from Billy to Billy and Clown to Clown instead of overall. Also each killer should have banned addons and addons combinations. And barely any Nurse addons she is good enough, same for survivor items. Also no offerings (except for maybe chests i would love to see some looting builds :D ) Also all survivor skins must be default skins (to prevent all 4 survivors picking blendettes) and only two of the same survivor and they must be easily told  part by their shirt and pants.
---
This is just my ideas and are rough (and not perfect at all)
---
As a.. I dunno, mothafuckin' Meyers goes "BOO" I legit jump.
---
Huntresses Bear head and tartan fur coat, not ridiculous so much as just 👌 choice
---
I agree. I imagine a common strategy will be to go around getting 99% on everyone, and then being able to insta-down everyone with no warning.
---
We'll have to see how it plays out, but zero decay might be a bit too much. Not to mention 45 seconds of exposed *per survivor* is long time, considering 60 seconds of EW3 on Myers takes much longer to trigger and can only be gotten a limited amount of times per match.
---
I don’t think that should make them excluded, they should make Xbox and ps4 better then.
---
I also forgot they only are releasing a handful of killers and survivors at launch so the others won’t be playable.
---
How does she down people if they don't cleanse? Solely from M1'ing, correct?
---
Okay, so. M1 killer. To address your wording, no. On the contrary, forcing the narrative of her "basically having a permanent NOED" is what's disingenuous: You can get a full heal at any point quicker than a fellow survivor can even heal you by just going to a fountain.
---
My point still stands: Plague Broken status isn't enough incentive to cleanse. The game should be more about survivors trying to tactfully cleanse themselves at fountains that are far off from objectives rather than just opting to not cleanse at all (Which is currently the most viable strategy).
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
This used to happen to me, I needed to buy a convert to a new service provider to fix it
---
The perk is called Left Behind.
---
If you are the last survivor in the game, you repair gens 75% faster for every gen needed to open the exit gate.
---
This is pointless though because the hatch opens if you are the last survivor in the game. Even then if the hatch is closed the exit gates will be powered meaning gens are blocked off.
---
If you do complete a gen, it serves no purpose other than exposing your position to the killer.
---
I heard he cannot, but Survivors can spot him through it
---
More like ‘Belongs in the Trash’
---
Sometimes it happens to me when I play killer, it’s pretty BS, I just let the survivor go after it happens.
---
The quote:
---
&gt; “The off-screen detection indicator is now visible for the entire duration of the reveal phase”
---
Does specifically mention 'for the entire duration of the reveal phase' 
---
The reveal phase is only happening when a survivor is in the process of spotting ghostface. So there really wouldn't be much point in the survivor that's already spotting ghost face getting an indicator. It's definitely referring to the white semicircular indicator that ghostface sees as a survivor out of his line of sight spots him.
---
I don't think so...
---
\^ This.
---
THE MATCHMAKING ON XBOX HAS BEEN HORRIBLE SINCE THE DBD WAS ADDED TO GAME PASS. TOOK SURVIVORS ALL OF ONE DAY TO FIGURE OUT THEY COULD USE LFG TO GAME THE SYSTEM. ALMOST ALL OF MY KILLER GAMES HAVE FEATURED ONE PERSON IN YELLOW OR TAN RANKS, MAYBE ONE PERSON IN GREEN RANKS, ONE OR TWO PEOPLE IN PURPLE RANKS, AND ALMOST ALWAYS ONE PERSON IN RED RANKS. I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE WANT TO PLAY WITH THEIR FRIENDS BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
---
Nuuu they had one job, that was the one change I really hoped they added.
---
Lol
---
What was your build?
---
No Meme Thursday probably had the least amount of people active on the sub. It would make more sense to make a non meme sub than alienate the larger portion of the sub
---
Now if we could just get them to change his name from The Ghost *Face* to just The Ghost
---
Lmao never thought of that
---
Well, at least i will have a reason to facecamp those who dare take OoO against my ghosty boi.
---
I was really expecting all of them to DC on you.
---
I'd really really love this.  Also, cross platform character progression please... I'd love this on Switch but don't want to completely restart my PS4 progress.
---
any Claudettes get the exposed status ):
---
You know this is two different departments. One had nothing to do with the other. Still though, the department that's responsible for taking care of this needs to get on it for real.
---
Edit: spelling
---
Can't get bad perks if you bought them all in previous bloodwebs :\^)

Which Halloween is this?

Hmm, a couple of them look like the emetic addons
---
halloween resurrection
---
Which is why I mainly focused on the rank 2 survival rate since that one isn't as deceptive as the rank 1 rate. Rank 2 still has a 60% survival rate which means that one average the killer will get less than 2 kills per game. I so far have not seen any statistics that would support your claim of 43% survival rate, so if they have posted that you'll have to link it. The only other survival statistics I can remember is the one they posted after the Hallowed Blight event that showed a 60% survival rate at rank 1, although I unfortunately can't seem to find that post by BHVR.

That's true. I was hype about him when I first heard about him then I was sad when I saw what he was
---
Literally same. The most Grind I’ve ever done on a game for my PS4, so idk if I’d get the Switch version if it doesn’t. :\
---
My idea with Remember Me and FC was more focused on the stacks instead of the obsessions lifespan
---
Ok but nurse and spirit can’t bing bong repeatedly
---
I think we can all agree that an outfit for Jane is more important than an useless perk 😂.
---
Spirit fury, enduring, ruin/TrilTrem/Intervention/Noed, surveillance/bittermurmur/bbq
---
Really ? I mean that's your opinion but don't you think a good nurse can completely shut down a match and your urge to play ? I might be biased here since i play both as killer and enjoy Spirit most but as a survivor mostly i like spirit because not all of them predict you easily.
---
Add to that when i successfully dodge the spirit i have a great chance to escape because of her meter that she needs to fill , Nurse on the other hand will reward you with her fatigue duration only.
---
Nurse missing you will be easier to track you down since her prediction can't be so off since her power lets her see while blinking but spirit literally can't see you and might lose you by quite a lot making it hard to initiate a chase again since she moves slowly and can't use her power again .
---
*CAUGH CAUGH* THEY CHANGED GHOSTFACE

Man looking at that makes me feel weird because I'm so used to Green bloody party streamers. Kinda wish we had a common bloody point boost for everyone.

Ghostface would be crying if he got caught
---
The first movie is quite good. If you got time I would recommend it.

The movies afterwards are really weird.

Who?

Like a perk that automatically makes Tapp or Claudette the obsession?

I rather just rework all of her add-ons, 90% of them are crap.

This is all I really wanted of his DLC.  Nothing game changing, just a fun slate of DLC for us Scream fans.
---
When you are in tier 3, your EW progression bar begins to drop for 60 seconds as it slowly drains away until it empties, bringing you back to tier 2. 
---
When you tombstone a survivor, a significant portion of that timer bar is taken away, effectively ending your tier 3 early. 
---
Stalking does not impact your terror radius. All it does is allow you to power up your Evil Within and slows your movement speed.
---
Especially with how much of a grind this game can be. I just want spirit fury on the pig you damn bloodweb!
---
Yeah I wasn't too sure with wraith
---
With gas, and a liiiiiiighter
---
*balanced landing intensifies*
---
Cleanse totems&lt;3 (survivor main, 500h)
---
Pretty much what happens when I see a Wraith/Trapper/Hag main playing against a OoO user 😌.
---
I want a killer that could be considered top tier AND fun.  
---
"SPIRIT!"  
---
Yes, but besides her there is none.  
---
Nurse and Billy are old.  
---
It feels like bhrv are scared to put a GOOD killer out there.
---
Hillbilly is in desperate need of a nerf, even coming from a Killer main (Survivor is not fun for me, so I hardly play it, if ever). Nurse as well. Every single time I play Survivor against a Hillbilly, I want to disconnect as soon as the Trial starts because I know I'm gonna get sac'd if the Killer is good (usually, so it's virtually a guaranteed 4K Trial). I actually play to have a challenge so I usually run with Trapper, Michael, Amanda, or Legion (and I'm just starting to level up Plague). The only time where I won't have any fun as a Killer is with Survivors that run from pallet to pallet hoping to score at least two or three flashlight tricks just to piss me off all while teabagging (which I personally consider griefing, although Survivor mains will never see it that way).
---
My other gripe is how unnecessarily weak Amanda got after the EGC update. I've had Trials where the RBTs never, *ever* activated, which is much too generous for the Survivors to remove at Billy boxes. Behaviour should at least make RBT timers run while Survivors are healthy or injured (I'm fine with the clock stopping while dying or hooked) because turning the timers off inside the TR is too much of a buff for the Survivors. The Jigsaw Chapter is only by theme. If they really wanted to honor the iconic horror franchise, the RBT timers need a massive buff. As they are right now, they're pretty much useless.
---
I love the fences on haddonfield, there’s nothing quite like reaching over one to hit a survivor who is being a little too cocky
---
... most. i'd wager that the most important ones are the browns and the one or two that add extra rbts
---
So in ew3 there is no reason to stalk? Even normally without a tombstone? Why even disable it then?
---
Yup. Only way to counter it
---
We need to make a distinction between proper criticism like this and the dipshits spamming ‘remove Legion’ on every tweet, because spam like that will make the devs less likely to listen to genuine issues.
---
I was ace, I can confirm we all escaped safely.
---
The issue is that once you reach max stacks of Remember me you need to kill the obsession otherwise they will ignore the effect. 
---
Since you have the obsession change every time a survivor unhooks another, the obsession will be very hard to kill as you would need to camp the hook to ensure the obsession actually dies instead of being transferred to another survivor.
---
It's more effective to tunnel the obsession and then kill them using Remember me by its own. It allows you to guarantee the obsession dies while also maximising your stacks. The only downside is if the obsession kills themselves early or DC's but even then you benefit from such a situation.
---
Whoa, man. Take 'er easy.
---
I agree with you entirely. I feel they should've added some of the buffs to see what works and what doesn't but since they added everything at once it will be hard to balance him because they don't know what to remove and what to keep. Also feel like he will be nerfed because he also has some pretty Overpowered add ons  which reduce how far survivors can see you and increase how fast you stalk. I just feel so conflicted with this as I want a good killer but I don't want people to DC or just be miserable after the match as I want everyone to have fun.
---
Spine chill is fine since you don’t know where killer is looking at you from or else the perk would become useless and because it gives a speed increase, but OoO should not see you whatsoever when in NightShroud since Myers and Freddy aren’t affected.
---
You have mere seconds to live.
---
It would have to work on multiple black survs tho, not just one.
---
Something akin to sensing them in darkness. An aura reading if you have crouching within X/Y/Z radius perhaps?
---
People have been complaining that it's way too easy to hide with black survs and dark clothes after all, especially Claudette since she and the other girls are shorter. (RIP Ace) Hey, we all know that BHVR prefers to slap a perk on a problem instead of actually address it anyway.
---
Why BHVR doesn't just give more dark clothing options to everyone that isn't Claudette baffles me...
---
I actually think some of the Rare add-ons for FF need slight buffs. For example, Legion Pin only applies Broken for 60 seconds when, in all honesty, it should apply the status wholesale.
---
I have zero fun in games with Hillbilly or Nurse.
---
I 100% AGREE
---
I would love a grey blood points offering that helps everyone as I believe many people would run it and it would cut down the blood point grind but I don't see it happening as these devs love making us grind (take that out of context if you want).
---
Uhhhh, what? Amanda got nerfed through the floor with the EGC update. She's now effectively a LMB Killer with stealth, since RBTs do almost nothing.
---
I forgot to mention this. It's another major problem with him.
---
It was on forums. I believe if you just search chapter 13 outfits you will find it plus she gets two or you can go to r/Oinkers_ to see them
---
Looks like a Michael with personal EW3s now.
---
Did you find him hiding in a locker?
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/68065/bookmark-cosmetic-reveal-mid-chapter-3-0-0
---
Oh yeah I hate when No0b3s fans start spamming those messages and I wish they’d stop lmao
---
Flashlight tricking (using flashlight while breaking pallets or picking up dying Survivors) pisses me off the most as a Killer, and ruins the fun I want to have. That's just me, though.
---
Google: "dbd mid chapter cosmetics 3.0.0".
---
It's very simple
---
When you hear him breathing and toss your camera around to finally see him just standing there
---
Sweet!  Guess what im watching during my fortnite stw dailies. :3
---
Which is what they've done after the test, its a Player Test Build, you test a character so that the dev can patch things. No internal testing is better than their players.
---
The good thing is they'll still have a little time to make tweaks before his release on Tuesday. Quite frankly, with how bad he was, I think the buffs were justified. I for one am really excited.
---
I mean lets be real here, most myers run m&amp;a so they have an 8 meter terror radius which is basically nothing at tier 2 movement speed. They can also insta-down you and with both stalk addons very common btw it only takes about 6 seconds of stalking once you have reached tier 2 once. To get tier 3, if it works out as the numbers suggest he might be myers tier, if not well eh can't be worse then prefix.
---
That would be very overpowered for a green add on. Maybe 2 minutes.
---
5 minutes later and two of the survivors have DC'd on their first hook, the thirds getting mori'd and the last didnt get to the hatch in time before the killer closed it and let the entity have its fun. 
---
Que the "reees" in end game chat where the survivors accuse the killer of breaking the imaginary rules they just made up.
---
Which is exactly what GF needed.
---
Does that make you randy baby?
---
They also whine about it to the Fog Whisperers and if the streamers end up agreeing, then they tell BE which results in more unfair/unnecessary nerfs to Killers (my speculation says Amanda's RBTs got nerfed because Survivors complained about their use during EGC, and the FWs relayed those complaints to the devs; Amanda isn't even that strong a Killer to begin with).
---
I'm not sure to be honest. I have never seen any use out of stalking survivors in tier 3 either. 
---
It could be to prevent the killer from utilising stalk movement speed add-ons or to remove the aura reading ability associated with stalking a survivor. If the survivor is in view of the stalk then they have an aura shown around them. 
---
It could have also just been to prevent conflicts with the code.
---
most of my hype died when i learned that he will come alone without map nor survivor yet they call it chapter
---
Since it released on like early 2018 (not sure which month it was, maybe February, March?) I was checking the Shrine pretty often, week after week. I was really frustrated after I missed it for the first time. Now it appeared again and I got it after almost 1,5 year. Really excited :D
---
Her pink latter is trash , Amanda's secret is also a nerf and shouldn't be an addon , and increasing skill checks for boxes is such a waste , they need to change her addons
---
Ask him to say “Thrilling Tremors”
---
Yeah but if he is Overpowered survivors will just pull the plug I personally would rather have him be weak on release so people won't complaint and give him the Freddy treatment. But we just have to wait and see. I'm very worried for Ghostfaces place in this game because he can easily be bad or OP. I just don't want him being Freddy 2.0
---
They stack with each other as far as I am aware.
---
Your numbers are definitely off, considering Curtain Call was released a YEAR ago today.
---
It was dumb that his 4.5 seconds of power was wasted if he got spotted. Time is the only resource a killer has.
---
That's right, all perks that give penalty stack, but some in multiplicative form and other in sumative
---
*Smiles in Tuft of Hair*
---
According to the reddit event timeline for dbd the Ghostface release will be on the 18th. 
---
Yeah the release will be on Tuesday
---
They need to make corn consistent. If it can't be stalked through you shouldn't be able to be blinded through it.
---
Here I was thinking this odd format would never be used
---
Cheers!
---
I had Survivors bitch about me "camping" when I spent a good amount of time trying to Mori a jerk who kept flashlight tricking me when I was picking up Survivors. That and I kept running between the last three generators because they were dumb enough to leave those three so close together for me to easily get to them. I ended up with a technical 4K that game as Legion (3K plus a DC).
---
Homo erectus
---
We saw people that were angry in this sub saing things like "why does the devs put a shit killer in the PTB!?", people even memed it to make fun of those people. We got overly defensive people, but also overly angry people, it goes both ways.
---
Nah, they should just buff everyone else to make them viable. This is ment to be a horror game. The scariest thing in this game to a survivor is good nurse. If they can replicate that feeling with others killers they should do it
---
Any survivor with skill could easily run one pallet for 20 seconds with the headstart they got from the exposed notification.
---
*saddest oink*
---
That would be a faster cancel than the current solution.
---
Imagine put out of "stalking" Myers adding even the red glow just by moving the camera 😂
---
These changes should've been done before the ptb, while they were supposedly""testing"" internally (unless those ones get paid to just do nothing). A power that can be canceled by looking at the killer with a camera movement while you're free to move is a stupid concept
---
Put that mechanic into ANY killer and tell me how "solid" becomes afterwards. I did the example with Myers since has a similar ability but you can do the same picking her mother, the pig. Someone sees you and now you have terror radius and red glow alerting the one you wanted to surprise. Great idea!...
---
Look at hillbilly and you cancel his chainsaw, look at nurse you cancel her charge, look at anyone and cancel it's power. Plus they didn't say anything about hooked survivors been able to see you. Don't even try to say "it's obvious it won't" after weeks saying that camera mechanic WAS A BUG and obviously wasn't but people still convinced it was...
---
At least after Freddy rework I know who'll take his place in "OhDarn" tier. They did such a nice job with the plague, she just needed few tweaks and she's fine now. They were doing a pretty good job making killers and now a licensed killer with no power.. not even with an original idea (Myers + pig + be able to pick WOW).. the model of ghostface make it impossible to stalk since you see his model before he can see you due to the 1st and 3rd person camera difference. Unless you have to look at HIS MASK not his body which is super easy
---
I knew it they couldn't do much having so little time. I even stated this before "would be just a number changes"  and that's what we got. Disappointed, really, I was looking forward to this killer but since it hit the ptb I had this presentiment. Maybe in few months they will fix him like they did to legion, now it's not worth it.
---
The things they should do to at least be playable is
---
- take off the hooked ones be able to cancel his power
---
- survivors has to see the mask not the tiny pinky around the rock when he can't even see you
---
- improve how far he can pick out from walls/angles since it's way too short to be a mechanic worth using
---
These are the lazy fixes I would do, I thought it for 10s, and I'm not paid unlike someone to at least put these changes into ptb
---
Relax man, we don’t need another Freddy tier killer. Nor do we want another novelty killer that is stuck at mid tier. Ask yourself this. Even with the changes *being as strong as you think they are*, will he pass Nurse in power?
---
The answer is no. And not just no, HELL no. You want variety in games or do you want to continue to see Billy and Nurse only?
---
My PC fears that more than anything
---
Perhaps with the whole new map plan with more unsafe pallets, all other killers will receive a buff. Being able to mind-game more pallets will certainly make lower tier killers a lot stronger.
---
Still better than syringes and MoM
---
They already mentioned that your character will start to face where your camera is facing now no matter what. It was on the PTB I believe. I remember because I turned my camera to face left while on a gen and Jake turned his head left.
---
Healing lol
---
So that’s the soonest the game will be updated at all? I was kinda hoping to be able to play before the release so I could get some BP for Ghostface. Thanks for the info 🙏
---
They changed it from “The Ghost” because we already have 2 killers (The Spirit and The Wraith) that all translate to the same word. Tell me if I worded it confusingly because I suck at English lol
---
Since it released on like early-mid 2018 (not sure which month it was, maybe February, March?) I was checking the Shrine pretty often, week after week. I was really frustrated after I missed it when it appeared for the very first time. Now it appeared again and I got it after almost 1 year. Really excited :D
---
Someone who corrected me it is a year not 1,5. Thanks! Forgot to take the username for credit sadly and I can't restore the thread to check it, but you know who you are!
---
it really wouldn't, instead of having your camera pointed somewhere and woops there goes his power u have to actively do something. Which means &gt; let go of the gen (if you're on one) and turn around, face the killer and point. the pointing animation itself takes about a second if it isn't 1.5 seconds.
---
These are the lazy fixes I would do, I thought it for 10s, and I'm not paid unlike someone to at least put these changes into ptb. if even an idiot like me can see the problems and come up with these solutions in seconds (lazy ones I would add) I wonder if it's really being tested internally
---
Are you talking about me? Cuz my flair doesnt check out. Also, I just think in my personal opinion wraith is a piece of bullshit. Not the killer itself, but the people who play him. I kind of understand why they do this, but his power doesnt help him in chase, so they have to run NOED or some shit like that and camp. That's all wraith's good at. Using NOED and camping. His power isnt the most fun to play, and he's just BS to play against. But that's just my opinion
---
Will you still be able to detect him while on the hook/downed? I don't see that mentioned anywhere in the notes...
---
Whispers isn't that good on her now , because they changed her terror radius from 24m to 32m so now if you play against her and you hear a slight heartbeat and it disappears you know she just crouched although i can see that being difficult to hear during actual gameplay.
---
Let's not go that far. Mid tier at best.
---
Yeah I’m not why they ever made noises for when night shroud was active in the first place... they didn’t do that for Myers so why do it for Ghost?
---
Do you play on console? Nurse kind of sucks on console because it's hard for people to aim precisely and quickly enough.
---
WHY AM I ALWAYS THE FIRST ONE FOUND IN EVERY MATCH WTF
---
very true , two different departments. I get it . But something this large really is an eyesore. :)
---
No I understand and that's a great point
---
Why Noed on Huntress?
---
Double BP event 14th to 18th according to the reddit timeline as well so you should be able to accumulate some bp before GF release.

Awww they're so cuuuutteee. I'm buying them both lol
---
Why not just level up Kate? I'm curious. Is it because you didn't want to waste blood points on her or just never bought her.
---
BuBBa Op PlEaSe NeRf
---
To be fair, Myers does still have a TR and Red Stain
---
WHY IS THE CLOWN FAST AS SHIT HE WEIGHS 600POUNDS FUCK THAT FATASS
---
The whole point of his power is that it goes off while survivors don’t see him.
---
Being able to use it mid chase is dumb
---
Didnt think about that..I think a mansion map would be cool. Like a big ass mansion with like 2 or 3 stories.
---
THIS GUY FUCKING GETS IT.
---
NOTHING WORSE THAN A KILLER TUNNELING YOU FOR PALLET SAVING SOMEONE.
---
KILLER THOUGHT “I SHOULD GO FOR THE GUY WHO UNHOOKED. BUT THIS CLAUD PALLET SAVED KATE SO IM GONNA TUNNEL HER INSTEAD”
---
 AND JK. WHATS WORSE IS AN ASSHOLE UNHOOKING YOU IN FRONT OF HIM. TWICE. I SHOULD HAVE JUST FUCKING LET GO. WHY DID I THINK HE WOULD STOP GOING FOR ME AFTER THE SECOND UNHOOK. FUCK.
---
TL;DR — I GOT FARMED FOR PALLET SAVING SOMEONE.
---
YOU ARE A GOD AMONGST MEN!
---
I don’t see the issue?
---
Stake out
---
People expressing bafflement that the devs would put a killer on the PTB without realizing he has such a huge problem is not the same as people "legit pissed that the killer was shit in the TEST server." One is a proportionate response, the other isn't. Like I said before, what I mostly saw was reasonable people going "WTF, how could they not catch this obvious problem in internal testing?" and fanboys somehow interpreting that as burning rage rather than the very sensible question it is.
---
[Really quick](https://imgur.com/a/jjVs2o0)
---
I never bought that DLC. The only DLC that really interested me and which I bought is Spark of Madness with Doctor.
---
I didn't really have any better perks. The only stuff I have at rank 3 are Distressing, NOED, Territorial, Whispers, Beast of Prey, Thrill of the Hunt, and Iron Grasp. I was doing this as a daily, honestly. :D
---
I considered Whispers, but then I remembered I haven't played her in a while, so I opted into the "safe" perk in case I got absolutely destroyed. I only missed one hatchet, tho.
---
&gt;Increased crouch speed to 3.6m/s from 3.45m/s
---
[BMing as the killer intensifies]
---
Except she makes me anything but
---
Shoooooooooot heeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrr!
---
5 Blink nurse with mori. You couldn’t pay me to deal with that.
---
Also wouldn’t we consider the legion rework a cube?
---
More luck next time
---
u/monfuiser
---
generally I dc the first time I get hit because that means the killer is tunneling me and I have every right to dc
---
I like the 2nd and 3rd perks. dont know what u meant with the 1st perk
---
You also have to consider why people play those 3 killers in red ranks. Survivors seem to have a lot of Adrenaline, DS, MOM, Borrowed Time, etc. etc. etc., and gens pop very quickly. There's two sides of the coin here.
---
So glad to see my BIDIBIDIBIDIBIDI boy spread as a meme to other subs
---
NOED is fine.
---
&gt; It feels like bhrv are scared to put a GOOD killer out there.
---
I don't believe that they're scared, if anything I consider it to be a byproduct of the current content slate we're on: every 4-months to a given year, we're to expect a total 4 New Killers and 4 New Survivors (Perks &amp; Powers included) each.  But sometimes even the best laid plans of mice and men are never right.  Old content gets left behind &amp; not all chapters are created equally: no matter their efforts  Powers, Kits and Perks are destined to either be Situational, General, or Specialized.   Some chapters, will be stronger all around and weaker than others.  And this isn't a DBD patented issue, I hold the same problem with games like Siege and Overwatch.  I'd love to see more Freddy patches but they don't make headlines like a newly minted chapter does.
---
The last stack is always the smartest and always gets away,
---
Yet you keep running into the same survivor you've hooked
---
Or just cleanse totems lmao
---
I didn't even know a suncatcher was a thing, super cool!
---
Clown. I fucking hate that killer.
---
For me it's prayer beads. Fuck that.
---
Either which way?  It's still 1.5 Seconds, though you're right: Survivors *do* have a 3rd-Person Camera.
---
oh wow , have been watching him for a long time
---
Tbh that'd be me if I didn't realize it was in the house
---
Nahhh homie, I was talking about OP! I’m a Jane main who has had too many camping wraiths...
---
I FUCKING HATE THE DOCTOR. VERY ANNOYING TO GO UP AGAINST.
---
But we can crouch together &lt;:3
---
Wonder if it addresses the downed and hooked survivors affecting GF
---
It delays notifications and the icon changes in the bottom corner from the survivor’s perspective
---
The Entity took over
---
I’ll see if my game’s working by then, thanks man
---
&gt;Reason
---
Situation: You really played well, fair and without tea-bagging or anything else. Than, the killer comes (doesn't matter if he is a baby killer or a good killer) and without needing ANY skill, he got a 4/4.
---
I'll just use Rancor instead. Can't be countered by deleting totems, and after I instadown you I can just Mori instead of hooking. From Hero to Absolute Zero within less than a minute.
---
6/10, not sure how useful his ability would be all the time feels like it’s a very iffy ability, but at the same time could be very strong if used right
---
In awe at
---
Ah makes sense.
---
nothing i hate dcing. i just do it for memes mostly
---
yes very impressive, kudos
---
Nerf Billy? Lmao
---
Cleanse the totems
---
Idk it kinda depends on how you're feeling. I prefer to maximize my hooks and let people get saved. So I'd probably look around the shack a bit and then proxy nearby gens if I don't see anyone. Of course I don't blame you for camping in this scenario.
---
Pretty sure she's free boss. "Buy" her and the cost will be $0.00 and you can then just download the whole DLC
---
I don’t get it, they all got such low points. Did you camp, did they not save? When they let survivors die on first hook everyone loses points and Pip potential. Did they not do any gens lol?
---
You know who is getting there for me? Wraith. You get caught you get invisible face camped 8/10 times.
---
Isn’t the huntress chapter free?
---
Ok good then let's make adrenaline works ONLY if you haven't been hooked. Unfair? Yeah as well as having few perks dedicated to totems (hexes are weak af, every. Single. One) completely removing perks if attached to said totem
---
You know why people never uses noed in high ranks? It gives you 1 down at best before being insta cleansed so you had 3 perks for the entire game except for those 30s you actually used it.
---
"It should include totem counter if has to counter noed" you know you want to have more power and information than the.. you know.. POWER ROLE. Without even counting you as survivor have already more power than a single killer..
---
I'd like to see this game balanced and adding counters to fine perks isn't the solution. Look at BBQ now, it has 9 counters after the latest patches.. like come on! 6 are even perkless counters and people still complain about it, maybe not you but many does!
---
Same thing here, you have many options, 1 leave, he won't take more than 1 kill since noed is used by bad killers or who's learning it. 2 move stealthy and cleanse noed, BT free 4 escapes. 3 use any perk that helps you REMEMBER the classic totems spawns, after you learn them you don't need the perks anymore (like high ranks do) to find totems
---
Problem solved, in conclusion, don't be entitled to change a peri because you don't like it wanting to have the same power in a 4v1 game comparable to the single powerful unit as a team member.
---
I got killed too by noed sometimes but you know what pisses me off? The perk? No, the people that keeps running around the hook like they're waiting for Chtulu to come and save me while they get slaughtered due to their stupidity
---
Unless you're unlucky like me and get the worst possible RNG with every fence being high walls/bushes :) Never seen that before, although i've never had Haddonfield 6 times in a row before either...
---
When I get tunneled and I know I’ll get no blood points
---
Oh great, my two least favorite things combined into one. Feng stans and Kitana stans
---
At least you can actually SEE when you’re looping the killer. Clown fucks up my vision even when I’m wearing my glasses
---
To be true the doc i dont know why its just i dont like him and i know i am gonna be pissed after i played against him so i rather leave and only blame myselfe that i am to bad to play against him than just shitting on the killer or my survivor compains
---
This only works against stupid survivors
---
so like spine chill, exhaustion perks, etc?
---
She is? I didn't know that! Thanks! I was so worried that I can't get her without spending money I want to spend at Freddy!
---
This makes me happy
---
No, more like finished gens, hooked survivors, and injured/downed survivors
---
Look at her
---
Oh wait it's not ghostface, my bad
---
Thank you a lot much! I do think that those concepts need a few tweaks. For example, the Family just seem like the Hag with less teleportations, so there's that.
---
Full disclosure, I don't know.  This post was made assuming that add-ons were functioning correctly.
---
Awwww. I was hoping that it would have the blood dripping over the mask, like the store version that gives you the pump to push the blood around. Could be cool to see that unique P3 mask with him.
---
Well then you can kindly leave 🤷‍♂️
---
No. Even though I always play as survivor, just no.
---
It’s a joke mate.
---
Ah yes, finally a petition for players who want the freedom to rush their opponent out of the match, but don't want to ever have any consequences or disincentives for it.
---
And what rank are you?
---
Spirit, Plague, and Endgame Collapse all had updates mid-PTB so that is objectively false.
---
What to call it now
---
Licensed characters can’t be gotten with shards, only money. But you can use the shards on a bunch of original killers, might I suggest Spirit.
---
i like this new meme more
---
Depends what map am i on?
---
Damn, some of you will sandbag your teammates just because you don't like which killer you're up against. BHVR will never be able to address entitlement this thick.
---
It's still enough to play, I get 22fps on pc.
---
Ghost might be able to activate night shroud in chase which would make great mind gaming with red stain hides
---
Oh fuck yeah
---
Np. Now you can spend those shards are another non-licensed killer of your choice. Happy hunting boss
---
I know that and I already got all killers exept Freddy and Bubba. What I meant was that I was worried I need to spend real money to get huntress instead of using it for Freddy!
---
It depends. 
---
If you want to win a 3 to 4k then you camp. 2 hooked survivors means that the survivors will take 120 seconds to die. 2 survivors will be able to push out 3 gens in that time span. After the 2 die then chase one of the survivors, secure the hook then find the other using BBQ. You only get a 3k if the other survivor finds the hatch. 
---
If you want to play for points and pips then leave the basement. Return to the basement if a save has been made or if you hit David.
---
 
---
Hitting David assuming the other survivor is not an swf will make them think you have committed to a chase with him meaning the chances of the other survivor running for a save is very likely. Returning to the basement will guarantee a hook trade.
---
So strong it got me on my knees... The drink, I meant.
---
If it was in the hatch then they allow it. If it was the exit gare then idk what to tell you. Maybe endgame collapse changed it.
---
Thanks! I already have every non licensed Killer so I guess I use those shards on the shrine when I find a perk I want! What a bummer that decisive strike was in but isn't anymore now
---
Better him being too strong then too underpowered.
---
C'mon Pogo, head on a swivel!
---
It's funny, because the change to it that is needed is quite simple. If you're the last survivor remaining, open exit gates faster. Let's say 30/40/50% faster. Boom, done. That's that perk balanced in a way that gives it a proper place in the game.  
---
I've seen some people talk about making it so you can open the hatch after the killer has closed it, but that just removes the balance (and stress) they've introduced with the EGC and the hatch closing mechanic. It would make the remaining survivor too strong, as the devs have removed the killer's ability to grab a survivor jumping into the hatch.  
---
In my opinion, it's much better to give it a boost in opening exit gates, as it would give you a good, situational-but-strong bonus without completely breaking the current balance of the game.
---
There were five gens left. They suicided on first hook. All three of them did. They were three Meg players who all tried to run at the hook and just were downed. One of them triggered Territorial but didn't save, sitting in a locker. Head-on memes, I guess? There were a total of five hits, all with hatchets. One interrupt pull-off with two true downs. They just killed themselves ASAP. I don't get it. They must have known, too, because they were being little knobs in chat.
---
When there's a presence of a killer in the game.
---
&gt;I'm so bored playing vs the same 3 killers in red ranks
---
So buff the other ones.
---
The Yelp
---
Ah ok, it's been awhile, I was passing along a tip someone told me, but that makes sense
---
"This guy is not in our league..."
---
Ah right On XD I misread that :)
---
&gt;cunt hair off
---
Not a unit of measurement I wish to hear a second time
---
I get by :) I was born in the low FPS'
---
Nah the scariest thing is getting jump scared by Myers.
---
In awe
---
Green only? That's a surprise.
---
People have mentioned the big buffs, but another change that's really strong is Night Shroud now always hiding the red glow. This means that at loops that aren't see-through or low, Ghostface killers will be ridiculously strong. Look forward to see how they change addons around these changes. 
---
Won't shock me if they revert or weaken at least one of these changes because I have a feeling survivor players are going to have a really shit time against this iteration on maps such as Lery's. As with all changes, just have to wait and see. But at a first reading, I think he won't be quite as strong as Spirit but definitely a top tier killer. Top 5 perhaps.
---
They used to tie a killer's performance to their sole purpose of existence, but the community complained that fewer killers gave them the hatch or let them farm or something. Now it's about hosting a fun match, but not being too threatening, like you're an actor in one of those 'haunted' houses that pop up around Halloween. I understand why and even kind of agree with the emblem system, but you should never downpip for getting a 4K.
---
In
---
OG gang
---
Exaggeration doesn't bring points accross
---
Are you on console? I think Doctor is free too if you are. Get him and farm some points!
---
Man aint it crazy meeting fans of your own game !?
---
Everyone: How the hell do you hack a gun?
---
Sombra: Fuck you thats how.
---
Enjoy that derank buddy, you've earned it
---
Casually crouch walking at you with Billy chainsaw speed.
---
LEMME TURN SOME FUCKERS INTO LEGION
---
I really like Ghostface's dramatic ass sigh that he does. Perfectly captures what getting a pallet dropped on you when you think you had the survivor feels like.
---
Also Spirit's is pretty great but that's just cause all of her soundbites are hilarious. It's so funny how she just "WAAAHH"s at the already dead survivor at the end of her mori.
---
What's the pig's crouched move speed? I feel it should be like 105% or 110%. You get slowed down while crouching, and make a very obvious blade sheathing sound, you also slow down while standing up or charging the dash, all while making a loud tiger sound... for some reason...  
---
If one of these actions bit faster you could crouch to mindgame the survivor then dash in their face. Also, maybe make it so that you can legion leap through windows( but not pallets) while dashing now that it's a thing in the game, it would make her a bit cooler.
---
Ohhhh, no. Don't get me wrong, I don't want another Freddy tier killer as well.
---
I thought I said I was fine with another top tier killer in this post though?
---
I'm also pretty darn sure, with months of experience on this game and hitting rank 1 as Killer multiple times under old system, I feel I know what I'm talking about...
---
My theory is that it's not going to be Nurse tier. It's going to be Legion tier. Ghostface will get Legion level complaints and Legion level reactions on this subreddit. Remember how you would get downvoted into oblivion on this subreddit if you said Legion wasn't OP/didn't need a nerf?
---
Freddy, according to Tru3... nobody complained about him on the PTB. But when he went live, everyone immediately started complaining and he was swiftly nerfed to what he currently is now.
---
And LMAO, I play on console. I'd honestly never like to deal with Billy and that saw + saw hitbox which ACTUALLY has zero counterplay without a pallet or vault. (People also still give up when going up against Legion by the way. XD)
---
You say this... but in a while or in a few months, I have a feeling your tune will change completely.
---
Don't worry, they will likely nerf him before/soon after he's live.
---
Would you say the same for Legion?
---
You know it's gotten bad when that was the first thought I had after that triple.
---
Wow you’re pathetic
---
Isn't doctor free for everyone? I had him since I got the game.
---
And yes, I'm in PS4 :D
---
You know what is worse than it flipping? A black ward.
---
You dropped it a little late
---
Yes this is actually one way to use the plague and force survivors to actually cleanse their sickened.  Just thanatophobia isn’t enough sometimes,  but both?  Oh yes.
---
Oh cool. Console player here and haven't been keeping up. So what i heard earlier is no longer the case? That he is bad and twirling your camera disables him. Glad to hear it. Did they change anything else beside the bug?
---
i don’t like the blood over the black part of his mask🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Save up for Ghostface? He will be coming out very soon.
---
Criticising the game is good, criticising the way the devs can works can also be a good thing but being angry at them is a bit too much.  There's as much angry people as defensive one, they are not the majority of the community but the two are really vocal. Wanna see some bad apple? Go find Behaviour's big event, their big streamm and look at the chat, even reddit talked about it.
---
i was going to comment that, but you have the high ground now
---
I am unable to can
---
Yea and with his buffs I'm really excited for him! And also I'm excited for the Freddy re-work!
---
Yes. Because rembmer people thought legion was weak
---
I like the having to collect them, but where would he collect them at?
---
Also what if they took burn damage like the longer you were in the fire the longer you are “burned” so you would run like you were hurt for a period of time but would slowly get faster? Just an idea
---
when a survivor and killer are working together.
---
The rework I THINK is coming out somewhere around September.
---
Is this an error code 302 thing? If so put in a support ticket. They will ask for proof of bp and give it all back. I lost David's donkey jacket, Kate's event tank and billys propain hammer. Also my rank was completely reset. I was returned 175 mil bp which is taking forever to redistribute and 2k shards for my trouble. Hope this helps.
---
Thanks for the Info!
---
Lol I just started playing with a rank 15 who is 14yrs old. We are on PS4 tho.
---
What was your loadout?
---
You kind of contradict yourself:  Yes they can get the Full Heal but then she can upgrade her power.
---
If people don't cleanse then she is a Permanent NOED Killer. Being Able to Insta Down everyone in 1 hit is a pretty strong power
---
Thank you.
---
Not a hit by pallet sound, but I particularly love the clowns laugh after hitting a survivor and wraith when you spam right trigger to hear the bones rattle. Really pleasing in my opinion. Oh, my favorite hit by pallet has to go to Amanda. She's so cute.
---
It's a wee bit over 100%.
---
Having gone up against many a Spirit in my time, I've yet to work out what her power is.  She blinks around like the girl from Wreck It Ralph sometimes but I think there's more to it?  Either that or she is just totally useless weeb fan service
---
I don't see anything being mentioned about downed survivors or hooked survivors being able to detect ghostface? Are they going to be able to still do that?
---
*laughs in noed*
---
You don't need 12 hooks. You need 9, and make sure everyone's been hooked once and dies.
---
So if you hook 2 people 3 times and then you can hook the last 2 once. Or hook 3 people twice and 1 thrice
---
R1 both sides.
---
love the logo one the most... great work!
---
Oof
---
Ah, she needs an update soon anyways, maybe after the freddy rework.
---
Damn that was satisfying that triple chainsaw.
---
I run a build of BBQ and Chili, Distressing, Overcharge, and Pop Goes The Weasel. Lot of blood points to be had.
---
Me neither. It's like they tried too hard making it "noticable." 
---
It doesn't ruin it entirely for me, though, it still looks pretty good.
---
And you don't use Ruin? On killers besides Nurse?
---
Quit acting like a douchecanoe
---
Don't really like going vs Spirit, there isn't too much feedback for the survivor to work with.
---
Which sounds pretty fun. Plus the killer instinct on revealers in an interesting idea, gives you a cue to punish them.
---
YOU HAVE BEEN PUNISHED FOR OTHERS BEING BAD, YOU ARE WELCOME!  
---
-BHVR
---
If you say Stan unironically you deserve to commit self morí
---
Why pop goes the weasel over over unnerving presence?
---
WAZZZZZZUUUUUUPPPPPPP!
---
I was actually a fan of the minimalist approach, but I know I am in the minority.
---
It should still be fine and not overpowered considering that he is still an m1 killer and that 45 seconds can still be a long time against a good survivor, or a scared one that drops pallets. :)
---
Object of Obsession, Spine Chill, and Premonition will also still cheese him.
---
These are buffs/changes. They already said survivors on the hook seeing him were a big so I’m assuming they fixed it. Hopefully. Oh entity please....
---
I like how DbD is doing the "random skin theme" that a lot of other multiplayer games do, but instead of sexy Qipaos or bikinis, we get the roaring '20s , art museum openings, and shitty Xmas sweaters.
---
Apparently you care enough to leave this comment
---
Not sure. I woke up and all of a sudden I was the original ghostface.
---
Deja Vu is best perk
---
I like how much of a difference rank and platform affects this. I'm a rank 15 PS4 player. If I choose nurse il get 1 or no kills. If I play spirit I might get 2-3 kills depending on how much I end up mind gaming myself with her phase. With wraith however I get consistent 3-4 kills every game because he's easy to play and the survivors are potatoes that I always get a free hit on.
---
Moris ruin it, but add-ons and offerings are a-okay. Just don’t add that fourth perk.
---
It is still possible to double-pip if someone DCs, but it’s best if you’ve hooked them at the VERY LEAST once, twice is preferable. I’ve gotten a couple that way.
---
The hardest one will just be whatever killer you’re not proficient with. I got Freddy’s Adept first try, but I’m one of the poor souls that actually likes Freddy a lot. Meyers gave me a lot of trouble just cos I suck with him. But in terms of just base-game trophies, I’d say the Nurse might be toughest based on her power and using it well enough to get 11-12 hooks in a match.
---
I’m also on that trophy hunt, wish you luck man! The Adept/Merciless system is all kinds of dicky, and there’re a lot of games that should be Merciless that end up Ruthless. Just gotta keep at it, eventually you’ll get that game!
---
Dwight. Always called useless and worthless.
---
Jake. Rich, spoiled and board.
---
Meg. Pure evil.
---
Claud, science gone wrong.
---
These changes look great on paper but the real clincher is going to be the reveal phase. 
---
If they don't get the reveal action sequence right this is just a really good M1 guy.
---
Not even slightly.
---
I don't know what rank you're at, but once you hit survivor ranks 8 to 10 people *know full well* not to 100% either gate for any old reason.
---
You'll see this in practice running killer when you down someone with NOED (though not every time, some survivors value their own life over finding NOED - but not because they don't know to 99 the gates, just because they don't care) and especially when (on either side) they suspect Blood Warden.
---
I see people waiting until after the hook to open the exit gate more often than not on any killer I play, way more than the released SWF numbers (anecdotal, but feels half the time at worst and 70% more often) and I'm only a rank 12 killer.
---
*99ing the gates is not some herculean task of coordination reserved for SWF.*
---
Edit: Also you're clearly making assumptions to support your own bias, and being deliberately insulting about it - you know this cheapens your own opinion right? Someone *could* be absolutely correct and still be utterly discounted on attitude alone.
---
The DBD community is the only one I can think of that feels the need to replace time tested memes and input the characters from the game.  I don't get it and it seems to add very little, often skewing the point and blurring the message.  Can't we just use normal memes with badly photoshopped faces like everybody else?
