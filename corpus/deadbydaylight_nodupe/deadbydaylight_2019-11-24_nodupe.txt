You missed "loud sound of laughter over discord" for Legion

---
No NOED either, just luck.
---
That’s why I play Samus in Melee
---
Yes she was op, the only counter to nurse was losing sight of her and that gets thrown out the window if she has three blinks. Spirit barely takes skill at all, her mindgames are one sided because she has way more information than survivors and when you're injured it is IMPOSSIBLE to counter her phase.
---
They just need to give him some cooldowns on his ability (and maybe take away the flick).
---

---
Charging wouldn't be so bad if he couldn't just cancel the charge and start a normal chase without a moment of cooldown.
---
What a Trash chapter honestly lul
---
Honestly the boar outfit with those cute bouncy toys hanging on it was the best investition ever
---
Ugh they could easily make it so you rank up faster based on your performance if u have a higher rank killer and if you have read anything you'd know they are already looking into doing killer ranks seperately. Also doesn't rank reset already do that now? It wouldnt leave them stuck frequently as if they are good they will level up fast someone could be great with one killer and struggle hard on another which u will never learn if you are constantly facing god survivors.
---
My apologies for my current gaming expierience not conforming to your standards.

The difference between Oni and Billy is comparable to the difference between Spirit and Wraith IMO.

Forever Freddy

3 gen doc

Nemesis legion (coming soon™)
---
Basement bubba
---
Right, my killer rank hasn’t changed in many matches despite the majority of those being fairly successful and my survivor rank hasn’t dropped from green despite getting sacrificed every other round
---
Pirate killer tho
---
Exactly, to be 'adept' with a killer means that you can use their ability well, but you get punished for using it and don't get the achievement for doing well with their ability, so its just an oxymoron (if that's the word to describe it)
---
That's the point
---
I’m definitely going to try nemesis legion. Maybe basement bubba, and forever Freddy once the perks and addons appear in my bloodweb
---
When this comes out i'll become Harry the clean up guy pickin up pallets and saboing hooks for my team
---
Lol. Evil Within, Prey and Doom are the only stuff I like about Bethesda. And looks like they don't want EW 3 like at all?
---
It leaves EVERYONE stuck in those ranks for a few days. And there will be lots of killers playing with a variety of killers, ruining low rank survivors’ games. You’d constantly be facing god killers.
---
I agree with your nurse needs they make sense with the 3. Blinks and all that but have you saying spirit requires no skill your wrong. Have you ever faced a spirit that’s trash because I have. I play both killer and survivor but  I like playing killer more and when I play survivor against a spirit most of the time they suck and don’t know how to land a shot since they just lose sight of you once they phase and you stop running
---
I don’t have MYC yet sadly but thank your for this build

Some of you survivors are alright.  Don’t come to Badham tomorrow.

Well OP had noed so one of them probably wasn’t making it out. They should’ve left before the clip even began though

And thats why I run unbreakable.

her father killed his family, i dont think he's exactly 'fit' to be a survivor

My friend group likes to call the huntress Russian thickness

Doctor with Overcharge, Distressing, Unnerving Presence, and a 4th perk (I use BBQ but if you want to be sadistic something like Coulrophobia, Franklin's Demise, Hex: Huntress Lullaby, Dying Light, etc.)
---
Double calm addons for as large of a terror radius in treatment mode as possible, and use a Jigsaw Piece as the offering for the smallest map.
---
 it's a glitch that you have to try to do on purpose in kill your friends. If you notice they're only three survivors in this match. The last one might have been added in post. But there's only a black bar over three names.
---
There's no way for this to happen on purpose. It is purely private match. And requires a lot of setup. If you do it in public match you will be banned.
---
TRu3 I can handle in small doses. I like his GF vids . The YT guy I loath is WhyneTyme. That guys crying gets under my skin. I don't understand why people watch him bitch and cry. WhyneTyme is that fake intellectual you run into and  try to dodge because they try to hard to sound smart.  I think. HYBRID, Monto, Bricky and Ohtofu are the best and chilliest.
---
No. Definitely not.
---
Lol okay bud like I said someone might be a god killer on one and trash on another and if they wore an absolute god killer on everyone they would easily rank up fast wouldn't be hard to make them skip ranks. Meh we will see what they do they already mentioned possibly doing this for when they change the rank system.
---
Jane can be Ms. Wheezer.
---
Like, seriously, one dc makes it hard enough to gain rank points, but this is ridiculous. I'm surprised I was able to retain my rank (didn't help that I was playing legion).

*heavy breathing intensifies*
---
His comments section make me lose hope for the future of the game. Almost every single person complaining about the game in some way but usually killer mains. They talk so much shit about the devs and game im not sure why the even play.
---
I've tried reasoning with them, it's no use. Survivors who complain about those perks are the ones who think 16 seconds on a Totem is too long and they shouldn't have to do anything but click flashlights or work on gens. It's the same type of people who play Killer and call Survivors toxic for not letting them get the final BBQ stack or for (heaven's help us) Looping.
---
You can't argue with stupid.
---
fog was my absolute favorite scavenger, a name that kinda ties into dbd, and a cool ass gas mask
---
yeah, because killers just catch you and camp you if they think you are toxic (and i get a lot of "genrushing fuckers" "deadhard is not balanced" end of the match messages (even tho deadhard is bugged as fuck rn). The power is not balanced, they can show it other ways than sending a message while the frustrated survivor can only send a message most of the time. Like last night, the killer lost his ruin 15 seconds into the match and jsut camped the survivor, even though i was doing a gen 10 meters away, as soon as i moved to the hook he was shaking his head, he wanted to kill only him for "toxic" finding the ruin and then running him for 40-50 sec.
---
Bhanos Bag?
---
I've rarely seen these, though it may be just luck. Then again I slug to give people who were already hooked chances to stay in the game while I find someone else to hook.
---
just because it requires skill didn’t mean it wasn’t op
---
Oh ok. Another question, can the killers hurt each other if not kill.  Can spirit step into trapper’s trap forexample.
---
And also didn’t mean to offend you or anything just saying that most of the survivor mains complains about every perk and killer that is good just because they get destroyed by it in 1 game. Maybe your not one of those survivors but you have to admit most of the survivors complain about everything and then you have killers which who also complain but not as much. I mostly just complain on how trash some killers are now just because people started complaining. Like legion he sucks the wraith is just a m1 killer demogorgon is just meh pig sucks now also plague isn’t good she just gets countered by any good survivor leather face is only good for camping and trapper is only good if you know how to play him
---
Da doctor is the funnest to play against.  Getting scared at every corner. Tripped me out the first and only time so far.  Can't wait to play him again.
---
Killers have lost hope and emotions, so a predator in that state wouldn’t care about unarmed individuals anymore.
---
When killers complain to survivors to do totems and then get petty when they're ruin/no ed/devour is destroyed.
---
If you read the lore of spirit the entity  promises rin that she will one day be able to kill her father and get vengeance. Seeing how no one ever acually dies rin can kill him over and over. Not to mention that Oni would also be mad at him for bringing shame to the family name. Would be a lot cooler survivor than Am every cyberpunk girl ever. Am ride motorcycles and race. Am uber cool and stuff.
---
Oh it most definitely can, and it most likely will in the future (ha)
---
Honestly, if they hadn't been t-bagging I probably would've dropped them off at the hatch. I use NOED though in case people like this get too smug and start being toxic.
---
Pop is best run with the “Fuming mix-tape” this limits the amount of times you’ll go to a gen that’s done or not worked on at all.
---
Honestly you can’t argue with what you’ve said I honestly agree
---
You'll get it eventually, don't get discouraged! It took me like 800 hours to really understand jungle gyms and map layouts.
---
I wanted to let him live
---
Bringing a killer with a gun to DBD would be impossible. It would be unfair and nerfed out of the game. I'm sure they will share a killer between both games soon but will change them to not have a gun.
---
Nurse was only good if you knew how to play her which makes sense you master a killer and you become really good with them. I played against a lot of nurses and some are gods because they practiced some are meh and some were just complete trash and just gave up on blinking and walked everywhere
---
Your a good guy ahaha
---
I call Plague "Boomer Bile".
---
Oni is actually good on indoor maps though. Oni's power lasts a while and with proper use can down 2+ survivors with a single use, it isn't uncommon to down everyone with one use of his power and win right there even. Yes he has his clear downsides of having a horrible early game and Hillbilly still has clear advantages, but unless you yourself are misusing his power it's really good for tracking, pressure, control, and lethality. Not to mention the power innately counters the "no healing" meta survivors have right now.
---
It happened to me today, it happened when I faked a mori
---
Honestly I’m not gonna argue your opinion matter as much as anyone else’s
---
This
---
the only survivor in my memory that isnt licensed that had something to do with their killer was nea, and that was purely just the *location* she went to. and whether the entity promised that or not is irrelevant as the entity has been shown to manipulate with the emotions of killers (more specifically the oni with the statue in the new map) so they kill more often.
---
Survivors: Dwight, Meg, and Claudette are all good for newer players as their teachables are all fairly simple with little risk or requirement to use.
---
Killer: Trapper, Wraith, and Hillbilly (but it's mostly up to preference as to which Killer you enjoy)
---
Trapper is simple as you go pick up a trap, place the trap down in spots you think Survivors would run through (grass makes them more difficult to see), and then you pick them up from the trap or smack them then pick them up. (You do have to learn how some maps generate so you can put traps in the good areas Survivors might run to)
---
Wraith is a simple Stealth Mode &amp; Non-Stealth Mode, really simple to understand but has nothing to help in chases.
---
Billy is more advanced if you try to land Chainsaw hits but you can use his power simply for movement between gens and quickly breaking pallets if Survivors drop them early.
---
I didn't say they had to be related. Im just saying it would have been cool and would have made sense. Really anything would have been cooler than Yui
---
Interesting 🤔
---
Pre-buff freddy, The original.
---
It’s not useless if u use doctor and I wouldn’t consider it a waste if you can use it right
---
what do you mean trash its going to be great what are you on about
---
can i call you harry?
---
Especially randoms
---
Am I one of the only people that mains Survivor but doesn't care about shit talk and all that? I usually/always say gg to all games. And I think of myself to be a pretty good survivor. I'm currently a rank 5 as survivor.
---
The issue is that a killer that can charge faster than you can reach a pallet and one-shot with pretty decent control isn't fun or interactive just because he can't do it *all* the time.
---
A Spirit gen grabbing you with Prayer Beads cuts off 1 full chase as well, that wouldn't feel any better if she could only do it *sometimes.*
---
It's even worse for the fact that it's nearly never your own fault that he's powered up, he gains his power from a chase with someone else, then YOU lose because he comes charging at you powered up.
---
Say what you want for balance, he's easily going to be hit with the "not fun" tag quickly.
---
Unfortunately, if you scroll down in the 3.4.0 patch notes under miscellaneous bug fixes, they have already "fixed" it, and promise not to worry because they are working on hiding prestige and level to other players as well.
---
it really wouldnt have made sense, the man killed his family, whether or not the spirit wants to kill him doesnt make a difference that he murdered 2 people
---
But it's not the end game collapse because there's 2 Gen's left and there are 3 survivors alive while you Mori the only one down.
---
Maybe you’re right but as a dude who doesn’t care where I stick my dick I literally don’t need a shirt that says I’m bi, also straight up where the fuck does she get off calling me a homophobe I literally served my country and didn’t ask for a fucking rainbow unit patch. I hate ppl like her I’m in the closet dealing with my sexuality and she’s over here calling me a homophobe.
---
Love the flair
---
1) The Hunter doesn't have to have a gun, as Inquisitor has a giant claw while Poacher and Stalker both have combat knives. Most of their equipment is super high tech and it could easily be that they can't upkeep them.
---
2) They won't share a killer between both games as Deathgarden is shutting down its servers at the end of the year, hence the sudden push to have some DG characters in DBD.
---
Place them in the spaces between the pallets, especially if it’s a grassy map. Or the outside side of a window survivors are likely to fault through. That’s worked for me when I had daily rituals/archive challenges to do. Eventually you’ll chase a few people through them.
---
Yeh a lot easier with a swf,if being honest
---
Yea but I don’t deserve a fucking say though right just butch ass lesbians.
---
Thank you!
---
The Entity can basically do as it pleases. Its super vague on what it does. I dont think theres any rules on what can and cant become killer or survivor other than losing all hope of escape or something. In the Hunger animatic that survivor almost 100% became a killer. So if the entity wants to fulfill a promise and make a killer a survivor it can the same way it can make a survivor a killer
---
I didn't give an opinion on it either way.
---
I kinda like my entity Baket theroy
---
Look how she acts with already I guarantee you hook her wearing that badge and she reports your steam for gay bashing. I love a trap way more than most and she calls me out for being homophobic. This is literally what we need as a community more divide right?

U telling me u don't aren't atleast level 59368? Lol baby player learn how to play the game noob
---
Trapper is really the only killer I play and imo he as a killer requires the most understanding of how survivors play. I can give some general tips though:
---
- Place your traps in past the pallet not under them like most trappers do. This will let you get a free destroy on any pallet a survivor tries to use on you.
---
- At the beggining of the match prioritize trapping as much as possible on your way to generators. Try to get slaps on survivors and push them off of gens but dont tunnel until the map is heavily trapped.
---
- Place 1-2 traps at the basement shack. One outside the window in the grass and one on a grassy corner. This will get you a trap almost every game.
---
- Feel free to place random traps in grassy areas if the map geometry will funnel players into it. You'll get lots of survivor traps just by doing this.
---
- If you dont already have Hex: Ruin prioritize getting it. Honestly trapper doesnt have enough map pressure at all in the early game to not run Ruin. The perk is basically essential.
---
- Its okay to tunnel a little bit as trapper but you really want to keep pressuring generators and pushing survivors around the map. The more theyre moving the more likely they are to get trapped. Hopefully this helps.
---
make hillbully collect gasoline to for his chainsaw power.
---
Is movile already out??
---
Everyone is straight but you we get it.
---
Wait, we get blacklists?
---
That'd actually be a good system. If someone's added to almost everyone's blacklist, their matchmaking time goes up so there's actually a consequence for being a terrible person.
---
As the guy who is constantly the fucking victim of this, yes, please, just get the fuck away for a tiny bit. Along a similar vein, you know I'm on this gen or I got in this locker because I'm fucking injured and the killer is obviously going to go after a injured survivor, stop fucking looping around me!
---
Lay off bro, I just got the game, so I’m only level 47832
---
Yeah but now if you're exhausted, lots of loops can be useless because if you drop, the killer can get a free hit. It needed a nerf but not this one, and that's coming from someone who doesn't even use BL
---
Did you not read the rest of my comment
---
Now that man needs a mobile cannon.
---
We legion players are one
---
https://discord.gg/JuyJGsn
---
Don't put traps in the middle of a pallet, everyone will expect them and will likely disarm them. Instead, think of the loop a survivor will run around that pallet when looping, and put a trap on the loop somewhere in tall grass so that it is more hidden. Same with shack - putting a trap in a doorway is pretty obvious, putting one against the outside of a shack wall that a survivor is likely to loop is more effective. There are also some good surprise places to put traps (like on Haddonfield, 2nd floor, go out onto the roof ledge and put a trap on the outside of the window. Survivors cannot disarm it unless there are two windows to the same ledge, it blocks off an exit. Or on The Game, put one in the spot where a survivor lands if they drop down that chute in that one room.
---
If by you mean 20-1 ranking it doesn’t effect it
---
I didn't give an opinion on it either way. I was just giving a factual description of how the perk was in the past.
---
In my experience, I never had the perk on any survivors at the time, and I didn't play killer much, so it didn't directly affect me much. I'm fine with DS now (having played more killer games), but I don't use it often.
---
I would have fucking cried
---
Oh okay, yeah I had meant that but nvm haha
---
As seen by my tag, I prefer the name ‘the fredster’
---
No. That’s *the cheek clapper*
---
same
---
I've learned farming is much more fun when playing any of the killers. Yes of course I have to down them and feel bad just beating them up all the time but it's much more fun that way.
---
Behavior dev's gonna get you
---
i read it i just completely forgot it 2 minutes later lmao sorry
---
I prefer ‘gonorrhoea girl’ or just ‘green discharge’ but that works too
---
That k. What do you think tho?
---
Borrowed time only lasts a few seconds. If one doesn't go after the "just-unhooked" player, there is no problem getting fresh hits.
---
I'm sad they fixed the Solo survivor lobby camera :( I liked how zoomed in it was...
---
Maybe not tunnel
---
I like it

i mean itd make sense given how it manipulated the oni, why not manipulate survivors too
---
Hey! &gt;~&lt; don't boop the Pig! I'll put a bear trap on you!
---
Don’t blame the lore for that my guy....
---
I under stand what you mean on why she would be op but I don’t think she was op to the point where nurse will always win not matter what since a 4 swf rank 1 with really good perks could outplay a rank 1 nurse with the right perks. What can you do about it tho someone who’s played the game longer will always win. And I didn’t make it clear during the comment I understand why you is considered op
---
The Halloween chapter is definitely a good place to start as you get a solid starting killer in Michael and Laurie, both with some good perks. 
---
As for a second choice, Leatherface would be a good pick if you’re going to play killer as he gives BBQ and Chili, which is good for Blood points. His other perks are rather decent as well. Leatherface himself isn’t that great of a killer though.
---
Isn't that Myers though as well?
---
😬
---
Shit, where did you get that hoodie? I want one.
---
Spark of Madness (Doc and Feng) mostly because Lery’s should get a different version of the map
---
You’re right, I thought you were OP
---
Yeah lag happened more often because every game would have different ping and a lot of killers with shit Internet making the ping bad. But since dedicated came out, every game has been 70ms for me and I get this shit happening way more than it did with good ping before dedicated.
---
Holding the game hostage is when one side (say Killer) purposely forces a scenario where the match cannot progress to an end at all and doesn't intend to allow the match to progress.
---
Killer bodyblocks the remaining Survivors somewhere like the upstairs part of Tompson House? That's holding the game hostage because Survivors cannot do anything to leave or progress the match leaving them to dc.
---
Survivors can do this by purposely being immersive and not attempting to make any progress to end the match for an excessive amount of time.
---
While you were being messed with by the Killer (which you could still wiggle from grasp, go attempt to touch gens, or try to bleed out from being hit) the Nea was doing gens which means the game was progressing towards an end, and you can't consider the period of time you in the dying state as hostage because bleeding out is a clear way for the match to end for you.
---
What Nea and The Pig did can possibly be considered teaming if you have enough evidence and sent it in after reporting them both in game but it's not holding the game hostage at all.
---
Expecting competent survivors in DBD? Bro that’s pretty cringe ngl

Here’s a tip for next time when you 4K on console, especially swf. Make a group chat with the 4 of them and just put ‘gg’ ,nothing toxic. Sometimes they’re decent human beings other times they get salty af. It’s a win/win you only said good game and now you see them get salty, OR you can have a nice chat and can be good people.
---
Looks like that guy from the "LaLaLa" song
---
I would suggest adding Sharp Hand Joe for Freddy
---
Labeling an entire group by a very small amount of people is dumb. Yes there might be idiots that think not wanting to have sex with them is transphobic, but lumping all of them in that group is unfair. Also, what is their “ideology” exactly? They’re not forcing you to be trans, so what are they forcing you to do, accept them as people?
---
Because you can? It's personal preference. I like to grind for stuff or buy it just to have a reason to use that killer more. It's the same as why do you prestige a survivor? Ever since GF original costume came out I play as  him way more. Besides it can be a mini mind game. I'm more likely to take a level 3 prestige killer more serious or someone who spent $10 on a killer then bland regular out of the box killer. Same when I see a legacy survivor.
---
Okay good cuz I just bought it from the shrine
---
Mettle of man was nerfed into ass. It was a good perk before.
---
Hey you are free who to like or not. It's a preference thing. Coke or Pepsi.
---
I never go after the same person 2 times in a row because I know how it sucks to be playing solo survivor and ending a game because the teammate or killer decided to say ''fuck you''.  
---
Special camping treat to the blatant farmers.
---
All their first game? Haha
---
Not possible at the moment when I'm having the right information. Tried it somehow with friend a couple weeks ago but didn't work in an way :/
---
*Groovy*
---
One of the best perks to pair MoM with is Empathy (though Bond works too)- you see where injured survivors are, run over to them and intervene- so long as you’re within a certain range of them and take a hit, you get a protection hit. It’s a great pairing.
---
It's nice to see another RDO player, even though I stopped playing it some weeks ago.
---
Uhm maybe you could try not tunneling
---
The rank and level was added because of how matchmaking changed. It used to be that you were matched either with the highest rank number (like 18 instead of 5) or something in the average of all of the survivors. Now it goes by the lowest (rank 5 in the example), so they have to let you know what you're dealing with by exposing the ranks in your "party".
---
I play on xbox so no chat function
---
I'm not sure if demogorgon counts as strong but I absolutely love him. He's fun to go against and fun to play. His shred is really nice without being op, his chase music and animations are really good. And I second legion because he can slow down games just the slightest and you get good information.
---
My code is to spin, spin I must.
---
I saw a thread like this the other day, I also have not received my rewards im not quite sure whats going on but im sure they are aware. :)
---
Do you not know how to end sentences?
---
I call the Spirit “El Spookita”
---
didn't look like they appreciated it lol
---
That's not always the case.
---
People don't know how to play against him? Sure. But people don't know how to play him, neither. Definitely not to full potential.
---
And if a bad killer can destroy bad survivors... There's a solid chance that good killer can destroy good survivors as well.

---
You have to hit a survivor (likely two) and slow down during a chase to absorb the orbs, which may or may not bug out. Even then you can only hope to find a third to insta-slug with the ability. Miss your chance and/or hit a wall and you’re stuck with a cool-down then another charging phase.

---
I would point out as well Oni's power isn't strictly better than Billy's, as people like to frame it as. It's not as black and white as "Oni's better but has less uptime". They each have their situations that are stronger than the others.
---
Oni's power is really, really strong in the open field. If you find a survivor that isn't close to a pallet, the combination of being able to whip a full 180 degrees, as well as a cancel your charge without swinging pretty much guarantees an instadown. It also has better turning throughout the charge, and can't be bumped into things, giving him better movement around the map than Billy's.
---
However, a thing people often overlook is that Billy still has better turning *at the beginning of the charge*. This might not sound like a big deal, but this is a massive advantage in using the chainsaw as anti-loop. Speed addon Billy can start a chansaw around the corner and whip it to you. Oni doesn't have this luxury, and you may have noticed trying to dash around loops more often than not just wastes your time awkwardly skidding against walls. Oni's lunge can help a little bit, but not enough where you can't get the pallet down. This is what people don't realize when they say "you can't dodge Oni, wahhhhh." You're not supposed to dodge him, his whole kit's strength is punishing survivors for being out of position. You go to pallets and loop the power out of him instead.
---
You have really knocked it our of the park with this first killer concept. Good luck on that Krampus one

Papa yamaoka: *kills Rin*

It used to be a feature on release but they had removed it years ago, now it re-emerged. likely instead of removing the work they probably left it not enabled and it accidentally got enabled.

Lol sorry.

I don't think "getting better" is the answer. That will be just as stressful, you will just mechanically have a better chance of winning in some games.  
---
Not caring if you win or lose or, more likely, just playing the killers you think are cool and deranking as low as you need to go until the game is fun again is the answer.  
---
I'm shit at the game but down at Rank 14 some games I get styled on and some games I get to play out the I'm the real Michael Myers 4k fantasy. 
---
This is the problem with almost every competitive game ever made. The way it's MEANT to be played as a fun fantasy is almost never the optimal way in which you have to play at the highest ranks. The theme always falls apart and turns into dry mechanics that, for players like me anyway, sap the fun out of it.
---
I turned a few over in to running small game. You will never make a NOED post again and ruin will still be gone before first hook. I don't get why you would bitch about ruin or NOED if BHVR actually GAVE YOU A FREE COUNTER TO BOTH. What perk can't you drop for SG? Nope. Gotta have my meta any go on Reddit and spam things are OP. They even doubled the BP to cleans a totem. How fucking thick are you to still complain about either ruin or NOED. Find them yourself. If 1 or 2 guys ran SM in most of your games killers would never use hex perks. If you hate any Hex perks and don't use SG then you are stupid. It's 1 perk slot to save your team from all hex and if used correctly you nullify a perk for killer. In some games is it SG wasted? Yes, just like some games SC or SB is. Run it and never look back.
---
It seems like their attitude towards Deathgarden is negative without them wanting/trying to understand why and how many people there are that may want something like this petition to happen.
---
just sounds like you lost fair and square and you are mad about it. you win some you lose some
---
Then imagine how people are feeling about the exclusives that are getting unlocked for everyone.
---
What about the spider lady though? She would be fucking terrifying to go against.
---
Really enjoying ghost face ! Bought him a couple days ago as I wanted to start playing killer again and he’s amazing. Still not sure what’s best for him but I’ll get there.
---
Getting some Shadow of Mordor/War Olag vibes.
---
Wait …
---
YEP! Bought leatherface, leveled to 35 to unlock it, then it didn't show up in my demogorgon's bloodweb until level 40. Pretty good.
---
Since I started this challenge I’m averaging one safe unhook per day. Rounding up to the nearest whole number.
---
I think you should also add that survivors get a 30% movement speed buff after the last generator is powered. (Rin’s Revenge)

---
It's honestly both sad and hilarious. They'll be some bright-haired Nea spamming a flashlight at you and then disconnect once you down them
---
He used to be my main I used to run 4ks all the time then they did the rework and destroyed him . Yea the map pressure is nice but before you could isolate survivors in the dream world and slow gen progress way more
---
No, losing fair and square would me be using all the tools at my disposal to beat them the same way they did to me. I'd like to see them win if I use spirit with prayer beads, and tunnel everyone of them whilst also using a mori and a map offering for where I want to ga And I could easily do it, I have tons of them saved up because I never use them - I try to be a fair killer but it doesn't work when survivors don't play fairly.
---
I'd agree with this. Because subjectively, if I'm rank 10, I'm gonna get fucking shit stomped by a rank 2 guy who is on voice telling his rank 16 friends what to do. Whereas if I'm rank 2, sure, I have to face a bunch of other Rank 2s, but at least I'M RANK 2 in that situation. Not the scrublord that I am going up against like, lex luthor and his henchmen
---
This is how the Entity feeds on hope.
---
hopefully another original killer
---
That’s a great idea for a cosmetic, jigsaws red and black cloak for pig.
---
I've always thought of Clown as the mid-tier-hell posterboy tbh. He has a pretty reliable method of shutting down and deal with loops. He just lacks a goddamn lot in the map pressure department.

---
You're severely misinterpreting casual interest with the newest thing as legitimate investment in something.
---
And yeah, I don't need a run down of the mechanics, I played it and like a VAST majority of people dropped it because it wasn't fun, matches were incredibly brief, and other than spending all game hiding like a little bitch, there really wasn't gameplay on the survivor side.
---
Just because it was made by the same company doesn't mean it deserves to be treated like some martyr who went down valiantly and should be immortalised. It was a bad game, it died, move on.
---
We already have a killer with bear traps. 
---
 
---
 Why should it only be a chance to see the killer?
---
So his power is literally just the trappers power?
---
it's gotten alot better, but it still needs more work
---
Well in Hello Neighbour! he can drop bear traps.
---
Would be cool if we get something like the Hag again. She is the most non-human beside the Demogorgon and I like the idea of more "monsters" .. flesh and mud -&gt; bones and ash
---
But it's too easy to build it up. Like 2 hits on healthy survivors and a few orbs, far easier than it should be for what he gets
---
sounds like a bunch of fancytalk
---
0 W 0
---
*A-Ding-Ding-Ding*
---
I like the idea of a killer specific ranking tied to an average, especially with the new rank resets are not just plummeting player ranks. a fraction affects your base killer rank, so if you main 1 killer and get it to rank 1 your base rank will rise to ~8, so if they want to start playing a second killer they are given some comparative breathing room to learn the killer. if you raise this second, or even keep pipping the rank 1 killer that base rank will still climb, as the player is obviously strong in the killer role and doesn't need a cushion.
---
I never really got to play Demo for a month (waited for reset) as I couldn't really experiment with his tunnels and learn how to properly utilize them on my own as a couple misplays would lead to an easy 0-1k gen rush.
---
The mori’s should stay as they are. Except ebony. Either the devs need to rework the hell out of it or decommission it like the moonlight offerings. It’s just not good for either side since it fucks up your emblems as killer and is just not fun as survivor.
---
It's called dirty tactics. You say I tunneled yet what would you do if before you have walked 10 meters away from the hook 2 survivors rush in and get the unhook, of course you hit the person just taken off the hook because it's logical to go for the person who is one shot but no they have borrowed time. You chase them but they body block you and the unhooked survivor doesn't start bleeding out until they are out of your terror radius. So you hit the person body blocking and down them and then hook them. But then another survivor runs in with borrowed time and you repeat the process all over again until they juggle themselves out the exit gates. It is a broken mechanic if all 4 swf run it.
---
Against survivors who go to any lengths to win you have to do the same. I'm talking thompson house map, they spawn on top of ruin, they are do 3 gens within 60 seconds of the game starting by which time I have only just reached the survivor and am now faced with broken loops like cow tree.
---
I play fairly but had I camped from the beginning I would likely have gotten at least a 2k. 
---
Lol spirit was an extreme example, any killer with an ebony mori would get the job done. Hell I could face camp with a full charged chainsaw as the cannibal. 
---
Of course they t bagged me lmao. What annoys me is the fact that survivors always say " don't tunnel, don't camp" and you try and be fair yet it's double standards. You don't hear killers telling survivors how to play the game, it's total bs.
---
So BhVR forgot to mention that Billy got a big buff this next coming patch??
---
People like it, so of course they'll fix it. They only leave bugs people dont like
---
Honestly pathetic, its always been this way, they never change
---
That might be true but there is already a killer who does that. There has to be a significant difference or they would just be trying to sell the trapper in a new dlc
---
Your welcome!
---
we should be able to unhook survivors manually to mori them rather then just letting the entity kill them
---
Nah i just do totems.
---
You mispelled Leather Jacket + Test subject head + screwdriver weapon
---
Solo survivor is fine, the only time it's not fine is when you get placed with a 3 man premade who intentionally abandon you for their friends.
---
There are still infinite loops in the game, and extremely strong loops that RNG decides is fine like placing 3 LT walls next to each other. (mainly only happens on certain maps)
---
Generators still go way to fast, forcing most killers to run slow down builds and has given rise to Extreme Slow Down Freddy being VERY popular because of it.
---
I can't say how bad it is in other regions, but here in Australia it's highly common for 3 generators to be completed within the first 2 minutes no matter who the killer is. (I usually intentionally ignore generators for a while if it happens while I'm survivor to try to counter it)
---
On top of those issues we still have the fact that survivors can bully killers extremely easy, ever been in a game where survivors all burned Petrified Oak offerings with Sabbo toolboxes?
---
Happens way to often, and there's no way for a killer to effectively counter it, as it shuts down their ability to do their primary job.
---

Wait for black Friday, then you can buy everything separately if you just want only killers for example.
---
Maybe you should look on YouTube some gameplay of the killers you are interested
---
I saw someone call Spirit Blueberry today. I think it's fitting.
---
And it's even BBQ&amp;C, Best for Last, and an Ebony Mori :(
---
I just posted the video cause I thought it was funny but fine sorry
---
I never thought I’d see many Little Runmo memes, let alone any on this sub xD
---
Something tells me you don't play killer very often.
---
This is a bit of a long explanation but it’s a fun build and fun way to play as Ghostface. 
---
It’s playing Ghostface with Sloppy Butcher, Thanatophobia, Nurse’s Calling, and either Ruin or Corrupt Intervention. You also need to only use recovery addons since Ghostface’s recovery at base is a joke. 
---
Basically what you wanna do is use Ghostfaces’ zero terror radius and lack of red stain to land a first hit on survivors. You want to get as many people injured at all times. After you land your first hit, you let the survivors go. This is because survivors are very good looping, and it wastes a lot of your time. This way, survivors have to either waste time healing, with Thanatophobia and Sloppy Butcher, or they go down on one hit next time you see them. If they ARE healing, then you sneak up on them with your undetectable status, and down them. If they start working on a gen, you do the same. 
---
If you land a hit on a survivor, and you feel like you can end the chase quickly, then you down them. If they go to a strong area where they can loop you for a while, you let them go. 
---
If you’re interested in seeing this build in action, I would recommend you watch his youtube videos. 
---
I can say that it works from personal experience. As I mentioned in my original post, I 4k’d against a swf team that sent me to Haddonfield. Not many killers can do this. I almost always win playing this way, and this is me at the red ranks. I have gone against sweatier swf teams and have won as well
---
You can still loop the tractors without balanced landing to be clear.
---
For what?
---
As long as you're in terror radius it will always pop, no limit
---
for pig combat straps and video tape/amanda's letter for in door maps
---
for huntress iri head and infantry belt
---
So, the killer is a mix of Freddy, Legion, and Doctor?
---
Spirit being able to fake window vaults is such a good thing, and is a unique mechanic to her, it actually creates tension in this game which is something that as a survivor never exists, you just go through the motions complete the gens run a loop and escape without ever feeling like you're in trouble.
---
Until BHVR fix sounds breaking all the time, the collision should stay, I haven't heard survivor footprints in over a year, even while playing survivor and I have an expensive headset and am very particular about my sound settings. (I've reinstalled the game multiple times and troubleshooted as much as possible to determine the problem, it's entirely issues with BHVR's inability to keep this game bug free, we even have content creators like Monto and True complaining everytime BHVR fucks up sounds in the game)
---
For the borrowed time from the SWF! Just had a game against a camping hag and borrowed time came in handy...
---
lmao that doesn't even work, if the killer kicks the pallet while she tries to lift it then it cancels the lift, and the pallet stun is absolutely shorter than three seconds.
---
That's all I've been wanting for so long
---
i mean you just it runs poorly if they did that then it would run worse
---
I miss the "omg ur so boring..." when you use any meta perk or good killer.
---
This ain't it
---

---
If David king can have nipples, so can you. Don't be sexist.
---
Yeah wasn't in the same game as you. Don't get me wrong, I play solo survivor and borrowed time is useful against camping killers but in my situation I had bbq and chilli and was running away from the hook every single time. At the end however two of them rushed the hook when I had walked about 5 metres away.
---
Also if you have played high rank killer against a swf where all four of them run borrowed time and ds and they swarm the hook then you will understand how truly broken it is.
---
I meant if they finally get their shite together and get the game to run decent it should be fine textures don't usually take a performance hitbi doubt the game even reaches a 1.5gb of texture ram usage overwatch with max textures on pc barely reaches 2gb and these textures are soo low.
---
Cmon this games looks Xbox 360 era they should be more than capable of hitting 720p30 with decent quality textures for that resolution
---
By silly builds, do you mean the OP ones? Awesome fun /s.
---
The stagger reduction was kept even if you were exhausted which turned several loops into near infinites
---
um, can i have a link to the ptb perk looks please? owo
---
Thanks
---
Literally why I'm worried if he gets a nerf. He'll just end up being incredibly mediocre on ps4
---
If you go after the one that got unhooked instead of the one doing the unhooking, you’re still tunneling.
---
Mandy was always my favorite pig nickname
---
usually I try to stalk survivors first and then chase but I might pick up on this playstyle, thanks for the info. ghost face and huntress are currently the characters I do the best with (rank 11 btw)
---
Myers Tombstone is actually more OP than anything Oni since he can 99% his EW3 off of other survivors, then literally walk up to a different one and Mori them on the spot. That’s way more unfair than getting insta-downed by Oni.
---
Lets hope they do it now that they are giving pig cosmetics.
---
I love to collect salt messages. Interesting how my only messages are from survivors.
---
It's entertaining to watch skilled players outplay other skilled players without using using OP add-ons and offerings. 
---
Imagine watching Shroud starting a battle Royale game with good guns and taking out everyone in the first 5 minutes. That would be boring.
---
Not comparing Monto and Shroud because hat Shroud does takes much more skill since they are competitive FPS games.
---
You beat that by preempting how far around the loop you go while he's charging to the point where you almost go beyond the 50% of the way around the loop. He has to make two turns if he goes the other way and it's pretty telegraphed through his positioning. It's hard to explain here without being in-game, but I've spent the better part of the PTB only testing in KYF what he can and can't do. You can't tell me I'm wrong here because what I'm sharing are things I've tested extensively myself. Yes I know about the flick but there's ways around it, your loop spacing just changes. Oni can break pallets quicker and force you to play an open-field mixup afterwards, but this narrative getting spread that his power is unloopable even at decent pallets (I'll define the autohaven pallets ur talking about as decent. M1 killers can still mix it up and bloodlust it but it's relatively safe for at least a little) is just false.
---
More salt!
---
Robe addons (with paint brush if possible) with thana, sloppy and dyng light. 4th perk can be ruin pop thrilling tremors or whatever
---
I love that you can see the confusion on both our faces. Hes just looking down at the jake like "wtf are you"
---
Lol. I’m just teasing. But yeah, I would never pick it up for the switch. :/
---
Almost every Pig add-on is useless. The only exceptions are Bag and Crate of Gears, Timer and Videotape. Toxins can be good too but it's limited to her traps.
---
Yh it’s an Easter egg, a lot of horror movies feature other characters as surprise appearances. Like on scream 4 or 3, can’t remember there is a caretaker(janitor) wearing freddy Krueger’s jacket.
---
well the switch was sorta forced into having it if I remember correctly but ya we better get it soon or else they have no way of detecting self dcs
---
Out of those, self care
---
Plague is the one who is underrated
---
This happens ALL the time. Ever since the archives came out. Maybe not super constantly, but enough to be noticeable and annoying
---
Inner strength
---
Self care is the most consistent, but the most dependent on what perks the killer has
---
Second Wind is only active after being hooked so it'll only work 2 times per trial at the most
---
Inner strength can only activate up to 5 times a trial but it is the fastest, it depends on what your play style is
---
It's decent in terms it's playable and still fun it's just very disheartening that it's been two months and some basic issues haven't been fixed really :/ 
---
I can't imagine the Devs would be very proud of this port really
---
Isn't oriented around Christmas, still we have events and cosmetics about it. Doesn't fit the Chinese lunar event and we still get them. Doesn't fit many things but we get sht anyway like the BBQ event
---
You just sounded like an homophobe for just a charm idea, that's a really huge red flag dude. Your logic doesn't make sense if we take into consideration the history of the game
---
Plus the devs in their official Twitter announced they are gonna partecipate in a pride showing support. I mean, that's a perfect opportunity with the new charms thing. Why are you so mad about something that small that might make some people smile? I don't get it
---
By the way, a straight cis dude is telling you that. If someone like me can get that so easily idk why you don't? Unless you have some.. bad bias let's say
---
I prefer to just shock them as the doc, and then kick their generators, and draw out every game
---
They changed it so the passive of reducing the “fall stun” is no longer there. So now if you’re exhausted you have the same fall stun as normal. I think they made it where the sound you make when landing is reduced while using BL.
---
Be careful what you get because the game is poorly optimised. Better investing in a average PC that can run most games from 2018/19. Probably should look in a building pc sub for a lot better advice. Tell them the requirements and what you wanna do with it and they’ll find you a good rig

Those are event in the game, and unless you expect BHVR to make a gay event, it’s really not the place for pride Charms lmao. I’m not a homophobe either, I just don’t see why you gotta bring in sexual orientations into a game that’s scary. It’s literally dumb to do so. It’s on some Liberal-type shit to do so. And like I’ve previously stated, a lot of companies show support to LBGT and shit because of fear of backlash if they didn’t show support.
---
I agree 100%
---
his demon charge offers full map control, you can very easily steer with it since you don't get bump penalties for colliding with things. You can seamlessly run through loops and across/around an entire map with a single unbroken charge. BTW I think the charge is fine, I think it's ok having that much control and power.
---
The thing I was pointing out was his charge add-ons, which basically make the startup of his Demon Dash basically instant, allowing him to use it up close or during a chase with no slowdown, not to mention when he does miss or whiff an attack, allows for him to not get punished much at all with said add-ons equipped.
---
happy bing bong boi :))
---
I play mostly survivor my dude. Still, I had to make sure nobody can msg me because of survivors stalking me to harass, something killers never did
---
I've seen more survivors shitting on me than killers. Even when playing survivor myself, so... Yeah. I see this happening often not only to me
---
Just few times I've seen Killer snap but the only occasion they did that, they even said sorry afterwards saying they were stressed. Idk man, there are assholes on both sides that's totally true, can't deny that, but I've seen more sht from survivors
---
Did you hand write the diary of a wimpy kid books?
---
Its not an exploit, thats literally just what the perk does. Its right in the tooltip.
---
I guess unless someone had Unbreakable, that was a gameover
---
It will in the near future. They are 100% currently working on it, might take some time though
---
Dc punishment will be nice, but the facecamping punishment needs a rework. Losing a tiny bit of bloodpoints doesn't deter killers from camping the hook and ruining the game for another player.
---
If you aren’t going at editing your best bet is someone else. Or you will struggle
---
Yes
---
This would be cool for Hannibal Lecture
---
Probably the worst idea I’ve heard in a while. Anyone that has more than 100 hours in this game knows why.
---
I wanted to see if Hex: Ruin went away but I didn't get the chance to check before dying, his Michael also didn't seem to have collision with David. I thought all killers were solid. Michael had Brutal Strength 3, Hex Ruin 1, Monitor and Abuse 3, and Play With Your Food 3.
---
I'm fairly certain they were being sarcastic
---
That Bubba skin could actually be a legit skin. In one of the TCM films he wears a suit with a tie and all.

As all mayers merks, its situational. Look up for fungoose in YT and his bubba games
---
If the Nea hadn't bodyblocked and had just run up the stairs (like most solo-queue players would, unfortunately), Trapper would have downed Bill and both he and Feng would have died in the basement.
---
It was good team work, mostly. Although the Trapper easily could have hit Bill instead of Feng and garaunteed one kill. Or just waited out Bill's DS.
---
Ghostface is top tier that's why. Nurse, spirit and then ghostface

No Mither, ladies and gentlemen! The perk that isn’t good for SHIT

inaccurate.
---
I'm not sure about others, but I mainly have it to deal with people who tbag at the exit. Came in handy today.
---
I just didn't know what flair to use. I still think it's a good idea. There needs to be something to prevent the survivor from just being royally screwed like that.
---
The key should only open hatch if 1 more gen is done than alive survivors or if you're last alive.

Someone else mentioned ruin, best I could think was not have it activate until after the head start, either.
---
Probably looking to crawl out for the extra hit points. Neither was too bright though, since they stood too far away from the exit to crawl out.
---
Yup. At least before nurse was at least tolerable with practice since you had a lot more leeway in messing up. With the new charge blink system that leeway is gone. The only times I manage decent games with nurse is when I get complete potatoes or rank 15s.
---
Dwight's told thicccccc
---
Ok first spelling, lol secondly perks being situational is a bad thing. We want both killer and survivor perks that can be used in almost any situation. This leads to powerful and engaging perks for both sides. If every perk was as strong as monsterous shrine then the game would have died from lack of variety a long time ago. We want more variet not less.

Lol They could make it so easily you jump to a way higher rank oh no you ruin 1 or 2 low level games look how broken matchmaking and rank system is already get a 4k not one pip kill no one plus 1 pip. Your a rank 3 survivor here face a rank 11 killer, How many games already ruined due to shitty matchmaking and shitty rank system where bad people can cruise to high lvls with swf snd even constantly dying solo.We can agree to disagree simple as that have a good day.
---
I honestly think they could balance this game differently on the different systems. Similar to what overwatch did
---
"Holding the game hostage" is a bannable offense, yes, however what happened in *your* game was not holding the game hostage. Holding the game hostage is when one of the players does something that makes it impossible for the game to end, for example a survivor getting into a spot the killer can't possibly reach and not doing generators, or the killer blocking a survivor into a corner so that they can't do generators. In your situation, you just got hit by some potent defense and your teammate was a useless asshole, which also isn't bannable it's just rude.  Funnily enough, what *you* did could be considered "teaming" which I am pretty sure is considered a bannable offense in some situations. Getting slugged until you bleed to death also isn't considered holding the game hostage, because you literally have a timer on your game ending.

At the end of the day, your teammate wanted you to die, you literally tried to get your teammate killed, and the killer was a petty douchebag to let you bleed like that. You're all in the wrong in this situation.
---
I thought Billy was above Ghostface
---
Myers behind Clown and Wraith.. that's a joke, right?
---
I didn't mean THAT much of a head start, I meant, like, 6 seconds at the most. Just enough to let a survivor at least touch a gen before the killer is up their ass.
---
I would make it 0.33/0.67/1 for the movespeed percents, but even that may be a bit excessive, thinking about endgame killer builds with someone rocking Agitation, Blood Warden, PWYF, and NOED
---
Well, this is cursed.
---
What if they just removed his insta down from demon mode?  He would still be very mobile and healthy survivors would have a chance to escape.
---
What about making it so that Survivors need to be hooked at least 2 times before they are able to be moried?
---
Yeah, they honestly should've. But considering how buggy the game is already, I can't imagine how much worse it'd be in that case.
---
Now you need to BECOME The Trapped and have a tattoo of Trapper.
---
Seriously now, nice Trapper combo! I liked it.
---
First, Im sorry if I offended you with my spelling hope you can go through it.
---
Second, with situational I mean that works in some killers with some builds. Wich is a good thing that allows you to be creative. Bbq works in every killer but hag, while STBFL works with some killers.
---
Freddy is the best......He can teleport.....Slow down players during loops.....ruin pallets......kick players off gens.....see where players are.....etc. ...
---
The thing with GF is, on a map with Line Of Sight blockers he always gets a free hit unless you're running spinechill. But on open maps like blood lodge he's M1 killer. Also no red glow makes it so you can't tell where he is while looping. Unless it's an open loop.
---
It really depends on the person that you ask. Watch tru3 play ghostface and you will see why peoples opinion is changing
---
Soon^tm
---
All my yes
---
Nice custom lobby you got there buddy. Have an internet point anyway.
---
No idea about ps4, but xbox has an option to get messages from people not on your friends list but not notifications from them. So after every few hours or days I’ll check that section to see what people say lol.
---
I thought it was Randy Orton
---
Ghostface
---
Hag
---
Myers
---
Pig
---
Wraith
---
Clown
---
Would not neither? That’s a double negative.
---
The killer can never spawn on top of you, he spawns at minimum a gen away, and unless its a stealth killer you have time to disengage and get off, potentially avoiding the chase all together
---
I main Pig and as stupid as it might sound I don’t use her traps. So I always run the combat straps and Amanda’s letter as often as I can with an indoor map offering. 
---
But when I don’t have the Letter I use either the Blindness or Exhaustion addon
---

---
Honestly, just disable actions for the survivors, including vaults and shit, all they can do is move. No gens, no lockers, no totems, no sabotaging, just straight up walking. And disable them for five seconds after killer loads in, too, just for the gen rushing douche canoes. This may remove the "value," but to fix that, let the killer's spawn location be revealed, as like a big crow or something, since some killers need the anonymity of what the character is to succeed, so that the survivors can plan accordingly. And only give them 15 seconds or so. I think that would be at least worth trying in the test build
---
But a bad killer player playing oni wont win vs bad survivors, you need a good killer player to beat bad survivors, and an extremely good killer player to beat good survivors, and extremely good survivors? thats a gg
---
Ty
---
Man, if only I wasn't saving shards to buy the oni...
---
Does anybody know where I can watch the first Scream movie ???...its not On Netflix. Pls help
---
Ghostface=Hag&gt;&gt;&gt;Myers&gt;&gt;Wraith&gt;&gt;Pig&gt;Clown
---
I play Laurie Strode a lot, but I don’t use DS that often. I would bait the locker-DS combo so they leave me and go elsewhere. It’s worked 7/10 times lol. However, when it doesn’t work, I get a good laugh out of it.
---
And his lunge is the best, too
---
Well you virtually wasted an entire person worth of stalk then. That can be enough for you to lose the game since you will also revert back to Tier 2 afterwords and need to regain Tier 3 back which will be rather difficult since you just killed any possible reserve stalk you had.
---
I've had several games where I'm in the terror radius almost immediatly, and one where I could see the killer, facing me, as soon as the game loaded. Fortunatly THAT only happened once, but still.
---
Freddy,trapper, legion, Billy. That's for me, I can get a 4K with those three but not Billy.
---
The problem here is that you picked three A rank killers with S tier potential....
---
......and *LEGION*
---
"an homophobe" You really are a dribbling snowflake lmfao
---
3% movement speed does not justify the amount of time it takes to gain all 3 of those tokens. First, you would have time actually find the obsession which in itself can be VERY time-consuming. Then you would have to give up hitting them entirely and instead chase them. 
---
It takes a minimum of 10 seconds to start and end a chase. Then another 5 seconds between when you can gain another token. Assuming a perfect situation where you find the obsession in under 40 seconds and then get all 3 tokens you just spent, 85 seconds not pressuring 3/4 survivors. In 85 seconds baseline with no items or perks thats 3 generators before you have set your tokens up. 
---
A 3% movement speed increase does not justify that amount of time investment at all. Also, I am not trying to take every possible perk combination into play when buffing this one. I am attempting to make THIS perk would BY itself. If a perk requires 3 other perks to go alongside it to make it work then that perk needs to be worked on.
---
And now to get Deathgarden for cosmetics
---
As a PS4 DBD player, I get tons of hate messages if something slightly goes wrong for the surv. What’s that, I ran Franklin’s? Guess I’ll die.
---
Hey I made an idea for him last week lol
---
You'd think the David would've learnt
---
One, Two, Mcote is comin for you. 
---
Lol.
---
i dont miss being a PS4 main at all because of shit like that, i do miss all the characters i paid for tho
---
Don't play pig too much, but Exhaustion, Blindness, and Hindered are the three status ailments that dick survivors the most, and Huntress has access to all three of those
---
This has invoked more of a fight or flight response in me than I ever thought possible of a meatball. Thanks, Runmo
---
Hag, ghost, Myers,
---
Happened to me last night and I wasnt even in the PTB. Same numbers and everything
---
The devs are fucking evil people because I dont want to play killer is stress and pain but the queue times of survivor is so long i end playing killer
---
Did you all escape?
---
welp there goes your computer it ruin you must cleanse it
---
I’m not disagreeing that it’s not the most optimal way to play with that addon. I am saying it does still happen. And regardless of whether it’s the smartest move, it still instantly turns the game into a 3v1 which is a huge advantage for the killer.
---
I was referring to your whole post. Make all the changes you suggested, but the percents I said. It stacks endlessly, can be built up on any survivor, only drains on missed attacks, double loss/gain on your obsession.
---
Dec 3
---
the acheivement for getting out against this killer is
---
"safe at last from shia lebouf"
---
if you have him next game  however...
---
"Wait he isnt dead! Shia surprise!"
---
finally some fan art that doesn't suck
---
“Get back here blueberry bitch!”
---
You love to see it
---
Maybe you should read when this was posted. I made this way back during the PTB when they first tested the archives on PC. I searched everywhere on the internet and put this altogether back then. I even say in the beginning of my post it was during the PTB and things may change, which they did. The only reason I put this together back then because only PC players could see them. So in the context of when I posted this, it’s not inaccurate.
---
I uh... I don't know what I just watched, but thank you.
---
I completely understand stand that. It’s not like everyday you can get an easy 4K at least fairly lol. There’s some sly bastards that can clown with you well when it comes to pallets as well as gen rushing. In the end though, these guys were around 15-17 while I was just getting back into the season at around 14-13 so there wasn’t really a point to get that quick of a wipe and ruin the fun for everyone at that low of a rank. I’ll take 1 tick and a fun game over an easy wipe and little to no challenge at all.
---
On pc depending on the offense yeah, console no
---
Honestly demogorgon needs a buff, he's pretty underwhelming in my opinion.
---
when matches can be as short as 3-5 minutes 60 seconds is a very long time
---
Bro there isn't anything scarier than scratched mirror myres
---
Ha, it was a trick. No killer mains see a key and don’t bring a mori.
---
People think that becuase they did 2 gens in the time it took you to find and hook the first survivor its a genrush.
---
Turns out, when survivors have nothing to do but do gens, they tend to be able to find them quickly and hit checks through ruin.
---
Used were the Brand New Part charm and the Fog Whisperer charm, an exclusive charm only given out to selected streamers.
---
Rendered using Cinema 4D, post-processed using Adobe After Effects
---
Wait. 1 is a bug?!
---
The outfits aren't new, so that's why it's probably so slow. Gotta create a false grind in case some people already have some of the outfits.
---
Wait until november 28ht. They will all be on sale, with the exception of demogorgon
---
You ok op? Those are cows.
---
Its human patrick
---
yeah no. Doctor is way too garbage to recommend to a new player, he works because even an insidious bubba can get a 4k at low ranks but once he faces good people he will get dumpstered. Feng ill agree with, but doctor fuck no.
---
I mean lowering the values just increases the time it takes to get, it doesn't solve the underlying issue. If your .5% faster every time you end a chase then eventually you could be something like 20% faster if there was no cap on token count. That's why I kept the token cap at 3 and the movement per token at 5% for the first set of changes and 2 or 2.5 for the second set of changes.
---
When they die it shows 4 people in lobby, it's just a bug where when you spectate people it only shows who's left alive on the bottom left
---
Also, the met has tier 2 sprint burst and tier 1 self care which isnt possible in private games
---
I don’t think I’ve ever been so creeped out and so fascinated at the same time
---
On Lerys no less lol
---
But time has proven that map pressure is far more important than the potential to end chases faster, hence why billy is higher than huntress and why huntress has fallen on tier lists, especially with the way maps are being made. Spirit is an outlier because she ends chases INSANELY fast.
---
Fredfredburger as the survivor
---
Someone mixed up dying light with dead by daylight
---
Hag, Plague, Clown, Spirit and Jake got new skins
---
One round a killer slugged when it was just two of us left (it's meta, I know, I don't care anymore) so we couldn't get hatch. I was the one still standing. I saw the killer camping the slug so I just switched lockers back and forth quietly to avoid getting crows. When he was at a sliver of health left, he hooked him to die. I don't even remember if I found hatch or got caught. Anyway, I went into chat just to apologize to the slug and say I couldn't do anything to save him and he said it was okay because the killer was playing like the N word. He then used the N word about 20 more times to describe the killer. I told him I was glad I didn't risk my life for him now and apologized to the killer.
---
As Dwight main
---
First off: How dare you
---
Second: You're not wrong
---
Please not another plague.
---
For the serum yes, since everyone complained about assholes suiciding after getting their serum and the games coming to a grinding holt. BhVR doesn’t know how to make anything balanced so it’s either super easy or super hard. Then it’s either op or nerfed into the ground for balancing. 
---
They should have made it where you had to bang out gens for the serum instead of the bs 3000 points we got and also buffed that to 6000 for each gen plus serum...
---
I'd throw my money at those purple fucking charms
---
Tfw you have perfect internet but get booted from a match and derank
---
I just thought of it as a reboot. I love the actress though.
---
I like this idea. Probably biased.
---
Thats just Y2K
---
Windows actually work pretty well, it seems almost impossible for him to hit people who are vaulting when he is charging
---
And just like that, Ace was swapped out for Shaggy. Thanks for the idea!
---
There is only one true Feng Min, and it is I.
---
I was in a game like that. First time I ever even considered DCing ( was a surv ). I was so relieved when she killed me
---
I like to use this on her, but instead of dying light I use discordance. I've got messages of people calling it bullshit. Heh
---
Madness 3 can be a big nuisance. And it gets annoying having to do it every time someone gets unhooked. It'd feel cheap I imagine. I think if you  at least raise token levels from 1/2/3 to 1/3/5 if you want it every unhook to trigger it might be a bit more bearable.
---
Speaking of usernames, wtf is yours???
---
I wouldn't really call that body blocking. The only reason it worked out so well is because trapper hit the saved survs instead of bill. Just bad play from him.
---
If they went to the wall like most survivors do they'd get an additional couple BP and waste your time kicking them out.
---
I wouldn't encourage t-bagging perse but it's definitely the time savvy move to sit around at exit gates a bit longer, especially if you're running wglf and can sneak in an extra protection hit or before game end.
---
yes he's a cutie.
---
Make another perk for that. I use M&amp;B on alot of killers to get closer before they run.
---
Shitty rank system because people can cruise to high rank.... but you suggest a system where you can ‘easily jump to a way higher rank’? Ok. You aren’t making any sense.
---
The actors were all good and played their parts the best they could I just found it weird how she was okay with her friends being brutally murdered by Leatherface 😂
---
It's almost as if constantly exposing somebody to something causes them to adapt.
---
i mean its annoying but hardly reportable, with the new Archive challenge its practically required Atm
---
i’d buy bhvr just to make that possible, i really wish they would add recolors
---
Can we see Claudette’s POV?
---
This is staggeringly accurate for those toxic swf groups. I followed the flowchart for a game I just had and it checked out perfect lmao
---
I like the suggestion of take longer for the survivors bar to drain.
---
It definitely shouldn’t be deleted because people want to play with their friends. But there does need to be some kind of substantial nerf to it somehow. Going against a coordinated team can be insanely difficult.
---
I waseani g survivors
---
Fair enough. I can agree on that.
---
If I google the meaning of holding hostage outside of criminal stuff it just says " one that is involuntarily controlled by an outside influence " which comes down to me having basically no controll over the entire situation and was at the mercy of nea and pig. That's how I see hostage situations. If behaviour formules it as in just body blocking I guess you're right. I also had a friend who was the last one alive when EGC wasn't a thing, the hatch didnt spawn and the killer didnt attack him at all and only grabbed him off a gen when he touched one, kick it, picked him back up and let him wiggle out only to grab him again upon touching a generator. Because thats not body blocking but thats definetly holding a game hostage too in my eyes.
---
So once again. You say I am in the wrong, I cant deny that I guess. I just wanna know what you think I should have done. DC when I noticed nea was waiting on me to die? Doing 3 generators by myself while the killer is only ever chasing me seems like a lot of work. I'd probably still be in that game by now if I was doing that. I could let the killer catch me for free and get out of the match that way. But in any of these situations I'm just giving the hatch to someone who's waiting on me to die which just feel shitty. It just feels like no matter what I do it's always going to be bad either for me or for the other players. I wish there was just a timer that ended the game upon a certain time.
---
Billy has insta down capabilities, and has whole map pressure and can get across the map very quick whenever he wants.
---
Well her friends were kinda shitty. Cheating and everything. Plus Leatherface is Family.
---
Ah yes because good perks mean you deserve to lose. The only perk I can see you complaining about is no ed
---
They weren't the sole developers, but they *did* copy and paste it for the official Westworld tie-in game. It was an open and shut case because Bethesda was able to identify a bug in Westworld that existed in one of the earlier versions of Fallout Shelter.
---
Which all adds up to the most BHVR story ever.
---
The problem is, as a survivor there is nothing else to do. I really enjoyed last year during the Halloween event we had to suck those plants dry. It gave survivor another task to complete. Ruin doesn’t even do much, ive gone up against it so much I rarely miss a great. I just wish they’d add something else to do as survivor.
---
Clown is good easy chases and he can stop people from far away with bottles. Wraith has good map pressure as well. Myers isn't good... His perks are useful but as a killer not good.
---
&gt; and have anti-bleeding perks actually counter his power. No Mither, Lucky Break, and Babysitter are the only 3 perks that have this trait, 2 of which are temporary and the other has it's obvious downsides as well.
---
this is where im at. 100%
---
You can just use Play With Your Food. Ive been playing lots of no Hex: Ruin games and PWYF has gotten me some easy wins its amazing for Wraith and good for Bubba and Plague. You can go 130% speed and its like the perk you describe but better since you earn it and its not a gimme that can be abused infinitely by moonwalking to avoid chases.
---
Nurse, spirit, and Billy can easily put gen pressure on the survivors. Billy can check on multiple gens in a single run if you use him right, and his chainsaw rush doesn't have a major cool down.  Freddy can teleport to gens on the map, or even pretend to teleport to play head games with survivors and cause them to slow down gen progression.
---
My favorites are Myers, Freddy, and Ghostface. I do really well  
---
 with Freddy and can do good with Michael, but Ghostface is really hard to play especially at higher tiers, but that doesn't stop me from playing him
---
pm directions to make this please lol
---
People who can't play the game without ruin are bad lol
---
Well Bill very easily could have just run up the stairs and saved his own ass too. But yeah, the really good play here was from Nea and Trapper could have played that much better. At the least he should have been able to keep one in the basement.
---
*Runs right into the locker then Killer just sits there*
---
WTF why isn’t he opening the locker? 😰
---
Underrated comment
---
Yes. Exactly right. I think it’s broken as fuck.
---
Tenacity is good and funny to use, and can combine good with something like flipflop or unbreakable, hunch is good for dealing with noed or other hex’s, but I don’t know about the pigs perks
---
I have all DLC. Get all DLC. GET IT! DO IT!
---
Jacket? you mean Sweater?
---
It's not a player issue, it's the dedicated servers ruining it.
---
Why do people say op
---
I’m poor
---
Keys and Mori’s should be reworked together.
---
Pig is my favorite killer. Tapp is fun to play as well
---
Then he says something like "I let you win!"
---
How dose she play, and what’s the best way to play with her
---
Whats your build son
---
Idk they seemed pretty new
---
Just make it an April fools head for all killers
---
Ambient noise while you're cooking or cleaning.
---
Yeah and I’ve gotten dumpstered before to where I think the end screen should’ve said “really dude?” but I’ve never had one knock out 3+ gems with my ruin all in one chase
---
Wait until Black Friday most of the dlc's will be much cheaper.
---
I'd definietly suggest The Nightmare chapter and The Holloween chapter.
---
Not harsh! I definitely enjoy the feedback.
---
When you’ve faced ruin almost every game for a few years you adapt to it. It’s pretty ineffective against people who play this regularly. Also, it getting found within 10 seconds when playing killer is a real kick in the dick.
---
**RKO**
---
You can hit hard and unexpected
---
When a hooked Survivor is rescrued 8/12/16 meters from you, the unhooker is exposed for 30 seconds, and you can kill that Survivor.
---
This Perk deactivates after being triggered
---
Can't you just hear the tree when you're in range? It's not like a crow bomb, the killer will hear it whenever they're near it, it doesn't need a survivor there.
---
Both still work, right? Even being exhausted you can use adrenalin?
---
Honestly any common or greater tool box with a brand new part  and socket swirls is extremely fast. Against swf it's pretty much every game as a high rank killer. Even at base speed of 80 seconds that means three gens could be done by the time you have hooked one person. This is why ruin is so mandatory as a killer at high ranks.
---
I like to keep traps on after the first hook, she is good for creeping on survivors but to avoid being spotted by that perk survivors use to know the killer is looking at them. To avoid that perk I don't stare at the gen while on my way to it but I will glance every now and then. I walk backwards. 
---
Then instead of using her lunge attack I come out of crouched and grab or hit the survivor. If they don't  think you are coming then you will get them off guard. 
---
Use traps to slow the game down.
---
Goooood goood!Let the hate flow through you!
---
She's the blueberry bitch
---
6 minute genrush? Are you dumb?
---
And you have have to EARN that insta down.... unlike Billy
---
Combat Straps and Video Tape/John's Medical File is always the go to, as it means you can use your ambush as a tool in chases much more effectively, and are more likely to get stealth hits too.
---
Jigsaw's Sketch + Tampered Timer if you feel like popping some heads.
---
Jigsaw's Annotated Plan/Sketch + Crate of Gears if you want to burn a little more time with each trap.
---
Count yourself lucky. And to be clear I don't blame  a team for playing optimally.
---
I unironically miss that, I knew people were mad, but mostly joking around. If you browse by new and see some of the salt chat, there is some truly inhumane and disgusting comments now at days.
---
Scream 1, and it's Wes Craven wearing the outfit too.
---
Who's vigil?
---
It's not ineffective at all, that's why a large majority of killers run it at red ranks. Like I said unless you hit great skill checks every single time then there is gonna be a 5% regression most times there is a skill check. Even if you are able to hit a great every time then not all of your team will be able to. The amount it slows down the game overall as a team is why it's so valued.
---
Yes it gets cleansed quickly but some killers can defend it and better to have it for 2 minutes then not at all. The time a survivor takes to find and cleanse is still valuable to the killer.
---
And yeah sometimes it does get found in 10 seconds and that sucks but most games you get some value out of it.
---
Two legions.
---
Yeah.... Trapper is my fav.... even if I get massacred. But Freddy is my go to Rank climber
---
Ruin is a necessity at red ranks tho
---
Every time you put out the candle loud thunder will wake up your entire neighborhood.
---
Quit playing fair. Do what you have to do to win. If it means camping against an overly altruistic team do it.
---
Idk about strongest duo, but for memeworthy duo maybe trapper and hag?
---
Wtf
---
Please, I'd RATHER die right away than play like a piece of shit.
---
What a surprise.
---
Well yeah he deserved it. I dont think he knows much other than hes in a gate
---
No because on killers like ghost face night shroud prevents chase. This will just create a stupidly fast killer for first hits. Not like he needs any help with that.
---
People usually do that anyway unless they really want someone out of the game so I don’t personally think that’d be major but maybe it could be a good change
---
What are you supposed to do as a survivor then? I am seriously questioning if you have a mental disorder or not
---
The fact that Trapper decided to hit the second survivor after knowing the first got BT made me largely exhale.
---
I check them a lot because it sounds like Whispers activated
---
Those people are already deranking, though. All they'd do is jack up their queue times if they used the blacklist instead.
---
Still wrong, Jake got a skin
---
Doc main and while Doctor definitely isn't meta if you start snowballing you can't lose. Doctors can cut loops off really well once you learn him. Might be the hardest killer in the game with Nurse to learn imo
---
Welcome to Killer this is your life now.
---
"Karma's a bitch" at it's finest...
---
The Virgin pasted artwork vs. The Chad template edit
---
Gotta use the phantom of the opera skin. Thats all i do.
---
Back in my day, this was done with Borrowed Time, and it was still annoying!
---
Yeah man I'm going to. After being called a tunneler on here, clearly saying that I wasn't tunneling and getting down voted for it, it's pretty clear to me that it really doesn't matter how you play the game, people are still gonna complain.
---
 No more taking pity on survivors who have someone disconnect or are simply bad, no more ignoring moris in my blood webs, no more leaving the hook and not returning from the edge of my terror radius etc.. etc.. 
---
At least that's what the toxicity spreading through the community should make me do but nah I'm gonna keep playing fair and take the losses (unless I know beforehand the team are toxic) because that's the only way to stop the toxicity man. And this may sound very dramatic but I'm high as f\*ck right now.
---
It's hilarious that I can never tell if it'll be a survivor or killer this time complaining about this map claiming it's favored for the other side
---
Real Talk with Bosshogg
---
E
---
Same with Evolve. That game was great.
---
Spirit is so thinn though. Couldn't find clothing in a size -3 bedsides her schoolgirl uniform.
---
This is cool. Nice work.
---
self-care is such a waste of time; the killer can do so much and apply so much pressure in that time, which could be detrimental. inner strength encourages totem cleansing (food counter to NOED!!) and is so much quicker. inner strength GOOD, self care BAD
---
Dont use self care, it just wastes your time and you end up leaving your team vulnerable. Under certain circumstances Selfcare can take around 40+ seconds to fully heal. Thats literally half a generators progress that isnt being done and that time adds up. Go for Inner Strength instead. Not only are you taking care of the side objective by getting rid of totems but you also are still saving at least 10 seconds off instead of the full time it takes to self care.
---
Him and Meyers in my opinion
---
Is, is her jaw splitting open, or I'm I just seeing things?
---
Didn’t you see the lag spike
---
This made me laugh too hard at 11pm
---
I'm aware it's a waste of time, I listed the reasons for each one
---
Hmm, got it. Thanks for your opinion on this!
---
For Pig: Video Tape and Last Will, Bag of Gears and Annotated Plan, Combat Straps and Video Tape, Slow Release Toxin and Bag of Gears/Annotated Plan
---
For Huntress: Yew Seed (either), Mana Grass Braid, Deerskin Gloves (especially with Iron Maiden, Venomous Concoction, Flower Babushka. 
---
Huntress you can mix and match and even one's I didn't list are decent. Pig I gave specific combos because half her add ons are garbage or detrimental to her
---
Amazing
---
He stabs you just the same as he does with a knife.....just with a pipe
---
you actually said nothing about self-care except that it was the best of three? didn’t explain it at all??
---
Hex: Bass Drop
---
I have high hopes after they brought freddy back from the dead.
---
Ruin (self explanatory, best slowdown in the game...), BBQ (bloodpoints and aura reading, doesn't work in your power so look before going in), Rancor (when gens pop, you see anyone like they screamed even in power and lets you mori the obsession and one shot them), Make Your Choice (hook, run away, come back in power and hit unhooker). Use it with movement speed addons (not mother-daughter) and charge speed, like bloody hair brooch and the sandals or whatever as addons. Don't get used to using stridor as it lets you hear them closer than they actually are and fucks you over more than anything
---
Who stalks as ghostface? That's not optimal.
---
That's easy. 
---
"Pretty good job so far"
---
You... Kinda contradicted yourself. He already has no problem getting grabs/first hits. Also, the rule of not working on powers could be applied to him as well
---
Reddit has no relation and will not teach BHVR, you know that right?
---
but his halloween one is just so cool
---
Because
---
1. You get survival points.
---
2. You get skillcheck points &amp; can make it faster with great skillchecks.
---
3. You don't have to search for a totem that someone could've already dismantled.
---
4. A totem is 15 seconds and the inner strength is 8 so that's 23 seconds to heal and you have to find a totem, self care doesn't require that.
---
I agree with you, but I dont think that a perk is bad because its not as usable as ruin. Every single killer can use ruin, but what about a perk only for stealthy killers?? This is a situational perk, but its not a bad perk.
---
Verify game files. If that doesnt work, uninstall and reinstall.

I see you like the onis, thick, massive, kanabo.

Try to hide or get away

Was this on xbox cause i did exactly this to a nancy and it was hilarious

Whats that??

Why are his feet like a child's size 12 tho

Tru. But the feet. I ain't no foot fetishier.

Burn the witch!

-Survivor mains.
---
Plague+anything but legion.
---
That is an absolutely terrible analogy for video games my guy
---
It should, but I am skeptical about that graphics card. Like in theory it should be okay, but I myself am unfamiliar with AMD products recently. Game-debate says it should run. And google said that graphics card is very slightly better than the desktop version of the Gtx 1050. Thats all I know. Seems expensove for this game tho
---
Many people take regular breaks from the game, some times are more grind than others. If we could do all challenges straight away battle pass is over and no need to play as much till next.
---
I’m pretty sure rocks don’t go through walls.
---
You forgot the “Unknown Error” message too. Happens so often on PS4. Just kicks me back to the main menu.
---
What's the full video of this
---
You don’t have to be in 3 different chases. Simply look at the ground while following the scratch marks to “lose chase” or run toward them while looking away to get 3 tokens in one chase.
---
She never saw it coming
---
Bricky on YT is a Doctor main, but he still plays all killers.
---
Injured survivors also give a Than stack
---
i agree with this 100%
---
Definitely missing "reported you hacker" when killer does well.
---
The one with the hat and black dreaa
---
Yeah, these undedicated servers are killing survs more often now.
---
r/DBDGoneGay
---
This is truly a work of art. Also survivor main. Win with dignity!
---
alright, thank you! i've never actually had a gaming pc before so this really helped
---
They also look cool with the blight skins, cos you just see the black with the orangey glow
---
I searched him up, he barely even uses his power wtf?
---
Not enough Russian
---
Dedicated Red Rank Trappers are some scurry shit, same with Billy. The Billy's who build M1 and use chainsaw for mobility/map pressure instead of a onetap have the same energy as the Ghostface's who stealth for pallet mind games instead of the stalk, and that's meta Ghostface atm. There are really only three to four killers I would say are genuinely unplayable below rank 10, and Legion is one of them. The other three killers here are still damn good at red/purple ranks in the right hands
---
*This killer took a pic of himself every day and this happened.... *(not click bait)
---
There is a perk that slows the timer down already. 
---
Your opponent is not responsible for your fun. Stop trying to dictate how others play the game.
---
I respect killers that just down the person farmed off the hook.  It's understandable -- Not only is it more pressure on the survivors, but you also just said "Fuck your bloodpoints" to the person that farmed.  And I like that.  I like that a lot.
---
Devs gonna give it you yea, wait on your own devs gonna deliver it to yea.
---
freddy, billy , trapper and then legion
---
idk if you're referencing the movie but that's what I got too
---
Noone tell him lampkin lane exists.
---
Billy: Are you challenging me?
---
It's clear you never played it. Sad.
---
Billy, Freddy, and after them is Trapper and lastly, Legion.
---
It got him many 1 shot downs, trur1l3nt can lick some balls he had 4... 5 second chases... certainly better then 2 shot chases lasting 1-3 minutes each
---
\*Left for dead 2 flashback intensifies\*
---
The only spots I think are mega dirty are the ones where the traps clips into the ground and makes them literally unseeable. But before we do anything about those start with 2 traps and ground reset button theenks.
---
I've recently gotten a bit better at playing survivor and I'll do toxic things like t bag and flashlight spam but only when the killer isnt near me. 
---
I once looped a trapper around an infinite pallet not window. Ya know the corn maps where to stop it you just need to break the pallets. 
---
I ended up running him around for 3 gens and in feeling bad I turned around and dropped my item he had NOED and decided to send me a message after the game going "Did you have fun getting facecamped?" Followed by "That's what getting looped feels like" 
---
And I was like my man just break the pallet that would've ended much sooner. And he's like nah you have to make me. Wack af guy
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e0ty3w/hacking_or_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Only clense in the end game collapse or if your teammates are throwing and also clensing

The game is literally balanced around looping but okay

Grab a brush put a little make up

Coming back to give a quick update. While in no way hard answer to whats occurring, a BHvR Dev did say something about it on their forum.

---
It should be noted that Almo is on the balance designer team and not the Rover team responsible for the experiment. So..... Yeah.
---
Don’t cleanse
---
I am proud of the devs. They've come so far.
---
But be careful. Saying positive things about them gets you labelled as a "white knight".
---
Yeah, that's what makes a fun game. Sitting their on a hook doing absolutely nothing for the entire match. Yep. Definitely what the people want.
---
Shorter chases are better, as they give you more points (in terms of pipping) and it puts pressure on them. Haveing 1-3 minute chases is a huge time loss and in that time they are able to finish 3 different generators.
---
You're right, the devs are. Which is why they need to punish facecampers. To make the game fun for everyone.
---
1. You probably never had dysphoria so you have no idea how it feels, it's more than just not being able to accept your birth gender. 2. As someone else said, only a small minority of trans people call people transphobic for not wanting to fuck them. 3. The only trans ideology I can think of is just them wanting society to stop hating them for existing. 4. You have no reason to hate on a group of people for just trying to live happily when majority of them aren't harming people, they're the ones getting harmed.
---
Literally a bug, they are moving and no one is in front of them dumbass
---
Me: Having an excellent start on my first gen with another player
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Game: Hol Up
---
Game: Freezes
---
Me: Getting 2 very fast skill checks that i fail after my game unfreezes making my teammate hate me
---
Or grief the streamer, that way no one is happy.
---
&gt;Oni and billy are at the same level because oni needs to charge his ability, however when oni has his power there is little to no counterplay on the survivor side during chases
---
You mean, other than simply hiding?
---
Which is easy?
---
I can’t stop watching
---
The only people who wants to nerf ruin and noed are the rank 20 and I say fuck that guys they kill my boy freddy for over a year for no reason
---
Yeah
---
I had a cluadette just today trying to Tea-Bag me with a Nea at the exit gate. However. I was Plague, and they were full sickness. I turn the corner knowing they are waiting and hit Claudette with a corrupt purge, sadly missed Nea but got to sac Claudette.
---
How?
---
Man stop being a busta!
---
The other day I had a match against a Trapper and a Kate got unhooked and the Killer came. Kate jumps in a locker and the Trapper just put a trap in front of it and left.
---
I got hooked near the locker and got to watch crows spawn around it.
---
As a killer man this makes me so happy to see thank you for this I’m so tired of having games where the survivors just sit at the open exit gate and just teabag for no damn reason at all
---
Double standards are great, right
---
You do you. I'm gonna keep playing how I want to play and bathe in the tears. Survivors will always have their excuses. Win or loss.
---
What?
---
Twitch is actually pathetic.
---
I think they mean "extra penalty" in the sense that they'll have to heal the Survivor from the slugged state, which will take more time.
---
Fast enough as is. Do you honestly think gens need to be done faster? That is not something any serious player of this game will support.
---
If the game gets fixed and killers don't NEED to run ruin, then we will stop running it in favor of more useful perks. You think we like to waste a slot on a hex that might get destroyed in 15 seconds into the match just so the game becomes manageable?
---
Why is this a thing 😂
---
He's very photogenic
---
Nobody uses noed nowadays anyway
---
I’ve had a handful of matches in 2k+ hrs where I’ve spawned and been in the terror radius after taking a few steps. If it’s so game changing for you just hide in a locker until they’ve checked your area.
---
Ruin is fine but NOED needs a nerf. It's literally a perk that punishes Survivors for doing their objective during the trial while the killer gets rewarded for playing badly.
---
Sure, NOED is easily counterable by Survivors by just looking for the totem but still, the point still stands that NOED needs a nerf.
---
No hes just so badass he learned to scream and grunt through his mind instead of his mouth.
---
I agree maybe just push gens to take a itty bit longer and nerf ruin a bit
---
I find hes especially susceptible to a quick 180 turn. As hes running towards you, spin around and start running at him. Often the killer will not have enough time to react to the sudden change and will now be forced to deactivate the charge, turn around and chase after you
---
Pretty much. If they address gen speeds they could rework the perk or take it out all together for all i care.
---
I dont know too much about stranger things. But if the demogorgon is basically a pawn for a higher entity then yes it does seem similar. So if thats the case then I dont think they would have a problem with lore/reasoning behind it if they did that to the demogorgon. So nvm on that, but all in all this is about a speculation
---
I really don't know either. Its not like there's a bp economy, or the devs would lose money/we can buy bp so it really doesn't make any sense. I'm saving bp to level up my oni, but 1 million is not enough to get the perks I want (probably)
---
Brand new parts already make them go faster
---
This is a kudos to the team, not just the Bill. Also the killer could have easily waited out DS, so luck, too.
---
Doesn’t the steam store have the requirements to run the game or am I mistaken?
---
Dont forget that as I said only newer killers (except the ones that just want the salt) face camp truly. A kill's a kill, why would you not confirm it if you don't know any better? Punishing newer players for something they wouldn't know is punishable is just fucking awful
---
i haven't looked yet because my laptop has been annoying with opening steam in the past couple days, but i got an answer and im pretty sure i'll be okay!
---
They once wanted to try to make licenses dlc lore friendly but i think they've dropped that to be honest
---
Let it rot like the crap it was.
---
how many shards can you fill in a glass anyway? asking for a killer
---
I am a Ghostface main, and I approve this message!
---
What Type of dumbass uses noed on a killer that can already make anyone exposed
---
Oh.
---
BruhDespasito
---
So many monsters to choose from. But I think the black knight, captain cutler, the space kook or the phantom shadow would be good candidates
---
Like the barn entrance
---
my console is up to date and how do i restart the system
---
So A. Your on a map and in a corner map location where the survivor is unlikely to look at... you 1. Approach, get noticed and maybe get a hit...
---
Or 2. Stalk, approach, expose down.
---
Situations is situation but you get the same value from stalking stealth wise... and better chase times most of the time...
---
1 shot chase&gt;2 shot m1 chase.
---
Doesnt matte that ghostface isnt particularly strong... mid tier myers at best.
---
Shit, somebody's still playing Legion! READY THE NERF GUN!
---
Oh, hey, 36 signatures. Now that you got the entire DG playerbase to sign, what's the next step?
---
The build up is 100% based on the survivors ability to not get hit/escape and heal
---
Dont be acting like he just gets it for free
---
Hold the button that you usually use to put the console into sleep mode for 5 seconds.
---
The homophobic movement that had a gay man head their parade? Or are you arguing that the movement is inherently homophobic because proponents of white pride are racist? That just comes off as a false equivalency. I personally believe that taking pride in something as trivial as race or sex is ridiculous. However, if you're going to have sexual pride flags might as well include everyone. Don't be a bigot and accept others.
---
If you play on Xbox, I hope we meet sometime, you beautiful soul.
---
I disagree.  Doing gens is more than doing them quickly.  It's about knowing when to stack on gens and when to split up.  It's about taking risks to get the gen next to a generator complete done.  It's being able to identify what perks the killer is running to know whether or not you need to break the non-hex totems for ruin.  The game isn't just the chases, it's a strategy game as well.  A lot of the time the survivor that wins the game is not one that is ever seen by the killer.
---
Weird how the ability UI isn't always in the same place
---
Don't get me wrong getting better is always helpful but unless you're someone like spirit then there's only so good you can get. I just quit playing cause when I was the only viable killers at high ranks that had a decent chance to 4k every game was spirit and nurse (this was before nurse nerf and I think spirit nerfs so idk who the S tier ones are now)
---
The shaggy cosmetic
---
It bothers me sometimes
---
Yeah I agree man, they are gonna b*tch either way so play how you want
---
Was it? didn't know i started playing before the Stranger things DLC
---
Why did you make me read this actual garbage?
---
That's true, I mean it's much easier for killers to find gens though but yeah survivors tend to spawn right next to them. They can also spawn on top of ruin though lol
---
Thanks!
---
Pretty sure that if you put it just right, you can hit the survivor on the other side
---
Swf, plus you were within 6 ranks, this is working how its intended so I don't know why you posted this
---
Welcome to Dead By Daylight.

When theyre arent streaming

Any 4 man and he would be the worst killet in the game

What are you smoking, I need some.

BRUTAL KILLER
---
Killer: The Hunter
---
Note: Upon unlocking the killer they’d look sort of generic. Like they were some unnamed nobody of a hunter in death garden, with a standard mask and metallic suit worn by hunters. Cosmetic options could include the other hunters, and even better outfits for the nobody.
---
Description: A creature from a far away place, where or even when that is unknown to all besides themselves. Though it is certain that they don’t belong here, they’re not like the other monsters used to take care of the common filth running among these disturbed woods. They’re better, more civilized, or perhaps they aren’t. Perhaps the voices smashing inside their head should be sign of their imperfection? No, those voices belong to those of the most elite, fellow hunters. It is unknown how these voices got inside their head, but while they’re in there they might as well share their secrets and revel in the hunt.
---
Backstory: The hunter stood watch in guard of those inside the building, they knew that a plan was being made. This plan was to settle the dispute amongst the residents of The Enclave once and for all. The games, the death gardens, they were flawed. Even if they were used for the enjoyment of those of higher class, it still allowed the filth inside. The hunter couldn’t stand the filth, they run and steal, they’re no better than rats and yet the games provided them with a ticket to salvation.
---
The hunter watched as two children walked across from them, they noticed the difference in wealth just by sight. One wore pristine clothing and looked well maintained, she appeared to be a proper future citizen, while the other was dirty and covered in scrapes, he looked like gutter trash. Yet they laughed together, they saw no difference. Maybe there was little difference between the two, maybe the boy had a chance to become like the rest. Or maybe the girl was a fool.
---
As the hunter glared at the boy, the door behind them opened and out walked the many members who ran the bloodharvests. They announced that the trials would continue, and those opposed would be sent back to ruins. The hunter smiled, though it be hidden under their mask they knew the menacing aura from their joy at the thought of spilling more of the filths blood within the gardens was noticeable by those close by. It’s hard to mask ones intense desires. With the good news fresh in mind, the hunter traveled back to the garden. They stepped inside a waiting room, where the other hunters were preparing for their trials. They too were eager to go back to what they did best. 
---
That was until a fire broke out within the building, and the hunters trapped inside. Those who had families out in the ruins, the ones who made it within The Enclave, they were rioting. They had trapped the beasts inside their den and set ablaze, no more trials if the hunters were no more. The hunters screamed as their flesh burned, but one did not scream. They looked onward towards the garden below, saddened it seemed. The garden would go hungry today.
---
Power: Battle Suit
---
A suit made by those who ran the bloodharvests, though it had long since run out of power to run. It appeared as though something else was powering it, something far greater than before.
---
Primary: No Way to Hide
---
You can let out a medium ranged scan to allow you to locate your prey. Once scanned the survivor’s auras are revealed for 15 seconds and they suffer the oblivious effect.
---
Cooldown time 30 seconds. Scan range 32 meters.
---
Secondary: Shock
---
You let out a short ranged electronic burst which shocks and slows survivors around you. Once shocked the survivors are slowed for 3 seconds.
---
Cooldown 15 seconds. Shock range 8 meters around the killer. Can be used even if charge is only half full.
---
Using either of the abilities when the cooldown bar is full will send the bar back down into cooldown. With the primary taking full while the secondary taking only half or all if chose to be activated twice.
---
Bonus: Upon 3 generators being completed a random golden crate will appear within the trial, collecting this box will make your cooldown significantly less when using No Way to Hide and allow your shock ability to be used indefinitely. Lasts 60 seconds.
---
Perks: 
---
Stealer: 
---
Upon downing a survivor gain a token. Every token gained grants you 250/500/1000 more blood points in your lowest category. If all categories are full your gain 1500/ 2500/5000 more blood points at the end of the trial. 
---
Maximum of 5 tokens. 
---
Note* Doesn’t actually steal bp from downed survs...
---
"Well, if they were worthy, they wouldn't have been downed, so they don't deserve them anyway." 
---
So Close: 
---
Upon grabbing a survivor from a gen, all other survivors suffer from the exposed effect for 60 seconds.
---
This perk has a cooldown of of 120/90/60 seconds.
---
"Everyone likes a good story, like a Scavenger getting just within reach of a Blood Bank before being downed. It's dramatic, and I've been told it's popular. If you manage something like that, I'll make sure the system rewards you."
---
Hey Down There: 
---
Upon downing a survivor, their bleed out bar is quickened by 5%.
---
Healing downed survivors takes 15/20/25% longer.
---
“Make the most of it and finish them off."
---
Don't listen to these guys! Cleanse! Cleanse everytime you get infected!
---
Survivor: Scavenger
---
Note: This is sort of like survivor version of legion, basically the same person but they you can unlock outfits which are the other scavengers. The original would be a generic looking scavenger who similar to the killer you could possibly end up kitting out with some cool stuff.
---
Description: I’m unsure how they got here, or where they came from. Though their athletic capabilities are something to behold, perhaps the entity has made a mistake bringing them here. I wish them luck, may they find some form of salvation in this prison.
---
Backstory: The scavenger listened as the others rambled about the plan. They had figured out that the blood harvest would be taken into reconsideration, but they knew very well that it wouldn’t go away. No, they would go in, laugh it over and come out to the world with some excuse as to why it was needed. So they had prepared a contingency plan. 
---
They had begun rallying up supporters within the enclave and in the ruins. If it was decided the trials would stay, they’d riot. It was simple, but destructive. It would show them that they won’t be able to hold us down forever, that eventually we’ll be able to fight back. It wasn’t full proof, but it was all they could do.
---
Patiently they waited for the reveal, prepared for the worse and even things worse than that. Finally it was announced, an old voice slowly told of their futures. The blood harvests would continue. That was it, a match, a single sentence to set off the explosion. The scavenger alongside his companions, went out to the streets to wreak havoc on those eager to wrong them. 
---
Though while the others marched onwards, the scavenger had another plan. The trials couldn’t possibly continue if all the hunters were left unable to perform. So with that they snuck off towards the heavily guarded sanctum of the hunters, slipping past those who stood watch. They were simple guards, nothing like the mechanical beasts within the building.
---
The scavenger crept around until they had found exactly what they wanted, the hunters outside of their suits. They were so fragile now, they were just other people, but they knew what the hunters truly were. They were monsters disguised as people, seeking thrills through the deaths of others. Without a moment of hesitation, they tossed a bottle filled with gasoline into the room and lit the flame. 
---
It didn’t take long for the building to go up in smoke, though it still stood, the hunters inside were barely recognizable. The ones who did survive had received brutal wounds that would take them out of the game for some time, and even then they wouldn’t ever be the same. The scavenger, satisified with their work, walked back towards where the others were to meet. On their way they felt droswy, finding it harder and harder to keep their eyes open. Eventually they collapsed to the ground.
---
When they awoke, they were somewhere new. Perhaps a new garden? No, it was different. They were used to being watched, but this felt off. Like something beyond them was now pulling the strings, something they couldn’t solve with a basic molotov. Despite this though, whatever brought them here had made one fatal flaw. It had brought more than one of the scavengers.
---
Heat of the Moment: 
---
When your aura is revealed gain a speed increase of 3/4/5%.
---

---
When within a 6 meter range of another survivor. Recover from exhaustion 5/10/15% faster.
---
“You've seen pictures of the past? Huge herds of cattle, keeping each other going through long journeys and despite attacks by hunting predators? You see where I'm going with this?”
---

---
I forgot what it was called but plague's perk that blocks gens for 2 minutes should block any hex totems for 2 mintues too. Would this be fair?
---
Removed for name shaming
---
Cool and then what? He loses his power when he picks them up
---
No mither, unbreakable, tenacity 
---
He is so easy to counter its ridiculous
---
The only reason his duration is so long is because as soon as a survivor gets to a window he has to go completely out of his way to loop it without just ending his power and becoming a M1 killer
---
Billy can do what he does but way faster and with next to no downside
---
Aw but I like seeing peoples prestige :(
---
NOED punishes survivors for failing to do their objective
---
Am Billy main can confirm
---
I would pay for Adaris Addams
---
Lmfaooo is it a baby pig cause they can just climb down to ya part 😂😂.
---
He could still do things even if the SWF knows he's the werewolf. He can still regress gens/totems, throw pallets, collect survivor's scents.
---
Its unfair to generalise but it certainly has its basis, ive met some amazing people by stopping by their channel, wheras im about to fuck one right now because in the past hes been a complete an utter asshole
---
I wish, but I play on the other console. You can always message me on here if you’d like :)
---
What rank are you? This sounds great for 15+, horrible for &lt; 5.
---
The problem is anti camping mechanics are *really* easy to abuse at high levels of play. There are a lot of chases that get done near hooks and the only reason these have any pressure is due to the timer.
---
They are downvoting you because they got checkmated :(
---
Would love these as skins, I know its just an oddly placed shadow but I want it so much.
---
True...........
---
He was rank 8 and had perks from other killers that haven’t shown up in the shrine so idk what he’s doing
---
That calls for a rrrreeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEE
---
Get gud baby killer ree
---
Yes solo survivor sucks lol. You on ps4, xbox or pc?
---
Thanks, and have fun!
---
true
---
:)
---
Until the elf outfit releases
---
To join our usernames together
---
You have talent my friend, very good
---
I've used deliverance and had people follow me around. They usually clue in after a few seconds.
---
Yeah, For Honor does this when they release new heroes. It's cool!
---
No
---
Legion : “They’re all gonna pay!”
---
Ohh lmao that was clever.
---
*Some say that that Kate still haven't left that locker...*
---
Leaving the game so you don't have to wake up
---
I've been paying attention to gameplay of the PTB (as I'm a console pleb and can't try for myself) and if we're faking it to a vote, I don't think Oni needs a nerf, but his kit does need some small tweaking down in power. I have some suggestions for this **(Disclaimer; I am a killer main)**:
---
Blood Orbs are instantly visible through walls when near them, but I've seen some Onis use them to track a survivor who is just on the other side of a wall, like a discount aura reading ability, to land downs. Why not make blood orb auras only show after ~10 seconds to make this impossible? The orbs are already excellent for tracking.
---
Scratch Marks: Oni's charge is extremely powerful, and blood orbs help you track down injured survivors already. But you *really* want to find healthy survivors. While in Blood Rage, it would be reasonable to make Oni unable to see scratch marks in the same way Legion does. This would encourage Onis to use more perk slots for tracking abilities, which could bring down his overall power level without completely ruining him.
---
Pallet smashing: Oni instantly destroys any pallets with his Power's attacks faster than any other killer can with their own Power's attacks (Demogorgon, Leatherface, Hillbilly, etc have a slight animation). I've seen him cut down chases with no possibly for counterplay by the survivor this way. Why not make the Oni's Pallet Destruction animation take the same amount (or near the same amount of time) as other killers? Sure, his ability is on a timer, so maybe destroying pallets pauses that or could even refill his rage by a couple seconds, but pallets should have some impact on the chase.
---
Flicking Demon Sprint: This is a skillcap that separates good Oni players from bad ones, so changing it could hurt people's motivation to play him. I don't know what an appropriate change to this would be, but being able to spin 180-degrees after a sprint feels too strong.
---
Uhh, idk if you know chief but uhh, this is already in the game
---
Lol you’re welcome.  I’ve been reduced to Shakespeare quotes in dbd.

---
Those are all technically different chases, regardless, the math still stands. In order to get 3 tokens and find your obsession on average, it takes 85 seconds. 85 seconds is the equivalent of 3 generators for a temporary 15% movement speed buff. That time investment to time payoff of the perk just doesn't work out in your favor as killer on live atm.
---
As it stands your better off not using the perk at all and you will be ahead in time , that is fundamentally a flawed perk. Thats why I suggested the changes to it, to make it actually balanced.
---
Sometimes it’s necessary to make the game fair. But it is annoying cause some people want to nerf everything just because they don’t win every single game.
---
Name 1 perk ONLY stealthy killers can take advantage of?
---
idk if this breaks a rule but if i die then i die
---
Just like the way to play around prayer beads that some people scream in a crown. I don't understand the mindset behind those that defend an obvious mechanic that needs to be reworked/nerfed. Literally holding the game back by the balls because the players that exploit it jump on the bandwagon and use that false statement as a defense
---
i saw you flexing this on the dbd discord lmao
---
I’ve played 3 nurses since update on Xbox. I used to see a lot more but I think it’s because there are more fun killers that are easier to play like new Freddy and spirit.
---
when I play clown pressing and holding my reload button will sometimes charge up bottles but only if I have a full thing of bottles. Reloading them will change bottles and I have to press my attack button to cancel. If I do reload bottles and I hold down too long it will charge them up. Doesn't happen with any other killer that has a second ability
---
The clip was already funny but this made me laugh so hard
---
Having to use 3 perks on a chance you're gonna face Oni is what you call easy to counter? No Mither feeds him so I don't understand that logic. Billy can't bounce of walls or objects and continue on. As well Billy can only take down one person at time, where Oni can slap down everyone in fast succession, 3 at once if he finds 2 healing a 3rd.
---
This. OP's numbers are assuming you start a chase then just stand still to gain a stack without mentioning that you can keep chasing or switch targets or kick a gen or really anything else. Playing the way OP describes is less about the perk more about playing the killer badly. The perk is fine as it is.
---
Yeah like no mither and iron will counters spirit 4head. First of all no mither doesn't at all counter Oni, you still bleed and he still generates charge for his ability, so lets just clear that up. Second of all, him picking people up is not gonna happen, he is literally advantaged to slug, so why would players pick up survivors when they can just go and down the rest of the team. They are also going to, apparently, reduce the charge it takes off when pulling people out of lockers. What counters are there to Oni? Other than jumping in a locker which is unfun for everyone involved.
---
The kind that git two t-baggers t-bagging lmao
---
When you pay full price for a game with a great premise, great mechanics and only in need of a little innovation and balancing but the devs completely avoid all chances of fixing it
---
Alternatively... I'm just spitballing here... Hit your skill checks
---
You're an idiot
---
I'm good with Ghost Face though, so maybe instead of being a jackass you could do something useful with your time.
---
Now when I think about it, it would be good idea with all of the new perks that comes out every four months.
---
They will definitely make it so no mither doesnt drop orbs.
---
I've only just started playing as killer because of the challenges and it's surprised me just how much Ruin feels like it's compulsory. 
---
Obviously I'm just a baby killer, been levelling some up to about 20ish so I can use 4 perks and a couple low tier addons. And just.. wow.
---
Ruin slows the game down to a manageable pace and NOED allows me to practice without feeling like I'm under so much pressure. Though I feel guilty slapping survivors with it after they've clearly outplayed me. NOED is 100% a 'crutch' perk that allows you to get away with playing badly. When I level up my killers some more I'll definitely be swapping it out with something.
---
Everybody know the guy is a douchebag. I got banned first hour in because I said that a cashier is not a career. I wasn't insulting I wasnt looking down on anyone, I just personally think their is a difference between a job and a career.
---
WITNESS ME!
---
It's pretty stupid tbh Oni and billy are a perfect example of how killers were made post realizing the game needed to be balanced. Maybe he's a literal manifestation of how Deadbydaylight usef to be with instaheals, Instagens etc etc. he was balanced by those standards. Now? Oni is pretty much a billy rework, Anyone can toss BBQ and chilly and shred with billy because that's how he plays, You instadown a person, Hook, Chain bbq to someone on a gen, Repeat until dead. I think most killers could use a bit more mobility but billy takes it to the extreme. Nurse was another case but has been modernized even though i feel like she's actually pretty weak now.
---
Windows,
---
A quick turn
---
Stairs
---
A pallet
---
Literally any perk that helps you when you're down
---
Like even being kinda good at loops will make him waste a lot of time
---
The SCP-096 cosmetic
---
I just tunnel people who do that. Obnoxious af
---
Actually the quitter bonus is worth less. You get 500 per time you hook a Survivor plus an additional 200 per hook phase they transition to. Compare this to the 625 you get for someone DCing and you're technically cucking the Killer out of 75 Bloodpoints by DCing. I mean I don't think it's worth losing all of your BP but it's still something.
---
Deathgarden is getting shut down? I didn't know it was even out.
---
Yea, it's been early access for pc for awhile now. But until recently they announced they'll be ceasing further development
---
Like, zoinks, Meg! All that looping sure made me hungry for some bloodpoints!
---
Mike and Ghostface could be strong. Remember that scene in jurassic park where buddy sees the one raptor stalking him, then the one he *didn't* see clawed his dick off? Yeah. Claw their dicks off.
---
The levels were all in the ptb and your math is pretty close. Its not going to be completed by many unless they grind hard.
---
Especially since the challenges in 3 and 4 get significantly more difficult.
---
Demogorgon for close.
---
Yes but by that math if they DC on the 3rd hook you get more
---
That's what happens when transmutation of a soul fails.
---
Not leaving while someone us on the hook is camping. Facecamping is literally staring at a guy on hook. Essentially BM.
---
NOED is a killer perk that let's you one shot once the gates are powered unless all totems are cleanses. Generally regarded as a noob perk
---
Noed is a killer perk called hex no one escapes death and face camping is when u hook someone and u just stay close to them
---
NOED= No one escapes death- Killer perk. 
---
Face Camping= Killer is right by the hook staring at a survivor in the face.
---
I'd just like them to actually be noticable. Some variety would be nice too. Lots look identical
---
NOED is an abbreviation for the killer perk no one escapes death, which is a perk that allows killers to insta down survivors after all the gens are done and face camping is when a killer hooks a survivor and stands within their vicinity thus camping said hooked survivor. 
---
Ps: hope this helps!
---
I really wish I could say that I knew the hatch was there before bringing him to the hook. But, yeah it really was poetic justice.
---
That's a lit totem. You'd get 1600 for that
---
I'm not sexually attracted to women but I want Suit Huntress to step on me.
---
I play 5 or 6 matches a day most days, and I'm at level 31, with two challenges left on the current tome. By time I complete those challenges, I will be level 33 or 34. Some days I will play more than 5 or 6, and some days I will just log in and do one killer and one survivor match for the extra XP.
---
I figure at this point I want to be a bit ahead of the 1 level per day trajectory, because some of the challenges in later tiers of tome look difficult to achieve.
---
Overall, I agree that it's a bit of a grind to get all the way to the end. Even if the total grind was 85 or 90% of what it is now, I think it wouldn't seem so daunting. I suspect they'll get some more data at the end of this cycle to see how many people actually completed it compared to their forecasts, and how many people grab the next rift pass if they have to pay even a portion of the amount themselves.
---
That said, someone only has to make it to level 41 to get 50% off the next rift pass, which isn't that bad, considering there's probably $30 - 35 of cosmetics (excluding charms) by that point. If you are paying $5 per pass after the first one, that's only $25 per year total for extra cosmetics. I know that you're also buying the DLC, so that adds another $30 - 35 per year if you're not waiting for sales or using Iridescent shards to buy unlicensed content.
---
I guess at this point we have to wait and see if they make the grind any easier for subsequent tomes. The novelty of the pass will probably wear off, so they'll want to try to make it attractive to people to continue buying them. If people are only getting halfway through, they may not feel like it's worth their investment.
---
WAKE ME UP INSIDE
---
Wraith kicking the generator is the best. It’s not even a kick... it’s like a curb stomp. Lmfao.
---
They also can do totems, search chests, a bit but only doing gens is barely any bp and not even fun. Luckily noed exists to counter survivors not wanting to do anything else.
---
Stop crying because your opponent utilizes a tactic to try and win. Your made-up rules are meaningless to your opponent.
---
If you DC after you get hooked yes. Beforehand though they technically get less.

Those loops are still near infinites without balanced landing. Balanced Landing no stagger just made it even easier to run them but is not necessary at all. You can still run a killer around the Asylum maps, that one room in Hawkins and Haddonfield basement house without using a pallet even if you’re not running BL. The problem was never really balanced landing, its poor map design. Those maps have *multiple* super safe vaults which are the issue.
---
I agree with most of the responses of "Inner Strength".  
---
However, my one qualm about it is the number of times a teammate sees me go into a locker and stands there waving at me to come out instead of just doing the gen right in front of them.
---
The Entity will dodge lobbies if it thinks Lord Shaggy has found it.
---
Once you uninstall it from steam it doesn't delete all the files ofd your pc the problem lies with one of the files that Doesn't get deleted off the pc when you uninstall it 
---
So you need to go into the steam files and delete the dbd files left
---
I saw it and I can’t unsee.

Hehyeaaaah, boi.

ok so i deleted dbd by opening file location and then uninstalled it from steam and now i am installing it again. am i doing the right thing?

PTB Spirit was scary,the only time the game got scary for me.
---
Oook, gross
---
What happened to these perks ? Haven’t played in like a year. Can someone explain them please ?
---
I don’t think people realize how off they’re going to be until we get closer to the end. It takes me a little over 4 hours to complete ONE level. It’s also based entirely on time played, not how well you do. I don’t have time to play 4 hours a day. Luckily the pass rewards are complete garbage so maybe next “season” they’ll be better and learn how to better balance how to earn them.
---
It's allegedly to stop hacking or discourage farming, but the cap is WAY too low for that to really be their reason. It should be over what 90% of players make per game.
---
Really, it's BHVR trying to preserve "the BP economy," which is the grindiness of the game. Because they're convinced that making the game grindy is one of the only ways to retain players, much as MMOs do.
---
Yeah new DS is definitely stronger than old DS. You cant dribble, its a 5 second stun that isnt effected by enduring and all 4 survivors can get guarenteed use from it
---
Well NOW I do
---
How in the hell did this happen?
---
For the love of god please fix the disconnect error on console. It’s about every 3-4 games...
---
Well at least it not toxic response I guess
---
ps4, also i love your username
---
Detective's Hunch is pretty good, but Survivors are all cosmetic anyway, unless you're sweaty enough to want to abuse Claudette's invisibility or Ace's silence.
---
Pig is weak; basically just a pathetic Ghostface, but she's one of the friendliest farming Killers and has a couple good perks.
---
True
---
Using loops is how you play survivor , that's not being a POS if you wanna get to high ranks , get more blood points , be a better team mate you gotta loop.
---
You can't just turn corners and hope he doesn't find you thats stupid , and just "getting away" without running to a loop will sandbag your team mates no doubt.
---
"Welcome MTV Cribs, my name is Rin and here's where I live"
---
awwwww that's kinda lame, but I expected as much. Thanks then.
---
Spine Chill. Yeah, with anyone who uses stealth, you want to MC Hammer slide over to destinations.
---
I mean thats standard solo queue
---
At first I read it as "Stacked Booty"
---
This is why I was miserable when I made it to a lvl 9 with my shape main... every single match it was me vs like three 4's and a 6 or a 2,4,8,9. 
---
You get the idea. It was almost always tilted to my disadvantage and the survivors sub6 are just fuckin nasty. 
---
They'd take down my Ruin totem in the first minute then gen rush while 1 dude loops me for 3 minutes. I'd finally hook them once then the gates open. Then they'd send 1 to open the gates and 2 to rescue the hooked. I always avoid hook camping because even in this situation it just leads to a ton of toxic bs in my inbox, so naturally they get unhooked while I'm pursuing the others, I go back for the injured and pick them back up, only to be hook-blocked by the remaining 3 survivors in unison like a god damn blockade. The survivor wiggles free and then I get hit with a flashlight, blocked by 2, the remainder sprints away, injured escapes, and right when I'm about to down one of the 2 remaining blockers, they use that fucking sprint boost to escape my final lunge attempt.
---
I know this is r/oddlyspecific but it legit goes down like this on the reg.
---
You do realize BBQ and Chilly can be countered, right?
---
Why did they take that away to begin with? It was fair.
---
DS was overall buffed in the rework
---
That what I want in most matches tbh just some human decency in post games or console messages as well
---
What? Hide behind a gen? You must be joking
---
I really wish Survival score was staggered across completed gens, so there was incentive to help others finish them.

I agree. Like getting downed back to back and being toxic towards the killer. Ik some killers deliberately chase one person but don't blame the innocent killer who wandered there to chase the rescuer and ran into you. I completely agree with yah.
---
Just throwing this out there, bit "baby killer" and "baby survivor" aren't insults. It's a name given to people who are new to the game. Killer mains will generally take it a little easier on a baby survivor, and survivor mains will typically slow gen repair to give the baby killer a better chance. It's terms of endearment for newer players.
---
Cool and all but the teleport is just demigorgons teleport :/ makes him a lil less unique
---
where is this from?

This is proof both sides say some really dumb shit

If you throw it from a building on the first floor it will cause an explosion midair, 20 meters away.

&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here’s how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* **If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor’s rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)**
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. **This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.**
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there’s no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019

](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
The killer should be the 8 armed bitch and her ability should be teleportin through the walls around the map instead of the gapin holes the demigorgon uses
---
I used those because a comment I saw before writing this "stfu your just complaining because you can't get kills and blame gen rush. Baby killer" so I just used that as an example.
---
Watch Videos? Read comments? You can find reddit but you can't find youtube? Jesus Christ some of you people.
---
That's awesome and I'm glad you're enjoying it so much but I have a full time night shift job, I really don't have time to be doing 5 matches and a challenge a day. Especially when I'd like to play other games instead of exclusively DbD for 70 days straight. I get roughly 4 hours free time before work and those 5 matches will easily take up 1 hour 40 minutes alone.
---
Its more complaining they're not doing any other objectives, but of course noed does give a reason for it.
---
Yeah it was fair and when I first found out it was patched I spent a whole match trying to do it as a wraith. From then on I just avoided harvesters. I'm glad we'll be able to do it again in the next update.
---
whats so fun about him though? i find that he is so brain dead to play against usually. hooks someone, barbecue and chili and teleport away, pop goes the weasel a gen, and chase a new survivor. 
---
It's like killers like that don't have to do half the work other killers have to do.
---
i don't find it to fun that he can just know where you are half way across the map and teleport to you. and on top of that you are automatically constantly put into dream state. he goes invisible sometimes, and you lose his heartbeat. nah not a fun killer to play against. 
---
if barbecue and chili didnt exist then yes he would be much more fun to play against since it would actually take skill in guessing which gen you want to tp to. and not just a crutch perk that 95% of sweaty try hard killers use
---
They might fix their coding when you work out how to actually take a video on a laptop.
---
I agree that it’s not really the most fair mechanic but it applies to all oblivious killers. Pig, T1 myers, ghostface, wraith, demogorgon, and even insidious bubba can all effectively camp the hook without setting off Borrowed time.
---
"Killer mains generaly take it a little easier on a baby survivor"
---
What fucking game have you been playing?
---
When you run into an elementary school classmate.
---
Cute! ❤️
---
A bit of that I can agree to but it annoying if someone decided to think an average player is playing like a baby survivor/killer. Not dissing on your opinion tho
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e0om20/get_on_my_level/
---
It'd become hard meta. Although now that I think about it, that would be a fantastic general Killer buff. Just let everyone patrol at a decent speed so you don't see jobbers like Leatherface or Clown desperately looking for someone to attack.
---
The entire team was good, you're absolutely right. But if my teammate were in the Bill's position, they would have ran away. Xbox players aren't altruistic
---
Why do you have the post game chat on?
---
Your coding is probably worse.
---
So... yes?
---
Because it’s surprising how much hate someone can type in the time it takes me to type “gg” and close it.
---
Otz has claimed that Hag is the BEST at top level. Until then, I'd say GF is, followed by Clown, Hag, Myers, Pig, and Wraith.
---
Just know your completely fine and just know there is still decency in DBD. A SWF purposely didn't escape so I can practise with Nurse. You keep hooking them people and doing them gens king. I hope your day is well.
---
Tbf I wouldn't want to play with a blendette either
---
I'm still hoping for Old Freddy's kit plus something like trap totems in some Sandman dude.
---
Normal Tuesday Night and Just Do It are pretty good perks actually. I'd like to see them in the game in some form. The former evens out some of those tougher loops, and the latter will put some downward pressure on gen rushing
---
&gt;* **If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.**

#If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.

I'm curruntly account level 460, and I'm thinking of quitting because the grind is so repetitive, their system isn't working
---
Tbh it doesn't matter too much, if Freddy wants to tunnel he can tunnel. He can just wait for the deep wounds from BT to run out since there will be no terror radius as he put them to sleep with his glove.
---
Cool, I'm on xbox or I would play with you. Cheers, yours too!
---
Its unreasonable for YOU. This is subjective. Again, all you are missing out on is cosmetics, and you probably should have waited or done the math before buying the pass to see if you could reasonably make the money back (which let's be honest, cant really be an issue if you work full time)
---
No I mean the matches, if it's all you play that's fine you do you but it leaves no wiggle room for people who play other games too or have hobbies.
---
Isn’t it wild that some players will never know how Freddy used to be or that he could see auras map wide, heck my friends didn’t even know while they were playing against him.
---
You know who does want EW 3 though is Michael Myers
---
that's right, jay
---
Is everyone sleeping on the fact this guy called him "Hillybilly"?

Your screenshot just proves that matchmaking is working perfectly as it should. Within 6 ranks above or below yours.

I haven't bought the pass dude I even listed that, besides worth is important all the same, it's £8 I could be spending on the Oni or some other game / thing for far better value for money.
---
Holy crap, how much was it? I'm interested.
---
Is it me or are all the recent Micheals act like absolute cunts? Every Micheal I've seen in the past few weeks camp, tunnels, plays like a scumbag. One of them was even teaming with two clauds
---
"if I camp the survivor on hook, that means I will win" rephrase so it makes sense.
---
Thrilling, I’m all ears, NOED, and BBQ just for that salt
---
So how sweaty did they claim you were?
---
I earned all of the available serum thanks to the tome challenges. I play like 2-3 to hours a day.
---
this sounds like it came from the depths of hell dear god
---
It's pretty much the only game I still play regularly. Plus the only reason I'm going so hard at it is because i want to get the blight serum. Most likely not gonna complete next rift.
---
I disabled communications with non friends on Xbox because every game someone messages me hateful stuff.
---
Bbq for points + where to go, NOED because it's NOED, Whispers let you stop a gen repairing and Rancor for a beautiful Mori
---
So this wraith was really nice. Apparently he had to get the grab a survivor in the archives (hard af when you have a terror radius half the time). We all ended up leaving because he was nice boi.
---
Fair enough, battle passes aren't typically aimed at the "few hours here and there" player, I'm currently in a full time Uni course and work weekend nightshift, though I think I can still JUST max the pass, but dbd is the only game I play atm lol
---
Except they were all free to begin with, every single one of them
---
Yeah that’s why I play ghostface
---
who the fuck plays myers in high rank without getting bodied every game, I want to play in your region ...
---
And yet it moves...
---
That’s literally the actual model that OP posted, just in a different pose so it’s not a real eye
---
O no
---
The only thing that is OP about Oni is the flick.
---
Hillbilly had a flick, but that too was op, so it was removed. Do the same for Oni, and he'll be perfectly balanced.
---
I love farming but it takes so long. I do it when I'm winning idk why. Though, I do it just for the chance that some salty baby gets mad about farming.
---
Why can’t billy just fly out of the wall and escape the entity’s grasp. Maybe come to LA and chainsaw away in downtown. I’ll sure to watch it.

Well i guess they dont want to deal with camping ghostface

I know. I’m just saying the eye in the mask moves

No I disagree, I play both survivor and killer and never use ruin. It's all about gen and time management.

Nancy looks like the lovechild of nancy and Emma watson and Steve looks like the lovechild of steve and Toby Maguire.

I mean I think people agree legion and some other killers are not in a strong place. This doesnt suddenly mean spirit and oni are not broken in chases.

That's dope. You should add some blood and weathering to it.

Not a good idea

1-we already got teleportation powers.

2-i think he would be a mix between piggy and demogorgon (head traps*maybe*, teleporting)

3-it's not always good getting licensed killers, it gets boring if it isn't already
---
Right now there is a 20 second cooldown between protection hits, on December 3rd the cooldown will be 3 seconds.
---
I cant stand this. You dead hard and still get hit. Tough
---
I don't know about you guys but I usually let my mom do it.
---
You need 3 protection hits for it to active then next time going from injured to downed u will get the speed boost and live currently protection hits are very broken but they are being easier to get in the next update
---
Oh? 
---
Youre approaching me?
---
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoFfFfFfFfFf
---
r/lostredditors ?
---
*^^very* *angry* *^^^Japanese* ^^^^wahhhs
---
Okay, I believe you.
---
I'm sorry WHET!?
---
So she can one shot every survivor and see / hear them from 1000 miles away
---
I dont understand
---
WWE, shinsuke nakamura and AJ styles
---
It’d be cool to have them like on  a charm necklace.
---
That’s the enti- nea
---
Yeah i could see how thays not fun. I never really even get to see that because the first guy down and D/Cs and the rest follow then j just die on hook haha.
---
Just as you cant kick a gen that is being worked on.
---
Freddy's map pressure is silent, faster, and can be bluffed to stall progress without committing. He doesn't have an insta-down, but he does have an anti-loop ability that kills any chance of being given the run around. Billy turns into an M1 killer at loops since his chainsaw is too limited in them, and that can waste precious time. Freddy also has passives that make him stall the game greatly.
---
Billy's kit is good at patrolling, bad at loops, and he gets an insta-down ability reliant on survivors making mistakes. Freddy is godlike at patrolling, incredible at loops, and has a passive that inherently slows down the game if the survivors choose to try to counter his abilities.
---
Billy is fun and effective, but if we're talking raw potential, Freddy goes higher on the list.
---
Same here plague and spirit
---
I remember the instant D/Cs due to legion because he was zero fun. This isnt as bad but it's happening a lot more than I would have thought.
---
Amazing and terrifying!
---
Are random loud sounds playing for you too?? I open up dbd to some unholy fucking screeching every time, i have a post on it
---
See: Make Your Choice
---
It’s happening on the 3rd of December with the release of the next chapter and yeah it’ll probably be given to mobile too, I mean that’s the reason why they’re doing it. So no one’s missing out on exclusives, as well as people getting scammed.
---
I honestly think it's getting to be as bad as legion. Usually one or two disconnect on sight when I play gf.
---
Wow I've never noticed that
---
Doesn't matter if she can hear you if you can loop her, she's not a spirit
---
Thanks! I hope the ones that got these with money will get something special atleast,it sucks especially if you got all of them
---
Just a casual reminder that if you are dead and calling killer any variation of 'bad', it means you that you can't escape even against bad killer, which puts you somewhere below him.
---
YESSSSSSSS never played Evil Within but YEESSSS
---
Oh my. I've done this but for like 10 minutes. I assume you proceeded to question all your lifes choices.
---
You deserve it for using self care.
---
So much for their egos lmao
---
Look at the bottom right cosmetic,look on top of the pig
---
I’ve almost always seen people get hit across windows, like far across too.
---
I really wish they’d double down on more fear factor for this game.
---
The oblivious status effect is a step in the right direction, along with sounds and music for demo being fucking terrifying
---
I'm usually using Aftercare so sometimes I'll look around while doing gens and see people on the opposite end of the map just crouching down and doing nothing. It's the worst in chases, the killer is on me and the other guy can pretty easily tell yet he's still hiding in the corner of the map.
---
Is it being shut down or something?
---
Oh shit just kidding, it went F2P. Nevermind.
---
This Is A New Version Of This Post, Because Last Time It Didnt Get Any Upvotes, And Some Perks Are Buffed.
---
Leatherface says hello
---
Nurse? Legion? A legion of nurses?
---
because he have no pants
---
You can get one for like 20 $ off of Amazon.
---
Using distortion is more of a joke than hiding behind a gen.
---
&gt;what would you do if before you have walked 10 meters away from the hook 2 survivors rush in and get the unhook, of course you hit the person just taken off the hook because it's logical to go for the person who is one shot but no they have borrowed time. 
---
You've already known they do have it, so it definitely wasn't logical to hit the one who was recently unhooked as BT prevents exactly what you said from happening. 
---
&gt; they spawn on top of ruin, they are do 3 gens within 60 seconds of the game starting by which time I have only just reached the survivor and am now faced with broken loops like cow tree. 
---
That's a bit of an exaggeration but okay. I'm not saying that gens do not gen done fast, but a gen takes 80 seconds to finish, plus they still get ruin skillchecks during the ruin cleansing time, if they manage to spawn on top of it, as you said. If you're uncapable of ending the cow tree loop, go find someone else, that isn't near shack or the tree. 
---
&gt; I play fairly but had I camped from the beginning I would likely have gotten at least a 2k. 
---
Nobody forces you to play fair. If you want to get a 2k or 4k, slug, camp, whatever. Both sides do things that are very annoying. 
---
&gt; You don't hear killers telling survivors how to play the game, it's total bs. 
---
You're biased. Killer mains absolutely do tell survivors what do to and don't and vice versa.
---
You're just mad that they used everything at their disposal to achieve their objective, while still using mechanics that are implemented in the game.
---
It's basic logic. If i DC then the killer loses, but if i make the kille DC they still lose.
---
Happened to me with a locker recently, weird. Something with interactions being broken
---
Riiiiiiight. Completely normal.
---
I just find it really cringe to add TTV to your name. Especially when they start posting links to their stream/youtube. I've never seen anyone make it big by doing that. Please tell/link me a streamer who has followed this strategy and worked.
---
*O ni
---
Who tf do you like, otz?
---
Wow. This is really impressive!
---
Lol the other day I went against a spirit with Beads, mother-daughter ring, and an ebony. We easily did all the gens but she killed everyone by the end, yet she had the audacity to call me trash lol
---
This is about overpowered stuff and billy is mentioned lol I'm mot sure how you got oni from this as he seems to be a weaker billy.  Additionally Billy has been in the game for a long time.
---
You could end the sentence at "fun" and replace Killer with 'Other Players' and this meme would be m
---
That's true
---
Skill checks, progress bars, button prompts ritual icons all have low resolution textures
---
That’s a fucking fantastic comeback lmao
---
You're not alone. That's the life of a solo survivor. Sometimes you'll get useless team mates, other times you'll get great team mates that know what to do. It gets slightly better in red ranks, but even in red ranks there are some survivors who still can't work through ruin and will not touch a gen until ruin is cleansed!
---
If they dont tea bag and flashlight after dropping pallets
---
Yes, adrenaline works through exhaustion so basically it's a double sprint burst.
---
the ghostface teabagged him back guaranteed
---
Good bot
---
Fuck the end result...look at the 4 categories...that shows you more or less what you've done in the match. 32k is too broad.
---
Completely up to you. I personally dont unless 3 dc and they stay. I'll let people live longer if I see someone purposely sandbag someone else and just tunnel the sandbagger(the only reason I tunnel).
---
it doesnt
---
Sorry :(
---
+1
---
I love aftercare, but I swear sometimes my team mates will use it to bring the killer to me during a chase and try to sandbag. That's why I swapped it out for Bond.
---
As much as people hate on SWF, you gotta admit that it's one of the only ways to genuinely enjoy this game and have a good time. 
---
Solo survivor forces you to play with total morons that do NOTHING while you get chased all game and try to juggle gens and unhooks while they leave you to die on first hook. Map RNG will always fuck you by having structures like Groaning Storehouse and Rancid Abattoir with their windows closed.
---
Playing killer puts you against super coordinated and skilled players that repair gens with max efficiency, and always seem to have the right perks for every situation (when you slug they have unbreakable, when its Haddonfield they have balanced, etc.) and buildings like Groaning Storehouse and Rancid Abbatoir will always have their windows open.
---
I'm meaning why aren't they like the first set,  you could get to challenges without doing killer ones. Not for special ones,  how the fuck did you get that out of my question? If I don't play killer "alot" those challenges are harder for me and I don't get to play a lot.
---
I got 4 iridescent with max score on each category
---
You should cry about it. I'm sure that will fix things right up.
---
Yeah you can still see prestige/character level.
---
Killer title 'The Monster"
---
I seriously ask a fucking question,  and y'all are attacking me lolololol. Killer mains I suppose.
---
Great idea!
---
I got that too
---
&gt; You've already known they do have it, so it definitely wasn't logical to hit the one who was recently unhooked as BT prevents exactly what you said from happening. 
---
But I didn't know they had borrowed time at this point and I didn't figure they all had it until the very end. 
---
&gt; That's a bit of an exaggeration but okay. I'm not saying that gens do not gen done fast, but a gen takes 80 seconds to finish, plus they still get ruin skillchecks during the ruin cleansing time, if they manage to spawn on top of it, as you said. If you're uncapable of ending the cow tree loop, go find someone else, that isn't near shack or the tree. 
---
They literally spawned on top of ruin, as in it was gone within 30 seconds. It was thompson's house so gens were really far apart and they all had toolboxes with add ons to speed them up. I put as much pressure on as  I could (instead of hook camping) but there was no clear 3 gen for the end game and they did gens very fast. If I seem them on cow loop then I leave pretty much straight away.
---
&gt; Nobody forces you to play fair. If you want to get a 2k or 4k, slug, camp, whatever. Both sides do things that are very annoying. 
---
That's true and I should have done.
---
&gt;You're biased. Killer mains absolutely do tell survivors what do to and don't and vice versa. You're just mad that they used everything at their disposal to achieve their objective, while still using mechanics that are implemented in the game.
---
I'm definitely not biased lmao. I have way more hours as a survivor in this game then I do killer. My point is survivors always say "don't camp, don't tunnel"  it's like telling  a killer not to do their job, imagine a killer being like "don't do gens, don't loop me". Yeah there probably is some killers like that but if you have ever played killer then you will know that the post game chat and messages are heavily survivor sided in terms of salt. Like 99% of the games it's the surviviors messaging the killers and being salty.
---
I'm mad because it is broken. Swf is broken enough, yet 4 bt's on top of that is just overkill. Just because a mechanic is in the game does not mean that it isn't broken. For example: ebony moris on the killer side of things and the killer hosting the connection on console.
---
Thank you :D
---
Oh man, you gotta play them!
---
Since there's clearly an agreement that billy is busted, He's essentially about as counterable as 5 blink nurse, "You could technically win against her" but that doesn't in any form mean she's not broken.
---
Not a big fan of horror but DBD isn't that scary so...
---
You are complaining about challenges from a damn game that is regularly based on killers and survivors. And also the fact that you don’t play killer regularly doesn’t necessarily mean anything. They are challenges dude for all players no matter killer or survivor. The challenges are quite simple and basic. It doesn’t make sense on why you would expect challenges to be all survivors or just one path specifically for survivors. If you wanna earn stuff then play the game more with killers and do the challenges. Simple as that.
---
There's a lot of complaining in ITT, my first thought is.. Mettle is getting a sweet buff - yoink!
---
Maybe being forced to play killer will teach you a lesson. Nobody is attacking you, just pointing out that you are being a baby about a tiny issue. You aren't forced to play killer to get to the epilogue, you aren't forced to even do the damn thing. If you don't want to do it then dont. If you do then suck it up.
---
Self heal A? Lol
---
Yeah I regularly play killer and I suppose that makes me a killer main but guess what i have all the challenges completed by leveling up survivors and playing the game like it’s supposed to be played.
---
honestly I feel like you should be able to pick yourself up once per game.  After that you need a team mate to pick you up, I think that'd be very fair and would make getting slugged less of a problem.  I know when I slug in games it's generally just to have 1 less person on gens for a bit.  I don't really want to have them on the ground the whole match.
---
i dont play killer so more shaggy dwights for me
---
Self care D and Well make it b. 
---
Well make it b because half the time you try to use it someone runs away. 
---
Self care d because it’s a horrible perk.
---
L
---
Based on how you use it. Having the ability to can be clutch, but knowing when is a good time to use it is the difference between F and A.
---
Self care is about timing. Knowing when is the right time to use it makes a difference.
---
I'm a survivor main. I don't get to play as much as I like, so I tend to get to rank 8 or so. Nothing to write home about. 
---
I appreciate where you're coming from. I just see it as a way for the game to encourage people to try new things. Sure, they're tricky, but it's not impossible. You'll be low level, so stick with it.
---
We've been expecting! ✝️🦍
---
No, make him eat fiber rich food.
---
No mither B tier?
---
Honestly SH is trash. Maybe useful for new players but i wouldn’t recomend it for anyone. If you have Bond you’re good to go
---
Reason for overcharge? Not against the placement just curious for your reason
---
Never is the right time to use it.
---
You’re not allowed to crouch. Didn’t you read the rule book?
---
It keeps people from tapping gens in chase. Which is useful.
---
Gross
---
Thanks lol, I'm gay and arab, they just come out of me sometimes.
---
So when you're one of the last two people alive and he's camping a hook by an exit gate, you don't think self care could be clutch for making a save?
---
Bro I dont normally play survivor but I had to in order to complete the challenges. Either pick a killer and try your best and you will get them! The killer ones I thought would be hard this time got done so damn fast! I dont even play trapper and got his done in one game!
---
Deja Vu best perk change mind.
---
It was almost like making the Blink power, but it requires no targeting or skill was a bad idea. Yes short of a freddy level rework Legion wont work, bypassing loops without some sort of major caveat or skill check linked to it, Nurse requires the player to understand how far she blinks based on charge, while also being slower then a survivor and having fatigue to naturally give downtimes for the survivor to break chase, ontop of the Blink charge meaning survivors can change direction to throw the blink off. Spirit has a general Mindgame power, she cant see survivors when phased allowing counterplay through acting in unexpected ways, IE drop a pallet in front of you instead of running through it.
---
Legion had no such Counterplay, there is not physically a way you can mess up leaping over a window or pallet with his power and there will be no way to make his power viable without reworking it to have similar Skill expression elements as Last Breath and Yakamota's Haunting.
---
When was this? I did the exact same but was the spirit.
---
Like I said it's about timing lol
---
If someone rage quits I'll normally let the other three farm. And if I'm in a good mood I always let one survivor live!
---
Lol Ik it's controversial but denying a killer the ability to full team slug is very powerful. But you need to be very good and very careful.
---
Which one?
---
Deja vu is best boi
---
Timing? In what situation is SH good? That perk only slows you down. Actually your entire list is trash.
---
You will see this under the word YEET !!
---
Haha!
---
... Ed by Daylight.
---
And how many times does this happen for it to be justified? I can tell you a lot more less then how many times adrenaline goes off.
---
Also it’s about a 30 second heal if you are guessing he’s camping a hook to which at that time you could either be looking for hatch as well. 
---
But lastly that’s one scenario where selfcare is okay in. Self care takes too long to heal just bring a medkit or find one. 
---
Also less people are doing gens while 1 person is healing and then sometimes you have 2-4 people healing at the same time slowing down the game and giving the killer a win.
---
I main killer and when I happen to complelty destroy the survivors or especially they have early dc I spend at least 10min trying to make them understand that I am friendly.
---
The easiest one is, say gates are open, you're one of the last 2 people, 1 guy is hooked and being proxy camped and you are injured with borrowed time. You can self care and make a play to get you both out alive.
---
staby-staby
---
Main difference: TF2 is free to play! Items like unusuals and golden pan have inherent value due to their rarity, making them rather desirable.
---
The pan is 1600 keys, each key being roughly 1.70 on the open market. 
---
There's about 180 pans in game, even though the mode you get them in has been around for 6 years! A pan dropping is such a monumental event that there's a global message that displays to everyone online when you receive one.
---
People cash out their backpacks in TF2 all the time, some leaving with trading profits in the thousands (I'm personally up $300). Since there's an official trade system and they collect money from fees and all, it's actively supported to do so. It's not like paying $800 for a non-transferable Feng Skin
---
Killer obviously knowing you have no mither will hook you right away. For countering slugging unbreakable is much better and has no major downsides as no mither has.
---
Honestly he looks like the musical beetle juice
---
Bro have you been watching my stream lol!? I swear this is exactly my life. Solo survive and I'm doing well my teammates are fucked off playing in the corn! If I play killer every god loop in open and there is a pallet every three feet
---
Stop assuming I'm saying you should heal every time you're injured. Lol
---
Like I said, it's about knowing when you should or shouldn't.
---
I am just as much of a member of the no heal and do gens in 4mins meta. I'm devotion 16 level 50. But despite its meme status it is still useful.
---
I'm not interested in arguing further :) feel free to disagree
---
Amazing style!
---
Decent list, I think tenacity is too low and boil over and botany knowledge too high. 
---
Mods will probably remove this though since tier lists aren’t allowed anymore
---
“The battle for survival begins, engage!”
---
Which is why unbreakable is S tier and no mither is lower Lol
---
It's very clear that they often do exactly that, deciding to change things and then saying that they're bugs expecting it's less controversial that way. Some killer nerfs were like that. Compare how they announced on patch notes the Pig's dash nerf ("Fixed an issue that caused The Pig's Dash attack to count as a basic attack") to how they're nerfing Legion's Feral Frenzy ("Attacking while in Feral Frenzy will no longer be a basic attack").
---
They said time and again that they want to bridge the gap between info that solos and SWF get, and this was one of their efforts for that. Now they'wanna back out on it, but again afraid of receiving any flack. They should just be honest with us.
---
That was seriously so long ago, get over it.
---
Nobody is agreeing that Billy is busted. I said with addons, insta saw addons, but addons themselves are another story.
---
Stay on topic, nobody is talking about non-existent 5 blink Nurse (which wasn’t even a good build to begin with). My entire point is you can dodge a chainsaw. Your counters to the chainsaw make you distance, and you can use landscape to your advantage. 
---
With Oni you have to hope he misses his incredible hitbox+flick. And even if he does, the power is reactivated, he dashes around obstacles and gets you 5 seconds later. 
---
If an Oni player isn’t getting downs it’s solely because he’s bad and missing, I have yet to see anybody successfully avoid his special down, because they can’t.
---
Yeah, but it’s not my job
---
hes no where near as bad as the old legion, or the futire legion haha, but i guess its the perception
---
I can agree with botany. Boil over is very powerful depending on the map. Tenacity I can see being a little higher.
---
Is the content any different?
---
I mean, if i see a girl like Susie i'm staying while laughing at the bad jokes and comments of the rest of the gang so they don't kick me out.
---
Lol I'm a devotion 16 level 50 killer main and trust me, this perk is consistently a thorn in my side. It's just rare to see skilled people using it seriously. It's best used stealthily for doing gens and/or denying a quad slug situation.
---
Paired with spine chill, resilience, and dead hard it can be really powerful.
---
Say, didn’t I see this on the Dead by Daylight Amino?
---
Can I cut his face off so I can wear it? 
---
Be the duo no one ever asked for Leatherface and Mrs. Myers.
---
I’d agree
---
* around the world by daft punk starts playing*
---
Yeah that is true
---
ironically my good friend was with me at this con as Bubba boi himself! If I can wrangle those pics from him I'll show!
---
honey, it just got worse with "dedicate" servers lol
---
For survivors it could be cool if dead ones were dark, the rest normal.
---
My Legion did that.
---
Lol that’s just too good man. Shit well we can make it a three way and you can’t just stick nails in my head. 
---
Is that severed head from Halloween 2018 or from a earlier movie I can’t remember.
---
Hell yes, this needs to happen
---
*cough cough* repost *cough cough*
---
You know how it goes!! You play it a lot, and then it’s becoming really annoying so you start hating this game. It took me around 7 months to come back😂
---
It is officer Francis from H18! I hadnt started the con with him but a Nightmare toys both was selling him I knew he would be a great thing to freak people out with so I impulse bought him LOL
---
I honestly won't be suprised if micheal mains are downvoting me rn, instead of reading my comment, they get offended by the fact that I offended their daddy micheal
---
that scream at the beginning before skipping it is annoying
---
Lol what’s with the creepy as noise in the background?
---
Pay attention, She was a comparison to broken abilities which she fits in. And you can dodge a chainsaw "until you can't". And if the billy plays smart with the hitbox add on, You won't. 
---
You're not in control of your location during a chase as you pursue gens and move to save teammates in addition to seeking ruin if it's needed. 
---
This isn't specifically about oni, Stay on topic. He's still in the ptb which is due to change.
---
You saved the comment by adding the other people after Noob.
---
It's pretty common for BHVR to make new paid killers kinda the same but way stronger than old free ones.
---
Trapper - trap bags 100%
---
Huntress - flower babushka
---
Literally any other killer - I don't know
---
Mommy Myers strikes again! 
---
Can I get some stabs when you are done with this poor soul in the pic?
---
*laughs in tombstone*
---
I had a guy go “want me to use my main? It’s a p3” And switched to an all bloody Kate. Of course we all went “wooooah dude.” And gave him mad props because of course it’s a groundbreaking achievement.
---
wow lol. that doesn't really make much sense
---
Iron will is great to run against her as well.
---
Yea he looks nothing like Dave, but he shares a lot of Drax’s characteristics

---
Of course, and I'll let you pick the location 😊
---
Disagree, self care is a solid perk.
---
Don’t know why you mentioned Myers Ultra Rare add-ons. While Tuff Of Hair is good, it’s only with a green add-on that makes you stalk faster. Myers tombstone on the other hand is one of the worst add-ons in the game that requires you to get potatos that will let you stalk and not do gens through ruin.
---
I think for ghostface its less about being fun to play against and more a lot of people playing him act toxic.
---
I'd says 8/10 times I see a ghostface they tend to camp and hard tunnel and teabag even if they chased you for 3 gens before catching you. stuff like that. Another example a ghostface who happened to stalk and catch me early in a game and teabagged me until I died on the ground and then a second guy then DC when the gates got powered.
---
Just a lot of players going out of their way as him to try and be toxic and I think he is getting that reputation. Also after 7 or 8 ghostfaces in a row it gets boring.
---
jesus fucking christ that song gave me a ratatouille flashback
---
I really dislike the base head. It's so huge that it's as big as her torso and the hair is ugly and amateurish. Test subject head is her best one.
---
New DS is stronger than what old DS was.
---
I guess once he's roided out on Serum, Evan doesn't care anymore about wardrobe malfuctions. A few more vials and the pants fall off
---
Yeah. If I camp the survivor then I'll win. Think about it. A rank 20 killer with that mindset or a rank 1 killer with that mindset have a chance to win or not considering the survivors they will have to camp.
---
I just wish legion wasn't useless against an injured survivor. Bring back the whole frenzy stabs lower the deep wound timer
---
Best tip
---
Nah old DS was stronger because it could be used at any time not just after unhook BUT it was counter able
---
Yeah I agree, it's dirty. Of course it's fun though and there's no way to balance it because then solo survivors would have it even harder.
---
Fine if you insist, steve can join in too but he has to wear the scoops ahoy outfit.
---
Killer perk tier lists are horrible because killers have access to various powers
---
Chad Oni is adoring but disappointed in his nerd Grandchild
---
Okay here's the thing this is pretty interesting. The Survivor perks aren't too bad the first one however I would say you might want to move that to being a level 40 unlock teachable. Primarily because a hook not being in a certain spot can easily make or break a Killer's momentum. Especially if somebody or an entire team has that perk. If everybody was running that perk and and brought that offering that gets rid of one hook... then the killer at the start of the game literally has no hooks... that's basically a disconnect waiting to happen
---
This is so good!
---
Not when the power is extremely powerful when used correctly which is not a difficult thing to do. Especially spirit. Powers are meant to support the killer in killing the survivors without providing an overwhelming advantage making chases 1 far too one sided.
---
That's fair lol
---
Grammar

Edited the original comment in the meantime

I'm not saying it has been stolen and of course armor is just inspired by Japanese culture but the sounds used for exemple are not set by Japanese culture so I was just saying that it's probably one of their inspiration

I fuckin hate when killers shake their head like they’re hot shit when half the hits they get are bullshit.
---
I've had these types accuse me of camping and tunnelling. It's kinda hard for me to leave the hook site when I see you fuckers swarm the hook like little goblins the second I turn around.
---
I just usually see people say myers' ultra rares are the best, I personally think Amanda's letter takes the cake
---
Pig - Combat Straps and Video Tape. It allows her to use her crouch and ambush much faster, and even lets you get hits around some loops with line of sight blockers. It takes the ability from a niche stealth mechanism to an actual threat.
---
Plague - Anything that adds purge effectiveness, and anything that decreases purge cooldown. This lets you break people in a single puke, even if you miss a little, and the cooldown reduces the movement slow afterwards and allows a quick hit right after they break with no real time to react, really great combination.
---
yes
---
Maybe theme-wise.
---
Everyone knows that the strongest ultra-rare gameplay-wise is huntress’ iri head
---
Well if you look for the bloodpools then yes, otherwise it's countered by stridor.

1. Make DS last 20-30 seconds
---
2. Pause timer while in a chase
---
It's really not that hard to fix it
---
I thought the same thing OP. Especially when I heard the sound design for him.
---
I tend to forget add-ons exist and wonder why I win matches
---
My survivor is moaning with iron will on and I’m hella confused
---
you will live in fear of the great claudette-locker
---
On PS4 u don't need to add them some can just have a msg sent. Because they have there settings set that way. I used to get hatemail so I set it that random ppl can't send any msg. Anyone who takes the extra step to send a (hate) message via friend request needs to get their priorities straight lol.
---
"NOED, Ruin, BBQ tryhard"
---
 One perk that can be destroyed before it even pops
---
 One perk that basically just stops great skillchecks from doing much, and can be destroyed easily
---
 And one with very easy to counter auras, like. Super fucking easy and predictable
---
Ok but since the legion counts as one killer, do they see each other between matches
---
That's because the killer has stridor, it's globally changed
---
It’s more like he full on skipped leg days, with a party up top and nothing to show down below. I always giggle when he materializes and rings his bell, standing like a goof that cants his head, or runs after someone.
---
So stridor makes u moan or what
---
The killer isn't killing me right! 😭
---
It makes the wounded sounds 50% because iron will takes away 100% and stridor adds 50% globally
---
Why do you like the change? They really don’t seem useful at all
---
tfw windows are now speed boosts
---
i hate him hes so anang
---
Oh really I wasn't aware of that glitch my bad. Also yeah lol I didnt think about the perks
---
Hillbilly:Tuning guide-Doom engravings aka "crack billy"
---
btw that's a point
---
for someone like Doc, distressing is godtier because he makes more use of his power as a tracking ability. or for someone like nurse or billy, bbq becomes even higher tier than for anyone else because they actually use the info and can get around the map quickly.
---
It's kind of like Freddys class photo. It warns every survivor, so it's fair and isn't op but if a survivor gets too comfortable or thinks that spirit isn't phasing over to them they will massively pay for it. Now I don't necessarily think it was the best change (my idea was to make it so that you can hear her woosh but only when she's really close) but it definitely dropped prayer beads from the bullshit op tier it was in
---
AaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Everyone loves to pretend the hatch doesn't exist whenever they go on their "NOED rewards failure" tangents.
---
Also why would I delete my comment? I just made a bad assumption.
---
Hes billy but worse in every single way. The only thing leatherface does better than billy is camping. He needs a complete rework like freddy.
---
It seems to change based on the number of generators, it's changed most when in the find the exit phase
---
Leatherface is a horror icon, some might even say he’s the first true horror slasher. So it breaks my heart seeing an icon like him in such a bad place. I hope he gets a complete rework soon :/
---
I don't send hate mail but ok bud
---
There’s nothing wrong here, you can be matched within 6 ranks of yourself.

I don't think he hit tier 3, but with the mori i guess red stain doesn't show?
---
Worst killer in the game honestly, his power helps him camp, nothing else.
---
Legion was broken they had to be changed

Ugh, so anang.

I was waiting for that sweet DC :(

I would like to see a rework that includes changing his chainsaw rev to sound like a generator

Level up nurse and get thanophobia and nurses calling. Sloppy butcher is a base perk and then any fourth perk that you like. Ruin from hag or pop from clown is good. You could get plague for her corrupt intervention.
---
Ah yes, no mither in B tier
---
I always found it's the dogshit survivors that act toxic
---
Or ones that play in anti-fun ways (Humping broken buildings, holding W and running to the opposite side of the map with no mindgaming/ greeding tiles)
---
Oh okay thanks
---
i had someone doing this to get me to chase them and i wanted to rip my ears off
---
Lol I had to message a teammate other day bc he was gen tapping not even realizing there was no ruin. Dudes response actually made me laugh he was like " can never be so sure"
---
OOF, I didn't know there were perks that stopped it working! Please share what you know. I checked the perks, but nothing unusual stood out to me.
---
&gt; What rank are you? This sounds great for 15+, horrible for &lt; 5.
---
Well, I've been in the PTB for a while so in the live game i'm rank 3, and 4 pips. So?

---
Out of curiosity, how many times do killers send you salt messages?
---
I played the game but I ended up ditching it so all I really got out of it were the masks and about 6 hours of gameplay
---
*Moon theme plays*
---
Real shit considering any time I let loose my chainsaw I drop 15 frames, the chainsaw noise add ons make absolutely no sense on him, chili is practically negligible, he's whatever in a chase, and has no map pressure.
---
Yeah because infinites on half the maps were so much fun
---
I dont think it's safe to use your mobile as a sex toy
---
No that was just his first reaction to the perk, he didnt read the survivor perks so he had no idea what he was looking at
---
All of these except MoM are still really good, stop complaining OP
---
Probably 1 in 10 games? Not as frequent as survivors, but just as toxic
---
His best add on is the feather it allows you have less pause after you throw a bottle. Mix that's with bleach along with stbfl and you will  get way more hits. Remember you can throw your bottles one way and go around the other side of a structure. to cut people off a lot of times they don't want to run into the gas. I throw a bottle down before I pick some one up who might have ds. Also throw your bottle high in a tree and it will spread to a bigger area. If you thing someone gonna balance throw Your bottle where you think there go na land.  Just practice getting the most out of your bottles cause the reload time is insane.
---
PREACH
---
I'm so tired of having games that favor the killer because all the survivors are lagging their asses off from killers ping. If I'm playing killer and notice the survivors are having lag issues, I'll let them escape, and then not play for a couple hours until my wifi figures itself out.
---
They definitely arent cheap, they are super high quality however and if painted right are very flexible and feel like skin since they are made from foam latex -- Theyre used for crossdressers and drag queens mostly, but its extremely hard to find a female mask that is emotionless with unexaggerated features! So I was willing to drop a pretty penny for it!
---
Honestly genderbends are the best! I have always wanted to cosplay as Myers but couldnt because its difficult for me to hide my figure -- So why let gender stop you?? Just have fun and be creative!! people will love the take you have on the character more than likely!
---
* Tier lists of any kind. This includes meme tier lists and personal perk/killer rankings.
---
Ruin, thana, dying light, and pop are the reasons why people hate freddy and plague
---
Things like this always irritate me. 
---
Take the Azur Lane devs for example: There was a bug that let you zoom in on the title screen (so a kinda similar case here). People liked it and asked if it could stay. Developer saw the positive feedback and in a future updates (my best guess is like a few weeks) they promised to fully implement that feature. Of course the community's reaction was overwhelmingly positive, because this simply shows how you as a developer care about the playerbase.
---
*THICC*
---
But bl was fine as it was😫
---
It didn’t need the change 
---
Look how they massacre my boy
---
Looping prevents you from getting many bloodpoints because all you're doing is running in circles until you get killed.
---
Was he in Evil within 1 the entire game? If thats the case he has undetectable and wont proc bt

Claudette immediately begins with Self Care

Laurie immediately begins with Decisive Strike

So Claudette, Dwight, or Laurie saves you from buying a single perk on their web

I hope so, it would be dope!

Lol she's my main I get this when I use her blight skin lmfao
---
Generally people save BP so when a new killer/survivor is released,  they can just pour them into the new characters and unlock all perks asap.
---
As long as they keep his chainsaw the same. Give him an small little extra ability like most killers. And rework his perks I think they can make him fun. An please everyone.

Holy shit that’s actually a very good and unique cosplay.

Ok homophobe

I really appreciate that! thank you so very much, she was and had been a labor of love and will only continue to get better!
---
That's the problem with pay2win. If these assclown devs are going to make a killer or perk that's OP when it comes out so everyone will buy it, then nerf it into the ground (Legion, MoM) people are going to stop buying their shit.
---
I just prefer to play fair. People didn't buy this game to be tunneled and given unfair disadvantages
---
We may not know him, but we sure as fuck played with him.
---
looks like Woahvicky
---
Nurse
---
Bruh what are you on??
---
nope. happening to me too
---
Old DS was good for shit tier survivors who used it 30 seconds into the match, got caught again 10 seconds later (Enduring), then DCed. The later in the match DS is used, the more powerful it is, and the changes guaranteed you won't be using it until the game is half over unless you're an ultra potato.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
In a nutshell, it makes it easier to design cosmetics and outfits that look natural when the model you're working with is anatomically accurate.  Just about any game you've played in the past 10 years with multiple costumes is going to have secret nipples and hidden fun bits.
---
I dunno man, fucking the killer out of 3 hooks is far bigger then a 625 quitter bonus, if anything the quitter bonues should be worth 20% more then the 3 hooks he/she could have been worth as a way to say "shut up and take the L survivor".
---
There is no insta heal anymore, check the add-on descriptions for that matter.
---
When I was trying to reach red ranks, I wanted to make it with 100% my efforts (dumb, I know). So I basically hated every farm game and never took the hatch when killer let me. 
---
I didn't (and never will) say something to a killer like that tho. I know it's pretty rough to read some things like that
---
You won’t be able to until you unlock their teachables. Teachables are earned by leveling the characters, bond is at 30 on Dwight, self care is 40 on Claudette and decisive strike is 40 on laurie
---
Nah me too
---
4%
---
I couldnt make to watch that bit of the stream 😂 he looks and sounds like he's dying inside 😂😂

Same, I play 70/30 survivor/killer and she’s my main, but knowing the pain prayer beads were (even if I always run spine chill) made me never use them lmao
---
This is so dope
---
Unfortunately not, might also be awhile because decisive strike was in the shrine a month or so ago from what I remember.
---
She would be ridiculously strong, probably at the point of being OP. There’s a reason why Huntress is a 110 Killer and not 115%.
---
I'd say just use portals less if you find that you're running into this issue. Put the portals in good positions, like near the center of maps on hills or hard to reach places (like 2nd stories of buildings)- this also lets you fly off the elevation for distance if you spot someone.
---
He actually tried but he was stuck in place lol
---
Could say the same for adrenaline, ds, borrowed time, quick and quiet, balanced landing, dead hard, head on....
---
cause of this rare situation? no
---
I jumped just from the video!
---
I’m also getting this error when I try to queue up as survivor and killer just searches for a match forever.
---
8k max per category * 4 = 32k? Unless I'm not understanding what you're trying to say..?
---
Same error. PC.
---
strongest hook pressure in the game, best basement pressure, only killer with aoe instadown. these very situational benefits have to be played to the highest level to make leatherface come out on top. This means the most optimal way to play him can be very campy and patrolly. If you can get someone in the basement, it's basically an easy win, but again, you'll have to surrender lots of gens and map pressure.
---
Add Legion too
---
No error yet but matches are taking forever and a fucking day to load.
---
That limits map pressure a lot and needlessly restricts the killer, if Freddy can constantly spam traps simply by refreshing as he pleases why would the demo not be able to do the same with portals? Being able to react to unhooks and gens as Freddy would would be great, if not Refresh portals at least allow him to place down 2 more, 8 sounds like a pefect number to me. I think right now it can only place 6?
---
Here the shirless trapper trapper link https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
Daaaamn, ain't that the TRUTH! XD
---
Wouldnt it just  be copy  and paste of the regular gamemode they have now? Just adding a code for 2v8 mode
---
I’ve noticed this happening more frequently too. I personally love playing against ghostface. I just had a round where one person dc’d and the other just let themselves die so killer let me survive
---
I find myself experiencing the lost item bug on PS4 very regularly, but it happens more often with high-rarity items for me!
---
Ps4 here. Same thing. Glad to see it is not just me. No idea of the cause.
---
Nice
---
i've been queuing as killer for over 45 minutes on pc, i just thought nobody wants to play with me
---
the thing that's killing me is i'm 5k away from completing the 200000 bloodpoints challenge. just let me play!!!

---
And with "this one" you mean yourself?
---
… man use those brain cells you normally have.
---
Killer having a weapon, survivors having pallets… that's the basic of the game.  Just like the basic for spidey is having his having his super strenght and the will to do good to correlate with the meme.
---
Prayer bead is overkill 'cause it adds a powerful add to Spirit whose basics are already something strong.
---
Just like Spiderman armor…
---
I think you have to buy it but idk
---
Had the issue, verified integrity, said all the files were fine so launched the game and now seems to be working. Might've just been a minor issue that's been sorted unless people are still having issues?
---
So basically you are proving my point with the portals and how you manage to adapt with having a powerless killer. You play Clown by chance? Cause that whole comment looks like something a Clown would say.
---
Like it or not, the game plan IS going to change the longer the match goes on and if you can't adapt because your power is useless you are pretty much fucked. Case in point Demo needs to be able to refresh like Freddy or have 2 more uses.
---
I would LOVE to use the doctor and trapper more.
---
But Id also like to not get taunted every step of the way and get looped forever.
---
Xbox one EU, i keep getting connection with host could not be established error
---
:(
---
Except prayer beads werent overkill, it was being able to collide with player models while phasing, but ofc bhvr goes full overkill and fucks both
---
I think not... I've seen people get it while it's free
---
People on this sub bitch and moan about people not doing bones and sabotaging hooks and say you’re gen rushing if you ignore those (even tho there is literally no reason to do anything other than gens if you’re free) 
---
GEN RUSHING IS NOT A THING 
---
The only people I see complaining about it are people who are bad at killer and can’t self reflect at all and find what their doing wrong. Or people who chase one survivor for the whole game and lose because they applied no pressure to gens. 
---
As someone who does well at killer and survivor, gen rushing isn’t real. There is nothing else for survivors to realistically do that isn’t a waste of time. When I see people doing dull totems while there’s gens left make me wanna shoot myself.
---

Can't even get into the game.
---
It just takes a few days for it to register that you have them, no worries.
---
Really give yourself the Treatment.
---
Your concept is really good.
---
I just think some perks should get buffed like "For the Greater Good" 'cause it's a end-game perk that will be user by other and not for you, get it?
---
Try to put in DBD forum to more people see your idea.
---
Are you from British
---
thanks a lot:)
---
I space portals around the map in semi covered places. So no matter where they run to I'll have transport nearby
---
PC EU can't find Lobby - if i find a lobby we can't find a Killer :)
---
Sssssh, it's only bullshit if Survivors have to go against it.
---
I played a couple of games. Game crashed. Now when I start the game it says "EAC client cannot be instantiated".
---
The ebony mori AND the ivory mori are broken. They both give you an easy win if you tunnel. With an ivory mori you just need to hook one survivor early, proxy camp, when he gets unhooked you go back, down him and now its a 3v1 at 5-4 gens. Gg after that.
---
Was getting lobbies without killer on steam-logged out, verified integrity, not can’t get a lobby.
---
Samesies
---
Yeah I closed it and reopened and it's there
---
PS4 EU, every time I try to play survivor I get a “could not connect to host” error and every time I try to play killer I can’t find a single match.
---
XBOX, EU, Error connecting to lobby... 😞
---
rework billy..?
---
PC / Survivor: I have been searching for a lobby for 30 minutes, now. I was able to play just fine before that. Tried restarting the game, no change.
---
Because every Survivor hears it, but they don't know if you're there or not.
---
It's essentially mapwide pressure since you start phasing and everyone thinks you are nearby.
---
Oh yeah, he is well-known for taking ideas or builds of others in the community and presenting them as oPtiMaL builds, which were invented by him after long and careful thinking. He gives credit to people only if he took the build from a well-known streamer. Other than that - nope.
---
So how was the post game chat ?
---
ditto
---
Just for the record, this efficiency with who or how you level up isn't too important. I used to do things like save items or offerings every match, but honestly as long as you hold M1 on gens and make sure to save people before they go into struggle on hooks, you'll get plenty to pretty much always be running an item/ offering every match.
---
Levelling a character to level 50 doesn't take too long. Maybe 3 hours or less if you're playing killer, or 5 if survivor. I was SUPER conservative with my items and offerings and who i levelled- looking back I felt like I was playing too safe. 
---
Dwight, Claudette, or Laurie; pick which one you want as a "main"
---
Claud or Laurie will be slightly more efficient if you stick to them. Claud has more options for cosmetics, but they're kind of known as the "noob" character. Laurie has only a few cosmetics, but you could always run the tier 1/2/3 prestige cosmetics. But it's unlikely you're gonna prestige at level 50 if you're trying to play efficient to start.
---
Level claud or laurie to level 40, then put your bloodpoints into dwight (and play him/ using his high bp offerings) until 30 (buy the orange teachable perk) then finish off levelling the final survivor to level 40.
---
You'll have all the perks and then you can pour bp into whichever you want, even a totally different survivor if you don't like using dwight/ claud/ laurie. Survivors are all personal preference but I know a lot of people like running females because they are smaller. Some are louder than others but it doesn't matter too much.
---
Pretty sure survivors only get notified when you get yo 3 stacks and exposed kicks in.
---
I’m always merciless, never give the hatch except in very rare occurences
---
Nurses calling and thana come with the nurse, a free killer. Then you can buy the hag and have ruin for the final build.
---
Buy I would recommend you going for barbecue and chilli because then the grind falls to the half
---
PC - UK. The connection with the host could not be established.
---
I can't find a lobby on PS4, says connection with host cannot be established. On PC I waited for a long time for a lobby, then decided to restart the game. Now I can't even start the game, says EAC cannot be initiated or game version invalid. Any fixes I try don't work.
---
You see, i used to only play survivor actually, but with the recent changes it has become so boring, before atleast if you met a nurse/spirit it would be a challenge, now its like no matter what its more or less free, unless you met that 1 godlike players every 400 games... Also if you are refering to my flair i thought it would be obvious that its an ironic flair
---
Gotcha ty sir
---
The pip
---
Who hurt you so bad that you can't just leave something people enjoy alone?
---
Oh yeah. Or simply dismissing these ideas when people tell them that certain builds or perks are going to work, implying in his answer that the people who suggested it are less smart than he is. 
---
Week later - what do you know, he is running that same suggested  build, claiming that he invented it. Ascended, honestly.
---
Infinite "Looking for Lobby" even if you unready, still there.
---
PC, North America, Version mismatch. I have reinstalled the game, verified game files, and even tried swapping from live to ptb, and back again. Nothing has worked.  
---
"The game version is [invalid](https://i.imgur.com/HHnAEo0.png). Please update to a valid version."
---
&gt; So basically you are proving my point with the portals and how you manage to adapt with having a powerless killer.
---
I'm saying liberal use of his portals shoots his main strength in the foot. I've mained demo for a month after his release (until dedicated servers hit; he's felt really bleh with it) and I've literally had a big issue running out of portals. I've always had 1 or 2 more than I really needed, even with add-ons
---
He's nowhere near "useless" if you have all your portals out. Just don't put all your portals on one side of the map.
---
If you have [this pattern](https://i.imgur.com/ji3wPjo.png) on most maps you're dandy
---
looking for lobby on both sides (surv/killer) in EU on PC
---
No other exhaustion perk was as situational either. Exhaustion was already nerfed and was fine the way it was. Exhaustion add ons on the other hand are still a thing. They are also not as hard to deal with as people claim. How any of them are still talked about is beyond me.
---
PS4 in Australia. Killer cannot start a lobby (just looks for one forever) and survivor says that it can't connect to lobby shortly after searching every time.
---
Agreed haddonfield should be fixed but it takes more time than tweaking numbers. It might have a compensatory buff after an haddonfield rework. And if I understood it correctly, the killer doesn't decide everybody's connection, and that's why its like that. Only pretty laggy players will make hitboxes look fucked though on their screen it was an 100% legit hit. Pretty sure they can make something to verify both sides to make sure it really  was a hit but then laggy players would get fucked over it... Doesn't look too easy to fix and dedicated servers can't fix that afaik

If survivors are doing gens away from your portals you’re not making best portal placement.

In Middle eastern server , you can't queue as killer. The survivor can queue to empty rooms without a killer ever joining.

Just curious, is anyone here using **Alienware** and/or **Killer Wireless**?

I’ve been having a TON of issues with Killer Wireless and the newer Windows 10 updates. Constant lag spikes and rubber banding. Seems to be an issue a lot of people have with Killer Wireless gear. I can barely play Survivor/Killer with how frequent the skips are.

Just wondering if anyone else is having issues before I finalize the purchase on a new Wifi Card.

PC in Australia; wondered what was going on and if it was just my end. Glad to know it ain't just our crap internet that stops us from finding games
---
Tfw my suggestion to reduce queue time gets a small fraction of this shitpost
---
Same here - ps4 NA
---
Try now guys I'm in a lobby eu xbox
---
Is deliverance bugged at the moment?
---
To each their own then. I actially play nearly all genres.
---
Yeah, i'm fine with it as well. I was just wondering if it's still used as much pop.
---
Also if the killer is face camping with noed i'll look for a bit, if I can't find it within 30 seconds i'm yeeting out the gate too. If they're slugging with it i'm out right away.
---
I posted this same bug yesterday in which me as the Oni couldn't get through similar doorways on Haddonfield as seen in this video, but it got taken down because "bug reports shouldn't be posted here" and "your post encourages people to exploit the faulty game design"
---
I always tap a thrill of the hunt totem if the killer is a prayer beads Spirit. She wants to be annoying so I am
---
Mrs myers is dummy thicc
---
This post seems like someone who DC's when first downed
---
you gonna wait 50 seconds before you touch the gen?
---
I've had times where the killers connection was so bad it forced us all to dc, or we were all being rubberbanded. Can't say it's my connection, cause my friends live in different cities (some states) and they get it too.
---
Yeah, it takes a lot more work to fix Haddonfield, but nerfing BL instead of Haddonfield is the equivalent of slapping a band-aid on a gunshot wound.
---
While we're at it though, talking about wonky things in the game, what's your opinion on the totem spawn locations on Hawkins?
---
Bugs, exploits, unbalanced features, toxicity: i sleep
---
Rotating killers: REAL SHIT?
---
I'm gonna wait enough for the killer to check the gen and move to another.
---
Loving it! Given how the last film ended, we may see something like this.
---
Wiki says it always has been TR
---
it wouldd be so awesome to see a female Myers if done right!
---
Is it free on Steam? Or is it Xbox? I’ve been desperate for the game for a month
---
They should just take Adrenalin and Noed out of the game, both are extreamly unfun perks to play against

Oh, thanks for the info, I've changed it now

Had the same issue. I deleted the EAC folder in the DbD folder, then verified the game files and now it works. Though this hasn't worked for everyone.
---
i'VE BEEN RICKROLLED 4 TIMES TODAY w8e793243
---
You are taking the words out of my mouth
---
I never scratch my nose outside of dbd
---
We haven’t been able to find any games for the last hour and a half
---
Yeah maybe that would work. hopefully killer bonks another gen with less than 25%. Else its the same, killer gains 25 sec more time. But i agree its the best option
---
No. It takes me most of the time ~15secs to find a lobby on PC.
---
I cannot connect to host at all
---
You did a good job. Is that so surprising?
---
Did you try deleting the whole EAC folder, then verify the files? That worked for me.
---
If they have TOTH tap it once every chase, chances are they'll abandon chase to go and defend it
---
I keep getting the message, Connection with host could not be established. Please try again. Maybe something wrong with the servers
---
Holy shit every time!
---
I’ve attempted too, I’m on XBOX EU. I get “Join Game Failure” followed by “Connection with host could not be established”.
---
You know what? Fair enough. I'll revert it to how it was originally. All tokens reset after the third one ends.
---
Something is wrong I have been queueing as survivor for over twenty minutes now... Playing in EU.
---
This comment is proof that some people genuinely do need the /s to recognise if it's a joke or not.  
---
Stay ~~on the spectrum~~ classy, Reddit.
---
Server issues apparently and no communication from the devs whatsoever
---
Same I’m currently getting this issue
---
i'm so glad i decided to look on reddit to see if others had the same. i've been waiting for a lobby for ages but can't find anything.

I want Big Wheel as a killer.

and lets be real. i don't care if the survivors had fun. I'm not the devs. its not my job to make sure everyone had fun. its my job to win and make sure i had fun. and tbh survivors are the buggest entitled shit heads, so hearing them bitch in end game chat makes me happy

I’d use it only with prayer beads they will keep trying to cleanse means easy grabbing

It isn’t lol??? The que time is just awfull.
---
I’m still versing nurses a couple times a day. Maybe not as many but I’m still seeing them. They’re more than likely players who never used add ons?
---
I would love some buff, like when you touch a portal or walk near one you get hindered or exhausted for 60 seconds, 
---
Also if oni can insta break pallets so should Demogorgon.
---
Shouldn’t be using self care anyway, it wastes to much time.

Sadly only about 25% of killer perks are worth using.

Awful killer, long overdue a remake like Freddy,
---
It's 15% speed increase if you wonder how much
---
So sad
---
its real
---
But there is right now. Check the servers. Killers cannot find a match and survivors get error.
---
I see someone's a salty survivor main
---
Ah that makes sense. I've been siting "looking for a match" as survivor for 30 mins on PC UK
---
what happened? survivors queues used to be instant for me, woke up today and its taking god knows how long.
---
"he has to be nice to us now!" You poor naive fool.
---
I think the reason a lot of ppl struggle to level it up is cos of the ratio of swf to get into games. Solo and possibly 4mans are more likely to get faster games and faster ability to level it up compares to say 2-3swf who wait ages for slots to open or lobbies to fill. In that time they waited  solo and 4mans have already played and so they’re quicker to level up. That’s what I think anyway
---
I always do that sadly no one is friendly
---
God damn, shut up you absolute brainlet.
---
Aight but that’s not what this is about🤣
---
Oh, I've had multiple games (all against Freddy) where I've safe rescued, perk lit up, and when attempting to unhook the luck icon appear, but to no use. It just Acts like I'm attempting without the perk.
---
I... I'm honestly speechless... The amount of stupidity in this video simply blew my mind
---
R/donthelpjustfilm Technically
---
Tutorials to counter killers?  No thank you.  Unless your gonna show every pallet/loop in every map to the killer and teach them how to counter that too.
---
dunno about you guys, but Trapper's tiddy makes me kinda HORNYYYY
---
Anything for survivors is usually "dealt with" at red levels,anything lower than red these perks are all very good.
---
I probably would've said ''You... You guys are fucking idiots''. Just for the sake of it
---
So are pop, sloppy, ruin and BBQ...

Awesome work. Loved this

It's funny because survivors are doing better on high ranks according to stats so that's not really true then is it.

oozzyskwid?? like the csgo pro???
---
Downvote all you want.I use Inner Strength down to maybe Rank 12,after that I find it difficult to find a second totem for a second heal
---
Wait ... are portals invisible when not activated ?
---
I try to step outside my perk comfort zone but then when there’s no gen defense I get “Skillfully M1’d” cause my first chase took more than 16 seconds.
---
They arent doing better based on perks they are doing better because they are better. I'm good on continuing this debate though
---
people talking about prayer beads all the time, but forgetting how crazy the Yakuyoke Amulet and Wakizashi Saya are.
---
No i am perfect lol
---
“Way to exploit loops, no skill”
---
“You abused the [any game design] bug, such skill”
---
“You had to use an insta heal? Garbage player”
---
“You clearly never play killer or you know [X Y or Z] is an unfair exploit”
---
And generally any of the other toxic insults that are completely unrelated to game based stuff.
---
Also, had a billy down our last survivor today and just force them to sit on the ground until their timer ran out. In the chat he just goes “way to abuse the 4% bug faggot” and we were all confused. He starts going on about how looping him in the end game was toxic when he refused to break a single pallet during the chase, these weren’t even safe pallets, they were like, the 4 foot stone walls on temple of purgation or whatever. Still confused and salty from that guy.
---
I would argue that pop+ruin on spirit or Billy is not.
---
This. If you're in a locker your team can just do gens while you sit there waiting to grab them. Less map pressure.
---
Nice to know, thanks !
---
Only a few months ago, I just realised that this picture is based on the burned photo offering
---
It may be, it just always seems to activate whenever I’m doing a gen or just near it
---
Bruh moment #71
---
Nope, hook juggling was a thing. It isn't anymore. Now you just have to slug.
---
Solo is trash unless you practice alot
---
If you think 15 seconds is making noticable progress against a killer who has a build, built around slowing down generator progression you're a fool. Freddy with surveillance knows the second you touch a generator and can be on you instantly. 
---
"survivor meta perks" half of these so called meta perks have already been nerfed and removed from play, or are only useful at the end of the game.
---
To be fair, 4 killer games you meet 16 different people, where as 4 survivor games you only run into 4 killers, so that has to do something
---
I’ve seen this 3 times now. Feels like op might’ve not made this

Ah yes, the Black Plague. As we all know, the Black Plague, scientifically known as baljeetus deletus, was created by baljeet from the popular tv show phineas and ferb which itself was a commentary on medieval Europe around the time of King BumTum the two-thirds. Baljeet synthesized this deadly bacteria from the brain of his bully, which he then combined with acidic gamma radiation given off by ferb when he shite liquid nitrogen. Baljeet did this to infect the white man and exterminate the Jews along with anyone who likes mayonnaise. Curse you baljeet, curse you.

I would begin searching for a match and would go grab a snack and would come back to it still searching. So I go to unready to search a match again but the, "looking for match", stays whether I'm ready or not.

I suppose sarcasm can be hard to read on text form...

I mean just because he has the oblivious effect doesn’t mean he’s a stealth killer- the whole point if his oblivious with a lullaby is to make his approach non-directional.

Demogorgon looking fly
---
Why do you live at mount Ormond resort?
---
This is exactly why we need a rework to gen speed and/or secondary objective for Survivors.  
---
You either play a boring game with slowdown, or there's a 50% chance 3 gens will pop before you get your first hook.
---
Obviously if they DO change the objectives, slowdown perks should be reworked as well.

Or the basic bitch build

Any ETA on this ?

PC EU , can't find a god damn match, I'm only rank 15 and usually find a match under 1 min, but it's been 15 minutes and nothing
---
Exactly. Thank you
---
I love playing totem games when the killer is using toth. You can waste a lot of their time. Spine chill, distortion, iron will and calm spirit to be sure you're never found.
---
It soon gets personal between you and the killer...
---
I've had some games like this too, I remember one match in particular I was playing Trapper and was put on the medical ward map (can't remember the name of it but the one with the TV screens and equipment in the middle of the map). Anyways, basement was in the center area and these survivors were hell bent on unhooking others the second I got one. Fast forward a few chases and I manage to nab two near basement and hook both down there, I figured they'd attempt another escape so I trapped the stairs leading down to basement and around the hooks.
---
In no more than *FIVE* seconds did I get a trap trigger and unhook, followed by another trap and unhook. All four survivors were now injured or trapped in basement and only two gens done. The game ended soon after, I'm sure you can guess how.
---
But these perks are a pain in the ass if the user can be optimal with it. That means skill + situation or coordination. Low rank will not pull that off.
---
Corn field. Home.
---
At least it was, before i fucked up.
---
From reading that it reminded me of me and my friends chanted "BILL NYE THE NAZI SPY" in summer school it was fun :P
---
Damn bro, is it that serious???
---
I just said hes a fun killer to play.   Compare him to the trapper let's say. Or hillbilly. So boring.  Hell even the spirit is boring to me.
---
I spent like 20 mins waiting for a game, no bueno...

I like how he actually looks like an ogre, makes the whole Oni vibe fitting.

---
never felt more related to a meme in my life.
---
Solo survivor works by making it so that any aura reading perks that the killer may use against you becomes worse the more survivors that are dead.
---
Every time a survivor dies in the match, it increases the minimum distance to see your aura by 24 meters.
---
For example lets take the most common killer aura reading perk, BBQ &amp; Chilli.
---
When a survivor is hooked, you see the aura of survivors 40m away from the hook. 
---
For sole survivor, if 2 survivors were dead it would mean that it would protect you from BBQ aura reading within 48 meters. If you are more than 48 meters from the hook then you would still have your aura seen.
---
Sole survivor main purpose is for countering aura reading perks that have a relatively short range such as Nurses calling or special builds like Scratch mirror Myers/All Seeing Wraith. 
---
It can also be used with Object of Obsession. 
---
Object of obsession allows you to see the killers aura outside of their T.R within 64 meters. 72 if your the obsession.
---
Since most killers have a 32m T.R, you could theoretically use Object of Obsession with Sole survivor to see the killer without them seeing your aura if you have atleast 2 dead survivors. 
---
Could be devastating with stealthier killers like Myers or killers with less than 32 meter T.R. Combining Object and Sole with a dead survivor in your team could allow you to see them without them seeing your aura.
---
Overall Sole is pretty poor as it requires your team to be dead.
---
Indeed, it's kind of a vicious circle how people learn to tryhard at this game but in the end all good things in entertainment die when casuals get things changed for their convenience so I'm okay with it
---
Umm, so are all of the perks in the OP?
---
PS4 NA, unable to find a match as an error that states I am unable to establish a connection with the host
---
My bad then... most videos I've seem looked like the windows were more likely to hold you nicely in the same spot for 1 sec so Oni could have an easier time aiming his club instead of actually helping you juke him
---
I completely understand Ruin, but there's no way NOED is a "necessary evil". It is still a perk that is designed to help the killer get 1 or 2 kills they otherwise wouldn't have gotten.
---
While I get the idea of gen speeds are too fast against good survivors and so on, killers are still very capable of killing most or all survivors before the end game. If you always have to rely on NOED to get the majority of your kills in the match, you aren't as great of a killer as you think you are most likely.
---
This is why it's the first cosmetic I got with my serum. Just the overalls! I didn't need the mask. Only nipple.
---
Yeah, it just makes me wonder how one video of a bug is fine, but another video of the same bug is taken down
---
Same. Ps4 EU
---
PC // EU
---
Can’t even launch the game, “no network connection”.
---
OK fine, let me spell it out for you in really simple terms.
---
With your original statement "If I camp the hooked survivor I'll win," if someone responds "pretty sure it doesn't" then what is "it"? What are you specifically referring to? Sure, you could TRY and argue "it" refers to the killer making the original statement but it's still confusing at best and at worst ignores the gender of the player or the killer (Demogorgon being the only killer that could be an "it" specifically). Not to mention the confusion over what "it" doesn't do. Win? That isn't specifically stated.
---
In order for this meme to make grammatical sense, either the initial statement would have to read "if I camp the survivor on hook, that means I will win" (thank you u/Y0cub) OR Keanu's response would have to be "pretty sure you won't." Either way modifies the subject to be the implication of a win by hook camping.
---

Dead hard, adrenaline and sprint burst are far more powerful than something like bbq.

I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I would want anyone who's genuinely a good entertainer to have a wide audience. But there's always a risk when you put your name/face out there. That's just how life is. If you think you're good/funny enough to broadcast yourself doing it, then you run the risk of people wanting to troll or test your skills. entertainers/performers run into this all the time. It's how they react that can make or break a situation. And to be completely honest, most of the people in general who stream nowadays just aren't that interesting to listen to. Doing stuff like that can give them something to riff off of or make something entertaining. It's all in good fun.

Infinite match searching for both survivor and killer. Been waiting over an hour for each side
---
PS4, on killer can’t find match; on survivor cannot connect to host. This has been going on since at least 6:30am est
---
Solution: temporarily disable killer archive challenges or rebalance archives so they're survivor oriented. This would bring more to play survivor andò shorten killer queues.
---
That's my boy Meyers. Never change.
---
oh I always give hatch to the last survivor, unless they were a dickhead in game lol. I'll save a survivor I like and wait for the third to die
---
Or big brain play on switch where theres no leatherface
---
Maybe because playing against a killer that forces you to have permanent No Mither for the match because the alternative is a Huntress with a flamethrower...isn't fun?
---
Real talk I'd rather play vs (current) Prayer Beads Spirit every game than one more Plague match, ever.
---
Yeah I don't really care about bbq, and you are right that there are some cool healing tools for survivors, but sb, adrenaline and DH (dedicated servers) is not as powerful as ruin+pop.
---
Cant wait to use distressing + new prayer beads on the spirit. It will be so fun and confusing
---
Adrenaline is active for 5 seconds of the end game. NOED is active for as long as that totem is up, besides NOED's speed boost is a lot stronger than people think it is, they always assume it's the exposed effect that makes the perk strong when it's the permanent bloodlust 1 it gives you that really makes it hard to go against.
---
The 2 perks also aren't equivalent. One activates when you successfully complete all the gens, one activates when you fail to protect all the gens.
---
The meta perks of survivors is changing inner strengh and this perks are going to be competence to adrenaline, borrow time, dh, bl, pebble
---
So are you saying DS, Head on, and Q&amp;Q are bullshit?

I actually found White Noise 2 to scratch that spooky horror aspect, but granted I only had about 3 hours in it total.

Killer downs me after a 2min chase then I see teammates not on a gen.... just standing around or running around. What are y'all doing? Am I right? Lol
---
Lol yes!!! So fucking true.
---
That’s all they ever do. Every single fucking time.  They just sit behind a wall somewhere and watch the hook. Its the lamest thing in the entire fucking game. I’d take Prayer beads over this shit anyday.
---
I think a lot of frustration with GF also comes from the fact that the reveal mechanic just feels entirely random. Most of the tome you’ll be 8m in front of him staring right at him and it wont even start to reveal him, then sometimes he’ll be 30m away and you catch a glimpse of his head alone and it instantly reveals. It frustrates players when they try to reveal him, it just doesnt work, then bam they’re exposed to some sad twat whose been camping the hook the entire time.
---
What an awful, unfun killer. Sure wraiths camp too but at least he cant insta-attack without uncloaking nor can he “expose” survivors
---
Pretty sure they nerfed that too

While I don't play DBD on my PC much (due to the game hating my PC) I know that M&amp;K makes it easier to aim, I still find playing DBD with a remote easier. Though this is me and probably me alone due to me always playing consoles as a child. I don't see an issue if people just git gud. Though the potato frame rate on consoles is a fucking issue when you end up getting bloodlust.
---
As a Billy main,  I'm still going to play Billy because I don't like how strong Oni is and as A survivor main (but when I play killer it's Billy) I do think billy is strong but has counterplay
---
Will the death garden masks be available for everyone?
---
Tomb Raider? Because that's what I immediately thought of
---
You can’t spin the speed pc spins red rank survivors on pc will tank killers and pc killers will love console survivors especially running around with that charge
---
Anybody know where to get the latest updates, if any?
---
Do we check back with this thread or somewhere else? Went to the BHVR forums for the first time, and saw the notice banner, but I didn't see a megathread or anything.
---
Glad to read these comments its not just me that hates him. GF players seem to be the biggest pieces of shit. Well, Freddy players too from my experience.
---
I cant recall ever seeing a single Gf since launch who either doesnt camp the hook in stealth or hard tunnel survivors out of the game. Hes strong too so he gets a lot of use.
---
Right?!
---
Servers are down
---
Underrated with his version of the instasaw add ons. An instadown is more than most other killers have. Throw in PWYF too and he can be very dirty.
---
And basement bubba is always a guilty pleasure
---
Whoever knows this cosplayer, please tag her, cause she’s amazing!!!
---
Are you saying Thana, Dying Light, or pop are bullshit?
---
beautiful, add the DuckTales Moon theme for perfection.
---
2 perks can be countered by not tunneling. 1 only triggers if they repair all generators. And the exhaustion perk? Yes, you have to play against it every match... f
---
Yes good very good spend the game injured I approve of this plan we should stay on generators while injured because healing is a waste of time and I’m absolutely not a Wraith main that gets free downs because of this
---
damn that's cool I don't remember asking though
---
Red rank is hell on any platform. I drown in the sweat.
---
People dc because they are pissed off. It is just a rage quit. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
Snake
---
Kinda rude man. I was posting so that people who haven't seen it, can see it.
---
Why did you capitalize every word
---
Yeah, too
---
Im gonna have so much fun with Nemesis. It fits right in on so many builds for different killers!
---
I said the samething. It looks awful. Fun fact, all of Bubba's perks look the same and have his quotes dispite the fact that he's not in the Switch version anyways
---
Bbq can be countered by not camping, or hiding in a locker
---
SB: bring a med kit. Or botany.
---
As for pop, it’s one of the few perks that helps slow gen rushing down. 
---
Hex is also a must up until reds, tbh I don’t even use hex I bring corrupt intervention.
---
You want to know how trans people get treated? By transitioning. So let me do what I need to in peace.
---
PC AUS, waited half an hour before giving up in a 3 man swf and 15 minutes on my own before finding this thread
---
She's staring at us! Quickly scroll down to the comments before she hits tier 3!
---
I have seen this in a couple games. I really thought it was just me/lag. Exploit?
---
Because we’re real man you don’t get us
---
Best strat for me is the video tape and an addon for more traps, or Amanda's letter if you have it. That way you can sneak everywhere and find people, and take full advantage of your charge
---
Quick guys let's demand a bloodhunt before they fix the servers
---
Yeah I play ghostface and its just disappointing to see how people play him..
---
Very much indeed :/ dang, I really, really don't like this guy. Such a buffoon.
---
Tell BHVR to fix perk balancing and make other perks more interesting to use.
---
He probably didn't mean full on counter, but just explain what the hell each killer does in an interactive way.   
---
Might be nice for the newbies so they don't end up having a goddamn staring contest with myers like I did.
---
Its not meta in higher ranks because teammates heal you consistently. It has nothing to do with deciding to stay injured for the rest of the game.
---
I think with ebony you should only get to use it if the surv is on their death hook, makes more sense imo, they'll die either way at that point if you manage to down them.
---
Problem is that a lot of ghostface players are bitches. They'll just sit there and camp the hook and then tunnel the guy off the hook.
---
Is this an ad?
---
Luckily our .2% perks are way stronger than their 25%
---
PS4 / EU it says that I have a problem with my connection to the host
---
My Xbox keeps shutting itself off whenever I try to join a game. Is anybody else experiencing the same issue or something similar? FYI, I'm just playing on the standard XB1.
---
on a fucking sunday.... unbelievable... PC EU... over 10 mins: no killer lobby...
---
mEaNiE
---
Always feel like such a dick when I literally have to down them, bring them to a gen hit it, and they still run off.
---
I dunno, I dont play that much
---
sis she's awesome!
---
D A R N
---
Oni has bad early game, while billy can start chainsawing from the start, that's why i don't think he's op. But his power charges quickly, and once he sees a survivor with his power there's nothing a survivor can do... doesn't mean he's op, but there's literally no counter to his power, unlike to billy's. 
---
So yes, what i'm saying is he's kindof like spirit. Nothing you can do in 1v1, but he can be beaten in 1v4, which is   
---
 still bad. Because it really sucks to literally be able to do nothing in a chase, no matter how good you are at looping as survivor, that's why people dc against spirit.
---
Cry some more baby. Go play something else for a bit till it is up. Servers crash sometimes. Thats the way of the world. Shit breaks and it gets fixed.
---
Inner strength. I never play without it now. It’s saved my ass as Meg so many times. Pair it with Quick And Quiet and you’ll rarely have to worry about quickly entering a locker.
---
I would love one but honestly i see the sarcasm in this and i agree ppl need to chill
---
As a nice survivor, it really hurts that I can't disagree.
---
Been searching for an hour on PC, good job I was tabbed out and forgot I was even searching
---
It's been down for over 2 hours
---
Its Ok Blood Is Just The Sands Of Time Bringing Death Closer.
---
Oh so it's a bug. I sat in 20 min queue as survivor. Figured something was wrong
---
This makes me miss unbreakables icon before we got bill lol
---
Self care is actually a secret killer perk.
---
problems started already yesterday
---
Oh so it's cool when survivor can t bag but bullshit when killer does it?
---
I'm actually not that great with Spirit ... I get a lot more "GG ez" messages with her if I don't do well because everyone assumes Spirit = Good. 
---
I'm significantly better with Trapper and Freddy. I can deny loops with traps and snares, but I'm not good at predicting where the survivor is heading with Yamaoka's Hunting.
---
Sure they are meta but...
---
Ds is not as good as people think it is.. it just gives you one 'out'. But it is fun to use. Good survivors actually find themselves trying to get caught just to use it so they don't waste the perk/stun. It is only good for a direct tunnel or bad teammates.
---
Adrenaline is only really top level with Swf and good timing.
---
BL, DH, Lithe all just sprint perks. Useful to have one but not op. A good survivor can play using any of them
---
I haven't used head on so no comment. Just seems like a troll perk with ds.
---
Quick and quiet can be good. Borrowed time is obviously a very good perk but I don't think its op.
---
I literally have no other mp game to play
---
DBD lobbies have been buggy since its launch. I guess we should just never launch dbd again under your advice.
---
Come join us then
---
Same issue happening to me. On the PS4. Really annoying cause I wanted to play but whatever. Worked fine six hours ago. How long are you gonna take though to fix it
---
I thought the rain sounded like josuke for a second there..
---
Come on then
---
Not gonna work if it is Monto as killer 🤭
---
Susie here Can confirm
---
Joey here shes mine
---
Freddy
---
Hillbilly
---
Hillbilly’s chainsaw is too difficult to maneuver with, and Trapper NEEDS to have the ability to carry more than one bear trap to be effective. Legion can either be great for a game or terrible with, depending on the survivors (if they stay separate, then Discordance is practically useless). Freddy provides you with jump scares, maneuverability, and techniques to slow survivors down.
---
Bro, when are we going to get normal claudette cosmetics? :c This claud here just looks like something straight up outta strip club
---
No you're legoin
---
PC, SEA. Legit only had 2 match as a killer in the last 5 hours. I think I've this problem since around 1700, GMT+7.
---
Since then I can't find a match as a killer. When I switch to survivor, there're other surv but no killer.
---
The developer don’t get us they’re wrong
---
Thank you for telling me^^
---
Okay legoin
---
Wow! I like the way you worked with that mask! But I have to ask how you did the head carved like a pumkin?
---
I’m the one typing its like you don’t want to get us
---
Weirdly a big part of the fun of playing killer is helping out all the little babies who're at your mercy. For me, a game is best when it's fun for all and there's someone at the end who's played well that I can reward with survival. If you're friendly to me it's nice to be friendly back sometimes.
---
No legoin doesn't have joey it has jeoy
---
I hate green ranks more than red. I usually sit around rank 3-6  and things are far less toxic there than green. I don’t know whether it’s because players topped at green are at the point where they care too much and equate toxicity to being good but damn do I hate it there.
---
I've got no problems with noed or anything in the game.... but it isn't really the equivalent of adrenaline just because it activates at the gates.
---
Adrenaline is way more situational.
---
You just reminded me I've been tabbed out of DBD for about half an hour...I'm still queuing xD
---
Okay is just the unsureness of death
---
you mean since months ago... when it takes 5-7 mins to find a lobby? xD
---
Mmm what about all male killer get a shirtless cosmetic such as the clown ,Ghostface,Micheal
---
Funny enough I bought him at the convention I was at, a Nightmare Toys both was selling it on display and I knew I had to have it even if my Michelle isnt a H18 LOL
---
Normally I'm the baby since I'm always paired with pros and they always get me killed by being toxic and the killer never feels bad.
---
I do not understand people who insist on self caring, especially with things like sloppy active. Leaving teammates to go to struggle on first hook or even die on second hook because they usually prioritise it even when they know someone else is getting chased or whatever. I love people who use it when I'm playing killer though.   
---
I agree with you, I take adren so that if there is only a gen or 2 left I'd rather just use the time more effectively getting the gen done and getting the heal from that. Either that or I'll take inner strength and keep an eye out for totems. Self care is just bad for the team.
---
Yup, I cant connect to  a lobby in Europe.
---
That is my exact build on spirit down to the perk locations lmao
---
Are you dumb? Its Joey
---
Good thing this is happening this weekend and not next weekend. I also got my 1 million BP saved.
---
"Survivors are cool when they tbag" literally not a single fucking soul ever
---
It will be up in the day. Yeah buggy but it is playable. It's ridiculous to see ppl this mad. Fucking stupid
---
Is it weird that I'm turned on?
---
Can you not? Stop commenting all over this post. It’s cringe.
---
First it’s “Joey here” then it’s “Susie here”, and the edgy capitalized sentences, just stop.
---
You are worthy to join us because you get us
---
Very cooool
---
We’ll if gens didnt pop so quickly there wouldn’t be a need to bring ruin and Pop. 
---
Hide in a locker if you dont like BBQ 4head. Everyone uses it for extra BP and you can find hatch campers with it too. 
---
And doesn’t Sloppy Butcher only add 3 secs to healing? You’re better off with STBFL or Plagues scream perk.
---
They both give an increase in speed, they both affect health states ( one insta downs and the other insta heals) and they both activate at end game. 
---
Noed counters adrenaline.
---
Yeah I feel you done the same, hopefully servers fixed soon
---
https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR
---
You can’t stop a cause dude
---
Confirmed servers bugged atm
---
Legion has Joey
---
Legoin has Jeoy
---
Are you sure I'm the dumb person here?
---
Why everyone is mad about flashlight at pallets? I use them at pallets to sneak away with iron will because I'm not really good at looping.
---
No need to judge she looks cute asf
---
You understand us join us
---
And then everybody laughs.
---
I don’t know how to feel about this
---
Yeah, just checked twitter
---
YOU GOT BAMBOOLIZED
---
Just say yes man
---
this may be a stupid question but how is the exit gate blocked off?
---
I accept your invitation
---
What do i have to do to become one of you?
---
I shall now commit stab
---
agreed
---
PC, US since about 7am EST. Started with the EAC issues, verified game files/reinstalled EAC multiple times and that eventually went away, now can't find a game at all. "Searching for lobby" or whatever it says lingers when I deselect it.
---
Make your mask and be edgy
---
Literally the only time I get to play this weekend. Perfect.
---
Idk about the lore stuff but auras on survivors would be pretty badass, probably a giant disadvantage but fuck it.
---
Man, if only there was some counter play available.
---
First though become edgy and make a mask
---
How many times have you played as her? She's definitely not insta-win like everybody likes to try and say.
---
Maybe u/fighrin
---
5 minute mending again? Mooooom!
---
I´m sure this will unleash a new trend on dbdgonewild, and I think I´ll participate
---
To bad wraith sucks
---
Laugh cry emoji mask is my choice
---
Why would you say that ? I never noticed and my OCD isn't pleased
---
Good its deep like us
---
As someone said, noed is a gift. Adrenaline is a reward. The noed speed increase is better. Adrenaline speed is only useful if you are mid chase. Adrenaline won't do anything if you've had a good game. 
---
One instaheals once, the other instadowns continuously.
---
I personally enjoy the challenge of noed. But it is a bitch perk and I can see why people don't like it. It isn't really comparable to adrenaline imo. I personally don't think adrenaline is that good outside of Swf teams with planned timing.
---
I really like to run enduring and spirit fury, it is basically a guaranteed hit, and survivors almost never expect it
---
That's 60 seconds of just slugging use them as bait if you have nurse's calling that's what I do.
---
could you do me a favor and point out where I said that
---
I don't mind them, but some more choice /customisability would be nice
---
 good for you...
---
PHINEAS AND FERB ARE STARTING AN EDGY TEEN GANG AGAIN!
---
DS is kinda broken in its current state, but don’t expect anyone here to come to your side. Just watch any streamer and they will tell you how much it sucks. Otz even had a video about it release today.
---
Every hallowed blight sweaty spirit
---
I'm shocked there isn't one comment about wanting shirtless Myers.
---
I always felt like Noed punishes survivors for not cleansing totems. And every killer perk is a gift?killer perks are supposed to help the killer win, like nurses calling, bbq, discordance ect
---
would be cool and would give a little more buzz for the Evil Within since the 2nd one kind of flopped
---
I think I might just be that scary LMAO
---
How did you vault that 3 times and didn't get it blocked?
---
That means you bought the Pig dlc but you bought Freddy with auric cells
---
Yeah, it sucks hard when that happens: especially when the killer is just going hard for that 4k.
---
I'll let you go if we ever come across one another, how about that? ;)
---
Its really not worth taking anymore. There are way better perks even if it is fairly meta.
---
Petition to add him
---
What do you play on? I'm Xbox player and I'm Assassincat777 and I'm a ash main but not a high level
---
Couldn’t agree more
---
If it bothers you that much, just think about it and wait 10 seconds. If you're hooking people that fast, you've already won anyway.
---
Lmao old DS was wayyy better. What rock have you been hiding under?
---
My issue is not being able to find lobbies for survivor or killer; rank 7/8 respectively UK. 
---
Any estimate time of fix?
---
If you can afford to eat DS, you shouldn't have to eat DS.
---
Ah, I'm on PC. Maybe one day if we get crossplay, huh
---
OCE PC, two times i found lobbies and it was 5 survivors and no killer (bugged lobby). We would connect then 'escape' immediately because there was no killer immediatey so everyone got 5k bp. After that, unable to find any lobbies as killer or survivor. My friend was unable to search for a match and had the error that connection to host was disconnected or something.
---
Really great costume.
---
By the way it's weird, that mask looks scary, yes, but at the same time the face is really beautiful.
---
Just because its meta in mid ranks doesn't mean its a good perk. It is just a troll perk that is fun to use
---
Is that why it's taking me half an hour to find a game? Dammit, and I just bought ghost face too, wanted to try him out
---
The weird reality of doctor is that you really want to hold off on using his power sometimes. 
---
-You want to REALLY save that madness 1 proc because it’s a free chase start which helps your early game (and later setups, such as use of MYC)
---
-Shocking survivors at loops is very dependent on the loop itself as well as survivor knowledge (dropping pallets early, or keep running the loop and the shock basically didn’t do anything on some tiles because the doc is slower in shock mode, etc.)
---
-Using your time to put them in madness 3 isn’t really worth it when you could just down them, the time a good survivor spends breaking out of madness 3 is negligible and often a net loss on time in most cases
---
All you really need is madness 2 assuming you’re running the Restraint add-on series, and maybe rarely shock if you can get that perfect distance from a survivor and they’re headed to a window to interrupt their vault
---
Yeah :/ I used to play it on PC I had some fun but holy shit Every one is toxic
---
Lol found the new player
---
Really man ive been sitin in the lobby for a FUCKIN HOUR
---
As a no skill new S-tier ghostface killer I’m sure you would approve
---
the virgin regular killer run vs the chad Myers *stride*
---
(and the Hag scamper in second place)
---
Why is my screen red
---
CALL ON MEEEEEEE ON ME
---
I play both sides (although I do consider myself a survivor main) and I fucking hate when people on my team have it but when I play killer it's soooooo good.
---
he is invisible so u can go and camp but kindred will reveal you
---
Bad.  Ass.
---
They should all stay in the game. I wish this community would stop bitching. 
---
Without the 2 this game would be a lot more stale.
---
Bit gross, isn't it. I've not come across a lot of toxicity in game chat, but one thing I've noticed is losing as killer is a lot more humiliating than losing as survivor somehow. Survivors seem more toxic than killers in my experience.
---
Perhaps, though part of what helps make ruin reliably at slowing the early rush down is that you have one or more survivors spending that time actively trying to find your totem.
---
I think ruin is good enough where it is now but I would not be at all opposed to this change, it's an interesting suggestion.
---
Man I'm devotion 17 I play both sides hella. Really no bias from me
---
Rework. As in, changed not removed.
---
Fortnite
---
https://twitter.com/deadbybhvr/status/1198608800137265152?s=21
---
Seriously though nice job, this is a perfect mix of creepy and cute.
---
If I get randoms who have self care or urban I just farm their unhooks for benevolence tbh cuz I know I'm not escaping
---
Don't apologise for achieving perfection. This is GLORIOUS.
---
At the end of the day I ain’t Gona end up changing your mind so my final statement is, 
---
Their either both crutch perks, or none of them are  (my opinion is the latter)
---
I didnt find a single one in about 3 hours...
---
1. ok
---
2. sure
---
3. fine
---
4. coming next patch
---
5. if you see finding ruin as an objective, I guess you're never higher than rank 15
---
6. fine, as long as it doesn't ruin queuetimes more
---
7. yes please
---
8. yes please
---
# 9. hell the fuck no. [My usual response to any posts about quickplay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c41lmn/quick_match_mode/eruix8z?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
10. depends on what you mean. Spirit nerfs were 100% coming no matter what. They did nerf wrong things in my opinion tho. There were no massive nerfs without any reason other than the first freddy nerf
---
11. yes, please
---
How. Why. The killer should be able to kill. The survivor should be able to escape. Both are bad for points and overall game, so I would support making them rare, but they add amazing variations to gameplay...
---
I wish you could play as the unmasked versions. The models are already there, you just can’t see them.
---
Same here. South Texas. Xbox one.
---
Again, keyword is reworked. I’m not saying they should be removed.
---
I only heard good about the Max LUL
---
Likewise, I was giving benefit of the doubt because stranger things was just about to come out. Then still no reply. I also had cosmetics lie deleted from my account so I emailed and apparently they will come back in like the next patch
---
Fucking hell, Hope they fix this soon. Not being able to use something I just payed for is really sucky
---
Did you get killer blind
---
Sorry say what ...
---
What the fuck boomers have you never experienced server issues in any other games before?
---
Legion has Frank
---
Legoin has Frick
---
Legion has Julie
---
Legoin has Juile 
---
Legion has Susie
---
Legoin has Soisie
---
blocking the pallet is the only thing that doesnt apply. the 15% still works
---
Because ds, dead hard, bt and unbreakable ain't residentsleeper lol
---
Borrowed time, flip flop, decisive strike
---
It said he could destroy it but idk
---
That's awesome. Would have been funny to get a photo bomber.
---
but why does the survivors determination displease the entity? it feeds on emotions.
---
DStrike is perhaps the strongest perk at rank 1, or just below borrowed. If you get to use it, it wastes a tremendous amount of the killer's time and increases your chances of escaping. If you don't get to use it, that means you didn't get tunneled and you're almost certainly escaping.
---
It's a lot more used than old DS was.
---
Nope.
---
Yes I hate having to apologize in post game chat for tunneling when a survivor runs straight into my face while I'm trying to chase their friend so they can take a BT hit and waste my time, it feels so bad because I could've avoided it by just not tunneling them. Same thing when I've hooked someone and then I find another survivor who jumps in a locker and hits me with DS, that's really sad because I know I just proxy tunneled him by chasing and hooking another survivor first.
---
I'm sure both sides used prayer beads. And still will til they're gone.
---
damn
---
She’s also the only one in the gang who has a maniacal grin on her face. Seriously, they modeled her with a maniacal grin while the rest have poker faces. That bitch is crazy.
---
Yeah, it's a shame. It was a great horror game. It even had open world elements.
---
They should just rework all the drop locations it was strong in. But I still agree with the nerf since it is an exhaustion perk. Again haddonfield isnt the only map where it could be strong
---
lol my post about this was deleted. no fair yours stays up!
---
Thank you for crediting the person who made the meme.
---
Want to join us
---
Waifu?
---
My prefered build is, Currupt Intervention (Plague), A Nurses Calling, (Nurse), Thanataphobia (also Nurse), and Sloppy Butcher (Free).
---
Dont stalk much and just use your 0 terror radius to make them think you left after hitting them once
---
Its not your job I was just trying to understand as part of the discussion. Whatever mate, you do you. 
---
As I said, my point is mainly addressing people who want them removed but also those who want them nerfed.
---
I’m really enjoying the challenges from the archives. I’ve unlocked a majority of perks on most of my characters, so having small little goals and things to change up my day is refreshing!
---
eyeliner on the mask is the funniest thing i've ever seen
---
The guy is not entirely wrong. Even when its not as bad as today, servers are shit. 
---
I love the game but this is the most bugged game ive played in recent years. Not everyone has to endure constant bugs, dcs, endless waits, especially if they ve paid for it.. and there are people who can endure these problems, but give up later because how not new-comer friendly this game is. Not everyone is a masochist. 
---
Unfortunately, i am. So ill be around. See you in the fog.
---
Its perfect man
---
i got to play 2 games : from the tutorial ! EZ 50K BP &lt;3 (yus i'm an optimistic. how did you know ?)
---
yes it has been posted
---
Anyone else feel like the angry face under mask meme rn?
---
i duno i played till like 6 in the morning gmt+1 didnt have a problem then it just started today sunday for me
---
Ghost Face: Chewed Pen and Olsen's Adress Book
---
but at the same time, it would be the same situation. balanced landing would have become weak if they reworked the maps and kept the 75% anyway. thats the whole reason why the perk was good.
---
If you catch me on a good day then I’ll give mercy to the last person
---
Same cause exams are coming up so I woke up extra early to make sure I could have time to play for a bit then this happens lol
---
I hate it when everyone else on the team is running a bunch of rescue perks like these and Live Forever, and no one does anything all game except wait around to try to rescue other people, and the one time I do try to rescue because the survivor got hooked right by me, I turn around to see an army of survivors running from across the map desperately trying to be the one to unhook.
---
Making three gen strats literally an every game thing.
---
Ghostface caught on tape lets him reveal a survivor's in 1.5 seconds when leaning, i say thats a tie
---
Ruin is more important in the early game though, and if you haven't been to those gens it does nothing.
---
The whole point of ruin is slow down the gens passively so you don't have to be scared of going for chases. This would be a massive nerf. So I *respectfully* disagree. 
---
I think they should give it a cool down like corrupt. 5 mins of ruin. No more no less.
---
Was all I had to do, yeah. Then the items should just be in your inventory, no announcement or anything
---
This kill from the movie always bugged me! It’s an exact copy of the first kill from Terrifier
---
Borrowed is probably the best at rank 1.
---
DS is not. You use it once. You waste 5 seconds. It is situational and only good when being tunnelled. Good players have no use for it.
---
It is just a fun perk to use. And will piss of the killer.
---
This idea that ds is the best is laughable. Survivors sacrifice themselves just to get use out of it.
---
Old Ds was much better. Maybe too op, but still. That is just non debatable.
---
and its only 10am in Montreal rn. i doubt they were even awake when this shit started happening
---
After I turned off Crossplay everything is fine for me, Survival and Killer side too. EU-PC.
---
I'm gonna use nurses to see where people are leaving the most blood orbs, I'm gonna use infectious fright so when I'm in my power downing people I know where to dash if I need to and if it doesn't go off I'll just pick them up. As for the other two I was thinking nemesis and rancor
---
I wouldn’t say it is humiliating, if a 4 man tries to personally attack you just ignore them.

The thing that works with ruin is that it's a passive effect that begins straight away on all gens.
---
In high ranks survivors already know how to deal with ruin. Either they just power through with goods and greats or they could just pretty much hit greats.
---
So now not only do I have to go out of my way to kick a generator to activate the effect but it's also an effect most good survivors can deal with.
---
Whilst I'm looking for generators to kick and getting into chases this means that three survivors are free work through generators without hex ruin.
---
Ruin and corrupt intervention work because they are past the effects that you don't have to go out of your way to do. It allows you a lot more free time to set up or find and chase survivors.
---
This version does not.
---
Big Brother Ed-ward.
---
oh look its the fun police
---
&gt;you waste 5 seconds
---
Do you just stand there after you Dstriked the killer? What the fuck lol
---
They got the rights in its current state changing things they would have to go through a process again.
---
Ahh yes, BBQ and its...
---
\*checking notes\*
---
Double bloodpoints so killers can buy more moris! Truly unfair!
---
Ok become edgy and make a mask
---
Freddy with double addons for slowing people down while on dream world, ruin, tanathophobia, pop goes my brain cells and dying light makes the game literally the boriest thing I've ever seen.
---
I use it for the speed so this nerf doesn't effect me at all. You don't need it to survive. The passive was unfair more than anything I think
---
BLOODPOINT !!!!!!
---
If there's a free weekend I'd suggest trying it, or if any steam friends have it in their library see if you can't borrow it. I've only ever played the PC version but through this reddit and friends I do know that there are some differences in play style; for example, I think skill checks are easier to hit and certain killers are easier to play.
---
I'm bitching? I just said it's boring when you play against it for 5 times in a row. You're the one bitching about a subject i'm not talking about. Hurted killer feelings perhaps? Nevermind, idc tbf.
---
Damn, that is really good. Like, jezuz!
---
Haddonfield, Disturbed Ward, Ormond, Hawkins, Ironworks of Misery, The Game, Springwood, Grim Pantry, Purgation, any Coldwind with a harvester, probably more tbh. Like holy fuck are you people serious?
---
You can really tell how shit most people on this game are when so many think BL was broken on only Haddonfield.
---
Yeah? I feel like I've failed if the enemy totally escapes after a match. Maybe that's just me
---
I can’t find a game rn to save my life
---
The game is doing fine. https://steamcharts.com/app/381210
---
Besides a slight player imbalance (it seems like generally killer queues are longer in low ranks, while shorter in high, with survivors its the opposite) i guess its mainly their matchmaker thats complete garbage and the root of the issue. I mean if the imbalance was absolutely terrible, theyd adress it by now. And it evidently cant be the lack of players, the game has around 14k players at its lowest points. What else could be the issue but the matchmaker if its not lack of players or a catastrophic imbalance?
---
The frame rate is better, but besides that I wouldn't bother. I don't think it'd be worth starting all over. [unless you don't mind]
---
But if you have a group of friends on PC who play DBD then yes move to PC.
---
I once made Bill in The Sims 4. Rest In Peace, you old dream maker...
---
I can’t focus when I play against demagorgon because his vault is so cute
---
Heaven forbid you don’t get to play the game by your own made up rules 1/17 of the time.
---
Nah chief that ain’t it
---
Yeah I didn't even realise that yet but that's a good call
---
I tried the free weekend recently and got bored because I didn’t have the characters I have on PS4. But luckily I can get them cheap on CD Keys
---
That mask is really pretty
---
Love it
---
No, not every time. Sometimes it's the arm/hand or back that one's scratching instead.
---
How many games did it take?
---
Which still seems fine, doesn't it? A really good game wouldn't feel just as rewarding if there weren't any bad games beforehand. Atleast that's my take
---
It’s just getting the characters I bought on PS4. Luckily they are cheap on CD Keys though. I didn’t even pay for DBD on PS4 though, I got it with PS Plus.
---
Seeing all the charms I’d assume you work for bhvr, but those retextures are too high quality for the devs kinda work.
---
Name checks out
---
Saddest thing is that is "cannibal" mask
---
you dont even have to install it, just having it in your library is good enough! :&gt;
---
quicker trial = less time for pain and misery in the form of survivors? maybe? idk
---
I absolutely love the matchmaking today, really incredible thx
---
holy moly
---
Wish calls it a cannibal mask?
---
A neat concept from a series I very much adore.  It’s a shame however that we already have hag, demogorgon and Freddy with teleportation powers so it wouldn’t really add anything new to the game. He also doesn’t seem to have much which helps in chases other than the added lunge range. 
---
I don’t think Evil within would really fit in with this game as it’s much more gruesome and violent than what dbd is. His Mori would either be a departure from the norm and have proper gore effects or be his kill animation from the first game where he impaled your face with the pointy end of his hammer which is more in line with what we got right now.
---
Something something red mori
---
but at the same time they feel determination, hope ect. all of these are strong emotions. i dont think it even matters which emotion it is tbh.
---
Oni kind of reminds me of Shugoki.
---
I agree. This is the main reason I use NOED, but people here keep commenting "wHy tWo ExPosInG pErKs?" Like, marking takes time. Time, which in this case, I didn't have.
---
r/BadTiming
---
I have seen this shit too. Can't tell what the deal is yet
---
Ok boomer
---
If you don't mind redoing the grind then yeah go for it. :)
---
Wow thank you for the elaborate response
---
Turn off crossplay until they fix it. it works
---
I don’t know how to be more clear. I want them reworked not removed. You didn’t understand that at first so I clarified. 
---
Your point is for people who want them to be removed but I don’t want them removed, just reworked.
---
Some guy that commented here was complaining that I must suck with Ghostface because I didn't mark instead of using NOED. I explained marking took time, he called me stupid and told me to find a killer I'm good with. Then he posts this: https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadByDaylightKillers/comments/e0u0y7/why_tf_are_people_playing_michael_myers_ghostface/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Matchmaking was on point today
---
It literally gives you one chance a game to get away, which you shouldn't even need. If all you have to come back with is that then ok, great. It gives you the same amount of time as a pallet stun.
---
I've made my points and I have enough experience to know i'm right. People dislike it because it pisses off the killer. 
---
It is meta because it is fun.
---
I'm fine, with spirit and nurse getting nerfed, but to balance it out ya gotta buff the weaklings.
---
I mean yeah, I'll never deny the servers are bad. I've been opposed to dedicated servers ever since its inception.
---
I guess. I hadn't really thought about it about that way, thanks.
---
I turned off my messages a few days ago, but I kinda regret it since I wanted to see what they would've said after this.
---
Doesn’t seem like the same mask, but thank you!
---
It's only blocked for me. They could've left, they were just too far away.
---
My point is for both, and was adding to the general discussion. Nerfing is reworking. I understood clearly. They should not be touched imo.
---
Doubt it's the same player. Seems like about 20 or less survivor photos, so 20 games.
---
At best it's a compilation of many players.
---
The new DS is completely fine lmao.. either don’t tunnel or simply slug the user while doing other stuff.
---
This is very wholesome. :')
---
I wish the teammates I get paired with were as good as the ones everyone talks about
---
No, because you're being disingenuous as fuck. A good survivor will use the 5 seconds (a fuck ton of time) to get to a safe building or loop. It is going to take the killer at least 20+ seconds to catch back up to them (even if they all they do is run in a straight line) and however long after assuming they get to safety. 
---
I'm putting together that you're not a very good survivor if Dstrike isn't, at minimum, buying you 40+ seconds.
---
On xbox in USA, sat as killer for an hour, never found a lobby.
---
Nah I'm just not a trash player and I accept how easy survivor is.
---
Imaging survivors who literally run the same park set up every game complain about optimal killer setups
---
Def, with that, red ranks will get more variety
---
The fact that u can jump into a locker is stupid should turn off when u go into a locker
---
I like suggestion 2. If you are doing a gen then you don’t need DS.
---
See when I play killer I get the ones next to gens, when I play survivor the hex totem is in a different dimension and never found lol
---
if you're the last survivor and make a gesture to me that you're friendly then I'll give you the hatch. I've had way too many killers help me out when my team d/cs or fucks me over, to not do the same when I'm in a similar situation
---
Oh God! Claudette is sharing her power!
---
Just remember them and slug depend on time they unhooked
---
It's 5 secs, and a pretty good counter to the already overly used perk self care. So much time is wasted with that perk when sloppy butcher hits them.
---
You’re talking to yourself rn
---
Oh, totally agree it should have a section describing each killers power and how it works.
---
Which most red rank survivors don’t even keep in mind. 
---
If he annoyed you simply leave or wait it out. 
---
Or yknow.. don’t tunnel.
---
Keep riding that overused phrase.
---
At mid to high ranks killer lobbies up as fast as survivors
---
(Rubbing hands intensifies)
---
Get rid of timer, BUT make it so if the killer hooks someone else, and... 
---
&gt;  when you touch a generator, totem, 
---
You lose it. I think you should keep it even if you're healed though. (IMO)
---
It’s not u can use unbreakable and make the easiest perk combo in the game.
---
options. can confirm, found a lobby after 1 minute after turning off crossplay.
---
Yee,
---
Adrenaline DS Borrowed Time Dead Hard.
---
x4.
---
The main point you seem to be missing is that you only use it once and you don't even need to use it if you are a good survivor.
---
Which is 2 perk slots less which could be filled with far more annoying stuff.
---
More fun police have arrived I see...
---
This literally isn't the point lol
---
That’s 100% reasonable and pretty much the whole point of adrenaline (save for the occasional mid-chase adren proc.) however when it’s very late game, like 0-1 generators left, getting downed is usually going to mean death. Ain’t no killer leaving the hook when the gates are open.
---
Nah I like to stand at the door so the killer can get some more bp from a hit
---
This ignores the fact the survivor can jump in a locker, forcing you to grab them and get DS'd, stand and wait, wasting time, or leave, where they can jump out and carry on with the gen. It's quite frustrating.
---
It reaches a point where everyone needs the points to pip so usually a lot more care is taken.
---
“Don’t tunnel” 
---
The problem with that argument is that DS in its current state is not an anti-tunnel perk. 60 seconds is a lot of time, and there are plenty of instances where you go for the unhooker, hook them, and STILL get hit with the last guy’s DS.
---
Looking up conspiracy theories, to stay woke forever.
---
Killers really have just 2 perk slots to pick since ruin and BBQ is pretty mandatory.
---
 BBQ for points ofc. 
---
If you dont care about points you get 3 perks.
---
OK BOOMER
---
See that outfit? I have never recieved mercy from that trapper. I've even been killed last hatch slammed on my face and they message later. That was fun
---
I thought this was a skin mod for darkest dungeon. Not gonna lie. I love the style!
---
I love you c:
---
Answered this above.
---
Too bad sound is broken right now. I'd rather play other killers right now because it's so hard to hear while phasing. I wish you could turn chase music off.
---
What
---
Gamer build
---
Turn off the crossplay option.
---
Everything Killers do is toxic in the survivor world and Vice Versa.
---
The main issue is that the "meta" defines each side's  choices. 
---
With killer, about 15% of the perks they have are universally good, with another 15% only being niche or good with specific killers. 
---
Meanwhile, survivors have an ok amount of universal meta perks. Everyone knows DS, BT, DH and adrenaline. Lithe, DWM, and Q&amp;Q are also a great combo. There is 0 reason to not run an exhaustion perk. Iron will is amazing. Unbreakable is good for slugging.
---
Even the bad survivor perks can still be used against some situations. No mither is terrible against most killers, but against the Plague (and somewhat legion), it gives you buffs. Spine chill and premonition are ok with most killers, but against stealth killers and the spirit, they become amazing information perks. Bond isnt useful with a swf group, but as a solo player, it is very helpful. 
---
I mean, if it says anything, Tru3tal3nt did an attempt where he got both survivor and killer sides to rank 1 w/o perks. With the killer side, he had to do the last 3 ranks with only nurse. Meanwhile, he didn't have too much trouble as survivor. Yeah, this is an older thing and the meta has changed, but really only 1 other killer could possibly do that now (spirit) while survivor perks have gotten better.
---
I will leave off with this, yeah, killers use very similar builds. Killers wouldn't mind using other perks if there were decent enough to run. If you wanna think about this, think of the perks in the last 3 DLCs (including Oni's). The killer's perks have been, at most, ok. Some of the survivors perks are now part of the survivor meta, or at least part of a good survivor build.
---
Cross play? Dbd is cross play
---
I disagree. But whatever, I'm not going to waste any more time. I know what I know and have experienced. DS really isn't worth taking.
---
For me right now. Spine chill and iron will are a staple. Perks that give you a benefit for the whole game and will avoid you getting found on multiple occasions, as well as help you in every chase you have.
---
Then its just whatever I feel like. I tend to like fun combinations or stealth combinations as a personal thing. I use distortion to gather intel of what aura perks and add ons the killer has. This is really useful to know whether to hide in a locker at hookings or avoid healing in close proximity to the killer.
---
Then typically a sprint perk, balanced or DH. I could see the benefits of adrenaline with swf but I play more solo. Again, a perk you get use out of for the whole game not very situationally.
---
Any news on PS4 or how to turn off. Didnt even know there was cross play on platforms
---
Not on Xbox yet.
---
I like to headcannon that Susie broke the hardest after being brought to the fog. She's now a monster even Doc would be scared of.
---
Survivor cues at red ranks is super long
---
The idea of a flashlight save is to not give the killer time to dodge it. There is a very specific timing that once you have it down, you can basically hit a flashlight save every time, unless the killer is facing a wall or has lightborn. 
---
If it helps, the timing is approximately when the survivor being picked up goes across killer's shoulders. Too early and you'll get the flashlight blind before the animation finishes and not getting the save. Too late and the killer will have time to look away. But once you get it down, you hit ~95% of saves you go for, at least in my experience.
---
They nerfed the spirit rly wrong. Everyone biggest problem with her was that they didn’t know when she was using her power. So they could of just nerfed her that she makes some kind of noise when she’s using her power.
---
The way some survivors use them can be, yeah.
---
Hey! If you're looking to pass the time while waiting, "Cure for Pain- The Mark Sandman Story" is on youtube &amp; pretty good!
---
crossplay is an option??
---
&gt; Except facecamp, evidently... How do you not even understand what you're arguing?
---
k. Let just quote myself 1 last time.
---
&gt; **wanting it to be disincentivized doesn't equal me telling you how to play.**
---
We're done here. If you're not gonna listen then that's that. Have a good one. :)
---
I honestly have no clue but it's a nice dream. They dont need to be as wild and crazy like the Nurse rework and just have a series of addons affecting the chainsaw. 
---
I think aside from the chili and noise reduction addons the idea of his addons are fine. A series of chainsaw time addons would be nice cause it's insane how many times I've missed a down because the last swing just barely wasnt enough.
---
Turn off crossplay in settings, then you can play
---
Gutting that’s what I play on!
---
&gt;They should all stay in the game. I wish this community would stop bitching.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Without the 2 this game would be a lot more stale.
---
This shows you didn't understand what I was saying. No, nerfing is nerfing. The Nurse, Legion, BL weren't reworks but just nerfs to them.
---
Mori and keys are unbalanced. Killers tunnel once and that survivor is dead. Keys instantly opens hatch even if no generators are done and the killer closes the hatch. They also can be found during the match which is quite easy with perk set ups.  Mori's hurt killers more than it helps. Now they're pretty much only used to piss off streamers, ttvs, youtubers, and to just be a dick at this point.  I disagree, they are too strong right now and need reworks done to them.
---
I think clown is very underrated, he is pretty decent ngl. And i hate going vs him
---
crossplay is an option?? oh wrong topic
---
Getting hotter, Don’t forget me, I see you on my ruin, and 99% the door idiot.
---
And sometimes there's not a even a scratch, you just wanna take a swig of that epic gamer liquid.
---
this is a temporary thing dude chill out
---
Yeah. And it’s kinda sad that behavior listens to them. Probably cuz they would loose a lot of players cuz there’s so many baby’s playing the game.
---
In all seriousness, I don't see any issues with Kenneth (Clown). I only ever witnessed animation or visual bugs with him. Specifically holding and throwing animations are out of sync. He's really strong with add-ons and even worse if the Killer knows how to stop choke points with him. It's even scarier to go against a Clown who's good with no add-ons.
---
Oh and add-on that gives you exposed status effect is absurdly stupid... and boring. Soz, didn't find it anything interesting in particular.
---
Susie's perfect though.
---
If they use a build around DS &amp; Unbreakable without taking anything that’s more useful and especially less situational they’ll simply miss other perks that could help them far more often. 
---
Oh and sometimes you just have to eat the DS or the unbreakable. Even then you can choose in what situation it would be best for them to just throw it away. 
---
A corner without pallets and unsafe windows? Lemme eat that spicy DS.
---
Ok. Will do. Thanks!
---
Bare chest realness.
---
AFAIK they try to match you with 'local' enemies, aka people in range of a server. At least thats what I imagine because the queues are much worse if you play at late night
---
Your right honestly I can tell your passionate about the game
---
Compared to the beginning DbD went a great way of balancing so far. 
---
I still remember the old shack and stuff like that..
---
Ghostface mains rise up!
---
There’s only crossplay on pc, not consoles.
---
There isnt crossplay on ps4
---
Seems like a fairly obvious choice to me.
---
He can be frustrating I've found with all my killers and survivors going perkless allows you to be a bit more immersed and be less distracted by notifications
---
Uh oh, someone's in trouble! 🤭
---
Posting this when the servers are down - 2000 IQ play
---
You shouldn’t have to slug somebody if you didn’t tunnel them. And if they jump into a locker all counterplay is gone.
---
Yeah. This gives you a reason to start phasing at the start of the game.
---
Yeah I guess that's the difference, I'm not trying to avoid being found. I'll run iron will because it helps in chase but spine chill? I'm trying to run the killer and waste his time, not have him leave and find a less capable player.
---
Right? I get if its IMPLEMENTATION is a bug, and therefore causes some instability, but keeping mistakes people like just shows you're doing your most basic level of consideration and actually reading feedback.
---
Why play a game that just makes arbitrary changes in a vacuum, wholly convinced that only their way is right, especially when they don't actually play?
---
Then they jump in a locker, and they have invulnerbility, jumping kn a locker with ds should turn it off its a simple change
---
I'd say their system is working exactly as intended, but it's a terrible intention.
---
Now if only Bamboozle actually worked like it's supposed to.
---
I quit using the perk (and with it pretty much Legion as well) after people kept constantly jumping through the Entity blocker that the perk pretends to create.
---
Top quality portrayal of best Legion.
---
If they do it at the beginning of the timer yeah well that kinda sucks. 
---
If they do it when there’s like 15 secs left you still save time and it’s worth just waiting.
---
Cross play?
---
This post alone proves why DBD is in such a bad state and also why it is so fucking boring to play. 
---
Games design is so flawed right now. Instead of fixing the game they add perks to counter other perks and certain gameplay elements which only build onto the issues existing. Never ending loop of creating perks to kill other perks.
---
They need someone with fresh ideas to enter their team. This Oni release proves they are running out of ideas considering they are replicating already existing killers rather than make completely new abilities.
---
Okay legion
---
Bruh there is nothing more annoying than a toxic survivor with ds and unbreakable. This makes the killers use enduring. AnD tHaT iS a SlOt WhErE u CoUlD uSe A bEtTeR pErK.
---
Edit: What if u run up to the same survivor who u just hooked but u can’t pic him up cuz he still has like 30 sec of the ds. Why is it such a disgusting huge nerf what will kill ds if behavior would just degrease the time to like 20-30 sec.
---
Wish it was on android
---
* Sad gamer noises *
---
Iirc they changed enduring to no longer affect DS. 
---
Might be wrong tho.
---
Do you want to join us
---
There is now cross play with the Windows Store version
---
1. It only activates if killer is within 25m of hook rescue. Ds will light up on your hud, indicating the killer is 25m away. (That way Insidious or other tr perks won't matter and you don't need any guesswork for 25m)
---
2. The rescuer gives the hooked ds, similar to bt. Makes more sense because it's like they give you a sharp item.
---
3. If the killer is further than 25m, you heal only the unhooked player 100% faster. (Does not stack with other healing properties, only works once per survivor. Gives the perk purpose if killer is far away)
---
4. If the survivor hits the ds skillcheck, they become exhausted for 30's. Ds then becomes useless for the person who granted it, for the rest of the trial.
---
If they could somehow pack this wall of text into a perk, it would add utility to certain builds while keeping it fair and useful. 
---
Also, this is my opinion for balancing the perk. I understand that reworking a survivor perk usually brings out the worst in the community. Keep it civil yeah?
---
Either wait out the timer if it’s not too much left or just eat the DS for once.
---
I'll admit it's strong on hawkins, haddon, father campbell's, and grim pantry, but it's okay at best on the others. Plus for every good map with BL there's a dog shit map for it.
---
Didn't you know that if you even look at a survivor that you've already hooked you're a tunneling POS?  
---
/s
---
So is this what it sounds like when the entity takes people?
---
Ugh wow.
---
That is my opinion addressed to you *and* anyone who thinks they should be removed. As you are all on the same side of the fence here.
---
They should all stay in the game in their current state. Without the two 'in their current state' the game would be more stale.
---
That easier for you to understand?
---
You know exactly what point im making and I have no idea what you are trying to do here...
---
In terms of items and offerings, nerfing is reworking. Stop trying to be pedantic.
---
They are rare, fun and discouraged anyway because it doesnt get you good points.
---
Not a satisfying response.. it gives them 60 sec immunity where they can fuck around bodyblock do gens right next to u without punishment
---
Oh, gotcha.
---
I play a bunch depends on what I'm feeling or if I'm doing dailys, but my fave is probably billy.
---
Oh, right, I forgot the game was explicitly designed to be a radioactive grind-hole. Mb
---
If they're very good at running me around I'll generally leave them be and give hatch if I come across it first. If I catch them at the gates though then hopefully they pop it open before I get to them. I don't really care if there are DC's as we're all equally robbed off points .
---
It's done on amazon all the time
---
Gotta stay hydrated!
---
it sounds like that she is on roller skates
---
That's how it is huh.
---
How did you get them on switch?
---
What made me smile was turning off crossplay under settings and then being able to play
---
Also, I vaulted a window and stepped on a trap. Trapper went to me, I freed myself the second he was gonna pick me  up and he picked up the trap instead. I vaulted the window and escaped. Later he downed me, picked me up and went to a hook. On the way there he stepped on his own trap. I survived yet again lol
---
Same here.
---
It seems he thinks that I’d prefer them not in the game, which I told him no, I agree they should stay, but be changed. He is stating his point is for “me and people who want them removed” which is not what I want so I don’t see why you’re lumping me in with them because I disagree with those people. 
---
All good
---
Wholesome.
---
Ohh mannn, I was curious what doc do.
---
Spirit needed the nerf, to be honest. I know I'm biased, since I'm a survivor main, but she's not challenging and fun to go against, like the Nurse. She's unfun and boring to go against.
---
I see you’re just going to demean me now. Have a good day.
---
This is all get trying to play Survivor on PS4. It searches for 5+ minutes than 3 to 4 pop ups.
---
"Error"
---
"Disconnected from host"
---
"Failed to create party".
---
Killer almost never has this problem for me but I stay around purple ranks for both sides.
---
Edit: I made this comment before hearing about the servers being down. This is my experience almost everyday.
---
I actually love the idea of a female Myers.
---
Michelle Myers maybe?
---
They remind me of Terraria enemies
---
Good shit for punishing these cocky mother fuckers. If they'd been standing any further forward they'd have gotten away good job man
---
Thank you for sharing this info.
---
Yeah self care is whack and I don't get why it's used by so manu lol. Like, bring a health kit if healing yourself is so damn important and don't waste the perk slot lol. You're way better off with an exhaustion perk or whatever the Tapp perk is that shows all the auras once a gen's done
---
I thought the same, now I want a DbD mod for Darkest Dungeon, the Doctor would fit perfectly.
---
Dude... just read your replies
---
Ghost face stabs a cashier named bob for the 40th time this week
---
This has already been posted
---
I'm gonna make a post now just for badness
---
Oof, alright imma delete it then
---
Ahh that explains a lot. Thank you for this!
---
works like a charm, thank you so much!
---
It shouldn't, no idea.
---
On PS4 you can remap the button to x, so that your right hand can handle both r1 and skill checks, leaving your left hand free for ... whatever.
---
Depends on what you mean. The base game is on PC so I thonk that'll be fine. But the PS5/etc? Probably, but not definitely.
---
I understand what I'm saying very well, you just can't articulate it but that's not my problem. -_-
---
Making a play style harder to do (I rather you didn't do that, but you can) is the same as banning it? (You're not allowed to do it period point blank) False equivalency much?
---
You're sitting there insulting me over disagreement about a game like a child, so yeah I stopped taking you seriously a while ago. But feel free to keep going though. I'd rather not since it's bearing zero fruit. :)
---
Ive been trying this exact build with plagg at R1 recently and she still gets decimated
---
I've memorized that link and I'm not falling for your tricks
---
Happy birthday!
---
weird fix but ok
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
We can give players thumbs up, though, and that totally does *something* , right?
---
If you are still struggling. You are saying they are an issue, I am saying they are not. That is why you are on the same side as people who want them removed.
---
I tend to take this approach as well. It's kind of sad when they don't catch on
---
been sat here for about 45 mins trying to get a killer game on ps4 lol
---
 I can say without fail I use more varied perk builds at rank 1 solo as a survivor and still get at least a pip. 
---
Just because you dont want to branch out with more unique builds doesnt mean they arent viable
---
With killer at rank 1 I need pop and ruin or i stand no chance without spirit or billy
---
TIL  dead by daylight got cross play on pc.
---
Does this mean that I could have played with some non ps4 user...?
---
on my ps4???
---
Nice.
---
I play on both. People on PC are more toxic, whereas people on console aren't as good. It's a price but one I'm willing to pay. I got told I deserved to be raped when I 4k'd as Trapper, so that's my PC experience in a nutshell.
---
People who use self care take annoyingly long to heal. I've had some people even refuse to be healed by me because they are self caring themselves. As a killer, i don't mind people using self care, it wastes their time.
---
What are you saying? Spirit is the exact same except now prayer beads isn’t the same and she has a window vaulting animation.
---
Keep riding that overused phrase
---
i'm a survivor main as well, but i play clown once every 10 matches. the reason low tier killers should get a buff is because the higher your surv rank is the less variety you'll get. i agree, spirit deserved the prayer beads nerf and the collision removal. but i think they should focus on weak killers now.
---
The devs are rly survivor sided rn. That’s probably why it’s so hard to balance the game when they don’t even seem to try.
---
I love how much Marge loves Homer.
---
I love the kit sounds fun.
---
Same thing here. Thought it was my internet at first. Sat for 30 mins as killer thinking nobody was playing till I tried survivor a few times.
---
New Perk: **Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru**  
---
Press Active Ability to use this perk. When the killer is within 8 meters, instantly reappears behind the killer. Causes the exhausted status for 60/50/40 seconds.  
---
*"Nani?!?!?!?!"*
---
Every time I sip water
---
Found the killer main
---
Yeah probably not but you still have 40 days left
---
Have you seen that one insane spot in Crotus? Took me a minute to find it and I was killer. It's tucked behind debris in a jungle gym
---
But the pass is insanely slow to level so I don't even know if I'll have it done in time lmao. I guess that's my fault though.
---
He goes thought survivors and thats alr quite huge but I understand ur argument.
---
every killer with exposed add ons is boring though no? clown def lacks map pressure.
---
Reporting same issue on PC at LAS
---
impossible to get a match as killer or survivor
---
Yeah I was on PS4 before I switched to PC. My irritation with the matchmaking was what forced me and my friends to change to PC. The best decision I ever made... matches in half a minute with zero connection issues.
---
Slugging isn’t this super difficult strategy. They’re not invulnerable. You can down then wait out the timer while chasing others. Slowing the game while making a quarter of the survivors kit useless.
---
What tier are you on?
---
It is weak on shelter woods only 1 place to use it
---
I main Michael, and I can tell ya, I have no clue why they're doing what they do, and I'm not gonna lie, I've even played scummy for a couple days, one of the things I did was bring a cypress mori, picked up last person bring them near hatch, closed it and mori'd them.
---
Why I did it? I have no clue, I just genuinely felt like being a dick, no reason whatsoever
---
Its only between Steam and Window's Store users at the moment
---
Hm. My better judgment is questioning your methods...but your flair makes me want to trust you so yeah what the heck go ahead
---
Literally the same thing I did man. Glad to see they're working on it tho as I really wanna get on with my tome challenges
---
You're trying to disincentivize a strategy by making it not worthwhile **for the ultimate goal that people don't do it**.
---
Unless your ultimate goal is something different? No? You do know what the ultimate goal of making the strategy harder is, yes?
---
And since you're trying to make people not do it, you're trying to dictate how people play.
---
You're such a fucking idiot that you don't even understand what you're arguing for. Stop trying to dictate how another person plays the game. Your opponent is not responsible for your fun.
---
Edit: Let me put it a different way, since you're obviously so dense as to not understand things. Coming on here and trying to disincentivize a certain strategy is equal to trying to dictate how people play. You are saying "I don't think they should play this way, so I want them punished if they do."
---
That's like a Killer main saying "Looping is too easy. Running should build an TIRED meter where the survivor gets slower and slower to disincentive looping. I'm not saying they can't loop, but they should be penalized for doing it" or "Hiding is too easy. The Birds notification should start in half the time. The devs already disincentivize hiding, they should just move the line."
---
&gt;level 1
---
Someone give this man a cookie.
---
18
---
I think the spirit should give the survivors more cue as to when she's using her power, like the Nurse. That way she has more counter play and I'd have some fun going against her that way.
---
Yes! That one is awesome for ruin, not so much for survivors but for killer its great

I mean the meta build is dead hard, adrenaline, ds, bt. Its probably the most used survivor perk in reds right now and probably the strongest. Do you actually think its a bad perk?
---
What platform are you on? I usually find games in less than a minute.
---
It’s a joke. Just fake names. Like off brand copies of the original.
---
Its literally one day. You just need to play 2 extra games for 8 of the days and you make up for it, or 16 days. 40 days left.
---
I thought this was a painting initially because of the sheets
---
This was a combination of relief, and just utter satisfaction. The hatch being right in front of him? Priceless.
---
Hillbilly can rev his saw across the map, but Myers will somehow already be there
---
Servers down for Xbox too?
---
Isn't it already confirmed that PS5 will be able to play PS4 games?
---
PC
---
May I make a suggestion?  
---
Have Trapper face us for a hug
---
That only works on PC
---
yeah probably, i'm glad they reduced the phase out speed, that shit was crazy.
---
The queues for me have been like 5-10 minutes for the past week or two but it's just ridiculous today.
---
mori me
---
lmao you were never gonna finish the pass if your level 18, queues today or not. You needed to be at least around 30 by now, at your pace  your behind at least 200 games of experience
---
Servers are down.
---
Nothing better than a last minute 3 man game. I was playing nurse the other day and didn't down anyone until they had the 1 gen left....I wiped the floor with all of them and got a 4k
---
Was the pig masks a part of saw? I thought it was something only for dbd
---
It is meta but not as good as many other perks. Defo not the strongest. Good survivors won't have an opportunity to use it.
---
Heck yeah feng ganggg
---
Thanks ^^
---
servers broke today, will probably be fixed by tomorrow. At your pace you weren't gonna finish the pass anyway.
---
I feel the same. All exhaustion perks are viable, and even as a basis of the build can offer viable additions to them. Lithe with scratch mark changes, Dead hard with survival perks, sprintburst has an entire army of perks to compliment it. 
---
People just run DS/Adrenaline because they're no brain require get out of jail free cards.
---
Thanks :)

Dang do we know when they’ll be back up?

that was false info actually

Yeah  make sure to put "OP" in the thumb nail so that we can get another killer nerfed :/

True and also true.

But besides map pressure Clown is ONLY good at giving pressure on close quarters. Otherwise trying to cut chases making them shorter.
---
He is also having that small gig from Plague where you can throw bottles with a choice of velocity throws to expand the gas clouds around the environment or generators. Sometimes way too effective with the makeup add-on being used on the dead cow tree.
---
Besides the fact his bottles shared the same viability with (old) Freddy. Where in the dream world your actions were slow like repairing, vaulting, healing and etc. And basically it's still a thing where Kenneth is the (old) Freddy Krueger.
---
I just got a notification saying its been posted. You can find it on this sub somewhere
---
Just because he hates dcs doesn’t say anything about him other than he plays the game.
---
I forgot ruined got cleansed and I started gen tapping a 90% gen and my teammate copied me lol
---
OH OHH. Those are great then lol
---
Turning off crossplay on PC worked for me! Change crossplay to "disabled" in Options, as other Redditors already mentioned.
---
Yikes. I'm not getting the next pass then. Not everyone can play for 12 hours a day and the devs should realise that.
---
Nope. They're working on it, but no ETA.
---
I would expect PC to have the fastest ques, but I guess location and rank are factors too.
---
That triple kill at the end was mental
---
Drop the pallet early and gg
---
Big oof how long has it been going on for?
---
They better refund the money. I bought the game plus the 20€ DLC. Im gonna be so mad if i don't get my money back.
---
Since I've been focusing on survivor mostly, my killer rank is about 18. I decided to give it a shot. I did fairly well but began noticing people were failing skill checks on gens with no ruin. A few survivors would literally stand right in front of me while healing, and some other Dwight was in a locker. 
---
As I see all of this unfold I just stand there and the Claudette that was healing pointed to me then I smacked the gen, and she crouched as if asking "is it ok?..." to which I nodded furiously up and down. Once the last gen was done, I simply opened the gate. One last final goodbye from their team and hearts in the chat afterwards. It was oddly satisfying.
---
To anyone wandering, the Dwight was so stubborn that I had to pick him out of the locker and lay him down by the exit.
---
My god it was a trip. I memed around with pig that game and ever since, every once in awhile I'll get a snoot boop.
---
Edit: Grammar

---
Good thing I'm a Trapper main and always carry a trap. If I see this, I trap the locker and they're screwed.
---
About three hours. Servers are down apparently.
---
I doubt it, he seems well balanced overall just high skill sealing. The kills at the beginning were a fluke I doubt they cared that much about the game because it was PTB
---
Bingo
---
Yeah I know there's a vacuum and they get highlighted through walls, but potentially having trouble using them as a tracking ability (I already can't see blood at all) on maps with tall grass/corn is annoying.
---
Well shit, bad enough to be missing out on frames, now I know I got the short end on queue times as well.
---
Jeez
---
Wish I could do this on ps4 lol.
---
Honestly. I was going against a Doctor the other day, theres only me and one other guy left, I loop the doctor for 4 minutes straight, it was the longest I had ever kept a killer busy, and finally I go down and hooked. My teammate? Nothing, the last gen that he could've worked in that whole 4 minutes was at 0%, because he wanted hatch
---
Interesting build indeed ! I’d be happy to see a video of you playing ghost face with it :). 
---
Devour Hope could go along the « hook and run » style of play !
---
Time to practice my moonwalk then
---
Does it actually? :v
---
Poor nurse has been nerfed into the ground
---
Well I got into a match rn on pc so I guess they are up again?
---
You forgot unbreakable.
---
Should've mentioned pc only. Sorry my bad.
---
alrighty!
---
You didn't need 12 hours a day, i did the math a month ago and assuming you started on release and played every day 15 minutes per game, you needed 4~ hours of gameplay a day to complete the pass. Gets taken down to 2~ hours a day of gameplay if you complete every archive. I didn't even take in the FGOTD experience when playing so it was likely 1 1/2 hour a day.
---
She has but her add ons are strong as fuck now if you use them right. Still a shame she got nerfed so hard
---
Am I the only one likes getting jump scared by gen grabs?
---
This is JoJo's writing quality that people fawn about??
---
The instadown bottles are overrated. They’re hard to hit and dont last for long, you’re going to need to be close.
---
Meanwhile Hillbilly can have unlimited instadowns when close, is easier to hit with, doesnt need to reload, and on top of that he can cross the map in seconds
---
&gt;  it's so hard to hear while phasing
---
that's the only time you will play her as she should : with real mindgames.
---
I’m getting ERROR Connection with the host could not be established. Please try again. This was 4 hours ago and just now when I tried again. In UK
---
Also my fan on my PS4 seems strained the last few times on the game, and when it first loads it goes crazy, really loud.  (about the last 5 times I have turned on the game) why would this be happening? This doesn’t happen on any other game.
---
One map with only two spots (basement and the tree) doesn't cancel out how many maps it's OP on.
---
Playing with my bf and a couple other rando survivors and the killer got three of us, but my bf was left limping around trying to find the hatch. She found him first and picked him up and he started wiggling. 
---
I crossed my fingers, threw up a wish to the heavens that she was merciful and said "stop wiggling, maybe she'll help you find the hatch". He didn't want to, but he figured she'd find a hook before he wiggled free anyway so he just sat his controller down and waited for the end. 
---
She walked him around for awhile, found the hatch and let him go and he was blown away, he had never had that happen and was so grateful he didn't lose his toolbox. 
---
If it hadn't been for this sub I wouldn't have even realized some killers do that kind of thing! It's made for some rare but cool little moments of comaradarie for me!
---
No...no he can't. Only the most noob of players will he be effective against
---
I’d play with them. There cool.
---
Still dead for me on ps4 :(.
---
"Stewart!?!"
---
"Roald..."
---
That's still a lot for plenty of people
---
Lets play run fast with knife!
---
Yikes.. compare this game to its first release and repeat that.
---
Beat me to it
---
And how you would exactly buff the weak killers?
---
Don’t worry you aren’t suffering alone.
---
There is no way to have a killer balanced at all levels of play.
---
Days of the Dead?
---
Clowns just a big ol chasey boi and I love him for it. Makes you reliant on altruism plays and close proximity gens. You're absolutely right though, he doesn't hold a candle to the other bois
---
He was playing doctor and didn’t have anything to slow the game down on a map that’s heavily survivor sided especially with the bus window open. He did the best he could
---
Bhvr issued a statement on twitter. All servers on all platforms are down.
---
So wait. You’re in on PC?
---
Lmao what a daft reason to quit, doubly so since your still here
---
Yup. Look at dbd twitter. It’s being fixed.
---
Ur right. But after they fixed the killers they have slowly started to evolve backwards.
---
Unable to connect to host. Xbox, Germany.
---
Same man, I think has gone bonk on the servers. I just wanna play Cowboy Jake :c
---
I have legit been searching for a killer match for over an hour, is something wrong with my thing or is it actually like this?
---
Two things, spirit is a she. So are you sure you’re talking about spirit. Secondly she doesn’t go through survivors. Survivors are still physically present while you’re facing and can bump into you. Also I’m not arguing, I’m just not sure you even know how the killer works.
---
Useless posting this here because 99% of the subreddit is casuals who don't even get to r1 as survivor let alone killer. R1 killers know how common this shit is.
---
Guess the issue is resolved or doesn't effect switch version.
---
Found a match in 30 seconds.
---
disable crossplay in the options. It will find you a game
---
What do those acronims mean?
---
Cheers guys, didn't realise
---
Yeah! I was her last night!
---
On pc you can solving it by disabling the crossplay option.
---
Next i kill you insanty 😏😏
---
Anyone remember those awesome 3 o'clock skill checks? Yeah those were fun!
---
Named my account "searching for match" when i stated to main killer and it still feels appropriate every time i play
---
People don’t take the game seriously, but they do want to have fun while playing it. The problem is that they aren’t fun to play against. It can’t creat a fun situation when all three survivors suddenly escape while you are patrolling gens. Nothing is fun about getting tunneled off of a hook and instantly loosing. (I do advocate the mori’ing of people who have twitch.tv in there name tho)
---
I wasn't there this year but great job on the costume! And the Cop O Lantern was a great touch.
---
Looks like a twitch emote
---
No doubt DS needs a rework. Survivors should be scared of the killer after they get off the hook but they will literally just sit on a gen in front of the killer waiting to get grabbed because they know they have an easy escape. DS should be canceled after a gen or totem is touched imo.  and the timer is paused whenever you are in a chase.
---
Partial backwards compatibility, probably up to individual developers. Xbox has confirmed full backwards compatibility.
---
I'm a survivor main and I don't ever expect the killer to let anyone go, it's really nice when they do but they've got a game to play too, I understand that. BUT oh man, some people seem to want to suck the fun out of it!
---
Last survivor, Hillbilly picked me up, and started walking past hooks so I got my hopes up, he walked me to the hatch, dropped me beside it then slammed it shut in my face and watched me bleed out. No nasty dms from me bc that's a bitch move, but never before have I let a stream of expletives leave my mouth quicker.
---
Thank you! it was a stroke of luck that I saw him on the table and was able to buy him!
---
They have some skilled programmers to write that chin catch detection code without the use of the user's web cams. Perhaps it detects a sudden halt of slight mouse inputs?
---
Yea this is a problem too. People just waiting for the other person to die when they could be doing something useful.
---
and dead hard
---
Id prefer it be for a certain amount of time default.
---
Huntress and Clown both share projectile gimmick, while nobody likes games not being enticing with instant or exposed status effect ending a chase faster. Not to mention some people are obsessed with these add-ons and become cocky... they're just not fun.
---
And of course Hillbilly has a chainsaw and a weapon like chainsaw would obviously be lethal. Except I heard a lot of complaints where his weapon should behave weak since it's more rusted than Bubba's. Also biggest minus for Hillbilly I got is registering chainsaw attacks: where you do animation as you sawed someone but it still misses a whole gap in front of you like it was nothing.

Ghostface didn't come with a survivor though and all of Steve's are useless in their current state. And Yuri has 2/3 ok perks, but they seems very fun.
---
But I agree killer perks have been very lackluster lately.
---
Dont do this. Dont make me miss Gravity Falls again
---
Umm... It read on the patch notes that he will go trough survivors so I dunno where u find ur info.
---
Accurate.
---
There are a ton of great survivor perks out there. It just scares me how many purple and red ranks are running that shit though lol.

Once again are you sure you’re talking about Spirit, because Spirit is a she.  And that’s the new spirit. Not the current spirit. Which you were talking about going back to old spirit. Once again not sure you even own the DLC Spirit is in or have ever even played a single match against this killer.
---
Imagine being the guy who has nothing better to do then to correct other peoples grammatical errors:/
---
Did this and it works great
---
IMO decisive is fine as is. It's strong, yes, but I don't think it's broken like it was before. I think another attempt to nerf it would just result in it ending up like MoM.
---
iM hAvInG wItHdRaWaL sYmPtOmS
---
Oh damn :(
---
So you're supposed to be deaf while phasing? I have good headphones, and literally can't hear survivors more than 5m away from me. On any killer.
---
That’s not what that means
---
I feel like on a down it more directly matches the strength of the killer.
---
1 or 2 minutes of free ruin on Billy? The match can be over before the effect fades. 1 minute for Trapper? Hardly enough. 1 minute for Wraith? Really meh.
---
But if you're unlucky and have the first survivor run you through the map, mindlessly dropping pallets and extending it to a safe chase that lasts 2+ minutes? With everyone else pre-running from gens so you can't just shift pressure? Well until you get that first down you have a little bit of mercy.
---
Yeah, I'm on pc and I disabled cross-play and it got better
---
I guess I have never paid attention to any of their feet
---
With the amount of people calling for something about Deathgarden in DBD, the devs can't ignore it
---
I'm a Spirit main myself but I don't use prayer beads that often
---
Michelle is serving
---
Thank you my friend!
---
Seems to be solved.
---
Servers are down. They posted on Twitter.
---
I always help the survivor out if they do this. Hell if they do this at the beginning of the game I’ll ignore them.
---
But, if a killer is playing, so are 4 survivors.
---
Its such a huge momentum swing when it procs that its worth the perk slot. Thats like saying NOED isnt a strong perk because a “good” killer wont have an opportunity to use it.
---
Fine... Take my 👍
---
I was just trying to think of something to turn into a meme bc I had to say something about his tiny feet
---
He's a cutie but the noises scare the shit out of me
---
With a second killer being added to it, “Billy but worse” qualifies as its own category now.
---
Again, real nurse mains dont give a shit about the nerf. Theyve been destroying without addons, you know get 4kd at 3-4 gens instead of 5. OP here, once he learns the ropes will demolish people all the same. Peeposheeps that relied on omegablink were the ones that got nerfed
---
I don't mean every spirit main.  It's usually pretty easy to tell based on how sweaty they play
---
Normally I check my  phone when on a  gen, as soon as I get a skill check I forget I am holding my phone and throw it across the room trying to hit lb on my controller
---
Doesn’t matter. The rate at which the gens got popped were disgusting, doesn’t matter the map or killer. Gens should not be popping that fast
---
I think that's just the console, my ps4 is crazy loud sometimes too
---
You do look easy to run around
---
Scrap shirtless Myers, I have a better idea!
---
I loathe DS/Adrenaline simple because of how situational they are: DS requires the killer to tunnel, and if you’re the obsession, they’ll probably just slug you (rendering it completely useless); Adrenaline makes for clutch plays, sure, but it gets **5 SECONDS** of use plus one health state at the endgame. That’s it. Like... there’s soooo many perks that are far better and have much greater utility/longevity.
---
maybe its not selling to well at switch? thats why its 50% off?
---
Gotchu
---
Sounds dumb.
---
Not for me on ps4 :(.
---
cant find match LAS
---
Yes because the other three survivors aren’t adversely affected at all by a baby rage quitter.
---
they both are too good and im a rank 1 spirit player, the issue is that Prayer beads can be paired with a gen grabber build and its way too nasty there's no counterplay  unless you only work when she is hooking your teammates
---
Bruh, you do not need to be r1 in either role to know this is how it is in a frustrating number of matches.
---
I see for u its a hard concept to grasp that they can RUN INTO A LOCKER which is my whole argument u cant slug them cuz they go into invulnerble locker and its stupid
---
Mamacita!
---
Awesome stuff, the concept and execution really add up to something special. Now I want to see you team up with Mikeyboi in a fan flick.
---
Nice!! I love seeing art that's heavily stylized, looks very cool. Suits his aesthetic too
---
I actually like it
---
don't forget on the main screen if he pops up there at the bonfire
---
thank you !!!!! =)
---
First of english is not my main language so I every now and then forget to say she or he. Secondly I have played against spirits and it’s not that hard after u know how to counter her. They only needed nerf was to know when the spirit was using her power.
---
Edit: And yes I have the dlc.
---
Just let him have this one lol
---
These models better get ripped
---
I would absolutely love to play my girl Michelle in a fan film, granted I would have to make her mask neater and less fragile first but it would be so fun! I love the concept of a Michelle Myers hunting Laurence Strode in some alternate universe!
---
We literally already had that. The only thing that took it away was a perk.
---
If you can't spend 3 hours a day, then you should not of bought the pass, did you really think they were going to give out a free recyclable 1000 cells to people that casually play the game? lmao your high as fuck.
---
According to my math, thats only  60~ hours doing no challenges or FGOTD bonus over 30 days. Assuming hes done at least one of the archive challenges completely done thats 40~ hours over 31 days. Even less if he has progress on tome 2.
---
A little over an hour each day, if he knew he had that type of time he should of known, bhvr thanks him for the 10$
---
I probably will change to PC when the nightmare edition releases.
---
You’re gonna teach the bt user a lesson by activating the perk they brought into the challenge specifically for that reason?
---
Funniest part is the nerfs probably won’t change much, good players are still gonna be terrifying
---
There's plenty of people who max out at r10 killer who will try and dispute how this is
---
Me crouching in front of a killer realizing I can’t win the chase and hope they take pity on me
---
People need to start running Surveillance more. Such an amazing late game perk that I rarely see people using.
---
Had been in queue for 5 minutes. Hopped on reddit to pass the time and ironically found this post. Saw your comment and got out of queue to turn off crossplay. Got back in queue and immediately found a match. Thank you!
---
I do not know who I am, or why I am here, all I know is that I must *spin*
---
Had what?
---
The queues have been so awful on both sides that most just assume you'll be waiting around 10+ mins for a game now. Personally after waiting about 5 mins I checked survivor and got the couldn't reach host message. Knew something was up then.
---
It's possible to bot have a harvester or a hill on rancid abattoir too.
---
The sound notification that she’s using her power.
---
Don't get me wrong I know I've still got a ways to go before I'm gonna be even half as good as I wanna be. The omegablink was useful but I agree it should've been nerfed a while ago that said I never used nurse before the nerf because I knew the nerf was coming. I just gotta figure out how to blink right and I'm laughing really.
---
What do Quentin’s perks look like? I’d imagine Wake Up and Pharamacy look the same (as there’s not much that outright says *Quentin Smith* with those icons), but Vigil will look different, right?
---
I mean I've already gotten my tier 70 without buying shit but I feel bad for people who enjoy the game but can't play two or more hours a day
---
One screenshot of a dumb line shouldn’t be indicative of the writing of an entire series’, but yes, JoJo is full of goofy bullshit and people like it. There is also some quality storytelling in the series. Just let people like things.
---
Well than. The nerf was almost completely useless. Good job behavior.
---
Problem is even if you win the mind game you still lose when she still just catches up to you.
---
Or that's the time my cat decides to jump in my lap
---
Tapping repair button (LMB PC)for short amounts of time repeatadely to avoid skill checks
---
It's just matchmaking is down.. it'll be back soon.
---
Ah, I see you're a man of literature as well.
---
True, Plag can hit some trick shots over the walls but that's not the point of "go chill in a jungle gym". The point is you're going to your safest place away from the gens to camp it out. Maybe it's a jungle gym, maybe it's a god window loop, maybe it's just crouching in the corner of the map he's unlikely to check. The power has a finite duration and survivors can decide how much they want to risk getting caught out by it vs just playing it slow for the rest of the duration... just like Corrupt Purge.
---
And oh excuse me, I forgot the only good killers out there are the ones that make videos. Guess I'll just forget everything I've learned and tested about this killer and wait for the Youtube Gods to tell me how I'm supposed to play.
---
Are the servers still down?
---
raise the skill ceiling. add an additional level of complexity to the killer's ability, that opens up viability in more scenarios. something like carefully timing wraith's decloak to get a very short-range blink, to beat out pallets.
---
Just watch this vid and see if it changes ur opinion on things. If it doesn’t I do not rly care. If it does I don’t rly care. https://youtu.be/-dDDwRdJ-1M
---
Builds can't be toxic. Personalities and demeanor can be toxic.
---
Hiding in plain sight eh BHVR?
---
Didn’t know doing gens in a locker is a new feature. 
---
Ignore them or just eat that DS. Or quit the game and do everyone a favor instead of crying.
---
Yes it is. It's from a T-shirt company.
---
And I don't even know if they own the original design.
---
turn off crossplay if you're on pc

wdym man I'd love to be part of the "my panic at the  green chemical park" gang (fuck that hurt to type)
---
Oh Okie lol
---
Today, while waiting, I watched a whole episode of Rick and Morty... Than I decided to turn DBD down and started playing Disco Elysium. Jesus Christ, today I can't play DBD at all.
---
Not in solo queues as a lot of players play like a potato. I play the game too, thank you.
---
That's the real reason I cleanse totems. No skill checks and I can take a swig.
---
I wish a Dev would have the balls to actually say something publicly to you. This is a serious issue. Imagine all the colorblind people who tried the game for 2 hours or less because they simply couldn't see.
---
Unable to connect to host, Germany PS4 &amp; Xbox One
---
Ps4 CAN still can’t connect to host
---
I do not have a rly good argument anymore and only thing what I can rly say anymore is that watch this vid https://youtu.be/-dDDwRdJ-1M
---
I'm on ps4 and cannot connect
---
Hmmmmmmmmm, Trying not to impulse buy. I’ve been thinking I’d go ps4version instead, if I picked up a console copy. Isn’t it not running well on switch? What’s the general opinion?
---
Ye
---
Sure it works?
---
PS4 US, still unable to connect to host. Was hoping to get a few games in before football.
---
thanks mate
---
Yep
---
PS4 cannot connect to host
---
Lots of people. I never saw this many salties in a post, hilarious.
---
Yeah that rule is stupid
---
On xbox it's the other way around
---
Bruh i hate when they put ruin in places like that and then theyll hide your haunted grounds totems in super hard to find spots.
---
It’s totally fair to think it’s dumb but I and many other people enjoy it because of that. It definitely isn’t a masterclass of writing— in fact there’s a decent amount of objectively stupid shit— but it has its moments. The main reason I enjoy it is its creativity in its ideas and the personalities of some of the characters.
---
Well shit
---
Get the map for grim pantry , I think it is the black swamp map .grt flip flop , no mither , broil over with a exhaustion perk  . Every time you encounter the killer go the grim pantry and fall over there and use make him suffer as he can’t hook you outside . Do bring a sabo tool box and sabo the 2 hooks near it .
---
Very junji ito
---
If it makes you feel better, it probaply got taken down dince it was already under know issues on release of the ptb. Atleast i can see it under the patch notes.
---
If your on PC, turn off cross play. I just got into a match
---
servers are down
---
Too op pls nerf
---
You will not find someone who hates JoJo more than me, mostly because people don't fucking shut up about it everywhere, but the reason those quotes are the quoted ones is because how "bad" they are.
---
And I don't know what anime you're watching that is purely "lol, so random". Even JoJo has decent writing and some genuinely badass lines.
---
Yea depends on my mood when playing survivor. Sometimes I’ll say it fuck there’s no chance for the save and leave. Other times I’ll rush and see if I can get a save and expect to get killed but not it against the killer they’re doing what they’re supposed to.
---
This is a repost your so pathetic for thinking you can get validation by stealing someone else’s work your the  peak of garbage lol
---
I’d rather be working on a gen then go save them off the hook
---
Same, I can't change it at all.
---
EDIT: Seems you can change it only if you're at the MAIN menu - being in the survivor or killer menus greys it out.
---
Kill all the clauds.  I'm a Jake main but sometimes I'll run a Nea since I dig her too.
---
So I should be forced to play with a grey rank in a purple rank lobby that will probably get crushed in the first 2 minutes?
---
I wouldn't be against that.
---
Thrilling and I'm all ears are both great, surge is decent, and Blood Echo and Nemesis should be good/great.
---
The bigger problem with Killer perks is all the slowdown perks we're getting, which is why we're dealing with Forever Killers now.
---
But unless you set a timer every time someone gets unhooked, you have no way of knowing if their DS timer is still active or not.
---
Two man power through......
---
Turning off Crossplay (On PC here) works like a charme!
---
Weird, I turned mine off and I couldn't get into a game even after waiting for 45 minutes. Turned it back on and I get games within 3 minutes.
---
Wake Up and Pharmacy looks the same. Vigil looks mostly the same but it has a random survivor on it
---
Hasnt it always been available in SWF lobbies? I dont ever recall it not being there.
---
Is it still a purple, or did they change it to brown?
---
Has anyone DCed on deathhook to give the killer more points? Just me?
---
Damn right.
---
Hi salty, Im cynical.
---
Shame on me that I dont want the game to end in 5 minutes. Maybe stop and think why killers use those perks. When i play survivor I never get mad at killer perk choices.
---
I get a lot of death threats and "KYS FURRY F\*GGOT" on my profile comments
---
A well placed dead hard can make chases last an extra minute or more if you're going against a good survivor in a strong area.
---
Not all killers play Freddy who can completely shut down gens or Spirit who can end chases in the blink of an eye.
---
Better to do than*
---
/S
---
Easy cosplay and has mask to cover pimples
---
Ok i'll try it, thank you
---
Why?
---
Mine worked also but when my friends join it doesn't
---
Move over piker I've got we'll make it borrowed time and a med kit.
---
PS4.  Long wait times, multiple disconnect issues, high latency, rubberbanding.
---
What are the nerfs? Rarely play spirit and haven’t played in a while
---
Haha, I'm sorry that happened, but that actually really made me laugh though, just imagining this pissed off survivor willing to die instead of letting their pride down. I'm not judging at all, it just speaks to the petty in me and I love it.
---
PS4 here, US. Killeen wait time for was longer than us got tired of waiting for a lobby that wasn't coming (un readied and readied up again) switched to survivor and get " ERROR Connection with host found not be established. Please try again" hope this is fixed soon. My day off....
---
Decisive strike, self heal, adrenaline, sprint burst... might as well throw in one guy with object of obsession
---
I suggest cleaning the dust and dirt out of the fan and interior of the console. Mine used to be extremely loud and give off a ton of heat, but after I cleaned it out it works great.
---
I don't see anything odd. This is just standard Billy.
---
Yea if I see NOED I usually get out quick.
---
We got mixed reports, which is why we didn't update the post so far.
---
It's funny how they will Tbag and flashlight click and body block every other killer except when I use Spirit.
---
NOED is an instant "fuck outta here". I don't care who you are or what you've done, that shit is nightmarish on some killers.
---
When I play with my SWF group it's almost rare that all 4 of us get out. Usually it's 2 or just one of us escaping.
---
Stay strong chief
---
I’d support it no longer being an obsession perk, but gaining tokens from downing people would be a bit much in my opinion.
---
Yeah me too. I like the nurse now with more balance, shes not nufed to the ground. Shes in my list to learn after pig n freddy
---
Its a good point. Noed is strong because it is constant imo. Noed isn't really top tier either.. and I think its a more frequent situation than getting tunelled.
---
I don't consider perks that are situational to be top tier because you can go games without using them.
---
Yeah they'll complain about spirit but the minute they get what they want, a nonmeta killer using a nonmeta build, it's all gg ez's and \*clicks\* \*clicks\*
---
Thrilling is definitely good but I'm All Ears has too long of a cooldown imo, even tho it is godly on Nurse and a few others. 
---
Surge is straight ass. Too many restrictions and Blood Echo I feel will be lackluster on anyone but the killers with high mobility but we'll see. I do like the idea. And yeah, Nemesis will be good.
---
you should feel flattered, you killed it! -No pun intended lol
---
Don't do it. lol
---
I spawned in a match next to a generator and the moment I tapped it...BOOM Freddy Krueger
---
What's the best strategy to tap thrill of the hunt? I want to annoy the killer.
---
How is seeing Survivor ranked useful information lol
---
Yea
---
I love the fact that in high ranks you take the usual value of Desicive strike. One minute slug, because obviously no-one would pick you up, except if they aren't any obsession,but this is rare.
---
I use it less that i would expect, really. 
---
It is strange that people don't complain about is the broken combo of unbreakable+DS for a sure second chance. For Adrenaline,you must be really good to escape consistently and stay for the two last gens injured in order to take the value (or have the chance to get chased). A bit overated to be honest.
---
I hate the fact that if the killer decides to camp,you need either DC or BT, else you are dead. It is the reason that i use DC and i hate it, but there is not other other way to not get hooked again if the teammates don't have BT.
---
I get what you mean. You consider immediate value of perks to be more important than situational utility. But all the top tier survivor perks: dead hard, adrenaline, ds, and bt are all conditional. People running the meta build essentially have no immediate value from any of those perks and at the very start of the game have no advantages over someone going in perkless. However the conditions for these perks are very easy to meet. Dead hard, you are more than likely to be hit during the trial, ds you are more than likely to be hooked during the trial. Bt you are more than likely to have to save someone during the trial. And adrenaline gives advantage during the endgame. It is possible that you wont reach a condition for one of these perks but if you dont need say dead hard, then you are absolutely going to win that game. These perks give you strength when you are in a vulnerable position (injured, recently unhooked, going into end game) which is where you need advantage.
---
I actually ran a timer when searching for a match just to see how long it took to find one as killer.
---
It wound up being a wait time of roughly 11 minutes.
---
Lol I did this earlier this week too with a group of survivors as spirit. I’m on Xbox too
---
this did not work for me or my wife. we both turned off crossplay, then started receiving "error connecting to host"
---
Tru3ta1ent will prove you wrong
---
it's just stopped working. I assume this is because they are working on fixes, which resulted in the temporary solution failing
---
Then the queue is wrong.
---
I usually still pip in games like this. If you’re really running the killer for a decent amount of time and being that much of an asset to your team then you’ll climb soon enough. Green ranks are full of potatoes coasting by on meta perks, from what I’ve experienced. Not too difficult to get out of it though.
---
I've resorted to using a VPN to hop on to the US Datacenters. Not that bad, gives me 100-130 ping at worst, but the queues in Brazil, specially for killer are absurd. You sit for 10-15 minutes as a survivor, but as a killer, you'll be looking at one hour minimum, if you're lucky. At Rank 20 it's nowhere as bad, but once you near rank 12\~ then matches are flat out impossible to find at days. 
---
With the VPN, I've found more matches this week, than I have in the past months.
---
True... also some are VERY loud... looking at you Jeff
---
Oof someone has a peanut brain
---
The doctor is black bruh moment
---
Yea they require so much effort, it sucks. Honestly it wasn’t THAT bad until Plague. Now a big part of that was probably because by the time I got to her, I had ranked up a bunch and the survivors were better. I pretty much did the adepts in order. 
---
But yes the killer ones require way more effort than survivor. I did all of the survivor adepts in like 2 days. Just doing plague took me like 3 days of grinding for hours. And nothing was worse than a dc at the beginning or near the end of the game and some dick head had a key and jumps into the hatch lmao
---
happy birthday! hopefully you can juke some killers sooooon
---
You, my friend, seem to not play killer on high ranks at all
---
I’d let you stalk you til your tier 3 pops &lt;3
---
I almost always give hatch if I kill everyone too fast or if someone DCs. If that last person is downed, I keep dropping them until they break free and we look for hatch together. If I find hatch while they’re still alive, I close it and wait for them at the gate. It’s always funny because they try to run away from me but I sit there and wait for them to open the door. Eventually they pick up on it and I get hit with the wholesome “gg tysm”
---
Oh lol
---
There is bad matchmaking because it takes forever to find even matches.  Dodges make searching take even longer.
---
So I can play my Trapper now with guaranteed Ruin while I set up every single one of my traps for a perfect defense.  Sounds fair and balanced.
---
Got the same thing on PC
---
Down in Denver area so far all day.
---
And bill his smoke glitches sometimes so u can easily spot him in dark maps cause theres a line of smoke moving around, oh ans his super loud coughs of course or the heavy breathing, yea shouldnt smoke bill it gets you killed xd
---
almost five hours in and the issue still is not resolved :(
---
Woooooooow can't even do custom match way to fuck up .-.
---
Naw, I guess they're down, PS4 isn't working too
---
I get your point, completely. And I also get that it is important to make the game fun for survivors. Nobody would want to play it if you could just 4K easily with any killer against a great survivor group. But right now, the scales are tipped a bit too much in one way, and games against groups like these are just zero fun. Having to use a top tier killer with top tier perks and top tier add-ons to be able to end chases *instantly* and even have a chance in games like these just sucks. And even though survivors should have fun, it´s quite important for killers to have fun as well, otherwise the killers will just leave and survivors will have nobody to play against if games continue to look like these. 
---
I don´t even want this game to be competitive or something, but the current situation is not fun at all.
---
Servers are down and for some reason 2 minutes ago my KYF stopped working as well.
---
You know, I always set a low bar for communities, but they always astound me with their limbo skills. The goal of any nerf or buff is to get the killers on an even playing field. So if you have like 2 killers that seem OP and the rest suck, then yeah the answer is to nerf those two killers. And if you have like 2 killers that are noticeably worse? Buff them. It's not rocket science. Then once you do that you adjust the balance between killers and survivors by either nerfing or buffing survivors.
---
It's so slow that you shouldn't do it. It's better to miss the hex skill check than gen tap, since it's like you're able to work on the gen 80% of the time vs 50% tapping. Instead, if you miss a hex skillcheck (so don't fail but don't hit the 'great' area) just stop for like 2 seconds and keep going. The stop is because after missing the hex skillcheck you can't actually progress the gen but you can still get skillchecks, meaning if they have ruin you might just end up extending the time you can't progress the gen.
---
Amanda wore the mask in the movies and I also believe Hoffman wore it too. They wore it when they took the people Jigsaw wanted.
---
He's already broken in regards to game mechanics, he's just not lethal.  So, if he was made to be lethal.  Not even high tier, just mid-tier he'd be broken. (because he already is, it's just that he's weak)
---
Same happened to me, but I was Billy.
---
What's your gamertag? I'll check my recent players since I haven't played since then
---
Okay thanks for the advice!
---
Servers are down for everyone
---
pretty sure servers are down, not working for me either (PS4)
---
You get a notification the first time, it'll show up on the right side of the screen.
---
Damn. Welp now I have nothing to do for now because all of my other games aren't fun anymore
---
"The other two survivors will get 'em"
---
Ah yes, run this build for that 1 in 100 Toth game
---
I don't think you understand me. DS is situational in the sense there is only one time to use as well as it being very conditional. Sure lots of perks have conditions but some conditions are available to you through the whole game and multiple times. I.e. deadhard and bt.
---
Adrenaline is its own perk. will always trigger if you plan on escaping, which you do.
---
DS isn't in the same league, however it can get you out of a sticky situation.
---
PC player here. I have been having this same problem
---
No no no.
---
It's "Mori me mommy".
---
fffff man I wanna play. Come on servers, your survivor modes are lame
---
No worries, have fun dude
---
I don’t necessarily consider pipping in itself a win, but I do consider games where I played well, won chases, made big plays, or saved teammates to be wins; surviving is kind of irrelevant to me. And on games where I go full potato, pipping (or even safety pipping) can sometimes be a decent consolation prize. 
---
If you want more survival points, try running Deliverance if you can get the perk. Successful self-unhook gives a big chunk of survival points.
---
A lot of us are in the same boat. I was really looking forward to playing and having fun this morning but shit happens. They are looking into it so hopefully it gets fixed soon. See you in the fog!
---
Pc player same here too
---
No its just a fun stealth build which works very well... lmao its not just for toth. Calm spirit is only in there for fun.
---
Bold of you to assume Tapp isn't also urban evading. He needs those Stake Out stacks, remember?
---
I think it seems that way because killer perks are far more powerful than a single survivor perk, because they have to be - survivors have 4x the perks.  So people complain - even if the killer has the disadvantage overall.
---
"Unable to connect to the host": the error that pops up every times i start to search for a match.
---
I guess they're turning off the server to work on them...?
---
Servers are down, they've been looking into it for the past few hours
---
It’s not just you all players on all the platforms seem to be having the same problem
---
Yes they've been down for a few hours
---
Bride of Chucky in the evidence room. I loved that part. That also means that Chucky is part of the same world as others in DBD. We need Tiffany and Chucky lol.
---
I need game sense rather than perk assistance. If I rely on whispers then Im down one perk, but yeah i agree it does help big time with early game searches
---
Been down for like 5 hours. :(
---
Having 2 hits in the first chase defeats the purpose of the perk though, which is 1 hit before down
---
Thank you.  Just figured we would get some practice in on custom lobbies while servers were down but now I guess it's on to another game until servers are fixed.
---
So basically a better Bing Bong Boi
---
Here's something that's helped me.  During end game collapse don't go for the door, go for a chest.  If it's a key you might be able to get out on your own.  If not find the killer, drop the item on the ground.  You'd be surprised how many killers will let you live.
---
Did they state they will be down all day? I'm not seeing an update, but I am getting the connection error now that everyone else is getting.
---
Huh interesting
---
No mither doesn’t need a buff. Its meant to be a hard mode. What it should do is offer bonus BP, just like using add ons that nerf powers like padded jaws offer bonus bp
---
Nah. Xbox boi. Auto wreckers.
---
No it does not. You’re one hit for the rest of the game. I really don’t think being two hit for the first chase is a big deal. Especially for the reasons I stated. Anyone with No Mither is getting chased immediately and is not getting slugged. Being healthy at first at least hides that you have the perk. Otherwise the killer is going to know to just chase you.
---
The “purpose” of the perk is the reduced groans of pain, picking yourself up, and no blood. You would still get all that *after* being hit, without the killer knowing you have the perk. Starting off broken is a dead give away to the killer that you have No Mither (and probably the other perks that go with it such as Resilience). 
---
Just get chased as soon as possible/go for saves fo take hits, and you’ll be fine. Taking a hit and getting benefits afterwards is ten times better than “TUNNEL ME” being tattooed on your characters forehead with the broken status effect.
---
It makes it all that much sweeter when you finally go against a unique Killer or Survivor build made with love. Like when you have to really figure out which survivor is playing which role on the team or how the killer plans to roll together all of their perks
---
I absolutely love these posts and i hope the devs will listen and make this game more user friendly &lt;3
---
Really? Damn why are the servers down?
---
What a perfect jumpscare haha, I was looking for a hex totem with that title. You can just barely see his knife on the edge of the screen too, so scary. 👻
---
Pretty sure it’s because you escaped during your last vault. The three vaults have to be in the same chase. That’s what makes harvester a strong loop; survivors can easily break LoS and win the chase to prevent the game registering 3 vaults and blocking the window.
---
Simply then survivors would get the First hook done immediately and Progress without ruin. Done deal.
---
This idea though is bad.
---
I would like to have a different idea than punishing survivors for doing their objective.
---
Funny. Been playing customs for an hour on Xbox 🤷‍♂️
---
They are only live on PC and Switch right now.
---
It's still easy on a 1v1 level. Yeah it sucks when your teammates don't pull their weight but you can still do well
---
There's a dev message when you start the game up
---
More survivor buffs? Those are rly undestandable buffs but the weak killers are not doing so well.
---
Edit: The person who downvoted this is a fucking idiot who thinks that every killer should be nerfed to the ground so he can win he’s first game.
---
I understand what you mean, but look at that game. Even though he played a low-tier killer, he still had good perks, and he played as best as he could, and Otz is really not a low-skill player.
---
The survivor group did not even have a single toolbox. The only thing they had was *one Prove Thyself* to make gens faster. And they popped 3 gens in 2:45 mins. Imagine how it would look like if they had more gen tech like good toolboxes. And he cannot pressure four people at the same time across the entire map, even good killers have a hard time doing that. 
---
Gen speeds are just way too fast at the start of the game.
---
I had Steve with Bond purposefully sandbagging me while I get chased by killer who is tunneling me hardcore, he runs infront of pallets/windows so I cant go, drops pallets on me, bodyblocked so I cant move and get hit. I got so frustrated I just dced, imagine being tunneled + sandbagged. Solo survivor is just on another level of terrible
---
Same it literally just stopped working
---
Repost, no other comment needed
---
do you live under a rock
---
Just today I was the last survivor, hadn‘t been hooked yet. did the spinny thing on the ground, the killer (Legion) looked and me and nodded but hooked me anyway.   
---
I managed to unhook myself and apparently they were so impressed that I got the 4% that they led me to the hatch and even let me pallet stun them a few times. Super nice!
---
Nobody really knows but it sure is frustrating. They said they'll update us on twitter.
---
Right now you are able to search but im not sure if you will be able to find a lobby.
---
I don't get it, what's going on here?
---
Behaviour: *Adds a perk that only works on the third week of the month when it's not raining outside under a full moon during a presidential election that has a 47 year cool-down.*
---
Also Behaviour: Why doesn't anyone use our new perks?
---
Ikr it's 6pm over here and I ain't tagged a kill..
---
I mean played respectfully all day
---
Seems to be back up on Xbox. Currently on "Looking for match" with no error message. Will update in a moment.
---
This post seems like someone who sees a meme and immediately accuses the poster of the meme of being toxic and entitled.
---
Wow that sucks. Solo is a real gamble
---
I feel like the only reason color blind auras and everything else hasn’t been added because people that aren’t color blind will just use color blind settings to make the game easier for them
---
Did they clarify what they mean by swf?
---
A 2 &amp; 2 isn’t so bad. A full 4 man on comms is when it breaks the game. Regardless of ehat their stats say, pretty much everyone experienced with the game will tel you that a full 4 man swf breaks the game.
---
What do you want BHVR to come out and say though? “Yeah 4 man on comms offers a huge advantage but we aren’t going to change it as it would hurt the popularity of the game”
---
Or just “well according to our stats its not THAT much of an advantage”
---
They’re full of shit. On large maps 4 people on comms get to control the maps. They cant change it, swf is what really makes the game popular and it helps keep queue times even as it takes 4 survivors for 1 killer, so having survivor as the only way to play with friends helps that.
---
What they should do is shrink the maps which is what everyone has wanted for a longtime but they keep getting bigger and bigger and all the M1 killers with shit map pressure suffer for it.
---
Don’t do that. Don’t give me hope.
---
&gt;Survivor does 60% of their objective in the time it takes Killer to do 8.3% of their objective and Behaviour wonders why everyone ruins Ruin and NOED.
---
[Thank you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXJvOJNUlCs)

don’t run a hex perk then
---
Sexy Daddy Micheal
---
You definitely don’t understand the scoring of this game

If 15 seconds is nothing then why are you idiots complaining about sloppy butcher or pop? Sloppy adds like 3 seconds to the healing time while pop adds just under 20 of slowdown speed and requires the killer to spend a much longer amount of time finding, chasing, and hooking a survivor.
---
PTB.exe
---
Add in long queue times and godawful matchmaking and I wonder why no one plays on PTB.
---
Yeah that was an interesting match. All I could think of is prepare for trouble and make it double, lol.
---
It´s not like Ruin somehow stops gens from popping. Good survivors can work their way through Ruin easily and just do a gen anyway while you are setting up your "perfect defense".
---
And even if you do set it up, it´s not like it will automatically win you the game. At least maybe survivors will need to invest in perks like Small Game and actually change from their meta D-Strike, BT, Adrenaline and whatnot loadouts and give something up to actually have to counter what the killer does.
---
Why would you ever run sloopy on plague lol
---
How else are we supposed to win with everyone running adrenaline and ds at high ranks
---
TBH there's better ways to say it but the sense of entitlement from the community on Twitter is literally the worst from key comments... 
---
Servers have gone down, it's Sunday, they've updated us... instead of pretending the sky is falling find something else to do other that shit posting to people trying to resolve an issue 🤷‍♂️. Cause the majority of what I'm seeing on twitter is just ruuuuuuude
---
It’s always the bubba
---
Still searching, common xbox players, let's get this going!
---
Thank you. Any news on PS4 servers?
---
I would like to point out that the gaping wound thing would be very hard to add for a surprising number of reasons
---
I can agree with it going away when they touch a totem or a gen. 
---
As far as it going away when they heal, I’m fine with it as long as it only goes away after they finish healing, not when they start.
---
Isn't calm spirit about crows?
---
Ur feng looks weird
---
That's pretty cool.
---
There is no vault into drop on disturbed ward, just drops. That map is OP for survs with or without BL because the center has two strong windows and loads of pallets. Yes BL is useable there, but the nerfed BL is only slightly weaker there since the drops dont have vaults. 
---
Harvesters are countered by simply running the other way around to force the survivor to leave. The harvester blocks LOS almost completely so it's easy to catch survivors by doubling back.
---
Ormond has a couple vaults into drops, but the pathing on them is very long so you can only get two vaults on them anyways (which you can do with the new one.) The vaults also have drop downs that arent vaults right next to the window so the killer can use those instead (similar to badham 2 story.) 
---
BL is only overpowered in situations where you can continuously chain vault drops. Haddon has numerous strong vault drops that can be run over and over safely. Myers house, small basement RNG window and both other 2 stories.
---
Workaround for some is to disable cross-play, restart game and steam. It is not working for me at all.
---
I don't get it. How does Calm Spirit counter BBQ?
---
I love how gunky and gross the original hair is. I definitely think her hair deserves to looks gnarly and disgusting and smelly
---
Its all the shit killers who hard tunnel all game that are responsible for DS being buffed through the roof.
---
Funny watching that though. DS to save them when they play unsafe running near the killer or trying to slam gens while injured, dead hard when they make a mistake on a pallet, adrenaline so they dont need to worry about healing and can just rush gens. Survivors have so many perks that allow them to play aggressively and have no fear or to fix their mistakes. The only one killers really have is NOED which nobody likes.
---
Shit killers cant do anything. So the devs nerf nurse and spirit but do nothing for the shit killers. Look at the most recent changes for wraith last year or pig this year, they didn’t really do all that much for them in the grand scheme of things.
---
Also not surprising Otz got genrushed. The game is balanced around killers getting a 2k. Most killers take Ruin, the game is balanced on all these games where ruin is present. You’re literally handicapping yourself by not taking Ruin or at least something to help you out early game.
---
I hate survivors who do this so much, I know it works and I don't blame them for doing this, but if I ever get my hands on them, I'll do all the things that the survival rulebook doesn't approve of.
---
I see this as an absolute win!
---
I see it as adult horror hide and seek and I need that adrenaline rush!
---
P2 with Spaghetti hair, nothing special
---
A better option would be for them to remove the ranking system completely and let everyone play with everyone.
---
There is absolutely ZERO need for this game to have a ranking system.
---
It splits the player base similar to how not having a DLC doesnt let you play with other who has DLC in certain games. 
---
If there was no ranking system there would be no queue time for survivor or killer.
---
Adrenaline will never proc if the killer is good.
---
Same on PC, so I'm not sure what OP is dealing with. I queue as survivor and get a match in 20 seconds, queue as killer and it takes 3-5 min
---
I usually let the last survivor go if I killed all the others and this one time the guy was at the exit gate. I usually down them before I let them go (I don’t know if it’s because of how the old hatch worked and it just being a habit or if it’s just to assert dominance over the survivor), but this survivor was pretty good at the game and looped me the almost the entire time. At this point I panicked and signaled the survivor to open the exit gate. He literally escaped right before the timer ran out and we had a nice wholesome chat afterwards.
---
I disagree, i define exhaustion perks as something you can use on demand and is put on CD. Adrenaline is too confined to be considered on demand compared to the next minimum being a high place/ locker for 3 seconds, and it cant be used more then once.
---
Just cause it causes exhaustion doesn't mean its an exhaustion perk, since it can be used while exhausted.
---
It counters Iron Maiden. You jump into a locker to avoid bbq but then Iron Maiden leaves you exposed and makes you scream when you come out of the locker. So calm spirit keeps you from screaming
---
or 1 day bloodpoint event !
---
There needs to be a rule about blatantly stealing other peoples work on this sub reddit.
---
Survivors: “I’m tired of the same killers run in the same perks, I wish there was some variety.” 
---
Also Survivors: *Runs the most optimal builds, same 5-6 perks, doesn’t heal, hugs low interaction loops, prioritizes gens over anything else* “Why don’t killers play less optimally? It’s more fun for me that way”
---
Yeah but I’m just searching indefinitely I’m not getting any matches
---
Still no match found. Ugh the hope ...!
---
You know what. As a wrestling fan this is absolutely true
---
There's nothing to disagree with.  If it causes exhaustion it's an exhaustion perk.  Adrenaline is an exhaustion perk.
---
That’s weird I’m on Xbox and my killer queue is instant but I gotta wait like 8 minutes to find a match as survivor
---
I'm not saying it's perfect but that's the absolute worst map for it.
---
yeah but you still wont have the perks and levels.
---
As a spirit main, the beads change was not even close to the worst nerf in the patch. The true horror is the lost collision during spirit walk which makes it much harder to find people with iron will and makes blocking pallets impossible.
---
The beads change does nothing, survivors will either stop doing gens everytime you start spirit walk or they will ignore it and get caught anyway.
---
How do u ignore a bodyblock again? hm seems like u still dont have a grasp of the situation make it to red ranks as killer and come back to us little one. I have spoken
---
Same, unfortunately
---
Yet it can be used while exhausted, that is a defining point of exhaustion perks. To become exhausted from doing something. Its an exhaustion perk in word, not in usability.
---
When I’m low tiers I play wraith (still waiting for a buff) but if play him at high ranks I get bullied so I switch to Freddy
---
Exactly. I’m rank 1 on both sides and I would love to mix up perks and try fun builds. If I did that gens would be done in 4 minutes and it would be game over lol. I still occasionally ends up in games where gens are going so fast it’s insane, running ruin and pop, because it’s SWF or they’re just really coordinated. 
---
BHVR needs to adjust the game by adding more survivor objectives and possibly reworking how generators get repaired. In high ranks, any killer perk that doesn’t give you information to find a survivor and a means to slow them down is worthless. It would be nice to see that change.
---
I'f there are Mori's there should be keys even though both are OP
---
If you're playing on Windows and want something that might help:
---
1. Settings
---
2. Ease of access
---
3. Color filters
---
I'm genuinely sick of waiting its been 6 hours. Before you say go outside its me sunday off I wanted to relax all day :(
---
Honestly it should've been nerfed. It outclassed almost every other exhaustion perk besides Dead Hard
---
I can't a game as killer.
---
Ignoring the post to say o feel bad for the killer in the first picture
---
So how do you cleanse them.
---
This makes no sense?
---
CI is better on trapper/hag anyway.
---
Oh shit sorry didn't know
---
It has two benefits
---
Perfect.
---
That's the image I'll keep of you
---
Ouch
---
You got small brain?
---
Edit: Just a couple of minutes ago, servers have died and couldn't connect even on any gamemode.
---
And here is basically the result of messing around "trying" Kill Your Friends lobby.
---
Yeah, it worked for a while and now it's not working any more.
---
Same mate same.
---
It's possible, but how does calm spirit counter BBQ?
---
Sad thing is, the emblem system rewards both sides for longer games but a ton of survivors still genrush every game and end it in &lt;4 minutes.
---
That’s not what the post is saying lmao
---
I'll use stalk when I sneak up on a group, but he's not Michael so I feel like stalking individual survs is a waste of time
---
Please explain
---
Ruin is kinda needed
---
No outside the terror radius borrowed time doesnt activate. Tier 1 myers doenst have one.
---
Why is this taking so long to fix? This is just stupid. Like other have said today is my day off and i want to play this game!
---
This is what it sounds like trying to get a bag of chips in the middle of the night
---
Iron Maiden makes you one shot but also makes you scream to reveal your location. Calm Spirit prevents you from screaming. Meaning you can still hid in a locker without being found after popping out
---
He looks like Bill Cosby lol
---
It creates Exhaustion.......Exhaustion perk.  I'm not going to describe this logic further because there's no other way to say it, it's already been reduced to it's most basic elements.  Not worth going in circles on this.  You're free to rationalize it however you like personally though.
---
GET BHVR'ED
---
Oh okay, thanks I love you &lt;&lt;&lt;3333
---
wanna play surv with me and se if we can join?
---
He has to use it first, then you can see it to cleanse it.
---
I'll hit an Unnerving Overcharge skillcheck one day. You'll see.
---
I honestly don't know where these kinds of sycophants come from. It's quite clear that this was an intentional thing they designed, to even the gap between SWF and solo players, not a bug. The community gave critical reception to this feature and it's neither "game-breaking" nor a "bug".
---
Thank you devs. Now even if I want to play the game, I cannot. Best update tbh
---
I was one of the few who thought the recharge + speed addons were also bullshit in addition to beads
---
All I can say is good luck
---
You’re welcome
---
Spine chill and bond, no joke. Spine chill counters stealth killers and gives you a head start on hiding/being chased off a gen, and it's especially good with sprint burst. Bond gives you so much information. For example if there's no one on your end of the map you can be confident that the killer is busy on the opposite side, if someone goes down you don't have to save since someone is closer, etc.
---
Then thats obviously what they will do. PS5 and Xbox players will finally be able to play DBD with good FPS
---
I literally cant play survivor with randoms because I get one hooked and none of my teamates even attempt to go for me
---
Thanks for clearing that up, really appreciate it. But I’m also wondering how he started in that state, don’t you have to build up your tiers?
---
I'm in
---
When I play killer, some survivors try to be friendly but then they dc if I down them
---
most of us(from the killers I've talked to) got tired of being taken advantage of and belittled by survivors when we were giving it an honest attempt to not be a dick head. literally every single game that i play 99% of the game i won't facecamp a hook. i only resort to that once the exit gates are open and i will still get called a shitry toxic camper who needs to die. or if i can literally only find one person all game so i hook them three times before hooking someone else I'm a toxic tunneling pussy. imo survivors are way too entitled to a "fair game" that they think killers should be forced to play suboptimal because they were dog shit and lost to me despite not having ruin
---
*alters ruin with something more interesting* 
---
#TING TING TING TING TING 
---
“LMAOO GG EZ BABY KILLER”
---
If he doesnt stalk then he doesnt get out of tier 1. The penalty for this is that he is very slow if he doesnt stalk.
---
That is completely true. This post really does come out as bashing survivors, where in reality killers can be pretty shitty. Stuff like Moris is completely stupid for the health of the game, and if DS didn´t exist you could just completely tunnel someone easily and ruin his game, and many killers still do that. But right now, stuff like DS is way overtuned and even killers who don´t tunnel suffer because of it.
---
Your second paragraph is exactly the issue. Looking at the survivor loadouts, one Prove Thyself is the only thing they had to improve gen speeds. No toolboxes, no other perks to improve gen speed, yet they have 3 gens done before the third minute of the match. They can completely spec their entire loadouts with perks that help their chases and saves, and they still rush through gens in no time. Imagine what a SWF with 4 toolboxes and other perks could do. 
---
Devs mentioned that they want to "buff solo survivors to the level of SWFs and then buff killers to match" but I have no idea how they are actually going to do that, and buffing aura reading perks won´t do it. SWFs can still completely throw aura reading perks out the door, have one Object and then run whatever they want, while solo survivors will have to stuff their loadouts with aura reading and not have the full Adrenaline/BT/DS/whatever combo. It´s not a good approach.  
---
The fact that the game is balanced about the best killers getting a 2K with the best perks is just crazy. Especially when that is what the killer needs to do, when survivors don´t need to alter their loadout at all to finish gens in minutes anyway.
---
Context?
---
If they buff weak killers they’re gonna fuck those bad killers up by making them too strong and unfun
---
It's not even as bad as it used to be. Waiting 50-70 minutes to find a single match, with the possibility of an instant dodge, was how it could be for me. BHVR has actually done better on this regard.
---
Matchmaking servers are down
---
I play killer, and in red ranks. So I hope to have a ‘balanced’ view point instead of screeching on one side or the other.
---
1) Not running a hex or corrupt is just asking to get bullied.
---
2) Doctor is pure ass at higher ranks, stop using him. I don’t think he got one survivor into tier 3 either. Wait for the rework.
---
3) DS isn’t really that big of a deal. He literally mentions he needs to tunnel to put pressure.
---
4) Adrenaline activates? You probably already lost if 4 survivors w/ 0-1 hooks are left with all gens done.
---
You mean electrical vibe check
---
There’s no problem with using those perks but it’s definitely not a waste considering how strong they are.
---
Oh urban has its uses for sure, especially against Hag. It's just so many people use it to play fully immersed which hurts the team over all usually.
---
No, I dc'd multiple times and nothing happened (Because ppl were not the new killer or the reworked killers)
---
i saw a guy on here say Dec 6th, but IDK. Can't wait either.
---
Sure. my steam username is khanstent
---
nice
---
oof it's back to the old error.. :/
---
No wonder my dumbass has so much trouble against gordon. I need to do my fuckin' homework.
---
Still the entire ruin mechanic is frustrating to deal with.
---
Just because everyone runs it doesnt mean its Good for a game. If you were to make the tutorial give 100k BP each time people will do that instead of going into games.
---
And what you Are proposing is just extending gen time by giving the ruin Effect.
---
TRAPPER TIDDY
---
same, except it isn't even my day off. i have to get ready for work in a few hours and i want to play!
---
Appreciate the Ardetha reference lmao
---
Imagine the bara 🥰
---
Just don't get your hopes up or you will be disappointed. Maybe when the Survivors start to cry that lobbies take forever to find something will happen, but i doubt  that. I bet they have plans in the working to nerf other Killers aswell, like Huntress and GF.
---
a small buff, just like the small nerf the spirit and the nurse got, life quality changes. oh... username checked
---
Lmao didn’t say pls nerf gonna main the fuck out of him
---
Does anyone know if Kill Your Friends still works with current server issues?
---
AAH
---
OOH
---
OOH 
---
AAH 
---
its the arua effect that survivors have to deal with everygame i dont mind the killer getting bloodpoints
---
Agreed
---
JonOfDoom, 25% of a gen isn't actually 25 seconds, a base gen with one person working on it takes 80 seconds so the very most a killer can get out of it is only 20 seconds of time.
---
Kilers wouldn't have to run this build if gens didn't get done so fast
---
For a short time while the servers were down, players on PC were able to get into functioning lobbies by turning off Crossplay, which for some reason reverted the bug. This crossplay feature is what allowed people who bought DBD on the Windows Store to play DBD with people who owned it on Steam, but now that everyone turned it off (and will likely never turn it on again after this fiasco), their queues are going to be horrific.
---
I like the idea but I can imagine people who are savvy enough and paying close attention might recognize your bleedout bar is going down slower and deduct you're running Unbreakable.
---
Even these small skillchecks aren't hard to hit, it's really just low FPS, nonexistent optimization, and lag, that gives their perceived difficulty.
---
I hate nothing more than running the killer around for a bit, zero gens done and then when on the hook seeing some little fucker UE around the outside of the map doing nothing.
---
Interesting. It doesn't even let me disable the crossplay option on my pc
---
I think so, same problem. Now if i try to find a match it says "Connection to host not found, Please try again"
---
unfortunately, today has been really rough on PC, and I am having more connection issues than PS4, I think.
---
i really want to play survivor tbh, but the maps being semi random makes it hard. i haven't played long enough to know where every pallet/ vautable object is and the maps not always being the same makes that even harder to learn. and its easier to learn the maps playing killer cuz i have the whole game to learn it vs getting killed first cuz i don't know where any pallets are
---
Yeah I bought it. It’ll be good to have for the holiday travels. Plus the included dlc is Spirit, the Doc, Hag, &amp; Clown so for $20 that’s worth it to me.
---
glad to see other clown enthusiasts, big belly boi is indeed in need of attention.
---
I've seen old nurse gameplay and she looked fun tbh
---
Unnerving presence,5 stack huntress lullaby, madness tier 2, and overcharge. Hit that, I dare you.
---
It does. Or did one hour ago.
---
nope.avi
---
It is the same for me. I restarted the computer and steam. Issue is still there.
---
No thanks I am going to end the rift for chrismast and I dont want to wait more than a month for rift 2 electric boogaloo
---
Sorry for the quality but the story was good. I was the last one alive against the killer with no where left to loop. I stood still and accepted my fate, and the killer slapped me to my knees. After being picked up, she wondered through the map for hatch. After the game, she came to tell me that I was the cutest Nancy she’s ever seen and for that reason, let me live. Moral of the story, this game is pay to win (I’m kidding, but it was fun to see play out nevertheless)
---
Nope, just tried it about 20 minutes ago.
---
I use a custom NVidia filter already, the problem is Console players have no such option, and the fact that you have to use external software for something like this that is borderline an industry standard at this point (and has been requested for years as it is) with near radio silence on when/if it'll even be implemented is frustrating for players without a third-party option to say the least
---
Why didnt you go on the gen at the start.
---
Quality clip regardless
---
You need to be in the main menu, not in a lobby.
---
Oni got some nice pecs too yall
---
lol same thing. servers are down i've learned. have not tried to turn off crossplay, as all my time for gaming was wasted this morning trying to queue up for something that would never work.
---
  I've been wanting to play all day, it's my last rest day before I pack before a move. I wanna procrastinate effectively ya know!
---
What’s that bottom charm I haven’t seen it
---
bullshit
---
I’m very creative.
---
My main Doctor build is Overcharge, Distressing, Unnerving, and BBQ.
---
If you're feeling sadistic replace BBQ with something else (Franklin's, Hex: Huntress lullaby, Coulrophobia, etc.) run double calm addons and use a Jigsaw Piece. Absolute misery to play against since your terror radius will cover 90% of the map in treatment mode, meaning everyone will be gaining madness and debuffs from Unnerving Presence and whatever 4th perk you decide to run if it's a terror radius perk. 
---
Franklin's Hag is another fun one. Trap peoples items and they'll usually set the traps off returning to grab their flashlight.
---
1) Yeah, and that is the problem. Look at the survivor group loadouts. They had ONE Prove Thyself. Literally nothing else to speed up gen progression, yet they managed 3 gens in less than 3 minutes. Meanwhile killer has to dedicate a slot in his loadout to at least have a chance, while the survivor group is free to run perks that help them in chases or unhooks and still rush gens easily. 
---
2) I agree, Doctor is a shitty killer, and hopefully a rework will come soon. Still, I think the problems in the video are apparent regardless of which killer he used, you cannot possibly pressure the entire group around the entire map in the first 3 minutes of the game
---
3) It kind of is a big deal when they can get free 60 seconds of doing anything they want after being unhooked, and the killer cannot do anything other than down them and wait it out, or get stunned. Chases already need to be ended quickly, and extended chase can lose you the game and if you down them you either go pressure somewhere else and leave them to be easily picked up, or you try to defend them and give the team free gen time. I have nothing against DS to help against tunelling as it was intended, but currently it is just overtuned and gives survivors an easy way to ignore mistakes.
---
4) Sure, in this specific scenario, maybe. It also is the difference between actually getting a kill or two or leaving empty handed as he did. We could argue about this specific scenario, but I think we both know why Adrenaline is a top tier perk and why it is so strong.
---
there is a key on your keyboard called print screen. it takes a screenshot of your screen.
---
Lol I’ll start looking for this then.
---
1 dc the second they saw it was the spirit, then insta tunnel once you've been injured. 3 gens left, hence me looking at the screen like "huh?"
---
Today’s been non existent on PS4, cant get a game
---
Oh also: it's you're not your: if you want to spit out bs at least do it correctly
---
I know, I’m just stupid. I’ll keep this in mind
---
Bond and Iron Will.
---
Tunneling people isn’t fun. As I mentioned, I play killer and it’s really not that big of a deal to chase after someone else. 
---
I don’t use adrenaline when I play SWF, neither do most of my friends. We prefer to use perks that are viable for the entire game rather than something that may not even benefit you.
---
Honestly the combination of super survivor sided map, one of the worst killers, poor perk choice, and a good SWF group led to the being bullied. Yes there are ways the devs can address this, but finger pointing at DS is one of the last things on my list.
---
Same, think I got it down to thirteen. I’ve only been playing a couple weeks and I don’t understand how this game could be so poorly optimized two years after release. Constant DC’s, party errors and crashes take the already 10 min que time and make it 20-30 sometimes. Insanely frustrating that they keep adding new stuff when their game plays like it’s pre-launch.
---
Getting slugged because the killer sees someone near doesnt bug me. Getting slugged with nobody near, nobody injured, and 5 gens left is soooooo fucking annoying and dooshy.
---
I was just about to say lol would you rather hang?
---
He said pretending to be a member of the legion and having fun is “CrInGy”
---
You ought to wiggle unless you’re last alive.
---
Servers are down, yes. If you're on pc you can try to disable cross play in your menu settings and then try to find a match. Some users were reporting that disabling it fixed their problem.
---
How do you even do this?

---
True. Over the last couple of months I feel like my friends and me get kicked or separated during matchmaking more than we get into a lobby without issues.
---
I dont see anything he could have done better in this particular case, so from his perspective the game was really hopeless, sure. At the same time 4 survivors played this very well and abused their advantages, so they won **_DESERVEDLY_**.   
---
Streamers blow this issue way out of proportions, especially some really talented guy, who can go on a tangent about gen speed for hours, and then still get 75% 4ks during one stream with just about every killer. You got played this time, move on. It's not like every single lobby is 4man SWF.  
---
DS isnt unfair, if you downed a guy so quickly that he has DS up then youve tunneled him. Even if youve chased a surv straight to the hook who went for the rescue and immediately downed the unhooked surv again. It's not a punishment for you that you cant immediately rehook him, it's a more of a safety net for the surv. Im so sick of this onesided viewpoint.  
---
And it's not like you are standing in a corner frozen waiting for DS to expire, you have one guy out of the race, another one possibly waiting for an opportunity to heal him up, so gen repair speed is reduced for the time being. Just go and chase/down another survivor in that time.
---
Feels solo queue man...
---
I once tried playing completely "fair" without any camping or tunneling for a dozen of games on all killers in the game (except trapper and huntress, because I don't play them) and it was really miserable experience. Sure, I got some kills and sometimes even 4k if I was much better than survivors, but against SWFs or really good solo's I barely could do anything as it was impossible to apply enough pressure to stop them from doing their objective quickly.
---
I don't hardcamp or tunnelvision 1 survivor, yet the most optimal strat in the game is to choose 2 survivors and just hook them till they die instead of hooking everyone.
---
Ok, thanks
---
Adrenaline is by literal definition an exhaustion perk bud.
---
Nice haha, I recently bought the nightmare chapter so I only play as Quentin now. That’s interesting about the revealer/hiding character, from my short time on this subreddit it seems to go the other way around haha.

Not true at all, I’m in red ranks on both killer and survivor. Now, as a survivor, I can SWF and run no perks but still make a pip easily by looping, doing gens, making some saves. I don’t really need anything special. DS? Nah. As long as my friend got borrowed time I’ll make it out of a tunneling situation. Exhaustion perks? Anything will work, it’s all the same for me. On the other hand, when I play killer, and I try to be creative, I’ll always get punished. There’s no way I can use a mid tier killer such as wraith or clown and not run ruin or BBQ. Games will go by so fast you just can’t hook everyone three times. Exception of spirit nurse and billy. I believe, as I play during rank resets, that it’s possible to be creative in green ranks for killer. But as survivor gets more and more efficient, it’s no longer viable to not be equally efficient on the killer’s side and frankly the killer only has that many perks that’s truly functional to slow the game down. Ironically when you slow the game too much such as forever Freddy build, it become every survivor’s source of complains. So it’s hard to find that balance ain’t it.

Christ alive 3 comments? Someone's mad
---
I said this to someone on twitter and was told to stop defending a multi million dollar company. Like the dev coming in on his day off is getting the million dollar thanks for sorting the issue. Nah mate, they're on a yearly salary like you or I... 🤷‍♂️ It's not rocket science.
---
Now it's not working even with crossplay disabled on PC EU.
---
Good job devs
---
As many have said, it’s often based on how a player acts in the match. If they play the game straight and act like a good kid, I’ll be inclined to let them go. I’m more inclined if there were DCs or they did something that amused me during the game.
---
Did I say it was somthing special? No I simply said it looked weird with the bloody ass outfit and then the clean golden hair and white ghost makeup face.
---
No Mither and Inner Strength cause %&amp;*$ it lets go.
---
I am honestly not even finger pointing at DS alone. It´s not about DS, as I mentioned in other comments, it is about gen speeds. The fact that survivors can finish 3 gens in less than 3 minutes without even bringing in any proper gen tech is just stupid. Sure, as you said, killer can bring Ruin, but survivors can also bring more gen tech, and you have the same problem again.
---
Literally 1 challenge away from completing level 2 and this happens. Bang up job.
---
My friends and I call clown the absolute unit or clownford
---
This seems like a good plan, I’ve only played as the killer a few times and while it’s frustrating, I’m fine with pallet stuns but I hate the ones that just taunt you afterwards and then run for another pallet.

Lmao that’s what bitching is yes

Just being bored that the servers are down. I play on xbox

I said he looks like Azog the Defiler the last time someone posted him maskless
---
Survivor i reckon?
---
Ah I hear ya. Hopefully servers come back up soon.
---
Probably not, just made me wonder after seeing it last night. I could def agree with letting someone go if their team DCs though or if they’re the only ones doing gens.
---
They must fit at least 1 of 3 criteria:
---
1) Baby Dweet
---
2) Scoops Ahoy Steve
---
3) Booped the snoot if I was playing Pig
---
NOED, Injured, chainsaw/stalk/EW3/iri head/make your choice/ devour hope / haunted grounds/red head pinky finger. Too many variables to just say “body block”
---
Nope it isn't servers are complicated mess to deal with
---
Even as killer it's exhausting running Ruin every match. Lots of fun perks but if you don't build around slowdown you just get your shit stomped in 5 minutes.
---
On Switch. "Error. Connection with host could not be established. Please try again". I was playing just fine only a few hours ago.
---
Man youtubers will get so fucked by COPPA if even DBD streamers get flagged as "for kids".
---
Like 8 hours now.
---
Yeah I was just warning you not to talk in absolutes when arguing
---
Add in Madness effect ;)
---
Why don’t you be friendly and let the killer get the 4th kill to pip
---
Man I just got Feng Min too :(
---
An example of that happening in some sense is in league of legends. For awhile it was blue and purple but they had a colorblind setting to change it to blue and red, everyone liked those colors more so they made the default the colorblind option and then made the old version and option you could use (which I think they ended up taking away anyways since so few people used it) so if people all used the colorblind function in this game then they could go that same route
---
I'm pretty sure people are aware of how BS those are. I think Huntress is on the radar for an add-on rework, but not anytime soon I believe
---
That seems like a fun way to play honestly, everyone gets a fun experience out of it all hopefully. I think I’m rank 16 but i don’t really care about all of that either, I just enjoy the game and the thrill of trying to escape haha.
---
I’m not specifically referring to you, but this sub and the title of the video. 
---
Anyhow most games don’t end up like that. The video had a lot of wrong things going in at once, not really the players fault and out of his control.
---
When I was just starting it was almost purely based on who made it the longest. Sometimes that’s still the key factor. That said, there are a lot of things survivors can do to annoy me and ensure that I’ll go out of my way to make them 2nd to last instead of last alive. 
---
**Personal pet peeves:**
---
-Survivors who hide. I run BBQ, I want my bonus BP. If I haven’t seen you all game, you can bet you’re getting hooked the second I find you, sometimes even if teammates abandoned you or if you’re last alive (I almost always give hatch over going for a 4k bc I don’t particularly care about ranking up as killer and I like giving somebody a good experience). 
---
-Survivors who leave teammates to die on first hook. Big no-no. I go out of my way not to camp, so if you can’t be bothered to stop hiding in some grass on the far side of the map and make the save, expect no mercy. 
---
-Survivors who make cheeky plays like bodyblocks or circle downed teammates like vultures waiting to farm unhooks. Sometimes I’m not bothered, sometimes you might experience some mild tunneling as a side-effect of your smartassery. 
---
-Sandbagging, intentional or otherwise. 
---
**Things I like to see:**
---
-Good loopers who manage to keep me in chase for a hot minute or pull off some clever plays; If I think you played well I’m more likely to make sure you’re last alive. Any successful teammate saves (flashlight/pallet), especially those that catch me totally off-guard, also count. 
---
**Things that make me more inclined to have pity:**
---
-teammates DCing, farming you, sandbagging you, etc 
---
-complete and utter potato on an otherwise competent team. Either you’re new or you’re having one hell of a bad day; either way, I feel sorry for you. 
---
**GUARANTEED HATCH** (at least as long as you weren’t a sandbagging dickhead)
---
-snoot boops
---
-not wiggling after I down you *if you’re last alive* 
---
Worth noting that a lot of killers won’t give anyone hatch regardless, especially the more you climb. Still nice though.
---
EDIT: Wanted to add some things I do that tend to help me get hatch when I’m survivor. If I’m downed and on death hook and no one’s around for a save, I’ll give up on recovering or crawling away and shake my head ‘no.’ (Spinning in circles can also work.) If I’m second to last alive and I’m slugged, I crawl somewhere obvious out in the open and start spinning *after the killer has successfully downed or hooked my teammate*. No point in dragging the game out/making it more difficult, they’ve won regardless and being easy to find might just endear you to them. I generally don’t wiggle if I’m on death hook, and *definitely* not if I’m last alive. No matter what. They wanna toy with me, whatever; they won anyway, I’m not bothered if they want to gloat a bit. Finally, I will sacrifice life and limb and (arguably) even throw the game in order to boop the snoot, no matter how many times I’ve been downed. It is the most important thing.
---
I have 5 prestige 3-50 killers and 2 survivors too and, most importantly, I have almost all teachable perks so I don't think I'm ready to do it all again (aside from cosmetics, having completed the challenges so far and more things).
---
same here in PC US northeast
---
Well ruin does exactly that. So i dont see a difference between giving a default ruin and increasing gen times
---
I have never tunneled or camped and I get 4ks all the time it’s probably just your skill level
---
PS4, central America, it doesn't search for a match at all, just disconnects you from host after 1 second of looking
---
Yeah, tru3 is definitely not someone to watch if you dislike negativity.
---
That makes us two fools then :)
---
You should try leaning and not think it's bad like everyone is making it to be. You'll really change your mind about saying that. Of course, if you really can't stalk someone for a particular reason, that's when you just use your stealth for a silent attack. His stalk is waaayy better than Michael's when he's leaning behind a wall. Not leaning is slow without add-ons, and I feel that's where people are saying it's bad. Like you said, he's not Myers, nor should you play like one.
---
OP shitposts about it at this point because when they first started they had already shown why it was a needed thing for colorblind people and even showed what it looks like to colorblind people in game so people who aren't would understand more. There's no point in posting the exact same images to make people see the reason behind it because then it'd just get taken down, plus people respond to memes better at this point anyways
---
At least you got a wall next to it. There's a totem location on Disturbed Ward that's just in an open field. No walls or rocks near to hide it, not even grass.
---
Lmao xd r/pcmasterrace yeah?
---
Leaning used to be good before Dedicated servers
---
I even got stuck in the pallet lol
---
you mean Herman.
---
 Error. Connection with host could not be established. Please try again 
---
PC, central north america. :(
---
Nurse, Spirit, Hillbilly and Freddy. Ghostface is rising as well.
---
And Spine Chill
---
Usually I let remaining survivor(s) escape if either they had one or more DC’s, if they were good sports and/or if I felt like I farmed enough bp; I feel like the 5000bp for escaping are a good compensation for any of the above.
---
Also, if I happen to be playing the Legion, I won’t kill any Jeff because lore.
---
I've seen this from a killers perspective but was dumbfounded as what the hell he was talking about. I figured they were just stuck in the pallet with others trying to make a move 7 steps ahead of what's happening
---
...why noed tho
---
This poor sweetheart still doesn't understand how she was completely wrong, and then her own logic was used against her directly...and she still didn't get it :-)
---
No. No in every possible language and synonym. 
---
There absolutely is need for Skill-based matchmaking (SBMM), else you'd have situations where baby survivors / killers are put against 1000+ hours opponents and get demolished. You think the new players will want to keep playing after that multiple times? You think the high ranked killer / survivor is having fun besting people who barely know how to play? 
---
It sucks when you're in high ranks and feel like you're going against super sweats every other game, sure, but it's not going to happen EVERY game you play. 
---
Matchmaking does it's best to sort players into games which are evenly matched in skill, making it the most fun on average. Removing it makes every game a random coin toss on "will it be fun and balanced?", "will I just waltz through this with little effort?", or "will I get my ass kicked and barely get to play?"
---
its 3am and this cracked me up
---
Why would anyone use it though? It often takes longer to mori someone than it does to hook them.
---
Literally same. Shite day
---
Yet the survivors are also using Adrenawin, sprint burst, DS, and BT.
---
I have mild colorblindness, I'm unable to see red in particular. I can deal with auras but sometimes I can have a fair bit of trouble seeing blood/ scratch marks, I really with that they would just add colorblind settings for those.
---
They're trying their best, dude.
---
Thanks epicgizmo, very cool!
---
Hex entity aura: until the totem is active, all other totems are protected by an invisible aura that block survivor movement nearby.
---
You bet, but toxic shit sucks on both sides.
---
I was going to say either you're a fool or a troll, i guess i should've known.
---
I turned off the crossplay but it still tells me that i disconnected from the host, what is going on
---
They don't try to balance at all levels they focus more around purple ranks since that's closer to the average skill level of players, the issue is that even in green and purple ranks the lower tier killers are still trash
---
Crows and not screaming. Calm Spirit counters Iron Maiden, Infectious Fright, Spies From the Shadows, and aspects of Clown's and Doctor's powers.
---
What is crossplay?
---
Oh nice, thank you, I even read the description but couldn't get it right
---
I only message that if the killer DC's.  I got a hilarious response yesterday, dude legit went wild.
---
Yeah, on the ps4 is the same to.
---
I'm prolly the  kindest spirit you will ever play lol. I come I'm with the plan to dominate  and if things go accordingly I usually let all the survivors  go
---
Perfectly fine killer, but everyone only thinks to camp at 5 gens, and only use the chainsaw in a chase rather than both that and basic attacks. I've ended matches in minutes because I've actually played leatherface right compared to the foreheads that use him for insidious camping 3 minutes in.
---
I’ve seen a couple of comments about the snoot boops, I run as soon as I see the pig haha, they always sneak up on me and freak me out lol. 
---
I do think that last night was probably because those players were potatoes lol but who knows.
---
I think this guy has to buy a new keyboard now, I’d have smashed mine like the angry German kid
---
PC Steam users and PC Windows Store users can play with and against each other now.
---
Crossplay in general is when people from two different platforms can play with and against one another.
---
You probably got adrenaline borrowed decisive or some other boring boi stuff
---
It is. I have it.
---
Garages on haddonfield are bugged where you can't get inside of them, not sure if it's only when the oni is the killer or if it's with everyone but survivors and killer both can't go inside of them because of some invisible barrier
---
Because increasing gen time is flat out "holding M1 longer" whereas with the perk ruin you can cleanse it or just hit the great skillchecks.
---
Y'all sound like a bunch of fucking children. Servers are not a simple implementation, and a ton can go wrong with them that isn't a simple fix. And no, just going back to ptp connection would not be the best answer. The reason we got servers was because people kept whining about the one-sided connections, cheats, and lack of stability, and without servers, they wouldn't be able to monitor all of that effectively. Besides, it hasn't even been one god damn day. Can you really not chill out for one day? These devs are people to, you ungrateful assholes.
---
Not a bad idea! Always hate when I can't choose what to play, so having this would be a nice lil feature for sure. 
---
Unsure if it could feasibly be done but maybe something to ask on a future AMA
---
That's what I run on Nancy too :) Try using her default shirt with the blue jeans and the ponytail, it looks super casual and nice.
---
I wasnt speaking about this game in particular, as ive said, i dont see what he could have done better. He just lost because of the setup. Bad killer, no ruin, big map, 4 swf with all the good perks _who knew how to play well_. Are those 4 winning 100% of their games? Certainly not.  
---
It's not anything in particular that is too OP, certainly not DS anyway, it's everything coming together here. I can just as easily record 10 games as surv that are over with 5gens up in red rank, that are not against nurse/spirit/billy.  
---
Edit: If anything, then it's voice chat that is the problem here. If those survs were not SWF they wouldnt even have close to the same efficiency. But the only way to balance that somewhat, would be to make voicechat built in the game and then adjust everything else for that, so that SWF dont have that big of an advantage anymore.
---
Patch Notes: Added a loud noise during the loading screen
---
What?! In google play? I can't find it.
---
Yea i think that to, but i just want to see what people are getting and is there something that i need to now more
---
Just look in the bottom right corner of the video, his perks are all right there
---
No. It won’t. If they fixed the moonwalking exploit they will fix this. It wasn’t intended at all and it has no counterplay.
---
Tapp players get it automatically for playing one of the rarest survivors whom I main. Besides that if you meme with me I will gladly give you mercy.
---
&gt;heck my friends didn’t even know while they were playing against him before they changed him
---
This is part of why they changed old Freddy, because some new players didn't know that he could see them while they were in the dreamworld and outside of Freddy's terror radius. It's not Freddy's fault new players either didn't want to read killer power descriptions or just didn't care to, and by that logic any killer could have their power changed on that merit (that new players don't know how a killer's power works).
---
I'd take Resilience and Spine Chill :)
---
I was letting go A lot of survivors 
---
But now i think 
---
MERCY IS FOR WEAK 
---
But if someone disconnects and last survivor wont wiggle im letting them go 
---
And one Time daddy Myers spared me when i was playing as Kate
---
I think he loves me
---
Sorry for the late response but thanks everyone for your input!
---
If you set it to friends only, then they not only have to navigate to your profile but they then have to send you a friend request with the attached message they wanted to say to you on that. So you end up getting a friend request covered in salt
---
The game couldn't find its place on the market but it's quite fun and way more intense/faster-paced than DBD. Alas, its balance was not up to scratch.
---
Beta seems to work fine though?
---
Good job buddy
---
You either use VPN and download the game from Play Store or download it from Taptap.
---
The good part is that the game doesn't need a VPN running in order to play the game.
---
People are allowed to be angry when the service goes down for something they paid for. No one's threatening lives here bro lol
---
Seems like a fair trade to me. I haven’t encountered a lot of Legion players.
---
If you made the match fun, no bullying, butt dancing, etc, I give hatch. But if you made the game a pain in the everlasting xss, or rushed them gens, going to get the hook.
---
Thank you for saying what I have been thinking since this started. Just go play or do something else for a little while.
---
I'm not ungrateful! I'm ungratifying!
---
Tend to stick around green. Once you get in to top end of purple and then red rank it becomes unfun to play due to attitudes and the obession to pip over fun.
---
No statement thats just the current state of the game, if literally everybody is unable to play its fair enough to assume servers are down
---
https://discord.gg/WvrdK8K
---
Join the edgy teen gang
---
Well yeah, that's on a whole different version of the game. It has it's own servers.
---
1. Nurse
---
2. Spirit
---
3. Ghostface
---
Spine Chill doesnt change anything
---
Yes, at least to a certain range. But I feel like the range for players is much closer in dbd than in other games, because most of the people I play with are "close", at least when speaking about Europe.
---
It does.
---
Pig is definitely scary the first few times you come up against one! Even when I’d resolved to start booping, I still jumped and panicked initially. If you point even in the moment they’re hitting you, the emote will still go off before the game puts you on the ground (which usually looks pretty funny to top it all off). 
---
A good snoot boop is a truly magical moment, though, and well worth the effort.
---
God I hate that glitch.
---
Am i gonna get a virus from Taptap
---
If service didn't go down all the time on games, you'd be right. But maintenance on things such as servers is extremely common, and usually goes on for hours. I have several games that have regularly scheduled maintenance for up to 10 hours that never have people as mad as this community. It's honestly irritating to see, as these devs have done a great job on this game.
---
LOL this is so fucking true.
---
d a r n
---
Nah on PS4 you can make it where only your friends can interact with you, but then people just send you a friend request with the message they wanted to say on that since you can add a message to the request. That's what I did after awhile since I got tired of the salt
---
the real question is what is that match making
---
Do they? Seems like they disabled the temporary fix. Something was wrong with crossplay matchmaking, now nothing is working at all.
---
uWu
---
Decided to go for the challenge where you need to interrupt a survivor and got it on my 1st attempt.
---
I'd love this because it would help against assholes who dc during killer adept attempts. To this day I am still annoyed at losing my adept Doc by a few hundred emblem score because of the Jane in that match disconnecting in the middle of the match.
---
I hope this is a joke
---
I could show you another video from a couple weeks ago from the same person where he tunnels one person to win against a high rank swf. Survivors in general are overtuned at high ranks, that's just how the game is unless they find a way to tier balance with skill effectively at all levels.
---
Yes it does. As long as you're within her 24m terror radius you'll hear the heartbeat, not the phasing sound.
---
I never knew that Tapp was one of the rarest survivors but after reading that I think I can only remember seeing one once or twice.
---
\*Insert Disturbed ward Penn asylum Open field totem spawn with nothing around it\*
---
We are we're doing this
---
I mean... it's kind of a buff in a sense that everyone can use it now.
---
DS is
---
The problem is the main feature of this game is based on PVP only, without servers no one can play the game. Their content store works fine. Why not spend extra time to give us an option between p2p or dedicated servers. If we could not connect to their content store then I would agree with you.
---
Servers are down ATM.
---
spine chill best perk.
---
Yes.  I meant if you're the last survivor.
---
Super bad communication as always with this company. Servers have literally been down for over 8 hours and we didn´t hear anything from the devs the first 3-4 hours and now we don´t even got an ETA on when this will be fixed. We paid for the game and pay for DLCs and shouldn´t have to deal with this.
---
Same lol
---
3 seconds adds up well on the right killers, and even ruin only takes an average of 10 extra seconds for good survs to complete a gen
---
Haha for sure, I may have to give that a try sometime just because it seems fun. But yeah pig is so sneaky and creepy lol. I’m probably either going to buy the saw chapter or the mike Meyers, haven’t decided which yet though.
---
No mither, self care. this is an easy choice
---
Probably the same type of guy that dc when they missed their get out of jail free card that DS was. Some people depended so much on it :/
---
Yeah, someone brought this up.  You should always wiggle unless you're the last survivor.
---
Oh god Ive played survivor so long I can't even read that anymore..... Oh no wait its just my mild color blindness.
---
As a killer I will give the hatch to survivors one of two ways. If someone DCs, I’ll usually give the last person the hatch because they got screwed on teammates leaving. Or second, if I steam roll a team and I have the last person down I’ll let them decide by wiggling or not. If they wiggle I will hook them. If they don’t wiggle then ill carry them to hatch or take them to a door.
---
Good thing i maxed the grind and capped the dumb dark sense challenge last night at like 2am
---
Maps would  red to be WAY bigger than that to be honest
---
How is Ghostface better Hag, Freddy, Huntress, or Billy, each who have either way better chase ability, or stronger map pressure
---
“Only necessary to fight tunneling” Then, pray tell, why do I get DS’d by a survivor I chase after I hook someone else? That seems like the opposite of tunneling to me.
---
Good. Keys are broken.
---
Maybe this is done on purpose to make sure no one could grind enough that way people might spend extra money to unlock the rest of the levels.
---
So you are saying you don't need meta perks as long as you're friends are running them.
---
Oc killer is going to be punished more for running shitty perks, it's a 1v4. You also said "pipping" and not "surviving" which concerns me
---
You can't argue with the fact that killers have a much wider selection of good perks then survivor
---
Where are these people unable to make someone like the trapper work at Rank 1? It can be difficult sometimes but my winrate on the trapper at rank 1 is well above 50% and any of the Trapper mains I watch seem to be doing fine too.
---
People who stalk as Ghost Face know how to play as Ghost Face the right way and not need an unoriginal aura reading antiheal build to win.
---
I run discordance, it's just better surveillance tbh
---
Which is why NOED isn't really a crutch, optimal survivors start opening the gates before your second (or third if you got lucky with a hook proxy) chase ends, while they still have plenty of pallets and the infinite(s) or pseudo-infinite(s) are still intact.
---
Besides when the survivor is running Adrenaline, you're never going to catch them if you give them the post-hit speed boost on top of that before the gates are open (assuming they use their massive double speed boost to create distance), so without NOED you're basically left bouncing between gates hoping to get lucky.
---
You do realize the implications of making a game of hide and seek where a setting makes it easier to see certain game elements will RUIN the game for everyone, and not just you?
---
Edit: downvoted, but no-one can provide a good science based counter argument lmfao.
---
Well they could add bigger maps for this gamemode alone
---
Maybe even entirely different killers especially for this. I didn't think about this enough, so I don't have an option for everything but I would really like a new gm for dbd
---
Oh for sure, I wiggle like I’m listening to Jason Derulo no matter what usually lol.
---
When are you going to fall from multiple heights in a row if you aren't running an infinite?
---
Doesn't help as much as it should, Windows changes everything, not just the problematic colors, and it kind of makes it painfully washed out.
---
The mask is awesome
---
Well it was 3 seconds, then they said oh we need enduring to work against it so made it 5 seconds, then stopped enduring working against it anyway.
---
Everytime I see a killer who never leaves the hook area and tunnels the first person caught all game I just think to myself “yup, this is why BT and DS are so strong”
---
The lack of communication is bad, yes, but there's no reason to throw a fit. I payed for Starcraft 2 and all it's expansions, should I go to the forums every time there's unscheduled maintenance or updates and bitch about how bad the devs are? No, even though it happens often. I play a different game because I'm a sensible human being that realizes shit happens, and when the servers are back, I play this game again. It's really that simple.
---
with BL butchered they really dont exist.
---
I get them by being as ballsy as possible. I call it my balls to the wall build for tapp. Stake out, fixated, sprint burst in case it goes wrong and Meddle of Man
---
Was only wondering due to saying you have no problems connecting normally, where most people I know that play have very inconsistent match times, and very frequently takes more than 5 minutes to find a game.
---
I'd rather things fixed first over a new game mode that would break more of the game
---
Good to see a few people on here rewarding DC, I’ve gotten lucky and haven’t had a lot of teammates do this so far.
---
It's the killers fault for grabbing them, you can easily slug them
---
You are really pushing the anti Ds and gen idea, I think you need to stop grabbing people you just hooked off gens.
---
Have the devs said anything about it? I'm just pointing out that they most likely are doing this intentionally. No need to get hostile and all downvote me, I'm not defending this change, but rather pointing out that it most likely won't change in live release
---
Well theres more than one person now might want to do an edit edit
---
Idk how noobish this is of me but the past week I’ve been using Rainbow Map with the add on that allows all survivors to see auras and also best available stamp add on. I find ruin almost instantly every match.
---
Oh no, don't look at my general direction while I have spine chill
---
It's really tasteful irony when they DC on the third hook and the game continues with it anyways and gives you the sacrifice points. At that point all the survivor ended up doing was cancelling their own points out while not affecting the killer at all
---
This is not a unscheduled maintenance this is typical for this game and the lack of communication makes it so much worse.I have been playing Starcraft 2 for years and it has never been this bad.
---
Dont get it on switch its huge waste of money, and they dont update it on it
---
Why? When someone DCs on survivor side sometimes the writing is on the wall for that team... it makes things mega load harder.
---
Should survivors max out survival and boldness category if a killer disconnects?
---
Pick up and move on to the next... also report them.  Part of me hopes when enough DC reports are logged on a player the entity has a spcial place where they all get to play together and never get to finish a game.
---
I highly doubt, but it's always been the norm for me. It used to be somewhat better before dedicated servers (though, sitting with a 3-man, waiting for the fourth was also just as common), and nowadays it seems impossible. 
---
Could also be the playing times? I'm usually on at 12PM through 2, and at night, past midnight, in SP.
---
As a survivor main, I dropped exhaustion perks and having a lot more fun.
---
My now go to builds are healer - we'll make it, bottony, self care and bond with medkit. Killers now slug because of ds, so if I unhook and killer slugs, I can pick up a survivor to full health in what 16-20 seconds? Also I can heal injured people around the map. I also heal my self in seconds. If killer mind games himself I sometimes heal myself mid chase.
---
Second is a dirty gen rusher with streetwise, prove, resilience and iron will and toolbox. You go first on a hook and when hide and do gens only. You fly through gens.
---
Also tenacity, unbreakable, ds and forth perk of your choice is a good build. Saved a match a lot of times.
---
What I found out after dropping balanced landing after the anounced nerf is that I don't need any exhaustion perks to loop the killer. Tried dead heart but it's too unreliable. After stopping abusing balanced I started using new paths to loop killer and I enjoy chases a lot more, they feel a lot more fair. Just feels better not abuse broken chase mechanics.
---
I'd agree that most of the DC's are from people rage quitting, but there are people out there that purposefully do it to try and screw the killer out of points or to claim they didn't win against them. I've had someone dc on me right before their last hook and then they messaged me about it saying that they won because they didn't actually die, some people are just really backwards with their thoughts
---
Hag is pretty bad. No idea why she's on your list. Huntress is meh, depends on who's playing and map. Billy is good. 
---
People recently started playing Ghostface like Pig, they use their ability to sneak up on people but don't wait for the oneshot, instead they go directly at them. Plus he never was bad I think, just that the interaction with looking at him was bit funky at the beginning
---
Although I agree with you on a lot of points, regularly scheduled is a lot different then just flat out taking a dump.
---
stealth killers have risen in the meta. this is why alot of survivors run spine chill now, to counter the rise of stealth killers
---
Depends, to be fair. I've had pretty good luck at rank 11/12 lately, with queues taking anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes at worst, with improvements on weekends and peak hours. 
---
At rank 15 and higher, though, you'll probably find killer queue times to vary a LOT. I've sat for an hour some days, only for it to be just a few minutes the next. I'd say to give it a shot, though. See it for yourself.
---
Ig you can argue that DS is bull, but please don't tell me you think Q&amp;Q is bullshit.
---
Also don't say head on is bullshit just bc a team of 4 can use it and be annoying. I would hope a team of 4 running a perk and changing there playstyles around it would be strong. If you are getting locker stunned mid chase, stop walking in front of lockers. And understand that if one or more people are doing that, that's one or more people not doing gens
---
Skill check = Vibe check
---
And that FAKE ASS ACCENT he pulls out of his ass every two minutes?! Right?! Are you an English Paperboy announcing Poe's latest works or not? Pick a lane, dude.
---
This guy conspiracies
---
I like how it’s always baby Dwight
---
I was playing Spirit the other day and a surv t-bagged me after immediately dropping and stunning me with shack pallet. She didn’t make it out of that game alive lol.
---
A problem with having too high of DC rewards is it promotes win trading to farm rank/ points. I honestly don't know the solution beyond just guaranteed black pips for everyone in the game when a DC occurs, but 3 hooks + a kill just seems a little much.
---
How does it counter Iron Maiden? I’m nit familiar with the perk
---
This is honestly amazing
---
(But why is it flaired as a shitpost)
---
The fact that a survivor can lead the killer into the basement and unhook right in his face (assuming the killer wasn't camping) and still make use of both anti-camping perks makes me sigh.
---
Like sheesh maybe the survivors fucked up and should stay hooked for it?
---
I can agree that some people don't recognize very obvious jokes, but with how vocal people are about their opinions and how much more common it's becoming for people to have support for really unpopular opinions, you can't ever really tell unless the person tells you that it's a joke or sarcasm since there's no tone of voice in text
---
A killer in the power role? It seems like they’re overperforming.
---
Or even swf when you are just playing with you're friends? Why do people just assume every high rank swf is some team of demi gods that can't be stopped, I play with my team of friends who are not that great. But they are decent
---
IIRC, Iron Maiden makes you scream when you get out of lockers
---
They wouldnt do that much work on the game and itd take super long
---
The whole idea of the details accompanying the exhaustion mechanic is that they are supposed to compliment the actual sprint and exhaustion itself, not supposed to be entirely separate perks packaged into one perk slot. That's the logic.  
---
The not making sound, the not being staggered, are supposed to compliment the sprint away. It's incredibly illogical to not have all those events tied to the Exhaustion timer, as it was clearly intended to be that way and to be similar to the other Exhaustion perks.  
---
BL was overpowered and basically a must-run perk because it essentially removed the stagger mechanic. I don't think they ever intended to let you completely dodge the fall mechanics at any given time you wanted.
---
Ah by "switch to pc" i thought you hadnt played on pc for a while... Thought you would have had your rank reset back to 20. Was just saying, if this is the case, grinding bps at 20 is very easy if you wanted to switch considering the above
---
Nah there's no way this perk becomes anything other than a meme build thing. Once you know they have it you just break every pallet that gets thrown. Which I do most of the time anyway, especially when I'm using spirit fury.
---
But the killer still sees your aura, right?
---
Wowie, how can someone not reply to a picture of a severed head, smh
---
That is awesome
---
Name these perks and I can name so many killer perks that are on the same power lvl or stronger
---
I'm not colorblind and I can't see blood because dark red on dark green in this game is like light yellow on white if you don't look closely.
---
I agree with both perks. Spine chill is so great after the undetectable buff for stealth killers (while still being nice against everyone else). Also I have had the small action speed increase save me at doors before so that's another nice quality. Bond I feel is super generous with the range at tier 3. It's great seeing if someone is going for a save, or if they're being chased and I can potentially intervene. Not to mention you can find teammates for heals so easily.
---
So the ds user gets punished for the shit teammates?
---
Again windows aren’t safe and your hit box will linger even after vaulting
---
But you can see them carrying keys in the menu and in game right? Just kill the person with the key.
---
I had a survivor disconnect. We got from five to two gens... hatch popped while we were being chased by leather face... popped hatch and 2 of 3 escaped leaving 1 behind... that 1 was not happy but we would have died.
---
Without the key which took the place of something else we would have died... we sacrificed something and took a risk to bring the key in. It's not like the hatch is always visible 👍
---
I stand by my opinion, just cause it causes exhuastion, doesn't mean its an exhuastion perk.
---
If it was an exhaustion perk it would at minimum be blocked by being exhausted already or be activatable in some way on demand.
---
free to play
---
BHVR are incompetent.
---
It worked for a while, but stopped a few hours back.
---
Mechanics that end games prematurely make it less stale?
---
Yeah I know but I do feel that dcs would happen less if they knew that the killer wasn't losing out and that they were only screwing themselves/their team over. I'd be fine with the survivors getting something, I just suggested this because I want to discourage those that wanted to punish or get back at a killer not so much dcers in general.
---
I'd probably like to see a lot of changes or adjustments.
---
1: No timer, DS doesn't have a duration after which it expires.
---
2: Deactivates if you enter a locker; forcing them to pick you up instead of slug you removes too much Killer agency.
---
3: Deactivates if you start repairing a generator; the Killer has to be able to defend their objectives, and the survivor chooses to take that risk instead of healing up. (Also clearly you're not getting tunneled if you're able to repair).
---
4: Can be activated if you get grabbed off **totems**, **gate switches**, and **vault points**.
---
5: Deactivates after someone else gets hooked.
---
6: Deactivates... During the EGC (after a gate is actually opened or the hatch has been closed?) timer, or once you're the last survivor in the trial? Preventing 100% free escapes through an open gate, basically.
---
7: **Activates after every unhook?**
---
8: While DS is active, you choose whether you bleed out (probably needs an exception, like if you have No Mither or an unused Unbreakable, you should keep bleeding out regardless to prevent infinite slug fiestas or infinite pickup fiestas).
---
Like... Zoinks, entity, you actually made me use 5% of my power to defeat you and free the survivors, not bad
---
Sad!
---
That must be it. They spent years working on it just to switch it off to mess with you guys. Epic troll lel
---
Any exhaustion perks, Dstrike, BT, adrenaline, iron will. The only killer perk on that level is pop
---
Yes. Pathetic at this point.
---
Thats AWESOME! I dont recall ever seeing a female myers mask before! How?! Its not a mask, is it?
---
I'd pay a fortune to have this as a torso cosmetic
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but I have never in all my 4000 hours of this game ever seen Abattoir without either a hill or a combine. So I'm inclined to believe that is impossible.
---
EDIT: If not impossible, EXTREMELY unlikely.
---
Yeah, when most games do server maintenance, the entire game goes down for a time. It's pretty common. This is the first time I've seen such a whiny response. Also, it would break so much coding to make p2p optional, and allow people to use cheats again as they wouldn't be monitored by the servers, allowing file tamperment.
---
Adrenaline has nothing to prevent it's proc if the gens get done. If you get to EGC, you will have used all your perks with the Killer not being able to do anything about it.
---
NoED can be cleansed. Even if EGC happens, Survivors could have killed every totem on the map.
---
It is not NoED or the killers fault the potato Survivors got tunnel vision on the gens and left totems up.
---
The proper response to this action if you anticipate it is to crawl away from the hatch. They will angrily pick you back up and set you down to get their satisfaction. Continue to crawl away, become the real troll.
---
If they're a "rare" survivor that I don't see much. Quinten, Jeff, Tapp, Jane, and sometimes Adam and Jeff.
---
Seems like there’s a misunderstanding. As a survivor, I can loop the killer for a good minute without any exhaustion perks. I have managed to do five gen chases against a huntress, a hag, ghost face and I’m rank 1; the killers are around my ranks as well. At this point in time, as a survivor, I can run anything I want as long as I have a pretty decent team. A team that does gen and hook saves at partially optimal rate is good enough. I’m currently running detectives, head on, inner strength, balanced. Okay, these are somewhat meta as well. But look, detectives is clearly not meta, it’s good for totem hunting but otherwise nah; inner strength is not meta, it just works with me cuz I do totems frequently; head on is just to work with inner strength but it barely ever come in handy. And balanced landing which currently I think is the best perk but it’s getting nerfed. People been talking about DS, what the hell is that? I haven’t used DS since it got nerfed years ago. I see no point in unbreakable, it really happens to me. I see no point in adrenaline, procing once per game is a complete waste. But did you notice something? Other survivors can use them and do well. This is what I mean by as a survivor you have freedom of choice. You can go meta or go relaxed. Your team can buffer your performance.  
---
On the other hand, depending on the killer I’m using, my perk choice is vastly limited. So you are wrong in saying that killers have a larger pool of selection because at rank 2, I have all the perks unlocked for all of my characters but so what, i got to equip BBQ at all times. Ruin at all times. The two other perks are for fun but still needs to be meta. I can’t possibly run random perks and expect it work. My most non meta perks are with my spirit - bbq, make your choice, devour hope, nurses calling. As you can see, still pretty hardcore but that’s the most leeway I can give to ensure my 4K. 
---
When I play ghost face, I use I’m all ears, bbq, ruin, pop. 
---
When I play plague I use thana, bbq ruin pop. 
---
When I play huntress, I use Iron Maiden, bbq, ruin, pop. 
---
POINT being I use the ruin and pop to give myself more chase time. And you can tell that even if survivor is limited to DS and unbreakable/borrowed time every game, I’ve only got 1 free slot to do what I want. 
---
Whose is worse off? 
---
Killer. Therefore. Do something to the gameplay. Devs.
---
Lol, if the survivors would wait the whole two minutes for it to run out, it would literally be the best perk in the game.
---
Not gonna happen, they'll just come closer and do other gens.
---
Your a dick.
---
Nowhere near as much as DBD. Consistent problems even after what, 3 ½ years? Pathetic.
---
Except killers are mechanically different than each other because of their abilities and stats and actually require balancing to them as a character, while survivors have almost the exact same everything and is more about just picking a skin than anything else. If you really cared that much about what survivor is best then you could argue about how loud they are with their voices and how hard they are to see on different maps. This post isn't talking about killers as the playerbase it's talking about killers as in the actual characters in game. The issue you're talking about is skill based and you can't balance a game around individual skill levels, you balance around in game mechanics and how people utiliize them
---
Real pro players do this for the “Obsession Dead” event
---
You'd think that more people would play Tapp because he's a police officer/detective.
---
i've worked in enough environments that relied on a very high uptime to know that there is a protocol you follow, and no business would allow a complete outage of services for five fucking hours without bringing in the best resources you have.
---
i haven't been sitting here camping this thread, i've been playing other games and checking in. but if i were to read for the entire five hours, i'd need another book soon.
---
No 110% speed killer is ever going to be the top tier unless their ability lets them not have to walk around everywhere, ie Nurse and Spirit. Big maps destroy Hag and Huntress simply because of how much time they waste walking around to find people/ setup, not to mention how easy it is to loop them if it comes to that. There's other reasons too, like Hag getting hard countered by flashlights and Huntress only having anti-loop on short loops, but being slow really does hurt them.
---
Ghostface is strong mostly because of the rise of the anti-healing build in popularity. Being able to injure people for free with stealth, keep them injured with Sloppy and Thana, and use Nurse's to then down people for free is a pretty hard playstyle to counter. No terror radius whenever you want is super strong, especially when there's no downside like being slow (Pig) or not being able to attack straight away (Wraith).
---
Billy you could still make a case is stronger than/ as strong as Ghostface, mostly because Billy's playstyle is easier to pull off. Ghostface relies on really heavy juggling and making the wrong decision can be super costly. Billy on the other hand is only ever a chainsaw and 10 seconds away from a target switch, plus he has much more reliable insta-downs. What makes Billy potentially weaker is that no matter what, he still has to chase a little bit and can be looped relatively easily. If you play Ghostface right, you shouldn't have to chase at all until it gets down to the last two people. You hit them and move on, wasting no time running in circles around pallets and now they have to choose between healing for \~50 seconds or staying injured vs a killer that can just appear around the corner with no warning. Personally, I think this makes Ghostface's peak stronger but slightly more inconsistent.

Survivor: Mia Clancy
---
Mia Clancy was a security officer on board the Hope Space Transport Center until around the year 2053. A strange robot bent on murder crashed directly into the station,as Mia attempted to save everyone the thing kept in killing until Mia Was inevitably the last one face to face with the robot.

---
DbD: *goes down*
---
Me: ...Fuck me, right?
---
But it still hasn't even been that long. If this went on for longer than a day, you'd be valid in your complaints. The devs wouldn't take down the servers if it was a small problem, as they do like their community a bit, so it must've been something urgent and game breaking. Such as the servers being busted which would break the entire game.
---
You'd be suprised. Some people actually die to this shit.
---
as if the entity could control 682, "god" himself even said he aint about to fuck with that lizard fam
---
Adrenaline is not an exhaustion perk. You can use sprint burst with it, and no matter what, adrenaline will trigger. No other exhaustion perk can be used with sprint burst, except maybe head on, if you are super careful. Adrenaline is a one time use perk that causes exhaustion as an added side effect, however it isn't affected by exhaustion like other perks are. Adrenaline can be in any build with no consequences, while using 2 exhaustion perks can hurt you, unless you are using balanced landing with dead hard or head on, and it can still hurt, it's a trade off, you can't use both, you can use one or the other.
---
On one hand, I see where you're coming from. On the other, surely coming in to fix catastrophic problems (like this) is in their job description, and their pay is adjusted accordingly. If it isn't, they should look for a better job.
---
That seems way too large a radius, I mean it's within the outer limits of the TR, but I find people repairing generators within the TR all the time and do it myself, getting free MoM stacks just because the killer is chasing me while an injured (Iron Will or not) survivor is on the generator nearby doesn't sound like I'm taking a hit for them.
---
I'm not complaining. I'm saying scheduled maintenance and knowing there will be down time is different then the servers just shitting the bed. Either way they will get fixed and people can chill, but it's just being prepared vs having no clue.
---
If I pay for a service regardless of price I expect after 3 ½ years there would be minimal problems. Not BHVR, consistent problems all the time.
---
Survivors running balanced landing, borrowed time, adrenaline, decisive strike, and the haddonfield offering: 😳
---
The power could use a buff but other than that its incredibly good
---
You do realize that the game elements in question (blood and scratchmarks) cannot be made easier to see for the non-colorblind, correct? They are already the equivalent of neon-lit flashing billboards.
---
...Unless you're colorblind in the red spectrum.
---
It hasn't even been a day. I don't understand how this is even bad! They need to fix something, so they're fixing it! If giving the devs a day to fix the servers that now hold the entire game together is "so bad" you need to reevaluate how much this game is involved in your life.
---
How do I look at this correctly?
---
Mine goes like 
---
Me: finally a day off work on the weekend so I can play dbd with my brother 
---
Dbd: servers down for entire day
---
at first i thought u meant the thing from the stars in darkest dungeon
---
Why would they? There is no time pressure on the survivors. The killer won't come to the blocked gens because  why would he, the survivors won't leave until they can work on them. That's my experience with this perk on red ranks.
---
The ability to run infinites?
---
Oh, okay. Yeah, some kind of notice would be nice, devs dropped the ball there, but the community is blowing it way out of proportion.
---
Interesting, I’ve never considered playing him like that. Definitely would be better than the typical m1 playstyle, though I still think people are underrating Hag/Huntress as of late, but I can see how Ghostface is stronger than I’ve thought. I’d still like to see how he compares to both Billy and Freddy considering they both have strong cross map potential with their abilities, and strong chase, especially against a more coordinated swf that Ghostface might have less consistent results against.
---
I have never encountered a rank 1 squad that would hide the whole two minutes. I know the spawns, I find a survivor within the first 10 to 15 seconds. If the other 3 did nothing while I was chasing that guy, it would be the most chill game ever. No, they'll just do another, unblocked gen while I chase one of them.
---
2 minutes is a crazy long time in this game, remember that one gen takes only 80 seconds solo without toolboxes.
---
Let's hope they do it on the next weekend.
---
It was a temporary fix and it's been reported shortly after that it didn't work anymore. The main post was updated accordingly.

If an OP killer isn’t using hex ruin and Noed with Mori against me in the next hour then I’m

This is why I run kindred, so glad it's getting a buff

If I feel bad I'll farm or give the hatch.

I've stopped getting the error and it says "looking for a match..." Fingers crossed.

Hag isn't bad, she's like a better version of the trapper and can do relatively well on every map, which is not the case with hillbilly.

That reads like an Eminem line

please update if you find a game

You can find keys in chests. You dont have to bring them in.

I only play a Quentin now but I haven’t seen a lot of Tapp players, I started out playing as David but after I bought the Nightmare chapter I figured I may as well use someone i paid for lol.

One day I have free in the week. If a game can’t figure shit out after 3 years then it’s a lame ass game. Not worth the space on my 1tb drive
---
How? Bright Blue or Bright Yellow won't change anything since the Bright Red already stands out so much
---
Looks more like a bug than an exploit since it's not really doing much to help the character, once people figure out how to recreate it and see what helps them by using it then it'd be an exploit

This is so cool. Well thought out! I'd love to think about what different cosmetics the Android could get

Its also allowing me to look for a match on Ps4 (NA) now! Fingers crossed

Yes the ds is useless against high Rang tunnler

And red insta heal is absolutely bad but purple insta heal is good

I just want my stack of BBQ when a survivor dcs as soon as I down them 😭

Remap the skillcheck button to your mouse. Problem solved

now slap that with a ruin

Choose one.

I figured this was here somewhere, didn't have to scroll far!
---
I agree with that i do believe its unfair for killer mains to be forced to play differently dependent on rank.  (Different killers entirely and builds) while still trying to play the best of their ability .knowing that *not everyone* cant just change the killer they play and be adept to continue to rank up. 
---
That really sucks for killer mains i agree. i also agree survivors just *skin swap*  and run same perks at certain ranks then swap them at lower ranks and usally be fine, but not all survivors are swf .at least on console its not always a swf 4 every game in red ranks. And those are the times for killers to learn new builds to help progress. Yes its harder because red rank but the process is still the same right.? Maybe im just a stupid survivor 
---
Surely u play different killers and add-ons r20-14, r14-10, r10-7, r7-4, and r4-1
---
Not trying to cause a mess being a survivor main. But i get where your comming from its alot for killers i get that, but you've all adapted in high ranks quickly it would make sense to be a alot slower in low ranks considering how much you all have to change.
---
Edit: even as a survivor i hate that i said that..
---
*have to change* its unfair
---
Thats without doing the archive, with archive 2 hours a day is easily achievable as long as you aren't playing another game. If you can't even put 2 hours into a game a day, why would they purchase a time based reward pass.

I dunno man, I had a similar problem, I suggest that you should visit the Dead by Daylight customer support website and ask them for help.

No match yet...

They haven’t said anything as of now, so no one knows. We deserve double bp for this🤬

Well gonna keep playing red dead for a while, still waiting

but all my friends are playing?

Useless. I’d rather have a brown one 99% of the time

The killer doesn’t see auras with Iron Maiden. It reveals your location in the same way the Doctor’s scream effect does; but if you have Calm Spirit, your scream doesn’t happen, and your location isn’t shown (though you’re still Exposed for the brief period)
---
That’s one way to make me care about a shirtless Myers cosmetic.
---
ah ok thanks!
---
Depends on if they pissed me off or not. Also sometimes it's random. Like I just decide to let them go after a match for no real reason.

Can someone pls explain to me why these little kids dc just for being downed once, it even annoys me playing as killer

You're reading it with your thought on what he sounded like when typing that, there's no way to tell if he meant that in a rage or if he meant it to be read while laughing. It's like if I said hello there. Am I impersonating obi wan, am I being sultry, am I surprised at something suddenly showing up, am I angry because someone finally showed up, there's no way to tell without me telling you because how I intended to say it won't come across through text the same way that it does vocally, and we type the way we talk so it's intended to have a voice behind it
---
Ptb probably. That’s working fine
---
&gt; BL is only overpowered in situations where you can continuously chain vault drops.
---
Yes it is STRONGEST against these loops, but not ONLY strong in these loops. 
---
On Ormond you can (depending on your positioning and if the super safe pallet has been dropped yet) loop that building over and over. More importantly, though you can drop from the middle and get to virtually any other loop on the entire map because of how dense that map is.
---
On Ironworks you don't have a vault drop but you have one of the strongest window loops in the game + distance. That's not even counting the pallets or other loops AROUND the Ironworks that you can use. You can also reach that window from any drop point at the Ironworks.
---
I agree that Disturbed Ward would suck with or without BL, but it sucks WAY MORE with BL. There is one vault into drop on that map that might spawn (upstairs) and one vault drop that will ALWAYS spawn (the atrium downstairs), but it doesn't need that to be powerful. The distance that BL gives you at the drops allows you to run through the dead zone outside and get back into the house.
---
The combine is a unique case in which the stagger does matter quite a bit. If you vault the drop window (opposite the "slide" window) and stand atop the platform then you can't be hit. This forces the killer to vault that same window allowing the survivor to drop off and loop back up to the same spot before the killer can catch them, effectively creating an infinite until the window was blocked (in which case you could just then use the second vault).
---
NOTE: I've only seen this a few times, but I don't think many people know you can do that.
---
The point I'm trying to illustrate is that the strength from Balanced Landing comes from the distance it gives at structures. The nerf doesn't change that at all. If you still chase someone with BL at these structures, you're gonna lose your gens and you're gonna lose the game.
---
Dbd has it's fair share of problems but a lot of games have server issues from time to time.
---
Yes i do think that way snd my opinion wont change even if u downvote bomb me what u will.
---
Not at all.
---
With pop, you have to pick up the Survivor, walk to a hook, walk back to the gen, and kick it.
---
With Surge, you just down the Survivor, pick him up, hook him and leave. The amount of time you free up with how many steps you no longer have to take is where the power of the perk lies, especially since you don't have to stay at a close hook to make it back to pop.
---
If the Survivors 3-gen themselves, you can move them to a central hook while the gen you Surged is regressing all the way.
---
Spine chill and empathy
---
Riiiiiight, OK.
---
I dont think so... I managed to get to the screen of searching a lobby, but thats kinda where it seems to stay, I guess in a few Hours that this problem will be done... I hope
---
I think the original characters are so well written and interesting, especially just because they're something new. They're also more multidimensional

Your luck has to be high to find a key that can open the dark lock.

Picking up keys unless you're in a team or happen to be paying attention you're not picking that key up

I play killer a ton, and i think DS is stupid, it's not OP at all, it's just a joke. If someone rushes me off a hook, i know they have DS, so I'll just slug them, and if they get into a locker and try and make me grab them, just so they get their stupid perk, i will just stand in front of the locker till it runs out. And if they try to jump out and bait it before that, I'll just down and slug them. I haven't been hit by DS once since it got reworked, but it's still an annoyance when survivors think they are immortal for one minute afterwards. I try to play respectfully and never tunnel, so i don't have a problem with it unless they try to force it on me, then they are just asking to die.
---
And 2 weeks of bloodhunt
---
I was actually playing the tutorials instead
---
Got bored while waiting for the servers to be up, so i did some pixel art of Ghostface that i had planned for a while. I was meaning to try him this morning and learn how to play him since im mostly a survivor main but yall know the servers are screwed up right now :(
---
a charm that selected streamers get
---
It has the worst repair speed out of all the toolboxes. It will be a very weak toolbox until either the repair speed gets buffed or sabotaging gets changed.
---
Can’t argue with that to be fair
---
Spinechill=best perk in the game
---
Would love an option to turn off the cinematic in the settings
---
If they were all on the same gen, Kindred wouldn't do anything.
---
You say this but Surge is rarely seen because that situation rarely happens and if you're at 3 gen you either won or lost. 
---
Either way, 25% is better than 8 s, even if that 8 spreads out. And you won't always 3 gen so now you're just surging one Gen instead of popping it.
---
Lately, whenever I play killer I wait 20+ minutes only to be matched up with a team of survivors 10 or more ranks above me. (My last three matches have been me, 17, vs. a group of 6s and 7s.) So of course I get curbstomped, the match is over in like five minutes, and I de-pip but I still get matched with the same ranks. And in most cases, the survivors teabag me and insult me in the post-game chat, all because I had the audacity of trying to learn the game.
---
Meanwhile, when I play as Survivor, I spend ten minutes in a group without a killer until I quit and re-join. Go figure.
---
That’s really good man

UPDATE IM IN
---
Just popped into a game, might be fixed.
---
Nvidia freestyle, the Windows colorblind filter, and all that are better than nothing and you can use them until the devs add colorblind filters.
---
For about 2ish months now I've had about a 10 15 minute wait but I play on xbox so not sure if there's a reason behind it or not
---
can't tell if sarcasm or not, but as killer you're always chasing someone and you can't afford to half ass your gameplay. when you're a survivor all you have to do is sit on a gen and press spacebar occasionally.
---
Also run whatever gen regress perk you like. Ruin and Corrupt or Pop, surge.
---
Just got a game guys!!!!
---
When is mobile releasing
---
I think as more children have parents spoil them with shit they don’t understand this concept as much. You pay for a product, you’re going to want to use it. That product shouldn’t have problems so frequently after 3.5 years
---
just got a match on xbox!
---
Yeah still waiting. That's been 20 mins. So the error is gone but still not getting a game
---
You can still play other things man! Enjoy as much as you can today :)
---
It's a lot slower overall, even with multiple people doing it. There was a post a while back doing the math on it that I wish I could link to, but the long and short of it is it's just not worth it
---
None of the toolboxes are weak, especially with add ons. I wouldn't change it except as a part of a gen speed/ objective rework.
---
Just got into a match, I think they fixed it.

oh you know the typical dedicated servers takin a long poop break in america

How could they change sabotaging though? Just wondering

shut up exe
---
I mean it’s not like there was definite telltale for aura reading before Legion was released and unless you owned Freddy i’m pretty sure you weren’t able to read the power
---
I just got into a match as a killer
---
Thanks man! I have trouble seeing red and this really helped me out.
---
They heard my pleas and i found a lobby
---
A single chase can easily be a minute. 
---
As a killer "rotate back to check if gen is touched to pop" is not a high priority unless its down to 3 gens
---
just got into a match
---
No mercy to be had from the king of hooks.
---
hex ruin
---
I tried that and it didn’t work
---
I do the same! They always are a bitch to me.
---
Lol, don’t be naive. Do you not know this community? Even tho you didn’t. You might as well have said it with the “He’s OP” I’m doing so well on my 1st try I’m scared to go against him” that’s all it takes to get brain dead ppl started with “Please nerf” movement.
---
me too thanks
---
Using Bond when you are suffering from Blindness
---
My girlfriend (Xbox) just got into a game, looks like servers are back up.
---
EDIT: Looks like it was a fluke. After playing one game she can't find a new one.
---
So just playing the ruin is better?
---
oof thank god, I thought people got bored from the game and stoped playing it (which is my favorite game of all times)
---
Nah, but they feel guilty
---
Still looking for match on PS4....
---
I see, I agree with you entirely.
---
I rarely get hit with it either but it’s still stupid how if they bump into you they can jump into a locker and be invulnerable to avoid the slug. Also endgame DS has literally no counterplay. Spirit had to be nerfed because “nO cOuNtErPlaY” but Endgame DS is apparently perfectly fine.
---
I say this as a survivor who has been saved by endgame DS plenty of times. The killer literally can’t do shit other than pray you miss it.
---
Yeah I guess we feel differently on snapped. Snapped to me is driven to murder without a prior desire to kill because a situation or multiple situations caused it. Eric fits that just isn't as maniacal, but he does get kinda odd at parts. 
---
He did complete his mission but Sarah, the kid was still on earth. Add years until Sarah is 23. Sarah gets taken and he is convinced he must kill to save Sarah. Boom. Done.
---
Apparently this year. So, next december.
---
You’ll get one I did
---
The finger fetish thingy is pretty cool. Also you're right, the slowdown is just awful
---
Calm down dude. There were update notes that spirit would lose collision while phasing in the newest changes.

Yea same here just got into one as well on Xbox

Hey what's a pip? I've been hearing about it but I'm not quite sure what it is?

Same.
---
not at all ill be on dbd ready to get beat back into the dirt :D
---
I'm browsing reddit while it is loading.  
---
Which region are you playing on?
---
Which is exactly what people need. Variety
---
Good to hear, hope you can play more than a couple of games
---
At least they're doing something lol. I get the matches where 2 out of three are playing locker hide n go seek at opposite ends of the map while I'm on the hook.
---
Right! Like literally the one day I can really just sit down and play.
---
Xbox UK is working right now!
---
I haven't voted at all but hey, that chip on your shoulder must be heavy.
---
Yeah but like, although the Crow is the Crow, Eric is the crow to me too. It's mainly image and power potential but the fitting could be tough. Imagine a distorted view through birds though that act as cameras to give you map awareness like no other. It's a rough concept with a helluva lot to hammer out but I do enjoy the idea of the concept

You want to buff noed....okay

Reminds me of my tinder profile (and the other 7 datings apps)

Don’t forget Freddy the high tier killer it counters. He still hears pool but can’t tell which one went off.
---
you're trash
---
i love it when i get those messages lol
---
Ah well it’s WideDogHater but I don’t think it must’ve been the same person
---
Yeah you just work the gen, if someone misses you stop for a second but it won't take that long to regain from the regression, even with just one person on the gen but especially with multiple people.
---
If you play him correctly, yes it is
---
Constantly doing it is stupid and not learning to hit great skill checks is a bad decision. If you get a couple skill checks in quick succession though, there is a good chance just staying on the gen will give you an unusually large number of skillchecks which hitting all "goods" can cost you a lot of progress. Tapping can reroll the rng to give you less skill checks, but it might actually cost you more time if you are unlucky. So there is a wrong way and a less wrong way of doing it.
---
How so?
---
They're the little white notches that you earn in order to rank up. You either get a pip, a double pip or a safety pip which is when you get enough to not lose progress but not enough to make any progress either
---
i was just trying to play what i paid for
---
As a killer main, what the fuck
---
the heal 2 people one?
---
Server issues aside, yes, they've always been longer than survivor.
---
I highly recommend going into windows' color filter settings and trying out the 3 colorblind modes.  For me it's the deuteranopia one that helps me, a comment below suggested this and I have a considerably easier time seeing scratch marks now. Geforce Experience also has a colorblind mode but it doesn't really help me, although I suggest trying that out too, as it might help you.
---
Sadly because so many are playing SWF on discord or chat (basically cheating) you will have to fight fire with fire run BBQ, POP, no one escapes death and ruin. Put pressure on one survivor and camp kill them , the 3 will be so hell bent on saving them they will get out of their game now it's 1 vs 3 , within that time you will probably lose hex ruin, whatever it will be easier to pressure 3 against a gen rush, hopefully you will have one hooked when the gates open and then no one escapes will activate. The others will ofcourse try to save but then be susceptible to one hit down , I've won alot of matches way. Then they will talk shit and be salty. Laugh it off if they play dirty then you play dirty.
---
I love that build ngl
---
What the hell thats the worst idea. waiting two minutes to not do gens is a killers wet dream. all the killer has to do is patrol around the corrupt gens and he'll find them easily. And if they aren't near the corrupt gens then why the hell are they waiting? 
---
Corrupt is good because it gives the killer a much easier time applying pressure to multiple survivors early in the game by limiting the number of gens they can work on, NOT because it slows down the game or anything. If they aren't working on gens then thats fucking hilarious because thats slowing gens speeds way more than ruin could ever dream of.
---
I agree
---
Damn really that’s bullshit man
---
Is it edgy if I don't do what you ask me to?
---
really?! the exact opposite for me survivor ques usually take 1-2 min for me i tried pc and refunded the game after looking for ques for 30 min on both sides
---
I genuinely love it! Those are such great ideas!
---
Imagine the jumpscare when you‘re working on a gen and an unmoving robot next to you suddenly comes to life..
---
How have you not seen it? It's pinned to the top.
---
Ill keep that in mind and tell her thank u
---
You're right, her bamboozle speed is fucking OP and her movement speed is broken. Imagine being stupid fast in DBD.
---
I never ran kindred but I'll start to consider it after the buff (even more so because I always solo-queue).
---
What do you mean how? You honestly believe bright blue scratch marks will be equally as visible as red? No offense but TBH, it doesn't matter what you **believe**, the facts already speak for themselves.
---
pretty good job so far
---
That kind of standerdizes the use of BBQ though, what if you're not running it? I all ready don't like how it feels like 50% of my perk slots are pre filled tbh.
---
Guess so man
---
lol thats hilarious. ive been streaming ToS while waiting for DBD to be fixed LOL
---
I usually will just aim for the good portion of the skill check if it is in the 3-8 o clock position, it's better than missing. In the 9-12 position, it's a lot easier to hit the great check with a little bit of practice.
---
Based BHVR
---
Shock value, probably
---
Didnt know the specifics on how the RNG changes but that makes sense.
---
since this "bug" come back regularly i wonder if it's not rather a test they do regarding balance.
---
Personally i play without headset since a lot of time so it doesn't change anything and i brought Sprit to P3 that way.
---
They just reworked her yet somehow perkless I'm still getting multiple 4ks a day
---
Where did you order it from?
---
Did it take her awhile to get in? I’ve been searching for a match for ages.
---
BBQ is the only perk I always use. I enjoy points. And if someone dcs as soon as I down them, I’d like a stack for that is all I’m saying lol.
---
If you don’t like that, don’t use those perks. There’s lots of builds you can do or just pick randomly. It’s not like you have to use them.
---
Anyone get a game on PC?
---
Did you miss the part where the majority of my criticisms about the game were about the staleness of the core gameplay and its mechanics itself?  Or did you just skip that entirely?
---
If I go on now... I be sleepy enough for work... oh ok.... just 1 hour.
---
Ruin. The rest are dependent on which killer you play.
---
Searching killer for 5 minutes still nothing
---
memes aside yeah she's still a strong killer.
---
u/vredditshare
---
nope
---
It's a lovely meme.
---
no, but im reading xbox people getting games. we might get back up soon
---
it's just a campfire simulator on pc still
---
It's supposed to be a set value (8% chance each second, I think) bit as we all know the flaws of rng, it often snowballs into flawed values so a reset by jumping off /could/ help.
---
just bc they are not as bad as before, doesnt mean they dont exist
---
forever stuck searching for a match on pc
---
Just got one game (Xbox, EU)
---
Someone give Suzy a hug. That little panic at the end has me feeling sorry for her.
---
Wait what the fuck are tickets?
---
it still not working for me, its taking really long to find a match in Europe server, at least for me
---
Dude people saying nerf don't make them nerf he is op baseline not extra very op.
---
Survivor mimicry isn't the base power like other threads have suggested.
---
Ps4 EU here no luck yet killer queue
---
🤢🤢
---
And uk sadly
---
What could they do to make it viable do you think?
---
On switch, was receiving error about half an hour ago and just got a game now
---
As a main killer I must say that I always try that everyone has fun. But if you're worse at running than the other 3 I'm gonna chase you the most instinctively because you're an easy prey. But... If they BM in ani minimum way they get tunneling. So give them a lantern or something and you'll be safe from killers like me
---
Yes, but trapper isnt exactly good himself. The reason they both lose out so much is because they have to place their traps, and that takes very long.
---
awesome
---
did my first round again. its up for now
---
Epic
---
Are you on PS4? Been waiting a while now
---
And practice is everything!
---
As a console pleb it's a pain when its only tier 1 ruin and they still don't try and do gens like if the killer gets more than 1 hook and nothing is being done the game is usually lost I can do ruin skillchecks no problem but when I do 3 gens by myself while having prove thyself then the others need to practice more. I dont know why everyone is scared to mess up the skill check so what if the killer finds you better them running around trying to find a totem
---
One question: Why do you go near the corrupt gens when you know there is nothign for the survivors to achive? And if you go there while they are corrupt, what point does the perk have?
---
Yea, kinda handy.
---
Imagine looking for a teachable perk but you don't want to spend your shard on that certain killer/surv.
---
You just use the ticket and grind the levels.(just a theory,but still pretty realistic if you've got a lot of time to spare.)
---
https://youtu.be/M7Nbg_TmVYc
---
Or do what I did here and tease them! She didn't really deserve this. I was just salty about my previous game and I remembered I was also on the sacrifice 13 people challenge after carrying her around for a while. 
---
I'm somewhat sorry Meg.
---
Anyone got into a game on PC yet?
---
The Azur Lane devs are generally some of the best i've ever seen, especially when compared with others like the FGO ones. They actually give a fuck about their game and their community, and it shows. It's honestly disappointing how this kind of attitude towards players is the outlier and not the norm tbh...
---
I have work at 7am so really I shouldn’t be sat staring at this all night but I god damn will

---
Whoops
---
How's PC-US doing? Is it up yet?
---
It's to keep things balanced, or at least try to. If you only had a huge bonus from an add-on but no downside, it'd be considered over powered and it'd have to be re worked.

As much as I wish to play DBD, pretty much the only killers I can do at all are the one shot killers. If I hit someone and they turn a corner in an indoors area (ironic enough the actual indoors maps tend to be fine for scrarchmarks) or jungle gym I just become completely lost as to where they are. Not to mention as a new player i sometimes get stuck dropping survivors since I can't tell where the hooks are. 
---
I understand perhaps why you might want to keep blood and scratch marks the same if they can be hard to see for non colorblind as well, but at least let us change hooks/generators/other UI elements.
---
Not for me.. its just searching for a match forever
---
I don't always land Great Skill Checks but somehow I almost always manage to get these
---
It seriously sucks loading up DBD, skipping the cinematic, pressing a button, then pressing another button, continuously loading, then finally going into the main menu to have another pop-up come up that I have to close, and finally I get to click on a game mode. 
---
I can't think of any other game, that I've played, that has had or still has this many steps to get to the point where you can actually play the game.
---
Exactly!!!!
---
no more error message, but i can't find a game
---
Im talking about you. according to you survivors just sit on corrupt gens so why wouldn't YOU check them.
---
No sadly
---
I've been enjoying pop and brutal strength together with thrilling tremors and nurse's, sometimes I'll use monitor and or bbq on place of brutal/nurse's. Can't be bothered with ruin and I think my gameplay has improved for it.
---
I just got the challenges done with her. Only have her at Lv 19, so i'd need to grind quite a while to get her teachables, and even more to actually get them to show up on the bloodweb of others, so i just said fuck it and simply played with her.
---
Me a hillbilly main what the fuck ? we have a copy cat boys
---
for me too, they didnt fix the PC for US and neither EU
---
I'm not sure how I feel about precision strike, makes dead hard practically impossible to use and has a low activation cost.
---
Other than that this seems well thought out.
---
I think, from the Dev's point of view, the downsides are there to keep certain things in check. There are some add-ons that are just straight up busted or extremely annoying to play against, but I think they wanted to make sure not every add-on was like that

Very good job, well done.
---
But you're still saving time by not moving to the gen or kicking it. Pop may kill gens fast, but if only one Survivor is on that gen that extra time comes in clutch to find and distract another Survivor.
---
I feel like you're not taking Surge's strong points into account because it's not Pop, a perk no one used before they doubled the time you have to use it. You'd be arguing Pop is bad if it was still 30 seconds.
---
Anyone got a game on ps4?  I've just got on.
---
Yeah, I've always found these kind of skillchecks way easier to hit than regular great/hex skillchecks
---
idk he was doing his mori and then they both t-posed and meg was sliding into him
---
There meta consists of some combination of the following:
---
Ruin - Without it, Survivors will often gain too much momentum early on for the Killer to save the match. Generally, you'll lose 2 gens for your first hook. With it, you'll only lose 1.
---
BBQ &amp; Chili - Because people are too stupid to realise Thrilling Tremors is an objectively better version of this perk/2x BP, BABY!
---
Enduring + Spirit Fury - Can't have one without the other. Just walk into every pallet, every chase. Show no skill and rely on the basic-b**ch combo for free hits.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel - Hook a Survivor, kick 25 charges off of a gen. Easy peasy, gives you lots of time.
---
NOED - Because you lack any modicum of skill and want a free kill.
---
(By-the-by, I run; Ruin, PGTW, Surveillance and either Thrilling Tremors on mobile Killers or Haunted Grounds on those with poor mobility).
---
Well, what's the point of the perk when I have to check the gens anyways? It's just a normal game then, and a waste of a perkslot.
---
If there’s only two people, one of you will die even if you body block. At best, they hit you twice, you go down, your friend escapes you die, at worst, they down you, you’re too far away from the gate/ a hook is too close, they hook them, then hook you as well.
---
Lol otz uses Ci and ya Ive watched this guys tier list and he's wrong quite often he took a huge break came back made a tier list and got bashed for it in the comments. Also look at the full tier list you sent dude has fucking deer stalker and lightborn above dying light pywf ci Rancor smh.
---
Oh yeah I found your channel and even subscribed to it already haha.
---
Well, hope to see more content soon if possible, quite a nice vid.
---
...his accent isn’t Irish.
---
It isn't a huge problem, when 1 d/cs, but it makes it way harder to pip. You have to max hooks for all other survivors and max 1 other thing out, to maybe pip 1. The huge issue is when 3 people leave at the start, then the last survivor finds the hatch, but it -1 pips you. The system is pretty botched for killers, at the moment.
---
I just save them until the end of the game lol
---
"If we stop and do totems, we aren't on gens!"

Sounds like tunnel vision to me.

100% needs a rework. Along with Deja Vu.

Put it back on before I cum dude

The devs have said they will never make a quadriped killer

Also how on earth would  half the basic animations work?

the least they can do is give back kill score for someone dc'ing so you don't end up depipping because people disconnect

I get some purples in my game. Usually those are the ones messageing me calling me a tunneler. Even tho they are the easiest target. (Im not saying i drop everything to tunnel) if i haven't found anyone by the time you get unhooked in coming back to the hook and seeing if i see scatch marks/ noises. Which the hurt one never hides.
---
*Mangled Status effect*
---
A brown toolbox gets used in 1 generator if you hit no greats, and the fast as fuck people one. So 80 Charges is one generator
---
Should either grant the bonus uninjured as well, or add a massive chance of getting a skill check.
---
It’s weak because its not worth the risk of staying injured, even if you 99.
---
Deja Vu need buff no rework.
---
Because it would be bad. Lol. It would have the exact same problems as Purge, too many restrictions. So instead of upping how many gens you can kick with one use of it or increasing the regression, they upped the time.
---
Surge needs a similar buff. Surge only works in a certain proximity meaning if I'm drowning a survivor in that proximity chances are I'm right next to the Gen so this time "saved" is minuscule if it means a guaranteed 25%".
---
We'll Make It activating when they have Second Wind.
---
*happy Bubba noises*
---
Nope😐
---
When people have power, expect them to misuse it. It happens everywhere, on any platform. Shrug it off and continue doing your thing
---
I think they all run on different servers. So it makes sense that they would come back online at different times. I'm just glad they figured out whatever it was hopefully
---
Still working? And how long queue?
---
Seriously, it's hard to get mad at people for missing ruin skill checks when I know how bad the fps can be.
---
Ok, they believe i was tunneling but it's not liem i could know which Claudette i had been attacking.
---
I am also conducting two other surveys for other games  
---
if you happen to play those as well, it would be helpful for you to fill them out too.

---
They’re just outdated. Small Game was amazing when there were only 3 killers to choose from. But now there’s a lot of free heals and +1s so most of them are pretty terrible in comparison. Just the nature of the power creep.
---
Not level on a killer. What is the number next to bloodpoints when you have a killer selected?
---
Not another crazy russian!
---
If you want a perk to offset the penalty of being injured, bring actual good ones like Iron Will, Resilience or Dead Hard
---
oh, I was guessing that but didn't know for sure. Thanks.
---
To be fair its probably hard to tell you're bein sandbagged as the killer unless it's super obvious
---
In dbd with no perks effecting efficiency or speed, a charge usually equates to around 1 second of use. 
---
As you have mentioned a heal requires 16 charges which equates to a full brown med-kit. 
---
Perks that make things go faster does not impact charges but rather the speed that you go through charges.
---
For example Sloppy Butcher applies the mangled status effect.
---
This causes 20% slow down on healing
---
This makes healing go at 0.8 charges/second. 
---
So if you are hit with sloppy, you will take 20% longer to heal but you will not need more charges to fully heal I.E You can still get a full heal using a Brown Medkit. 
---
For toolboxes
---
A generator requires 80 charges to be fully complete given that you hit all good skill checks.
---
If you hit a great skill check it will boost progress by 2% granting you a +1.6 charge bonus if you hit the great skill check.
---
A brown toolbox has 80 charges thus can fully complete a gen. They speed up gen progress by 15% at base making you repair a gen in 68 seconds instead of 80.
---
Flashlights have varying levels of charges
---
Yellow Flashlight has 8 charges
---
Green has 8 as well
---
Purple has 12 charges.
---
It takes around 1.10 seconds to blind a killer. This means you could more or less blind a killer 7 times using the base yellow/green flashlight if you hit all them perfectly.
---
For keys charges,
---
A broken key at base has 10 charges. This means with an add-on that allows you to see survivor auras, you could use it for around 10 seconds. 
---
Dull key only has 5 charges meaning its main purpose is for the hatch rather than aura reading
---
Skeleton Key is a mix of both with 30 charges. It has good practical use with having the ability to read auras and being able to open the hatch as long as it has not been depleted. 
---
The add-on blood amber increases charge consumption by 50%. This will half the time you can use each key, effectively making it only useful on a skeleton key or a green key with duration add-ons.
---
For maps,
---
Both green &amp; Rainbow map have 20 charges. 
---
The add-on retardant jelly reduces charge consumption by 24% making the maps last 6.41 seconds longer
---
Oh you meant "4 out of 5," I read that as "4 or 5." That's why I was confused.
---
Currently it is 20
---
Ohhh, those Russians
---
i hate kindred but have to bring it in solo queue lmao.
---
I understand the confusion, I'll edit my original comment to make more sense
---
Spine chill is a lifesaver. Especially against stealth killers
---
I would be doing a dull totem for bloodpoints and they would lock me in until the killer arrives.
---
A lot of survivors say tunneling is being hooked twice in a row. Honestly, that’s bs cause what’s a killer supposed to do, look at the survivor and just walk away? That’s not how you win.
---
Was there only the person on the hook and 1 more person left?
---
he also lost about 6k subs this week on youtube (i wonder why /s)
---
I love doing that to mess with them. My friend was getting chased so I went and tapped it. Killer broke off to come check. Lolololol
---
Lol still looking for match.
---
You’ve never seen a high rank streamer because you unironically watch Tydetyme and listen to his opinions on whats good or bad.
---
Killed all 4 survivors, no tunneling or face camping and I still got that message yesterday “trash killer”
---
I just write back “lol u salty”
---
Oh - this.   
---
This is beautiful
---
Did I say anything like that? lmao no.... I said remove the crutch perks. Looping is good obviously, and so are mindgames. Don't trip
---
I finally got in right as I’m leaving for work. I actually hate everything.
---
This toolbox is only made for the occasional hook breaking build which most survivors don't run ever. Bring down its rarity to green or even yellow and maybe people will want to use it.
---
What was her rank?
---
I have played in SWF at rank 1, granted my teammates were rank 3 and 4 respectively but again, I just meme'd around. There's literally zero point to take this game that seriously to be honest.
---
Fair as can be. It’ll make survivors flame more on those dumb baby rage quitters, which in turn makes those idiots think(if they have a brain) twice about quitting.
---
My friend loves beads and fast addons to zoom but I prefer classic “crap your pants how did she lunge that far” saya + tsuba.
---
I was wondering why sometimes it wouldn't show the pool trigger, thank you
---
Can confirm, PC EU UK killer in less than 1 minute.
---
Few things feel as good as hitting that unnerving DS skillcheck
---
Just like I said, reduce the bonus, remove downside. Reduce rarity if necessary.
---
Downsides should exist only for gamechanging addons like tombstones, oneshot stuff etc.
---
The killer would be able to see him from across the map, what with that gigantic stack of cargo on his back that reaches to the sky.
---
I run thrilling tremors but does it give you a BP bonus?
---
Okay last time. In the MAJORITY of your games when you use corrupt AT RANK 1 do survivors sit on corrupt gens or go and work on others?
---
ASSUMING they make the decision to sit on corrupt gens in the MAJORITY of your games you would always check around corrupt gens after checking the regular ones. If NO ONE is on regular gens then you start a chase near a corrupt one. There is NO WAY you will not find a survivor considering you will have just over a minute to find them. Just listen for breathing or grass moving. Once you find someone, you are starting a chase with ZERO gen progress. Even if by some miracle you don't find someone, in most of your games you will and this is far too big of a risk for survivors to take. They'd rather just do no-ruin gens and loop the killer.
---
If they DON'T sit on corrupt gens in the MAJORITY of your games then SURELY its not a terrible perk.
---
Also it makes more sense to attack the injured person rather than the non injured
---
Hopefully it will be working right when you get done salving. Sorry
---
PC player here, got into a lobby (survivor) and had to wait like 20 seconds.
---
Why do you even get points for that
---
Everyone hears spirit phasing with prayer beads. It’s like the legion add on where everyone hears the terror radius when he’s chasing someone.
---
Especially at the end of the game, or if you need to apply pressure
---
Look up community data sheets dbd.
---
Agreed 100 percent. On console when you 360 a killer it looks like 5fps for the killer. Plus if they are newer or trying out a new killer this is someone thinking that they are better then they are.
---
I've been sitting watching the server status for 10 hours. They're fucked my dude
---
This is precisely my problem with her. Whether you survive or die is a gamble, little skill comes into it on either end.
---
The virgin Object of Obsession vs the Chad Cargo Tower
---
Oh nice, welcome to the Fog
---
In your case, just survivors being bitter, and you said gates were open so it'd be securing the kill in my book.
---
You did the right thing,  and either feed on their salt (very unhealthy to consume that much sodium, be warned) or just ignore them.
---
PC EU UK Survivor here, still can't get into games
---
You don’t need to worry
---
I feel the same way. Made a big cup with my french press, had the controller charged up, and can't connect.
---
The best way for a survivor to improve is to try and get hooked as much as you can.
---
My best advice would be to go on forums and look for other players to play survive with friends with. Most survivors I go against as killer are usually groups, and when I play survivor I prefer to play with others I can communicate with
---
Maybe add a passive that shows the aura of a generator that isn't currently being worked on when you get within 16 meters of it. Give it a cooldown of maybe 40 seconds. That way when you hear a generator but the perk doesn't pop you'll know someone's on it and you're better off finding another gen.
---
Well, that all depends. What do you find you struggle most with as a survivor?
---
not really? I mean the killer loses a hook and it takes more time
---
No lol are you kidding? You’re giving killers all of the points they didn’t earn for FREE instead of the current one time drop of like 1000 or something. Better than nothing and not gratuitous like this is
---
Dude you are obviously biased towards killer... How many games like these you get? I play both sides and when I play killer survivors are like 80% of the time totally boosted monkeys. Stop making a "big deal" out of games that happen maybe like 3% of the time. + In this game Otz played Doc who is pretty bad and he had no ruin... Ofc you will get genrushed. I personally play ruin on EVERY killer bcs is a must at this point. You need to have something to slow the game down. Maybe like spirit, nurse or billy can play without it fo they are skilled enough to be able to down survs quickly. Using your logic I can make a thread with some random game where the killer playing spirit with meta perks brought mori and 4Ked in 4mins. And I am gonna cry and complain how is it not fun at all... BOTH situations are not happening often but are STILL in the game boohoo
---
I've been called a hacker for winning the 50/50 guess and going to the door that the survivor was at after I closed the hatch. 
---
"How did you know I was there? Why didn't you go to the other door?"
---
Yeah, it had nothing to do with luck and the fact I saw scratch marks around the gate... I was clearly hacking the game. Don't get me started on immersed survivors who get salty when I find them after hearing footsteps/breathing/grass rustling. Sorry I play with a headset, salty boy.
---
Easy: You are able to see the repair progress of highlighted generators.
---
Gogogo!
---
how is this not upvoted
---
in that useage trash means 'not nice' for killing them all
---
You should figure out you're playstyle first, do you like to sneak around? Heavily play the objective? Be chased? Heal teammates/protect them? Once you figure that out then you can move on into getting perks that support that playstyle. Getting escapes surprisingly isn't your goal as a survivor it's repairing generators. But playing smart and understanding the maps and a killers strengths and weaknesses will allow you to eventually start escaping more often.
---
Three window vaults is not an infinite its a god loop. You're just mixing up game terms.
---
~~God I sound like a nerd~~
---
I was waiting to see if anybody was interested before I did more skins of the same character :)
---
Ok I laughed
---
it do be such that it is
---
I never use it, but I’m not a fan of the nerf. Although it’s getting a slight buff to compensate, it’s not worth the total stagger reduction it had. It’s just a cheap way of saying “We won’t rework Haddonfield, so we’ll just gut the perk that isn’t the problem”.
---
How did you unhook yourself being the last survivor..?
---
I wouldn't have stood in the door way, instead walking the perimeter somewhat close to the basement trying to find the last person but staying close enough that if they get unhooked you are still able to get back near them to get the down. But that's me, and everyone can play any way they want.  Try out different things and see what works for you.  No matter what happens people are going to send salty stuff if they lose and even sometimes when they escape. Just keep doing you .
---
time to wait in queue until everyone figures it out
---
Can someone explain to me what boosted means in this context? I hear people say it all the time and I have no fucking idea if they’re just saying “this guy is bad” or not.
---
Hell yeah! 😎
---
I agree, but the nerfs were kinda needed. Especially the prayer beads change. (don't agree with changing her vault though)
---
EZ 4 escape
---
ok
---
just got in one, pc est
---
Confirmed. This is the way
---
I too am unaware, that's just what I've seen when other games have similar issues. Usually each system goes up at a different time. I'm also on PS4 tho and used to being last in line for DBD.
---
Unfortunately disconnects are down to the community. Behaviour can only do so much to combat that activity. If pips are lost then again just gotta pick and and move on. Always report and if on console report the player through xbox or ps so you dont come across them again. 👍
---
Kinda reminds me of the group photo after the credits of CoD MW’s campaign lmao
---
&gt; as a survivor, I can run anything I want as long as I have a pretty decent team
---
&gt; I’m currently running detectives, head on, inner strength, balanced
---
You literally run some of the perks that are so close to being meta, but are not and balanced. I run balanced, resilience, DS, and BT most of the time
---
DS and unbreakable are some of the best survivor perks in the game by far, adren is player specific but its also amazing. 
---
Relying on your team when you are not swf is a horrible idea, its just dumb to assume your p3 claud in your lobby is running amazing perks and is gonna do gens and loop amazingly.
---
You dont need BBQ, you need ruin but thats an issue with gens and not perks. Hell you can bring perks that are not ruin if you are playing a top tier.
---
Killer is not limited to 1 slot. you chose to bring pop, and if you are playing anyone on the same lvl or better then billy you dont need ruin to do well in high ranks if you are good. 
---
The point wasnt even that killers can fit more fun perks into there builds, it was that killers just have way more usable perks since the devs where scared to add any decent survivor perks for over a year. while killers got constant top tier perks during that time
---
I'm still rather new to the game and community, what do you mean by "slug"?
---
Ehh, Survivors have much more leniency with Perks to be honest. They can have much more variety and still do decently well, whereas Killer will be greatly handicapped using off-Meta Perks/Situational Perks.
---
If you aren’t at the bare minimum using Ruin/Corrupt, 2-3 Gens are going to pop in your first chase/patrol. Although depending on the Killer you can be okay if you can force a 3-Gen situation
---
Hahahahaah
---
It’s the loud warning
---
I’m in
---
Not yet QQ
---
This is one thing I love to do in Sims 4. I've put in so many different characters on my save file. Legit I got Mario, Final Fantasy, Avengers, Big Brother (don't ask lol.) I'm likely gonna put in the Dbd survivors soon. Its really fun to use a party mod and invite them ALL over for a huge party. Totally crazy shit!
---
This is exactly it. Fix the maps it can be abused on. Now it’s almost worthless. I only chose it over other Exhaustion perks due to the passive effect.
---
Just one more survivor perk made useless.
---
The fact that not every game is exactly the same as this one doesn´t mean there are no issues. The fact that ruin is a "must" on every killer is fucking idiotic. The fact that 3 gens get done in less than 3 minutes without the survivors even having toolboxes is nuts. The fact that Steve and Nancy simply got off the hook and started working on a gen in the middle of the map because they knew they have D-Strike insurance for 60 seconds and Otz cannot pick them up is idiotic. 
---
You can make up some random situation, but you yourself still admit to the simple, biggest bullshit that happens in this game: you need ruin and slowdown perks and you need to play a good killer otherwise you are fucked. Meanwhile survivors don´t even have to change their loadout to do 3 gens in 3 mins and can spec their entire kit for chases and rescues. 
---
I mentioned this in multiple other comments, I don´t expect you to read them anyway. Stop focusing on this game in particular, and recognize issues from the game that happen in every single high rank game because they are there, even if the game doesn´t end up with 0K.
---
Mother: *loads shotgun with religious intent*
---
how about switch?
---
They should put people who dc often into the same lobbys, just like some games do with hackers. Also, make a survivor dcing block all remaining people from pipping up or down and award them something like 8k bloodpoints. Dcs would decrease since no one wants to be in a game where they cant win, and those who are left behind are less punished, whilst still keeping the rank system in tact.
---

Infectious Fright + Knockout Billy.
---
Balanced Landing didn’t need to be nerfed, Haddonfield should have been reworked instead. There are so many things more problematic than BL (like DS) that should have been looked at instead.
---
See, then I get 4 skill checks in a row. I always start by powering through but then at like 90% the gen is like “hahahaha” 
---
Ping
---
And it regresses to 50 because I play with a controller and the delay can cause me to miss skillchecks
---
The law of equivalent exchange
---
They are for me. Xbox one.
---
And the bad turns red too
---
It's part of the game. Dont want a key used? Dont let the gens get to the point where the hatch can be found 🤷‍♂️
---
Survivors have to deal with constant ruin and NOED. We take the hit and make the choice as players to spend ages looking for ruin or work through it. NOED pops we have a choice to take the risk and look for it and save or think about ourselves and leave.
---
The game gives options... if you gotta Franklin your way outta keys (it's easy to lose that stuff) or tunnel until that key bearer is down... then do what you gotta do as killer to ensure the kill. Maybe a survivor will have a perk to save their team... you just don't know till it happens.
---
I already have a mask
---
Just got in as survivor. PC (Central US)
---
Why are you attacking totem hag like this
---
This is really strange to me. Pc users turn off cross-play and it kinda works for some, if not all. ps4 doesnt even have crossplay yet suffers a similar problem, but without the same solution :)
---
the servers were down and went back up 15 mins ago. we just have to wait for people to realise that
---
It’s the opposite for me - I’ve never had a non scummy Wraith unfortunately. Whenever I’m last alive, they play super friendly until I’m doing the gate, right as it hits 75% *without fail* I get grabbed off the door and hooked. I play on PS4, so maybe that makes a difference but damnn I hate Wraiths haha
---
Running into traps is one thing, but I think for the challenge I have to be close enough to grab them out of them traps for it to count.
---
I can tell when my killer has great ping because I can actually hit the greats lol
---
And now you're reported for cheating lol.
---
“If used properly” you mean when he has windstorm.
---
He claimed I was. Had an even luckier play after, went up searching for hachets, and found a Claudette instead lmao
---
Disable cross-play, that fixes it
---
EDIT: Apparently that doesn't work anymore
---
Avoiding and getting away from the killer.
---
Dont want noed? Dont do generators.
---
See how stupid that sounds? That's exactly what you sound like when you say "dont let gens get done".
---
the game is just super unbalanced if you get a strong swf... not sure what else to say. its why i have a hard time playing killer unless i know i want to suffer lol
---
and then the killer dodges the lobby 😑
---
I'm mostly playing on PS4 tho. And I chopped down GF Experience, because it was a bad experience lol
---
Yep just got into a game now after a few mins of waiting as a survivor. PC EU :)
---
Edit: I did turn off crossplay so that might be why.
---
Idk what killers you've come across, but using ruin and thrill as a killer lead to great matches for me if they attempt to cleanse. It's when the survivors commit to ignoring them that it gets hard again.
---
There are connection issues rn, the devs are working on it tho, no games to be played sadly tho
---
Yeah the abuse you get as a killer is insane, honestly just write gg and instant leave.
---
Idk why you’re being downvoted. It’s the truth
---
So yea they were down... then they came back, and now they are gone again or am I misunderstanding something?
---
Yeah, problems seem to be fixed for now at least with crossplay disabled
---
Oh i know, i learned this because it happened to me and i wanted to crawl through my internet cable and gouge the eyes out of the bastard tapping TOTH.
---
East-US I got in very quickly
---
The devs said there are matchmaking issues rn, and on multiple platforms
---
I don’t want to be rude, but more “original” or obscure sound clips would be a nice addition.
---
I can’t stand all of the ‘CoD kid screaming’ and all the loud noises in general. A lot of the ‘meme’ clips in the video are overused from the era of “MLG shrek 360 noscope!!!111” and n00b3 videos.
---
I like that you’re taking the time to make these though. I love Dead By Daylight Content. I would just suggest you try and branch out to find your own “style” as opposed to copy-pasting the same audio clips we’ve heard in hundreds of other videos. What makes these content creators unique is that they all have their own editing/memes/clips that they use, and this just feels like a tribute or someone trying to copy other videos they’ve seen before.
---
People just think it's poor form to go after the survivors with a trap on their head. Like, if you accidentally find them, knock them down but don't throw them on a hook too. By all means, play the game how you want to but don't expect everyone to be okay with it.
---
no, people just havent realised that they're back up.
---
Well if you are doing swf on comms the game is way easier. Killers don’t get to have friends ha ha.
---
I approve
---
GALE NO!
---
The best part of this is that you managed to accidentally make a near perfect Matt Mercer.
---
Yea I do it's from Monto, sorry I've taken this long but yea I do have it
---
Not even a swf if everyone just understands to hop on gen if theyre not in chase and are decent at looping youre gunna have a bad time.
---
Only thing i can think of is that they’re afraid to add colorblind options that make it easier for other people (non colorblind) to see. Similar albeit not the same as PUBG’s blue blood issue they had.
---
Although this is imo not an acceptable excuse for having zero colorblind options at all.
---
Just give us the terminator and let that game die
---
Eh it depends. I was on Hawkins the other day and was doing super well. 2 gens, ruin, 3 saves, and always escaped and I didn’t bm or anything. Just wanted to play the game lol
---
The one time I go down I’m under a pallet and my entire team goes super altruistic and goes for pallet save BEFORE I’m even picked up (some of them were even injured) and they all eventually went down.
---
The pig hooked my team while I tried to crawl away to find hatch. Killer finds hatch and my adrenaline pops and the two exits gates are on opposite sides of the map.
---
I go to one and start opening it. Halfway through my spine chill goes off and I know it’s gg but I still try to hide even though I know the killer heard the gate.
---
Killer comes up to me and crouches and then looks at the exit gate signaling me to go. I open exit gate and then boop the Pig’s snoot and then leave.
---
—
---
TLDR kind Pig let me leave after my entire tram went super dumb altruistic and got themselves downed. I boop the snoot and left.
---
Or I could not and do it again.
---
Here look r/sequelmemes
---
oh.. OHH yea, at this second I am joining a Game since this morning, yea oke, gotcha
---
It works, good hunt.
---
I personally find that players are overly enthusiastic around my rank (12) to unhook each other, to the point that if I don't stay on a gen when someone is getting hooked, we aren't ever going to complete anything.   In general though, I think you just have to be smart about it and take all of the factors into consideration when deciding if you should abandon a gen.
---
You: okay yeah it’s all good. Got my totem build all up and running
---
Survivors who conveniently spawned next to every totem: here’s a little lesson in trickery
---
My favourite is the little pit-pat noises his feet makes when he runs.  It’s oddly adorable
---
Just got into a lobby on PS4 as a survivor
---
It's been an issue from day one so not sure why it's a problem now?!?!?!
---
Or ghost-face, but that’s because he can do it too.
---
Maybe they were going for the tome challenge.
---
Yeah 2 min search actually revealed that the 80% figure is artificially inflated due to derankers and the number is closer to 43%. This was way back in May as well.
---
That’s like DS with unnerving prescense and spine chill

No idea mate
---
Because im playing matches
---
You’re doing a great job protecting that gate, lil buddy
---
“Just don’t tunnel” is not a valid argument because DS is not an anti-tunnel perk. 60 seconds is a lot of time. You can go for the unhooker, hook them, and *still* get hit with the last guy’s DS (which happens *a lot* if you’re a good killer)
---
Also if somebody jumps into a locker with DS there’s ZERO counterplay

And the teacher has unnerving presence?? The hell?!

What happens if you buy one of those colourblind glasses and play the game? My friend is colorblind and he likes to use them when he has to work looking for items in the store and when there’s a red item they pop.

Currently there isn’t really an incentive to rank up besides the chance of facing people who are more skilled at the game. No rank reset rewards rn, so no real point
---
What does entity displeased even mean or do? I've had a few good matches where the entity was displeased, and then I've had some pretty average matches (two survivors killed) and no displeased notification.

Sadly against an obvious 3-4man SWF, this tactic works a treat. People get fucking triggered when you say swf comms is “cheating” but I would say it’s an exploit that allows people to basically play on “easy mode” for sure.

While face camping is a shitty tactic, using a player to “bait the hook” and stay in the vicinity works well when players take that bait. Getting one kill early on tips the scales in your favor against swf. 
---
All the salty swf survivor mains hate it but if they wanna play one way, you gotta “adapt”.
---
***We must teach them!***
---
The ability would be cooler if there were multiple robots on the map that all had their pros and cons and you could switch between them. For example, maybe one robot has faster movement speed but is super slow at vaulting, and destroying pallets. The ability you have now could work as a passive.
---
Nah it works for some people. I just did and I’m able to play now.
---
In a recent ama they said they had discussed it but that's pretty much all they said.
---
If it comes and I doubt it will it would be a long way off.
---
Look up paulie esther on YouTube he did a video on the AMA its about an hour long so you can listen to it all during your next time searching for match
---
I do the exact opposite
---
I once had a killer tell me that if I don't want to get tunneled I shouldn't run directly into him next time... he put me in the basement and body blocked the stairs both times I was rescued. Completely ignoring the Nancy that rescued me. I was a salty salty boy.
---
Thanks very much! Ill have a listen
---
Ha, no. We still don't even get a safety pip for killers DCing
---
sharing personal opinion = gatekeeping, k megmain no brain.
---
Completely agree with him. Side note love that thumbnail
---
No.
---
PS4 is up!
---
Literally a David main but go off
---
That's complete bullshit and punishing the other survivors for someone being a baby.
---
Stuck on opening loading screen for Nintendo switch. Anyone know a fix?
---
Bonus 50k bloodpoints if it's your first time
---
That's all you can do, as well as make it so they can't leave comments on your steam profile.
---
Yeah, you can do something better with your time.
---
Like uninstalling Fortnite.
---
Yeah! But tbh that's what tremendously difficult skill checks should be, tiny and before the 6 o'clock
---
Yeah cuz having multiple escape routes is 100% more stale than sitting for minutes on end on a generator hitting one button every now and then.
---
When I’m like rank 17 I run mad grit, agitation and iron grasp just to run down survivors while carrying someone.
---
Just got a survivor game on PS4 EU
---
I'm not saying you shouldn't, There's just a limit to how many characters you can fit in this meme format.
---
I remember when I hit one of those skill checks on console for the first time...I got so nervous I ran to a locker thinking something was wrong lol.
---
When the killer hits you to the dying state and leaves you there. Basically you are crawling around like a slug. Get it lol.
---
I hear Phineas and Ferb theme song for some reason.
---
But, it costs 
---
M O N E Y
---
I know. Trust me, I know. I have 1200 hours of this game and play about 60/40 survivor and I see toxic asshole killers just as much as survivors.
---
Oh, wow, TIL
---
Are we 100%sure?!
---
Right there with you
---
These errors pop up every other match for the past month
---
It is to an extent. Personally am PC NA and I have gotten this a lot when I’m just trying to practice a new killer with like 1 perk.
---
It’s not the community as a whole ofc but there are people out there who actually are toxic like this for whatever reason.
---
I wouldn't even be mad about that, it's nice playing against a killer that is good with their ability. Other than camping as the cannibal..
---
* General Spam - Extremely low effort and/or zero effort posts.
---
bro can you not read the servers have been down all day
---
clown is so unbalanced. His cooldown?Fucking stupid. The fact that he can get a free hit is really pissy, and his fat ass moves just as fast as other killers. I mean look at him. Hes built like a freight train but still runs at 4.6 m/s???
---
I'm pretty sure you can read the power description for any killer regardless if you own them or not. Regardless, it wasn't sufficient grounds for completely scrapping Freddy's power. That's on the survivors, not Freddy.
---
I loved the movie but sadly feel like Peele is strict with his films and wouldn’t want any part of them to be in a game
---
it’s fixed. got into a lobby as a killer. god bless anyone who’s playing against the pig rn
---
As an avid player of the game the last thing I want is the history to be erased. It was a blast, and I'd love to see the characters in DBD.
---
Purple rank
---
"Is it edgy if I hit you? Is it more edgy not to hit you? I just don't know."
---
I dont know about pc, but it does happen fairly often on ps4 and xbox last I played on there. Normally its been people telling me that I'm trash  and then me responding by telling them that means their trash since I killed them.
---
Honestly I don’t get why people do this. Just say gg and move on. Nobody wins by engaging or responding to toxic behavior.
---
It’s not an accomplishment to crush a new player (whether killer or survivor) and if you engage in any toxicity you just end up spreading it more and making it worse for everyone else by feeding a toxic mindset.
---
Hes playing Doctor with no addons and no slow down perks. I didn't even notice if he actually used Brutal Strength for anything, MYC got him 1 down, I'm all ears didn't seem to help a ton, and I don't think he ever got any use out of the aura reading for BBQ. 
---
He was basically running a nearly perkless Doctor with no addons which has almost no chance to preform well at red ranks against a good team of survivors.
---
Its not really fair to take a low tier killer (who needs and the devs are working on buffing), not put any decent perks on him, not use any addons, and then go on a rant about DS being too strong because that combo lost against red rank survivors.
---
To demolish every Red rank SWF team who would really only be Green rank solo players. Well, that's my motivation anyway. Doesn't happen every match though. Every now and then I'll go up against some Red ranks who are genuinely great and those matches are extra fun.
---
I found a match on switch
---
Wait calm spirit negates Iron Maiden!? Are you guys sure? Because I use inner strength to heal and this could be a game changer since I’m running into Iron Maiden for some reason a lot more lately.
---
Love paulie great channel for up to date and accurate news!
---
it means you depipped, you get it when you don't do "good" to the games standards
---
Beats me. Free 1,000 bloodpoints though lol
---
Damn hopefully they do implement it
---
Toxic killers fly under the radar a lot bc of the whole "entitled survivor bad" and "it's my job to kill you lol I'm not ur friend". I'm never mad if someone kills me through genuine skill at most I get mad at myself for stupid plays I made.
---
This is a really nice concept
---
Servers are back up on PC. Finding games in 30 seconds now!

PS4 NA east - 1 minute for survivor lobby

Yeah😢

Ok thank you.

This particular issue has not been from day one; the servers were literally down. Queue times are an entirely different subject and varies per platform.

I'm playing also, PC europe

Oh yeah. I can relate to that man. Hate the stigma but I’m pretty sure it’s because this is a killer heavy subreddit, honestly.

Let's see your Onion do this bitchboys

Just had a game (PC) (Aus)
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but she's wearing the blight cosmetics? If that's the case, then they _murder_ my FPS on console. I had some severely bad games until I took them off and replaced them with her basic outfit.
---
Not saying this Hag was great, but just a note that there might be more going on here.
---
Yayy ps4 servers are back up
---
Wait until the killer is in a chase (Either Obsession claws are moving or you can see injured survivor running around with the Empathy perk) then click the totem over and over and over again.
---
It would’ve been really cool to have two Adelaides as survivor and killer
---
Reducing the bonus would probably make what ever perk you're reducing close to useless.
---
And girls
---
Exactly, so many get offended when I call them out on swf, it's because they are doing it and it's total BS
---
Aww this is cute and terrifying he has this smile where  you the person that drew the wraith yesterday
---
Edit you where the person love your work
---
Not my fucking fault I downed him in the first 20 seconds of the match with 2 m1s.
---
For real, thank god
---
It would amazing
---
The best part is your black silhouette just seething disappointment
---
Can't you guys change the monitor settings? I'm not saving there shouldn't be colorblind options but maybe the answer is simple
---
True! But consider: if they're clearly calling, go after that person and let the injured one go
---
fell asleep waiting to play and woke up to skill check notifications
---
"Surivors" smh
---
Or 99 nearby hooks then start popping them when the heartbeat goes crazy or spine chill does its thing
---
That doesn't keep it interesting.  You're still searching empty drawers most the time.  Stamina bar for movement is just uninteresting.  Perk/progression system is an absolute joke compared to the bloodweb and perks offer little to no difference in play from build to build whereas different loadouts fam make games feel night and day different from each other in DBD.  Running Jason is laughably easy.  He literally gets bullied to death in Friday.  I can beat the shit out of him between cabin looping and stop to whip out dance moves after each stun.  Running a killer in DBD takes far more skill which I appreciate.  Also killers actually feel wildly different in DBD.  In Friday it's just reskins with very minor stat differences.  Like I said the core gameplay is what the issue is in Friday.
---
It's a free hook and it activates perks such as BBQ. Losing a teammate cripples survivors more in-game than it does killers, but the effect post-game is equally crippling.
---
* Ban appeals - Use the Dead by Daylight Help Center, contact EasyAntiCheat or contact Steam Support.
---
Seems like PS4 servers are back up
---
I'm also asking this because I feel like I could learn a skill more easily on a harder killer to learn? Like, I'm getting the Oni as soon as that DLC is released because I know that following blood orbs will help me learn tracking
---
I wouldn't confide in angry comments causing people to stop DC'ing. It's a much bigger issue than simply being insulted and not doing it.
---
I think you forgot the shitpost flair
---
It's better than a dead sub with pointless iS NoED Op?'#@? every few days
---
Memes are the whole reason I love this sub!
---
If this isn't bait, just turn on memeless mode and stop complaining.
---
I stopped playing this game shortly after they introduced the Auric Cells thing because I thought it was a pretty shameful way for a non free to play game to be heading. 
---
This video reminds me of the problems the game had even then (and way before that).  Looks like the more things change, the more they stay the same.  I'm glad I got out when I did.
---
As a console player this us true, the size of the skill check don’t even matter, it’s when I suddenly drop frames that fucks me over.
---
In my opinion I’d say start of with hag. She has good perks and her ability, when someone walks over your traps, notifies you of where it goes off and allows you to teleport to it.
---
I'm glad that the servers are down because I've been playing the game every day to get 1 tier every time, and I needed the break

Two nights ago I had this same endgame result playing on the laboratory level. I had 2 kills, and the exit gate was already open. I downed the 3rd survivor because they were teabagging while injured with survivor 4 at the gate. While carrying survivor 3 I was able to injure survivor 4 who was teabagging and trying to flashlight me. Survivor 4 kept trying to save survivor 3 and was teabagging and flashing the whole time. When survivor 3 died, survivor 4 made a run for the exit gate but stopped to teabag one final time, and during that teabag I was able to close the distance with the heavy attack/lunge. My 2 kill game turned to a 4 kill, and I got a little more than 40,000 blood points. 
---
Why didn't they just leave?
---
PC is working for me, west coast
---
How? That dude plays against noobs all the time. Hides his rank he's playing against all the time too
---
Runs non meta perks on a low tier killer at high ranks and complains? I dont get people like this. I like chilling out with non meta builds but I gont expect to do well.
---
Still not effective enough
---
Makes sense
---
I think it's a good change. The no stagger made some loops too strong
---
You are supposed to bait hits not tank them
---
switch back to peer to peer....
---
Nice one dude, that's a fine looking video
---
I stand up for you. This kid got so cocky he had to post his trashy turning on reddit to boost his fat ego.
---
Dude he never hides his rank and he streams how can he hide his rank?
---
It did ask for no screenshots of end screen no? In the sub rules?
---
I watched this live and chat (and me) lost our collective minds
---
I was able to utilize the flashlight properly by blinding the killer at pallets, and for the first time I was able to blind a killer to let go of my teammate before they went into the basement. 
---
I also got David’s mechanic look with my shards and I’m very happy with it. My David looks so great now
---
No thanks.

---
Makes total sense haha. Is slugging considered a bad way to play? Sometimes I leave people crawling if I'm nervous about them Dead Striking me, or if I wanna try and injure another nearby survivor.
---
Billy and Spirit I'll agree with but Trapper is a matter of opinion I think. I guess it depends on what you find douchey. I main him and get accused of tunneling a lot but if you've just been unhooked and step in a trap that feels more like the survivors problem than mine.
---
They're back up now
---
Ps4 is up
---
I miss Hide or Die, game seemed like it had potential, just executed poorly
---
FUCK
---
Memeless Mode doesn't work. It's just covering up the fact that the base of this Sub is just memes, memes, and more memes.
---
Wait last year existed? Thought that was a fever dream.
---
*killer*
---
Nah man. It's totally viable and sometimes neccessary imo. Some survivors might get annoyed by it, but a killer gotta do what a killer gotta do.
---
So annoying they get downed once and they just leave. I had these types of games atleast 3 in a row now.
---
Some people want to see memes but not the ones that are seen often or have the same format that is seen a lot.
---
Additionally... while I know it's not a 'win' condition, his 2 stack of BBQ means he's going to get more BP's than all the survivors as well, a total of 24,033 BP for his game (since the end tally screen doesn't take that into account). So while the other team may have *won*, he's going to get more rewarded for it.
---
Be a real gamer and play Minecraft
---
That's kinda the point being made... low tier killers and non meta perks need buffs to actually you know.. make them meta.
---
Everyone enjoys memes, but if you take one look in New, you see a bunch of just terrible memes that only exist because people know they can Karma Whore.
---
Edit: Spelling.
---
Never, the only thing that becomes unavailable after a certain amount of time is the rift
---
I don't have sound on but as soon as the guy came on screen I knew what it was
---
Try not running ruin on almost any killer in the top ranks. Games over in about 5 mins and you can’t do shit about it, even if you play optimally
---
Toxicccccc
---
I found that Myers was really good for teaching me how to find survivors and end chases, which are fundamental. With Enduring and Spirit Fury, I was no longer afraid of pallets, and I learned how to start and end chases. No special powers, just a knife that sometimes hits harder.
---
I've been able to take those lessons to other, more complicated killers, because everybody needs to find and chase. And once you get over the fear of being hit in the head, you'll still know how to chase when you get another killer's powers. And since you've got a smaller terror radius, you'll have more success finding folks - you're probably looking in the right places, but they aren't there any more.
---
I made the mistake of beginning with Doctor. He countered stealth fairly easily and I wasn't learning how to find folks in the early stages of the game - my terror radius would do that for me. And, surprise surprise, I very rarely ended chases with him. Mostly, I'd just wear out the survivors until they gave up.
---
That's what I'm confused about because the games I've gotten the displeased notification from are matches where I feel I played a near perfect game. Like I got 3 kills which were all basement hooks, and I figured the entity would be proud.
---
There are tons of gaming Subs that have existed totally fine without memes. In fact, r/deadbydaylight is the odd one out.
---
It is fixed
---
Having a unpopular suddenly makes my opinion invalid. Nice.
---
I don’t actually play huntress often, really thinking about using her more now tho lmao
---
Yessir, you’re not allowed to post about DCs in the sub
---
Niiiiiiicccceeeeeeeeee
---
Lol yes it has been. I've been playing for a long time and i would say better than 90% of the randoms has complained about it.
---
It is? Finally! I was waiting all day.
---
"gets in to match. Someone D/C's after getting hit once by killer 30 second in to the match"
---
That's why you should play the Soulja Boy Console version it has no issues whatsoever.
---
Why is it  that I can only do effectively without ruin on Freddy ? (PS4 btw, so that’s a no go for nurse) Ah because he can actually pressure gens that get done in minutes flat. While everyone else can throw bottles of gas to slow survivors down.  Ooh I’ll try trapper this game; and swf dismantle all my traps with Object of obsession and finish the game in 5 minutes. Too much stress to play killer at times
---
Kate and Jane get to live always, unless there are 2 Kates/Janes, then I decide based on who is wearing the best outfit/who played the best. Like everyone else said, if someone gets farmed or anything like that, I let them go. If someone gives away the position of their teammates, whoever ratted them out gets constantly teabagged while down on the ground, by me and the person they ratted out and I let the person go. I’m also a sucker for survivors acting goofy. If I walk in killer shack and see survivors doing random silly stuff, I just leave them alone/farm with them because if they aren’t taking it seriously and are trying to have a good time, then so will I.
---
Everyone loves memes, I get that, but this Sub is so targeted towards memes that any post that isn't in a picture format will actually be actively downvoted. That's a problem specific to this Sub, and surprise, surprise. This Sub is one of the few gaming Sub that also allow memes...
---
I would think about the timer ending, or at least tick down faster, when the survivor starts repairing a gen. 
---
The video above showed the issue here absolutely perfectly. Both Steve and Nancy rushed straight to the gen next to the shack right after being unhooked. No bother healing up or playing safe, just straight to the gen because they knew that they get their 60 seconds where Otz cannot pick them up so they are free to do a gen. He didn´t even intend to tunnel them, but what was he supposed to do when they are sitting on a gen, let them work?
---
And think about it. DS is supposed to be an "anti-tunelling" perk. But are you being tunelled if you have time to start working on a gen? If you are being tunelled the last thing you are doing is reparing a gen. If you start doing that, that means you are very likely safe and the killer is not tunelling you. DS after that is just dumb.
---
Ah the universe
---
Yes the devs just confirmed it on twitter but they were back up like 20 minutes ago.
---
I mean they might change it because technically it says when you hook a survivor, not a husk. But same goes for my point too
---
I think Decisive Strike definitely needs a change, mostly with locker interactions. I submitted an idea where you could hold spacebar at a locker to instead rip the survivor out of the locker and throw them on the ground, to bypass it, or for whenever you feel slugging would be the smarter choice.
---
Otz was also using Doc who is pretty awful, with no real game delay perks at all. Chances are against a good team he wasn't going to win that scenario.
---
The thing is, because of the snowball effect, it is impossible to really gauge any evidence from any videos like this. Who is to say if he didn't screw up at the shack at the beginning he wouldn't have downed the Steve sooner, which would have bought him more pressure, where maybe he found someone else, or got to use MYC more, or..or.. There are just so many branching paths each game takes based on early actions.
---
He definitely made a few mistakes like playing shack badly and not shocking the window on the god bus at one point but the survivors all played well for the most part and Doctor with basically no perks or addons is terrible.
---
If anything I'd really say this is more of a critique on how bad no-addon Doc is, because hoo boy is he bad.
---
Thanks!!  PC working properly
---
Failing more than 3 hex skill checks is slower than tapping. However its still good to practice hitting great checks, if skill checks weren't 5 fps that is. Tapping is good when working on gens with other survivors.
---
Will survivors ever get something like this as well? I also want rank points for disconnecting survivors like killers. :(
---
I don't really understand the huge deal about achievements. You don't get anything for them, and if anything, it just makes you more frustrated when you're so close but fail...
---
That's how I feel! Like as a killer it is my job to kill survivors, and for some reason it seems like survivors can't understand that concept. There is 1 of me and 4 of them, it stands to reason that I might kill at least 1.
---
Yep just had a match as jester claimed jailor and that was that said nothing then didn't even win maf won
---
I made that exact mistake, by starting with doc. It really makes you feel blind when you use another killer
---
dagnabbit ya beat me to it
---
Fastest fingers in the west
---
(I was driving too)
---
Is it worth the 4th perk slot though?
---
It's the internet. It's not that serious. If you don't like the memes, then don't look at them.
---
it was exclusive to discords short lived game store so I dont blame you for not knowing
---
You cant make everything meta, there's always going to be a top build
---
I get what you’re trying to say and I watched Otz video as well but at the end of the video he did say he was playing as doctor and he wasn’t very good at him. Most games Otz does pretty well. It’s just there was no way he could stop the gens from being rushed because there was no perks that kept them from progressing. It definitely does need to be changed up though. We really need better killer perks, unfortunately the new killer perks only seemed to be super useful for Legion.
---
I'm pretty sure I'm shit enough to begin with...
---
The servers for switch is still down
---
Entity: "Congratulations Kappy65, you're our newest Killer! Here's a spoon, go hook some Survivors."
---
Barbecue is better on billy, plus extra bloodpoints means you can get more stuff faster
---
I was never a fan of F13, but holy shit that game got axed in it's prime.
---
The lawsuit just ended the game's updates right then and there. It's still happening right now and even when it possibly ends in 2020, Gun Media said they're never adding content again.
---
Sure this Myers is hot and cool. But a Default Doctor Cosplay would be hotter.
---
Definitely BBQ
---
Deceit and F13 still have around 1000 daily players, but so far DbD isn’t dethroned.
---
I suppose I can agree with that, in my mind the infinite building loops are just "one loop", but in actual fact they tend to including five or six "pallet" sets, the building itself, and sometimes a jungle gym.
---
It's not literally absolutely an infinite of course, but since you can go back to the building (which some of these are true infinites with balanced landing in the current state, but even with the incoming BL nerf they are still painful since most of them don't rely on drop points at all outside of Haddonfield) with all its strength and multiple windows repeatedly (something that Plague's temple can also have going for it in some renditions) between each and every pallet...
---
Well, like you said, you can run the killer for all 5 gens; and even lesser loops still fall prey to toolbox users who wait until you pass, since a good 30-40 second chase is still 3 gens popping if you took 20 to 40 seconds (based on toolbox) to find them, it's usually enough to leave most of the pallets up on the map for later use, and even wasting pallets in one corner is still going to be enough of a delay for the 3 gens.
---
Though that's a bit off the topic of infinites and more about how one-dimensional the chase mechanics are.
---
I personally hate spine chill way more than any other survivor perk as killer.  There just isn't any real counter play for it.  You either waste time 10-20 seconds looking for them and risk them not actually being there or just leave and let them keep working on the gen.  There just isn't any real counter play for it (other then just look the other way 4head)
---
Wow that severed head looks scary, well done!
---
Not Scottish either. It’s either from Yorkshire or Lancashire, definitely.
---
Queue killer just vaulting windows 10 times at the start of a match.
---
Edit: misread and didnt see it was in a chase
---
See title. Adept Trapper achievement, Hungry Jaws challenge and two Trapper dailies in one very juicy game.
---
But because of the token system, people who play Nurse have to glance at her power waaaaay too much. Otherwise they run the risk of accidently blinking a millisecond too soon and having to wait MORE just because they didn't have a second blink. She is slow as bricks without being able to blink frequently too. She's reliant on a power that makes her easy to genrush because it doesn't travel far, is used much less, and if a person doesn't have their eyes constantly glued to the token number, they can accidently blink once and proceed to not have a second blink, making them have to waste MORE time getting blinks back.
---
There was a suggestion that Nurse's blinks actually use a power gauge and blinking would subtract from it. This sounds better to me.
---
If you think that second blinks only coming .25 ms later is all, you evidently don't know much about Nurse. Especially new Nurse.
---
Bro I'm arab idek where these are
---
Congratulations on the adept!
---
Same reason im assuming these people didn't. Just trying to be cocky. That last guy, the one who teabagged again, probably thought he was going to escape and wanted to say "you got three but you didn't get me lololol"
---
So yeah, thanks for fucking him over
---
To state what side of the argument you're on so your comrades dont flame you, as killer main
---
Ah- basically, they’re just different parts of the UK.
---
People just label you as an “entitled survivor main” or an “entitled killer main”. It’s all stupid, we’re all players, it shouldn’t matter wether we mainly play survivor or killer
---
Same thing happened to me a few days ago
---
yesh its not really supposed to be "high level nurse gameplay" i was just really making a shitpost ngl
---
do you want a better chance at winning or do you just want more blood points
---
And yet Mods still exist on Subs for some reason... Almost to enforce rules to keep them from becoming a free for all.
---
The fact that the Mods have made the choice to make memes allowed on this Sub (Which is unusual for a gaming Sub) has caused any actual content to be buried underneath, and I cannot make this shit up, the ***SHITPOST/MEME*** Flair.
---
Lol imagine tho
---
Go to main menu and try again. But tbh I think turning it off doesn't work anymore. At least not for me
---
Bruh. Crotus Penn Asylum/ Disturbed Ward is the worst for totems. That need to rework that map
---
I know haha thats what I was thinking, i was like shitttttt
---
Thanks, that takes me to three now for killers, I already had Huntress and Wraith.
---
Sorry bro I'll respect it next time
---
HA! that is relatable!
---
I mean as a color blind person this is hard for me to personally refute, so in every one of these 'daily shitpost' threads so far, everyone who isn't colorblind consistently points out that they have absolutely no issues in seeing and following scratchmarks and blood stains.
---
That they see these easily at a distance, any distance.
---
That they can follow them without difficulty or trouble or effort.
---
That they are fully and easily visible.
---
That they know exactly where the survivor is, and where they are going, with the current coloration.
---
Basically: "I can use this element of the game in any situation, at any distance, without any difficulty, to always follow and track the survivor without any confusion".
---
**What would changing it to blue actually do?**
---
Would it increase the distance at which current Killers can see scratchmarks? No.
---
Would it increase the ease of tracking them, based on first-hand accounts? No.
---
Would it somehow aid their information gathering when in the current rendition, they already gather complete and total information from the visual cues to the extent that blood and scratchmarks could provide regardless of color? No.
---
Would it make what was already fully visible to the naked eye immediately, somehow visible more quickly? No.
---
Would blue improve scratchmarks and bloodstains for players who are not color blind, or give them an advantage, when considering the above? No.
---
Therefore it's okay for them to be blue for colorblind individuals.
---
If that's not satisfying I don't know what is.
---
Bold of you to assume the Claudette is working on a gen
---
People are already asking for double BP as compensation, lol.
---
PS4 is up now, two matches and everything seems ok.
---
Or if your a killer they don’t like you hit them while they stand there then they drop to the floor lol
---
Then maybe don't come into this sub if you don't like what's allowed to be posted. 🤷‍♂️
---
I'd say ruin for now, once you get more experience with Billy get BBQ
---
do you have Kate by chance? she has this perk called Windows of Opportunity, which basically highlights all of the pallets and vaults closest to you. I don’t have Kate, but I got Windows in the shrine when it was there, and it helped me a lot when I was trying to get better at looping and getting away. :)

"Oh boy. Another Legion cosplay. How creative and original" How ever did they make a mask, Hoodie and Skirt? Impressive"
---
Lemme know when somebody has a cosplay of Doc, Hag, Nurse, Wraith, Billy, Pig, etc.
---
Ready for my downvotes.
---
Edit: Legion cosplay is incredibly easy and brainless. The mask looks nice but still very little work required. It's basically just free upvotes. There's a reason why you see a new Legion cosplay three or four times a day on the Reddit. I find it incredibly boring. It takes next to no effort to get the hoodie leggings or pants. The weapon is legit a hunting knife or broken ruler. The mask is the only part that requires effort and even then you can get it done in a couple hours.
---
I remember this amazing Doctor Cosplay I saw back around Halloween on here. There are some really good Hunters ones. And there was even a good Wraith cosplay that took a lot of effort. The problem is those take days and days of effort. Tons of effort. Why do all of that when you could just make another lazy Legion cosplay? Just as many upvotes with less than a day's work.
---
The speed isnt the same though. Adrenaline gives a quick burst of speed that is only beneficial if youre in a chase. NOED exists the whole time its active. I understand your point that the totems should be done too but the speed part of each perk are not equatable at all.
---
The other part is the adrenaline comes after you complete your goal of doing 5 gens. NOED comes after you fail your objective of protecting the 5 gens
---
I dont really complain so much of NOED its annoying but I dont have nearly the problem other people do with it but those two parts of your argument are pretty weak in defending your point. Just stick to the totems should be done too to prevent it.
---
As a Killer Main, I second this.
---
gg piece of shit
---
Okay, no worries :)
---
Ruin isn't really a necessity for billy
---
A 4% haste effect is not a “small burst in speed”. Thats an insane boost in speed especially so for killers.
---
Devs nerfed all the survivor meta perks, especially exhaustion perks.
---
They do it to try and lend their statements more credibility. So people don't just dismiss it as "oh you're just a salty Killer/Survivor".
---
It doesn't work.
---
Yes but also ranking up will bring you better players so you can improve
---
Cuz if you say thing like “hey i think gen speeds are to fast” youre labeled a crybaby killer main and if you say things like “i think noed needs a rework” youre labeled as an entitled survivor main. So people preface their arguments with which side they main preemptively to avoid the exchange always going like this: “hey i propose x change to the game that favors side y” “entitled y main” “actually i main x”.
---
I deadass wanna know how she made it
---
Bruh hundreds of perks ?
---
Ah yes I can't wait to play as the onyo.
---
The gas canister idea does sounds really cool, but  slowdown for just being in a team doesn't sound all that fair.. The canisters will be scattered around the map and the time it takes them to get them will probably cover for it, It also gives the killer more things to patrol and more time to chase, Cool idea.
---
Well they’re not completely equal ( if they were then killers wouldn’t really have an advantage) but they function in similar ways. And I never think of it as rewarding the killers failure, the same way I don’t think that he’s devour hope is rewarding the killer for letting survivors save each other of the book (the killers failure technically)
---
As a person who plays both, I want to die
---
I kind of agree on reversing the nurse because her addons are really weird right now and I don’t enjoy her as much as I used to before.
---
Unless they make it even for both sides in terms of the dcer then itd just punish one side.
---
Like I'm just imagining me, a person who has never dced went to play killer and got a lobby of all quitters and I drank because I killed one or had ruin or something or other that makes a survivor dc that causes a chain reaction of dcs. Because you know they always go out in waves
---
Well currently it's either the server or you, isn't it? Since the killer doesn't host anymore, they aren't responsible for whether the skill checks are laggy.
---
also you should try playing killer more often if you don’t already. it can be daunting with the amount of toxicity you get from survivors, but it provides some insight into how the killer sees the map and better ways to hide and lose them in chase, etc. basically, watch how the other survivors loop you and lose you in chase and try to apply those strats in your own survivor games. i played more killer to get better at surviving and i played more survivor to get better at killing. both perspectives are important when trying to learn the game!
---
BBQ ez
---
Exactly, irritates the shit out of me
---
It's a credibility thing. Lots of people that clearly don't play the side they are claiming to play (often salty survivors pretending to play killer, but the other way happens as well) add it to the rant/argument/whatever to make it look like they know what they are talking about from both perspectives
---
It wasn't nerfed, it was brought in line with other exhaustion perks
---
BBQ
---
They are but they aren’t lol the connection works but is hella laggy
---
I had a similar idea a while ago where after reaching 25% 50% 75% 100% survivors have to solve an increasingly difficult puzzle where if they get it wrong too many time it resets back 25% and while trying to solve the puzzle the screen is blocked by the puzzle and survivors won't be able to see anything.
---
This would also indirectly buff stealth killers.
---
Big facts
---
I had it happen before the release of the tomes. Anyways, I don't really hate them for using a perk. My comment was mostly a joke but I do find it really annoying.
---
I didn't know six year olds played this game. Keep it up lil buddy this one should go on the fridge!
---
Would be a good ruin counter if they remove the injured restriction
---
Who would have thought that adding more people to the possible list of players would make load times longer... DBD works in strange ways
---
Why not just say " I play killer alot" this whole 'maining' shit is stupid, this sub is trying to be anti 'us Vs them' mentality but all you see is this stupid shit
---
It's probably the moment I am most proud of, but I've only been playing for a short time. I don't know why but it seems like the survivor mains are often pretty toxic.
---
Where's her neck at tho
---
These are actually really good and balanced changes, too bad the devs only care about toxic survivors cuz they buy cosmetics. They gutted nurse and spirit and now legion is better than them
---
Yeah because DS, BT, Adrenaline, and Dead Hard are super uncommon too.
---
you made me spit my cola cmon
---
How do you see out of that thing?
---
But ruin increases the frustration and great skillchecks only feel Good when theres Progression done. To keep people at a game you want them to have a positive experience. Not a negative one.
---
When, as you stated, ruin is up until the First Down and you have no counterplay whatsoever its Bad for the game in general.
---
Having a secondary objective is probably the easiest fix to fast games. Then you would probably need to take a look at which Killer is then overperforming. Giving nurse another 2 Minutes in a game could be a death sentence.
---
How can you miss something, that nearly never really existed. xD
---
Dude why have you created an account today seemingly Just to be toxic to random people on this subreddit?
---
I agree, both changes together make it really hard to do anything
---
I'm consistently a red rank killer as Wraith and I still get 360'd a few times per match. Even expecting it and playing around it, the framerate is too rough to keep up on some maps.
---
Hag is especially awful as her skins are bugged and cause a lot of stuttering. Using the new skin I almost had to leave a match because I couldn't move around the map at the start without running into walls because of it. Her jungle skin used to freeze the game for no less than a second sometimes when placing traps.
---
I don't read or look at the memes, but that doesn't mean they should be banned. A good deal of people seem to enjoy them. Let people have their harmless fun.
---
If it's not something you want to deal with, then there are other options where you can have DBD related discussions and get up to date news. Twitter, Discord, the official forums, Steam forums, etc.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure why it's causing people to not find a game I know servers are down on console too but on PC seems to work if you disable cross-play
---
kindred is a must in rando lobbies for me
---
Where's the joke?
---
Sorry, but I dont understand what you are trying to say. If a survivor dcs whilst you are killer you get bloodpoints, but cant rank up or down, like all other survivors in the match. The person who dcd is going to get into special lobbys if thats a common thing for them. If the other survivors follow hid example they will get treated accordingly.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e16aj4/decisive_crouching_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I think gens should be REALLY slow when there's 1 people in it, and get slightly faster with more people in it. This would make it so survivors have to work together to win, and remove some pressure they have on the map.
---
Servers aren’t down anymore
---
Maybe it spends longer trying to find a fair match up since there are more possible players closer to your level.
---
Thank you for giving me the next thing on my 'to draw list' ;)
---
Wraith/ trapper don't really need buffs, they just take time to master. Doctor is pretty good with the right builds too.
---
good to know, thank you
---
Anyone having issues with ps4 still? Played one match and nownits error after error
---
I’m like relatively good at the game. Like enough to pull off some jukes and loops, but not even close to Noob3 level. Still killers hate that I don’t suck at the game so nobody lets me live anymore.  :(
---
I'm not caught up with the lore. Why is the Entity wearing that hat/metal cap ?
---
They didn't gut Spirit, they only changed some of her ridiculously overpowered addons like prayer beads and the amulet. She'll still be playable, just not as absurdly broken as before
---
I say this pretty much everytime;
---
The fact that ruin is mandatory to make the game last more than a few minutes is a serious design error and it needs to be addressed. How to do so I have no idea but I really feel a games length shouldn't be determined by having ruin/no ruin. It's stupid.
---
No struggle + no dickitry = hatch.
---
Really really love this. So good.
---
Ur*
---
I'm aware but idk the accents :p
---
*crazed giggling intensifies*
---
Now download some mods and start making the killers
---
It’s faster saying “as a killer main” than saying “as someone who plays killer a lot”
---
Glad to see your face in the front page of the subreddit HB!
---
As a Killer main, I can help you with that in game.
---
I can 100% guarantee you DC when the match isn't going your way
---
AN ACTUAL DAMN MOOD
---
There is an addon that leaves him stuck in teir 1, so he can't up his teir, which leaves him slower and with a smaller lunge, but in teir 1 he has no terror radius, and with the addon, he can see everyone in a 32 meter radius when he stalks.
---
R\*
---
That wouldn't be a problem if this wasn't the main Dead by Daylight Sub. 🙄
---
I've been getting into him, even got slash enthusiast and one of my favorite moments so far was making a claudette quit, not cause i was tunneling her but I was in stealth and ended up scaring her by yoinking her off a gen.
---
ur trash dud
---
I mean, play how you want but you’re only wasting your own time doing that. of course they’re gonna dc. put a trap on someone who doesn’t have one and is probably pushing gens, not the person still struggling to take theirs off.
---
Because someone may be a Killer main but forced to play Survivor because of queue times.
---
Seems whenever I'm on Survivor gets in in 20 seconds while Killer takes 10 minutes for a game.
---
Paging u/not_Queen_bhvr please, can we get an answer for this? It’s been literal years
---
I’m kinda for this as I’ve been going for adepts recently and too many crybaby survivors just dc after I down them fairly. 
---
Someone literally told me in postgame that they dc’ed just to deny me adept. 
---
This would just be a bandaid solution though, whats needed is significant punishments for people who do dc. Both Killer and Survivor need penalties like longer queue times, loss of bloodpoints, temporary suspension of certain perks/perkslots/certain killers or just outright bans.
---
I think that’s the Doctor’s headpiece
---
The only change I would make to DS is: if somebody else is downed and hooked while you have DS active, it becomes disabled.
---
True homie
---
yeah but the way it works makes me think they'll implement reconnecting. ^^let ^^me ^^hope
---
That's a good idea.
---
cool story bro
---
Fuck you, don’t touch my totem
---
Posted something similar a few days ago, but this is slmething else lol the photoshop is awesome.
---
You can remap the controls...I made mine 'X' and it is so much better
---
Thank you :)
---
Cause they are. Survivor mains tend to complain about everything, even to people on their own team.
---
I dont think so its the killers job to put them on the hook not exactly their job to make sure they stay there its just their job to hook them 3 times. But the thing is most times adrenaline is activated the sprint part doesn't even factor in.  I do think it's a little bullshit that adrenaline counts for people on the hook too. 
---
Idk what you mean by advantage the game should be balanced so neither side has an advantage. I mean I get that a killer needs to be powerful enough to equal 4 survivors so maybe thats what you meant?
---
Nah I eat tombstones and moris my dude.  I hate it but that's a part of the game.  I only have DC'd a few times, and ate the shit talk for it.  See the difference?
---
I honestly think it's hilarious, all this hate.  So many killer flair whiners running in to take their shot.
---
Love it! Amazing cosplay.
---
Portugal no dead by daylight! &lt;3
---
My Most used with hag are the green turtle shell and green cicada, they give longer lasting traps, and you can teleport from a larger range
---
I remapped my skill checks to the 'X' on my Xbox controller, and it is so much better

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e16fa6/nerfe_freddy/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
The average freight train travels at about 35 km/h.
---
Sorry but I never spare survivors, not because I like getting all four survivors hooked (although it is fun). I don’t spare survivors because I’m trying to be a responsible parent to the baby survivors.
---
If I just give them the hatch or let them escape through the gates, then they’ll never learn how to do it on their own. No, if they want to escape they’ll have to earn it, that way not only will they get better at the game and learn how to escape on their own but they’ll also appreciate their victory so much more if they had to work hard to get it.
---
Lol you know you can just remap the controls right?
---
NOED because it rewards bad killers and bad gameplay
---
Adrenaline
---
am big fan, one might even say it's worth many a bean.
---
Totally agree with this. I would’ve taken any nerf over this rework.
---
Kinda sounds like you suck at nurse
---
Ikr, just downvoted just because of that. Also have We're Gonna Farm Forever.
---
Yeah, but you also get points for dying as the obsession
---
Omg this survivor just missed a ruin check I guess I'm not gonna try this game /s
---
That sounds like a lot of fun tbh! I'd seen a video about that kind of Myers, but never knew how it was done. Cheers man.
---
That actually made me jump
---
on pc, i can load a match but everything is lagging to an extreme and no textures are loading.
---
DS is still a royal pain in the ass to deal with (which tbf it will never not suck for killers) but I have a fond hatred for object of obsession because I know damn well that survivor is a looping god and I will never catch them.
---
As for survivors dealing with killers, probably between nurse's calling and thanataphobia. Both are annoying as hell to deal with
---
I think that’s Jeff not jake, I might be mistaken
---
Better than what a lot of guys get...
---
There's a huge difference between "Non-Meta" and "Absolute garbage" though.
---
Something like Windows of Opportunity will never be meta. Same with Pebble. And that's fine, because those aren't perks designed to be meta. Technician has no right to exist in its current state though.
---
DS needs to change. Not because it shouldn't be anti-tunnel, it absolutely should. DS is like NoED in that it forces the Killer to play around DS when no one even has DS at all. I've stopped running DS and started running Unbreakable just because I *know* I can make a really stupid play and the Killer will slug me just because I "Obviously" have DS.
---
I mean DC's are unfair towards killers too. I've de-pipped because two people DC'd, I kill one guy and the last gets hatch.
---
Besides, the killer still has to spend time to hook it, and time is your most valuable resource. Also, any effects they get from hooking a husk are effects they should have got anyway if a downed DCer had stayed when they went down. It's more fair because it doesn't give survivors a bullshit way to deny the killer points and perk effects that they earned fairly. The game isn't balanced around DC's.
---
As a killer who runs franklins, franklins. Not op in any sense it’s just very annoying to play against
---
I would also recommend the pig, the stealth lets you get close and find survivors easier. Plus the head gear can help make matches last longer giving you more time to learn, which as a new killer is invaluable. However she is okay, but not great, for learning to end chases but still a good first killer to get used to it all
---
Just because they left doesn’t mean you have to be a dick. I can understand being annoyed at them, but to be that much of a cocky c**t is just unneeded. Idk why you think you have the right to be such an a-hole to players.
---
Well duh, husks aren't implemented yet so nothing in-game refers to them. But the devs have specified that the husk is treated as a survivor for all perk and scoring purposes.
---
Rancor reveals your location every time a gen is done (including the last gen)
---
I would if I could 😉
---
Which is exactly why I think ranks should be removed. Like, I get it, there's SBMM in the game. But the rank reset doesn't help that by pairing new players against existing ones every month on the 13th. Or at least add a casual mode where there are no ranks, then have the ranked modes separate.
---
OK, if you want to be adult about it maybe you should in future look to post actual criticism so the person min question could improve those aspects of their art and design and make the subreddit better than any other by constantly improving itself instead of tearing people down for trying.
---
But most survivors that DC against me were about to get hooked annyway. It's a real fuck you to spend 2 minutes chasing around a survivor while his friends get to do gens the whole time and then not get the benefit once I actually catch him. Especially when it was goinng to be his third hook and he's out of the game anyway.
---
*Ornyo*
---
I thought it would be a cool idea as a secondary power to be able to walk in a locker and come out of another one. Like, stage lights appear on the ground and there's a drum roll, then you walk out of a locker.
---
You could try moonwalking/backpedaling if you saw them already. It works sometimes for me against people with spine chill.
---
Why do ppl think nea is ugly
---
New killer: The human centipede.
---
Bbq cause you already have ruin? Is there a yellow one?
---
Imho the rework was a good step forward with the power but a few steps back with the add-ons.
---
I love the cooldown bhvr added is it really reinforces blink accuracy and reads over just spamming the shit out of it and eventually hitting someone
---
The add-ons leave a lot to be desired though, some of them are interesting, but not a lot of them really do anything for you. A good chunk of them even hurt you for using them.
---
Also, bhvr. Darlings. Nurse does not need 3 meme add-ons
---
I actually already get it regulary enough to expect this and i am still in the green ranks.
---
I honestly dont want to go higher than green anymore, especially since i don´t want/have to use Ruin
---
As a spectator main I think we should nerf the login screen
---
You'd be perfectly correct if I didn't play on Xbone
---
Thing is, she's still the most powerful killer in the game by far. Only gen-grabber spirit was better, and that's soon-to-be-gone. So maybe just buff the others and force survivors to accept that 'escape' and 'win' aren't the same thing?
---
wraith is fairly easy and can find survivors really well, some people say that if u are a good wraith u are a good killer in general, cant confirm, but is a great choice for learning the basics anyways, fun to play, a bit weak maybe, but for getting started is not really an issue.
---
with only the 5 free killers (PC) u have a wide variety of playstyles for experimenting i believe, and then u can get other killers that fit into your style. hope it helps
---
Wraith is in the bottom 4 of killers (Wraith, Legion, Bubba, Clown).
---
"Patience" and "support" lmao
---
Oni getting violently nerfed post-ptb *December 2019, colourised*
---
This isn't totally accurate. If I am playing killer and the game progresses, if a survivor (or god forbid multiple) disconnect, it drastically lowers the amount of bloodpoints I get in the match (less hunt points, less sacrifice points, less BBQ &amp; chili multipler if they do it after getting downed before first hook, etc) and likely negates any chance I have of gaining a pip. It also ruins the fun of the game.
---
Just out of curiosity, why is it that you don't have an issue with NOED? I've never really seen someone not have a problem with it.
---
Is this for pc only?
---
So awesome! Congrats!
---
Killers can get NOED by afking.
---
Survivors can’t get Adrenaline if they afk.
---
Would be better with the Futurama cryo chamber sequence.
---
I suppose so. Just out of curiosity, if they gave Freddy fake pallets/snares and aura reading instead of gen teleportation, would you prefer it over Freddy’s current rework?
---
This is generally one of the better Subs, but this is also a Karma Whoring Sub.

10/10
---
I fail to see how it is my job to try and teach others surely my original post alone would invoke some form of self-reflection on your part thereby already putting my own ideals into motion.   
---
It is not my job to baby every single poster into trying to be better rather it is down to us as posters kindle that change within ourselves and i just don't think thats possible without the harshness that post similar to mine provide.  
---
Instead of calling us toxic look deeper into the negativity and make postives come from it.
---
There are people here who are saying that maps where bl is strongest should be reworked. Why do that when you can just change a few numbers on a perk.
---
Only problem with covering the screen are the same stealth killers that get buffed by that system.
---
-Coxcombed clapper wraith 
---
-Ghostface
---
-Spirit kind of
---
-T1 Myers
---
All of them give little to no auditory warning of their approach until It's too late so it would be very unfun for survivors to play against
---
This is a 10/10 shitpost
---
Lmao, great vid dude
---
Well, first of all, I can't, because that's paywalled gameplay content.
---
Secondly, that would only solve the problem for me, but only if the problem is wanting more Survival points (it's not).
---
And finally, perks shouldn't be band-aids for bad game design.
---
I love it

r/nice

If you scroll down far enough, you'll find Hex: Memeless Mode.....

This would have been a better meme if you put the check at like 4-5 o'clock

NOED has a counter. Adrenaline doesn’t.
---
How is the new Luigi’s mansion?
---
As a survivor main, I'd give ypu platinum but I'm a broke ass.
---
I mean it’s not his fault he only plays like once a month
---
That is true. Though, it's also true to say that survivors also DC based on the map and the killer alone.
---
The 5 o'clock ones I've been getting aren't much better Lol
---
Jesus, dude I just want to get on with my day without a ton of reddit notifs so I'm just going to stop here. Have a nice day.
---
Except this is a purely visual thing. Autoaim affects gameplay, this does not
---
I hope you reported them lol
---
You can eventually hit these all the time, its one of the few consistent things in the game.
---
Most of the time.
---
It’s not his. He’s making fun of someone else’s post.
---
That's already a mess, though. 3 Survivors with 4 gens basically can't win, period. That's a whole separate issue, but people yelled when I suggested buffing the remaining players slightly per DC.
---
It takes survivors more time to do gens, and the killer has less people to hook.
---
The results of many a rage followed by "you fucked me... you fucked me!"
---
Really loudly to which my housemate is like "people walking by probably think you're the most abusive person in the world..
---
"
---
Tbf it's not like the other survivors can hear me...
---
Not his work. He’s making fun of someone else’s concept by calling it childish
---
When you can complete multiple tasks at once

*best feeling ever*
---
you can’t talk shit on GFE when you play on console
---
This man gets it. OH GOD, NOT THE DOWNVOTES! AUUUUGGGHHHH!
---
Doesn’t mean I can’t love the concept. Screw this guy though
---
From best to worst top tiers, Nurse, Spirit, Billy/Hag/Huntress are interchangeable... even Demo.
---
all of this discussion about it is dumb and useless. Because they are just going to give up on hook immediately if they can't DC
---
I do agree with the meme though, it should count as 3 hooks
---
Again, the survivor is gone already. if they DC then the gen speed is...you know what, it's not worth it
---
I didn't see the original post so I didn't know what he was doing here.. thanks for point it out. What a dick.
---
Cheaters who don't have colorblindness will have a field day with this
---
Hehe I did that. But looked at them and tried to make them in human form. Also The Nurse ended up related to Trapper...
---
Yeah I know it sucks: it's my first meme.
---
Some of the most fun I've had in this game since I got it a week or two ago has been connecting with my adversaries. If I've ever called you a handsome young man or a gentle young lady if you've shown me mercy, you deserve it. 
---
Don't get too jaded ;)
---
Bbq works better on billy IMO. I play him without ruin and I always manage to have good map pressure.

possibly, I mean this is BHVR. They introduced not 1, but 2 perks that make it possible as well as emphasized the effect of this on several other perks that were already capable of doing this. The entire idea around the Undetectable and Oblivious effects completely promote this way of play on Legion.
---
It isn't hard to assume that BHVR are going 1 of 2 routes, they are thinking this is alright on Legion or are gearing up to change how Frenzy works in general.
---
So Cum Baron you’re like, literal trash?

Watch as galaxy brain spirits start moonwalking towards gens while phasing so spine chill doesn't trigger
---
I haven't seen a ton of that, thank god. I'm still at pretty low/mid ranks though. In that case sure, it doesn't make any sense to reward the killer, but I'd sure like to have a hefty punishment on the people that DC like that regularly because it ruins the fun for everyone else, killer and survivor!
---
there is cross-play ?
---
I leveled up Tapp just for Stake Out, I’m unwavering in my usage of that perk. So while I may be an Ash main, a quarter of my soul is a Tapp main
---
Git Gud
---
Aren't dedicated servers active now? I thought lag isn't on the killers anymore.
---
I’m on Xbox currently and I’m able to get lobbies pretty fast at the moment, last night was a nightmare though, kept getting errors or disconnected
---
There is genuinely something wrong with you, I hope you get better.
---
Can I join I dont want to die anymore
---
Yeah, I can feel that way sometimes. I'm not quite sure why it happens but it does. What I do to calm down is put on some music or youtube and take a small break.
---
I smell entitled on this post
---
As i saw someone say, ruin. Its not that i cant hit the skillchecks if I'm focused on the game I can hit 8/10 of them, its just that after a while you get tired of sitting on the generator and you just want to run around to find the ruin
---
What an absolute sad sack.
---
yeah i just feel bad for op. they put time and work into that for some idiot to reupload it thinking theyre deep and profound for bullying people. they got my upvote though :)
---
Its all good bois, we just ran into a little bit of unforeseen circumstances
---
Danny: Where do you keep your Double A batteries?
---
Entity: *incomprehensible whispers of horror*
---
Danny: Thanks.
---
Pop goes the weasel.... specially if your team aren't playing ball.
---
Ruin and NOED have counters so I don't mind. I always do totems and usually get 4 out of 5 when up against serious killers. It can lead to my early death though cause it can leave you out in the open
---
When I first started playing, I thought that “exposed” meant the killer could see me through walls and stuff
---
This. Anyone who says exhaustion perks are required to loop a killer are bad at looping. There is no such thing as a mandatory survivor perk. I do totem hate builds (Detectives Hunch + Inner Strength.) And then put on farming perks like Pharmacy + We're Gonna Live Forever, and I loop killers just fine. The only difference is that I get punished for my mistakes, while exhaustion perks give survivors a crutch.
---
I umm I wasn't talking trash but if ya wanna take it that way I suppose I have my answer as to why nobody likes you
---
Bubonic Babe is thrown around alot
---
I do this sometimes. Only because like 98% of my other games someone goes for the hook instantly.
---
I'd love it. Just the map, no killer or survivor. Maybe Kazaan and one of his perks can be Savant
---
Which is ALSO a good reason to have husks.
---
lol is every survivor ever on PC toxic or something bc that’s all I see memes and comments about like damn
---
I don't DC, but I do hate him. He has a built-in Insidious that's much better than Wraith or Michael's, he gets rewarded for being revealed, and he's irritating to play against because he bypasses both the terror radius and height mechanics intended to make Killers noticible.
---
Ok there bud, I'm getting my stacks no matter what, you can't stop me
---
I believe perks are earned differently on mobile but im not sure about teachables
---
You'd hope survivors had more variety to play with because unlike killers they don't have powers which affect their playstyle
---
A little bit of it definitely depends on maps. Billy struggles on indoor maps but Ghostface excels on them, vice versa for the big open corn maps. Freddy's a can of worms I don't want to open in this discussion lol but he's definitely in the conversation for stronger killers.
---
One nice thing about GF is a strong SWF doesnt shut him down as well as most killers. It's hard to coordinate around what he is doing when you almost never know where he is. If you play a predictable sneak up and stalk style they know who you are going after and where they can pressure. If all you're doing is popping out of nowhere, smacking people and dissapearing, it becomes very difficult to predict when and where he's going to pop out next. Combine that with how dangerous healing around a GF with Nurse's is, and sprinkle in the occasional gen grab when they're lazy and you got a hell of a killer.
---
People can't stand it when their opinions clash with facts; anonymously down-voting the truth without providing evidence to support their standpoint is far easier than actually doing research or studying human biology. at university. for 5 years. which is what I did.
---
And you'll notice I won't pretend to be an expert, however a colorblind person will (as you can see above). This kind of argument from authority is a logical fallacy, but reddit falls for it all the time.
---
I let the last go if there's a DC, or the remaining players go if there are two.
---
I'll also let the last one go if they're baby Survivors.

---
You can still not get enough points in the category to depip. Imagine you get an early 3k and one dc, you'd get 1k chase points. you have to do certain actions to get a pip or double pip. for example stopping the generators doesnt give you many points but it helps you pipping.
---
Im gonna be honest, and give full allowance to downvote me, but...
---
I did this lately, as Leatherface. Sorry little Quentin, but your Team shouldn´t have done the last two gens whilst i was chasing you
---
Groovy
---
Thats why I made my suggestion, which would fix all problens you just described, exept for the single game beeing ruined. We can add getting a bbq stack, I like that idea.
---
Pretty sure they do it to flex, its such a dumb thing thats been going on lately. Everyone screaming the word "Mains"
---
It's usually noobs that use that word
---
Reminder to all pc players that you can turn vsync off in the dbd config folders and it makes skill checks x400 easier to hit! :)
---
Yes, I've been able to easily find people with them. They've lasted over a year, I'm just upgrading to the hyperx cloud alpha, it doesn't come with an adapter for 7.1 surround sound but without using the adapter the way drivers are made helps. I only recently had some crackling when the cord moves but thats because I didn't get an adapter for it and didn't always use the USB 7.1 Surround sound adapter that came with it and I was resting the controller near my stomach when I used it always. That's why I recommend using the adapter that comes with it or getting an Lshaped adapter with it that lets it not go into your stomach and bend. Pretty much when I used it the cord was in a constant U shape where it connects because of how I used it. Build quality is good and you also get earpads to swap out if you need something more comfortable. I bought an Lshaped adapter and am getting the new headset tomorrow, it was $6.99 for 3 of them.
---

---
you win this time
---
That transition from map to map during the blink on to the top of the hill was some of the most beautiful editing i've seen, good job
---
I originally thought this was made because of the Death gardens death... rip
---
Yeah, theres definitely wtf moments when i play PS4, like the marker literally showing up on the skillcheck area already due to framerate lag
---
OoO, if used properly, it is more annoying then anything. The survivors have your position constantly, if you try to go for them, everyone else gen rushes and body blocks, even if it means sacrificing themselves.
---
M4
---
And both are being ran by a Doctor also running Unnerving and Overcharge.
---
I also dont have a problem with it because it isn't "unfair" in my eyes. It just increases the punishment for messing up. (It also makes for some funny situations for inexperienced survivors such as myself when I get clapped at the gate while tbagging) . Ruin on the other hand completely stalls the game. Since neither me not my friends can consistently hit great skill checks, so we have to hunt this totem down or tap the gens which is annoying. It just makes it so nothing happens for 10 minutes.
---
Really isn't but ok.
---
I wonder; at what point did this subreddit become people's diary?
---
Astro a50s
---
- I find survivors because I hear them
---
I’d rather they do gens than hide in a locker when the killer isnt anywhere near them..
---
you can go back to super long lunges and busted dead hards if you like. Or you can be patient and wait for them to perfect the dedicated servers, which aim to be smoother than the game has ever been.
---
Although i do think P2P should be reserved as a fallback if the main servers fail
---
the killer mains killed u man, but seriously if I haven’t teabagged or flashlighted once the whole match and the killer DCs that’s on the killer for not just taking the L. I’ve had too many pussy ass killers unplug their shit and cause me to get no points for the whole match bc they decided to chase me or my friend for 2+ gens and those assholes deserve a message. always kicks me back to main menu when they do that so I fuckin can’t
---
Hey I played against Scott Jund once and he was using nurse with only bamboozle and he he decked my entire team and I so don't bully me
---
theres so many things wrong here
---
You wiggle, you die, simple as that
---
They indeed are earned differently.You get them with level ups.Not in the blood*market* anymore.
---
So yeah, teachables may not spawn there actually.
---
But how else would you teach your perks to other characters?
---
I don't use headphones personally, they give me headaches after 15 minutes and I've never liked the feeling of having my head constricted like that. Earbuds are right up my alley though, and I use JLabs 'Epic Premium Earbuds.' yes that is literally the name of them. They're on sale for $30 right now on JLabs website, they usually go for $70. The audio quality is fantastic and the directional awareness is stellar. They're plastic with a hard aluminium cover that keeps them pretty safe from damage. 
---
To give a general idea of the audio quality, I can usually hear a Survivor's pain grunts from on the opposite side of a jungle gym tile, regular breathing I can usually hear from a few meters away.
---
Insert obligatory "Doing gens, you?"
---
I play on console. I couldn't find a skill check on console, and so I used the "space bar" for it.
---
rank visibility is going away anyway so I doubt matchmaking is much of a concern anymore
---
Day 4 looks fun
---
hol' up
---
I get it these suck but i think it evens out in the end, you get totems like these but then you also get totems hidden in the damn shadowrealm that you couldn’t find even with a rainbow map and small game.
---
I would instantly main Dean
---
I don't care about my Reddit karma lol the only ones right were saying toxic is bad, the rest just are exactly who I was talking about in my OP.  Salty killers who can't hold the L.
---
Only Steam/MS Store on PC
---
I don't think you're fully emotionally stable to handle competition in a continuous sense. You can obviously handle the game and play it to the point where you enjoy it, but constant stimulation seems to be too much for you at this point. Usually those that have some form of diagnosed anxiety syndrome experience this quite a lot, which means competition is a huge turn off for them.
---
You definitely won't, m8.
---
Even the best legion in the world is going to struggle to do well against mediocre survivors.
---
Yes. It never came to consoles.
---
That would be a mistake, letting me MAKE one
---
And this is why I find the hex totem and wait until a chase is happening before I destroy it... it adds more excitement to the game and of course the reward of altruism points. "It's ok buddy... I got you... here let me heal you too..."
---
And from then on they're a generator buddy... they don't know the betrayal that came to pass in order to get to this point
---
Because it’s fun.
---
Oh sick the new survivor gets a motorcycle in game that’s super fair and balanced
---
Easy counter to ds: chase the bloody unhooker. FFS he had make your choice, it shoulda been clear what he shoulda done. Plus, he barely utilised his shock. Didn't bring up their insanity, and didn't once successfully utilise it in a chase. He's whinging because he played bad.
---
Ok cool
---
It'll bring you toxic tryhards so you're no longer allowed to have fun, really. There isn't much benefit for anyone not solely concerned with their ego.
