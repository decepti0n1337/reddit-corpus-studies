 90% of all claudettes i encounter are complete potatoes and dc half the time for absolutely no reason. They‚Äôre so bad I‚Äôve never really been able to see them as toxic
---
---
---
Iron Will is one of the best perks in the game. It's not niche at all.
---
It's the Grineer.
---
"Darkwing SC" ? No, I am also just "Darkwing Dork" on steam.
---
Yeah actually it is have a look xD Either one of us could be right we'll just have to wait I guess
---
All I see is Daddy Myers in the corner. Did... no one else see him? 
---
&gt; But I got to know, why should a Billy that dick-rides BBQ/Chili and Hex-Ruin get the same amount of BP as a higher skill-cap killer like the Nurse or Michael Myers? 
---

---
Because if a Billy is using BBQ, they're probably not camping, which is the #1 reason for REEEE'ing among survivors. 
---
Nobody: \*insert Freddy joke\*
---
I was thinking something similar but be able to teleport into the smoke. That would be bad ass.
---
I seriously try to derank so i don't have to hit 1 again, and it's harder than ranking up üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Make fun of Legion I suppose 
---
lmfao 
---
You people disgust me
---
Personally, if they did implement a totem counter, put it on small game. Killers need a perk to see how many dulls they have, though granted it's only useful to them for NOED. 
---
Putting it on small game would also make it less of a perk unfairly called a "meme perk".
---
I honestly don't know, but I'm hoping so.
---
Look at the bottom of that thing he's holding, looks like one of those ridged honey scoopers.
---
I'm looking at something not remotely close to Egyptian architecture. 
---
But we already got Jeff duh
---
That would be pretty cool
---
Can we get a gif of delivery boy Dwight doing the Spider-man "Pizza Time" please.
---
You're not even that close to the next phase yet. What she's doing is fine
---
The original argument is that Legion has no counter-play, when there's obvious counter-play. Spread out, do gens.
---
The argument in the video is "Legion is skill-less because they chase consistently." ignoring that the game is hardly made up only of chases and also ignoring that even in that very video there's perks that counter Legion's Frenzy in chase, like Sprint Burst, and that Legion can't exploit their movement speed to cheese windows and pallets like Spirit can, which means Survivors are hardly at a loss for agency at all times within a chase against Legion.
---
This is just another example of the community latching onto something and making a big fuss over it for no reason. Legion is a low-tier killer with less map pressure than everyone but Freddy and, maybe, Trapper.
---
Rest assured, she very much hates you too for even trying with that pallet. 
---
This would only be true if she allowed him to go into struggle phase
---
&gt;Lol, so repeated flash saves just are annoying. Ok.
---
Flashlight spamming and flashlight saves are two entirely different things, should use the correct terminology. Also there are many ways to combat this, especially with the pick up time being 3 seconds and blinds taking a second, flashlight saves are ineffective unless you're a flashlight god and the killer is pretty brain dead. Also lightborn makes flashlights take 3 seconds to blind the killer, meaning having lightborn makes this basically impossible. Also also you can spam the drop button to negate the flashlight save, this method is so effective I actually thought it was a glitch because it looks like it. Flashlight saves are just annoying if you know how to handle them lol.
---
&gt;With no disrespect, That‚Äôs utter bullshit. The only perk that can heal you is adrenaline and surprise, most people who have unlocked run it.
---
Adrenaline doesnt just heal you though, it gives you a pretty long speed boost, and you don't have to take about 20 seconds for adrenaline to activate, self care takes more than 20 seconds with sloppy butcher, making it very time consuming. I believe gens take 90 seconds to complete, you're wasting 20+ of those seconds on healing when you can be wasting much less by healing with your team. Also it's not a problem with swf. If you are in a swf and youre running self care, you and your team is wasting time.
---
&gt;Which is what the majority of killers are, except trapper, Michael, leather face/hillbilly
---
Slugging is a play style. Literally any killer can do it, it's kind of funny you say Michael and hillbilly wouldn't slug much considering those two killers have tons of reasons to slug, and often do, Michael being his tier 3 is on a timer and hillbilly because he has tons of mobility and lethality. Also trappers tend to as well when it comes to someone falling in their traps while someone is on the ground. 
---
&gt;That‚Äôs when ds kicks in.
---
That isn't a problem with unbreakable, and again, there are ways to combat ds you just so happen to have conveniently skip over when I've explained them
---
&gt;I do, I love Michael and I‚Äôm about to prestige him.
---
Why even say this? As if you prestieging Michael all of a sudden makes you a god killer who plays killer a lot. You literally said you were a survivor main.
---
&gt;The edgy LoL GeT GuD retort. You are not a killer main, no killer mains would say that. Begone thot. I bet you are a prestige 3 Claudette in disguise.
---
I didn't even say git gud to be edgy, I said it because it's the truth. There are so many killers who expect to be served a golden platter of sacrifices, when in reality killer does take skill, and if you don't have any skill at killer you will complain about things you do have control over. I'm a killer main, do I really have to pm you my progress on all the killers to prove that? I'm actually really close to having them all p3 level 50, I just need clown, spirit, and legion.
---
You clearly have a thick skull and I don't know why I'm going to argue this because it won't get through  
---
If you bothered to read what's bannable and what's not, there are 2 things that pop out here, 1) holding the game hostage, where your new argument is "everyone" can get into it, and "Exploit bugs, errors in design or **undocumented features** to gain access to what would otherwise not be available or to obtain any **competitive advantage"** 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
what's your argument now? 
---
Please do. Nothing will happen
---
Egyptian priest üòã
---
YES
---
I would like that!
---
Actually thinking along the lines of black/blood pope/cardinal, due to the jewelry on the hand.
---
Killer power that makes you instantly fail a skill check right as you run in to help someone with a generator.
---
Ebony moris make it extremely easy or even ivory ones.
---
That sucks. We have to wait until after it's done to even think about getting Jason in the game.
---
This sounds bad but, play scummy.
---
You won‚Äôt have meta perks (1 maybe 2 at best) so you might need to play like a jerk to get the kills needed. Tunnel off a farm, dribble d strike users, queue dodge swf, all that stuff.
---
Waiting for rank reset can help too
---
*Cheers in ad mortem*
---
I take it you currently main Hag?
---
This is how I feel. Every single time. Thank you for this blessed OoO meme.
---
I see that üëå
---
Well I'm pretty Sure it Will be a female.
---
 If the next killer Will be religious, Then the survivor probably Will be aswell to connect them
---
Don't know about their ethnicity but if they wanna add something else it Will probably a latino or a indian
---
Just my guess
---
Yes, the guy is an idiot.
---
I just want a big tiddie survivor

I saw this and knew I should have posted it, darn

---
Aight one of the teachers posted something.
---
Lol yeah, I went back and skimmed through yesterday‚Äôs stream and found it. Unreal...
---
It'd be more of an anti-loop thing, I would assume.
---
Dying Light pairs well with Remember Me almost exclusively. And even then I'd argue that it's simply too time consuming to tunnel a particularly skilled obsession.
---
Don't tell Mr.Aziz
---
Jen pretty much exclusively blocks the sketchy ping lobbies. Besides, I've seen Zubat play against an Omega-blink Nurse and he's said "nothing I coulda done" and expressed negative opinions about the build. But he must be a hypocrite because I see him using Omega-blink all the time. 
---
I guess my point is that's it's pretty easy to be a hypocrite in this game lol
---
Honestly if Legion was a buff shirtless man no one would want a nerf 
---
Honestly I like to do this sometimes but when survivor teams t bags the ever living shit out of me then I had enough (had Laurie t bag me whenever he dropped pallet, vaulted or do literally anything she did say that I played well after that so that‚Äôs something)
---
Killer Power: The Comfy Chair!

Scariest game ever for the survivors

We here at Entity Realm use all natural ingredients to make a fresh, oven hot pizza. But delivery is a new service we have added and are still working out the kinks, please be patient as we definitely our delivery methods
---
You didn't pay attention to the video then? He specifically says the spread of survivors isn't important when the most effective way of downing a survivor as the Legion is to tunnel them. 
---
We're sorry, but the promotional offer for Entity Brand Pizza is 30 minutes Utes or less, we apologize for any confusion
---
This particular Zubat game he is talking about was in yesterday‚Äôs douchebat stream. He purposely plays like a dick aka ‚Äúreddit kiler‚Äù, I‚Äôve seen Scott do it too and hell even jen did once also. The fact the guy used this as an example is to bash her is pretty stupid, how do you watch the stream and not know what‚Äôs going on. Even in the little writeup thing it was advertised as douchebat day!
---
How about since the DS change we take away noed from a totem and have it as an infinite perk after gems are done. Oh wait it was like that when it was released hence why it is a totem now. Stop trying to change noed right now it is way more balanced than ds is currently 
---
Caps at 24 meters I believe
---
Not sure about the others, but with Freddy it's not a bad idea to try to slug the last three survivors once at least one person is dead. 
---
I usually do this to the last person if the hatch is close.  
---
Killers power: create a fog to blind survivors!*

Here we go again, Freddy v 3.0

I WON'T GIVE UP!!! YOU WILL TAKE MY FRIENDSHIP EVEN IF I HAVE TO DOWN YOU 115 TIMES!!! AGHHHHHHH!!!!
---
It's actually the other way round I'm not bothered what the killer is I'm just stating facts but you're getting fussy over nothing. Some Egyptian structures did have those arches I think you need to stop making out that if someone doesn't agree with you then they lack knowledge even though they're presenting facts..
---
And there's Leatherface . . .  For his BQChill
---
... Then the hatch opened for you too 
---
r/UnexpectedTF2
---
Does not smh mean ‚Äúsomehow‚Äù?
---
Snake cultist?! Conan confirmed.
---
But the whole reason for the basement is a high risk, high reward system for the survivors and a safe space for the killer, putting two staircases would destroy the purpose of it almost entirely. Besides, I don't think I've ever seen a basement with two staircases anyway :p
---
No survivor would run this perk with that crazy downside
---
Yes thats what i did, i typed his line into google and it spat out the wiki quote for the definition of a strawman. You are right!
---
Damn your post is not just cringy, its also dumb.
---
A wider patrol is more feasible allowing for more interesting gameplay. Face camping or standing 2 meters away doesn‚Äôt and is obvious to the other survivors that may try to save. 
---
Think of it like an unlimited ranged Prove Thyself that only the killer can activate. 
---
Remove the downing part with a cooldown timer for healing then I quite like the idea.
---
Sure, why not. 
---
Why do you think she‚Äôs a witch?
---
Damn rank two on xbox, respect

Yee he's underpowered.
---
I would swap Freddy with doc, and move legion up one tier
---
You can't whine that something is game breaking when it's not actually breaking the game.
---
When you say cheap what is your price range?
---
Literally hooked right next to a Claudette about and hour ago after running the spirit around for three gens. You‚Äôd think she‚Äôd save as the killer left immediately but nope, the wall needed some attention I guess. David saved me and I blocked her in until she healed me, then she turned around and faced her corner again. I got off shortly after that and took a nap lol. 
---
TEAM ROCKET IS BLASTING OF AGAIN^N^N^N^N^N^N^N^N
---
Imagine if the smoke is active and the hand sticking out is the ONLY indication if the killer is actually near you. Might make this game actually scary again!
---
Auto didact but on roids
---
Also alternative idea
---
Agonizing pain: it's just a dlc code for freddy
---
Cannibal (hopefully obvious)
---
Spirit (all three perks are quite good) 
---
Hag (1 is amazing, 1 is good, 1 is bad) 
---
Pig (2 are very good, 1 is bad)
---
Nurse (1 is amazing, 1 is good on certain builds, 1 is situational)
---
Clown (1 is very good, 1 is decent, 1 is forgettable except on doctor)
---
Hillbilly (1 is amazing, 1 is decent, 1 is forgettable)
---
Doctor(1 is amazing, 1 is good, 1 is very bad)
---
Nightmare (2 are very good endgame perks, fire up is pretty forgettable)
---
Legion (1 is amazing, 2 are okay)
---
Trapper (1 is very good, 1 is decent, 1 is bad except on doctor)
---
Shape ( 1 is good, 1 is decent, 1 is bad IMO)
---
Wraith (2 are too replaceable, 1 is shit)
---
Huntress (They're all dogshit)
---
I didnt move legion up one simply because iron maiden and mad grit are pretty lame
---
I'm so terrified and yet strangely aroused.
---
I always assume that when they teabag after pallet drops, that they are asking for a face camp. Can anyone confirm if this is the case?
---
You get a free wish now.
---
Please delete Legion.
---
Legal reasons. 
---
yea, shitty games like that are a bummer overall. I've had my fair share as both killer and survivor, overall I just wish players were nicer and all 5 people just wanted to have GGs, but the world isn't perfect unfortunately.
---
lol yeah i did, his main point and the point of the other video he did, and what he says on stream is the power is poorly designed and it removes the value of being a skillful player. 
---
There are plenty of videos form other top tier players who just topkek when legion is the killer in their game and they also state the powers stupid and ill conceived, but they don't have a problem going against him. So who do you wanna believe? He's a lot better at the game than me, monstrously so, but there are other YT/Tw killers who frequently voice how Legion is built poorly needs a total rework but have no issues going against him.
---
Billy also has 2 pretty weak perks along with enduring but you still put him in b tier
---
Last person always gets hatch. I make sure of it. 
---
By standing close you can get a grab which is an insta down and a free hook along with the guy you already have on the hook
---
I'm actually not of the mind that Legion is gamebreaking. They are terribly designed tho on multiple fronts 
---
Lol
---
It's not so much that he can be overpowered, he's just simply unfun/boring to go against.
---
Downvoted for lack of relevance to thread. No one disagrees that they are an issue.
---
For me it's when chasing someone else :c 
---
Yikes, the fog we have is temperamental enough to the frame rate. Adding more effects to it might blow up my Xbox. Would be cool, though. 
---

I would main dwight for this.

The Ken the drill killer from Slumber Party Massacre 3 would be a great idea.
---
Honestly, I feel like something kinda needs to be done about the ranking system.  Cause it seems like it's more about how much you play than how good a player you actually are.  I'm saying this as a rank 1 who's admittedly pretty shit at the game.  And it's disappointing because once you get into the red ranks, it's not fun to play anymore.  And I don't deserve to be there, I'M NOT GREAT!
---

Here. You **need** to report them in game as well.
---
i see onions on that pizza
---
it was ruined to begin with
---
onions are the devils testicles and dont belong near anyones mouth 
---
play as un fun as possible to the survivors. I used frank's mixtape and cold dirt just to get the adept legion trophy because i couldn't stand playing that many matches with him
---
The dynamite would be used for zoning and easily breaking pallet stalemates.
---
Yeah that was the idea of the killer exactly your supposed to use the power to push people away from loops and stopping pallet loops 
---
The survivors at the end who will taunt, or allow me to down them when I have NOED so they can DS me while their friends work on the totems are not the ones I've hooked before. I don't think I've ended a game with 0 hooks since I was new to the game.
---
I don‚Äôt have time to Pallet teabag because I‚Äôm standing there doing math equations in my head to find the perfect way to juke them when they break it only to get fucking #THWACKED immediately
---
Spies from the shadows II 
---
Cowabunga it is
---
I would actually be interested in seeing a video of them body blocking a killer into the corner! I would think they could just get hit and knocked down. 
---
Ahh, I actually didn't know that, but I redact my joke anyway.
---
yeah hes boring af to go against.
---
They already have permission to put them into the game, I wouldn't see any problem with them providing free cosmetics even if they are liscenced.
---
YAAAAAAAASSSSS
---
I think it's literally ONLY because film makers feel that would turn off way too many movie goers, and come across as a really cheap emotional jab. It would also make a lot of people hate Michael Myers, rather than have this knowledge that he's evil, but still cool as a movie character.
---
It definitely means more for killers than surv
---
I mean if you don't, you are probably gay.

I think it would be more interesting if the one of the perks had some kind of use with fog, and thicker fog had some tangible benefit, maybe a counter perk for the survivor end (kind of like stridor and calm spirit). Seriously doubt it though
---
no it was a 2 survivors and killer bodying me
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like a streamer so you shouldn‚Äôt like them either‚Äù
---
Shoutout to all the killers who give the last survivor a pity hatch after completely stomping the entire game. 
---
And girls gosh... sexism 
---
You can like whoever the fuck you want but when a obnoxious streamer like her gets choosen and others like monto dont there is a problem
---
cant tell if blind
---
Did you get banned from her stream and are salty or something? Cahla is a respectful, knowledgable player. Seems like a good fit for FWs. 
---
I know the Dev.  He also created Franklin's.
---
I feel it‚Äôs fairly easy to counter noed, if you have a problem with it bring small game find all the totems and break them all, while your doing this have a friend run prove yourself to do gens with the third survivor and the fourth survivor (if you want) runs leader and follows you around making you cleanse faster
---
I'll take one shirtless Jeff, please
---
We were supposed to be getting some, but haven't heard about them in a while...
---
Honestly, Myers is one of the few killers that actually scares me.
---
Because it‚Äôs so hard to just not use feral frenzy until they throw down the pallet 
---
Heh, as one of the more vocal people against early camping/tunneling, I actually never do this. I'm against preventing people from being able to play the game at all, I have no problems with winning.

Yup, no idea if it‚Äôs a male or female killer...just hope not both!  Looking at you legion hehe 
---
This gets talked about every single day for the past 3 years since the game launched
---
Yes I do. David King is my only P3 survivor and wears all black security cosmetic. I remember your name, just not the games we've been in.
---
None of the other killers has a power that activates only when they swing their weapon, all of them have a separate activatable power. I'm not saying that their can't be some kind of effect tied to his basics attacks, but if there is it's most likely going to be a secondary attribute of his ability. Like how the Pig has her traps as her primary abililty, but then also has her crouch, or the Doctor has both his Shock Therapy and his Static Field.
---
If his swings have some kind of special effect, than most likely he will also have a different ability that coincides with it.
---
Maybe if it‚Äôs so well thought out and might connect, IDK. ü§î
---
Ahhh the secret weapon!  Not smoke or light but flying cats! 
---
the devs already stated they aint touching noed 
---
Why does David‚Äôs workout partner have to be white? ü§î

Spies
---
Anxiety attack: you hear the killers terror radius no matter where the killer is located.
---
Depression: the entity forces you to be sacrificed on your 1st hook.
---
Straight white male: while injured the killer sees every other survivors aura for 5/10/15 seconds. When this ends, or you are healed, you suffer from the exposed effect for 20/30/40 seconds.

 I didn't mean when the killer swings the weapon to hit somebody that the power would activate, I meant the killer could hold down M2 and start swinging it and spread some type of fog or gas around. So, essentially, the weapon has 2 functions - the regular swinging and lunge, and then the power, which are separate from each other. Sorry for the confusion.
---
You don't see them in Hot because these posts are useless and get either removed or ignored
---
The only problem with Dwight's leggings is they literally gave him no bulge. Unless that man meat is super tiny.
---
don‚Äôt be a bitch
---
Well if they're anything like the huntress they could be either lol
---
Alright. Clearly we're at an impasse. I explained my opinion, you explained yours. While your facts are correct, I gave my reason for why I don't think they support your argument strongly enough. If rebutting you is whining then I'm not sure we can have any kind of discussion without projecting. All I can do is offer my reasons as to why I disagree and that's all I have done here. You can read my intent however you like.
---
Just DC and move on. You could have made back those points and more in those 30 minutes. I don't care if you want to say "it's about sending a message" because they really aren't likely to care. They will just move on and do it to another killer. That's the harsh reality of it. 
---
‚ÄúThey did many crusades, some of which almost didn‚Äôt fail.‚Äù
---
How does that make him less powerful?
---
I‚Äôve seen a couple DBD streamers complain about this map specifically. Pretty sure it was broken on launch too. 
---
I think you mean shirtüëèüèºless
---
Okay I got you but also.. why not?
---
Right? They gen rushed and it was like, why am I even here. Go play your own game.
---
Please... S T A P
---
I mean i guess the wraith was hungry but you did not deliver the right pizza. What was his order @Vipdad ?
---
Why‚Äôs that?
---
monto is obnoxious too idk what you‚Äôre on about 
---
I would buy it if it were really like this. 
---
Looks cool
---
While I understand that, the statement of the post is still geared towards whether a killer that is marked as easy with mechanics that match it should be given the same BP for a killer that actually takes skill to play.
---
I played her in alpha I know they have her model finished I always have wanted them to release her as anew character I loved her look
---
I'm sorry but new Pizza Boy Dwight delivers pizza in the worst way.
---
I should dig up the thread of this dude who would weekly order pizza and just carry it under his arm like a briefcase.
---

Just a fair word of warning, you can climb up there too. If you walk against the short side of the rock, you can jimmy your way up there. Best thing to do is down them and then slug them for 4 minutes if you really want some petty revenge.
---
Don't know why the devs didn't just put up an invisible wall or something...
---
I don't really know how this stuff works but maybe a match history isn't implemented because it's not possible without dedicated servers? Cause otherwise I can't see a reason for it not being a feature at this point 
---
wdym?
---
The Yarn Ball:  All those years heading sheep and and turning their wool into yarn have helped you create things both beautiful and resourceful. 	
---
Activate-able Perk.
---
Standing within the Killer's Terror Radius while not in a Chase for 45 seconds activates the Perk.
---
Once the Perk is activated, press the Active Ability button while crouched and motionless to throw a yarn ball, which silently creates a nearly invisible trip wire 10/15/20 metres away. When a killer crosses the line, you are able to see their aura for 4/6/8 seconds. 
---
Tier 3 of this perk stuns the killer for 3 seconds. 
---
The Perk deactivates once it has been used.
---
I would definitely have crocheted clothes and scarves on. 
---
How did you manage to make the game look like this?
---
Possibly an eldritch angel killer? 
---
That would be really cool but I doubt they'd do it. It looks bird like so maaaybe a plague doctor? They carried around incense burners.
---
Y'all will hate me. I had a game yesterday where I stomped(one dude even called me a hacker lmao). I was originally going to hook the second to last survivor rather than slugging and hunting the other, but the other survivor came up tried to flashlight me. So naturally I dropped the first survivor and chased the one who tried to flashlight me. Hooked her and went back to look for the first survivor. Turns out the hatch was super close by and I could hear her groaning. Eventually I found her lying in a bush 5 feet from the hatch. I picked her up, walked directly to the hatch, waited there for a second, and then walked over to the hook and hooked her. It was incredibly toxic, but man did I laugh hysterically.
---
All of the emperor perks 
---
True this new chapter looks good but will we see Freddy reworks.
---
Did you miss the announcement for them coming in the summer this year...?
---
&lt;/3
---
Wow... that reminds me of starting this game..
---
Did he already get banned on the Switch?
---
you're confusing IMO and TBH
---
That outfit is wack 
---
Lol if you played well and didn‚Äôt be toxic me as a killer main Is more than happy to give you hatch :D just don‚Äôt be a toxic boi and your ok I play nurse and I feel back when people dc so I give the hatch a lot lol
---
You guys are missing the most obvious one
---
"Hi I was hoping to check in"
---
"Check in? but you've always been here"
---
"Excuse me?"
---
"Oh I'm sorry I though you were my husband , You must be Legion I hope you had a pleasant trip, FASCIST"
---
"I beg your pardon?"
---
"*System of government categorized by extreme dictatorship,* seven across"
---
"Oh I see actually it's fascism"
---
"Fascism, wonderful, now we put you in the basement suite Evan will escort you there"
---
"Oh I think I can make my own way down, HAG"
---
"*Evil old woman, considered frightful or ugly.* It's 12 Down."
---
"Ohh, Bless you"
---
I thought this one fit since the trapper (Evan) wears a similar looking mask to legion, plus the hag bit was just too funny not use
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt think we don‚Äôt need a perk to help prevent camping as it‚Äôs already not that good of a strategy and there is no way to stop the people who want to do it. What we need is something to make survivors less salty about being camped. Something along the lines of: while you are hooked and in proximity of or in the TR of the killer you get 1-2k objective points for each generator completed as a base ability. This way if you are being camped with 5 gens left the game is still worth something.
---
All for it if I get to play as Nicolas Cage.
---
Doing that to survivors always gets a good laugh
---
I've been making killer recently but I play both heavily. 
---
Flashlights are a pain in the ass. Not many people on ps4 are good with them, but a good, toxic swf group with flashlights is dreadful to play against, borderline wanting to dc. 
---
Ds is getting nerfed. I think the nerf is a bit much but I'll decide when Its available. 
---
Self care already has been nerfed and takes a long time to finish. There doesn't need to be a counter to this, any killer who's even slightly capable of tracking won't find self care an issue. I honestly find that it's one of the best balances to the game. 
---
Deliverance has a healing cooldown so it's actually very balanced. Especially with killers who proxy camp, you can't heal so you're an easier down for them. Pair that with the new d's version idea tho.. That would be a bit of a run around. 
---
Unbreakable is once per game, if you don't slug they can't use it. If they do, it's once per game. Enjoy the bit of extra chase points. 
---
I've had games as a killer where, especially with this broken match making right now, I barely even hit anyone. Once no ed is active though, I can get three to four hooks in two minutes due to the survivors ego exploding, or them freaking out not knowing what to do (20-15 rank mostly). It does need conditions or cooldown, something, at least until you get it third level. First level should not be unlimited downs, second shouldn't either. 
---
Yep.
---
The only time I do this is when I get dcs, if I stomp them really bad Ill still go for my 4/4. 
---
and Wraith plays cowbell
---
I feel like Rank 10 and 9 has more than Rank 1, Rank 1 players don‚Äôt really talk.
---
You're sick. 
---
Jk if the killer brings a hidden then their desperate for a 4k so most survs know there will be no pity hatch. 
---
This guy has no idea what he is even talking about, the devs aren't balancing the game around themselves. There has to be a better video going over the legion than this.
---
I‚Äôm dying here that‚Äôs amazing. You‚Äôre in the same position each time, too lol. Also.... crouch man. Crouch lol
---
pizza was right but i didn't finish the match in 30 minutes or less so thats probably what happened :)
---
We stan killers who give the hatch
---
What they said.
---
What they said. \^\^\^
---
My favorite thing is carrying a survivor to the hatch, dropping them, picking them back up and taking them to a hook.
---
Only to 180 and go back to the hatch and let them go
---
This is a horror game, get spooked bois
---
Dunno why you‚Äôre being downvoted 
---
What he said. \^\^\^
---
Your DCs? 
---
No he's back on PC
---
Oh, I die plenty. I've been hovering around rank 8-15 survivor for a while now. 
---
I just prefer to survive over sacrifice 
---
For me they need a reason for it.
---
Hahah no such thing as crouch you must always RUN 
---
Can you spare a coin for the infirm?
---
They are.
---
I wanna see floating gold rings in all maps. Missing rings let's you know where survivors have been. 
---
I broke my bumper purely for this reason 
---
Tbagging definitely does not communicate that sadly :( just best to keep playing, killers know we get bullshit hits through vaults and we get bullshit stuns or misses when its unfair, in chase we just take it and carry on, but tbagging is seen as disrespect like 90% of the time.
---
‚òùÔ∏è
---
**OH NO DR CONNOR'S CLASS**
---
On Xbox it shows progress but I guess it doesn‚Äôt on PS4.
---
Omfg really? This dude just won‚Äôt stop..
---
you'd be surprised how many legions still use feral frenzy next to a pallet. I however, respect pallets so it's not usually a problem
---
Yeah if theres a chance the killer might give you the hatch and no chance you can wriggle free, DONT WRIGGLE, better to submit than to challenge an ego :p
---
the survivor is gonna be the guy from dusk
---
I walk over the hatch to the hook on the other side of it XD 
---
as someone who uses legion when farming bp. this was such a good image
---
Can't wait for the DS nerf. No more having to face a fully stacked team's four DS.
---
Then mori
---
OP weighs the same as a duck.
---
On the Mount Ormond Resort Map. It just says Legion.
---
Ive had 3 games where the wraith would just sit afk in his cloaked mode. Really really weird. Probs just derankers.
---
This would replace their current power. 
---
Like naked Dwight!
---
I'd play DbD every damn day if it meant a shirtless Daddy Dwight skin. üòç
---
Oh, I think you mean Photoshop.
---
I call lockers closets so I can say that the survivors come outta the closets a lot 
---
I will continue to be nice.
---
Smash it with my foot like I always wanted to
---
Shoutout to the people who don't even play the game
---
yeah you totally shouldnt have gotten downed once - whats wrong with you? :)
---
I personally don‚Äôt dc because of maps, but lerys and the game can be seriously obnoxious 
---
I think it's a combination of both of those things and pre-existing shitty behaviour gone unchecked. I've seen some of these people act the same in other games, too, so it's not just DbD. I just think that DbD attracts all of these shitlords. BHVR doesn't really do anything to deter them, so they know they can get away with it.
---
You know, I‚Äôve never thought to do this. Going to next time I get a worthy survivor.
---
Mostly because noed can‚Äôt pop when you get 4kd with two gens left since everyone was wandering around looking for totems that had been cleansed 
---
Me coming out from behind a tree to finish the gen the killer just kicked 
---
There's nothing funny about this story. You, sir, are a monster.
---
People really out here acting like this ain‚Äôt legit 
---
It‚Äôs time to stop
---
COLOSSAL OOF
---
Damn Meg looks super Sexy üî•üòç
---
I‚Äôm sorry bee bee 
---
I know that technically all of them are about he same size but I‚Äôve always imagined Dwight had more of a belly
---
He lacks alot of things a good killer has and he is definitely the easiest to bully and in rank 1 he needs some insane shit to survive 
---
Ruin and NOED tho?
---
I am a killer, after all.
---
I don‚Äôt have good perks yet, the next map I bring ruin and dying light.
---
Educacional
---
Really sad to see you downvoted out of the conversation for telling people to stop being salty their teammates don't play their way.
---
Legion is fucking dumb: your intense hatred for this stupid ass killer boils over and you bash his pussy high schooler head in instead of letting some 5‚Äô8‚Äù 150 edge lord with a pocket knife stab you to death. 
---
5 totems, 1 os ruim, Found one, clease it, it's only 15 seconds of your time.
---
Solaire!
---
One is ruin
---
&gt; touch yourself without other survivors
---
Lmao
---
‚ÄúWholesome‚Äù cause he played by your fake rule set. More like pussy
---
Shoutout to the people
---
That means staying on the map vs a fast as fuck killer with an insta down on their m1
---
Laziness-gain stacks when not moving. Each stack can make you conplete a skill check without even hitting the button.
---
Idk about any others.
---
Yeah gonna have to disagree on that last part. Inciting your audience to harass the devs is absolutely not the correct response in any situation, it just makes you come off as entitled and immature.
---
Yep, and as a killer you 100% have to actually *live* the part
---
Praise the sun 
---
He gon' carberator tuning guide dat ass.
---
Claudettes love hiding right next to the hook. 
---
*Mo Bamba ominously starts playing*
---
Why were you recovering there?
---
I'm a method actor.
---
*laughs in Nurse main*
---
I think it is pretty fine as is honestly, but if there had to to be a change to it then I would say it should only be effected on those who  had already struggle PHASE. The perk is literally called no one escapes death. Not kill all survivors regardless of how good you or them have done. 
---
Although that's a bad idea in the current meta, keep in mind that a huge tenet of DbD's design is about affecting the possibility space. Meaning that each match isn't only affected by the killer/map/perks/addons/offerings that *are* present in the match, but also by the one that *could be* present. The killer doesn't have to be running Spies from the Shadows to make you nervous about setting off crows, because they *could* be running it. The reworked Decisive Strike will incentivize killers to not go after the unhooked person, even if no survivors are running it that match.
---
So even if there's a new killer that benefits slightly from thicker fog, it's still beneficial for survivors to burn fog offerings, because there's such a small chance of getting that killer. But it will no longer be an automatic benefit, and the choice will require a bit of consideration and anxiety. And DbD is supposed to be a horror game, so a little bit of anxiety is a good thing.
---
This community deeply worries me. 
---
I played against a streamer doing exactly this to me right now! Wow. Then I remembered seeing this post today and well, Hi. In the Endgame chat he said I was deserving it because I camped someone as Leatherface and other sweet things.
---
Nothing like not knowing who the killer is, then randomly setting off a Hag trap. 
---
Gender Equality pls.. one each side
---
Look, i'be clear as day now,are you ready? Here we go:match started, you found a dull totem, you cleanse It,600 bp plus - 1 possible NOED totem, all your friends do the same and one of you found a second totem,cleansed, no NOED on that match.
---
Each totem takes less than 15 sec to be cleansed.With one minute of game time, no NOED on the game.
---
But the killer is OP!!! Ever heard of playing stealth?i know right?, it's Crazy!!! It's a New strategy, not many people know about It, but try It, i'll like It.
---
Got the idea now ?

Zero evidence and all hearsay but it won't stop the internet gossip train.
---
Overcomplicated:
---
No matter how simple the task, you find a way to do it less efficiently and more convoluted. Generator, healing, unhooking, and opening times are increased by 50%
---
Pent up anger:
---
You throw down pallets with a little extra spice, pallet stun time is doubled
---
Detriment:
---
Cause everyone around you to move 2% slower while you gain a 1% movement speed increase.

---
It ear rapes me as a survivor when it kicks in is what it does.
---
Buy the two before dying light, then go for the Mori. Once the entity appears, buy dying light. Then you should still be able to get the mori
---
Shoutout
---
The lack of Hispanic characters is starting to get a bit weird.
---
They've got 7 Black characters, 2 Asian characters, and 40% of characters are female(counting Legion as both). So they don't have a problem with inclusivity, other than this one strange oversight.
---
I like that they are called "teachable" because that implies the Killers gather together and learn from each other how to sing lullabies, apply clown make-up and grill bbq.
---
ok
---
It worked, thank you!! 
---
Iron grasp.

with his shitty music playing as an outro LMAO

---
I actually thought that it was pretty good. There are a few scenes from Michael's perspective which were interesting to read, and it goes into more detail about Michael's childhood and his early years at Smith's Grove, but it doesn't overdo his backstory like the Rob Zombie remakes did. 
---
The book is hard to find, but there's actually a digital copy floating around somewhere. I might be able to find the link.
---
Oh
---
Isn't this the point? Their just trying to cram in a little blood points before the game ends while leaving the killer a way to end the game? 
---
Tits
---
Well this killer would hunk he‚Äôs serving one in this case the entity 
---
Not to mention, who said the others would help anyway? What if you kill a SWF guy and they INTENTIONALLY throw it for you? There's no trusting randoms, they may make legion 100% worse to play
---
Let's give a quick shoutout to [Christina Applegate](https://i.redd.it/7q2n7tgdtso01.jpg)!
---
I meant if another survivor is hooked then don‚Äôt do that. So you can get the save without the killer chasing you out
---
Give me the shirtless trapper
---
That is very true. Happened to me yesterday but the second the totem lit up and I ran for it, that damn Pig rounded the corner at the same time and downed me. Did manage to destroy the NOED and escape though so I'm not mad. 
---
I got anxiety watching this lol.
---
Smells like the plague
---
I usually give people zhe hatch when somebody DCed
---
He definitely does knowing he got dat saggy booty in the pizza delivery pants üòì
---
Holy shit
---
YEEEES
---
I can tell you who I don't like to see - David and Jeff.
---
Davids because they will farm you every chance they get with WGLF and Jeffs because they utilize his Aftercare perk as a convenient sandbagging tool. 
---
I love this 4 panel of Jamie Lee Curtis so much, and honestly? WIG. 
---
delete you from existence, he means. call the police mate you're being threatened online
---
I did this like 10 times in a row on Haddonfield, I think he was just letting me have some fun, and I did
---
his power doesn't help him other that being invisible and when he tries to hit someone he has to put them to sleep and give them time to get to a safety pallet or a vault
---
Stop! You've violated the law. Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence. Your stolen goods are now forfeit.
---
Maybe it was more of what he saw within the legion? 4 people who could pass as survivors, each seemed to not only enjoy what they did, but THRIVE at it, and 3 of the 4 have a huge hive-mind like mentality. It sounds like free work, hell even the Legion themselves seem to enjoy what they do time by time.
---
I love Haddonfield as Trapper
---
It's fine by me as long as the girls get to be shirtless and Quinton does not.
---
Also killers, we want equality for everyone accept Quinton cause he ugly as shit.
---
He is literally the only killer in the game who's power doesn't help him chase survivors in any way. He gets a little bit more time to chase people down because of how his power slows the game, but he has the worst chase potential out of any killer.
---
Just looking at the other mid-low tier characters: The Trapper can cut off escape routes and instantly end chases with his traps, the Wraith's power gives him mobility and allows him to get closet to survivors before they know he's there, Leatherface can instantly down survivors if he can get his chainsaw off, The Pig's ability allows her to get close to survivors and gives her some outplay potential at certain pallet loops, the Doctor can prevent vaults and pallet drops, and I don't think I need to go into any of the other killers.
---
The fact he gets no out of chase mobility either just hurts him even more. He has a hard time getting around the map, between objectives and exit gate, which wastes a lot of the extra time he gas built in.
---
25% bleed meter is almost impossible to reach unless the killer deliberately leaves you on the ground (like I do with Deer Stalker to prevent trapdoor exits) to bleed out to die. 75% on the other hand, is fairly high because if the Killer doesn't hook you right away, it gets accumulated.
---
40% 50% 60% sounds better imo.
---
I‚Äôve had situations where I accidentally hook the last survivor right in front of the hatch. I pick them up and go to the nearest hook and then I hear the wind and I‚Äôm all like oh sweet lord this is goooooood. 
---
Fair enough. I seem to be doing pretty well with him so I was wondering what others had to say.
---
This happened to me two days ago. Everyone disconnected but me (server issue most likely) and the killer doqned me but dropped me in the hatch. I'll never forget, thanks random Doctor in PS4 match.
---
It also wouldn't be so bad if you consistently got okay to good teammates- but somehow it feels like Rank 20's get into my games and literally never touch a gen
---
He's not faster than any of the other killers. He moves at 115% speed, which makes faster than the Spirit, Hag, Legion and Nurse, but all of them still have higher mobility than him due to their abilities
---
Fair enough
---
Today I got post game salt from another survivor bc I was hiding near the hook waiting for the killer to go away instead of going right after he was hooked...  the killer was literally running around him... 
---
#: )
---
Because he has to wait 7 seconds before he can interact, your doing well now but there will be a time where a survivor team will literally just triple team a gen in your face and you won‚Äôt be able to stop it, or a gate will be open and they‚Äôll just un hook right in front of you. 
---
If only there was some kind of button for that.. ü§î
---
The hook body blocking you mentioned isn't a problem for Freddy because he doesn't have collision while the Survivor isn't in the dream state. In fact, Freddy has a better time against body blocking than most killers.
---
I agree with this. Lullaby can have uses even though the other two are absolute garbage. If argue all wraith's perks are all garbage.
---
My group of friends call the shack that‚Äôs in all the maps the F shack. 
---
I'm guessing that's what it's like at rank 1?
---
Hahahahahahhahahahahahahahaahahgahahaha
---
For the wraith !
---
Uh, no. They were working together, so they could communicate with each other to warn each other when I was heading toward a generator so they knew how much time they had to keep working on a gen.
---
I also ran thanaphobia and had all 4 of them injured for a large chunk of the game but they gen rushed through it without healing.
---
So funny they start too at so confused I did it to a guy and he found it hilarious too because when he found me we just stared at each other for like 30 seconds before he ran at me
---
When running from her, you need to keep looking back at her and look at her hand. If she's preparing a hatchet you should *NOT* vault windows and put down pellets as it will kill you. 
---
Try to put a sudden unexpected action every 3-4 seconds when you run if she raises her hand to throw, leading her to miss. An area with many obstacles also help as she suffers to throw over fences and such.
---
If she happens to run out of hatchets, she suddenly becomes one of the weakest killers out of all for her slow base move speed and she is forced to either finish the pursuit with a lower move speed / break the chase to go for more hatchets in the lockers. Which also takes time.
---
Not a very constructive comment, what parts do you disagree with and why? I've got about 700 hours logged as killer and this is just the conclusion I've come to so I'm willing to listen to what you have to offer to this discussion and I'm willing to open my mind to what you have to say.
---
amen
---
unleash the dwulge
---
Did tydetime make this one too?
---
I‚Äôm curious to know why you think so highly of Hex: The Third Seal.
---
That's valid! I completely agree. I only went down so low to 25% thinking of all the times I'm able to crawl away only to have to wait to bleed out.
---
Said it before will say it again: Just because 2 out of 14 Killers are unfun doesn't mean that the devs can't make a good one. The fact that more than half, yet alone **86%** of the total Killer roster is at an acceptable state is truly impressive.
---
P.S. Don't give me shit about how "durrrr only Billy and Nurse are viable at high ranks." I'm not talking strictly about Killers being strong or weak, but rather that they're fun to play and play against. Freddy and Legion are both not fun to play against, and while I know some people enjoy playing those Killers the general concensus is that they're unfun to play as well. Every other Killer in the game offers fun and unique gameplay and can appeal to a specific person to be their favorite Killer to play.
---
Okay well maybe except Leatherface as well. :^)
---
Also if you think Billy and Nurse are the only Killers who are viable at Rank 1 I'd suggest trying Spirit, Huntress, Hag, or Myers. :^)
---
I have never once had a killer give me the hatch oof
---
I'm glad you've had success with the perk, but honestly I find it to be harmful to my tracking, maybe because I don't have enough time spent with the perk but when I used the new version I just felt overwhelmed by alerts - but I'll try to log some more hours with the perk and come to a conclusion instead of basing it off of the 3 games I played with it on.
---
It's still extremely disheartening (and quite frankly, a time waster) to see someone run up and insta-drop a hook and be able to do literally nothing about it. Not to mention that Freddy now has to go search for another hook, which he might not make it to before the survivor gets off his shoulder.
---
A button of an up arrow that lets you give the Reddit user some points? Perhaps we could call those points "karma" or something?
---
I would love an old Laurie alternative. 
---
It'll be literally impossible to use it unless the killer decides to tunnel; it's basically a non-issue now except at end game (as if survivors weren't powerful enough at the end game).
---
A perfectly symmetrical pizza...this must have been the guy that showed Bryan Cranston how to throw a pizza on a roof.
---
That‚Äôs too fit for Dwight imo but yes to the idea 
---
Save the Best for Last is on my S-tier, but it's at least A-tier in general, at least for m1 killers. I didn't realize just how much the stun time after successfully hitting someone was hindering me until it was basically removed with STBFL. It's so good.
---
Bail your friends out? I bail your life out.
---
Jackass 100% deserved it. I always try my best to Kill Survivors who try to kill their fellow Survivors (either by ratting them out, sandbagging them, or farming them on the hook.)
---
I'm not gonna lie - it's just a guilty pleasure perk for me so I put it up there lol, it feels like a better knockout and it sometimes takes the bullet for ruin.
---
They Clown, for some reason has the ability to travel from realm to realm, he‚Äôs also favoured proven by the fact the entity has allowed him to keep his horse. 
---
no but I think he made your very constructive comment.
---
Jake Park=Jake Paul
---
It's like forcing survivors to not loop as they'd end up running through the smoke after a single rotation. 
---
I thought they made his sleep work better, rewarding him for having multiple people slept at the same time?
---
Except for the fact that it's revealed to survivors as soon as they get a single skill check, and it doesn't do anything until you stack it. Ruin is good because it does its job as soon as the game starts, and devour hope is decent because it isn't revealed to survivors until they're already exposed, lullaby just feels like a pipe dream in comparison.
---
It's not faster than tapping if done optimally.
---
Optimal gentapping takes the same time as missing ~4 great skillchecks, it's very unusual to get less than 4 on one entire gen.
---
To gentap properly you need to keep M1 pressed for exactly one second, that's the 'no skillcheck window'. Also you should reduce to a minimum the time between 'taps', but that is ping dependent, if ping is too high you shouldn't gentap.
---
You can tell you are doing it right (if you are the only one working on that gen) because you'll get exactly 20 points for repairing 1 second. If you get more than 20 points you can get a skillcheck, if you get less you aren't optimal.
---
I swear 50% of people who try to gentap just hold M1 for a fraction of a second, making it completely useless.
---
He was already rewarded by having multiple people in dream they never touched him 
---
2016 &gt; this happens literally every other game, all killers except for campers are cool af.

2019 &gt; WELL THE GUY 5 GAMES AGO HAD DECISIVE AND HE TEABAGGEFD ME EVERYONE DIE!!!!! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE &gt; +693 upvotes from this subreddit.

Tinkerer really ain't that weak, and lightborn is still ok, it kinda gets completely trumped by franklin's most of the time though
---
I really like bloodhound. I don't think it's a perk for good players, but for bad players it's a godsend cuz it's so easy to track people once you hit them.

We can choose how we react to your borderline cunt-decisions mate, sorry for not following your made-up rules on how we should treat the poor ol killermains.
---
She seems in a state of... shock
---
&gt;Something is wrong here: At the begging of each match, any hexes that the killers have are revealed to you/two survivors/all survivors (for x seconds? Not sure about this. Would be a cool way to deal with NOED)
---
That seems... strong, like it might gut hexes strong. Maybe all active hexes so it doesn't get everything? I mean, if hexes didn't spawn immedietly, then maybe.
---
&gt;Clean-up: Destroying a dull totem gives a token. For each token survivor has, gain 1/1.5/2% (numbers can change) speed on all non-movment (pallet droping, vaulting, lockers, unhooking) based actions.
---
So, what happens when another survivor clears all the totems, have you got a useless perk? 2% seems potentialy low in that case.
---
&gt;Intuition: Each time you (or another survivor) see a hex-totem it becomes revealed to all survivors (you?) within 48/60/72 feet for 4/5/6 seconds.
---
So, if you see a hex totem, everyone around you can see it's aura for a few seconds? So what, if your being chased then the other survivors can go clean it up? Thats... actauly kind of cool, the range seems a bit big though.
---
The whole pregnant survivor idea is... unique, I'll give it that. Gotta do something differently eventualy, otherwise every survivor is just the same.
---
Spies should be higher after its buff
---
Nice.
---
I don't like the whole killing infant thing and I play killer mostly.
---
‚ÄúWhen you play like a cunt for no reason gibe upvotes pls‚Äù
---
I'm gonna wager there is gonna be a map element for the new Killer, and survivors need to disable/destroy it ASAP like Totems but on steroids.
---
Like maybe fog flowing from Censers which will probably buff the killer when active.
---
We call sb hah u thought bitch, and ds fuck u cunt , or at least thats what we say when we use them 
---
  
---
But there aren't people you care about, so thats all cool?
---
Sorry, I'm not trying to put down how you feel here. I just find it an odd line to draw.
---
Don‚Äôt be disrespectful to thiccccc Santa 
---
yeah but you have to break chase to use it which I don't like, useful against urban evading groups though I'll give it that.
---
Spies and bloodhound on the last?bamboozle low aswell, its a must for every M1 killer. Not a great list imo
---
Frames have been in the games since the Halloween chapter iirc, they usually appear in houses on walls around pictures.
---
a fair point, maybe I'll just make a "You're a cunt tier" reserved for insidious and dying light lmao.
---
Spies is useful on nurse in a chase 
---
He was distracted resetting his trap, I'd say that's pretty fucking useful
---
I contribute to discussions, this isn‚Äôt a discussion. It‚Äôs you shitting on those that disagree with your opinion.
---
I think blood trails are perfectly visible without bloodhound and spies I don't have much good experience with, will be revisiting the perk - bamboozle is properly rated, it's not a top tier perk, it's not a shit perk - it's just a fine perk9.
---
The guy didn't say anything unfortunately, but one of his friends(I think they were SWF but not sure) was full on raging. Insults, hackusations, the works. He was really salty about one (admittedly pretty dirty) long-range lethal blink I had on him. "You couldn't see me! You're a cheater! I'm reporting you!!!" etc. I don't even remember how I saw him, but I remember thinking at the time, "ooo he's gonna be salty about that, I can feel it already." As it happens, he was indeed salty. This game is fun.
---
traps should be more lethal imo 90% of the time i remove the trap is in first box i check
---
Y‚Äôall are weird but I‚Äôm into it
---
What's also funny is when you do 4/5 gens, unhook twice, and get hatch...then the 3-man SWF group you got matched with blames you for not getting the 5th so they could all escape...um, what? 
---
Haha, when people can enjoy seeing others rage and not get salty themselves is when this game becomes less salty xD keep up the good work mate
---
Not all that much. Everyone was chosen by the entity to challenge the trials I am just saying why bring a infant/unborn child into it. Unless the entity tries to take the child and raise it to well I have no idea but that could be more interesting
---
There's no evidence there and I never watched ochido before his ban but if it triggers all the salty killermains here than he must be doing something right (but I'm only mad about him being a pedo, trust me - dumbass killermains like you) so I did start watching and I'm pleasantly surprised, you're giving him the tyler1-treatment which if I'm correct in 3 years or so Ochido will be unbanned and casting some tournament sitting next to Mathieu Cote.
---
Shitting on them? No I'm legitimately asking for their input, I'm sorry you happen to misconstrue that as shitting on them.
---
Same.
---
Ooh i have a few
---
Trapper is trappy Daddy
---
Wraith is Mr Bing Bong
---
Hillbilly is Robert (some kid was supposed to guess killer names and called him Robert)
---
Huntress is CoD
---
Doctor is Zappy Boy
---
Urban evasion is Urban immersion
---
Good drawing ! 
---
Keep riding 'em, cowboy.
---
no I generally kind of felt they fitted F tier, except spies - I do need to give that perk another go since I didn't really give it a fair chance, I know I overrate third seal and I probably knocked insidious two ranks too high.
---
Tell me about it..... i had a match today where i kept unhooking all the survivors and i did 3 gens, and no one did anything because i had empathy and i could see that no one was healing/getting healed/doing generators. They were all just walking around injured. Next thing i know i walked into a trap and i got snatched and hooked. Surprise surprise no one comes for me because they start running all the way to the opposite side of the map until i start struggling. Someone finally starts running towards me from the other side of the map and then obviously 4seconds later my meter runs out and i die. So frustrating. They started running towards me when i had a handful of seconds left. I'm over it though but i just really needed to let that out lmao
---
IMO it might be the other way around. I'm almost new to the game and have some difficulties tracking marks and blood on the ground and the Crows make it possible to continue where I left off.
---
It also might have to do it being only tier 1 for me as the small range gives me significantly less alerts (compared to tier 3).
---
I just find it useful on Myers as his terror range is at 1/2 most state and lets me the chances to land surprise attacks.
---
Okay so bmomo64 also asked me for nudes guys and btw i'm a 14 year old girl, I don't need any screenshots of him doing it or any actual evidence just my personal statement should be enough, that's how it works right? 
---
I've seen some videos and streamers utilize the perk really well but in the ranks I play at the survivors don't really do gens together.
---
sabo is so bad lmao why tf are you crying about it? 
---
PTB is probably Tuesday since the reveal stream is Monday.
---
Actually released? 19th or 26th
---
Why do you think that whispers should be lower? Its one of the best tracking perk in the game id you know how to use it correctly.
---
well what in F-tier do you disagree with? 
---
If you play Legion "optimally", then they are the *most* consistent chaser in the game by far. After Legion lands the frenzy hit, there is nothing the survivor can do to outplay the Legion, because the Legion will get a second frenzy hit, break chase while still following until the deep wound timer goes low enough that yet another frenzy hit will down the survivor. And nothing the survivor does will help them. Vaulting is useless, pallets are only useful if the Legion is dumb enough to run into them while in frenzy, missed attacks don't matter to Legion, etc. Survivors most definitely lose almost all agency in a chase with Legion, at least after the initial hit is taken.
---
The killer is just very poorly designed.
---
I wish
---
Oh no! Please! Don't ban my reddit acoount!!
---
I have 7 different prestiged survivors, am i still a killermain you triggred fanboy?
---
I think you mean you found ochidos fake account
---
Also sorry if this seemed demeaning - I'm genuinely curious I'm trying to put together a list that can help newer killers out or people returning to the game.
---
Already shirtless
---
still up in the air as for where it belongs, will be doing further testing on it.
---
Well Nurse is infamous for that, considering her high-rarity addons are usually considered bad...
---
It was a game with high rank friends (me at 17 they all at 9) so we all got matched against a 10 Nurse.
---
It was the fitst time when DBD actually felt like a serious horror game when almost all other times it's a thriller / action. I learned how to loop / evade  from my friends but I couldn't do **anything** against her (like wtf are you supposed to do when she blinks right behind you and *grabs* you not *hitting* you).
---
Woah. This guy sounds badass 
---
This is giving me some serious [Harrow vibes (warframe)](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSpu24cwOq09B9nSPXGQzFOpjT6J4IsYR-wdjpm6Uvu3PymvO5WWA).
---
I wouldn't be surprised if his ability was based around a more creepy side of religion such as Penance. But an ability based on his smoking thurible/censer could also be very cool.
---
That has been their MO in recent releases 
---
Slow the game down just a lil bit
---
Exactly! It's annoying that he does that, but the survivor runs off like nothing happens while Freddy has to sit there stunned for a few seconds. I have no idea how on Earth that bug and the bug where awake survivors can bodyblock for asleep ones haven't been fixed for all this time, but Huntress' bug was fixed in a matter of weeks. I guess it's because Freddy isn't top tier, huh, devs? I wonder whose fault that is.
---
True but one of those terrifying;y optimal nurses can honestly go perkless and just wreck house.
---
That doesnt stop me from nothing.
---
\*angry sigh\* 
---
(Of course, you mean this police - - &gt; https://youtu.be/OMOGaugKpzs
---
Sorry, I couldn't resist it: this song is about *stalking*..! XD  ) 
---
Not really. Now their friend gets to stay off the hook for at least a few extra moments, not to mention the fact that they now have more time to wiggle while Freddy has less time to hook them before they do so. 
---
Thank you very much!! :) 
---
Wouldn‚Äôt the survivors avoid this patch of fogüòë
---
She looks gorgeous! What program do you use if you don't mind me asking? 
---
Jumping in on this - there was screenshots in the video.. not sure how you missed it mate?
---
&gt; he doesnt do anything that is not done by any other survivor with more than 90 hours played?
---
Huh, I guess I must have miscounted my hours then.
---
In case it isn't obvious she's a blatant farmer here, this was the *second* time I downed her trying to farm someone in front of me. Hit her off a gen, she ran *literally across the map* to the person who was hooked and pulled her off with me two feet behind.
---
This time: Hook someone, go to a nearby gen. Sprint bursts away from me...right at the hook, again.
---
Some survs are just dumb as all shit.
---
Just imagine a centurion in DBDüòÇ
---
Well, there is. But the cup is not large enough me thinks.
---
Wtf do you think evidence means if not something that proves he's a pedo? You literally claimed you have evidence twice in a row and here you are with nothing but some fat girls statement who's also clearly triggered by her rejection. That and an angry mob of salty killermains, just salt oozing from every fucking hole in their body constantly who "agree with you" but also have 0 evidence. Again don't ever go on jury-duty if you don't understand what the word evidence means.
---
Dont agree with a lot of these really bit too many to comment on
---
I like having MERCILESS KILLER status after that lol
---
LMAO
---
It was all in all a fair match.  I'd let them have it if all their team DC'd, but I earned this one.  The last one alive was especially tormenting me; I had hit her a few times,  but them damn loops got her away all except for one time.  
---
Last week I went for my adept hag achievement and I was expecting Ruin or Devour to really help out but Third Seal is what won the game for me. It's stupidly situational and incredibly weak, but in the right situation it can be very good as an even stronger knockout if you need to keep people on the ground.
---
photoshop! i use kyle websters brushes, the goauche a gogo/gritty dry ones.
---
That's why you put it over gens. It would give good map control, find 3 gens near each other, put down fog, attack anyone who comes near. It would be like Doctor except you don't have to be constantly near the gens.
---
If it was a game with proper manners (no teabagging, pointing) I usually let the last go... *If I know where the hatch is myself*.
---
...Those people are people who say thank you at the end of the game for letting the last live and will write gg even if I killed them. Which is how the community should be. Respectful of others.
---
"I simply don't share your views"
---
This guy asked girls for nudes, even if not underage, still fucked up
---
Still, some of them were underage
---
That's what the PTB is for, It'll give us a chance to see if it's worth it or not. 
---
Some people like myself though don't really care, i dumbed about 1.2 million BP into legion the second i had him unlocked.
---
I'm sure most do, but i'm just trying to help any newer players who don't
---
Oh, well I'm sorry if I offended you.
---
*_offended_*
---
/…ôÀàf…õnd…™d/
---
adjective
---
resentful or annoyed, typically as a result of a perceived insult.
---
Yeah let's talk about how "toxic" he is because this pedo-thing is honest to god the most pathetic attempt at trying to get people angry at someone and it actually working because there are many fucking morons like you walking around who don't understand the word evidence. So tell me the worst toxic thing you remember seeing Ochido do?
---
Fair enough! 
---
Or they wiggle out in the millions of years it would take to do this
---
You know, I'm deep into this bottle, if I can level with you. I'll come back to this tomorrow, and I'll be super clear on it, if that works for you man?
---
Oh then they get the hook instantly. 
---
They got a small taste of Dwight's aura and turned-tailüòÇ
---
A lot of the time if I‚Äôm trying to sandbag someone deliberately, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre doing nothing. Had a game yesterday where a Meg who was 50% on the final generator stopped it and went to hide behind a wall by the hatch for a good 5 minutes waiting for me to die. 
---
I found her and tried to get her to follow me to a generator and she just kept running away. 
---
If I‚Äôm deliberately sandbagging someone, they‚Äôre usually doing nothing by the hatch. Doesn‚Äôt happen often and doesn‚Äôt pay off for me at all, but I‚Äôm happy to die if it means I get to sandbag a hatch camper and get them killed too.
---
Eh, an okay portion of them, but as somebody who plays maybe 50/50 killer/survivor it's definitely a minority. It didn't offend me in the slightest, it's just flat out wrong as your post just comes across as super edgy. This reply doesn't really help either.
---
That said, when you stumble on the people being toxic, they are *very* toxic.
---
Well [this](https://i.imgur.com/9nVMRqa.jpg) says otherwise
---
It's not a bee, not a moth, I think it's a mosquito. That fog-like thing is antimosquito smoke, survivors can collect it on a map to defend themselves.
---
No I've seen people actually defend him and think he was just mistreated except it was on Tumblr.
---
Can u delete this? It hurts my head
---
I'm not really a fan of the ambient lighting, so I'm probably going to stick to black_void
---
I normally only give hatch to players that gave me a close match like for example 1 gen remaining

"It wasn't until Francis' horrible barbecue accident that the Entity took interest in him."

Afaik ban evasion (and that only ONE of his multiple offenses), is against the Therms and conditions that everyone agreed to. Its probably enough to sue him

That 1 in 1 million games where it does anything at all?

God bless you, FOR I WILL NOT
---
Ok well for the bloodpoints would be the ONLY reason why I‚Äôd use bbq. I‚Äôve never used it tho because i never got the LF DLC. When I play survivor I always use WGLF tho for bloodpoints. I could only imagine how many BPs I‚Äôd get as killer lol I would‚Äôve had enough bloodpoints to max out every character by now 
---
This guy thinks like normal people and gets downvoted. Its funny how everyone thinks ochido is some kind of psychopath but in reality hes just having fun by teabagging and thats his style. His videos are funny and entertraining because he just trolls around and his kinda good player too. Most of people here are tru3ta1ent fanboys and like to hear him whine and cry about everything. 
---
Hi, I'm an amateur anatomist and I need to tell you that eyebrows don't grow over your hair. Similarly you can't just use your eye the same way you'd use your ear when you put that strand of hair behind it. The Eyelash just wouldn't hold it. Other than that it's a really nice drawing.

the real nightmare of Legion is teammates that spend 5 minutes in a corner self-caring every time they get wounded. 
---
DO A GEN AND MOVE
---
Dang lol. Well to your credit, nobody at the time knew how bad legion would get on so many levels. He just looked like a cool killers at first and then later on everyone found out how annoying he/she is
---
&gt; You know you just named the weakness of every killer in the game right?
---
Most other killers can apply pressure to the survivors in some way outside of just chasing them. What does Legion do? Downs 1 person they find after ~45 seconds, then runs around the map to try and repeat. There's a reason they're considered "Freddy-tier". All they can do is get consistent chases, they have nothing outside of that, and chases are hardly the whole of any given match.
---
You spread out, you do gens, then escape. Easy win every game I've played against Legion. This rampant crying that Legion is somehow bad for the game is awful when they barely even impact any given match to begin with.

You are right. Aztecs and mayans have incense burners. They look nothing like that. Christian incense burners look at that but there are a few Arabic incense burners that look like that too.

"How dare you play the game normally? Don't you know the DbD code? Try hard! Baby killer!"
---
They didn't even check around the vicinity? Lol what rank was he? 
---
GOOO!
---
All these claims yet no actual screenshots. That's why I believe its bullshit you would think one of them would have taken a screenshot
---
Lmao I do that sometimes but because I am a toxic killer because I'm tired of survivors. 
---
You should be glad. Easy 8k boldness. Git gud not complain
---
I want him to have multiple personality disorder. Which gives him the power to change mask and then change into that person. Once they are that person they have different buffs. One has more movement speed, one has higher breaking speed, one had better vaulting speed and one has higher carry speed for example. 
---
Basically, you can tag survivors to put to sleep without even knowing where they actually are, so long as you are in range of the survivor and their spawn point for your power. I am not positive whether a spawn is tied to a single survivor or simply tags anyone in range, but I believe it is the former.
---
Played against a legion once. Can anyone tell me the problem ? If they tunnel kite him and you wont go down (stun him during his frenzy)
---
It would be a good idea but if all it does is obscure with thick fog, would it really work on skilled players who know the maps like the back of their hand? Maybe as a passive skill for being near i'd hope for but skill wise it would worry me.
---
Except it happened the other way around? I brought up an argument and he said "stop being lazy then shit" (missing a comma, calling me shit or just messing up word order, dunno) so I returned the favor. I love people who can't even check in which order the comments happened, Reddit makes it really easy, give it another try.
---
Drop a person at the hatch, see them jump, interrupt it and then hook them :^)
---
This guy gets it.
---
When it's been so long that you've been at the bottom of the tier list and the buff has been so long in coming, that you have to resort to cool bugs to get any sense of relief. 
---
But jokes aside, this is definitely something that I will keep in mind for my matches. 
---
No, I meant what I said

Dwight shouldn't be fit, he should be a T H I C C B O Y E

Why Egyptian ? Christans, middle eastern, Hindu Egyptian and japanese cultures use these hanging burners. So far they made sure not to include a language wrote out. I think this is either a temple a church or a necropolis. I haven't seen anyone say necropolis yet. 
---
One side of this subreddit: Ranks are Worthless!
---
The other side: Look at how this game matched me against Rank 1's!
---
In other games the shitlords get shut down for having shit opinions. I think for DbD the mods have created a safe space for them where you can't really shut them down, not without being accused of being "toxic" and other nonsense and then banned.

This image... it's making me feel things!

why would you care about wasted cake if you are gonna avoid it on bloodweb or stack it in inventory anyway, just use it like any other bp offering and be happy when it occasionally works

Honestly i never fucking got the outrage coming from stuff like that. Am I happy seeing a claudette tbag me after she looped me for 3 gens? no. Is it reasonable to spam flashlight and crouch at exit gate when all 4 survs escape? no. But will it hurt my personal feelings, will it mark me for the rest of my life with psychological issues? Is it worth to wish a guy losing all his income for stuff like that? HOLY SHIT YES BECUZ IT'S 2019 AND EVERYONE BECAME A LIL FUCKING BIT**, MOMMY THAT GUY TEABADDED ME HAAAALP.
---
Seriously, please get your fucking shit together and don't get mad over something stupid like this. We're (mostly, not all apparently) adult persons with enough sanity to distinguish what matters and what doesnt, or should atleast. Or am I wrong again?
---
While the whoosh is gone I can still hear her footsteps and she still moves foliage/scares crows.
---
&gt;and then following you around waiting for you to down someone and carry them to that particular hook
---
As if SWF on voice comms isn't a thing, and them being able to tell each other "hey, he's about to down me, come by me in \[area\] so you can tap the hook you sabo'd earlier" isn't a thing.
---
It's not that it's about them not working on gens. Like I said, I'm talking about Freddy, who can only put people to sleep with his left hand, not being able to do anything about a survivor running up and sabo'ing a hook down right in front of him because his left arm is carrying a survivor. This is, obviously, *not* in his favor, because now he has even less time to actually hook that survivor before they get off his shoulder. There is literally nothing Freddy can do to stop that scenario, which is flat out broken. 
---
Also, calling a stranger on the internet dumb because they have a different opinion than you. **Yikes**. 
---
If you're one of those guys that doest touch gens and loop the same place for 26 minutes at least do the dull totens to avoid getting a knife in your ass
---
The proper Trapper response would have been to place the trap directly in front of the locker.
---
r/Iamverybadass ?
---
Hey thanks man 
---
When the hatch will be closable..oh lord tears will fall
---
Thats just lag 
---
Ok henny 1. That‚Äôs not a teaser trailer it‚Äôs the release trailer. And 2. This silent teaser is better than that whole video 
---
Weird flex. 
---
I rely on the audio mouse for my skillchecks because I consistently turn my camera and focus on my surrounding. Take away the audio and I cant do that and still miss the skillcheck if it's anywhere in the first half or the circle.
---
No really. 
---
Lol k
---
I'd just make none of the totems lit for survivors in any scenario.
---
That way they will often have to cleanse multiple totems to remove a Hex.
---
It'd be a much simpler way of buffing hex perks and would make dull totems more viable targets, which also means NOED is kind of nerfed.
---
As for BP, i think dull totems could give a bit more bp. 
---
Theoretically those players will get banned if they do it too much.  The threshold seems rather high before that happens though.
---
Every trap pop should be a free hit tho
---
Its only offensively stupid dont worry and keep digging. 
---
and the best part is if you're wrong and they aren't a coordinated team, you can always change up your strategy and let the tunneled player actually get a chance to play before their final hook.
---
Wait no one else does that?  Anyone?
---
Hahaha no problem, you sounded like me when I am pissed as hell. 
---
Let's sing a little while we haunt some survivors :P
---
I can sing half on the huntress lullaby I‚Äôm trying to learn Russian it‚Äôs good to meet people who I can agree with:D
---
Third Seal + Knock Out seems a bit redundant, maybe go Deerstalker if you're going for a slug build?
---
monitor and dead rabbit
---
He even said he doesn‚Äòt know for sure, which to me read as an implication/rumor. 
---
Tbh I agree with you. You should only say things like that if you actually know/have sources. Vague hearsay doesn‚Äôt help anyone.
---
Very cute. Love that face!
---
Didn't know this add-on. TY
---
true, but the picture was kinda vague to judge yet... As I said, I doubt it will be related to any active religion, but time will tell, I am happy to be proven wrong :)
---
Youd wish it was. But its only offensively stupid. Dont worry and keep digging, its passed into the territory where its fun to watch you, like a cringe compilation. Im glad you insist on doubling down, i actually made a screenshot of your search engine text, i was afraid youd delete it when it becomes obvious how absolutely stupid it is. Way to go and own up to it, little guy!
---
this would be nice
---
She is from the Whisperers gang. The Walking Dead reference
---
Tbh, bayu bayushki bayu are the only words I remember from the lullaby HAHAHAH
---
But the song sounds so neat and  "mysterious"... &lt;3
---
I didnt know about Ochido until his latest ban, Amazing how one man can get banned so many times.
---
There you go, buddy. A well deserved silver (I wouldve given you more, but Im cheap)
---
It‚Äôs the ban evasion I don‚Äôt like, they don‚Äôt want him playing there game anymore, but because it‚Äôs his main source of income he keeps coming back. 
---
I mean also keep in mind that Behavior tends to like the adage of make the problem, sell the solution with most of its stuff, so think of the killers power in the context of what is strong or screws over killers right now, and how the power could stop that,Pig Exists because anti Gen rush, Clown exists because Anti-looping, Spirit exists because Anti Mindgames , Legion exists because anti-Braining and so on, their perks tend to exist within the same space aswell of spefically existing to counter a issue,Down the guy giving the other guy borrowed time, Make your Choice, Really hate Sabo SWF, Hangmans Gambit, infinite vaults a issue, Bamboozle,Stupid gen at 99%,Pop goes the Weasel, Dstrike cause you pain, Rancor, Suck at getting through pallets, Spirit Fury, Really want to stop the gen rush, Discordance, have a unfettering hatred for Dwight, Iron Maiden^(or really want to stop survivor from countering BBQ)
---
*Wheezes in Clown*
---
I respect the honesty.
---
You say this as a joke but i kinda did like the idea of some sort of supernatural Hope on the survivor side, like its a perk where when you reach 50% health on the hook (just before struggle), a skill check will pop up, succeeding the skill check will cause the spirits of the killers past victims to float down, burning the entities claws away on contact, giving you a extra 25% health on the hook.
---
A lot of NOED users dont run ruin because they want you to gen rush.
---
They are done with the legal stuff. The devs said they don't want to work on the game anymore (they will throw some bug fixes and keep maintenance only) and moved to work on a different game.
---
And pebble
---
Maybe hiring a competent person to do the job would fix it instead of experimenting. Imagine that.
---
Experimentation is the sign of someone who doesn't know what they're doing instead of going through the network script, finding the issue and resolving it. 
---
Which is stupid because it‚Äôs a horror game lmao.
---
This. My modus operandi.
---
Make your choice isn't that great on killers with no speed abilities. I'd drop that and whispers for enduring and spirit fury.  Surveillance is good for gen grabs but not much else. I'd drop that for discordance, which is much better imo.
---
Try not to have any more than two traps on people at a time. Using them all straight away can punish you sometimes.
---
the bad hag perk is third seal right? i think the blind can be reaaally strong. at least if the survivors arent a swf group.
---
is pigs "make your choice" really that good? i've played a bit of pig recently and it didnt do a lot most of the time, because either i was still too close to the hook or they were hiding.
---
&gt;his fans are the survivors I literally don't even need to try against
---
If this isn't the truest thing I've read this week. You can be guaranteed that if someone is in the steam group "OCHIDO" that they can't flashlight save or loop to save their life. So many skilless wannabes. 
---
Even if they brought in an experienced guy, they'd need to experiment with it. You should relax and stop getting upset over things you're not too familiar with. It just gets you upset and you say foolish things on a public forum. 
---
It's funny you felt you had to specify not activated for the NOED.  Like you know what you're running and how we'd react on here lol.  Seriously though I would  pop off the training wheels if you're gonna do bragposts about your killer play on here.  
---
How much of a survivor has to be past the gate so the killer can't pick up?  Is it a fingertip, a head, torso..?  Just wondered as when I'm Killer sometimes I'm sure I should have been able to pick them up, but can't.
---
tbh the people who make cosmetics aren't the people who would rework freddy. I never get this argument of "stop making cosmetics and fix the game"
---
Confirmed: the killer will be a priest and the survivor is the nun.
---
Ufff üëÄ
---
I dont so. Although it seems comical some players really struggle in this game. I was the discord the other day playing with an SWF group and this guy was legitimately stuck at rank 14 for almost a year . He kept telling me how no matter what he does he cant get to the lower ranks and his gameplay...oh boy that was fun. Some people just aren't very good at the game or want to be. 
---
&gt;Instead of relying on your eyes, try relying on your ears.
---
This 100000x. Anyone trying to use a character whose ability causes them to stare at the ground for a few seconds is never going to reach the Nurse's full potential without making use of sound. Sound is the most important part of playing Nurse, IMO. 
---
Damn I dont have Spirit or Legion so Discordance and Spirit Fury will be hard to get
---
Thanks anyways though! 
---
Bamboozle B while Huntress' Lullaby is A ...?
---
I want sewers
---
I was hag once &amp; a Meg set my trap off, it nearly gave me a heart attack!
---
Your parents don't chek your reddit-history because they don't love you kid, they already gave up on your failed ass, let that sink in.
---
Even if it comes off as mature half of the DBD community was losing there saves at this point so i dont think it was just Noob but also general people upset so many lost their progress of incompetance of the devs and had no way to get it back. Doesnt help the devs never respond to the community unless were stroking their dick over cosmetics. I mean how many times have people played the PTB and gave real opinions suggestions and bugs just for them not to get fixed or sometimes ever addressed. Might i add the sloppy butcher wraith glitch is STILL in the game. Devs are definently not angels.
---
Nurse and..Nurse :)
---
Why do you always feel the need to white knight your gf on reddit lmao? 
---
And "douchebat" isn't even a good excuse. If it's fine for one killer to play scummy as "a character" or whatever then it should be fine for every killer to play scummy but she's gonna keep using mlga and keep blocking any killer that does something she doesn't like :) 
---
wall running prince of persia style
---
Better than the "proof" everyone else was givin
---
Don't worry I don't use those perks on Billy, but I'm still Billy though!
---
Play legion
---
I'm not a pro but Pig is my favorite Killer to use.    
---
I use Monitor &amp; Abuse, Whispers, Enduring and BBQ &amp; Chili.    
---
I personally love the combo M&amp;A and Whispers since you can get close to a generator and if Whispers procs you can sneak up to them and surprise them and sometimes even grab them of the gen Myers style.    
---
Enduring is just great to not worry about getting stunned by pallets and I can't bring myself to not use BBQ for the massive point boost alone.    
---
Ruin is obviously a great perk but I don't want to spend a perkslot for something that doesn't affect my gameplay. Also as Pig I don't feel I need it too much since the beartraps do a great job of wasting survivors times. (Also without Ruin there are much more activated timers and headpops :) )
---
Nobody gets the hatch if I can help it. I don‚Äôt hatch camp but if I can 4K. I‚Äôm gonna do it
---
Reminds me that before I took of DStrike a while ago I had a Doctor who gave me the Hatch because I hit it with Unnerving &amp; Madness 3. 
---
We Stan lovelies
---
Do your best to learn from it, in future if you come against it again you‚Äôll have slightly more knowledge. Wear the salty comments with pride my friend 
---
You may have had your crutch on too but they had more on.  The needles on top of the 4 ds is rough life.  Just move on you were setup to fail.  Funny they felt they could bust your balls for using No One Escapes Crutch though considering what they were using.  Theirs overall was so much worse.  Hypocrite survivors for sure 
---
Noed should be S tier for sure, but I despise that perk and don‚Äôt wanna give it credit. As for BW, it ain‚Äôt much of a game changer as it can be easily countered
---
Q&amp;Q and DWM is a very strong perk combo.
---
MY EYES
---
You don‚Äôt watch anime or other styles of cartoons do you? Lol
---
As an artist myself, it‚Äôs fine to learn the fundamentals, however, we each develop our own style. There is nothing wrong with showing the eyebrows or eyelashes like this. In fact, it makes the drawing style more cute in this case.  
---
If they were going for a more realistic or gritty tone, I may agree with you, but that just doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case.
---
So, I respect your opinion, but I must disagree. 
---
Cheers
---
Love your style, well done!
---
Should totally draw Feng min :) 
---
huh. but they were literally just requesting another person of color lol. how does that mean they're offended
---
Sure I could run small game but when I solo queue and do all the totems most of the time no one gets anything else done, that would only work for SWF
---
Yeah gens not getting done happens more often than you think but then it‚Äôs even better for the killer? I think NOED is a backup plan 
---
Thats pretty cool of you. I do get a little salty when the killer doesnt let me go and instead chooses to let the afk urban evasion noob go lmao i never bm the killer for it though. How are they supposed to know?
---
Whos next the Freddy Kruger? u/Vipdad
---
How dare a survivor genrush
---
Bye then
---
The only reason I say this is because it is really stressing the light and darkness aspect. Maybe makes parts of the map darker? or something like that (think the new moon/full moon bouquets or whatever). However I think to escape you'll have to light up candles or something. But you are right about the amanda and freddy thing. I hope they don't make another freddy lite without even fixing the real freddy :/
---
So crybabies like you can complain, no one forces you to agree so blow me
---
Thats the reason why I gonna use reworked DS much more than I used the previous one
---
Doesn't look like the important questions are being asked here...how much will this even cost? I plan on buying it when it comes out cause  I'm about to get a Switch. While it isn't advisable to waste money on this, it'll be money well spent to see how bad it is.  
---
If they're not toxic and had a rough go of it (people DC, bad teammates, etc.) I let them have the hatch it's supposed to be fun and if I've killed 3, I've had my fun
---
Alright. What's a good killer to counter swf? I used to be rank 2, but now I've ranked up due to not playing killer alot and sucking.
---
Yeah, i‚Äôm not throwing out the window that BHVR won‚Äôt sue him, they definitely will if he keeps playing. I have the screenshots from him too, if I need to post them. 
---
Slug, or bring ebony mori.
---
Slugging is so fucking underrated.
---
I'm not sure if this is grounds for suing but I sure as hell did not go to law school haha.
---
How did this become expected? Seriously, whose idea was it that by some bizarre honor code you have to let the last one go? 
---
soooo - you just read my last sentence and decided to ignore that i set the requirement that the game is in a state where it doesnt need the hatch anymore before that's an option? i see, typical internet user :D
---
It stated in the agreements that if you are hardware banned you are fully gone from the game and only the devs can change their mind about it. They didn‚Äôt, as he was perma banned on PS4, too. Now he is ban evading and covering his account on a NEW PC? That‚Äôs a sue-able case right there. 
---
Hangman's Trick F-Tier while Territorial Imperative is D-Tier?
---
Surveillance is below Shadowborn? Thanatophobia is above Pop Goes The Weasel?
---
These tiers don't seem very consistent, what did you base them on?
---
Alla till mig! stunned stunned stunned
---
I agree, there is strength in words, accusations thrown around with little to no consideration when you don't know what you're talking about can get people in more trouble than they deserve.
---
Yes, Ochido is an asshole, he inspires toxicity in the community, evades bans, exploits problems publically and teaches people how to do it, and he deserves flak for that, but I don't think throwing around accusations of pedophilia and such is a good idea if you don't have proof.
---
But why do you expect someone to intentionally lose score because you feel somehow entitled to it? 
---
His own likings
---
Skill
---
If it‚Äôs a proper swf billy nurse spirit and slugging is he best way to counter it. If you can hook one and slug another close by you almost definitely win with billy and nurse. Spirit is also good due to prayer beads. Slugging 1 to 2 people with someone on a hook wins you the game effectively. I‚Äôd say billy with insta saw  is your best bet 
---
At least non of wraith's perks are hexes unlike lullaby.  Unless you were doing impossible skillchecks, eveen then ruin would likely be better.  It is the second worst hex perk out there.
---
not to be *that* person, but MPD isn't actually real and is made up by movies and television to use as some entertainment illness.
---
i remember when i went to the doctor to find out if i had depression, they told me it sounded like i had a personality disorder. and so they asked me if i knew what that is. and i was like. "Oh yeah, i know of MPD". and they told me that MPD doesnt actually exist. that was. beyond shameful
---
Still referring to new/bad killers as "babies" in 2019...
---
Ummm... Ruin?
---
I got on this thread to say this.
---
If you play Killer consistently, and care about countering stealth, good headphones are a MUST. Especially for Nurse since she's incredible easy to stealth around. There's a reason Stridor is one of her teachables.
---
And here we can see the infamous "reddit killer" in its natural habit, watch as it calls people crybabies for disagreeing with them and insulting everyone whilst having a stick up there own ass
---
When even the Entity doesn't want you to play legion. 
---
I always take a green or red mori for SWF
---
That would honestly be amazing! How didn't I think of that?
---
I'm not kidding, if it worked that way it would definitely become one of the better Survivor perks in the game.
---
Me everytime omg 
---
I do kinda wish the clowns gets more maps on that tangent, every other killer tended to get their own unique map and tile stuff, Clown got Crotus Prenn, which i get the idea of the traveling clown, so then why has their not been clown versions of the other tiles yet. 
---
Shoot even just more maps for the tiles we have, most new killer only got a single map with their stuff, it would be cool to see another map for Gideons Meat packing planet, Lery's Memorial Institute, and Yakamota estate.
---
If you dont give a shit about what he posts you wouldnt even replied to what he had to say. There you just outplayed yourself. The man was just asking for opinions on how his loadout was, if you had nothing constructive to say, move along. There was no need to judge or mock
---
Yeah, let me just cleanse a totem in the middle of a chase
---
A HILLBILLY CHAINSAWED ME THROUGH A WINDOW I FAST VAULTED AND ALREADY RAN LIKE 2 STEPS WHAT THE FUCK DEVS 
---
New killer: the pope
---
Power: forces the survivors to complete a secondry objective (hideing proof of pedophilia in the catholic church) or else risk getting penetrated by his weapon.
---
we already got a ship- pale rose, factory can be considered the mcmillain state foundry, and church is the clown map
---
but yea cool suggestions
---
my other suggestion is the morgue of leries 
---
&gt;I don't think so
---
I think it's alright to be cautious and not get too excited because of killers like freddy and legion.  Sure they did some great work with the majority of the killers but i don't feel like it's wrong to assume the worst
---
Let me know if any of you want to see what happens next... I just realized that Nurse's kicked in right before I ended the trim. So there's definitely more of this game that was recorded.
---
By azura, by azura, by azura!
---
Why dud
---
Please don't think of OP as the standard reddit killer, I think we have a special case here.
---
If it's a 4 man Squadette chances are they deserve it.
---
But how you can't see, that by hating him, you are becoming toxic yourself? You call people who do not believe in evidence of him being pedo his cockriders and other insults. You would rather bring people that do not agree to the shit, then even consider they might be right. We might be wrong, I accept that. You can't just ignore Ochide. Every time he does something, so many people come to tell everyone about this, tell how they hate this guy, get some upvotes. You speak how you are tired of him, yet your attention to him is exactly why he will never die in this community. If you want to get rid of him - just forget about him. Don't feed the troll with your attention. Instead you give a fire to the hype around his figure - more people learn of him - some grow to hate, some start to support him - you insult each other in never ending loop... like, whats the point? You becoming exactly the same thing you hate the guy for and don't even realize that!
---
I know it's pointless in the end, but I can't help myself from thinking about how "Demise of the Devout" flows a lot better as a title.
---
Ok bootyavenger3
---
and yet you still got 15k. yup. killer bp totally isn't 100x better than survivor
---
Reddit killer that hates on Noed? Man you must be watching Rick and Morty cuz your intelligence is on a different level
---
Should i start save bloodpoints on new killer?
---
especially if it was a cute lil feng just trying to do gens 
---
All. Hearsay.  
---
And if there's evidence, you're not not wanting to show it.
---
shadowborn
---
Interesting, I did the exact same thing on 'The Game' map when it was my first time playing Billy and I literally massacred everyone without the chainsaw. I honestly knew I didn't deserve any of that so I let the last survivor literally wiggle out of my hands after I picked them up and took them to a generator. I *sort of tried* to practice how to even steer the thing and gave them the hatch.
---
i think it's because you called Ochido a god numb nuts
---
If the killer could also hear people, they would easily identify when they‚Äôre hearing someone‚Äôs mic even if they‚Äôre not talking, so that wouldn‚Äôt work. 
---
That wouldn't be fair
---
They have them in Egypt..
---
Hear talking. Not see mic 
---
rip my custom killer concept
---
They did have censers tho..
---
imagine liking the legion
---
 lol thanks :)
---
I had a two minute stand off yesterday with a killer who dropped me at the hatch. We both signaled ‚Äúno‚Äù over and over. Eventually I just caved and jumped in. 
---
I‚Äôll take the hatch if two or all three of my teammates DC during the match, but if the killer just straight up dominates then gives me the hatch, I don‚Äôt want it. 
---
Gorgeous!!
---
You do know he didn't get banned for being 'toxic' right?
---
That would be G fucking G 
---
I agree with you, reason i put the twitter was I went to try and find the tweets but i myself havent found it so ill edit it out.
---
Him being a creep on women is quite obvious but again as you said calling him a pedo without proof is rather harsh.
---
 Although if you think about it,  in actual court systems it relys on the same accusations which is why its so hard to prove this stuff, several underaged girls have stated he has asked for these things, but again Can't prove its real, or even if they are girls unless they stood up irl to prove it.  even in a courtroom of an actual hearing its practically impossible to prove something like this.
---
But you are right, it is harsh to be accusing someone of this and I, someone random on the internet, shouldnt be as it doesnt have an effect on me, what I said above isnt to be sarcastic or cruel just a if you think about it comment.
---
Hey that isn't slander! When it's written it's libel.
---
It's not something you throw out lightly, regardless of what you say after. Obviously Reddit isn't a workplace, but saying something like that in one can get you in serious trouble for spreading misinformation, even if you say that it's just a rumor.
---
Take a place like Reddit where people downvote this guy that you're responding to because he didn't make a negative statement about Ochido. These people will skim through comments and just read "Ochido is a pedo" and "he threatened some employee" then they'll spread that info, whether or not it is factual. Not trying to sound like a dick, just more or less agreeing with the previous comment.
---
thats a matter of opinion which you obviously may have. Don't see why you'd want the hatch over whatever other mechanic that doesn't encourage survivors to just abandon you once they feel its hopeless, but sure.
---
Hey! Beauty is in the eye of the beholder; just because you think Quentin is ugly because you have no taste, doesn't mean he shouldn't get a shirtless cosmetic.
---
Come on people, Quentin deserves [his speedo](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6a/07/22/6a07228f0a40a8ed519fb85e74a9b618.jpg) as a cosmetic!
---
first of all, don't call them low lifes. Just because they want to give themselves a good chance of winning does not make them low lifes, you are literally asking how to give yourself a good chance of winning soo.
---
toxicity out if the way,
---
deal with it until you learn how to play better (mean this in the nicest way possible) high rank killers don't seem to struggle against this so much. learn nurse potentially as she's much harder to disrespect. 
---
Look at the rings on both hands.
---
Why does going right back to the hook as soon as you see someone being unhooked a camping behavior? Isn't the survivor the stupid one for unhooking the other when it's clear that it hasn't been 10 seconds since the killer started to walk in a certain direction? That's not intentional camping, that's thinking logically and competitively to win by eliminating someone quickly.
---
If it's a properly coordinated team, someone will even go as far as making a lot of noise in another side of the map, forcefully drawing the attention of the killer (I had that done to me ***so many times***) and when it's confirmed he's gone, go for saving the hook.
---
You literally don't want the killer to play any sort of mind games, intentional or not do you?
---
Yea, as long as I play dbd I will always do that
---
You're on the internet asking someone for evidence. Google my doggie
---
no this is backstory for dwight, he ended up as an office worker cuz his dream of opening the first "Vertical Pizza by Bike" franchise didn't pan out :)
---
Oh I do that lol
---
Gone up against that once. I died.
---
Well the first one needs the red addon, I dont like builds how relay on red addons. Wich perks do u use? 
---
Devout should be put at A and NOED should be S. Not to mention you put STBFL and Rancor so low.
---
I do it for the deviousness points.
---
That you know of.
---
The whole team is extremely hypocritical, sadly. They do a lot of things as a killer that they complain later, when facing same strategies as a survivor. Instead of acknowledging good plays, they just use sarcasm to belittle certain plays. 
---
I am very curious to see what will happen when people will start noticing it and acknowledging it en masse, asking legit questions. I just want to hear the excuse. Because for now it's just seems like a lot of bs to me. And I don't like bs :/ 
---
There is literally a recording out there of him saying "I'm going to rape you" in spanish, he keeps evading bans (which at this point I believe should be punishable since he's making money off of something the devs clearly don't want him to make money of), he's (allegedly?) harassed underage girls for nudes which given the mentioned Audio above I don't even doubt and he promotes exploits and unsportsmanlike behaviour.
---
Why is this guy popular again? Because of ear destroying Audio Edits over mediocre gameplay? Amazing.
---
A huge haunted manor and or castle would be pretty dope. 
---
I DON'T GET WHY IT'S CRIME TO TUNNEL SOMEONE. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TUNNELED JUST MAKE SURE THE KILLER IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP. IT'S STUPID NOT TO TUNNEL SOMEONE WHEN YOU CAN ELIMINATE SOMEONE OUT OF THE MATCH ASAP AND THE SURVIVOR MADE MISTAKES OF UNHOOKING WHEN THE KILLER DIDN'T EVEN WALK 5 SECONDS AWAY FROM THE HOOK. 
---
And suddenly I remember why I took a mini break from this game. Dedicated servers cant come soon enough. 
---
It is if you arent in the killers LOS. 
---
Yeah, she's really lacking in the deviousness area so it can be a good boost.
---
I adore your style! It's so lovely. Thanks for sharing.
---
Spirit is definitely not S. It great with Enduring but by itself it's not S.
---
I main her and if only I am lucky enough to get a daily for her. I always get the Mori a surv with a killer that's level 15 and has no moris or achieve the dream chaser score event with the nightmare 4 times. 
---
That's how I get myself into character for streams and shit, I call upon the Entity to gimme that sweet sweet bell and then I stab people for a bit.
---
"He's a fuckin god" is a thing yelled from him in ytb
---
The survivor is just a child... Get it?
---
If the vicinity has some pretty large rock, you can totally get often if you run UE. I often do that when I play with my friends.
---
~~Which of course, educates me to search properly when I play the killer lol.~~
---
After her recent changes I don‚Äôt think she has a problem anymore just remember to keep using the ambush.
---
I don‚Äôt think so
---
*and don't tunnel*
---
Some sick mind games dude. Perfect timing.
---
No mither op w resi S M freaking head H. Genrush Op toxik Im calling boolihunters
---
Similar thing happen when I play killer and use the rare items burning a hole in my pocket. Huntress with no addons and non meta perks? 4k. Huntress with iridescent build? 0k depip.
---
Well main problem with that is at the rank I'm at Rank 6 if you try to go for ambushes mid game unless you're using it to mind game a pallet, you lost a lot of momentum.
---
yesterday i played a game as solo survivor with 3 ochido fan boy's as SWF. 
---
2 of them died in basement, 1 got downed right next to me as i finished my 3th gen so the killer decided to slug and go for me. To make it worse the last guy decided to crawl into the open looking for the hatch instead of making it possible for me to heal him.... i almost looped the killer long enough for him to bleed out but that didn't go well for me either. I ended up with 19k points they all ended up with 3-7k\~ points? and a very toxic end game chat where they said they would've fucked the killer if they tried. But lets be honest they probaly tried their fucking asses off to 360 the killer but failed horribly
---
When they said "she", they were referring to the Nurse, not the new killer 
---
I think it‚Äôs mostly about map pressure, using discordance and other similar perks could help you with that 
---
You're not going to hit them everytime even if they are placed in good places.
---
I‚Äôve got the black lung. Pop
---
I know how frustrating it feels to play solo survivor so I hope I made their day easier 
---
Hehe)

Appreciated :)

No the shoe fit

When is that going live anyway
---
I hope you guys teabagged the fuck out of this scrub
---
Keep acting like he's banned because he teabagged, makes you look very credible.
---
No I think they are calling them low lifes as they instantly went to name calling and profile commenting because they can't handle breaking all the totems.
---
Swim suit huntress, legion, and trapper and I will never ask bhvr for another thing in my life. 
---
THE POWER OF THE 420 IS REAL! KEEP IT AT IT. Or not. Whatever.
---
I'm not the best pig player but first let's go over perks, your perk build is pretty good, use whispers to your advantage. Whispers triggers at 32 meters which is your terror radius. When it triggers, immediately crouch then walk up to the gen nearby and stab em.Your perk build can be better though. Enduring is great( ds and pig has no reliable counter to pallets) so you're going to eat a lot of pallets. BBQ is amazing for pretty much all killers (blood points and tracking). Keep ruin because it's ruin and the 4th perk is kind of up to you but here's some good choices: nurses calling, save the best for last, sloppy butcher, brutal strength, make your Choice, bamboozle and many others.
---
As a pig player, your most important priority is to use your RBT wisely. If you struggle to keep map pressure, using your reverse bear traps early onis a good option. If you find yourself always in the end game, save your reverse bear traps because they're super strong in the end game. In most games, I suggest you use 2-3 bear traps and leave 1-2 for the end game. You have to assess your situation and use your bear traps accordingly. For example: downed a survivor when 5 gens are still up? Using a reverse bear trap is a good idea. Struggling to down people in a match and they're flying through gens? Save your bear traps for later. If you tend to tunnel the first guy you down, don't use your reverse bear trap on the first guy you down since you're just going to chase after them anyway so using a bear trap is pointless.
---
Her crouch ability (imo) is not super helpful except in the beginning of the game. It makes you slower which in turn affects your map pressure. You can however use it to mind game some specific loops and chases but it's overall not super helpful.
---
Good luck on your pig adventures and don't forget to oink! 
---
Have to mention to a budding Freddy player:
---
Range &gt; blocks
---
Contrary to what 90% of Reddit thinks, Blocks are overated as hell, and range saves you just as much if not more time whilst also making it far easyer to sleep people.
---
D A R N
---
Which screenshots and at what timestamp please.  The only ones I saw were hearsay.
---
I'm going to be blunt: I don't want Freddy reworked because I don't trust them to *not* leave current Freddy mains in the dirt.  Number tweaks and soft changes like Wraith, Hag, and Trapper have received?  Sure.  Full on rework?  I'd rather face Frank's Mixtape Legions and God Nurses for the next thousand games.
---
I had a similar thing. Bubba tried to cut my pizza while it was still on my back.
---
But my problem isnt really with finding the survivors like i usually find them quick but during the chase ruin gets found or they just work with ruin on and i get genrushed to oblivion
---
If you just straight up say the screenshots in the video are fake, I‚Äôm not sure how much good me giving you time stamps will be, considering you‚Äôll probably just call them fake too. Have a nice day :) 
---
Jesus bro that is fucking disturbing. Why can‚Äôt killers be like this instead we get Fucking piggy and cringe teenagers for killers
---
Tbh, traps builds are overrated. The VHS tape and medical file is where its at.
---
Why so many hate to this tier list, its his opinion
---
I can see 2 David's, in the perks :P
---
Surprisingly, a lot of people. I still to this day don't get the obsession some people have with shapeshifting killers.
---
We... we already knew this
---
Damn, u're good.
---
Every other killer does the same in effect, the survivor will run before the killer gets close to hit, vs Freddy they often sit on the gen until he sleeps them at close range, then they run the free hit mentality is why people think 7 seconds is a detriment at anything outside of gates or totems (when it is an issue)
---
And even then the transition  is an opertunty to mindgame from the phasing, which *can* get you a hit, but everyone just try‚Äôs to follow and m1 with double blocks (playing him like worse wraith).
---
Darn
---
Inside the main building of the map on the second floor, I believe. I think you can see it in one of the trailers as well, if you can't find it in game. 
---
&gt;because it wasn‚Äôt in any patch notes
---
It was tho...
---
&gt;Decisive Strike skill checks will trigger during the pickup. This decision was made to help avoid dribbling and reduce the amount of time wasted for the Killer.
---
pebble is genuinely a great perk, it saved my life so many times
---
word, slugging legit is the best counter to swf and genrushing. Mayeb throw on knockout if ya really wanna power it up, even with swf, still takes a bit to find with knockout on.  Seconds count
---
I don't get points for griefing
---
"ez wallhacks reported" 
---
With the creep laugh and all???? 
---
Am I the only one stressed out by those 2 unspent coins?
---
That's, THAT'S ME THEN
---
TBH if I have done enough to pip, the last can go IMO i'll give um a quick slap and take them to the hatch if i know where it is.
---
There are some links and more info here: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ak3do5/comment/ef1f4ar
---
Last night did 4 gens, unhooked two people, and then had the unfortunate luck of beng the one chased when the last gen was finished. Since the killer hadn't gotten a kill yet, you *know* the camp was coming. I understand it, but boy was it upsetting lol
---
Some of y'all need to look up tutorials on how to crop an image 
---
*WOOP WOOP* THATS THE SOUND OF THE POLICE
---
Imagine if you went onto fuckin PUBG or Fortnite or Apex and said; ‚Äúhey everyone let‚Äôs just not kill each other/let‚Äôs not play the game like it‚Äôs supposed to be played‚Äù and you get infuriated when no one does that, so you understand how fucking stupid that is?
---
The same reason cults try to summon demons in movies, they worship them or want something from them. And it would be cool if you could see the entity in one of the future maps unplayable areas like in a distance.
---
Wouldn't it also be safe to just reach around the jaw and trigger it? Or would there be too much resistance and not enough leverage?
---
monkaS
---
I like the sound of that. I would like to see one that was created by the entity. Say, maybe it took a normal person (maybe even a former survivor) and infused them with power and made them kill for it. 
---
Third Seal used to be a part of my totem defender build, but alas, then Haunted Grounds came out and welp, sorry bud, you've been benched. 
---
You need more map pressure.
---
Drop Pop Goes the Weasel (it's really not a good perk), and use BBQ. Post hook it gives a lot of info about Survivor movements, and can help you cut people off going for saves (especially important with coordinated teams, because it forces other people off gens when they realize the guy going to save is suddenly being chased). BBQ also helps you know when they are grouping up (for heals or gens) and can give you a chance to start a slug train for even more map pressure.
---
Clown only has average mobility so knowing when to slug and who to prioritize when deciding who to chase/slug is key for doing well with him. He also requires some decent map knowledge to know when and where to drop chases (Asylum inner building, for example).
---
If you don't have BBQ I can also suggest Sloppy Butcher for slowing the game down, just be more mindful about spreading out attacks to grouped survivors to afflict them with Mangled, which not only slows the healing, but also makes it easier to pick up their trail again after you've slugged your initial target and know someone is still around.
---
wow
---
if you think serverrs will anything besides lagswitching youre delusional 
---
Well the entity is a scheming son of a bitch lol
---
You're partially wrong. 
---
Maybe killers can get there as well, I honestly don't know, but this is definitely bannable as you're exploiting a bug to get over a place the devs didn't want you to get onto. 
---
Where are you getting 7? I only count 5 (Wraith, Adam, Tapp, Claudette and *maybe* Hag)
---
Is it ur cake day?
---
Spooky :D
---
Also if we're counting killers it's 3 asian characters
---
I would love this solely to get out of the stale meta. I am so sick of playing against bbq and ruin EVERY. SINGLE. GAME. Conversly everyone is stuck with what they got and I am sure killers would be happy DS, adrenaline, SC, INSERT Exhaustion perk are not ran every game either.
---
The issue is trying to buff/rework every killer all of a sudden is way too much for BHVR. They've gotta do one Killer every 4 months.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcPxm2VTvFg
---
This is really beautiful!!
---
Lol I‚Äôm the opposite. If I steamroll I feel I deserve the 4K but if the survivors did 4 gens, me giving the last guy the hatch is more of a ‚Äògg‚Äô.
---
just play survivor, wise words from a wise man..
---
Bloodeh Pope tho... Jikes
---
Legion with add-ons
---
Nurse without add-ons
---
I love this :D Great style.
---
in this one? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcPxm2VTvFg
---
Which is why you should honestly accept it and run into Billy's face if you find youself in a dead end...
---
You will go down this way or the other. Might as well try to bait the killer to use their normal attack.
---
You played it right if the killer is just going to stand on the hatch do gens. But hatch camping will always happen, by both sides, because according to the devs it‚Äôs a more satisfying end game than being able to close the hatch. 
---
What is Hunt?
---
Yeah, that's sounds toxic to me.
---
it looks like he's choking a tree branch that nea is holding up for him 
---
I run TTS non-ironically. AMA.
---
It looks great! Lmao idk if you know about Tangled: The Series. But this style reminds me of that kind of Rapunzel-y Art (I mean this in the best way ‚ù§Ô∏è)
---
Haunted hotel 
---
I had a toxic LF who camped last night. My team, instead of doing gens, played into his hands and tried to unhooked the camped person repeatedly. So they all died, but luckily I had gotten two gens. 
---
Normally, I'd avoid the hatch if the killer was on it and do gens, but I decided screw this LF, and stood in front of him, waiting for an opportunity. I'm too stubborn *by far* to let a camper get the 4k. Played on my phone and grabbed food for nearly 40 minutes before he disconnected. Didn't even let me leave, instead just disconnected lol. 
---
Nah, not crying. Just a funny :)
---
Incest burner. Yikes. 
---
As a comment, I'd either block or randomize offerings, items, and add-ons. 
---
Otherwise these games would probably just end up having a bunch of Ebony Moris and the best add-ons/items. :p
---
I'd love this. I've done this with friends in KYF and we've had some amazing games. 
---
I understand, but his reach should match that of huntress hatchets right?
---
Every time since they buffed point gains for it ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I always do if they don't move but it is always worth trying to bait them out.
---
Honestly, I hate to say it, but it‚Äôs going to happen and there‚Äôs not much you can do about it.  Sometimes you get super unlucky and it‚Äôll happen consistently throughout your playtime. If played somewhat ok, you won‚Äôt derank all too much (if that‚Äôs your concern), if at all.  
---
A lot of the time, it comes down to luck. You have constant action, but it‚Äôs away from the gen rushers. You just happen to catch the wrong one to snowball from. On the plus side, games like that won‚Äôt give pips for the survivors and it‚Äôll be over very quickly.  
---
Ace is 100% of Italian origin (according to the DbD wiki anyways), which is very common for people in Argentina. After the USA they received the second largest amount of European immigrants to the Americas. Hispanic-looking in American parlance usually means looking like a Mestizo. Their is no such thing as a Hispanic race. It's a cultural term. There can be White Hispanics, Black Hispanics, Native Hispanics, and multiracial Hispanics. 
---
what if we do though?
---
If you played well and got screwed over by your team, you get the hatch. If I pick you up as Myers and you don't try to struggle free, you also get the hatch. I generally give it away fairly often, 4ks lost their luster for me a long time ago.
---
Has nothing to do with rules no2. If you get gen rushed while a survivor has a trap on, it would reduce the timer as a penalty. That‚Äôs the idea.
---
Finally a voice of reason.
---
OFC it should, it doesn't make any sense but how does getting hit by a hatchet in the back and surviving make sense? By having this small  things that are different with each character it just gets annoying to remember. And there is no reason for some killers to have a longer/shorter lunge unless it affects their power in the case for nurse.
---
The same could be said for killers, man. This community is adversarial and sees anything good for the other side as cancerous for them. It's been like this since the game began. 
---
NVM, Nurse doesn not have a longer lunge, my bad
---
if you think dying light/bloodhound/Pgtw &gt; brutal strength bud, leaves me to believe console player or like slightly new to the game (Which is fine, I'm glad you're giving some explanations) 
---
I can see an argument being made for discordance being high A-tier, low S tier alongside surveillance for sure but I sometimes think people overvalue them in lower ranks or if they're vsing the bottom of the barrel survivors in red ranks which is understandable it's a different playstyle in different ranks, and red rank is worthless atm if you play more than 6 hours you'll get there, hell it's even useful against an okay swf group but once they know you have discordance it will never go off again unless you're on the other side of the map mid chase - I will say they definitely belong in A tier together though.
---
Pgtw is pretty bleh unless you're playing a mobile killer like wraith/billy/nurse - maybe spirit and Legion (But if you play legion..Well hey, everyone goes to hell for different reasons!) 
---
Dying light buffs the survivor in question  and usually when they have dying light they stay fookin' hidden forever because the best way they can survive and help their team is by playing very sneaky so you can't really spend all game looking directly for  them, plus you have to play subo-ptimally to really get it off.
---
Beast of prey can have some use the same way monstrous shrine can have some use, I can see some scenarios where it's quite good but by the time you hit bloodlust you've already hit the survivor so you can't really mindgame with the no red glow aspect. 
---
You've never played with third seal if you think it's F tier, I definitely rate it higher than where it should be but it is realistically around D tier alongside knockout. 
---
Whispers is as good as I think since I know how to pinpoint a survivor with it - I'm surprised since you rate M&amp;A so highly you didn't point out the combo of whispers + M&amp;A lets you get a beat on the survivor before they hear the terror radius  
---
. 
---
M&amp;A+Nurses do work super well together but so does sloppy butcher + nurses, I think M&amp;A are properly located. 
---
Franklins isn't at least A-tier, you're giving up a slot for a potentially useless item. 
---
as for lightborn..I rarely see people bring a flashlight for saving people like 1/5 games there's someone who's good with the flashlight save and even then they can't always be around - plus I can usually just look at a wall or tree or something or I'll fake out the pick up and smack the flashlight player away.
---
Clourophobia is definitely where it belongs, if you decide to pair it with distressing and sloppy butcher+nurses man - survivors just never get to heal lmao.
---
Bloodhound I'll explain time and time again - the bloodtrails they leave behind are visible enough, I understand if you have bad eyesight or are a bit new to the game that people would value it higher. 
---
Territorial imperative is kind of countered by Jeff's discordance perk which I've seen get used multiple times now also survivors usually give away that they're in the basement with looting.
---
STBFL is situational because if only the obsession is around suddenly you've lost half your stacks downing them and if they're running and manage to hit DS, you've lost 3/4ths of your stacks - to outright ignore a survivor and try to look for another one is just poor management of the limited time you have before gens get completed. 
---
But I do thank you for actually giving me your opinions on such things and don't think of this as me shooting you down - if you think those perks have more value than I do all the power to ya but I'm trying to think from the games where I've played and watched and compiled this 
---
Officially, he wasn't, he was banned for abusing a glitch. Unofficially, I'm willing to bet the devs banned him because everyone here cried about him enough.
---
I just started getting all the adept achievements the other day which went way better than expected. Maybe I'm just too stupid to play around the downsides of this perk but for me Object of Obsession is the worst survivor perk by far. Especially against mobile killers I just end up staring at the corner of the map when doing gens and not even daring to look where someone has been hooked. Just feels like a downright debuff instead of a perk you would like to pick. ;) 
---
She is adorable, I love it!
---
*soon*
---
Legion main?
---
hmm, it would be pretty nice because it would make the RBTs a real and genuine threat as now you have plenty of time to get the trap off, even with bad RNG. however i feel like it might become a bit overpowered that way but i don't know, maaaybe not? i doubt many gens will be completed while you have the bear trap on.
---
regardless, i think the timer should decrease 30 seconds for every gen completed while the trap is active. however to balance it out, i don't think any more time should decrease if less than 1 minute is left on the timer.

It's only an issue when you get paired against rank 20s who have 2 hours of gameplay.
---
Rank 1 means you know how the game works. Doesn't matter if you are shit, at least you know the core mechanics. Someone who knows how the game works shouldn't be paired with anyone below rank 15.

Hell is another one. 
---
I know it‚Äôs meme material at this point to say BHVR ‚Äúfix your game‚Äù, etc, but how much this studio has dedicated to making their game better is astounding. 
---
The fact that a small studio put out a game years ago and have focused on community needs/wants, while making consistent performance patches show how much they truly care and are passionate about this game. 
---
In today‚Äôs climate of gaming, this level of transparency and love is extremely rare, and bigger studios and publishers should seriously take note. 
---
Oh no it's a normie that has actually never played against him or his fans and spewing shit ,as a killer main I don't give a flying fuck about tea bagging and I believe if spamming a key on keyboard triggers you then don't play any games but it's not only tea bagging , it's taking control of the game ,its distracting deliberately by clicking and bming while vaulting over windows to annoy us,the game turns into a frustrating experience and then you always have to expect post steam comments and irrelevent reports.
---
oh well how did these ideas and who  implemented this by  abusing gameplay mechanics ? 
---
DING DING DING 
---
THE CUNT HIMSELF
---
Oo changing away from tick based will be **huge**
---
The faster I get to being able to run around corners without rubber banding back the better. 
---
My process in game has always been this: 
---
1. Start Match ‚Äî&gt; Find gen
---
1a. Run into a totem? Cleanse it.
---
2. Touch gen ‚Äî&gt; Test for ruin
---
3. If ruin, find ruin and cleanse all dull found beforehand. If no ruin, do gen.
---
4. As I complete a gen, or gens are done by others, I (try to) cleanse every totem I find for every gen done + 1.
---
5. If my team needs healing, unhooking, distractions, gen assistance- that comes first.
---
6. With 3 gens done I need to have at least 3 totems cleared. 
---
7. When there is 1 gen left, and my team is not in desperate need for assistance, I hunt down that last totem(s).
---
If you look at my flair, thats how I do it. My process is usually countered by really aggressive killers or survivors that cant extend chases, or my dumb ass not being able to survive.
---
don't understand, at the moment we are on UE 4.20 or it will be 4.20 soon?
---
&gt;Is a bad perk?
---
Is it really?

A lot going on here

---
oops I thought I had :0 [Here you go](http://gisellesdoodles.tumblr.com/post/182458649805/moonrise-min)
---
This seems to be the norm. I usually work survivors into the ground up until Gen #2 gets done, then I just shrug off the rest of the energy because I know it'll be a 3K + Hatch unless I somehow find Surv #4 :/
---
Which buffs did she get? Haven't played this game for the last season
---
Then no point of killer using it (just giving possible perspective)
---
no its okay I am always 100% up for discussing Quentin.
---
I liked the idea at first glance as it forces other survivors to be mindful. On second thought though: What would you expect the other three guys to do while one survivor tries to get rid of the trap? If you punish doing gens there might be situations (no hex up, all totems cleansed, noone injured) where three people can do absolutely nothing useful for their progression for a few minutes. I doubt this would improve the gameplay fun-wise. 
---
From what I gathered we are already 4.20, chapter 11 will make it 4.21 with the cpu/gpu changes.
---
Yes. It relies on the survs either tunnelvisioning on finding it, or them not being able to hit skillchecks AND it can be completely cucked by bad RNG. 
---
It's not a good perk and only helps on weak killers/killers you're bad with. There is absolutely no reason to run Ruin on most killers. I run it only on Huntress because I'm terrible at her, but Hag, Billy, Nurse, Doctor, Wraith, Clown, Myers, Pig, Legion and Spirit really do not need it, an argument can be made for Trapper, Freddy and Leatherface but that's a small portion of the killers.
---
I'm gonna go with cautious optimism
---
If I see someone getting unhooked, I'm going back to the hook. Wtf is wrong with you? That would be like a survivor intentionally choosing not to do a generator because the killer just kicked it and that wouldn't be fair man.
---
What happened back in December? That was during a DbD hiatus of mine. 
---
I used to do a lot of disney fanart so thats probably why!
---
The flying meg is relatable
---
I hope we do, we barely ever get female survivors.
---
I sandbag the shit out of my husband when he does this as Claudette.
---
I do this but only for a daily or for extra bloodpoints 
---
A mine has been on my wish list for a long time now, it would be sooooo cool, even though I am not sure how they would design it, several big caves with connecting tunnels, or more of a claustrophobic mess like Lerys, just less symmetrical.
---
Also, a ship does sound sick, even though I can even less imagine how it would work out :D
---
I dunno man she doesn‚Äôt seem like the type of person into smash
---
Same here, people don't realise how usefull it can be. Managed to get the hatch as well by distracting the killer with a pebble.

I'm fine that killers have those things, my problem is that even tho they have those things, they still piss and moan about survivors to this day. And now they are taking away perks. Changing them to useless shit like decisive strike and leader. But like you said we can just play something else. Let the killers try to find lobbies after they get all their needs handed to them. Gg and all

Finally some good fucking food..

Let me in!

no.

Let ME IN!

LET ME INNNN!

yay!  lag for all

The reddit posts will change from laggy PVP host to Laggy dedicated servers.  Just watch

Oh? I feel like I see lots of Kates. Usually wearing the american top

Haha, DBD in a nutshell.

When do we get Ricardo flick back

It's interesting how SWF are more abundant during the day than in the early morning.

i got hard tunneled by a legion and was getting chased for a solid 10 minutes while i had an adam who sat in a corner(doing gens, you?) and after i lost him i got the last gen done and got in  another chase, managed to lose him for a second, threw a pebble away and he just 180'd and disappeared
---
I really hope you don't play anything besides this game. You strike me as the kind of person who thinks that blocking is overpowered in fighting games.
---
Hell yeah. A solid groundwork timeline. I hope they keep up updates like this and all of it goes well. A solid thumbs up for the open transparency however we don‚Äôt know what the future holds so I‚Äôm not jumping for joy but I‚Äôm hella excited. 
---
Hey the artist is @kawarayane on tumblr and she asked for her art not to be reposted without permission! 
---
Kate's a tattoo'd slag.
---
The entire DBD cast sans Dwight are awful people.
---
I can't wait to rubberband as Nurse or to get even more false-chainsaws which were fixedBTW‚Ñ¢ !
---
End of summer 2019 for dedicated servers?  damn it...was really hoping for end of spring or early summer like June or July.  
---
Monto got banned? When and why?
---
Surveillance my man
---
Thank you! 
---
It really would. I feel like after getting rid of the Publisher they have "free hands" to make anything. Like before they said "No, we will never make a Clown killer". IMO that was a guideline from the Publisher. Just a speculation tho.
---
I want feminine surv but a male uwu 
---
This is a joke right?
---
...what
---
you still just ignored the fact that my point is not "remove hatch without anything in exchange" but i very clearly state that the hatch is necessary in the game as it is right now but i wish that the game would change in ways that would make the hatch unecessary.
---
So according to this timeline the optimization will take about a year. Also according to this timeline they haven't even begun the bulk of the work, that starts after this chapter has been released. 
---
I don't feel it needs the nerf too badly even if you don't counter it it's in essence just a crutch to get  a single kill so while annoying as a survivor I've never had too much of an issue with it.
---
maybe the killer would be father campbell from the nurses lore?
---
or better yet, matches pausing due to client sync issues MUHAHAHA
---
they can add remake jason
---
Not a bad idea 
---
He said Nerd, not Nerf :P  HAHAHA

"Edit on spelling nerf"

It was posted first but ok üëå

It's not my fault he's too stupid to stop putting his trap in the same spot over and over
---
Amazing art, I love it! Kate looks so gorgeous. Could you draw the Trapper and the Doctor later too? If you liked them.
---
I main killer and I go out of my way to avoid doing anything toxic. Last night I had hands down the shittiest, most toxic SWF team I‚Äôve ever dealt with. 4 Decisives, an instaheal mid chase, and when I‚Äôd finally knocked the most toxic one of all Laurie was waiting two feet away to full instaheal him near the gate. If you‚Äôre going to tell me that if I decided to tunnel one of those dickheads to death that I‚Äôm the toxic one you can go fuck yourself. 
---
I have no clue
---
quality shit-post 
---
Whenever i play i typically don‚Äôt see her, i played maybe 6 rounds this morning and only saw one üò¢
---
Yeah. If you write out the sentences here, grammatically "she" seems to refer to Nurse in the previous sentence. It's still possible new killer is female though.
---
Or his urge to murder gives him sexual gratification. 
---
Why she have a bulge... 
---
Is it really just situational? 
---
Aw thanks! I could try! I don‚Äôt normally do request because of college schedule and what not! But I love their designs so I‚Äôll definitely try to :D
---
They can still progress the gens, just not pop them. And I think at the most, it‚Äôd affect the timer maybe 20 seconds upon the competition of a gen but that would be the cap.
---
Fucking 3 more chapters? Target 60fps? Their dedication to this game is mind blowing. I‚Äôm really happy that they‚Äôre continuing to support this game.
---
Top quality comedy 
---
mmmm... maybee!
---
10-9 is ideal from my perspective, never been below 8, but rank 13-15 is probably the worst 
---
amen 
---
Laurie is the girl next door type.
---
What's more girly than that?
---
They gave a pass on an optimization patch. Although they did give us a patch, which was only an update to the Unreal engine.
---
Witch doctors don't carry incense censers. It's more likely a priest, monk, or something of that sort. 
---
Wtf ... cringey 
---
Exploiting in Ironworks. With Noob3 and another 2 he glitches into a God spot on top of a gen and recorded it
---
Seriously... what are these posts? 
---
Does *anyone else* remember how terrifying NOED used to be? You can at least keep it from activating. Be lucky it works that way now, because when I started, it made no exceptions. 
---
You say that, but I do a lot of losing online XD
---
This is an unusual adult film... 
---
They changed engines I believe and fucked the game in the process. They had to take Ormond out of rotation to fix it.
---
This needs to be a comic or picture 
---
I'm a simple man. I see new Chapter Announcements I know they will eventually release cosmetics soon after. I think of another chance for Bunny Feng. I like the new Chapter before release.
---
well dwights make up for it for being the most sandbag happy in game so I guess it's even
---
If you lot can manage to get a consistent 60 fps on console, I'll eat my own ass until I stop existing. 
---
Whenever people ask me why I Spirit main I'll just show this picture
---
Most of the people who hate NOED now never faced the true terror of pre-hex NOED. It's actually hilarious tbh.
---
And while we're at it, let us have shirtless Feng Min ü§§
---
Lets hear it
---
Sameeeee
---
sounds like a good structured strategy! üëçüèº 
---
I think sticking to gen even with ruin can be better though. sometimes more time is wasted finding ruin that wasted from ruin effect on gen. 
---
Either way it‚Äôs better than no strat at all
---
Still an exploit that shouldn't be abused and op showing them doing it doesnt make it acceptable. That'd be like a killer finding a way to have NOED active at all times and using it knowing that its exploiting a mechanic 
---
If I had given someone the hatch and then found out they had this entitled attitude about deserving the hatch, I'd wish I had mori'd them. 
---
Woah, that‚Äôs actually a desktop background worthy photo for me.  Cool find!  Thanks for not tracing it and claiming it your own either lol.
---
I wasn't really paying attention to what he was saying at the Game Awards. I was more thinking of how envious I was of Geoff Keighley, and how he got to stand so close to the beautiful Mathieu Cote.
---
DH, Adren, bond, IW
---
idk in my experience with noed, most run ruin as well, but it always also seems extremely likely that they will when they play a weaker killer without ruin
---
"Denied. Here's a penalty, Mr. Wright."
---
And stake out
---
Frank's mixtape= no fun time.
---
If it doesn't end chases/help a killer tunnel, it's auto-bad according to this sub 
---
Lol I will if that's what you want. This one is awful it's like you've hardly played the game or used these perks at least
---
"By the end of Summer 2019". This is the same thing as "Summer 2019".
---
thank you :)
---
I feel like we'll get a tomb raider type survivor with this new chapter
---
Not really a disappointment since that's when a lot of people have more time to actually play, right now is the same few handfuls of people in certain ranks 
---
The thing is TotH + any totem tend to act like survivor magnets on their own.
---
Nurses is good for closing the deal on a healing survivor but having someone downed and unable to be found by anyone but you means you'll always have a way of pinpointing + hurting their gen completion.
---
Oh, that's probably more justified lol
---
Legion is considered one of the worst killers though 
---
I stole an idea from hybrid panda where I use different survivors in different ways. I have a gen build, an altruism build, troll build, chase build, stay hidden build, and general builds. I like it now because it keeps things fresh for me. But ky general build is: dance with me or quick and quiet, adrenaline or self care, small game, bond
---
Well for me it was the first time where even the button didn‚Äòt show up bc she was standing right on it unlike others standing next to it to grab you. Just like you can‚Äôt do a totem while another survivor is doing it. Even if she made herself a sandwich being AFK I had to do gens or dc. 
---
Maybe dbd could fix this bodyblock thing by letting the escape button show up. 
---
Lmao I was just about to say I love playing Freddy! Looks at my rank: 12. You‚Äôre probably right. 
---
What someone eli I don‚Äôt know about Ochido? What did he do?
---
To be fair a lot of my teammates don't touch gens either lol
---
Current meta is Self Care, Adrenaline, DS, and an exhaustion perk. 
---
Personally, I've been trying to get the unhook yourself achievement so my build recently has been We're Gonna Live Forever, Deliverance, Empathy, and Self Care. My usual build is Bond, Iron Will, Distortion, and Adrenaline. 
---
There's a lot of fun perk builds you can try, though they'll hardly be as effective as the meta. 
---
How is he one of the worst killers? No one can get away from him, and if he has gen hex, no one can rush gens (unless you get stupid lucky and find the burning skulls right away). I'd rather be against any other killer if money was on the line. 
---
Has noone mentioned a school yet? Smh
---
Cries in console 
---
Hi
---
But....... gen rushing is a thing..... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Gotta get above 30 on console first 
---
She ded tho
---
This is a delight. They‚Äôre essentially Canada‚Äôs only publisher.  That‚Äôs like saying Billy Madison was the smartest kid in kindergarten. 
---
oh my entity the amount of people just on the hate train for the word 'nerf'. they dont even read the post, just comment. jeez.
---
I'd call that getting bonesawed
---
I‚Äôm not the best with great skill checks, which is why I‚Äôd rather go after Ruin than work on a gen. Also since I always run Small Game, it seems like a waste of a perk to not use it.
---
'Crying' is a very easy word to resort to, in order to dismiss the constant, legitimate complaints made in regards to his repeated offenses, toxic behaviour and encouraging using glitches to ruin the game. How about replacing that fanboy bias with thoughts, and maybe you can make a valid argument?
---
Legit, had a game yesterday where I got hooked first and no one came to my aid until the second hook. I would appreciate them being slow and careful and not unhook me near the killer, but time is not on one‚Äôs side when they‚Äôre on the hook. 
---
The purple mixtape and the dirt is even worse. Almost zero cooldown, and the stun is barely a second. Removes any punishment for hitting a survivor over and over, and unlike the iridescent mixtape, the pallets stay up for you to mess with survivors at
---
still shows "nerd"  hehe
---
Good guy killer.
---
It‚Äôs funny because one requires not making a mistake while the other is literally standing still. If that‚Äôs fun for you, you should try a new game.
---
Mines would be so cool
---
I've never understood the hate for Legion. The only time the killer annoys me is if they use the moonwalking exploit. I've thankfully come across Frank's mixtape only rarely, so that hasn't bothered me though I imagine it would if I fought it constantly. 
---
I've never had an issue slamming a pallet down on a Legion using their ability, which completely wrecks them. And sure, mending is dull, but it's not the worst. I'd rather fight a Legion than a Doctor or a Freddy. They're more annoying imo. 
---
No perks, true survivor build 
---
If I'm not wrong, Mcote said that he would want to keep this game alive and running for at least 5 more years. Assuming that the game does in fact stay alive for that long and they keep releasing chapters every 3 months, we'd be getting at least 20 more chapters, and I'm not even considering the possibility of us getting even more Paragraphs.
---
I definitely want to see how this game will turn out by the end of its lifespan. Imagine all the Perks and Killers we'd have by then...
---
Someone should tell Dwight that Moto Moto likes him!!  xD
---
If you teabag me your dead. If I slaughtered your team and you pointed them out you get the hatch. Lol
---
Nice thank you ! But what about the 60fps ? Because on PC I can get 60fps with my r9 280x but I have to put all graphic on low which is not a problem. Maybe they are talking about console to get 60fps ?
---
this is too much of a nerf to NOED, turning it into a hex would prevent me from getting an undeserved 4k every game because the survivors could just stop it. i think NOED actually needs a buff and should let you instantly mori survivors like myers does with addons
---
What in the living hell is a vacuum 
---
Hahah. Same :D
---
They were hoping the Unreal update would fix everything. It didn't go well.
---
Granted they weren't transparent about this, but they didn't necessarily lie.
---
It may not be referred to as multiple personality disorder anymore, now disassociative idenitity disorder, but it is infact a real disorder and affects many people worldwide.
---
There is no such thing as a hardware ban lol. There are IP bans, but you can easily get around those with a VPN. 
---
Not gonna lie, they had us in the first half
---
Idk what slugging is sorry. Can you explain?
---
Police Jesus is on his way
---
I run directly into him
---
Nothing in the EULA says I have to finish a match, either.  ;)
---
&gt;   Dead by daylight will run at 60‚ÄØFPS on PlayStation‚ÄØ4, Xbox One, and minimum spec PCs
---
i remember that eveyone used to say that hag was bad too because they had 8 traps not set with 2 gens left and putting 10 traps when they manage to hook a survivor. Once they learned how to play her she became a beast. I hope people realize that freddy has a great potential 
---
What's myc hag?
---
Lithe, Adrenaline, Dance with me, Quick and Quiet
---
Deliverance/Hope/Adrenaline/We'll Make It
---
that didn't stop people with zombieland
---
You're forgetting Feng and Nea asshat, that's 6.
---
And all the female killers.
---
And the fact that making a character male/female just to fill some bullshit quota is dumb.
---
Never mind already made it. Was bored
---
pathetic 
---
Dude, crusaders exist yah know
---
I didn‚Äôt think a spirit upskirt would be something I ever wanted to see.... and I was right 
---
I feel this in all forms cause the male survivor models look like huge eggs while crouching and I caNNOT LIVE LIKE THIS ANYMORE 
---
I don't understand people who get off by upsetting other people. Don't you have a hobby? Quit spending all your time defending some fuckwit internet entertainer and go do something with your life my man; life's too short.
---
B-b-baka, I didn't want to hook you anyway
---
Nice
---
Prob just an urban myth that
---
what if i don't use feral frenzy

Most dont run good addons because people will DC if they catch a whiff of anything above yellow rarity on legion

---
Lies, you know you wanted to see it
---
As you should
---
Android.
---
Ew.
---
Yes, but they can heal out of it. Taking up all survivors time
---
No. Most people tough it out a get over the match. All you do is ruin the match for your teammates. 
---
That‚Äôs a great new for all the players !! I hope to see the game on PS5 or maybe a new iteration of the game :D
---
Okay I went on the wiki and Feng and Nea didn‚Äôt show, is that a reason to be insulting?
---
And my point still stands there are more male survivors and last two survivors have been male.
---
Also, it‚Äôs not to fill some ‚Äòbullshit quota‚Äô it‚Äôs for balance and we want the community to be happy.
---
Also, why on earth would I include killers?
---
R N

I kinda find myself craving toast &amp; eggs now

But she took that locker Dwight‚Äôs spot smh

Corpse Party intensifies
---
 There‚Äôs no better way to learn than the hard way, sadly that‚Äôs how I learned. No one told me it would happen, until I tried to leave with it on lol 
---
I made a post a while ago about t and it is so fucking frustrating, especially when playing spirit or pig. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even get to hit them and they get off without a scratch. 
---
Trapper nipples with little traps on them. 
---
Then you are playing a 110% movement speed killer with no power.
---
exactly!
---
More often than not, I'm not the first DC in a Legion match anyways. I'm usually the second, or sometimes even third person to DC once I realize who it is. 
---
PS4. Standing too close to a tree will get you stuck and you can‚Äôt move at all unless the killer downs you and picks you up. It is beyond frustrating. 
---
If she would be hunting me, I'm here
---
Ambush attacks give you more points in deviousness.
---
Even better is that he had leader. If he would have let you do it it would have been done 25% faster.
---
Exactly.
---
So because the perk use to be stronger than it is currently the current noed is not overpowered at all? I don‚Äôt quite see the logic here. 
---
The original noed would be completely op if it were implemented in the current dbd. Back in the day it wasn‚Äôt that bad because of infinite‚Äôs and the sheer number of pallets but yknow. 
---
i sympathize. i was an XBox main for the first three months i played DBD, when the rubberbanding glitch after being unhooked was *bad*. now i play on PC and have to mod the graphics so they look like PS1 graphics and i *still* get better frames than i ever did on XBox lmao
---
That‚Äôs ban evasion, which is also bannable. 
---
The second point almost makes this not look like a shitpost. The wording could be changed a bit.
---
It's cos she's blue and needs hairspray lol
---
I think you confuse pissed off and mildly concerned. The fact that people so easily resort to insults without thought, that yours would easily be mistaken as just another stranger on the internet speaking out of his ass is precisely why it should be adressed, not anger
---
Many freddy isnt even that weak when he has a 10 inch invisible reach advantage...
---
I disagree about nurse's on the clown. It's too easy to play around with a normal TR killer and most of the slug pickups are going to be near instant. 
---
Sadly Switch will keep at 30 fps because of the console itself.
---
Use Franklin‚Äôs Demise, Enduring, Save the Best for Last, and Brutal Strength
---
Muahahahahahaha. Plus ebony mori.
---
whos ochido?
---
Sorry I hurt your feelings.
---
Perhaps. Nothing in the EULA says you have to complete a match, though. Also a VPN will get you around any IP bans etc. From what I understand, this happens a lot vs Legion players. Maybe the devs should address the killer so that people stop quitting. If he had to break planks like all the other killers, I'd have no problem with him. 
---
This guy doesn't bamboozle
---
I'm running self care, alert, premonition, and small game. Your totems are mine, and we'll probably never be on the same side of the map.
---
Ok, I will treat you like a special boy then
---
I'm hoping for an elderly nun
---
Mother Theresa licensed dlc when BHVR?! :p
---
I mean if you play as Freddy you can even remove Deerstalker as well. So you could have something like Third Seal, TotH, Enduring, and Spirit Fury. Could be interesting.
---
Bamboozle?
---
No.. claudettes
---
Thanks for the replies guys. Just will have to get used to her attacks. It felt like she was much faster than my character but I never did look back so it was probably the hatchets as you all have mentioned. 
---
Clown's strength is not map pressure, it's anti-loop. A different killer will help you stop gen-rushing ie; Doc w/Distressing, Hillbilly, Nurse, Spirit, or even Wraith w/speed addons.
---
Also, Discordance and Surveillance
---
Look, I want him reworked as much as the next guy but I still put up with the shit and move on. At least kill your self on hook so that you get bloodpoints and you don‚Äôt have too many DC‚Äôs
---
These and I wish the Clown got an actual carnival D:
---
Humor is subjective. I can't say you don't think he's funny, but I can say that objectively, he's not funny for more than 20 minutes tops, because his humor is an unvarying singular momentum of monotony that quickly grows stale
---
And with how many people have pointed out that his content is primarily ear rape with mediocre clips, I'd say that it's the equivalent of shaking keys in front of a toddler. If you find that funny, that's for you to find funny. Just don't be surprised that nobody above the age of 12 does
---
Legion is more evil tho
---
Whatever suits you pal. No skin off my back that some random stranger on the internet thinks of me as one thing or another
---
I agree her being the ‚Äúfinal girl‚Äù definitely makes her a feminine character but I‚Äôm looking for more like Sarah Michelle Gellar in ‚ÄúI know what you did last summer‚Äù kinda Survivor, she was a beauty queen but she also could handle herself.
---
That aint a bad idea, I suppose. You just don't get to keep any of your items when you do it that way. Granted you still lose your offerings no matter what.
---
# EXACTLY
---
It‚Äôs what people do when they don‚Äôt want to DC. 
---
I was admiring that running with toast and egg picture so much that I was confused why Jesus had to get involved.
---
You beet me to it
---
I hope so. We haven‚Äôt gotten a female survivor since Curtain Call, and if the new killer is male the new survivor should be female based on past DLC‚Äôs. 
---
i always hear this ult as "I love teen men."
---
Oh yeah I know it still be 30 fps but at least this brings hope for a STABLE 30 fps
---
I don't own Freddy so I couldn't say from experience but when I run most TotH + Totem combos, I try to bring Agitation so that carrying a survivor doesn't mean it's safe to destroy totems.
---
You could at least credit the artist (@kawarayane on tumblr).

Not hating, cause low quality shitpost are still low quality shitpost 
---
Ochido is very far from being a divine being lol 
---
Ive said this before...if games like Battlefield and COD can run at 60fps on console there is no excuse why DBD, a game with 5 players, small maps and textures that look like legos up close shouldnt.
---
Not my proudest fap
---
If you can‚Äôt get a 4 k without his power don‚Äôt even talk to me üò§üò§
---
I... I said that. Did you not read what I said past the first sentence?
---
"Stop in the name of lord!"
---
Being a Freddy main is pretty chill. Got 2K hours and 800 of those Freddy. And TBH he is not as bad as people say he is, I think people are just really bad with him.
---
Full timer is 2 minutes 30 seconds, tampered timer takes it down to 2 minutes I believe
---
Another battle royale? No thanks lol
---
It's not that Freddy is bad necessarily... But I have never had a match against a Freddy that didn't tunnel you to death. Leatherface gets a bad rep but I've had way worse experiences against Freddy.
---
Then they would HAVE to do something about the grind, right? Or else a lot of newer players wouldn't even want to think about getting into this game. Either way, I hope they still find a way to keep the servers running long after they stop releasing new content. Auric Cells pay for themselves and this game sounds like it's going to be a dream to run and play one day. It will definitely always have its fans. I know this is all far off but I'd love to see this game still online decades into the future. 
---
so each gen completed after the timer has started should bring timer down 37.5 sec at base and down 30 sec with tampered timer.
---
I was talking to someone on here about that. It would be awesome
---
So? I main freddy too
---
But I use overcharge
---
I will never tire of the RuPaul crossovers.
---
I‚Äôm not saying i‚Äôd watch an anime with Rin as the protag, but i‚Äôd totally watch an anime with Rin as the protag

Why would anyone ever choose tick based over event based in the first place? Unless it's like DRM or something. 
---
good god that pic is pure neckbeard incel
---
I actually felt bad about doing this the other night. Playing killer and I killed the other three players and happened to walk past the hatch while I was hunting down the fourth player. Downed her then figured what the hell and dropped her at the hatch and she escaped.
---
In the chat at the end she said thanks! and then "wait why didn't that complete my daily?" It ended up that her daily was one of the open the exit and escape ones. Doh
---
Of course I've been on the opposite end too. Playing survivor with some friends and I'd picked up a purple toolbox from a chest on the map. Later on Leathface was chasing me down and I knew he was going to get me so I figured I would just drop the toolbox while he was chasing me. I "lost" him and we finished up the map then he chased me out at the end. I gave a "phew, GG!" and he came back with "I wasn't going to kill you, you left me a toolbox &lt;3" lol
---
4.2.0 was the absolute biggest mess. Ignoring the current patch's hitboxes, 4.2.0 was easily one of the buggiest messes of a release of this game I've ever played. 
---
Remember that this all started with BHVR purchasing the rights to publish back from Starbreeze. Almost everything we've heard since they took over publishing rights has been amazing news! Seems like a lot of what was holding BHVR back was their relationship with an outside entity (sound familiar?)
---
If this doesn‚Äôt get hundreds of upvotes.... *arthur hand*
---
True, but even if I take the hit, it only forces me to mend, it usually doesn't down me and instead gives me the time to get away while he's still in the stun.
---
All just a speculation. Could be something totally different. 
---
"Ringmaster" vs The Clown etc
---
This and the 2 killers 8 survivors too
---
Many many games run at 60 on console. Pretty much every indie games is at 30 or worse.
---
I know but it's just so similar.
---
It is a amazing trick and more people should know about it. Also, since basically only Freddy players know about it, and even there only a small percentage, it works really, really well.
---
Do you find that you have a finer control over little adjustments with the keyboard rather than the mouse? I was using the mouse because I thought it would give a bit more granular control over movement, but, obviously judging by my lack of success with the CS sprint, maybe the mouse is a bit too sensitive? 
---
I love the idea of a Catholic priest/bishop/cardinal as a killer. That religious vibe is so spooky.
---
I guess Freddy won't be the only pedophile in the game anymore.
---
"Heart beat" is a method where a client sends packets to the server that it is still connected. Another is timers that don't need to be 100% perfect like maybe the exposed effect. Chances are they had most of the responsive logic in the heart beat which is totally fine in a small game. However as games get bigger, shaving off milliseconds in performance is a big deal especially when more perks, more logic and more abilities need to be tied down to that heart beat
---
Yeah, a lot of people are scared to play him cause he is "weak" but the way I play leaves little counter play, at least from what I've seen
---
Legion:DC
---

I take a lot of joy from this elitist community, going so far to go after one guy. Saying he's extremely toxic but yet here you all are, witch hunting a single man over some bullshit that requires an old post to help remember exactly what he did. Grow up and stop giving him all the attention he wants, love or hate it doesn't matter. Just move on...
---
Lol. It's a laughable post to have something new on this thread instead of a bunch of people piss whining over matchmaking and perk changes, not a brag post. Kinda sad you kids are so salty over it. It's a video game bitches, learn to enjoy it. This was just a fun little match, get over it. üëå
---
Hag and Doctor are both black, according to the wiki. And although I can't find any evidence of it at the moment, I'm fairly certain Joey, from the Legion, is black.
---
I like where this is going.
---
Graveyard
---
Funhouse / amusement park (why on earth they didn't give us one of these with the Clown befuddles me, they rather just reskin an old map with some shitty amusement park items)
---
Tomb / underground lair
---
Haunted mansion and I'm not referring to that shitty movie, would love a big ass haunted house
---
Won‚Äôt we‚Äôll make it better for this build? instead of botany
---
Tanato,sloppy,bloodhound, I run this on wraith and just love this shit so much
---
But I‚Äôm rank 14 so don‚Äôt take me serious
---
Dissapointed oink.
---
Tanatophobia that low? But rest is pretty fine I‚Äôd say
---
Yeah, I overlooked Jake Park. The other two, Feng and the Spirit, are more obvious.
---
That just looks like Doctor's arm. New killer is Doctor 2?
---
100% agree. 
---
New graphic engine looks dope
---
Fuck you your not funny
---
What are you talking about my dude
---
i thought she was  a woman not a girl what is happening to killers these days
---
First thing that came into my mind was a Nurse 2.0 appearing from the mist. 
---
Behavior: "Survivors, the DS nerf was a surprise, so here is this new perk, 'you're so square'"
---
They all sound like Mortal Kombat fatalities LOL
---
[deleted]
---
Like I said before though you have to be careful. Many developers use camera techniques like slight motion blur to make lower FPS values seem more consistent
---
I refuse to accept dwight as buff
---
lets be honest, the balance of this game is often shit and super exploitable, but its the only one that is still fun in spite of that. 1337 hours and no sign of stopping. KEEP IT UP BHVR!!
---
Atleast the lag for killer and survival will be equal. 
---
Still have Hide or Die band wagon to ride buddy hehe
---
Im waiting for the day we gonna get blue hoodie for Legion
---
Or Claudette :D
---

Get your breathing checked, pugs are known for breathing problems.

You're not Ayanami Rei.

Description: bleed out timer under the wrong survivor

I‚Äôll link to it in comments

Never happened again, may be due to all survivors having same name.
---
Specs: at least 16 gigs ram, 1060 gtx
---
My issue is I see WAY too my shitposts on this sub. Nearly almost every post in a row is a meme. I'm fine with gud memes in a sub but holy shit I'd like more genuine discussions or questions at least.
---
Damn! Okay....that Kate looks immaculate.
---
that one is there i just couldnt remember the name i called it the hook healing perk sorry
---
R/cursedvideos
---
One of my favorites of 2018
---
Step 1) Increase Teleport Distance with Add-Ons
---
Step 2) Use *Make Your Choice*
---
Literally if you can get at least ONE person in the basement, it‚Äôs a 4K easily.
---
You'd have to put some way of reading what perks you'v been given as If you've never seen the perk before you may not recognise the icon.
---
Other than that I'd play the shit out this mode.
---
Way to wholesome :) 
---
You're few acting as if we're talking about the release date of a new game or expansion. We're not though. We're talking about a quality of life patch. There is no smart planing on when to release, it's literally sooner = better. 
---
*It's BBQ or nothin'*
---
Don' think so, she was 18 if I remember correctly, maybe even older
---
If it also removed the hook bubble or would be fucking amazing
---
Slow but Hearty
---
You can take an extra hit before going down. Your movement speed is permanently slowed by XX/XX/XX%.
---
Still and Steady
---
You‚Äôre not easily shaken. Progress healing and repairing is achieved XX/XX/XX% faster while in the killer‚Äôs terror radius. (Am I wrong or is there a perk similar to this that I‚Äôm just not thinking of?)
---
Photographer‚Äôs Memory 
---
You have a good memory and put it to use. Whenever you pass a totem or generator while in a chase, see their auras for X/X/X seconds once you leave the killer‚Äôs terror radius.
---
Apologies in advance if the formatting is buggered. I‚Äôm on mobile.
---
Yeah, but the clown is more on your arse constantly chasing you. A singed killer would force you to constantly run to new places or you'll suffer the consequences. 
---
How has nobody said a school yet?
---
#ETIAM
---
Legion is the best farmer, but if you want to farm AND have a good time, Doctor is the best choice
---
Absolutely 
---
Sooner is better but I'd rather them have it ironed out before pushing it out and fucking up the game more. Servers aren't just a wave of the hand and boom they are there, they have to do various bug test rewrite parts of the code so them saying end of summer 2019 makes sense 
---
That's great! Like often I'll go against the competant killers. They do as you do, get 3-4 kills. I love those games. It's the ones who don't get any. Or camp. 
---
The salt is beautiful. That's who I'm aiming at. There's definitely salt on both sides. 
---
Your quota makes no sense. We have Kate, Claudette, and Feng as girly survivors. And if that's not satisfying enough they gave Nea green hair to shut you Pink Hat wearing people up. Let them release who they want, and I main Claudette, then Meg. And killer main Spirit.
---
Had a moment in a SWF game where I juked the Killer into the basement like 3 times. One time I heard them come back so I go hide in one of the lockers at the end of the room.
---
They walk in, check *one* **single** locker at the front of the room, and then leave.
---
I was fucking pissing myself and freaking out at my friend over Discord.
---
Give this man a medal
---
Just do it
---
We really need a ‚ÄúCrafting‚Äù Menu. Something to get rid of the literal 100+ grey Killer Add-Ons I have, because I‚Äôm literally never going to use them.
---
Black Ops 3 had a cool idea called Newton‚Äôs Lab, which would let you trade in certain Items for one/several rare Items, and the ‚Äòrecipes‚Äô would change daily.
---
I‚Äôd love being able to place 3-5 grey Add-Ons for maybe one Rare?
---
The other day I played a game against a Claudette who'd literally just crouch in the middle of a cornfield in the middle of a chase.
---
Like bitch I know I'm Nurse and I can't see fucking shit through this corn but *I'm not blind.*
---
As someone who has played since 2017, I dont care about the work I did. They will need to make the grind smaller for new players. We didnt have this crazy grind back then. Getting new perks is easy for me bc I can always get them for my main characters on next blood web.  Perks are often essentially balance changes so they really need to cut the grind or slow the ranking up progression for the newbies. 
---
Blind is bad because Aura Reading is a crutch and good Survivors don't need it.
---
It does make me cry when I run Plunderer's Instinct for the only time ever and the Killer randomly has Third Seal for no reason though.
---
But how does that teleport me from the generator to the house?
---
Amanda next?
---
* I'd love a castle map with some balconies to vault akin to Father Cambel's Chapel.
---
* Father Cambel's Chapel. Also new Killer.
---
* I'm very shocked we don't have a Catacomb map. Probably cause Lery's fills that role well enough.
---
* Kinda the same as the castle IMO.
---
* (Laughs in Huntress)
---
* (HOOOOONKS in Pale Rose. But a larger ship could be pretty awesome.)
---
* Possibly the new map might fill this, but we also have Haddonfield I guess
---
* The Game
---
Unless it's a storage issue, she should be free, the huntress as well if she interests you
---
You can't even tell that it's Android though...
---
Predator and Shadowborn may be bad, but I love Bloodhound, goddamn it. :(
---
Hook 1 slug one and apply pressure on your next. 
---
90% of this sub is very bad highschool shitposts repeated to oblivion and passive agressive useless rant posts. I want to sort by new, but man is getting difficult to handle all the cringe.
---
And dare I say that it has increased since Legion came out?
---
With all my BP I get from when I play legion, I can make my coffin as bling as I want, lol.
---
If games like Overwatch and Counterstrike can have snipers in games with dedicated servers, I don't think it will be that big of a deal for DbD.
---
I wouldn't use Distressing + unnerving OC already makes checks guarantied and those other two perks make random escapes more likely which is a issue (the best part of OC is you have full control over it) and distressing hurts your aura reading, PGTW can work well tho
---
Also when they try and do that for the third time in a match and it hasn't worked once.
---
And when I'm chasing them as Freddy. You're lit up like a glowstick my dude
---
Noooooooooo the baby Dwight ;-;
---
making your connection worse on purpose
---
Tu ne te souviens pas du caf√© gratuit le lundi ?C‚Äô√©tait le bon temps.
---
The funny thing is that with Leader you would've opened it faster anyways.
---
im pretty sure there are teleport hacks for dbd
---
Thank you for saying the truth
---
Hahahahahaha thus guy just said hag is top tier, lmfaooooo fucking christ reddit you never fail with the cringe.
---
ARE YOU ON THE SQUARE?
---
F13th was extremely fun when it first released. Then about 3-4 months afterwards games started to not fill up. Anybody that also managed to have a good time playing sort of stopped playing. Admittedly by September after not playing to often I had got bored of the game.
---
I have about 100 hours in DBD at the moment.
---
You mean every single one where they use a paper plate and draw on it? "Hey guys look at my awesome "cosplay" of an edgy guy. Haha I'm so edgy too."
---
Games can run at whatever framerate the developer wants. It's just a matter of reducing visual quality until it hits the framerate they're targeting. Original PS4 can hit 90 FPS for VR games, because that's a strict requirement. They might look like ass, but it's 90 FPS.
---
It's just a balancing act for the developer/publisher. Publishers like good graphics because they sell. So 30 fps is the usual target because that's what they've found is the "sweet spot" for FPS vs visual quality.
---
No chase or anti-looping utility, no one-shot ability in his kit, difficult to make clutch plays(gate/generator pulls), not a ton of stealth, and his ability doesn't slow the match down all that much. Who is he more effective than?
---
Dead By Daylight will not run 60 fps on a console. It just won't. Without severe graphical adjustments that will make the game look like Fortnite at least.
---
I also leave Freddy games because I know whats gonna happen. Gonna get farmed off the hook by "team mates" then tunneled down.
---
lantern =/= censer
---
I'm not sure where you got the idea THAT'S my mentality. All I said was I don't leave the game first most of the time. I don't think I ever said I did anything because of anyone else on my team. 
---
Thank you so much!!!! ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Hello again, father. 
---
An abandoned mall would be sick
---
It sounds like his game mechanic leaves the player little choice but tunneling. I honestly wasn't aware of that... But then it just supports the consensus that he desperately needs a rework. 
---
I love my boy billy hush up
---
(Shyly) W-w-waaaahhh
---
How did it take 100 upvotes to get a single comment.
---
It‚Äôs their only money maker of course they‚Äôre gonna work on it. I can guarantee if that other game they made that died (so forgettable the name escapes me) was successful enough they would have probably bailed on this game at some point.
---
Why are the perks arranged like that?
---
Yeah, the update won't do very much for me at all since I usually didn't use it on my first down anyway.
---
It'll definitely make my killer games more enjoyable too since I'm usually across the map when someone is unhooked, so my chance of downing them again within 60 seconds is pretty slim. Lol.
---
Hey, I‚Äôll take 30fps as long as it‚Äôs steady. Give us an option to cap it or let it run wild. 
---
I know it's hearsay, but there's a lot of people supporting it and talking about their own stories in the comments, too much for it to just be baseless accusations. With your story, it was one person. With this one, it's a whole group of young girls, along with several streamers and youtubers. When there's that many people all with the same accusation, there's got to be something to it.
---
That tactic works on me 9 times out of 10...
---
Guess I'm blind... 
---
It's 80's hot topic so you know it's good though.

---
&gt; his ability doesn't slow the match down all that much.
---
This my friend is where you are wrong. By using range and dress add-ons (preferably Green Dress and Nancys masterpiece) or Class Photo you're able to keep all keep all survivors in the dream world for almost 80% of the match, this is ofc based on skill checks so RNG. But by having all survivors do gens at 50% speed, you don't even need to have an anti chase/loop ability. When it comes to Freddy's stealth factor, he is pretty okay at it, perks like MaA make your terror radius 16M, this is gives a good way to sneak up on survivors. And shot abilities can be added, personally I like Devour Hope, it is sneaky and once you get it you can just go to town, and if everyone is asleep you don't need things like Thrill of The Hunt, instead just go for survivors who are in the vicinity of your totem. What I do is simple, I put one person to sleep, then I go for another one, then another one, and lasty another one. When all survivors are asleep there is not much they can do, unless they are really lucky and and get a skill check. 
---
How do you know if they have played a good game?
---
DBD got a dedicated servers? NO ****** WAY! FINALLY! When??
---
RN
---
That's the word. I knew there was a word for those things, i just couldn't remember it.
---
I also have a 280x! Maybe we'll be able to turn up the settings a little. Though I've heard corn is easiest to see through on low
---
DARN
---
So, which killers would you say that he's more effective than? You didn't really answer my question, which ones would you put him over in general, not just on individual mechanics?
---
It's an online game, assholes will shit on you for breathing, you did good.
---
That said, 2 gens and one save in a whole game is not that much. Did you hide?
---
And none of them has Borrowed Time
---
I wouldn't recommend starting with Nurse, if that's your first killer you'll have problems playing any other killer
---
I'd be more excited if they would actually admit Legion was a mistqke.
---
sorry guy but imma have to steal and edit this
---
30FPS won't be so bad, especially considering we don't ever really get 30FPS on PS4/Xbox now. The Switch will always be the away console, while PS4/Xbox/PC will be the home one.
---
That said, despite the screen size, I hope 720P won't be too terrible.
---
That game is from 2013... ofcoure all the bugs are gone by now. But I am sure there were bugs in the first 3-4 years it was released. And if I look at the bug reports it looks like their game isn't that perfect either. 
---
But okay I'll give it to you, I don't know anything about Path of Exile so I can't say much about it but it has probably less bugs than DBD but I never said DBD was working as hard as they could, but just let it go, making memes and jokes about it isn't gonna speed it up. I am just sick of people saying "Fix your game" under every post they make.
---
\*Is actually hiding behind the tree on the left\*
---
Then the cosmetics team works their asses off and nobody else does.
---
Yo but why tho?
---
It‚Äôs not my first killer I‚Äôve played other killers to get certain perks that I see a lot of people running I‚Äôve just never played killer seriously so I‚Äôm trying to get into it
---
When everyone disconnects and he still hooks you ;( it be like that
---
Happens on PC too. Luckily, I had a friend nearby who was damaged. When they walked up, I healed them and it unstuck me. 
---
Yes, and the lawyers bills usually follow after it's concluded. 
---
60 FPS for ps4, can i run 144 fps on my Pc now?
---
Even better when a DS user baits you near the exit gates to down them, so they can activate DS and escape. But they forget they have a bear trap on.
---
*Trap noises*
---
Yeah most of the time I‚Äôm the last one left and I can‚Äôt get out so it just gives the killer a free 4K. 
---
Then we'd have a even worse deranking problem people would throw and ruin the fun for other just to play a br
---
That's a fallacy.  There's a whole mob of people that hate on one individual and downvote *anything* that doesn't utterly condemn the person.  I think that was the driving force for a long time until they could latch on to the sexual claims.
---
Many people making the same accusation is no more convincing than one kid mirroring another kid - especially in the case of a polarizing, public, and popular entertainer like Ochido.  People will lie and stretch truths; moreso they're especially likely to do it when they feel justified, have a sense of camaraderie, and who suffer no personal consequence in meting out *their* justice.  It's mob mentality --mob rule, all based on fluid personal preferences and *feelings*.
---
There *might* be something to it, but there also *might not* be something to it.  The one thing that *is* certain is that there is only suspicion and hearsay.  The failure on the part of 'haters' to provide actual proof is merely affirmation for my suspicion.  The mass-downvoting is merely the fuel to continue to vocally doubt and ridicule the idea.
---
I'm less defending Ochido on this point than I am defending a rocess that this circlejerk doesn't value.  I'd legitimately be thankful to be proven wrong with *actual* proof.
---
Here is a general killer perk tier listing:

Are you going to work on any PS4 Pro and Xbox One X enhancements?
---
System: xbox

Issue: visual
---
Description: killers and survivors won't appear on the menu screen and I can't accept gameplay invites
---
Reproduction steps: go to menu and get an invite for SWF, if the invite fails the glitch or bug should work
---
Expected result: taken back to the menu with all survivors and killer still in there place
---
Actual result : going back to the menu and seeing that all the killers and survivors just dipped
---
Screenshot: I do have a screenshot of this occuring
---
Reproduction rate: seems to occur with me only and its %100 of the time when the invite is declined
---
Well in Japan you're not supposed to have a job if you're in school so she is probably 18 so that works out nicely
---
Imagine being this lame
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been thinking but the only reason I can think of it not being him is just because it would tie in too closely to another characters lore. Maybe they want every killer to be totally separate and unique, *or* they actually want to tie one in to another. I‚Äôd love to see expanded lore though. 
---
Damn that's too bad. Hopefully it is fixed soon. 
---
Yeah, a bit. I was afraid to move too much since I had been put on the hook about 3 minutes in game and it took a while for someone to rescue, so after I got away I knew I couldn't be put on the hook again or I would die.
---
Shut up bitch ass snitch
---
This has happened to me, mostly with Myers but once with doctor (however I managed to get that close without them noticing)
---
This is so gooood :) 
---
its a poorly executed game with a poor idea lol
---
Just here covering all the guys names. ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I personally love using shadowborn, occasionally I use devour hope and sometimes bitter murmur. 
---
For add ons I use movement speed with range or both range add ons  
---
Don‚Äôt go looking, not worth looking up the jackass
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
Oh well. The advice still holds up.
---
the issue here would be that the killer acts as a host for the entire match, so how would they sort it with out bogging down the game
---
I'd have to say Spirit. Probably just because I'm not amazing at playing against her, but, I've fought the elusive P3 Nurses that seem to never miss a blink, and I gotta say, I have a harder time fighting just mid tier Spirits. Again, more than likely I'm just bad, but the passive phasing mind games are just so strong. Without addons, I'd probably say Nurse or Spirit. 
---
Is your answer is "he's more effective than Myers/Hag/Trapper because they need Ruin"?
---
I was wondering why my clip was trending, and said it was already posted. LOL!
---
Oh I‚Äôm sorry! Did you post it already? I just saw it on discord and it made me chuckle. Awesome clip bro. 
---
Could be an old video tbh, for some reason he popped up on my YouTube status thing (probably cause I watched a video to see why people call him annoying/toxic. Don't recommend doing that btw) and he was talking about streaming and asking what games he should stream and people kept saying make a new account and he was saying he wasn't going to. Might be old footage, but he's also scum so he could be making new accounts and trying to "publicize" that he isn't playing dbd.
---
I'm so glad other people had this idea. It's great :D
---
Deja...deja... deja... deja-vu!
---
I did not expect that and it was hilarious.
---
Depends on if I have a limited amount of time available that I can play. Juggling course work from my classes doesn‚Äôt always leave me hours on end to play, so with the time that I do allot myself I‚Äôd like to be able to actually play the multiplayer game I bought.
---
That being said disconnecting isn‚Äôt the most sportsman like thing, so I‚Äôm not advising on the side of doing it, but I understand why people do it against a legion. It has nothing to do with spiting the player or proving a point, I just want to have some semblance of fun when I go to play a video game.
---
soooo.. any tickets available? 
---
Then I guess you should all learn to play the game instead of playing Gen repairman sim 2019
---
Ok, from my POV and from my experience, Freddy is a lot more effective compared to any killer over all, other than Nurse and Hillbilly. 
---
God that was good! ‚ù§Ô∏èüò©üëåüèª
---
I don't think you see it my dud, he's reciting something... special
---
Send $10 via PayPal for a link to a livestream 
---
I know right?
---
Huntress and nurse are definitely the worst killers to start with because you need to know how to use their power well to win chases. Even rank 15-20s know how to camp throw pallets and run to the next one, so huntresses slow speed can be a huge hinderance if you can‚Äôt hit those shots when they are in the open.
---
I don't recall them doing anything specifically toxic, but that's exactly what I was doing. Like I said, it incredibly toxic and I did it just to make me laugh. I have no obligation to give them the hatch anyways. 
---
I remember the devs talking about each realm (map)  is a place out side time and space or something.  Not based in  physical world.  
---
Meanwhile me wishing to see a "World map" with each area tied together.  "The Center" of the map with the Lerys Institute, Preschool, Haddonfield - rounded with the Coldwind Farms and MacMillan Estates.  Little bit further away would be the Scary Shelter Woods and the Old Asylum. What about the Game and the Smelly Swamps? 
---
Anyone wanna try to make some sort of fanart map? That would be super cool to see! 
---
Is there a blank version of this template?
---
Spirit looking like she just reached into the fridge to grab some OJ but accidentally put her hand in a pot of open cream that‚Äôs gone off.
---
I read what he wrote, but my point still stands, maybe it doesn't fit here but to the people complaining about NOED.
---
r/wooooooooosh (I don't know if I added enough o's)
---
Quit being lazy minded and search this reddit or google ‚Äúsurvivor strategies against legion.‚Äù  
---
That's the worst thing you can do, you are screwing your teammates because you turn the game into basically 3v1 instead of 4v1, and it won't help you, because if you play afraid you make mistakes and will eventually die anyway.
---
And dying is not a big deal, is just a game, and you can perfectly pip dying, the same thing you can depip having escaped. The important thing is how you perform and how valuable are you to your team.
---
This is the golden rule: you should ALWAYS be doing something useful. Do gens, if the killer finds you loop him as much as possible so your teammates have time to do gens. If you see someone getting chased, do gens ASAP.
---
If you play afraid you'll never get better. Sometimes you'll be found first, sometimes not, it's just RNG depending on the map, the killer, his perks, your build, what you do, etc. You'll have bad games and good games, but just meh games won't help you get better, bad and good games will.

---
noed nurses ruin bbq with 5 blinks and ebony mori
---
I actually did, but the mods changed I I guess because they thought it was serious
---
Ohhhhh, sorry, didn't catch it there. My bad. Unpopular opinion but NOED is fair, it has room for counterplay and slows the game down by making the survivors clense totems.
---
true, but... since when rank 15-20 players care about those?
---
I do the same thing with the bahroo shirt and red shorts lol 
---
I do like it, The Spirit‚Äôs face made my day. Your Kate looks fantastic.
---
Yes, agreed
---
All these comments have made my day! Thank you so much!!!!!!!!!! 
---
If it's questionable whether someone is 18 or not you shouldn't fucking jack off to them.
---
You could keep sloppy butcher and take out ruin. It has better synergy with m&amp;a and nurses, slows the game down, and can‚Äôt be broken. Once you get good enough you won‚Äôt even need ruin.
---
Huh.
---
I don't think that's defensible but okay
---
Yes.
---
Myers is not perfect. His iconic butcher knife kill is done very differently from the film. In the film, he winds up and stabs downward into their chests. In game, he stabs upward into the upper abdomen/lower chest and wiggles the knife around. I want them to change to the pin-to-the-wall stab he does.
---
Very clever.
---
Yea, another unpopular opinion is that gens need to take a little but longer to repair. Personally almost every killer build needs ruin as a core perk for the reason that gens get done pretty fast.
---
So be it.
---
FINALLY SOMEONE SAYS IT.
---
If she was in highschool when she died, you shouldn't fucking draw nsfw of her. Period.
---
I'd rather not have a killer based off of mental illness. There's already enough media misrepresenting mental illness.

So you can't accept the fact that I've created a discussion about it because some already exist? You must really hate searching YouTube, seeing multiple results from a single search. I came here for discussion and have only run into adult children who (mostly) offer no dialogue other than name calling, or aggressive replies. It's kind of ridiculous that people (who I presume are adults) can't have a civil discussion about VIDEO GAMES w/out getting riled up/upset. 
---
yoink
---
Yep, we will see what happend. 
---
He is a really toxic player and his teammate in the video too, saying things like "the piggy is bad, don't play it if you are TRASH", so how the kilelr can get better if it doesn't play? really stupid comments ahah
---
Nothing to defend, all you are saying is that it is not defensible, but you haven't given any reason to defend it.
---
I have an idea, start playing Legion and see what works for capable players who don‚Äôt quit on themselves...
---
Not very democratic to ban something just because people don't like it. Especially if the thing isn't illegal or immoral or what not :/
---
Be the change you want to see in the world.
---
*BHVR would like to know your location*
---
You had to put the one killer that can actually see them by stalking xd
---
No Piggy, Oh well. 101st karma as well
---
One of the problems with Freddy is that in order to be good with him, it all pretty much just comes down to fundamentals. If you are a good mechanical player, than you will most likely be a good Freddy. But fundamentals apply to every killer. It is extremely difficult to be "good" at using Freddy's ability. You can use the dream transition period to line up a free hit, but other than that, it's just a point and click ability. Freddy isn't the easiest character in the game to pick up and play, but due to his low skill ceiling, he's one of the least rewarding. I will admit that because he is so reliant on fundamentals, playing Freddy makes you better at playing other killers.
---
From the videos I've seen, escaping Legion has more to do with luck than skill. Good Legion &gt; Good Survivor 
---
Piggy gets her own drawing entirely c;&lt; which I‚Äôm working quite extensively on. üê∑üê∑ 
---
Lmfao
---
&gt;Never heard of anyone getting banned for that.
---
A friend was banned for changing the "saved" file and it was permanent.
---
I appreciate all that context and you sharing your perspective. But still, I'm asking you directly which killers you feel that Freddy is more effective than on average. I know what Freddy is good and not so good at, I still don't know which killers you rank him above in general. 
---
Second chance: you beg the entity for a second while running crying like a baby. When at the brink of death get teleported to where you spawned at the start of the trial. Chancing of killer DC 50%/75%/100%.
---
"WAIT WAIT GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE"
---
My best friend: a big metal knife pops in your hand called DS. By hitting a giant skill check You stab the the killer and he goes in a coma for 3 gens 4 gens and 5 gens
---
"GG EZ"
---
You mad bro: after slamming a pallet do a butt dance to make the killer cry for 5 10 and 15 second
---
"Squeak squeak squeak"
---
She actually floats
---
Yeah, I also looked at the comments on the status he had posted. Oh lordy was it cringy 
---
Ignore them
---
I don‚Äôt think you are cut out for multiplayer games.  Especially team games. Perhaps the Resident Evil 2 remake? 
---
Well I said he is more effective than all killers except Hillbilly and Nurse.
---
Stolen memes are great
---
how did you play in alpha
---
Well, I'm Diamond rank in League of Legends season 9, so I don't know about the validity of your argument. Again, none of your comments are productive. You could try and explain why Legion isn't OP, or try to suggest something that maybe hasn't been mentioned, but you just want to be negative. I hope you're not this way in person too.
---
I‚Äôd say his face in character selection??? Not sure either lmao
---
If they‚Äôve done gens or didn‚Äôt hide all game to prolong it longer than it should take. Or if they managed to not piss me off in some way lol I do give a fair amount of leniency tho
---
She looks more unique than most of the original survivors, plus we don't have many tattooed survivors.
---
Stridor is nullified by iron will as far as I know
---
Don‚Äôt play the game if you‚Äôre to quit it when facing a killer
---
Yes legion is annoying,but you‚Äôre more annoying than anyone who play legion if you dc
---
Any killer that has RNG going on with their ability is not going to be consistently more effective than killers who don't.. It's as simple as that. 
---
What I do think you can say is that Freddy has arguably the strongest end game potential as part of his base kit (until gates are open, then he might have the worst). But overall effectiveness? No.
---
Like, Spirit is much more generally effective. She has good snowball potential, can confuse survivors, end chases quickly, can threaten gen progress really well with grabs (no, you don't need Prayer Beads to accomplish this) and a strong capability to force a hard 3 gen, and has a severely underrated basement game. Nothing she does relies on RNG being favorable like with Freddy
---
Good bot. :)

This is why Rin is the BEST GIRL. (Sorry, Manda)

Good Job! I would have liked to see TheKingDBD here! But I am so happy Tru3 and Edgar are part of them! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Found the 12 y/o
---
Thats really twisty
---
I actually do well against Legion. I have way more trouble with a Nurse, Spirit or Billy. Then again I don‚Äôt give up on myself. I‚Äôm not here to try to convince you to not selfishly DC because you can‚Äôt adapt to Legion. I‚Äôm just  hoping you realize you are the problem and can become better. 
---
Freddy's 7 second mindgame is nice, but many times I would prefer to just be able to hit the survivor.
---
Iron is silent,so even though you can hear better, you can‚Äôt hear silence
---
To be fair, that is the meta at higher ranks. End chases quickly or lose.
---
Zombina is my personal best girl from monster masamune 
---
Yikes lol
---
I‚Äôd say contact them about it,and if they say yes but you end up banned contact them again?
---
The man in gauze, the man in gauze. RAAAAMSEEEEEEEEEES!
---
Iron will supresses 100% of the audio, but stridor makes it 50% louder so if you use stridor you will be able to hear injured survivors WITH iron will but at half the volume, and without iron will at 150% the normal volume.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Oh hey, yet another Legion hate post. Yawn.
---
A link to google search bar?
---
Ist that the Chapter 12 Killer?
---
Found the toxic survivor main
---
why are ochido fanboys so sensitive lmao
---
Ayyyy I've got xbox too!
---
Your only response was to 'get gud' and 'scrub scrub scrub!!!!111!'. I assumed that meant you had some kind of information detailing how someone would have a better chance at beating Legion. Sorry for the misunderstanding and thinking you had something productive to add to the convo.  
---
Or you can do totems and not gen rush
---
It‚Äôs been like this for months. They just flood the main page and annoy people. 
---
Considering how often the game fucks you or someone else over cause of BS, I would say every killer is RNG somewhat based. You can get fucked over as any killer. OFC there are games where RNG is gonna fuck you over as Freddy, but that is very unlikely. Like I said 800 hours. Plus let's say you do get fucked up by RNG, you just right click again, and if you fuck up again, you right click again.
---
it is the chapter 12 that they copyrighted from the movie
---
Lol 
---
Pre-buff you couldn't place traps in the same way you do know. It simply took too long without add ons
---
After buff it was more common to see a hag using her traps to the full extend since it doesn't take her an eternity to put all of them down
---
Someone would have a better chance of beating Legion if they didn‚Äôt disconnect at first sight... 
---
Someone would have better chance of beating Legion if they researched what builds are good against Legion...
---
Someone would have a better chance of beating Legion if the recorded and reviewed their matches against Legion...
---
Someone would have a better chance of beating Legion if they found a survive with friends group...
---
Someone would have a better chance of beating Legion if they played the freaking game...

good, I'll start saving already.. if it's particularly enjoyable, I'll throw in a other 10..

Technically everyone in the Entitys realm is dead but it doesn't stop Dwight from being thicc af.
---
Did you think the sudden, fast beeping meant it was about to throw you a party?
---
This is sick!! Can I ask what doll you used?
---
That is a fun game and a good anime.
---
Its the Antiquarian from Darkest Dungeon! Finally the crossover we all asked for!!
---
Because they are white knighting for a pussy with no possibility for poon. They then get sexually pent up and get overly testy over time resulting in this elegant specimen right here.
---
Absolutely fascinating.
---
Their portrait in the character selection

Oh OK thanks. Then why tf would they have that option lmao
---
I never said I was jacking off to it, I was just saying that she is more than likely she is 18.

Your art style is so cute, you should do more!

She was in uni.

And the Survivor is the kid from the Cirice music video

Yes stridor does let you hear someone if they are running iron Will

Are you serious?

What is this, bizarre world? Reverse land?

I didn't come here for someone to point out that the Devs do anything at all, while other Devs would just walk away and tell us to go fuck ourselves.

Thank you :)

üëÅüëÑüëÅ
---
Oh, that sucks :( wanted anime versions of survivors
---
Everytime someone brings up that Hag video I just kinda side eye because that video didn't make her look great at all either.  In fact in game? She was the only one who was doing shitty toxic stuff like hitting them on the hook.
---
Jen and friends running flashlights and meta perks isn't toxic.  What is toxic is the killer they were facing getting frustrated at that and beginning to smack them on the hook over and over.
---
And that's a problem in this community in general. Everyone is too fast to label the wrong shit toxic.  It is not toxic to play the game with what is handed to you. SWF, flashlights, Moris, NOED, DS, etc.
---
What is truly toxic is when you're a piece of shit to another player and set out to make their experience miserable with mechanics in the game not intended.  Teabagging excessive, hook BMing, etc.
---
Im sure you‚Äôre drowning in pussy my guy
---
Fuck it. Shirtless skins for everybody! =D
---
imagine thinking that just because you suck at the game that it‚Äôs because the killer is bad, definitely not you
---
Where did you find it?
---
It's great on legion though. It's really fun to fuck with people with it. It doesn't have to last all game, just long enough to get a few hooks
---
Honestly I just wish it wasn't so pervasive here. Like I'm into horror, not little anime girls with their creepy LolI panties.
---
On google
---
Helmet needs to be on every Dwight. 
---
You already lose bp for proxy to hooked survivor
---
&gt; shouldn't the players intimidated by the solo queue get that advice? They're the ones relying on chat programs.
---
Fucking thank you
---
This is fake, wraith skips leg day 
---
You make it sound like I never tried to play against him. On the contrary, I've played against him well over 100 times. I've beat him plenty of times. The reason I choose not to play against him until I find out this mystery strategy for beating him, is because every single time I escaped against him was luck. It was never because I juked him, or outplayed him. It's usually me finding an escape hatch after my team dies because no one is working on generators. 
---
I've found ways to juke every other killer in the game, I just can't find any real exploit in Legion's gameplay the way there are with other killers (i.e. other killers are punished with stun delays if they have stronger/OP abilities/attacks).
---
I'm a level 6 survivor this season, and have been rank 1 in the past. 332 hours played. It's not like I haven't tried.
---
There is a sub dedicated to dbd porn so technically it should be on there instead
---
&gt; because they just want to play with their friends?
---
classic thought terminating cliche. Nice dood

It‚Äôs for their safety! Super easy to hit their head in lockers.

Fucking neon feng can hide on swamp that map is so hard to see on

I was already at the end of my timer, so it was already beeping at me, so I thought I could make it out. 
---
When you hear that someone is in highschool, do you automatically assume that they are a mature adult? Or that maybe they are Still In Highschool And Could Quite Possibly Be A Minor??
---
Messaging teamates
---
You said in a different comment that you rated them on their ability to change the game?
---
Ruin is S tier yet it‚Äôs a perk that requires no skill to use, you literally just equip it and it does the work for you. 
---
The tier list is... eh, there‚Äôs just way too many perks that are in the wrong tiers and even you don‚Äôt seem to have any form of consistency regarding how you placed the perks in various tiers. 
---
All and all, because I don‚Äôt want to only give negative feedback, I do respect the fact that you didn‚Äôt try to equally spread perks out across tiers because tier lists with an equal amount of anything in each tier are usually really bad ones.
---
He‚Äôs a special boi that need special protection. 
---
I will legit let any Dwight with helmet live. 
---
This man speaks truth, and honestly the reasons he listed are why I really don't want him reworked.
---
No but 12th graders are 18 year old usually. 
---
True is not toxic at all, neither is ardetha or scott. Neither is Tyde I don't think.
---
[Template for other bored people.](https://i.imgur.com/6sxIMx4.png)
---
No clue why I get downvoted for simply saying the truth. The guy actually said he was spreading information he was unsure of. There's nothing more I said or wanted to say. And it's true if you have read his first, unedited post. 
---
Those. Exactly. No effort.
---
You're being so disingenuous and drastic. No one said it's "the end of the world" I said it makes him less effective that killers who don't have that RNG issue
---
&gt; Why not?
---
Your "argument" was some bs about all killers somewhat being RNG reliant becasue of issues like lag or whatever *but that has nothing to do with the abilities*
---
I dunno why Freddy players are defensive 
---
Good luck to ya bud! 
---
Yeah, this one was a Disney Store Premium Rey üëç
---
It's better than Pop, especially with Sloppy. I run it on Trapper (normal TR), and it's been a staple on Billy forever before the Spirit Fury + Enduring combo (another normal TR killer). The amount of people I find Self Caring in the corner leading to free downs is actually insane.
---
And it still takes around 30 seconds to recover from dying, as well as someone to actually pick you up. It's all map pressure that adds up while you snowball.
---
You realise, it's slow because its coded in such a way that its cpu intensive. Its got nothing to do with the graphics. It's just weak console cpus not being able to brute force a reasonable frame rate. 
---
Google Images?
---
Let my guess, iridescent heads ? 
---
Three o's
---
Yep
---
Brown shirt Claudettes on shelter woods
---
Usually. Not always. You could be fapping to a 16/17 year old. Do you see what I mean? An educated guess doesn't make up for the fact that the person you are jacking off to -art or otherwise- could be a minor.
---
It'll be more like the pc version. 
---
Why do you wanna cosplay the most hated killer in the game ? 
---
He takes like 4 hits to down people. I usually don't get any kills with him i may not use him right? In matches against him ive escaped a few times. It just depends i guess on the player. 
---
oh god rubberbanding when blinking and chainsawing. i swear i'll start hurting myself if that happens
---
THIS DELETE ! 
---
Nope, just calling in from experience. But it shouldn't take too much to notice it. You gotta learn to take life at its own pace. Get yourself out of these dead end situations and learn to stop blindly idolizing your idols. Some can be absolute shitstains and don't deserve their fame. Just because you like them doesn't mean you need to turn a blind eye to their less than ethical interactions.
---
But this beautiful creature seems to have lost sight of the horizon. Bloody shame. That will be a damper on its success in the later weeks.
---
I'm just saying, either adjust and adapt or come to reddit and bitch about something that is not going to get fixed and still get your ass kicked online by these survivors.
---
Chose.
---
Every picture in Google Images has a link attached yo it, if you click it it will take you to the source, hopefully you can find the artist there
---
Thank you
---
In Europe and USA states minors are below age 16 usually everywhere sooo. But I get your point. And I wasn't fapping to anything.
---
You can get a decent one within the 100 dollar range on amazon
---
Well more like the entire map would be a factory not just a small building.
---
I only play killer for the dailies boyo. Survivor main, nice try tho.
---
It‚Äôs always great when people quote The Survivor‚Äôs Bible Of Made Up Fake Rules Of Salt. 
---
What
---
I'm really excited about this new updates 
---
ARN
---
I'd feel like I bought a survivor who is OP. Kinda like killers drop glitching players who use decisive strike. Hitting a person 4 times sounds like a lot, until you take into account practically sprints after you, and he can vault planks and windows. If you are in his sights, you will probably be hooked unless he's the type to just run around bleeding everyone out. I.e. there's no real way to juke him other than a solid plank stun, or a flashlight. 
---
Someone on the dbd reddit with common sense, who would've thunk it.
---
If you have to carry the team of random, boosted survivors, you have to make a choice:
---
Die, so they can escape.
---
Or
---
Die like a bitch, crying about how you deserve to survive over them.
---
Do you know how horror movies work? The strong carry always dies for the team. 
---
REE
---
Yeah there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that just make sure you don‚Äôt mind other killers calling bad survivors baby survivors. It‚Äôs worth noting though that being loose with an offensive term on one side because you‚Äôre okay with both offensive terms for both sides doesn‚Äôt exempt you from being a dick.
---
If for whatever reason, you do get offended by ‚Äúbaby survivor‚Äù and want people to stop, then make sure you realize that calling people ‚Äúbaby killer‚Äù isn‚Äôt a nice thing either and if you‚Äôre going to advocate against one then you need to advocate against the other.
---
This isn‚Äôt even specific to you or dbd, this just kinda goes for any setting where a double standard may emerge, and I honestly just kind of felt like putting that out there for whatever reason even if it felt a little out of place.
---
As a Legion Expert, I approve this suggestion
---
As someone who mainly plays killer, you're not a great sport... When I see someone DC I feel awful that the team got cheated out of a fair match.
---
Kind of like 99% of killers I see who drop glitch players who use decisive strike. Not very good sports. Literally the only killer I bail on is Legion. I will play against anything else. 
---
I got to educate a new friend that you can hop out the hatch with one on last night. It was so cute. He was spectating and his NO! sounded so real when I hopped into the hatch lol
---
I spent alot of thought on this and I think it turned out nice.
---
It's already rated M so why not?
---
Chill with the elitism, miracles can be done with good optimization, look at what breath of the wild runs on with no stuttering or frame drops.
---
The major factor in what separates Freddy's is tactical skill.
---
due to his aura reading Freddy has the best map awareness in the game, no other killer can compare to it, thus a defining factor is Freddy's ability to use the info to his advantage, and micro manage 4 survivors at once.
---
Freddy doesn't play like any other m1 killer due to how his power (ironically vs how most Freddy's actually play) rewards not tunneling and spreading pressure out between survivors to stall and keeping tabs on each of them to drain pallets and create deadzones, which you can then capitalize on if you see a survivor wander in, which makes Freddy the one killer who *benefits* from dropping chases to spread pressure.
---
Usually you end up not properly chasing the people you sleep half the time, you can just spook them into dropping a pallet on you and then ditch them as they now have to wake up without SC and are one pallet down, as you look for someone else as the guy you left wanders around for a gen uselessly for awhile, or just sleep them and leave them totally since just m2 ing them puts down stall and pressure.
---
Its good to look around during chases if multiple people are asleep, as you can keep track of where and how they are waking up, if they bow down that means someone else is helping them, in which if you think the current chase isn't going to end soon you might want to beeline them to get 2 free sleeps in, and the guy you left confused af, if they break out nearby on a gen/SC you can wander to them and put them back under then quickly resume the chase (the original guy likely is trying to SC out, but he cant hide cos Freddy vision so he's not going anywhere)
---
If someone breaks out in your face, its an opportunity to transition mind game them again.
---
Nurse's Calling gets you free hits. Pop gives you a little extra time on gens. They both create map pressure which was the entire point of my post, and downing wounded survivors before they know you have NC or a chance to start a chase is way more map pressure than a little extra gen time.
---
OP's issue is clearly map pressure, and my advice was aimed at helping him create more. 
---
I disagree about NC being overrated; what you can do with an information perk is entirely up to the player using it. You can even *disguise* the fact you have NC in a lot of situations, to the point where them knowing about it or not might never come, or be too late to matter.
---
It's a similar situation to Bond; a lot of people sleep on it but the information it provides you as survivor is game changing if you know how to use it right.
---
Pop is extremely overrated, I will agree. It's a perk that is very conditional (chase, down, hook and then hope there's a gen nearby worth using it on), and forces you to waste time not looking for survivors by having to kick a gen or it's a wasted slot.
---
&gt; you're still banking on the survivors screwing up
---
Yes, that's how DBD is played the majority of the time. Due to the strength of maps, the way windows/pallets work, and the fact that Killers are playing on a time crunch, you will always be banking on survivor mistakes. The idea is to be able to take greatest advantage of them in order to swing the game.
---
Any killer (not named Nurse) against 4 survivors playing every tile perfectly is a lost game. That's just how it is.
---
A Doll, you could earn a lot of money with "Punch the Legion" on Gaming Events XD 
---
I would find something better than pop goes the weasel.  When it works it works well, but it‚Äôs not always going to be helpful. 
---
The tutorial doesn't have a host to heartbeat to, its a smaller map(IIRC) and has no perks(again IIRC), there's no need to synchronize between other users so no need to cap your fps.
---
Remember when users were getting stuck in basement? This is assumption mixed with what I remember the problem was caused by, but basically users who uncapped their fps were getting stuck. This is most likely because of the heartbeat being locked to fps. It's fine with horizontal movement because the host would just take your position from whatever heartbeat it gets first, ignore the rest and interpolate your position and animation. This is fine.
---
However with vertical movement we had physics involved and very subtle physics at that. I'm guessing their heart beat handled the physics with the engine so when the host got 3 to 6x the information it needed, it just used the first one. However the client is already halfway up the steps and it has told the host this. The host is updating 3 to 6x slower, so it just takes the second heartbeat instead of the 6th. Oops we are desynced. This isn't a problem for horizontal movements because we can interpolate missing information. Vertical movement is different because if we snap the character to the wrong spot, we'll they just clipped through the map. Thus we teleport them to their last good position.
---
Most likely this very update is because theres already a lot of stuff going on to handle at 30fps, so 60fps would double the work per second. Thus theoretically they need to remove half or more of the work from the ticker to compensate.
---
I thought this was just one of those random vids of a survivor getting hit.

The bottom right it def a reference to Kill La Kill
---
We are always defensive cause we have to be. Everytime I get into this discussion, people always pull the RNG card. YES Freddy is somewhat RNG based, which you can argue makes him less effective. But it is very rare that you will actually get fucked over by it, which no one seems to take into consideration. Same with Nurse, a lot of maps have random dead zones that fuck you over by not being able to blink, but she is still the best as she can quickly recover form it, which Freddy also can
---
Not really, at all. Its one if the biggest tropes in animes since like the 60s.
---
What hurt the most was that it was a dwight. Dwights like him make the rest of us dwights look bad
---
Yeah but if people locked dodge the bbq or distortion then you can easily get confused on if survivors are close or far. I see a lot of survivors locker dodging bbq now 
---
Is this pig orgy

It's rng, there is more than one box

I disagree with David King. It's he who gets into the hard spots, Ace however is addicted to gambling.

Oh, thank you
---
Thanks pal! :D
---
I don't run meta perks. I have a perk for dealing with the killers who give me the most issues. Self Care to wake up. Calm Spirit for doctor. Quick and Quiet for Legion (doesn't work if they 5+ IQ, but still good when a killer isn't the brightest), and then Adrenaline, for killers camping my hook or chasing me when the last gen pops
---
Well, I don't run the meta perk build, I mean
---
How am i being an elitist? Im being realistic. Skyrim looks better than Breath of the wild imo, and it runs good on Switch. Botw looks kinda like Fortnite, and that runs 60 fps on a ps4 pro.
---
Lol I've literally seen this on GOOGLE IMAGES

https://youtu.be/3xYVuNzKAF4

"Douchebat" is a pretty stupid excuse imo because zubat always plays like a dick lol. He always plays omegablink nurse and ALWAYS slugs even if it the game is still heavily in his favor - "Oh shit it's been 15 seconds since the game started and I still haven't won? better 4 man slug"

Third Succ is actually great on Legion. 
---
Dwight is top tier survivor change my mind
---
dude i main clown (p3 i'm cool i know) and i NEVER get to play against him because no one knows how to play him. so when i get to play against one it's soooo fun :D
---
Your perks are just fine. I like running Rancor or Bitter Murmur as well, especially when I didn‚Äôt have BBQ on her. 
---
I also love doing a totem protector build with Thrill of the Hunt, Devour Hope, Ruin, and Haunted Grounds. Bit meme-y but so fun.
---
When you can‚Äôt afford a tier list maker.
---
Well most brute killers are developed like that in Dead by Daylight, its not a common but, it would be terrifying to see a tall brute person chase you
---
Stream Dad gives me hope for the level of toxicity on the game.

On the other hand several people on that list are as toxic as they come. 
---
[I think that's Frank.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aw8zzj/custom_12_frank/)
---
Why not Ghostbusters?
---
Yeessss!
---
I love going against a Freddy and Wraith, especially with how rare they are to come across. It is actually really fun to die against your main (even better to survive) when you pull out all you know against them. :D
---
* No calls to action against another player.

Bing bong shit went wrong!

Um, two things about this: R34 content is under the widespread idea "Everything portrayed is 18+, despite how they look" and I heard first used on the Dead Meat Podcast: "CW logic: Doesn't matter how old they should be, they are played by 20 somethings or 30 somethings."
---
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that grunts of pain and breathing while in pain are considered different things, therefore, Strider and Iron Will do not affect each other. Strider might actually be good if it boosted the sound of grunting.

I feel like Dwight was depressed. He should be higher. I thought Claudette hated her family. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. I just remember her friends wondering where she went.
---
Adept Legion is easy to get right now.. everybody just DC's.
---
I run surveillance, sloppy butcher, thanatophobia, and nurses calling. 
---
I use the yellow add on to increase lunge charge speed and reduce miss lunge cooldown and usually an extra trap or whatever you feel like running. 
---
It works well if you like going for ambushes because you can know when someone goes back to a gen, hear them from farther away at the start of the game, and when someone is hurt you can see them with nurses and try to ambush them to down them.  It can help to ambush attack one survivor on a gen and if there was another then to chase that one for a hit, hopefully see the first one healing and crouch to switch targets, keeping multiple people hurt with thana helps slow down gens (not much) and slow healing with sloppy butcher.  
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the most optimal build but if you like to go for ambushes and don‚Äôt mind not using Ruin it‚Äôs pretty fun. 
---
You could swap thana for ruin and surv for discordance. 
---
Mangled trap add ons could be good with it as well or a way to swap sloppy out for something else.  
---
Pig is awesome that is all.

I'll send you a link in a sec. If anyone asks, just tell them neon sent you. I'm one of the admins.

I mean, I still say that the BDSM Huntress pic was much worse about this, but then again, we had Shirtless David around this time, so we went "You know, I would main huntress if I had Buff Huntress"
---
Pretty good job so far
---
WALUIGI!

Is there a discord?

Seasoned to perfection
---
I honestly don't understand the idea of  tea bagging in DBD. It's a form of disrespect and then they get mad if they get faced camped. I don't play much killer but I would probably find it annoying. And as a survivor it's not really worth getting a higher risk of getting face camped.
---
Omg that perfectly captured ‚ÄûI‚Äòve been a bad girl‚Äú- face :D
---
this is so true. i just got to rank 1 killer a day ago and during my grind i got CLAPPED by a rank 14swf, but the rank 1 survs were so easy. the amount of smurfs and de pips are ridiculous. i cant imagine being a new killer now a days.
---
Are any of your custom figures for sale? I love them! 
---
I'd say the gpus are mid tier. I've got an x and pro and they are good enough. Of course the majority run at 30fps because they aren't exclusives and need to have a ceiling that the devs can work towards for. Multi platform.
---
However dbd can most definitely (with more efficient code) run this game at 60fps. But it IS the cpu holding this game back at its current state. Not so much the gpu
---
there really isn't
---
Don't that group tea bag loads and go off on super toxic insulting rants top the killers who win against them in end game chat?
---
It happens a lot surprisingly,many of my games people love to run to their death with the RBT,despite the loud beeping noises.
---
/u/not_Queen_bhvr is it also possible to update the sensitivity on console ? On the killer side of things it feels like it's not strong enough. 
---
I enjoy playing Freddy and go on stretches where I'll play a lot of him. And every time I inevitably get into a game where every one of his weaknesses get exploited. 
---
WHAT DID I SAY?!
---
IMO it should show over or under ur char what perks and addons your using, ofc only the survivors could see it. There just isn‚Äôt enough time to coordinate with randoms and I don‚Äôt want to wait longer for that streamer jerk to talk to his chat while we all wait for him to ready up. 
---
Yes and you're not invited sweetheart
---
this game is really cancer the higher you go. i play killer and i'll have a 4k match completely fair, no camping or anything and they get so salty. calling me a bitch and saying i'm trash or whatever. just ignore them or leave early 
---
When is Chapter 10 and/or 11 supposed to come out?
---
I make low quality shit posts because they make me giggle and I hope they make others giggle too. I am not good with Photoshop or editing like that so I can't make other posts. I personally love the low quality shit posts though
---
Normally my feelings would be hurt but you said sweetheart so I feel a little better.
---
Correct! My friend was streaming, yes
---
You tried? 
---
Why that doesn't work, tho? I mean, I only thought theoretically. 
---
I have maybe seen EDGAR do it.  I have never seen Jen intentionally leave hateful shit in post game chat. And I have legit seen her playing with Edgar when HE has done it and on her own stream you can hear her going ''EDGAR! EDGAR! STOP IT. THAT'S TOXIC." 
---
So....downvote all you want, but you're living kind of in a delusion of hatred if you think it's a completely normal thing they do ALL the time or that it's ALL of them and they're everything with DbD and causing it  themselves.
---
Yeah I've been playing since it came out, and I want the grind to be less even just for myself, trying to get every teachable is fucking insane. Just throw as some extra cosmetics like last time (preferably better ones tho I literally never use the legacy shit) or give us some shards depending on our level and all will be cool.
---
she was really popular on her botany blog and they were wondering where she was after she disappeared, as for family I'm not really sure how she felt.
---
I‚Äôm thinking with the DS change perhaps their power does something with the obsession changing thing that‚Äôs coming with DS.  Don‚Äôt ask em how though lol
---
How recently, sis? Because the past few streams? She hasn't even been on DbD. She's been playing Stardew Valley and before that it was Dying Light. 
---
I've seen her teabag, but often those are in matches where she KNOWS the killer. And she knows a lot of the killers in the upper ranks because she kind of plays the game that much.
---
I'd argue the only one on this list that I watch enough that I could say is actually toxic is Edgar.  I love the dude, but he started off as very much in the vein of ''it's all for fun." and evolved into someone who actually is quite toxic in game and and out even when it's not for one of his bits like Daily Dose or whatever he calls the thing he does with Michael Myers.
---
I always lag as killer
---
Do you like having to wase time, what about getting tunneled, maybe having literally 0 counterplay? Stealth loops, forget about them! If you answered NO to any of these questions, too bad you'll still find a Legion and everyone will DC.
---
No offense but all these posts saying that are making me cringe. Yeah, he's just *so* cool and above all that sponsorship, extra access, mutual trust, and quality. I'm sure he would *never* do it if asked because he's just above all those adult, real world working relationships...
---
I... Literally said that you can have whatever opinion on him in the post
---
&gt;Humor is subjective. I can't say you don't think he's funny
---
I just pointed out that ochid0 is not objectively a funny person, objectively meaning from a neutral, logical standpoint. From your personal beliefs and sense of humor, he can be as funny as you want him to be, that's your decision, and neither I nor anyone else can influence it
---
I find it ironic that you consider us naive and innocent for not liking what you like, even though those are traits of a child, and you're throwing a very childish tantrum over my and many others distaste for him
---
You‚Äôd think I was Leatherface. I was Pig. Just happened to down the first next to the basement lol. And yeah, this was rank reset so I guess that‚Äôs a bit of an excuse for their sakes.
---
Ignoring the post is talking about face camping, not chasing a survivor 
---
Short matches aren‚Äôt as fun though and you don‚Äôt get enough BP for them!
---
But with The Shape I‚Äôve hooked some one got to tier 3 and downed the other survivors in less than a minute. That was a crazy match. 
---
The Game?
---
trapper hates indoors too
---
Wow I wish BHVR would make something like this.
---
They will tell you that they do not actively ban for that, but if you get flagged by EAC and EAC bans you the devs will not help you to get unbanned. 
---
I think my way of learning this game was reading all the text about every character and their powers since I had no friends and went Killer main. Needless to say, I had no surprises as a survivor 
---
Thanks, I appreciate the rundown especially the vertical vs horizontal and heartbeat analogy.
---
shit I forgot about that bit...  I just wanted some funny bits in the list, I originally had her up with Jeff and Adam but I took her down because their fathers both died, but moved her down, guess I'm just biased :|
---
The soup is dry!
---
I do, just not often.
---
For Legion we need the other three in randomized outfits to come running out to stab frenzy the victim like they did the Janitor in their story. 
---
You overestimate bhvr
---
I have to oppress the gamer.
---
Boy oh boy. Can't wait to get palled stunned from 50 feet away, rather than the usual 25 feet away. If those hitboxes weren't already broken, they sure will be now. I still find it ironic that survivors complain about killer hitboxes, but for some reason, those pallets which literally stun you from around the corner, had proper hitboxes for a short time, and was immediately reverted
---
remembers me of [[this]](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a8t38h/when_you_play_on_your_alt_account_with_actual/) 
---
It was February 23rd. 
---
And yes I agree he is pretty toxic.  He rails against camping when he plays survivor yet it's perfectly ok for him to do it because 'memes'.
---
I'm still learning, myself. Trying to populate the game with another Clown. lol
---
You had no clue there are letters and a @ symbol underneath the words Dead by Daylight on the photo?
---
DamnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnN! Good Oinkin' job! O7ink!
---
Legion is like nurse but without the skill requirement to have no counterplay in a chase. They just feel really unfun to play against and as. They really only provide killer mains that have a hard time ranking up a chance to get bloodpoints and easier rank ups.
---
The mending that their frenzy creates on hits is just annoying and if they are running a Frank's Mixtape or using a moonwalk exploit to make the bleedout timer tick down it turns into tunnel city. Most people still dc if they see legion despite how easy it is to escape playing against them because of how annoying it is to face one.
---
&lt;3
---
I hate when I play against spirit. It‚Äôs never legendary. She‚Äôs the best killer in the right hands. 
---
Not sure why he's getting downvote.. but you can build a pc for 500, almost the same price as a ps4.
---
Justice was served.
---
No, I don't, I am being devil's advocate here. I can see both sides, and honestly, the Internet is the fucking internet you overly presumptuous prick. People have fetishes that we might not like, but what can we do? Scream and cry like a child when we see something we don't like? 
---
Check your NAT TYPE.  It has to be open to connect with everyone, if it isn‚Äôt you can only connect with other mediocre or closed people. 
---
Re start your modem if it‚Äôs closed.  Try to look up how to do a port forward as well .
---
That‚Äôs not voice chat that‚Äôs proximity chat.
---
&gt;as though you somehow have moral authority, and that you can say whatever you want about us, or our distaste for him, but if we dislike something you like, we're supposed to keep shut about it
---
That's right and i didn't even dropped the massive downvotes by myself üòâüòâ
---
Very fair how people just have an answer to everything. You'll excuse me if i can argue as much as you caus' i'm still French, but even though, you'll always be right uh? And by the way, now i don't care anymore; say anything you want, i won't give a fuck. Ochido is, i admit, a very toxic person, but he's beforehand a guy who cares about his YouTube channel and his subscribers. He knows he has a bad behaviour, but it's his nature, and the channel is made. Try to understand, please.
---
Good night
---
Ok then. Proximity chat. 
---
It‚Äôs not chat, it‚Äôs ‚Äòvoice monologue‚Äô
---
On the other hand, survivors at that rank run past pallets like there's no tomorrow, and have no idea how to use any form of loop. It's pretty unlikely that a killer will be looped at that rank, simply because survivors basically run in straight lines
---
This particular "fetish" hurts minors so, yeah, I'm gonna fucking scream and cry. Play devil's advocate for a pedo. Good for you. Might be time to revaluate your life choices.
---
I love playing against Nurse, the mind game potential is fantastic. I usually play SWF so it's especially fun watching my friends get fucked by the Nurse because they don't know how she plays like I do. Some of my most fun games right there.
---
You must be a rank 20 to think this list is accurate. As a rank 1 survivor main, I totally disagree with this list
---
Licensed survivors and killers are linked through the lore of their respective movies. Examples are Laurie and Michael Myers, Quintin and Freddy Krueger, and David Tapp and Amanda Young.
---
Original characters, those created by BHVR, don't have any ties with any killers directly, but some survivors and killers may have ties to a certain map, an example would be Nea and The Nurse, Nea being dared to tag Crotus Prenn Asylum with her graffiti, and the Nurse having worked there.
---
What I was referring to with botw is how much it has to render, from high points you can see most of the map.
---
Jeff partied at ormond. Same place that legion flexed on some fools 
---
I like the mask and Gru, well done!
---
Genesis Alpha One is indie title and runs at 60 fps, only made by 3 people as well.
---
Whether or not you believe the pedo claims he wasn‚Äôt hated so much for teabagging, moreover for using glitches in the game to avoid being killed. Also he‚Äôs been banned for ban evasion in the past. He‚Äôs also tried breaking up a DBD stream couple which is another reason for him being hated as well as sicked his fanbase on YouTubers. I fully understand not wanting to say he is a pedo without him being investigated as it can ruin someone‚Äôs life but if he truly is a pedo, downplaying the victims stories just lets him get away with it as well as encourage others. It‚Äôs hard to tell without pictures of well the pictures but that‚Äôs too far even if the face and body parts and name are blurred out 
---
Is all you do repost art directly from Google without getting a source or permission for free karma 
---
Using perks and items isn't toxic though.
---
ok, ;)
---
dwight x bloodhound ultimate
---
Freddy is better than pig and below if you know how to play him.
---
And I love pig, but I can only slow the game down as long as I have traps.
---
Freddy is invisible and sneaks up on people like pig. Pig you can see but not hear, Fred you can hear but not see.
---
Freddy also has his invisibility during dream transition for mind games, which can be used at short loops like piggy's ambush dash.
---
Freddy has much more map knowledge than pig and can use that to catch people off guard.
---
TL;DR: Freddy is better than Pig / Myers / Wraith / Doctor / Trapper / LF. But he is below anyone who has anti loop capability ( Nurse / Spirit / Billy / Hag / Clown / Huntress / Legion )
---
I actually really like legion and his ability but i do believe he needs a rework because right now you could simply get and easy 1 hit and then you moonwalk till they need to mend or go down
---
Not gonna bother reading, GIMME THE PICTURE
---
What were you trying to post?
---
Pig's Map is kind of an abandoned factory but I would like all of the other ones and maybe somehow a better factory. (I was writing this by itself but then I found you comment and I have to agree)
---
Amanda now! 
---
Oink oink...
---
For the record, Leather Face is the least effective killer.
---
Freddy has map knowledge and stalling that puts him miles above LF's simple instadown.
---
Cant find where it says camping can you show me.
---
Well of course you don't have to give them the hatch but specifically taunting them and being toxic is uncalled for. I'd bet you would still complain if a bunch of survivors teabagged you in the gates or after they looped and stunned you. 
---
I also want Leatherhead, The Ninja Turtles, Rat King, Shredder and Krang, April and Casey, etc. etc. etc., pleeeeeeease!
---
DBD confirmed for Kingdom Hearts? ü§î
---
Oh my god, I am totally a horrible person /s
---
You aren't going to change anything, as nobody is going to listen to someone on the internet bitching about how something looks bad. It doesn't change anything if you have no proof that there was wrongdoing involved. Also, I am not playing Devil's Advocate for a pedo, I am playing Devil's Advocate for the argument. I don't give a flying fuck to anything like that, I am playing Devil's Advocate because some guy is trying to be a restrictive asshole. The content is legal, or else it would have been taken down by now by the many government agencies in multiple countries that monitor against things like Child Pornography. 
---
He takes 4 hits to down a survivor (2 more than average). He makes up for this with a high walk speed, high window vault speed, and plank jumping. He can essentially do what the survivors can do to survive, except faster.
---
Isn't that kinda what Skyrim does?
---
What if you work in a strip club?
---
Nah, I don't complain about that stuff because I think it's entertaining. If someone wants to be cheeky, that's fine. It doesn't affect the game in the slightest and it keeps the game fun. There's a difference between toxic behavior such as tunneling or face camping and teabagging or Jebaiting someone with a hatch. The former is shitty, the latter is simply just some banter.
---
Well, you keep saying that. We will enjoy actually having time on our hands, not trying to be an SJW and failing.
---
So what have you all tried against the legion? Because if you just DC and not try that won't ever help you play him. I mean 2 gens even with Ruin is still very manageable and you could always then look for the hatch? Tbh I would try to stay in every match to maybe see what a "bad" or what a "good" legion is etc-  and try to adapt a play style? I play swf mostly so its easier against any killer normally..  anyways my main point it just try! I'm sure the legion rework won't happen for awhile. They said that about Freddy and look where we are still sadly. 
---
Is that the huntress dad
---
Elaborate 
---
Yes, but David is enjoying it more, as he never fights someone who is better. But Ace on the other hand loses a lot, hence the debt
---
I'll be honest... fellas, it was sounding great. But... I could've used a little more Wailing Bell. So... let's take it again... and, OP?  Really explore the studio space this time.
---
Each box gives you a 50% chance of removal if done to completion, exception being the last box is guaranteed 100% removal, providing you hit the skill checks
---
S- Any time I‚Äôm a survivor
---
F- Any time I‚Äôm a killer
---
Great art, stories, characters, and horror. But it's fucked up anime and pushes some boundaries. I do enjoy it but in small amounts
---
You missed the joke 
---
Agree
---
If the majority of the community doesnt want these shitposts than it would be deomcratic to suspend them.
---
I know it‚Äôs unrealistic, but reading this makes me realize  how little map variety we have and makes me want a patch with a bunch of maps being added. Whether they‚Äôre completely new or good variations of previous maps i don‚Äôt care tbh. 
---
The main way I try to escape from Legion after 50+ games against him is to find the hatch after my team dies. 90% or more of the Legion players I run into use the generator hex; couple that with their fast movement and it makes tracking the skulls down far riskier than against some of other killers. You can obviously try and power generators, but with how much he bounces around the map (especially the small ones) it's extremely difficult (esp with above mentioned hex). My other strat is similar to my main. Go into games with a purple key, or use offerings to make chests to see if I can find a purple key to hit a black lock (essentially the same strat as above, just w/out having to wait for the team to die and 3 gens to power up).   
---
I've tried running, tried plank stunning; bottom line is if a decent Legion player sees you and wants you on a hook, you're going on a hook. Even worse when Legion juggles you if you decide to try Decisive against them.
---
You CAN go through the hatch with a trap on though! (Seriously)
---
Become Immortal, create sentient plants. Checkmate.
---
or 2nd more badass option
---
Become Immortal, turn the entire planet into a plant hive mind, fuse with it, create plants of massive size to manipulate the planet's movement, travel the stars to find other planets with civilization, Galactus the shit out of them, adding the entire planet's mass, resources and people to my massive flora infested planet hive mind, double Checkmate.
---
:smug:
---
I know 0 things about Kingdom Hearts, but I'm sure this is funny xD
---
Fair enough. Was just curious to see what you do!   
---
I usually the box skill checks because I‚Äôm nervous about messing up and I mess up more 
---
Kando memes on the rise? Invest now?
---
Probably not, people were just unhappy that we had 3 Licensed Chapters in a row so they decided to go for more Original Chapters. I'm fine with having Licensed Chapters as long as they space them out (which they didn't so we're going to have Original Chapters for a while to balance it out) and as long as the Ratio is around 2-3 Originals to 1 Licensed.
---
That's impressive 
---
ya got me
---
Makes sense, the entity did already spend a lot of time kidnapping and penetrating teens.
---
this isnt about the devs. that a whole other problem. what im arguing about is people saying that she looks young in op's art, but saying stuff like "she is probably 18 so that works out nicely". its people realizing she looks young in the art and not calling out op, or even getting off to a picture of rin who was purposefully made to look young. even if in the lore rin is older, or "just old enough" it just. isnt cool that people feel okay with this. especially when behavior like this is harmful to minors. im kinda sick of arguing with people who just dont care to see how shitty all of this is.
---
Chapter 10 was Darkness Among Us. 
---
The second one, almost certainly.
---
" sorry guys my internet is fucked up sometimes"
---
YEA SURE M8
---
and in any case there are 4 original killers, chapter 11 will be original, not licensed, the last licensed killer is more than a year ago, so not 2-3 original and 1 on license..
---
ill give you a custom 12'' frank, where do you want it.
---
Ah thanks, when they bought the game from sb they said they had over 70 people. Crazy to see the game grow.
---
It‚Äôs always the best revenge. ‚ÄúOh, you don‚Äôt care about my fun? Unlucky for you, neither of us will pip

Its alright friend, you'll get over whatever is troubling you soon enough
---
The fact he calls it ‚Äúthe generator hex‚Äù shows he doesn‚Äôt have enough game knowledge for us to take him seriously. He just ‚Äúruins‚Äù the game for the other 3 survivors by DCing when something doesn‚Äôt go his way. 
---
Ruin skill checks when the little meter thing starts RIGHT in front of the success zones so you don‚Äôt have time to get a great 
---
I'm pretty sure when a hatchet is thrown its hitbox is like a basketball. So if its close to you you will most likely get hit. Hitboxes are broken and its not latency. In my opinion dedicated servers will not help, but who knows. Hope this clears somethings 
---
Outstanding move
---
Jeff spray painted a mural at Ormond Resort for Frank for five bucks.

As if she didn't look great in-game
---
Jeff and Legion too

Is shrek now a survivor?

mmmmk. Just because I word something for people who might not play the game as much as me doesn't mean I don't play the game. 
---
oh yea, i dindt make this, i dont know who exacrly did it, since i stole it from a dbd discord, but credits to whoever did this funny meme 
---
Min should be up 1, her parents weren‚Äôt too fond of her prioritizing gaming rather than school, that seemed to have changed after she started getting good and recognized but she then went on a downward spiral of what sounded like alcoholism and casual drunk sex
---
no it's him in the Square Hammer theatre as a survivor
---
Or hear heavy breathing even though you didn‚Äôt run ... I‚Äôm always like shiiieettt RUUN 
---
I did not actually climb the rock, I used the killer lunge and after idk how many attempts I managed to down them. Then they fall off the cliff automatically 
---
I'm a P0 Claudette.  I bought the clothes I need to be hidden.  Countless times crouching in tall grass I have been blessed with killers missing me.  This should be its own perk, and take up a perk slot.
---
Wrong. They use the MAC address, which is hard-coded into your network card. That's why Dud had to jump to PS4.
---
If that's what you desire...
---
Sorry you had to deal with it. These idiots probably picked it up from such a streamer..they need to be banned just like Ochido this is basically his school of thought. The worst type of dbd players if you ask me
---
Fair enough, I didn't know that. In that case you can change, or spoof the MAC address directly in your operating system. Thx for the heads up tho O_o
---
starting from this point listening to Phoenix Wright's OST (specifically Cornered) is the greatest
---
Nah, console. But it would be nice to get everyone on board. 
---
You mean a few years ago
---
Survivors have the same number of tries to doge as Huntress has to throw. 
---
That would be Kate's. 
---
I‚Äôm right there with you! I usually wait to see if they run at me backwards and then I leave. 
---
No, but the in-game report system makes it clear you can be reported for "rage quitting" and "intentionally disconnecting to avoid defeat".
---
Lmao no, I don't know what it is, just drew something that would look like it was an organ xD
---
The memes have always been complained about. It just makes the good ones even more valuable.
---
It's hard to find inspiration to make more after awhile tho. üòû
---
I never understood why people feel like they need to have everything in games like this. If the grind was better than you'd have less incentive to spend money which they need.
---
My first thought was ‚Äúwow finally a really good unphotoshopped cosplay!‚Äù And then I realized IT WAS A DOLL. Great job!
---
Gotcha :&gt;
---
When I see your legion I will DC. 
---
When I see a Freddy I enjoy the gameplay. I think he‚Äôs a decent killer. 
---
Obviously!
---
If everyone did like you said then they would never get banned. They can just do whatever they want and bully people. I hate people like them and won't allow that, regardless of points or time wasted.

They didn't lie, performance for a lot of people went up from the new engine update. At worst they mislead, but so did the fanbase.
---
That's fair enough. Idk, maybe I should just sacrifice myself and die; I just don't like losing an item or rank over some killer who has a ridiculous kit. We'll see.
---
Most of the maps look pretty much the same which is really boring. They need more diverse maps. I‚Äôd love for a catacombs or cave map as those settings are super creepy to me 
---
Just make the skill check 1 pixel. 
---
Dun. 
---
I guess it solves one of the complaints about NOED, which is skilless killers using it to get wins. In this case, you have to have been a somewhat competent killer to get a lot of use out of it. Just like the DS change, this seems like more of a rework than a straight debuff. It‚Äôs better in some ways, worse than others.
---
whatever you say
---
I don't think I really do it consistently enough to get in much trouble. I never even quit a game until Legion came out.
---
In DBD?
---
Agreed! With comms survivors can tell each other to hurry up and DC! Onto the next game! 
---
Probably the best feeling in the world let's be honest 
---
4 P3 Claudettes joined my game with meme names. Ormond picture was perfect and hilarious.
---
As long as you're using the Tonic most of the game. Most of the Clowns I've gone against, granted it was at the 13-10 ranks, rarely use their Tonic. Which is why they don't do as well as they could be.
---
No, in Last Year: The Nightmare :) It's okay to misunderstand.
---
More.
---
as a Freddy expert I have another suggestion to go with yours. When Freddy completes his Mori Robert Englund says: "Welcome to Prime Time, Bitch! HAHAHAHAHA!"
---
You know, as odd as I think the upskirt as a choice was I must admit. OP did a pretty great jon on this picture! Fan's a Fan and clearly to put hours into a drawing for this game is pretty impressive!
---
1 or 2 games gives you a new level. Games last less than 10 minutes at worst. How is that a bad grind?
---
The arm. The fucking dangling arm. I am way too tired for this.
---
I never said anything like that? I said that the huntress can try as many times as she wants. If a survivor they only have one chance to fuck up and then they‚Äôll get downed. 
---
They can hit as many times as they want. 
---
Insults don‚Äôt make your arguments any better. I‚Äôm sorry if I offended you. 
---
Chomp Chomp, Thicc Evan Is Coming With His Clapping Cheeks
---
I think you've summed up my thoughts pretty accurately, on the one hand they *could* end up doing something neat, but honestly I'm expecting them to turn him into an uninspired chase killer.
---
I wouldn't mind some tweaks like Trapper and Hag got though.
---
I play way too much Nurse to know that a lot of SWF groups like that generally DC when they notice I'm not completely incompetent with her.
---

[Rank 1 Survivor.](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198091818465/screenshot/986756671406673187)
---
Guess what? Thoughts haven't changed one bit.
---
Survivors are stronger than every killer other than Nurse.
---
Didn't amanda save the police officers son in saw 2?
---
It's way too good 
---
AhahAHAhAHhaAHahAHAa Goteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeem
---
Are you ready to stand, right here right now, before the Devil?
---
No, that quote only reference him being "chosen" by the entity, he disappeared. No one in the real world knows anything about the entity realm so his friend thought he just went into the wrong fight.
---
Now he knows how we feel when the game doesn‚Äôt work right and you get robbed! 
---
Not to mention a smart killer will realize it for the world's most obvious bait and ignore it.
---
its gonna be so OP :)
---
Bubba should be a tier up, he is mentally a child and only kills out of fear for his family. Strangers scare him, and he‚Äôd die without his families instructions. 
---
Im pretty sure they changed the giant ass sphere that the hatchets are now into a rectangle and within a few days they reversed it.
---
Videos poped up almost instantly of hatchets passing through surviors so i think its safe to say hatchets aren't being touched again for a while
---
This has nothing to do with skill checks
---
&gt;I'm fine with having Licensed Chapters as long as they space them out (which they didn't so we're going to have Original Chapters for a while to balance it out) and as long as the Ratio is around 2-3 Originals to 1 Licensed.
---
It's an opinion, it's what I would like to see in the long run because Licensed Characters aren't unlockable for free nor will they probably ever get cosmetics, plus I don't want the game to become Dead By Licenselight.

If its the servers from deathgarden you're gonna have a bad time.

There are now 29 characters in the game. I used to play this game all day in summer. The amount I played (almost exclusively as survivor) lead me to get a character to Level 50 in about 2-3 days. 29x40 is 1,450 levels to get all the teachables. Think about if you wanted to prestige your favourite characters, and then think about trying to get all the survivor/killer perks on your favourite survivor and killers. It takes an extremely long time to get your save file to a state where you can have a survivor and a lot of killers with their good perks. That's the state in which you'll enjoy the game the most, because at that point you're starting to peak in the variety of things you can do. I'm not saying grinds are a bad thing, but for a game of this genre, I and a lot of people don't really think it fits. This is coming from someone with 1.5k hours who almost has all his killers and half of his survivors in a place where he wants them to be. 
---
I‚Äôve literally been face point blank to wall picking up a survivor before and still had someone manage to flashlight me, now that caused salt üòÇ
---
Nea is linked to the nurse in that she was dared to vandilise the area where the nurse worked. 
---
Jeff created the legion logo for the gang. It is also suggested that his dad was the janitor killed by the legion with his dads sudden death coinciding with the legions backstory of killing someone. He ends up arriving at the entitys place at the same time as the legion gang. Jeff ends up buying a case of beer and heads to Ormand lodge and in the end of the legion backstory, Frank notices a shadowy figure near the location they are burying the body, very likely suggesting that figure was Jeff.
---
Adam was in Japan and was learning its language until his train crashed. He blocked a door from hitting a girl in the train then suddenly he seemed to have been taken by the entity. Perhaps he experienced death similar to the spirit and maybe the train crashed near the Yamako residence. Other than that the trailer suggests he found the Yamako residency and was investigating it. 
---
I do know Feng Ming and doc was picked by chinese players because in China, there is a doctor there that uses electrotherapy to combat internet addiction, similar to Feng addiction to gaming in her story. No lore implications though.
---
Other than that I dont see much of a relation between any of the survivors and killers. Killers seemed to be picked if they have some form of revevenge or hatred when they die akin to hag, spirit or wraith or are just evil such as clown and doctor. 
---
Many of the licensed killers are related to the killer in the way there respective series demonstrate them to be with Michael hunting down Laurie, his sister and such

My girl Rin lookin good üòè
---
Agreed. It artificially lowers the skillcap for both Survivor and Killer.
---
Playing games like Overwatch and R6 with higher sensitivity and then coming back to DBD is terrible. It feels soooo sluggish.
---
Ps4 and umm my score towards the game started to bug out like negative twelve million and stuff. I didn‚Äôt loose anything though just a small glitch I presume
---
I always thought Bills was the saddest. Probably has PTSD and lived in a zombie apocalypse world with more than half of the world wiped out, sacrifices himself  in a noble way only to end up in the fog and lives in another nightmare. Dude is probably suicidal after all of it.
---
Glitches out and gave me 0 sadly
---
Well, I'd rather be a cunt than a fucking idiot, which you clearly are if you think that Killers don't routinely DC, dummy.
---
Trapper with Distressing, Third Seal, Sloppy, Butcher, Unnerving Presence.  
---
Keep'em moving, panicked, and blind all the time.
---
Simply a God among men.
---
Freddy, destined for the bottom of every tierlist
---
And P3 Claudettes against the brick walls in any of the blue maps
---
Having all the characters *is* the grind though, that's what I'm saying. I know all the survivors are the same, that's why I said "survivor" and not "survivors" when I said "killers". What if people want to play every killer? Why shouldn't they be able to if they pay for them? The grind is far too long. The grind in this game is like an MMO and it shouldn't be in the slightest.
---
I don't exactly need hard "proof" for something like this when almost all of the community agrees. 1,000 hours into a horror survival game like this, you should be able to have almost everything, if not everything, unlocked, not barely half. 
---
She'd have to have convenient amnesia so she keeps her powers.  
---
I love how they still give him respect 
---
I have no problem not getting a pip if you teabag me. I play to have fun first and foremost.
---
You know what's fun? Revenge.
---
How populated is your discord?
---
I often wonder how Legion made it past alpha stage. Who on the dev team thought they were a good idea? Same with deep wound in general. How was the consensus not "all of this is obnoxious"?
---
Sure, believe that, if it helps you sleep at night. Very good argument.
---
Repost my man
---
I'm not exactly sure why now all of a sudden people are complaining about the huntress hit box. it was like this ever since she was released as far as I'm concerned. I'm guessing it's probably because of the noob3 video. 
---
About the hit boxes however, they are bullshit on both sides. A lot of the times a hatchet hits a survivor that it should have not, but a lot of times it literally goes through the survivor and does not hit them. Not to mention the invisible walls around loops on maps like autohaven wreckers or the MacMillan estate. It's bullshit on both sides, so ironically it's fair for both sides;it just depends which side gets bullshitted
---
&gt;Bubba should be a tier up
---
That's exactly half of what Tyde says
---
Oh, you dirty bitch lmao.
---
So glad Tyde did a video on it and showed the community how deceptively good it is on Freddy.
---
Freddy's a diddler.  If he didn't spend all his money on Red Paint and Fedoras, he'd be passing out candy from his van.  Overcharge is exactly that.
---
Damn that blood warden was scary lol
---
But this is true of all killer hits, so why the fuck are you whining about hatchets that have to be refilled?
---
I don't see anything. Nice forest picture btw. 
---
This is an original killer, so it won't be X character, but, as every killer, it will have his inspirations.
---
Some may even claim they always thought freddy was strong.
---
Id say move the huntress down and the wraith up. Everything else is pretty spot on. 
---
**suprised pikachu**
---
Why is Freddy so low? Is it a crime to love the young people? /s
---
He has a slower move speed then other killers when hes not in his power, and has a long stun after hitting a survivor just twice. 
---
It's not "Face Camping" from the killers perspective it's Tactical Luring.
---
Hitting or catching a survivor, kicking a pallet or a gen and DC bonus. 
---
Is this one of those races the kids are talking about?
---
Wow its gonna take a long time to climb out of that debt
