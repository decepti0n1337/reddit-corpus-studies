The fact of the matter is, if you show your consumer you don’t care about making sure your product works, the consumer will take their business elsewhere. This is extremely true in video games.

While I understand that is their primary income source, it won’t matter if the game is bugged to all hell and unplayable. By the time they realize this the game will be dead already and everyone will have quit. I’ve seen it happen to so many games and developers because the fail to see the bigger picture. If they can’t handle keeping the lights on, stop taking on licensed dlc. The majority of the community is asking for original characters anyways and we would rather wait a little longer for dlc if it meant that game health was finally getting attention. They set unrealistic goals for dlc releases and now refuse to pull back on it to focus on the bigger picture. With their current logic and at this rate, the game won’t last another year.

Honestly, I used to spend soooo much time on these forums and clocked 1400 console hours. Now I’ve switched to PC and have around 300 hours on PC but I haven’t played in like a month. It just hasn’t grabbed my interest.
---
And with stuff like this, I’m wondering if I’m kinda “moving on”. I mean, shit, I used to make a DBD meme every couple days.
---
Damn, could've at least let them get one gen then slaughter them lmao

Yes, I never said she took much skill. I realize that there are some people that abuse Prayer Beads, Stridor, and Tinkerer and just gen snipe. My point is that she’s not over powered.

Wouldn’t it be better for them to keep the bugs in the PTB and they postpone it to work on them than them releasing a really buggy ass chapter?
---
Maybe it's because I'm super new to this game but I find stuff like this...fun? Like, isn't that the point of the game? The back and forth between the killer and survivors?

I hardly ever disconnect but I can understand why people do it, I'm what you call a casual player but I love the game so much.  Recently I got a couple of friends to buy the game on ps4. It takes you about 10 minutes to start a match as survivors, as soon as we start you can tell we are outmatched and we get killed immediately.  It's infuriating.  Then you wait another five 6 minutes for the second match and you think the killer is a nice killer play leading you to generators and what not, but honestly there just trying to stalk you for points.  Then in the third match you have a pretty new killer obviously that decides to hang one of the players and stand there so you cant pull them down.  All I know you waste about an hour and a half if not more and you're left irritated.
---
Me. Everytime I do a good job distracting the killer I have a pathetic team that maybe does half a gen.
---
No clue at all why the killer would stick to the downed person in those circumstances, but it's really their own fault if they didn't want to look for you. Heck, worst case, do wide sweeps, and when the downed survivor gets picked up, you know where both survivors are. It's not your fault that the killer played poorly.
---
im not too much on nerfing it. just changing it so that the conditons are acutally when your being tunneled
---
Honestly i catch myself doing this too often lol hence the meme.

Are you new? This is not toxic, people do this to give the killer extra points.
---
&gt;when disguised you lose your TR, walk up to someone on a gen, then undisguise and attack
---
if you replace disguise with cloak then you've described wraith
---
Mouse5 is a game changer, switched from console and it’s true evolution
---
Can I use this idea and flesh it out to be a bit more balanced? I want to use it in a concept document to send to the devs. You'll be given full credit for the while concept.
---
As a killer, I love when people dive the hook when I'm still near.
---
At that point, it's just a better dead hard. Like OP said, risk and reward
---
hi there. this was asked on the forums (link down below) and not queen responded. https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/97564/withering-blight-event-postponed

---

---
The rare voice of reason, bold enough to go against common consonance.
---
They haven’t figured out balancing if you ask me. Anyway, saying wraith is fun is entirely opinionated. For me he’s god awful and needs a buff. As he is now, he would be better than this concept for the Thing.
---
This was NOT the comment I was expecting for that photo
---
Sabo squads be gangster 'till the killer starts slugging... But for real though, I want to try this sometime lol
---
Definitely get a Killer
---
Survivors should NOT depip if all of the killers quit the match.
---
&gt; Seriously, if a killer decides to disconnect because they don't like how I'm playing, I shouldn't depip from it.
---
Survivors should not de pip for killers rage quitting after hex pops after the game starts
---
and you're frightening!
---
I might put him above Myers actually, at least with the build Tru3 usually uses where you use the cloaking to avoid heartbeats, letting you just hit survivors. You can also use it in chases to make the survivor make mistakes since they would look behind them to break you out or not be able to judge when you can lunge at them because of the lack of a red stain. Combine that with stuff like sloppy butcher to make them take longer healing and you have something close to Wraith without the need to uncloak.
---
A lot of survivors don’t like her because her mind games are much more advanced than other killers. It’s not just red glow mind games. Also, she’s harder to loop/get in long chases because of her phase walk. Factor in map pressure and clearly she has more going for her than most other killers. Surv mains say she isn’t “fun” to play against because it takes much more skill. (Not all survivors think this way obviously)
---
This happened to me before whilst playing trapper it was a fun match and still got a 4k
---
Platform?
---
This happened to me on PS4 I reset everything everything then it works
---
Swap streetwise for no mither maybe 🤔
---
&gt; The subreddit doesn't allow displaying player's names in posts showing disconnects.
---
Yep, you restarted your app?

You forgot the /s

Darn, I’ve been waiting for the event. So I could get 2 of those sets and then unlock the rest. I hope they solve it quickly.
---
ovo \*screm\*
---
I reset the app/ PS4/ router/modem works fine after
---
The rank system should handle disconnects better in general yeah. Like the commentors saying, survivors shouldn't depip from the killer DCing either. But also: If I'm solo queuing as a survivor I shouldn't suffer a depip after half my team disconnects completely out of my control.
---
If someone disconnects within X minutes of the match starting it should give everyone, Killer and survivors, a safety pip no matter what happens. The idea being that if a match does not have a complete set of players, than the match is not valid for judging someone's rank one way or the other.
---
They need to understand it's a game not an exam xD
---
Damn that sucks.  I was planning on grinding before MW came out.

---
Looks amazing. Hot af 😍
---
From a casual console players perspective, if I die I die

Only thing that gets me upset are when randoms DC or the killer camps everything else is free game 
---
Meh must be a PC thing hahahaah
---
BL &gt; SB any day
---
There was only one gen left and the killer came and chased the Feng so it was fine :/ plus I started it with the Claudette cause she was just crouching around not doing much
---
People will not be pursuing the same path at once nor progress at the same pace. We live in an era atm where BR reign and promote hyper competitiveness. With that said, DbD doesn't meet enough of the qualifications to actually be a competitive game. While we might get salty over the competition in DbD, at the end of the day it should be regarded as a casual game with systematic variety which is what this new form of dailies provide.
---
Glad to help, see you in the fog
---
I bring bloodhound on spirit nowadays since everyone is bringing iron will.
---
If you use both, there is no winning if you're injured and you use them. Either you get hot and get endurance, or the killer waits and you heal a health state
---
I've literally had to swing at where I couldn't see anything to hit her before, especially on the Game map in the lower level. I literally saw a silhouette and swung. I wouldn't have even seen her crouching in a corner either if she hadn't started running.
---
I’m not saying sprint burst is necessary I’m saying exhaustion perks are necessary, Idk why I’m even saying this as it was a joke
---
Laurie an old wench
---
I can see some problems happening. Mainly all the messages at the end of each match.
---
“Why did you DC?” “I was supposed to search all chest during the match and you already opened one”
---
“Why didn’t you unhook me?” “I had to escape in the hatch”
---
“Why did you camp me” “I had to get 2 sacrifices during the match”
---
It’s definitely gonna be interesting lol.
---
Assuming she doesn’t have Stridor, run Iron Will.
---
Spine Chill, Premonition, or Object will give you a head ups so you have time to get away (Even if she uses Prayer beads).
---
Lithe, Quick and Quiet, and Dance With Me, and Fixated are the four horseman of the apocalypse when trying to end a chase with any killer, especially one that can only see footprints and relies on sound. 
---
And biggest of all, you can still pallet loop her. It’s definitely more difficult due to her built in mind games, but the option is still there.
---
Maybe some day? I hope.
---
&gt; Thankfully huntress was more altruistic and gave me a lift
---
a lift... to the hatch, I assume?... right?
---
True but. they weren't doing gens I went through the whole map and found one with only like 25% on it so idk
---
*silently stalks as the unsuspecting 3 work on the generator not noticing me*
---
Ace is a real G man, I personally play Nea cause she was the character I instantly picked up when I started the game after release, but man Ace and his silent footsteps too... Makes every killer shudder.
---
Also another thing: People who moan about needing to use a certain perk to counter a certain killer, why must you also run Dead Hard, Adrenaline and Decisive Strike? 
---
"Because they're good against all Killers."
---
"So is Iron Will."
---
*Nyehhh*
---
*Goodbye Scroll of Truth*
---
Bring you to the hatch and closes it a foot from you, then mori you.
---
If you can't see that not everybody thinks of and agrees with your line of thinking, I don't know how else to spell it out for you. Just because you say it is, doesn't mean it is that. Very basic line of logic to follow.
---
Just REVERT dedicated servers. Unless they actually think they can somehow make it better than p2p they should just stop with the live testing bs so i can play the game without getting against huntresses every match who hit me through walls
---
He heard someone fail a skill check in another game.
---
Are you saying theres some sort of skill factor in that game?
---
Of course lol
---
[deleted]
---
Hahah this is great
---
It looks like a parody lol
---
imo, its not really worth it until last 2 gens to work on gens with someone, especially if theres ruin or discordance. I dont trust everyone working on a gen with ruin to hit their skill checks and I'd much rather have multiple gens around the same level of progress that anyone can go and work on than one done quick and several untouched (also the killer is pressured to check gens around the whole map as opposed to the one or two that got started). 
---
Personal matter though
---
edit: Also I know where every gen spawn is for the most part and you can see where the gens are pretty easily from the environment so finding them isnt time consuming at all unless its like Hawkins Lab for me

---
Wtf. That would piss me off so much
---
Because your title implied it was only a killer issue.
---
"We should not Depip when the enemy DCs" would have been a less bias title.
---
Tap must really have a long arm
---
Yep. No respect. They need to do something to make up for this farce. Everytime they release a big update people are psyched about they fuck it
---
I would keep the perk icons centered and tint the black and white to match the rarity. Really nice otherwise! 👌
---
I literally had this twice in a row earlier. Never before today. I used a cake for both too. T_T
---
I thought it was funny. It started with me doing that to the Claudette. The only part that pissed me off was that we couldn't save the Dwight
---
Run stridor instead and that throws iron will to the trash.They're still quiet than normal if they have iron will but they make sound nonetheless,and people without iron will make even more sound than usual
---
Not to mention Freddy is already an m1 killer lmfao what are you even talking about??
---
Damn, I'm off work tomorrow and was hoping to get a head start.
---
No one said that...
---
Any killer can have a good game. What makes a killer good or bad is if they can consistently have good games

---

---
Thanks, I'll make some adjustments.
---

---

---

---
You can still download and play it, just cant get it from google play.
---
Its usually the Bills that are new to the game, why?
---
If the camping works, it’s not a bad strategy, now is it?
---
If you run into the bait and then bitch about how the bait works, people are gonna think you’re just a little slow in the head.
---
My personal build I use as someone thats decent at looping at red and purple ranks: 
---
Adrenaline: Overall meta perk, people dont typically heal at higher ranks and just do gens, so this gets you a heal for endgame and a speedboost. Can also save your life and extend a loop if youre injured/downed/ about to be picked up during or after a chase.
---
Spine Chill: Good for immersion and looping. I use it for looping mostly, it tells me if theyre still chasing me, what direction theyre likely coming from, lets me heal a downed person im looping around faster, and counters Spirit mindgames, Pig Crouch strike, and Freddy's radial invisibility. Otherwise it can let me clutch open gates when the killer is coming at me, know when ghostface/myers (t2) is stalking, or when wraith, pig, or ghostface are stealthed and headed towards me so I can get a head start on a loop or escape.
---
Decisive Strike/Borrowed Time: Decisive is good for when the killer decides to tunnel you for looping them or to make a distraction when the gate is open and you know they wont pick you up so you can crawl out. If im in a SWF Ill out on borrowed for the usual reason
---
Balanced Landing: imo best exhaustion perk in the game, arguable with Dead Hard. Only exhaustion with a (powerful) passive and it has the most controlled use besides Dead Hard. Can extend loops if youre exhausted due to the passive and end chases if youre using the speed boost.
---
Id consider this a pretty "meta" build where Balanced can be swapped for Dead Hard based on preference and Spine Chill can maybe be swapped for like Self Care or Iron Will or something if youre into that.

I saw in an old Tru3Ta1ent video a match with 2 killers. Tru3 was playing as Meyers, and when he was waiting in the lobby for survivors to join, a nurse was shown to have joined in place of a survivor. Was/is this a thing? When it’s difficult to find survivors to play against, does matchmaking occasionally throw in a second killer?
---
I know, and it's amazing. Being a group of dinguses is like the only way I play Surv honestly.
---

---
Which Thing are you guys talking about? The giant pink blob or some I don't know?
---
Haha funny cuz bad perk
---
I tried to run a bunch of underrated perks and got destroyed because the killer was using meta perks. 
---
Having stuff like that is required and if pisses me off. Literally if I don’t use a certain perk I’m destined to lose
---
The devs are saying they never gave a release for that so no it’s not coming tomorrow either
---
Now this is an old fucking meme, and I love it.
---
I feel as if you’re looking for reasons to complain
---
Well this aged poorly. At least the gun can be put to other use!
---
Its still a thing, its a glitch where you can get up to 4 killers with 1 survivor
---
U see old Freddy? He was by far the worst, bubba has some usage but old Freddy couldn’t even hit people until 7 seconds passed he was worse then bubba
---
Though she deals with looping better than any other killer (obviously besides nurse) due to how fast she’s moving but I see what you mean
---
Ooh, thank you!
---
i swear to go they said something or yet least discussed it
---
Your teammates must fucking hate you lol
---
I'm not trying to cast blame on the people in the trenches doing the real work for the devs but there is accountability that should be expected for the folks that are paid to lead these teams. Am I going to lose sleep cause the patch is delayed? No. Am I a sour old ass fool that likes to bitch? Yes.
---
The devs don't like it, though. CowsIAm got banned for using the glitch in public, IIRC. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeASjhRovF8
---
What do you mean valueless? I value my time and have an active social life, I still play a lot of DBD because I love the game and it makes me happy. Why are you on this subreddit if you think playing DBD is worthless?
---
Yeah, the wording probably could have been better. 
---
Also figured you didn’t see the rank /etc. Which is why I mentioned it.
---
Not trying to be a dick either.
---
But not all survivors can drop items, and if they are interacting with the fake survivor, by the time they want to sinalize they're not the thing he will already be attacking. Yes it would be very difficult to fool survivors once they know you're a shapeshifter, but it's very unlikely they'll know about it right off the bat.

To be honest, the flame or whatever..
---
I don’t know but when I read it, it just made me think of a victim of the Salem Witch trials, which would also be an awesome killer idea.
---
Not that another Doctor in the game would be terrible, but I feel like if you wanted to bring something more unique to the game, the Salem witch idea could be another avenue you looked at.
---
There's nothing wrong with a killer being nice, it's just the community is straight up brain dead sometimes tbh. I usually give hatch to the last person if I completely slaughter the rest of them or if they all put streamers on, if they start wiggling though? Oh naaaah
---
I chose Bill when I first started simply because I knew him from L4D so there was a sense of familiarity.

Sir! Here at the bottom! Why would you try something so bold? Yet so foolish?
---
Nah, always been there
---
I honestly think people just hate going against plague, I can’t play a single game with her without getting at least 2 disconnects
---
Exactly
---
1)  She sucks trying to rank up with because when played properly she loses generators and has very short chases due to only getting one hit.
---
2) She has only a few builds because she pretty much requires a lot of slowdown in order to stall the game. She does absolutely nothing to slow the game down by herself.
---
3) She can be screwed depending on which vomit she has and how the game is progressing.
---
What are you trying to prove, exactly?
---
LOL, just like last year when they launch this same event broken as fuck and you couldnt fill the viles, classic BHVR

People are dicks and won't understand your intentions regardless, sometimes they see what you did as farming because there wasn't really an effort on your part.
---
For me as a killer, if there was a group that played well or a player annoyed the ever living feck out of me and I get them down at last I'll throw them by the open hatch or gate and retreat and immediately let them know in chat they annoyed me so much they deserved the escape
---
Thanks for the advice, back to work we go! :)

No mither, resilience, deliverance and urban evasion is something ive wanted to try for fun
---
OP definitely watched noob's old videos. Like real old. He has been consistently rank 1 when he's streaming. Both survivor &amp; killer
---
Banned. BP caps lowering to 20k a game now.
---
Are the killer offerings only on pc?
---
Sounds like you are your friends just enjoyed making Jason miserable.
---
Until the next mid chapter patch. I’d guess some time later this month
---
Yea! Duck Season!!
---
:D
---
What about the archives? Sorry to be a bother
---
Exposed Status Effect: Survivors suffering from the exposed status effect will be downed in 2 hits.
---
ez
---
Old Freddy is not in the game anymore 
---
And I know what old freddy was
---
I hate you...
---
I can understand that, thank you!
---
Makeapp FTW
---
Nice!
---
Yeah, I remember survivors used to say the game was perfectly balanced. This is back when there were double pallets and WAY more infinites. 
---
The only way killers have an equal chance of winning at the red ranks is if they play the top 4 strongest killers in the game, which is why you only see Spirit, Nurse, Billy, and Freddy at the red ranks

Ah we cant really guess the date either. Since its a push back should be able to come any day right?
---
I like the rework ideas you have. But I'm still gonna go ahead and come up with an idea that combines both your concept and what I am thinking together and try to make it as much your concept as possible. I want to keep the originality of it from you while making it something people want to use. And I intend to keep it trapper styled as well. He is my main and I enjoy other killers that cut off survivor escape routes and loops.
---
I mean, if you’re going based on that.
---
This backstory is already fairly similar to that of The Plague. Not to mention that you even added fountains, just like the Plague.
---
Also the Hag was kidnapped and cannibalized by a cult basically. That is incredibly different from being burnt at the stake. There’s lots of different ways you could do it.
---
I just think there’s a lot of similar aspects in your backstory and theme with killers that we already have. There’s no problem with it, I’m just offering up ideas. I’d probably take the Black Plague out of it at least, since we did have a killer already inflicted by one.
---
Gg ez
---
Epic.
---
As far as solutions to make low ranks more evenly distributed, I do think there are some creative solutions one could implement to not change the game much at all.  I'm by no means the best person to talk about this but I can think of a couple things that could be done to offset this a bit.  Without spending more than  a few minutes considering it:
---
\- The first (and maybe second) time you ever face a killer on an account - while playing solo to prevent abuse - the game could advise the survivor what killer they will be facing with a quick overview on the killer's skill and tips/tricks on things to look out for.  It would simply be an overlay on the loading screen.  You could put lots of limits in place on the back end to ensure no one is abusing this system.
---
\-  Add skill checks to killer play. This is not as simple but could actually be really cool if it was done properly.  Instead of just survivor-style skill checks, you could add a sort of 'sweet spot' system which could be tied to letting go of a charged attack at a specific time, or timing or placing an attack based on position. It could still work in high level play because you could play with the function of it to ensure it has minimal impact on high level play, but serve as an effective valve at "penalizing" newer killers, to bring them more into line with newer survivors.
---
\- Create a handicap system for survivors that you "graduate" out of.  Perhaps for the first X games, you get some small advantages such as hex:ruin outcomes for missed skill checks, spawn further from killers and closer to gens, changes that would not alter the fundamental experience of the game but give small advantages to new survivors.   Easiest to implement but probably the worst, though I'm sure it would help players develop basic skills.
---
\- And of course bots - bots would solve lots of problems.  But I already mentioned that.  There are  less popular games out there that have added bots to their games later on in development that shouldn't be much more complex than DBD bots.  The advantage to bots is they could be useful for lots of things outside of just teaching new players the game.
---
It's clear now that they didn't share a date to the update so they could postpone "only" the event because they were already facing difficulties. This is unbelievable! It's ridiculously unrespectful to their fans! Disgusting!
---
I love them, and not just because I typically play survivor. I've tried to play nice as killer as well, but sometimes it's taken as me just being a 'bad killer', haha.
---
Just today I was playing on the switch after not having played (on xbox) for almost a year, so I was more or less pretty new again. Met a very friendly wraith who, after a DC and the other two survivors being killed very quickly (I don't even remember if a gen was done but if so, only one) and I figured 'eh, whatever.' Saw the Wraith coming and just stood there. He showed up, watched me a bit. I started walking and then he eventually ran ahead, led me to some totems and then the hatch. It honestly made my night. It's not often it happens but friendly killers (or even enemies in other games) makes me smile quite a bit.

K so ur fucking stupid I’m making a point/example that old Freddy was nerfed to be even worse then he was because survivors review bombed the game I don’t care he got fixed I’m just making an example of what happened in the past ok?
---
Can you copy and paste this post into a PM to me?
---
well sometimes the totems just spawn out in the open on rotten fields, but yeah thats really unlucky.
---
Thank you, I actually had a game last night where I killed everyone and wanted to give the last person the hatch, they were super nice about it, even if it took me forever carrying them on my shoulder, to find the hatch.
---
Its on console too
---
Why should I watch this? Am I missing something?
---
That was exactly my thinking, I'm glad not every player has a problem with a nice killer on a DC.
---
I WILL F*UCKING SACRIFICE YOU!
---
'kay, sounds good
---
Yeah, maybe next time that happens, I'll go after them but hold back a little, just in case. Thanks!
---
Are bloodpoints tasty

Just the way you flaunt yourself. It's like a mantra you keep reciting in your mind to boost your self confidence. It's not subtle and you had no reason to share it with us except wanting us to know what a badass you are for rekting noobs and streamers exclusively.
---
And all the downvotes and criticism in a thread that values at least a semblance of civility is just haters gonna hate.
---
Such an alpha.
---
Each characer sits in their own way. Some more unique than others. Steves doesnt sit and quentin falls asleep
---
Teammates hate him. 😡
---
Killers love him. 😎
---
I feel like this is a blursed image
---
All dbd players, from 10 k hours to 45 mins in game, we all know deep down ace always carries his team to victory no matter which rank he is.
---
I love the power idea! Maybe make it so he loses 15 percent of his stalk on a particular person when he downs them, then I would add a secondary ability to sabotage or “trap” gens and block them for a short period. Just to slow down the game.
---
Can’t blame you at this point, 1300 console hours and ~300 PC and kinda feeling meh about the game. They continually disappoint me, and as a Cowboys fan, I know what constant hope followed by disappointment is like lol
---
Is it toxic?
---
I think she's fun
---
Pretty sure you are talking about the warehouse bug. The killer was able to hit them eventually, since noob, monto, &amp; co were meme-ing and the killer caught on how to do it too. I think one of them got stuck in that bug where they can't move or get hit. Noob3's videos are filled with memes, you just gotta take it down a notch and watch it for the lols.
---
happy cake day ☺️
---
The difference between downing someone in 10 seconds because you know you can, and milking it for simply another 5 seconds to get yourself more points can make a huge difference. My point also was if they get gens done fast or at all.. and they just slug to get 4 kills.. that in no way means they did good. It would be the same if the whole team quit to be expecting to get a pip for that. Assuming I'm even remotely suggesting he lets the survivors farm or can stop them from killing themselves is infantile and ignores my point completely. If 2 kill themselves fast.. and they proceed to slug and kill the other 2 immediately because "why not fuck it its a 4k", they obviously don't care about the pip and only care about getting what would already be an easy 4k.. just slightly faster. Expecting to be rewarded for less work is some of the most juvenile bs anyone in this sub could be asking for.
---
I'm glad that there are killers who will be nice to survivors and I appreciate when the survivors are nice about it too, so, that makes me feel better. Thank you.
---
Some say that Nancy has been stuck to the Trapper to this very day.
---
Yeah. It even has a visual to show you what direction its in if your close enough, but it doesn't do to much cause if your close enough to here it you don't really need the visual
---
r/ShapePalletStun
---
Oh don't worry, I'm working on his add-ons.
---
And people who love the idea of killer's add-ons changing the playstyle (Like Freddy with bloodpools and fake pallets or Michael with his scratch Mirror, Infinite Tier 3, Mori Michael, etc.) won't be disappointed!
---
You fucks are impossible to please. If there are issues and a game company pushes their employees to the edge to make deadlines, people bitch. If a company is transparent and pushes back a deadline in order to not work their team to death, you people still bitch. Good God this community.
---
Trapper is the worst on that point. I get 4k 7/8 of my games with trapper, and the 1 remaining are hatch escapes. However, my bps vary from 15k to 20k, and sometimes I even de-pipped for winning. I didn’t camp, nor tunnel, or any other underhanded methods, however, the game just hates him.
---
Blimy mobile op pls nrf
---
God cornfield totems are the worst
---
Must not play enough killer thx
---
Bruh this...........IS AMAZING I love the fact that u put in hard work
---
It only shows those lines when your in a chase. Oh but I gets worse when you play as killer and the hatch spawns, it tells you in bold text at the top of the screen and it doesn't go away, I'm pretty sure that's a bug though.
---
Why does anyone run noed? It’s dumb af. As a killer main it’s 100% useless to me and I sometimes get toxic survivors coming back from a noed main retrad who camped and tunneled. Why did the devs think it would be okay for the game?
---
And here I am on reddit instead of studying for my midterm.. 😬 Good luck!
---
Well, I'm glad to know those people are deranking to bully and then whining. That inspires confidence.
---
It's funny when people mention counterplay to builds that you can't know in advance you're facing.
---
I can't stand this guy whenever I play(ed) with him. Always plays bad as survivors and is pretty campy as killer. Haven't played against or with him in months though so maybe he got better.
---
I mean tunneling in the sense that if there is an opportunity to down a person who just got unhooked then go for it, not as in chase 1 guy the entire game until hes dead or tunnel the guy that just got of the hook every time
---
Its aggressive because survivors dont expect for you to tunnel in that way, meaning they'll take a life for a life, rather aggressively take both lives
---
I personally let the guy that got unhooked live but a more aggressive playstyle is if there's an opening and the survivors are cunts, then take that opening instead of usually letting him go, and I'm not say do this to every hook, just on certain openings
---
In return that's a 2 free downs you got meaning lots of pressure
---
That's really sad. "Keep playing for this insignificant position that you're going to lose next month, instead of because you enjoy the game."
---
They could at least just make your rank creep down gradually so you don't get these trainwrecks in matchmaking.
---

---
Guys I don't think I quite understand, what does franklin's demise do?
---
Whenever I get epic chases or saves, I only get recognized 1/10 times, but at least I know I can do it :)
---
Nah, it is edible not noed-ible
---
It looks sick man!!
---
 I don't get why people like to belittle the skill, coordination, and practice it takes to play survivor well.  Survivors literally only have distraction and coordination as their weapons, and they're often criticized for using them and getting 1-3 of their people out.  Killers only like 4ks and complain that the game isn't balanced to where 80% of people are immobilized or removed from the game in advance, while the killer can never be removed from the game.  Killers complaining in this game honestly remind me of rich people crying over taxes or something.
---
Oh sweet, I didn't know that, thank you
---
Thanks!
---
Only noob killers camp. Any killer who knows how the game works knows that camping is basically throwing the game against any survivors that actually do the objectives. Most of the time, if you get camped and the killer is above rank 16, you probably did something to piss them off.
---
Is the update tomorrow just for PC or will Xbox be on there as well?
---
I would like more please
---
Tastes like iron
---
So does that mean if a survivor escapes, whether it’s through the hatch or gate, they should double pip?
---
Because that’s not how it works either. Lol.
---
It's mainly down to some influential streamers who push the killers = somehow victimized by game balance and survivor teams narrative.  Overall the game is well-balanced and fun.
---
There are two kinds of games: Sweaty and Not Sweaty.
---
Sweaty as Killer gets capped with a nice torrent of insults and "kys" regardless of anything.
---
Sweaty as Survivor means you're also wrong for not playing like the pubs you got wanted. If you're in a premade high-rank SWF doing the harassing, check yourself for sweat.
---
Not Sweaty as Killer means the game is actually playable, but you're probably using Beads Spirit with Ebony Mori as a sweat counter, so congratulations, you're a bully now.
---
Not Sweaty as Survivor means your team is going to drown you in the ocean of their incompetence.
---
Because it’s extremely good, once endgame begins the killer doesn’t have time to spare in chases, they need that extra help to stop them getting overwhelmed. I’m actually surprised, being fairly new to the game, to see how much it’s hated. It’s meta, I’m never mad at a killer for having it, and it’s counter-able by totem hunting. I can think of several survivor perks like DS and Adrenaline that are easily on the same power level but people always hate on killer perks more
---
Delayed, sadly. No definite date, just "midseason" now.
---
You're reply amounts to "He should've farmed." But why? Why should a killer have to stop doing their job just to pip? Do you not see the lunacy in this?
---
Its becoming another broken the 13th .-.
---
Yeah, it's anybody's guess at this point. Could be a couple of days from now, could be a couple of weeks. It's scheduled and an event so they are on even more of a crunch than they usually are now that it's been delayed.
---
Well, the sweatlords who have claimed the general title of "Survivor Mains" want to win. Every game. With room to BM. And Spirit stops that from happening. So she's gotta go.
---
No Killer should be stronger than Clown, and also give Survivors 3 hits of health. That's what the people want!
---
All they have in common are post-5 gens phase and that's it. I don't even get the hate either, as many of my games as of late always result in a hatch escape and not by finishing all 5 gens. In some cases it is patently useless or its effects are negligible, such as (1) even if you use it and it activates chances are you are not the one being chased or the killer switches to you and (2) fucks up your other exhaustion perk such as DH or BL wherein NOED is always beneficial to the killer. You can't even counter NOED by using Adrenaline but the same is not true for the other side: you might intend to cleanse every totem but the killer is always hot on your heels. Adrenaline also almost always give some indication of being "activated" either by healing one health state or having a noticeable bump in speed boost, NOED does not have this indication as one must be hit by it, and its speed boost post nerf is not that apparent as those of Adrenaline. The only thing that I can think of why NOED is allowed its continued existence is that it is a hex perk counterable by cleansing every remaining totem on the map and that it pseudo-slows down the game, countering most gen-rush attempts.
---
We'll get it next halloween lmao
---
Well here’s a [hag](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/old-woman-pistol-on-white-260nw-182174168.jpg)
---
It is one r/okbuddydaylight
---
There's no way to logically talk to you about this, your mind is set on 'i hate this game, but i'm going to continue playing it anyways'.
---
to anyone willing to save 13 minutes of their time, do not watch this video. it's not funny, not entertaining. just mediocre killer gameplay. thank me later.
---
The chrismast update in july
---
now i feel dumb, but thank
---
Everyone's lunge is identical, isn't Prayer Beads a Super Rare, and doesn't Spirit make a noise when she uses her power without the beads?
---
Gamers, especially ones that play this game,  are the most entitled of bitches.
---
If it means we get a non-busted version of the game to play and (potentially) longer periods of time to achieve the Halloween event items, then I'm fine with that.  It sucks to have to wait and I'm still disappointed, but if they need to iron some stuff down so they can keep cash flow coming, then so be it.
---
Yeah in that scenario I focus unhooker down but am not opposed to downing the unhooked guy for slug pressure to pull teamates off gens to pick up.
---
Someone has an opinion that doesn't mesh with mine! It must be based in personal benefit!
---
Yes please.
---
Getting a 4K doesn’t necessarily mean you stomped the survivors either. That’s my point.
---
If you get in a decent SWF group, and have a face camping Bubba and a group that will gen rush and have 3/4 survivors escape, with the killer only getting like 5k bps, does that instantly mean the survivors should double pip?
---
See, it doesn’t really make sense. It’s a double standard. You’re doing the bare minimum for the maximum reward. 
---
Also, why should it be harder for a survivor to pip than a killer? I understand some form of difference since there’s four survivors vs. one killer, but your logic is flawed.
---
A survivors objective is to escape, a killers objective is to kill. So why would killers double pip for killing if a survivor can’t double pip for surviving?
---
To be honest, I’m not sure why people are complaining about the ranking system anyways. Prolonging the game doesn’t mean you suck, in most cases, to be honest, it means more bloodpoints. Not that you need to hold the survivors hand, but prolonging a chase, taking a second to break a pallet, taking a second to kick a gen, all these things are fairly simple to do, will issue you extra bloodpoints, and you still have time to catch up with your chased survivor.
---
Also that is a ridiculous amount of shit for a survivor to do to double pip. Lmao. In comparison to “get a 4K”.
---
This is the definition of evil
---
Actually no.
---
This sub is filled to the brim with people, both Survivors and Killers, who make it their job to annoy/piss off as many people as they can. Killers like to use Ebony Moris just to prevent people from getting bp, Survivors start playing super toxic, and so on. Add to this that people are under pressure to make the most of the event that a couple of bad games is all it takes to make them rage, and you've got a recipe for toxicity.
---
Hell, I was playing for an entire day during the last bloodhunt and I think I had one game where I got more than 12,000 bp from the actual match.
---
Can't wait for the Halloween event that lasts 3 days.
---
Literally her just standing still is a “mind game”. Also, when she phases it’s just a guessing game as to where she will go, which means a skilled survivor can still get fucked.
---
Lmfao report it as a bug, dingus
---
Bye bye Nancy!
---
Would you rather be immediately rehooked?
---
The event in halloween is going to have more time in november that in the month of halloween, that dont feel right
---
Well, I manage to bring my Trapper to red ranks every season… it’s not that hard.
---
Of course I don’t easily 4k every matches like a Nurse or Spirit but I do well enough to pip (I also try to play as fair as possible).
---
Just take the time to learn about your killer and you’ll most likely be able to bring it to red ranks. It’s not that hard for real.
---
Thanksgivingween
---
^^^^^^^^^
---
He's mostly just Michael with teabags.
---
Context?
---
Yes, getting slugged sucks, but Killer's have to keep pressure on Survivors or gens will start popping off to quickly. Hooks and slugging are Killer's main pressure source.
---
If he had Scoops on, she'd be putty in his hands
---
Artificial longevity and a crude effort to accomodate the bad matchmaking system, mostly.
---
Your putting in way more effort then I even thought about my initial dumb comment mate.   It's a public forum anything is allowed to be posted as long as it's not against tos, like how the hell am I gonna get paired up with noobs unless they're slapped onto the (10) range then your no longer really a noob at that point since there's only 3 different things to do in the game. Enjoy it for what it is I slap the nooby survivors and if they quit then you were saved from having rager teammates. Streamers is a different story
---
I’ve got 50 ebony moris at the ready on spirit
---
Hey I saw your comment on an earlier post neat
---
***Hey buddy.. put down the strawman and read my responses.***
---
Seeing as how getting a 4k is the most amount of kills you can get, you should automatically PIP. Never did I say you should automatically DOUBLE PIP. Survivors should also automatically PIP for surviving. 
---
I purposely set the bar high, because I'd rather it be too hard than too easy to double pip, and I wasn't going to take the time to think it out when I'm talking to a wall.
---
They’re starting to piss me off. Such bs.
---
In your opinion, is it more worth to use Spine Chill + Resilience for fast window vaults, or use Dead Hard + whatever just because it's dead hard? I've been meaning to try a no mither build.
---
Also, is This is Not Happening worth it for countering Ruin or nah? I could be gen jockey mither.
---
Also also, is iron will necessary because sounds are already muffled?
---
Upvoted for the funny
---
Dude do you know how to read? I'm literally not suggesting that. If you know you're going to win the match because they are THAT bad.. juggle the damn survivors for literally 30 seconds. You don't need to go that much out of your way to do anything. They don't need to stop playing. ALL they need to do is resist the urge to kill them as fast as possible which is the exact same thing that would be happening against capable survivors. They don't need to go sit in a corner, they don't need to do anything besides MORE. Hit more gens. Hit more pallets. Hit more survivors. In the case of Trapper.. get them to go in traps. Winning as fast as humanly possible would be no different than 1 hooking everyone and then mori'ing them... it WONT help you pip no matter how much you feel it should. You are doing the base objective which is not pip worthy. Pips are earned by exceptional play.. not the bare minimum. Its like telling me your girlfriend should be rewarding you for cumming as fast as possible.. shit doesn't work like that. Put some damn effort in ffs.
---
Gotcha. Gotta remember you are a troll and ignore every comment you're gonna make in the future
---
Thank you to let me know that kid
---
Keeping to your fucking roadmap maybe?
---
DbD players are RANDOMLY horrible people, but there are no other asyms out that are doing well. In terms of gameplay, you can watch someone (I recommend Otz) to see the best it can be (which is very hard to reach), and in terms of community, if it'll bother you being told to kill yourself on occasion, being cheesed, or being teabagged at, you might want to wait for Project Resistance, or see what the deal is with Soul at Stake.
---
Or try Deciet or The Hidden, I suppose.
---
Do you think it’s possible the archives will be out tomorrow still?
---
I really don't think they're the same. Killers like Freddy and Ghostface definitely feel like they have a longer lunge than Huntress or Pig
---
Not all of them do that, only a handful. And most of them do that to not rank up too fast after a reset. Because playing as much as they do, they rank up too fast and then there’s no one else up there to play with/against. 
---
Try being in red rank the day after the reset… the lobbies are inexistant up there.
---
So some of them derank to be able to play.
---
But yeah, there’s also the occasional ass every group as one.
---
I'm not working for/at BHVR, you know
---
Yeah, toxic assholes are the exception to that rule, I should have mentioned that
---
I hate it when shes just casually getting hatchets from the locker next to you but you think shes going for yours and you burst out and give yourself away xD
---
Lol im jk ♡
---
A ton of people will play toxic and still gg, though. Provided they win, of course.
---
Purposefully avoiding killing survivors (Which is what you are suggesting. The literal definition of farming for points) shouldn't ever be a requirement to pip on a 4k.
---
Been mistaken due to confusion between fall and winter. I sometimes do these mistakes since I speak 4 languages and just mess up
---
Not always
---
This would be cool on a key chain. I’d buy one!
---
that's not what this is about? did you read the title?
---
What about getting healed by cos?
---
It’s still probably going to be a buggy mess even if they postpone it
---
Ehhh r/Instagramnormies
---
I thought it was a bevhr sponsored tourney
---
My mistake
---
If it's your own tourney
---
Guessing it's gonna be on PC as codes for content are easier to give away than on console unless your gonna give away psn/live/Nintendo cards
---
I tried to give someone a smack for pallet flashing me and it bounced off of the hook today. But there hasn't been a patch that I've seen.
---
This is why I sometimes run No Mither. I'd much rather get hooked and eventually killed so I can move on (I don't suicide on hook) than slugged and do absolutely nothing but crawl for five minutes.
---
And to those who say use Unbreakable, that only helps getting slugged once. Most killers will slug you again. At least with No Mither, the killer will either go after someone else, or be pressured into hooking you.
---
It’ll come out on “Due to unforeseen circumstances, the Withering Blight event is postponed until the release of the mid-chapter 3.3.0. We're working on getting the update ready as soon as possible and will keep you posted.”
---
I don’t know about the skin but that chase animation at the bottom with Frisk is just perfect
---
No, but sometimes. Semi-often, even.
---
Make the event twice as long and give us some deep discounts and free stuff and we'll forgive you.
---
I mean.. true but I still don’t think the PTB is useless
---
You stated that stomping should be a double pip in an earlier comment.
---
So define to me what you consider “stomping” if not a 4K? 
---
You’re literally contradicting yourself here. “4K is the most amount of kills you can get.” “Stomping should double pip.”
---
I mean you’re “talking to a wall”, and yet not fully explaining yourself. Only so much someone can read between the lines over the internet. If you want people to have a clear and clever conversation with you, take the time out to explain yourself and not automatically go into berating someone because you can’t get the words out.
---
No, you just don't have anything to contribute. If you did it would've been in your first comment. But all you said was more people are playing now than ever so its doing something right, be glad its not dead, and if I don't like it don't play it. You never actually addressed anything in the post. You should've just downvoted and moved on.
---
Yes and if it makes me happy to play Dead By Daylight I fail to see where is the issue? I play a lot of killers game and survivor with friends and my girlfriend, we all have fun it brings happiness into my life why on earth would you say it's worth nothing ?
---
I played the PTB I know how long it takes and I can tell you I would invest way more hours than needed anyway because I absolutly love this game.
---
Lmao
---
It got postponed.
---
So is there any system that can have their privileged status revoked, or can the most toxic people playing affect the game's core design if they become Fog Whisperers?
---
Nice use of Donald pleasence! Compliments the fact it’s a Myers Clip awesomely lol
---
No problem, that's actually hilarious 😅
---
If you wanna find out keep an eye on our profile, I'd say
---
Yeah, do this so survivors can never outrun or loop a wraith with uncommon addons. Totes.
---
Short characters with high speed have the longest-FEELING lunges, but everything I've seen says that it's the same lunge.
---
I'm not really excusing it.  I'm just not letting it bother me.  Instead of playing the game I can clean my house or do something productive instead.  I mean, I'm not going to, but I have the option to.
---
Idk I feel like they should be closer to gens, look, you have to actually take two steps away from the gen in order to break that totem and that's just absurd.
---
Coincidentally I'm surprised you're that much of a dipshit that you couldn't tell when I posted "coward".
---
You on the other hand are much to interesting  to ignore. I love having a menagerie of easily triggered people I can view for entertainment
---
Yeah but if you hear the music while on a gen you can hide in a locker to avoid the treatment mode.
---
I don't think that's a good change, but Freddy does need a change. He's currently the only killer whose main power is useless both at the beginning and end of the match. That needs changing.
---
Trapper still has a lot going on, though, since traps can act like instant downs. Someone like Doctor or Clown isn't making red at all.
---
Getting a 4k with 4-5 gens left. That's stomping.
---
Getting a 4k should, bare minimum, be a pip.
---
Escaping should, bare minimum, be a pip.
---
&gt; You should've just downvoted and moved on.
---
I'm not like you, I don't let my anger take control. I sit down and try to have a reasonable conversation, rather than let anger dictate what I say and do. I tried to tell you that there's nothing wrong with meta's, that the game is more popular than ever, and that if you don't like the game then why torture yourself further by playing it? 
---
Either way, I'm not going to downvote you for having your opinion on this. You're entitled to one, and I'm 100% for free speech.
---
Watch these fuckers just remove the archives and forget about it forever like they did dedicated servers. Each time I tell myself I'm going to buy something this next update a new skin, ect. almost every time they pull some shit like this
---
Yes. But if you are having games where you can’t even make it to the exit gate about more home half then yeah I’d probably take it off since it’s not helping you.
---
This is perfection
---
But you just complained about it...?
---
Yeah... I think so too, but now(sadly) the mouth where the cut is  drooping inward. At least I got this video before when I just made it.
---
I think the devs said they tried that or thought about it in a stream. IIRC they said something like he's fine where he is but they'd look into it if it's a huge problem.
---
Billy had to go.
---
His people need him.
---
Ping / Latency.
---
The game is totally unplayable until I can interact with both at once.
---
Yeah, I was initially pro Dedicated, but at this point, they’re just a mistake.
---
I think the mask had an issue in the last patch so they removed it for now,  not sure what the issue was.
---
And no that voiceline has always been in, I remember going through them all when he came out
---
Love it
---
cool, thanks!
---
Like the idea, what would the non teachables look like though?
---
I put This is Not Happening because you don't have to waste time searching or the totem (even if you have small game you have to search for it, it just decreases the chances that you miss it). With TINH, you don't need to waste that time, and it helps with other skillful actions like healing.
---
Ty btw.
---
Steve: "Yeah I played ball in school."
---
Internal Feng Thoughts: "Im totally leaving you on the hook next trial asshole"
---
They delayed everything
---
Easy solution: Cut your balls off.
---
&gt; That’ll alleviate all the disappointment from delaying their entire trashy Halloween event. 
---
&gt; I also wish people would stop fucking complaining the events are trash
---
Am I not getting something lol
---
Time for me to start looking for a Sherpa group for Destiny 2. I’ve got like 16 quests that need me to complete Leviathan.
---
And here I am putting a BPS on to get 2 dcs... Loving it
---
Bu- but where's my spoopy event? ☹️
---
Survivors review bombed the game until he was nerfed, so ya no they were pretty much forced to nerf him
---
Not a good idea considering that the event is never coming out
---
OMG EXACTLY. Why didn't I think of that. Tired of having to use more than one hand to play this game.
---
No, insta-heals are getting removed.
---
Let me translate this from devspeak- “Everything’s on fucking fire, so American Thanksgiving at the EARLIEST”
---
Why not just the logo? Y'know, the tallies?
---
We shouldnt need Ruin either but here we are...
---
Your implying that because you can’t mind game with Freddy it makes him just like any other killer. The fact that you can see each other through walls in no way makes him a basic killer. He will still enter the dream state and have to deal with pallets/snares. In no way shape or form does seeing each other through walls change freddys kit whatsoever. With your logic just because of the fact that you can’t mind game it makes every killer “a basic m1 killer”. What point are YOU trying to make? Because you’re not making any sense lol
---
People are just mad because they keep getting killed by it, myself included (not the mad part, the getting killed part). It’s strong, for sure, but what else are killers supposed to run? Monstrous shrine? I don’t personally use it, but I understand why people use it. Just run whatever perk you want.
---
No, he's just that big.
---
But allowing him to teleport to each door is a buff in and of itself. I think Freddy should be able to teleport to completed gens only when all gens are done.
---
Stalling the game to *get more points* to pip with, or in other words ***farming for pips***, shouldn't be a thing you have to do because you "did your job too fast."
---
 &gt; Just as getting a 4k is not exceptional by any measure as confirmed by the numerous amounts of posts of brown rank killers getting 4ks constantly in this sub. Almost nobody who has significant hours in the game or reds in general call that an accomplishment. It is literally what is EXPECTED you to be able to do.
---
"4ks are the base expectation for killers." 
---
Opinion discarded. Have a nice day.
---
It was a claudette, man
---
They are threatening to have a bunch of people report OPs gamettag. Because with Xbox reports don't do to much unless it's serious with messages and they can just check what was said (eg lots of cursing, threats, or other things of the sort) or, if enough people report someone they can get a SoftBank until Microsoft takes a look into the matter. But OP, if you read this you can report that message because it goes against the Xbox community guidelines in quite a few different ways. Block him, and then just move on you should be fine.
---
How detailed do these get when they're scaled down to the game? What about non-survivor perks? Any ideas?
---
This explains a lot
---
Ye but don’t see a point for doing it so I’m not gonna do it
---
The sewn on mask is an amazing idea
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! -Darth Vader episode 3 revenge of the sith.
---
I know lol but I'm not stressing over it
---
I’ve noticed that they’re usually de-pipping and learning to be more bold in the process. The d/c cause de-pip and the looping attempts to learn the loops better. Best way to learn to loop is to get killer to chase you and bring a flashlight to help you get just a few more meters of an advantage each pallet.
---
From what I understand, if you have purchased just the Killers and not their associated DLC pack then you will still get splinters.
---
Would have to run it like a super escape room. Cams in each room, and body cams on the participants. Multiple game masters watching over it. It would take some major effort to do it right.
---
Perhaps the Thing?
---
When you get tired of survivors so you smack a survivor with a survivor
---
I had 3 huntress's on haddonfield today, you should see how they felt.
---
I completely agree except for the top 4 thing. Id say there are 6 viable killers right now, because you're forgetting about Huntress and Hag
---
I am in the same boat. There are a ton of variables and ideas out there. Looking for the best ones to implement. Since the haunt season is almost over here, it's already time to start working on next year and this is one of the things I would like to bring to the table and fine tune over the next few months.
---
Thinking of checking out some "escape room" puzzles at Transworld this year that may work good in this game idea.
---
So if i’m understanding correctly... they were planning to release the only method to *earn* the Withering Blight cosmetics, as well as the only way to unlock the lore pertaining to the Withering Blight, and lest we forget to mention the Withering Blight Nurse and themed charm possibly well after the actual Withering Blight event starts or even ends (which is just a few extra bloodpoints on gens and hooks)... yea i’m not buying it. The mid chapter patch and event were always supposed to be linked. Either they’re just covering their asses with this “we never announced a date for the patch” loophole or they honestly have *the single* lamest idea for their biggest event of the year.
---
Survivors already get shit for points why would the last one even be a thing
---
Ah yes the next chapter, crying manbaby
---
Where do you aim with a flashlight? I keep using it and think I hit the face but he keeps coming and not being blind.
---
What's MM?
---
Anyways they said the serums will be in the free rift, which means when it comes out you get an entire 70 days to get the serums. 
---
Event is literally special hooks and generators for BP and nothing else.
---
*facepalm* I'm talking about how OoO doesn't work against Freddy like it does against every other killer, i.e. how its supposed to work. That's my issue and that's what needs fixing. None of that other crap.
---
That was awesome 👏🏽😎
---
That’s like the bare minimum standard that they owe, they’re not doing any grand favors lol. Can you imagine if they said “it’s our fault that the event has been pushed back to October 30 but you still only get until Midnight October 31 to experience it sorry those are the Halloween rules”.
---
is this your first time on a social media platform or are you just looking into a mirror while typing?
---
i think the DBD site confirms that it's the flowers, not the gens. i like the flowers better myself, no skill checks, easier, more user friendly. and of course for costumes, not points. it definitely said that: that you can "get up to 2 blight outfits". google it
---
Their are stranger things novels? Damn that’s cool. I never read but I read all the Gears and Assasins creed books and I love stranger things so 🤔
---
I love these a lot, if you did them for all survivors i would definitley use them
---
MYERS IS SUCH A DADDY
---
You don’t, you really don’t. It just fucks it up so much worse. Ask switch users
---
Is this your first time making joke or are you just winging it and hoping it will land?
---
Can't tell if this is originally a dude or a chick, but I'd hit it nonetheless.
---
Fair enough, I mean survivor because I find the queue times better mostly, and also I do SWFs daily.  I’m a rank 20 killer and frankly suck at it
---
ya just play with friends 4Head
---
It's Dead by Daylight, there's never too much salt. /s/
---
Everyone has been accurate thus far so I'll break it down with some very rough statistics
---
Base self-unhook chance is 4%. You have 3 attempts at escape. 
---
Deliverance is 100% guaranteed self unhook if you've safely unhooked someone else
---
Up the ante gives you 3% more luck for every living survivor, giving you a base 16% chance if everyone is alive
---
Slippery meat doubles your self unhook chances. 
---
4% / 3 chanses= 1.2% of the time, you will escape with no perks or offerings
---
12% / 3 chances= 4% of the time you will escape with max up the ante
---
12% / 6 chances= 9% of the time you will escape with max up the ante and Slippery Meat
---
Kinda like how your father had a son.
---
i'm a wraith main and i have no mercy what so ever. i ,recently did give mercy, i gave a dwight hatch after the others dced but usually i will never do so
---
Please post a picture of two of them and the BBQ icon with 4 stacks
---
Like how a pancake is a breakfast
---
He's mine you bitch
---
You basically set up a “fake match”, the killer will only hook everyone twice, get max chase and destruction points. 
---
Meanwhile, survivors will get max generators points, destroy totems, heal other survivors, unhooks and chase points. Finally they will escape while being slugged by the killer.
---
To do this you should communicate via chat/steam/psn whatever. If not possible, the killer may hit gens without chasing as a sort of “I want to farm” message. Burning BPS (2x bloodpoint offering) helps, too.
---
Imo, it is the most boring way to get bp, a total snooze fest. I will usually just dc if people are farming. Sorry everyone but I won’t be 30-40mins in a boring af match just to get some bp.
---
Can i fuck it?
---
Killer gets easier just not as fast as survivor
---
Chop Top rules step off
---
Ah yes. P O L I T I C S
---
i sometimes say ggez when i get hooked for the 4k
---
Ah ok. I think I understand but what does slugging mean. Sorry, I’m new!
---
There's allegedly supposed to be a bloodhunt from the 31st of October to the 4th of November. [Here's a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/dju52a/schedule_of_all_contents_which_will_come_on_dbd/)
---
ricochet just seems like a another decisive perk no thanks
---
I am in this video and I dont like it
---
Weeaboo.
---
Rip
---
Stop crying... All ppl DC when they see her, instead of trying to learn how to verse her. Those ppl are the real hoes.
---
Tinkerer activated surely
---
Wow what a waste
---
As a Killer, your ***&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;goal&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;*** is to sacrifice as many Survivors as possible. As a Survivor, your ***&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;goal&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;*** is to escape and avoid being caught and killed.
---
Killing 4 survivors is the GOAL. Do I need to define goal and expectation for you? You know what. I will preemptively
---
Goal: The object of a person's ambition or effort; an aim or **desired** result
---
Expectation: a belief that someone **will** or should achieve something.
---
See how they are different? See how they aren't synonyms? Your goal is to get a 4k. That does not mean you should expect to, unless you are getting wildly mismatched consistently.
---
I don't even know why you are talking to me after I already discarded your "opinion." All you are convincing me of is that you don't know what words mean fundamentally.
---
Eh? That's literally the point of the PTB, so we don't get buggy shit in live servers.
---
Well you were right about you being a fucking idiot. I'm done
---
Ooh mommy huntwess pwease don’t kwill me UwU
---
So is your mom
---
Idk if its changed since the old days but generally you point it at the top section of their neck, I dont really use flashlights much but it's worked for me recently. If not than any section of their face barring the very top should be fine
---
Take me away would need a way more drastic speed reduction than that.
---
Fuck you kid- at the end of the trial, the killer receives no bloodpoints. You receive bloodpoints equal to the killer score.
---
That's exactly what's been happening to me. It's just him and I so we can't control having bad teammates. We also don't tea bag or do anything to provoke the killer. We just play to survive and always get fucked over. It's really hard to pip up to get to better ranks when you get tunneled or camped and die.
---
"Just don't go down lol"
---
Yeah the hate is stupid. Most times, when you get to that point, it isn't gonna help you pip anyways. You'll secure extra blood points from the hooks/kills but, at that point it will barely help you rank up. Same thing for survivors, if you're alive during end game then you're most likely pipping. 
---
If survivors started playing for pips and not escapes then I think there would be less salt. Same with killers, don't play for the 4k, play for the pip.
---
Yeah your first 100 hours had teachables and rank 3 perks no cap
---
What does mori mean
---
Really excited for the halloween event to drop in November at some unknown time. Holiday season is coming up too which sucks for people who work since you can't really get time off.
---
I remapped my skill check to M5 ages ago, since my nose and eyes like to itch as soon as I start a gen.
---
Billy's always let you go
---
meg, close enough probably?
---
They are going to lose their asses if that is the case.
---
Stacks of what?
---
“iTs a leGiTiMaTe sTrAtEgY” fuck the devs honestly
---
BBQ and Chili
---
I feel ya man... logged on decided to play a survivor match for a change normally play killer.
---
10 seconds in get heartbeat so I dip in a locker and see in a straight line of sight another player get in a locker clearly where the trapper can see.. so they get grabbed and D/C... less then a minute later another guy gets downed and D/C.
---
3rd guy gets hooked I safe saved him he runs into a trap while I'm getting chased and then he D/C keep in mind this is all in about 4 minutes...
---
Trapper farms a gen with me lets me pick an item from a box, little chase, few pallet slams then downs and carries me to the hatch. It was a nice gesture whole ordeal lasted about 10 minutes...
---
Then I turned the game off because it wasn't fun and soured my desire to play tonight...
---
Mild compared to some nights I've had.
---
Yeah and for people who don't play this game religiously, that has already been our experience with the utterly stupid rank reset.
---
Thanks. I just tried using the high ground on the huntress shack to get to tier 3 on a survivor who didnt see me when she was working a Gen on the ground workes pretty well
---
I mean, its true. A rank 3 should be able to loop a rank 9 pretty well
---
She's based on an Onryo, who are victims yes, but unlike Western ghost victims they kill indiscriminately once dead. It's what sets part a Western style vengeful ghost and an Eastern style vengeful ghost. It's very unique, and you see it in movies like The Grudge or The Ring. 
---
The Ring really highlights it in the remake where the protagonist puts Samara's spirit to "rest" and thinks she'll find peace only to find out that Samara is a spirit who died so traumatically that she became a being of pure hatred and vengeance, a spirit who *wants* to hurt *everyone*. 
---
I love that last shot of Samara's face when she finally looks up from behind her hair and you just see pure, unfiltered evil in it and both the characters and the audience realize at the same time that the protagonist was a fool to think that this spirit could ever be sated by anything but the suffering of the living. Amazing filmmaking!
---
Anyway bottom line there is a logic to this.
---
Survivors are not toxic.  
---
Killers are not toxic.  
---
Toxic people are toxic.
---
The killer doesn’t keep his stuff
---
I didn't say this was my first 100 hours, the statement was unrelated.  I started on DK and got him to 40 before I played any other survivors.  The meme stands on it's own.
---
E: And it would have been a really stupid claim if I did say that, because fixated *just* came out with the new DLC
---
You know what, I respect your opinion. As much as I would love an amazing franchise in one of my favorite games, I can understand what you mean. Oh well
---
Ok but even then why is the survivor punished?
---
Another little detail the farther away you are when you stalk the slower it goes
---
We all have been there man, I’m happy to help.
---
Slugging is refered to the tactic that killers use in which they will leave the survivors in a dying state (when you get down and start crawling on the ground) instead of hooking them.
---
Why would killers do that? Well it is useful when there are 2 last survivors and you don’t want one of them to escape by the hatch.
---
In that situation, you should leave one of them on the ground, so you have 240 seconds (before the dude dies) to find the other one. That way you have time to find the survivor, find the hatch to close it or use the downed survivor as bait.
---
Btw, it is really useful to counter perks like decisive strike, so you just leave the survivor on the ground for  one minute in order to avoid the stun.
---
Oh also, If you are farming, you do that because when you escape while being downed (dying state) , you get extra blood points.
---
Sorry, we aren't allowing any post game chats of this sort, name censored or not.
---
Great now two fucking things coming out on the 22'd that i was looking foward to got delayed 
---
First Doom eternal now this shit
---
Cooked in whine I'm sure. ;)
---
For a strictly multiplayer game it really lacks in terms of quality, where as other (most free to play should I mention....) multiplayer games are really consistent in terms in-game tweaks and changes, quality improvement, of not having game-breaking bugs nearly every patch...
---
It's indicator they need to slow do with the constant feed of cosmetics and DLC (Which has been quite licenced based by the way, which I think definitely means something) and just focus on game quality and old-time events like this to be polished and released well. The forced content of it being pumped so quickly is getting kind of overwhelming imo but idk keeps the game fresh also
---
Ok, thx
---
Thanks.
---
it used to be like that, they are probably not going to change it back
---
His killer gameplay isn't top tier, but I for one found it funny. Don't speak for everyone.
---
Maybe if they increase the odds if successfully removing the trap, or add more stations to remove the trap, or also not highlight the stations for the killer.  It would be ridiculous to deal with during EGC while the pig just has to patrol the 4 stations.
---
You were stupid enough to argue my point without having a brain to realize it.. and you think I don't know the difference between 2 words because YOU couldn't grasp the difference in WHY they were being used...fucking laughable. You're low rank low effort trash and yes at this point I'm insulting you because you want something for nothing. Have a good night goof.
---
I actually tracked how useful adrenaline is in the low ranks when I was in the low ranks and it’s NOT GOOD. 
---
Most of the time the exit gates wouldn’t get powered so at low ranks it felt like adrenaline didn’t trigger about 70% of the time (you can still pip even if you don’t escape) 
---
The perks that helped me the most at lower ranks:
---
Deliverance - unhook yourself, good for obvious reasons 
---
Kindered - if you do get hooked this will typically do more for the team than deliverance, but if the team is bad enough it won’t matter. It’ll show everyone what everyone else is doing when you are on the hook AND it’ll show if you’re being camped which is good 
---
Decisive Strike - Tunnel me and die, good for obvious reasons lol 
---
Borrowed Time - Good at low ranks bc people get hooked often BUT don’t except the person with borrowed to body block for you (LIKE THEY SHOULD) bc not a lot of newer players know they can take a hit for the rescuer while they have borrowed. 
---
Bond - See where your team is, avoid leading the killer to someone else, find someone to heal you 
---
You have your own personal preference of an exhaustion perk they’re all pretty viable 
---
Hope this helps
---
[You're not wrong.](http://pm1.narvii.com/7168/1c1327d8ff592509c523b9d914b52e8de77e01c1r1-710-647v2_uhq.jpg)
---
Oh grand, postponed to an unannounced date due to mysterious "issues" literally a day before it was set to go live.
---
Welp, there goes all the excitement and desire to play again that i had for your game straight out the window.
---
Guess i'll just keep playing the games that didn't spectacularly fail on their halloween event.
---
I play mostly killer and I know being slugged sucks... but from my side its not easy. I can't speak for all killers but this is what happens for me.
---
Scenario A. I hook you and someone saves you in my face... I need to keep pressure so I slug you and chase your saviour. 1 in chase 1 on ground and 1-2 moving to heal you its great pressure.
---
Scenario B. I hook you and move away you get saved and I'm not currently chasing anyone I head back, my job is to find and kill. I return to the hook because its my latest intel that says I may find a survivor.
---
Now a few things happen I see you both if I can I slug and chase your saviour see scenario A.
---
You both run in different directions I go for your saviour because you likely will go heal so best pressure I can keep is chasing the healthy guy.
---
If I return and I see only you then I'm not ignoring you I'm going for the hit. If I see obsession is in play and I don't have an obsession  perk I'll slug it my counter to DS and creates some pressure.
---
Slugging isn't exciting but its a tool for the killer and when used right it works well.
---
___________________________________________________
---
As a killer if I slug and walk away its boring but gives you a chance to get up and I keep some pressure and can do my job.
---
If I hit you off the hook and hook you again its still some pressure but then I'm "tunneling" and ruining your fun too.
---
If your teammates safe unhook you personally I choose slug over tunnel you because you have a chance and I'm not screwing myself. 
---
Killers job is to kill I'm not going to pretend you're invisible but I will try to be a little fair because I hate being tunneled or face camped.
---
So damned if I do damned if I don't.
---
 &gt; Uses 2 words interchangeably that aren't synonyms then tries to insult someone else's intelligence.
---
Did somebody lose their child? Anybody?
---
They shouldnt be selling it if it doesnt work lol. I paid ten bucks for that shit. Hopefully tomorrow it gets fixed. I'm just bummed I guess.
---
Any idea when the event drops or is it just no idea?
---
It's true, there isn't a single good console player. Play on pc for a month. You'll see how bad u really are.
---
They are not telling so they have wiggle room in case things can't be fixed in the next few days.
---
I know. :(
---
Oh boy... Do I have some news for you
---
Fuck first the wife and kids leave now this?
---
Prepare for disappointment? I figured as much lol
---
TRUE
---
The update was postponed
---
Just burn a jar of salty lips, I heard that helps with luck.
---
I’m a simple man. I hear/see JoJo, I upvote
---
0_0
---
Wow. My condolences if that's true.
---
So glad I took 3 days off work so I could play the update first thing. Thanks, BHVR!
---
Shit worked fine on the PTB I don't understand how they can fuck up so many different things so often
---
:( till when?
---
Whoa! I went to work and did NOT expect this little post to get so popular! I really can't put into words how much I appreciate all the positive feedback and kind words. Everyone here has been incredibly kind and supportive! Also thank you so much for all you kind strangers who decided to award medals, they are my very first!   
---
Kinda sappy, but I have been interested in video editing for about a month now but just really haven't had the confidence to do anything about it. I made this in my spare time (procrastinating my exams) just as a meme for me. I didn't think it was anything special( and to an extent still do not, as there are PLENTY of absolutely AMAZING edits/editors out there, leagues ahead of my basic ass) and I expected it to get little attention. This has really inspired me to maybe cut out a little more time to do these little videos that I really enjoy making and to ultimately pursue this hobby a little more. From the bottom of my sappy ass heart. Thank you DBD community. You da real MVP.  
---
Also! For the people wondering if I got the Nancy in the end:  [https://streamable.com/pbch6](https://streamable.com/pbch6)   
---
Genuinely thank you.
---
Thanks she’s a bitch and my kid thinks basement camping is fun so only thing I’m losing is archives
---
Man, this happened to me last night as I was repairing a generator. As SOON as a skill check popped up, it happened, and I immediately got hooked.
---
Yeah same
---
No no no... combine them with gens and if totem is dull doing 10 seconds of the gen gets anyone on it the 1k boldness points.
---
If totem is lit gen glows bright shooting beam into the sky and 10 seconds into repairing the gen anyone on it gets points for cleansing. 
---
Also needs to be invisible to killer because the gen red aura hides the red glow of the totem inside.

Source?
---
nothing is tomorrow now xd
---
Ouch dude. I’ve been waiting for the 22nd all month, and they switch it up last minute?
---
Then literally don't play. Games are meant to be entertaining not a health concern.
---
I don't think you'll last so long with this game
---
We’ll have the Withering Blight for Christmas, and the Christmas Update in Summer
---
It's a lot easier to be a toxic killer than survivor anyways.  Survivors can't really speed up the game that much with perks and can only really make it toxic for other survivors assuming you don't just run insaheals every game.  Killers though have a lot more options for toxicity.,
---
Plot twist: they've never hit a skill check because they only play Killer.
---
You don't ask for Source... You ask for [SAUCE](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dl74st/bhvr_on_twitter_due_to_unforeseen_circumstances/)
---
Looking at your post history you do nothing but bitch about DbD, not something I’d expect from the “God tier player” you claim to be. Oh and this sad little superiority complex you have developed is fooling no-one. Play on console and you’d get your ass kicked with the limitations we have to deal with.
---
"Yes hon, that stupid Dwight cleansed that hex. Now he's hiding in the locker to boot! Don't worry, I'll come and get you soon! Let's sandbag him later."
---
I must agree
---
Lmao I feel you
---
Surveillance, nurse, ruin, and pop. No need to go all sweaty w prayer breads lol. That build is so simple yet highly efficient if you know what your doing
---
Anyone else disappointed that only 6 of the 15 cosmetics will be available in the event?
---
I'm happy you made this.
---
[Twitter](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dl74st/bhvr_on_twitter_due_to_unforeseen_circumstances/) .
---
I'm still in the phase of unlocking all perks for killers. Just got dbd on PC but stridor is the plan as of now
---
To be fair, almost every Update in TF2 recently has been 100% community driven and just recycled old Halloween content. Wasn’t the last “Official” Halloween Event the Go Kart/Rubber Duck thing? That was back in like 2014-2015. 
---
TF2 was luckily left to the Community, because there’s a dedicated fan base who try their best to keep the game alive.  I haven’t played since probably 2014 but from what I remember, their version of “Halloween” is just re-enabling all the previous Halloween content.
---
as a survivor main, people need to accept that if you think this is a killer favored game, odds are you are not a good player
---
You'll have more than enough from both sides after 4 games.
---
**Spectator is OP and toxic.**
---
There. I said it.
---
Man these devs are something else. Was looking forward to a rare couple of days off in a row where I could play this, then BHVR strikes again. So we have no ETA on the mid-chapter release either? No offense but what the hell is with this lack of communication/planning?
---
enjoy working at mcdonalds for the rest of your life
---
Can't yall read? It says "UNFORSEEN" circumstances. They had no idea this was gonna happen.
---
Plus, do you want the update to come out unfinished? Probably not.
---
I'm personally not a fan of this design.
---
The official forums, too. But Spirit is incapable of seeing Survivors when using her power and needs a SR addon to hide her activation noise, so it's not like she just has a better Feral Frenzy or Wraith cloak she can attack out of. You need to think further ahead, is all.
---
omg I love her

Depression isn't scary; that's my default state.
---
Same, I really want to keep liking and defending it but having a sour taste in my mouth at the clusterfuck every new release creates is finally getting old. Instead, I'm just starting to get mad at all the wasted potential this game has that gets mired in delays, missed marks, or a neverending cycle of bugs.
---
Yeah, it's kind of insulting but hey, pay us more money. Haven't we been doing a pretty good job so far?
---
"Unforseen" sounds a lot like "the bugs we were willing to accept turned out to be game-breaking."
---
Dear lord this subreddit produces some true art sometimes.
---
Imagine not having your halloween event in october
---
Gamers just leveled up.
---
Fuck, I was really looking forward to the 22nd - 1st for the event. If it's pushed back a week or two, I'll be in the middle of moving across the US. :/ Major bummer.
---
plot twist, u/Jwilky2-2 only plays killer /s
---
I had that once I think it was just an afk demo
---
no
---
go on...
---
Ah, I see you're a man of bloodpoints as well
---
Almost every match is a dc now. Or if not, some serious killer bs like prayer beads with camping mind you. Not a good night at all. Pretty sour
---
BP is like money. Can never have too much.
---
This is on mobile?
---
This isn‘t the first time BHVR doesn‘t clarify things, people keep assuming/speculating for weeks, and when the things release (or not), speculations turn out to be wrong and BHVR gets shit on for the lack of communication. Rinse and repeat.
---
At this point the only thing you can do is to sit down, grab some popcorn and enjoy how super obvious the upcoming outcry is.

okay, i guess

Yup
---
Bond and Infectious fright
---
I don’t see survivors do it much when I’m working on my rank for survivor, I don’t see it at red ranks. Now, I barely play Killer, just do dailies, so my rank stays around 16-20, every time I get a cocky rank 14-16 with a flashlight and as soon as I down them... there goes that DC lol

Did I inspire a trend?

I will make it trend because I want to.

---
I'm glad you enjoyed it!
---
Survivors don't require that much coordination?  Yes, I can back it up, I made it to Red Ranks very fast with ONE other friends, we were just messing around the whole time, not having to sweat, meanwhile as killer I struggle to get passed purple rank while sweating, unless im using spirit.
---
I want to live in the world where bunny feng exists

Jeff mains and their scary makeup
---
You talk about belittling skill of survivors? lol have you ever faced an entire team of red ranks friends as killer without using any pink addons or offerings?
---
I am hyped for the skins, not the event itself since it will be nothing but special gens and hooks. Bloodhunt is better grind wise. 
---
The skins will be obtained through the rift which will last 70 days so the event means nothing in that regard.
---
I was hyped for all of it tbh and still am, it's just put on hold I guess.
---
“The Withering Blight event won’t be tomorrow, it has been postponed until the release of the mid-chapter, which was supposed to be tomorrow. We won’t tell you more and we refuse to tell you why.”
---
^ this is what I just read
---
I only slug off hook if you got in the way of the person who dehooked you (and I mean you body blocked and I couldn't start a chase as soon). Better let you have a chance of survival rather then slap you right back on that hook, right?
---
Wow she's pretty
---
Ok, this one got me to actually comment. Good work, and relatable...
---
Spine chill for survivor since you can't have anything that really helps in a chase so better not even get into one.
---
BBQ for killer since I mostly play Hillbilly or Huntress.
---
Tysm!
---
I’m gonna be honest, I don’t care about events for this game so this doesn’t bother me too much one way or the other. But the fact that this shit keeps happening and the how the devs just randomly drop this info less than 24 hours before the event is embarrassing lol.
---
You listen to music while playing killer? what? how? sound is like 1/2 of the game.
---
As I have noted in my other post, I wasn’t sure if the gate was just a tap away from being done or sitting at 90%. He could’ve just hit me and slugged me, and that was a chance I didn’t want to take.
---
The tec industry is volatile. All it takes is one strange bug to be discovered and everything's pushed back half a week. No doubt they didn't know before today either.
---

Disappointed but not surprised in the slightest, BHVR sure knows how to disappoint their player-base. What a sham.

Pointless to stockpile BPS since the halloween event has its own dedicated offering. Stockpiling bloodpoints to be able to pick up a bunch of halloween offerings would be much more useful.
---
Like I said, used to being hated on occasionally but it’s like Legion gets a different response
---
All I can hear is WRYYYYYYYY
---
&gt; basic expectations in the three years I have played this game. I love them and the game to death but I often question decisions and their ability. I also understand there is leeway with them being a much smaller company then Ubi, EA, Activision, CDPR, and so on. But with this being their flagship game, the amount of broken promises (and patches) is inexcusable at this point. This is a three year old game that announced they’d be getting dedicated servers at E3, had that delayed, cancelled events to work on said servers, delayed the servers, and now can’t even deliver on arguably the best (RESKINNED) holiday event for the game, and happens on the same day every year.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; That is insane.
---
Maybe they could've said something sooner than 12 hours before the event was supposed to go live????
---
i took a long break after pig came out, since then i have mini burnouts where i will touch the game for maybe a few hours then get back into the game fully
---
It’s more of why the hell is it happening so much since I got legion
---
&gt;If youre hyped for this event you probably didnt play the blight event in 2018, its terrible as fuck, all you see is farming, and in the top ranks killer queues was about 45 min - 1 hour
---
2018 Blight event had the harvesting thingy. This year's doesn't.
---
no problem lol
---
in the description, it says "Replaces **Dream Snares** with **Dream Pallets**." so, yeah, no way to get them together
---
not coming out tomorrow :/
---
of course saikron these hive minded idiots gave you -10 points on a reply that wasn't even malicious. lol i swear reddit is home of the hive minded pansy ass bitches. lol these are the same fucking pussies who gave me -25 karma just for asking why i was missing some cosmetics lol so im not surprised. luckily i dont give a flying fuck about karma so i'll stay speaking my mind
---
A day? You're lucky.
---
Here in Europe I just woke up to have the news. It was supposed to come out today, ffs :/
---
You got downvoted for posting the same thing the devs posted about the Blight event being postponed:
---
&gt;Just as a reminder, no Blood Hunt has been announced. Please don't get your hopes up until we announce something. I really can't stress this enough, if we don't announce it, it's not confirmed.
---
Seriously. So many crybabies in this sub right now. 
---
"BHVR U BETER FIX UR GAME OR IM GOIN 2 QUIT 4 GUD!!!1"
---
Get over yourselves, you have to wait a few more days to get the content. Go outside, go workout, go read a book, go play other games, no one gives a fuck you entitled idiots rofl. You're all going to come back and play whether you cry in a reddit post or not
---
What?
---
Does BT and deliverance work together in same build ??
---
Do they usually not have that shit in Halloween stores?
---
i like the neck tat
---
Well, that's why we need to buff the other Killers! Meta Spirits are the only thing that have a chance at top ranks. She needs a vaulting animation, grass disruption, and apparently her beads should swap with one of her UR perks for ranking, but sound isn't that precise. She's not INVINCIBLE, and everyone being used to her also means people know that, she's just oversaturated because your options post-Nurse rework are Spirit or get BMed, at least until people relearn Nurse.
---
Yugioh anime is pretty lackluster, except during GX (until final season) and Arc-V
---
They've done this before? I was uninstalled that year.
---
Ranking system is completely fine, I've gotten to rank 1 in multiple seasons and get fair matchups in 98% of the games. The dedicated servers have been literally perfect in every game I've played with them. Community is hostile but NO WHERE near league. This is coming from a player who has been challenger multiple times and has played since beta (ill provide pics if you don't believe me), every killer can be played at red ranks. I hit red rank killer playing trapper, cannibal, and wraith ONLY (three of the "worst" killers). I've hit rank 1 survivor WITHOUT using decisive strike, borrowed time, adrenaline, and dead hard so this isn't true either it sounds like you just need to get good. Male female comparison made me face palm so I won't get any more into that. 
---
Yeah overall it just sounds like you're complaining just to complain.
---
Yeah you are correct. It sounded cool on paper but I can imagined it went this way. We'll see how it goes ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
And they are sincerely nice in the post game chat 99% of the time.
---
since it is looking like this. this might be a late April joke ????
---
Bubba and trapper protecting their basement...
---
You must be new here.
---
Try saying Spirit isn't OP.
---
Honestly I was way more hyped for the rift and tome thing than I was the event.
---
100% Agree, Representing an anime that resonates with you/That you enjoy should totally disqualify your opinion in an unrelated game, Clearly joking. If someone says your opinion doesn't count it's always their opinion that is worth little to said community so they try to bring others down to their level
---
I saw Otz use a bodyblock build with her that worked well on at least Springwood.
---
How does this news stop you from doing so? This delay doesn’t impact your ability to play the game in any way. Just buy it and have fun and when the update comes out play it some more!
---
Oh well, see you in November.
---
Some people don't like legion and then they search for things to say against a legion player.. and some people don't like anime.. so they try to troll you like this 
---
Just ignore these people or reply that they must have studied science
---
If your teammate unhooks like a bot and farms you without BT and the killer downs you then goes after the unhooker, you complain when they have mercy and don't hook you again/play around DS. Would you like it more if you get immediately rehooked?
---
A Zombie Sugar-Daddy
---
Or that unexpected power outage on Thursday might of deleted some unsaved data. 
---
While do y'all gotta be so inpatient? I can also guarantee you it's still gonna happen this week.
---
So worth the effort!
---
Doctor + Freddy/Legion/Plague = T3 Madness making you unable to wake up/mend/cleanse for a really horrible experience :)
---
There’s rumors that The Teacher will be the next killer or some game mechanics initially meant for The Teacher will be incorporated into the next killer. 
---
There’s others that believe that Pennywise might be the next killer but I think it’s a little far fetched. I think it’s more wishful thinking than anything else.
---
Personally, I REALLY hope it’s The Teacher. Guess we’ll find out in late October or early November
---
Guess I’m finding a different game to play for the rest of the month.
---
If people are constantly sneaking over your traps, you probably aren’t placing them effectively.
---
Hag is the only Killer I’ve been able to reach Rank 2 with. I would definitely NOT call her a “Great Low-Tier” because even with just good Perks, you can do fairly well without even using good Add-Ons.
---
I can’t even say “practice facing her as Survivor” because I see a Hag Player maybe once every month or so. 
---
She is a super strong Killer with great area-denial and Map Coverage. Try to invest Bloodpoints into her and gain as many Perks as you can, and try something out that fits your playstyle.
---
I like to use Ruin/Haunted Grounds/Surveillance/Monitor and Abuse, since it gives you good Generator Progress Slowdown, and makes your Terror Radius tiny, giving Survivors less time to crouch over your traps, and more time for them to panic and run away, setting off more traps.
---
Ummmmmmmmmmmm  are u blind? Killers swing at air and hit you in dedicated
---
I've searched for the later tomes but found nothing.. are there any videos or something where they show all challenges for all tomes? I wanted to download the PTB a day too late
---
This october and november?
---
I've seen afk wraiths in the corners of the map , you'll get out of the game if there's no killer . (Can't confirm that cause dead by buglight but that's what happens most of the time )
---
Blasphemy
---
Yes
---
This was beautiful, thank you
---
dang
---
Opinion! That’s my opinion!
---
u playing Susie/Julie?
---
WGLF &amp; BT
---
Noed spirit
---
Does that part matter to some degree? Cause I have frank (default) and Julie, switching between them every now and then
---
What platform?
---
You disrespect Joey Wheeler?! The greatest anime character of all time!
---
The terror radius would 100% interfere with sounds of Doc charging his electroshock. I totally get why you made those choices, but if implemented, it would be harder to guess when (and if) he's about to zap. In general, i think that custom music should not use or reference sounds killer makes during the trial. Listen to the Spirit custom chase music - it's unmistakably Spirit-like yet has nothing that could be mistaken for her phase-walking
---
My sentiment as well. I imagine it was just too big ridden to release.
---
Honestly he was the only redeeming part of the first series
---
A pirate or a zombie, hopefully a combination of the two.
---
Yeah they release new killers every 2-3 months. Plus, they already confirmed a new killer would be released before the end of the year.
---
I estimate they will announce the killer in late October or early November since they still need to do a PTB. It usually takes them 3-4 weeks for them to release a new killer after announcing them. 
---
Personally, I think the killer will be announced the first week of November and released the second week of December.
---
Moring them is not stream sniping.  
---
Stream sniping is specifically watching their stream at the same time as you play the game against them, in order to get an advantage over them.  
---
Using a Mori on a person with TTV in their name is nothing like stream sniping, it's just singling out a person for their name.
---
Survivor : BL/Iron will
---
Killer : Ruin/Whispers

Yeah I didn’t even read them until after you said it. I’m fairly new

Rank 16 NOED 1 Spirit with literally no perks, yeah.
---
I can't run NOED but they can run Adrenaline/Self-care/Balanced Landing?
---
hmm. interesting
---
&gt;the second the first one gets hooked
---
i dont think noed was a factor
---
I dont care as long as its original
---
Selfcare is another killer perk
---
thats hype. probably gonna save up auric cells now
---
I’d queue plague with those pink add one any day over spirit.
---
On pc you get the points and keep your items , idk why is that different from console .
---
Honestly would kill for a Jeepers Creepers Killer and The Fisherman from I Know What You Did Last Summer.
---
Lmao, no shit buddy. I was just point out that this dude is playing spirit with noed
---
IDK, I don't think any of the other games have ranking systems with no rewards or no real reason for a rank reset (what exactly is the reason for the rank reset? What do the seasons even mean?). 
---
People are allowed to enjoy a game and be frustrated with the \*\*ongoing\*\* failure of the developers; correct me if I'm wrong, but they just received some $$$ backing too. It is difficult to argue that they are managing themselves properly when it's error after error, delay after delay with this particular company. People are allowed to be disappointed.
---
Thats all skill dependent tho, you can play any killer at red rank, I myself has used every killer cept the new ones from ghostface up to get to rank1 no perks/no addons. The thing is, you need to be so much better than any player on the surv team, and if even one of them is close to your skill level you will get fucked. Luckily BHVR made getting rank1 surv super easy so there are so many potatoes you can just pray on.
---
Don't listen to this guy \^; I don't want longer wait times!!!
---
Please don't use prayer beads , it's the equivalent of iridescent head/ omegablink and so on . It's one of the worst things to go against in the game , if not the worst . Try survivor against that and see how's it . (Said from someone who plays both sides , more killer tho)
---
Yeah this would definitely get you banned. People would change the music to be silent so they can hear more.
---
What are you talking about? It's a nurse and they were hit by the rank reset too. You don't loop a nurse at pallets. You have to try to mind game her. No matter how good you are, you almost always get hooked once. Especially with a 4 blink nurse.
---
I’ve seen more ebony moris during the last bloodpoints event
---
Dude, this is freaking awesome. I love the dio reeeee at the end
---
I'm only rank 10, so thankfully all of my survivors cleanse constantly and I'm rolling in 4ks lol.
---
Even if they didn't, being an m1 killer isn't so bad when everyone is coughing and you can hear them a mile off because of the coughing and violent vomiting.
---
&gt; I almost expect a challenge where you force the 4 survivors to disconnect from a match
---
That one actually seems pretty easy. Just play Doctor with Unnerving, Distressing, Overcharge, and Dying Light, double calm addons and a Jigsaw Piece.
---
Or Freddy with Ruin, Pop, Dying Light, Thanatophobia, Swing Chains, and either Jump Rope or Red Paint Brush.
---
Or Huntress with Iri Head, Infantry Belt, Whispers, Nurse's Calling, Franklin's Demise, and Iron maiden with an Ebony Mori. 
---
Or go back in time, break into BHVR HQ and change the files around so Legion and Dying Light never got reworked, and run him with Frank's Mixtape, Cold Dirt, Ebony Mori, Sloppy Butcher, Old Dying Light, Thanatophobia, and Franklin's Demise.
---
Plus you clearly didn't miss the part where I was off for a week, I'm rusty. You would be to.
---
NOED+Rancor is the ultimate power move lol
---
Better play ghosty for that , he stalks at 100% efficiency at long ranges
---
Welp I’m stealing this
---
&gt; IDK, I don't think any of the other games have ranking systems with no rewards or no real reason for a rank reset (what exactly is the reason for the rank reset? What do the seasons even mean?).
---
I thought he meant that ranked was shit due to bad matchmaking. If he meant what you're saying, then I agree with that. There should be some kind of rewards whether it be blood points or auric cells or shards on how high your rank is at the end of a season.
---
Typical.
---
Unlike myers with 1% efficiency
---
That actually looks terrifying
---
Removed for multiple disconnects
---
Searching for this too here
---
Plague probably needs the Legion / Freddy treatment, a complete rework (even though Legion was more of a gutting than a proper rework). 
---
You can't increase the penalty for staying sick to force survivors to cleanse without changing how strong the corrupt purge is.
---
I 100% agree here, and I played plenty of games with a small dev team where stuff like this happens frequently aswell. 
---
But the difference is transparency, those other games usually states what’s wrong and why they postponed it.  
---
Knowing what’s happening helps (in my case).
---
If Herman were actually black then it would have to be reflected in his lore, given that he supposedly did top government work in the 50s hmmm noooo
---
With the mid-chapter update and there's no ETA on that update.
---
W
---
I think it’s understandable that they don’t want to cause a controversy. At the end of the day, it’s their choice
---
There's not ETA on the mid-chapter update.
---
Dafuq i need to hear survivors breathing so i can slaughter them
---
We have others to look forward to ig
---
They never fail to deliver!
---
.. or do they?
---
I bet you're fun at parties
---
I don't know how to get it on ios
---
Can you calm the fuck down? you aint losing shit from a postboned event.
---
Hearing 1:45 right when Michael starts a chase would be fucking terrifying.
---
(Bunny Feng, Shirtless Myers, and Withering Blight walk in)
---
Community: Oh I... I thought you were dead.
---
BHVR: My death was... greatly exaggerated.
---
I would change the last one to "for every survivor that has more points than you at the end of a trial, you recieve x% extra bloodpoints in all categories."
---
It seems related to dedicated servers in terms of hitting on the hook.
---
As a Doctor main I can just enter treatment mode and spam M1 as fast as physically possible. Even faking the unhook doesn't usually work as I'm mashing M1 so goddamn fast it'll do the grab anyway.
---
TBH I can NEVER get grabs to work. I can be right behind them, tap m1 (Not a lunge) and it'll do the hit. Only grabs I can reliably do are Doctor treatment mode M1 spam grabs.
---
That's why you play on pc instead
---
Got any more tips on huntress? Im kinda interested in playing her.
---
Also what sensitivity do you play her at? And how do you deal with finding survivors and how do you deal with terrible maps.
---
Thanks ! :)
---
Hopefully in your case that killer isnt licensed.
---
I mean it’s okay if you’re new. But this new was rank 7 with ds, dh, iron will, and adrenaline. She was either attempting to keep my hostage in the game or just being a horrible teamate.
---
Oh no. I have to wait a few extra days. The humanity.
---
&gt;he much-expected dedicated servers cause more problems than they solve
---
Bruh STOP. Dedicated Servers are not final - they are in BETA. But because all of these fucks screamed for it but dont test the PTB whenever it is out they kinda have to get their data from somewhere else. So they gotta test it on live to make it work. Just so u dumbfucks finally understand this.
---
The rest of your BS post aint even worth replying to.
---
These look absolutely amazing especially for me cause I always spend too much time looking for a specific perk but I believe with this idea I'd just look for the survivor portrait instead! But what about the general perks? What background will they have?
---
The dwight main usually have an hormonal discharge when entering a locker
---
It means killing a survivor with their own hands by using certain perks, offerings, addons. (Mori, Devour Hope, Rancor or Tombstone)
---
Killer trying to depip for less competitive games to farm BP during event.
---
Oh ok, thanks for the reply
---
Their lack of communication over bugs that we have pointed out is definitely frustrating. I've pointed out several times about the hair problem that has been a major issue since Stranger Things but there's no acknowledgement at all. Not even a "We'll look into it but we're really busy with other bugs atm".
---
So the solution is to whine on Reddit? You've not given me an explanation for why everyone is acting up, just an excuse.
---
&gt; last who was sitting on hatch and friend dcd just so they could still get the win, and even then they flame me in chat saying ez game,
---
Yes the Tactical Disconnect. AKA dat *Tier One Operator Survivor Team Six 10000000 IQ "DC Into Hatch Tech"* literally the pinnacle of survivor gameplay.
---
I can't wait for DC husks.
---
Cool ideas, but they sound like they would be bad for the game.
---
*slow clap*
---
I dont know for now :/
---
This is just amazing!
---
I love being a Doctor main because if survivors are trying to bully me I can just find the closest 3 gens and torture them with a 3-gen setup until they DC or let me kill them.
---
I just watched scream 2 not even a week ago. Not as good as scream 1 but still good for a cheesy 90s slasher parody
---
For killers perks it will be the same but for non-teachables perks i dont have and idea for now
---
It's too bad about starbreeze. I dont even think payday can save them now. I'm glad they sold the rights to Dbd though because what a shit show that company is.
---
Why ? :o
---
Where are the hair fixes BHVR? How about those competition winner outfits?
---
Thanks :)
---
If nobody heals everyone is permanent one shot.
---
Wow you learned that Prayer Beads allows for mindlessly easy 4K's.  I'd start a YouTube channel to help spread this 1000 IQ original strategy of yours.  The masses must know of this.

I've had a couple of those this week. I hate it.
---
a openion i can kinda get behind
---
I usually start with totems, because (a) I know where to look for them on most maps so can take them out fairly efficiently, (b) noed is quite popular and most survivors don't actively do totems (also they're worth quite a few bloodpoints) and (c) the killer is usually patrolling gens at the start of the game because that's where they're expecting the survivors to be, so it reduces chances of being the first one found. After doing all totems, or if I decide gens aren't being done quickly enough and I need to pitch in with that, I usually prioritise the central generator to avoid 3-gen. It's up to personal preference though. My strategy, for example, relies on others not doing the same thing, so it's good for everyone to have a slightly different approach.
---
[The truth](https://i.imgflip.com/3dzi1y.jpg)
---
Object of Obsession until the new patch, then Spine Chill. Nothing comes close to the information OoO gives you. It tells you wear traps are placed, where the killer is and if he is chasing someone, and can make unorthodox things loops (like the car piles. If you keep breaking LoS while still having the aura reading, the killer will have a hard time catching up, and you don't even need a pallet). 
---
Once all the stealth killers gain Undetectable, the perk will be a lot harder to use, so I also chose Spine Chill. Spine Chill can allow you to better juke Spirit during her phase and know if she actually is phasing or faking. It can help give you that one extra second of warning. And I'm not sure if it will still work against killers with Undetectable, but if it does, then that's good.
---
For killers, it's BBQ. Points + great info.
---
There is a difference between a hostile community and people being just SUPER fed up with how little braincells this community actually has, This entire thread is filled with people who have ZERO arguments, complain out of full spite because an event is delayed which holds no down side for them at all. THAT is a perfect example of a hostile community more than me telling you to become fucking real about this dedicated server nonsense. Some of ya'all should stop beliving everything streamers say in the heat of a moment.   
---
The average Reddit Killer main wouldnt even know if a hit is scuffed because of dedicated servers or because they cant abuse their latency anymore.  
---
My profile is fillded with nice commets tho because I am pretty pleasend to play with. Hope yours is too, by so much anger about dumb stuff I can imagine it aint.
---
It's an exploit , don't abuse it cause it's bannable , probably the devs won't have a problem with it since it wasn't intentional , it happened to me as well on the ptb , just don't try to abuse that (some people did it) . Just tell the devs maybe and don't use splinters for a while if possible .
---
That trapper was very good
---
Well atleast I can do my school work peacefully
---
As much as that’s cool I personally would just love to have the new mask. 
---
It’s personally my favorite mask and it looks better then all his other masks.
---
They said the event drops on the 23rd. Still a day away
---
The one tap on tier 3 always works good if you wait until you get super close to pop it. Idk how many times I was too far away when I let t3 activate and I get looped until it goes away.

People will make fun of you for using the "Anime uwu" versions, frankly yes, its dumb people use ur PFP as a point against you, trust me ik. look at my reddit pfp and you will understand
---
But just ignore it, you are giving them what they want. Just call them children or something then leave
---
I would love to have 'Shape hunts Allyson' as a chase music for Micheal.
---
AND camp the totem so it doesn’t get destroyed in 30 seconds AND waste a perk slot that could be useful for other perks AND waste another perk slot of you want to know when the totem is being worked on but not have to stand near it the whole game while gens pop left right and centre. Devour hope is an incredibly fun perk when it works, but the problem is that it never works.
---
Another way of looking at it is to remember that UE's 100% doesn't mean 100% of your walking speed, but 100% of the survivor base walking speed, so Fixated won't affect it. All speeds in the game, when expressed as percentages, are relative to the survivor base walking speed. So for example, most killers move at 115% speed by default. That's what the numbers in the UE description mean, they don't refer to you personally.
---
 This one is really good :
---
1 Corrupt intervention/Ruin
---
2 Nurse's calling
---
3 Monitor &amp; Abuse
---
4 STBFL (Save the best for last)
---
Other good perks if you don't have those : Sloppy Butcher , Make your choice , Franklin's Demise (if they have flashlights) .
---
Drink all the vommy mommy vommy you like! Makes you big and strong ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ

I like her fruit punch vommy.
---
Bring on the Winter Solstice event!
---
Lol I play on PC and I just remember hiw frustrating controllers are
---
They are probably just covering grounds because of the leaked date. This doesn't mean they can't do a surprise bloodhunt to make it up for the postponed blight event.
---
Alright, thanks man.
---
F
---
If this was some free to play mobile game I wouldn’t care but this is unacceptable for a game this popular. The developers are pretty useless.

Ah yes, It's big brain time

Hah! I hit the 5th downvote !!

&gt; No update tomorrow sadly. We haven't shared a date yet for the Mid-chapter update but the event was announced for the 22nd so we had to announce the delay today. We ran into a few issues which forced us to delay the release of the event to the Mid-chapter release. (ETA still unannounced)

Pretty sure it's all servers. I just got DC'd from a game and got a rank update error.
---
Dammit it’s 2:25AM Claymore lemme sleep lmao
---
I tested it today whilst doing custom games with a group and their loadouts changed to what they'd been doing in a custom game and this seemed a mystery to all four of them, is this supposed to happen?
---
Don’t you have phones?
---
 I don't see what's wrong with expressing your disappointment in a misery loves company fashion. It doesn't really affect the devs, but it does help release frustration.
---
 As for why it's frustrating it's because I was really excited for it and now I'm disappointed, it's that simple. To you it might not be as exciting or important but I was counting down the days and I'm sure I'm not the only one.
---
 And it can definitely be the last straw, afterall the devs have been fucking up a lot, it might kill someone's desire to play the game and on that sense it is the last straw that broke the camel's back and made them leave.
---
They hated him because he was condescending and self-important, if the quote is to apply to you, I see your comment as a way to show us how much better you are because you're too cool to care and must shit on people who do, you can't really think this tone is gonna inspire intelligent discussion.
---
This comment is so fucking stupid it reads as a parody of a stupid fucking survivor main. But you’re totally serious. fucking shit
---
He has the balls to do that
---
Oh that's just how I was thinking of it. And maybe to make it fairer you had to play all four characters (Shaun, Liz, Edd and... hmmm. I forget his name, Neil? Shit one outta the bunch there but if you wanted to go true to the scene. Each has to have the perk on to take part and missing a skill check allows the killer to grab the pool cue and stab you through the chest with it, killing you instantly so it wouldn't be something people would undertake lightly.
---
Holy shit, what if it was the exit gate? Killer blocks it triggering the action, successful use allows you to stun him and knock him down allowing 3 seconds for escape. 
---
Like, frankly I would pay a £20+ DLC just for that, it would be utterly amazing and honestly it would be so much fun. 
---
Shouts 'Sorry we're closed!' When activating the perk, either in the Winchester pub map which could work beautifully with both my ideas or the exit.
---
Also zombie counterpart, Shauns Dad and Shauns mom, Shaun's Dad is turned and bites slow awkward NPC Shaun's Mom, you have to escort her and if she wanders away she gets bitten but if you're not paying close attention you wont notice and have to stay in a group to keep her with you and she will get bitten and turn in and then bite someone if you don't kill her fast enough and the zombie sickness can spread through the group in a similar manner to head traps and The Pig, each survivor gets caught by Shauns parents (NPC Mom and Killer Dad) and bitten and goes through stages of being 'Infected' and will havd to choose whether to reveal their state or risk infecting the group but getting to escape, the terror in Zombie movies is that factor a lot of the time, people becoming risks, not knowing who to trust, having no choice but to kill your friends (which could be an option, attempt to get them out in time or kill them with a rock and stop them infecting you, could be easier as a group, harder alone, alone maybe you risk getting overpowered.
---
Either way about it this has a tone of potential imo.
---
You should count it as a win. A single game gave you 2.5k hours of fun. That’s not by any means a failure or shortcoming of the game. Very few games can do that
---
Wonder why it got removed.... Cause everyone spams this bug left amd right to reddit.
---
hell i cannot connect at all when i finaly reach the menu it kick me back saying no internet
---
Add tenacity for 30%faster crawling and recovery while crawling, it's pretty legit
---
New doctor lore! He is constantly watching fresh Prince and thats why he is laughing
---
I agree with the comments so far just wanted to see if anyone know a way to add some fun tonthis game again.
---
I tried fun builds etc but as i wrote before a lot of them are just bad
---
When you DC after certain conditions like being downed or hooked shouldn't the game just lock you out of the blood web and receiving bloodpoints for 3 games?
---
Then if you persist... lock your rank at 20 for the month so you dont end up playing with those actually progressing? 🤷‍♂️
---
It has gotten silly and I didnt really notice it till I started reading this subreddit 🤔🤗🤣
---
Well DBD hasn't changed their formula or meta at all for the past whatever time but 2.5k hours I'd see myself at that point not playing DBD for fun more for trying dumb shit.
---
Try out deathgarden. It's a fresh experience and it's a decent amount of fun. It could use the extra players too.
---
PC
---
Susie is so adorable uwu
---
According to the devs, yes indeed
---
It's a drag queen, her name is Monét X Change!
---
Didnt they have a power outage that delayed the archives stream, it could have affected things
---
honestly I would just take a few months, maybe a year break and come back once there is alot to catch up. Thats what I did to LoL after playing for the first 5 years and taking a 4 year break

Just hurting the ppl who maybe enjoy the game
---
Makes sense. Thx mate
---
People who uninstalled the game but still stuck around to whine are completely pathetic. Congratulations
---
well I mean if you truly don't enjoy the game anymore maybe time to branch out to a new game
---
Now just make 4999 more to buy a perk in the bloodweb! Jk you did a good job 👍
---
I never give anyone the hatch any more. I slap them down, close the hatch, then carry them to the door and allow them to escape through the gate.  If I'm gonna lose my "no one escaped" points to be a nice dude I'm damn sure gonna recoup some of the loss with "hatch closed" points.
---
Can you do this on PS4 or is it just on PC?
---
Otz legion build be like
---
yeah i keep forgetting there is a new platform and mobile as well as that they have to keep track of.
---
TBH I would personally be completely happy if they just skipped a chapter or two and focused on some major balance changes and fixing the game. I don't need new perks when the same effect could be achieved by simply buffing some trash tier ones (Monstrous Shrine lmao) and we already have a good selection of characters in the game.
---
There is a reddit post with list. All killer and survivor challenges earn you 35 out of 70 levels
---
Some are stupid hard like with NOED sacrifice 3 survivors after endgame collapse in 1 game loooool
---
Or bear trap 6 in 1 game what if you get 5 and they dc??
---
Play the game the way you want to play, that always riles them up
---
I second this notion.
---
Wow hes so fast at genrushing
---
I’ve got no audio right now, but the editing alone gives it away for me.

Wait if the gate wasnt opened then bloodwarden does nothing right? Also is that a rank reset meme

I didn't know that but now i share their disgust. We can find better
---
ok but???? rhino????
---
Na, assuming you the totem isn’t in an incredibly obvious spawn and you aren’t running Ruin, most survivors will just plant themselves on a gen. By the time they get the 3rd gen done, I’ll have gotten the 3rd stack, and will have hooked the guy for my 4th stack. The game takes a huge 180 when survivors realize they need to start looking for Devour. By camping the totem, I can inevitably get the 5th stack. All I need is one mori before I’m not bothered about defending the totem. But games where the totem spawns out in the openis usually a gg.
---
Everyone agrees that the game is challenging for killers, my point is no one acknowledges that survivor is also challenging.  I don't know why everyone talks about teams when that is the marked case, solo queue is very popular and not all players are red ranks.  The game shouldn't be balanced for a handful of interactions, it should be balanced to be fun for everyone.  And it mostly is, though it is much harder on survivor at high ranks and gets better as you go higher because of less dead weight even in solo queue.  But still takes a lot of skill and wordless coordination.
---
*Halloween music stops*
---
Wraith main, I can attest to this. I will let the last survivor go...
---
1. If they are baby and managed to be the last survivor
---
2. They sold out and afker
---
3. The first survivor instantly disconnects on hook
---
4. I sacrificed the other toxic survivors
---
5. The other survivors left them behind as soon as they got a teabag in
---
6. They generally weren't toxic...
---
7. Just because really
---
I don't get a lot of 4ks.
---
Maybe they realised that the Archives and Rift are kinda integral to the Halloween event and that releasing them at different times was a weird choice in the first place.
---
I mean, everyone seemed to think the mid chapter update was coming out tomorrow with the Halloween event.
---
Good trappers at red ranks are terrifying tbh. I always enjoy playing against Entity's Left hand
---
I only solo queue.  Survivors still coordinate, but wordlessly and using inferences about one another's behavior.
---
Run enduring+ spirit fury and bait pallets with your power ;)
---
Alright, you have a strategy I didn’t consider. I respect that. Also openis lol
---
That's a counter to a specific situation, not a killers entire ability. Do you have any of your own arguments or are you just going to regurgitate what I assume to be a YouTuber said and repeat it as fact?
---
This is why I use a wired controller
---
It's supposed to be the 22nd.
---
Controller user
---
It really makes no sense,especially if you consider the fact that they *just* got a fresh batch of players with Stranger Things, and they have a *Halloween* event with a new feature coming up, so lots of players will be checking out the game.
---
I get that we had one Hunt recently but this game has tons of Perks already, for new players it would help so much. Don't see a single reason why a Bloodhunt would be bad now.
---
Hopefully the archives have enough BP rewards to make up for it.
---
Let me know if you have any criticisms!
---
I miss Max and Chloe
---
Hahah as soon as I heard them say that, I knew something was up. I doubt they had any sort of power outage, they were just looking into whatever this current problem is. Seems like they thought they could fix it until today since nothing was said at the livestream, but guess not.
---
Just play the game as a new one, learn in the process. It's still the same "repair gens and escape" vs "kill everyone" game.
---
and sent him a dick pic
---
What the fuck is wrong with people.
---
highly recommend you play it. i enjoyed it more than the original game
---
"Mama always said life is like a group of survivors, you never know what you are gonna get!"
---
ayyy i agree
---
same :(
---
Did you bother to check their twitter or like. Anything? They said they postponed it to the mid chapter update because of some issues
---
Its a lie, you arent allowed to boop the snoot.   
---
Just ask u/Zenora_Vivian
---
It doesnt have to be sexual, its just not safe to mention.
---
Wasn't it? What the fuck? I'm so confused now

aww don't be sad dwight :(

...But Mike is with me so how can he be with you then??

I never claim to be a godlike player. Stfu. I have over 300 hours on console it's ez af. Quit your bullshitting and get good at the game, pc players on dbd atleast are better. You cannot say otherwise. Name 10 godlike console players. Exactly. 0.

It's even worse when your game is a horror game. It's like playing a Santa Workshop MMO all of the way through the year but, when it gets to December, they have to postpone the Christmas event for a month.
---
So do I, friend. Zoey was always my favorite character of l4d.
---
*Laughs in Decisive Strike*
---
Source video? I need to watch the full thing for...research
---
The devs are now saying that since the bloodhunt was never officially announced, to not get your hopes up for one. Until it’s announced it’s still not official
---
I reall hope the devs didn't get shit on for the "if we don't announce it, it's not confirmed" because It wouldn't surprise me if there are some people goin like "Oooh BHVR all high and mighty excusing their failures." These would most likely be the same people complaining that there isn't a bloodhunt when there never was a bloodhunt announced.
---
You people need some church in your life, preferably not Plague's church
---
Once.
---
Disabling chat and messaging saves you a lot of sanity.
---
It only works 10% because killers will just move their camera to hit you and you’ll usually go down 5 seconds later unless you’re able to pull off something crazy. Unfortunately, 360s are very situational which is a shame because they’re quite difficult to pull off
---
OhTofu has an hour long guide on billy. He covers everything from more advanced techniques, to perk, to add ons. It's got all the answers you need
---
I mean, gamble on killer giving hatch, or DS and ensure your death? Id take the hatch gamble
---
It doesn't, there never was a bloodhunt announced.

---
Sooo, do i find the entire pic on r/dbdgonewild or is this the whole pic?
---
Last year it was even worse, you could only unlock 3 (one outfit) until the backlash got so crazy they had to increase it
---
You must not be placing them in the right areas. The best hag mains will only place an obvious trap at a hook, but all of the others are saved for where there's heavy foot traffic for survivors. For example, on Ormand's resort, it may be a good idea to trap a couple of entrances to the main building since so many survivor's go through the lodge. Same goes for Haddonfield. Rather than trapping the gen in the Strode house, trap a couple of paths that *lead* to the Strode house.
---
The perk 'accidents happen' sounds like you got spooked my a fully stacked devour hope
---
Awesome
---
Thank you for letting me know of this sub's existence.
---
Naw, just a reference to the running joke in the movie where people keep getting killed (or rather killing themselves) while Tucker n Dale are.trying to fix up their house.
---
7 games for 70 says straight? I guess I'm quitting my job / social life.
---
Additionally, this feels really geared to a hardcore demographic instead of the more casual audience they are trying to garner. Specially since new players won't have specific perks.
---
BE GONE FILTH
---
Me too man. I 100% thought the mid-chapter patch was coming at the same time but the devs are claiming otherwise. Clusterfuck of communication on their part.
---
this made my morning, thanks
---
&gt;!WRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!&lt;
---
You also get points toward your Emblem for totems
---
Bubba is that you?
---
I play at 100% sensitivity now; it might be a little rough at first or if the game lags, but IMO it's better for every Killer in the long run.
---
Finding Survivors is either perks or paying attention and guessing. Huntress is the easiest Killer to play immersed against and, because of her already low movement speed, it's the best way to Survive against her. 
---
Whispers, BBQ, Iron Maiden, Nurse's Calling, Discordance, and Rancor are all good tracking perks for her if you're struggling. 
---
Whispers helps you avoid places where there are no Survivors, BBQ and Iron Maiden mean any Survivor outside of 40 meters will be revealed after a hook (and you'll reload faster), Nurse's Calling is good since her Terror Radius is smaller than the perk range, Discordance helps you find at least half the Survivor team and can give you a chance to get multiple downs (it also doesn't depend on mobility as much as Surveillance does), and Rancor reveals all Survivors any time a gen pops; which can be very helpful against immersed teams.
---
That said playing against stealth is possible without perks. 
---
If you lose a Survivor or find a gen without a Survivor, look for scratch marks. No scratchmarks means they're walking, crouching, or using a perk to hide them. Poised and Dance With Me are the only perks that hide scratchmarks as long as of now; so unless a gen pops, they quickly exit a lot cker or they fast vault a window no scratchmarks means they're moving slowly.
---
Check the immediate area for them and think about they've acted previously/how you think they'll act. A neon Nea that is good at chases probably won't try to crouch in a corner, so you might want to check by a pallet or a window vault. A P3 Claudette that tries to crouch everywhere will probably be in a corner or behind an object. Obviously this is largely guesswork and depends on the Survivors; so always use *your* judgement and try to make the best guess from the available places to hide and where you think they'd hide. You'll get better at this the longer you play, but there can always be a moment where someone pulls a Houdini.
---
Also keep an eye on crows. If a crow is flying away from a distant object a Survivor is there. If a crow is returning a Survivor was there recently and may or may not still be there. Remember which crows you've disturbed as well, if you scared it a Survivor didn't.
---
Hope that helps with stealth.
---
With maps it's not something you can help. Huntress is slow and big maps are hard as her. Maps that make stealth easier are hard on her. You can get better at finding people and ending chases quickly but there's no way besides Map Offerings to not get bad maps. Sorry.
---
As for other tips my earlier comment still applies. Outside of those tips using Hatchets is something you have to practice and get a feel for by playing the game.
---
Don't be discouraged by messing up: just like any other skill you'll probably fail a lot starting out; it's just part of learning. 
---
And no matter how much you know, you can always learn something new.
---
I play on Xbox and always have a NAT type error when joining matches (like every other match) and I don’t have this problem with any other game, what can I do to help this?
---
Because they are not ready yet...
---
That indicates the obsession. You can read more about it on the wiki here:

---
Oh that sucks!
---
Could not agree more
---
Seems just like op realized they were wrong, and just doesn't want to admit it. So instead they just got into defensive mode.
---
It always amazes me that even little things like flipping a switch for a Blood Hunt is always "uh, guys, we can't do that. We never said anything"
---
Why the hell would you do that? Let the salt flow my friend.
---
Why is everyone being a dick about it. I had no idea it was a thing.
---
I dont think it would be OP, I just don’t see the sense in seeing pallets after each generator is done. Windows of Opportunity does that better on a as you go basis.
---
Megamind survivor when?
---
I hate playing against him, btw i know he isnt the best killer
---
Tons of situational perks can turn a death into an escape.  
---
If you haven't been hooked before, Deliverance can straight up save you at the end of the game if the killer doesn't camp you and decide to chase the other survivors out.  
---
If the killer tries to slug the last two, Flip Flop can help you escape his grasp if there's no hook nearby. You could potentially pair it with Boil Over? Those two are not great, but we're talking about non meta.  
---
Left Behind shows you the hatch. It can make a difference.  
---
Tenacity/Unbreakable if the killer decides to slug you.  
---
Then aura/detection perks can help as well if you need to be stealthy to escape...
---
We already have that, and its called Windows of opportunity
---
it does but I like salt from survivors and killers coming into my notifications
---
I was hoping to use my time off school to get some tiers done but it's not looking great so far
---
Darryl is that you?
---
Is it worth it though? Trapper and Claudette are both vanilla characters and there are multiple challenges in the Archives that require you to play Trapper specifically for example,not just have the perk (even though some challenges like that are there as well)
---
IMO it would just be better to level them up.
---
Then proceed to stab Frank in the shoulder with a glass shard.
---
And when you finally escorted outside, you throw a pebble in Lisa's face.
---
I agree levelling them is better. I hope for killers we get plague or pig MYC perk
---
Yeah   
---
Id fuck
---
Wait did they say they are going to release it or are we still hoping one day they get around to it?
---
Honestly I have no idea. I hope it becomes a thing but I doubt it.
---
Never is worth to use Iridescent on free perks...
---
Nice work
---
It's changed from when you had to aim for the neck.
---
People have to stop giving these greedy incompetents their money and lay down an ultimatum: Fix your broken shit or quit releasing things that cost money to buy. Simple as that.
---
Do not continue to shell out real-ass money for a game that runs like ass on every system it's on, still has no dedicated servers because they can't make them be anything other than a hyper-laggy mess, kept NOT having events -- even simple things like double BP events -- for almost the entire year (and the one we got didn't even last a damn week!), and still doesn't punish killers for camping/tunneling. 
---
Just stop. Stop giving these lying, greedy, predatory *assholes* your money!
---
The thought of it is giving me PTSD. It was like playing at rank reset but worse, you’d run the killer for ages and finally go down and there’d still be 5 gens bedding repair. Survivors would get all the nectar and then kill themselves on hook.
---
You're a meanie
---
\*muah\*
---
honestly I love playing them but I can see why mending every 2 minutes can get annoying
---
Anyone on ps4 actually doing this?
---
Guess micheal ate too many palletes
---
I change up how I play a bit, more memey, different perks. Do dumb shit and laugh. Idk just playing and doing the exact same thing every match can make the game stale, so change up a bit to make the game fun still.
---
If the survs go along with it so be it but some don't care about the points and want to actually play against the killer.
---
This. This is how I feel. Being broken all game is so shit and there's no problem if you've learnt how to dodge of normal vomit if you're at a loop
---
It was leaked by the image in the PTB, but its highly unlikely that they would do double bloodpoints now since they delayed the update :(
---
They may carry their team but most Aces I run into are toxic fuckers
---
Due to unforseen circumstances respect the game devs
---
"Huh, I don't get why people say Adept Laurie is one of the two difficult ones."
---
Depends on the rank you're at but it can happen at every rank, you pop a couple gens because they're not doing enough pressure or didn't bring any gen regression perks, so they DC until they find weak players
---
What some replies seem to have ignored is that crouching survivors don't set off traps, no matter how good their placement. On the plus side, if they're crouching everywhere then you should be able to catch them "conventionally" despite the Hag's slow speed - you just need to create a situation where they *have* to get close to you.
---
I suggest that at the high tiers you want to find a nice 3-gen that you can put a perimeter around - this way when you chase a survivor there's more chance of them breaking into a run and activating one of your traps.
---
I really don't recommend trapping *just* by landmark, because they're not important. Gens should be your focus, and specifically gens that are close together.
---
Don't get drawn too far away from your 3-gen setup - walking back will take too long. If you have Agitation then you can be a littly more cocky with your chases, since anyone you down can quickly be pulled into the centre of your 3-gen, putting you in a strong position since it'll be very difficult for survivors to crouch into the centre of your web, unhook, and crouch back out.
---
I would second the suggestion for running Monitor &amp; Abuse. Hag is slow, and this perk means she can get a lot closer before the chase starts. This is useful if the survivors run, and *devastating* if they choose to crouch.
---
There's probably a build out there that ignores all of the above and uses Play with your Food, Save the Best for Last, Corrupt Intervention, and some other perk (Discordance?), with fast setting and phantasm duration add-ons to help her with pallets. That would need to be played *very* aggressively, and you'd have to be very confident of repeatedly finding the Obsession so you could top up Play with your Food between teleport hits.
---
Damn the game was full of rank 18-20, just a shame because it was so early in the game
---
Events being tied directly to the rift might not be such a good idea... I'd rather have the Halloween event today and the rift in a week or two. Spread out the content
---
people dont worry the double bp are another bhvr scam
---
because the f this up with the event
---
they will do a double bp event just to make it even
---
Not one I'm familiar with, you're probably better off contacting their official support - far more likely that it's something they've heard of.
---
Nice
---
Let's be real, survivors are way more toxic than killers
---
look at fortnite lul xD
---
Thanks for you opinion ! :)
---
:D !
---
It depends on the situation. But not every killer is as kind.
---
Oh boy, at those ranks killer DC's are so common, survivor DC's too but if a survivor DC's you still can play the match. At higher ranks the amount of DC's decreases drastically, and usually killers do it because one or more survivors were super toxic.
---
HEY DARRYL, HOW'S IT HANGING?
---
Then play the game, dummy
---
Here’s hoping I can get there, the grind is long for me at rank 16 lol
---
Glows = Goes
---
Laughs in spirit waiting the minute timer before opening the locker
---
Survivors can get away with alot more than killer. As a killer every second is important. As a surviors, as long as you're skilled in chases you should be fine
---
I remember a survivor with that name tried it went nurse and after downing him in a corner he and another left the game
---
Most of it is sexual. Like I went on there after seeing a meme mentioning it and everything I saw was sexual
---
A lot was of the clown, for some reason too... humanity is a mistake
---
This is why I binded skillchecks to one of my extra mouse keys, never have to worry scratching nose, drinking or eating candy when a skillcheck appears.
---
Yh buy item
---
Just buy that brown item instead?
---
If you like games like Borderlands 3, are a fan of Dark Souls, and have $40, I highly recommend Remnant: From the Ashes.
---
The core mechanics are amazing, and it's one of those games thats short but designed to be replayable. You can beat it in a day or two and then just play it until The Outer Worlds comes out.
---
Laughs in iron maiden
---

---
Will that chase the entity to consume the other perk too? I thought it only ate one?
---
I'd assume so since theres only two items left(from what I can see) and so it'll have to take the one you don't I guess
---
Accurate
---
Good killer but should stick to his own game
---
Right, but it already consumed the green ‘Unrelenting.’
---
Because you can see the location of nearby survivovrs when you hit someone and your timer refreshes. Meaning, you can put multiple people into deep wound status and waste more of their time mending and healing.
---
I guess I’ll just hope for the best once I get more BP
---

Ill check it out, thanks!

Yeah itll consume Discordance
---
Some people reported that there were game breaking bugs in the ptb. They need to fix the bugs before they can release the event and the archives.
---
#ban u/pintmasterpaul
---
This criticism makes no sense.  The reason his Frenzy doesn't end after a hit is because his gimmick is if others are nearby you'll see that and have an opportunity to potentially put multiple survivors in injured state with Frenzy in a short window of time.  It's one of the few strengths he has.  Spread out damage to create pressure, cancel ability and down the one you think you can most efficiently down.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Bet your a killer main lol
---
No freddy rip

Happy cake day

Jake is best boi.
---
I get a bad feeling we're going to see a repeat of the curtain call shitshow.
---
Thank you OP I’m laughing my ass off first thing in the morning, poor mans gold 🏅
---
Doctor is an anti-stealth killer. A couple basic things to know though:
---
- You can use exhaustion perks, vault windows/pallets, throw pallets down, and unhook in Tier 3. You cannot heal, repair a gen, or use items in Tier 3.
---
- Doctor can see the illusions of himself. Those can rat out your general area!
---
- Sometimes it’s better to throw a pallet early against Doctor than not at all. If you have to throw early, try to stay on the loop until he breaks it.
---
- Lockers help, believe it or not. If you hop into a locker, you temporarily stop the effects of his static field. Illusions can still pop up, but sometimes hopping in a locker for a few seconds can actually save you.
---
- Calm Spirit (one of Jake’s teachables) makes it so you don’t upset the crows *or* scream. Please note that since you don’t scream, when you get hooked, you got into Struggle phase faster, so it does have some drawbacks.
---
Honestly imo the big thing with Doctor is learning how to loop. He can definitely throw a wrench into your ability to loop, but if you haven’t, OhTofu has some really good tutorials on his channel. Iirc he has one that talks about looping in common tiles that isn’t too terribly old.
---
I'm against this for the simple fact I'd never be able to hurt them, they're both precious and it's one of my favorite movies ever.
---
In the official forums someone posted "I am so hyped for the archives" and I replied "me too. pls BHVR, don't mess it up again".
---
Am I a fortune teller or some shit like that? No, I'm just used to BHVR. I'm in this community for 1+ year, I already understood they can't keep promises neither meet deadlines.
---
Thank you, I appreciate it.
---
I like him a lot, the portals help apply nap pressure and the dash, while not super effective in every chase, makes pallet stunning much more difficult. Almost like having a fully charged Spirit fury at all times, but I still think it’s faster. The dash works best when it’s harder to dodge (either short range or in enclosed spaces), or as a decent way to catch up to especially nimble survivors that occasionally nets you 800 points.
---
As for his perks, not much luck with mindbreaker but surge is really nice when it works and cruel limits seems good, I feel like if I had tinkerer or discordance teachable it would be even better so I could get to a gen as its finishing and maybe only have a single pallet to cronch.
---
And just look at that face. He’s so cute, such a good boy. Who could say no to those teeth?
---
I never get survivor challenges. Always Doctor.
---
I wonder what would happen if you tried to teabag him...
---
Just wanted to say that i actually like true3. i just made a meme. No hate
---
Uff...I was so excited about the event today. I feel so disappointed right now.
---
console
---
Will it start?
---
Nice Edit
---
Remember that one time they promised some fix for the Xbox people and it still isn't a thing after like 1 year? That's BHVR summed up.
---
everytime I load into a Survivor match and see it's a Legion, I can't help but say "Crap, one of those troubled youths you hear so much about."
---
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
---
but she packed my bloodweb and sent me on my way
---
Wow, that's great. Let us know when u get one next time as well
---
Lol glad to see I wasn't the only one who thought the power outage might have been BS. Seems a bit like a conspiracy theory but wouldn't be the first time we've been lied to.
---
Thanks for the advice, i never knew doctor could his illusions, I'll check out Ohtofu's tutorial afterwards, cheers
---
Maybe
---
Any suggestions?
---
Bruh who you b
---
So does that mean its running for longer or we are getting a shorter halloween event?
---
Doing gens ,you?
---
This post is dumb
---
Idk I've gotten some pretty hardcore death threats from Ace players before.
---
I know I just wanna know how much time I have in seconds
---
Mind if I use that comeback
---
The killer didn't have Ruin or something else to slow down the game and when the noed triggered we assumed it was an endgame strategy. 
---
Also it was his last hook but I realized that almost too late
---
? Are we only allowed to praise game devs? I like the game but I'll still point out that the way the team handles events and communication is atrocious. This has happened one too many times for my liking and I don't feel like continuing to spend money on the game, I'll stick with the characters and skins I have. Why does this bother you?
---
Swf's tend to stick together like flies on shit.  They're often pretty brazen about it.  I've had Legion games where I've tagged 3 survivors in the first 40 seconds of the game already with his Frenzy and that behavior from them. Regardless it gives you information if anyone else is nearby which is never a bad thing and the continued faster frenzy speed allows you to follow them and cancel it when you get them to an area that you like for attempting to wrap up the chase.
---
Except this community is heavily killer main sided, so posts talking shit about survivors get 1000+ upvotes, so it's nice to see it evened out sometimes, so this post is stupid.
---
Also, don’t kill them too fast. Maybe get a few downs who you let get picked up so you can get extra in each category. 
---
With some killers Devout is harder than others so make sure you focus it if you play one of those(Plague is a good example).
---
Any extra bp perks, even if they give you a slight disadvantage at first are worth it at this rank. They won’t be able to play around it anyways so it’s great to use.
---
Use either an aura reading perk or whispers.
---
You almost spoke coherent english.
---
The 1% left of Ace mains are like 10 pink-haired Nea combined
---
Lmao never dced from a game :) 
---
But I'm a blendette main.
---
Whats a killer?
---
My mind just subconsciously replaces it with hair now. Even looking at it I’m like yeah it’s hair
---
I think I have too much of a soft spot for certain weaker killers. I'll admit, the more I play the Legion, the more I enjoy them. Particularly after a perfect 8k game on the meat factory last night. 
---
Something about sprinting round a factory, vaulting windows and shanking everyone you see is hella fun.
---
Took a clip last night from the same game where I got 4 injuries on 4 survivors and a hook in just over a minute. That shits oppressive.

---
I'm sorry I'm not dumb like you who probably speak 1 language. I explained why I made the mistake and you just said it was cringe. Which lead me to think you have a fridge temp IQ
---
Why is so hard ranking as a killer? Maybe is because I'm learning nurse, but no matter what I'm stuck even if I play the best way I can
---
Thank you. Seriously. Thank you for understanding of my comment. Some people have 0 brain cells to not understand what I am saying and try to talk shit to me for no reason at all. Also for someone who claims the be the best LF I don't understand why would he talk shit to me instead of helping a new player who is clearly struggling. As long as these people exist toxicity will never end on this game.
---
Also about the killer tier list it can be personal, and IMO LF is the worst but I respect your opinion (not his though lol).
---
Imagine throwing a tantrum over people whining. Just because you don't care doesn't mean other people aren't bothered. We're allowed to express frustration when the devs do something wrong, just like we praise then when they do something right. 
---
I don't know if you're just trying to be edgy but I don't get how you can be this offended over people's collective disappointment.
---
That's the best comeback in human history, imma steal that and credit you everytime i use it
---
Do we have any lore that says what the difference is between the Hallowed and Withered blight? Before they said the first blight was a sign tThe entity was getting stronger/advancing a story. So I’m wondering what that is.
---
No.. Toxic IMO is behavior that ruins someone’s experience outside of win/lose. The goal is to shit on them. Gen rush is just good gen optimization, like being good at loops. 
---
It just makes it harder on a killer. Being optimal with gen output is like being good at loops. It’s a strong move that makes you more likely to win. That in itself isn’t toxic. 
---
Tunneling is also optimal play **but** is toxic because the tunneled survivor doesn’t get to play the game, they spend all their time on hook/down. And as killer you have more control over everyone’s experience because you have the power to decide who goes down/is out of the game. All survivors can do is avoid that.
---
Drag queens are magic
---
I'd buy this dlc in a heartbeat. One of my favorite horror movies out there.
---
We could also have Chad as a killer and the last stand logging warehouse as a map
---
Looks awesome
---
Or they could release the patch early and full of bugs, then this sub could complain it’s heart out on why the devs should’ve just delayed it to fix it
---
This last blood hunt for me was full of killers tunneling and mori'ing. I did get farm games as well though, which was very irritating when I just wanted to play a semi-normal game.
---
HOW DO I UNSEE HOW DO I UNSEE
---
&gt;im rank 8 now and i just realized that this perk exists. every killer runs ruin and b&amp;c. its such a great game but 2 perks completly ruin the game.
---
BBQ ruins the game? wat
---
BBQ was made to give killers a reason to leave the hook area, in an attempt to reduce camping. Reason why it shows auras far away instead of every aura or close proximity auras. Being found and being caught are moments very apart from each other (unless you aren't very good at looping). 
---
Answering your question, lockers completely hide your aura but I suggest you don't always do this since some times allowing the killer to see your aura will create an opportunity for another teammate to save the hooked person.
---
If you play the intended way ... ye ... but if you just use his ability without stalk you become a better wraith that has no sound warning.
---
Perfection
---
Lol I don't understand all the survivor hate for Game man.  I enjoy going there as survivor.  The entire bottom floor is so incredibly safe with pallets galore.  Upstairs has some strong spots too.  You can waste obscene amounts of time in the office.  And the metal steps dropdown can be looped back up the stairs and back again pretty viciously.  A lot of killers just abandon chase when they see you pulling that shit.  If you have Balanced Landing on holy shit does that map become cheesy af.  Not quite on Haddonfield level but not that far off either.  Only real knock is finding totems and sometimes gens.
---
The emblems get harder to score as you climb higher.
---
Also, this is a game we paid for. It’s not some free download with microtransactions supporting the devs. This is a fuck up, no doubt.
---
Downvoted for speaking the truth.
---
Killers can:
---
Camp hook
---
Tunnel kills
---
Ebony mori
---
run OP addons (iri huntress, pb spirit, etc)
---
Slow the game to a crawl (combo thanat, dying light, ruin, etc)
---
End the game prematurely (disconnect)
---
and any single one of these things, on their own, ruins the game for everyone involved.
---
Whereas survivors can
---
Bring strong addons?
---
Disconnect/die?
---
Do the objective?
---
Teabag?
---
All of which vary from "a minor inconvenience" to "literally helpful to the killer"
---
It’s so frustrating
---
I take The Game over Lery's, Swamps or Yamaoka any day. 
---
Meat Plant has some really good pallets plus the 4 extremely broken ones by the planning room and below it.
---
The more survivors the bigger chance for someone to stay at your pov.
---
People never think to use diversion but holy shit it helps so much with bbq
---
These posts about BBQ being OP always crack me up because it's obvious they never know about hard countering it with locker slow vaults.  That patch update was an insanely strong nerf to the perk.  I barely run it on any of my killers unless I'm just looking to farm BP's since any survivor can hard counter it at will.  We have to literally choose to allow them their reads at this point.
---
I can’t risk getting exposed like this. You saw nothing.

Happy (almost) Halloween, fog travelers! I hope you like my Nurse costume. Here are a few more photos. If you’re curious about how I made it:
---
* Dress: Was purchased at an earlier date. I sewed on the long sleeves, the lace, and the bandages on the chest. Then I ripped up the hem. I used fake blood and makeup to dirty it up. 
---
* Pillow Case: I purchased one at a craft store. I cut the bottom to make it shorter and then used fake blood and makeup on it. There are very small eyeholes so I don’t run into walls. 
---
* Belt: From my closet.
---
* Saw: I bought a hacksaw at Home Depot. Then I used craft paint and cinnamon to add the rust. Unfortunately it doesn’t photograph well in low light/dark backgrounds due to the color, so here’s what it looks like in regular light. I added some fake blood as well.
---
* Blindfold: Cheesecloth painted with makeup and fake blood. 
---
The blinks in my hand are not photoshopped in; I taped an LED tea light to my palm.
---
Haven’t figured out how to hover yet, will report back when I figure it out.
---
Go0gl3 wh3re can 1 g3t a lobotomy
---
if someone goes down and you see them getting picked up if you have been around that map u can get a general idea where the kill will go so hide behind a gen aura or in a locker or run in 1 direction for 4 seconds and then walk the other way back. BBQ gives good info but it is not OP you wouldn't call legions killer instinct OP

Whelp. That’s just unlucky. Especially with Halloween coming so close, hopefully they can put this all together by tomorrow or Thursday so we can have an event that at least passes through Halloween. Like I can be okay with the Rift and Archives being delayed, I get that’s a massive project but the Halloween stuff was supposed to be the more important part, I thought. Having each one be a piece of each other definitely felt off.

Wholly disagree, removing base mechanics for one side is incredibly unbalanced.
---
I used to bring a brown toolbox with both of those
---
I didn't use them. I held them to give them to the first person who fails a skill-check next to me
---
Still no F I N G E R G U N S
---
This is why event and patch are linked.  Whyyyyyyyyy.
---
It's still on them for delaying it,they are not a small indie company,and this year was full of disappointments already!
---
From rank 16-20 getting a black pip is at the very bottom of the bar and getting a pip is barely above that.  Like, as long as you don’t DC, you Should be getting pips for just existing. What are you doing in your games?

In CS:GO we get a competitive cooldown but...

Crossover between my 2 main games. Dies happily.

Even triple A companies have to deal with difficult bugs every now and then. It’ll be out sooner or later
---
Says someone who call everyone "cringe" since they created the account and use F slur word like it's nothing
---
Be careful, an edge Lord like you should be careful to not cut yourself, which is very likely. Saying "cringe" when you can't discuss but just insult is very telling
---
Please don't be older than 12
---
Nah they have discordance and Iron Maiden. Totally worth leveling them for those. Mad grit isn’t horrible either but it’s more niche.
---
Better. I got anniversary cakes ready
---
I fucking hate playing against Legion purely because he's so fucking annoying. Every time I play against one they always bear in directly on me and completely take me out of the game because I'm always running or healing. I can usually win just by waiting for my team to do gens but it's not fun at all
---
Just don't use any hexes that draw attention like Ruin, most survivors only really look for totems if you bring something like Ruin or HL, but there are those moments when survivors either stumble onto or spawn within sight of it, that's where other hexes come in handy, like TotH and HG.
---
Discordance doesn't have a cool down, the level just affects how long the generator is highlighted. Besides there is only 4 survivors, so there'll only be two generators highlighted at one time.
---
Still mad at them for fucking this up
---
A huntress hatchet maybe? Or a mini locker would be cool
---
Maybe but at least this update won’t be game breaking
---
Someones got anger issues
---
When was the last event?  Been waiting for soooo long for something exciting to happen :\
---
How long do we have to wait now then?
---
The easiest counter to BBQ is sitting behind an unfinished gen.
---
Against good killers that might mean stop working on the gen and position yourself directly behind it, or the killer might see some part of you, like an elbow.
---
But more often than not you can just keep working on the correct side of the gen.
---
dude i love you thanks! i get that they want to make killers not to camp but that was truly a dumb way to do so. it ruins the fun from the game imo.  
---
it may not break the game but it ruins aka. takes the fun away for me and my friends.
---
Well maybe if people like you weren't so cringy all the time I wouldn't have to call them that :)
---
If you look it up, it’s common knowledge that Discord 1 is better than all other levels. Even the big streamers like Otz and True try to tell people to keep discord at level 1
---
Christmas event dated 26.07.20 is postponed,till christmas!
---
The enti-, i mean Nea only tops FYI
---
Kinda smells like updog in here.
---
Is it made out of break or s a l t
---
Your correct on that and anytime there is a major bug like with the legion infinite mend add ons, that took them weeks to patch when all they had to do was disable those add ons until they could patch it! 
---
But no we all had to suffer, look at epic games they just had a major game breaking bug with the slurp swamps and people able to hide in them and get a free win, they disabled the healing ability in the swamps until they could patch it! Problem solved, but with BhVR you never get that and the only thing I’ve seen them patch super quick was the wake up bug, 5 days and it was patched, but if it’s killer sided or anything else major it goes unnoticed. 
---
They need to slow down on the content drops and really focus on fixing their game, this game is on a sinking ship right now...
---
Due to plenty foreseen circumstances, fuck the devs this isn't the first time they've been incompetent nor is it the worst.
---
That doesn’t sound very fun tbh but however you have fun playing haha
---
Yo I was in this game. They called you a lag switcher. Idk what happened but I didn't get any lag. I just saw them zoom.
---
Holy cow, that is pretty much perfect! Grats!
---
well yes and no. if you can easily move around to get to a hook and they are basically slowing you down then its not. if you only have 1 entrance (such as the underground facility or the game) then i consider it. thats why they fixed body blocking of hooks in the first place... even if you have 3 survs hugging a hook you can still hook where you used to not be able to. slowing down is one thing but completely blocking you off is fucked. no different than a killer blocking you in a corner and just not doing anything but leaving you there stuck. honestly in rephrasing its no more or less toxic than the camping i did as punishment so eye for an eye
---
I run it when im playing with friends just so we know if someone has bbq or nurses. Very useful just to know if they have aura perks or not so you can play around it
---
 Chill mate, they’re releasing a big update with a bunch of new challenges and battle pass stuff that has to work perfectly unless they want people to complain anyways. So far it’s only been delayed one day, let’s not get our pitchforks out yet
---
I’ve tried to make it a point to send messages when i enjoy playing with people. I don’t do it as much as I should though! Also I don’t know if you’re thinking that I was the rage message guy but i am the blue text bubbles.
---
:(
---
Im sorry but not every game dev team is perfect and its not their fault if the players keep demanding things they arent in the position to deliver. I get hit oxes being broken.but thats a server error to be fixed by programmers. The devs get enough shit so stop being entitled, its not like they cancelled it. Its being pushed back by a few days. Id rather a good event thats not broken than an event thats broken and shit
---
That guy does that on every post, what a waste of time
---
I must have been walking *really* slowly then
---
Thought this was a drawing or something at first. Looks amazing!
---
Implying a woman would ever want to be with someone who plays DBD

You can also counter it by running in one direction for a 4 count then change direction

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dlh1kc/toxic_survivors_be_like/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Don’t mind him, he is just the collector of posts to show to another post. Basically, don’t mind what the others say. It’s a known bug by the community, and it will be here for a while longer. (Maybe that was why the patched was delayed? Idk) I think in terms of bans it’s along the lines of custom icons, so just don’t do it again, hold off on splinters until the patch.
---
I have been looking at all the comments and added a different idea to the list. Feel free to check it out
---
1: Adrenaline makes you sprint at 50% speed for 5 seconds, getting hit makes you sprint at 50% speed for 2 seconds, so that's 7 seconds of 6 m/s, or an extra 14 meters of distance over 7 seconds for 42 meters total.
---
2: Killers only move 32.2 meters in 7 seconds (115% speed) and only move 0.6 m/s (at best) faster than survivors, meaning they can't catch a survivor in the end-game due to the blade-wiping animation before the gates open (20 seconds) without NOED, they literally don't move fast enough.
---
3: Adrenaline only takes 2 minutes, 36 seconds to proc since match start through Ruin without toolboxes, which is hard for most Killers to counter given the length of your standard generator patrol and the strength of loops.
---
Survivors try to blind you and you pull out an Uno™ reverse card
---
That will never happen knowing BhVR, we can’t get a simple event launched or even confirmed like a blood hunt and when on camera they all beat around the bush and don’t know what to say.
---
How dare I want a functional game I'm so entitled lol
---
go fuck yourself too buddy
---
Let them BHVR has said themselves if people take it too far to personal harassment outside the game they will get banned but ofc you would have to bring proof to some admins about this bc they take that seriously
---
- Wear black stockings.  
---
- Make some fake legs using shaped foam, dressed in wardrobe with slippers and attach them to the front of your legs.  
---
- Take photo in front of black backdrop.
---
~~can we pan a bit downward please~~
---
I love this though, really cute art!
---
Sorry thats why its postponed.
---
Me neither, it looked like the meg was lagging, as is evidenced by that rollbacked window vault. I think that somehow activated sprint burst after she got knocked.
---
In my opinion, Prayer Beads is the cherry on the cake. All her add-ons are bad because she suffers from the same disease Nurse had: she is a great killer without add-ons and becomes op when she uses them.
---
Spirit only has 5 seconds of mind-game in a chase, with the duration add-ons she has more time and can finish what she wants to do in a better way. This is why she cannot vault while phasing: maybe Devs wanted to vault the way to counterplay her but her add-ons make it impossible.
---
Also, why many killers like Wraith and Billy have a downside like "you are faster while cloacked but you are slower while uncloacking" or "faster mov. speed while using chainsaw but more charge time", and she doesn't? That doesn't make sense and it's unbalanced.
---
Thanks so much!!
---
&gt;my six year old niece wouldn't male
---
Yep.. he wouldn't.. I guess you need some English lesson for your own language from your niece
---
&gt;try to justify it with your "amazing four language" skills you're just a clown.
---
It's a simple explanation. Sometimes I fk up and happens, I guess for someone who only speak 1 language and it's the easiest in the world too, it's very hard to understand how it works..
---
&gt;A very immature clown and the way you've totally gone ape shit just shows that you can't deal with criticism.
---
I don't like people who act so big and mighty pointing out a mistake, that has been explained, and double down with "cringe" when the person explained why they did that mistake.
---
&gt; A very immature clown and the way you've totally gone ape shit just shows that you can't deal with criticism. I did call that comment cringy (and it really was) but I didn't insult you or anything. Now tale a look at the lengths you have gone here to insult me.
---
Yeah, because people like you are laughable. Making criticisms without any basis and feel offended when people reply with the tone you deserve
---
Listen snowflake, if you can't handle to be called out on your sht when you act like a douchebag, you should go. Just leave, nobody cares to listen to an homophobic dude who just say "cringe" when they have no argument and is a fucking edge lord
---
&gt;I really hope you don't treat people like this IRL. For the sake of them. You sound exhausting to deal with
---
I could say the same.. I think you don't tho, otherwise someone would've already sent you to the hospital, several times
---
No its Frank the killer RUN!!!!!
---
That's the perfect analogy
---
That’s such a compliment, thank you!!
---
It’s not much but it’s honest work
---
Bloodpoints are the Entity's cryptocurrency. You have to keep your account under a million to keep the Entity's Tax Man off your back.
---
Yeah I'm sure this patch is gonna fix the game and not be just another pile of microtransactions.
---
You clearly have no idea how software development works. No matter how big the company, a bug can always slip through.
---
The 19 badge is your player account level, and raises based on xp you earn for playing in survivor and killer matches, the other is Jane's individual level (each character has one) which is raised using bloodpoints in the bloodweb - hope this helps! :)  
---
P.S - When you reach level 100 with the badge that is currently 19, it will reset to 1 and you'll gain a 'devotion' level (basically to help progression). When you reach level 50 with Jane (or any other character) you can choose to prestige, which resets her individual level and gains you a bloody version of her clothing - you don't have to prestige, that's personal preference.
---
This^^^
---
Not saying you should, but with ghostface as one of the packages, I think you can buy 3. 
---
And I would advice taking people you can’t buy with shards like Meyers, pig, ghostface, freddy, leatherface.
---
Is developer incompetence really “unexpected” from this team any more?
---
21 is that character's bloodweb level, 19 is your overall level for your account. Leveling up gives you iridescent shards.
---
Christmas? But that was just an extra points event...so halloween probably lol
---
Did you read their message? The entire point is they would like to wait for an event that works.
---
I known I can buy 3, so I know it will be ghostface and Fred, but should I then go for the pig or clown/plague?
---
Just a casual look for going to the grocery store
---
"Delay the patch or the game shits the bed on a colossal level" is a false dichotomy, because there's a third option, "get a development team that isn't a dumpster fire"
---
I meant that not all survivors HAVE items to drop. No one should be obligated to carry one just to counter one killer, and they're not. There are many more ways to signalize you're not the killer or to recognize the killer. It'll just require a little bit of thinking. 
---
I'm not talking about the Thing idea. Doesn't need to be the Thing. Just a shapeshifter will do. Making everyone look the same it's not stupid, it's just mislead. The one who wrote the Thing thought that, for the shapeshifter to work, it will need people not to look unique, which is inherently false.
---
Coming back to what you said about DCs, people who DC are very entitled people that think the game should be fun only for them. They don't want to try out going against killers they don't know how to fight against. They also get nothing in return for DCing, so it will be a problem, but one that all killers share. That's not a problem that comes with a shapeshifting killer, that's a problem with the game itself. It is too easy to DC and not that punishing. People should be punished more for DCing than just not getting points or losing items. But I'm not gonna touch that right now.
---
Facing a shapeshifter doesn't discourage working together, it REQUIRES people to work together. People who work alone will get severely punished for doing so because they'll never know which one is the killer or where he is and people will avoid helping them because they know that they won't help at all.
---
There are many things you could do to fool survivors. Gens aren't the only thing in the game. What about sabotaging hooks? Opening chests? Going in lockers? Opening the exit gates? Cleansing totems? Depending on what the killer has is his hands, he will have many ways to fool survivors. Just don't give them the ability to do these things in a perfect way, so that people with at least fifty brain cells don't get fooled.
---
Have you ever played LoL? Or any other competitive game. dbd isn’t nearly as bad
---
K troll
---
They actually say this
---
I don't even care about any of that. Just give me Archives.
---
This is great aahahah
---
I couldn't care less about the event, this is just a heads up for anyone who didn't already know they apparently have no plans on fixing the game nor can they even do their shitty microtransaction plan right.
---
I get that bugs are inevitable,im just disappointed.First the servers,then this
---
you're asking too much of bhvr lol
---
Nah. Bhvr too greedy.
---
I love his perks except Remember Me. Unless I tunnel the Obsession, it’s like two seconds until the gates are powered.
---
Is this a real thing or am I getting my leg pulled?
---
Plague is really underrated try her out
---
Definitely report them if outside of Playstations rules.  I always do now.
---
I’d go with pig as both clown and plague can be bought with shards.
---
Do you even know what developer you're talking about?
---
End game collapse is the only real important change. Treat the others like new killers.
---
Pretty sure what they add only fucks with the code more even if it is just a reskin of an old event they have to add that to new maps that will fuck with the code. **I agree the code is a hot mess and the devs should fix it** but the problem is most people don't care since it's not their job, they just want new content. 
---
to fix the code would take a long time without new content updates and the community would complain about that. Coding ain't easy and people don't understand that you add one line of code you break another and so on.
---
That happened to me awhile ago, the others were working on generators and no one saved me. They all let me die and then they all died and the last guy disconnected when he got hit once.
---
Hello fellow fog traveler. I, too, am against this and always try to stay positive and be nice to others when they just act like normal human beings and not like dicks
---
We'll be lucky if they shit on our plates and call it steak. Don't hold your breath.
---
It's information uptime, basically. If two people touch a generator and stop, you'll still think they're on that generator for 12 seconds at higher ranks before it checks to see if they're still on it again, if you have it at rank 1, it'll check to see if 2 survivors are on it every 8 seconds instead
---
You get Surveillance anyway, which is good. And Pig is fun. 
---
I personally only get Shrine perks for Killers that I know I won´t really enjoy playing, and from Killers that have 1 good perk when the rest of it is trash. No point levelling someone to 40 for just one good perk. For two? Much more worth it.
---
Now I’m hungry.
---
Yes it does, you even get a bonus 300 points to level it up for your First Killer game of the day.
---
I had gotten surveillance from a previous shrine. I purely upgraded Pig for MYC.
---
Don’t even bother replying, when someone is mad or toxic they almost never listen to reason and just keep swinging if you have to say anything just say gg and move on
---
I dont play killer so i didnt know lmao
---
+1 for Ren and Stimpy meme
---
Not gonna lie the original meme is kinda disturbing
---
The first one is gonna make people uninstall the game I guarantee it, but I like the other 3.
---
instead we will get new cosmetics in the store :D
---
Ty! ^^
---
legion carrying a switchblade while on cocaine
---
The point of the prayer beads is to surprise them and get grabs
---
But what we'll get is both late and broken. You expect too much from them
---
head on just because it's so much fun to use and infectious fright because I just love that perk
---
With nails that long they could just cosplay as Freddy
---
You think the delay means there won't be bugs? Bless your heart.
---
\*lose
---
Uhh gen rush. Maybe you’re confusing me for someone else but yeah. I’m just saying gen rushing is indeed a thing and it’s what happens when there’s no pressure.
---
I would agree with this but i realised that in a chase the killer only has to outplay the survivor once (twice if healthy) but a survivor has to outplay the killer multiple times to get out of the chase
---
Oh I didnt know it worked like that.
---
Man we need something like that
---
The people making cosmetics can't work on this stuff, no, but BHVR *does* control where they allocate their resources. You can spend more money hiring people to work on modeling/cosmetics/etc. and less on quality control.
---
This whole ThE aRt TeAm CaN't FiX bUgS mantra is so old
---
NOED trumps them all
---
Its funny, i do like killer more than survivor, but i made this meme from a survivor perspective.
---
I dont think its a bug. It just increases your chance of being the obsession, not that you would be the obsession. Same with the maps, youre more likely to get that map, but Ive seen a few times where someone has brought a map offering and we didnt get that map. Plenty of times Im the obsession with no obsession perks but the nea is running DS and I just got the obsession.
---
What do you mean by fixing the game? The whole dedicated servers and spirit being played every game or something else? Also I disagree with how you view the seasonal pass thingy. Just the fact that you can get your money back is enough for me to support it, but to each their own.
---
Iridencent head downs people instantly and omega blink nurse really isnt a thing anymore. You forget that prayer beads just removes the phasing sound wich literally isnt that bad from my side and survivors side (I play survivor too) and ik spirit gets 4ks anyway but the point if it is to scare and challenge survivors. They arent even challenged and genrush constantly so I say its fair
---
I've never seen the map offering fail unless there were 2 at the same time.
---
Its just you manage to finally outplay them and then they just dead hard like bruh does a killer get so many chances to fuck up? One mistake could cost you the entire game and when a survivor messes up its nothing
---
It's pretty bad that we are used to this type of shit.
---
That is probably the reason of the delay. 
---
„We found a bug with the Michael Myers cosmetic. Delay the whole damn patch!“
---
Genrushing and insta heals seem fun you survivors and not the killer
---
Meh the Jane and Kate one got me
---
No. 
---
I won’t let you.
---
Pretty.
---
Good.
---
Slob.
---
So.
---
Far.
---
That’d be cool, but I highly doubt they’ll give us anything
---
wtf is this post?
---
I‘m pretty sure more killers got a buff than a nerf
---
Noed, blood warden, remember me, enduring-spirit fury, fire up, rancor, lightborn, a bunch of add ons, moris(kinda) and maybe more.
---
BHVR has done far worse in the past and given the community shit for it
---
In addition to what MrPwney said, at least on PS4, rotating your analog stick at a consistent medium speed also works and most people find it easier on the controller (and quieter. clickclickclickclickclick)
---
Noed, blood warden, rancor
---
Am I missing anything?
---
BBQ
---
I mean in a chase
---
Survivors are entitled man children. Simple as that. And the way the game is designed means there's more of them then killers so therefore, posts criticizing survivors (specifically their behavior in-game) is instantly down voted and hidden. And it doesn't help that people with this mindset that killers have to play by survivor rules and using certain killers/perks makes you "toxic" are mods on social media.
---
They really were/are a "just for noobs" add-on, but is that really so bad to have in a game that apparently even the dev's see as a "casual" and not competitive/pro game?
---

---
If you really can't handle it Calm Spirit will make you significantly harder to track depending on what addons the Doc is running. (And this is coming from a Doctor main. Calm Spirit users are a pain) The biggest advantage you'll get is your character no longer screams when madness tiers up or randomly in madness 3 so no notification is given. The Doctor still gets a "MADNESS TIER UP" BP event the first few tier ups but these don't really tell him much besides someone is nearby. 
---
Be advised in Madness 3 the doctor illusions are visible as yellow auras to the doctor meaning he has some limited tracking even through calm spirit if you're in tier 3. I don't know if this still works since the illusions have been sort of bugged for a while, but running into the illusion used to make it disappear giving the Doctor less time to notice it.
---
If he's running the Restraint addons, Calm Spirit is less useful but still somewhat good. The issue with Restraint Doctor is even though you don't scream, your aura is revealed for a few seconds when you tier up. The doctor illusions also show their aura even in madness 2. 
---
It's up to you if you want to bank a perk slot on an Anti-Doctor perk, but the option is available. On the plus side it also makes infectious fright no longer work on you.
---
She kinda does
---
You don’t have to do the rift you loser
---
Oh, well, enduring- spirit fury, lightborn. A couple more, but they are sketchy.
---
When is the event coming out now?
---
This is the realist thing ive read on reddit. Props to you its so true and unfortunate
---
&gt; *Haven’t figured out how to hover yet, will report back when I figure it out.*
---
Can you get a good price on baked beans in bulk?
---
Don't worry guys, they said they are going to buff them :D
---
If they do 1 down a million to go but baby steps :P
---
You can just ignore them 4head
---
True thank you for your advice last few games been doing just that and actually enjoying the game
---
You can say those perks are cheap sure, but aside from Noed those other perks don't really act like a second chance
---
.
---
People still fall for spies until today. Spies shine when the game is too chaotic for you to pay attention to one of your team mates who's not helping at the attack. A disguise killer would shine when people are alone and want some help at a gen or any other objective. They could also fool people by fake fixing gens or fake sabotaging hooks and totems, so people would come close to help and then get turned on by the killer in disguise
---
Oh man sweet thanks for the info ill definately join there discord
---
Theoretically Unrelenting, Save the best for last, Spirit Fury, Enduring, Brutal Strength, Moris, Rancor. List goes on
---
What an original idea
---
I’m not saying their cheap, just making a list of second chance perks, good or not
---
Current DS is more like "only chance" perk since a lot of killers love to tunnel despite having clear sight of the rescuer, even if they are injured. Borrowed Time is pretty much the same logic. 
---
Adrenaline only triggers near / at the end game. 
---
Instaheals nerf is already coming.
---
&gt;IT
---
Intra-Terrestrial?
---
Unrelenting is a base killer perk that reduces the recovery time for a missed M1 attack. That easily gives you the second chance you need to swing again quickly.
---
Aaaw, that's cute!
---
This is the first rag that I've seen done right. 👏👏👏
---
The lack of free or shard reasonable shard outfits lends me no hope to anything worthwhile. Not saying everything under the moon should be free because I get they need to make money. But we are due for something special imo.
---
Archives were mid chapter it has noting to do with hallowed blight in update wise the 3.3.0 update never had a confirmed date but leaks by daylight is saying the 31st which is when the 3.3.0 would drop it seems
---
Depends on what abilitys the Thing would have. Shapeshifting like in the movie wouldn't help at all in chases and would make it very easy for the killer to be recognized, since he can only transform into people he has killed.
---
Clenching is what Tiggers do best.
---
They had months to make it work and didnt, at least we have dedicated servers.Oh wait nvm.
---
My all time favorite after match message. It’s always that idiot that that unhooks three seconds after I got them on the first and then expects me to just let them walk away
---
Currently printing an irredecent shard
---
Spirit is not a great killer without addons lol... 
---
She can't realistically patrol split gens and end chases at the same time without addons. She gets stomped by competent teams. Nurse and Freddy are great without addons, but we'll see if Nurse is still great without them after the nerf.
---
WAH
---
All hail the 4%!
---
this game is a weird mix in between
---
We have the (shitty) ranking system, a deep game with many complex mechanics, and a butload of bullshit one time shit sprinkled on top of it.
---
Can't be casual - too hard and requires you to sweat to have any enjoyment
---
Can't be competitive - too many free-win buttons
---
Currently printing an Irr shard
---
I regret clicking on the link

Get Distortion
---
Egc time is reduced by 50% whenever a survivor is downed or hooked (so if you down someone the instant the time starts, it will last 4 minutes instead of 2.) if you want bw to go off, you need to hook someone at the 25% mark, then just let them get the unhook to speed the timer up.
---
He literally could not. She started going speedy while his chainsaw was still in motion. The chainsaw was going 100 percent speed, like it should have, and not going faster. She started running before she went down, and then sprint burst went over to her downed state (?)
---
I'm a gf main and I run noed but I still stalk ppl because I'm not a dick and only use it for the haste boost
---
Personally I run stake out I’m horrible with great skill checks and I always get my 4 tokens so I’m not sure what to say man personally I think see a problem
---
You get points toward your Emblem for totems
---
Unhooks are points, don’t know why anyone would pass them up completely.
---
because it doubles your points. it cuts the grind in half. 
---
The only reason why WGLF isn't run is because stacks are hard to get. getting 4 hooks is a given.
---
Yes oink
---
Dedicated servers broke the game even more. The icing on the "sounds are broken every other patch" cake.
---
Don't feel bad, who tf camps and used noed on Billy? A dimp, a dimp will do that.
---
So I take it there’s a chance of this happening? If so very cool if not it’s your printer you do what you do man
---
Am I the only one who likes the swamp?
---
"Adrenaline is fine just kill them" thats not a real counter
---
Imagine picking the map, bring ds and a flashlight, playing against the wraith, and then still dcing.
---
Hopefully when they do the Halloween event, they will extend it a bit longer.
---
Guys I just realised I'm dumb. 3.3.0 is the mid-chapter patch.
---
However, now that I realised this, I understand. Please feel free to downvote but realise you don't have to comment to correct me.
---
Don't feel bad. It was a well deserved win if that was the case.
---
Its not every game its like 4 out of 5 and im really not I can show you a video of my inbox piled of messages
---
The only thing I do annoying is if exit gates are powered and I have 0ks and I hook someone near an exit gate ill patrol the gate and them
---
BUT what else am I meant to do leave them and the gate and go to the other itd be stupid
---
Thanksgiving
---
How many downvotes does it take before you stop being angry :')

Halloween event after Halloween = big brain

Although the chase was short gf could have stalked him and ended the chase faster

That's what should come with the Midchapter Update:

If you're interested you can visit the dbd forum frequently. They post designer notes and update infos for every update and stuff like that. Also the dbd twitter often gives information or shows, that  something new was posted in the forum. :3
---
WOOOOO!!
---
Aheh fair enough maybe its the killers. But then what do I play, nurse freddy and spirit are obvious hated. Billy is hated for chainsaw. Same with bubba. 
---
Legion I get the most hate from actually I.dont know why
---
Maybe I should try bing bong Wraith I never played him
---
I'm more of a pre-game pep-talkin kind if Ace. Gotta make sure everyone gets their rituals done.
---
Well there went the plans on doing a 12 hour stream today...and back to work tomorrow. Damn son this eats a whole bag of freaking dicks...I'm not mad I'm just disappointed
---
I have no reason to believe so, but I really want it to be Pinhead.
---
You stand still too btw, no shenanigans, or I will loose my Frenzy
---
No mither players are like gifts to me as a killer
---
Is she pregnant?
---
It certainly is! Great little game.
---
&gt; 😭
---
It still has nothing to do with what I was talking about.
---
I said that we need more killers that have mechanics like:
---
Doctor's field based on the terror radius, not a set radius, making terror radius a valuable thing to him
---
Nurse's fatigue after miss, making unrelenting a not-so-bad option on her if it didn't suck dick
---
Trapper's traps based on luck
---
Nurse's calling that used to work on Waking Up and Snapping out of it
---
Myers getting Vault Speed in tier 3, making vault speed perks valuable on him
---
and less stuff like:
---
Feral Frenzy being a schrodinger's hit. counted as one for some things and not for others
---
Plague's entire shit, making anything healing related worthless on her
---
Suggested killer's passive, rendering Enduring worthless
---
Freddy's Lullaby not being affected by anything terror radius related
---
Because I want perks enhance the killer's power and playstyle, not work be limited by it
---
and here you are, talking about removing base mechanics from one side
---
What the fuck is your deal man?
---
No mitter is trash against every killer except legion
---
Relax please no matter how they will buff him it's gonna still be off meta and useless compared to ds adrenaline iron will exhaustion perks and other top tier perks. So just stop
---
Tbh I only really tunnel if the other person is fully healed and/or their gonna give me a hard time when I'm chasing them. But even THEN, I'll chase the unhooked survivor to lure the other guy in, since those guys usually try to get the killer to chase them to prevent tunneling. Two birds, one stone gg ez pz
---
How is it possible that they fuck everything up
---
The clown should have a speed nerf imo because he shouldn't be as fast as the trapper for how fat he is
---
For killer or survivor?
---
Im not angry,just disappointed:(.
---
(I was just frusrtated when i heard the news,now im pretty chill  actually)
---
5 minutes I think
---
I’m just glad we all ended up escaping in the end
---
Then you sink their battleship.
---
The fact that you don't think killers are the same is part of the problem.
---
Survivors complaining about spirit being in every game in high ranks is a problem but apparently it's compleyely fine to complain about how many use DS. Killers are just as toxic, entitled man babies, there's just fewer of them.
---
I play both, i see this bullshit everywhere
---
Survivors should be rewarded for waking up not the other way around
---
i’m currently trying to get adept wraith and it’s making me go insane honestly
---
Could you give an example besides the not being able to hear shit
---
"Hurr durr fortnite bad"
---
At last something on this subreddit that isn't legion
---
&gt; Tbh I only really tunnel if the other person is fully healed and/or their gonna give me a hard time when I'm chasing them. But even THEN, I'll chase the unhooked survivor to lure the other guy in, since those guys usually try to get the killer to chase them to prevent tunneling. Two birds, one stone gg ez pz
---
By using that strategy you must be hit with DS a lot. If I see the rescuer, I go for him no matter what. Maybe hit the unhooked to force him to mend in case of BT or leave him slugged so I can focus on the rescuer.
---
You do know that the 3.3 patch is still planned for in the next week or so right?
---
This company has tried to bring us dedicated servers for over a year now. Every single test is a god forsaken failure. Every patch takes longer to arrive, more testing and such, but is still riddled with bugs. Stop defending them. Have you played the Switch version, too? "It'll run at a stable 30 fps". Yeah. Right. And I am the owner of Coca Cola.
---
As other's have said your timing has to be nearly perfect. The actual "Blind" HAS to be when the killer is in control of their character. Like the blind has to be completed right when they're finished doing the pickup so it "hits" the microsecond they have control so they can't look up. I think chain-blinds (Clicking the flashlight when they're fully blind to re-blind them repeatedly) can help. 
---
I remember one patch they changed it so flashlight blinds during the pickup (and pallet stuns) would still result in them dropping the survivor after the animation completes. Was extremely frustrating on the killer's end (Flashlight saves were extremely easy) and was quickly reverted.
---
That's what you get for just standing there,you should have just kept running
---
“And everyone does it be the first hook”
---
Why? Suicide? People afraid to unhook? Tunnel town nurses?
---
&gt;5 minutes I think
---
Do you know if they were SWF? Have you checked their profiles post game?
---
It’s bad that’s it’s being delayed, especially because Halloween is here...but at this point it might work out better if it’s delayed a couple weeks so CODs hype dies down (and I hate saying that).  COD launches pull a lot of people in.  This is a big moment for DBDs content and potential earnings.  But damn they better give us a 3x event Halloween week at the very least.
---
To be fair coding is weird. An issue that seems fixable could seem fixable until the day before when you suddenly find the underlying issue is much bigger than anticipated and is going to take more coding time to fix.
---
NoED is just a perfect counter to adren
---
You can’t spring with a loose butt.
---
Proportions? Never heard of them
---
You tell ppl to be original but then you post LOL.fucking hypocrite
---
Oh shit I didn't put it after the first sentence, but I usually slug the unhooked survivor, then run after the other guy, the reason I slug the unhooked is to not only to prevent being hit by ds, but to also buy me enough time to chase the other guy, and someone has to spend time picking up the unhooked instead of doing gens
---
There are no punishments for DC - survivors DC when a game doesnt go their way and killers DC for the exact same reason 
---
Its better to vent off steam this way then to call someone ez baby killer tho
---
Dont hate the player, hate the game
---
Oh your right, they should and they also need to be more direct with their answers, I quit watching their streams because they infuriated me, anytime a question was asked they acted like they didn’t know the answer, or beat around the bush or literally stammered in speech. They act like it’s all top secret shit and it will kill the game if they gave a direct answer.  
---
Just like when mcote announced console optimization and then it never happened and he then stated on a stream that he never gave a date on it, when he did and people pointed it out to him!
---
No problem :3
---
I think there was no official date for the Midchapter Update. Some people assume it was supposed to come tomorrow, but something happened so they had to postpone the update. And because of that they also had to postpone the Event? That's what I think too but I don't know.
---
I requested Thurs-Sun off so I could grind the event/Archives and still have time to play COD with my buds.  I’m working 60-70 hours and it’s only going to get worse the closer we get to the holidays.
---
2 slices of ham and a diet soda
---
People take being hung on a meat hook and murdered personally.
---
They havent announced a date for it yet, no, because they dont actually know how long it'll take to fix the problem, but its still planned for Halloween, so chill my dog?
---
Did bubba help you make it? Who's flavor is it dwight, meg etc...
---
Because Clown is dummy T H I C C.
---
They arent going to do anything no.
---
Let's see what we've got.   
---
  
---
Hive, bring a sword.
---
Didn't they announce bloodlust on October 28th - November 1st
---
Very well done! Nurse is my favorite killer, this was really awesome of you to share!
---
Hahaha the jizz belt got me.
---
I'm chill! Just discussing. Sorry if it came off in the wrong way.
---
I hope the bug makes more cents than the circumstances
---
What do u expect from ps4 Players ?
---
When they give us something to respect them for doing, sure.
---
Idk what people said but no problems on console other than long queue times for a role at certain ranks.
---
&gt;I think so. All of them are japanese
---
Just trying to find an explanation. Since they were SWF, they probably were the ones sitting in queue for forever and unfortunately you were the unlucky killer the matchmaking decided to put them against.
---
Isn't it 21k? That's alot of time. Sure, it's technically free, but that's one hell of a grind for a skin.
---
My initial idea was to wear my old pointe shoes and stand on a green screen box, then edit the box out to give the illusion of floating. But I ended up scrapping that.
---
It's probably gonna be either Pennywise or Pinhead
---
*laughs in mori*
---
Ok, I thought it would be scary to see your character hook themselves but I also think the body swap could work. Obey could have a max range like freddy's pull into the dream.
---
Who used noed on billy, he already has his chainsaw
---
I mean when spirit is passive phasing you can’t see her aura with OoO, I don’t get why they don’t do it for Freddy since he’s technically invisible like spirit’s phase
---
Vague shameless plug I guess lol.. on my twitch (gzmo12) I just got affiliate so I unlocked my first emote and it's a cartoon amanda saying no boop please lol 
---
So please no boop a snoot
---
You mean balanced landing
---
Not in my experience and actually most pigs I meet are total assholes that tunnel you even when you have a party hat. Nothing dentures them the snoot boop was a lie!
---
It shouldn't activate if your hooked, so many survivors mess up so many times and get out anyway because adrenaline saves them off a hook. It has too many advantages and not enough negatives. Combined with other perks its even stronger
---
By cool down, I meant the time in which the perk isn’t active
---
okay makes sense i was like wtf
---
We all boop down here. &gt;:3
---
the obvious idea is just: give us the halloween event from last year, no need to mess with rifts, we only need the flower vials same as last year, no biggie. rift and flower vials do not need to be mixed together.
---
Play the killers you play the best and also have BBQ III on.  Focus on getting 8 hooks.  Pay attention to which categories you cap in game.  Theres no reason to break weak pallets if you’re maxed.  There’s no reason to prolong chases if you already have 8k in hunting (though if you have the game in control late game you can chase them longer to get the points).  Keep in mind You get devious points for successfully using your ability.
---
So u have never heard about balancing perks ?
---
Disconnecting is rife now due to the matchmaking changes. People wanna derank often. Sometimes it has nothing to do with which killer you're playing, or the map, or even what has happened in the game.
---
wait wrong editing
---
Yeah. If you figure out they have distortion is very easy to waste all the stacks and make it useless.
---
I need line of sight to see where I’m blinking, hence the eyeholes. :)
---
Thats weird because I don't. Must be just you man.
---
Well done.
---
I should play plague more...
---
DS is a succesful killer stun
---
Change that to succesful pallet stun or we gonna have problems.
---
The perk doesn't activate until 2 or more survivors are on a gen
---
Literally my only remaining achievements are the impossible huntress achievements, and low tier adept killers. They really need to change Adept from Merciless to a 4k.. it's nearly impossible without playing against potato rank survivors.
---
Nah, I'm just a dork who likes to be goofy XD
---
It's up to you. If I were you I'd try a couple games with each to see which helped more or was more fun to use and then stick with the better one. 
---
I will say that IMO Iron Maiden is only really good with BBQ; the time saved on reloading alone isn't enough to make it worth running over other perks.
---
I’m sorry what? You want to nerf ds and borrowed time? Sounds like you’ve been tunneling recently
---
Lmao remember when bond could be used on killers?
---
Im sorry huh? When did i say anything about ds or borrowed time?
---
*Mister Stark I don’t want to feel so good on this planet anymore*
---
All of them are still problems\~! All of them still need fixing\~!
---
So, y'know.
---
Fuck off.
---
Lol this subreddit is hilarious! XD
---
Insta down killer using noed. Big brain time
---
My bad I meant to tell that to the other person
---
They chainsaw is for Mindgames, lucky cross map hits and faster pallet removing.  Better survivors will make you M1 them.
---
Oh lol
---
Glady ;)
---
While I understand Peanits and not_queen don't actually have control over the situation and just have to be the bearers of bad news, the fact that the initial announcement just caused a wave of confusion is pretty bad.
---
The entire thing was worded in such a way that made it seem like it was the playerbase's fault for even expecting it to come on the 22nd. 
---
I don't know what kind of strategy they had for this damage control but it failed spectacularly.
---
* Nearly last minute cancellation of the event
---
* No real explanation as to why
---
* No estimation as to when it would be fixed
---
* A snarky attitude across the various posts of "Well we never OFFICIALLY announced the 3.3.0 patch so you're not allowed to hold us accountable for it"
---
And as bonus fuel for the fire, people have been both burning through their reserves of Insta-heals and strong Nurse Add-ons before the patch hits, and today was supposed to be the day we get some relief from that. But now it looks like we'll probably have enough week of this shit.
---
They keep giving me hillbilly chainsaw hits which I can never do :(
---
I didn't realize they changed it, it seems exactly the same with me
---
Get a bunch of people to 99%stalked, then when I’m a chase pop night shroud and get a 1-hit.
---
Also stay hidden as much as possible, as survivors(like me, or at least okay ones) are constantly looking around.
---
Well then that’s how you know the billy using noed is bad at billy
---
no they didn't announce any bloodhunt at all. Those were just speculations.
---
What about plague?
---
Bahahaha this made me legit lol! Well done! 😂
---
&gt;You guys think they are gonna do something with these hitboxes? I find my self always getting hit by stupid hatchets that totally miss.
---
They tried that once and it completely broke Huntress because they only addressed Hatchets hitboxes but not survivor's hitboxes. They would have to create individual hitboxes for every survivor considering they have different sizes (nobody would play David or Jane ever again). Currently every survivor model shares the same cylinder hitbox which also benefits them since it excludes survivors limbs and it also doesn't lean while you are running. You need to aim directly at the center of survivors or very close to it since hatchets also have a forgiving shape, a basketball. 
---
This is talking strictly about hitboxes, most hits people complain are ping related and this can't be fixed. Well, it can but you'd have to play in LAN environment or host a KYF match as survivor, leaving you with 0 ping.
---
15 seconds isn’t that long to count on if the killer finds them though. A beginner shouldn’t really be going for unhooks imo. I don’t think Bill is a good place to start, but I can see how others would disagree. 
---
Also, Steve definitely doesn’t have the worst teachables lol. That would probably be ace.
---
Yea Ive been called toxic before and had no idea what I did wrong so that clears it up
---
Which is why you make sure things are ready before announcing a release date.
---
A common theme seems to be to ignore his stalk power and just use the stealth part for sneaky hits.
---
For the most part this seems to be the more powerful way to play ghostface, combined with his power recharge addons and perks that delay survivors, like sloppy butcher and dying light.
---
I personally only go for stalk if i bring addons that increase the stalk rate, or if a survivor is completly oblivious and doesn't notice me at all.
---
THE BOOP IS A LIE I JUST GET MORI OR CAMPED WHEN I DO IT LIEEEEESSS
---
Will dance for downvotes!
---
He can hit you when you're awake now, you should be able to see him.
---
Thank you! The saw was really fun to make, and it still smells faintly like cinnamon, which is a nice bonus.
---
No, it's just that now that the killers that were previously being complained about (Legion, Nurse) have been changed, Spirit is the new target. I'm perfectly ok with her being a great killer, it's just that it's a bit too easy to reach her potential.
---
Glad to see not everybody is going insane over having to wait a few days. This comment section here is what I was hoping the pinned post about this subject would be like.
---
As a pig main, if we ever meet in game I will let you boop my snoot.
---
&gt;  guarantee me an escape
---
Wouldn't that make it a meta perk?
---
Your right there is no point in arguing
---
-pats demo's head-
---
Ahah this one is gold xD
---
To have normal decency just because its online not face to face its a person behind the screen
---
So question; how do you punish a killer who is sitting around  a hook doing nothing, while not punishing a killer who hooked someone, turned around, and noticed scratch marks on the wall nearby?
---
The devs have stated multiple times that Camping/Tunneling are not bannable offenses, and that they aren't even offenses in the first place.
---
And look where we are at now
---
Hatchet's hitbox is a ball. it's as wide as it's long
---
Survivor's hitbox is a capsule. There are two sizes: Crouching and Doing Anything Else. No matter where your character is leaning, the hitbox is always the same
---
Hope this clarifies why you're getting hit
---
&gt;I didn't realize they changed it, it seems exactly the same with me
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019
---
It's because people compare it to Adrenaline. These perks are not comparable, no matter how much people want to. Adrenaline is supposed to reward survivors for making it to endgame. Which they WANT to do, as it's their objective. Killers don't. They want people killed as soon as possible. Relying on a perk that helps you pick up slack that you've lacked all game is the definition of a "crutch". Getting rewarded for failing is bad.
---
Fuck me yourself
---
Any perks to reaching devotion? I just started playing not long ago and I'm pretty close. I didn't know that's what would happen.
---
nah, I'm okay with him being able to be seen via perks if the survivor is awake. Especially considering the strength he has versus Borrowed Time and soon Object of Obsession whenever the patch hits when survivors are asleep. 
---
Keeps the theme consistent, you want to be awake if at all possible versus Freddy. Survivors shouldn't feel like there is an upside to being asleep for any reason.
---
Eh, I like it because it's so dark.
---
It actually feels like a horror movie location.
---
You're taken out of Night Shroud for anything of the following:
---
+ You M1 (successful or missed)
---
+ You get stunned by a Pallet
---
+ Survivors directly put their camera on you for 1.8ish seconds
---
Lean stalking is much faster then regular stalking at the cost of making you find something to lean from.
---
You can always do the Myers tactic and 99% Survivors then get right behind them to pop the Exposed on them for a easy down.
---
You can also run Ghostface as more of a jumpscare Killer and less of a Myers with something like Nurses Calling to get some sneaky grabs/hits because the Survivor is more focused on healing while hiding.
---
&gt; posts an opinion
---
&gt; about a fact
---
Oh alrighty, if I'm with a rank 5 or something I should just leave and re-queue?
---
sorry, someone explain.
---
I forgot about her cuz nobody plays her
---
bruh
---
"What, you think i'm just going to stand there and take it?"
---
Worng
---
I’ve noticed this too, I think the time window to grab a survivor ends before the actual unhook animation ends
---
Also Kate’s perk Boil Over lets you do that faster. Oh and if the Killer decides to dribble you because they think you might have DS, the third time they pick you up you will be able to run away.
---
Looks badass
---
How is Bloodwarden a second chance perk?
---
It's something you have to actually set up and can very easily be ignored if the Survivors just run out the gate anyway.
---
You have to admit, the reason people are so persistent to have this concept and implemented into the game is because it is a intriguing concept. It would essentially give the game a different feel to it. Rather than a survival game, it would be a mystery. Perhaps in practice this doesn’t hold up, however that doesn’t prevent people from hoping it becomes a possibility
---
Omg you did such an amazing job well done!
---
Gently?
---
I generally check nearby totem spawns, destroy them no matter what, then either grab the nearest gen or I go for the worst gen in the map.
---
If the nearest gen is a safe gen, or has another survivor on it, I bug off to usually the most middle-placed generator.
---
I find that usually getting the worst placed gens out of the way early sets you up for success and less chance of being 3-genned. Also, a lot of times it's a high traffic area and I would prefer for the killer to chase me rather than a random teammate.
---
Haha coming from League I know all too well about the dev's not adding what the players want.
---
Wait what? Tier 1 Myers has always countered Spine Chill. That's changing?
---
This is a response I always see to delays in any game, and it's such a fanboyish one.
---
You'll get it late and it will still have all the bugs it would ha e otherwise.
---
There was one thing that stopped them from release, they won't ever tell you what it was, it could have literally been a logistics issue and had nothing to do with "bugs" and all of the little bug, glitches, issues, etc, that were all going to be there are still going to be there.
---
They will all also go unfixed for as long as ole ty of others unless they're game breaking.
---
Where do people get the idea that game devs somehow release their updates or patches are full of bugs and they need time to fix and polish them, and THATS why they delay? It's such an odd fallacy that comes from nowhere.
---
Sorry I really a halloween event for halloween but a halloween event in chrismast is enought I think
---
Iridescent Pingas
---
The yellow isn't the issue, it's the Loud Noise Notification for every X seconds that they're on it. Discordance 1 pings you every 8 seconds, while Discordance 3 pings you every 12 seconds. While you're in a chase you're less likely to be staring at that yellow generator but you are likely to notice how many pings you hear, so you can gauge how much progress that generator has made.
---
Dude. What are you huffing and can I have some? If you play solo you get punished for it no exceptions BECAUSE YOU’RE PLAYING WITH RANDOMS WHO RARELY COMMUNICATE AT ALL. It’s randoms you play with thus you’ll get brain dead allies who don’t know the back of their hand more often than not. If you don’t get caught they certainly will because they think you are with them when in reality you’re across the map and they are stuck with the killer! Not once has randoms solo play given me a full team of people with brains. Not once.
---
All I would do and anyone else with a lick of sense will do in randoms solo play is GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM OTHER SURVIVORS! At this point you will just keep saying “but it works” so I’m shutting this conversation down by blocking you. Everything you’ve said so far can be negated by how the game is at the moment. People WILL DC and you can’t stop it, people in solo play will be brain dead and lose or make you lose and there’s nothing you can do about it. SWFs will demolish this boss so easily by secretly telling eachother what to do when they see eachother or tell eachother where they are and there’s nothin you can do about it. Also, the killer would never be allowed to carry survivor items because that’s fucking stupid and there’s nothing you can do about it.
---
Now, I’m blocking you. And there’s nothing. You. Can. Do. About. It.
---
Does this mean my dude Ghostface won't have to worry about OoO anymore?
---
It does indeed
---
It really depends on the map but you can expect to play at 30fps until there are many things going on on your screen (survs 360ing or even throwing hatchets with Huntress). It is not too bad in my opinion overall
---
Ok that's sexy. May have a new main.
---
I dont know if you own these perks, but an alternative to otzdarva's basement camp-demo i play that should work is:
---
hex ruin
---
hex thrill of the hunt
---
thanathophobia
---
sloppy butcher
---
right at the start of the game, you place 2 portals next to your hex totems. You keep the last 2 aviable. Track them and hurt them, defend your totems (you get a noise-notification when survis star to work on them) 
---
if you dont own ruin you micht want to try:
---
hex lullaby
---
Hex TotH
---
Overcharge
---
(free perk slot) 
---
I just recommend to play territorial with demo. Dont forget, survivors can only destroy your portals if you used them (highlighted yellow)
---
Spine Chill, Iron Will, and either Fixated/Sprint Burst or Quick &amp; Quiet/Lithe would be a good combo
---
To be honest, you should learn how to loop though. If you're on PC, I'd be glad to help
---
Yeah lets buff top tier killer
---
It’s been years but I’ve had this problem on Xbox, not with DBD but other games. It had something to do with port forwarding settings on my router, wish I could remember the solution but I suck with network stuff. I would investigate there though, if I figured it out you can too!
---
Well that’s awful. This is almost EA Madden devs level of incompetence, I was definitely expecting better from BHVR. I just picked up the game on PC in prep for this too, damn.
---
Gordon Freeman from Half-Life as a survivor. He goes through interdimensional shit and we already have a Valve character so why not
---
"how to loop dead by daylight survival"
---
This reminds me of back during the launch where you could Sprint Burst while crawling if you pressed sprint while on the ground. Was really funny but really useless since the movement speed boost didn’t give you much on the ground at the time.
---
Star citizen wwas announced 7 YEARS ago and its still not out. You dont rush art, especally one as technical as a video game.
---
Please blink and down me
---
Dang, a proposed buff I actually like
---
Throw pallets no matter what. Even if killer is doing an obvious bait. Pls.....PLS.
---
I play strictly survivor. Would It be hard to dodge hits?
---
yeah this is what ive been waiting for.
---
Me: *Jumps out tall window to escape Ghostface*
---
Everyone else trick or treating:
---
This cant happen if the withering event never start
---
&gt;Parkour: after running for 3 seconds you vault windows and pallets twice as fast and gain a small speed boost after vaulting.
---
So Lithe on steroids without a cooldown, yeah... no.
---
&gt;Blood donor: after healing, getting hit by the killer will blind the killer with blood for 2 seconds. 120 second cooldown.
---
So free Flashlight Stun?
---
&gt;Pallet shield maker: after a pallet has been broken you can salvage parts from it, after getting 2 broken pallets you can create a pallet shield item. (Takes a while to make) this item can block one hit from a killer when it is aimed at the killer. The blocked hit will put the killer into an animation as long as the normal successful hit.

We don't need more second chances
---
I have a clip of the same thing happening to me on Badham as Jeff. Legion's lunge is fucking busted
---
2 comments ago you trashed micro transactions and in this comment you suggest they hired new people. I dont think you know as much about this industry as you are lettting on..
---
Doctor should have an add on that blows up gens and puts em back to 0%.
---
There is a shitpost flair yes
---
Lower your pitchforks, people! It's a big update! I'd rather have a delayed, but good update than a bad one! COME AT ME!
---
As a legion main this is r/angryupvote
---
Didn't mention that part bc I don't agree with it but go ahead and make a big deal out of it
---
Spine chill lights up EXACTLY as you hear the Halloween piano notes. OH
---
Diversion has helped me so many times to open the gates when I'm the last survivor in a match. Is a great perk, if you use it properly it can save you from being hooked more than once in a match if your not very good at running away from the killer (like me).
---
If you're toxic because someone exists then you're toxic, so you can't agree with him can you?
---
Oi, I'm Russian too, first time meeting one on this sub) definitely agree with you)
---
Welcome to game development
---
Keep it up and you’ll lose New Years too.
---
No thank you, I believe you. I just find it a weird statement. I played against 3-4 Dying Lights yesterday. It's a pretty damn solid perk now.
---
How do you play her?
---
Like I always start every match by trapping up several loops, maybe tripple trap the killer shack (one inside, one out the window, one other side of the pallet) and double trap a pallet or two. Then it's hunting time. The trick is to trap up the harder loops for you and then just win the normal chases. Further, realize that once you slow them down some and have a chance to place more traps, they will be consistently moving more slowly to do things, which works to your advantage. Further further, she tends to be a grindy killer, where a lot of times you are winning if you can get a pallet drop then go back to play defense on the gen you just chased people away from.
---
I expect people to sneak over my traps, and plan accordingly.
---
Cringe
---
Survivors get oblivious when asleep now, so something is happening with Freddy
---
They can report you when you respond to their salt. And then get an advertising. They always look forward to that
---
I'm sorry if I'm downvoted, or banned for this, but here's a question for you. Would you rather have a delayed, but good event, or a rushed and broken one? A delayed game is eventually good, a rushed game is forever bad.
---
“A” bug
---
Just 800k more
---
L  E  G  I  O  N
---
Oh it definitely is.  But because you're not killing them they're getting lots of points and they heal their team mates faster and they take additional risks because they know that they won't be killed until the end.  This all leads to more points for the obsession.
---
NEIN! not the lederhosen
---
Plague mains rise up !!
---
ok but they all suck except spirit fury
---
Lol there’s no way you’re good. Freddy is good without addons but Spirit isn’t, sure buddy
---
They never said mid chapter patch was supposed to be today (or tomorrow in your post). They specifically said they didn't announce it so we shouldn't just assume.
---
That they obviously intended the mid chapter patch to release today is another matter (at least according to them) and we should just ignore that.
---
THANK YOU!
---
Then go to their job by yourself and release the stuff we'll see if the update feels competent.
---
No, I actually go out of my way to make sure I’m not tunneling, because if I don’t, I know I’ll end up accidentally doing so, but I’m certain this isn’t true with most people.
---
Not the tunnel, just quitting or being too dangerous to unhook.
---
Aside from that, as soon as the person is on the hook the Nurse is looking for the next person. Blink, hit, blink, hit. Two people left now.
---
This is before you factor in perks, because Make Your Choice Nurse is *hilarious*. If you get the unhook, Nurse blinks in from across the map, well outside Borrowed Time, downs the unhooked survivor, one-shots the unhooker, slugs them both or does a hook trade to avoid Decisive Strike. Who's going to come for a save against that?
---
Most OP perk on the switch is overcharge can confirm.
---
A game breaking bug.
---
Go and play a killer you do have perks for and pour all of the blood points into her. I'm on xbox and apparently console has a much harder to master nurse. Make sure your sensitivity is as high as it goes and just practice blinks on people. It's best to learn her without add ons. I havent mastered her yet but I do okay so if anyone knows more please chime in.
---
100% was the mid chapter patch intended for today. They are just using the missing announcement as an excuse because they think we are that dumb.
---
Those are some clean hands for a dead person
---
"First" the servers. Oh my god new players are adorable! &lt;3
---
Nope lol
---
Yeah, my list was pretty sketchy, just things that gave you a comeback, ie not facing a wall when picking someone up to avoid the save, stuff like that.
---
Pretty solid advice. I was skeptical at first, but after trying it in a game, I think this strategy is actually broken.
---
Yes, it came down to automod hiding it because her account was so new. A talk with the mods helped clear it up.
---
If you’re in SWF with a rank 5 that isn’t going to help.
---
Yes, you are obviously the only Person thats disappointed by this, there isnt a single soul that feels like that.
---
Got any other interesting or unique opinions?
---
BTW. Im not angry, this is Satire o7
---
Why did I actually, can you tell me? Did I offend anyone?
---
This list is crazy as fucking shit. only noed and blood warden are second chance perks. *maybe* rancor. and moris are not second chance, either. they just skip part of the game. that's different than a second chance 
---
the fact this idiocy was upvoted is not surprising at all
---
WOW THATS AMAZING!!!
---
2sad2care
---
People die when killed
---
I think OP chose based off a quick glance of who the characters are and not the other details that suggest they should be elsewhere
---
Is the rift delayed as well?
---
Have you played new Freddy? He's amazing.
---
This is only tangentially related to this sub; how do you make memes? Like I know meme templates exist but what about new stuff,  putting two pics together or putting text on a pic? Is there ones you can do on your phone? 
---
I tried using MS paint and got mocked here for bad cropping.
---
That’s unfortunate that controller is at a disadvantage in this game I just got into killer recently and I wanted to learn a powerful killer but she’s so hard to get the hang of I’m only getting about 2-3 hooks a game and half the time it’s because the survivors think I’m going to blink twice but they run back into me.
---
Waiting for the Legion buffs so people can eat their words
---
Inb4 people downvote cuz it's legion
---
That's a good question, i always find them to be toxic. ALWAYS, you know the match is gonna suck when there is a russian involved
---
The distant t pose made me laugh
---
Her blinks are getting a cooldown
---
I'm not complaining about the delay. The joke is that the event delay is happening right before halloween, so it could end up that the halloween event is after halloween.
---
Yeah but you can just, ya know, hit them. Looking down also works. And just not walk into every pallet as they slowly but assuredly pallet away all defense options. 
---
I don't view it as toxic cause I can just kill them and take them out of the match, instant heals being removed removes the only toxic thing I actually think is toxic which is busted gear.
---
;_;
---
Alright I’ll get the perks I want and go on from there thanks :)
---
Which is really hard to do and often only possible with the right addons. Also not on every loop but yeah, I would say this is what separates the dedicated billys from the rest.
---
Really? I love the aspect of Max's abilities and making you question every choice you made
---
What made my heart race was the kate incident, thank god I do explore everything so I could save her
---
Why would they do that if her movement speed is too slow to catch anyone?
---
Thats the real crime here
---
Nope, i’m so frustrated with them. Took the next 3 days off on vacation too as I have a 3 day weekend coming up and I was going to grind my ass off to do the Archives, Event and Rift. I’m working a lot the following 3 weeks and won’t have much time to play now.
---
Offerings and BBQ both modify after-game points, other perks (and add-ons) modify in-game points.
---
(This is why party streamers has the potential to give a lot of BP if you max out your BPs in game, they're equivalent to 4 stacks of BBQ each)
---
This means that though I think most (non-bbq) blood point perks are usually not worth it as killer, they can be useful if you're using a specific bloodpoint offering in order to make sure you max out that category to make full use of the extra points.
---
I am. There wasnt a summer event, and bloodhunts are so rare. When I first started playing, bloodhunts were a monthly thing and such a treat. Now.... it's like we did something wrong and are getting punished for it.
---
It's kind of entitled to want something extra every time something doesn't go exactly as planned, don't you think? I mean, I could see if they canceled the event completely it would be a good gesture to replace it with something else, but at this point the event is still going to happen.
---
Asking for compensation or something extra makes sense when your bus or plane is late, but this seems a little over the top to me. Plus, a Bloodhunt increases the likelihood of a poor quality game since more people are playing selfishly.
---
Lol you’re setting noob killers up
---
Yeah but then people would complain that behavior keeps the community in the dark about future changes. Been in a community where that was a problem (smash)
---
Those perks are the reason I camp and tunnel funnily enough. Heheheh!
---
Fly safe CMDR, o7
---
So should I just wait until the nerf or do you think it’s just something I’ll have to adjust to that won’t tremendously affect what I’ve got a feel for already?
---
Actually true. The only times I get hit by DS is if they accidentally run into me again within a minute due to bad positioning. Both BT and DS are fine
---
Your submission to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
* Video submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to self-promotion spam. 
---
Memes you can hear
---
The fact people overlook this anytime any game has technical issues today blows my mind.
---
Communication is key, not just for knowing when to hype something up but also when you shut your mouth until everything is ready to go. 
---
How hard would it be to have said "We're pushing out a new PTB with the Rift and Archives. Once everything's good, we'll push out the new update when everything is ready."
---
If they said that when the PTB first dropped, and if the community managers reminded people not to trust dates that don't come from the team when they *first* started to float around, people wouldn't be salty now. 
---
This should be a really simple process yet I seen way too many developers fuck this up for some reason.
---
Cool
---
You fail skillchecks when she is sucking your dick
---
If heard through the grape vine btw that it might be on Halloween
---
We need to see the emblems to know what actually happened.
---
Bruh moment
---
I’ve got 5 on something that indirectly nerfs Pig and makes 3 perks shatter into a million flaming bits.
---
Well did you do it?
---
It is perhaps more accurate to say that it works exactly as intended, it's just that the priority matchmaking makes for an unsatisfying game when you're put against far stronger opponents.
---
Killer queues are invariably longer than survivor queues because there are 4 survivors required for every killer. 5 minutes is pretty reasonable, all things considered.
---
If you haven't played survivor *at all* then you're going to take a hell of a pounding as *most* killers. I'd really recommend playing survivor to earn enough Bloodpoints to get some perks for your chosen killer, to make life easier. The experience of being a survivor also translates to being a killer, since you'll be able to anticipate your opponent's moves.
---
Survivor queues are *generally* shorter, and there's less pressure because the killer can only chase one survivor at a time. Bloodpoints won't be massive, but they'll be steady. If you jump right in with killer then you've have longer queues with minimal payoffs, which just makes the whole process harder than it needs to be.
---
Up to yourself, though.
---
dying light, thanatophobia, hex: ruin, pop goes the weasel,
---
add ons: Swing Chains, Jump Rope,
---
thats slow down freddy
---
The fuck.
---
God I wish
---
The only Halloween event I will accept at this point
---
And usually they give us a few days warning.
---
Or don’t bundle it in with new content so they don’t have EXACTLY THIS happen.
---
People keep saying it will only affect people who aren’t good at nurse and that the cool down starts the moment you finish a blink (so when you start coughing part of the cool down is already done)
---
Tbh I dunno why they chose to nerf this specifically.
---
Jesus some people got no decency honestly anyway go check out my pateron you can get my cool dbd tricks and tips video a day early only 20$ a week
---
honestly i dont care that much because the event is boring as sin anyway. i get why people disliked the hallow blight event though i loved it, but they could have done something like the chinese new year's event
---
I mean thats ridiculous but okay
---
Just did that....
---
Eh, that's a fair cop, I guess.
---
ma hex
---
People claim only bad nurses are gonna be affected by it in terms of skill.
---
I don’t see how tbh.
---
I don't think so - I just think that certain perks counter others well. Old Freddy used to counter Distortion too, cause once you were asleep and outside the terror radius, it would just eat up your tokens.
---
Most streamers are finding success not focusing too much on stalking, and building him with nurses calling, sloppy butcher, thanatophobia and shroud recovery addons.
---
Ghostface is the only stealth killer who can normally chase and hit someone while stealthy (no TR or red stain) and at a 115 speed. That is huge by itself. Myers is slower and his lunge sucks at tier 1, wraith has to uncloak to hit and pig only has a dash which requires her to be crouched and move slowly. Demogorgon has to come out of a portal to be stealthy.
---
There is another advantage at constantly being in night shroud, as it will provide u info when they get you out of it. If they try to get you out of it in a chase, it could be difficult for them to loop optimally.
---
That being said, if you can get a full stalk, by any means do it. Another good idea is to leave ppl 99% stalked for a quick mid chase stalk and instadown later in the trial.
---
Naisu
---
The fuck?  I'm still just upset that they hyped archives for TODAY and it's delayed, such a major part of why people have been upset is the lack of events and of course the one event I was PAINFULLY excited for was delayed. So weird.
---
Dude what do you expect it's dead by daylight killers objective is to kill all survivors and survivors job is to make it out alive. It's not gonna be fair it never is, your literally saying that using an insta heal and Decisive strike or head on is fun for you but not the killer
---
Remember to Jump into the hatch in your warehouse that leads to a 50m fall
---
It ends at oct 21 and you clearly don’t understand that SWF on discord is random and you run into all sorts of people including women omg they exist on the internet. Stop assuming so much.
---
Thank you! I have been in Europe for a long time to see my family so unfortunately everyone on my friends lists is on EU :/ but I’m sure I’ll find someone on NA that’s down to help me out :)
---
Only 4? I wagered 5
---
Yah that was all hot air blown up are ass and BhVR doesn’t have the power or balls to ban people on console! Microsoft and Sony hood their balls in a jar...
---
stfu, cheeky cunt, the lad asked a simple question.
---
Except the team working on skins has nothing to do with the team working on getting the patch ready. Every patch comes with skins to be released at certain times and all they need to do is push a button to make them available. Meanwhile they obviously had a big issue with the 3.3.0 patch, and if they had released it today, you same people would be bitching about how broken the patch was. Just chill.
---
Super cool! I love the way the light illuminates the outfit, great job!
---
he literally specifically said that being toxic because of tunneling is fair. he never said that being toxic because of the killer is fair or unfair
---
Depending on skill and location, you could rig a harness from something like a tree branch out of frame to produce the hover effect for photoshoots
---
I find maneuvering the chainsaw really challenging, to the point where I would rather play bubba with the grease and chili addons instead
---
Artificial rock.
---
Nah. Don't know professionals in the video game industry can't be held to professionally standards? Every coder is just some lousy intern who shouldn't expected to be competent at his job no matter how many years go by. 
---
Give BHVR a break. Clearly they're a struggling team of amateurs. Why else would the worst looking game on my PS4 also be the worst running game on my PS4?
---
Dude I don't care if I get 4ks I just love the thrill of hooking people a whopping 8 times, and Lord willing, 12.
---
Guess I'll play more Hitman while I wait, looking forward to the event if it ever comes out though.
---
You should drill it and pop a red led in it
---
Does the game map have 1 less gen than the others
---
Yes but if you don't comment on it people will still think they're right to do it. Do you want him or her to still be toxic just because someone plays Spirit or not? It's best to comment and advise rather than keep your mouth shut about it.
---
Next Halloween.
---
Print an ebony mori
---
It looks amazing, what did you used for the glow in your hand ?
---
a rather dumb question
---
What if you stacked that with T3 Myers?
---
i truly doubt a random internet person will convince that dude not to be toxic, lol
---
Nvm, I just saw that they are leds
---
Damn, Dead by Disappointment
---
that is a bitch move imo
---
like u don’t get salt if you’re not salty i play both killer and survivor and only got about 2 salt messages in my 1 year of playing
---
and you know why is that? bc i don’t tunnel/camp/teabag/flashlight spam etc.
---
At some point you say, fuck art. No mans sky is better
---
No, I think you mean Easter 2026
---
Incompetence is a bit harsh. Talk about privileged. Maybe YOU should fix the bugs since you seem so quick to judge others.
---
You mean a Sponsored Legion skin where you got Adidas track pants, this as a massive shirt and a cardboard box cutout of Survivors faces for a mask?  I can see it work. 
---
And yes I do mean this EXACT image as a HUGE shirt, those things are comfy and my favorite anarchists deserve comfort while being largely ineffective.
---
DS isn’t like that anymore. It was changed awhile back.
---
4th of July 3030.
---
I guess we’ll just have to wait until it’s out for a while and see but imo she did need a rework a good nurse is too deadly
---
Lmao yes but I'm pretty sure having less toxic people is a good thing, being positive and advising is certainly better than just sitting there and doing nothing.
---
Game is deleted from your hard drive and your IP is banned
---
by "ending" i mean that the furthest it goes back is October 19 which means that OP lied about only playing with her last night. im not sure where he said that he found this person on the DBD Discord, but go off, fam
---
Billy and wraith
---
You're not very bright, are you?
---
Fire the current people, they're clearly not cutting it. Replace them. That's what I'm saying.
---
Especially for killing. Bad enough that survivors have heartbeats, wouldn't want them to also smell you
---
Hotttttt
---
hurrdurr you're not a chef so you can't criticize food
---
I’m saying the current way they do events is absolute trash. I don’t want reskinned hooks or gens. They’re pointless, they don’t add anything. I want new mechanics like we had with the pustule plants. But people complained like fuck and now we get reskinned bullshit
---
Could have been Lithe as well
---
Day before?  Depending on locale it was day of. I only saw this at like 10 o'clock before going to bed.
---
Wow. You must not have been around during the monthly bloodhunts. If you were you'd understand why I said that. The last monthly bloodhunt had a challenge attached to it and we couldn't hit it because it was so outrageous.
---
good thing they werent positive about it then. they simply didnt bring it up :) stop getting so worked up over a video game. go research politics and donate to charities
---
Bad Nurse's won't be able to apply constant blink pressure like they do now on Live.
---
New Nurse will take more skills/guess work from the Nurse player, so yes, it's true.
---
They could do what competent companies do- announce the date when you know you can hit it. The “small company” excuse quit being valid when they bought out their publisher- now it’s just sad such a great concept is owned by a mismanaged and incompetent company.
---
Behold the privileged masses. Bunch of spoiled crybaby cunts who want everything to be perfect and they want it yesterday.
---
That’s my point you don’t know where he met her so, go off fam also I am not sure where he said that he only played with her last night he said I played with her last night that  doesn’t mean he couldn’t have played with her before post history only goes back couple days.
---
How's your brother doin
---
They just shared something on Steam tho?
---
in what fucking world are those second chance perks?
---
Np bruh, hope you hope on the game and have fun
---
YES
---
So we as a community shouldn't strive for less toxicity or help those who are toxic change? People leave the game due to these kinds of people, is that a good thing or what? You seem pretty clueless or a survivor main, unsure which right now.
---
Fantastic!!!! I would love to cosplay a killer but I'm not sure who. Thinking of wraith since I'm pretty tall
---
you are calling having only a few a year a "punishment"
---
you and all these batshit insane basement dwellers need to go outside
---
I'd say it's punishment for ignoring one of your objectives which is totems. It's entirely avoidable which also makes the complaints hold even less weight.
---
You have to realize that this game's population isn't as big as some games like Fortnite, DotA, or LoL. I always laugh when I see comments like this. They'd rather put you in a match with someone slightly above (or sometimes below) your ranking so you can actually play the game without waiting for a huge queue. 
---
The other two alternatives would be to place you at a killer at the same level as your friend (rank 20-15) or to try and average it out and give you a green ranked killer but then you guys are just going to stomp him. The devs put you against a killer on the same level as your highest survivor because you guys are in voice comms so it *should* give you guys enough of an edge to win. Being in voice comms is pretty much hacking. You guys can just tell each other where the killer is, what direction he's heading after he hooks someone, etc.
---
Burger King Myers is still pretty sassy.
---
I play both. survivor a little bit more
---
i know you don't actually care tho bc survivor mains are entitled piss babies
---
Just imagining "Hookey McShoudermeat" throwing a shit fit is worth it sometimes not getting a 4k game...
---
W0t
---
It’s delayed we don’t know.
---
You got your flair wrong, it should be labeled shitpost, not suggestion.
---
Never use mori, you will get less hook points. Its all about that sweet bloodpoints
---
Not even
---
what do you think second chance means
---
BING BONG
---
Survivors literally only stealth on that map. It's so boring as killer.
---
I use GIMP for most images. It's free and can produce results as professional as the time you're willing to put into them - I'd certainly recommend it to you.
---
yeah holding m1 is a good time
---
Damn it
---
Occasionally, when someone is on the hook, I see their aura repeatedly tapping the attempt escape button, but never holding it down long enough to actually try to escape. Are they trying to signal something to the rest of the survivors?
---
I thought the only thing he sees below is the belly
---
You get another chance
---
As a killer main i whole heartedly agree with the sentiment. Killer should be the power role and that just isnt the case. However i do have to agree with the survivors on this one. Spirit is fine as she is minus the collision with survivors while in phase walk imo but prayer beads got to go. Its not because they are too powerful its because there is a lack of counter play. There are things in this game that have some counter play that i still feel are overpowered so something with zero counter play really meeds to go. I dont blame people for using overpowered things to win since its in the game but that doesnt mean we as a community should just shrug it off.
---
Was beyond a speculation. There were literal gamefiles saying those were the dates in the ptb
---
Yeah. I can play runescape mobile while doing gennys.
---
*unholy shrieking*
---
The dedicated servers argument is dead too. Console doesn’t have them, but bhvr fanboys are all “but we finally got dedicated servers after 3 years of begging for it!” Only reason the switch has them is because the Nintendo online service is utter garbage.
---
Bruh I'm talking about perks in General, I know how to counter them I am just stating facts, their made to be used and their not gonna he fair.
---
Surprisingly enough i never see this anymore i more see people farming me with the killer chasing them but if not i usually find them hiding in a locker right beside my hook
---
The pilgrim?
---
Using NOED on Plague. Now that's Megabrain
---
Now we can leave, we don’t like crummy moldy machinery designed to appear as animals.
---
**unless dead people lay within them if course**
---
The immunity to survivor's reporting you for tunneling when they are just bad at hiding and camping them for simply chasing someone near their hook
---
that's actually a great point.
---
what is the second chance, pray tell
---
But dude new totem spawns fixed everything 😂
---
which means it's something they planned when releasing the PTB but EVERYTHING in the PTB patch is not confirmed so it's just speculations
---
There isn’t a difference
---
You’re not a real nurse cosplayer unless you can float lol, this is a great cosplay!
---
And now blink
---
I’ve seen GMP it looks very complicated.
---
Thank god
---
Does survivors still grow madness while they are down?
---
In which case
---
*Burn the bodies*
---
Nope. Ps4 and Xbox have fuck all for dedicated servers.
---
I will bodyslam you until you are broken and boop your fucking snoot no matter what don't tempt me
---
Wither the devs like it or not.
---
Yeah but at tier 1 you'll get notifications per every 8 seconds as long as the survivors are on a gen. Level it up and it turns into 10/12 seconds, which means a lot less accurate info.
---
A lot of survivors hated that event though
---
can some mod flair this as shitpost?
---
Was that back when hooks stayed broken?  The old meta was built around that.  Survivors would sabo all the hooks available on the map so killers would HAVE to use agitation and iron grasp to bring them to the basement.
---
Thats toxic
---
I don't hate killers dude. I hate that insta heals are getting nerfed cause it's one of the (few) fun survivor things to do. Clutch insta heals make my heart pound
---
I sprint toward the first gen and look for totems along the way. Then I begin working on it until the killer is close or I see him. Then the chase begins.
---
When they don’t get downed.
---
When they get downed and I chase one of the other guys while they lay down and get healed.
---
When I down the obsession to force someone to help them so I can hit everyone else building up my STBFL.
---
Playing the game.
---
Ever worked in an environment where sales/marketing write checks developers have to cash?  It's more common than you think.
---
I think that joke when flying 35,000 feet above your head, mate.
---
This echoes what people said about nurse. Spirit's inevitable "rebalance" is going to be a train wreck.
---
same
---
Dwight made the right choice
---
Now please downvote me
---
I honestly need this in the game now.
---
5/7, would get blink-sashed in a Foggy otherworld while berating Dwight for hidding in a locker &amp; Claudette looks on &amp; laughs at my demise...
---
They literally said "unforeseen circumstances." It doesn't matter who you are, these things happen. Their only mistake here was announcing the date for the halloween event to be today. You give people a date and when something like this happens they go crazy and start acting entitled as fuck. See: people on the forums "demanding" the double BP event as compensation, or even that they give us a full extra cosmetic set from the event to make up for the delay.
---
Yes, because it's me and not everyone else who is throwing the tantrum. Very well deduced Sherlock, definitely not looking at this forum through some rose-tinted glasses.
---
Imagine losing to a 4 man no mither squad.  
---
Just use your regular M1 bruh
---
Well that’s your opinion. And who is this another person you are referring to? If it’s Jon Rob, then I agree: his songs are very good! But so are Mr Envy’s songs IMO.
---
I understand the mentality, it's in the game im allowed to use. You absolutely are, don't let anyone tell you that you can't use these perks/add one. But don't talk about balance like "it's in the game so it's perfectly fine" and "the other side is more op" It looks hypocritical.
---
That's actually a great price idea, I'll talk to devs 😂
---
I understand being upset. It's human to be upset.
---
I don't understand adults spamming twitter with "ffs BHVR makes me wanna die" memes and acting like the world is ending.
---
If I wasn’t broke I would gild you so fucking hard right now. Hit the nail on the head for greedy bhvr.
---
It’s just how matchmaking is right now, the devs are working on dedicated servers though
---
Seems Myers ate her "sister" instead of killing her.
---
I can't understand all the hate for "The Game". I mean, it's literally the most consistent map in the whole game. It'll probably be the only competitive map in DBD for that reason.
---
It would be quite unfair if the killer had to chase you through a loop just for 1 hit then catch back up to you and chase you through another loop for god knows how long just for the down and then after all that have to worry about you wiggling out
---
Where’s the template from?
---
It just depends on the time of day and where you live. For me, I live on the US West coast and can typically find matches almost instantly at night, but in the morning it takes a while, up to 6 or 7 minutes. Usually it’s only 3 or so minutes of waiting for me though.
---
That would be dope, but two things. 
---
1. It’s owned by Disney so that’s a big property 
---
2.  Jack doesn’t kill so how could he be properly represented in the game
---
I'm an adult female. Who didnt feel attacked by not having bloodhunts. Once again, back in the day, there used to be monthly bloodhunts with challenges attached to them. We didnt hit the outrageous challenge, and the monthly bloodhunts stopped.  I cant remember the challenge but it was tied into killers hooking a god awful amount of survivors. 
---
     I quite enjoyed the bloodhunts, they brought the community together, and the devs were much more open and honest back in those days. 
---
  If you still think I'm feeling attacked by the devs then this post is going over your head. I've tried to ELI5 for you. I'm sorry if you cant discern tone from text, but in no way was my OP frantic or bitchy. You on the other hand have been quite rude. To a complete stranger at that. Find a hobby.
---
Where's Daddy Trapper?
---
It depends on your rank and what time of day you're playing I guess.  
---
it takes longer than it does survivor side because for every killer lobby there needs to be 4 survivors queuing up.
---
The trick is that it’s such a bad spot that nobody will look for it there and it will never be found!
---
Jokes aside that would probably be the case if you were playing with rank 20s because they’d be too scared to venture out into the open
---
I just bought legion. With the shards and I tester not buying plague
---
The smoking splinter is supposed to be retired
---
they are completely unfair to killers. but yeah you're right. the only thing that matters is if **you** have fun. fuck everyone else
---
The developers said that they’d NEVER make a killer that disguises into survivors
---
Ill be back with my legion cosplay
---
I mean those are more than likely delayed also since they're in the patch.
---
I think you missed the part where everyone *in my stack* was rank 8, with the killer being rank 5, leaving that one random survivor joining in as rank 20.
---
okay so you don't understand what second chances are. not surprised at all
---
He's not been sprinting around much... And it shows.
---
holy fuck i touched a nerve lmfao
---
IMO just ignore them. Those kinds of people are only good at insulting others. I know that it's sad and annoying when everybody is messaging you just to say stupid stuffs like "gg ez baby killer", "broken character" or "tunneling/camping bitch"; they can just only badmouth at you because they have no one else to blame when they lost, or they're too full of themselves and thinks that they're better than any killer when they won. I don't play this game, but I also play other PvP games and sometimes I have to face those ridiculous toxicity too. Letting them say what they want to might be the best option, since you can't have enough time to reply to everyone, they will just going to have more reasons to become a toxic whore to you. Or if you're feeling too stressed because of all those things, you can go and try to play other games that's not PvP (hey let's play FGO with me). Don't know if this help you, but hope you'll meet better people
---
I do it to say that it’s all clear. Idk if others understand that tho.
---
That's not just my opinion. Obviously. You've got 4 upvotes on your post in 10 hours. 🤷‍♂️
---
Depends on what killer you're going against. Billy and Bubba and Demo are pretty bad but say a Ghostface with Nurse's is literally the most broken shit ever.
---
oh no
---
Bro I wasn't even talking about you, if you feel alluded that's your problem.
---
Plz no
---
Jokes on you I play claudette
---
yeah but this is still 50% of the power
---
I thought it was weird that we were supposedly getting another blood hunt so soon after the last one. Now it makes sense.
---
Absolutely AWESOME!  You're now an OP killer.  Hahaha
---
It’s horrible. I’m done playing personally until they fix it. It wouldn’t be so bad to wait 20-30 minutes for a match if I didn’t constantly get into an unfun match vs a facecamping or tunneling killer or a killer just standing there to derank or have terrible teammates or have a killer with shitty internet. If I get into matches quick and that happens then oh well. But waiting forever for an unfun game yeah I’m done with that.
---
WHAT the FUCK
---
It is. In my scenario where I hook 2 people that means there are 2 survivors not on a hook. That's a 50 percent chance the survivor I find has DS. DS still has to problem it's always had. When one player has it you have to assume everyone does. It purposefully messes with killer information. If it didn't work on grabs (like BT) it'd be fine, but as it is it's 60 seconds of God mode where the killer can't interact with you at all.
---
It must he hard to 
---
*breath* 
---
In there
---
DCs
---
the ability to hard counter noed does not mean it isn't a second chance perk. the only thing it actually does is give killers who could not down and hook survivors a much easier time to down and hook survivors after the game is essentially over. if you actually want to use the logic you proposed then there isn't a single second chance perk in the game because they all have some kind of counter. if that's actually the position you want to take, fine. it's your prerogative and i won't bother replying if you do because you cant reason someone out of something they didnt reason themselves into
---
what killer failures does STBF make up for? because that's the idea behind what we call second chance perks - that they make up for a particular failure
---
That's some exorcist shit right there!
---
nah this just what the game should tell you but doesn't in the tutorial
---
And the killer is also facing four survivors that they have to control and pressure all game, with essentially three perks until the gates are powered. Not to mention the fact that if the survivors actually did the fucking dull totems NOED never procs anyways. Acting like survivors dont control this game is hilarious, they just dont want to deviate from their Adrenaline/DH/DS/BT builds to stop things like NOED. So they bitch and moan until whatever outrage of the month gets nerfed and is no longer an issue.
---
Meanwhile, when I play solo survivor NOED never procs.
---

---
Been playing since the start of 2017
---
&gt; anybody who doesn’t play this game would think its unplayable with the way reddit describes it.
---
Agreed. My tolerance for shit like this is higher because I played Elite Dangerous for years. With how people are talking about this game you'd think BHVR just released an update like the September update for Elite. That update was supposed to just do two things. Add a new currency to the game and update the tutorial. Thats it. Nothing really new. Somehow the devs broke literally every single aspect of the game. That isn't hyperbole. I really mean they broke everything. Every function was busted in some way or another, and many of them still are most of the way into October. That happened at the same time they added a mobile-game style currency to the game with a big advertisement for buying it in a game that is supposed to be "immersive". Its what finally got me to quit.
---
In comparison BHVR delaying an update doesn't seem so bad.
---
Everyone is technically a victim to the entity
---
Mother daughter ring isn't even a downside if you have a good headset on top of the fact she has collision with survivors while she's phasing. You can pinpoint exactly where they're at as long as you originally had line of sight on them before you phased.
---
Generally across both consoles there is an apporval process that occurs every month or so. Because of this the devs do not want to waste time uploading builds to the console versions that more than likely will become outdated in the time span in takes for approval to be done. On pc these builds can be quickly be pushed because the approval process is almost instant.  
---
I wouldn't say it's not because the devs don't want to give consoles test builds but rather they can't thanks to their approval processes work.
---
For 100% of the power, you need no mither, unbreakable, tenacity, and deliverance.  Hop right off the ground or the hook, doesn’t matter.
---
Demogorgon is class pet and you can't change my mind
---
It was supposed to be but it got postponed the day before it was said to be out. I don’t know about you but I’m extremely disappointed.
---
Tbh your right for two reasons. 
---
1. Getting the rights for the character(s) would be hella hard. 
---
2. The shows just to old from 65 the chance of them adding a show that old is more then impossible.
---
Ok so then this post is pointless because of our conversation? **DAMN ILL TAKE YOU UP ON THAT, NO SECOND CHANCE PERKS IT IS :D**
---
Wait, teammates, that's weird. Whenever I play all I see are  WGLF tokens.
---
Doing gens isn't genrushing. Three gens popping on opposite corners of the map after you down the first guy and a fourth popping on the way to the closest one after you hook him is.
---
69 upvotes... perfect
---
BHVR probably doesn’t want to give away perks for free. They like making people buy killers to unlock them.
---
yeah, this is what i expected. you don't actually have the capability to explain how those two perks are second chance so instead you assumed an entirely illogical position to break away from the responsibility of explaining and understanding the things you yourself say
---
Huntress with iron maiden = ez baby Dwight kills
---
A disgrace to ace mains
---
pig is cute
---
well im console aswell
---
It punishes campers or tunnelers. The rare chance it activates the killer has an absurd amount of pressure and again the killer fucked up by not slugging. 
---
Both perks are perfect right now
---
I added something else to the comment check it out.
---
1. 2 of her addons are OP, Prayer Beads and Father-Daughter Glasses.
---
2. She, along with Nurse, are the only two viable Killers against all the stuff that survivors can bring, Decisive Strike, Dead Hard, insta heals etc. 
---
Are the killers made to not have a chance?
---
Against actually good Red Ranks all Killers are shit on except those two, is that okay yeah?
---
You clearly want it to be a bully simulator, why is this?
---
The only thing I feel sorry for, is the other survivors in your games, because you ruin both the Killers' and their game. You sound like a very nice enjoyable person.
---
Relax my guy it’s all for fun
---
It’s like dropping a pallet on a Michael Myers in the game, but instead it’s a dude named Micheal in a warehouse
---
What a shitty entitled gamer mindset to have. Fucking gross.
---
When your dog has something in its mouth and you say drop it.
---
I only tunnel as the legion if someone tebagged me into a chase. Dicks get tunneled and hooked
---
The artists making the cosmetics have nothing to do with the people who are working on the servers or fixing bugs.
---
That being said, releasing the cosmetics for money but delaying or cancelling the event that goes with them is kind of scummy.
---
I think what annoys me more is that the update will still likely be a buggy mess anyway despite the delays
---
Holy fuck I touched a nerve.
---
&gt; Also STBFL takes up your mistake of hitting someone you didn’t wanna so you can switch to another target much much faster :).
---
good god this is batshit insane
---
It would keep my hope alive of a possessed hand cosmetic that will move erratically when not being used.
---
Gotcha. I was making sure I wasn’t missing something.
---
I can't imagine the ones who are cool with everything like Ghostface and the Clown are having too bad a time
---
Lol it's supposed to mean the opposite 😂
---
I think he'll have trouble doing anything nowadays
---
Are you sure of that? Could have sworn that u/int3r4ct found that the Static Field has the same effect on a Dying survivor as it does on any other.
---
I wonder is this all linked to Fungoose's recent Doctor guide? It makes a few claims about the Doctor that would appear to run contrary to the "Entity Education" video.
---
Download it, open it in paint and crop it.
---
Trapper is a nerd but legion is a jock? Tf?
---
How's SOTs recently?
---
Borrowed time isn't an issue and DS is a one time per match perk so there really is no issue.
---
It's my ~~default dance~~

Poor survivor

Ok this made me laugh... watch the movie thankskilling
---
Different perks, I wouldn’t compare the two but if you had to pick one I’d go Lithe, but Alert is good for keeping information on the killer.
---
And the doctor since he finds everything funny, even getting hit with pallets
---
That sounds perfectly fair to me. You're acting like there is some huge difference between rank 8 and 5. The only real differences are rank 20-15 people and then literally everyone else. The ranking system makes it very easy to rank up and I see tons of trash players at red ranks. 
---
On top of that like I said, you guys have voice comms which is basically like hacking in this game. You get sooo much more info that can speed up doing gens that normal people wouldn't have. If the game gave you some low ranked killer, it'd just be a one sided stomp
---

A lot of people sort by new and will gain traction on it's own pretty quickly. 
---
His video views don't really mean shit to me since he took an idea that someone had and that someone had spent a lot of time composing the song rather than slapping a bunch of irritating sounds into an editor in 5 minutes and calling it a song which takes away from the original composer of actual good content all just for the sake of 5 minutes of internet fame.
---
The fact is that the game needs some changes to keep it interesting and fresh and this envy kid is slapping together really bad music literally in 5 minutes in order to capitalize on the need for new changes to the game because it's stale. Anything new is better than the boring stale shit this game has become.
---
To be fair he may had not seen the movie yet
---
Yo you've seen Hxy's girlfriend right? Lol
---
I saw this recommended before but Chris shouldn't be the killer. It should be The Walrider and that can be his name in game too
---
90% thinking a troll but anyway
---
&gt;its not like head on
---
Head on is still a really bad perk, its not as buggy as before but still you essentialy have to do a risky play and become exhausted while doing so
---
 &gt;decisive strike
---
Ds only triggers if you tunnel a guy off hook
---
&gt;insta heals
---
They are OP and are completley broken which is why they are being removed, new instaheals arent much better but they have "some" counterplay for a very rare addon. 
---
Prayer beads removes spirits one piece of counterplay, its beyond broken and needs removing, and i dont understand anyone who stays in a match against it.
---
what have you brought on this cursed land
---
I love that as soon as I hear her humming j start humming along
---
Do you have a single fact to back that up?
---
I play on ultra also
---
“Holy fuck, frank! You knocked him out!”
---
Sometimes I still hear it after the game...
---
What are you talking about, the hitboxes are fine yes you might be in an corner of a map and get hit from a huntress who threw their hatchet at the wall in the opposite corner but thats fine, nothing wrong here move along.
---
Survivors who use farm offerings go straight to heck
---
"These darn hooligans again! Get off my lawn you damn kids!"
---
Lot of easy-to-follow tutorials for it, though. Personally I found it to be worth the time - and "profitable", since it's given me an additional sideline for fixing people's photos, undemanding graphic design tasks, and so on.
---
Nice mental gymnastics. How about this simple argument. They're both fucking crutch perks. If you were able to finish the gens with 3 perks then you didn't need adrenaline to win. It's just a "win more" crutch at that point. If you have 4 survivors alive with NOED, you're too shit to be at the rank you are at, and if you get a 4k before it activates you didn't even need it.
---
Both perks are garbage. People who defend then are people who can't escape/4K without them. Period. They need to be reworked or removed.
---
Ha funny xd loloool. Original such wow
---
Highly doubt it. Survivors will see you camping, even if you're halfway across the map.
---
Again the problem is it punishes killers who have pressure and it's not rare that that happens. Again the problem is that if you're about to be hit you can just run in a locker and be immune to slugging. At that point the killer either waits outside the locker to get inner strength/head on'd, waits it out and loses all pressure, or let's them go and they still have it next time they get hooked with no penalty.
---
Theres no such thing as a stable update when they come out with an update. So either way we lose. Just give us the event to make the bug infested game worth playing for a few weeks.
---
the text pop-ups
---
I feel like each Legion members should be a different thing.
---
Also considering Frank has a varsity jacket along with it's description I'm pretty sure it's confirmed that he is a jock or at least was one.
---
Susie would be either Theatre kid or the nerd
---
Julie would be a popular or preppy girl
---
Joey would probably just slip into either the weird kid or jock
---
I feel sorry for anyone that gets shipped with Ash. He has a bad track record with girlfriends. They usually end up dead.
---
3) When the devs release a buggy update delayed
---
This game was born toxic. It’s obscure to think that survivors or killers cant be toxic…
---
Green Carburator Tuning Guide and Yellow Bulb is the insta saw add on build, that's the strongest one IMO  
---
Together they stack and make your chainsaw charge very very short.
---
Again thats on you for tunneling, if survivors go out of their way for you to get hit by DS you know they dont have it later. Its not common enough to justify changing the perk in anyway. 
---
The vast majority of DS hits are due to camping tunneling killers and the mere fact it exsists promotes killers not to tunnel and is very good for the health of the game
---
Lol
---
Not 100%
---
Unforseen usually means something unexpected has occured. It might be somethi g highly personal. Dont take out the frustration of the game onto the devs that have a smallish team than most other triple A developera
---
I get the Demogorgon charge, Nurse blink, Ghostface lean, and Trapper traps. I am a baby killer and do not like that role other than to get more perspective on what the killer sees.
---
Upvoted because it's not another Legion/Pig
---
yep, hes now consistent with the other undetectable killers. Bit of a nerf I think cos scratched mirrors worked well cos spine chill didnt work but the bonus is that he has 0 terror radius while tier 1.
---
I think they technically meant the spirit and plague didn't kill anybody while Hag and huntress.
---
Also I wouldn't define huntress victim because she has a large intentional body count
---
everyone has their own opinion about this, i wrote down mine
---
I’m sorry if u have to play against these type of players. 
---
Then it seems like that I’m just luckier or idk tbh, but tgese are my experiences (btw i play on ps4)
---
More stable? Lol
---
Isnt it like a lore thing though where the Entity tortured and fucked with all of the killers to make them more easily influenced and manipulated? Iirc the Entity kinda breaks and twists all the killers into being more monstrous than they were.
---
It's a halogen, as in the light bulb.  David King is a hooligan, as in the trouble making arsehole.
---
He's 16, and would laugh his ass off at how triggered you are.
---
Fair enough, I'm just saying that this would be nice if they did something like that. Besides, I'm sure they could manage at least one perk for both survivers and killers between each chapter
---
loltriggered
---
yikes
---
That's stupid. How about they do something that multiplayer games have done for goddamn decades: rank decay. You don't play, you rank decays down to a certain level. Like from 1 to 8, and 8 to 15. But if you've ever been rank 1 it can't decay lower than 8. The reset is stupid and just makes new players get wrecked.
---
Oh no anti tunnel perks are used by survivors. 😱😱😱 Anti tunnel perks and a mildly annoying addon are so OP. Better make a post to cry about it.
---
Lol ships that i find amusing and fun but knowing someone people they’ll ignore it and call it cringe
---
Is it possible to hide the chat and leave it hidden for the next games ? I’m tired of those useless messages.
---
thanks fam &lt;3
---
No but people who camp the hook seem to think it is.
---
Rank decay is better than resets.
---
lowest effort meme I've seen today
---
So what I enjoy playing spirit and now im toxic?
---
OP is lying. She strangled a dude and called his last breath.
---
It's my fault for tunneling after hooking 2 people? I'm tunneling the whole team I guess.
---
I think that's why I love it. I love just creating different builds and I have two or three different no mother builds that I love using.
---
I don’t understand how some people assume that just bc they release it later it’s going to be better. I mean come on, guys lmao
---
NO, at one point it was collect nectar and kys on hook.
---
Not gonna lie I really thought this was a 4k render before I read the caption.
---
What does sfw mean
---
Me when I thought it was fine to play with two rank  17s and an 18 🤡
---
A hoverboard hidden under the dress would be pretty cool
---
the match needs one killer and four survivors
---
That's why
---
For it to activate you need to someone to have just been unhooked, unhook someone and then hide in a locker. Thats not common enough a situation to justify changing the perk in anyway.
---
Offer the killer your lunchbox to satisfy their hunger, and they might just let you live!
---
I beg to differ.
---
I’d consider Doc one of my mains along side GF and Freddy. Docs powerful when you time your shocks correctly, Essentially ending a chase quickly, Even if you can’t catch someone you can still get them to Tier 3 Madness to prevent them from Doing gens or healing themselves for around 12 - 13 seconds. I’m at red and I’ve been chilling there with Doc for a while now
---
for me if they dont want to release the new update it must be dummy broken. more broken and more bugs than their normal updates so im kinda glad they held it back
---
And that was a primary gripe against Gun Media with regards to F13 - but there is a balance - F13 was severely too quiet and BHVR is being severely too loud.  Didn't say promise nothing - just promise less and exceed the expectations when something does come out.  Doesn't take much to handle this better than they are.
---
I almost always spare a survivor if they offer me up something spicy, especially a flashlight
---
Wish I could get this cocksucker off my xbox dashboard.
---
That’s the kind of Spirit I go against when I just want to plunder. Life do be rough as a Plunderer
---
Angry pig noises
---
if you don’t respond with something *racist/or a swear word* then u shouldn’t have to worry about being reported.
---
if they still report u though, then they have a higher chance to be the ones who get suspended or something.
---
Usually because they're all across the map and don't realize that while thinking the *next* guy will save you. 
---
Next thing you know you've been struggling for 45 seconds, hoping that someone will break their terror radius paralysis to finally make a move from 20m away. Your final 5 seconds are spent watching as someone now hopelessly sprints to you, deeming it safe because another guy got hit, before rising slowly into the sky.
---
Your game is over, two minutes into the game because you started cleansing a dull totem and assumed the killer wouldn't search an area with zero gens.
---
Only the ones who don't want to serve. It's easy to tell who was tortured and who wasn't because the ones who were tortured still have severe wounds. For example, Plague is still half rotted and Rin is just a bunch of floating body parts. On the other hand, characters like Ghostface and Clown and are completely intact and aren't in pain, plus they have some signs of a deeper connection to the Entity than others, especially in the description of their perks which states a deep connection (Thrilling Tremors and Bamboozle of the top of my head, respectively) to the Entity.
---
Not longer, it would be the same amount of days, just later wouldn't it?
---
Some of them were all too eager to satisfy that craving
---
I as a piggy, boop the snoot, you get hooked.
---
The problem isn’t the topic but the over-saturation of this topic. We get it, toxic survivors are dickheads, however, we don’t need 272 memes about it in a week.
---
&gt; here's how we can keep Spirit from being better than Nurse!
---
Well, that is kind of the point of delaying it.
---
SWF = Survive with Friends
---
who are the people between plague and spirit
---
They said something about the blood point economy which was dumb considering new players have an epic journey if they want to p3 all characters. I personally like to put points into both killer and survivors until they have everything. It's a journey man. I'm not even close because I played on my husband's account for months trying to catch him up so I wouldnt hear him bitching about me being so ahead of him. Lol I had 1.5 years of gameplay before he joined me. Bloodhunts to me are like Christmas morning, or Halloween night when I used to dump all my candy and pick out the chocolate for my mom and hoard the smarties to play poker with my sister.
---
Why tf haven't they added the character icons next to the names on other platforms
---
No doubt. Bugs are a feature in this game.
---
Assert dominance
---
Are you sure that this game isn't called dead by friendship? Cause if I'm gonna be honest, in the past 2 months I've had maybe 5 escapes total just to make sure my friends do get out and get their pips that they care so much about for whatever reason. I still get a single pip on most games but the majority I only get a safety pip because red rank life sucks if you don't escape. No escape = no pip. 3 gens worth of progress, 2 4 minute long chases and 3 safe unhooks = safety pip. We're all red ranks btw.
---
I was so happy my day off lined up for this
---
I was even avoiding playing for a week so I could grind my ass off today but noooo
---
I know right
---
Honestly
---
Good one, I didn’t have it but I’m gonna try it out in a custom tonight!

---
funniest thing I've seen all day
---
Before that there was the "always works no matter what flashlight" that they fixed in two days, terror radius and music errors.  Infinite tinkerer.  And hell - if you played the PTB you prob saw how a specific add-on made the nurse choppy and unplayable with an infinite hook progress bar.
---
Or I’ll start a new match and keep thinking I hear it even though she’s not the killer.
---
See but at the same time, with some of Clown's skins, I'd would be kinda surprising if he wasnt in pain. Granted cosmetics dont really mean much for canon lore, but idk, Clown'a gut looks like it's got some rot and stuff going on. He has maggots crawling around with his Santa skin. From what I recall though, both Hag and Spirit took the Entity's offer to get revenge on the people who caused their deaths, and serving was part of that bargain. I've always took it as those wounds were remnants of their actual lives, bot additional ones caused by the entitity.

You do realize that the spirit cant see you in phase and you can still se grass and crows go off
---
Thats just people doing the only objective they have, what else are they supposed to be doing, just walking around waiting to get downed?
---
Its an issue with the game's gen speed, but it has nothing to do with the players or as a strategy. Even if the gen speed was increased to 3 minutes each and people popped them all at exactly 3 minutes, people would still complain that its gen rushing
---
Red-green colourblind idiot here. Please, add a colourblind option. I hate losing survivors because I can't really track... especially on Coldwind...
---
Oh I know, but the Entity has always given me like Wishmaster kind of vibes, that like even the killers got more than they bargained for ya know?
---
Luckily for Myers at tier 1 Spine Chill won’t activate
---
Oh that’s the legion unmasked in order from spirit to plague it’s Frank, Julie, Joey &amp; Susie
---
This is so sad 
---
*Can we buff legion?*
---
Remember when they released an update, to fix bugs but it just created more broken shit so they rolled another mini update to remove what the prev update was 
---
Think it was during the legion or plague ch
---
As a perk it’s fun to play and there’s a lot of interesting builds.  The issues that I finally realized is that most killers will focus you first if you run no mither, because you’re an easy target and they can tell right away.  You’ll also never get left on the ground because again, the killer knows you’re running no mither, so it loses some of its advantages
---
sneak 100
---
illusion 100
---
Correct, and if we get them to use, understand, and apply Make Your Choice, they should learn that that's bad gameplay.
---
And before anyone says bad for who, bad for the Killer. A Camping Killer is a killer nott applying Gen Pressure, and a killer taht doesn't apply gen pressure is a killer that's going to lose.
---
I'm sorry I dont remember asking you for your toxic comment
---
Boop her on the snoot!
---
The meme doesn't say a stable update, it says a MORE stable update.
---
It sucks that a *horror game* waits until the end of the month in October to run a Halloween event.
---
Yes unforeseen "Usually" means something unexpected.  At the same time - ALL bugs are unforeseen or they would never have made it to release. You seem to think BHVR is a four man team operating in a garage somewhere.  They had a publisher - they've been making games for over a decade.  They even made a creative gorey slasher once upon a time (Naughty Bear).
---
Three years ago I was like you and defended their missteps - afterall they only expected the game to have a short shelf life and a few hundred concurrent users.  It's been years now - they've hired many capable coders and programmers, they've had years to learn and grow and polish the product.  They aren't new. It isn't their first day.  Eventually accountability is an actual thing.
---
100% agree
---
Perfectly balanced. As all things should be.
---
Same I didn't have school today and now it's gone ): but on the bright side I don't think it'll be a long delay
---
Dude I dont only use prayer beads 😂 and your havent been playing long enough to notice that when she is in phase grass in crows still go off which is a counter play to prayer beads
---
It's also you're location, I find games rather quickly. Even when this sub was flooded with people complaining about waiting for hours, I'd get games within minutes.

Lmao perfect
---
Clown might be a bit debatable with the skins but yeah it's hard to apply canon to cosmetics, it could just be that he's a disgusting bastard. As for Hag and Spirit though, I'd look at it a lot like Wraith, they were good people but in the moment they became violent and killed. Killing out of anger isn't the same as doing it for sport like the Entity wants. Regret for a hasty action is a very real thing and in situations like those, they don't really have the mental clarity to think through the deal they're making.
---
&gt;Get two flashlight saves in one game
---
fuuuuck
---
That’s the piece of the puzzle I knew I was forgetting!
---
Although this build essentially makes you the bait for the killer, so I’d hope you’re in a SWF or get good matchmaking so your teammates run gens.
---
Have your friend run saboteur for bonus points and killer rage.  Take all the hooks to 99%, then drop whichever ones are near the killer
---
Dafuq and I looking at?
---
Amazing!
---
Yesterday I had this happen to me for the first time. It was just me and one other solo queue left alive during endgame and pig was about to get me . I booped the snoot and put down my toolbox and she let me go. Picked the toolbox back up, used inner strength, and left
---
Legit question, why isn't it though?
---
End game, if you use corruption, you could basically be like iri head Huntress and just start quick slugging people, right?
---
How about no you console peasant
---
Get BHVR´ed
---
I think I've died to every legion I've ever played against. 😔
---
At least they will be fix 1% bug lol
---
so funny! and sad at the same time ):
---
time to fucking DC from halloween OP NURSE GOTTA COME IN HERE BEING BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER ONES :3
---
jk nice

I still have fun playing them, tho. Especially when they are all together and I start the frenzy and hit all of them it’s hilarious.

r/fuckfuckthirdsub
---
Tysm 🤩 I used acrylic paint and I took a bit to fix minor things but the design of the characters are simple since there isn’t any shading or complicated shapes. But ty I appreciate it
---
The whole point of my comments were that there should never be someone who is solo queueing into a game where everyone is leagues ahead of them.
---
Even pc players got to replace the battery in their wireless mouse peasant

Did you randomly assign them?

And here we see the baby Dwight in its natural habitat the matchmaking pool.

I hate 99ing doors. Just open and let people know they are open. I can not count how many times I've been in chase running towards a door and it's shut and at 99 and I go down and die anyway. I think 99 them if you are on comms, but if you're a solo Survivor... just open it.
---
I did this once bu at the end i only get a 3 kill and 15000 blood points, because the insta mori I wasn't able to slug the 3rd person and the last one get the hatch. So im never doing this again
---
So much for sprint burst...
---
Ah yes
---
seems people forgot they literally had a power outage, they probably lost stuff they worked on lmao. its pretty dumb how this community switches from hating the devs to liking them every other week
---
Gif us double bp event tomorrow

Maybe we could finally get a Wendigo killer?

Tysm 😄

I was never quite certain how Discordance worked at far as the yellow aura went. Thanks for this post.

Look at him and tell me it’s not 
---
That’s why he walks instead of running. He’s encumbered.
---
*Me across the map doing a gen*: "Why is everybody DCing?!"
---
I don’t know what the power would be, but it would look like the hag
---
Rin is nerd, Ghostface "Danny" "Jed" "Ghostface" Danny "Jed" Johnson "Olsen" is jock
---
*What is that melody?*
---
Oh fuck, I had this glitch happen to me! I was a Spirit and cornered a Meg in a room. She speed-crawled into a wall and completely bugged out (I got stuck in the animation for a solid few seconds when trying to pick her up) and ended up DCing (so I assume she was stuck in the wall and couldn't move). I suspect it might be from trying to Dead Hard or Spring Burst or another similar perk at a certain time right before or during the killer's hit.
---
I need this show. Where is it?
---
I'd imagine a mix of Hag and Demo, but with a more skull/Native American/forest theme.
---
Ghostface, Pig, or Freddy
---
Add ons that change a killer's power that drastically are different. I see no reason why Demo's changed red add on makes it take longer for him to teleport when all it does is make him undetectable longer.
---
We could play bug bingo, where the center is a random trapper bug that doesn't make sense.
---
99ing doors gives survivors more time to make it to the exit gates, if the door is opened then someone is hooked, if the killer has Blood Warden then the exit will be blocked for for a limited time, making it harder for everyone to escape. It’s just better to 99 a gate and wait for everyone to show up, or at least open it *after* someone has been hooked. 
---
99ing gens can be done to prevent a 3 gen strat from the killer and to prevent NOED from activating. Some people will also 99 a gen, then heal in case the killer has perks like Bitter Murmur or Rancor, which reveals people’s location when a generator is completed.
---
I'm fine with both playstyles, but it annoys the fuck out of me that "don't cleanse" is taken as the gospel truth when the reality is that it's much more dependent on the circumstances of the match. (How many gens are done, will cleansing force the Plague to go to a dead zone to power-up, how good is everyone at running the killer, etc.)
---
What I’m saying is they gotta do what they gotta do. If they have to delay it so it works then so be it. Never said I was happy about
---
About the first part: Really? I didn’t know that, sorry! I haven’t been very active in dbd subreddits or anywhere else for that matter, because I got a little bored. I only recently started getting YT video recommendations about custom dbd songs,  so I listened to them and they were indeed good. It’s good that Jon made it through to the developers. 
---
My whole point was just that I found envy’s soundtracks cool, they fit well to dbd’s fast action-packed style. But still. If he just spams and tries to get fame partly from other people’s success, it sucks. No respect for that. 
---
I’m glad we can talk about these things peacefully and rationally, right? :)
---
Maybe a channeling based teleport or speed buff for hunting?
---
I don't get it x(
---
Definitely  episode 17 season 1 The Fever it makes the most sense for a killer
---
I’m down for that lol.
---
That end laugh.. whoever made that noise is the next killer
---
I never understand when killers trap the Ruin, especially Freddy, because it makes it much easier to find (Freddy's are the most visible).
---
If you plan on playing killer, get the Leatherface DLC for one of his perks (BBQ and Chili) as it reduces the grind for leveling up your characters by a lot, however Leatherface isnt a good killer.
---
Myers is a really good killer thats easy to play as and is pretty beginner friendly, while Ghostface is the more "advanced" version of him (arguable to be either worse or better than Myers, but I really like him)
---
Spirit (Shattered Bloodlines) is considered the best killer (tier list wise) on console and she has one of the current meta perks in the game (Spirits Fury).
---
I wouldnt worry too much about the meta but I would definitely get Leatherface simply for his perk and then get one that looks interesting to you (I recommend Myers for beginners, but Ghostface is my personal favorite DLC killer). Maybe look up some gameplay videos of the ones youre interested in.
---
I will say that Leatherface and Ghostface DONT come with a survivor since theyre smaller DLCs, so if youre planning on playing survivor, I'd get Myers DLC since it comes with Laurie who has one of the best survivor perks.
---
I typed a lot, but you should get the idea.
---
think positive. you can keep counting and be in anticipation for even longer!
---
I posted this in another thread but this is really becoming a problem I can’t defend anymore:
---
&gt; BHVR has repeatedly failed to deliver on promises and basic expectations in the three years I have played this game. I love them and the game to death but I often question decisions and their ability. I also understand there is leeway with them being a much smaller company then Ubi, EA, Activision, CDPR, and so on. But with this being their flagship game, the amount of broken promises (and patches) is inexcusable at this point. This is a three year old game that announced they’d be getting dedicated servers at E3, had that delayed, cancelled events to work on said servers, delayed the servers, and now can’t even deliver on arguably the best (RESKINNED) holiday event for the game, and happens on the same day every year.
---
&gt;That is insane.
---
&gt;Again, I love this game to bits, and the dev team seem like good people who genuinely want this game to succeed further on. But if they want that, they HAVE to be better. Dead by Daylight still feels like a beta, after three years and tons of DLC.
---
Also, Thank, Gold, kind stranger, etc.
---
Girl you're adding the cayenne, I'm adding the ground beef, pretty soon we're going to have some tasty chili.
---
Doctor is the worst on the game
---
I'd pay for it
---
Where did you hear that we're getting it later today?
---
On what Peanits said, I love this game but good god, we wouldn't have to "get our hopes up" if you guys announced shit before 2 days before its release date. Have some foresight damnit. Literally, everyone was assuming both the midchapter and the event were coming today and they make no damn attempt to clarify (EVEN AFTER HAVING A WHOLE LIVESTREAM FOR THE MIDCHAPTER) until the last possible moment when they literally have to.
---
This whole thing has murdered my hype for the midchapter update. Handled so poorly by everyone involved. Just talk to your community, that's what community managers are for, if you see a ton of people thinking that a thing is coming out at a certain time, maybe something should be said? IDK just a thought.
---
That's Not really a positive. Also can't count the days when they don't give us any eta
---
Playing devils advocate...
---
We already have a ton of perks to unlock as is.  From what I understand it takes around 3,000 hours to P3 and unlock all perks.
---
The bigger issue is if they are pushing out perks we’re going to get a bunch more junk perks filling our webs along with even more balancing issues for the devs to keep up with.
---
With that being said, the more we have to work with the better imo.
---
PWYF, NOED, RUIN, DYING LIGHT, bloodwarden, enduring-spirit fury, bamboozled. omg so many you know. maybe you need play better lmao  
---
btw DS + BT was useless if you not camp + tunnel, Instaheal? gonna removed soon.
---
It's not like the delay is going to fix the bugs
---
Why's he just standing there? DUDE!! RUN!!
---
Definitely an instant disconnect for me lol
---
Originally we was supposed to get it today with the rift but seeing everyone bitching i guess something happened i dont keep up with.
---
Sad goat noises*
---
Yea that shouldn’t even be a spawn location for any totem. That’s just really bad.
---
Welcome to the fog!!
---
It was a joke you 4head

Welcome! Don't let the obviously toxic AF idiots bring you down since most people in my experience are good or decent at least
---

---
\*Here comes the Trapper\~\*
---
I feel like different killers should have different ranks or some adjustment, bc playing each one is so different compared to survivors mostly playing the same
---
I really really should have. I fell into the sunk cost fallacy with my time when it would have been better in every way to just DC when i realized what they were doing.
---
Killer: BLYAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!
---
I do know how software development works. Of course there are bugs. But it’s a job. There are deadlines. You need to push it back, okay. Don’t tell the client 12 hours before the deadline. 
---
Also, just because programming is difficult does not excuse delays. It’s nice that they delayed rather than release a buggy product, but that doesn’t shield them from having not made deadlines anyways.
---
My mocks are next week and it's half term this week so iam pretty pissed rn
---
How do I make my User Flair custom? I edit it but it always gets back to what it was
---
plus if you google "Withering Blight event" it seems to suggest they're wasting the chance to return the great flowers from last year, despite that being the most satisfying thing a survivor could do in the entire life of the game: to get something without skill checks. it was fun looking for the glowing orange flowers and sucking them dry for cosmetics. it's such a waste if they get rid of that this year. no need for special generators. the flowers were where it was at. who cares about escaping. i gladly do the flowers and then get killed (you cant lose some of it if u complete a vial, so it would usually take me 2 matches to finish 1 vial).
---
I think what he's getting at is that they said "We didn't say it was coming out at any point".
---
Those are fucking sick. 👏
---
Lol xbox
---
Then don't tunnel lol
---
I’m also wondering about that but i think yes
---
I don'tplay Spirit (unless I get daily) and play Nurse not often.
---
I was talking about Huntress and Tier 1 Myers
---
The tweet mentioned delaying the Withering Blight event, not the Archives.
---
God people glorify devs at weird times. The fact that Star Citizen hasn’t been released in 7 years does not have anything to do with the fact that BHVR should be better at communicating internally and externally on plausible deadlines and delays.
---
Withering blight was coming alongside the archives, so it makes sense they're both delayed
---
You also might want to check what "turn right" is set to in the keyboard layout for Killers. Maybe something is set wrong.
---
Many people set "turn left" and "turn right" to Q and E because it is easier to control him with the keyboard during the sprint.
---
Me when I see Michael.
---
Before their delay. The update was supposed to come today i literally just said this.
---
Tune plays
---
Oh fuck
---
No one: 
---
Behavior: OMG A KILLER THATS A WALKING JACKPOT MACHINE THATS A GOOD IDEA RIGHT THERE! 
---
Chucky fanbase: OH ARE YOU KIDDING ME
---
99ing a Gen can also come in clutch against Pig, since her trap only activates on gen completion.
---
You'll often see someone get the last gen to 99, wait for the RBTed Survivor to get the trap off, and then pop it.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
---
Looks really good!
---
You can tell this guy only uses prayer beads and never went against it
---
Thats why i get points from my surv chili and bbq n chili killers then only spend points on him
---
You don’t have to purchase the premium rift. You could go through the entire rift on the free track and if you make it to the end then commit to the $10 purchase. That is a lot of cosmetics for $10 and you basically get the next rift free. Reevaluate your stance on the rift after it has been out for a month.
---
This will just encourage more survivors to stay asleep wouldn't it? Once youre asleep, it should feel like Freddy is in control, not the survivor. Besides the survivors aren't "awake" technically. If you watch the 2010 Nightmare on Elm Street, Nancy and Quentin experience micro-naps, seeing hallucinations and altered realities in the real world.
---
So, with all that said: aura reading perks shouldnt work while sleeping, because sleeping is a "disadvantage" to the survivor, not a disadvantage for freddy. 
---
If you were to switch the roles of aura reading perks, people would stay asleep (which is very easy), compared to the need to stay awake to see him and gain an advantage. This not only fits balancing wise, but also canon-wise at the same time. 
---
So basically, if you want to see freddy's aura, you have to EARN it by waking yourself up. Not have it given to you so easily, and throughout the entire match.
---
Love doing this play.
---
Happy irl cake day dude
---
Probably to balance the game since NOED is already a powerful perk. If NOED worked on killers' power like Legion, that would be nutty.
---
Dont blink unless you need to
---
Thank you very much.
---
Seconded
---
I see your point but in this type of game it doesn’t matter if you introduce a dc time out because players still have the option to kill themselves on first hook.
---
Ah justice.
---
So they didn't bother to test the patch until the day before it was to be released? Very professional.
---
Welcome to DBD :)
---
Not too old but after scrolling through 20 different posts to earn karma i finally found the actual picture of their tweet of the delay
---
Well you're entitled. To your opinion.
---
OP COSTUME PLS NERF
---
Took me a minute to figure that out. Way too long. I need more coffee. Nice Trapper! With some wood burning tools this could be taken up to a while new level. My dad used to do wood art like this. Good job! I couldn't do it!
---
I think you're confusing fun with balanced, again. Yes. A lot of the top tier killers are already strong without addons, and the addons just make them stronger. Giving a killer a really strong ability with a downside, and then having an item to remove said downside IS imbalanced.
---
You're correct on it being fun, we usually have a blast with it. 
---
But now you're just being disrespectful and denoting that you don't want to discuss this, you just want your opinion to be heard and fuck the hearsay. I'm proud of you hun. You sure showed me.
---
 is their communication the best? No but they could go absolutely radio silent and we would still be in the same place so be happy with what you get, you dont get to cry and make the devs bend at the knee for you , so until you make a game, and update EVERY SINGLE change i think you need to stop being an entitled little shit.
---
*Swiggity swooty, wooshing back for that Scoopy!*
---
The boys
---
Equip Ruin, NOED, POP and Make your choice and 3 blinks with distance.  Then select a different killer.
---
On a serious note I’d wait for her update and see where she’s at.
---
Thank you!! ☺️
---
On top of corrupt purge not benefitting from Exposed, the general high level play against Plague is to just never cleanse since it's too easy to get sick again and corrupt purge is so powerful.
---
Thanks! Super excited! 😁
---
It wasn’t even relevant to the discussion. The update will probably be out in like 1-3 days, he didn’t have to bring up that he paid for something that’s barely shown progress in 7 years.
---
F man, I actually recently asked for the 28th to get it free... I am now wondering if I sholdn't cancel it it they dont have news from here to friday.
---
But maybe there's another way to get Putrid Serum?
---
Like outside of the Rift?
---
That way the Event could occur before the Archives or Rift.
---
There's so much that could happen and we just can't be sure until either the Event or Archives or both occur.
---
NOED... :)
---
Yup, happens every time. I lost the will to play because of everyone spamming instaheals every single game. Thought I would have some reprieve from this hell today but i guess not.
---
Aha thanks! After years of Overwatch, toxicity is so much more tolerable. I’m too new to even really grasp what’s considered toxic in DBD yet. 😅
---
Me and the boys when not killing
---
Epic
---
I was wondering the same thing lol
---
I love Rolaskatox.
---
i would change it to pokemon red and blue battle theme if found a survivors. gotta catch'em all!
---
agree on parkour, also no exhaustion?  
---
I actually like blood donor, maybe add mangled status or make blood trail bigger?  
---
maybe not pallet shield but you can make a fresh new pallet after getting 2/3 broken pallets
---
Nope only bloodpoints from the hooks and generators this year, they stated that already.
---
Oh, ok!
---
Look at the tiktok handle for more info
---
I actually generally like The Game. It’s just irritating when I get lost trying to figure out how the stairs work.
---
On November Halloween!
---
Sorry to kick you in the nuts with that revelation.
---
Dedicated servers are fine for me. Way better than host connections so far
---
Lol i was just saying to not add the effect to ds stun - learn to accept critisicm dumbass
---
He has to get his pebble activated.
---
Nah, I'm glad.
---
Always glad to know the truth.
---
You do this.... For me???
---
Don't camp the pallet. Go to a corner of the loop where you can hide yourself but keep an eye on all the pathways that lead to you.
---
And don't try juking if you're injured without Iron Will.
---
She's honestly not the strongest killer in the game anymore now that she's heavily restricted on movement. The addon changes were the big problem with her, and it's honestly the biggest problem with most top tier killers. Strong as fuck already, and addons that had no real downside and just made them much stronger.
---
If prayer beads made it so that her power recharged slower, i would be PERFECTLY okay with them. My problem isn't with killers man. It's those damn addons that make the amazing killers, stupid strong.
---
Also, if you're escaping Spirits with just Iron Will, then you aren't playing good spirits. Stridor exists, and is currently one of the most run abilities on Spirit.
---
I'm Michael Myers and I'm here to make it clear 💅
---
I'm not complaining, I'm telling you what "gen rushing" means. It's a deliberately coordinated SWF thing most of the time, not just doing gens.
---
BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury
---
The bottom is the sole survivor when all of em spawn at once
---
Or he got a new microphone?
---
No there are other objectives. Imagine there's swf and they can tell each other where the killer is and to stay on gens or where to go find Ruin when the killer is chasing them. That leads to gen rushing instead of people fearing the killer and hiding more that gives the killer less time. I think swf gen rushing is toxic but without the added info solo gen rushing isn't as toxic since the killer can 3 gen the survivors or break chase to patrol gens. The survivors and killers can be toxic by trying to win as fast as possible or killers can get the most deviousness out of every match and showcase skill by not tunneling and winning chases quickly and letting survivors get 3 hooks, you can 4k or they all escape and it doesn't matter as much as showcasing actual skill in chases but relevant to the game killer will have to slug sometimes and it isnt always toxic. Toxic survivors farm hooks too right in front of hooks and it's not toxic to slug. The survivor has to be fully aware of killer abilities and not getting downed is the point and doing risky plays will get you downed if the killer is camping
---
I main legion currently. I run a solid build and play towards it and I do fine. The goal is to not commit to one chase and constantly have then injured and guessing. I run sloppy, thanat, dying light, and nurses. Most of the time I use the 2 blade addons to increase mending time and just kinda patrol gens and catch people at bad loops/spots.
---
The meters are supposed to stack for every survivor dead meaning that you can see them at a distance without him seeing you.
---
Unfortunately, I've seen a lot of people who do this when the killer is on a chase or faraway. 
---
I've personally never stumbled across a game where someone actively moves to signal a camper. They usually stay still so the camper doesn't leave them and others do the gens.
---
"You, huh, really like swinging that thing around, huh?"
---
Using NOED as Huntress with Iridescent Head Axes
---
I feel like In his older videos he might’ve been more nervous and tried to use a more formal tone of voice but now he uses a more relaxed tone
---
Haha gotcha
---
They did say however they would extend both by the time of the delay, e.g. if it ends up happening next Tuesday instead it will lead to it lasting an extra week when it does go live, so not all hope is lost, as for the chances as free cosmetics.. that's down to playtime.
---
Woah there bud, seems like you're the one who can't handle being told not to tunnel. Keep it civil, Don't start slinging profanities
---
I was going to have a week to play it before leaving on trip. With my luck it will probably start when I leave and I won't get a chance to play it now.
---
I use bbq ruin thrilling tremors and discordance
---
BBQ, Blood Party Streamers, Escape Cake, Survivor Pudding, and We're Gonna Live Forever grant their bonus post trial, so all of your points from the whole match get the boost
---
Whats the name of your game you released?
---
Now that's, Gigabrain
---
Clown fucker
---
You mean DC\*, right?
---
What part of unforseen is cloudy to you?
---
Why? Because they delayed a seasonal event? The game is still fun, go play.
---
You didn't even mention the delay. You just said "It comes out today at 4." Big difference, bud.
---
To be fair, it may be the same rate but it feels slower unless I’m running addons to increase the passive rate. My general rule is to slug T3’s so they become easy tracking devices if it’s the last two survivors. If more people played Doctor when I’m survivor I could test myself but sadly I’m in mid purple again so my killer opposition roster is back to three.
---
Don't be mean hes just a Nurse main
---
The clown or are you calling me that?
---
When i read unforeseen circumstances, my first thought was when g-man says "prepare for unforeseen consequences"
---
That's fair. I have every teachable and am saving my shards for a cosmetic so Shrine is sadly useless for me :/
---
Because at the time as i said I didn't know about the delay you fucking moron.
---
In game there’s an option to report for “rage quitting” so why not use Xbox reports instead since it does literally nothing in game? Those people need to be punished.
---
#boycottBHVR
---
Yeah, I'm not even saying powerful perks (perk combos could happen though), just ones that add something that would be at least something interesting between each big update to keep our interest
---
Yes! I was waiting for that one.
---
To be honest, I don’t think I’ve ever experienced a queue time longer than 3 minutes and that was swf.
---
I love his accent
---
stop making balance suggestions when you don't know basic facts.  spirit phasing does not move grass
---
BT is not a “second chance”
---
Oh for sure, but I also don't like when a Killers/survivors have mechanics/addons that completely negate any counter play that I could have done.
---
Prayer Beads, Black Box, Instaheals, BNP, etc.
---
Thanks for the advice. I usually don’t camp pallets, but I suck at pallet slamming killers and just juking in general. I’m fairly new so I’m still learning.
---
The delay announcement was kind of strangely worded. The new patch was planned to come out along with the event, which was today. The only thing I can think of as to why they worded it as they did, is they recently decided to push back the patch slightly, but were still going to roll out the event today, but problems occured with that due to the event going hand in hand with the rift, so they opted to also push back the event.
---
Lol the clown
---
I side with myself lol. *casket fuckin dies from time warp lol*
---
It would be interesting Billy as a hall monitor, imagine running from him when he sees you out of class when were supposed to be in class.
---
Yeah that's a good theory. I like it.
---
It's my main game too, and can say it's doing great! That last updates added tons of content, and last week they added the "Fort of the Damned" for Halloween and shit, it's intense.
---
I'm mostly just disappointed with how late the response was. The entire community was hyped for months and then a day before the update they come out and say "lol nope sorry please wait for (insert time here)"
---
I also think we'd be a lot more accepting if we knew what the "unforeseen circumstances" were. If it's something like game crashes or loss of progress I'd understand, but I'd prefer to know that they're ironing out game crashes as opposed to just making a few pixels on the Archives extra shiny. I know they probably wouldn't delay the entire update just for that but negativity bias in my mind makes me doubtful.
---
he needs his stake out tokens
---
No, you shouldn't play with your low-rank friends.
---
Wow lmao, Looks like you're the entitled one. Calling me a "dumbass" and "Delusional" cause I told you not to tunnel. Think someone has DS? Slug them. You know that person has that UNIQUE perk? Don't let them stun you, respect pallets and be warry of lockers (Half the time head on doesn't work anyway). Also I play both Survivor and Killer.
---
Meeting! Shall come toooo OrDer!!
---
The good:  He can really fuck up overly altruistic groups and team gen-ers.  Much like The Plague, survivors gain very little utility from healing and as such once you've gotten in your first round of Feral Frenzy wounds many games will play as though you have permanent exposed effect.
---
The bad:  Once wounded, your power is literally useless, as the fatigue duration makes it not even worth activating for the travel speed.  Because your power is useless on wounded survivors, most of your add-ons are useless too.  Deep Wounds has been nerfed so fucking badly (thanks, Borrowed Time.) that as Legion you will NEVER have a survivor bleed out on you unless they are very new to the game and literally don't understand how the mechanic works.  As such, your ability is purely a time waster and deterrent rather than an actual ability.  Also, because survivors don't wanna heal, they are going to complete gens faster once they are all wounded since they no longer have anything else meaningful to do.  So while your power does waste early game time, arguably the most important time of the game, you will lose some time in the mid-late game because of the way your power incentivizes objective focus.  Also, with the game's current level of lag, frame skipping, and inconsistency between players, having your power deactivate after ONE FUCKING MISS is stupid.  Yes, it was asinine how old Legion could just mash the attack button with no consequences and you were basically guaranteed to take a hit, but shooting him from that extreme to "miss once and you're fucked for the next 24 seconds" is crazy, especially after all of his other nerfs including a speed nerf that makes it harder to catch up to people anyways.
---
The ugly:  If they fixed his add-one to have an actual purpose, made it so that misses only deplete part of your bar rather than drainingentire fucking thing (let's say 1 miss drains 50% of the bar at base, and eith certain add-ons you could decrease the drain to 40%, 33%, and 25%), and made it so fatigue has a slightly shorter timer if you activate fatigue yourself (rather than by getting pallet stunned, missing attacks, and running out naturally) with the fatigue timer getting shorter the more of your bar you had left when you cancelled, Legion would be pretty solid mid-tier.  As it is, he has WAY too many weaknesses on a power that does nothing more than annoy people.  He is currently solid bottom tier, though I definitely don't think he's the worst killer like some people claim.
---
They also had the event on the fucking PTB for weeks
---
Freddy’s best
---
Actually, as fun as those flowers were, there were a lot of complaints about them, because if you were someone who was just trying to play the game, you were at a massive disadvantage, because suddenly your entire team is spending the first few minutes on plants. This change was what most people wanted, and the devs listened.
---
But thats exactly my point in my other comment to mr entitled up there. They are actually talking even if it is laughably little they could absolutely go radio silent and there isnt anything we could do about it. They are updating us/ actually working on the product.
---
Jeff and Adam are my two favorite survivors to play. Funny you ship them
---
[Big mood.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dl7qhl/baby_claudette_never_existed_she_died_in_the_car/)
---
This. People are less upset about the delay and more upset that they were ready to play the event just for Behaviour to go "lol sorry please wait for (insert time here) to have fun."
---
Idk if its because im on PS4 but my match making for killer is around 1-3 minutes, sometimes 30 seconds
---
I don't have friends lol and I'm rank 12 and usually queue with rank 5 randos
---
Theres a whole new side of the game coming out shortly and an event was supposed to start today (but has been delayed). But basically theres a new challenge system that grants you lore and progresses what is essentially a battle pass that grants you cosmetics and stuff. Learn more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWK7ieKRrYE)
---
Additionally, theres a [roadmap](https://preview.redd.it/69y34woc3bq31.jpg?width=768&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c93081f0885e990b7840441ccf1e31f60873fdab) for the year, with the latest addition from it being chapter 13 and the rift after 13 being within the next 2 weeks or so
---
Probably shouldn’t play at work haha
---
*Nightmare before Christmas chapter confirmed*
---
I said this in another thread, don't victimize them. The updates gonna be buggy anyway, and all they did was kill anticipation for the event. Those idiots brought this upin themselves.
---
This is the shittiest thing I’ve seen all day
---
So sensitive - dont cry yourself to sleep over different opinions
---
It's all yours
---
Yeah, it blows my mind when I see a Legion hit you with his power, either swing and miss or wait for the time to run out, then chase you.
---
Like, you could apply so much more pressure if you would hit two people with your power before you purposely run out and hit a survivor to down them.
---
Nah
---
Awesome! Thank you so much for the reply. I really appreciate it!
---
*iiiiim gonna stalk you and raise my tier*
---
*Yooooour gonna run scared and hide in fear*
---
Fair enough.  I still run it sometimes, I just usually tend to run more gen-focused builds nowadays in my SWFs at least.

Especially since, at least in my opinion, this is *the* horror game out right now. One of the most streamed games on twitch. They should be championing Halloween the most out of anyone and it would be the perfect time to draw in new players out of any other month in the year
---
Respecting pallets - you dont play killer you wannabe sensitive survivor mains, you just proved it with one sentence, go cry yourself to sleep over different opinions
---
When was the mid chapter update to be expected to drop? Beginning of November or over a month away?
---
You're mostly talking about perks here, completely avoiding the subject at hand. If you see a key, slap on Franklins or a mori if you're that afraid. 
---
We're discussing prayer beads here, a broken add-on  with little to no counterplay when fully mastered. Stop being ignorant for once and 'stop crying' yourself.
---
Or they could, you know, release a stable update on time, like any competent dev team?
---
Not really, anytime something gets delayed that I was counting down the days for, my hype gets completely killed for the game
---
How exactly does that prove I don't play killer lol?
---

I really feel like there should be a baseline Borrowed Time / Decisive Strike effect on a Survivor, regardless of if you have BT or DS. Something like 5 seconds of Endurance or 20 seconds of DS. They could also make it so that the Borrowed Time still ticks down after your hit or the Decisive only stuns for about 3 seconds. This mechanic would only serve to punish hard face camping Killers, since anyone with half a brain would just wait out the 5 seconds.
---
I do honestly think that tunnelling is a bit too effective as a strategy and does need a nerf. This might be my salt after playing at low ranks after reset, but holy shit the amount of chucklefucks I've played against who just proxy camp and then constantly hard tunnel off the hook is astounding. It's people like this that force everyone at high ranks to run Decisive Strike and Adrenaline constantly. It's way too easy for a Killer to just be an asshole and down you three times in an area with no pallets when you're injured and get a free kill.
---
/rant
---
Thanks mate
---
Thanks mate.
---
I would go as far and say that there's 200% chance of bugs still dropping. By 200% I mean that they will still port bugs from PTB and some random ass new bugs will come, like pretty much trapper getting a new bug every patch while he's not even worked on.
---
I mean cause i like these characters, i like their designs,   And The little backstory the devs give them and i think it’s nice to see art of them getting along or growing closer with each if not friends or in a relationship. I’m not doing anything crazy or wild i ship them cause it’s something i can like outside the game and give them a little bit of a story to go along with it; and the devs post fanart of some random ships on their streams most time and they know its all in good fun.
---
TL/DR Sorry to give you a long ass explanation people say “eww cringe, this is making me cringe so hard” and i just wanna know why.
---
I agree they should do a bundle, and the bundle should be maybe 1-2$ cheaper than separate.
---
I hope you added The Crapper to the other hand
---
HOLY SHIT THAT LOOKS AMAZING
---
all two of you going to start a lil club up? want me to bring ya some fruit snacks?
---
You probably should’ve mentioned that in your original post in order to get your point across better. It still sucks that the devs waited until the last minute to announce the delay, but we’ll all deal with  it.
---
soon if i comment enough maybe reddit will let me post somethiong of my own
---
nice exhaustion management to get out of the basement.
---
Left, it's already blue which means you just gotta paint it red
---
This community will never be satisfied
---
Try to rank up to red ranks without using spirit or nurse (which in your case will take a lot of time) and answer this yourself
---
Exactly!
---
Just looks like latency issues, judging by that weird cancelled vault before you downed her.
---
VOMMY - MOMMIES
---
**ASSEMBLE!**
---
Is that a little chainsaw???
---
I mean I can leave someone and they get unhooked and then I find nobody for like 30 seconds and then the unhooked survivor runs into me because their an idiot and didn’t heal and so I hear them screaming from halfway across the map and then down them after they loop me for like 20 seconds and then they have DS and so they get free and now I’m a toxic tunnelling killer who deserves death.
---
It's 21,600 for whole doc skin. So depending on playtime/your devotion level were talking about a half to a month if you play all day every day. Again, depends on the player. Also assuming you start from 0 shards.
---
Feng is also 21,600.
---
I don't understand this, what happened? I haven't been on today.
---
We’re hoping they make it longer because they’ve delayed it with less than 24 hours notice. We’ll see.
---
Oh i see what you did there
---
yes indeed
---
That's pretty good, but I would unlock that pop.  It's a great perk on any killer  since they made the time you have to use it longer and it's especially great on such a dangerous and mobile killer.  It's awesome when you can down someone before you use pop, use pop, hook the person you just slugged and then off you go to pop again.
---
Because he likes fisting puppets.
---
The demogorgon looks cool.
---
moving out of the killers LoS would be a lot better and couldnt be seen as BM that way your movement is still unknown and you can still keep tabs on the killer
---
He was probably trying to get ready to run the opposite way you were going to go. 
---
Tune in next time when I facecamp for wearing scoops ahoy.
---
Legion can be quite strong when you get a strong 3-gen. Other than that I just play them when I'm looking for a challenge.
---
Ye
---
Ah fair enough what’s usual price for shards?
---

---
Spectator gamemode looks pretty good
---
Each killer should have a 3% chance of triggering a special blade wipe that’s a bit faster than normal,
---
Laughs in Tenacity
---
I'm not saying it isn't, I'm just saying that my dumb mongoloid brain wants confirmation as to what it really is.
---
Here I am, the hopeless optimistic, hoping that it'll only be delayed for like 12 or 24 hours... 
---
Send help.
---
Well that sucks, U'm a fairly new player and so far stick exclusively to survivors, and whenever I get a killer ritual I swap it and pray for a survivor one, and they don't even work 75% of the time
---
So when will it be?
---
Last bloodhunt: Oh boy time to use the 50 Gruesome Gateu's that I got from the anniversary event!
---
First game: All 4 survivors burn oak offerings to make all the hooks farther while they piggyback off of my gateu
---
You mean cells? Its probably a $10 skin altogether, but $5 for a single piece.
---
I fear no perk. But this... *thing*. It scares me. (c)
---
No clue 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Yeah I hope so as well!
---
Dedicated server summer 2019
---
YOU BOTH COMMENTED THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME WHAT
---
Theres a shit in that bag isn't there.....
---
Welcome to DbD!
---
There's a new event comming soon, I hope u have alot of fun!
---
If it’s early in the game I’ll eat their DS and let them go so they can’t use it endgame, because that’s when it’s most powerful
---
Trash killer
---
I insta d/c when I see a nurse.
---
But not before teabagging her to oblivion
---
I suspect it’s either waiting to see if you to kick the pallet/not before making a move, or they are not showing you which direction they’re going to move in to make you uncertain which action to take.
---
The event and patch are postponed (the event was scheluded for today). Check dbd Twitter for tge original tweet.
---
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaait a minute..... is that.....
---
Yes, lets throw more  RNG into a game where the timing is so specific that a "dead hard for distance" can cost a killer 3-4 more minutes of chase.
---
When you are 12 meters or less from a pallet, you are able to throw it without being right next to it. directly landing it on the killer will cause them to yeet out of the map
---
Thanks
---
Turkor is mad after relogic vaulted him out of terraria
---
It would be a strict buff to all killers, what the fuck are you talking about?
---
lol thats a bigger studio than GameFreak...
---
The game is a very good map I dont understand the hate
---
Do a perk maybe do one of Dwight's perks if you could
---
Playstation card shouldn't have tax buy the card and get the amount on the card (assuming it works like Steam cards).
---
Also the new Clown skin is still fucking broken lol.
---
0/10, you don’t float! xD Seriously though this is amazing! You have real talent, simultaneously beautiful and terrifying, true essence of nursey nurse.
---
I'm currently doing the same, consistently refreshing every hour or so just incase, despite knowing full well it's not likely to happen.
---
Using NOED as Infinite Tombstone Myers
---
given the delay we should get more serum :)
---
YES FEED ME PUNS I LOVE IT
---
Yes.
---
Agreed. I had a SWF team mindblown when I was running STBFL. They all tried swarming me and I just started hacking away with 8 stacks and by the time they realized I had it, it was too late.
---
Just change your zip code to a state that does not have tax.
---
The last tier should be 'eats the food, then eats you'
---
And the run time for the event was already short lol they better add double BP to compensate
---
Hot damn you got yourself a deal! -Puppers
---
Alan Clark def doesn’t understand.
---
BBQ and we're going to live forever are the only ones that apply after the match and do not affect the points earned in match.  
---
Perks like distressing, Prove Thyself, and thrill of the hunt just make you hit the bloodpoint cap in that category faster, but don't really provide any additional score bonus.
---
Let’s be honest, it’ll probably still be broken
---
Why we don't get anything from being rank 1, like personalized seasonal skins, auric cells or a border.
---
PLEASE GIVE
---
That’s dried blood, chief.
---
Way to be really combative for no reason.  I don't like the idea of a randomly proccing buff in a game where timing is everything., does that help with your reading comprehension?
---
The halloween event will be released soon with alot of new content, hope you will enjoy!
---
Clown would have been a Jock because he was very athletic in his younger years
---
I love/hate when that happens.
---
At first I didn’t know what the fuck that was but then i turned my phone upside down then i saw it great job man
---
Well damn. Did we at least get any new skins today?
---
&gt;They could go absolutely radio silent and there isn’t anything we can do about it
---
Translation: “They aren’t doing the absolute worst thing possible so they are immune to criticism.”
---
And for the record, the very easy thing to do about it would be I would take my business elsewhere. They aren’t entitled to my business anymore than I am entitled to their updates. They stop updating, I stop playing. Not out of spite, but that’s how the world works bud.
---
Do you think God stays in heaven cause he fears what he created? Y E S
---
Happened to me last night WITH the Kindred perk.  
---
so damn frustrating.
---
So yeah, this happened to me today. I just started recording my gameplay bcs so much weird stuff happened after they launched the dedicated servers, and here is some of it. More is coming, promised!
---
We don't kink shame here
---
I think DL is a bit much, as it’s gotta get a lot of hooks to rev up, and you need a lot on early game to replace ruin. Otherwise sound. 
---
The point of this build is hit and run. Keep people injured, then sneak up and get den grabs or downs a they heal. Don’t do long chases, keep them paranoid.
---
There is no date, but hopefully by the end of the week, since it was last minute, it was unexpected.
---
I suppose it depends on the set up of the pallet, but generally its better to see what the killers next move is before making your next move. If they break the pallet then move on to another loop, if they avoid breaking the pallet then you try to loop them around it (unless its unsafe). 
---
Breaking LoS is easier said then done a lot of the time since getting any sort of distance means your leaving scratch marks showing where you went, but walking so you don't leave scratch marks means you won't get very far.
---
Yamaoka means free win for survivors tho
---
he was probably trying to keep momentum because he didn't know where you were going
---
Michael is going straight to HR.
---
Ah, I was unaware you earned the exp fragmemts while getting the challenges too. That's my mistake. I thought it was only after finishing the challenges
---
Hook as long as you want you still lost lol
---
Damn. I can just copy and paste the exact response I made to someone else. Thanks! Here it is.
---
You realize how many hackers would crop up? There is already enough right now, imagine how many more there would be if there was incentive.
---
This is the biggest lie I’ve ever encountered...
---
Thabk you for clearing that up for me. I was just really concerned.
---
Wow, I would absolutely hate to play against you!
---
Which means the build is perfect.
---
Thanks for the awesome reply!
---
Wel I guess it’s fine, it’s just not my cup of tea
---
Right. And it’s a stupid point. Unless you’re claiming that because I can’t fly a plane I’m not allowed to criticize delays in flights. Or maybe a more extreme example. My pilot is flying us into a mountain. Can’t criticize because I can’t fly a plane ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
To be fair, they are a big studio and Dead by Daylight is just one part of it. They are probably most known at the moment for DbD because of its success but long and very far reaching history.
---
Bubba isn't actually that bad on the Game, loops are long so you have to put down pallets if he revs, so he can get rid of pallets quickly.
---
Exactly not the point of the clip lol
---
Makes me want to turn the game off lol
---
Sure ! Lemme hook you up ;)
---
I'm a great fan of DbD, I play it often, I watch gameplays everyday, streamers, I got wallpapers of the game on my phone.
---
But It's been a pain in the ass, boring and my hype It's being reduced to ashes, since all the new content they create, comes filled with bugs, tons of paid skins and delayed content.
---
I do my best to gain more players everyday, but Behaviour does the opposite.
---
Same, my friend, same. It's really sad, I even skipped getting coffee with a friend just to come home to this.
---
But we can still hope. Or maybe hope they'll somehow make up for it, surprise us with something... something that doesn't actually cost money.
---
they're both blue?? the left ond
---
*heartbeat intensifies*
---
No worries I DC vs each spirit! Go play alone boosted
---
unless ive totally missed something, which is possible I guess.
---
Most games gens dont get powered, its not worth it over most other perks.
---
Yes, but don't worry you'll never know cuz most players will just dc
---
Answer: Yes! Lmao
---
Can someone tell me what i should be looking at?
---
That's a bad ass meme indeed!
---
That damn mms.
---
Thats a hard no.
---
Yeah pretty much, I've had like tons of people basically say "no" when I mention that I use Thanatophobia or give it as a suggestion as part of a build so I suggest DL as an alternative. 
---
Personally I prefer Thanatophobia as I use it over DL in every context and it's really fucking stupid that DL doesn't affect the obsession as well but that's how it is unfortunately :/
---
I’m on console, and I’m pretty sure there not here yet. Didn’t know about PC.
---
If so, he should. It's good.
---
Threw pallet too early.
---
if you play killer then you should feel lucky
---
if you play survivor then im sorry :(
---
The only way to play bing bong past purple ranks.
---
Lmao you guys are funny. He didn't confirm there's no bloodhunt, he said wait for official confirmation before getting your hopes up (or in this case, let your hope be devoured). You guys are literally doing the exact opposite of what he said.
---
Are you me? Because I literally did the exact same thing. Cancelled on my friend after work to rush home to find the announcement. It really freaking sucks. 
---
The only thing they'll possibly to do make up for it is bloodhunt and/or extend the event but we shall see.
---
Totally agree
---
Must of been first time going for the pallet save lol I did it too my first time
---
I play both, and I’m definitely interested to see how it goes when they arrive haha.
---
Just put em on a hook LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL 4Head
---
I lost many braincells reading your comment. What are you try to argue? I am defending BHVR fam.
---
Controllers are expensive, but not as much as throwing it through your tv/monitor. Time to invest.
---
Awesome!
---
Most of the other killers are in that same boat. They're all 115 (minus a couple) and relying on an m1, they just have to get another hit.
---
i do that when chasing them to add extra intensity
---
That’s about a small problem I have with the game lol.
---
Imagine an insidious Sniper Doctor camping his ruin.
---
I hate when people put cold wind offerings because as a killer main 7/10 times I play that map I get rushed super hard and get usually only one kill while any other map I’ll usually get 3-4
---
Dies in a what now
---
Same, enough snoot boops to go around
---
once they fix the weird stuff like grabs failing half the time and stalking constantly messing up I think itll be perfectly fine. But until then my boy Mikey is all kinds of messed up
---
Due to unforeseen circumstances Dead By Daylight will now be cancelled and replaced with our new game, Deathgarden: Bloodharvest. Thank you for understanding.
---
*You truly are the lowest scum in history*
---
#ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA
---
I use lullaby cause it's hard to detect and not alot of people go looking for it like ruin
---
They also just said that no double BP has been confirmed. Pretty disappointing.
---
Who makes a thread to ask if something was toxic or not?  
---
It's not toxic in my opinion but you clearly went out of your way to show him that you thought it was and ruined his match.
---
Same
---
If that's true, then maybe they should have the foresight to back up their work when on a deadline.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing stuff like that as long as it's non-intrusive. Maybe as 'the Game' fades to black, and the endgame screen fades in, billy the puppet chuckles. Something subtle, not lore breaking, would be fun.

Borderlands 3 event doesn't start until the 24th so we got time.
---
What else should you do when you see all 3 people doing gens assuming someone else will get the save lol
---
Well his lore does state he was pretty athletic, in his young days and current time
---
I do understand your point but considering that his slow is like -15% for a few seconds plus the fact he has limited bottles, he really needs his current speed to do anything in my opinion
---
Practice that levitation 😂 and yeh big bong is probably a good choice for me. Got an ig btw?
---
Yeah my comment was a bit unnecessary
---
The grabs failing is one of the most annoying things as killer, hopefully it is fixed very soon
---
My favorite is when I eat the DS and then catch them 7 seconds later because they aren’t good at loops and then they inevitably DC. Then I get a message. “nIcE TuNNELInG”
---
THE HELL PRIEST!!!!! I’m so happy someone knows what he’s actually called and what Clive Barker refers to him as. Fuck yeah!
---
I also love all of these suggestions. But for The Thing I don’t think it should ever show what it is like it did in the prequel movie.
---
Chris walker would fit the best in DBD from Outlast imo. And I like the concept
---
Imagine being THE premier horror game on the market and botching your haloween event this badly
---
This is actually sad
---
At least until the mid-chapter. After that, Spine Chill and Premonition will both work.
---
Technically he still plays sci-fi shit when he's close I guess he just has that going on his little mp3 player and can't be fucked to get headphones.
---
Because thats what is happening lol
---
Don’t give up! This has been my experience where I either get mori’ed or camped but I won’t give up! One day I will find an Oinky-Chan that will let me boop their snoot and it will be worth it

You need to write better. You are consistently unclear.
---
Uuuuhhhh... yeah 😂
---
Personally, as a new Killer, I have a much harder time finding survivors if they aren't coughing/leaving a super obvious trail of green smoke around them. If they play passively and immerse afterwards, I quickly lose all momentum... until they 3-gen themselves and are forced to touch my sticky gens.   
---
Alternatively, the worst-case scenario (for survivors) is when ONE survivor can't take it anymore and cleanses when his whole team is sick. Then I get the best of both worlds: Easy to track and 1-hit downs, and super puke. 
---
Best way to deal with (my) plague is just immerse until Corrupt Intervention wears off, then gen-rush clean Gens. If you get sick, stay sick, and just relentlessly rush gens. I can't keep up, but like I said I am new, better Plagues may be able to deal with this.
---
Man your comments history is a treat, you are perhaps the least funny, ignorant, pigheaded... I can't even I could list another 50+ words easily. Your not funny, your not coming across as smart and your just being annoying and petty. Do everyone a favour and think before you open your big mouth
---
Entity has claimed another for the hope gone
---
Granted, but it's not much of a horror game to begin with, a horror premise, but I don't find it scary, just anxiety inducing when I debate whether I can sneak a quick itch in before a skill check pops up or if I'll be able to reach a survivor before they make it to a pallet
---
No crying, please. It’s a waste of good suffering!
---
🤣
---
yes. I'm not sure how cuz I don't play pc, but I know you can disable endgame chat, probably in the settings somewhere

Nice hooker nails lol
---
Yep
---
Winterween. ...Actually, I wanna see that.
---
Why is my ding dong hard ?
---
God, I hope it is before then. Events that start on Halloween and bleed 2 or 3 weeks into Nov feel weird
---
Where did you hear that?
---
Angel - "You can already 1-hit down people with your chainsaw you know."
---
Devil - "Don't listen to that bitch, you need NOED so you can 1-hit down with your hammer too!! You suck and you know it so DO IT!!"
---
Yeah he's my favourite, most people go for Joker xD
---
Man this is embarrassing, your arguing over a virtual butt? I can't even begin to piece together how sad that is.
---
Difference of ranks should have a hard cap of 6. You might be able to send this to the devs cause something clearly went wrong here
---
Bargain mate!
---
Oh sorry I misread I thought you said when the killer wasn't coming at you. I get what you're saying.
---
No the point of Prayer Beads is to give bad players ez 4k's.  It's the most broken addon in the game.  I refuse to even buy them on her webs because I don't mind actually having to outplay my opponents.
---
Aw ty I swear I used to have bad nails and cuticles I had a horrible habit of biting my nails but I stopped. It means a lot to me that a lot of positive comments because I was scared to post them lol
---
Is camping end game still camping? 
---
If not, consider this:
---
Hook is literally right next to exit gate. Survivor is hooked with killer shack right next to it, two people left, leaving one person on foot. Why would I chase with exit gate right next to me?
---
Yep. He's getting undetectable like the other stealth killers. Detection perks will work but he'll be immune to aura reading and have a 0m terror radius.
---
You are one cool person mate! Keep being a badass! 
---
I also hope one day we get a cool scarecrow movie either horror or Batman wise. 
---
I love scarecrow one of my favorite all time villains!
---
this is Dwight rainbows make me cry
---
As a Bing Bong main, I can confirm that this is super accurate.
---
I’m def going to do more killers and a survivors hand as well 🤩
---
"Uh, I voted for the Hookers"
---
Exactly why I run Kindred.
---
nah mate, that was a simple statement
---
oh hell yeah dude, update when you can cause they look fucking great.
---
K
---
They're like the only ones I own but Id rate them really high theyre much better than the straight to dvd stories and has an army load of cool cenobites, more time in the labyrinth hell world and Kirsty is back lol
---
I like where u started with the post and where u started with the costplay and where u ended up.
---
Would like more content
---
This. 
---
Honestly what I’d like is the ability to take perks Out of the pool. Reduce some of this RNG bullshit.
---
id love to take you seriously but i simply cant when you dont know the difference between your and you're. "your not coming across as smart" is a very ironic sentence hahahha
---
This could be a special deal they do to sell more cosmetics.
---
You first pick any character.
---
Then you go through each section and pick one cosmetic from each.
---
Then the game will make it a custom set and display the combination.
---
You then can buy it via Auric Cells at a slighty increased discount. (15-20%)
---
Solves the issue of wanting to see a certain combination and you get to save a little extra cash if you decide you want to buy it.
---
Gobble Gobble!
---
it'll still be full of bugs when they release it late, don't kid yourself.
---
Hell’s Kitchen good
---
Crimboween.
---
Hell yeah! Sounds like I should definitely pick them up probably off amazon lol. 
---
Thank you very much. 
---
I own all the dvd movies and only a handful I can enjoy. 
---
I hope you have a good day!
---
Where is CANDYMAN
---
I haven't seen Prayer beads in like a month in red ranks survivor. But I see insta heals every game recently :)

Thanks so much! I didn’t think anyone would be interested in a WIP video, but perhaps there’s more interest than I expected!

20 seconds feels like forever when you're in a real live match, yes.
---
That's a fair enough assumption to make lmao, Ty for the feedback!
---
If decisive is still a problem for you post rework you're just bad.  Stop tunneling.  I don't even get D striked in my killer games.  They're 3 perk survivors.  Your loadout here that you're blowing yourself for running is literally the most broken skilless cheese bullshit in the game for killer.  It's the equivalent of a 4 man SWF on comms running Balanced and a Haddonfield offering to give you some perspective.  Unplayable dogshit games for your survivors.  But hey you get to 4k without needing to know how to play the game so awesome amirite?
---
Pfft, limbo

And ones which are far, far more polished

Hope is what is keeping us alive, let us keep it and feel safe in the realm of the entity.

Seems like a solid price. What about 420 tho?

Don’t cleanse? Enjoy that -16% Thanatophobia slowdown, boys.

Lmao. I have plenty of games I play. I am by no means stuck on this game. You should try taking BHVR’s dick out of your ass though I can’t imagine it’s comfortable. I’m saying they should be better at communicating and development, I’m not calling for the destruction of the devs. Christ.
---
Go fuck yourself, i'm not a native speaker.
---
Lol well at least you take criticism well. Ty for not being butthurt and complaining. 
---
As much as that doesn’t sound nice I mean it as a very nice compliment. Hope you have a good one!

No, it’s legit. Killer not camping end game hook is a killer giving up.

boooop BOOOPBOOP boOoOoop BOop BOOp Rawr XD

Would be awesome. I have a ton of cosplay friends on there. If u ever do, my IG name is the same as my Reddit one
---
Maybe ask for clarification rather than insult you absolute fucking pancake
---
I know, but these people don't, you can't go against the mould of this sub without feeling the wrath of the uneducated.
---
Imagine if the the game allowed survivors to find shards of glass and stones within the game.
---
That would be fun.
---
So Monitor and Abuse is no longer needed for tier 1 Myers?
---
Huh, neat
---
It’s pretty stuffy in there tbh. I did poke small holes near the center of the mask so I can breathe easier through my nose.
---
Looks like it's now on sale in the EN-US store, by the way.
---
NP, it seems dumb to be butthurt over someone criticizing you unless they're cutting you down with the intent to hurt you, but yeah you too!
---
Don't forget you have a much more difficult time getting Deviousness because nobody cleanses to give you super puke gains
---
The top one used to be for the shrine of secrets and I think the bottom one is just to switch from survivor to killer
---
So can you just pop those off and on whenever you want? Or do they have to destroyed eventually 😿
---
Ok motherfuckin donut, imma just stop reading your fish stuff and go back to my cherry killing spree.
---
Like this fuckhead dev team is gonna get it right anyways
---
You probably don’t need two sight seeing perks mate.
---
I have the sudden urge to make chocolate bloodpoints for Halloween....
---
You wanna share that 3d model perchance?
---
Yeah, I'm already missing the planned BP event because of a convention (second one in a row I'll miss!),  and I'm not looking forward to the new date announcement for this event.
---
What do you mean 4k? I hear that alot, is that blood points or somthing?
---
It is hard to find any info in the code about how Static Field actually works, all of my information is based on testing I conducted. And it seemed like slugged Survivors gained Madness at the same rate as normal ones.
---
That’s so gooooood!!!!
---
As much as Pyarmid Head is the iconic figure in the Silent Hill universe, the idea of Twin Victim chasing me down without the ability the go in a different room to get away from it is terrifying
---
Yes we need possessed ashy
---
He means with randos. 
---
Since the change I have noticed being rank 8 survivor randomly queued with survivors 1, 2 and 4 for a match (killer was rank 4). Then in the next game, being ranked 8 and matched with a rank 10, 12 and 15 survivor (killer ranked 9).
---
Imo, this should never happen.
---
No the fuck it’s not. Lol.
---
Guy is playing Trapper and you mock him for only getting 1 kill? With 2 injured at endgame and they flashlight click him. Im saying that when you assume kills=wins then you get everyone playing Spirit and nobody playing Trapper or Wraith or weaker killers that are more difficult to 4K because their abilities aren't as powerful. I think you dont have to get kills to win because you can tunnel camp and slug 4Ks all you want and that's not the same as winning chases and you can play well, win chases and the survivors still escape. The killer's success isnt always measured by kills but by how you play and how smart you can play. That said, leaving teammates to die doesn't seem like winning either and the criteria for survivors winning should be based on teamwork and not letting your teammates die more than just escaping alone.
---
Tl:dr BMing weak killers leads to everyone playing OP killers and less variety. Be nice to people playing weaker killers sometimes they are disadvantaged. And kills don't equal wins, playstyle dictates success, because kills can be achieved without playing well.
---
Spirit Fury and Enduring
---
Lol im dick riding because im telling you you are acting like an entitled brat? Go play those other games then and stop wasting your time crying , bud
---
Broken sound effect for nurse whilst using one of the reworked add ins, $20 on that!
---
Why are you not at the dolmen?!
---
I understand abit more now cheers I haven't got all the killers so I don't know how half of them work properly yet
---
And yet killers always claim they “don’t care” if you DC and they even “like it because easy game”.
---
That reverse psychology shit ain’t working.
---
They’re doing it to spite us at this point.
---
Honestly I'm ready. The more Halloween there is in life, the better!
---
AGREED, i understand people are passionate about the game but a lot of them really seem to take it so seriously, attacking people simply because they have to wait a little while longer for a couple of cosmetics.
---
No what's going to happen is I'm going to try to leave the pallet and your line of sight and your gonna get me. I wait because who knows if I can loose you or get to the next pallet.
---
I agree that whatever change they made, was actually worse than before. 
---
I have been screwed as a lvl 8 survivor, but also seen a lvl 10 killer go against me and lvls 1-3 in a match. 
---
Not cool.
---
The fact people still say that survivors/killers are "entitled" makes me feel like they are the same people to spam "pREttY gooD jOB So FaR" on every minor bug post.
---

Yea they are fake nails. My nails are long but not sharp. So when I finish I carefully take them off and start new. I’m in the process of letting my nails grow longer then continue painting on my natural nails.

Yeah I was gonna mention, whenever I do 99 a gen, this is normally the reason
---
I want to see Jack Torrance in Dead By Daylight so fucking badly
---
Like I said, you're letting your anger control you and inhibiting you from having a civil conversation. You're insulting me, attacking me, when I haven't said anything of the like to you. You're also downvoting. I'll be blocking you, and I hope that you learn from your ways because you're already burning bridges with your friends...and you're gonna burn a whole lot more.
---
As much as I love the Shining (book and movie), and I would love to hear the Shining's theme when I load into the Overlook map, I dont think Jack would be that interesting of a Killer in my honest opinion. I still love the ideas and the look you made for the post though.
---
They're running Devour Hope, we're playing right into their hands!
---
k
---
It’s the opposite for me, if it’s not a speedy killer you can usually open the door before they check the one your at. It’s luck though. Sometimes it’s worth it to wait at the door for them to close hatch but sometimes not. Definitely not if it’s a fast killer like hillbilly, spirit, demo with portals, etc.
---
60% bro not even that's 80% meme
---
They do this all the time. I love the game, but BHVR has been unprofessional for years. They completely ignore their community's requests, don't update us on what's going on until the last possible day, and so on. It happens with a lot of events. And yes, I am calling out the community managers. There are people at BHVR, you can see a couple of them above, who's ONLY job is to work with the community, release news, etc. The fact they can't update us until the same day as a delay is pretty pitiful. Yes I realize that BHVR was probably working late last night trying to get the event to run and couldn't , but that's not an excuse.
---
Ohh no, they have 5 stacks.
---
Fix it
---
This is a reallllly solid cosplay! Well done.
---
This is what the post should have been like instead of what it was
---
Which one would you suggest getting rid of? both have been pretty helpful
---
this reads like navy seal copypasta lmao

 *What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top rank in the Hookers, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Squadettes, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire huntress forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the Entity and your location is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can mori you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in clicking m1, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the killer perks and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit bloodpoints all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.*
---
I'm not sure which scum you're talking about. 
---
If you're talking about the person offering to barter up their body in a trade, then it's more of an issue that people would take up on that offer, imo, than the fact that it was offered. They have full control over their body and I frankly don't care what they do with it.
---
The real issue is that there is a market for this sort of thing. People don't have self-control, and frankly, that's more of a "them" problem, than the people who take advantage of it.
---
(also if the person is underage, shitty parenting, and also makes the entire "name visible" thing much more of an issue imo)
---
This event isnt proof of progress even if it came on time. They literaly took the reward from the event and put it on the fucking battlepass. Why even have an event at that point?
---
I could fall asleep to this
---
I actually I was building on the joke without overtly acknowledging I understand it. 
---
If I get r/whooosh 'd I would simply say "No u".
---
You complete and utter waffle
---
BHVR PLEASE make these killers a reality!!!!
---
But then that would make DC useless
---
Says it needs disc when it's in so can't log in , also hi lol
---
And I’m an entitled brat for telling you that I want quality content when I pay money for it? Lmao
---
no a LOT of thought went into this
---
Behaviour &lt; EA
---
All up to you on which you find less helpful. 
---
But if you need 2 sight seeing perks that’s alright. 
---
Some people do some don’t. It’s all on your skill of finding survivors. I would try and run with 1. And another perk and see how good you do like that.
---
Well that contradicts what you just stated. You said no add-ons should have a downside
---
trapper is a nerd because he spends all his time building stuff and hanging out with his dad
---
Generally bbq and chili and the ruin.  If I'm feeling confident I'll swap out ruin for pop goes the Weasel but I'm too greedy to drop bbq
---
Pyramid head would be sick as fuckkkkkk
---
Noon question: what does it mean when a survivor farms another survivor?
---
You're gonna be fixing it and out of nowhere just hear the Halloween theme
---
Samuel was the real MVP for me, guy just KNEW things without the game shoving it down your throat
---
Also as long as Chloe doesnt sound like an entirely different person I wouldnt mind
---
Be careful there might be ruin
---
Sir cum stances. My new Skyrim character name.
---
I think I got into the wrong Realm......
---
The games great.  Devs have made some goofs, but overall they nailed this game so far.
---
People really need to realize just how terrible Behaviour is. They have greed on par with EA, balance the game like disabled toddlers, and only add bare minimum content to the game. The only type of content they have added since launch is a survivor skin, killer, and 1 map. Despite the fact that the expansions barley add anything to the game, they are locked behind a paywall. Plus the fact that every new character added has their own perks, the game becomes pay to win. Want the 2 mandatory killer perks in the game? Pay up.
---
It's all fun and games here until someone dies.
---
What if touching it ACTUALLY puts you in the fog and Mcote has been a killer this whole time?
---
when someone uses the game offering
---
“happy doctor noises”
---
This is what annoys me more than the delay. 
---
Is it a 1 day delay or a 1 week delay? I hate their communication sometimes.
---
You unhook them within the killer’s terror radius, without borrowed time...you don’t take a hit to stop the killer from downing that person and cowardly run away while they get downed and hooked again. 
---
Rinse and repeat. 
---
This is quite stupid though, since you lose points for unsafe hookings... and you can make points by being a distraction and taking a hit... but what do survivors care about other survivors, it’s not like you need them to survive, right? 😅
---
*Carry on with all these it’s always sunny memes please :)*
---
Hey so it might not be them DCing. The game keeps kicking me over and over and over and it looks like I DCd to my teammates. It’s literally making the game unplayable.
---
I haven't heard about this though I'm not surprised at all. What's broken about it?
---
Nifty. Post more sometime :'D
---
And an ebony mori.
---
I don’t know the numbers behind it, but I love the idea of free to play.  If they can profit off of the store and battlepass I’d love to see the new players FTP might bring.
---
That doesn't make any sense at all.. Tier 1 is supposed to not be detected by anything. Did they specifically say this?
---
Goddamnit
---
L M A O.
---
Going to copy this changed version if you don't mind as the last argument for some rude idiots
---
If you don't happen to live in Germany, I could only be you if I had invented teleportation. I mean, that would be sweet, but still... :D
---
Let's keep our fingers crossed for a release tomorrow!
---
Or the game DCs you for you!
---
League of Legends says hello
---
If they literally had to delay the update then I reckon what they’re trying to fix is game breaking in some serious sense. The devs aren’t daft, I can confidently say they didn’t want to delay the event/update, but if whatever happened is so bad that they need to then I think it’s best they fix it before they give it to us.
---
( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)
---
Legion 2k19
---
Funnily enough Legion is my main and I love playing them.
---
On the flip side I HATE playing against legion because 9/10 times the person plays him/her like an idiot and only tunnels 1 person most of the time and makes the match boring.
---
It’s when someone places another survivor in a dangerous situation to farm/gain bloodpoints, even if the survivor they “helped” is guaranteed to die or be rehooked. 
---
Example: unhooking someone right in front of the killer without borrowed time so the killer will literally just smack the survivor and hook them again.
---
Classic lol
---
Meh, there is always a few people who disagree with EVERY killer suggested. It's whatevs. As for Gluskin, I personally think he wasn't as intimidating/scary as Chris. But that's just me.
---
Ya that happens all the time lol
---
What are you talking about?  Killers have THE most infamous second chance perk in the game at their disposal.  NOED.  It doesn't get much more crutch second chance than that.
---
Because its harder to loop when she has a ranged ability that can injure you
---
Ooh just in time for my 6013th birthday!
---
Yeah, I feel you man. It could be anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks.
---
I imagine because nobody likes her red vomit bullshit. I cleanse all the same, whenever she drinks from a fountain or whatever I usually hide in the nearest locker as soon as I even hear her terror radius.
---
Poeple love to complain about noed, but maybe if survivor perks didn't make it easy to run a killer around for ages it wouldn't be used as much
---
BBQ!  Leatherface is actually fun to play with the exception of maybe red ranks.  He also has some hidden masks you can unlock.  Big fan of the Claude.
---
BHVR and nice should not be in the same sentence if we're talking about dead by daylight
---
To prevent her from getting her corrupt purge.
---
Then tell us that. And fix the bugs we have currently that almost make the game unplayable.
---
Boar axe! Thank you man.
---
I like the idea to search for weapon parts and restoring them (instead of fixing gens) and when you have all restored you can put them together and create a weapon that can kill the killer.
---
I would like to have this as an alternative way to play the game, but not in a separate game mode. It should be part of the normal game, but should be harder so only when you are very good you can achieve it. But it should be no impossible to do with randoms, because that would cause that all survivors play only in SWF Groups
---
After you cleanse, that water turns red. She can drink it and her spit becomes corrupt spit that for quite some time that rather than make you ill it counts as a hit
---
So imagine a range attack can go over windows across pallets its crazy
---
I’m honestly so ok with this event being delayed. I just want them to fucking fix the bugs we have now.
---
Huntress doesn't really go well with agressive perks since you shouldn't be M1ing most of the time. Also you shouldn't eat pallets but instead predict when they throw it down and punish it with a hatchet. 
---
Pretty much leaves her with tracking and slowdown perks.
---
If you want to keep them busy try running iron maiden with BBQ. BBQ is more useful on her than most killers as it gives you chances at hatchet snipes. And iron maiden counters their counter. Also reloading hatchets faster is always nice. Other than that ruin is always the correct choice and for the last slot i'd go either whispers or dying light, depending on what you have trouble with.
---
Survivor: \****Use dead hard\****
---
Traps: \****Am I a joke to you?\****
---
Gimme a min.
---
Hahahahaha I used to sing that song too
---
In be for
---
Lel. Slugging a DS survivor after the huge nerf is literally the definition of being a child.
---
Any update will have bugs. It’s just that if they don’t delay it there might be a game breaking bug that ruins hundreds of games until it’s fixed. This delay is unfortunate but it’s saving us from that pain
---
When the event gets released, I'm getting hag and Clown's skins, then I'll stop to play DbD for a while.I used to get every DLC on the first hour released, but not this time, and hopefully I stop to play this game for good.
---
It's a very funny game, but all disappointment that I get with this game, all the bugs, the toxic community, hours wasted waiting for a match, really makes me think twice about keep going with this.
---
I'm not talking about money when i say its on the pass. The point is that it takes away from the event. If the event reward isnt tied to the actual event then it feels much more underwhelming of an event. Also the pass might look like a great deal (thats how they getcha) but in reality its designed to be extremely challenging to complete. Think to yourself, would they really add all the auric cells you spent to the track if they expected you to complete it? This is exactly why theres also a button to spend more money to avoid playing the track you just bought for 10 dollars. The track is made to frustrate you do you will buy your way to the end. Buying all the tiers with auric cells costs 70 bucks ontop of the flat price. That is where all the money will come from.
---
Another event that I grind up to 1million blood points to be prepared for the moment it starts, another event delayed. Another week of me just playing something else for a break.
---
IT IS NOT A LIE! I ALLOW BOOPS BUT I NEED MUH HOOKS TOO
---
Found the flash light clicker lol
---
I completely agree! It gives the killer a chance to turn the whole game around in their favor. I honestly don’t blame the guy for using noed but, I do blame him for camping and tunneling that poor Nea the whole match.
---
From what I’m seeing, people are angry because of the delay
---
It won't come out today or tomorrow, but prolly before the end of the week so between Thursday and Sunday.
---
But letting her hit you once and you go down without much of a chase is fine? 
---
Well alright then.
---
The one issue with Jack Torrance is he's too normal looking for a killer and he has no stand out special ability but other than that I like him as a killer
---
Perfect, dude.
---
I would expect the instant down to be the main reason to cleanse.
---
How?
---
Like the titanfall/apex 👌melee
---
You on xbox?
---
Yes because she becomes a regular m1 killer you can juke pallets become normal etc
---
If she becomes shotgun lets say you cleanse and your other 3 are still diseased a good plague will slug you all its insane the range and width of the attack
---
Get Spirit Fury from the shrine and replace it for Whispers. It's really strong with Enduring, you wouldn't mind pallets at all.
---
But everyone like being instantly downed? I just see more reasons to cleanse.
---
You keep them out of the game for the time being, and can likely pressure whoever just unhooked them. That and it keeps survivors from complaining about tunneling if they have a brain cell
---
Jesus Christ. This event is a mess. Reminds me of the Curtain Call Disaster.

Ok So First I meant DS, sorry. Also Sorry for the deleted comment I accidentally clicked post when I wasn't done typing. Anyways DS let's you stun the killer after 60 seconds of being unhooked. If you could just Find rocks or glass shards and use them then there would be no point in bringing DS. Also it would be to OP since if you found one you could just get off the killer's shoulder for free.
---
it's not that the broken status is not a problem, just letting her have the ranged attack is usually worse, against a good plague you will probably get hit twice with the ranged attack much faster than getting hit once with the melee and she will still have a large bit of corrupt purge to murder the rest of your team
---
Aww, that’s very admirable! No wonder you were blessed with such good karma... the real MVP right here!
---
That "normal looking guy" scares me more than some teens in a mask lol
---
Hey yeah thanks. I already bought it went that sale started. Odd that it's a ps plus sale vs a halloween sale that it went under. But either way I'm glad i caught it and went for it.
---
Wow amazing
---
I'd love every single one of those chapters
---
He has got you there fam grammar is important when doing a big speech though i don't agree with what they did you gotta make sure you don't mess up so they can't make fun of you
---
hot damn that looks amazing!
---
Blessed friend
---
Spirit's lore shows her DEFINITELY as a victim, and so does plagues, is there only one killer allowed to be a victim in their lore? I mean of the original killers, Wraith was kind of the original victim, i guess his could be argued a little more though.  And hag and nurse, also were initially victims before becoming fucked up.  Honestly at least half the killers were not originally fucked up like the trapper was.  That dude's lore is dark.
---
I’m praying for BBQ since there’s no way to get it on the switch version other than the shrine.
---
Okay now I'm sold on the game, and with hallowed blight being delayed this is the perfect time!
---
I posted it for ya.
---
Don’t forget to hit him with that GG EZ at the end.
---
What makes the game unplayable
---
Thank you so much!!!
---
Doctor has tortured himself for fun before the entity, that eye opening metal shit on his face was done by him so he wouldn't blink and miss a moment of torture he was giving, you know...for science.
---
I am truly excited for a late halloween event, can't lie!
---
*Gurgling noises*
---
Huntress began doing fucked up shit before the entity though.  Her only innocence is her as a little child, though she also is the only killer lore that goes into her childhood if I am remembering correctly.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the info!
---
she killed ANYONE in her forest, or should i say, her red forest.
---
Np!
---
Art by me. I can't wait see the Halloween event "The Archives." I wanna know about The Trapper's past and wanna draw more comic series about it.
---
Yeah man, understandable, been there.
---
billy, meh, wraith, yes.
---
Weird!
---
That's why you never leave the last person alone until they're on second stage.
---
Peaceful
---
You need to play a game while you wait to play a game.
---
approach the pig slowly, you may need to crouch walk up to her to show you're not a threat. don't approach from behind.
---
HELL YES Happy Halloween &lt;3
---
I have the game since day 1, i quit after 2 years cause the grind was so sad and was coming back during events.The second year of the game was full of events even the simple ones like double and triple bp weekends.These small events made me come back and enjoy the game some days per month/2 months.The last year and this year so far there are 0 events.I dont get it,what costs them to bring double bp weekends once a while?I literally installed the game yesterday to play  during the event only to realise that they canceled the event and they didnt even turn on some double bp days. WTF is this marketing.I havent spent any money since Spirit DLC and i wont,they dont deserve it.
---
They literally could have just hit y’all but instead they rage quit based on their poor gameplay
---
Action Slug!
---
I would guess most people won't be doing that. Of course, most people also won't complete the track. 
---
Battles passes are innately attempts at a money grab, but I'm more excited for the challenges and lore, tied to the battle pass progression. We still have to see how it pans out(I'm console so haven't played it) but...idk. I personally will probably complete it, so I'm just excited that it's different from business as usual
---
Watch them delay it a week and not extend the event past the previous end date. Bet we'll be still be able to pay money for the cosmetics though
---
Though you got him on the fact that he messed up his grammar this does not excuse you for being a horrible person in general and making fun of his poor grammar only proves his point that you are "not coming across as smart" since only an idiot would use such an easy metaphorical punch to get someone down so in the end you've doomed yourself by responding to his message now if you can come back at me with something more than just a grammar mistake then maybe you can prove me wrong about you being an idiot
---
The knife is set back into the arm instead of in the hand in first person view, so from the clown’s perspective you’re running around giving survivors a thumbs up the whole game lol.
---
How does noed activate?
---
But my hope will never die!
---
I don’t know what this is from. This is literally the only its always sunny ive posted dude.
---
\*Makes sad pig noises at the post\*
---
Yeah, I'm excited about the new challenges and won't be buying the pass, but it just saddens me to see Behaviour stoop so low.
---
The corrupt vomit is an insta down. Therefore meaning either way one hit you’re down. It’s easier to avoid her and juke her without the corrupt vomit. Therefore making it better to not cleanse bc the corrupt vomit is op and can hit anyone easily
---
that man has seen some shit
---
Trapper: Shame *loads STBFL with 8 tokens, enduring, and brutal strength*
---
Also
---
That rarely happens to me
---
Discordance it’s good for finding survivors to stalk them or yoink them
---
Sadly I encounter the same thing when I play survivor, I definitely go against her the least out of all of them
---
They already announced the event will be the same length
---
We dont need 272 toxic players with insta heals and OoO in a week but we still get it.
---
Eat shit asshole, fall off your horse.
---
Shrine of secrets
---
It’s on switch already afaik.
---
Freddy was a pedophile before he became a killer
---
Sole Survivor is basically aura immunity against the killer that increases in range depending on how many survivors are dead. Depending on how upgraded both OoO and SS are, SS's max range negates the negative of OoO's max range, meaning you would see the killer and they won't see you if you are within appropriate distance from the killer.
---
A snowy maze map like the shinnings outside area would be amazing. Or I’ll settle for the overlook hotel
---
I use noed on gf and I still stalk because I'm not a dick and only use it for the speed boost
---
Which people had to wait over a year to have bbq in. It’s an alternative to buying the dlc, but a pretty poor one considering a select few meta perks almost never show up in it.
---
If they add Pyramidhead I will shit bricks
---
Basically, discordance makes it so that whenever two or more survivors start working on a generator, an alert is given to the killer and the generator is highlighted in yellow for X seconds depending on the perk level. 
---
The higher levels make it so that the generator is highlighted for longer, however, this is less useful since every time the timer expires, another alert is given to the killer and the generator is highlighted for another X seconds. This means that on lower levels, there are more frequent indicators on whether two survivors are still working on the generator, hence it is more useful.
---
It's a delay and people are acting like BHVR fucked someone's mother.
---
Obviously it's a little disappointing, but folk have no perspective.
---
WOW!!!!! Aliens are among us!!!!!
---
Do you have pc or console I want to watch some of your game plays
---
&gt; Any update will have bugs.
---
Not the way this game does. its way worse than with other games, and never improves.
---
Yeah bro don't you know lightborn is a top tier second chance perk /s
---
Ye but still you can get it
---
The only time I tunnel is when I they have OoO because fuck playing against SWF with object.
---
Yeah, except with BHVR's track record, it will most likely be late *and* still buggy.
---
If you live in the USA then no there shouldn't be, if there is then Sony/Playstation is insane to be selling those cards in the first place if you can't buy stuff with them.
---
For example, I buy a 20$ Steam card, I get 20$ steam credit, I can buy 20$ in Auric cells.
---
I mean more physical features he seems kinda bland and what per se his ability be they said they won't have any killers that mimic survivors
---
Telekinetic powers, duh.
---
You will never know that because there was never an announcement. Any number of things could cause it to be created or cancelled.
---
Unlikely due to super hard rights and whos the killer a zombie is too generic
---
I'm going to fucking hell laughing as hard as I did at this. Damn you.
---
For honor is Spooky
---
BDE
---
Seems like if she had hit everyone who was blocking she could have secured another down before someone made it out if she had gotten free.
---
Honestly only one of those survivor addons is toxic, the rest is no where near the same lvl as Prayer beads or Ebony mori or sprit
---
All I see is scrotum 🔵🔵
---
Whoever decided to lock event progression behind a major game addition should get slapped. Everything event related should always be on its own thing.
---
You mean Friday the 13th the game and last year the nightmare? (Yes I know the first one is dead. It still counts)
---
This sub ain’t as bad as Borderlands 3 with nerfs. 
---
But to tell upset people to calm down is the biggest mistake you can do.
---
Of course this upset person doesn’t like criticism lawl.
---
Jack Torrance looks scary as hell. That grin is chilling. And a perfect cosmetic for him being covered in snow with icicles hanging off his beard and eyebrows.   The hotel map would be super fun also.
---
Whiny killers/survivors think everything is toxic
---
Yeah this is on you bro, this is not an issue that I've seen anyone talk about.
---
Because it's literally putting your nuts on someone's body
---
Yeah that's fair. Gluskin was pretty insane for a Variant. Chris is big, but I don't think he's big enough to cause clipping. He's listed as like 6'9-6'10ish and just a bit more muscley than the Trapper if I remember correctly.
---
Because when it started it started as a harassment thing to make fun of others. 
---
It was never silly it was just to brag essentially. 
---
And it can get on other player nerves. Even in sports it happens but through different ways.
---
Thank you, my friend!
---
I'm probably overly pessimistic, but I was expecting it to be at least 2 weeks, possibly (though probably not) as much as 3.
---
Toxic survivor: bad
---
Toxic killer: good
---
Laugh now
---
Legion's only defining characteristic is a mask. Jack would still have that red stain and stuff. Maybe he'd even do something similar to huntress where he hums to himself to something. The power could be like, assistance from the spirits or something that takes a toll on survivors. Maybe something to help Jack himself as well, like a dash similar to demo's, but with some kind of change.
---
“Gaben? When are we getting the heavy update?”
---
“Soon my son, soon.”
---
“But when gaben?”
---
“I said SOON.”
---
I’m so glad you liked this chapter!
---
Yo can you find my dog i lost him
---
When the killer isn't very good and survivors teabag incessantly, it is insulting.
---
I’m having the same issue as well. I look at it, get into a game to do said daily and then find out after the match and after I’ve done whatever it was the daily wanted that it changed on me. It’s so infuriating.
---
&gt;never improves
---
Do you remember invisible chainsaw Myers?
---
I'd say they've done a pretty good job so far
---
BHVR has greed on par with EA, the expansions barely add anything to the game, and the game is pay to win... now that’s a couple of hot takes and a half. 
---
You’d be correct assuming we glance over the fact that they make a number of cosmetics and all non-licensed DLC’s free to anyone who’s willing to play for some time, each expansion adds new gameplay for both sides with each killer and the new perks everyone gets to play with, and even the perks belonging to licensed killers can be obtained with a bit of luck from the weekly shrine of secrets.
---
Let’s look at killers, as personally that’s what I’m most familiar with. The top two killers are widely accepted to be Nurse and Spirit, and below that it varies depending on who you ask, but most commonly 3rd place is given to Hag Hillbilly, or Huntress. All of those killers can be obtained without any money past actually buying the game itself. 
---
Some of the strongest perks you could run on killer are Ruin, BBQ, Nurses Calling, Enduring, Spirit fury, Whispers, Corrupt Intervention, STBFL, Discordance, and NOED. Of those, only BBQ and STBFL are perks that you must rely on the shrine for, as all others can be obtained by purchasing the killer with iridescent shards (if necessary) and playing them to their respective levels. Even without BBQ and for sure without STBFL, it’s more than possible to build a super strong build for high skill gameplay.
---
I used to be a nail biter too. I was so bad I would chew off the sides as well. I stopped after my husband told a server at a restaurant who asked if we wanted an appetizer that I was already eating mine. I didnt even know I was chewing them at the time. Ha! I felt like I needed to find a support group. Sometimes when they get too long I feel myself getting the urge to bite. It's a hard habit to stop. 
---
You deserve the positivity, you worked for it! 😊
---
What the fuck.. that's kinda hilarious but at the same time, yeah I'm questioning how that's being sold as a complete product. At least pull it and refund cells for the weapon only until they fix it..
---
Yeah you know what and why they are doing it, so what just ignore it and move on. Don't engage them in post game either or if they message you too are all things I learned from the early days of online gaming lol the amount of salty posts about killers/survivors being "toxic" is kind of like meh
---
"Trust" behavior. LOL. The only reason people are mad is because the community managers are shit. Their lack of communication is the root of all these problems. If people just KNEW ANYTHING we'd be fine. They literally don't tell anyone the event is delayed until the night before the event then they have the gall to blame the community for expecting it tomorrow. Their community managers don't actually manage the community they had WEEKS to dispel the rumors about the mid chapter patch coming today and a blood hunt.
---
i cant believe u done htis
---
Try to make a weapon!
---
that just means the spookiness wont end on too early
---
I just thought it was a cool mock cover, imagine my surprise when I got a full comic! Congrats on the great work op, keep it up!

Don’t ask me- ask the Telekinetic. I am not yet at that level.
---
Winterween sounds quite epic.
---
There might be hag traps somewhere in there, so be careful.
---
Probably got delayed to add more bugs tbh
---
yep. considering how easy it is to loop most killers with level designs that favor survivors, and then the fact that hitting a survivor actually rewards them with a speed boost while the killer gets an arbitrary cooldown animation AND loses bloodlust, NOED is more than fair to use as insurance.
---
Hell, if getting all the gens done wasn't so easy, survivors wouldnt use Adrenaline, they'd use something that helps them get to that point instead. yet adrenaline is a top 5 used perk.
---
Cliick the 3 little arrows by the chatbox in end game or the lobby chat and its closed til you open it again
---
I mean there is still like month left befire chapter comes out but you can keep them til then I guess
---
Ya I can't wait for the PC release my friends and I are excited to murder everything.
---
Identity V fan base is on the same boat don’t worry :,)
---
Wouldn’t whispers be more precise though? A survivor can touch your portal but by the time you teleport there they could be across the map.
---
Well of course you’re more likely to find toxic survivors. Because like you said, there are more survivors than killers. And especially now since matchmaking is all but nonexistent
---
That's BHVR for ya.
---
Increase in toxic survivor behavior = increase in posts hating on them
---
Not true. If a billy chainsaws you, you've been outplayed. It shouldn't realistically happen to good survivors the vast majority of the time.
---
Fungoose is a Plague main that very very rarely doesn’t 4k with Plague no addons at rank 1. Look him up
---
Meghead and BHVR save the bad prediction\*
---
I preffer the blue one
---
At least it still won’t feel like it’s in beta by that time lol.
---
GO to memeatic and make it realted to the game via text, boom all done
---
I hate plag with a passion
---
I mean if spirit gets gutted everyones going to flock to billy and history will repeat itself. Too many billies will equal people wanting nerfs for him as well
---
It's funny because this is true, but, if I remember the matchmaking algorithm correctly and it doesn't immediately find suitable players it will search for less suitable and then less suitable.
---
Until 15 to 30 minutes later it just says " fine, you know what? Fuck it! Heres 5 people, enjoy"
---
&gt; rank 1
---
&gt; rank4
---
&gt;rank 6
---
&gt; rank 19
---
&gt; rank 14 killer
---
Just skip the bullshit and do that in 3 minutes  because we all know thats where  were headed
---
I'll believe that when I see it. Right now it looks like the devs of LY pulled a Stomping Lands after they got that sweet Discord Exclusive deal and ran with the money.
---
Am I a coder or a game dev? No, I'm not. Which means I don't have the education or the training necessary to make a video game. They do. Therefore, there's a minimum level of competence expected from them. That's not nearly as much of a gotcha as you for some reason think it is.
---
Uuh, how about  Wraiths Bell? Or a little Medkit?
---
“Time, BHVR. Is it really that time again?”

It's never enough.

I'd love Jack Torrance or The Thing

Everyone is holding Behavior to these unreal expectations and then bitch when they fall short.
---
Here we see an egirl in her natural habitat
---
*HA*
---
I think he should inherently see scratch marks for longer periods of time than other killers, and with each completed gen it gets longer and longer, until he’s potentially seeing scratch marks everywhere. (Lorewise going crazier, gameplay wise stronger in the beginning.) Maybe he could chop downed pallets with a normal strike, saving time. But the scratch marks is literally how he was beat in the end: someone doubled back on their trail and he completely got lost.

So ten bucks 70 days to get to 100? Or ten for seventy tiers
---
Np, the game gets alot better when it's shut
---
Identity V went to PC? When was this?
---
Iron grasp is pretty doo doo, whispers on huntress is very good. Monitor and abuse is good, since e lullaby isn’t directional anymore. Huntress Lullaby is not good at all in my opinion. Nurses calling is quite good as well.
---
Ren is the only character who could visually represent that level of emotional exhaustion.
---
Yeah or on lerys mirror is so fun
---
For pig
---
"We are aware of an issue that causes the Pigs reversed beartraps to give the survivors an extra health state instead of killing them. However we decided to leave it in because it seems like a fair addition to prevent the Pig from being far to strong."
---
I know this sounds weird but I hope they do more recolors. Specifically the neon Legion skin could be so cool with green, yellow, orange, or pink. 
---
Getting something like Wax Warlock Wraith with red candles could be cool too.
---
I'm not doubting it lol This is the hive-mind people talk about, and why people get instantly banned in his chat the moment they point out his flaws as he does to literally everyone else.
---
Had a guy with mirror and M&amp;A. Got scared shitless.
---
You are a blatant troll. Have a shit day
---
"COWAAAAARRRDDD!!!"
---
I don't understand what you're saying. Decisive strike absolutely got nerfed into its current state. You can say it's too strong, and you may even be right, but I don't see how anyone could say that DS is stronger now than pre-nerf. It used to be game ruiningly OP.
---
Are any of these going to happen? No.
---
Is it still nice to daydream? Yes.
---
Do these look cool? Yes.
---
CHANIBAL
---
hmmm cannibal-chan?
---
It's the exact same.  Once you finish the action it will break the hook for the same duration as if you used  toolbox.
---
It's not a good idea either
---
Now this is an avengers level threat!
---
Ah yes, more posts demanding the good killer be nerfed now that nurse got nerfed.
---
I mostly enjoy it because I’m a fan of the show itself - it would do with a few changes though. First off, they need to get rid of the crows which fly into the ceiling, they don’t make sense. Add a system similar to Preschool and Haddonfield where the lights flicker depending on nearby generators. Make some of the pallets more safe, particularly in the corridor sections - you could use doors and the nearby rooms to loop around the walls themselves, instead of spamming boxes and barrels all over the place. Make the stairs and upstairs sections safer - add a pallet or two into the hallway upstairs, rearrange the rooms so that they could follow a layout similar to killer shack with an added window nearby to loop into, then add another pallet or mindgame onto the stairs sections somehow. Add a few more windows downstairs, and make parts more open - the main problem with this map, similar to Lerys, is excessive walls. The walls make it very difficult to navigate and know where you are going. Naturally, it is an indoor map so this will always be quite restrictive, but you could instead add procedurally generated signs or coloured lights on the walls which signal the tile types for each room, and maybe even the direction towards key locations (ie. the portal room and that long room with the two white tanks on the catwalks). Lastly, add another window inside of the glass room - that room is a death trap without balanced landing.
---
Quentin has the all seeing eye
---
Enti-, i mean nea is a switch FYI
---
I would love to have Mac as a survivor. What a badass
---
No, using a hooked survivor as bait to secure additional kills is the best method to do so.  Anyone that calls this camping is just bothered you are not playing the way they want you to.
---
Yeah pretty much, the way they run things the event could mean the allotted time for.the cosmetics to.be on sale xD I doubt it though imagine the blowback
---
Why do you think he looks sad

---
Thanks! I found the template and it made me laugh too so thought I’d share.
---
You know this sub is full of people who go on rants about people being toxic for teabagging and there's multiple posts about that and similar situations right? Lol
---
 Being reasonable isn't something I'd expect but I'm 100% with you
---
Definitely his middle name!
---
i actually am tbh as i’ve heard that me and others (don’t know if everyone) on ps4 are facing issues where we literally can’t play, it’s been happening for a good two weeks for me anyway so if it gets fixed before the event i’d love that. 
---
those who are interested in more info on the problem i have a post with the full details in the comments as i’m still doubtful it is a thing for people on ps4 so any other opinions on it would be greatly appreciated.
---
every fixed bug spawns new ones, often worse than before. overall, it stays just as bugged.
---
just use corrupt intervention literally a better ruin that is consistent
---
I did! Check out the link in my main comment to see the rusty bone saw I made.
---
Legitimately dbd is the only game that the majority of the community believes DC is the an efficient and righteous counter against meta or optimal build.

It feels like pc players dc a lot more often than PS4 it players

Lmao rdr2 been getting weird zombie - related Easter eggs from rockstar all year and nothing so far
---
People DC for leatherface??
---
I knew you were dummy but I didn't know you were this dummy
---
OoO and insta-heals aren’t directly related to toxic behavior though. It just so happens that some toxic assholes use those mechanics. Toxicity hasn’t “increased” it fluctuates and it’s almost 100% random on a match to match basis. Ya get some shitty players and ya get some nice players which is how any online game works. It doesn’t just increase.
---
Will need to level Plague for that first.

And yeah, I am really thinking about it once I get it.

Is there a way to change the chase music via file editing? I am getting really sick of hearing the same tho g over and over agin,

No, this game right now has no game breaking bugs like it has in the past. I can’t really think of too many bugs right now aside from the occasional game getting cancelled or nurse animation wonkiness. There’s still bugs obviously but I don’t come across anything that really detracts from my experience
---
Last month, I was playing at 3am, got in a match with a level 12 Killer, 2 Level 19 and a level 20. I was the third person hooked (my first hook) and died on hook (no one even looked my way). I was in comms with friends who were playing other things and I was so mad it led to the now most quoted line in my discord: "They bad, that is toxic"
---
Welcome to the internet!
---
The movie?
---
Thank you so much&lt;3
---
Neither are flashlights and instantheals. They’re items in the game and yes they are powerful, but using them doesn’t make you toxic.
---
I am all ´bout those internet arrows.

My cousin Hanry told me he once build an house for it in DC, oooh boy, new kind of farming i tell ya.

I legit never been able to escape the game. Fuck the game

I'm always worried pigs will think I'm trying to be toxic if I try to boop the snoot

They'll have more of those delicious hair 'optimisation', now with everyone's hair flying away as you do rush actions.

You could but you'd be banned near immediately for editing things to give you an advantage (excluding perk/killer icons) and potentially cheating

Hello all, hope you enjoyed my character concept! I think he would be a [cool and unique addition.](https://movieposters2.com/images/1374013-b.jpg)
---
This happened to me last night. I got hooked first didn't struggle so there was time. Ash was 10 feet from me working on a Gen. Killer and the other 2 team mates were on the complete opposite end of the map, he was chasing them and Ash didn't even try to save me he just kept working in the gen and let me hang until 2nd phase and continue to not help until I ran out of time and died. I wouldn't be mad if he was lower ranked I'm rank 10, he was rank 11 the other 2 team mates were ranks 18 and 20. One I was grouped with it was his first match ever and was trying to escape to killer. So he couldn't help me. Ash needed too but didn't!
---
Blocked that Ash so I hopefully don't get matched with him again
---
Dead by daylight is complex and they will make mistakes but they are taking time to fix their mistakes. But that causes people to bitch about the bugs and bitch about the delays. Then they start talking out their ass saying that Behavior is incompetent when they themselves admit they don't have the education or training necessary to understand what Behavior is doing.  I imagine in your profession their are the people who bitch because they don't understand the process is more complicated than what the customer sees. Just cut them some slack they are human.

Honest question, why was this event so late to begin with? For a Halloween event I would think they’d do it in early to mid october. Definitely not 9 days away from Halloween
---
Why should I give a complete stranger on the internet my undivided attention, I am perfectly capable of using grammar but why bother if im not being marked or anything. You are clowning yourself
---
I’d think changing the chase music wouldn’t be classified as cheating, just like editing survivor icons isn’t considered cheating. I couldn’t think of any immediate way that different chase music would give anyone an advantage over another player.
---
I’m aware that what I’m about to tell you sounds really convenient for me to make up as a point, but I’d even go to say that even 1 out of 4 killers I go against are toxic, but I should clarify, that I’m in green ranks, so that could be the reason behind my original statement and opinions.

I feel like it would fit better if he was wrapped in Christmas lights, as a nod to Stranger Things. We already have Santa clown
---
Now everyone has their own idea of fun, but I personally do not find prayer beads spirit fun at all to go against. It’s just annoying. I’m not staying for that
---
Same thing with scratched mirror Myers on the institute
---
I’m not entertaining jump scare games
---
Yes because obviously: 1 escape = complete and utter defeat.
---
That I can agree they need better testing but better testing means more delays it's a balance between releasing a pile of shit or delaying a polished feature.

Surviver: what happened to the pallet
---
Killer:gone... reduced to atoms
---
One can hope
---
I’m not disagreeing. In fact I’m agreeing with most of what you’re saying. I’m getting a vibe that says you may think I am
---
it is literally cheating since you could change the music to be extremely low, giving you an advantage over people using the standard music by being able to hear survivors a lot easier.
---
Cant wait for christmalloween for It to drop
---
Don't know how thats going to be possible, Im pretty much done here. Egirls like this don't deserve my time or attention, I love a good argument but if its quite clear that the person feeds off of attention and initiates brainless arguments for a mere response to get those dopamine receptors up and running im not going to even bother
---
Oh I know that. 
---
I just thought that it would be fun to make survivors work for their DS. 
---
Would also help to slow down gens, if survivors are given other objectives.
---
In that case you propose not to announce anything at all. As to me, on the other hand, I want info
---
Great work 👍
---
Be active with your camera and really listen to what's happening around you. run Spine Chill
---
This, a million times this.
---
It's not just good, it's totally beautiful
---
I was talking about survivor chase music. I guess hearing the chase music as killer would be cool too. Demegorgan cant even hear his own theme properly because god knows why.
---
No I’ve seen this before with games and know exactly where this is going. This is a seriously mis managed company that needs to get their priorities straight, just done with BhVR in general, none of you people get what’s going on and just keep cuddling them. Look at reddit today allot of people are on the same page as what I’ve posted. But go ahead keep making excuses...

The guide to a pefect win against doctor 
---
Step 1: pick your favorite survivor 
---
Step 2: pick out the best meta perks
---
Step 3: do a gen
---
Step 4: attempts to do a gen and fails skill check
---
Step 5: run away like the brave rank 4 you are
---
Step 6: hide in a bush cause you picked claudette
---
Step 8: scream causes its the doctor
---
Step 9: realize you skipped step 7 and it's going all down hill
---
Step 10: run around looking for pallets
---
Step 11: get caught by the doctor cause you ran into an open field
---
Step 12: get hooked and left to struggle 
---
Step 13: get rescued
---
Step 14: all gens pop
---
Step 15: adrenaline pops
---
Step 16: leave behind teammates and open exit gates
---
Step 17: killer has blood warden
---
Step 18: Die
---
Because nobody likes his jokes?
---
At the end it looks like Quentin is hailing Hitler.
---
I was legit thinking that. It would fit the theme too.
---
Haven't laughed at a meme on this sub in many moons. Many, many, many moons.

You can enjoy a game and recognize its flaws because you know, standards. But I know they're not for everyone.

"HAHAHAHAHA!  You have no power here, Legion!"- Injured survivors
---
No, Just feels shitty to have it used against you by rushing the hook right after you hook a survivor.

I don't know but if that is true that would definitely be a factor. Also if thats the main factor they should probably start with that when explaining the delays.
---
Same man. I'm actually currently dumping all my points in it to get P3 while playing surv/other killers but the few times I play him I feel like such a noob lol
---
Holy shit those look really good

No perk in the game is. Just the way it's used.

Thank you!

Once you get a ghost face that face camps you and tea bags you for the full two minutes you'll understand. Or a SWF that destroys you and spams tea bag at exit while calling you names and slurs in post game. Tea bagging is not toxic by itself but rather almost always accompanied by other toxic behavior. So where there's smoke there's fire is usually what happens with tea bagging.
---
Now I do
---
Your whole argument is circular. “You’re am entitled brat because you expect something because you’re an entitled brat.” You are strawmanning what I’m saying. You are calling me names. You are telling me what I believe when I am telling you that I don’t believe these things. What would you call it. 
---
___
---
Is it entitlement of me to expect something when I’m told to expect something? No. But you have the logic of a 5 year old and you’ll somehow twist it to say yes. So you’re a troll.
---
yet you are wasting your time arguing with a complete stranger on the internet. hmmm
---
I heard that from Paulie Esther's video. Idk if it's true either.
---
I mean I like it alright. With addons Billy is strong enough you can run whatever you want, and NOED will let you beat good survivors on good loops faster than chainsaw will alone.
---
It'll also help you hang in there on really difficult Billy maps.
---
damn i’m deleting and redownloading it tonight to see if that helps but seeing it definitely is nothing to do with nat i don’t know what to do, some people have said there experiencing it but now that you say that just worries me more, i’ll also file a report to support to see if i can get help there because honestly i’m all out on ideas at this point . bu thx anyway for responding.

I mean that survivor was already in exit gates so. I mean yeah that survivor failed but it has nothing to do with how good you play. So this 'do not mock me' bravado looks ridiculous

All good mate. Best of luck

id love to know what your definition of an egirl is since you seem to be unaware of what it means. if you think me being a woman and arguing with someone and expressing my opinion online means i am an egirl that wants attention, then i'm afraid you're being sexist and definitely not as smart as you'd like to think you are. i guess women cant argue without being reduced to a stereotype, amirite?
---
Is their gonna be double blood points
---
It's just how it goes and even the littlest of changes requires a full qa regression test and if was find something then delays happen.

New Killer: The Cyclops
---
Otz is definetly my new favorite. He is good, he is wholesome and he is funny. My trapper game has improved massively and since he streams alot and long i have entertainment every day.
---
Looking at the wrong memes then friend.
---
You still need to report on the scoreboard screen. Then upload the video somewhere and submit a ticket on the [support site](https://support.deadbydaylight.com), but the link to the video in the ticket. Uploading it as an attachment to the ticket won't work for most videos because it's meant for small attachments like screenshots.
---
It's done and posted if you wanna see it
---
A bear trap? At this time in the trial, at this time after therapy, in this part of Lery's, located entirely outside that window?
---
Excuse me sir, survivors rarely play vs spirit normally, everyone is sick of this killer so I kinda speed up the timer of already lost game. I'm playing on red ranks so yeah spirit mains there definitely will down you easily.
---
It's done and posted atm
---
Pyramid head would be fucking perfect.
---
well i mean dbd isnt alone r6s still didnt launch the halloween event
---
It mean the killer doesn't see you if you're 24 meters away from his terror radius, 2 stacks he doesn't see you if you're &gt;48 meters from his radius, et cetera.
---
Sprint burst was revealed after the game, though i initially suspected lithe.
---
And Michael’s just got a hand on his shoulder like “bro...”
---
Can someone please explain the appeals of adrenaline, unbreakable and bloodwarden please? 
---
I dun get it
---
Doctor: Ah, SHIT
---
ZOOOOP
---
Pretty complicated. Would love to see Bateman in the game anyway, and I think a tier system where he becomes increasingly disheveled and unhinged would be neat, but any more than like 5 tiers and the tooltip gets a little ridiculous.
---
Or, you know, leave :/
---
if we get the thing (and he looks/power behaves in a terrifying manor)
---
I will literally cream myself
---
Excuse me, did I hurt your feelings? I hope I did not. I do not bm with flashlight weak killers. You guys are so touchy seriously 40 dislikes.
---
Yea. Maybe wrapped in the lights but also with the hat to make a full outfit. I think the lights would be more likely be a body piece instead of head.
---
I am the same. I only return for events and they have been abysmal/non-existent this year. Now they aren't even releasing the Halloween event on time? Ridiculous.
---
Honestly they had to have known at the latest that they wouldn't be able to iron out the bugs a couple of days ago. Just make an announcement, like "hey we're working hard to iron out some major bugs and ship the update as bug-free as possible, but there's a possibility we might not be able to make the start date and need to delay it a little. Sorry if that happens!" and people would be more understanding of the situation.
---
But announcing "btw event delayed lol" and giving no additional details with ETA 12 hours to the event start? Yeah, that's why a lot of people are mad right now. The lack of transparent communication is what people are upset about.
---
Because isn’t down on melee gives you way more chanses of survival than instant down on range.
---
Where can i find the patch notes for the new update ?
---
Honestly I don't think it's much better for survivors either except for benefiting from the killer bullshit.
---
Gotta agree there fung min
---
Wow, rotate the picture before you post it lol
---
This is how I scare one of my friends who is *terrified* of the song
---
So there was a mid-chapter patch date planned or what?
---
I dont know about that one chief. Aside from the dedicated servers I've rarely seen BHVR delay or release things in a broken state? At least not recently. The only exception was Chapter 10 but that was more of an exceptional and somewhat unforeseen set of circumstances.
---
Broken promises I can definitely say has never happened. BHVR has never once in all my memory said anything that didn't come to pass. Every amendment or new content added to the game has been done so since it was announced with the exception of a small handful of things due to community input/backlash.
---
The only issue is the dedicated servers. But saying they have "repeatedly failed to deliver on promises and **basic expectations**" seems a little misleading to say. I have critiques of BHVR's development of DbD but this isn't meaningful criticism imo.
---
I know that lol i meant where in hell was he i can't find him
---
I don't get offended but i tunnel and camp the guy who did the tbag then tbag him back with the ghost face while im camping him, pretty fun :D
---
It's not completely wrong info. I know a out the Archives, event and all the other stuff. So I personally would keep it that way.
---
Poor thing, you can't kill any survivors with other killers? You get bullied all the time, well guess what! You suck as killer! The only one you can play is spirit. Get good, pleb. Aahahah dead hard op oops, did not know. Thanks for telling me my perk number one, Jesus I bet even your spirit is super shit.
---
Do you have a ps4?
---
Only in cringy hentai versions.
---
Congratulations. 👏
---
I'm too drug-free for that
---
I'm pretty sure he was just insane
---
You have it all wrong. “Whales” will surely max out their battlepasses ASAP but the battlepass makes them money by forcing whoever buys it to keep playing everyday in order to “get their moneys worth” (aka max the battlepass). Since they are playing everyday they are less likely to quit playing the game and will continue to buy new cosmetics and chapters when they release. 
---
If they get upset with the game later down the line they will be less inclined to fully commit to “leaving” the game because they’ve invested so much time and money in the game.
---
Don't let us stop you.  This is amazing.
---
If youre hooked and the last gen gets popped while youre still hooked, when you get unhooked, you'll be at full health rather than being injured and you'll have the speedboost the second you hit the ground.
---
Basically being hooked delays Adrenaline triggering until youre unhooked
---
[The Siege event launches tomorrow ](https://youtu.be/s6IiJIeOt1U)
---
The devs infuriate me sometimes with their lack of competency in certain areas...
---
But this is still my favourite game right now (and has been for a while), and no delayed event or buggy patches will convince me otherwise.
---
As bikini said, we will get the Halloween event in December.
---
All the spooky ladies!
---
&gt;I’ve rarely seen BHVR delay things
---
If you don’t mind me asking, how long have you been playing? I don’t mean to sound rude, I just want to know the range of time we both have been playing. Because to be honest, there’s so much that I wouldn’t know where to start.
---
&gt;Broken promises I can definitely say has never happened
---
&gt;The only issue is the dedicated servers
---
What I can say though, is that you kind of contradict yourself. BHVR outright said “Servers coming in Summer 2019” and then had to say “Sorry, we gotta delay it”. If that isn’t breaking a promise I don’t know what is.
---
If my boss asked me for a project and I said I’d have it done this week, and then on Saturday I told him that it wasn’t ready, I broke my promise.
---
Edit: there are of course other examples of broken promises, but I’d just thought I’d use the most notable and recent.
---
&gt;Saying they’ve failed to deliver on basic expectations is misleading
---
This is a three year old game that still has bugs and issues like an Alpha. That’s absurd. I’ll give them a pass on the servers on this point, because they had no clue DBD would blow up and servers were out of the question, so the game was built around that.
---
Why did you get download? Lol
---
Movie version was just insane, which if I'm not mistaken, was one of the reasons King disliked it so much.
---
Book version was possessed by the hotel and its ghosts.
---
It’s actually really good, fell off a bit right at the end in the elevator but other than that it was great
---
It's not a matter of "priorities" or "management." They're literally separate teams working on different things. The people making skins and working on the graphics and art are not gonna stop doing what they do because the people implementing content had some issues getting a patch ready in time.
---
And of course people are disappointed. A lot of them are trash talking the devs and making shitty memes like this one, but it's not gonna change anything. It's not making the patch come sooner, and it's not affecting the devs in any way... other than making them feel bad about disappointing their fans, and I think they already feel bad enough. 
---
There's also no way to know how BHVR's being managed or what their priorities are without being on the inside. They've been steadily releasing new content every three months, and then they have a small delay and everyone loses their minds. Like I said, people just need to chill out.
---
His wink gets me the most. I love it. He's such a great guy
---
Recognizing the flaws is different from simply bitching. Not everyone understands that tho.
---
I'm talking traps. So disarming traps becomes sabotaging? And they break?
---
All of these replies.  XD  They do me good. XD
---
I don't play on console so I didn't follow those launches. But you bring up a good point their boss is breathing down their neck so we don't need to.
---
Ace looks like a cool grandpa that you'd share a six pack with
---
To be fair, people are still mad at Blizzard for the whole blitzchung thing, so I wouldn’t be surprised if their numbers are low.
---
Confirmed... cursed.
---
But wouldn't the go off the movie and not the book since the movie is more well know
---
Adrenaline is a crutch perk for low skill players. It's as bad as moris, keys, and noed. Unbreakable punishes slugging which is nice. Bloodwarden is kinda fun unless they take noed too. It spices the end game up. It's easily countered by just leaving the gate at 99% until everyone is ready though.
---
I was making a joke like you but you're gonna spend your time making fun of someone instead of ignoring it.
---
Congratulations.👏
---
People have done it before. They're just still images or something. Yeah it would be cool but overall a useless feature as it would make the game harder to run and no one would really look at them due to doing gens and being chased/chasing
---
I don't think ppl who DC vs spirit will get banned. Forums and Reddit are full of posts asking to nerf her or her addons, and ppl are full of her shit so I bet there are many people who DC vs spirit. Once they see the statistics I bet devs will react differently.
---
I think it’s okay, it isn’t incredibly hard to follow. Hardest thing to design besides this would be addons.
---
Saw my first Joey this week.  Fucking A.  Looked awesome.  He was also chill in post-game chat.  I don't mind Legion at all. :)
---
May I disarm it?
---
Does that only happen with Hag? I have that same thing on my Hag and no other killers
---
Dude, this is the best way to respond to toxic messages lmao
---
Same with Fallout 76 *don't shoot me*
---
Because not everyone can be this awesome.
---
How much am I gonna have to pay for either a kick starter or a patreon I need this pronto
---
What was the joke tho. 
---
Too many words for me. Congrats. 👍
---
I’m not going back!
---
i feel like you're missing the point of the outrage. No one is really mad about the delay itself, so much as it being communicated so poorly. I honestly just kinda think BHVR just needs some better PR, otherwise I'd agree with you, but like many others here I was stoked and didn't even know about this because I don't use twitter much.
---
Maternal parent would have done better. Downvoted....but also upvoted.
---
REEEE TOO MANY BUGS AND THEY STILL HAVE EVENTS  
---
REE DELAYED EVENT BECAUSE IT HAD BUGS  
---
guys pls
---
Not far off park st.
---
99ing gates is to prevent the endgame countdown from starting. If people are getting hooked after all the gens are done, you should try to 99 both gates before rescuing otherwise rescuing someone doesn't matter. They'd still have no way out.
---
I seriously hate when people open the gates with someone down or hooked. We now have 3 minutes to get them, and if someone else gets downed or hooked, we start losing our grip on the countdown.
---
It's not just his features I just don't know what his ability would be since there doesn't seem to be any thing I can grasp at
---
Stfu im listening to waluigi pinball
---
From my experience she’s fine. And my only experience with her is as a survivor.
---
You don't really have a choice in that situation. It's not your fault.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Ah thanks
---
🤦‍♂️
---
The walk is a bit to slow and if they speed it up I would imagine it would be a bit clunky
---
Im pretty sure they are preparing for a F2P launch. The game has so many free weekends, was free on PS+ and Xbox game pass and the last 3 DLCs have all been licensed. Mobile version is in the works too. Wouldnt be surprised they make it F2P soon.
---
She out here hustlin
---
SHARP
---
She doesn't have any reason to waste her time making them broken and the vomit counters the sound benefit from NM. They'll get sick anyway. Kind of a buff for her.
---
If a trap is armed you must first disarm it before you can sabotage it.  A disarmed trap can still be recovered and rearmed by the Trapper.  After you disarm it, you will get the prompt to sabotage it.  Be warned that the Trapper gets a sound notification whenever someone disarms a trap, so you may not have time to sabotage it before he gets there.
---
This post was made better because right above it on my screen was a promoted post about the Rocket League *Stranger Things* Halloween event
---
Their boss is breathing down their neck because the biggest horror game out there fucked up their Halloween event. Literally the one event they can’t fuck up and yet here we are lol.
---
Adrenaline: An instant heal AND sprint burst in one perk. If you're currently in chase not only does the killer now need to hit you an extra time, but you get a free exhaustion perk (that works even if currently exhausted). If you're injured with 1 gen left you save ~32 seconds of time by not having to heal before completing the last gen, because you know you'll get healed for free just by it completing. If you're slugged, you're no longer slugged without a teammate having to waste time coming to heal you.
---
Unbreakable: That last upside scenario of Adrenaline, but on command. Especially at higher ranks killers will often slug survivors for multiple reasons: whether because of Decisive Strike, because they see another immediate chase opportunity, they need to put more pressure on the map, or simply to waste survivor time. Whatever the reason, Unbreakable can negate a down/soft hook which is basically a big ol' Uno Reverse card to a killer, now that time he spent chasing and downing you was for naught, and doesn't waste other survivors' time having to run and heal you (plus it can literally save entire games for survivors if the killer is slugging)
---
Blood Warden: More of a meme perk, but once the exit gates are open the survivors have 2 minutes to leave--extended if somebody is down or hooked. If you hook somebody and blood warden activates, now the survivors are stuck with nowhere useful to go for an entire minute. If you manage to death hook somebody and get blood warden to activate, now effectively *half* of the survivors' time to escape is gone, since the timer won't be slowed down and blood warden lasts a minute. So you have a free minute to down more survivors with little counterplay (at the end of the game most pallets are likely used, and there are no other useful places for survivors to go other than stick near the exits) but this perk isn't nearly as useful as the other 2
---

I can't wait to see all the top killers get nerfed and then Freddy becomes the greatest.

The director is a pedophile. Have to pay him for the rights to have the franchise in the game.
---
Saw this a few days ago...
---
Fucked if I knew. Just nothing more intimidating then getting that photo with a foreign language caption
---
&gt;I just started playing Spirit
---
There's your problem
---
Yeah I should've clarified I was playing Trapper for my daily and he's level 1. Only started playing like a month ago so I still a baby especially in terms of any killer other than Myers, I main survior more and when I play killer it's always Myers haha
---
Yes, Yamaoka is the worst map in the game for me. I hate it both as survivor and killer, just don’t have fun on it
---
"Evan! The map is on fire!"
---
"No, father. It's just the endgame collapse."
---
You’re gonna be IP banned so no one in a 5 mile radius of you can ever play DBD again.
---
legion is probably one of the worst killers in rhe game
---
When did they announce the Hallow blight event time? iirc, Not_Queen said on the forums that it never had an ETA.
---
EDIT: they said it was coming out with the Mid-Chapter patch, but they never gave an ETA for that, so they didn't promise a time.
---
As much as I'd pay to see it, if spirit gets gutted then its just billy and huntress for top tier
---
I noticed it too but also wrote it off because of the boycotting.
---
I never said I paid for the event, but any other words you wanna put in my mouth?
---
I don’t think he holds the rights to Jeepers anymore
---
I... wha... you do know that the delay of the event has no hinderance on what you’ve already paid for, only on what’s to come, right? Or is this a whoosh on my part? God, I hate sarcasm on the internet...
---
Hopefully we get it for more than a fucking week. I have no idea why they wouldn’t run the event longer.
---
Team fortress 2 was super early this year
---
I'll add to it, A Convicted child sexual abuser.
---
he only directed the 3rd movie i think i could be wrong even so that has nothing to do with the actors. i dont count the third movie it sucked ass but the original was scary as hell
---
edit: he did direct the first one but he himself wouldn't profit from it
---
Yeah

Literally Dev Confirmed
---
It depends when exactly you stopped, but there's a new ranking system based on these things called emblems instead of bloodpoints. You can hover over them after a game and see what you need to improve on.
---
Play Hawkins Lab as the Hag/Spirit/Plague and you will win 90% of the time
---
Noob3 having a what?
---
No, this person just wants to complain because despite the insane amount of content already attached to the game, they didn't get the event that exact time and date it was specified so it's tantrum time
---
If you don’t have BBQ &amp; Chili, I’d get Leatherface. Myers is fun as hell and has some pretty good perks.
---
I always recommend Myers in these threads.
---
*cough cough* YOU'LL NEVER SEE IT COMING
---
But BHVR is a Canadian company and Canada already had Thanksgiving so this event is late- 
---
Oh. Yeah, that's on brand.
---
No he directed all of them.
---
The mid chapter patch was never given an eta. The Hallowed Blight and Archives was announced to be released on October 22nd.
---
Yeah, that was after it had gotten leaked by LeaksByDaylight, and after Peanits said that the bloodhunt wasn't Deb confirmed.
---
Sure! How are the words, "thanks devs for the insane amount of content for the game we've received so far, I understand that a game like this takes time and a lot of effort to update, don't worry if something's gone wrong, I can wait patiently instead of being an asshole!" 
---
Do those words work for you?
---
Really? I swear this isn't a repost. I might've posted it a few days ago and deleted it. Isn't there a repost bot thingy on this sub?
---
Ya you bought the game and you bought the dlc. However, you didn't buy the event and now you are complaining because they delayed the free event to give you a better experience. Thats text book entitlement.
---
I had someone say "Nice camping" and say I was a "shitty person" for camping their hook when the gates were open and one of their teammates was hiding behind a box 5 feet away. The fuck did they want me to do? Go hit their teammate so they can unhook for free? Walk away in a random direction? So dumb.
---
Leatherface is not a high-tier killer but has one of the most important perks in the game: BBQ and Chili which is very helpful for grinding.
---
Oh lol my bad I read it wrong I wish they’d come back too
---
You have to ask someone else, all I remember is that he hacked the game to get his legacy he lost back, and got banned. He changed, but please do your research, too.
---
True, i guess theyd just have to make it so he traveled further per step, but then he'd glide a bit.
---
In a perfect world yes
---
Pretty sure you can still get a total of 2 sets (or 6 pieces) for free. And additionally the cosmetic sets will also be available in the Rift.
---
This is just speculation on my part though and this might not have been the problem you were addressing
---
Is anyone gonna tell him?
---
Considering most other reply’s are whooshing him, its many others opinions as well. And I said sorry ya cunt. Sorry.

Did you translate it because if you did I want to know what it says

Because they don't want to murder their entire team by turning her into a machine gun.  Learn to loop and be comfortable while injured.  2 skills required for any competent teamate.  Your cleanse puts everyone at risk.
---
Yes, thank you very much, sorry for my bad english im actually brazillian :p
---
And...is that not dev confirmation that the bloodhunt was going to happen? It doesnt matter if it got leaked, they confirmed that it was real soon before it started.
---
Either way, they have cancelled/moved bloodhunts in the past that have been leaked, so youre being misleading in a thread for helpful answers to questions. Not_Queen/Peanits literally said yesterday on the forums that there is not a planned bloodhunt at the moment and if they do not confirm it themselves, then it isnt set in stone.
---
I’m throwing a tantrum lol? I could literally not give a fuck about this games stupid events where gens and hooks are slightly different colors than normal lol. I’m just not gonna sit here and defend devs who fail to meet deadlines 9 times out of 10. Between this event, dedicated servers coming out “at the end of summer”, etc, these devs need to just avoid giving themselves deadlines.
---
I’ll let her know! &lt;3
---
Okay so I checked my files, I originally created this a day ago and posted it. If you saw it yesterday then it's me. If not, then me and someone else have very similar experiences on dbd
---
Eh... at least the dude did his time and is [seemingly] following all the laws now.
---
According to that logic this movie would never have been made as it was post conviction and serving of the sentence.
---
Hehehehe
---
Oh man, I just watched this.  Calibri Green could be a scary as hell map.  Could you imagine?  Multiple floors of apartments with holes in the walls and ceilings.  An outside path with chainlink blocking it and a giant bonfire burning outside.  All of the creepy artwork painted on concrete walls.  That choir singing in the background.  Chilling.  I guess you could have Helen Lyle as a survivor too and stick some neat obsession perks in the mix.
---
I fucking love this! It looks amazing and your gonna get all the treats for halloween!😁
---
&lt;3&lt;3 thank you
---
Definitely sounds like a tantrum my dude
---
I just want to see some Blight killers in the game. I see a lot of Blight Jakes but no one seems to want to spend their cash for the killers.
---
Are you two morons still arguing?
---
Also way to waste your money on StarScam.
---
Lolololol
---
Either way it’s one of the most ridiculously flawed and poorly made games out there which is inexcusable for the amount of money they have
---
And now you are complaining about him? That’s the same as staying in earshot and saying “God, Stacy has such a trash dress, it makes me want to HURL. XD”. You are right, but you need to be considerate. Try and teach people, or use humor, don’t berate.
---
They could. But it's still ETA so now it won't be long. For me it's better than silence.
---
on some real shit who in Hollywood isn't? im not in anyway defending that pos but in the last couple of years there has been alot of people accused.
---
Yeah np dude I saw you were trying to help him out. You had really good points too
---
Do you mainly play survivor?
---
Alright, give him the stick... DON'T GIVE HIM THE STICK!
---
Shaun teachable perk- Zombie

For every generator completed lose 3/2/1% movement speed but gain x/x/x meters of aura shrouding from the killer.

"Nothing personnel kid"

Even with his dark lore Trapper didn't even want to help the entity. Which is why he has hooks and shrapnel in him.
---
The facts are there somewhere, and here is bitching
---
Even with noed they could've got them. It's a thing some survivors still dont know but you can prevent a pick up by healing the player, so by everyone healing then running when he goes for swings it allows the downed player to inch their way to the exit
---
Thanks OwO
---
I already planned to pull an all-nighter comming friday, better be out by then
---
you monster. jk lol
---
OG Doom was inspired by evil dead
---
From what I can remember, employees at valve are allowed to work on whatever they please.
---
Obviously most employees make the sane decision to not work on adding more stuff to a spaghetti-code filled game that is literally over a decade old.
---
I am well aware of how easily Spirit can down people in red ranks, seeing as I main Spirit in reds (as well as Clown, but let's not divert from the topic too much now). That doesn't change the circumstances though. You are just bailing on survivors who dont care which killer it is, and actually want to make it out. It just takes away from those who supposed to be your allies and makes it harder for them because you don't like the matchup.
---
Do you have an idea I would like to hear them if you do
---
I've played Battlefield for years, tried a few other games along side it, but none of them stuck.  I got dbd with ps+ and loved it from the start.  I've played regularly since then.  It's the only game that has been able to take me away from Battlefield!  I happily play them both :)
---
Holy shit really that’s pretty cool
---
“Power outage”
---
I bet he sees this and mentions it in a stream later
---
I barely play her and I'm consistently a rank 1 killer and survivor. I've done it with Huntress, Billy, Pig, New Legion and Nurse. I just like having a chance to win every game.
---
No game, ever, should be a free win (See good survivors Vs every killer not called Spirit or Nurse) or a free loss (Survivors vs Omega Blink Nurse or Prayer Beads Spirit).
---
Strong Killers can exist. She's not OP. Only 2 of her addons are, which I do WANT to be nerfed.
---
Tbh that combo is good on every killer but nurse because, at the end of the day, you're still going to be eating pallets.
---
uh...yeah. its why they had to delay the archives livestream.
---
This game is a love hate relationship. But always more Love than hate. See you in the fog.

Well, it's the only multiplayer horror game still standing at the moment.

Overwatch's event has been out for like a week.
---
Wait bro off topic but I stopped watching walking dead at the end of season 8(negan defeated) because it was boring and dragged
---
Is it worth watching the rest? Idk who beta is just searched it
---
I still have the game and plan on playing tonight. I’m just not gonna sit here and defend devs who fuck shit up time and time again because hey they’re trying guys. If the devs aren’t responsible enough to hit their deadlines  maybe they need to stop announcing dates  for their events, servers, etc. Not to mention announcing that the event is delayed because of vague “unforeseen circumstances” with less than 24 hours to go when they’ve clearly known for at least a few days that the event wasn’t gonna happen. This whole thing is not a good look for the devs, but if you want to sit here and defend them because you think they’re trying then you do you.
---
“the killer should be a baby too”
---
i am implying that BHVR was lying about the power outage
---
Once the withering blight event get released, I hope to see a Michael in every match because well his movie is literally called Halloween
---
As someone who's been with it since 2016 in an off on hate relationship I semi agree
---
It's like what happened with Bill on consoles. The day before he was set to release they delayed him on PS4 and gave no good reason. It's not the fact he was delayed, it's that I got so excited and then had to be disappointed for three days.
---
Dude got so many moris they had to give him another slot
---
I just tell them it’s from a vid game. I don’t have a lot of likes on instagram because most of my followers don’t know about dead by daylight. My mom asked me who all those characters were but she recognized Michael Myers so she thought it was awesome too. 😅
---
what if all profits whent to the children he abused would that be acceptable?
---
Zimbabwe bubba
---
Yeah, Susie is pretty sexy. As well as julie. But Julie and Frank get into a lot of fights with each other I believe. So that's why I prefer Susie better.
---
Ty 🙂
---
made me wonder if the entity would allow the killers to fight each other, do they even get to meet?
---
Might've just been very similar then idk. Didn't mean to be rude or anything btw!
---
I see Huntress in 3/4 of my games anyway
---
If you blind then too early they wont drop the survivor. A point that works well to time it properly is right as the survivor is kinda in mid air, during the transition from under the killers arm to up on their shoulder
---
Imagine they make a skin where he carries a church beel with him
---
That makes sense. Thank you.
---
Let me see if I got this right
---
BHVR fucked up again and people are surprised?
---
I let this game a few months ago (when Ghostaface was released) for the sames reasons everyone already said in the comments. Personally, I do reccomend people quiting the game. The bugs, the lack of communication, the half baked content, the stress... It just isn't worth it. Talk about what you will about F13 but at least it was fun and could have putted a good competion against DBD if it wasn't for the lawsuit.
---
For everyone who still play this game: you're either one of the most mercyfull souls in the world, one of the dumbest or a masoquist for allowing the devs to always get away with this kinda of bullshit. And prepare yourself: you're about to see this 24/7 because that battlepass will sure as hell heal their pockets and destroy their ears.
---
That's why I said convicted.
---
he was DEFINITELY fucked up before he died, yeah his childhood is sad, but the second he excapes it's all murder and revenge, wraith killed the people that tricked him into killing other people, he was hurt that he had killed so many without knowing, you could have the whole boondock saint's argument with wraith, billy is your standard villain backstory.
---
Edit: just gunna remind you to the fact that he disembowled and tortured live animals before killing them in his backstory. Billy was not just a victim, he was also a fucked up maniac before going the the entity.  Wraith didn't go about killing anything more than just the leader of the criminal organization that tricked him into murder.  Sure, not your upstanding citizen, but i wouldn't put him with billy.
---
Oh so I can blind them but not stun them because my timing is a little early? Gotcha, is the timing for the save when they get them on their shoulder?
---
Did you try purchasing auric cells?
---
He also hacked in a few hundred purple flashlights, among other things, to make videos easier
---
He basically hacked the game to get his legacy back after getting banned for being toxic ( I think don’t quote me on that). He’s honestly grown after that tho and is fun to watch on twitch.
---
It’s probably still going to bug filled
---
Kinda hard here.
---
Legend says every mori you spam a toxic survivor is born
---
I've reached rank 3 as killer and rank 4 as survivor (although not at the same time). Maybe it's different for me because I have a limited amount of free time to play the game, but when I play as or against a killer, I typically see them win if they take their best possible loadout and play like an asshole. I understand that killer is frustrating, especially when you *don't* play like that, but the fact people *can* is why they kept buffing survivors.
---
If the killer brings something like a mori and iridescent head, or gen grab spirit(who's first down is free), four instaheals, a key, or crazy tool boxes are your only chance. 
---
I'd like them to nerf stuff on both sides so that the base kits of killers and the base kits of survivors are more easily able to cope with the crazy shit you can do on either side.
---
Tbh I wouldn't get the game on steam anymore. I've read about plenty of dumb shit these devs did to the game and how they treated playerbase and I honestly have no interest in it anymore, unless it's a F2P.
---
Ah this clears up any confusion I had I appreciate the feed back my dude, i will try to get the timing down in my games now
---
Context:
---
I'm an audio engineer and recently installed a new 7.1 system using a Focusrite Scarlett 18i20. I typically play killer using headphones but I recently launched the game and forgot to turn down my monitors. Needless to say every single speaker around me started firing and I was surprised. I haven't played a round yet but I can only imagine being this immersed must provide a massive boon for killers. 
---
I also noticed the music only comes out of the Front Left and Right channels. Every other channel is ambience and SFX.
---
Huge props to the sound designers at BHVR.
---
Made a post about it and got downvoted to hell. The Karens of this sub have spoken.
---
Totally Squall's facehole from,FF8
---
I am in queue for around 5 minutes right now 4 man swf rank 4 4 7 7
---
wait, did you just change this from being about victimhood to wanting to help entity?
---
Nah tbh. it was like a day after last weeks reset so my MM was a little off. I was 13 and the killer was 12
---
The game director said, yes, the killers can talk and meet together-as you can see the wraith and the nurse are canon couple in the game-but I’m not sure the killers can (or allow) kill each other.
---
Happy birthday, friend!
---
If you flip the format around, you have a really chill SWF group prepared for a BM Spirit.
---
I don’t know what you’re talking about
---
No, but you are a bitch
---
Hillbillly's is the same and looks... alright
---
Like I said, its better then it being even more bug filled. Did you read what I typed? I never denied it won't be bug filled.
---
Fucking deliver it on time and without bugs then like an actually competent developer!
---
Siege’s is coming out tomorrow
---
When is the rift/archices/times coming though? I can't find any dates for it
---
I bet you feel so smart huh
---
Blitzchung? What did Blizzard do? I'm playing OW from time to time and didnt notice anything besides the Release of the old Sombra Skin which drives some people mad.
---
The labyrinth map would be fucking nuts

&gt; I am removing this because her name is not censored at the top of the chat! :)

They should have been released today together with the Halloween event, but "unforeseen circumstances" happened

He also filmed it, and it was a child who was working in his movie. I think people forget that part.

As a person who has wrote four hundred lines of code for a simple project, yeah its hella hard, I was lucky to have a debugger to see where I made my mistake, but even then I have to rewrite that line of code and even change others. I can’t even imagine how many thousands upon thousands lines of code BHVR has to go over to see where it went wrong and rewrite it all.
---
I'm excited for the next dbd animation from samination
---
All perks should be available to purchase based on whether or not you have unlocked them and then what tier. The blood web at that point should only be for new perks and add on shopping. That way you don't wait 400 blood webs just for 1 perk you cant get because you have unlocked all the damn perks for survivor but you cant get  balanced landing on GD Jane because it never shows up in the GD bloodweb. sorry that got very specific.
---
Until that new Julie Day of the Dead cosmetic comes out..
---
 Adrenaline is a crutch perk for low skill players 
---
I don't think I've heard such bullshit in my life.

Yeah, but have you heard the fan made killer music yet?

Honestly? I think it might happen. Not if, but when!
---
What, have you not been on reddit for the last week or so?
---
Same with brawl stars :(
---
 **thanatophobia**  and dying lite work 4 me instead of ruin
---
They are stupid for sure, but they arent cocky, at least from what i have seen in this video.
---
The only toxic and cocky person i see in this video is the killer.
---
Take my downvote and gtfo.
---
Thanks, I would also love him. I tried my best to emulate his abilities about his growing bloodlust and general insanity.
---
I did not my friend. Someone had posted the blank one on r/MemeEconomy earlier.
---
What is the song you used I recognize it but I can't place it
---
I kind of forgot about that event given that the only event that changes is their origins one. 
---
But yea, they out too
---
If you blind the killer while he’s animation locked and can’t move you’ll get the blind but he won’t drop the survivor. You want the blind to kick in right as the killer regains control of their character.
---
mgmt - kids (instrumental)
---
How wholesome!
---
I'm kinda with you. I'm all for memes (only if they're good, most aren't tbh) but going too far and insulting them isn't fair.
---
Would love Pinhead in the game to be honest 
---
And that's totally not because alongside an obviously dope killer I want BDSM Doc and Huntress
---
What did he do? lol
---
Oh really? Damn that sucks it's even more pointless to run.
---
Living this right now. I used to LOVE it
---
Agreed. I feel like most memes in this sub are used as a vehicle for complaining without trying to come off as complaining ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Lmao, they were already trying to bully me before, I can post the full match if you want. When I grabbed the first survivor they all pointed flashlights and tried to bodyblock me, as well as tbagging behind a pallet. I was already salty by that so that's why I did that little nod to the 2nd hooked survivor
---
it would be nice tho, when getting a new survivor to use the perks youve already grinded for in the past instead of having to play a guessing game to get them unlocked everytime a new survivor comes out.  . .
---
Hag respect.
---
More time for toxic insta heals dood
---
Wiggle!!

Yep. No word yet on when it will actually happen.
---
I got a baby legion killer last night. It was adorable, he tried so hard.
---
I think that’s what legion should of been
---
I'm actually sad that there isnt more of it :/ this stuff is amazing!!!! I absolutely love it ♡
---
⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
---
Strange Fetish but I'll take it
---
Just imagine if all the killers had a big brain to go over the pallet.
---
thx
---
One of those things you know when you see it, like a camping, NOED Billy
---
That's sure what the trailer suggested 🙄
---
Thank you! Even I can’t wait the chapter 02 😄😄
---
This pleases me for some odd reason.
---
Nah I would not feel bad for any instant down killer using NOED lol
---
Not saying it isn't, I love the game.
---
I'm just saying that it's pretty reasonable that it doesn't get updates anymore.
---
This is some great work. Do you have plans on showcasing other killers as survivors or will those killers get their own comics?
---
I agree. Bubba with PWTF is fun. 
---
Speedy Bubba!!
---
Just go and read all of the major cheating forum sites. Plenty of cheaters in DBD, tons of which have their own personal EAC bypass, gloat about it and have unlisted videos on youtube they link to the forum site.
---
what exactly was homophobic about my messages? as i said, i didnt even know it was a guy lmfao. these people are just projecting their insecurities at this point
---
Because his personality is overwhelmingly positive in a game that profusely lacks that from a lot of its community.  He makes great plays and narrates every decision he makes step by step the whole game so he's one of the most informative killer players to watch.  He also plays pretty fair typically and has fun wholesome exchanges in post game chats.  He's basically a role model of how this game can and should be played if we want this community to improve.  There is so much trash out there on both sides of the aisle so it's just refreshing to see someone like him do his thing in promoting the game.
---
There is hesitation in that comment opinion dismissed
---
In dbd culture this is considered a dick move
---
RE2 and Blair witch, but yeah
---
I stopped playing when The Doctor was released, and just recently came back. I'm not burned out yet and I don't want to be, but grinding blood points to get all these teachables is getting obnoxious.
---
I was thinking that is what Pennywise could do as an ability
---
Its subjective
---
I find MYC amazing 
---
Also for most people Ruin and bbq are shite because they already have it
---
Yes, after this comic I wanna draw about the Huntress. She’s my favorite female killer and love her so much.
---
I already expect 2 perks from free characters and 2 crappy perks like wake up and poised. I hope not though
---
I KNOW like with his mask off and everything
---
It's a horror game when you first start playing it but it quickly becomes just a normal one once you get used to playing. My first 20 games or so were terrifying whenever I was getting chased.
---
But that's just like, your opinion, man.
---
The shrine is random according to them, but if BBQ popped up again I wouldn't be shocked
---
Scared the fuck out of me...
---
I predict brutel strength killer and claudette perk for survivor
---
Come back in an hour when im right :P
---
Is it bad I kinda wanna shove Poised in a stealth build?
---
I look forward to seeing more. Dead by daylight is one of my favorite games. I will be definitely looking out for my main man/girl legion
---
Do what must be done.
---
I require more.
---
I hated that because I dropped a pallet on a killer and nothing.
---
Really cool. You are going about it differently than me, but I love it.
---
We getting territorial imperative, surge, vigil, and tenacity as an extra fuck you
---
Pumps shotgun*
---
Y-yea... &gt;w&lt;
---
That's why they don't wanna make a killer like that the closest thing to that would be pig because she kinda looks like a meg
---
Freddy is a goddamn manlet he’s not a jock smh
---
Oh yes the Legion, I should draw their story too! Also DBD is my fav game too 😄
---
heck uwu
---
1. Does I'm All Ears work on dropping from heights?
---
2. Sometimes when I'm in the end chat window, I hit enter, but instead of posting my comment, that minimizes the screen. And I can't figure out how to unstick it and am unable to post my comment in the chat. What's up with that?
---
Nah its just one of the downsides to the games design. They need to update objectives or add a new one entirely. Games aren't fun for survivor or killer when all the gens are done in five minutes and you don't get chased or get to chase. Just becomes a skill check simulator.
---
The best killer to play is Spirit. Bubba for perks
---
I’ll never understand those people. All you’re doing is wasting time.
---
I think it has both a toxic and fair use for both the killer and the survivors. It all depends on how it's being done

I got more DC's with OG Freddy than any other killer since people expected EZ clap and then Freddy fucking ninjas over with 0 TR and a 3 second dream transition with STBFL, PWYF, M&amp;A, and Rancor machine gunning everyone down, then instagibbing the obsession.

Yes I tend to clip ragequits via shadowplay because it amuses me. I know I have a collection somewhere of cross-map Billy snipes at roundstart leading to a DC.
---
How would the hat stay on the top of his head when he opens his mouth?
---
But at least it lasts nearly a whole month instead of the measly week we get with this game.
---
I respect body blocking as a killer main.  It’s a fair strat to exchange hits around for the survivors. A really coordinated group tends to outplay me, but it’s not so bad. It helps that I like to use thanatophobia too lol.
---
Irritating. But, whatever.
---
It’s definitely intended as you can phase through killers after being hit so you can’t be trapped and get downed immediately. There’s also ways around body-blocking by quite literally going around to other windows or running to another pallet.
---
Rank reset killed the fun tbh.
---
I used to be able to just switch to survivor after raging as killer but that's gone now that my teammates seem to be people that discovered what video games are that morning.
---
But for this game, shit happens every single time.
---
Yes, but it'll be OUR buggy mess.
---
Kinda why I like this game so much.  I just want Clown's gut to glitch out physics wise at least ONE patch.
---
No but you see it was OUR fault for assuming based on their month of promotion that the patch would come out today
---
 since they dropped all the Halloween skins early before the event I have not seen one person yet using it, now I’m on PS4 but I haven’t seen anyone with them.
---
Hex Ruin or Hex Devour Hope plz
---
Ye ye, only two addons blah blah
---
This is like asking if its okay to DC if the survivors bring 4x Tool boxes.
---
Their stories don't really intertwine most don't really relate to one another, the only common occurrence is their disappearance.
---
Why you would pair David and Dwight for example? That's something that is seen in the fandom, but they're kinda opposites if you look at it.
---
It's a legit strat imo but it's annoying but can be countered easily most of the time
---
It’s an intended feature, it even gives Survivors WGLF stacks, Emblem scoring and bloodpoints.
---
They don't test anything. We're the testers.
---
Got you.  Just like why is it so bad for killers to disconnect from the games they don't want to play when they see keys, and survivor map offerings like Haddonfield right?
---
You don't dodge games like a little bitch just because you don't like their loadout.  I am very outspoken about my lack of respect for moris but I still play against their lobbies because I'm not an entitled baby.  Besides there is little more satisfying in this game than trashing a killer that brought a mori and them not even being able to use the thing.
---
Rise to the challenge.  Most killers that run them outside of dailies suck anyways so they're easy to loop.  Man up dude.  DC's are a massive problem on both sides and you're just feeding that issue.
---
[If everyone else has something to make them stand out, not having anything to make you stand out IS what make you stand out.](https://static.hitek.fr/img/42/2017/02/fb_roll-safe.png)
---
Most of the time it doesn’t work and a good killer can usually prevent it I think it’s fair game if the survivors can pull it off
---
Many killers do dc on the lobby screen if they see that, but I don’t blame them though.
---
Every game i get against her every survivor but me cleanses and I die bc of it.
---
Ofc u main spirit trash, press m2 to win

Well I press alt+f4 to escape toxic frustrating experience where you can't do shit fuck u and fuck your spirit and fuck devs who do not nerf her for so long and fuck those who think she is balanced. 
---
P. S. Also fuck anyone who dislikes this post
---
Everyone always assumes that the Doctor is a completely violent sadistic psychopath, but I seriously question how true that actually is.  The Doctor seems to have gotten the Old Man Yamaoka treatment by the Entity, so it's hard for me to consider The Doctor to have been in his right mind when he was writing the flavor for his Notes add-ons.  Even after being driven mad, he still resisted enough that the Entity wired him up with electrodes and a Clockwork Orange accessory.
---
Just bring Black Incense and Tanatophobia and BAM! Instant counter!
---
Not as ridiculous as you.
---
I was hooked (_get it?_) immediately, and am only disappointed that there isn’t more to read. Great job and I can’t wait for your next issue!

Dont forget they also banned the announcers that were there
---
steam updates every tuesday at 4pm pst
---
All the time I’m on Xbox btw
---
I work in a warehouse and there's a huge pile of pallets outside it, and I'm scared of them
---
We also have the Demogorgon, and I'm not sure Stranger Things classify as a Slasher.
---
I wouldn't mind a Turkey skin for a survivor/killer, like no seriously.
---
Can someone tell me what the hell happened to the silver trapper mask?
---
Free hits
---
Thank you! Even I can’t wait for the next chapter!
---
Kk
---
RE 2 has a multiplayer mode?
---
Solid, solid! Lithe would save me alot of time as a Kate main. :)
---
Aye now to be fair thoe blizz has reduced the sentence and hired the announcers beck since all this backlash but they haven’t acknowledged it
---
But it also continues for an entire month
---
I pretend to be a baby Dwight in the hopes of mercy
---
You know I had a love hate relationship with that game for a while. Now I just straight up hate it. I haven’t played in over year. Don’t really see myself playing it again.
---
Yes but demo isn't exactly a psychological killer
---
Even as a Survivor player, I want BBQ on shrine, poor Switch killers are missing out 😂😂
---
I don't usually find memes on this sub to be funny, but this is hilarious lmao.
---
Reach red ranks play 70% vs spirit you will get the same feeling
---
Wait do people like that skin?
---
I know that I'm an outlier but I'm actually really happy it got delayed. 
---
I'm doing a book review for my uni assignment and I'd have completely missed the event if it was to happen during the week, haha.
---
I'm leveling Meg now and would really like to just go back to Kate or Tapp instead of leveling Feng.
---
Decisive strike
---
It allows a survivor once per game to get out of a grab
---
The unforeseen circumstances are that BHVR needs to hire COMPETENT people for fucking once
---
You wanna die kid
---
I’m hoping pop goes the weasel is one of them
---
I just saved up 1mil bloodpoints again and really don’t want to use it for clown when I can put it towards my other stuff I like playing lol
---
Reposted bc the last vid was glitched uwu
---
Edit: also forgot to add the earphone warning to the title when I reposted im sorry :’|
---
Well, he does it faster after he murders the guy at the end of the video, and it looks perfectly fine to me.
---
There's also already Trapper, Michael, Clown, Freddy, Plague and I think Doctor in treatment stance who just power walk faster than Survivors.
---
Depends what ranks your playing In
---
What kind of body blocking?
---
IMHO every kind of bodyblock is ok (Wraith bodyblocking someone in a corner to hit them or a Bubba doing it to an immersed claudette to chainsaw them. Survivors bodyblocking hook and to take hits.) besides survivors bodyblocking eachother to sandbag/grief or a killer bodyblocking to take the game hostage.
---
Entity displeased
---
Well if I knew your perks I would have disconnected as well. Maybe he just saw you self caring yourself and thought what an idiot, he could have done general already.
---
There's a reason they call it power walk because there's *power*
---
One of Freddy’s sounds like, “Ooooo” it just sounds funny to me idk why
---
More work for them probably
---
The leaked dates were wrong last time too so let’s not do this again
---
Goes to the back of his head I guess
---
Sorry it just feels like a get out of jail free card to me. I don't think it being popular validates it. People take it because yeah, it's incredibly safe and makes end game much easier. Also saying you're essentially without a perk the whole game is kinda a bs point because look at NOED, also an incredibly lame perk but would you say you have to be good to use it since you're "giving up a perk slot all game"? They both just lower the challenge of end game. I mean just think about how lame it is to be facing four survivors with adrenaline and them all getting healed at the end? What's the counter play to that? NOED is but I'm not taking that because it's not fun for anyone. Also as survivor you definitely don't need it to get to rank 1. The game is much more satisfying when you're able to climb without the cheese perks.
---
Not a bad idea but no lmao
---
Full video?
---
The last one is actually me when I see Legion
---
Then show me
---
Well now I’m sad
---
There's a mathematical formula to it.  You have to solo one additional gen yourself for every Self Care that's in the lobby.  This number increases by one for each additional Urban Evasion that's in your lobby.
---
I’ve watched him since ds2
---
I thought you meant you were still waiting for it.
---
Hillbilly imo is one of the worst killers because if your not skilled with it or a survivor dodges you with the chain saw your screwed
---
*sole survivor and urban evasion
---
Bill Cosby new killer

At least you guys get a halloween event. Dota doesn't even get one :(
---
I think he’s being sarcastic..
---
This is some top tier content right here
---
Identity V is horrible, lmao.
---
Just because you’re upset with Dead By Daylight right now, doesn’t mean that $100-budget joke of a game is “better”.
---
What a cutie.
---
Tuesday strikes again!
---
literally everything ive seen is horrible, and YOU?! You HAVE to be THE CUTEST THING i have seen!
---
Franklins, Huntress Lullaby, Self-care, and balanced landing.
---
Your patient comes in and sees you casually cutting someone in half with a chainsaw.
---
Bro I had my phone sound at 100% why you gotta do this to me
---
Nope :) bbq is actually famous for not being on the shrine too often, at least on PC.
---
People actually play that game still?
---
I just like to growl at them and spin in a circle.
---
Respect on running the best perk in game, boil over. I keep trying to make it work but it's just so..... Doodoo. #BuffBoilOver
---
Pinhead and The Thing are the ones I want most. A frozen arctic research station would be an amazing location.
---
I tell him this a lot.
---
Poor doctor. Yes he’s my fav but I don’t think he can fight with the trapper. Evan Macmillan is the real crazy one(and he’s really strong and brutal) and  the doctor is...just “a doctor” from a hospital. Well let's see what happens in the next chapter.
---
LAUGHS IN FLIP FLOP
---
Hands too pretty, 5/7
---
It's called Resident Evil: Project Resistance. The beta just ended if ya'll interested, but it is a completely new game. Not an extra mode for RE2 Remake
---
&gt;  the prequel movie.
---
What prequel movie? There was no prequel movie. Never happened.
---
I think the team is okay, just you know wish they would have made a response about it being delayed earlier instead of saying it on the release date.
---
Exactly! Also why I want Detective's Hunch before it gets dummy buffed
---
Spend the BP for self care, save your shards for DLC or cosmetics.
---
The tweet said the withering blight event was postponed until update 3.3. was that update also postponed or something? Because update 3.3 was supposed to come out today
---
I think its adorable as a pig main
---
Shrine by Akuma Sanctum uses the Huntress's lullaby and it's actually really good imo
---
He too tired
---
When is it supposed to release now?
---
and this comment is literally the definition of irony.
---
Have you heard clown? He laughs it off, so he's with doc on that one
---
I've had that happen multiple times, it's great. Does what actually work?
---
-and the Hag Skin. Still.
---
For whatever reason, your framerate will drop to 0 and climb back up after you place down a Trap. It’s not horribly game breaking, but it makes putting Traps down mid-chase annoying, as sometimes it will look like a Survivor skipped past you.
---
&gt;  Multiple floors of apartments with holes in the walls and ceilings.
---
It would end up being The Game 2.0 because of the vertical nature of the map. Which means it would probably suck to play on as a survivor, but impossible skillchecks doctors would LOVE it.
---
Billy’s anger was far more warranted because he spent, say, 20-30 years bricked up behind a wall. The man didn’t even understand how to speak, let alone have morals or ways of venting anger. And guess what? That’s why he became what you call a “maniac”. This is also why he would torture animals, because he, again, was never taught any morals. Wraith, on the other hand, was more fortunate than Billy and learned to be a decent citizen. If Wraith is a victim, then Billy is tenfold.
---
Also, who ever said that Billy died?
---
Yeah I do miss his videos on YouTube they honestly were some quality content.
---
Laughs in Spanish.
---
Why would you want pwyf on doctor anyway?
---
&gt; I want BDSM Doc and Huntress
---
Wait, Doc I get because straight jackets, restraints, etc. Where does Huntress come in?
---
Howdy birthday neighbour! Mine's tomorrow.
---
Personally not a fan. I watched him a little. Don't dislike him but personally don't care for him.  But that's just me, I can see why others enjoy him
---
Literally you can buy Teachable Perks on the Shrine. I get that we’re all mad at DbD, but don’t just start nitpicking random things you can try and think of off the top of your head.
---
Yeah, that's what I was thinking would happen and that is how the wording reads, but in these sorts of games the coding sometimes doesn't line up exactly.
---
thanks!
---
Its "rushed" actions, dropping a pallet isnt considered a rush action since theres no difference in speed when you drop it while running vs walking/crouching, so it wont activate it
---
Swf meming
---
Also referred to as: Ghost Face
---
I am going to see Shining in a movie theatre tomorrow and it had me thinking all day of what a chapter would look like. Although I do not love the indoor maps all that much with the maze outdoors it could be a good mix or hybrid and we could have 2 maps, one for inside and one for in the maze. I would love jack as a killer too.
---
They should plan to release seasonal events 1 month earlier, so when the "unforeseen circumstances" hit, they can already release it in time
---
To be fair, Bill was an issue of copyright/Microsoft/Sony issues, since Bill is technically a Steam/Valve character from Left 4 Dead. They didn’t have much say over that delay.
---
You’re right that’s true some of them don’t really intertwine but again It’s just something “fun and silly” i was just defining what i meant by chemistry is all and some of the other characters i put them with it’s just because i think they would like nice with each other like Ace/Jane, Claudette/Jake or Jeff/Adam. The David/Dwight thing i just like it just to like it, it was the first few things i saw in the dbd fandom and it had me thinking like “oh that’s kinda cute” so i guess it just stuck. And i think why others may like it might he because of the whole “Jock and nerd” or “Big guy protecting small nerdy guy” trope.
---
I have never considered how good that perk can be against spirit
---
As I stated, I also play Clown and am playing Plague at the current moment. You need to chill out with your hate boner out of nowhere like the rest of the community did. She was fine for months and no one said a thing. Now Nurse is getting a rework and people jump to get her changed. She is completely balanced. The issue is she is too easy for anyone to pick up and play to almost full ability. You know nothing of how I play or who I am, so don't judge every Spirit player because of who they play. You know damn well survivors are tired of being generalized as toxic for playing SWF and using DS, so why do the same? Calm yourself.
---
Can't wait to see a survivor version on the other hand. Well done for the killers, but they'll feel borred if they don't have any surv to hook
---
Yep, I'm always the only one doing GENS.  Then once the gates are opened I'm left to die.
---
I wanted to see how it plays with Ghostface. 
---
The only other one I ever played, someone played a McMillan offering and we went to the Shelter Woods.
---
it definitely isn't a bad perk. it just lasts wayyy too long
---
Project Resistance is the game. It's less of a specific game spin-off and more of a general series stand-alone spin-off to dip into the asymmetrical multiplayer market. There wasn't an asymmetrical MP mode in either the original RE2 or it's recent remake.
---
https://comicbook.com/gaming/2019/10/19/resident-evil-project-resistance-impressions/
---
Don't give them ideas
---
I replied to the person below you also asking but just sending it again so you get the notif:
---
Found him recently too... Handsome, good energy, extremely skilled, he's great.
---
Part of me thought this was a salt post from the title but instead was glorious to watch, thank you good person. thank you
---
Plz no I.have those survivor perks QnQ
---
Also Landing was in Shrine this week, I don't think it'll be there again
---
Well, then that's okay. I have no sympathy for toxic survivors. I'm glad you did that. Its just from only the video, you seemed to be the toxic one.
---
Just change collision in phase and put beads at ultra rare
---
Mad Grit and Iron Grasp. If they still break free you just got the whole team wounded. Fair trade IMO.
---
That doesn’t mean he has power. It means he doesn’t give a shit about what the Entity wants him to do.
---
Like a 3D auric cell would look cool , or any of the items like a medkit would be sick , imagine a little medkit for your desk and you could put a little LED switch light in it
---
You generally don’t but the trade off is you have four injured survivors and all in general close proximity.  Thats a huge win for a killer if they play it right and can lead the game to snowball. 
---
Nine times out of ten survivors bodyblocking just generally lead to one member of the team switching places with the original person who was on killers shoulders.
---
Best cosplay of my favorite killer in the game, well done!!
---
I wouldn't touch it, but if I had to nerf it, I would make it so it randomly chooses a totem at the beginning of the game (that isnt already taken) and will only light that one once the exits are powered if it is still up. That way, it stays hidden, but if you get most of the totems, you will likely not get NOED.
---
Perk: Here's Johnny! - pallet breakspeed is 100% faster
---
Ubi$oft
---
i hear this suggestion all the time. that will fix almost nothing.
---
I am interested in the game, any news of how the beta was?
---
Just wait until you lose 3 gens within a minute with ruin up and playing properly.
---
NOED is a safety net, Adrenaline is a reward. You did the objective optimally (or allowed other players to do the objective by looping) and you get a heal and a boost for it. I suppose you do fall back on it for the heal, but thats just because nobody heals you since youre expected to have adrenaline, if it didnt exist, youd just get healed by them
---
Also,if adrenaline didnt exist, thered just be way more self care (which is already the most used perk in the game), which is worse for both killers and survivors imo
---
The only nerf I could possibly imagine to it is not applying to people who are hooked when it activates, but it certainly isnt a weird baby perk
---
It’s almost as if someone like, say, Vigo did it. Seriously, though, look up the Hollowed Blight animation from BHVR. You’ll understand.
---
Thank you. If I have to be frank, the Dwight with the flashlight was a pain in my ass. I was Rank 8-9 before my two week hiatus and rank reset. Also, with new Decisive, I refrain from tunneling.
---
I spent cash on Hag but on PS4, her torso freezes the game for us everytime she lays a trap.
---
Swf, was trying to hook somebody and other three teammates blocked the hook. So is that an intended feature? I'm not sure how I'm supposed to get off six hits before the guy I'm carrying Wiggles free.
---
Prepare for the people that are like “jUsT dO bOnEs”
---
i really like the swamp map with the big boat what is that one called
---
How does a good killer get off six hits before somebody can wiggle free? Swf with three teammates blocking hook while I was carrying somebody. They didn't care about taking one hit.
---
Lmao. It literally keeps telling me I don’t have an internet connection while PS4 is doing perfectly fine on everything else and modem is stable.
---
Still waiting for the stackable add-on that makes your bell 300% and 200% louder.
---
What's the counter when three people are blocking a hook and I'm carrying someone?
---
Then drop the guy and people will most likely run and you can hook the guy
---
If you don't 3 gen that map as a killer you are fucked
---
its basicly a mix of violent coughing and laughing, kinda like he just got told a joke whilst sipping cheap scotch
---
Spirit is fine 
---
She is strong and should stay strong, just as every killer should aim to be...  she’s not op but a strong killer
---
Prayer beads I could understand a tweak. But leave her base alone...
---
ESO is patiently waiting right beside y'all
---
Can’t tell if you are memeing or not
---
Fine then, not balanced landing, urban evasion instead.
---
I believe they said the length of the event won't be altered it's just pushed back (thankfully).
---
I'm talking about three survivors blocking a hook when I'm the killer carrying someone.
---
Not at all?
---
Three survivors blocking the hook as I'm carrying someone who don't care about taking one hit each. Not sure how I'm supposed to get off six hits before the person Wiggles free.
---
I disagree with Myers.  I don’t think he would care at all and just continue to stalk you as he would
---
I just love how Ghostface sounds like "This fucking shit again."
---
I feel like its just his personality. Literally everyone is toxic. Otz can joke around sometimes but he often admits it when his opponents make a good play and generally accepts it when he gets outplayed instead of instantly getting salty which is quite appealing surprisingly.
---
hit your console a couple times and say ‘bad’ over and over again. Worked when my headset was being ass, then I just pulled a Chris Brown and slammed it against the stand my tv sits on. Works perfectly now
---
Actually tried that but didn't work for some reason. Not sure if everybody being so close didn't leave them place to drop so wouldn't let me or something.
---
What counter?
---
Edit: oh you meant like how to deal with it, not a ticking down counter. Just stab them like the person who replied to me said
---
I mean....   you probably should lol
---
Fuck man it's such a shame that you can't get these every game :(
---
Fuck I forgot about him
---
Honestly this is just disappointing. Why did they wait until the last minute to let everyone know about the delay?
---
the ones where chases arent reduced to 50/50 coinflip mindgames when they use their ability
---
