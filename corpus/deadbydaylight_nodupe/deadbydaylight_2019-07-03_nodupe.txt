You need to shift your killer mentality in order to be maximally effective. The shift is from specifically trying to hook and kill survivors to focusing on pressuring survivors and keeping them off the generators. You feel like you're losing if you arent progressing your OWN win condition, but you need to think of it in terms of you are NOT losing if the survivors are not progressing THEIR win condition. The longer the game goes the better your chances are. 
---

---
A simple example of this would be a situation where a killer comes across two survivors at the start of the game who are both repairing the same generator. The newer killer will chase the survivors off the gen and then focus on one, downing and hooking them after a chase. During this time the other survivor has gone back to that gen and likely is finished with it, and the other two survivors are god-knows-where probably plying away at other gens. As a consequence of this the killer has now almost traded two generators for hooking a single survivor. 
---
The correct approach to this situation is simply to chase the survivors off the gen, ideally injuring one or both, then let them run away and bash the generator. Now they are losing progress on that gen and you have pressured those two players into relocating, wasting time healing, etc. After the generator is bashed you can immediately patrol to other generators and do the same. Other survivors may think you are still chasing the injured survivor and let their guard down. 
---
A big part of this is that new killers are afraid that if they let someone go they will not be able to find them again. In order to succeed you need to move past that fear and grow more confident in your hunt. Areas of the map that dont have generators are not actually relevant to you.

Is truth

Next time try  Jane cosplay and show me how you cleanse a totem.
---
People seem to forget, old Exhaustion recovered while running. 
---
Vigil HASN'T changed since then. Tier 3 Exhaustion perks have a 40 second cooldown. Meaning a tier 3 Vigil allows for a 32 second Exhaustion cooldown. 
---
This is still the case. The only difference is that the old Exhaustion recovered while running. 
---
If Vigil were changed to OP's idea, we'd have an 80 second Exhaustion cooldown while running. While this still isn't balanced, don't *EVER* compare that to original Exhaustion. It wouldn't even be close.
---
A 32 second chase for Sprint Burst to come back up. That's the tier 3 Sprint Burst/Vigil combo from back in the day.
---
OP's idea would be an 80 second chase for Sprint Burst to come back up. Same tier 3 Sprint Burst/Vigil. But a 48 second difference from the original.
---
Every time I talk about this you end up providing more information lmao
---
E=mc2
---
freddy in the back tho
---
Go gens like the rest of your team is or you're just as useless as the dude chilling on the hook
---
Change hag for 'When already too late'.
---
A little bit THICC'er then Kate but still class A cosplay.
---
An beautiful camera work, are you a photographer/editer or do you know one?
---
Some dude posted a thing where people shouldn’t discourage and stomp on noobs for using NOED because it might be all they have and that toxicity is unnecessary. People have made it a meme format now.
---
The 6 perks, plus Myers unlocked, is worth it. 
---
After that, you have a 0% chance to get his splinter in your bloodwebs (very good, because it counts as an ultra rare spawn, which blocks real add ons), and Laurie.
---
Amazing cosplay, I love it!
---
every game like that the killer always brings a mori:( for me anyway
---
It looks like that Nikon has had enough of your shit.
---
Wow so you really aren’t reading my posts at all and being an oblivious Survivor whining, and I’m a survivor main myself. 🙄
---
How did he do that?
---
I was waiting for big brain plays... I got what I wanted
---
Anyone that would like to play, feel free to add me. I got the game yesterday though so I'm still learning.
---
PSN - KenshinSaitou
---
My mom just gave it to me, its actually a pen. Idk where she got though :/
---
Jake's Iron Will and Calm Spirit help him stay hidden and stealthy, so he's a good survivor to play.
---
If you spawn with others, co-op working on a gen will help speed up repairs a lot.  However if you or one of your mates flubs a skillcheck, you should get away and find a hiding spot.  Splitting up can be good because the killer has a less of a chance of finding and hitting someone, but your generator progress will be slower.
---
There's a killer perk that highlights generators being worked on by two or more survivors but if you are new, killers probably won't be using it.
---
As long as its pretty nerf lmao
---
Or right in front of a hook.
---
Why waste money and time, wanna crush some noobies? You can buy it for 10 euros on sale now.
---
The killer could have just hooked through you after the first hit though so oops
---
Myers is a lot of fun, and his map is also my favourite. Definitely recommend it, OP
---
Oh I didn’t know I’m an ash main but  I don’t use his perks
---
i suck too xd
---
Thank you so much!!
---
This one was taken and edited by a friend of mine who is a fellow cosplayer! I’ll pass on the compliment :D

She really got the mood down perfectly, especially because this was shot in daylight in the middle of a park in my city!

Thank you so much! :D

The emblem system is beyond stupid at this point.
---
Ever notice that you get garbage chaser points if you play as a killer with a power that's meant to circumvent chasing? IE Trapper, Ghostface, etc. 
---
Just got out of a game on the I shaped Autohaven map (forget the name, it's really strong killer map though) and decided I'd split the map on the side with Ruin and the basement as Ghost Face.
---
Game went fine, first 3 gens went relatively quick but they knew I was 3 genning them so they stopped at 2 gens. I was stalking, getting regular hits occasionally and only really committing on someone exposed, downing them and quickly hooking them. One guy got "pseudo" camped because the survivors kept trying to run to him and I knew which side of the map all of them were on but I didn't lose any points because of "proximity to a hook". Still only got silver chaser, silver devout (with 3 kills?) , gold malicious and silver gatekeeper.
---
  
---
I only BARELY black pipped. Rank means nothing, sure. But it's still super frustrating to be told "you lose" when you clearly didn't lose...I've black pipped even after getting 11 hooks (for those keeping track, every survivor got hooked 3 times except the one who escaped who was on death hook). It's asinine. Killer emblems are in a terrible spot.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Can't believe I'm saying this but I miss the Victory Cube at this point. The fact that people have to GUESS what they got before the game tells them should tell the devs their system is awful. It should be obvious if you are winning or losing. Right now, it's not even consistent.
---
Every killer is noob friendly because you can walk around and just m1 and still do well in rank 20-18, therefore all killers are very accessible.
---
Every trapper I go against lately never use traps.
---
I don’t get the quotations on the video tittle. MOM is trash.
---
I certainly feel that way as well, it’s not just you. 
---
There’s a lot of pressure on a killer working alone to do well and of course if you don’t, some survivors are quick to rub it in. I turned off chat to try to avoid that and try to just pretend I’m playing AI and it does help a little bit. Usually after a game or two, I feel a little more relaxed but I certainly still feel that anxiety and pressure on some level. That being said, I still play survivor much more because of it.
---
Unless spooky face grabs you right off the gen instead
---
Ok Hitler
---
Someone can put the link of the original post?
---
Billy if he wears untied shoes cause of his limp
---
There have been times where I only heard the whooshing sound unless addons reduced the bell sound radius.
---
Buddy, this whole conversation wasn't about you personally. What you initially said was indicative of larger problem within the game. Your reading comprehension sucks.
---
You just missed the animation. Unreal. That Billy must've lost his shit lmao
---
What rank are you?
---
Oh yeah? Well maybe *YOU'RE* a doctor illusion.
---
Just stop before you butcher it even more.
---
😭 I did the photography/editing on this thank you so much ahhh
---
There's 2 players in my house, any time either of us is invited to a party it's kids that sound 12 or under. I don't usually take the time to check on profiles but I'm guessing you're on pc. I'm on console so I assume the whole age group's lower there too. Major reason not to play Nintendo IMO. I debated about whether to group teenagers in with kids, but I was hoping to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm guessing teens are the largest age group playing, so even if it's like 1/10 toxic it's still a lot. That's it.. I want a DBD census now.
---
This. I couldn't care less if everyone escapes (95% of the time i let everyone escape) as long as i get those BBQ stacks.
---
Your best bet is to buy it now while it's on sale, I don't think there is a option to start fresh on your current account without doing something bannable.
---
If you have dlc's on your current account I would advise you to power through whatever mess you made considering how grindy this game is and starting all over would be pretty bad, and if you want dlc perks, killers, survivors you would have to waste quite a bit money.
---
Surely you'd reset all your progress to start again and make it neat and definitely not go back to rank 20 to fight low levels.
---
Just run Object of Obsession and tell by their aura as soon as you spawn. EZ
---
Also you can tell it's Clown if you hear people screaming but not being damaged because it means they are intoxicated.
---
Where’s shirtless Myers moonwalk?
---
He was training for his role in Dancin' 2
---
NO, just no
---
Good rule of thumb for starting out: dont go for an unhook unless you know the killer is chasing someone else and isnt near the hook. Otherwise you should keep your nose in the gen until the killers attention is diverted.
---
2 shrines in a row where I already have all the perks
---
Stream sniping isn’t reportable though

---
Ok this is epic
---
I used to be a killer main for the fast queue times but a couple weeks before ghostface came out it reversed. I dunno what happened. I'm a survivor main now because I like to play the game lol. Long killer queue times on Xbox, I dunno about other platforms.
---
If it works can you call it a bad strategy?
---
You have to be up against an object, like a wall or a tree. You’ll notice a little white lean prompt on the bottom of your screen. All you have to do is stalk, and Ghost Face will automatically lean out and stalk.
---
Sweet, sweet bloodpoints my guy
---
I wish
---
Thanks for the load of info!  I saw a few survivors using that tactic against me and I have done it a couple times just not as effectively at the moment so I will do that more.  The sound in this game is pretty helpful and only once I started trying the killer have I noticed how easy it is to find an injured survivor nearby.
---
DWM is very under-appreciated too. :(
---
I still want to play the survivor a fair amount but I like playing killer a bit more right now
---
Make sure after the match you report said person with video clip in a ticket so he will be banned
---
nah most killers actually just tunnel from what I noticed, they can have 3 people standing in front of them with gens still up and a lot of killers will just continue going for the injured person
---
My goal is to have fun. Its not fun. Its stressful.
---
Congrats on 400+
---
Then don't play killer.
---
Doctor should be with Hillbilly and Nurse. You know it's him as soon as you hear him use his shock ability and/or when you see/hear people screaming from across the map.
---
You still see this with sub 10 cannibals with insidious
---
Sorry to tell ya but I’m pretty sure BBQ has only appeared once and I’ve only seen ruin appear twice.
---
Eh Yamaoka Estate is worse tbh
---
You're doing fine, ignore this dickhead. As to the original question yes spirit + hag are great but take practice.
---
Only one person can be chased/threatened at a time (minus Legion, I guess?) so the other three can still be working on gens while the fourth loops the killer.
---
I don’t know why I think I was the only person who thought that cosmetic looked bad.
---
That rarely lasts long enough for gens to get done with Ruin going, though.
---
nah different mask styles
---
I haven’t even seen the original lol
---
another spirit main i see,you're a man of culture as well.
---
Very true
---
How to dab while running away from predators
---
I'm a little older and I'll bm when someone's doing it first. A lot of people say it doesnt help to do it back I find it satisfying to do it back and win to teach them how it feels. It's just sad that it's this bad tbh.
---
thanks bro english is my second language and thanks for the recommendation
---
😮😮😮
---
Exactly
---
Ghost face because you can have a teabag battle with the survivor at the exit gate
---
naw its totally the plag dude
---
It really does. Maybe a new main screen animation?
---
Lol
---
I imagined the “Survivors failings to escape when exiting” was due to a lag switch but maybe it’s a bug. Unfortunately if a laggy killer plays you’re at his/her mercy
---
Not great, not terrible. 3.6/5.
---
Template?
---
Lul, part of the reason I love huntress is axing an already hit, teabagging survivor and getting the hook
---
My first encounter with ghostface had him doing that and it legit spooked me a bit.
---
So many downvotes
---
Survivors don't care what perks you run what makes a game unfun for them is if you literally go for every unhook streight away or camp.
---
We can't see you.. But you can sorta see us.
---
I feel you.. after I hit rank 5 I usually play survivor and wait until the reset before playing killer again. Games just feel stressful than being fun tbh.
---
Why do you think that?
---
Idc about going against any perk other than noed or ruin
---
Awesome Cosplay! You are worthy to be my Object of Obsession
---
e.
---
&gt;killer has high skill cap
---
&gt;therefore is toxic
---
Yea okay
---
Its a really good drawing tho

honestly wouldnt mind if they made that the actual screen

Is anyone elses BBQ been playing up? I'm sure I've had a few 4Ks recently but only three stacks :(
---
piggy because 1, more of a stealth playstyle. not as much as ghostface, but its still there. 2, queen amanda
---
Stop
---
You have to have madness initiated for that to happen (he has to use his power), so by the time that happens you already know it's the doc.
---
I regret watching this
---
There was a Michael one shoting everyone without hooking. Luckily I had a key and was a stealth build. Made it to the hatch with a few minutes left on the clock. We only had 1 gen done and I realized he was straight up killing everyone.
---
Looping took me forever to figure out, but it really elevated my play. Definitely watch out for perks that reduce or cancel out sound cues! They aren’t common, but they do exist!
---
the reverse bear traps seem incredibly fun, and i'm a fan of saw. however i've heard she's not very good.
---
I knew Meg mains had big brains
---
They only got chased for a second? 🤨
---
Thanks for posting
---
So true
---
i’ve never seen a nurse go this hard and honestly i’m impressed and terrified
---
Its probably because you are better at survivor than killer, as killer I can get a few kills pretty easy and feel super relaxed and have fun but as survivor I suck and get chased for 2 seconds before going down
---
he bear traps just slow down the game, but she's fun as hell if you out a bit of time into her.
---
This is some quality comedy I don't understand
---
it was on their twitter
---
Ive been playing for 2 years
---
Nothing else you can do basically lol.
---
Hes just securing a kill
---
R15, only just started playing again
---
Archives will be a good step though
---
Well they sure do bitch about it non stop.
---
Nice work!
---
Why are killers bound by survivors made up rules though mone exist for killer.
---
bubba for bbq and chili.
---
if you are a green/purple rank killer this perk can help you,
---
if you only care about the killer I would say Myers he is fun to play in those ranks.
---
(I have two months without playing so I don't know if the perk was nerfed)
---
It was a waxing accident
---
PSN: Medic7223
---
wE. did it boys
---
I don't understand why Freddy is given so much crap. Out of all the DLC killers, his power is most fun to play with for me.
---
I like it. It is great late game if you want to do a three gen strategy. It helps slow down the game a little bit, and it’s almost like a surveillance perk with how often survivors fail the skill check. 
---
It does take some effort to keep it in play, you need to constantly patrol and prioritize gens in order to make it effective.
---
Today some David who let me grab him of my totem twice called me a camper after the game because I didn't let his swf friends save him instantly by teleporting to my traps near the hook a couple seconds later (Hag)

I’m not sure what the solution is, but I know Mori-ing(?) doesn’t save time, so the two hook thing wouldn’t be incentive.  I’d maybe have an ebony allow you to mori two instead of everyone.  I’m not sure what the solution would be, but I know I don’t even like them when I’m a killer.

I like Pig, but if you don't have BBQ and Chili you may want to really consider Leatherface.  The grind is already insanely long, but BBQ can help ease some of it.

Your missing the sunglasses but really good

You’re one of those people

Nah, just needlessly dickheaded.

Then you just end up killing 2 guys at best

That cosmetic will never come to be face it
---
Please someone tell me what this original pic said without the marker on it
---
Haha thanks man when I first played her I just kept throwing up wondering why they won’t go down lol
---
Well, that really is a mortar bombardment of value.
---
[removed]
---
I think so. A mori is a very powerful item. Eliminating one survivor by itself prematurely has a massive snow ball effect, almost guarentees hatch game unless the killer took a looong time to catch their first person. 
---
Id make it so:
---
You can mori one person originally, one hook and then done. After you mori the first person, in order to mori another, a gen has to be completed (if you mori someone with 4 gens left, then you can mori another who has been hooked when there are 3 gens left). When all generators are completed, everyone can be mori'd. That's just my idea
---
no
---
\*\*Tunneling intensifies\*\*
---
Honestly. All i see are memes and i really want to know what it actually said
---
Ha. I love it.
---
He’s given so much crap because he has no tools to help him catch survivors. That’ll be changed with his rework.
---
I love this comment.
---
If this is tunneling for you idk what to tell you. And no you dont lose pressure since at high ranks injured survivors still do gens without healing, your best bet is to go for the weaker target hook him again and keep the pressure up since you still have 1 on the hook or even better dead and you can easilly guess where the other went or use the bbq and chili proc.
---
your skills are to be feared
---
I was actually looking more into this the other day and I found this wiki page super helpful, hope it does for you too! 
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Realms
---
*Lion King theme plays*
---
I despise clown. For me, throwing bottles really just isnt that fun. But that's not my main problem, my issue is that intoxicated survivors still vault over pallets just as quickly. Those safe pallets which youd think is what clown would be good for become safe again once the pallet is thrown down, and when you break it they'll just go to another safe pallet. Survivors really won't get corralled anywhere because theyll just be vaulting pallets
---
For killer youtube 3 gen strategy. For survivor Claudette has self heal which will help out a lot and Kate has Windows of Opportunity which gets you used to window and pallet placement. Think preemptively more than in the moment to stay ahead of your opponent. Don't trust other survivors, they want to survive with or without you.
---
Why isn't it a mechanic than?
---
Gamer rage moment
---
I think it's not so much a glitch as the survivor just hasn't finished loading in and their connection is bugged out.
---
Make Your Choice or also Borrowed Time because that one seems to be popular lately
---
Or "Tunneling ass hoe" after you go after the easy 1 shot claudette just off the hook rather than the healthy Jake Park who sucks at chases and can easily be caught later (I may or may not be quoting and perfectly describing a match I played)
---
Ds is really the only one that helps with tunnelling though if they suspect you have ds they'll slug you till it runs out, as for camping, you either hope your team has borrowed time and hope it isn't a leatherface.
---
Can attest that people get very salty in this game and you should just ignore it lol
---
Thank you! I didn’t even realize it was my cake day today lol
---
Crutch perks are a dumb term overall.
---
Oof. EGC gives me a ton of anxiety and THIS was super anxiety inducing. 
---
Amazing escape!
---
You sound like you play survivor
---
No.
---
Gotcha! Ty for the response, BhVR needs to correct that, also need to ban that person who held the game hostage.
---
I... actually really like it. I mean I don’t play Wraith, but I think it looks kinda cool.
---
Against SWF that blindly rush in and get themselves killed over a single save? Yes. Against survive with friends that have communication skills, looping skills and know how to play the game, absolutely not. Again it’s not about winning it’s about actually enjoying yourself I’ve had 1 kill games that were an absolute blast to play
---
Agreed

---
LMAO good shit
---
They’re not lmao. Your job as killer is to fucking kill survivors and you’re not going to win in a toxic survivor’s mind anyway. Play nice and get a 4 escape? GGEZ, babykiller. Play nice and get a 4 man? You’re still trash. Play to the best benefit of your game regardless of if it’ll be fun for the other side and get a 4K? Tunneling/camping/cheating piece of shit. Know what all the words those people say mean when you? Absolutely nothing. Just relax and play the game. You’ll win some and you’ll lose some and ignore whatever some ignorant child or salty ass player has to say to you. It’s a video game that has no real impact on your life anyway.
---
It’s completely up to you. 
---
That being said, it can be helpful to switch between leveling your mains and leveling others for teachables. The more teachables you unlock, the more perks available in the bloodweb, often making it take longer to get the perk you want. 
---
So if you want Bamboozle, I would Level Clown for it, then maybe level your mains to get it before getting another teachable. It’s all personal preference but let me tell you as someone with all teachables unlocked, it can take FOREVER to get that perk you want on another killer because there is just such a big pool of possible perks and 3 tiers of each.
---
This image is what I see during sleep paralysis
---
Hence the “you’re bad” comment posted at the end of my comment
---
There was a video of a claudette throwing a pallet on a Nea then flashlighting her while she was vaulting it. I think thats what started it.
---
perhaps a celebration of the 3 years now that the event is over!
---
Adrenaline could still make sense if you have it be just the heal up.
---
Recently ive put up with 0% of their little fuckery.
---
Does it really matter? It just means that “you’re bad” because you didn’t kill the higher ranked players, even though rank means nothing at all. Literally nothing.
---
1. SCP 106
---
2. Some sort of Knight
---
3. Red from Us
---
4. Jason (Pls)
---
I'd love to see some killers from more obscure horror movies like My Bloody Valentine. I'd also like to see something a bit more on the "creature" side of things as the killers in the game right now are very human, being spirits or just big, slightly disfigured people.
---
Those were the best 9 minutes of my life.
---
How tf can they report you for camping when BHVR said themselves they call it viable in some cases. Doors are open, only one survivor hooked? Camp the shit out of them, absolutely. Camping is annoying but even I’ll admit that survivors use that word as a scapegoat.
---
Wait, it is? Huh.
---
reloading your hatchets quicker.
---
Actually, Rank, is meant as a way to divide players based on their skill levels. The way the divide is based on players performance, they have a higher rank than me, meaning they should be with a higher rank killer. There, do you understand now?
---
being oddly specific makes it funnier imo
---
\*Hook someone\*
---
\*Team unhooks them immediately\*
---
\*Hook them again\*
---
"Why the hell are you camping, dude?"
---
Are you supposed to sprint away from survivors unhooking eachother right in front of you and let them go then?
---
And blood in general is red.
---
A medkit is better than self care imo, I would run #2 but with Iron Will or something else replacing self care personally.
---
her hair is still blonde. it’s more red at the top where it got drenched, but it’s not red hair.
---
The Pig isn’t too great either. She can hide her terror radius, dash attack, and can slow the game down though. Making her better than Freddy.
---
yeah it should be, it's already the 3rd of july in Europe and as i remember the anniversary went until the 2nd, i could be wrong though
---
Why keep the post up if there's an identical one already?
---
Practicing a lot. OhTofu has some great tutorials on Billy
---
My luck is so bad when playing there, and i really get out.
---
on the otherhand I love playing on The Game maybe because I love Saw franchise and I main Pig and most stealth killers work there best so it makes  me jump more than other maps. Also it looks more interesting than Larry's institute for me.
---
I think killers who run agitation/mad grit/iron grasp/infectious fright and chase survivors around while carrying someone on their shoulder are funny
---
Looks pretty fucking red to me last time i checked.
---
[Here’s her p3 head](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/3/34/GS_Head01_P01.png) 
---
here, just in case you needed a refresher on what she looks like.
---
Borrowed Time and We’ll Make It are both fantastic rescue perks. Botany Knowledge can also help out a bit. Though the heal isn’t as fast as WMI, you don’t have to unhook for it to be available.
---
I would like Jason as well but friday the 13th game exists so we probably wont get him soon (sadly)
---
Same experience here. Sigh.
---
For being from a franchise consisting of some of the most creative kills in horror movie history... Freddy’s is very lackluster. I know it’s a reference to a kill from the remake (which this Freddy is from), but there was so much missed potential.
---
A survivor climbed the rock and did a tbag thinking I wouldn't know this glitch. I did this exact move with Ghostface and did a tbag back
---
I mean, I spent a week spending all my bloodpoints into Myers to get him to prestige 3 level 50. So I would grind BP's with him (Because he has BBQ and ruin all all the good perks) but I would run out of add ons. 
---
Should I just try and get BBQ and Ruin on my mains 1st before trying to get the other teachables? Since if I did the latter it would take me longer to get the "core" perks.
---
&gt;Totem spawns keep changing.
---
You know, I was playing a game on Wrecker's Yard today in Autohaven today and thought about how untrue this is for this particular map. 
---
Every totem is generally in the same generic spot between a couple tires. 
---
I'm sure there are other ones where this is also the case, but it's really bad on this map. Searching for totems is just mindless easy.
---
That is the old model.
---
Base survivors have no abilities at all, it's not a base mechanic because that's why perks exist.
---
Billy: **Yare yare daze**
---
Don’t let the Survivor bug you, he’s salty that he died. A pip is basically a win, double pip is a flawless,  and a safety pip is a tie, at least in my eyes.
---
Looks like you Hex: Ruin a good pair of jeans.
---
Adrenaline isn't exactly an ability
---
What other skin would they be talking about?
---
It is exploiting a bug but until it's noticed and used it won't be fixed.
---
I've seen good nurses and bad nurses. Good nurses deserve their kills as I think it takes a bit of skill of getting used to the teleporting shindig.
---
I just accepted in this game that every killer has perks/quirks that some people may disagree in them but hey ho, guess that's how the cookie crumbles probably.
---
Okay first, chubby? Ouch. Idk why you’re attacking me when I’m not the one fighting you. I took your initial criticism and responded nicely, if I cosplay her for real I will get a different wig, again thanks for your input. Like, cmon dude. You’re the kind of person that makes people hate this game’s community for being so toxic.
---
It's not really rules, it's standards.
---
Well, survivor mains treat them like rules but they're not.
---
But camping and hard tunneling are 1 no fun for the other players and 2 keeping you at lower ranks/not honing real killer skills, your punishing yourself (not you I'm speaking generally)  if you hard tunnel the same person through 4-5 loops your just giving the other 3 players copious amounts of time to rip through gens. Same with camping.
---
Play like you don't give a fuck, an the stress will melt away.
---
Honestly I was distracted by the reeds and light making out a really creepy face or somethin.
---
Dark cosmetics in general have been lightened, like the hag skin, or darker / black clothing for survivors.
---
Thanks a lot, I've been trying to find some more in depth beginner stuff. This is a big help
---
Healing a health state on the spot and getting a speed boost sounds like and ability to me.
---
What post is this originally from?
---
Get overcharge, it's such an underrated perk. People trip it up more than you think, especially if they don't know you have it.
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣 you’re good at making a meme
---
Now I just lost the game, crap.
---
Yeah the massive cock thing comes in handy
---
Not attacking anyone here. A girl deserves her donuts. You're not slim either so why lie
---
I'm pretty sure it was because a lot of Nea's at the time would sandbag people in some way, thus leading to someone getting captured.
---
Nice, I've been wanting overcharge for a build ive been wanting to try out, but I just don't want to put bloodpoints into the Doctor lol
---
They should probably fix the base game before they try to add stuff like this (if they were going to do it at all)
---
E
---
Nurse: Pallets don’t affect me
---
Billy:
---
Get rid of keys and all Moris except for ebony. Rework ebony to only worry after two hooks. I sometimes like to use Ebony moris because it adds a cinematic feel to the match and it feels more like a horror movie, but I only mori people on death hook.
---
Quote from Peanits:
---

---
    This one is a little bit of an oversight. The game takes your rank from after the match, not the start. In addition, these stats were collected from April 1st to April 7th. This was when it was significantly harder for survivors to pip. So what ended up happening was that most of the survivors that died would derank and count as a rank 2 death, whereas those who survived would remain at rank 1 and count as an escape. It was very rare to die at rank 1 and not derank at that time.
---
    In short, it's actually much closer to 43% if you took the starts from a week later.
---
But P3 claud is known for being one of the hardest skins to see in the game. No way they didn't change it.
---
It's unchanged iirc.
---
I mean according to the killer handbook, toolboxes are considered toxic so...
---
This "you can't do this it's part of the X mains handbook" is really old, both sides do it equally so pretending like it's a Survivior exclusive thing is dumb. 
---
Killers hate D strike, Adrenaline, MoM, Toolboxes, medkits, Flashlights, keys, OoO, Urban Evasion, all exhaustion perks, Deliverance, Borrowed time and pretty much any perk that helps Surviviors at all. 
---
Surviviors hate Noed, Facecamping, hitboxes, window vaulting getting fucked, juggling, etc.
---
Go ahead and do it :)
---
I mean I didn’t REALLY Bm him, the hatch had just opened. It was just kinda a quirky play yknow
---
SEIG HEIL!
---
I agree. This is a moment where camping is viable. But to go back and what the last guy said..bc as for this reddit. .welcome to DBD where the killer is always right and survivors are toxic
---

I never claimed to be thin? I’ve actually never even commented on my weight at all. You’re the one who randomly brought it up to win an internet argument about the colour of a character’s hair. Cmon dude just stop being a dick and just leave with dignity
---
That's the cosmetics I use except I use the brown hair
---
I don’t mean that’s all I do. But rather than face camp that’s my alternative
---
I generally chase gennies though
---
Not to the person being camped. Not a very fun experience for them
---
I honestly have no clue but it's 2 maps I believe
---
It's endgame collapse (aka EGC). I'm new to the game but I'm pretty sure this happens when there is one survivor left and all the generators have been fixed. I think it also has something to do with the hatch (the killer can close the hatch or something?)
---
I started playing killer and I feel yeah  it's not easy as survivor lmao but just have fun out there :)
---
Had a spirit do that to me when I was having a bad day...
---
Big main, pig brain
---
So wait ... the killer just stood there wasting everyone's time?
---
Killer lobbies were busted for a while for me too but tonight they were very quick.  I'm back to getting instalobbies.  PS4 if it matters.
---
Are there any plans to fix some achievements that have been made nearly impossible (killer adepts and ESPECIALLY left behind among a few others)
---
Isn't Trapper considered bottom tier right now?
---
S without a doubt
---
[My own post lol.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c7ogqd/in_response_to_another_post_and_the_comments_it/)
---
yeah kyf is buggier than public matches are
---
nah people need to learn how to play him since his traps can stop a chase instantly
---
he more b or a tier
---
we cant communicate so we dont know what the others are thinking or were they are so the most logical thing if someone get hook near me wait until  you leave to save them.
---
Thank you, comrade Dyatlov.
---
Are you able to make these wall papers? They look amazing!!
---
Me too man
---
Yeah I definitely feel this way. 
---
I consider myself a killer main because that's what I like most about the game yet I still play survivor more often when I just wanna play the game "casually." Imo playing killer is more stressful since it's more important to not waste time with everything you do. But I try to remind myself that survivors wanna survive obviously so if they get away they had fun and if I pip then I still "won" in a way. I just try to keep papa entity happy and that doesn't have to mean dominating
---
I’m thinking something along the lines of the types of killer mains.
---
Cheers lad
---
Does anyone even know that stonk is a military slang for firing mortar shells
---
Yes, everyone who has seen that meme
---
Breaking the games balance just sucks for all sides and leads to an unfun match regardless. We see this with:
---
* keys
---
* instaheals
---
* mori's (except for the yellow one)
---
* stacking BNP's
---
* Some killer ultra rares - like huntress's Iri head
---
They all need to be reworked and fixed because being on the receiving end of any of these just sucks. Getting mori'd off first hook feels lame and having a survive instaheal in your face and delay a chase another minute is also just bullshit.
---
Changes:
---
* Pink and Green Mori's now work only after 2 hooks. They are simply a cinematic way to kill survivors and may save you time not walking them to a hook.
---
* The yellow mori has been removed - instead, it has been added as a default part of the killer loadout as a reward for downing the final survivor. Killers shouldn't be forced to burn an offering to see the cool animations and it gives a sense of "finality" to finishing off that last survivor.
---
* Instant heals are now only usable on allies and require the medkit to be at full charges to be used. This way they can't stack a stypic with another addon and heal with it before using the instant heal. Additionally, it will require teamwork to be useful. Still OP, but much less so.
---
* Keys can now only be used to open a hatch that the killer has shut or if the gates are already powered, but not to leave the game and get a free win early. Keys in essence work as a 3rd way to escape for a group of survive who already made it to endgame, or they stack the 1v1 odds more in the survivors favor. They no longer allow a killer game that is going great to just end because "LUL KEY".
---
* Many killer ultra rares need changes but this list is getting very long. As a rule of thumb killer ultra rares should spice up gameplay to make them different in some way, but not VASTLY stronger. A good example of this is Michael's ultra rares that require so much stalking that the game is almost over before he goes full EW3 mode.
---
Yay I have all of the perks again
---
K cause i get confused every time i see this meme knowing that it’s mortar shells but the meme is about stocks
---
That’s a twist.
---
This was survive with friends.
---
He doesn’t hate vests, but that’s about it
---
What are those? I haven't seen them
---
Iridescent Stone in Trapper and Coarse Stone on Huntress
---
a fair and balanced killer.  
---
Like christ, they out here nerfing ghost face when this thing is untouched
---
Didn’t know billy was mountain goat XD
---
dafuq
---
What do they do?
---
i love it when memes reach this stage
---
The Iridescent Stone causes one of the Trapper’s traps to automatically open itself at random every 30 seconds. The Coarse Stone just makes hatchets cause the Hemorrhage status effect for 30 seconds.
---
I had a four man swf team thrashing my baby Billy on xbox and I think they felt so bad about it that they decided they wanted to farm a bit.  It was a nice touching moment.
---
Got it
---
What an entitled little cunt you sound like. What, a quick Google search after his ‘worthless’ reply wouldn’t suffice? Still had to get the answer spoonfed to you and then you patronise him with ‘there we go’? What a Nea Karlsson you are.
---
No get wraiths suit and tie with anything else and and your golden
---
Yeah classic is just around the corner can't wait :P i can ruin my life again like i did 15 years ago when i started WoW.
---
Not sure if you're trolling me, but yes i would like that if you want..
---
That's Francis from left 4 dead palio
---
This is just confirming that nea (and probably other survivors) are the real killers.
---
I just had the worse luck that billy was always around the corner when I play it.
---
I have some bbq offerings on my characters
---
you're right
---
Wish there was a way to get those scrubbed or swapped or something haha
---
Holy shit that’s way too good for my eyes it burns! Argh!
---
Reported for Hacking
---
I'll take your advice i guess, its the best ive got right now, thanks
---
imagine thinking this is material worth sharing
---
real clownery luv
---
Sheen: and THIS is Overcharge!
---
But yeah it really does feel like we've seen these perks a million times. Bond was in the shrine a few weeks ago, we get Overcharge almost every other shrine, knockout was in the shrine a few weeks ago and everyone was complaining we finally got a leatherface perk, but the wrong one (again, because Franklin's was on there very recently too). Only one that's not recent is Botany but I think that might have been on there a few weeks ago too.
---
The heck is that?
---
It is funny that this post is now a meme.
---
An offering related to the Hallowed Blight event from Halloween 2018.
---
When the entire lobby brings Gruesome Gateaus
---
What a stupid stupid comment man.  It's a toxic killer breaking the games policies by holding a game hostage.  Why wouldn't you report that shit?
---
thanks for not being a fuckin dumbass
---
Yes, but I am more interested in sprint burst. I miss the days where you could use it in chases. I find it almost useless now and niche.
---
When the killer is trash so you have to dab on him
---
does this really upset you that much? can you just... idk let people enjoy things lol. if you dont like that than dont buy or sell cosmetics or accounts from those people, but why are you so mad that others want to?
---
Ehh I wouldn’t put billy above myers while Billy’s instadown is faster to use his is beaten outright by windows
---
plague mains do you have any basic advice to share with baby plagues?
---
Unfortunatly I need you to not have this so... Meet your demise
---
Sloopy butcher instead of you second perk, and maybe thrill of the hunt instead of the third perk you have equiped
---
I get you in mood. Show some leg
---
No its globally recognized that the nurse is BS

Base game is more than fixed from a year ago

I don't have those perks

You actually got banned? What was the reason?
---
You dropped your flashlight.
---
It’s still riddled with so many problems and issues. They have improved it, but it’s still not ready for major changes to gameplay or new game modes. I think the game needs to be recoded, as they were completely different (and very inexperienced) developers when they first started the game, which may be why so many things randomly break every update.
---
MAh boi Aceu
---
I'll give your recommended set-up a try! Ty
---
This meme is getting a lot of milage jeez
---
Unrelenting doesn't help much, if you want to be really effective with Huntress you want to give em the 1-2 combo, *yeet'em delet'em*.
---
Distressing can help with point gains, but I'd recommend *Thrill of the Hunt* instead if you want extra points and to slow 'em down. Lots of survs really start sweating once any hex is up, and may wind up wasting a lot of time (and hits) trying to get rid of it.
---
A tracking perk would also be really helpful, *survellience, overcharge,* and *discordance* all help give some defensive tracking so you know which gen to check next. Since Huntress is somewhat slower movement wise, that extra bit of info can be instrumental in striking down the competition, and even *squeezed* for those big fat bloodpoint gainz in the event of a 3-4 genlock.
---
Tofu's videos are great! Ardetha also has similar ones that helped me a lot
---
👏👏👏👏👏

This literally happened to me today. Dwight gang

As a Tapp main,

WAHHHHHHHZZZZZAHHHHHPPPPPAAPPPPPP!!
---
Let’s just say we had 2 Claud’s.
---
To beat her, to have to plead to the entity to ruin all her blinks.
---
I had the same thing with bill it was Unbreakable
---
Adreiline and DS Dance With Me And Open handed
---
Idk. She had a good skin
---
I don't have the tracking perks yet but I'll keep them in mind! Ty
---
How is he like Freddy? He is way better than Freddy in his current state.
---
Needs more booty short
---
No tea bagging, standing at the gate, body blocking, flashlights Haddonfield, hugging main buildings. Some of the killer made of rules for beginners.
---
Yes
---
@ Almosteveryfuckingwraithplayeroneearth
---
Fr i will never understand them camping and bing-bong spamming just because I ran away and hit them with a PALLET
---
When i play leatherface I leave unless they swarm the hooked person as soon as they get hooked then it’s not my fault
---
Omg a Plague cosplay would be so siiick!! (pun intended) Love this cosplay of yee haw Kate tho! Looks well-thought out and edited nicely :D Great job!
---
Billy can use his for basic transportation and gen pressure. Myers gets gen rushed to oblivion.
---
Happy to help, she's my first full prestige killer and still my all-time fave
---
It’s like at 1.9 dude
---
No, you're mixing them. A bug is something that isn't supposed to exist in the code, an exploit implies that it uses fully functional game mechanics in an unintended way. They sound similar but it's a difference of how they came to exist. If say you find a way to attack with invisible as Wraith, that's a bug. It's not how the game is supposed to work and exists because the code isn't functioning correctly. But if you find some kind of way to muffle the sound of uncloaking as Wraith through pieces of terrain that block sound too much, that's an exploit. The pieces are working as intended, but they were never intended to be put together in that way. The result is usually the same, they make the game work in a way it's not supposed to, but one is caused by the code being done wrong and the other is coded just fine but was designed without accounting for a certain player behavior.
---
I feel like killers need to have specific emotes for those wonderful survs
---
Dbd devs have banned tons of streamers for literally showing them these types of bugs
---
ive posted it before as well but my post was locked.... it was survivors up there though
---
It does, but it crashed my game unfortunately
---
Actually came here to say "Please no."
---
Playing during the dark times is like having PTSD
---
*gets a game and immediately gives suggestions on what is OP*
---
Epic
---
Eh, still depends on context. As a killer, you can't ever trust the survivors even when they're right in front of you. Taking that free hit, if you don't get the second quickly you effectively lose the pressure and only get potential damage as a reward. If that survivor slips from you, you went from an advantage to a total failure.  
---
Now since I mostly play Huntress I always take those hits, if I can't hit the hatchet afterwards (like 90% of the time I miss but whatever) it was my own fault, but if my aim IS good I turn altruism into my gain. BUT I'll be the first to admit I am ass at chasing survivors, the moment they get into a good loop if they're not injured I have to seriously consider it a loss. So when I know someone is injured, I definitely want them more than the healthy one. Their margin for error is infinitely lower. I try to have to pick, but if I do I need to go for that faster kill because time isn't on my side.
---
Big pig, main brain
---
This made my heart jump put of my chest. r/unexpected
---
You can try this
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdpFfmIzZ74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdpFfmIzZ74)
---
Yeah, sounds good.
---
Not to be confused with the Operator.
---
Crap, let my cough medication run out again.
---
It's a good suggestion. Huntress lullaby is a pretty bad perk because it more often than not gets broken before it has any impact. Thrill of the hunt will give you a warning before that happens.
---
You can use any add ons or offerings as long as you only use those 3 perks. Wouldn't recommend moris though, as it hurts your emblem score.
---
I hope not I like it
---
but like, is he fun though

Oooh that's hot.
---
You look amazing! Now do a Nea cosplay and stay in a crouched position for 20 whole minute,you know,to get into character
---
You'll stop feeñing that way soon don't worry
---
H a h a
---
You guys see cleavage and comment like it is a good cosplay.
---
As a Hag main, I fucking loooove making me flip shit.
---
Holy fuck, TLDR
---
That’s real — adding
---
Ok 4Head
---
You mean the build 90% of killers run? What if I told you, you can still win with none of those perks?
---
no lies detected
---
Would the skits be about the PLAYERS or about the characters? Or maybe a combination of both If you get what I mean
---
"gen grabbing bs"  It's not like survivors can rush gens and get out in 5 minutes, god forbid we let them get 1 grab on a lucky guess.. Even if you do guess the gen right you have to guess the right side too.
---
Getting hit through windows is fair, you can hit people through windows irl too.  Survivors already have a clear advantage for vaulting, and since getting grabs is kinda busted rn anyways, hitting through windows is okay imo.  Otherwise loops get even more fun for killers.
---
main main, brain brain
---
Where’s the original
---
Isn't being forced to play the game illegal? Few laws extend to the internet, but being forced to partake in something still constitutes slavery. &gt;:P
---
Its rules are not binding.
---
I wanna try out some builds that fit my gameplay and I don't want to risk losing a good reward by trying something new
---
To SlOw ThE GaMe DoWn
---
That's something you're gonna have happen to you. Just keep practicing. Then when you master her, the spins will be second nature and you'll expect them.
---
TLDR
---
Of course if someone is encouraging people to use exploits on the killer side it gets upvoted but if this was an exploit that benefited survivors and someone said "Oh I'm gonna use that now :)" it would get downvoted to hell.
---
Sometimes waiting for a 30 minute lobby time I'm thinking I did my job.
---
No. There is very little purpose in rank.
---
Exploit 100% and hopefully bhvr bans any killer that repeatedly abuses it.
---
My thoughts exactly lol
---
f
---
Tbh you can build up a pretty good inventory without spending a single blood point if you just go into games and bumrush the chests
---
It requires the rest of the survivors to actually do gens, but hey.
---
Yeah, makes sense.
---
Btw cool flair person that doesn't own legion.
---
Seems like BHVR did...a pretty good job so far
---
Why are people complaining about this meme? It's funny...
---
More like
---
"Shes a killer who straight up ignores legitimate game mechanics and is nothing more than a killer bitches who can't win loops use because learning is hard"
---
I'm a killer main so you can stfu with that "I cant beat her" bullshit
---
The problem is that a good nurse will completely demolish a team, and her only counterplay is stealth and that is not a strong tactic againts anyone else.
---
I think overcharge is for lower ranks and pop goes the weasel is for the higher ranks
---
Overcharge:lower ranks tend to miss the skill check and you will know where they are. In lower ranks, (from what I think) most killers tend to have a harder time finding and hooking survivors, so pgtw wouldnt see much use in those games, but overcharge will help the killers find survivors. The extra regression is nice.
---
Pop goes the weasel:overcharge in higher ranks is almost completely useless, and when not, is much outclassed by pgtw. Experienced survs will hit the skill check, so it's pretty much useless. But if they mess it up, as long as you're not losing the game, you'd most of the time already be in a chase, so the "tracking" part is useless. It does regress the gen by 11%, but is outweighed by pgtw's 25%. You'd also be getting hooks frequently, so pgtw should see a lot of use. And the extra regression can come in so clutch closer to the end of the game.
---
Idk why I even wrote this. I guess who ever sees this and doesnt know which to use, if you're an experienced killer who gets lots of hooks and can track well, use pop goes the weasel, as it has such better stats than overcharge, but does require hooking. So if you're not that experienced and have some trouble finding survs, overcharge is for you, as it can be activated anytime, without being on a timer.
---
I dont have pop goes the weasel yet(I'm actively trying to get it), but pretty much every game I play a can find a time where pop goes the weasel would have really helped me out, and would definitely have been worth a perk alot and exchanging another one of my perks in my loadout.
---
Also, can I use this time to say that nurse's is a tad overrated? I use nurse's on my huntress and I dont use it on my spirit, and I honestly dont have any trouble using spirit. I would switch nurse's for pop goes the weasel. I mean, sure, it can tell you if people are still healing at the hook or not, or if there's that one random self caring, but again, most of the time you'd he in a chase, and wouldnt really need it. Bbq's where the shit's at though(great fucking perk)
---
Welp, have a good day and thanks for reading my babbling lmao. I just really felt bored, so I wrote this
---
Thats when you slug everyone and spam them until they bleed out/disconnect
---
Nay, thee
---
This is why you leave at the gate
---
Just show that we have the expose effect when it's activated.
---
Ummm, would like some context, I'm a bit lost
---
I realize it was. Im just saying increasing percentages means nothing now with deliverance. The prayer beads are broken seeing that spine chill and just being aware of your surroundings. All im saying is everytime i see these theu dont really buff the killer side and I want stronger killers to go against.
---
I was playing Billy and I was doing pretty good. 3 survivors DC’d and the last one got the hatch. Best response
---
I bugged the game and saw this. I joined my friend’s lobby and got this. Exiting returned me to the main menu. Had to rebbot my pc.
---
It'd become instantly meta due to the fact that most killers cannot manage their time in chases and often get tunnel vision, causing them to chase the same survivors for the whole game.
---
Gotcha,  thx chief
---
Np
---
To be fair survivor exploits don't tend to be that fun for anyone except the exploiter.
---
Nerf the challenges
---
I'm A huntress main and I'm rank 18 yellow killer but I the game is giving me rank red 4's and green rank survivors, so my throwing hatchet is basically useless for me
---
# Save the best for last..
---
&gt;!still coming for you tho.!&lt;
---
Ironic
---
I can't imagine being so toxic that you think the nurse is an okay killer and not just a broken mess
---
cool story
---
Nice but if ghostface was in shrouded hunt he wouldn't have a red stain. Unless your in a chase and he is just passively raising his knife. Otherwise good cosplay
---
Wake Up! has been vengfully nerfed.
---
Anal beads Spirit can gtfo
---
The first 2 fatasses will not share food.
---
What is the counterplay to a hillbilly right up on you revving his chainsaw, every single Billy game i get this is the only way they down anybody, it seems like you can't get away from it since doubling back doesn't seem to work?
---
As a Dwight main,
---
I understand your point. However, given the opportunity to share icecream or to gave no icecream, I feel like they would sacrifice a larger portion to have any at all
---
The Nurse, The Hillbilly and The Spirit
---
Plague: "The fuck is ice cream?"
---
I honestly wont believe anyone claim till i see clips. I never run into these issues.
---
You don’t actually have to hook them, you could literally just stand there and farm chase points for the both of you. 
---
I had a match yesterday where the wife and I were running around tea bagging and setting off firecrackers and bubba left us alone. It was a nice change of pace for once and we all got plenty of points and quickly moved on to another match. 
---
I’m a killer main too, so I get it, but that doesn’t mean we have to be dicks all the time. There’s plenty of times I’ve farmed or let that one person go because the rest of their team are morons who don’t know what teamwork is. 
---
End of the day, it’s a game, a game we play to have fun, grind ranks/levels, and get shit done, but you don’t have to focus on the seriousness all the time. That’s when it starts feeling a chore.
---
**TL;DR Don’t be a jackwaggon.**
---
Myers doesnt seem like the eating type.
---
In DBD the killer hosts the game, a dedicated server essentially makes Behavior host the game.
---
Yes im the toxic one. I said shes good, she just has a very high skillcap. A mediocre nurse is easy to deal with but a good nurse is incredibly challenging to win against. Those good nurses worked their asses off to get that good with her so they deserve to utilize how oppressive her ability is. 
---
If you want to find the toxic one look in the mirror. This playerbase is obsessed with nerfing things just because they are powerful. Powerful things are allowed to exist, ESPECIALLY when they come with a very high skill cap. With something like the old decisive that was different because it was very powerful but with a very low skill cap. So that rightfully was nerfed. But nurse has a very high skill cap so she does not need to be nerfed since her ability is hard to master and she is VERY heavily punished for making mistakes.
---
Destroy totems or leave a man behind
---
Is this from a movie? This was really well done.
---
Because for people who are already good at skill checks and looping, stealth might be harder? Or just to be extra safe or to make that loop last longer because they couldn’t hear you grunting? But even without stealthy perks you can play stealthy. So you can counter the nurse with stealth if you needed to regardless of perks, just like you can loop without perks, but it helps to have the appropriate perks.
---
Imagine complaining about DS and not only that, comparing to NOED.
---
If you don't tunnel, you will rarely get hit with DS and even if you do, you still have the option to slug.
---
I blinked so many times looking at this image oof ouchie my eyes
---
Looks decent, other than the blood. Maybe get something a little darker?
---
Killers perks do need a nerf though. Even without noed I can easily 4k. Most of the time before exit gates get close to being powered. Bad killers need to be buffed and perks need to be nerfed so that the killers with great abilities don’t lose their power but can’t rely off of perks. Noed should definitely be nerfed by a lot so that a struggling team doesn’t get destroyed when they power exit gates. They could just buff survivor heal speed when two people do it so that team work helps stop momentum more.
---
Wait thats illegal
---
Why does it matter?
---
I agree with the first bit. Cannibal is not fun, actually was disappointed at the level of blandness.
---
there are only 3 times when camping is a good idea
---
1. when you have 2 people hooked near each other and have no clue where another person is
---
2.the are rushing the unhook everytime
---
3.when there are 2 people left and you have 1 hooked
---
im not counting face camping thats dumb
---
Great execution and great photoshop/photo manipulation. Good job! The only thing that bugs me is that your arm is sticking out so far from the wall haha.
---
You a new player? I've been playing for like a week myself and I see what you mean bro. I recently played a game were the gates were open and I had a hooked survivor I wanted 100% dead so I straight up camped with no shame because I saw no point in finding survivors more than likely already there waiting to teabag and taunt at the exit.
---
I end up killing him and in the post game chat someone complained about me camping. I asked what else am I supposed to do in the situation where I have a hooked survivor and the gates are open. I explained that looking for other survivors would just get the person unhooked and they'd all escape. He then tries to give me a weak counter argument saying it's better to try and risk getting multiple people than guarantee one kill. Right. Lmao
---
Oof.
---
You can almost always expect to be camped when all gens are done lol. It's normal. More annoying when no gens are done, and it happens.
---
You really should do it! It would be nice to see something along the lines if types of killer mains like you mentioned earlier(make a good one for spirit).
---
That may be true but that makes nurse a counter to that playstyle. Which is perfectly fine. And in high tier you see alot more stealth builds. Or atleast alot more urban evasion, spinechill, and dance with me
---
It's personal taste. I just think the bright ones look for the most part ugly.
---
Curiosity, and also wondering if I'm always connected to SWF smurf accounts and glitter-filled killers.
---
Repost doe lol
---
Ew wtf are those
---
Lol he was standing there before the last gen got done. That was my first hook and he literally stood there the whole time I was on it.
---
No it’s not messed up that’s the the point to close it so no one escapes
---
100% Agree.
---
Wherever I see a twitch streamer in my lobby I bring a green mori. Whenever I see a streamer plus his 3 little buddies I bring an ebony. Save them for those special occasions
---
Lol,  hopefully you're trolling.
---
Do your self a favor and stop reading the after game chat lol
---
I'm sorry, if I was on PC I would have screenshotted it, but I got this daily on PS4 and had to use my phone :(
---
I had a wraith tunnel me and then camped me on the hook right at the start of the game. Was infuriating especially since I deranked.
---
I’m relatively new but what is the Victory Cube?
---
Hahaha startegic. Only the rank 20s use these strategic plays lmao
---
Everyone else: Wow, that is some crazy glitch!
---
Me: 90% of this game is fucking running in circles now. How is it doing so well?
---
I believe most killers who aren't good, feel the need to camp towards the end to make sure they assure those kills. Super annoying, because it's not fun just hanging out on the hook.
---
Then the one person who hasn't been hitting skill checks and being more of a liability
---
 to the team gets there first and starts missing them.
---
I rarely ever play against a Wraith that doesn't camp or tunnel.
---
Toxic is when survivors wait by the exit for the killer to show up before leaving.
---
If only rank 20’s use it, why are you complaining about it? Unless you’re a rank 20?
---
Wait, what the fuck did you want him to do
---
Running around with or without the killer getting all the pallet stuns and chase points. Things like that. Killer downs you, picks you up and drops you, let's you heal then does it again. Basically just "farming" blood points.
---
OK I will try it
---
I enjoy him sometimes but indeed it is more fun/viable to play other killers later on.
---
Although the way he said it was distasteful, I agree with his main message. I'm going to do whatever it takes barring cheating and exploiting to win. That's just how I see it.
---
Doesn’t sound like a problem for anyone who doesn’t suck
---
- Why leave the hook if both gates are open, and you have the a survivor on the hook?
---
- Why leave the hook if they've 3 genned themselves and all generators are around the hook.
---
- Why not tunnel if you have dying light/remember me and it's your obsession?
---
- Why not tunnel if you're getting shit on, and you need to kill a survivor to steer things back in your favor?
---
- Why not tunnel if the survivor you just unhooked ran to a dead zone, while the unhooker runs to a safe place and refuses to take a hit?
---
I camp in the situations explained above, because like /u/mcallisaur said, there are situations where it's strategic.
---
I tunnel in the situations I mentioned, where I'm either running a specific build, am getting shit on and need a death, or the injured survivor runs to a dead zone. If you're sick of getting tunneled run DS. I am able to use it basically every game I put it on. Borrowed time can stop a camper, and if they're realllly face camping, just plow through the gens and punish the guy. Like he said, this behavior usually goes away once you reach the green ranks. I only run into this if I have a twitch streamer in my lobby, or I happen to get paired up with a rank 15
---
Don't use Overcharge in ranks higher than green.
---
It means breaking roles, and cooperating with the other team or not caring about your team and just getting blood points. Like going for the save even though the killer is right there for bloodpoints, or standing in pallets for survivors to slam you, and so you can break them and get points too. It's just grinding for bloodpoints but breaking your role and not caring about winning, just maxing your BP
---
Im rank 3 and dont see it as much maybe its just me. I dont really even get mad at any form of camping seeing as i dont care enough to. If you face camp then youre just dumb seeing as it shows you lack skill. But to my original point I need to see clips because just claiming camping makes me skeptical and I need to see it was camping.
---
That would be straight ass, considering how easy totems are to find. It would never get used
---
Agreed.  Sprint burst used to be one of my go-to perks but now i never bother running it because it is helpful in less than 1% of my situations
---
Small game should definitely have a totem counter on it like TOTH. That way, you aren't wasting minutes trying to find the 5th totem that a random cleansed at the start of the match
---
I mean as a killer if I had to stoop to camping and tunneling I'd feel the victory was a hollow one.  I'd feel that I really lost because I had to pull out all the no skill stops to pull it off.  I don't like having to play like a rank 20 to crutch out a kill.  If you know what you're doing it is entirely possible to defeat your opponents while playing fun competitive games for both sides.
---
I think you might find him fun.
---
I'm guessing if it caused his reaction, it was camping lol. Buuuut, I could be wrong. I'd assume they were tho it is a big problem.
---
"But how else am I supposed to win the game if I don't tunnel!"
---
You can tell if he's complaining about DS, he's tunneling. Which means he's applying pressure to less survivors, meaning they're free to get on gens, meaning he's getting "gen rushed" and needs NOED to help him with those toxic generator focused SWF groups!
---
Lmao meyers practically has unlimited noed. If you play like this youre a babykiller. Don't get mad if you get  tbagged and pointed at in the exit gates
---
No fun generally.  I like to play legit games.  When I do see a killer trying to farm or something I just genrush and peace so I can play an actual game.
---
JuS a LiL biT???
---
Thats not what this would do.  Exhaustion takes 40 seconds to refill to use sprint burst right now.  This would make it so you would have to chase for over 80 seconds before they got another spring burst/dead hard/etc.  
---
Honestly if you are chasing one survivor for 80 straight seconds, they deserve to get away and you should learn to not tunnel vision them
---
I think it's only fun when it's a x2 bp or a bunch of people use a bloody party streamer.
---
Whats wrong with current exhaustion perks?
---
Dead by Daylight is a flawless masterpiece.
---
i dont mind them, at least there interacting with us, better than finding a killer who just goes afk the whole game on purpose.
---
Yea I just tried it on Myers. Worked pretty well. It’s great not having to lose too many stacks when trying to hook the obsession
---
Before anyone gets the chance to comment a certain comment I’ll just put this here in another comment
---
Farming means to use others to get points. This can be done in a positive or a negative way. It can be with the survivors and with the killer. During some events, like double blood point weekends killers and survivors might farm together to get as many points as possible. This would be more positive farming. The inverse would be survivors running in for unsafe saves to get the unhook points or body blocking you to heal you for points. Unsafe hook saves used to be a really common thing because We're going to live forever used to give stacks for any unhook but it has been fixed to only give a stack on safe saves
---
r/dontputyourdickinthat
---
You shouldn't need to camp in the end game either if you're not a baby killer but I'm not gonna keep going back-and-forth about this. Enjoy those tbags my man
---
I still remember my first game. Hiding in corners scared as shit with no perks at all... good times
---
I had that happen then someone said it wasnt fair, they were all around me like wolves in a cartoon. That guy and his friend were both abusing the wake up bug.
---
Me my first week of playing . Now I use Object of obsession for fun . How I've changed
---
Why would I leave the hook if all 3 gens are around me, and no survivors pop up on my BBQ? Rank 20 mindset for expecting me to sprint to the other side of the map. I explained the reasons in which it's smart to camp and tunnel, and you blatantly ignore them. Yes, it's a fucking shitty thing to do if its your first hook of the game, and you just wanna secure your kill. Yes it's a shitty thing to tunnel if the other survivors are trying to body block and you ignore them. But there ARE situations (although not that common) where it's the smartest play to camp. It happens maybe 1/20 games. I am sorry if it happens to you more, but usually at my rank, I only experience it in the situations mentioned above, or when someone has TTV in their name
---
No, the people who wait for you, then sprint-burst through the exit. What you do give killers a higher score, which is kind of nice.
---
both of you are wrong, im not complaining about ds, its a good anti tunneling perk, why problem is people like you saying that noed is op and toxic when it has an extremly easy counter
---
NOED causes me no issue because I don't linger, I open a gate, and I leave, if everyone else did that NOED would loose power. But people get greedy. If you leave, you won't loose points if a survivor gets sacrificed and/or hooked after you leave, so there's no point in saving them. Yes I am a killer main, no I don't use NOED because it can potentially waste a perk slot. Im just saying when I play survivor, I don't wait around or go for any risky saves. It's ridiculous to try and deny the killer any form of victory. Leave and take your win from escaping. That's my philosophy
---
Do you mean the 1 hit would be active at the beginning of the game as well? If so, that would be an interesting idea. You need to clarify what you meant more
---
If you give good chases and get hooks I don’t mind. Farming games though are generally boring for me.
---
The new DS might just be the healthiest perk in the game right now. It is completely useless unless the killer decides to tunnel. Even if you do get down, the counterplay is super easy. Just slug. 
---
It's hard to understand why anyone hates this perk unless they're bad and need to rely on tunneling.
---
no, that would make noed nearly usless, cause then it wouldnt do anything until the end game while saying HEY CLEANS ME
---
What did she do? Nothing I’m assuming. 
---
And NOED on a one shot killer.  
---
Awful clip. 0/10
---
What's missing
---
Lol how is DS a safety net post rework?  It literally only works against babykillers who tunnel off hook.  I literally never get decisive striked period anymore because I always play to initiate new chases and hook different survivors.  You literally do it to yourself as a killer getting d striked.
---
You do not get to have it both ways with NOED.  You can't say survivors are babies for not cleansing totems when you as a killer game planned for failure by bringing in the biggest crutch perk left in the game.  You literally bring NOED to crutch out no skill downs for when you play like shit and lose the gens.  If you ever have interest in actually learning how to properly play killer you'll take it off.
---
And who said word one about running items or instaheals?  I sure didn't.
---
The 20 seconds?
---
Time to fight
---
My serious killer tier list is : 1 Nurse 2 Spirit 3 Hillbilly 4 Hag 5 Huntress 6 Shape 7 Pig 8 Ghost Face 9 Wraith 10 Legion 11 Plague 12 Doctor 13 Clown 14 Cannibal 15 Trapper. 
---
And Freddy is getting a rework.
---
I had a game where i was looking for the survivors for about 5 minutes before i found them all sitting on that loop, teabagging me. Luckely i was ghostface, so i joined them
---
Lmao, the cycle has begun. Regret, denial, but lastly, acceptance.
---
You’re the reason condoms exist.
---
&gt; extremly easy counter
---
In SWF yeah, its easy to keep track of how many totems have been cleansed, and communicate to everyone that you want dulls cleansed. In solo queue? Good. Fucking. Luck.
---
If you're on totem duty, and not gens, your team will get fucking shit on, since you're doing nothing towards helping your team escape. Even if you are doing totems, say you cleanse 4 of them, how do you know if the last totem is hiding somewhere, or if the random just cleansed it at the beginning of the match. Do you waste another few minutes searching for a non-existent totem, or do you pop the last gen and risk NOED taking a fat shit in your face?
---
Thicc
---
What’s ds?
---
Lol gotcha you're one of those survivors.  You are in the vast minority in that mindset my friend.  Any survivor that whines about camps with open exit gates is just a toxic entitled meme of a survivor and impossible to take seriously.  Have fun crying on reddit everytime a killer logically secures their kill with zero objectives left to patrol or defend lol.
---
Lmao yea
---
I suggest discordance, you can mark multiple people and potentially get double downs. Also when a person gets marked they tend to stay away from any objective as to avoid the killer so it adds a small amount of pressure as well.
---
Couple of things I have found to help are to know his power is strongest against a single survivor. It is nice to get a ton marked in a single stalk but his power is strongest against a single survivor.  Also take into consideration how survivors work on gens and other objectives. Most experienced survivors are accustomed to look behind them at all times on gens. Use that to your advantage. Try and approach from the front or the side. Also sometimes you just have to give up on marking them and go for the chase. I have actually found a lot of use for his power during and after a chase in that it let's me see where other survivors are hiding. I trigger it after a hook and a lot of times survivors accidently stark bringing me out and I can use the notification to find them.
---
i run noed cause the only games that i dont use it not all gens get done or they get done in 2 mins you bet im gonna run it after getting 3 games in a row pf all gens getting done in matter of minutes
---
the issue with DS is its powerful even when not running it, it rewards survivors for playing bad you have ZERO way to tell they have DS, unless ypu base it on the obsession, typically you can tell if a survivor has DS, cause they are playing stupid have dumb teamates and run right in front of you, NOED you can tell when someone is running it cause you will see the totem and have the exposed effect when any survivor is hit, even if you cant tell exactly which totem it is
---
What's your Instagram?
---
I can confirm it is fixed. Had a game tonight and the 4 stacks appeared as they should have
---
decisive strike (im not saying it is op im saying complaining about noed is dumb to people who run decisive strike)
---
Ah thanks my dude, glad you explained it :)
---
LOOK, A LUCKY EMBLEM! THIS LOOK LIKE A GOOD SPOT TO FIND SOME INGREDIENTS
---
&gt; have ZERO way to tell they have DS
---
And how many ways can you tell if they have NOED before it hits?
---
You'd... Camp her for looping?... What else is she supposed to do? Wasting the pallet immediately without getting time off of it?
---
- a Killer Main that doesn't see a problem here
---
and how many ways can you tell if they have ds before it hits? the survivor bieng the obsession after they hit you?
---
if it takes 3 mins to cleans all totems, that is your own fault 100%
---
Props to you doing this on console- as a pc guy with console friends it seems very tricky for nurse....
---
This comment made my night lmfaooo
---
Truthfully, I found out about this game from bricky, was interested, watched some videos and was hooked. (Pun intended). Then i started looking up tips and tricks for how to level up fast and try to ride the ground as well as possible
---
Survive with friends
---
100% exploit. Especially since he knew it was there.
---
Fair enough.
---
*run in meg
---
We all scream for doctors icy cream
---
Killer queue seems very quick on Xbox although this is at ranks 17-20 as I’m just getting into the game
---
*Zap*
---
What does Noed and Tunneling mean? Also is the hatch always there or does it spawn when you do a certain amount of generators?
---
If DS is the healthiest perk, NOED is the most crutch perk right now because it's not that it punishes survivors; it's that it rewards even the worst killers. 
---
Either make the killers work for NOED or make not cleansing totems actually reasonable. Something like if there are still three totems left in the game by the time the generators are powered. That way solo survivors aren't fucked if they miss a single totem.
---
Does we’ll make it stack with botany knowledge? I’ve heard you can only have a 100% increase in healing.
---
You are too much man I cannot take this seriously.  NOED is the biggest crutch perk in the game.  It rewards you with no skill downs for playing horribly and losing all the objectives you were tasked with defending.  You know this is how it procs right?  Good killers go into games with the goal of killing survivors with gens up.  
---
And you are the first person I've seen to have the balls to claim reworked decisives to be a crutch.  It is purely an anti tunnel perk.  If you don't camp and tunnel it doesn't work.  It used to be a crutch equal to NOED but then it got reworked and balanced.  MoM also used to be a NOED equivalent crutch that too got reworked but babykillers NOED remains untouched and ready to rock and roll for every noob killer that can't be bothered with learning the mechanics of the game like chasing efficiently, pressuring gens and knowing when to abandon chases.  Your logic is just seriously seriously flawed here man.
---
Mad props, head on really saved you there!
---
So... Tag?
---
I actually like this as a nerf. Doesn’t force her into shit tier and allows counter play for bs hits from nurses that run blink range add-ons
---
so killers should have to work for noed and sirvivors should not get punished for doing its counter BUT with ds, survivors shouldnt have to work for it and killers should get fully punished?
---
Except it isn't 80 seconds. No survivor is straight booking it for 80 seconds. You end up at a loop and play mindgames that involve you standing for a few seconds each loop.
---
How long do you think most chases last? 40 seconds? Maybe 30? 
---
Congrats, you just lopped off half of sprint bursts cooldown *just by being in a chase, that alone guarantees it a perk slot*.
---
Got a buddy to body block/take a hit? Now he just has to loop the killer for 20 seconds before you are back in the game, which mentioned above *isn't hard*.
---
Exhaustion add ons from killers will suffer too. 10s of exhaustion? Yay, I don't have to worry about dead hard or balanc..... *they got away*....
---
Also keep in mind that Higher rank survivors have  a 70-80% survival rate. This will only make the problem worse.
---
Exhaustion is at 40s for a reason. This perk makes it 20 for no extra effort.
---
How do those balls taste babykiller?
---
I do agree with your point though. If you wait all of 3 seconds from me walking away from the hook to rescue, what else am I supposed to do?
---
Old Myers main here, yes he’s good loved him had lots of fun soooo yes if you want him
---
I’ve been playing for about a month and I have had multiple situations where someone complains about me “camping” but it’s starting to occur more recently, so I had to vent a bit on reddit.
---
This is the tier list I have found the agreeable so far. I'd only switch Billy and spirit and put pig mid tier
---
No it doesnt halve the time.  It literally cant.  
---
Lets look at some numbers.  It takes 40 seconds outside of a chase.  You get found a sprint burst away resetting the timer, and the killer gives chase like normal.  40 seconds later the cooldown is only half done.  If you exited the chase right then somehow you would still need another 20 seconds before the cooldown is finished.  That means the cooldown is already increased to 60 full seconds.  Which means its been increased no matter what.  But it *has* lowered the out of chase cooldown, which is the whole point of running the perk in the first place.  
---
I can’t really seeing it being way overpowered like the original exhaustion just refilling during chases was, and would really only apply in some clutch situations when doing perfect chases without mistakes made on either side.
---
A lot of the time it really doesn't make sense. As survivor it's pretty obvious when the killer is tunnelling, so you're leaving 3 survivors completely safe to work on gens uncontested. There are a lot of situations where it's preferable to have 2 survivors occupied with unhooking/healing while you're chasing another, meaning only 1 is working on a gen. Or slugging the person who just got off hook to chase someone else, meaning another person has to get off gens to heal them up. It's not logical at all to tunnel when it means that 3 or 4 gens can pop before the person is even dead.
---
No I got what you were saying I was merely in disbelief.  I saw you attempt to flip everything I said but that only works if you compare like to like but we are talking apples and oranges comparing your free instadown for playing poorly with a perk that keeps rank 20's from camping you to death.  Your logic is very flawed man.  Trying to frame NOED as an anti gen rush counter is mental gymnastics to deflect from the fact that you're incapable of playing without it.  I make the argument that running NOED causes gen rushes because those that run it typically display terrible decision making midgame and stay in chases way too long while not even bothering to pressure the gens which is why they pop quickly because you just say to yourself ehhhh I'll have my instadown I'll be fine.  I didn't learn how to play killer myself properly until I removed it from my loadout and I'm a far better killer for it.  You could be too if you put in the work and work on making smarter choices during the game.  I 4K with Freddy without it for fucks sake lol.  You don't need the training wheels if you know what you're doing man.
---
I felt so bad for noob3 I had that happen the other day I ran the killer around forever and kept evading hoping they were doin bend and the other player was waiting at the hatch for me to die.

---
Good job on the big jugs. What material did you make them from?
---
In all fairness I havent in a long time and I do know how bad 360s are to deal with on console. I dont like ruin cause it only does anything if the survivors are bad. I'd rather use something more interesting.
---
I hate you but I love it
---
Oh yes that ones a classic. I’ve also had that happen to me many times before where I have a survivor hooked and you can see the rest of them surround you but they still complain about you camping.
---
Forget DS. NOEd dis-proportionally punishes solo survivors, which are a complete joke right now. Running around the whole map to get each totem by yourself wastes a ton of time. It's not worth the effort so very rarely will you see a solo survivor actually do that. 
---
SWF, on the other hand, can tell one another exactly how many they've cleansed and where the last one probably is. They're more likely to cleanse all the totems AND efficiently complete gens because they'll always know where the killer is. 
---
If you change it to NOED to a required number of totems still left standing, solo survivors will be much more inclined to cleanse. Or just make it something the killer earns.
---
Yeah upon reflection I probably spent too much time playing closer to the survivor I hooked in order to catch them when they were rescued again but that did not work.  I liked you choice of wording though made me laugh so thanks
---
I mean I know camping can be annoying but it is pretty easy to counter, it sucks being the one that gets hooked but it's a strategy that I don't think will ever go away
---
Icon pack(s) that I use. I link the user who created them in my other comments. If your on occasion you can use them too!
---
&gt;easy to learn
---
HMMM
---
You only do it to people who deserve it
---
I know how you feel, after of a long day of work or anything for that matter this game is the ultimate wind down
---
What tells you that?
---
SURVIVORS are supposed to SURVIVE. It's in the name, what does the killer not understand? Smh
---
I have played two of them so far but I will try them all soon enough and then look up the killers I do not have so thanks for that suggestion as well.  Only been playing as one survivor so far so I will branch out more and try Kate a bit due to your comment.
---
Honestly, that tech has been fixed and then rebroken and introduced over and over for a long time. The fact they've fixed it so many times implies that using it prolly means it's considered cheating so.... just saying.
---
dude, i use noed on 2 killers, and they rarley activate, also it isnt apples to pranges, the free insta down is equivelent to a free grasp escape, and sayong noed causes gen rushing is equal to ds causes tunneling, im a good killer i can promis that, i always get better, i barley run noed, but sayong that it need to be nerfed instead of survivors countering it is stupid, your saying that its not the suvivors fault, its the killers, ds and nked both have easy counters and not countering it is your fault not the others

Yes, it would be awesome if everyone else gen-rushed or flanked a rescue but such is life
---
Should tag this as Rant / Salt
---
Its happy birthday
---
Even a flank rescue against a charged up Bubba really isn't worth the risk he'll just re down you and the other person, when Bubba sets up thats just kinda it if he doesn't feel like moving but as you said such is life just move on to the next game
---
Are the devs just scared of making ghostface, a stealth killer, hard to see? I mean Claudette literally turns invisible with her bloody outfit but for Ghostface they just throw some sprinkles of red and call it a day
---
I guess you are a survivor main. AMIRITE?
---
so an easily countered perk needs to be able to be countered easier, and if your gonna nerf noed that bad adreneline will need a nerf, it has no cpunter, gives a sprint burst and an insta heal, or is having a counterable 1 hit down too op but a free insta heal not?
---
Would've been even better if he t-posed while he did that.

It’s a discussion about streamers and how toxic they are
---
Actually Claudettes Prestige got nerfed so it's easier to see her
---
Because the bloodweb is always regenerating and you shouldn't just be able to bring things like skeleton keys, brand new part, or purple toolboxes into every game.
---
"I can't make a fool out of this killer by just running around pallets and windows so that killer is bullshit, wahhh."

We need to get more upvotes

Same here. But if you don't have BT against Hag, it's pretty hard imo
---
I loved this episode of the simpsons
---
I would love a xenomorph. I would play the shit out of The Alien
---
You clearly aren't a good killer man if decisive is an issue for you.  That means you tunnel so frequently and eat so many decisives that you felt the rage build up to the point where you had to come here and post about it crying about it and labeling it as a crutch which is flat out nonsensical with how it functions now.  Also I didn't call for a nerf to NOED I merely pointed out that it's crutch counterparts on survivor side were completely reworked.  But it's obvious this conversation has went as far as it can.  You're going to continue cheerleading for its use while tunneling your survivors to death and eating d strikes to the face as a result.  Nothing is going to change.  So let's call it a day.
---
I often hear people say Nurse deserves to be powerful because she is difficult to play. I'm not sure if that's what you mean here or not, but I'll throw my two cents in. There are four people on the other side of the screen that are equally deserving of a win. At high levels of play, many people are capable of achieving proficiency with her blink. She needs to be balanced for top level play, even if that makes her inaccessible to new players.  
---
Honestly, I think her power is fine as it is. The add-ons she has access to are what's causing a problem. I doubt the devs realized just how good some people would get after playing her for thousands of hours, and underestimated how much of an impact certain add-ons would have in the right hands. Properly used, the range add-ons make it impossible to juke her, because they also give a shitload of free charge speed. Most experienced players I've talked to share the opinion that Nurse without add-ons is balanced for top level play, but very difficult. I wish they would do something to make her a bit more accessible, and rework the add-ons.
---
I totally agree with u, literally has the easiest mask to see out of all the killers but is “stealthy”
---
If on ps4 I can be your own personal meat shield. I don't care about surviving, so no worries on me sacrificing to get you out.
---
She’s still the hardest survivor to see, even after the “nerf”. Stealth killer should be hard to see. A little extra blood would not hurt and make getting him to P3 actually worth it. He just has some gross webbing and like a drop of blood here and there and that’s it
---
I mainly look at player icons for the static.
---
no, i dont have a problem woth ds, i have a problem that think noed needs a nerf while always using ds
---
I don't think the OP gets your point. Lol
---
My dude, it is not worth the time cleansing all the totems if you are a solo survivor. You could finish at least one generator in the time you would be running around looking for the totems. That's not even counting the cleanse time. That is not what an easily counterable perk is.
---
If they were infinite then you would play against op addons killers with ebony moris every game, it would make game unplayable for survivors.
---
Yeppees
---
It lowers it down to 66%, not 33%. You have to catch them in a chase twice instead of thrice. There are basically no situations in normal play where you can't hook someone you downed, unless you're against a sabo squad or on Badham.
---
Add-on for items/killer powers and offerings can greatly change the chances of winning or losing the game. For this reason, they are one time use. Add-ons such as insta-heals for survivors or offerings such as ebony mori’s can greatly effect chase lengths and even the games time entirely. If you could use these forever without any drawbacks this would make the games very unenjoyable
---
You know one of those corn maps happens to be one of Billy's best maps right?
---
Check out pain reliever on YouTube.
---
my disapointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
But what about Billy in the corn maps.
---
I could see billy and spirit being switched for sure. But why is pig mid tier? Her crouch ability is pretty useless given how slow she is while crouched. The traps can slow the game down a bit, but not as much/as easy as legion mending. She has no 1 hit kill like Bubba. Little map control, and her entire game is based around RNG with traps
---
Needs a little more photo shop
---
Kitchen's that way sweetie 😂
---
Yea but I mean Ghostface has the ability to one shot survivors and if they make so his mask is just a pure dark red he would be kinda a pain in the ass to spot
---
so cause you feel that its not worth your time, its not you that needs to try and fix that, its the perk thqt is the problem? if you think that the perk is powerful its worth your time, if its not powerful then it doesnt need a nerf
---
pretty much. OhTofu isn’t even a nurse player yet he can still demolish simply because he knows how she works. not necessarily skill. (https://youtu.be/sM5vTsjYqXU)
---
Neither. I've confirmed with Peanits (BHVR community manager) that something like this isn't ban-able because it's due to map design. Same thing for doing the tractor tech on Coldwind maps.
---
I’m not saying I want it 100% red, but just make it seem like it’s actually covered in blood. I just don’t think it’s worth the grind for the mask as is
---
If its a Laurie, she has DS. If they sprint right into a locker, they have DS. If they start crawling towards you on the ground, they have DS. If they don't run to the safe pallet/don't throw it down, they have DS. You can usually tell based on their playstyle. If they've wasted a lot of your time and looped you around a lot, chances are they're going to be smart enough to run an anti-tunnel perk as well
---
Freddy is going to tell you there's Ice cream in his van if you follow him
---
Yep I am playing on the ps4 and would like to have a non-random to join up with.  Getting my mic replaced currently so I cannot talk for the next couple of days.
---
Tell me your psn and I will add you tomorrow to play if your down
---
No. This has been confirmed by the devs many times. It is not an exploit if it's due to map design and thus not ban-able.
---
Hi 'playing on the ps4 and would like to have a non-random to join up with', im DAD.
---
What helped me get over is just doing it with the knowledge that if it's toxic with tea bagging that in the post game chat I can just be wholesome. When I get looped by someone 8 ranks higher than me I compliment them. And in the end if they all escape there is some happiness for me knowing that those people probably had fun in the game
---
If he is right up on you with his chainsaw and you don't have a window or a pallet you are already getting onto, then that's your own fault for pathing poorly. I'm not trying to insult anyone at all, it's just a literal skill that needs to be developed where you can time how long it will take killer to catch up to you and knowing where you need to be when that happens so you can either force him to use m1 to hit you or you can pallet stun.  
---
The only thing you can try to do which WILL NOT WORK against high level billy's is 360ing and hoping he misses. The chainsaw hitbox though is almost 180 degrees to the front of billy so like I said if he is high rank then it will work maybe 1/10 times. The only way to stop it is avoiding the situation in the first place by looping around windows and pallets so he's forced to smack you instead of chainsawing.
---
Dead hard is great when it works, problem there is when
---
Record and ask a better player to review it.
---
You're welcome xD
---
"Murder on the dancefloor"
---
I don't need a mic and I will play whenever.  Sending my ps gamertag in dm
---
I don't play plague, but i hear reabsorbing from fountain used for cleansing will grant 2 hits (aka instant down) on survivor.
---
Yea but still it could cause a issue if it was covered in more blood as he would well be more harder to spot plus it is just meant to be cosmetic and not give an advantage (also the left side of the mask looks untextured because it's lighter then the rest of the mask)
---
Good thing never anything like that ever happens on console : ))).
---
if the killer plays bad, he has noed, if he goes faster in end game, he had noed, if they dont worry about pallets, they have noed, you can usualy tell based on thier playstyle. if they know gen rushing is the meta rn and know how fast gens get done they are going to be smart enough to run anti gen rushing perks
---
Hell Yea
---
Pretty obvious bc destroying gems I a core mechanic
---
its technically better, not by much, but technically
---
Hola DAD lol
---
I say to myself: would I be annoyed if I played against someone doing this? The answer is yes so I don’t do it
---
My point is that Exhaustion is 40 seconds for a reason. This perk makes it 20. You go through that 40 second chase regardless but this new vigil would shave 20 seconds off your exhaustion when normally you would have to go through the full 40.
---
Most exhaustion perks not only let you get out of a situation where you would normally be hit, they also put distance between you and the killer. That downtime normally wouldn't be an issue, now it is. That 80s timer would be 60-70 in most situations. Add in stops for mindgames and the timer is ~50s in chase or 25 stopped.
---
Thats a massive reduction and it'll result in a must pick. Its not pre-nerf DS or MoM broken, but very strong for the average survivor. 
---
For the not so average survivor? This will dominate higher tiers and make most non-mindgame killers useless. Keep those survivors in rank 1 with an 80% survival rate in mind.
---
This perk would still just ignore killers with exhaustion add ons.
---
I agree that current vigil is not good. But this is not the way to fix it and other things need to be fixed first.
---
Lol how often does this happen?
---
The only thing I think needs to be changed his Noed, and Spirit’s godly add one
---
go into a kyf lobby or on july 13th just spend a few hours practicing. All you do is turn your character like you are doing a 360 and then "catch" them in the middle of their spin and balance moving left and right while holding forward.  
---
To describe it more in detail:  
---
Keep your camera facing in a single direction.  
---
Run forward.  
---
Start doing a spin  
---
when your character is facing backwards during the spin, try running forward again.  
---
Depending on the angle of your character, it will try to either turn clockwise or anti-clockwise to face the running direction.  
---
Cancel that automatic turn by hitting left or right appropriately.  
---
All of this happens super fast so knowing the method is only a small fraction of actually being able to do it consistently. It will eventually become muscle memory but practicing is the only way to get that.
---
Good job
---
Just put him in center screen above your character's head.
---
Thank you! This makes so much sense! :) I'm going to go practice now 😁
---
You could try cutting corners and hugging walls and objects, making the chainsaw more likely to register hitting the obstacles.
---
Just Billy every other killer struggles, so how is that balanced? Can you explain please
---
Does Father's Glasses for Spirit (Blood is visible when phasing) give you a built in bloodhound during the phase? 
---
I heard mixed things if it does or doesn't. Some say "Bloodhound is a waste because blood is highlighted by father's glasses alone" others say "Father's Glasses is completely useless unless you dedicate a perk slot for bloodhound" and one post saying it used to highlight the blood, but not anymore.
---
I'd test it but I'm honestly a bit lazy finding someone in KYF and I don't want to waste an ultra rare in a public match.
---
STERYOTYPES HAVE NEVER BEEN SO TRUE
---
\*Wraith
---
I've been playing for just a bit over a month (since last free weekend) and I have all of these unlocked. There is so many perk that I want, what are the odds to get shrine like this for me.
---
In my opinion, the devs should punish whoever quit the game like this.
---
Survivors get fucked or killer gets few bloodpoints...
---
PS:Sorry for the low quality video, had to download it thru an app.
---
This is actually the best "nurse nerf" idea I've seen.
---
It weakens her without completely gutting her.
---
Nurse, Billy, Spirit, but if you're looking for fun maybe some variation is good. I've played both Pig and Myers to rank 1
---
&gt; depip twice
---
This is your answer. Many players like to disconnect in order to derank. Some of them will disconnect upon spawning on the map, which is considered as dick move, so some players casually play the game until their death is guaranteed, then disconnect upon dying for the depip/derank. 
---
Sometimes these players get caught on purpose at the beginning (getting the killer's attention with fast actions, running up to a hook and pointing at it) and try suiciding on the hook as well, but this "method" gives teammates a window to save the deranker before he can suicide, which is why they tend to disconnect.
---
It's a repost, but I still love it. Thank you for making me smile.😀
---
Idk any better players.
---
Even if you put time into nurse you shouldn’t win hundred percent of the time. If it’s a good Nurse you can’t win
---
Youtuber ardetha does commentary. If you link it here on reddit I'm sure you'll get a lot of help as well.
---
The "bugs" that they were banning for allowed survivors to hold the game hostage, not because it used the terrain in a weird way.
---
The one from the Hallowed Blight event, because it makes her look like a werebunny.
---
As killer, you get ranks by hooking survivors multiple times, slowing down gen progression, hitting people and not letting them heal or escape from your grasp, and quickly downing survivors that you've found.  
---
as a survivor you get ranks by unhooking and healing teammates, doing gens, not being hooked, and having long chases with the killer (double points if you escape the chase successfully)
---
Can you link them saying this please? Thats not map design. Its a glitched rock that has no clip, so the killer can run up it and use it to counter loop when theres a pallet. 
---
This is literally the definition of exploit. And trust me, they didn’t make this intended.
---
Stfu!! I'm leaving you in the hook!!
---
Pig is way too sneaky, she deserve to be higher tbh.
---
I don't even have Plague, but run tanataphobia. The best counterplay to plague is not cleansing, and running stuff like iron will. Make sure you puke on everyone, they will all be injured in no time, if you have a curtain add-on you see them for 5 secs whenever they puke, making it to where them cleansing won't change anything cuz  then everyone who doesn't is already dead
---
1 out of a roster of 16 characters? Is that balanced to you? Please reply I want to hear your thoughts on this
---
I just wanna play killer with my pal
---
Depends on what you consider tunneling. 
---
Are you talking about those situations when you can see the guy being unhooked, in which case you have the clear option to go for the unhooker and choose the injured one instead?
---
or 
---
Are you talking about coming back after someone is unhooked and only finding the injured one?
---
To be fair I've never minded it with Trapper either.  Lots of great spots to trap up.  But regardless I don't condone removing maps just because a specific side doesn't like them.  Where do you draw the limit.  Do we take out the Game too since that's a killer sided map with the worst survival rates of any map?
---
yeah but who honestly cares if a lobby gets dodged? survivor queue times are instant, killer's just hurting themselves
---
OP meme is dumb as fuck btw, I don't DC as survivor but whenever I see someone peace out on a black killer offering I can't even blame them
---
You saved me
---
The rng sucks a bit but with the right load out it, it can slow the game. I think she's map dependent. She can mind game though. It would be low in mid tier. There's also a huge oversight people miss with the pig
---
Ok
---
You must be a baby killer. No offense.
---
Camping is just an ez win, all gens will be done before two people are dead. If everyone brings borrowed time its not even an issue unless NOED is being used, generally used by new killers and dickheads
---
Right now they cannot do anything about DCs as the game is essentially P2P. They cannot track and monitor DCs. 
---
When dedicated servers come online, they will be able to punish people who habitually DC.
---

the will help if he's at a distance but if he's on your butt then his insane turn radius even as he starts his charge can literally let him go around two 90 degree turns if they are pretty close.

Very twisty

your happy for others that don’t care about how you feel? alright
---
dumb killer should have stayed by the exit gate. since it was ur only escape, and going to the second one would take to long.

Exact same thing posted at le same time
---
Same goes with a lot of survivors, but they don't have access to the ez mode perks aka noed
---
not a plague main but as someone who hates plague, always make sure to puke on hooked survivors so that whomever unhooks gets infected as well. Getting everyone infected is the utmost priority because they either have to cleanse which gives you your flamethrower or they are all running around making noise, making messes, and instadownable.
---
I love Dweets
---
About the camping and such: There's plenty of perks that promote leaving the hook for example. Make your choice, BBQ and chili, hex: Devour hope and maybe a few others that I'm probably forgetting. But killers dont care. Neither do survivors unfortunately.
---
In what way is that loop mindgameable? Even if Meg went the other way Billy's head could be seen over the rocks.
---
Yes, combined with a dead rabbit addon it makes Myers have a whole 0 meter radius outside of chase in tier 2
---
If you want the adepts, wait for rank reset, and then don't play killer til near the end of rank reset again so that you match with people who are rank 15 at the end of season. Anyone rank 15 at the end of the season will be super easy to get perfect iridescent emblems against.
---
Survivors aren't equally deserving of a win though. The Killer is the power role and supposed to be powerful. All four aren't supposed to get away every time. I'm sure that's not what you meant but the game isn't supposed to be a one-v-one. One Survivor should always be outmatched by a killer. A lot of people just take the time to master the nurse because they're tired of getting bullied by survive with friends groups and since a lot of survivors tend to be toxic... It's fair for a character that takes so much skill to play scummy as well.
---
The Game has been lost :(
---
It's a bit counter intuitive, but sometimes the best way to get them off is to leave them there for a bit. If no gens are done, many killers will aggressively defend a hook. When gens are popping, it pressures them to leave the hook and try to slow down the progress. People say that the killer gets 'momentum' when hooking a survivor, since it draws more survivors in, and wastes a lot of time that could have been spent on gens. The killer is trying to leverage that hook to gain additional momentum. Using it to lure in more survivors, or waste their time. If you didn't rescue it wouldn't be worth it for the killer to stay there. The trick is to make the killer believe you are willing to let the guy die if he tries to camp the hook. Sometime the killer will camp the guy to death, but in that case there wasn't much you could do anyways. Better to punish him by having 3 escape, then have all four die by rushing the hook.  
---
There are methods of rescuing survivors from camping situations, but they require access to tools like Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time, and Adrenaline. In fact, that's the reason that all those perks are meta at rank 1.  
---
Generally, you shouldn't be going for a hook if you are more than halfway across the map from it, assuming everyone is still alive. Odds are someone else is closer, and your time would be better spent doing a gen. Keep in mind, it doesn't matter if you get the guy off the hook if the gens don't get done. He's still just as dead, and everyone else will be too. If you see someone else getting chased away from the hook, you may be the only one who can do it though.

End collapse game

---
Well I'm glad there's one killer that can always Stomp four people using a third-party means of voice chat like Discord to steamroll most killers and ruin the fun for them
---
Sir you have my down vote, what a useless post. While I never run ds, noed will always be a crutch perk. If you're good at your sole purpose in the game, you won't need the second chance noed provides. I've likely used noed maybe 8 or 10 times in my entire 2k+ hours in dbd. At least 6 of those times were when tier 3 was the only way survivors were exposed.
---
Would break the game and make it unplayable
---
Nurse could've gone in thier
---
Monitor, Scratched mirror, boyfriends memo gives wallhacks and is godly on lerys
---
Monitor, Dead rabbit gives a 0 meter terror radius in tier 2
---
Victory Cube was the old way of scoring killers. In short, when you hooked or killed a survivor you would get points - one for hooking a survivor, one for when they went into struggle phase, and two for when they were sacrificed. How much you would rank up would depend on how many of these points you got.
---
In short it meant if you got a 4K on the survivors you would always double pip up, which meant that a lot more people got into red ranks than they do now.
---
I love this fucking community. Loves to just regurgitate stupid shit every thread.
---
it's super rare to get a full stalk when hunting a survivor. Imo what you should be doing is similar to myers where you get very close to fully exposing them so that you have 2-3 of them near exposed and then finally move in to expose them when you know where they are and are close. then you can finish exposing them faster then they can even negate your power.

Billy's been getting some Parkour lessons from the Legion.

Id take those two out anyday

I'll see if I can get it done today :)
---
It was the same for me until i descided to actually learn her and now I still suck with her but not that much (1-2 kills a game).
---
DCing isn't necessarily a problem, but a bug. I have 2 friends who DC once per 10 games it seems.
---
Hound mask and bear skin  :)
---
Ok. Still chases that long should be left.
---
I personally hate him but a lot of people do. He's good for beginners, good for pipping if you care about rank and good for gaining bloodpoints. His issue is he's too add on reliant. You have to run windstorm and swift hunt for him to be decent because without add ons, he is complete dogshit. He also will get completely destroyed against a good team, no matter how good the wraith player is in question
---
I would usually run Adrenaline, Dead hard/Sprint burst, Decisive Strike/Spine Chill, Bond/Borrowed Time
---
i agree on mlst but dc, exploits, lagsqitching can get people banned
---
and they do punish you for camping, instead of rewarding not camping
---
I cant wait for It, Im losing so many survivor matches because of This...
---
If someone gets unhooked and you only find the unhooked survivor go for it. But if you see them both run away and you go for the injured one I think you are a dick.
---
I genuinely try not to do it. If you're getting farmed I'll go after the ass who keeps unhooking you. One time I had hooked a Baby Meg (I was against a SWF Group as the ranks made it obvious. I'm rank 12 and the Survivors were Ranks 2 and 18-20) and I spotted her going into the basement via BBQ and went after her. Once I realized it was the same Baby Meg who I've already hooked twice in a row I left her alone. 
---
ON THE OTHER HAND
---
If you're running Object Of Obsession I'll tunnel you to the ground. I'll make sure you're the first hooked and first dead!
---
I might get a bit tilted but ultimately it's better to focus on something good. If I focus on how frustrating it is I'm just gonna get more mad about it.
---
And what buff would you like to see?
---
Most of those DCs were First hooks, I mean, wtf man! Just play the fucking game...
---
That looks super sick!
---
Borrowed time, maybe Mettle of man if you're willing to take the hits, Smth like Bond/Empathy, Maybe aftercare or we'll make it, a medkit with the anti hemorrhagic syringe, just for that lil' extra spicy saving action
---
you know what else is a second chance perk that gets run a lot, ds, borrowed time, sometimes adreneline, instaheals arnt perks but they are second chances
---
They already supposedly track and punish DC's but the threshold is supposedly pretty high. (Although dedicated servers will help immensely as they can tell who's fault it is much easier)
---
I do hope whatever they do to fix it, at least doesn't simply boot the survivor's character out of the game like it currently does. Just like Siege and CS:GO toxic players will still DC or ragequit and just eat the punishment. On the Killers end I shouldn't be screwed out of a Mori daily or BBQ stack because a survivor determined the punishment was totally worth fucking over my Evil Incarnate achievement.
---
Huh I guess they changed that, I’m 99% sure it did not work on boxes for the longest time. Maybe unnerving, game map and skillcheck addons piggy isn’t a horrible build.
---
If you’re toxic then yes he’s the king of facecamp and basement. If you are going the non toxic route (I’d recommend this one from experience) he honestly is fine all the way up till you’re deep in purple.  He also is excellent against altruistic SWF groups because the second you hook someone, that invisaclaud is already within a chainsaws reach
---
Woah Bro, no need to call him The Entity. That's just mean. :P
---
You need LF to be as bland as he is because it sets the standard of blandness, you'll be able to recognise killers that aren't bland. If they made every killer unique and eccentric suddenly the Nurse is the new standard for blandness.
---
The only killer that have it hard are Michael and Ghostface. The map is good for Hag, Trapper and Billy. But for other killers it is not annoying.
---
Removed - Bandwagon meme

Removed - Common Repost
---
if you blame the perk cause you suck at countering it your shit
---
Gen rushing just means the killer is too shit at the game to properly apply pressure. If the other 3 survivors aren't getting pressured, they're not going to sit there and watch the killer get looped, they're going to "rush gens"!
---
As someone new to playing killer, I appreciate your ted talk. :)
---
Yes.
---
I'll be honest, I did this for my 4 man swf last night because after getting 5 200+ping lobbies in a row, we decided we'd play out the 190 and that's when the black offering came up. I decided that was the sign that I shouldn't be playing anymore and took the hit.
---
Killer was going to be rewarded for having shit internet already, no need to punish ourselves even more with the black offering (that turned out to be an ebony mori)
---
Genrushing does not exist, a dumbass killer does
---
Removed - Offtopic
---
The standard huntress load out is ruin, bbq, nurses calling and whispers. I personally don't know how to use whispers so you can replace it with sloppy, m&amp;a or something else. But ruin bbq and nurses are a must on huntress
---
Oh and don't use iron maiden, it's not worth it. It only saves like 4 seconds. If you really want to reload faster then use the deerskin gloves add on
---
as a killer main, no
---
The only general tips i could give is to put pressure. If you go against a good looper that runs you around for minutes don't be afraid to break chase and scare other survivors off of gens. 
---
If the game is not going good don't be afraid to think about which gens to protect, find 3 gens that are close to each other and let them do the other gens, so that during endgame the survivors have to come to you.
---
Especially with killers that have an instant down (like bubba and GF) 3 gening is deadly
---
The corn maps are not a problem because there are not many loop spots and it is scary if a killer is walking towards you in through the corn. So I think it’s not a problematic map and a lot of killers are not that bad in the corn maps.
---
dude, gens get done WAY too fast, the only waiy to apply pressure is hex:ruin, and i shouldnt have to use a perk to have a game last longer than a few mins, and thats if it doesnt get destroyed in 2 secs, and with toolboxes bieng really easy to make it go extremly fast is bs, gen rishing is a problem in the game rn

He lacks potential against skilled survivors, a Billy, nurse or even spirit have great potential. But don't ever underestimate a Myers, Comes out of nowhere with T3 on standby

Wasn't Bond in like... Three weeks ago? If they're gonna put free survivor perks in there they should at least rotate them lmao.
---
Welcome to Dead by Daylight, where 10% of all survivors and 5% of all killers have managed to reach rank 10.
---
I suggest you get/play Michael, he's really easy and powerful, also universal depending on his addons... I wouldn't say I'm a pro but at mid ranks  I never need perks that aren't about bloodpoints, maybe deerstalker because I'm bad at finding them slugs
---
I love subreddit drama. 😎👉👉
---
Also hard to play as, complicated for new players.  Very different playstyles after what add ons you bring
---
imo agitation and iron grasp are mostly usefull in basement builds. Otherwise you're most likely to be close enough to a hook anyway.
---
I completely agree with adding a perk that would help you with finding survivors. If you don't like (or have) barbecue, you can consider whispers (underrated perk in my opinion).
---
It hit or miss, sometimes i reveal him half way across the map, and sometimes i have to run at him just so i dont get marked
---
The strongest survivor perks are stronger than the strongest killer perks, lmao
---
I've provided you with a highly intellectual paragraph and you respond with "this aint it", go neck yourself cunt

Have had the same issue, on PS4 as well. Happened once or twice as killer, and once as survivor. Think it is just a minor glitch/bug.
---
Yes please one less ghostface I have to deal with.

Please don’t hate or downvote me. Can someone please tell me what “mindgameable” means? I’ve also heard of mindgameable pallets.
---
No, it's about stonks
---
Yes, it's a strategy. Quite effective (if you care about 4k more than anything else), not fun for survivors. I try not to do it, but sometimes it happens (last time I forgot there were 2 Megs and Min in my lobby, and genuinely thought I was chasing third Meg...)
---
OP you are aware DS is only active for about a minute after being unhooked, right?
---
So it only comes into play if you down and pick up a survivor within the same minute they are unhooked.
---
I have no qualms with NOED, do the totems an it's not a bother.
---
Hell, survivors get points towards pipping for doing the totems now, win win.
---
This perk idea
---
I'm partially joking
---
no springtrap fnaf hella homo i could see potential in the xenomorph but at the same time the hag is the xenomorph

how wold chucky hook people let alone carry them
---
Why the fuck is depipping set at fucking zero. I had a match against some rank 20s and ranked up. Now I’m getting barely 1000 points a match and I can’t lower it. Why is it like this?
---
Yep it was, when there was DS too. Kinda annoyin but I guess I'll take the 150k bloodpoints
---
I don't understand the downvotes for this one. You people are strange.
---
Or even better, run bbq and whispers at the same time. Trust me, survivors love it
---
You tunnel the camp. Hook.

---
Straight from evolve LMAO. Isn't that a pic of wraith
---
It use to be to all stuns not just pallets. I could have someone ds me and i would recover in half the time to hit them again. You twat
---
If you really struggle finding all totems consider leaving one unbroken, just until you know you have found all 5. If you can't find the 5th at least you have a 50/50 at end game. Could even be the case that someone else found and broke the one you didn't find.
---
Other than that survivors really have to consider the killer may have NOED and play with that in mind. Instead of playing recklessly, rushing through everything. Consider a bit of stealth. You want to pop that last gen in the killers terror radius? Don't cry when you get downed a few seconds later with NOED. Instead of rushing to open a gate then getting downed with NOED, maybe wait until the killer has been and gone?
---
I really don't have a problem with NOED. I find it fun to play against sometimes. Adds a challenge. 
---
My big issues are TUNNELLING, Camping without a 'No Terror Radius' ability or perk (I can excuse 'hidden' camping if the intention is to surprise attack and chase another survivor, NOT tunnel the hook), and finally Mori's, and the sad cunts who can't wait to abuse them.  Especially the Ebony Mori. Seriously. Why the hell would survivors want to play a 'one life game'? 
---
I personally, as a general rule, NEVER Mori anyone until they've been hooked twice already and that is how I personally think they should work, except for the 'Kill the last survivor' Mori of course. Seriously these desperate sad fucks, so excited to rush and use their Mori, not for the animation but because they are so desperate for their unfair advantage, desperate for their 4 kills, as if it's the only way they can manage it. Sort this ridiculous shit out BHVR! Some of the killer addons are bad enough but these Mori conditions are fucking stupid. There should at least be a condition added like with Devour Hope, killer can't Mori any hooked survivor until they have hooked x number of survivors. 
---
Side rant over.
---
Bad bot
---
I was gonna offer you advice on Legion but that "protect hooks" bit sounds a lot like camping me.  If this is the case in good conscience I cannot help you.
---
If you call 0.5 seconds decreased from pallet stuns but all other stuns now have a whole 5 second stun timer a buff then I dunno what to tell you.
---
What are all the other stuns?Ds?Dont tunnel.Head on?You can still get a hit even if you get stunned.
---
This happens to me a lot. Exactly why I run adrenaline.
---
Since survivors aren't healing( common with legion and plague) you can run 2 mending addons and constantly get them to mend themselves to slow the game down. Doing so will get u chasing,  devious and hunting points while ether kicking gens and downing/hooking the last person hit with feral frenzy.
---
idk man i think killer is kind of brain dead easy lately. maybe its just me.
---
He also has one of the best looking (imo) prestige outfits in the game.
---
Hey quick question, does struggling on a hook even get you off? So far I just die faster and I give up on it
---
Slugging one of the last two survivors so you can hunt round the map for 5 minutes is a really sad, desperate, and cuntish way to play. Go and punch yourself in the face.
---
if i see scatch marks around the hook after i hook someone, iam not going to the other side of the map, i was gonna search around it. and i was gonna stay in normal mode(no FF)
---
i heard that duration and cooldown add-ons are the best but i'll try the double mending stuff. ty
---
I mean... it is. It's just not a very good one like, 70% of the time.
---
Probably off topic but I hate when people bait me to Chase knowing the gate is open so they get them extra chase points so then I just go sit in a corner facing a wall so no one gets anything &gt;:(
---
i don't proxy camp, i go to the place i assume there are survivors after hooking someone but if i hear the heavy breathing when a survivor sprints or i see scartch marks, i won't leave immediately.
---
I get this but as soon as I've hit a survivor or I'm playing clown or plague it stops

Yep same issue tonight.  Ps4 played a couple rounds with the no texture pallets

I run wraith cause I can't be arsed searching around for immersed survivors

The perfect seat
---
Weird, I’m also in South Carolina and haven’t had much of an issue other than a huge lag spike in the middle of the day against a nice leatherface that dropped me on the hatch because he felt bad for me.
---
Basically, you just wait for them to attempt to vault the pallet, in this case with the billy I would probably chainsaw the pallet since that specific one has 2 long sides instead of normal ones that have a short and a long side to them. But with the wraith, I would try to get them to vault the pallet and head back basically making them spam the vault button until I am at a good position to hit. Hard to explain the mind games but you don't need to lose line of sight to mind game.
---
Not just megs...only mostly the megs
---
Stupid question but are the perks in the Shrine of Secrets the same between PS, Computer and Xbox?
---
&gt; And in high tier you see alot more stealth builds
---
You have not played this game enough.
---
Stealth stops being in play at around Rank 9, and doesn't exist at all in Rank 1. People know where to look, people listen to grass, people have map sense, people run BBQ/ Whispers.
---
I kinda like it, could be the final chapter as the entity itself or a previous survivor
---
Terrifying skills.
---
He’s not fun to play and not fun to play against. Literally the only tactic to make him unique  and somewhat viable is probably the most toxic basement insidious build.
---
All I can say is that I wrote all the killer concept before I search a monster picture from the internet since all people in DBD official forum also use [random pictures](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/72782/new-killer-idea-the-statue#latest) they found in the internet along with killer concept so I thought I'd do it too. 
---
Guess I won't know if my idea if good or not since people get false impression from the picture from Evolve I add to my killer concept later already. 
---
and My idea is straight copy from evolve? Yeah I never see any character who can set a trap on a ground or blink for a short range before.
---
Reddit, killersided as always
---
Then killer hits him with NOED 👌
---
Yeah, can confirm, I'm looking at my pc right now with the kid on ps4 10 feet away learning what the perks are
---
And bamboozle?
---
I love this that's so me as survivor WAzZAAAAAAAppp
---
I think what they mean specifically is you can't fuck with that particular pallet structure because of collision. If Billy were to turn around, he would just waste more time.
---
If it has a fandom, any and all of the characters are getting shipped. One way or another and in one medium or another.
---
It's like a pseudo rule 34
---
You are referring to the pallet being unsafe (which even then it arguably isn't), not the loop being mindgameable.
---
wait he actually comes out? O.o
---
Nurse would still be SUPER fucking busted and graciously deserving of SSS+ tier with these, but here are some Nurse nerfs that would take her from **"Realm of total bullshit"** to "Realm of ughh... This is unfun to go against":
---
* Every subsequent blink lowers her lunge range. Out of a blink, 5% less than normal. 2nd blink, 30% less distance. 3rd blink, fuck you, you get Myers T1 lunge.
---
* Totally rework broken add-ons. Omega blink doesn't need to exist. Nurse is already insanely good, her add-ons should probably just play the role of "risk/ reward" by having *semi* nerfs to her ability in exchange for higher BP earning rates. (Not like Nurse struggles with getting BP to begin with, but you get what I mean.) So you slap on an add-on in case you want to challenge yourself, rather than make an already totally broken killer even stronger.
---
* Allow stunning her with pallets mid-blink again. They removed this for *some* reason.
---
* Just a tiny bit more delay for the damaging swing out of blink. She shouldn't be able to down someone a microsecond after her blink ends. On network replication she downs you before you even see her appear on your screen. I'm not saying "don't let her lunge", but simply don't allow her lunge to finish within like 0.1-0.2 seconds right out of a blink.
---
Any high level nurse won't be hampered by this whatsoever. These changes don't greatly affect newbies, outside of the lunge distance change. This gives slightly more leeway for survivors to tolerate games against her, but it still doesn't fix fundamentally how broken she is. But if she's here to stay, nerfs like these would be appreciated.
---
sloppy butcher, nurses calling, monitor and abuse &amp; bbq chilli is what i play
---
and keep constant pressure
---
Kid, Nurse is totally broken. This is not a matter of opinion.
---
Nurses calling and thanatophobia are good as they will usually always be injured. 
---
Bbq is usually a good plan on most killers for the utility and blood points. 
---
Monitor and abuse is also good as it allows you to get close before you sprint giving you the edge.
---
for 360s i can’t do them but my friend has had good results with spinning both sticks 360 to the left or right depending on which way you wanna 360
---
Despite not having Original Characters for Ghostface. He’s all about having a sense of Humor. 
---
Michael Myers Sense of Humor is through art. I mean in the first Movie he killed the boyfriend put a sheet over his head and wore Glasses. 
---
Just because Myers doesn’t talk doesn’t mean he isn’t crafty and sometimes funny. Of course in a dark humor sense of way.
---
Yeah. And i understand that if you only play killer for awhile or take a break from the game so that you are also a low rank, but usually this is not the case. They are just there to make new players feel crushed and make them feel better of themselves.
---
i was tryna make a joke about them laughing in game :(
---
Hahahaha christ. Is this for real?
---
Maybe you SHOULD go play civilisation, dude.
---
Damn Popeyes
---
I play botany WMI and it seems faster, It may be a Pavlov effect tho
---
Total glitch. I've seen it happen before. Makes the camera on the survivor's end stuck inside the locker, but they can't be yanked out. They have to sit there until the game ends if they don't DC.
---
There’s nothing funnier than seeing Dwight’s Aura from miles away walking and checking his side in fear and then all of a sudden starts running after getting a surprised hit
---
&gt; There should be also secondary objective much more rewarding in terms of BP gain on the survivor side which also affects the generators.(Remember the Halloween event?) 
---
Yes, I remember. As soon as all the flowers were sucked out, games were basically over - most survivors ran straight to the killer to be hooked, so they could fail to kobe and then die without a struggle to search for the next game.
---
&gt; The game is no longer in its infancy phase yet the gameplay has remained unchanged. Killers chase survivors to put them on hooks, survivors on the other hand do gens, save others and try to juke, lose the killer. On paper the formula is good but fact is the game is getting old and it is getting old fast.
---
Can you point to some online games (preferably from not a major studio) that went for a drastic change of gameplay that wasn't an attempt to revive a dying title? DbD is still going quite strong on PC (I know nothing about console playerbase), and there's no guarantee that major changes won't hurt the game.
---
&gt; Also it is bad game design when a killer player base decides there are only two viable killers in the game (Nurse, Hillbilly)
---
And then you watch some good killer mains on Twitch and see that they do pretty well at red ranks playing Pig/Trapper/Huntress without "anti-genrush" builds.
---
&gt; The main reason people DC on both sides is frustration and it stems from all the issues listed in my thread. 
---
So when survivors DCs after first down, what's the issue that led to their frustration? And I'm not talking about 5 blink Nurse or insta-hatchets. I'm talking about usual two m1 hits.
---
When an "insta-saw Sloppy NOED" Billy DCs after his Ruin was cleansed, what's the issue?
---
&gt; amount of grinding to get all the perks just for one character alone is insane. Build diversity is based mainly on perks - how can one have fun if everything is locked behind huge wall of grind?
---
Why would you want every perk on a character, though? How often average players change their builds? How diverse are those builds?
---
I agree with dropping perk tiers, though.
---
&gt; Developers should give killers something more for leaving the hook 
---
BBQ, DH, MYC - just the perks that promote leaving the hook. There is a penalty for staying near the hooked survivor. DS, BT - perks that discourage tunneling. They try to give killers incentive to not camp and tunnel. It's on players if they decide to use those tactics.
---
&gt; The game has to be more scary 
---
Impossible. You won't be scared of the same thing after hundreds of hours. Imagine watching your favorite horror movie couple of times each day. How scary will it be after a month?
---
For window vaults if youre definitely doing fast vaults, not slow/medium vaults, and still getting hit it could be a connection issue or your timing, try doing window jukes if you feel it would be useful to you.
---
Soon as you said if all 4 survivors live you should double pip i immediately just knew this was dumb.
---
Is that a pro Genji!?
---
I like the shirt. The wig is pretty bad though.
---
They glitched inside it. They were stuck. they had to either DC or wait for the EGC timer to kill them
---
i hope you'll stay safe there baby Dwight 😔
---
Oh... my... god... Im only gonna asnwer this this time cuz it just seem you are bad and dotn know how to improve, forgive my bluntness.
---
&gt;Is she faking her power?
---
Would you guess that? ***Another*** mindgames that literally goes both ways, if she is and you guess right, gz you gained distance on her, if she is not and you guess right, just run to a pallet and drop it, since this is ***another*** mindgame.  
---
&gt;Is he power up/How much time does she have on her phase
---
This is what is calling knowing your match-up, in fighting games this is really common and a **good** player will nave be caught offguard playing against a character he doesnt know, well, because he is **good** and **understands** the game
---
&gt;Can she hear you/see moving grass?
---
This just tops the cake for me, you also **hear her footsteps when shes phasing AND see her moving grass**  
---
&gt;When you drop a pallet against a phasing spirit, you need to hope she’s  literally running through it at that moment or your fucked.
---
Huh???? No???? The only way to use pallets now are to stun killers??? You use pallets to get distance on them and prolong the chase as much as possible.
---
&gt;It’s too much to hope for. Chances are your getting hit.
---
Yeah, literally git gut

And then you're working on a generator and a random Michael comes falling from the sky.
---
Can you hide their names plz
---
Just use collapse
---
I played like 90% of my hours in DBD as the Pig. I really like how fun and unpopular she was, but now shes not just unpopular, shes almost unplayable and belong somewhere in "Freddy's tier" killers. Make the Pig great again.
---
I think the shirt is unnecessary
---
Tunneling is when the killer focuses one survivor. After unhooks, after hitting someone.
---
Don’t worry about it, people are so salty sometimes
---
&gt; being a killer is just way too easy
---
At what ranks and on which killer? I mean, for a hard mode you could play perkless Freddy without add-ons...
---
Why da fuc legion is on top?
---
Going for someone that's just been unhooked, specifically going after the injured person above all others. Most of the time I'm not bothered about it, until someone unhooks me right in the killers face and they put me back down the second my feet touch the floor. Unsafe unhookers should be punished, not the person that can't do anything about the situation.
---
I kinda like the survivor suggestion and though it may not be feasible as the entire basis of pipping, it could be a nice bonus at the end. 
---
The killer one is trickier. Lore-wise, the Entity feeds off the survivors’ hope so the killer dragging out the game (ie not tunneling or camping) makes sense.
---
&gt; Tunneling - The action of a killer to focus on a single survivor until they're dead. It usually involves camping the target on the hook and immediately chasing them again after they've been unhooked.
---
That's how it explained in glossary (https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/glossary)
---
Oh okay. Well it only makes sense to get the guy who just got unhooked because 3 hooks and that's it for them. I can undertsand where the salt comes from tho, especially if your teammate unhooks you and the killer is literally right there. Happens to me all the times when I play survivor lol
---
Hmmm the words "Don't tunnel" are kinda ignorant given not all circumstances allow you NOT to tunnel, head on, dropping the Survivors due to body blocking, flashlight saves. DS was increased in stun duration to make up for enduring hard countering it, now they nerfed enduring but kept the stun timer the same.
---
Spirit and billy have higher skill caps but aren’t as good as her. The only “skill” you need is to play enough to know how to blink and know the map.Sure she is bad if you don’t know how to blink but that really is the only thing you need to know to be good.
---
If you are on PC just close the app whenever you see a secret offering.
---
Dodging Moris made my life much more enjoyable in DBD.
---
What? None of that made sense to me.
---
cause they laugh after frenzy, right?
---
ive seen it like a year ago its my ps4 profile background
---
Maybe if you're playing at green ranks sure but I don't mean to judge but a name like "Bloody Quentin" kinda shows what side you play most of.
---
I’m not really playing the game,but I’m watching let’s plays and I want to understand what’s happening.What’s depipping?
---
They should add activation button
---
Why is this downvoted? Is this not correct? I know how spinechill works, I just wasnt sure if it let you know in anyway from which direction they are looking at you from.
---
&gt; i always think "wtf kind of example are you setting for your audience??"
---
Ochido was quite successful DbD streamer, just saying.
---
Billy is the best balanced killer, a small buff to wraith will not bring him to that level.
---
We need to combine them, the mask from the other guy and the door kick and sounds from this one
---
Terrible combo as its basically normal dying light but it pings the heal speed around, and if you kill obsession but it switches to someone new then the dying light just deactivates until new obsession dies
---
DC'ing is fine. I'd rather get teammates who DC from 50% of their games than teammates who run selfcare + urban evasion
---
Make a tier called "would eat ice-cream and you"
---
Instead of changing noed add a totem counter.
---
true
---
Lmao everyone trying to defend shit chill
---
It's a laugh?
---
# SASUGA DWIGHT-SAMA!
---
Imagine being a functional illiterate and coming to the conclusion that I'm complaining about enduring+spirit fury. I used it as an example, I have no problem with it but don't say that there arent situations where it gives an easy down to the killer, and that the perk combination doesn't make pallets go much faster in the game.
---
r/trapshrine
---
Entity is getting lazy
---
And {Futabu!}
---
It also tells you on the side of this subreddit under Shrine of Secrets lol
---
that shit gave me anxiety
---
The way DS is now, you can go chase the unhooker, hook them then go and down the unhooked survivor from earlier and get DSd.  I actually get DSd more in situations where I’m not tunneling than anything else.  From my experience.
---
No Mither is an outplay to exposed status, they're just playing smart.
---
How do I gen grab/hook-save grab survivors? Do I have to press space or stand close to them and just press M1 or...?
---
So you slug his whole team with DS KO?
---
It’s just you, trust me
---
I don’t think it’s laugh
---
Bye.
---
Currently trying out mining.... Fuck
---
Begone thot.
---
Wow you're an inspiration to all of us, great solution to this problem man! Let me know when you're done at kindergarten so we could play together
---
It only works on bad killers.
---
The most SWF can do is capitalize using pressure relieving perks like DS, Deliverance, Unbreakable, BT or sabotaging hooks.
---
On top of that they have the benefit of planning out which gens to do, but at high ranks solo queue survivors understand how to not 3 gen themselves anyway.
---
They still have to beat you in chases, and communication doesn't help with that. Voice comms just allow them to play like a solo queue survivor more optimally. Like tbh, Spirit Fury callouts are the only BIG deal, but you're not greatly affected by it.
---
Lore wise it does, but the game doesn't play like that. Even if the game depipped you for tunnelling, why is it fair? The game should have mechanics to drag it out and make camping/tunneling not viable, killers literally have kill in the name, they are not "slowers". Some mechanics even directly contradict it too like ebony Mori makes 0 sense.
---
https://youtu.be/hu7rfh9PRRM
---
Git gud
---
It's too bad Spine Chill doesn't work against tier 1 Myers.
---
More of a edgy grunt
---
Thank you for the decent advice my dude did not know that about the windows, is it same for pallets?
---
How bad do you have to be at life to mess up pulling a lever straight down. Just imagine, you fail the skill check and your hand just slips straight off the lever and you trip over your own feet
---
Thank you
---
Sounds like you suck as killer. And survivor.
---
with pallets it's a bit more strange, but there's a predictable moment when you will get hit even if you drop a pallet. You have to get used to that.
---
When you do, you'll know when to not drop a pallet and simply take a hit to not waste it
---
Poised, distortion, dark sense, urban evasion is a super fun gen and dash build
---
Kinda a dick move IMO, you’re forcing everyone to re-queue because the killer *might* be running an ebony Mori 
---
It’s less of a concern for the survivors, but killer queues are slow as hell
---
\*EW3 noises\*
---
But DBD esport pros do it!
---
This cosplay is amazing! I've never done this kinda thing before but I'd like to get into it. Maybe even go to a comic con or something. But yeah great work! You look awesome and I like what the editor has done with the lighting and background. You two are very good!
---
Yeah and he was encouraging ppl to play like dipshits. He was also not a good player. He just bullied newbies.
---
Call me a dick all you want but playing against killers Mori'ing you off hook is more annoying and time consuming than having to re-queue immediately.
---
Sucks that the killer could be using Cypress or Shroud but perhaps is time BHVR remove secret offerings.
---
Where’s BHVR when they need you?! You’re incredible OP!
---
Mercy
---
Gotta call in my fellow r/hydrohomies because these replies are THIRSTY
---
It may be lag, While Playing Killer i do realize it takes noticeably longer to catch up to some players, Meanwhile while i play survivor the killers can essentially chase me down before i can finish any kind of animation. Other times I noticed that i chase down Survivors extremely quickly while as a survivor I’m about to essentially loop him to an extent. I’d recommend checking your connection. Additionally there isn’t much you can do against a person who tunnels, I’d recommend playing around it by finding the killer and going to generators he/she’s leaving to have extra alone time, Wait for the killer to loop back on a damaged gen to Reinsure him/her that no one is over here. Rescuing teammates is a bit risky but most killers will look for the unhooked survivor over you, It’s a great time to figure out where he’s going
---
Mette of man should be completely changed and give another bonus, as extra hit is broken
---
i think its a laugh
---
Except you can't get into the house, because your blink shorts out, and you can't get out of the house, because your blink shorts out, and you're not chasing a survivor in the first place, because you can't blink around anything that's not down the long street
---
A lot of the popular DBD streamers are assholes and a lot of the people in their chats are also assholes, so it really doesn't make much of an impact on how they are viewed based on their style of play since those people would do the exact same thing.
---
There is counterplay to nurse when you have LOS blockers and some buildings.  But, against omega blink there really isn’t anything.
---
The mechanics are present though. DS and BT exist prominently. If you tunnel the unhooked person, you’re going to lose a lot of time and pressure.
---
If you’re looking to pip, you get a sacrifice huge bonus for hooking everyone once even if you don’t kill anyone, which further de-incentivizes tunneling. That’s not even counting BBQC stacks for BP. You also lose chaser points for being close to the hook so there goes camping. 
---
Now if you feel insecure with your abilities as a killer, or you want to say fuck this survivor in particular, and you don’t care about the points, pipping, allowing the survivors to have more fun, or becoming a better killer in chases, then go for it lol.
---
It's smart, really. Avoid putting BBQ into the shrine to get people to buy the DLC for the perk, shameful business but it is what it is.
---
&gt;cause 3 isn't actually possible
---
Take the first hit while the killer is carrying someone. 
---
Take the second hit while unhooking someone in front of the killer with BT (you both go free).
---
Take the third hit while the killer is carrying someone again.
---
Congratulations, your MoM is active.
---
Not impossible, just counter productive.
---
Big cute
---
I’m completely aware it’s intentional. They abuse licensed killer perks like hell.
---
Is that the ballpen key
---
Dont forgot bond as well lol
---
No kidding. I guess if people aren't gonna buy LF for him anymore, they'll at least make sales from the perks. TBH tho - most people that buy that DLC are buying it literally for the perks at this point.
---
Next killers are gonna be tposing when running
---
The protection hits should be fixed first, so that they reliable count towards stacks (same for wglf).
---
Once that works we can look at the balancing, before that it's kinda pointless IMO
---
Old comment but shouldnt it still be reversed? Longer it takes should be higher since red is the highest and shorter since blue is the lowest?
---
Girl, you're thicker than a bowl of oatmeal.
---
Ghostface is that friend who sighs and facepalms when you make a pun.
---
And then slowly wants to kill you.
---
Just not making him slow down much like billy when reving up the saw would be very good.
---
Do I really need to edit my initial comment and add /s there?
---
No fucking way you unironically believe this
---
For anyone reading, here is close to what DBD ACTUALLY needs in rough order of priority:
---
* Fix Ghostface's detection mechanics. They are **totally** buggy/ broken right now, and playing against him is either a cakewalk or migraine inducing based on your rng of the code registering shit.
---
* Haddonfield made less fucking horrible to play on as killer
---
* Freddy rework
---
* Spirit small rework: turn her collisions off when she's phasing, rework balance prayer beads, nerf indication of *direction* on injured survivors while phasing so that she can at the very least be mindgamed whatsoever.
---
* Grim Pantry, Shelter Woods, Torment Creek, Preschool (or arguably basement of pain that exists here and haddonfield), Cowshed, Disturbed Ward need looking at on their tile layouts or problematic buildings, in that order
---
* Nurse nerf- this is only so low because community has intuitively just understood how bullshit she is and don't play matches as/ against her, and actually trying to balance her might be more problematic than anything because people might feel like there's justification to start running her again and forcing people to endure her.
---
* Billy add-on rework; he has insanely easy access and insanely overpowered add-ons. Spark plugs has no right being as effective as they are for instance, not to mention instasaw being bullshit.
---
* Rework additional unfun add-ons/ fix broken ones (Legion's buggy add-ons, Iri head, Trapper high tier add-ons)- not direct "NERF/ REMOVE" but stuff to make them a little more "game changing" similar to Myers' perks. For instance, Iri stone instead of making EVERY trap automatically re-open, it could give Trapper something like 2 bright red indentifiable "Traps that re-open". Maybe introduce another high tier perk that gives him only one of these, and then make the trapper bag basekit for fuck's sake.
---
* ACTUALLY make pallets/ safe tiles and tile layout more consistent. I still see double pallets all the time, and I've recently witnessed double pallets on a long wall jungle gym SOMEHOW.
---
* Make RNG related killer abilities less fucking stupid. Trapper/ Pig specifically and the odds related to taking off the trap. If a Pig downs and puts a trap on their first survivor's head 3 gens into the match, have some weighting that doesn't allow the survivor to take it off at their FIRST box when they still have 80% of the timer left on it. There should be some intuition there on the game's part that it isn't fair, or at least make add-ons that, say change the odds of things happening (Your FIRST trap will never get off first try, your traps have a 10% chance of being taken off in the first 25% of the timer, etc)
---
* Not high priority but goes with previous point; make luck feel more intuitive in more places. Let it influence items found in chests. Make self escape from hook have some more hidden "intuitive weighting" to how a match plays out. There are conditions which should allow kobe's to be more likely- for instance 2 survivors DC early on and a few gens have been done.
---
Outside of that, "weak killers" don't really need direct buffs, cause all their shortcomings mainly come from unfair maps just being bullshit. Every killer in the right hands can be extremely oppressive, it just takes mastery.
---
I'm not sure how to interpret this
---
Wait I just realized the pic is real, legit thought it was game art lol
---
&gt; killer could be using Cypress or Shroud 
---
Or splinter...
---
&gt; perhaps is time BHVR remove secret offerings.
---
Make all offerings secret (including BPS and event specific). Or simply do not show any.
---
that's your blink control then. I could get into the house with old nurse a few years ago (you couldn't control up, down or how far you blink). practice some more
---
-1
---
Still my favourite game.
---
A what?
---
It depends on what killer you’re playing and what rank you’re at. You have to tunnel on low/mid tier killers at high ranks because they’re so bad. Show me a video of Wraith/Freddy/Trapper at rank 1 getting a 4K without tunneling, relying on luck/OP add-ons, or relying on stupid plays from the survivors. Good luck finding that. When I get tunneled as survivor I don’t get pissed because I understand why they do it. A lot of people don’t play at rank 1 as survivor and killer which makes their opinions biased.
---
Yes whoosh but there is an active community that defends that perk
---
After inspection, it was a perk. Also, my game noticed something's wrong. I went to my loadout to check how many perks I haven't maxed out yet. when I came back, my bloodweb reset
---
*Wipes tear out*
---
I even reported the theft but it's still up :)
---
Makes sense, considering his name is Mountainous William.
---
Id love to eat a nice cup of ice cream with Evan
---
new bloodweb also has Diversion 3, the black circle was probably detective's hunch 2
---
docs pallet stun laugh makes it just a tad better when getting looped :)
---
The week bbq came in the shrine is the week I switched from being a survivor main to a killer main. Not because of BBQ, but because *every damn killer started running it and still do and its bullshit at rank 15.* 
---
I hope it never comes back.
---
They can decisive me all they want, or I just wait out the 60 seconds getting free hits on anybody who dares to rescue. Depends on Killer and Situation.
---
Sounds are bugged right now. Some people can't hear chase music (on both sides), Huntress humming is non-directional for survivors, etc. We're waiting for the patch that will fix those bugs (and bring new ones)
---
Yes whoosh but there is an active community that defends that perk and I am still fairly new to the game
---
Wraith buff? Do you think Wraith needs a buff?
---
I find him fucking annoying. All he does is wander around invisible (because invisible Killers are fun to play against), then he sees you, comes close and un-cloaks. If you manage to jump out window or something, he re-cloaks again to gain the speed buff and the cycle starts over. 
---
Camping is also strong with this one.
---
Is there a chat history, for example if I'm the last survivor.. am I able to see the chat of the survivors who left/died before me?
---
Survivors running to me and breaking me out, denying my stalking is unfun, boring and frustrating. 
---
Change my mind.
---
Yup. Solo queue NOED is just flat out dogshit.
---
This is how a NOED match looks as survivor in solo queue:
---
Sit around doing gens for 4 minutes uninterupted cause the killer doesn't know how to apply map pressure. And it's obvious they can't apply map pressure, because they're running fucking NOED. No one runs it if they can end the game before 5 gens pop.
---
Gens finished, killer hooks survivor next to totem, forcing you to leave. 6k points, boring as fuck match. If you stay around to play the match and find the totem, you risk just having an uninteresting chase against a 120% killer with one hit in an area likely to have no pallets. If you risk the save you can throw the match and reward the killer for being bad. If you were the one leading the killer on a 5 gen chase and ended up on that last hook, your teammates just leave cause fuck dealing with NOED, "I did all the work by doing gens, not my problem"
---
NOED isn't strong. It isn't effective at anything besides sprinkling in a few unearned kills. It's boring and makes the matches more frustrating for everyone involved. If kills after 5 gens didn't count, NOED would be in a better place cause at least they aren't getting boosted rank. If you have only 1 hook before 5 gens pop, even if you 4k, if a door has been opened you should black pip at that point.
---
There’s plenty, like having a huge terror radius or ensuring survivors have the hardest time possible doing gens.
---
As a quentin main that is totally a lie,
---
WWWAAAAAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!
---
That’s what you get Jeremy
---
Eh, Fair enough, but it’s also annoying spending another fifteen minutes looking for a game because I brought a cypress to do a daily 
---
Im not sure how I feel about removing secret offerings, Hurts killers more since their secret offerings are significantly more powerful. Most days it probably wouldn’t matter, though I’d miss them sorely for dealing with 4 man groups
---
You can't be serious...
---
You have 2 cuts coins? I can't find one!
---
Yeah it means BHVR hates you and you have to restart DbD. Again.
---
Damn, he really lives up to his name.
---
I completely agree with that too. That’s why I said sometimes, I also own him and the first few days was very fun, but once I made it deep into red ranks it became very unfun running into swf who break you out and basically have you m1 the whole game. 
---
My main issue again is just you being right in his face and he’s still stalking you and then downs you or either m1’s you to break him out. I’ve been on both sides of this situation and I know when I down a survivor they feel cucked. That’s my only complaint with him that needs to be fixed and maybe like the other person said not being able to be broken out by hooked survivors....
---
Similarly: "Am I really that good at killer? No it is all the survivors that are bad."
---
The lodge with BL is also pretty...I wouldn’t say broken...but if 1 or 2 survivors have it and know what they’re doing, the match is unwinabble as killer.
---
BOOB3 DID IT. FARMER JOHN WHEN?
---
It happened to me once too, the game was bugged in some way and i couldnt exit the survivor menu for some reason then it resets and this golden title pops up. I had no clue what was going on, but i am sure this is the result of the very infamous spaghetti code.
---
Report for unsportsmanlike and report for AFK. He will definitely get banned plus with proof.
---
And DWM since it didn’t leave any scratch marks. He thought I ran back to open the gates. LITTLE DID HE KNOW. Lol
---
Its a glitch that can occur when you try to join a SWF lobby while being in another lobby
---
Hag: Will not eat ice cream with you...*will eat you!!*
---
Oh shit- 
---
*Billy pallet stun noises*
---
Happens often at lower ranks, new players don't know the unwritten rules of the game and also don't understand why camping isn't a good strategy
---
Nope, but it is definitely cool.
---
I usually get it by joining a friends lobby before fully loading into the games starting menu.
---
I can link you to many videos where Nurse/Spirit completely own rank 1 SWF survivors that don’t make many mistakes. Then again that’s because they’re pretty OP. All I’m saying is a killer that relies on a survivor to fuck up isn’t a good killer and that’s why they tunnel. I’ve seen Noob, Tru3, Monto, etc all tunnel at rank 1-8. Why doesn’t everyone hate them? Because when they watch their videos they understand why they’re doing it. To say tunneling/camping (although we’re not taking about camping, I still wanted to include it since it’s related to what I’m comparing it to) is 100% bad is just like telling survivors it’s bad to gen rush or to loop.
---
Happy cake day! 🎂🍴
---
I mean, good point but it's a double standard what if that 3rd survivor or all 4 were being held hostage? Then what? This needs to be taken into account
---
Haha I played with you earlier!
---
Shadowborn+monitor and stretch res
---
What exactly is going on? A glitch?
---
Problem is that the effect is so strong, when combined with the right perks, that buffing it just 1% too far makes it brokenly OP.
---
Followed by a match in which a sweaty swf-group repairs all gens in 3 minutes
---
It is the void.
---
I dont quite understand the downvotes but kk. Guess its not allowed fooling around with the survivors. But they were so proud for discovering that bug, i just couldnt kill these cuties
---
At the same time, I'll (as Ghostface) dive behind of a wall and still get broken out.
---
Breast cosplay ever.
---
I'm sorry.  That was really impulsive and insensitive of me.
---
I'm getting more of a Hollywood starlet vibe than a country girl running for her life vibe.  Idk, maybe it's the hair/ makeup combo.  Clothes are definitely on point, so props for that, but idk, maybe dye your hair brown and I have no idea about makeup, but other than that, great job.
---
7/10 from me.
---
So basically all of them.
---
Usually it's not too big of a deal to eat DS. If the guy is on the ground and I think they have DS still proc'd, just wait till their healthbar is at 75%. If it's far from it, find another survivor to apply pressure on. Easy opportunity to get some map pressure in; a downed survivor still attracts people over to pick them up.
---
Hah!
---
Tru3 gets a lot of shit.The other 2 are survivor mains.I actually dont watch Monto simply because his gameplay as a killer is just proxy camp then tunnel.If you want to show examples of streamers that are actually good at killer then talk about Zubat or Scott.They go completely out of their way to not tunnel and still 4k pretty often with most killers.
---
Same thing happens to me. I’ll see I’m about to get broken out and get behind a wall and then I get that red pulsating even though I’m 2 seconds behind the wall. Also another ghost face issue would be some survivors on gens not looking at ghostface at all and still break me out. I doubt they’ll fix this anytime soon, ghost face is only really good playing non swf (from my experience.)
---
OMG YOU DID!
---
Flare checks out
---
Yes I'm the one that called you cute :3 lol!
---
I got memed a lot from that stream
---
Yea I tried nurse once... once.
---
If it's spirit or nurse and they don't believe in their teammates, they just know the match is downhill from there. 5 minutes for like 5k bloodpoints and no fun. Onto the next.
---
If they were chased for a full minute and a half, I'd argue DC'ing more often means the rest escape.
---
I don't know why, but I've found it way easier to escape lobbies where the first guy DC's as I'm like 90% on a gen. That means everyone finished their gen and you're effectively playing against a killer with 3-2 gens left with 3 survivors. As long as the killer doesn't apply pressure way too quickly you usually escape.
---
at least he made that funny video of it.
---
dont know how he did it but yeah was cool
---
The worst players watching you struggle to death, if you are scared to death then go away and fix gen and help the team.
---
Oh yeah, i threw it so hard I made my screen exit full screened, stubbed my toe and spilled water all over myself. I'm very graceful
---
It’ll just be a way of trying to distract you from other survivors
---
From a killer point of view he killed the most toxic player and saved the non toxic, he liked you.
---
Healing under hook would be the way to go
---
You gotta admit, she’s the only one that gets hardcore PISSED when she gets stunned. Literally everyone just groans, wheezes, or laughs like a maniac
---
Amanda sounds adorable as fuck when she squeaks after getting stunned. Makes me hate stunning her, if she wasn’t trying to stab my butt constantly
---
Wow 😮 this is perfect.
---
Survivor main here. While many killers tunnel and get DS'd, there is a chance of just randomly running into that person by accident.
---
Can I get a link for the Noob3 video you are referring to? I know the meme and always thought it was pretty funny but haven't seen the source
---
CNt wait for that sassy headdress
---
'Don't complain about me getting a free kill for failing if you get tunneled!'
---
Thing is that some killers just don’t have the ability to apply map pressure due to the mechanics of the killer.  M1 killers need a game stalling perk such as ruin but a lot of them run noed instead because ruin can just be ignored by good survivors or cleansed instantly.  Noed can’t be ignored and far more often than not gets at least 1 one shot down, saving a ton of time.  
---
Killers like billy can get great map pressure due to his one shot down and map mobility, while trapper has to waste time setting traps that may not even work and wraith has to always hit survivors twice in a chase to apply any pressure (both killers lack any map mobility at base).  When you see a spirit billy or nurse running noed they’re probably boosted af (could be memeing too).  Just important to keep in mind that noed can be used both as a compensation for bad skill, and for bad killer design.
---
Its uncommonly common.  I had it happen a few times.  There are many reasons as to why someone would do it but you'll definitely see it.
---
Facts, which is why I always bring an ebony mori.
---
“Think your group can shit on me, be toxic, and ‘have fun?’ Yeah, enjoy not playing the game”
---
Distressing, ruin, enduring and Franklin's demise.
---
Yep. Just breathe down their neck and press the button. Make sure it’s a tap, because grabs and lunges are very picky against each other. Or just play doctor and you can do it in treatment mode by just spam tapping it cause reasons.
---
So long as swf and looping exists 
---
She will never be  nerfed
---
Deal with it
---
Head on worked?
---
Looks like shes turning into a titan.
---
Depends on what you’re playing. For survivors, I picked one to be the main survivor got the others to 40 and let them go. For killers I just keep leveling anyone I actively like to play and the others I’ve only gotten to 40/50 and let them stay there for dailies and such.
---
If a chase is going on for too long, abandon it and move on to someone else
---
Try to make sure you have 3 generators that are close to one another when the survivors have only one gen left. It will force them to fix the gens right in front of you, and if played correctly, makes it unwinnable.
---
Look for certain loops and categorize them as safe or unsafe. You’ll generally want to lead the survivor to unsafe loops where you can get easy hits, such as a pallet with short walls, and you’ll sometimes want to ignore kicking that pallet since you can easily mindgame the survivor into screwing up. Immediately destroy pallets at safe areas though, where there are long walls, as the survivor can just wrap around constantly until you break the pallet.
---
Hex: Ruin every game. Never take it off, alongside barbecue and chili since you can just pinball survivors while they try to find the totem or force the gens
---
Practice killers like nurse and billy, since they’re top tier and easily the best killers in the game. Nurse can just outright end the chase if you land blinks, and billy can do the same with chainsaw, though much harder
---
And that’s all I got
---
I let my lower rank friends host if I'm the only high rank friend playing just so they dont get demolished. I host if they want a real challenge. I honestly hate playing against low rank killers, but I'm never an asshole to them.
---
After over a year of favoring Nea, I started using Dwight; I like him.
---
This does happen, and it is a problem, but so does a 4 man SWF of 3 rank 2 and one rank 20, which is alot worse of a problem.
---
Wonder why i did not see this when i last played. Ofc there were those that tried to keep me occupied which is normal but don't remember seeing anyone spamming like this most of the match. Also if the bait didin't work back then ppl abandoned it and switched to gens. Who knows maybe the answer is simply i just happened to find some one-track minded ppl :D
---
They do stack. You may not notice the difference between the two because you’ll save maybe one second (at that point) unless the killer has anything else to slow healing. But yes you can stack all speed bonuses while healing someone else. If the person you’re healing has Leader, and you have an activated Spine Chill, you’re pretty much gonna be an instant heal.
---
Once had a game where all pallets were invisible, pretty neat
---
True, but only working trough ruin and not tapping you are able to learn the skillchecks
---
The difference in this case would be 3 veteran players "guiding" the rank 20 so he isn't a complete dead weight. 
---
In this match they were both brand new players thrown in our match and while killer was the correct rank to face me and the other guy. It was also the second time this happened in my recent matches.
---
Not really her fault. 
---
They tried to kobe (I managed to unhook them before they used all 3 attempts) and didn't even know how to struggle so they died on second hook.
---
When I play with my friends I usually like to switch up my perks a bit, it's great cause I can experiment without getting killed immediately. And honestly sometimes it's just fun to mess around with perks like head on, since I still fail half the time lmao  
---
Or just go full on medic mode ~~and farm my friends~~
---
*Sad*
---
Seems like you will be stuck with new players forever then.
---
It’s unofficial, and usually the way it’s done is with teams of 4 survivors and a killer, with the dedicated killer player trying to prevent the other team’s survivors from escaping, while the dedicated survivors play against the other team’s killer. Killers earn points for kills, and survivors earn points for escape.
---
Bitch hag will eat anything at this poimt
---
No, the queue is retarded and does some backwards math  "averaging" formula based of the color rank when you get a SWF group.
---
The queue will eventually toss whatever rank to fill your game, but that is separate from the SWF exploit. Queuing with a lower ranks in SWF is a common exploit - try playing killer on a weekend some time and watch the ranks you hit.
---
Everybody gangsta til jah starts murdering people
---
What is the difference between a God pallet and a normal one?
---
I got a little bit teary there, just a lil bit &lt;3
---
Bricky also started minecraft videos.
---
It's hard for me to imagine a game, where killer doesn't focus on easier targets, but the final score are 29k and 2k
---
Amazing. I'd definitly buy
---
Self care sure is stronger than NOED.
---
When I was new to the game I was camped and tunneled by killers so there is that. Once a wraith threw the match just to get me because I blinded him once at a pallet. Low ranks are cancer for survivor as well.
---
Cannibal is a killer
---
Sub 10 is below killer rank ten
---
And insidious is a killer perk that hides your terror radius when you stand still
---
My bad, I just read the TL;DR and it sounds like you mean loadouts that are already in the game.
---
Had a game yesterday like this, pos teammates left me on the hook the hole time and were just pacing back and forth in the distance not doing anything! These were purple rank 5 and 2 rank 6 players! For the last few weeks I’ve had tons of players in the purple and red ranks just walking around like zombies, all braindead and useless!
---
Exactly, this perk is straight up garbage... I thought also about using it on Huntress since she has only 20m TR and doesn't hum in chases. But it doesn't really do much, beside being gimmicky as you said.
---
I mean... I can escape almost any killer and get a 4K almost every match as killer sooooo... where do I fit in?
---
&gt;It is tho. If they ever use a window drop, just teleport down and meet them when they fall. You are they only killer that can reliably counter fences, overall nurse’s good on this map
---
what rank are you? Without any blink range addons she cant 4k on red ranks. trust me :)
---
Throw self care out, always run adrenaline, iron will isn't as good as people say
---
dead hard, borrowed time, adrenaline, 4th slot
---
4th slot suggestions: DS / Bond / Unbreakable / We'll Make It
---
Exactly, this map is pretty much unwinnable anyway if survivors don't group up, even if nobody has BL.
---
Ah. Because this pallet is infamously known for being very easy to loop for a long time. High rank survivors can easily loop the shack because of the god pallet for the majority of the game. It's a super safe pallet and that's why you almost never want to use it early game.
---
Oh, thanks!
---
Thanks for your reply! But why would I throw Selfcare out? I think it is a really great perk
---
It is in rotation, you were just lucky \^\_\^
---
It's usable, you just don't get rewarded for JUST BEING HIT
---
Unfortunately no
---
Maps are garbage when at high rank. You learn gen positions and other things, so they don't have much of a use. The only thing they are good at is to find the hatch and you have to either get a Rainbow Map to track that or put an addon to track it.
---
If you want to use a map to its full potential you have to bring a rainbow one, otherwise you have to put on addons to make them useful. You can use them to track things like traps, but it's not really useful inside of a chase and they have very low durability.
---
Honestly, right now, I think maps are best used as a totem and hatch finder more than anything. But if you want to escape the match asap, bringing a toolbox is the best thing and if you don't wanna run self-care better bring a medkit.
---
The problem with maps is also that there are only 2 map items, the normal and the rainbow one, so they are the rarest item type you can get. I wish they were buffed.
---
His ability is annoying. He feels like Legion 2.0 in terms of broken, unfair gameplay.
---
*gets hit with Iron Maiden*
---
You can hear when Hag teleports to one of her traps even if it's far away from you :) It just depends who activates the first trap :D But same with bing bong or LF.
---
Unless you suck at escaping and dealing with the killer.😔
---
3 survivors can knock out plenty of gens while a survivor is hooked. By completing gens instead of mindlessly trying to unhook together it forces the killer to make a choice either camp one guy and lose a pip because camping does nothing for pips if nobody is helping. Or leave him and stop the rest from completely gens. I can't believe I have to explain this to you, you must be new. In my games however autistic survivors just love to all try and save the guy hooked without gen rushing and I end up getting 3-4k off it because they don't know how to counter. Learn the counter stop blaming camping it's your fault.
---
You have a fair point, I always thought the reveal mechanic was stupid, why punish someone for looking at a killer? 
---
My only other gripe about Ghostface is the free roaming insidious. It didn't bother me after I got back to purple ranks but man, that slog through yellow and green proxy campers was a nightmare lol
---
It's hard to do here because the survivor can see the killer (and should be keeping an eye on them) but that billy could have walked backwards to *try* and catch the survivor off guard. If the survivor isn't paying enough attention, or is just focusing on the red light they may not react fast enough to the killer changing directions and end up close enough to them that they can't throw the pallet before being hit.
---
It's a lot easier with a full wall that you can't see the killer over.
---
BHRV doesnt have the rights to any scream character btw
---
Oh no, I'm not calling for a nurse nerf, I'm in console. She needs a buff on there if anything.
---
I'm hoping they don't touch her at all as she's almost unplayable on console
---
Welcome to the game and community. 
---
1) 360s do not work all the time, but I believe it is easier on the PC to achieve with the faster move speed of the mouse. (Noob3 has a great demonstration of how he does them, but again on PC)
---
2) If you vault a window in real life, I can still hit you when your through it by reaching through it. Same for DBD (in a sense). It may also be down to lag that you get smacked when you really shouldn't. It's unfortunate, but dedicated servers will be with that.
---
I only put it on when all or nearly all of the survivors are using items, or I see particularly annoying items, like keys. If there are no items, no need to use it, as chest items don’t affect my games very often
---
This meme could have been worded so many different ways and all of them would have been better than what you chose
---
He's very cute, but he just doesn't work in high ranks
---
Well range addons and more blinj addons are good the rest is pretty much useless to me
---
As a Kate main, I salute you and your new hobby.
---
Oh! Hahaha! Aaaah yes! Shah! I get it! Ohoho! Yes, yes, yeah! It's because the character name is... wait for it... Tapp! Hahaha! And the post says something about... wait for it... tapping! Hahahahhahaha yes I am also hilarious and I definitely understand what you are saying. Ohohoho. I love such gallantry. You know, this takes me back to when I was but a young lad and sat atop a tree on the moors and whistled for my friend who was trodding along the narrow path. Him and me observed a gentleman littering. Littering! Of all things! We observed him litter and I said to my friend, I said to him, hey I think I'm going to say something about that, what do you say? And my friend says yes. So I go to this man and his litter and I said to him, I said, Oi mate you cannea be litteren ere mate you need a loicanse for tha. And you know what this man said? Haha Haha, you know what he said? He said Ah shucks I never done nothing I didn't do shit. Ohohoho. What a lovely tale this was, that you reminded me of. Ahahaha, yes. I am deeply pleased with your humourous comment in the sense that I find it amazing you are able to say so much with so little. And I've had many times where I felt like I've been able to do that too, you know? Ohohoho, I often say a lot less than I mean to say. It is as though I say one thing but I mean a thousand things such as right now. I like to keep my interactions short and sweet, you know? Like a baby's penis. Although, sometimes, hahaha, you know, sometimes, sometimes I just think to myself, wow, I can say so much with so little and yet I'm able to surround myself with people who understand, you know? I mean, yes, indubitably. I have so many more things to say but I think I'd much rather not say too little in fear of saying too much, you know? I don't want people to get the wrOOoOOoOng idea. My friend, you have brightened my day a thousand fold. I wish you many blessings in your life, and I wish you many beautiful children and feasts all the same. Ohohoho hahahaha, yeees. Happy! Teeheehee.
---
"Oh, I think I know what you'd like."
---
"Oh my!"
---
Happens to me all the time
---
Def still worth it. They devs finally have been giving the community constant updates and the game is in a better state than I think it’s ever been. There will always be a few bugs but this is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made
---
Same but you can still hear it though
---
Balanced landing, BT, Adrenaline, and whatever 4th perk you want
---
Fantasy land I imagine.
---
Maybe Haddonfield isn't a very good map for Nurse, but she's the only killer who stand a chance against a team with 4 Balanced Landing on that map, the other killers would get bullied so hard, maybe except Prayer Beads Spirit ... Also, Lery's and Rotten Fields are worse than Haddonfield for sure, at least for Nurse.
---
Honestly, I don;t like Myers mori, it's too buggy for me, I can't watch it... Hag's mori is top tier, wtf :O I also really like Legion's mori.
---
Those perks are both C-tier at best.
---
If you get bored easily then I would recommend playing killer over survivor since there is much more variety but killer queue times are longer.
---
Simply dumb it ain’t my fault if i don’t leave cause your right there
---
Amazing job as Kate, can't wait to see your Plague! My fav killer right now!
---
This is a toxic game at its core; the problem with DBD is that it's more of an activity than a game. The ranks and blood points are fairly irrelevant on a meta scale. Once the devs tackle ranked, the meta of the game will evolve again - until then, rank 2s and 18s will come together to grab the all important pips
---
Oh you were referring to A tier perks like Vigil?
---
I maybe bias as I stream but I don't do the above but this doesn't refer to just people who stream, one of my friends who has recently got into streaming, plays killer, is rank 17 and was going against these kinda people a lot and none of them where streamers. I just don't get why people seem to have this get your pitchforks out when it comes to people who stream.
---
Speed addons are pretty handy on console
---
Mercy or they like your character.
---
REEEE-AHHH!
---
He is more so variety then just dbd but yeah bricky is doing it also
---
Oh ho, then loop me as much as you want.
---
Tell BHVR to give us an unranked mode, and you won't have to play with me and my one friend who are red rank survivors, and my two green rank friends.
---
Get her take! The top is amazing. Those boots oof. Wish the blood was thicker tho and was on the wig too.  In the more recent patches they've really increased the thickness of the blood on her.
---
This is interesting, as you seem to be mistaken in thinking killers are always at fault if they can’t kill everyone before endgame. Obviously killer skill plays a big part in it, but even skilled killers can’t do much against 4 man SWF all with high tier items. The weakest killers like freddy need noed or ruin in order to actually get kills due to this. If killers listened to you and wanted to apply gen pressure, they’d stop playing fun killers and all play billy or nurse, yeah, that’d be fun.....
---
I’m personally getting tired of seeing the pathetic argument noed kills are unearned kills. I suppose you would also argue survivors who escape with BNP toolbox’s are unearned escapes, or adrenaline being used to save you is an unearned escape? Because unlike with noed that, while difficult to fully counter, actually CAN be countered, there is no counter to BNP if they use them at the start of the match, or adrenaline, period. If the killer knows they are a weaker killer, and they want to basically have 3 perks the whole game to have endgame potential, that’s there choice.
---
Your comment does at least prove OP’s point, survivors will usually blame the killer for dying before blaming themselves.
---
Anything with movement speed is op and anything that ignores the health status of a survivor is annoying imo
---
Why does every killer main claim looping is bad /toxic
---
Tell me an alternative, preventative action to not get killed when the killer is on your ass? Or are you saying people should just never get found in the first place and always play stealthily? People do that and then get flamed for being "immersed claudettes". And then there's stealth killers that make it far more difficult to be hidden at the right times as to not get found.
---
Literally nothing a survivor can do to prolong the match in their favour is accepted for some reason. I am really, really interested to hear what you thinl a survivor *should* do when they're found.
---
How frustrating would it be for your power to be shut down without any indication of why? At least this lets you differentiate between ‘victim saw me-commence chase’ and ‘someone else there-turn around’
---
If you like getting chased a lot, Self-Care won't be much use since you won't get a chance to use it, but I've found that Decisive Strike, Self-Care, Balanced Landing, and Borrowed Time (if you want to be altruistic) or Adrenaline.  If any get switched around I would say switch Borrowed Time for Adrenaline or vice versa.
---
The thing with noed is that even the movement speed alone is powerful because that way the killer can get to the gates much quicker and then the one hit does the rest. There are so many moments where i would have escaped if it wasnt for the movement speed boost.
---
He’s one of the easiest killers to loop, sooooo.....
---
Ok but you could literally repost this changing the word killers for survivors and it would be equally valid. Both sides salty af
---
As someone who plays killer and survivor equally I would say there are definitely things that need to change on both sides. The main difference is that the survivor bullshit is being nerfed (MoM, DS, map reworks) whereas as the killer bullshit isn’t (NOED, moris, OP add-ons). I main spirit and tbh her prayer beads are a joke to the point I rarely use them now as it feels like borderline cheating
---
Ruin is special in that it is shit for both survivors (if they can’t find it) and killers (if it gets found early in the match). I would rather see them nerf it alongside a complete rework to the time it takes to complete gens, to get rid of the RNG factor
---
I’m kind of thinking of killer players going through their daily lives (bubba mains chilling in the basement, for example).
---
Give us a survivor where only one of then can enter a match, has a special powerful ability tied to them and requires skill to pull off and it'll be even.
---
You can't give one side a character that has such a high skill curve that they grow out of the balanced area and straight up into "OP". That's basically what you're saying the nurse is. *every* killer gets better with skill as they learn how to counter loops and play smart, but nurse takes this to another level and when fully mastered isn't even in the same realm as the other killers. That's bad game design. You can claim they "deserve" to be OP because they had it rough but what about the other side? What did the survivors do to "deserve" to be destroyed by this player? 
---
Then theres also the fact that, while some people might have to really practice with nurse, others pick her up naturally. Do they still deserve to be that strong? They never went through any hardships with her.
---
So obviously this isn’t holding the game hostage since a survivor can still do gens, the killer is being a dick though. This isn’t fun for anyone involved
---
Exactly, man.
---
Look, just try winning a chase against any experienced spirit and it’s not going to work. Or just play her yourself and you’ll see how easy it is.
---
The point I’m trying to make is what little mindgame potential there is against spirit is heavily sided with her. Yes, you can mindgame a spirit. But there are too many factors that make it in her favor.  It’s all basically luck and hoping you make the right decision as a survivor. You can find many half decent survivor and killer players on twitch who share a similar opinion (ex: Otzdarva,  Ussylis)
---
All your doing is explaining that it is possible to mindgame her- but chances are those will barely work against any decent spirit and you need to know her addons for half them to work. As a solo player, your only getting 3 chases to figure that out.
---
With activation time addons, she can fake it and instantly enter phase if you run away. With duration/speed addons, slow vaulting a pallet with just get you grabbed and staying on one side will get you hit. (Which, while your deciding to vault or not you still need to hope she isn’t faking it, a mindgame that is heavily in the spirits favor.) If you run away, your loud footsteps and scratch marks guarantee a hit on you. Even walking- your not going to make much distance that way and if she doesn’t hear you then it takes very little time to scout you out in whatever shitty area you’ve zoned yourself into. And if your injured without iron will, you might as well be a beacon for her with how loud you are.
---
Again, play against any experienced spirit or just do it yourself and you’ll see how difficult it is to mindgame her. It’s not happening.
---
Same. Just about gave up on the match and almost forgot I had it lol.
---
Welcome to DBD where the killer is always wrong and the points don’t matter.
---
Well yeah, they complain because a coordinated swf is really good. There's no reason to wonder why it would happen
---
No context needed
---
Lmao that reminds me of yesterday when I grabbed a jane jumping out of a locker with head on and it didnt activate
---
I agree to remove this mechanic, if he 
---
will just lose the ability to stalk for a few seconds, but not his ability with 30 seconds cooldown.
---
Removed we ask you take part in this community before advertising your channel
---
Thing is they're catering to equal morons. So morons will watch those toxic assholes AND they like it. Idiots will always have an audience, that's the sad part.
---
I was a new survivor recently too and I had nothing nearly as bad as that one game of killer.  Sometimes I won't agree with how the killer played but I haven't had anything incredibly toxic.
---
Swap unrelenting and distressing for iron grasp and sloppy butcher. Iron grasp is helpful for carrying survivors to the hook longer and sloppy butcher is great for increasing the amount of time survivors have to heal, which gives you more time in general
---
I really dont want to buy the hag, gimme ruin pls :c
---
Tru3 is a nurse player and a skilled survivor and he pretty much knows how to effectively counter a nurse. 
---
(https://youtu.be/mfQIBRVj6pg)
---
Yeah, now where on earth are you going to catch the plague?
---
Vigil does need a buff though... it’s just not worth taking up a perk slot.
---
She does not really need a buff on console. Ever since the devs have improved FPS on consoles at least on Ps4 I have seen many monster nurses she just takes time to learn to get good with her
---
When you're down like that, adrenaline and Bill's perk unbreakable become SO useful. Worth running either of them on a long-term build!
---
Dbd: bitching is not an escape
---
When you are a powerful killer but still need the entity to carry your ass to rank 1.
---
It started because nea does not look like a normal human being. It also became popular because of samination
---
The only thing I wish people would do is if they fuck up a ruin skill check to STOP WORKING ON IT FOR A FEW SECONDS. It doesn't progress anyway during that time however it's still possible to trigger another skill check which might blow it up more than it already has
---
In my mind, if I hear rapid fast vaults, I just think, “ok that guys not doing shit for his team, I’ll leave him alone”
---
The left behind, I'm assuming that refers to the hatch. If that's the case, it would encourage leaving teammates to die so you could live which is not a route behaviour wants to go.
---
Is playing SWF an abuse now?
---
What happens if I buy a perk in Shrine that I already have unlocked the teachable for?  Will I get bloodpoints or will my shards just vanish?
---
And spend 2K just to have technical issues I won't understand?
---
Console 4 lyfe man
---
 without any perks or add-ons nurse can 4k on any map on any ranks. trust me :)
---
You try to find survivor and then to end the chase as fast as possible. Down them, put them on the hook, go for BBQ aura or the gen you think they're on.
---
Or you can use 3-gens strategy, if that fits your playstyle more.
---
Mm, the time I spawned as Nurse with a survivor a blink and a half away directly in front of me. Nom nomm.
---
In 3 hours I think.
---
I may do them all. I haven’t decided.
---
I hope, cause I've yet to see one in red after 2 months
---
[My own](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c23s9p/morezpack_for_300/)
---
I always felt like, as killer, decisive strike was fair and realistic. I mean, I could always just get that survivor again, anyway. Same with self-care and gens/gates before their times got extended
---
Meg: no, IS NOT RUNNING, IS TACTICAL RETREAT!
---
Nice work dood :D it looks cool beans
---
I didn’t give permission to be mentioned here
---
Boner
---
From what I heard, frosty eyes means terrible killer and has noed, boar huntresses suck and have iridescent head all the time,hound huntresses are really good, aces with hats are really good, bubbas usually respect pallets and are dumb
---
Based on anecdotal evidence, the reason why a lot of people don't play Killer is because they "feel bad". I can understand it: you are legitimately in charge of how much fun the Survivors have. You can choose to tunnel and camp, or you can play with your food and barely let *some of them* escape. BBQ &amp; Chili is genius (if band-aid) game design for encouraging you to find and skewer every Survivor at least once.
---
When meeting and talking to Survivors, it's surprising how many of them are female or effeminate. I hate to encourage stereotypes, but it seems that gender plays a big part in the niches. It *does* fit all the "Daddy" getting thrown around (I call female Killers "Daddy" too). Also, the [Quantic Foundry data](https://quanticfoundry.com/2016/12/15/primary-motivations/) backs it up.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Honestly, I feel like Killer appeals most to those scoring high on the niche "Power" gamer motivation, as well as "Competitive". One of the questions on the survey is literally, "do you enjoy dominating other players?" 
---
There is a [gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_A) present in all of us, known as the "Warrior Gene" or the "Psycho Gene", MAO-A, which [is linked to aggression in a variant carried by 33% of people](https://www.mygenefood.com/warrior-gene-5-common-myths/). Perhaps you can get a decent balance between Survivors and Killers just by relying on statistics.
---
Honestly, I've never thought before that Killer wouldn't necessarily appeal more than Survivor, if "left to its own devices". I just always assumed stress and balance kept it functional. But correlation does not equal causation, and it's entirely possible people who like Killer are just naturally more stressed. 
---
I can't be the only one who has fired up DBD to slaughter virgins, simply because I had a bad day. And the key to doing that is picking Hag or Nurse (assuming you know how to play them), to assure that you don't have a worse day.
---
I feel like the optimal way to judge this would be a survey asking, "would you like to consistently play Killer for fun at some point?"
---
Eh, some of these are reliant on add-ons, which I don't think makes for a fair and accurate assessment.
---
Killer giving you the hatch after destroying your teammates is a sign of true friendship
---
Wraith should be up with the legion and clown with his bell
---
The community survey a little while back asked opinions on giving a bloodpoint multiplier to whichever side needed more players (survivor right now).
---
I think that would help a lot with the killer queues and more bloodpoints is always a good thing with how grindy the game is.
---
Not my case. Got all 3 in my second try ;)
---
I'm waiting, I'm waiting.
---
I only play perkless when i stream :)
---
I regret it only when i play trihard nursesand billys with mori
---
Honestly, the matchmaking should be better then....I am the only one of my friends who grinds the game constantly so when they do finally get on it’s not my fault who I get matched with! Don’t hate the player hate the game.
---
Thank you very much &lt;3
---
Can’t or don’t want to? Solo que is boring as fuck and like ripping your own hair out. No one saves anyone. No one does gens. No one knows how to keep the killers attention.
---
Where do you got the picture?
---
It's so nice seeing my own pack being recogised by someone
---
He could drag them, But hooking them idk
---
Nah nah no worries at all. This was a super useful conversation honestly, because it highlights one of the major disconnects in player perspective that causes fundamental disagreements on really strong perks and abilities.
---
The sound is normally blocked by obstacles for survivors, which means an aura outline would be insanely strong combined with the 3rd person view
---
"you cant defeat me"  
---
"I know, but she can"
---
It’s a beauty :)
---
Supply and Demand. Yes, that would be genius. Especially with how much more profitable Killer can be. And it doesn't affect the experience or gameplay at all (in theory).
---
I've noticed on Swamp, hatches usually seem to spawn on the edge of the map like that. Had a similar game where I was killer, killed 3 with only 1 gen done, I checked all over. That little tugboat, all in the center, around the parts with windows etc, nothing. Then come to a little cropping of trees on the edge of the map and sure enough, there it is as well as the survivor.
---
&gt; no add-ons or perks she's still totally busted
---
Lol no
---
Mr. Bing Bong is probably my favorite killer to play. He's one of the weaker killers, but he is good at lower ranks (which I'm at). Killer queues take too long at my rank, so I don't play killer that often, but when I do, I play Wraith and have fun! He's got an interesting backstory as well; overall, he's just a Good Boy
---
I know. I only run A tier perks and A tier perks only. Premonition and Spine Chill.
---
No you do
---
Generators produce electricity.
---
Objectively, yes
---
Except Lery's against insta medi SWF, where I still think in average lobbies it's still winnable, there's not gonna be a question of Nurse's 4k'ing everyone. You have to be mad to think otherwise.
---
DS is the most common obsession perk by far.
---
If there is no obsession in the match, DS is not in the match.
---
If there is an obsession and you, the killer, aren't running an obsession perk, you can expect DS being on someone.
---
DS makes it more likely OTHER people are the obsession, so the obsession is usually most safe to tunnel, anyone else playing riskily or bodyblocking chases after an unhook tend to doing so as they have a free save from DS.
---
Also it's common with other second chance perks, if a survivor has shown dead hard, and sometimes deliverance, they're more likely to be the one running DS than survivors running other perks.
---
It's all about it's maximum potential. One guy gets away with DS it's no big deal, but if all 4 got to use it you were fucked. MoM was pretty much the same.
---
He is plausible at high ranks, but you won't 4K the majority of matches. If you haven't already I'd recommend running Carberator Tuning Guide with The Beast's Marks. Speedy Bubba is Death-To-All Bubba.
---
this happens to me when something has bugged in my game
---
New cosmetics are coming today?
---
That is the worst nurse I've ever seen good lord
---
Yes cause tunneling is much fun
---
At least make left behind benefit from DCs as well and honestly poised is very strong in a swf and the runner runs it while everyone does gens. Everytime one completes the runner gets to have no scratch marks for a while and can confuse a killer who doesn't have line of sight
---
Bubba is my bae. =]
---
I got tunneled a game and camped the two others.  I love some aspects of this game but fuck it’s completely awful at times.
---
It is a pen, not ballpoint though
---
While true, one also has to take into account that any player may play both roles, to varying degrees and at differing times. Which evidently a lot of players in this game do. And then that the queue time logic of player distribution is in itself an incentive/deterrent for players to pick a respective role - if killer queue times are long due to not enough players queueing as survivor, more of those would-be-killers will instead queue as survivor, fed up with said queue times.
---
So given that, I would not say that the survivor gameplay experience has to be downright four times as attractive as the killer gameplay experience, but I definitely agree that for a sufficiently well-functioning matchmaking, it should be at least twice as attractive. I do believe the current killer queue times are caused in large part by a shift in how relatively-attractive the respective sides' gameplay experience is (and more than improvements for the killer side, I think the survivor experience's state of being stale at best and in constant deterioration at worst is at fault), but I also suspect that BHVR's messing with the matchmaking system has contributed. It was very obvious when they initially started changing things that those changes mostly had ill effects. Now they appear to keep experimenting with it, and coinciding with the of-late ridiculous killer queue times was the re-introduction of the "Searching For Match" phase when queueing as killer, which I reckon isn't much of a coincidence.
---
It literally takes 5 minutes to do gens, plus 2-3 minutes to find them. There's plenty of time if EVERYONE keeps an eye out for one.
---
Think about the Meta if you shifted devour hope to a perk instead of a totem. Then players would care. Look at how much the community whined back when Trappers traps respawned? Made a dead rank killer suddenly mid tier.
---
The Meta needs a shift because right now it is Frakkin stuck.
---
&gt;Objectively

---
I guess I don't understand why you'd play this game if it made you that neurotic, or why the rest of us should draw any conclusions whatsoever from one anxious person's anecdote about being triggered by playing this horror survival game.
---
STOP UNHOOKING TEAMMATES WHEN UR GETTING CHASED BY THE FUCKING KILLER !!! AND TO THE KILLERS THAT WITNESS THIS SHIT IN A GAME ATLEAST GIVE THE UNHOOKED SURVIVOR A HEAD START AND GO AFTER THE OTHER INSTEAD
---
Yeah that's a big one new people wouldn't get, for the love of God let the generator buffer (what else would you call it)
---
Lol but that's what Kate wears.
---
Also true, never give up a ruin training day
---
I love playing The Wraith, both as and against.
---
All the killers are on sale, so how do you rank them for fun? I'm interested in Spirit, Myers, Legion, and Vommy Mommy right now.
---
She’s not that bad on console? She obviously can’t flick like she can on pc but max your sensitivity and you should be able to get most people. Got to rank 3 with her last season before switching to survivor. Wouldn’t like to see her nerfed at all. She’s one of the few primarily skill based killers
---
Well, most groups take advantage of the fact that if they have a low rank on their team it skews the system in their favor
---
Huh? Don't you mean: "this post before my eyes could have been worded so many possible different ways and this could be you after doing it better."
---
I'd say the clown. The wraith and the cannibal all need just a little something
---
150k
---
So where can you find the third anniversary contest finalists? I can't find it anywhere.
---
You’ve clearly not played enough red then. There’s more than a few good nurses on Xbox
---
apply map pressure and end chases quickly
---
ah my mistake, thank you!
---
Don't touch my poised
---
Huntress since all her perks are trash
---
I read the first part 6 times before I gave up.
---
Im still waiting on that answer :/
---
Not just that, but she's a 110% move-speed killer, which makes her even harder to play without game-delay perks.
---
That is totally *not* DARN!
---
MoM would be fine if it all protection hits actually counted towards it. It works when you take a hit for someone being hooks, but doesn't when you take one for an injured person being chased even though they both give points for protection.
---
Is that how it works? I will try and keep that in mind when playing with my friends who are lower ranks. :) I'm never toxic but I just feel so bad when my rank 18/17 friends are going against a purple rank because I managed to swing my way to red ranks. :(
---
Bucciarati coming out of a zipper
---
Hardest to get adept, imo is probably Wraith. His perks are kinda junk on him, and don't really compliment his playstyle. Likewise he isn't a strong killer. To get adept you must do the perfect rotations, no camping, each survivor hooked 2 to 3 times, and you must end chases quickly. Likewise you have to stop that gen progression most of the game. I got adept on Leatherface, not even trying after I prestiged him and it was kinda easy. Knockout plus Franklin's can slow the game while Bbq keeps you from wasting too much time. The wraith just wastes so much time with his base perks that don't even help him.
---
If it was a perk, it would be broken as fuck. Like, lets not lol.
---
So basically
---
https://i.imgflip.com/30y5fr.jpg
---
Poised is good if the killer has Bitter Murmur or Rancor
---
Yes this is true ofcourse. And if i encounter those kind of groups i tend to not go so hard on the new guy. Yet usually the groups i face all have decent hours, yet one of them is very low rank. 
---
And sure, its not a problem for me i have ~1k hours, but if a new killer faces those kind of groups its gonna get ugly and discourage new people from playing the game. And that sucks.
---
Both exit gates were open? It doesn't sound like a loss on their end.
---
Once BHVR patches it those loops are just gonna become mindless again.
---
Poised and Technician aren't useless. I like both and I run both. But I do agree they might need a slight buff so they become more viable, but not full on reworks.
---
I trapped a freddy at the basement pallet in the game
---
Legion got reworked people don't DC against him like that anymore.
---
I’m rank 6 but I get red rank survivors in my games. I do well with him but as mentioned, he is very map dependant. I find his Night Shroud more useful for sneaking up and getting the first hit on survivors rather than being able to expose them. I managed to get lots of downs as well by using it at loops to remove my red stain and terror radius.
---
On the right map (such as the Asylums or Thompson House) I manage to get them exposed a lot by stalking out from the top of the buildings and then going down and chasing them in the direction they ran off. 
---
He’s still punished to some extent by loops and a lack of mobility to pressure gens.
---
People generally dislike clown because they feel that he is boring. All you do with him is just throw gas in a loop, then the survivor drops the pallet early. Rinse and repeat.
---
Personally I really love clown. He's fun to use and he's pretty decent in terms of tier lists and meta strength. I also adore his cosmetics (Santa outfit and green hair smiley mask)
---
How do high-level survivors look where there going at the same time able to look behind them to see the killer? Or do they just wait for the sound and red stain?
---
My situation is usually me with 3 new to the game friends and I'm rank 4 survivor so they get dunked on by the "averaged out rank" killer - my only logical choice is to use a smurf account and maybe try to play a little more relaxed.  Kinda wish they had a "casual queue" or something.
---
Had that too in the resting place map. Annoying match
---
C L A U D E T T E
---
Wasnt bond in there like 2 or 3 weeks ago
---
"Am I the bad survivor?"
---
"No it's just the killer! let me queue with my rank 4 friends and use OP toolboxes to get all 5 gens done in 2 minutes despite ruin still being up and call him a baby killer even though there was literally nothing he could do about it so I can feel accomplished with myself"
---
I was at rank 10, then dropped to 15. I stopped taking my games seriously and started fucking around because hey, if my teammates are doing it why not I?
---
Then when you decide to play by this rule when you are the killer, you get post game chat calling you trash for not being good enough to catch all the survivors. But if you knock everyone down anyway you still get called trash for not making the match easy for them. Idk what you want anymore.
---
I'll still have fun with a Dwight ;)
---
They need nerfs, I don't know how should they go about it though
---
I’m not saying I agree with the way the pipping system works but considering how much he plays this game you’d think he would understand that the Emblem system is completely separate and not related to Bloodpoints at all. 
---
His Gatekeeper was Gold which means the gens got done too quickly based off the requirements to get Iridescent.
---
did minecraft get a big update or something that caused this?
---
Borrowed time and decisive strike

---
Because bloodpoint generation and categories don't correlate exactly to emblems? 
---
I would think someone with his amount of hours would understand that.
---
And most of them Leatherfaces get anxiety when they see no auras with bbq so they chill at the hook even more likely.
---
Because they'd rather just complain, much easier.
---
Yeah, but I believe they also added a chance for the others to take the obsession, because once someone who isn’t currently the obsession uses ds, they take obsession status.
---
So genuine question. I've posted gameplay as a killer were I walked around the hook in the end game and gotten nothing but salt here about being a camper. Now this guy is ACTUALLY just standing here camping and it's fine. I don't understand what's up with that.
---
I mean bond is amazing so I wouldn't mind it coming to the shrine a lot
---
Remember me on the other hand....
---
Except that sidebar one frequently won't update for weeks, at least for me.
---
So it's sort of worthless.
---
This is the thing- They DON'T go together well. No Mither renders Solidarity and Self-Care useless, and Object of Obsession makes your game even more dangerous since he can see you if you look in his direction. This is basically a meme build for people to run.
---
He did it before it became a trend, what a legend bricky is
---
I thought the biggest problem with the Nurse was Omegablink? I feel like they should start there, nerf that and try and bring the lower tier killers up a bit.
---
Play Nurse and slug everybody. 
---
Prayer Beads Spirit can also help.
---
That's not how it works. Regardless of who is hosting, the game will try to match you at the average rank.
---
Never seen a hacker in the past few years
---
It's not the killers fault that the game plan of every team is get out as fast as possible and get 8k points.
---
Oh we found the person who has a swf group and let the rank 15 host the game.

---
They should just change the adept achievement for killers to be getting a 4k or something.  Survivors only have to escape to get it, which is a joke because you can be a mostly useless gen jockey all game and get the achievement on literally any survivor.  
---
Having to run shit perks AND best the emblem system as killer is a horrible pain in the ass unless youre willing to derank and play potatoes just to achievement farm.
---
Poised is not useless. Your variant of Poised seems actually useless tbh.
---
I only give the hatch to survivors that deserve it, or in other words
---
1. Survivors that looped me really well
---
2. Survivors that were farmed by their teammates and would've died other wise
---
3. Survivors that already found hatch
---
4. Survivors that got cucked by their teammates DCing
---
Ashe thinking the survivors are deadites would be fun, but if he ended up being another chainsaw user that would suck.
---
Whattttt???????
---
You can just download the clip right of the app you know.
---
Which is broken, why doesn't it work?
---
I mean it's a video game there's always gonna be people that can figure out a hack or a loophole or a problem. but it doesn't seem to be terrible and it seems like the devs jump on it pretty quick.  there was an issue with palate looping 6 months ago and they dealt with a fairly fast.  A lot of times when you see people screaming about hacks it usually because they don't understand The Killers powers. Like the shape actually has an ability if using the right equipment that he can see you through the walls.
---
All recent killers have had really nice backgrounds. Clown, Spirit Legion, Plague and Ghostface. Personally I like Spirits lore and also how they translated that into the game.
---
To be honest
---
I always tought it was getting a 4K to get it
---
Don't know why you got downvoted, what you said is 100% true.

Killers aren't bound to do anything.
---
Not entirely. An unranked mode would give me a chance to run silly, meaningless builds and not be a hindrance to people trying to rank up.
---
But people do it anyways. A live indicator ingame would be nice to alert people that they are within camping distance. However it resets upon hitting a survivor that is rushing hook
---
Sounds like intentionally deranking to get easier matches.
---
dio and his pasty ass skin.
---
Surprise mechanic ;)
---
I can confirm. In fact it feels like 99% of the time the person who is the obsession DOESN'T have DS. I Rancor'd a dude earlier and another player has DS yet he wasn't the obsession. The Rancor obsession didn't have DS.
---
I also was the subject of a Dying Light with 2 other people running DS (I wasn't running DS.) and I got tombstoned for the trouble. Gee, thanks Laurie! Your DS was totally worth getting me tombstoned! 
---
So yes I can confirm DS usually makes other people the obsession. It feels like 90% of the time the "decoy" obsession at the start of the match doesn't actually have DS, which is stupid.
---
Why not? I'm not trying to be toxic, but if I have to I will camp and tunnel, I am a competitive player and I want to win. And a win for me is a loss for the others.
---
I have a little more than 700 hours in the game since September 2017 playing about 60% Killer and 40% Survivor. In all those hours I was pretty sure I play against hacker exactly 2 times. And was against suspicious player a couple of times more.
---
I'd say it's not really a problem
---
I'm not sure what problems you're having, but I'm finding games pretty easily. Playing killer takes about 30 seconds to find a game, sure. But I'd prefer that to the old method of connecting you to the first group it finds and we all have 400 ping. An extra 25 seconds to find someone with sub 200 ping is worth the wait.
---
Look around you. How many people are suffering from burnout? If they introduce a rewarding system maybe people would still play the game. DBD aint no mmorpg but at least try to fix the existing issues or show that you care about more than pushing content.
---
I saw a hacker in my game only once and I've been playing for a long time. Not really an issue
---
Ain't the main one in this picture Julie and not Frank?
---
Yes. The SWF group matchmaking will only take in account of the rank of the host (the inviter). It’s stupid but that is how it is. 
---
I hope Behaviour fixes it once ingame SWF group lobbies are added so instead it uses the average rank if the group.
---
...and what? What's so special about this screenshot?
---
:/ I’m low rank now because I only play with my friends when our work schedules align properly. But I’ve been rank 1 survivor and killer countless times. My teammates are either gods or potatoes there’s literally never an in between ranks 7-1. I get doing gens isn’t always the more exciting task or if you’re a bad looper you go down fairly quickly but people in Solo que need to realize they’re part of a 4 man team who need to escape and 1 broken leg means those 3 legs need to work twice as hard.
---
Well it says you have to get "Merciless Killer" which you may not necessarily get off a 4k alone.  I mean chances are, if you 4k you're likely going to get it anyway, but it's not a guarantee if you're lacking points in "objectives."
---
I still avoid lobbies with user names that show they're fans of his. It's never fun with those types for anyone.
---
2 Iridecent Head before level 30 P0 Huntress, I just feel lucky, I usually find these things at about 40 and higher.
---
because it was a perfect game? he got 8k in every category, how can you only 1 pip from that? it's just bullshit
---
You fool! First you gotta get them broken so they dont get speed burst while running away.
---
Legion is amazing in my opinion
---
Billy punishes altruism more than spirit does but you are correct. Against optimal survivors spirit will get more pallets and hits because billy can be rendered an M1 killer but you cant escape a good spirit
---
Peanits addressed this back in may.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/486610#Comment_486610
---
Getting on top of a pallet/jumping over them is allowed if the map allows it. If you can run up on that rock without doing a trick its allowed.
---
Peanits used the example of the farm map combines if you lunge to the right and lunge again you can get to them at the window with the ramp doing a lunge trick. You can jump over cars legally on coal tower as well.
---
It just depends on how this spot works if you can run up it normally its fair play according to him.
---
The power of swf is greatly overstated in this sub
---
No, I don’t remember what it was but it was in the asian themed clearance section. I was at a home goods store called “At Home” here in the USA.
---
Probably because your friend was rank 8. People will have a swf game and have a lower ranked player with them to make it an easier killer to go up against.
---
Or tracking
---
Thank you for the knowledge.
---
Freddy who?
---
Legion who?
---
Wraith who?
---
He meant his win/loss ratio.
---
Good luck using it without having the survivors DC
---
For all the shit she gets Pig is still one of the most effective anti-looping killers. Combat straps, medical file, and the ambush power will get the job done or at least get close.
---
Didn't expect that reaction, but that's okay
---
I gotta spill- I used to be a rank 1 in both survivor and killer- I was so fuckin good- but I had to go on break for half a year for education from both dbd and streaming- and since I've changed and no longer stream dead by daylight exclusively I haven't had the time to bring my rank up.
---
Just saying this cause I've had this talk with a killer before after they accused me of smurfing-
---
I wanted to put this here just so you guys know not everyone is doing that on purpose- and if they shit talk they just got into the game heavy.
---
Most of the time when I shit talk I kind of disclaimer it afterwards by saying "they weren't really that bad for the rank, you guys know I have fun being a lil toxic"
---
So reading all these messages lowkey stung
---
Does this all make me a bad person?
---
Had a SWF insult me when I was still relatively new to the game and was like "YOU'RE SO TRASH YOU ONLY HAVE 50 HOURS LOL"
---
All I could really say was "Wait how did I beat you then?"
---
Bond is an amazing perk, but it’s been on here so much and Dwight is worth playing that this is a bad shrine.
---
Trolling the survivors using Blood Warden and taking advantage of end game is my favourite new hobby
---
After freddy's rework (if they make him better) legion is gonna be one of the worst killers next to leather face so yeah dont play him and only level him up for discordance
---
It definitely is a bug. It doesn't at all work properly, sometimes it's directional and sometimes it's not.
---
&gt; Then as killer you feel bad for doing your job 
---
But I enjoy when people DC. ( and no I dont use omega blinks, iridescent heads,...)
---
The non-directional humming makes tracking with her not as bad as before.
---
ahh thank you so much!
---
I use ruin on Hill Billy so I can dick around and actually get good points and pip. If I end the game too soon then I get shit points and down pip.
---
thanks! i actually used a reference tho haha
---
happy cake day, but you still get my downvote
---
My main man otz I love that man no homo
---
So... dead hard?
---
Probably from messing around with the icons? Never seen this before.
---
I don't really care much for the artstyle, but I still respect the time and energy you put into them.
---
Yeah, and he got his ass shitcanned from the game. Not the best example.
---
I feel you, I'm currently rank 1 but the rest of my friends, with similar (500) and even more hours than me (one of them has 2k) are all yellow ranks because of the regular rank resets and them not playing for a while, and the pipping system is too slow to push them quickly where they should be. And then killers will (understandably) accuse me of smurfing, but actually we're all not where we should be (I never would have gotten to red ranks in solo queue, my skill level is more purple rank). Matchmaking just needs to take into account devotion or hours played for at least some improvement
---
I'm pretty sure a dev said the change to humming was intentional but hadn't been included in the patch notes.
---
Depends how good the survivors are. Tunneling isn't as effective as you may think.
---
It’s got to be The Spirit for me. I think it’s pretty cool how her father was going to be chosen by the entity to become a killer but Rin had so much rage that she was the better pick. She’s just a good girl that’s super pissed off..
---
Better chainsaw movment for sure.
---
Yeah... I found another one again too btw, thost just promise a game with DCs instead of sacrifices
---
Playing around your opponents perks is maybe a third of this game’s meta. Killers have to play mostly reactionary to survivors. Perks like Balanced Landing, Dead Hard, DS, flashlights, toolboxes, certain map designs, perks like Lithe or Borrowed Time and Adrenaline are all very commonly used perks that the killer cannot simply glaze over if they want to be successful. 
---
In turn, you as a player have to assume a killer is running their best perks too and bbq is very commonly used for the double BP but the aura reading is nice and like I said, it has built in counters. The fact that you don’t want to itemize against it or utilize the in game mechanics to stop it is not something I can convince you to do. 
---
Not to be rude but you don’t want to spend 4 seconds to be in a locker or take one perk to hard counter it is you being lazy. Plain and simple.
---
I dont know if the current meta is to hate on truetalent rn, but he is an excellent voice to the community imho
---
yeah, they are shit at knowing how to stop it
---
Yep, the dev was Peanits. He confirmed in Umbra's discord that the change was intentional.
---
Update: I got destroyed!
---
10 years anniversary I belive
---
Edge and the small tugboat are the two places I think I've ever found it.
---
any time
---
He probably thought that she was heading to the other gate, went to check the light from as far as he could, and quickly turned back to the other gate. Just not quickly enough.
---
The main problem with your response is that you are assuming that the others are doing gens.   At most, 1 person is on a gen while 1 is jerking themselves off in a corner, with the last guy crouched in a bush 3m away from the hooked guy.
---
Tbf, rank 1 SWF aren't fun to face as any killer...

---
Welcome to the whiny subreddit everyone when kids cry and rain you with the downvote. your opinion doesn't matter here.  CHANGE MY MIND DOGS
---
On Xbox playing killer has been taking an average of around three minutes to find a match. Survivor is really fast, but the devs continue to offer no real reason to play survivor over killer, so we're all just sitting in killer lobbies waiting for the few survivors to make their way around.
---
I know a quentin main
---
we know he's getting reworked. his rework was kinda shown at the anniversary stream a while ago, we'll get his "gameplay reveal" in a few days
---
That would explain why I’m getting wrecked these last few games. Hopefully I see some better matchmaking next time.
---
Devour ass as a perk would be broken as is. How about we fix totem placements? or have it that  the totems are in "mini shrines" containers that survivors have to break to get to the totem? At least the killer can look at the damaged shrine and see that his totem is being broken
---
Bond is the best
---
I kinda get to have fun against people like this. 
---
I used to play the absolute shit out of DbD and have prestiged most killers before clown to 3 (+Spirit) and stayed around r1 etc. Thing is, I dont really play much anymore so every time I do actually get on the rank reset has usually hit me back to r18 or so. Then when I see a twitch url in my game I look them up and size up their party. It's some of the most enjoyable stuff when they start out toxic and trying to force broken loops just to upset low level killers because the second you hit them through a couple of pallets or they realize what kind of build I'm running the teabags stop and the immersion begins.
---
Then it's either salt or silence post game. That or they try to claim some moral high ground, like they weren't there to show off and bully some low rank killer to their 8 viewers.
---
I hope that The Wraith appears and disappears in a flurry of birds.
---
Interesting, did they say why?
---
All the recent killers have some cool backgrounds but I always fall for Myers because is the start of his theme (Halloween) .
---
I don't get why they do this :( Like some "very rare" outfits are available for shards and some are only auric cells.
---
He is still right, there's only one gamemode, so what am I going to do? Not play with my friend/gf who just happens to be a lot worse than me?
---
There ate obviously people abusing the system, denying that would be stupid. But there are also honest SWF's trying to play a normal game of DbD, denying that wouöd be jut as stupid
---
As haunting as it is its very creative.
---
Tunneling doesnt work on good survivors as the survivor will have borrowed time and find the most toxic loop in the game and loop you while 2 gens pop like that
---
lmao don't worry this whiny subbreddit full of people who just bought the game and got 1 tbag from "SWF" with his 10 h ingame and express his opinion aggressively here

---
Because they didn't want pig to be op with endgame.
---
Pig op.
---
Another one!
---
they did have jason in mortal kombat x so maybe. but alien xenomorph would be the hottest choice. we need more monsters and less of the same humanoid look-alikes like legion and ghostface. any monsters would be great, like pumpkinhead i think its name was
---
By chance, is that supposed to be that pink purse monster from Power Rangers Zeo?
---
Lullabies are no longer directional, that's huntress right? That sounds terrible
---
Having people run an engineer's toolbox and prove thyself has zero counterplay as any killer other than Nurse, Spirit and billy. Even billy struggles on some map tiles. and that is assuming you have discordance. Genrushing exists and being an M1 warrior isn't really very "game" like
---
Rip piggy
---
 there is nothing wrong with playing SWF. solo is boring for me. I like to enjoy playing the game with my friend if we did destroy you or not I'll make sure to tbag at the exit gate and call you baby killer at post chat.
---
Seeing other streamers shit talk in post game always makes me sad. It furthers a negative stereotype around streamers of the game and I wish I didn't have to see it as much as I do.
---
They didn’t fix the chase music... still... wtf
---
So they didn't fix the most important issue? Wow
---
When are they going to fix the trap pick up animation?
---
Remake jason is another license , so they can go for the 2009 one
---
I never get my rank low but I am good enough that I can toy with killers. Most of the time if I'm in a SWF, I let my teammates do the trolling and I focus on gens and saving them haha
---
Well , you look after an obssesion but the problem is that all 4 of the survivor can have DS and only one of them is shown as obssesion . Also , they don't wiggle the first 3 secs when you pick them up .
---
Killers don't bring moris because they are bored. They bring moris to stop survivors from being toxic as usual. There's no "otherside of the spectrum" when it comes to bringing a mori.
---
Explains why my Xbox suddenly started downloading 6GB out of nowhere.
---
Buffing an already top tier killer. 
---
BHVR pls.
---
Does anyone know if this fixed "Error cant update rank" bug on survivor ?
---
[Probably this.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/560390/#Comment_560390)
---
Hybridpanda is good
---
Okay... these “camping” and “tunneling” rules are kind of dumb. Yes, face camping is just toxic but also a quick way for the killer to lose so I guess that works out. Tunneling though. I’m sorry. If I see someone got unhooked, go back to the area, and only the brain dead injured one left scratches because they took off running while the uninjured walked away, not leaving a clue to where they went, then yeah, I’m going to “tunnel” the guy that didn’t use a good strategy. 
---
Now if your team is body blocking for you and I get a hit off, I will go for them. If they body block and I don’t get a hit off, I am going to go for the injured one. Get DS and learn counterplays. It’s just annoying the whine about these made up rules when the game literally makes perks and add ons to counter them all.
---
I honestly don’t understand all the downvotes. But whatever.
---
Until they sort out the Friday the 13th franchise nothing will be getting added, no films, no books, no game updates.
---
It's a shame.
---
BRUH
---
I started playing like a week ago. 20 h in game. Tried killer and the first 3 times were so horrible. Like oh god. People couldn't stop being mean to me. They even teabagged me at the exit. XD then I tried survivors but I'm still not good at escaping the killer so people get mad cuz I 'don't do anything'. Also I play alone so I learn slow on my own mistakes. Anyone got a tip for me how to play better?
---
I saved up 26 thousand+ shards for an auric only skin. That’s a fat pog. I’m still gonna buy it because I’m a clown and love Feng Min
---
THERE WAS ONE GUY ON A GEN, ONE GUY HOOKED, ONE GUY BEING CHASED BY THE HUNTRESS NEAR THE HOOK.
---
I WANTED TO SAVE, BUT THEY WERE TOO CLOSE, SO I SIMPLY TOOK THE AGGRO AND LURED THE HUNTRESS AWAY. AFTER QUITE A WHILE I GOT DOWNED AND I NOTICED THE GUY I TOOK THE AGGRO OFF SELFCARING IN THE OPPOSITE CORNER OF THE MAP. THE HOOKED GUY DIED.
---
Sometimes camping is justified, if you are going against a very altruistic team who just hook dive as soon as you leave I stay a bit, no one is one a gen, they are all wasting their own time.
---
We also have different definitions of tunneling. Tunneling for me is going for someone just for the sake of killing time, like streamers. If I see someone who I recently hooked injured and someone who is healthy, OFC I'm gonna go for the one injured, it is an easy down and an easy hook. And I really don't care if I look like an ass, in order to win as consistently as possible you have to exploits other players mistakes. OFC I could play "fair" but why would I do that if I am trying to win.
---
Never said there was anything wrong with SWF? Also, you don’t know my stream name or PSN handle.. so good luck?
---
The only reason i play with my low rank friends is to play with them, not to bully low rank killers it’s just because i wanna play with my friends
---
Lullaby no longer directional what's that mean?
---
&gt; Thats the wrong way to go about it.
---
It's the way community play this game. Every time there was an event with "secondary" objectives, all people cared about were those things. If I can get 20k+ BPs in 3 minutes from flowers why would I care about 15k in next 10+ minutes of normal play? Ranking up? I'd say less and less players care about their ranks. Especially when red ranks are a synonym of unfun games.
---
&gt; if they keep it as is. Not many people will stick around.
---
I can't see this looking at steamdb charts. "Game will be dead in 6 months" - I read this here as soon as I joined reddit almost 2 years ago.
---
&gt; But even they admit that if they weren't making content of killers in red ranks they wouldn't play killer and would rather play on their alternate accounts.
---
Give them insta-queues, and I bet they'll reconsider.
---
&gt; "I believe punishing players for DC-ing is not a good approach" and "Thats why DCs need to be punished hard."
---
That doesn't compute for me.
---
On the question of perks - as I said, dropping tiers is a way to go, I agree. But perk diversity is a myth. Most players rarely change their builds.
---
You seem like a reasonable guy. Why did I get so many downvotes?
---
I got this game in the Halloween sale when Michael came out? I believe 2017? And I just started playing killer matches as the hag because I found her fun to play and jumpscaring survivors was also fun, once I got to like killer rank 16 I kept getting matched against sweaty try hard people using full meta loadouts at the time (borrowed time, decisive, sprint burst and I can’t remember the other one) and the hag is pretty slow and stunning her renders her practically blind so you can imagine the frustration,
---
I would hook a survivor, place my traps, walk off, the trap immediately activated, I went after whoever set it off, and every single time I did I was accused of camping, reported and all that toxic stuff to the point that my Xbox profile had a “Avoid Me” printed on it when all I had done was play the game to the best I could. I would down a survivor then blinded instantly and forced to drop them, I would hook a survivor and before I could leave proximity they unhooked them, prompting them to call me a camper when I physically couldn’t get far away enough. so I just gave up and stoped playing for 3 months because it was just too much to deal with, and that’s how I became a survivor main for a year, only touching killer for rituals, and I still despise the hag to this day just because of those toxic survivors and I’ve just learnt to never be like them because I know how it feels to be a killer against them
---
Most games against good survivors they leave the person on hook and leave. It’s a cop out and a free kill card
---
Oh bummer. Too bad.
---
I get singled out by killers a lot for being a Claudette. So whenever I play killer, I always make sure I let the the Claudette get the hatch or win.
---
I dont think support deals with such kind of things. 99% things in other online games that people deem reportable or bannable are in fact not. So yeah, no, i dont think that anyone is banned for this unless you can prove me wrong?
---
Whoa beautiful
---
Well thats good, becuse nobody wants it.
---
Yeah sadly I've had some of them too but I've been lucky.
---
*looks who’s shitting in the tall grass*
---
August
---
Yes Orlando too! Been considering cosplaying Meg or  Nea for a whileee
---
Super lucky. Wish console had something like that.
---
am i the only one who camps and or tunnels more to embrace the salt? im collecting comments on my steam profile xD
---
You sure? Why did you DM me asking for it?
---
Thanks dude
---
Which one?
---
Why? lol
---
Yeah true sometimes people do think they do it to be toxic but sometimes it's just to either play with a friend or to help a higher rank learn to play.
---
This is art.

The one where in random games you won't be able to wiggle, heal, Dead Hard, etc.
---
I use to genuinely enjoy sitting in a majority of the DbD streamers streams til lately.  Lately? I've noticed a majority of them (not all. There's some good ones out there. Even in the Fog Whisperers. Cahla, StreamDad, etc.)  are sooooooo negative and just bitchy and whiny about EVERYTHING. Not just the game, but literally everything. 
---
I have to turn them off or switch to watch something else very quickly, because there's only so often that you can have a streamer engaging with their chat and their chat is trying to get some positivity out of them and you only get ''Yeah that sucks." 
---
And again it's not even about DbD. I legit watched a streamer the other day straight up have a negative opinion about every movie and TV show that his chat brought up.  
---
And at that point? There's probably something deeper and more wrong with you if you can't find enjoyment in MOST or ANYTHING. That's no longer just your opinions. That's a deeper rooted problem.
---
Yeah I noticed that too in footage of the mori a long time ago. I think it was changed to fix that weird issue where you hear the squirting and see blood spraying out while nothing is going on. I thought it was cool though. 
---
It'd cut to awake, then asleep again when it shows Freddy readying his claw, and then awake, and finally back to sleep when Freddy actually stabs the survivor. Was a neat touch.
---
No fix to the can’t recover/can’t wiggle/can’t exit bug? Yikes. It has been a significant issue.
---
I've only got 30 hours into this game. Rank 14 killer. And I'm always getting shit on by survivors because apparently dont know the unwritten play nice bullshit rules. Somehow I was playing as Hag and got accused of "camping" even though I was patrolling 4 gens and using my traps to teleport when triggered. How is a new player supposed to know that using some perks is "bad manners" ? How am I supposed to know that if I hook someone and someone comes to unhook them that I shouldn't hit the one who was just unhooked?
---
You should keep practicing. I love TCM and that's why I main bubba. I had a hard time learning but never gave up, and now I main him at red ranks.
---
Look at me, I have a youtube channel! Intrigued yet? Look for it!
---
New bug: when ECG is active and someone is hooked, you will get the normal timer and not the grey one...
---
They know which one will be more popular, and go for money
---
Honestly don't see how that's possible. It's so easy to rank up with survivor, even with bad teammates.  
---
Make a few saves, do a few gens, have a couple of chases.  
---
I play either solo or with a friend of mine who's pretty bad, and without even trying or wanting to, I end up at rank 6-5 every month.
---
Still think they should remove AngryPug from the Charity Case. Jendanise too probably.
---
I know when I've been playing dbd recently I get annoyed at everything and I think it's jsut because of how much the game fucks you with bugs, ping issues, queues and broken af balance
---
Good luck finding it without the name of it or any hints as to what it could be.
---
TO THE PEOPLE WHO DOUBTED ID GET A 4K AT ONE GEN LEFT AS PIG ON STRODE...FUCK YOU!! I GOT YOU TEABAGGING CUCKS AND TOOK YOU TO HELL OINK OINK DICKBAGS
---
Let me just throw this out there....
---
Hooking someone, then going to check the nearest gen, then heading back to see if anyone is going for the save is not camping. That’s just using common sense. 
---
If you get unhooked and take off running in the opposite direction of the person who unhooked you, while they are being stealthy, then get chased because you left an obvious trail, you can’t call that “tunneling.” 
---
You can’t always blame killers for your poor choices.
---
If the survivors are still within range of the hooked survivor, wouldn't call that camping.
---
It's only when the killer decides to just STAND there waiting for people to come instead of hunting their prey is when it's camping. I can understand being near the hook if both gates are open because you're NOT gonna get anyone else unless they are exposed/can one-hit like Leatherface or Billy.
---
When killers are just being lazy and FISHING for shit by the hook...it's shitty. If you see people...scratchmarks, hear them breathing?....by all means...kill-em.
---
Every time a meme like this there's always someone like you saying it in reverse because of how butthurt you are.
---
Before the enduring nerf the rework felt fair. Now the stun is either too long or the duration needs to be 45 seconds.
---
Playing as ?
---
Yo, what's with the downvotes on this guy? What did he say that was wrong to any of you? Or is it because this sub believes all twitch streamers are bad? If so, you're just watching the wrong streamers then.
---
I guess it's harder to fix, since this bug doesn't happen very often.
---
What rank are you playing at?
---
If Bing Bong boy became a scarecrow, how should he kiss Nurse with that face?😔
---
I already have bond and empathy so I guess it's a killer kinda week
---
High rank killer queues on PC are almost never less than 5 minutes.
---
Hey this is nice.
---
This guy gets it. All the downvotes are because they assumed “Uncontroversial Tweet” was also my stream name, and that by my post alone I was self promoting my channel. Suckers.
---
No shit just pointing out the obv that everyone else is too much of a bitch to admit.

aaaah I see, you are the type to lie about things to make yourself look better. Good luck in life.

Hysterical, you definitely seem like a successful twitch streamer.
---
Who TELLS people this!?
---
So you play like a cunt because they're streaming? You're contributing to this toxic shit of a community.
---
One day, I hope to be as successful as my hero Jake Paul.
---
You sound like someone who's never played Nurse. Play her a few times and you'll figure out the tactics, advantages, disadvantages, etc...
---
She looks down every time after a failed blink or after her set of blinks. It's not exactly easy playing her.
---
If you are looking to win, buy spirit, she is the bets killer of the three and she also comes with one of the better perks in the game, Spirit Fury. As someone who has played all of them I find Legion the most enjoyable to play, then spirit and last Plague. I don't think any of the killer are bad, and they all come with good/decent perks.
---
Congratulations on this cosmetic getting into the game! 😃
---
Spirit is both fun, and really good, plague is fun but can struggle a small bit at high ranks, legion is just meh
---
Yep. I mean, if unhooking wasn't super fast and easy to get iframes off of, there might be less incentive to...
---
Shit.
---
Does no one in here understand comedy? Or is everyone just so mad that they downvoted a post for no reason, so they’re doubling down. Haha.
---
Effective in what sense? They’re all effective at different things. 
---
If you’re wanting it purely based on ability: 
---
Spirit is arguably the second best Killer in the game. She’s a force to be reckoned with when you’ve learned her. 
---
Plague is very mid tier. She’s good but not great, and still can get looped heavily if survivors choose not to cleanse. 
---
Legion is mid/low tier. Great at getting first hits, but is nothing other than a M1 Killer after that point.
---
I guess I don't kill more than 1 with a mori if I have one.
---
I posted the comment, I went to load-out to check if Diversion 3 is the only perk I need and when I came back to the Bloodweb, it has reset and gave me a totally different bloodweb
---
MY FUCKING COMPUTER DIED AND MY GOD DAMN LAPTOP WON'T RUN DBD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF NOW WITHOUT DBD. THE OLD SHIT I PLAYED SUCKS AFTER 100+ HOURS OF DBD. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!
---
The people who do this are usually really toxic and have a god complex but then they DC when they get downed smh
---
As a Twitch streamer I always point out to these people how awful they are and that I wouldn't come to their channel because of this.
---
This whole sub is like 90% killer circlejerk most of the time up to and including never admitting anything a killer does could be considered BM.

the 'Hey, I got a channel, but I'm not gonna post it' was a completely irrelevant detail that you could have avoided. The (insert shameless plug here) and the stuff you wrote right after is completely useless to the discussion. 
---
And, what, admit defeat? Of course! I'm not touching that post history ever again.
---
I didn't get a chance to try to claim it, did you?
---
FUCK THE 3 PEOPLE I PLAYED WITH YESTERDAY ON X1. I DID 3 GENS WHILE ALL 3 OF YOU IDIOTS JUST HID IN LOCKERS. THEN WHEN I GET HOOKED 2 OF YOU RUN STRAIGHT TO THE HOOK 1 SECOND AFTER AND THE KILLER DOWNS BOTH OF YOU. I SPECTATE THE THIRD IDIOT AND THEY SOMEHOW WIN.
---
GIVE EM HELL YOU DUMPSTER FIRE!
---
Do you understand why that might make the person you hooked 3 times in a row upset?
---
I remember one time I was huntress on mount ormond, I changed my name to "no killing dwight"
---
I spot a kate right of the bat, down her and hook her. Then I went to the nearest locker I could find, opened it to reload hatches, but instead found a dwight.
---
I tried to drop the Dwight, but my character kept swying left and right
---
Dwight dc'ed

Thx all think am gonna go with spirit
---
You literally spend 10 minutes looking through my post history so you could find something leading to my channel so you could use it as a “Gotchya! You were self promoting!” But you found nothing. So now it’s not that I was self promoting like you hoped, it’s just that I didn’t contribute. I wasted 10 minutes of an assholes life, so the post, albeit it “useless to the discussion,” was worth it.
---
https://youtu.be/ixWybGQnPHQ
---
Nah, I just play using common sense. 
---
Ex. I go to a gen to check it. Three people on it. I start chase, down one, hook him. Proceed to go back to said gen to damage it. Now what am I supposed to do? Go to the other side of the map where I know no survivors are since I just saw 3/4 of the team in my current area?   This whole game is based off of predicting what the other person is going to do and make a strategy for it. That goes for both sides. That’s why these “rules” just don’t make any sense to me. I mean it’s very obvious when a killer is focusing one survivor and one survivor only, which is toxic and leads to them losing anyways so who cares? But to call what I stated in my previous reply “camping” and “tunneling” is just dumb.
---
Once  I got picked up but I couldn't wiggle and it didn't show up either I think it's a bug
---
I just ASSUMED it was about facing and looked to the side.
---
...wait, how old is this thread who uses flashlights? I haven't seen one since coming back this year.
---
IF YOU T BAG ME ON THE FIRST PALLET I WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE MISERABLE
---
Under certain circumstances I let one survivor live. Because one always survives to come back in the sequel
---
This...is not the r/deadbydaylight I know. And that's a good thing.
---
I remember I encountered a Twitch streamer who specifically went out of his way to face camp on Fridays. He would title it, "Face camp Fridays | Hope i don't get reported for camping..." and would literally do nothing **BUT** that.  
---
I went back to his Stream later that day to see what he was doing and he had changed his title to, "Rank 1 Killer bullying rank 15 survivors."
---
***s a d***
---
Meg/Claudette: *begins to slowly crouch walk across the map to my hook only to get there right when I die on my first hook*
---
Like I'm not so much upset that you didn't save me, I'm more upset that you wasted all that time doing nothing at all to try and save me and fail at it. I'd be happier if you spent that time doing ~2 gens.
---
you can also jump over the hole in Springwood if you hit whilst walking sideways
---
I always say "Okay". The 'ay' part is important despite the fact that its not needed to say Ok.
---
It'd help if they lowered Killer pip requirements so just casually getting a lot of hits was acceptable, instead of obsessing over sacrifices. I HATED DbD back when I felt like it was sacrifice or nothing (with me being mocked on top of everything; and I just didn't find Survivor fun to be), although that was back around Nurse launch when Survivors were even stronger.
---
This photo inspired me to make my first post in this forum involving Dwight. Very cute photo, OP.
---
Dude I'm sorry, but I have no clue how people can watch an AngryPug stream. In between ragequitting, name calling and literally throwing his games I find it so hard to enjoy any of his content. But if that's your thing.
---
Can you imagine Double Killer, though?
---
english is my second language so i try to not make grammar error but is hard sometimes but thanks bro
---
If you even get past the loading screen.
---
I got accused  of streamsniping this swf that I was destroying. post game chat they got mad about noed too (gens were never completed and I dont have a lot of levels on hillbilly) I only m2'ed. I didn't streamsnipe, and they got upset about a perk I didn't use.
---
I was watching someone play the other day and they combined Head On with Quick &amp; Quiet. Tried it out and can confirm it usually works really well. A lot of time the killer blows right by the locker because they're confused and Head On has time to activate.
---
Super fun meme build, FWIW
---
are you sure you don't need the dog bust 
---
are u sure
---
Link?
---
MY KEYBREAD IS BORKEN
---
Im a killer main. Its triggering when you get called a camper when you hook someone when the exit gates are opened or about to be opened and you see on BBQ that they are running back. If you arn't going for the save why would you not leave, by not leaving you make the killer think you're going to save them. But nah you gotta make sure you can teabag the killer so you dont leave.
---
Or let him go into the circle in the temple of puragation
---
The Preschool is supposed to be reworked with the Freddy rework but the next totally new map should come in the next chapter. Since we have gotten one every 3 months and we just got Ghostface I would assume we are expecting one in mid to late September
---
Bro, I'm rank 9 and the highest ranked person in our group is 12. We still get rank 20/19 killers. Game has crappy matchmaking.
---
He used to dc whenever he had a game against zubatlel LUL it was always kinda funny, but thinking back it's actually pretty shitty thinking. Saying shit like "ugh this guy is just a try hard I don't like playing against him" would set up a bar example for his fans
---
That sucks man.
---
Anytime anyone admits they're new, especially to killer, I think it should be a big flag to everyone to chill the fuck out and take it easy on them in chat. I usually try to offer something positive after a tough match and maybe give them some advice.
---
But some people are just toxic assholes that will never change. Nothing we can do about them. Sorry you had that experience though.
---
struggle phase on the hook, claudette hiding behind a barrel 10m away from u while the obsession is clearly being chased from the claw wiggles smh
---
Wrong
---
And they keep kicking Ghostface when he’s down. He’s already not viable, but this is ridiculous that they keep nerfing him, even when he’s in a bad spot.
---
If you have to ask "does it make me a bad person?", then you likely are feeling really guilty and already know the answer.
---
With the next chapter which will be released in about early September.
---
First of all this is an asymmetrical game. The game was designed for the killer to have the upper hand. And she isnt op, ive seen plenty of games where a very skilled nurse is out witted by survivors who know how to play against her. That would lead me to believe that she is not over powered.
---
Yep its been on there twice since mid 2017.
---
2018 it never appeared.
---
Meh, I watched OhTofu the other night and he was pretty positive and lighthearted.
---
Awww that's so sweet!!one day  one day I'll make it to Canada.
---
I feel you brother. Such potential in Friday squandered. The next time I have to chase some asshole counselor off the roof I think I’m gonna break the damn disk in half.
---
😂 yea!
---
But...but...what about survivor FUN(tm)?
---
If a Survivor is unhooked 15 feet away from you and the healthy one Sprint Bursts away while the injured one runs in a straight line away from all the pallets, I'll go for the injured one. It's really that simple.
---
Give me a reason not to tunnel or else I'm going to go for the easier kill. Can you imagine if, in real life, hunters went after a deer sprinting away at 10 km/h instead of an injured deer with a broken leg and a limp?
---
That +chill non trying to be scary but coming off as annoying music would be hella good.
---
Ive said it before and ill say it again, ive played and watched countless games of survivors outplaying a very good nurse. Did all 4 make it out, no. But ive seen plenty of ganes where 2 did countless where 1 did whether by hatch or the main exits it doesnt matter. She is very powerful but not unbeatable
---
It happens much more often in the worst ranks, so... Rank up it's the only thing you can do about it, kind of. But that person was right, face camp is part of the game, I mean... It's not bannable
---
Let’s see if the butcher him like they butchered Legion xD. I want him too be better but he’s probably going too be even worse then before.
---
Freddy's rework is ready to be launched within 2, maybe 3 months.
---
Nurse isn't broken. I see players use her, "I think, this is it?" I watch Nurse mains use her, I'm underwhelmed. She's the best killer absolutely, but survivors need to adapt to playing vs Nurse instead of saying "Shit, we can't loop, guess we lose."
---
Spirit collision is there because it would be buggy as fuck if Spirit ended her Haunting while a survivor was in her. Also, she was hot fucking trash on PTB. ALSO ALSO, she is mind gameable. People think it's impossible to juke a Spirit just standing still, then break LOS.
---
Billy instasaw really isn't instant. If it catches you out, than you were dead already. If you weren't close enough to a pallet or window, a second or 2 wasn't going to change the fact that you got sawed.
---
Legion's addons being buggy do suck but the real issue is that the killer stuns themselves for 4 seconds everytime they use a worthless power that doesn't pose any threat. DS is 5 seconds. Legion basically uses DS on themselves everytime the power ends.
---
Map reworks won't really buff killers unless looping is worthless. Killers aren't nearly fast enough to actually catch a survivor before the gens pop. Gens either need to take longer, or killers need to become slightly faster.
---
Nerfing killer addons is just dumb. Trapper can't prevent traps from being disarmed, so why would you nerf the only counter to something so easy and so harmful to his gameplay as disarming? Also, Iri heads play the same as regular hatchets. Dodge them. If you complain about Iri Head, chances are, you're just mad you can't rely on Dead Hard to dodge her hatchets. If you want to nerf killer addons, then make games consume survivor addons every game, instead of only when they die. Then get back to me.
---
NOED is for 2 things:
---
Killers who don't have Ruin.
---
Killers who do have Bloodwarden.
---
Basically, it's either a part of an Endgame build, or it's there because killers need a way to actually be able to play the game before survivors instantly leave. A totem counter would make NOED useless. People would always cleanse totems before it even went off. This isn't really an issue, since that's a viable counter, but it takes basically no time to cleanse totems especially when they sit out in the open, unhidden. Fix totem hiding places before adding a counter because the aspect of totems is the MOST RNG bullshit ever. You either have the best hiding spot that literally is invisible, or you have a totem sitting on a hill in the center of the map with a beacon shining down on it.
---
They should just go all the way and make this a saviour perk. It should allow you to get stacks for blocking a hit, flashlight/pallet/head-on saves, and sabo saves, and helping survivors wiggle out. It would make the perk a lot more useful for risky plays that actually help your teammate. Seeing how all those things can be avoided, it wouldn't even be op.
---
It's part of the game for killers that don't actually want to play the game lol.
---
10 minutes to half an hour.
---
I will always let the unhooked survivor go if I come across them and another survivor. Unless they have been playing toxic.
---
I am proud to admit that I only ever play survivrler as Dwight
---
I'll give you the point, ok? You didn't self-promote, but you did nothing to contribute to the discussion. And yeah, good luck wasting those 10 minutes elsewhere, you didn't do jack shit. I'm downloading something and my bandwidth isn't good enough to play other stuff.
---
God, r/The_Donald shitposters remind me of Chenposters. 
---
&gt;Hide chen threads. Ignore chen posts. Do not reply to chenposters.
---
YOU GAIN NOTHING FROM MESSAGING SOMEONE HATE. MY YOUNGER SISTER WAS PLAYING AND AFTER SHE HOOKED SOMEONE IN A SWF THE OTHER ESCAPED AND THEY BOTH MESSAGED HER CALLING HER TRASH. WHAT DO YOU GAIN. DONT MESSAGE SOMEONE AND TRASH ON THEM IF THEYRE JUST DOING WHAT THEYRE SUPPOSED TO DO. GOSH.
---
To clarify: this isn't me being "Oh, I'm much superior to other new players" or anything, it's more joking about how the killer when I play survivor doesn't really seem to be... there that much. Usually, I never see anyone (but myself) actually die to a killer, and sometimes people don't even get downed. Many matches I just run gens and don't even SEE the killer until the gate's open. A very strange experience, especially when searching stuff about new players giving people with apparently the opposite experience.
---
I agree. I made a post on this sub shaming Pug awhile back and it got locked because of his toxic fanbase flaming people in the comments.
---
Actually it wasn't even Pug's fans. It was Jendanise's fans. Shoutout to the guy who said that Jendanise was "faking" her toxicity, and then told the people downvoting him to ["show some goddamn respect you goddamn worthless sacks of human semen."](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i-8tZIvepVs/maxresdefault.jpg)
---
Like I've seen memes about white knights defending Twitch eGirls but that was really an eye opener lol. You don't need to defend someone for playing video games lmfao.
---
He hasn't lately. From what I can tell he's trying to be a good boy now.
---
Its been there twice this year atleast.
---
So true! I take the long-route with GF to make the Wazzuupp more effective
---
I’m going to go ahead and give you the benefit of the doubt and assume English isn’t your first language. Because you’re making no sense.
---
true, will try to do that later on but idk if anyone would like to watch someone just being normal on yt xd thx tho for your comment
---
If someone DC's early on I let the last survivor get the hatch.  A 3 man never had a chance against me, it's bullshit for them.
---
I always thought ghostface should be able to disguise as a survivor; since the killers hide in plain site in the movies but that’d be way too much of an advantage. But 2 killers would be cool
---
Oh, yeah that shit is wild to me. I’m even a survivor main and the way other survivors expect killers to play blows my mind. Once the gates are open, that’s pretty much game over for the killer. So if they get a last minute hook, I would think they were playing dumb to leave their one chance at a kill. I usually go for the save but I am aware that it is a risk and I have no one else to blame but myself if I die. Sorry bad survivors flame you afterwards.
---
The cooldown is still in the game, must just be a bug for the text. Or a rework that they weren't supposed to announce yet, but my money is on bug
---
They know for sure that Feng players like to dress her up and will shell out the money sooner or later.  Wraith is a weak killer and a killer skin in general is less sought after because you can't see it yourself anyway so you are basically just getting it for sw@g points on survivors you play against so it makes sense they would offer a free alternative if you're willing to grind like 100 levels to earn it.
---
Yea I do but then they need to complain to the developers. If I can't find the one that unhooked them but can easily find them because I can see the blood trail that is a game mechanic I shouldn't go after them because it's frustrating for them?
---
X Gon' Give it to Ya.
---
You're really not.
---
Why is every comment that isn't sucking her dick downvoted to hell? Comments that aren't insulting her, even. Y'all are *thirsty AF*. I'm pretty sure she's not going to send y'all nudes for your upvotes.
---
This. As much as the ranking system sucks I can never defend deranking as Survivor. As Killer I understand since the Killer skill set is vastly different and if you want to learn a new Killer and not get stomped you can get to a lower rank to enjoy the game more. But as Survivor the skillset is literally always the exact same so there's no skill gap excuse.
---
I'm at Rank 4 currently and I fucking hate it but I still don't derank, because I'd rather have a meh experience as Survivor then ruin the experience for other Killers.
---
My mom begs to differ.
---
I got kicked out of the game with EAC error
---
LOL my poor confused Nea is just like..
---
"Oooo..k?"
---
Actually 99% of the time the case nowadays, but reddit likes bitching about things that aren't an issue. Complaining about bullying is more convenient than learning to play killer to a decent level.
---
Thanks!
---
I don’t understand why people are downvoting this post?
---
I just do it if I'm in the middle of a chase, then I'm too blind to find where they crawled to.
---
Of course, I always assume someone will be unhooked, so it's functionally no different. I'll get 'em when I get 'em, if I get 'em.
---
I hate them both but don't shit on the charity case.  That's a legit thing.  Profits go to [The Brain and Behavior Research Foundation](https://www.bbrfoundation.org/).
---
Kindred + Open-Handed
---
We’ll Make It + Empathy
---
I also think Small Game On it’s own is pretty underused, though I love using it time to time.
---
LAST SUNDAY (LAST TIME I PLAYED) I WAS PLAYING KILLER AND LITERALLY GOT AT LEAST 2 RED RANKS IN ABOUT 70% OF THE MATCHES. I WAS RANK 12 AT THE TIME.  
---
IF NONE OF THE SURVIVORS WERE  RED RANKS, THEN:
---
A. I WOULD GET 4 IMMERSIVE SURVIVORS
---
B. SURVIVORS WITH 1000+ HOURS PLAYTIME THAN ME THAT WERE A SWF
---
ALL THIS AFTER 5 MINUTES QUEUES.
---
NEXT TIME I GET 4 IMMERSIVE SURVIVORS I SWEAR I WILL RUN THE MOST FACECAMPING BUILD I CAN THINK OF.
---
Thanks! Have they said when the rework is coming?
---
We'll make it and We're gonna live forever
---
Or literally any altruistic perk+ We're gonna live forever to give it some purpose outside of BP farming.
---
Neither do I. I prefer the angry comments though, I can respond to those.
---
I'll have some of those cherries you're picking please.
---
Jeez. The fucking complexities these people have.
---
Bloody tits my fav
---
I just started actually playing dbd and I'm away from home for now. What do these perks do?
---
The world may never know 🤷‍♂️
---
If a survivor intentionally leads me to one of their teammates with the hope that will get the aggro off them, I'll completely ignore it. Don't be THAT guy. 
---
I only play David with No-Mither. Optional hard mode for the baddest rugby boi.
---
If I haven't run into or seen a particular survivor all match (because they're stealthy and immersive,) but end up seeing them after the other 3 are dead, I'll let them live.
---
Just make bad plays on purpose so the survivor can have fun.
---
Kate has a quest for you.
---
It's habbo all over again
---
nicely done
---
I think this is a bug after two last updates, never like this before.. It seems that if you don’t move the face cam after the bump it won’t happen, so I bet there is a bug that makes the camera go down because, billy can’t move while it happens...
---
Expect this to be a permanent change to billy, unless BHVR fks up something else and next time you bump you fall trough the map into an endless fall, and that’s it.........
---
Interestingly when that exploit worked to have multiple killers the game seemed surprisingly stable. I.E. you could have two different killers and their powers wouldn't crash the game like you could have Hag and Trapper and both of their abilities would work fine in the same match.
---
Maybe when dedicated servers come out a proper multi-killer mode (or even COOP Killer of some sort?) can be considered. Again it does seem like the game can handle 2 or more killers (Even if different killers) without throwing a fit so turning it into a proper feature shouldn't be too big of an undertaking besides balance issues with certain killer combos or perk build combos. (I.E. Pig with Hag or Trapper trapping all the jigsaw boxes etc.) Also, they'd have to have more survivors, more gens, and more exit gates so you can't just camp both gates and prevent people from leaving.
---
I'm on PS4 so the matchmaking is a bit weird.
---
This is the new entity, Billy has obtained the power to fly
---
Exactly.
---
My favorite is "goddamn killers always camping! We only got 1 gen!!!"
---
Your Wake up suggestion would break the game.  Way too powerful my dude.
---
Sure, but on the condition the BP penalty for being near hook is reduced. I'm not near hooks to camp; I'm returning sporadically to catch a rescue for some more hits, and IMO that just makes sense.
---
I play how I want to play. I paid for the game, I paid for all of the dlc I'm gonna do what I want with my money. You wanna blame me when a bunch of assholes wanna abuse noobs but then they come across me instead and I fuck their whole day up. But I'm the bad one huh? Lmfao get a life, get bent, fuck all the way off and find something to do with your life because if how people play the game upset you THAT much then you really really reaaaallly need mental help or find somethibg better to do with your time. There's more to life than a video game bub.
---
You dumb bitches over use the word toxic. Anything YOU don't like is deemed "toxic waaaaah" you've devalued the word and therefore has no meaning. 
---
There's no toxicity in the game. Just in the online community forums since you dumb kids want to cry 24/7 about everything and call every little thing "toxic." Lmfao.
---
You dumbfucks act like every small event that happens in the game is a full blown attack on your whole life.
---
Get help.
---
I see all kinds of bright neon vomit skins mixmatched on all the characters though.
---
Just that it is supposed to be during the mid chapter patch. So I'm guessing by the end of the month we should have news of when the PTB is, if it has not started yet.
---
I'm a rank 5 survivor, but I've encouraged 3 new players at this point to buy the game. It does feel terrible getting paired with rank 17 killers : /
---
I think it’s because most of them thought the post was in and of itself a very poor attempt to promote my channel. But they fail to realize my reddit name and stream name aren’t the same.
---
I hate vanilla myself.  Modded is where it's at.
---
I have Kindred and see this all the time. They'll be sneaking up to the hook super slow even though they know the killer isn't there.
---
Drives me crazy.
---
Spirit is jumpscare queen
---
You're getting downvoted, but you're absolutely right.
---
I've wondered too. I decided to main him, and have yet to see a reason to use perks that leave survivors exposed. I prefer perks that help with map pressure and chase, seeing as that's the thing the power doesnt cover too much.
---
 Buckle Up and Flip Flop don't really fit.
---
This begs the question; where does Huntress get her clothes from? She’s wearing an adult’s clothes and she was abandoned when she was a little girl.
---
Ive discovered other streamers than the usual basic top ones and their streams are really laid back and chill. It’s nice taking a break from the top streamers.
---
If they unhooked me, I will unhook them. Even if the exit gates are open. 
---
As killer I LET DWIGHT LIVE
---
I fucking hate Reddit. Not a single downvote here has a reason
---
So even though it’s not actually self promotion, they still downvote it. I’m rarely active on reddit, are these what people usually do on it?
---
Feng RARELY gets outfits lmao so they know people are going to pay for it with rl money, which is sad
---
True, matchmaking is broken in all plataforms I think
---
Technician would be meta with these changes, if the killer has ruin you can just fail skill checks and not lose any progression, effectively making ruin useless.
---
Hexy is a fucking asshole too
---
That's great to hear. And actually, the way you phrased it was interesting, because I suppose there could be FFA modes. Something like 8 Survivors and two COMPETING Killers, able to unhook and shoulder one another's sacrifices and stagger each other with melee.
---
But I guess you meant a single Killer designed to be played by two people, as I imagined Ghostface. Which would also be interesting, but would likely require developing bot AI for a single player to use.
---
That older player remark (much like your "no one's playing this game anymore" remark) is pulled from the deepest corners of your ass with nothing to back it up except your own shit talk. Hell, I saw several legacy skins just last night. 
---
With your bug comment...
---
*picks up goal posts, moves them down field* 
---
Hope you enjoy your bitch session. I'll be enjoying this game with literally thousands of other people.
---
Widely considered to be the best gers collapse aven movie.
---
Yes, I agree. In my mind the time on hook would only slow if the killer is standing for more than 10 seconds within a few meters of the survivor on hook and nobody is within say 25 meters.
---
I have a confession to make. I got a daily for the Wraith to hit 4 Survivors out of my cloak. And I haven't started leveling the Wraith, so I'm level 1. But I was at Rank 11, and.... And I facecamped the hooks while cloaked and tunneled them. Not just the Meg, but the Dwight, the David and Nea too. I tunneled them like a quantum particle. I hate me.
---
Huntress by a mile.  Probably the best written of the killers and certainly the saddest.
---
i 100% will wear Pink feng and YOU CANT STOP ME!!!!
---
Downvote now, ask questions later. Pretty much. Except when they get the questions answered, they’re so mad that they were wrong that they double down and downvote even harder, and more often. I think that sums up most redditors.
---
Source?
---
Man, Reddit seems so toxic.
---
Why thank you for the kind words. I think it was all a misunderstanding.
---
He only eats dog.
---
Oh, how the tables have turned, my friend!
---
Explains the camping then.
---
fuck youre obnoxious. youre perfect for twitch.
---
I just use it to troll now. And as you can see by my past 30 minutes, it’s super effective.
---
Why are survivors not told to behave a certain way, but people constantly hate on killers for not 'playing fair'?
---
people get so salty 😔
---
that what my channel all about
---
If you have to camp and tunnel to do anything in this game you lost man.  Learn the mechanics of the game and you can win without the babystrats.
---
I'm more talking about the community in general, just looking through the forums there's more than a few posts dissing the other side in a disrespectful way.
---
Plus with my experience I get a hate comment once every few hours, regardless of how I play.
---
What do you get for leveling up except shards? Nothing. What do you get when you are devotion? nothing. They have nothing to keep the older playerbase playing. Once you have everything after a long time you have no incentive to stay playing.
---
Sure, that sounds reasonable. I'll often kick a nearby gen or check a possibly in-use closet nearby, but I don't spend much time loitering, nor do I rely on the bleed-out, anyway.
---
I just assume I must hook every Survivor but the last 3 times each.
---
Some killers are sympathetic. Like when someone farms a survivor right in my face I will go for the unhooker. And bullying babies makes you feel bad

I like nurse but what happened to you at 17 seconds happens to me at like every obstacle
---
New cosmetics never need 6G updates.....it better be a decent update
---
Thanks. So does this mean you want my channel? Please, Lord, I’ve been trying so hard to self promote..
---
Not shitting on the charity case, and honestly I think it's nice that they offered their exclusive cosmetics to the bundle. But I also think they are incredibly toxic people and we'd be better off with some cosmetics for more friendly streamers like StreamDad.
---
I can agree with this. The only thing is I'm rank 10 and my friends rarely join me to play and they are rank 18 or 19 now and I'm not doing it to be an asshole I promise I just want to play with my friends ☹
---
Look at Monto, he never does stuff exaggerated. Even if he tries he could not hold how stupid it looks and laughs out.
---
Be genuine. Don't try to be someone else u r not, thats more hard than being yourself, I had a decent channel once. Telling you from experience.
---
Wow it's only 363 mbs for ps4
---
The thing is this isn't even like "toxic meme" bright neon vomit. This is just bright vomit that doesn't look good and clashes with Feng's existing cosmetics.
---
Metle of Man and WGLF.
---
It’s still ongoing. I’m just going to keep on fucking with them until they stop. It’s a slow day at work, so whatever.
---
Who did this 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Has remember me been fixed (making gates faster instead of slower)? It's not even in the known issues tab
---
fuck no, twitch is cancer
---
HOLY FUCKING SHIT. 
---
I JUST HAD *THREE* RANK 2 SURVIVORS RUNNING SELF CARE AND CONSTANTLY HEALING.....**AGAINST A SLOPPY BUTCHER/THANATOPHOBIA LEGION**. 
---
BRUH WUT IS THIS SHIT. ONE FUCKING GEN GOT DONE CAUSE THESE GUYS JUST KEPT HEALING IN THE CORNER.
---
Good luck with that man. I’m gonna watch YouTube and stuff, 👋
---
So I found a big bug in this patch. When ECG is active and someone is on the the hook, the timer isn't slowed down. Pretty good job BHVR.
---
"Oh no, the killer dude killed me, was there anything I could have done?" Apparently not, most toxic survivors never accept that maybe they made a mistake that got them killed, they always blame the killer for doing their job. You have perks, pallets, vaults, other team mates to not die. 
---
Oh you're not having fun getting killed? Well the killer isn't having fun whilst you're still alive and looping are they.
---
How come survivors are allowed to have fun but us killers are told we're shit for doing our job.
---
Camping is mechanic in the game, wonder why the devs made it so Wraith is completely invisible when standing still. You expect us to just to not get kills? What's the point in playing killer then if we arn't allowed to do our job and kill people.
---
I get that face camping is terrible but if the killer wants a player out of the game because they think it might benefit them in their attempt to win then thats their risk to take.
---
Is someone being camped or tunneled? Go do a generator and punish the killer. If you're the one being tunneled, camped and no gens are being done, thats not the killers fault is it.
---
When I get tunneled and camped and nothing gets done, I dont blame the killer, good on them for capitalizing on a team that doesnt do objectives.
---
I guess you're just better than me.
---
No there are plenty of trashcans out there incapable of playing the actual game that do the same.  There's nothing remotely unique about you.  Just your typical garden variety babykiller with a splash of vindictive pettiness.
---
Cool beans. Take er easy.
---
That's not what I'm saying. You play how you want to play. I'm just saying it's also valid for the survivor to be frustrated because they feel like they got railroaded.
---
Swf?
---
You too
---
If it were actually cancer, which kind do you think it would be? Testicular or breast?
---
The plaaaaaaaag dood

This is now my new favourite comment! Thank you for the laughing fit and for proving my point!

What's it like being so stupid that you don't know you're stupid even when someone points it out?
---
REPORT THEM. A BUDDY OF MIKE GOT BANNED FOR A WEEK FOR TRASH TALKING IN DBD PS4. SONY DONT GIVE A FUCK
---
I follow that bloodpoint rule as well for some odd reason. 
---
As survivor, I will not leave if there is someone on hook or someone being chased(If I can tell)
---
As killer, I will only mori on death hook unless it's a toxic SWF. Normal SWF are safe though
---
Funny randomhappencircumstance, I was playing Pig for quest with a pack of streamers. I got 2K and got a bevy of them calling me trash, one dude told me to uninstall. I clicked his Steam Profile, saw he was "A husband, a father, and a gamer." and that he streamed on Twitch. I popped in, told him "Thank you for telling me to Uninstall." And he was backtracking saying "Like I said in Stream it was a fun game, did you have fun?" And "Add me and we'll play together." I politely declined, reminded him of his unkind words and left.
---
I just don't get it; sure I'm not the best at the game, but why make personal attacks and be an asshole to strangers? Like I'm just trying to enjoy the game for fucks sake.
---
&gt; If I haven't run into or seen a particular survivor all match (because they're stealthy and immersive,) but end up seeing them after the other 3 are dead, I'll let them live.
---
Oh, I'm the opposite, if I see the missing stack at ANY point my focus goes 100% on them.
---
this far surpasses anything i could do
---
What the fuck are you talking about?
---
Playing in that way is the problem. I have simply identified the problem. Dicks like you defending these shit ways to play exacerbate the problem. I guess that makes you the asshole?
---
Just tag AngryPug and Jendenise and go. Those two are just really gross salt mines.
---
Sup cutie ;D
---
It’s funny lowkey, it just seems like this happened to u and ur bitter lol. it’ll only make u better playing against them. sincerely, someone who sucks at this game.
---
Can someone explain?
---
Survive With Friends
---
What's it like having no genuine points and having to use ad hominem attacks in order to get an idea across?
---
Also, you're a massive hypocrite. Just checked your comment history and it's full of you complaining about people and their play style.
---
To quote you, "fuck all the way off".
---
people aren’t watching twitch streamers for life lessons lmao
---
This happens alot against me, only i have 2k hours and main nurse so it doesn't end well.
---
New cosmetics + various bug fixes.
---
;)
---
I have been a killer main for a while now, and from what I can tell, survivor is so boring that the only way to have fun is to be an asshole and do a 4man swf at rank 4 or rank 17.
---
I play both killer and survivor and I consider myself a killer main, however I get so much anxiety playing killer that I wind up playing survivor more lmao.
---
Ahh okay thank you
---
Where did you make them ? In photoshop ?
---
Exactly. If you were a lion and you hadn't eaten in a few days. And theres 2 zebra's, one is injured, one is healthy and able to run for a good amount of time. Why would you not go for the injured one? Oh some made up rule said you can't do that? Guess I'll die then. 
---
Less people alive, less people working on gens.
---
I CAN'T FUCKIN' WAIT FOR PIG COSMETICS, PLEASE BHVR I NEED THEM AND I THEM NOW
---
awwhhhh brooo you just made my day xd with your comment much appreciate i will try being me and get out some new ideas thank you so much &lt;3
---
So when the survivors make a mistake and unhook without BT right in front of you and you capitalize on it, that makes the killer bad? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
Then this post isn't about you? Why are you feeling attacked if you aren't doing what OP described
---
Nice cherry picking. 
---
The guy who got less than 800 points wasn't even running perks. He was probably trying to derank. 
---
Omega Blink Nurse uses the best possible addons to beat survivors. 
---
Absolutely NO ONE used Dead Hard. Not like Dead Hard vs Nurse is dumb. It causes the longest possible fatigue time with a missed attack cooldown. Two people had it too, not like they didn't run it. 
---
No one broke LOS. 
---
No one tried hiding. 
---
No one stopped to heal each other. 
---
No one tried to get out of terror radius once they realized he was using Infectious Fright. 
---
Those may have been red rank players, but they acted pretty boosted if you cared to look.
---
Okay, thanks for the info. That should be fun since that map is my second least favorite. After the swamp of course.
---
They know exactly which outfits are money.
---
Looking at the two Susie outfits. One of them is a big-ol blue one with FAIRVIEW right on the chest.
---
The other one is a darker black with a pink skirt and FAIRVIEW cleanly across the back.
---
Immediately, I prefer the color palette of the latter and lo and behold, that's the one that has to be bought with real money. I absolutely gaurantee they have research behind it.
---
Thank you.
---
WHY TEABAG AS A SURVIVOR OR ATTACK ON HOOK AS KILLER?  YOU JUST GIVE THE IMPRESSION YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE
---
I think there's a lot of post on Reddit or dbd forum, just google killer/survivor tips, also watch streamers like Tru3 (for killer tips)  or Puppers, No0b3 (survivor tips). Also there's a Youtuber I find really great, just search for PainReliever.
---
That's all I can say for now. Good luck and have fun with the game, hope you'll get real good soon :D
---
Nailed it.
---
The outfit, I mean.
---
you sound like someone who NEVER played vs rank 1 legacy 3 nurses
---
yeah if that's your end goal, then yeah that's basically smurfing by exploiting the bad matchmaking.
---
Though as somebody with a rank 1 friend that i play with all the time. We often have a rank 17-20 with us or two. I'm rank 10 right now. So the killers at least get some farm and are able to kill some if they don't try to tunnel my one friend for the whole game. We're also not toxic assholes in or at the end of the game, which helps
---
People responding so far are way overstating how "horrible" he is.  Honestly post rework he feels pretty good to me.  Here's some tips.
---
1. Don't use your ability to just move across the map routinely.  You don't really go much faster and you won't have your cooldown when you want it not to mention you could totally miss a survivor right by you due to not seeing the scratch marks.
---
2. Use the ability when you find a survivor but don't pop it until you're very close to them.  Use it to put them into injured state for what's essentially a free hit to begin your chase.  After hitting them rotate your camera quickly and see if there's other survivors close by.  If there are leave the first guy immediately so you can hit another survivor and apply deep wounds.  Do the same thing if there isn't anyone else close at this point stay on your last survivor hit get right up on their ass and cancel your ability.  Proceed to complete the chase and down and hook.
---
3. Be disciplined and patient with your ability swing!  If you miss that's it you're out of your power.  Don't take the swing until you know 100% it will connect.  If they're juking like a wild Turkey take a step backwards than line up your hit.  Usually throws them off.
---
4. This is the one killer I love Sloppy Butcher and Thabatophobia on.  They'll either waste the entire game healing slowing down the gen pops or they'll stay injured slowing their repairs and keeping themselves as no mithers essentially.  It's a win win.
---
As popular as Chucky is, he just wouldn’t work in my opinion
---
I think so but Susie is on his hand (somewhat) twice so that evens out
---
I don't have an Instagram...
---
Did anyone receive their reward yet?
---
I was allowed to leave once. It was surreal. I guess the Doctor respected my all-in Altruism pressure.
---
Just disable post-game chat. Best thing I've ever done in this game
---
Dang, I haven't played Friday in a good while, cars are *still* messed up?
---
Good Luck!
---
up you go.
---
Huh, it looks like your Twitch isn't quite working. You may want to get that fixed with them.
---
Well Make It + Autodidact
---
Once you get your stacks, it's almost an instaheal off of hook.
---
I swear knock out was on the shrine like less than a month ago. But no BBQ or Ruin.
---
“Completely random” my ass.
---
Yes I have received mine I did have to restart my game though at first only the shards showed up.
---
You can straight up facetank the Killer to unhook. It's cheesy, but it means there's no excuse.
---
What not Ochido?
---
Yeah as a new killer main who plays a lot of competitive games, doing something that wins you the game seems like a no brainer to me. Just sounds like people hate it because it's effective. Same with gen rushing, it's literally the objective, why wouldn't survivors do it?
---
Bubba isn't fat, he's just big boned
---
would love a download link :)
---
he teabagged me :(
---
That one hurt. It felt like a javelin clean through the ribcage it's so real.
---
She can be purchased with shards though. She’s also a great killer to have.
---
They all look like they've seen some shit
---
WHEN DEDICATED SERVERS COME ONLINE AND ARE STABLE, I AM GOING TO BATH IN KILLER SALT. 
---
SO MANY WTF HITS THROUGH PALLETS AND WINDOWS. EVEN WHEN I PLAY KILLER I GET REACTIONS LIKE "WOW I TOTALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE HIT THAT GUY." 
---
KILLERS LOVE TO BITCH ABOUT LOOPS AND PERKS BUT FORGET ABOUT THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE OF ALL - **BEING THE HOST**
---
Looks like some lag and she hit you just as your dead hard finished.
---
you deadharded too early
---
Was going to upvote but saw your edit so I downvoted for you.
---
Nurse is OP on a 1v1 basis, but she's A) Necessary for Killer to ever win at red ranks (although maybe that makes her an obstacle to better balance overall) and B) Slow enough to work around for the other 3 people.
---
not so much counter a nurse, that video is just a terrible misplay by the killer. thats NOT a good nurse. tru3 is a decent-ish survivor, but not nearly close to being a high skilled survivor imo. i know dozens of nurse players where those chases would have been pretty much 5 seconds each.
---
with that being said, nurse is broken and needs rework/strong nerf asap
---
God bless you.
---
The game gives you a tip for who you're up against when you load in lol.
---
She had a mom remember?
---
Yep ,  and wtf is up  with everyone disliking my comment I thought this community hated ppl that farmed their own teammates :/ if I’m the killer and I see some asshole farm their teammate While on a chase I’m not gonna be a dick and go after the hooked person .. it ain’t that serious and it seems desperate af just have fun 🤷‍♂️
---
For me its just a person that hanged herself.
---
If people are truly killersided, they have no reason to be ashamed of that, as well to downvote me. So they do agree, because they have good reason for that in their opinion, don't you think?
---
This game would sure be different if Ash and Bill played like the real characters...
---
Pretty much, yeah. Not much else they can do unless they want to risk dying.
---
I also let Dwight live. I don't kill Dwights but I don't want to be unfair to his team, so I usually just two hook everyone and call it a day.
---
crying
---
Thanks, was worried at first but I restarted my game like you said and it appeared.
---
I tried it doesn't download for me
---
So if I credit you with your Reddit username that's cool?
---
Lucky!
---
A new player wouldn't play against high rank killers unless they're grouped with high rank players. Just saying
---
Oh, that's really sad to learn about.
---
nope, only if survivors are playing for fun and not actually doing gens
---
I refuse to believe standing near a hook has any value other than pissing someone off while being bored.
---
Legion will only share if you agree to get a cool mask like theirs
---
PREACH THE TRUTH SISTER HALLELUJAH
---
She's tapping because prayer beads
---
when u sort by new
---
jk i love this though
---
ofc it sometime happens, but as I said - if survivors know what they are doing, you are screwed. Still, talking about red ranks.
---
Depends on your play style, really. If you’re not scared of the heartbeat and you push gens he will find you
---
You don't see the sacrifice w/ the entity claws coming down?
---
Mori Monday 
---
Tunnel Tuesday 
---
Facecamp Friday

I’d stream that.
---
As a survivor with hundreds of hours in the game, who is often low-rank, I would like to place the blame fully on two things:
---
1. Rank resets happen far too often which is a problem because of
---
2. I have a life. With more than one hobby. I'm not going to play DbD constantly to get my rank up to where more challenging killers are, though I would enjoy being up there more because the teammates in these lower ranks suck.
---
No, I don't agree, because I see way too much bias on this sub in favor of survivors. Also, this is the internet. People leave their shame at the door unfortunately. Otherwise, they might be reasonable and bend to logic and truth.
---
IF YOU DISCONNECT BEFORE YOU DIE IT DOESN'T COUNT /S
---
Why does Feng Min look like she can bench press 250lbs?
---
Slugging is a counter to several ways the survivors can play, and trying to get all 4 kills is part of what a killer should do. The only thing you’ve proven is how you are the problem. GG and move on is better for everyone than insulting someone because they didn’t play by your rules kid.
---
Yeah, no matter how much I like some of these outfits, there's no way I'll pay 10€ per outfit. Those prices are ridiculous.
---
WHY IN THE MKDDLE OF EVERY GAME I GET "NO NETWORK CONNECTION" WHEN MY INTERNET IS STILL CLEARLY UP AND CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET? AND I LOSE 2 PIPS ALSO BECAUSE OF IT?
---
Wont happen my guy.
---
\*Killer main\* Ah you're toxic dude cuz you prevented the survivor from using a mechanic to waste your time.
---
This isn't funny. Because it's just depressing at this point.
---
Camping and fun can never be put together dude
---
But fat boi with an apron
---
“Leave the entity to me”
---
Related note has anyone seen a bloodweb connecting line that's all weird looking? Like its blueish grey and it is all spikey and shit? What the hell does that mean?
---
Yeah that’s way too early, you need to be in the dash as they hit to dodge.
---
It’s cause you gotta get off that boost mobile
---
Lol. A bunch of sour ass people that can't take a joke... Is this reddit?
---
This sub is filled with degenerate smoothbrains so having an opinion is usually frowned upon.
---
Just imagine Chucky chasing big man David King.
---
I always give a little nod to players after hooking them if they gave me a good chase or it took me quite a while to down them. I usually go for one hook per person; two hooks is optimal—I don’t aim to sacrifice. I try to prolong the game as much as possible so I can get bloodpoints. Sometimes I’ll ignore injured players and go after healthy ones because I want everyone to be injured. 
---
Also, I do the same thing with survivor bloodpoints!! Except killer bloodpoints—I always spend those on survivors. But Tapp’s points are Tapp’s points.
---
Looks like you were mashing to drop the pallet which tends to vacuum you backwards if you drop the pallet at max range. Your Dead Hard just ended so you probably got hit because of the vacuum combined with some latency.
---
It’s the Dead by Daylight sub. It’s like reddit, but gayer.
---
Same reason survivors run adrenaline/hope for example. People like to maximize an aspect of the trial.
---
I mean, yeah. It’s funny n all but how would chucky get them onto the hooks? And what would his power be?
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Picasso would be proud
---
I'm like that too I can't stand a sandbagger
---
I thought of this as more as a speculation than a joke. It just doesnt make since, how do you end up with more bugs than what you started with. The game has been out for three years and we are still having the same problems.  However, the devs are also constantly adding new content and gameplay to the game so it makes since that we keep getting new bugs.
---
The only counter to nurse is not being bad
---
No, I play the way I want to play, I have been playing like this for most of my time and I have always had a good time. I'm not gonna play fair cause survivors are bad, all I do is capitalize on their mistakes, I can play whatever way i want. To me it is not a babystrat to punish survivors, that is part of a game if you are a competitive player.
---
Tiffany can carry him around in a baby harness. Behavior if you're reading this it's okay for you to take my idea.
---
I've never not seen a killer other than once and honestly I think it was a Bing Bong Boi who just wanted to follow us around.
---
That kind of stuff happens on all games. I have not had to many people message me in DBD but in end game chat and that could maybe be because I play it on PC but on PS4 I was playing battlefield 4 once and defibbed a dude like 4 or 5 times and he messaged me for a week straight over PSN accusing me of hacking and cursing me out. It was a once a day message for a week.
---
Freddy's lullaby was never directional, though.
---
But Huntress did need this buff. Given her slower movement speed and directional lullaby, you could abuse large structures very well against her, looping them without her having the ability to double-back on you.
---
.....thats what I am saying. Its depressing that it keeps happening.
---
Wait until dcing is punished.
---
I didn't say where I was camping now did I?
---
Was this against the plague and you were playing as Laurie?
---
 
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused female Survivors not to be able to successfully vault through the crashed school bus middle window in the Autohaven Wrecker's maps. 
---
How the fuck did this even happen in the first place?
---
+ basement = your boned along with all your friends.
---
Freddy will only eat icecream with you if you're under 12.
---
Because staring at a hook is "playing the game" and "fun".  If that's how you have to get kills that's just sad man.  If you ever want to learn the role watch some killer streamers.  Zubat, True etc...than you won't have to crutch out downs in such a no skill rank 20 fashion.
---
If every survivor is nearby and not doing gens what's wrong about camping?
---
WHY CANT BHVR RELEASE A PATCH WHERE THEY DONT BREAK SOMETHING. NEW PATCH HAS A ECG TIMER THAT ISNT SLOWED DOWN WHEN SOMEONE IS ON THE HOOK.
---
\^
---
Maybe she was a strong and big child and never quite grown up afterwards.
---
Agreed. Camping is an effective and funny way to play ghostface as you can ambush survivors going for saves and mark them easily.
---
1)He has built in insidious
---
2)Can crouch to hide 
---
3) Marking survivors becomes extremely easy
---
4) it's funny.
---
Making 1-2 instadowns im mid game with camping is a viable and good strategy.
---
Btw, on Lery you can camp hook in middle from the second floor window or doorway(it's hard to see you and you can jump on them, lul)
---
That Wraith head makes me uncomfortable as fuck
---
How many games did you have to play? My guess is you would have made more than 450k BP in those games.
---
Must be more of that "giving back" spirit, ha.
---

---
Press "R".
---
Thank you for commenting. I had a lot of fun making this and hopefully it makes someone smile. I would love to make more.
---
Well I was climbing ranks over the few weeks and it definitely took 10+ mins at 7PM(EU)
---
yes this sub is a circle jerk for either killer or survivor. that's why i stay subbed for news or dope plays. i comment sometimes when i feel there's really some bs going on.
---
but be honest, why should the killer not get people out quickly? His goals is to win by getting rid of the survivors. for every one that gets out his chances to win are greater. he's obviously playing by the game rules and not this subs made up bs. goal is to get em out before they escape.
---
is a survivor gonna stop Poppin gens when they are at the last 2 because "Oh no, the killer hasn't even hit anyone yet. instead of winning and going to the next game let's let him sacrifice 3 of us. It's only fair."
---
foh
---
Killers complain about SWF because of the nonsense of using voice communication in a game that intentionally doesn’t provide it by default. Don’t use your anecdotal evidence from a single match as a way to try and plaster them.
---
So you say basement bubba is boring?
---
That's a good point. It was aggravating to go against but more power to them.
---
I could totally see Tiff being the killer too. The baby harness might be a little goofy for dbd though.

---
Just 15 and since the PTB counted bloodpoints I assure you playing as a survivor this is more than I earned.
---
I'm sure that rank means a whole lot in the "unranked" playlist I asked for.
---
Also that's the price we pay for having a rank that equates to the smallest playerbase in the game.
---
I see no god up here      But me
---
Lol great idea separate swf into their own queue so every killer refuses to play them.  That's a great strat to gut our player base down lol.  Would never work dude.
---
I think the devs are hard avoiding BBQ and Chili/Ruin cuz they want to drive up Leatherface/Hag sales(or try to make people burn shards on buying Hag)
---
Only reason why we'd get the same buggered perks out of it when they could have easily picked other perks. That, or the shrine is entirely randomized, which I doubt.
---
Ye deffo. Always left these ppl dead last
---
I have to agree with you there. I enjoy playing this game once in awhile.  Plus I always play with my friends and all of our ranks are mismatched.  we definitely have one or two players who are hardcore and yes it sucks for the killer. However that's how the game was designed and I'm not going to bend over backwards on my own personal time to appease killers.
---
Yeah, the 4 people that use the perk got punished for it :(
---
JUST BECAUSE YOU LOST A GAME BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T WORK THROUGH RUIN AND I RAN BLOODY COIL+HONING STONE DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO USE CALL ME RACIAL SLURS
---
Not the only no generator tho.
---
They were changing the way Freddy's works though.
---
His was going to be directional and replace the TR while survivors were asleep. This is likely from a Freddy change is my point.
---
Overcharge works well if survivors in your rank like to gen tap Ruin instead of hitting the skill checks, if you try to gen tap an Overcharged generator the skill check happens anyway and you have to hit it or blow the generator(which sets back a gen tap strat a huge amount)
---
They're just immersed, don't worry about it.
---
4 man SWF have become so annoying that I leave the lobby when I see 4 people join at the same time
---
That is not how I have to get kills, all I'm saying is that I think camping can be justified, if there is no one is working on a gen why would I got over to it? Why should I waste my time if the survivor are already wasting theirs. If all gens are done and the Exit is on the other side of the map what is the point in checking it? The survivor will probably just escape. Also the fact that you used rank as a skill comparison kinda shows me how much you know about the game, rank does not equal skill, and if it did I guess my start is working out fine since I have been rank one every month I've played since I got rank 1 the first time. And I never said staying near the hook is fun, all I said was that I am a competitive player, and winning is fun to me. 
---
I play very simply, get as many kills as you can. IDC how I get the kills, sometimes I get kills cause the survivor play poorly and sometimes I get the kills the "right way".
---
Overcharge works better on Doc than anyone else since its a skill check and can be zapped like every other skill check, increasing the chances of them fucking it up.
---
What map is that? And was that already there or did it pop in halfway through the match
---
its usually clipping stuff but idk specifically which ones
---
Let me say I’m rank 2, but play like a rank 15. I’m only rank 2 because I play with 1 or 2 good players. I have a ton of hours so I know what to do. Playing with other ranks gives me a chance to try new things and practice.
---
I'M REALLY SICK OF THIS DAMN BUG THAT WON'T LET ME ESCAPE, I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DIE WHEN I'VE EARNED MY VICTORY. IT NEEDS TO FIXED IMMEDIATELY
---
Yea I totally agree!
---
Guess you're the type to not get a joke even when it's slapping you in the face.
---
if anyone wants to look at some streamers that regularly play DBD I would recommend Otzdarva, dude is very positive and regularly provides tutorials, tips, how to's on killer games, and sometimes survivors as well.
---
SOME SHITTY SURVIVOR WAS LAG SWITCHING IN A GAME I HAD LAST NIGHT. CHASES STARTED OFF NORMAL BUT ONCE I GOT A HIT THEY’D START TELEPORTING. WTF DIDNT KNOW THAT WAS POSSIBLE
---
Its out now
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
I think you're funny dude, fuck these haters, live your life.
---
latency + dead hard was already completed. a bit greedy with the timing.
---
I remember a bunch of games where I got demolished by a killer and i raged at their perks but I don't remember the other 50% of my games where i escape.....okay 30% of my games
---
that's how it looks like during the winter event
---
Any decent survivor will try to loop the window multiple times before dropping god pallet. If they go for the window, fake following them into the shack and then run around the outside and you’ll either get a hit, or they’ll be forced to drop the pallet - in which case you removed god pallet from the shack in like 10 seconds, which is just as valuable as a hit.

spirit would do the job
---
My group is al around the same ish level, like ine is rank 8 and he’s the best of us, Im 12, one is 13 and the other is 15. So the only one who is really at an advantage is the 8, but even he gets murked usually
---
you ruined the skin for me now
---
And enter Bubba
---
she is used to pain anyway
---
Have him drag them by feet, have the hook lower to his level like a crane, have him jump up grab windows and pull up over it and drop then have the entity break pallets for him with the spider leg.
---
Easy chucky fix. Maybe make his vision higher a bit higher than the model as well. A bit taller than Ghost/Pigs crouch camera.
---
Do you have a link to the banners?
---
Lol yea, I like to John Cena people out of nowhere, I was inspired by Otzdarva. Also you can do cheeky strats with Gens and I even got someone by popping out near a chest lol
---
I mean, I think it's pretty bullshit that the killer can be blinded while breaking a pallet. That's like double jeopardy.
---
If you really want to pick hairs and say that everything not intended is an exploit, the Devs have said in a Q&amp;A that 360's were not intended and by your definition would be an exploit.
---
You camp and tunnel for your 4K's assuming noed too?  You sound like you use it.  While I 4K without camps and tunnels constantly switching up targets and initiating new chases.  A survivor farms the person on hook I don't use them as a teamate and crutch the unhooked guy back to the ground for a spoonfed down I switch to the farmer because fuck teamates that do that to people.  I know far more about this game than you do man hence the fact I play fun competitive games for both sides while winning my games while you take the exact opposite approach.
---
Like SMPLive?
---
no [paint.net](https://paint.net) x)
---
If you don't play survivor 4 times the amount you play killer, you're a bad person.
---
Why not? They’re both anti-slugging perks, but too weak and situational individually to ever bother running. If they were combined you’d at least be more likely to get use out of either effect. The combined perk wouldn’t be particularly strong either.
---
Believe it was Wrecker's Yard. And yeah it was already there, which is probably why they used an Autohaven offering.
---
Obvious attempt at sarcasm aside, yes, I agree, many killer powers do have incredibly frustrating aspects to them. The solution should be to start removing frustrations from older abilities, not making sure new ones meet a quota of frustration.
---
Also, KI is not exact location. It does a very good job giving direction, but basically nothing on distance
---
But you also had no offerings or perks. Playing 15 rounds especially during the event means burnt Gateaus, often multiple, as well as Streamers and Cakes/Puddings, and then there's BBQ and WGLF. A killer would regularly make a lot more than 450k in 15 rounds.
---
This "reward" isn't awful, and the Shards are nice, sure, it's just... why not a pack of 500 Auric Cells, as well? The least I'd have expected, honestly. People bother to apply, are available for the test period after BHVR first already messed up and the test branch was not playable, play perklessly in that limited-player build (and therefore have longer queue times), gain no progress of any sort in the process - and then get a "reward" that can be earned purely by playing. Kind of lackluster, especially when regarded with the context in mind that I alluded to, namely of them saying "this year is all about giving back to the players".

“Feng players like to dress her up and will shell out the money sooner or later”
---
Is this a personal attack?
---
Are you talking about Survivor or Killer? It’s definitely not game breaking for Killer because the music drowns out some Survivor sounds.
---
Yeah, I had a feeling she wore her mom’s old clothes. I thought that when I asked the question...
---
Use NOED, it punishes survivors who rush gens ;)
---
2 minutes is an incredibly long time given the context, 2 seconds is nothing at all, especially not if you're trying to pallet stun the killer
---
Hi, I hope this isn't too controversial, but I try to see the survivors as not real people, but instead AI so that I don't make any plays led by emotion. I would like to know if anyone else plays killer in this role-play type way.
---
As a survivor, I play the opposite. I will not metagame (communicate on comms with a SWF group) as I sympathise with how this affects the killer's experience. I only play with information my survivor would know about with their own knowledge (not external knowledge due to comms).
---
I don't know what's more sad, the few seconds it took me to figure that out, or the fact that I did figure it out. XD
---
Whispers and sloppy butcher are great people also like to use NOED but personally i dont like perks that only help at the end of a match
---
Really helpful, thanks for your time mate! I bought him and thought he was pretty underwhelming, but it seems i have been using him wrong
---
distressing, NOED, hunter hex
---
When the survivor is comong at you with adrelaline, dead hard, metal of man and while carrying an insta-heal
---
Entitlement, “Us vs them”, and an overall lack of empathy is the problem 
---
I still say we should have a week where everyone who mains a role switches sides to properly get a feel for what the other side experiences 
---
At the end of the day this game needs players to fill both roles, as much as we fight we gotta learn to live with each other 
---
Expect people who willingly use hacks, glitches, and/or exploits then act like it’s fine, screw them, they’re the only ones who deserve the hate
---
So uncivilized
---
I'd say "entitled keyboard warrior syndrome" the fact that adult children or children themselves are raised in "safe spaces" and can hide behind their computer screens while being complete pieces of shit to anyone that dares to enter their gravitational pullm
---
Take for example my personal experience with a PS4 player known as Black__Hippiex 
---
This little bitch was raised in a safe space environment. He will DDOS anyone that is beating him, message you to taunt you letting you know he is DDosing you, and then continue on. This is Because he doesnt have the fear of repercussions that he has been shielded from by terrible parents. There is no one in front of him ready to break his jaw for opening his mouth. 
---
People like this are also probably Incels at the very least. They avoid conflict in the real world because they can't handle it and will shut down, run away, or curl up into a ball.
---
They will cry out how the world isn't fair to them. That they are a victim all while mommy is downstairs after working a double shift making them their favorite meal being spongebob mac and cheese with a Capri-sun.
---
They are also the most likely the one not wearing the pants in the relationships they have and frequently get cucked in every circumstance.

This behavior is not secluded to just DBD but is rampart in pretty much every form of modern society. It's unfortunate, but at some point it will die out as this behavior isn't super attractive to women, maybe at first but it's short-lived, so the real men(and women) that get shit done will outbreed the keyboard warriors that will eventually die out because they thankfully couldn't pass on their piss poor large fry diet soda safe space to cry in genetics to the next unfortunate generation.
---
You're right, but putting bp into him isn't a big waste since you can easily get it back if you have the right perks.
---
Lol you didn’t have to play the beta, you chose to.
---
It's not as valuable as hit, because you need to down people to aplly pressure, not pallets
---
Man I wish that SWF groups like that got mixed with higher rank killers, or at least like... a killer in the 'middle' of their ranks. I feel bad for the killers when this happens to them, but I'll also feel bad for survivors because damn if you're playing duo queue, it breaks itself.

Not wrong. Billy is loopable, Spirit isn't.
---
Perks or not?
---
Maps? Or just Coal Tower again?
---
Instead of Bamboozle and Spirit Fury, I'd use Thrilling Tremors and Whispers. Seems more "connected" to the Entity
---
Tapp. Nice pun.
---
Is the language of the Gods?
---
Claudette
---
Yeah, its a shame that the non-asshole streamers don't get as much views. Otzdarva and Scott Jund are some of my favorites when it comes to DBD streamers.
---
Ah, I see. Didn't know they were planning to make his lullably directional. (That would have been kind of silly anyway - Huntress technically hums the lullaby herself, but Freddy's lullaby isn't something he himself emits, more so something a dreaming mind conjures to inform of his presence, so it having directionality would be like him carrying a boombox, lol.)
---
I did photography/editing on this thank you!! 😭
---
As a killer main: I have absolutely seen survivors told to play a certain way. Namely "gen rushing", it's very frustrating when gens are getting done faster than you can control but some people go as far as to say survivors shouldn't ever work on gens if there's something altruistic to do.
---
Bunny Feng :(
---
Basement LF is hilarious when people keep running down. That's fun camping for the killer.
---
I think they did a great job on Plague all around tbh- really good design and a decently powerful killer with an interesting ability. Only letdown was the map.
---
Replying for her cause she's busy rn but she has a Twitter and insta with same username!
---
Thank you!!
---
You can get bond easily without the shrine, the devs made bbq show up in the shrine less so people would be forced to buy leatherface.
---
The perk doubles your BP gained in a match and tells you what to do after hooking a survivor, nobody can say that perk is not extremely strong either
---
Ok so dumb question, but I'm just getting back on dbd and what's the lava on the ground?
---
Its easy to get a first hit with ghostface because he has no terror radious while using his ability so if you run expose perks a lot of the time that first hit will be the only one you need
---
NOED, Sloppy Butcher, Whispers and Bitter Murmur are the best ones.
---
They may be limited in their selection of actually decent perks. My GF blood webs gave me a couple of decent perks, then tier 1 of every weak perk in the game. If you have tier 3 Male Your Choice, it’s probably better running that than Hangman’s Trick or whatever, even if it isn’t the number one choice for the killer.
---
If they put ruin behind a paywall like they did with BBQ, a lot more people would make a lot more noise
---
Don’t watch it. You’ll realize the guy never says “doing gens you?”
---
Survivor main spotted.
---
The queue times are a fucking joke right now
---
don’t zap 40 times in a chase unless you’re at a pallet
---
if you need to zap 40 times at a pallet don’t zap at that pallet
---
The aliens are coming for my girl
---
Ok thanks
---
So you agree with me? Did you even read what I just posted?
---
I wouldn’t
---
You aren’t wrong.
---
“Genrush” is a bullshit concept made by salty killers, it’s literally the main objective of the game, how do you rush the main objective? NOED punishes survivors because of killers who fail to keep up pressure and rotate efficiently, letting survivors complete the main objective of the game only to be able to make a comeback off of a crutch perk
---
He says it in the endgame chat, go read
---
&gt;The last cosmetic will be the Beat cop
---
So long. :(
---
I’m 100% it’s not a joke. Lol
---
Killers who only focus their attention on you throughout the match.
---
You're tourney isn't gonna work like that. It needs to be based off bloodpoints or cheesy stuff like basement camping builds or using a key for the hatch. Or survivors may just rush gens and hide all game. Likewise the map should be predetermined and the "classes" need to be predetermined so they can be balanced a little. This is all just my opinion but there are some good examples of DbD tournies on YouTube
---
Gonna be honest, I actually liked the lack of music while carrying a Survivor. 
---
So all audio is being adjusted. Hoping Survivor sounds aren’t lowered on the Killer side again. I don’t want to go back to struggling to hear a Survivor who is not even a foot away from me.
---
Issue that is still ignored by the devs cuz fog whisperers have *not done this at all*
---
Entity ¯\\_(0_0)_/¯
---
All the carrying she did in Esports obviously.
---
Nah It brings me pleasure because then I can say where are my Killer Gen Rush rules at red ranks? Where are my anti loop rules? The double standards between killers and Survivors are funny.
---
I never said I camp or tunnel every game. If I did I misspoke, what I do is if I find that camping or tunneling is the best option I will do it.
---
"A survivor farms the person on hook I don't use them as a teamate and crutch the unhooked guy back to the ground for a spoonfed down I switch to the farmer because fuck teamates that do that to people." 
---
I agree, I have empathy for them but that doesn't mean I have to play fair or punish the unhooker for their mistake. And that is not real how competitive games work, in a competitive scenario both sides cannot win, hence competition. just cause you play fair and both sides are having fun doesn't mean you know more about the game than me. Playing fair doesn't mean you are good at a game, being good at a game is being able to consistently win I would say, playing fair doesn't mean you are good at the game. And it is hard to measure skill in DBD cause rank doesn't really mean a lot and you can't track stats, unless you start from the beginning. I guess we're gonna have to agree to disagree, you like to play fair and make sure everyone is having fun and I like to win.
---
People who will aggressively re-hook the same survivor to get early eliminations.
---
Unfortunately, this is implicitly rewarded by the game in several ways. On many killers who lack a one-hit down ability, it's easier to down someone still injured from having been on a hook than someone fresh. Someone who's already been hooked has less time alive and thus pressures other survivors more, forcing them to make mistakes or take risks that allow you to spread more damage out during rescue attempts. And finally, losing a body outright dramatically decreases the survivor team's potential for repairing and healing.
---
There was a Claudy sitting up there just chilling and I snuck up on her crouched as the pig and climbed up next to her. It apparently scared her so much she fell off the rock
---
THE MATCHMAKING IS A FLAMING DUMPSTER FIRE! I JUST STARTED PLAYING THIS GAME! SO TELL ME WHY IN THE HIGH HOLY HELL DO I KEEP GETTING MATCHED AGAINST PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR YEARS?! PLAYER LEVEL SHOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN RANK IN MATCHMAKING!
---
The killer can play in strongest strategy don't get angry when you lose.
---
Do gens instead of pretending to be Michael Jackson :)
---
It's a great set
---
There's nobody I want advice from more than a chill high-rank survivor. My Nurse play/mindgames got way better from one a bit back because he got me really thinking about the psychology of how far and how fast you NOTHING PERSONNEL KID around.
---
One morning I woke up and started making an image pack which added dwight to most survivor portraits (ignoring any of the black survivors because I'm not walking into that shit storm), and a few edits to the killer side. I never actually posted the pack because I never bothered to finish it
---
https://imgur.com/a/jBpUckf
---
I win consistently while playing fair which is what makes me good.  But you do you.
---
Edit's carelessly gratuitous.
---
Wow this is absolute trash. Are you 10 years old? No one wants to see this shit
---
It depends on whether people are farming pips, farming blood points, or have something else as their "win condition". It's not as simple as win or lose.
---
that’s why it’s a shitpost you shitface
---
Ihave 500+h but my friend is a new baby so what cant play with him?
---
Still tho, some people don't know the difference of a good play and a bad player
---
I continue to work with my team to do objectives, I do not practice my moonwalking during ranked games. I mentioned that I spent the majority of my time moonwalking in the tutorial.
---
When you bring the killer to the locker so he gets grabbed to teach him to never go into lockers again
---
Not really an important patch,  since there is still the non healing bug
---
I have it on multiple killers and it seems to work well with them too. At least for level 12.
---
keys and camping isnt allowed but yeah i do agree about the map being decided before had.
---
Opening up paint is very hard
---
Nah, totems are an objective also, wether you like it or not. Besides killers can do great all game and a survivor can make a comeback with the hatch, which isn't reliant on a crutch perk or even how many gens they finish anymore.
---
I WILL KEEP MY RANK FROM 16-20 FOREVER IF YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT NOED!
---
it would be easier if i put the rules on here as well but ive already made a massive paragraph already lol
---
Same that would be beautiful! I’m so close to buying dead by Daylight on my boyfriend’s PC so I can play it whenever I get the chance and just use my PS4 version the rest of the time- but then I’d lose all my progress...
---
I know what insidious is, I just didn't know what sub 10 meant. Thanks
---
I see it now thank you
---
noed is for pussies an idiots
---
I agree with the other comments, I just want to add that many times you can also (if you've played this game long enough) notice when a survivor probably has DS from their playstyle. Ofc this is in combination with the other hints that other people have mentioned.
---
Look at it a bit like dead heard, sometimes you just know from how the survivor plays.
---
To be fair, if they're doing gens, you at least bought them time they used for something good.
---
Sounds like a survivor fest.
---
and also we said no red addons so they cant uses brand new parts for gen rushing
---
Got it, thanks.
---
Just gimp! Haha
---
I just doubt he'd have the strength to drag a survivor, much like not being able to break pallets (but the entity thing could work). Lower hooks could work, but let say he did have the strength to drag a full grown adult, he'd still be extremely slow at moving them. As for his movement speed; granted, Chucky does move quicker than expected, but 115‰ is very unrealistic, (not that dbd is very realistic, haha). At best, I feel like he would be at 95% movement speed. Chucky having the eye level of a crouched killer I suppose is reasonable.
---
Chucky would be cool to have, I just don't think this (game) scenario is best. If anything, Chucky deserves his own game. Or maybe give him (and other doll class) their own game mode, that would work entirely differently. 
---
Side note: I think I read somewhere that the creators said they wouldn't be using any of the doll class killers in the game.
---
I’ve just seen the same thing happen a hundred times
---
Thats why you flaired it as (fan content). Just admit you are a terrible artist
---
This ain't it chief
---
As a wise man once said, "online gaming isn't the issue, it's the people that play it."
---
Sorry for my dumb ass, but i dont get it. Whats about the circle in the temple map joke?
---
Might as well @ half of this subreddit lmao
---
It surprises me that people main one side, to me it gets boring if I play one side to much I play both sides and every character equally and the variety makes the game a lot more fun. Plus you learn way more about how to play a character by going against them.
---
What have they done this time...
---
Looping pallets is something killers cannot complain about in my opinion. I played a match the other night in which where the survivor was God mod pallet running me, and I literally had to just ignore that survivor. once everyone else died it was basically just the hatch game. Had to drop them off at the hatch due to the mad props they deserve. palling running is so annoying but it's very effective if they do it correctly.
---
End Collapse Game
---
I'm kind of new to both too really. I go out get some pictures with my camera of things like wildlife and military jets and then come home and fix them up with some software. I haven't tried to do this kind of photo editing before but I bet it's hard to learn. Takes a lot of skill
---
RePoRt
---
It's fine, IIRC it protects people from evil, so if your a nice killer, you wont kill them in the circle
---
My opinion, I think huntress would be the best to start with. She has a high skill cap, has a very powerful ability, but can also be looped for a long time. You will have the most balanced experience of killer if you start with her
---
You're good, our brains do it automatically :)
---
Yeah but they can coordinate on perks and use the 16 slots effectively. For example have a high rank buddy join the survive with friends group, run DS, DH, Adremaline, Kindered. Lead the lower-ranked killer on a chase the whole match or bully while the others two generators and hook saves.
---
And that's what made me stop playing killer for a while when I was first starting out on the game. Didn't really understand survive with friends until I was going to get his red and purple ranks while I was still 20-15.
---
And it still happens almost every other match. No matter what I do I will be matched against higher rank survivors or survivors of using the system. I even tested it on a new account as a rank 20 with Freddy, perkless.
---
Rank 2, Rank 6, 14, 20. I wasn't even trying just testing the ranking(and in case they were actually new players I didn't want to ruin the fun for them) and they made sure to talk plenty of shit afterwards.
---
Everyone says hillbilly. But honestly it comes down to preference. Play a couple games with killers you find yourself being interested in and go from there. I started with Hag and Doctor because I had problems finding survivors at first.
---
yeah I completely agree with what you are saying with the point system ill actually talk to the teams we have and the people organising it. but addon wise idk about because purple addons do make the game interesting but ill have to talk to people about that
---
lmao this was done as a joke seeing you respond to it multiple times shows you care about reddit and have no friends irl LOLOLOL just admit it you’re a loser.
---
I let out the ugliest cackle
---
Feeling entitled to a cooler reward is a little different from finding it funny how lackluster the reward turned out, when contextualized within their grand anniversary announcement of "giving back". A reward that was indeed promised, at that. The promise of a reward was likely the pull for many or most people applying; had they simply said "450k BP and 2k Shards", I'm not sure they'd have gotten quite the response they did.
---
Either way, I'm glad you find it amusing - much like you, I'm pointing out something I find amusing.
---
Yay generalizing. I've literally never seen this. 500 hours in DBD and I watch a lot of twitch. Also posts like this just make our community more toxic.
---
IT PISSES ME OFF THAT YOU BASICALLY CANNOT PLAY AN EFFECTIVE KILLER WITHOUT RUIN TO PREVENT GEN RUSHING. BBQ IS PRACTICALLY MANDATORY AS WELL.
---
IF THE GAME WAS NOT SO CHEAP ALREADY I WOULD BE PISSED BUT EVEN AS IS, I HAD TO WASTE MY TIME LEVELING BORING ASS BUBBA JUST TO HAVE MY BBQ ON BILLY AND NURSE
---
It's called not being a snowflake, u should try it.
---
What’s the Huntress skin? And isn’t the Wraith one fanmade?
---
I only give hatch when survivor team disconnected, I have incredible satisfaction when I kill a survivor that looped me really well, and Im not gonna give hatch for survivor which already found it
---
Thanks for this
---
The one game I played as killer I tried Hillbilly, but I was too off-put by the floaty chainsaw sprint, I could get used to it, but it felt weird to me.
---
It's actually not too difficult! Once you learn what each tool does and how to use it, touch ups become a breeze. YouTube is great for beginner tutorials!
---
More like what they have been doing for the past three years. Recently there was lots of audio glitches that gave the killer many advantages, because sometimes heartbeats wouldnt be heard or the nurse's blinks couldnt be heard
---
Whenever I play killer and people complain at me for camping or tunneling (whether or not I’m actually doing it) I tell them that I do whatever I need to do in order to win. 
---
Then I tell them to have a nice day and leave.
---
It’s the advantage that they have.  It’s why it’s like that no need to change it.
---
Okay then. Whatever helps you sleep at night
---
You're welcome. Happy to help
---
If you kill a survivor who gets sandbagged on purpose then you and the mates are the ones who are not cool.
---
I always get to rank 6-7 ish.. But then stop playing for 2 months cuz the game becomes unfun or my friends stop playing... then we play again months later at low ranks. I don't mean to I swear!
---
If you heal someone before a rescue to get at least two stacks, healing starts to fly by afterwards. I use it every game and it always works
---
Survivors, by the game's very design, can make multiple and many mistakes and get out still.
---
Killers on the other hand really can't afford to make any due to the huge time crunch.
---
It is a 1v4. The 1 is MEANT to have an advantage over the 4 to make up for the fact that they're only 1 person... That's the entire point of Asymmetrical games. The 4 have to work together to win.
---
As it is now, if the survivors play perfectly, one of them just loops the killer untill gens are done. Only Nurse can really shake that up.
---
Tapp is dissapointed by your TAPPing
---
&gt; The guy who got less than 800 points wasn't even running perks. He was probably trying to derank.
---
He got downed almost immediately at the start and almost instadowned every time he was revived regardless of where the Nurse was lol.  But sure, that must've been because "he was probably trying to derank".  I bet if he was playing seriously he would've just used his warp perk to teleport away.  
---
You already know your argument is terrible if this is what you lead with lmao  
---
&gt;Omega Blink Nurse uses the best possible addons to beat survivors. Absolutely NO ONE used Dead Hard. Not like Dead Hard vs Nurse is dumb. It causes the longest possible fatigue time with a missed attack cooldown. Two people had it too, not like they didn't run it.  
---
Uhh, only one of them had it, not two?  
---
&gt;No one broke LOS.  
---
Yeah, they did, but it's easy enough to guess where they are or to blink to an area that gives a better view.  
---
&gt;No one stopped to heal each other.  
---
Because he was almost instantly on people after they got picked up lol.  They stop to heal in an area he knows that they are, they are gonna die  
---
&gt;No one tried to get out of terror radius once they realized he was using Infectious Fright.  
---
It only triggered three times, and the third time cause they were all together after reviving each other.  So only one real issue  
---
Sounds like you're the one desperately trying to cherrypick ways the survivors "misplayed" in order to justify the Nurse lol
---
Get me a ScottJund or ZubatLel cosmetic. (Presumably for Huntress, Hillbilly, or chosen survivor.)
---
&gt; would bring more balance to the game
---
Oh boy, another green rank struggling killer
---
Alright, I can see that. Usually I’m not all that confident in my aim, but I can’t say it wouldn’t be worth a try, will give her a shot.
---
Whats tapping ?
---
I’m referring to a individual loss.
---
I mean, I don't think I'm a snowflake but the bullying from both sides is rather annoying.
---
thank you &lt;3
---
Ah sweet! I might start learning more then. For now I edit photos to make them look richer and more realistic and also try to make things look kind of natural to if that makes sense.
---
FUCK! I can't wait anymore for the pig and huntress outfits!
---
Ochido be like
---
Survivors need third person to hide more . Killers would have extreme amounts of advantage if they were in first .
---
Thanks, Confucius.
---
Playing Killer is mad dumb dumb stupid easy. I can listen to music, sleep deprived and stoned as shit and get a 4K without tunneling. I’m only Rank 9 so I’m not sure if it gets much more difficult than that but it feels like something should change
---
I got this game like mabye a month ago. I'm amazing at it, but haven't figured out all the lingo. Someone explain sandbagging
---
I sometimes let Fengs go or any survivor I find cute. I punish sandbagging and go after the unhooker the majority of the time if they do it before I leave the hook.
---
When I'm a survivor and a Myers doesn't get any kills or has given up, I will sacrifice myself for him. It's funny because they seem to know what I'm doing and will either hang out in a corner with me or will try to force me to leave.
---
no, it doesn't
---
Freddy too.
---
I understand that if you take away pallets and looping then the survivors have nothing to survive. I also understand that facecamping suck, I dont facecamp. But camping like securing the kill (not necessarily) face camping has to exist because of how easy it is for survivors to avoid the killer and waste their time. The killers want to have atleast something to show for the time they spent playing the game.
---
Survivors pallet looping for a bit gives killers more chase points. I think it’s great for both sides. (As long as the loop doesn’t last for more than 5 laps)
---
110% on current billy would make him the worst killer in the game.
---
You need to swim in acid so you will have those weird bruises, and cut off your toe too. Good luck!
---
Anyone can claim to be something. I could claim to be a Survivor Main even if I've never touched the game.
---
There are certain trends said by certain factions. If complaining about Gen Rush it's likely a killer. If complaining about Nurse it's likely a survivor.
---
No it doesn't.  Hits on hook don't count.  That being said don't bm survivors on the hook dude.  That's the equivalent of teabagging.  Let's act like we've hooked a survivor before.
---
You should try Nurse or Spirit in the future, but once you have solid fundamental killer skills, they really benefit from that, and they're kind of needed. For starters, what kind of power sounds fun to you? Setting up a web of traps with Hag or Trapper? Throwing hatchets from a distance with Huntress? Stalking people with Ghostface or Myers? You can't really go wrong with either of them at the beginning, it's only later that some of them become limiting so don't worry about it too much. If you want a slightly easier time go with Hillbilly, just for his speed alone, which lets you zoom across the map and keep the pressure up. But again, you will only need that once you start seriously ranking up.
---
I've played For Honor and Overwatch and dbd out does both of them combined for hate messages.
---
Btw which streamer are you talking about?. I've heard AngryPug is toxic but is that the one you're referring to?
---
There was a meme on Instagram posted by a page that jokes about video games, I just edited it and turned it into a DBD meme, I don't know what app this is actually talking about
---
LEVEL MEANS LITERALLY NOTHING, YOU CAN HAVE A P3 MAX PERK SURVIVOR WITH BP FROM KILLER AND NOT BE ABLE TO LOOP YOUR WAY OUT OF A PAPER BAG, I AM TOTALLY NOT SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE.
---
DEVOTION/GAME TIME IS ALSO JUST A TIME GAUGE AND MEANS NOTHING IF THE PLAYER DOESN'T WANT TO GET BETTER.
---
RANKS SHOULD NOT RESET, EACH KILLER SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN RANK, AND **SWF SHOULD ALWAYS TAKE THE HIGHEST (LOWEST?!?) RANK** SO IF THAT RANK 1 WANTS TO BRING A RANK 15 THEN THAT RANK 15 WILL NEED TO GIT GUD FAST.
---
Oroboro and ScottJund too. Ex DS invaders are chill af.
---
Yea, you are right they do :)
---
Whispers and Sloppy are the two that cone to mind first.    
---
NOED is also good but I wouldn’t really recommend it if you’re going to rely on it
---
It could be any member and make sense. Since the devs haven’t confirmed if they get hang out time.
---
Yes it is, getting kills gets you points, as well as the points earned while chasing survivors to do so. Unless you want to give evidence supporting your point, you’re wrong.
---
I'm not. I was wondering because if so, that would mean I could bait a hit on a hooked survivor at the end of the game to see if there's noed before going for a rescue if they're camping.
---
yes I use it before
---
Thanks
---
Imagine if it was like a veiny mask like the huntress axe or something like that... that would be both cool and gross.
---
She's the first killer I got to rank 1 with. I mained her, **NEVER** used add-ons. I stopped playing her when I tried to do daillies as other killers and repeteadly got my ass handed to me over and over and over until I got grinded down to fucking rank 12 where I belonged.
---
Yes, she's rough as fuck if you're new. If you figure out that your first blink is for distance/ setting up an angle and second for precision, congrats, you can't fuck up.
---
Then add game sense, hearing grass, Lightborn, more optimal perks, and 3,000 hours, and you get someone who can end **literally every game** without a gen being done, without ruin.
---
First time a sitting U.S. president stepped into N.K. territory
---
EA bad. Upvotes to the left, fuckers 👈👈👈
---
that... seems like it would actually be pretty good in fact
---
wait you think i was trying to draw lol i was doing what my friend did this is meant to be a joke lol
---
Bruh you'd be the first one to get your ass kicked if we weren't in a safespace all the time, project some more.
---
wasnt a 4k render of all the leaked skins released like a week ago?
---
I play on PS4 we don’t have in game chat, so I don’t know what other players are thinking. Sure I still receive some toxic messages I leave conversations without answering and leave them hanging. Best way to enjoy is to ignore chat &amp; I don’t know how to ignore chat in PC but there must be an option. Just imagine players being toxic and receive no response because you didn’t read what they wrote. life is good, so the game just enjoy playing.

*one winged angel intensifies*
---
I used something like this and got called a try hard when I was just taking it easy on a killer game but wanted a bit more time than the usual 4 minute game because I suck. I used BBQ, Ruin, Thrilling Tremors, and Discordance.
---
my best friend got me fortnite trading cards...... I hate fortnite
---
This game is toxic because it pits 4 players against 1 player with a theme easily construed as those 4 players nearly always losing.
---
1 player is night unstoppable and gets to "win" nearly every game, and 4 players are expect to run until they lose.
---
Then you have people that say they main "winners", claim they are justified in playing as abusively as possible, and complain when those 4 other players call them out about it.
---
Fuck, I've had killer mains bitch that I "ran them around" Like I have any fucking thing else to do besides gens and dying.
---
Killer mains are spoiled assholes and are ruining this game.
---
Sounds like you lost to a killer with noed
---
Well, I could click on the back or upgrade button really fast lol.
---
Yeah, I bet he can fly  farther than a hatchet!
---
No need to belittle op, but I can agree his posts are a little redundant
---
Can attention whoring shit like this just fuck off to r/cospaygirls please
---
You husband now
---
Is Bond really that much times on shrine now?
---
My first batch of matches were exactly this.
---
Doing gens, and then hanging out near the exit until someone finished the last 1 and I would run out.
---
My first chase was really long, and I ended up dying in 1 hook in the basement, but that's because I attempted escape.
---
I wish I could go back, and never look at anything DBD online. Reddit and YouTube ruined the game for me.
---
I love it but ugh..her outfit combos are limited.
---
I can't believe I really just watched a win from Head On.
---
yup https://www.mediafire.com/file/dstqaec0q4yaj3n/iconStatusEffects\_0.rar/file
---
Bruh alright this game is a game you grind not a game 30 mins and your done it needs skill and training
---
no, i met a ghost face with noed. then a billy. then a Myers. all in a row.
---
It's your choice how you play. It's also your opponents' choices on how to react. If you don't want toxic survivor chat, that can be mostly avoided by avoiding playing certain ways. If you don't care enough, then play however you want
---
I don’t know what to feel but you did the right thing, for not buying this.
---
It could be a cosmetic thing like ash having the socks and sandals outfit
---
I just basically farm bloodpoints off of bond at this point
---
This is just true 😂
---
Is it addicting to you?
---
Most people on this sub probably have over 2k hrs its a yon of replay and has much as i feel the devs suck they keep adding things that make me want to stay.
---
I mean, it's a comment made in a noed post, and it talks about endgame, where noed exists, and a reply to another comment talking about noed. It's kind of tied to noed by default
---
They’re saying that because his add-ons don’t work because the devs are lazy and didn’t put real effort in. I’m a legion main and honestly I’d recommend playing someone else but since he already spent money they’re not the worst killer in the game. Definitely above leather face.
---
Entittie
---
The thing is most killers get that from day one, so they just enjoy the shit and laugh.
---
I know I when I get the messages, on console so it's a big thing, I've wound someone up so much that they are titled.
---
My job is done.
---
I do, once every 4 survivor games.
---
Your ping is Snoop Dogg?
---
Only Use the first half of your power gauge to get around the map. Never use it all. His map control is sorta like Spirits.
---
This happened with Trapper when he finishes putting traps down a few updates ago, it’ll probably be fixed in a few updates
---
I almost always need bond. It’s such a great perk. Underrated
---
Go big or go tunnel.
---
What if someone plays a killer game once every 5 games or 3 games? Are they a bad person?
---
JenDenise was known for it. There was a big uproar at the start of the year about her deranking, then bullying lowrank killers with swf with old DS and flashlights
---
Right? Yesterday I hooked a guy and literally saw a damn Claudette coming for him (she was being stealthy) so I was trying to find her around. Got called a camper after. Like...I SAW you. I literally saw you there so I was going around trying to get your ass, that's not camping, that's you going for the save and me seeing you.
---
We got Danny, which is way better.
---
If your argument is about point gen, killing survivors fast and effectively is the total opposite of the point. A slug billy can end a match with 5k points in 2 minutes, black pip, 4k.
---
The ESSENCE of playing killer in DBD is about laying on pressure and map control.
---
If you want to KILL every match, just facecamp the first survivor you down and tunnel them. When NOED pops, do the same to the second survivor.
---
Congrats, you're hitting the 2/4 killrate as killer, effectively "winning" every match.
---
Except you and I know that isn't how you *really* play killer.
---
Why would they release the pig skins separately?
---
I have seen other comments saying you used the perk too early, and it was indeed a fraction of a second too early. However, the hit shouldn't have connected. You were pulled back after using dead hard, and the killer was pulled towards you as well to make the hit look more convincing  (this is what they did with the recent patch to stop people from complaining about hitboxes). 
---
This does not only happen when using dead hard. I got hit many times while fast vaulting a window and pulled back close to the window to make the hit look like it was supposed to hit. 
---
You were either lagging or ... hmmm was a victim of hitboxes being broken.
---
WHY THE FUCK DOES EVERY KILLER HAVE LAG SO I LAG INTO A FUCKING WALL AND GET HIT?
---
Struggling with this spirit walk thing it seems more of a hindrance am I not using it right
---
Especially good against a pack of rabid cursing Claudettes
---
That definitely won't happen though. We already have confirmation on 4 more chapters and more things like Archives/Rifts.
---
If anything content production is going up.
---
Its not that I didn't know how to drop, I couldn't drop him because he losing connection
---
HONESTLY LATELY IVE BEEN HAVING A LOT OF SUCCESS WITHOUT BBQ ON MY BILLY. PUT POP GOES THE WEASEL TO ADD EXTRA GEN PRESSURE WITH RUIN
---
Kind of just running around chasing noises lol
---
Hun.. your balance is negative
---
If they're not supposed to loop, what ARE they supposed to do?
---
i’m going to art school to learn how to draw like this
---
what
---
They did not specify what the reward would be. You’ve taken it upon yourself to be disappointed in their offering. You feel entitled to a greater reward for the effort put forth. Saying you “find it funny” that it was “lackluster” is exactly what I am referring to when I say you feel others should be entitled to more.
---
Maybe 10 hours of survivor. I got turned off it pretty quickly because off what I percieved to be other survivors being stupid. Like I was fixing a gen and another survivor comes up, doesnt help with the gen and just stands there watching. Or the survivor with a med kit fixing a gen while I'm next to them in need of a heal.
---
Angry fuckin furry. A lot of furries are on mixer wonder why.
---
😂mate one of y’all streamers called me a stream sniper for being too good get outa here with your nonsense the only streamers that are respectable are killer streamers and non toxic streamers .
---
GAME FINISHED UPDATING TWEBTY MINUTES AGO WITH BUG FIXES, AND NOW THERE IS A BUG THAT CAUSE ME TO NOT SEE AURAS AS KILLER, IT REALLY PISSES ME OFF THAT NEW GAMEBREAKING BUGS KEEP ARRPEAING
---
Survivors who complain about noed are just salty because they cannot hide / juke well in the end game. Once all gens are powered, that's your time to go. anything else you do that puts you in danger of noed is your fault yo.
---
The guy never said anything about camping or tunneling, just that he turned off post game chat, and you feel the need to insult him and call him an asshole. The only toxicity here is the toxicity *you* brought.
---
You’re not a toxic survivor. You’re just toxic, all someone did is say they just disabled post game chat and you went and assumed they were tunneling and called them a douchebag for no reason.
---
Instead of being paired with each other they're just going to be paired with one of the Tapp skins.
---
They probably thought it was weird that two different skins for same character were released at the same time
---
AN INTERESTING IDEA BUT I FIND MY BIGGEST ISSUE IS STOPPING THE INITIAL GEN RUSH BEFORE ANYONE IS ON A HOOK. ONCE I CAN KEEP 2-3 TIED UP AT A TIME THINGS ARE NOT NEARLY SO BAD.
---
Funny enough, “Sephiroth” and “Brunette Kate” have the same number of syllables!
---
Nvm in there perk description it says the the healing bonus cannot exceed 100%
---
Well as a mostly killer player I liked the sound of that... Gonna be joyful until it gets fixed
---
Lol it was now or never for me at that point.
---
“I’m a bad bitch you can’t kill me”
---
Actually complete randomness have the chance to produce results like we’re seeing. 
---
This is similar to when people complained about the iPod shuffle not being random enough and causing the player to play the same or similar songs too frequently and outright ignoring others. 
---
The problem wasn’t that is WASN’T random, it was that it WAS random and people didn’t like the results, so Apple had to adjust its algorithm to be pseudo-random, and favor songs that haven’t been played in a while over ones that have. 
---
Randomness does not imply a lack of order or pattern - and the fact that we’re observing a pattern, i.e BBQ never shows up, doesn’t mean it isn’t random. 
---
Let’s picket BHVR and tell them we want LESS randomness!! 
---
==
---
On another note that might be giving them too much credit. Knowing how popular the perk is they may intentionally be holding it back to incentivize people to play more to unlock it the good ol’ fashioned way...
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
That issue is so specific, how the hell do you even break that?
---
&gt;Why are survivors not told to behave a certain way,
---
The comments on my steam profile calling me a cheating gen-rusher say otherwise.
---
It was all planned
---
sorry you can't comprehend it, just tunnel idc.
---
i've noticed that the bleedout timer doesnt really go down, even when you're not chasing a survivor. is there something im missing or is it a glitch?
---
😂😂😂 making a lot of assumptions about someone you haven't met.
---
Cough*cough* Ochiido*cough*Cough
---
That’s just for WMI because unhookin multiple people in one activation of the perk simply refreshes the duration and doesn’t stack the speed buff. 
---
Tbh you can using a timer and try it in KYF.
---
I also find it inconsistent. It feels like he could be in the center of my screen, and nothing happens.
---
this was a wild ride from start to finish
---
You can try Huntress, you will need to practice her hatchets, but it will pay off
---
1. She has a very high skill ceiling, a lot of rank 1 killers play Huntress, shes not Nurse level but she  is able to be really good
---
2. Shes playable from the beggining of the game (you dont need to buy her)
---
3. Playing her is extremely satisfying, especially when you see a hatchet give a survivor that nice *SLAP*
---
Also Billy is really good, easy to play AND top tier killer, simple yet effective
---
You can also try Shape, although he needs to be bought for real money, he is also good killer, he isnt Nurse or Billy level, but he is definitely a good killer to play both for begginers and experienced players.
---
Myers is good when you want a killer good, but not top tier, preety simple, with mediocre/high skill ceiling. He has also A LOT of diffirent ways to play, you can be sneaky boi with literally no terror radius all the time (M&amp;A) or 1 hit KO murder machine
---
Do a kill your friends by yourself, and spend time just traveling through the map learning how to turn properly while using chainsaw. A scary billy is one that can be at any point in the map in just a matter of moments.
---
Someone PayPal me 5$ so I can unlock the cannibal and get bbq and chilli
---
Why do you think it should stay directional? In high ranks all they do is sprint away, as soon as they hear it.  This helps console players, harder to hit survivors with a controller, get closer to them and possibly shorten chases with an already slow killer. PC she is upper mid tier, on consoles she is low tier due to fps drops and harder controls. I think this is a nice QOL to her!
---
You’re missing something. Killer doesn’t see it tick down and it doesn’t tick down when the survivor mends. People said it was a nerf but deep wound is useless and always has been so you don’t need to know where the bleed out is at.
---
You do realize that gates take like 15-20 seconds to open right? That totems take less that 20 seconds? You only NEED one or two loops and then you should be good or it's on your team.
---
All I'm hearing is "wah, the killer has an advantage in a 1v1 situation!
---
Would you cry if the enemy had an advantage when outnumbering you 4 to 1 in Call of Duty? Because that's what 1v1 is.
---
The Reunion is nigh! Lady Kate will lead us to the Promise Land, aka the hatch.
---
Or a "Just a Lil Bit" Monto shirt for Jake
---
who’s crouching in front of Nea?
---
GIVE US PINHEAD!!!!!
---
Most of the people with ttv in their names normally have like 3 viewers. (Also, having ttv in your name makes me less likely to watch your stream btw)
---
If your point is to earn as many points in one match, you may be right. However, I would argue finishing matches quickly allows you to get into a new one quicker, therefore getting more points. 
---
You are right about the essence of the killer, but we both know killers don’t play like that the same reason survivors don’t act terrified of the killer and instead loop them around pallets, there are more efficient ways to handle things. 
---
You assume every killer that uses noed is unable to get any kills before it activates, which is rarely the case, especially after the EGC came out, which even lets the killer activate it sooner. 
---
Winning is about getting kills and/or points based on the players preference, but that may not always correlate with having fun, the main point of any game.
---
Before ending, I’ll just state I appreciate you actually backing your opinion up, that is a bit rarer then it needs to be here.
---
You can unlock Hag with shards though while you are forced to pay for leatherface
---
Read is light years harder to see than those stupid belts randomly flying everywhere
---
I'm sorry but getting "avoid me" takes an insane amount of reports, not accusing you of anything because what you are saying is possible but there is most likely something else that has to do with you're getting "avoid me" status.
---
How does one bait a hit on a hooked survivor?  What are you even talking about?  If you were that close to the hook you'd know the killer had NOED because they'd down you lol.
---
Got a 1 min 30 sec once
---
I know I might sound like a hardcore killer main, and yes I play killer more then survivor, but survivors are toxic way more often than killers
---
Not huntress locker its OUR locker
---
YOUVE GOT RUIN TO STOP THE INITIAL RUSH. IF YOU CAN GET JUST 1 SURVIVOR B4 RUIN IS POPPED, POP GOES THE WEASEL WILL HELP ADD MORE PRESSURE AND IN CASE UR RUIN GETS CLEANSED POP GOES THE WEASEL CAN CONTINUE TO APPLY SOME GEN PRESSURE. REMEMBER IT TAKES REGRESSES A GEN BY 25%. THATS A LOT OF REGRESSION.
---
To the killer it shouldn't matter, as the survivors should also assume the killer is only going to kill them as fast as they can. If unenjoyable gameplay is viable as a playstyle for either one it's on bhvr, not the players. Survivors are "supposed" to do gens and whatever objectives they want, but to killers, they're just "supposed" to die.
---
OH SHIT I MISREAD THAT AS WITHOUT RUIN. MB. IS HIGH LEVEL KILLER EVEN FEASIBLE WITHOUT RUIN?
---
I would never do that.  Too much salt to be had
---
I bet you're free BP. I wonder if I've ever put you playing squeaky toy on a hook before.
---
Wraith and Bubba are the easiest killers to start playing and learning the basics of the game with. 
---
Although I'd suggest eventually trying out Billy and/or Huntress. They're mechanically the most difficult killers in the game and feel great when you get the hang of learning their high level tech. Nurse and Spirit are better than both of them, but have some real cheese.  At some point you'll feel like you're playing single player game with how little chance survivors have in a chase when you've become effective with their power. I'd suggest looking into some guides on YouTube if you're going to pick up Billy/Huntress because there's definitely things that you won't pick up on without a bunch of time into the game.
---
Sure :)
---
I know, but I'm willing to bet the people that downvoted probably fall somewhere inside of the observations I have made.
---
The latest employees at Bomb Corp.
---
I got through the exit gate but it wouldn't let me escape, when I reached the end I fell and then teleported back to where I was
---
Exactly the same happened to me:(
---
Exit gates are way easier to find than the totem. You don't just SPAWN on top of it. Usually you won't even find it in the 3 minutes you have, possibly because the killer hooked the person right by it, and now you're shit out of luck
---
You can't honestly tell me that people manage to find the totem as soon as it spawns more often than it just stays up and people leave
---
Also
---
&gt;wah, the killer has an advantage in a 1v1 situation
---
The killer should never have an unfair advantage purely based on a perk. Especially not an overwhelming one such as noed, because it skewers game balance
---
If you’re not supposed to tunnel, what CAN you do as a m1 killer at red ranks?
---
Or even surveillance
---
*What.*
---
Friendly reminder that dead by daylight is a perfect game
---
Easy, survivor unhooks someone, go after the one who unhooked. IMO its only tunneling if its off hook.
---
I've been playing ash since I got him (2 days ago), and I've had a more positive escape record. 
---
Used to be an ace main, now I'm an ash main.
---
I agree, man. The streamer hate here is unreal and based on no evidence that I have seen. 
---
Even watching larger streams than my own--even by people named in this thread--I don't see this toxicity they talk about. 
---
If a Killer swings wildly and misses or gets spun--a good streamer will comment on that play. And yeah, sometimes the comment is aggressive. It is entertainment. For 1 viewer or 1000s--it doesn't matter. 
---
These guys seem to want people to sit silently at their desks and just worry-sweat about their pips.
---
ive never seen glowing like that in game, whats it from??
---
The hag will eat the ice cream from inside you so it's technically sharing.
---
No ones feeling attacked here. These downvotes are actually hilarious
---
Why is Feng so jacked? lol
---
A map with a marker add on. Only survivors can see it. Very useful for sharing the location of hatches or other important items.
---
100% this. Survivors BP farming perk could use some actual utility like BBQ
---
Alert/Dark Sense/Object with the caveat of MoM tagged on the end where you're permanently visible to the killer outside a certain range (24m for this one?), it would give the distraction players an advantage for their shenanigans and get rid of the lull that sometimes happens at the start of the game where 3 gens pop without the killer ever seeing anyone
---
The amount of times I've had a survivor explode out of a locker when I go to grab hatchets is insane. I sometimes find survivors I didn't even know I was looking for!
---
Thank you for actually having a discussion with me. My logic for the first, is that it's still 5 totems you need to cleanse, you just know you aren't wasting your time cleansing dulls. But I understand that it may be too much.
---
The reason I had it be like PWYF instead of STBFL is because it would make it so you need to be 100% sure you land the hit, giving you a chance as survivor to make them wiff/lose stacks
---
There are other ways to use wraith than camping hooks, here are some examples:
---
If you come kick a gen and know a survivor is nearby but can’t find them, just act like you’re walking away then stand still, they’ll likely come back and then you strike.
---
If the survivor is looping you extremely well, just cloak and act like you’re going away.  When the survivor leave the loop uncloak and hit them.
---
Sneak up on survivors working on generators and get a free hit, try to block possible escapes when you uncloak like windows or pallets.
---
I used to use wispers a lot (and sometimes still do) and I just imagine the entity being like "yes warmer warmer no wait no cold cold... warmer warmer... HOT HOT yes you found her!"
---
At least bond is really good, calm spirit is meh
---
That's... What i said...
---
No, it shows they are playing the game by the established rules, as the devs intended, and that they play to win. I enjoy winning. Why should I sacrifice my fun for the sake of made up player rules? If you dont have fun and someone isnt cheating, then maybe this isnt the game for you.
---
It just means the survivor is really stealthy and avoids the killer.
---
For sure. But if this happens every game, then it may not be randomly running into the same guy. Plus, unless everyone has the same name and same cosmetic on the team, it's not hard to be like "oh this is the meg I just hooked"
---
It’s highly inconsistent. I’ve been staring him down in the center of my screen and nothing happens, but I’ve also panned the camera around while doing gens and knocked him out without even knowing where he is. It needs work.
---
I mean it’s really not that bad-
---
Swind plz
---
I didn't say all were not bad. So e are absolute pieces of garbage. Just not all of us. It's like saying all DBD players are toxic. It's just not true.
---
The killer has not failed in the match when 5 gens are done. The match is still not over. That is my point, that is the only point I'm making.
---
If gens are getting done WAY too fast, you're taking WAY too long to down survivors.
---
Basically like acting like you’re really being chased by a killer and you’re constantly hiding and too scared to do the objective in fear you’ll die, or at least that’s my definition for it
---
A survivor who is immersed spends the game being stealthy and avoiding the killer. As you get points for looping and being chased, its often frowned upon.
---
Ecery killer main suck anyway it don't make a difference
---
Damn, I was hoping they would leave Furtive Chase alone, it was a lot of fun using it with Rancor in the previous version.
---
I honestly don’t know why No0b3 isn’t mentioned more.
---
Yes his ping is snoop dogg. That’s the joke. That’s it. There’s nothing else to it.
---
I agree but with my 2 games with streamers I really have a grudge against SURVIVOR SWF TOXIC STREAMERS to the point of bringing a mori with hillbilly and a isn't a chainsaw
---
Ya I was about to say that-
---
And he’s right
---
Go strap a bomb to your chest.
---
Theres a difference between something they never thought would be a thing (not intended) compared to “Oh we havent made a clip for a rock yet.” 
---
Fortnites devs didn’t know building would be used to start fights, they thought it was a good traversal strategy. They didn’t intend building to be used that way, but its not an exploit. 
---
I don’t know if I am making sense really, but I see a clear difference between a skill gap to a no clipping rock changing a loop when taken advantage of.
---
Killers walks up to this, looks on in disbelief, and immediately DC's.
---
Jesus Christ man, just do it! Don't give a fuck about what the sanctimonious karma police label you on this sub
---
So the 2 community skins we are getting is 1 skin for the wraith and 1 skin for her? I am so disapointed
---
 Ooh spicy! I need to try this 
---
 Bro you need to delete this before more people find out lmao
---
I mean he’s not wrong people will play the way they want to play
---
That's if they have noed or if they even target you. If they target the other person, the borrowed kicks in and you both get out. If they target you, it depends on your ability to lose them and reach a door
---
That’s how it should work tho. You’re telling me they just stunned you without knowing where you are?
---
Haha I won't change don't worry haha. It was just using it as a example as lots of others do it too.
---
That's a slap with no hands lol
---
I dont like to camp and I hate campers, but I just accept, I don't quit and send message about it.
---
after a minute of the killer standing still they shouldn't have any collision to be honest
---
I dont play Wraith at all so this is good information. Thank you
---
No, they aren't community skins. These were found in the game files and revealed by the devs before the contest even started.
---
Lol I know right but I think it need to be fixed.
---
As dickish as it is he’s right.
---
from my experience when people get unhooked they literally run into my face just so they can use decisive
---
By the time someone flashlights you you should already be out of Night Shroud
---
He's right tho
---
Thanks for this! So I would agree with this, if it wasnt comparing things from heights/lunges. This happens on tractors and etc, and I view that differently. 
---
What I have a problem with, is a rock that has CLIPPINGS for survivors heights, but not for killers, and they can literally just walk up it, is different from a lunge from above. 
---
Maybe thats me being very picky, but something thats clipped for one side by just walking is a bit annoying and imo an exploit 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
What rank tho
---
Distressing and insidous lol
---
But still, GG.
---
Survivors: killers shouldn’t expect to 4K every game it’s unrealistic and you’re stupid if you think you should do that
---
Also Survivors: if the Killer doesn’t 4k before the gens are done he’s trash and failed at his job
---
TBH he's right.  Why don't you guys just do gens while he's camping?  If he wants to lose and get a 1k then that's his thing.  If he has fun that way so be it.
---
If you have less than 300 hours, people see you as a “baby player”
---
People start to respect you when you have above 1k
---
Oh thanks chuck norris! I was so sad i really want to see the skin i want
---
That’s not my point this would be fine by itself but now pretty much anything breaks you of of night shroud and it still takes 30 seconds to get your power back and that’s crazy
---
Well Ninja, on behalf of us non-toxic, low salt streamers: I apologize for those assholes.
---
Literally can't use it.
---
nice July 4th is more rework Freddy
---
Thanks for the help, man. But I’m pretty sure I saw both the Wraith and Huntress skin posted as a concept for the contest? They could’ve just been leaks though that I misinterpreted
---
r/cursedcomments
---
or... I do have an artstation account where I actually post all the stuff I make. 
---
here is the link to my profile:  [https://www.artstation.com/dmpickle](https://www.artstation.com/dmpickle) 
---
so you could credit either or.
---
My girl looking spicy.👌
---
And I brave reality apologize for being a ass to streamers.
---
i’m relatively new to the game. What is tunneling?
---
It wont work against good players though, even if they gen rush and escape they will still de-pip so you are losing either way.
---
he doesn’t understand that i was messing around and he think my drawing was made to be serious lol he’s a sad human who has no one to talk to so he try’s to make other people feel worse.
---
This, but unironically.
---
I think that they were being overly concerned with people being pelted from literal nowhere.
---
It's unnecessary and I'm glad they changed it
---
I hate camping and routing, it's not necessary and you lose bloodpoints  for it so what's the point.
---
i didn’t even utilize even insidious lol
---
[Ok](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/050/209/b01.png)
---
Will they ever put bbq and chili on the shrine?!
---
Wym that's only like 4 weeks away
---
Can you explain the power thing to me as I don't play those killers
---
Like does it just put the power on cool down, or does it make the ability unusable for a time
---
Or is it like a, you loose the charge even if not active yet
---
No he isn’t. It’s really easy too counter him and even when he does stalk someone he has too still become a normal killer and gets looped. He’s high low tier and no where near as good as Myers.
---
I’ll tell you one thing. If a change makes sense, make it.
---
They nerfed Freddy and Doctor, low tier killers, when Legion came out, because the change made sense, not because they needed nerfs, but because it made sense and that’s a good change
---
Yea, just let them heal and run to safety, not like that's counter intuitive to the entire point of the game.
---
Glad to see so many people agreeing that hes right. I'm still waiting for this rulebook all the pro gamers in my inbox have so i know which of their imagery rules i'm breaking.
---
&lt;bug fix patch releases
---
&lt;Don't read
---
&lt;bitch about not having bugfix patches
---
Agreed, being the only one doing gens while everyone else is dying gets tiring, especially when you watch someone get one hooked while the other 2 are crouch walking around and hiding in lockers the entire time :/ 
---
Playing killer is just trying to be a better survivor than the people you're against and it's kind of peaceful not having to rely on others to help stall the game for points
---
Oh well I just play to win in games
---
I thought that was the hag.
---
Of course brother
---
He’s says “completing generators” not “doing gens”, go read.
---
In South Africa, anything that is below 400 ping is good enough, we barely find matches in this country compared to others 🤷‍♂️
---
Test subject?
---
Yea this has been a thing for a while now, but it seems too have gotten worse. Before it would only show hair, and only long hair at that. Now it shows the whole body. It won’t get fixed but it’s nice too know it’s gotten worse.
---
Oh god I thought that were Austin Powers and Dr. Evil
---
Again killer main jackass. Learn to read. I run doctor or huntress depending on my mood. And in the beginning when you're learning the game yes. After that it's just you being lazy and not wanting to get good
---
No please, end this non sense...
---
See you in the fog, son! Haha
---
&gt; This "reward" isn't awful, and the Shards are nice, sure, it's just... why not a pack of 500 Auric Cells, as well? The least I'd have expected, honestly.
---
This is you not feeling entitled to more. I’m sorry if you don’t understand the definition.
---
Maybe I should clarify my issue with one. My thought is people will instantly know if they need to do totem or not, giving survivors info they shouldn’t have. To me that would feel like going back to SWF telling each other the killers perks once one died.
---
I could be ok with 2 working like PWYF if you got the speed boosts linked to the stacks too.
---
Gen rushing us not a thing. Lack of survivor objectives, yes.
---
360-ing wasn't intended to even be in the game, but the devs decided to keep it.
---
Mate it’s BHVR. They make promises that they always break all the time. This is nothing new. This skin prob won’t come out till next Easter, sorry too say.
---
It's weird, but since the patch it feels way more consistent, it's better now
---
Or to sell Leatherface cause he’s not that amazing of a killer outside of trolling or camping (not that he’s awful, mind!). And Hag to impatient players like me who can’t save 9k shards to save their lives.
---
The backfire in this thread! 
---
Camper is still right tho
---
Not yet, but they are working on it. I think they will fix it with dedicated servers.
---
Tbh I agree with him. At the end of the day it’s a game. If he has fun doing that good for him. You can’t force imaginary rules on people.
---
Give killers weapons that can hit across pallets. And we got a deal.
---
Or, and i repeat that part in caps for you. GASELIGHTING.CROSSED.THE.LINE
---
nothing funny about it, not even a little. and if you think otherwise, god help me if we ever meet each other
---
Huntress already has only a 20m terror radius, what do you want her to have, none?
---
Poised and Dark Sense. Once you complete a gen, you can literally sprint to where the killer isn’t without the chance of being followed (unless killer has bitter murmur)
---
i feel personally attacked
---
Yeah I’ve been having similar matchups. Rank 12 killer and I’m seeing 1-2 red ranks almost every match. Oddly enough I’m still getting 3-4 kills per match.
---
Deal as long as you piggyback baby Dwight’s
---
Bro delete this shit before too many people find out
---
Audio fix finally!
---
I at least think that survivors should be first person in lockers, like the survivor tutorial (IIRC). It would definitely make it more tense and dangerous for survivors to use lockers.
---
Did you at least let them have the escape in the end? Lol
---
I need a blank version of this if anyone has it
---
I find it weird that OP didn’t show his message. Makes you wonder.
---
The wraith one looks fucking sick, but I think the feng costume looks like hot trash(I am ready to be downvoted to hell)
---
homo for me ;)
---
You can edit the images in your files.
---
you can edit your game files on PC
---
True, there’s always two sides to a story
---
Pretty sure it's you can only see him when he gets close enough to you.
---
Main issue? Players bming one another and just being assholes. This game would be plenty better if everyone was more positive to each other and empathetic
---
Remember, the devs said the ideas they gave are just that: ideas, and that we shouldn't get attached to them because the ideas may change.
---
That's when you're awake, he fades in and out when he's near you
---
Nice
---
This happens to me 100% of the time and it annoys the hell out of me.
---
The main issue is it just makes an already strong killer even more strong.
---
Had this with David
---
*becomes a Wraith main*
---
I ABSOLUTELY FUCKING HATE THIS GAME BUT I STILL PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS UNTIL 4 AM BECAUSE ITS FUN BUT SOMETIMES
---
Then I mean, you can see him at any distance when you're asleep now....
---
You can throw axes at me anytime 🥰
---
Friendly reminder SWF should only be put in the matchmaking pool the highest rank there is in.
---
 How this isn't the case is beyond me
---
Me too, I have never seen something as great as this
---
I’ve experienced this as well this morning after the new patch. Playing as Spirit on cold wind
---
Welcome to game development. Where a fix to a bug can break something completely unrelated.
---
If he didn't care, he wouldn't had sent a whole paragraph lol
---
I am guilty of this but not on purpose. I took a break for a couple months and now do not play enough to get back to purple/green ranks I was in before.
---
Only games I've ever had message me on Xbox is Rocket League and Dead by Daylight. I play a lot of shooters, and no one has ever bothered taking their time out of their day, but I get at least one or two salty messages every day I play DBD when I play killer.
---
Ocupado!
---
Yeah I totally got you!  I’ve had that experience before.  Damn flashlights and pallet loops!  I don’t know how to stop it yet!
---
If they have NOED they will definitely target you.  Why wouldn't they?  NOED haste along with your proximity to them by the time you get the unhook off makes it all but impossible for you to get out in that scenario.  If they have NOED you need to find the totem before going for unhooks man.  It's just feeding downs to a noed gamer otherwise.
---
There goes your map pressure, there goes the gens, there goes the survivors.
---
If they have it turned on and they get stunned they either lose it (plague with corrupt purge) or it goes on a 20-30 second cooldown (Ghost/Legion)
---
They lose the charge and it goes on cooldown but only if they're using it while they get stunned.
---
I saw it on Huntress and Hag too maybe Doctor.
---
I mean imma be real, if you catch someone right after you hook a person bitchslap both of them. But you should honestly tunnel the one who’s hook farming.
---
That I am unsure of
---
Ahhhh I see u will fit in just nicely
---
Eh, I don't know, I'm pretty sure it's Freddy.
---
Reality is often disappointing
---
It looks sick. I wish I had a pc :(
---
How *dare* you speak such heresy!
---
He’s pretty bad. He has a lot of Myers in him, but none of the positives. He can’t vault fast, he can be pulled out of stealth, his exposed status can be countered easily, and in the end he’s just an M1 killer with a niche power. He needs buffs badly.
---
Haven't tried this newest patch yet but for audio fixes it specifically mentions headphones emulating surround sound. Now I have been using surround sound speakers and the sounds have been terrible. For instance if I'm playing as Myers I can barely hear when he Tiers up. Was that related to the headphone issue?
---
As if right now while the event is still active, prestige, you get a gatou every bloodweb anyway
---
If i ever experience this im gonna be all pissed because i would have expected to escape.
---
Nah the bloody skins are nice tho
---
If EA got BHVR, bloodpoints and irridescent shards would be purchasable. Then new maps wpuld cost money and they would make skins for 20 dollars that actually make you blend in with the envirement. Also, the game would be ruined, it would just become a total cashgrab. This makes me grateful for BHVR
---
I need that wraith skin
---
Everything is contextual.
---
Did you interrupt *everyone* before their first gen; you have total control of gen progress right now? Are either of the pair the obsession and your perks say to/to not hit or hook the obsession? Is the preferred survivor the only one with a torch?
---
If you're playing with survivors worse than you, you can play with your food before hooking the twice done survivor a third time. I usually do that when I have total control of the pace of the game. You get more emblems &amp; bloodpoints before even thinking about the survivors having a fun time.
---
If you're in a region with ranking that works, I'd probably suggest just getting the match over and done with so you can go up, they can go down, and maybe next time matchmaking will work. Tell the survivors at the end how they could have done better and move on since there are plenty that do know how to play.
---
BM for killers is generally drawing out the game or making it boring by face camping or insidious leatherface basement camping, not *playing the game.* Just don't reward altruism feasting behaviour, because survivors *do* have control over that and shouldn't be rewarded for being bad to their teammates or fucking run borrowed time because I'm sick of being hook farmed.
---
They busted their game with the Plague update months back.
---
I could feel the clench
---
Job security
---
Prestige is also optional and completly on you
---
This has been a thing i can always see kates hair and Claudette’s body
---
Probably why (/s.) exists
---
🏅
---
Claudette must be pretty hairy then, eh?
---
Haha I also like to play like an absolute vagina
---
Kim J Un skin would make me buy clown
---
*pulls at collar* Just got hot in here
---
So I wasnt crazy. Could see their auras across the map lol.
---
Obviously.
---
Did you try to email bhvr? If they respond we know that they should be working on it
---
I can't count the many times I've gotten stuck in a pallet at this point, smh
---
WHY IS MATHIEU COTE SO CUTE
---
Use them all until you save 1 mill bp
---
Tunneling is existing on the map
---
[deleted]
---
IF I GET STUCK IN ONE MORE DAMN PALLET, IM GONNA FUCK UP THAT TEABAGGING TOXIC ASS PIECE OF SHIT NEA
---
If you just stop running and stand still or t-bag, there’s a good chance I’ll just go find someone else to chase
---
did you just reply to your own comment ? lmao
---
I've had deliverance fail on me 3 times recently, and yes, the perk should've worked
---
I hope they fix this, and the Sprint Burst bug, soon.
---
Nope. Don't want none of that :/ or the 'i still struggle' crap. I want to see more motivation from you! I see none of it! 
---
You're doing great!
---
I was but BBQ I would get like 90k a game which would just give me 2 more I used one every game they just kept coming
---
Exactly.  Survivors expect killers to play in a way that gimps them so they can have fun.  Bitch please, I see you running all meta perks and queuing with 3 other friends.  Why should I need the way I play so you can have fun?  I'm only responsible for my own fun, not yours.
---
“Its been there twice this year atleast.”
---
“I see it has appeared once so far”
---
I make good conversation.
---
Big surprise, the killer likes to kill people!
---
Rng being a bitch
---
wraith looks like a totally different killer, almost cthulhu-esque
---
You need to choose if you wish to pressure the unhook (leaving 2 people to work on gens uninterrupted) while keeping two people busy if you're not tunneling (1 busy if you tunnel) or pressure the map leaving you possible 1 person working on gens (unhook taking 2 survivors + the survivor you just chased off a gen).
---
My guess is that you havent leveled huntress in months. It would have the same bloodweb as it did before the changes to them if so. 
---
Otherwise, just a bug.
---
Thanks, and happy cake day
---
Well it’s for cosmetic appearance and perks. Who would be my best survivor purchase for perks?
---
Cringe.
---
Holy shit it's my cake day! Thx for the reminder lol.
---
&gt; in strongest strategy
---
Camping and tunneling ain't it :)
---
thanks for ur opinion
---
It’s much more consistent than pre patch I’ve tested some stuff out due to boredom and it’s much more consistent from both sides there’s not a 100% go to for revealing in a handful of situations (cover stalking, from behind pallets and obstacles, and a long range) but his stalk tends to break pretty easy now, and everyone will shoot the ol “center of my screen” around but what they tend to not mention is his center needs to be the center not him in general try to get a large portion of him close to the center of the screen rather than just anything you can
---
Well yeah that’s the point of thana. It’s to force survivors to heal. Good survivors usually play through not healing unless the killer has thana
---
When your in your power. Don’t need to be crouched, at least before the update. Never actually looked into what they changed.
---
I’ll be honest, I’ve already bought costume.
---
It’s been shit. Literally can’t play with out disconnecting... I thought it was my internet so I upgraded and paid for the top of the line router n connection. Turns out it’s dbd... 🤦🏻‍♀️🙄
---
You clearly don’t know the more advanced tech that goes into him.Nurse only has blink she has to learn but billy still has to deal with looping which opens mind games and doing tricky shit with his chainsaw like the curving you can do at the beginning of his sprint.
---
“OMG you 12 hooked us? Fucking tunneler camper I reported u scrub”
---
MOTHERFUCKING NURSE CAMPED AND TUNNELED ME ON CONSOLE. BRO HOW BAD CAN YOU BE THAT YOU CHASE ME THE ENTIRE GAME AND CAMPED AND TUNNELED ME BECAUSE I CLEANSED YOUR FUCKING RUIN.
---
Honestly this skin is just a bit worse than his Halloween one. It's cool, but the Halloween one has the same wood/root/twig thing going on. It also just has a better body with the hole you can see through. The face of this one is awesome, but the body is a bit uncomfortable smooth.
---
THE STAIRS ON COLDWINDS FARMHOUSE DONT ACTIVATE BALANCED LANDING. FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Activating Night Shroud
---
Ok buddy, not like just about all survivors do that. He camped all game
---
It had its problems too and was not well received at the time but...at least I knew during the game if I was winning or not. Right now there's a complete disconnect between the actual game and what the game thinks you should do to win.
---
Yeah ok, whatever helps you sleep at night.
---
I’ve seen all of these perks, besides bk, I. The shrine so many times now
---
As soon as I saw the frosty eyes, I knew you had NOED in your perks without even having to look at it
---
I'm sick of the people who still want skins that would be trash anyway (Shirtless Myers, Bunny Feng etc.) I hope bhvr keeps up not releasing these cosmetics cuz the community needs to learn that they cant always get what they want and cry when their wish doesnt come true
---
On PC you can change all the icons to whatever you’d like
---
?
---
That's shenpai's survivor/killer icon pack for dead by daylight  
---
N00b3 made a video on how to DL them and import them to your dbd files if you're interested.  
---
The link is below

---
I give the hatch to survivors that burned a cake or a BPs, if I can figure out who did
---
I'm actually a survivor main but I R1 killer every month.  Interesting reaction to a suggestion.
---
That's the spirit!
---
Per Cambridge, the primary definition of entitlement is a "right", which if you can show me where I in the literal sense assumed or spoke of a right of anyone to a better reward, please do so.
---
A secondary meaning of the word is "the feeling that you have the right", which, I also did not anywhere express my feeling that people have or even just should have a right to a better reward. An expectation can be purely speculative, rather than entited: entitlement would be me saying "that's the least these players should have gotten, BHVR essentially scammed them, there might even be recourse against the time wasted on this experiment the reward of which was not adequate to their promises, legal or social, etc."; speculatively expectative thinking on the other hand is literally what I meant, though, which is "I assumed (expected) there would be a better reward, given that BHVR talked about wanting to give back to players, that it's the anniversary, that these players used their time to apply and participate in an experiment that benefits BHVR, that they can dash out content or cells without themselves actually, directly having to pay a cent, etc.".
---
Waiting at a pallet to get a stun off is something any killer who's learnt to not respect pallets will punish. 2-3 seconds lost from standing at a pallet can mean the difference between making it to the next loop or not. There's also plenty of loops where 3 seconds is enough to run round it again.
---
While it is irritating, I agree. If SOMETHING is getting done, I don’t mind playing extremely safe if it means that hooking me for a long time gets us ahead.
---
YOU CAN DEPIP FROM KILLERS DISCONNECTING UFCK
---
Well he has a minecraft lets play, its just like 10 years ago that he started it
---
NOED GAE
---
true tho
---
The one to the left of ghostface's Power? I played when moonlight was around and don't remember that
---
Ladies and gentleman, a man who’s never played against Leatherface.
---
The fancy black hair, the medusa body, and lettuce arm best hag outfit
---
I've thought of something similar, every prestige level offers an additional perk on bloodweb.
---
Also, the shrine could have a reroll, pay 500 shards, or even blood points, to offer 4 new perks. Or maybe even another button, where you can pay for a random perk you don't own.
---
Yeah, just started playing. Must be a bug, thank you.
---
Shrine is random tho.
---
I can't see gen auras at all so, yeah it's pretty fuckin busted
---
Happened to a mate on xbox too.
---
I was like you 1 week ago and in the end I chose Ash , and he is quite cool . So yea , I say that you should consider him as an option .
---
Teabag penalty.
---
Whoa, what? What killer what perks? All?
---
What in the goddamn fuck
---
*fact*
---
I mean this is established already
---
I PLAYED AGAINST A MYERS WHO CAMPED AND TUNNELED ALL GAME, DENIED IT AFTERWARDS AND AFTER CHECKING HIS STEAM PROFILE I SAW AT LEAST FIFTEEN COMMENTS SAYING HOW HE IS A CAMPER LMAO
---
Prostate - too far up your own arse.
---
Hag with sloppy and ruin, then i tried billy with enduring, tinkerer, spirit, and iron grasp. Both of which i couldn't see gen or hook auras
---
U got the 200 ❤
---
I never knew that clowns play dbd
---
right?? in my country they’re 20 bucks which is higher than the game’s price on the sale right now
---
Some real early bloodwebs just don't have Perks for some reason
---
Dude , if you try a little bit you can almost change every texture from this game with cooler ones ( custom textures) . If you are interested try r/PerkByDaylight .
---
Getting kills is the entire point, it is called a KILLer for a reason, not a chaser or slasher. Your goal is to kill all 4 survivors to the best of your ability.
---
Yeah, if you get 5 on devour, you weren’t exactly in a bad way
---
Get Jane she dummy thicc
---
It's for when you're carrying a survivor as killer; it replaces your item/power on your HUD.
---
i feel like the legion would eat ice cream with you, they are the closest ones to not being straight up insane
---
It's just now mid 2018 though.
---
Are you talking about the friend zone? No one said OP's best friend is a dude (and even then, get out of here with that friend zone bs)
---
PEOPLE DON'T REALISE THAT FENG MIN'S FIRST NAME IS MIN SINCE SHE IS CHINESE SO THEY HAVE BEEN CALLING HER BY HER SURNAME ALL THIS TIME
---
Get up to the million cap and use the points on other killers til you're out.then prestige with 1 mil BP at the ready
---
The Wraith skin looks great, but a scarecrow killer would’ve been cool too.
---
Shirtless Myers would ruin the character.  I'm adamant that he should remain untouched.  Give Pig or anyone else the jarringly out of place beach party skin vibe, but not Mike.
---
Yes. You definitely nailed it.
---
Can you get these on console?
---
Ah yes, the cute ballerina outfit, time to give the devs even more money! ~~Also her first name is Min~~
---
mori me daddy.
---
i mean, probably for you... for me its okay and i actually hate instagram and tik tok.
---
Don't forget that he has addons that change his detection range and other details about it, but still i think it's kinda inconsistent too.
---
I PURCHASED FREDDY LIKE SIX MONTHS AGO BUT THE ENTITY IS STILL LIKE "HEY HAVE A FEW SMOKING SPLINTERS TO AID YOU ON YOUR STRUGGLES" SUCK MY TOES
---
Camping and tunneling aren't the best strategies.
---
If the survivors are competent and see that you are camping, they'll just blast through gens while you are putting out 0 pressure on the map. 
---
They'll probably be running DS/BT too, so by tunneling the unhooked guy you'll often waste a ton of time.
---
You have to buy them
---
You mean angry pug gets angry? WhaAaaAaAat
---
Sometimes I do. I’m not a terrible killer, but sometimes I’ll run a shitty toxic build for no reason
---
Ok, is their any other way to pay for a killer or is it just with money and auric cells
---
All they need to do is make it so it goes to the higher level and not lower. Super easy fix, the devs just suck
---
Ahem -- I get to take a page out of NEARLY EVERYONE'S playbook here:  
---
YOU DO NOT GET TO TELL ME OR ANYONE ELSE HOW TO PLAY THE GAME.
---
You can't get on your high fucking horse and be like "I don't play by the Survivor's playbook!"  or 
---
"KILLERS ARE TRYHARD SWEATLORDS"  and then say something like this.   It's hypocritical
---
and I guarantee you've done something in your game that slighted someone else at least once.
---
People give survivors shit for "gen rushing", looping and using certain perks/items.
---
It goes both ways.
---
You can buy some killers with shards you get from leveling up
---
not spending 40 lvl in characters you won't play
---
That's very well done
---
[ heartbeat intensifies ]
---
You can pay cold cash through the various stores. I think it works out cheaper than doing it with auric cells if I'm.mot mistaken.
---
Spirit ass
---
You can use Iridescent Shards to buy the original killers, with the DLC you need to pay with money
---
Nice.
---
Shards can be used for non licensed killers like hag doctor etc etc all licensed are cold cash though
---
I did that shit the other day.... the killer just happened to be walking past where I was, with no way to actually see me. I was so mad at myself for wasting my sprint burst lmao. I'm a veteran P3 Meg for fucks sake, I KNOW BETTER THAN THIS
---
Myers you can only hear his breathing
---
Ghost face has a sound that can be heard starting at 8 metres (Used to be 16, and there also used to be a global sound queue when Ghostface entered stealth, like Michael tiering up)
---
Yeah I'll give that to you.  His addons definitely need a rework to create some incentive to use them.  The only ones I really prefer on him are extended duration and increased detection.
---
I just played a match where the survivors left their last four gens within seeing/hearing distance from each other and only had two gens left. Then proceed to tbag while I chased and pointed from across palettes. I make the strategic decision to not follow the toxic Feng on a chase across the map where no gens were and to turn around and get the other person I could clearly see working on the gen next to me. This continued for awhile but ultimately they didn’t work as a team to rush one gen, they all just hopped between gens and eventually gave up and stood there while I took them out. I let the one person who actually tried their best go. Even let him finish the gen and showed him the hatch in the end because I felt bad about his team (two dc’d after one hook) Lowandbehold the tbagger was complaining about me “camping gens.” Again, poor decisions and they are trying to blame me. 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
&gt; It's just the control button! Why get sO uPsEt!?
---
&gt; 
---
**-** clowns
---
I love how Monto already has a house (same goes for his girlfriend), a stable food, quite a few resources out of the mines and even diamonds and after two episodes Noob is still struggling with a few mobs and just barely manages to build a small shack lmao
---
Be me : not playing enough in a month to rank up and every game is easy win.
---
MOM KILLED THE DOG WITH BURRITOS
---
my response is "yeah, have fun grinding another 50 bloodwebs for bbq and ruin"
---
Or if another survivor leaves in the beginning of the match, it’s mad annoying
---
Base Nurse isn't too bad so long as you use LoS breakers properly. When I play it's on console so I cant really play her properly, but I've been playing Evil Reptilian in Identity V, and breaking LoS while being unpredictable hurts him a lot, like it hurts base nurse. Its the addons that are crazy as I understand it
---
Hopefuly we get a fall event
---
Damn I thought that was fixed I haven’t had that happen in over a year maybe even a year and a half
---
Someone who wins a lot of games are the respectful ones, the ones who rarely escape or have a game go their way will find a way to make the killer seem like he was camping or something and making excuses, followed be being toxic for no reason. This is coming from a survivor main
---
THEY WERE ACTUALLY FUN! DIDN’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BULLSHIT PERKS.
---
I wish.
---
I played a game where I would have pipped if I camped so rip (got one more sacrifice)
---
No to both. They're just not very good ideas
---
Your mom and dad don't count.

I don't get mad at people for being upset when I tunnel and camp them.
---
I get mad at people when they accuse me of tunneling and camping them when I clearly didn't. 
---
It's always someone else's fault, isn't it? :/
---
Wait, he isn't a dog catcher?
---
Just drop the "K" people get so damn made about that letter.
---
Damn, that Myers was an asshole, I would give u the hatch, I know that was a bug and u should escape.
---
But well, Idk if u were toxic along the game tho...
---
I feel the struggle lol I have few cakes and BPS yet, using them all before the prestige 2.
---
1. no
---
2. no
---
3. thats would be annoying af
---
Oof. Didn't know. But no harm.
---
People's definition of tunnelling and camping have gotten distorted. If the injured guy off the hook is the easier down of course ill go for them.  If patrolling a quarter of the map and getting back to hook quickly off of unhook is camping then idk what to say
---
Tru3 complains about everything
---
I'm still decently new (2 weeks) and my only issue is that you hardly ever get good teammates when you play solo. I'm rank 8 rn, and everyone still plays like rank 15-20. 3-4ks for the killers almost every game. And none of my friends play so I have to play solo.
---
I mean that's just what software development is. It's a well known fact that eliminating all bugs is impossible.
---
same lol, i always have a perfect loadout by lvl 15 or im stuck running sloppy unrelenting bitter murmur whispers til  50+
---
No Mither buff would be broken. Instead, should be this:
---
Start the trial healthy. When downed, earn the ability to recover to injured state once. Remain broken for the remainder of the trial. No bloodpools and reduced grunts of pain for the remainder of the trial.
---
Did you spend a lot of BP on Ghost Face past level 50? To collect all these cakes.
---
There is definitely an element of truth to this. Most killers are at a disadvantage against a perfectly organized team. To be clear, by advantage I mean comparing the killer to the collective power of the four survivors working together.  
---
In the games current state, 54% of PC players are solo queue. The average survival rate, even for a 4-man SWF is around 49%, with lower group sizes dying more often. Survival rates are better at higher rank, but as low as 35% at the bottom ranks. The problem here is that balancing everything for a 4-man rank 1 SWF lobby would kill the game. Solo queue low rank survivors are at an incredible disadvantage already. What they need to do is give killers access to higher level mechanics, or different counter-play options against high rank survivor strategies. The solution of just having one killer that is powerful enough to deal with these problems is a terrible one.  
---
Most of these problems won't be solved until they find a way to narrow the gap between solo queue and SWF. If that means giving players access to more info by default and re-balancing around that, then that's what needs to happen.
---
The nea that got stuck didn't teabag tho
---
Promise I wasn’t, Myers was camping the whole game and we all barely made it out. That’s why I teabagged
---
i saw a post like this yesterday but talking about camping and tunneling..
---
It's just at high ranks hiding behind some trees near a gen doesn't work because they can hear the grass moving
---
And if you're spotted you start the chase with one less health state to deal with.
---
Running chase perks and beelining to tiles, then there's no confusion on what's happening. You can have survivors and killer always see each other and still have a tense game
---
I understand the unfun aspect of Mori, but if you could only use it after 2nd hook it becomes virtually worthless. Yeah you don't need to go and physically hook them with all those risks but eh. Why even run it over a point offering unless it's all you have.
---
Thanks ! Really good work, couldn't find the patch anywhere
---
That's normally the Halloween one right? I think we're still getting a summer event
---
Still no bunny Feng! &gt;:(
---
yes for the killersm not for the survivors.
---
But you get a 10% reduction in efficiency when you get 1 extra person on a gen. It balances out; 2 people on a gen = 100% efficiency from both people. You get 100% efficiency by doing a gen solo.
---
:P
---
I pretty much exclusively play survivor, and thought that most killers were op. Played killer for the first time in a while and forgot how difficult it was. 
---
Huge respect to all of the killer mains out there.
---
Zubat got banned on his old account, I doubt there is a realistic chance of him getting a cosmetic.
---
yes, i bet you main killer ? that why you say this :)
---
Woah
---
You think so? With only a month and a half of summer left? I would definitely be surprised. But yeah All-hallows Eve event
---
updoot for surreal
---
I love facing prayerbeads spirits. When they hang someone and you repair a gen, walk away and they will probably check on the gen and waste their power and stuff.
---
Trash at the end
---
Frosty eyes Legion? I hope someone brought small game!
---
So how come I can see sillouettes of survivors through gen auras? Kind of OP Lol
---
I don't usually do these, but...
---
Sad oink :c
---
They should give you the perks you have available for what ever the killer you are using it on has.
---
Tunelling isn't toxic. Survivors don't have a handicap. Stop being so salty.
---
Oh god
---
That’s the spirit
---
No. It's easier to wiggle with the stick. It's way more responsive. Plus RT and LT get so much use in other games, that I am happy this game doesn't require much use out of it.
---
i know it’s cringe
---
Once shortly after it came out and a second time about 3 months ago give or take a few weeks
---
I play both sides with more hours on survivor than killer and this is a terrible idea.  If you’re going to make a change to how moris work it should be changed so you can only mori the survivor if their next hook would be their death.  Simple fix.
---
¿Yeah! That's what I thought?! , I don't know what a Snoop Dogg ping is like though!¿
---
Never? Or at least I can't remember.
---
it describes all my posts
---
she does have some balance issues
---
The top picture reminds me of Scary Movie 2 when Shorty gets his head cut open
---
\*keeps running\*
---
Like someone said just spin the stick in a circle does the same exact wiggle progression and less wear and tear
---
Maybe it's a reference to Amanda being one of the victims in Jigsaw's game?
---
I think the shirt she's wearing in that skin is a slightly changed version of the one she was wearing when she had the reverse beartrap on her head.
---
Just use unbreakable then. You can be healed to full, and since in both of them you could only pick yourself up once, at least unbreakable can do it 35% faster.
---
Upvoted for being shirtless.
---
is this a thing?
---
OK, so I have no idea how to gauge pings, what is considered high and low?
---
i play legion \*vault noises\*
---
I’ve got my eyes on deliverance
---
there is a block feature you realize that right? not saying this is ok, just saying you could have stopped it but didnt
---
I noticed that it doesn't work when you have high ping, around 200 and up
---
and he reloads back into lockers automatically!
---
Hard to waste time to block someone when your usually in a game when they spam.
---
Prayer Beads is most likely getting tweaked soon™. 
---
The amount of unfun matches it produces is getting higher as more people start to play as the Spirit.
---
Just remember Franks Mixtape.
---
And hippies like you had better learn it, and get a job!
---
*shakes cane*
---
IDK how you derailed the convo from talking about baseline nurse to talk about best nurse players in the world but ok
---
&gt;  it would just become a total cashgrab. This makes me grateful for BHVR
---
It's funny how we can overlook some of Behaviors moves which can be arguably seen as cash-grabs, such as plans of adding a paid battlepass into a paid game w/ DLC w/ Cosmetic MTs, because "at least they're not EA"
---
I’ll never understand tunnel vision. There’s a difference between playing efficiently and straight-up focus tunneling to where it’s detrimental to the killer himself.
---
They changed it in the PTB to include safe hook rescues, then reverted it because it was still too easy to get stacks.
---
No fix for Sprint Burst exploit? Should we consider that an intended feature as well?
---
just move the joystick in a circular motion, you dont need to violently shake it back and forth with your palm.
---
I’d get Laurie for Decisive Strike, nice perk against tunneling Killers. Deliverance from Adam is a nice perk for Solo Survivors. I personally like Aftercare from Jeff, it helps you and your teammates most of the time.
---
this is the biggest stretch for a "ea bad" post i've ever seen holy smokes, it's even worse than the one i made as a joke before.
---
no, if they did a good job playing the game they shouldn't lose
---
i really hope your joking right now
---
I have to disagree here. While prayer beads are strong, they are nowhere as powerful as the nurse. It adds nothing to the chase and is only good for catching survivors outside of your terror radius.
---
I don't know what the build was exactly but if it's a hex based build does fall apart quickly when survivors split up and work on different totems, once the first goes down it quickly snowballs to losing all totems, and if thrill of the hunt is gone, the whole build falls apart.
---
For the gen grabbing you could always gen tap if you think the spirit is closeby, or work on gens while the spirit is in a chase, again, splitting up to 4 gens is the best option and will get them done.
---
Dwight is by far the best support but he's main game, not DLC. Ash is a good solo, though his Mettle of Man perk got a massive nerf so if you're only getting him for that it's not worth it. His other two perks have massive potential if you play him properly though.
---
Lots of questions, but i'll do my best :)
---
1. I'd HIGHLY suggest picking up leatherface. His teachable perk, BBQ and chilli, will give you a MAJOR bloodpoint bonus, which will get you levelling up with the greatest of ease. 
---
2. As far as the killers you suggested go, I'd say my favorite is Myers. You have to stare at survivors for a while, but when you do it you get to move faster and one-shot survivors for a short period. Legion can be fun as well, but you might want more experience before trying them.
---
3. Freddy is seen as the worst, and he kind of is. At low ranks you won't have any problems, but as you progress he'll get worse and worse. The issue with him (afaik) is that he's too easy to bully. You can literally walk up right behind him as he's hooking someone and save them, because it takes him a while to put them back in the dream world. As far as a rework, I've been hearing that since his release and haven't seen anything yet.
---
4. It's not toxic to main killer. If you have more fun with it, main killer. It's not toxic to main survivor, either. What defines toxicity is what you do when you're in the game. Facecamping and tunneling are seen as toxic, but there are toxic qualities survivors express as well. Just try to play in a way that everyone has fun :)
---
Thank God they finally fixed that bus window bug, although it's happened to me while also playing Tapp so 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️
---
I  have more of an "oh they ran out of pallets" feeling when I kill a good looper, it's not much of a satifaction. I get satisfaction from killing survivors through mind games.
---
Yep
---
Wraith got what they deserved.
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Do you think camping when gates are open is scummy? Cuz if thats the case, then theyre justified in their frustration
---
What you will be accused of constantly in lower ranks.
---
The event ended yesterday.
---
I mean yeah Killer has always been brain dead easy until you play against survivors who actually know what they’re doing. The only reason this game seems in a fairly balanced state is because most survivors (and killers) don’t know how to even play the game, even at red ranks.
---
There needs to be a downside to this stuff, like there is to camping.
---
oh really?
---
I'm still out here waiting for Head On
---
he’s not particularly toxic but he’s extremely whiney, entitled and stubborn.
---
haven't played in a week cause of this
---
so? it's the only thing they can do to counter the killer. What are they gonna do? run in a straight line and let you kill them.
---
Tru3 thinks anything he loses against is broken or braindead. He'll lose to a SWF and conclude that it's an easy win for them, even though the statistics show that solo survivors survive more than SWF. 
---
He's 100% wrong. For Nurse, there really is no perk that counters her at all. The only thing that you can do is predict her blinks and try to out-mind game her. For Spirit, and any other invis killer, Spine Chill is a complete and total counter. I run SC and anytime I run into an invis killer, I let out a sigh of relief because the game just got 10x easier. With Nurse? Can't really do anything against her perk wise, just have to outplay her
---
Admittedly that's not to helpful for me knowing what they are
---
That’s isn’t it either: As a wise man said, “ hate the game not the player.” 🤣 who makes the rules of the game? If that issues was taken away you wouldn’t be here in the complaint room.
---
God you are really committed to the “being an asshole” role play as Claudette lol
---
I did, took awhile. I'm not upset about having so many cakes was just curious if anyone else had the same situation
---
And yet the game is still survivor sided because the devs haven’t fixed the biggest imbalance in the game: the maps.
---
Wait a second isn't she like 7 years old?
---
I'm a Meg main when I play survivor... :( #notallMegs
---
Bruhhh
---
If you play this shit for more than 4 hours a day good luck keeping a positive attitude because after an hour no matter what side the game starts to lose its "charm" and then the slippery slope happens
---
I've said many times that there is a VERY easy fix to the problem.
---
Make survivors have coms at baseline, and then balance around that. It would mean the only advantages SWF would have over solo is knowing who you're going in with, and would have coordination beyond that.
---
Snoop Dogg be high a lot so thats the joke. His ping is high
---
Use his shock at the right time and survivors can't drop pallets, so when they are expecting to drop the pallet and get away they can't. Also I enjoy the add on that puts a red glow on the survivor regardless of where you are, it really messes with people.
---
They did not have to offer anything. They offered something and you imply it is not enough. You respond as though players deserved more for their efforts. There’s a word for that.
---
Adam Francis is good for support because of autodidact. And deliverance is great for solo. I would go for him
---
I get angry when people can't look up camping in a dictionary and read the definition
---
I was hoping they fixed david's foggy day jacket but no...
---
It also doesn’t work in low ranks coz anyone could be playing at those ranks. It could be a good killer or it could be a noob who has ears? And if you get spotted you start running. You don’t sit around waiting for them to suddenly notice you next to that hay barrel. And if you’re hiding in that stupid unpredictable spot that’s no where even near the gen you aren’t at risk. And you don’t need chase perks to help you that much if you’re a good looper, everyone benefits from stealth perks coz you don’t know who you’re getting, could be pig (spine chill), could be a hag (urban), and lots of people bring 3 other perks that aren’t meant for stealth but have that one stealth perk (typically urban because it’s always useful regardless of the killer). You can run to the loops after being stealthy, there’s no reason that you can’t.
---
Of course everyone is here to repeat all the same trite reasons for camping and tunneling, ignoring the point of the post entirely. 
---
It's not that you are required to play according to made up rules or cater to the Survivors. You can do whatever you think you need to do to win (though I'd argue camping and tunneling aren't strong strategies.)
---
Just don't act surprised when someone is upset about it. It's extremely annoying to be the target of tunneling and camping, so naturally they'll be annoyed. You don't have to care about other people's fun. Just don't act all shocked about their totally normal reaction. 
---
If I ran a Killer around for 5 gens I wouldn't be surprised that they got annoyed. I wouldn't call them entitled for wishing it hadn't happened. That's a normal reaction.
---
This man thinks self care and noed are the strongest perks in the game 🤦‍♂️
---
Awesome thank you &lt;3  d(^_^o)
---
i tap when i drink or on the phone or something
---
It was 450,000 bloodpoints and 2,000 Iridescent Shards
---
This is overcharge!
---
&gt;I did, took awhile. I'm not upset about having so many cakes was just curious if anyone else had the same situation
---
Just for future use. If you plan to prestige, never waste bloodpoints going past level 50 (trying to create a perk loadout), just prestige immediately.
---
I had the same situation as you do but with my Claudette when I started playing over a year ago. I leveled her to full perks without prestige and regretted because I had too many offerings and items on her not to mention all that bloodpoint was wasted.
---
Facecamping is standing directly in front of a hooked survivor. It keeps anyone from being able to safely unhook.
---
Tunneling is ignoring all other survivors and running down the same one over and over again to abuse the way sacrifices work. It makes sense to play like this, as you'll kill survivors faster, but it makes the game brutally unfun to play if you're the survivor.
---
Gotta bring in the bloodpoints somehow
---
Tachanka would be proud
---
Great job!
---
oh k
---
Its the survivor counterpart to overcharge tbh
---
Okay, gotcha thanks. I'll try and not do those things.
---
I don't run any survivor build without 1 of the 4 perks: Botany Knowledge, Pharmacy, We'll Make It, or Adrenaline. 
---
If I or a teammate has a medkit, I refuse to heal them or let them heal me. Since I run Botany and med-kits a lot, I heal myself to be efficient. The only exception is if they are running We'll Make It.
---
I refuse to use instadown add-ons and Prayer Beads, no matter what. 
---
I let Kates and Aces get the hatch or a gate if they're the last one unless they were bm'ing me.
---
I kill Claudettes to my best abilities if they're the last one unless I notice them making smart decisions and being fair.
---
RIP you in the negative millions
---
I just played a no kill match as huntress and as the last guy wouldn't leave i found the hatch and closed it. Then went back to the exit gate where a slugged nea was showing me she couldn't leave. I picked her up and carried her to the other gate but sme thing, she died to the EGC outside the exit gates while i was throwing hatchets at the entity.
---
You win this round spidergod.
---
but did you think it was worth commenting on the post? now thats the real question
---
This looks like some Pan’s Labyrinth cosplay
---
I just got back into twitch streaming, I don't play DVD anymore. Even though that game is what built my channel, I haven't played in months. I'm probably sitting at rank 19 or 20 with 1500 hours in the game. Cant do that to people
---
Why are you a ham?
---
"No matter what you do, people give you shit about it"
---
She thinks so too.
---
Think it's that she has the mind of a child, seeing her mother killed messed with her head.
---
*hits blunt*  Give me another downvot3, son
---
Unbreakable and Tenacity.
---
I was hoping he was gonna snag your ass back up and hook you.
---
Same.
---
it remove your chaser emblem points so if you do that
---
Its making the correlation that the spirit and villagers make similar noises, not entirely random
---
Why is ashes suit so big? He looks like a fool
---
Then nobody's stopping me ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Devs are doing a gameplay stream tomorrow of how the new freddy rework will look.

HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT EVERYONE USES NOED NOW? I LITERALLY PUT MY MAX INTO THIS MATCH AND NOW ALL MY EFORDS ARE USELESS AS I GET CARRIED TO THE BASEMENT TO BE FACECAMPED
---
First time a US president being blackmailed by Russia
---
I feel like it should be 3 safe unhooks while you (the unhooker) is injured. Feels more balanced that way
---
whats the second nerf
---
That moment you’re seriously contemplating just suiciding in game vs stay on hook just a little bit more in some misplaced hope that the rando decides to kill their fear and save
---
You realize this is basically a $10 game and perks/characters are their only other real price on the game, right?
---
Clown.
---
What's funny is they never actually promised it, people just assumed it was.
---
The price of dead by daylight averages between $20-45
---
Wow well done omg that amazing hehe XD rawr
---
God if only...
---
I'm ok with this, as long as he goes after the survivor who did the unhooking. But trying to get a "safe" unhook while a killer is patrolling is alot of fun. 
---
Buuut it's a thin line between camping and patrolling
---
It goes on sale every month or two from what I can tell, and it sales at $10 for the base game. Never has the base game been $45, has it?
---
rank color doesn't really matter. climbing in red ranks is the only hard thing when it comes to ranks
---
Really?
---
Survivors can use Gruesomes!? wow never experienced that this event, bad luck made it so that I was always the one using the Gruesome cake :/ goddamn escape cakes...
---
Anyways: I agree there.
---
Being tunnel is not a subjet here, being tunnel happen, i'm not salty about it.
---
But in the case of the  Mori, it's a problem.
---
Mori should be allow or after 2 hook or after 1 with ability test, this is fair for everybody.
---
Any and all stuns knock him out of Night Shroud now
---
I wouldn’t mind those 2 cent increments going in my Microsoft account (I would love the bing bongs as I’m being camped by him if it pays for my next skin)
---
thanks for letting us know.
---
I’d like to point out that if map is on random you might end up in situations where one team draws Coal Tower, The Game and Lery’s to kill on, then Pale Rose, Grim Pantry and Haddonfield to survive on?
---
Be stealthy, if you find them then trick you, or run towards different pallets and windows, instead of running around same ones over and over again.
---
&gt;floor
---
Yep with bill, but its just one, and once.
---
Its not fair for the survivor this kind of game play.
---
Because the secret door is useless at this point, so why not remove it ?
---
Like I said I'm not upset by it he'll just be my bloodpoint power house for however long and I dont have a need to prestige I just would've if I didnt have the cakes and ghostface just really clicked with me so I didnt mind putting so much into him
---
When I install this, once I go into item selection I get an EAC error and the game closes. Couldn’t get past this, so had to verify my game files on Steam which removes the custom perks.
---
Doesn’t seem to be bannable, but EAC definitely picks it up as tampering with files.
---
FOR FUCK'S SAKE, GIVE HUNTRESS A TARGETING RETICULE ON PS4 SO SHE CAN BE PLAYABLE! MUST BE NICE TO PLAY ON A PC WITH A FOOKING MOUSE HUH!?
---
He was the one using her.
---
Yikes, I am so sorry...I must have hit a nerve
---
This doesn't have much to do with the post but there was once a trapper in rank 17 who brought 2 ultra rare addons and an ebony mori. Plus 2 of my teammates killed themselves at the start.
---
no but do not change it with open games
---
skillchecks are not all the same dude, you can make one quite difficult for the mori !!!
---
I was drawing this with u/mgsans go look at his drawings too, he has quite a lot of gud drawings
---
Open games?
---
He was hiding in the basement lockers for the whole game and everytime he did , i don’t think he knew i saw a notification. Poor guy doesn’t know that hiding in lockers the whole game is a bad idea :( I really felt bad for killing him
---
It got fixed last patch.
---
Did you try putting it in some rice??
---
Camping = 3 gens suddenly pop anyways so.
---
Good point. Let me explain a bit Behaviour has added a cosmestic store and could be adding a battlepass, which only intend to get money from players. However, those are things players requested ( I don't know about the battlepass), so the devs added these features to the game. Also, players want new chapters and characters added to the game. The devs do these things and charge money for them, which is fair. Also, the devs make all new maps free instead of forcing players to buy some season pass to get new maps. Also, bloodpoints and irredescent shards are not purchaseable so the game is not pay the win. This is something players apprecieate. Basically, a cashgrab could be any game, since all games are made to get your money. However, companies like Behaviour listen to their communities and don't take advantage of their players. They want their players to keep playing the game and stay with it. While other companies, like EA, just want their player's money, they could care less if players stuck with the game, as long as they got their money it doesnt matter. I probably explained this poorly but this is what I meant by cashgrab.
---
I hope it's good. He's been my favorite for a long time, he just felt too weak
---
At least you have a weapon against the crazies who will scream cultural appropriation (as if they would know culture as if it bit them in the ass)
---
Recently I did get a new internet carrier, and my god it's bad, so that is probably the reason why
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/ResilientPrettiestPanTBTacoLeft](https://clips.twitch.tv/ResilientPrettiestPanTBTacoLeft) new pic, new level different killer.
---
yes do not modify it when the game is open
---
*ghostface stun noise*
---
its broken to kill people after 2 hook also dude ! i play killer also and survivor.
---
You hook one guy, then tunnel it, and you have 1k in less than 5 min.... tell me this is not broken
---
Anyway, i speak with killer guys (who did not main survivor, even if they play survivor), so i will have always wrong...
---
I HAVE BEEN, IVE ALSO SEEN JUST ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE RUNNING IT TO LATLEY, ESPECIALLY WHEN GF CAME OUT, IT SUCKS PLAYING SOLO RANDOM
---
I encountered a killer with 1100 ping today. I literally didn’t even know that was possible.
---
And then you see the madness indicator and you’re like “FUCK I WISH I HAD BROUGHT CALM SPIRIT!”
---
We all know it will never be like that.
---
I really hope you mentioned that to him so he could try to defend his locker fet-I mean pride by saying “no there isn’t you’re full of shit you hacking asshole”
---
Its also the real popular/semipopular streamers, for once of course the usual bad examples like angry pug, but also others who might not usually be seen in the same bracket, take CowsIAM, hes got 45k subs, isnt generally regarded as toxic afaik, and better known for his videos about the glitches he discovers (like the multiple killer glitch), yet he quite often plays in a swf where one of his friends takes an account over rank 15. He usually cuts his videos, but in his "baby killers in dbd" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_9e8fRNIoU) vid he shows 2 end screens. No shit he ends up with a rank 17 baby killer when he swfs with a rank 17 account.
---
I was expecting it haha. I almost messaged him “please just end me” because he killed all my teammates in a matter of minutes and then kept downing me, letting me wiggle out and then chasing me over and over  ｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д｀ﾟ)ﾟ｡
---
For this clip I didn’t wiggle out with the hopes he would just hook me but he dropped me by the hatch instead.
---
That sounds absolutely ridiculous man. Im not gonna limit a loops usability just cuz sum1 gets a little miffed from a survivor playing the most optimal way.
---
On DBD they just go nuts on end game chats usually and that is the end of it on PC.
---
HOW THE FUCK DO YOU LOSE? I GET 4k ALL THE TIME AND EVERYONE GETS HOOKED ALMOST 3 TIMES AND I WIN, MAIN SHIRTLESS MYERS AND NURSE
---
Tbf i once entered in a discussion with him and he is quite open to external opinion, as long as you can back up what u saying, this day has completely changed my opinion on him
---
Ah I see. I’m 100 days into reddit and am still learning the labeled-speech etiquette around here
---
He says "getting generators" not "completing generators", go read.
---
Normally you should not have a problem like that. personally I have changed a lot of times and no problem :/
---
Don't have to be a dick about it.
---
Nobody was talking about Ghostface but go off
---
Ahhh ok
---
No. It's not. It's a hard to get offering that ends with the killer not pipping because he didn't sacrifice the people he mori'd.
---
Imagine a 2v8 and then legion can become half true to the lore.
---
Calm spirit is a perk everyone sleeps on.
---
Correction: Tunneling would be going straight for the unhooked guy, ignoring everyone else you see. 
---
If the only person to be found is the recently unhooked guy, thats just bad luck.
---
Sucks, but meh, shit happens.
---
TRUE, JUST DEPENDS WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE MESSAGE, PSN WILL BAN YOU QUICK IF YOU FUCK UP WITH THEM, THERE NOT A BUNCH OF PUSSYS LIKE BHVR!
---
No, the Devs patched that out of Play With Your Food.
---
Doin gens, you?
---
When you join a match and you’re readying up, in the bottom right corner there is a vertical line. If it’s green, your ping is low, meaning you shouldn’t lag in game much. If it’s yellow, then your ping is moderate. You may experience a little lag. If it is red, your ping is high and you will probably experience a lot of lag. Hope this helps!
---
I'm gonna need you to calm down and not downvote. I know, that can be extremely difficult, but you're a big boy now and I'm sure you can agree/disagree with someone without getting your panties in a bunch.
---
Watch any of tru3's videos of 'TOXIC SURVIVORS' or 'SWF TOXIC???', and he'll say the same thing. Guaranteed. 
---
I used to watch him when I was learning the game, and it made the game seem bleak. Anytime he would lose as killer = 'survivors are so toxic, it's so survivor sided', or when he'd win as killer = 'yeah, these survivors were really bad, they had no hope at all'. I ended up learning nothing of value from him.
---
Then I started watching Monto and Pain Reliever, and learned a lot more. It's thanks to them that I went to red ranks on my second month of playing this game. When they lose, they explain why they lost such as 'I could've looped this better' or 'I should've patrolled these 3 gens instead'. Helps put into perspective key moments that can cost you a game
---
I once ran into a bug where noises were coming from the incorrect areas
---
Hatch? Sounds to my right, slightly forward, ulill go that way. Huh, it’s getting more quiet, I’ll just retread my steps- it was to my fucking left and front, and no noise came from that direction!
---
Had this problem with survivors whimpering as they hid from me (yes, I can hear damaged survivors whimper, I have OK hearing) and generators the most (every noise was wrongly located, but it hurt generators and survivor whimpering the most)
---
Luckily everyone was brain dead so I won (1 DC before the killer’s spinning camera even got half a second in at beginning, there was a guy who just from me turning my back would unhook someone, who I would instantly rebook, this repeated until third hook. Third guy just... he just wasn’t very smart. I let the fourth and definitely best in my opinion survivor live and even farm some generators for points cause of his shit team, he thanked me and said I could shut the hatch for points since he would take the gates)
---
Poor Bing Bong was being controlled by a cunt.
---
It's because BHVR has millions of pages of data that shows you bringing the killer to your teammates, which then caused them to Disconnect or otherwise be angry that you are a sandbagger.
---
/s
---
Just @ me next time
---
Don't tell me : test are too easy for Mori, dev can make one special for mori more difficult.
---
Don't tell me : being able to kill is annoying for the teamate, it is not if it is at the end, because at this point because of this game play, the secret door is useless.
---
give me good arguments for my ideas, not your thought because you play killer and are affraid to lose your advantages on the survivors.
---
And Survivors can gen rush in less than 5 min, so no its not really broken.
---
Not sure if good boi or bad boi.
---
I mean, did they actually promise it? Can we get a source on that?
---
hes not toxic, being good isnt toxic, i want to see a recent example of him setting a bad example. i doubt you can

Today this is my favorite meme

They downvoted you because your comment adds nothing to the discussion other then "Tru3 bad"

There’s strategically hunting down the already damaged survivor and then there’s this shit.
---
He calls half of the killers or survivors he plays off against bad or boosted for making mistakes. He intentionally de-ranked so he could stomp on lower skilled players.

Yeah that would be fair, not

best part is you recive shit about it even if you didn't tunnel or camp.

WHY DC WHEN THE KILLER DOWNS YOU. THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME BEING DOWNED AND WE HAVE 1 GEN DONE. WHY DO THIS TO US. WHY. DO YOU HATE US??? DO YOU NOT THINK WE ARE GOOD ENOUGH? OR ARE YOU THAT SALTY???
---
That wasn't a nerf. That was a fix. It was always intended to be that way.
---
Why's it listed as Balance then?
---
I always do it unless I see a hook right next to me
---
I usually just let the entity have me if I’m the first on the hook too early into the match or the way they defend me from others is face camping (they can camp long as they got plans to catch a player trying to rescue me, that’s smart, this includes the use of insidious)
---
Some peeps got banned off twitch and YT for that
---
xD
---
*I'm bad, and that's good.*
---
*I will never be good, and that's not bad.*
---
*There's no one I'd rather be, than me.*
---
Borrowed is very good imo. As far as We're Gonna Live Forever, you can only get stacks by safe unhooks now
---
LF can instadown and break pallets quickly, I guess they are both better than Nurse because of that...
---
Fun is subjective, I much more prefer Spirit, Billy is quite boring for me to play as and against.
---
yeah bt is an amazing perk and can result in lots of great plays. it's also a counter to face camping
---
and yes they go very well together but please remember having bt isnt an excuse to go for a bad unhook
---
Prayer Beads are not stronger than Nurse. They are less fun to go against than Nurse, but they don't suddenly give Spirit vast map control / speed to down unless she only gets grabs.
---
but yeah they're extremely bullshit and need to be deleted.
---
And thats why its auric cells only.
---
I got a question, was this on coldwind and the gf had the red mask and cloak?
---
I don’t even play survivor and I would buy this. I love monto...just a lil bit.
---
You know why ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Life in the entity is tough and unfair :(
---
Lol! Glitch. I had it happen once a long time ago.
---
This didn’t happen.
---
DOES EVERY SINGLE GHOSTFACE ON PS4 JUST CAMP HOOKS IN NIGHT SHROUD OR WHAT? IT’S WORSE THAN CAMPING WRAITHS, AT LEAST THEY HAVE TO UNCLOAK AND DON’T GET AN EASY INSTADOWN AS THEIR REWARD FOR PLAYING LIKE A JACKASS. JESUS.
---
\*Night Shroud
---
wheres the evidence of the de ranked? he hasnt done that in at least 8 months so miss me with that. and if the killers are bad and he calls them bad who the fuck cares
---
Yea I really don’t pay attn to stuff like that 😅 will now though
---
&gt;No fix to Plague literally crashing the game
---
Decisive doesn’t stop tunneling when DS can remain active even if the killer has hooked another survivor. 
---
Terrible suggestion. Move on.
---
Just don’t go through pallets lol
---
I still don't see how being camped makes losing the game your fault. You're not very smart are you
---
You can't upvote because it's part of the picture 😂 fooled me pretty well
---
It did actually.
---
Technically she just grew up without social interaction so she’s not got the mind of a child but she doesn’t understand things like others having to eat so the argument that some people use to shame people into not buying a pillow doesn’t work also what a meme to buy such a thing
---
This is why I run level 3 Borrowed Time. There’s nothing better than being able to get past the killer and give a teammate the chance to run. Now that I’ve been doing it so much, every time someone unhooks me near the killer I’m like “Do you even have borrowed time?!”
---
Do you remember how you fixed it or did it go away on its own?
---
Probably something demonic
---
Imagine calling other people ”children” when you care about karma.
---
J bet you run make your choice a lot
---
She is on a pallet
---
Man this video is pure chaos
---
You should get your neurodevelopmental state checked lmao
---
CALLING THEM THEIR SURNAME IS MORE RESPECTFUL AND IS GENERALLY DONE IN ASIAN COUNTRIES UNTIL YOU GET TO KNOW SOMEONE SO I ACTUALLY KIND OF LIKE IT
---
i put in the pallet to scare them or while a loop
---
Legion is better off, unless you thought being broken was OK. also theoretically even if all the abilities Freddy gets are bad, just the fact that he can attack like a standard killer without waiting 7 seconds already makes him better.
---
Nice save
---
They* butcher
---
To* be better
---
To* be even worse
---
Than* before
---
**ShOw Me WhErE yOu PuT tHe BaSkEtS oR i’Ll SaY tHe N-wOrD**
---
Oof. Not my post tho
---
If you completely ignore the argument that Prayer Beads can be countered with Spine Chill and Nurse doesn't have a direct counter you'd be correct.
---
So uh. 
---
What’s the point of this?
---
Borrowed Time is an amazing team play perk. If someone's hooked endgame, it's basically a guaranteed escape if you take a hit for them after they get hit.
---
"Yur momz gonna die soon trash"
---
The message I got today from a Freddy who only got 1 kill due to NOED + Blood Warden and the rest of us didn't stick around or get caught in it.
---
You right, guess I just needed to hear it.
---
Love your flair :D
---
Go to my profile and read my other posts lol. I covered my name because it’s not my psn it’s my actual name.
---
Perk to remove all pallets on the map*
---
FTFY
---
There should be a trophy for this.
---
I have all the characters and still get these. Such bullshit, especially in iridescent surprise boxes
---
"Yeah but this is intentionally toxic, and it's not a part of the intended game mechanics"
---
There is a such a vast power difference between A good SWF and solo survivor, that the game becomes impossible to reasonably balance. They can nerf survivor perks all they want, but all that will do is make solo survivor even more hell since the communication and knowledge gained from SWF is stronger than any perk.
---
They made it so the red stain also goes away when standing with the first hotfix.
---
What are terrible suggestion. If they're waiting 60 seconds standing on top of you then they're wasting their time and letting gens pop. If they look for someone else then they risk you recovering and having someone come pick you up, negating their pressure and you still having another hook state. It's fine how it is, and your suggestion makes it a free second chance no matter what like it used to be before the nerf.
---
No they didn’t remove the ability to see. It must be a glitch.
---
Quite honestly, I'm not immensely grateful to either: I'm not spiteful towards BHVR, but I've long since accepted that there are hundreds of studios that could have made a better, less monetization-heavy game, but that game can't exist because DbD cornered the asymmetrical market
---
Don't get me qrong, I love DbD, but deep down I still never forget that these are licensed mobile developers who kind of lucked out on a fresh concept and are currently riding it harder than Ubisoft rides R6 Siege
---
Oh you're one of the ones who think Ghost Face was ruined by the hot fix, that explains all I need to know. Good day
---
Still have to censor names man
---
Nah only the killers ones would be enough ( using Bubba's splinter will give you Bubba with all his perks for 1 game)
---
If having instadowns makes Billy automatically better than Spirit, then he, LF, Myers and Ghostface are the best killers in the game, better even than Nurse.
---
With how matchmaking puts survivors into the lobby all at once, unless it fails to find solo queue or duos in which case you’ll have spots missing, it more or less comes down to seeing how they behave in the lobby instead of the telltale sign of everyone appearing at once like old matchmaking. If it’s no items, then there’s really no need to run a mori and just play the game. 2-3 items that are toolboxes, medkits, or one flashlight, run Franklin’s demise and move on with no mori still. 4 flashlights, and maybe even a .TTV in there raises a red flag.
---
It’s situational, at least for me (I’ve played as a survivor and got mori’d immediately at the beginning of a game after getting farmed numerous times. I understand that it’s not fun, especially when you’re solo) If it’s just a 4 stack doing their thing, then there’s no real point to bringing a mori. If it’s a 4 stack with the intentions of being toxic (or in the case of streamers having a flashlight squad to keep them up, for “content”) by everyone running flashlights, that’s when it feels like it’s needed, as it screams “holy shit, my life is gonna be hell for the next few minutes”
---
Not every 4 stack is toxic, nor is every streamer, but there are situations where you just know you have to run an ebony because they’re gonna try to shit on you. If it’s an ebony every single time when survivors aren’t running 4 man flashlight squads or teabagging at pallets and generally being a nuisance, and you use it, then that’s a dick move. If it’s a 4 man flashlight squad that teabags and is doing nothing but trying to piss you off, it’s warranted.
---
Yeah I feel there is a huge difference from high and low rank. I've been playing a lot of survivor with my friend who is new, I also got to rank two as killer (then I stopped playing for a while for console to get better fps.)
---
At low rank survivors waste a ton of time hiding and avoiding the killer since if they get caught it's almost a death sentence if you can't loop and it's a semi decent killer.
---
At high rank all survivors will be "gen rushing" (actually doing the gens and not fearing the killer) so the killer has to be able to multitask like a god. Because even wasting a couple seconds could mean survivors finishing a gen or you able to stop them from leaving for another few minute.
---
It's just really wierd in the balance department and I don't envy the people who actually do make balance changes.
---
Why not run awareness perks, though? Discordance, Bitter Murmur, BBQ&amp;C, etc. will all tell you where the survivors are, let you stalk them for the same effect as running expose perks, and only needing a single perk slot rather than 2/3. I'll say that Discordance moved me from getting a single stalk per match to ending nearly every chase with a marked survivor going down, and sometimes two or three.
---
A: stop being a child because of an opinion.
---
B: they weren’t hot fixes, they were blatant nerfs too him and his kit, and it made him unviable at red ranks. 
---
C: the reason that makes me hate the nerfs is because no one asked for them. The poll on the forums had over 80% of people saying he was in a good spot, and they still nerfed him.
---
Actually, OP's a knife, if you look closely enough.
---
more like roleplaying as someone playing claudette
---
wtf, he just stated that Prayer Beads are very strong, maybe even OP, you're definitely biased... Why is it complaining?
---
If you down somebody after their second hook they’re as good as dead anyways unless you really screw up and get flashlighted while you’re picking them up.  The only exception here really is decisive which could potentially be reworked to include moris within the 1 minute of being unhooked but idk mate
---
I've been maining killer the last few weeks and I've learned the second I realize the survivor knows how to waste my time, I'm done with them and I go back to watching gens. one hook is never worth your time when the rest of the survivors could be on gens when you're chasing one of them.
---
if you don’t think 700 average viewers is good then i don’t know what you’re smoking.
---
I used to be a fan of Tru3's content awhile ago. But the constant bitching about every little thing annoyed me to the point where I quit watching him. He will get out played and say something like "oh that was toxic, this is an SWF" when it was 100% his fault. He acts like he knows everything about DBD, like he's a god at the game, and if you beat him, you're either exploiting or your toxic.
---
Honestly I’m not bullying him at all &amp; I wasn’t aware names had to be censored . I’ll go check the rules for this subreddit though .
---
Someone get her a finger splint 😖😖😖
---
i dont know if i should be scared or not
---
We got lisa simpson, now we need marge
---
You missclicked the flair, it should be Shitpost
---
That wouldn't be bad
---
I take Billy over many of the other killers any day of the week. The only thing that annoys me about Billy are those god awful players who use Ruin on him.
---
Hell, even Nurse without Ruin I don't mind.
---
\*I\* didn't say anything. Wrong user.
---
That’s a reasonable critique.
---
I would remedy this by making it only become active a few seconds after being picked up (eg. 5/4/3).
---
It's okay at least it's not like Friday's state right now :s
---
I thought he will close the hatch giving you false hope. Rare moment he saved you.
---
I don't care. That wasn't the point. The point was you deliberately misrepresented what he said.
---
The datamined prices are not right, they all say they can be bought with shards. You shouldn't have relied on that.
---
Unfortunately, 4K doesn't guarantee Merciless at all. You don't even have a guaranteed iridescent emblem, since it requires 9 hooks and a 4K, which is easy to miss if you're halfway decent and can wreck them.
---
Sadly, it's easier to get Merciless if you're just slightly worse than the people you're playing against, since that way the match will take a while, and you'll have a lot of chances to build up points for your emblems.
---
They were unneeded though. And he easily could of been red rank viable, but they didn’t bother waiting for any information too be gathered before they nerfed him. Increasing the view too pull him out, even if it was only 8%, screwed him. And you should balance the game around high ranks, since they are the people who will (mostly) have the knowledge too balance the game as best as it can. And they were all mostly saying “don’t nerf Ghostface.”
---
He really does.
---
Go to any of his stream on any day and watch a ten minute chunk, he'll be complaining. 
---
I imagine it's a lot like those people that do the same things so endlessly they don't even realize it.
---
Examples: People that say "know what I'm sayin'?" Or "bro" every 2nd sentence
---
Theyre setting the exact example they want to dude.
---
No not really.
---
That ending made me crack up (thanks for the laughs)
---
Something similar happend to me recently,except one thing, they didn't apologize, and actually became more toxic after me saying iam learning to play nurse
---
If he just use "Leave Game", no. 
---
If he closes the app or pulls the plug, yes.
---
Piece of lettuce x'D
---
It is true, actually. The downvotes are from people who are salty that it's true. 
---
~~Why are you booing me, I'm right.~~
---
I mean eh. Everybody wants a free escape. 
---
4 man SWF will always get their friend off the hook assuming they play well. Sometimes if you can get an easy down, it’s worth it to leave.
---
Honestly? It's a super low-rank troll tactic, meant to just waste the killer's time. Now that they've made it pretty reasonable to rank up as survivor, but rather hard to rank up as killer, the lowbies are climbing the ranks and killers are having to deal with all their stupid tactics.
---
You are a fucking idiot then
---
I got them all I couldn't help it they're so good :s
---
People use those killers at rank 1 because they're the best at going against rank 1 survivors. Any other killer can't go against them nearly as well.
---
Well done
---
I keep making that bug happen with my map. I think it's neat.
---
It only happened once. But once i started omega blinking... things were regretted.
---
I didn't he was just wrong so it wasent worth mentioning also if you dont care why the hell are you here?
---
 Dream pallets might need to be changed a bit because if your playing SWF the person could just yell through their Mic that's it's a dream pallet.
---
I can't stand some SWFs. Once one DC's the rest slowly go like wow. I managed to get all but the cockiest one who waited ages for me to come to him just so I could watch him leave -.-
---
Yeah it kinda was, I've learned to dont mind those salty messeges but it looks like iam not touching nurse soon
---
Escandalo :0
---
Thanks for answering
---
So tunnelled. Got it
---
Awww, thanks&lt;3
---
Here are the reveal mechanics I've found thus far: There is a buffer time of \~0.3 seconds before revealing beings making progress, then you have to continually reveal him for 1.5 addition seconds. You need to be able to see 20% of his body. You need to be in range, which can be reduced by addons (not sure on the exact numbers). He needs to be near the middle of your screen, but not obscured by your own character model.  
---
Inconsistencies in the reveal mechanic exist for several reasons. Character models have different visual sizes, which makes the obstructed zone inconsistent between them. The camera also changes position, at times moving close to the character in tight spaces. This is a common feature in 3rd person games, but it creates a problem here, as your character may now take up most of the area where he can be revealed. If you can't fit 20% of his body into the remaining area, he cannot be revealed. Even worse is that he must be continuously held in that area, or you'll end up having to start over. Playing David king on a tight map against Ghost Face is bad news bears.  
---
Honestly, maybe they need to do away with the bounds on the screen altogether. There is nothing to tell the player what those boundaries are. If he's on your screen at all, you are probably going to see him. The original problem of him getting spotted by people spinning their cameras was solved with the introduction of the buffer. The only problem with this is that it would make it easier for survivors to take advantage of the 3rd person mode to spot him around corners. Quite frankly, spotting people during a chase, when they know exactly where you are, doesn't lend a whole lot to the whole 'stealth killer' role. If it weakens the killer, then he needs to be buffed in a different way to compensate. His strengths shouldn't be based in mechanics that are outside of player control.
---
Hire someone to get it for u
---
Please do more!
---
Well, the distinction I'm making is that while every Killer has the ADVANTAGE 1v1, Nurse exceeds acceptable capability to be OVERpowered. That is, OP for a Killer.
---
It would be a tragedy if the Killer was evenly-matched with a single Survivor.
---
It does say everything on  the patch notes. It takes less time to read them than making a post on reddit.
---
This entire comment section is disgraceful, you people should be ashaned of yourselves lol.
---
Bruh when they said 🗿 I felt that
---
So you’re saying he’s fun to watch when he’s begging for donations and subs and when he doesn’t get them rages at his audience?  I’ve been to a few of his “Friday night” streams and all he does is complain that they need to be lit.  Lit as in him getting donations.
---
Slugging completely ruins SWF. Sure, they'll send one person at first, but after a single failed heal attempt, you'll find they're all swarming to try and get their buddy. Then you just chip away at them when they get overzealous about trying to lead you away from the first person you downed.
---
It only opens when theres one person left if there is five gens remaining, its to give them a chance
---
Just a word of advice, OchiDO is hated on alot here. Of course, pretty much all of is warranted.  Guy was super toxic, used exploits and the like. But I hope you watch better youtubers/streamers, like Noob3,Tru3Tal3nt, Monto, Farmer John (Newer but has funny videos), and Puppers (One of the best survivors in my opinion)
---
Whaaaaaaaaaaaattttt?????
---
I've been playing this game since September and I had no idea. None! I am flabbergasted. I thought it was just this very strange thing that was happening sometimes.
---
Remove the pallets
---
Give survivors guns
---
Nerf freddy
---
"Yeah he came at me with a katana so I yeeted myself out the window.  Broke every bone in my body, but at least he killed me after :^^) "
---
The fact that you disagreed with his opinion doesn't change the fact you deliberately misrepresented what he said. You made a straw man.
---
Then a suicidal teammate runs at the killer, gets hooked and he can see you with bbq n chili. So much for stealth
---
Man you guys have your panties in a bunch.
---
he hates teammates that make other people die, just so you + maybe one other person can escape. I can say its a good build for red ranks as a solo player, but idk how i feel. I personally dont use sneaky builds except for iron will cuz fuck self-care, not because i dont like them, but because it will not help my team just like you think it will, i can guarantee you that after 50-100hours playing on this build you will figure out what i have in mind.
---
&gt;He will get out played and say something like "oh that was toxic, this is an SWF"
---
Really? I mean normally i just hear him say "Nice" and refer to them as optimal survivors
---
Whoa, now look at who’s insulting LGBTQ.
---
Yeah. It really needs to be addressed bc that's just ridiculous.
---
Thats great i don't care im here to discuss the game not have an argument about arguments
---
I can hear someone say ‘nerf crouching’ in the forums (hillbilly forgot his glasses again)
---
You can max out every killers, every survivors. Current and futur characters too. You could even buy your freedom to the entity with all that money!
---
Same logic applies on survivor. If i run the killer for 5 min and i got 3 urban evasion claudettes hiding in the corner. Shoudnt i get a chance with the hatch?
---
The cockiest one is usually the best one in a SWF.
---
I don’t think anyone needs to own anything to have access to a map, I think that BHVR just gives everyone access to the maps.
---
owning anything has nothing to do with maps
---
What? It doesn’t matter if you own the dlc character. All the maps are in the same rotation whether you have it or mot
---
It does not say WHY other than a general “balances” category and it doesn’t say that only huntress is effected.
---
Maps are free content. Purchasing/not purchasing a killer doesn’t change this.
---
Hatch spawning and opening at 5 gens is away for the killer to force the game to end, not necessarily a free escape for survivors even though it can work that way. 
---
Would you rather have a survivor holding the game hostage because he can't possibly repair 2 gens while you patrol it so he just hides?
---
Fine then, but have fun finding the last survivor who will be urban evading around the map for 20 minutes just to spite you.
---
Edited. Enjoy my stream. I’ll be live in about 6 hours. Maybe sooner.
---
How insightful.
---
The players aren't the problem here.
---
Can't blame survivors for being good enough at the game to negate most killers, and I can't blame killers for sticking to the handful that can still win.
---
It's up to the devs to find a way to bring the rest of the roster up to par.
---
Not necessarily I've killed plenty of the cockiest then the rest just DC -.-
---
Yeah i dont get it, im mainly a killer but i flex, nurse is outdated and needs to be adjusted big time, I've always had that unpopular opinion.
---
I dont know how you would balance her though, perhaps making fatigue time much bigger and increase her movement speed slightly? So she cant just hit you then blink instantly onto you. Its a rushed idea but i dont know.
---
Take away the hatch closing and you got yourself a deal
---
My dad’s dead and my stream has way too many curse words. I’d never let my mom watch it.
---
OH DAMN!
---
Yes, I know.
---
I don't have a P3-50 Nurse because I particularly enjoy playing her, I'll tell you that.
---
Bro ... I mean, they could be.
---
You need to invest some time into critical thinking. 
---
What characters have lullabies? Huntress and Freddy. 
---
Does it say “only huntress lullaby affected”? No. 
---
So if lullabies are no longer directional, and it doesn’t specify a certain killer, then it’s safe to assume all lullabies are affected. 
---
Half of it is reading, the other half is thinking.
---
Yeah I’m mildly disappointed that I didn’t just implode the universe but it also means that they did a pretty good job writing in the same style.
---
Yes hi hello I’d like to know if you an instagram so I can look at more of your amazing art and concepts. Thank you~
---
I guess the community enjoys being toxic...
---
Thats called proxy camping.
---
...Yes because everything in the game files is guaranteed to be exactly as it is in the live game, as we've all learned from the teacher related things in the game files.
---
Kill/survival rates mean literally nothing. Nurse has the lowest kill rate on console, doesn’t mean she needs buffs. Plague has a very high kill rate a few months ago, doesn’t mean she needs nerfs.
---
As for the changes, yes he did get better Killer Instinct and better stealth, but why would you not just run Spine chill, or OoO, or any other stealth counter? Then it doesn’t matter. 
---
Most High ranked players know what’s the best way too buff killers. When there are only 3 viable killers at red ranks, there is a problem. And again, over 80% of people on the forums said for him too not be touched, and they did it anyway. They don’t care about what the community thinks.
---
Indeed
---
If they body-blocked him on purpose then they fully deserve to be sold out. I'm all for Fair play but come on!😂
---
I feel like console has more petty people than on pc. considering the community has been around much longer. having played on both i’ve noticed console killers throw games just to shake their head and smack you all game. While it throws the game for them, back during the 20min queues it was pretty discouraging when it happens consecutively and you just want to play the game normally
---
If you can find out where this was from, please let me know! I can’t find it anywhere 😓
---
A: keep your lid on, this is a discussion not a pissing contest.
---
B: That’s my point exactly. They didn’t have Fog Whisperers, so my point was they have been making rash decisions with no data for a while now.
---
First things first, what is this "decent" build you speak of.
---
I can’t tell if you mean the survivors or the killers lol
---
I feel like us Meg players always have trouble with Clauds. I swear every single one runs Urban Evasion and Sprint Burst - either that or they're scared of leaving scratch marks for the killer that's across the map to see. Do you main Meg because of cosmetics or because you got good perks on her?
---
Meg main big brain
---
But their changes were freddy looked promising in their anniversary stream. If they go back on those now then yea kinda disappointing. But Ghostface and legion post rework are decent.
---
Ill take a Freddy prinze jr
---
Ya I agree it’s ashame though. The devs really need to do something about the shit cause they even said they believe they did not intend for this to be a thing
---
I’ve never seen a player list their “accolades” in their bio. 
---
I wonder if he does anything besides play DBD. Tough scenes. 
---
Not to mention the toxic aspect. Toxic players usually have a very small friend group or no friends at all. Interesting thing to boast about.
---
Haha, yeah. It always seems like Claudette mains don't like Meg mains and same vice-versa.
---
Meg was the first survivor I P3'd and then I started loving all of the cosmetics they were releasing for her so I mostly picked her based on cosmetics, but she is the only survivor I have all perks on. :)
---
Yes I am and don't call me that it's not going to make you some how right. Then technically the survivors are the campers and no you're wrong most people use the term to describe a killer that has the sole purpose of staying at the hook to prevent anyone who is not already at the hook from rescuing them where as in this case the survivors were the ones already at the hook camping meaning my sole purpose was to catch the people already trying to rescue who won't leave giving me a reason to leave the hook. If you can't understand the difference then you're half brain dead.
---
You're forgetting the permanently crouched urban evasion clauds
---
Tried bribing the entity he said he’s the one giving the blood points so I couldn’t :\
---
BBQ and chili,sloppy butcher save the best for last and infectious fright,or throwing in thanatophobia
---
Thanks, I'ma 4Head
---
Riiiiiiight. Because definitions and meanings suddenly don’t apply to you since you want to take them in a condescending manner and it hurts your feelings. 
---
I don’t care how others use it. If you fit the definition, you are the word. Rules don’t change. 
---
You still camped, which makes you a camper for that period of the game. Regardless of your feelings. 
---
See ya.
---
People expect to win every game so when they dont, they think it must be an issue with the game
---
to be clear it makes *a* survivor be an obsession. Your obsession might not actually be the person with DS
---
Have you played a game after that game that wasn’t bugged?
---
I try to be nice on my stream. I often get toxic messages from survivors though
