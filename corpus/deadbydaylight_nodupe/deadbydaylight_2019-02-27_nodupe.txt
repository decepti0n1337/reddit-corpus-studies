Epic bruh moment.

&gt; since when do you only need to adhere to logic in a formal debate
---

---
I mean, you don't. But let's not act like this is shit people follow in standard day to day conversation, please. That's just silly. Nothing I said required some passive aggressive reply about logical fallacies. All you had to do was ask like a normal person.
---
&gt; A perfect killer playing against 4 perfect survivors will never get a kill because killer relies on the survivors making mistakes
---
You can't just assert this as if it's an absolute truth lmao this coming from the guy harping on about logical fallacies. Wow

Those look very great, have you tried replacing the ingame survivor icons with those? I feel they could fit fantastic.

A specific djinn, yes - Aicha Kandicha - a north African succubus Djinn. That's my thought, at least. Also, the smoke 'fingers' are reaching for the ward.
---
He runs faster as mo bamba
---
Twitch bans people who evade in game bans he just needs to be reported for it
---
This guy has officially  reached pathetic status. Probably can't stream anything else because this is the only game where he can stomp on random killers with his friends.
---
It's kinda sad when you think about it... 
---
have you ever actually played killer?
---
You wanted to show some great artwork op. But you fucked up, everyone just wants to fuck it, including me
---
Thing is with most killers is that you need to be good at them to be effective e.g Nurse and Spirit. With survivor you can throw down pallets as soon as you get them and not loop anything but still win bc of how quick gens pop.
---
When your mural looks more aesthetically interesting than you do. 
---
I have no idea about how imgur works but [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/lMtzUCq)'s the datamined Cosmetics I found. Hope the Gallery thing works lol.
---
That just brought me to the pictures of your meme, is there no actual datamined cosmetics?
---
OMG!! I just HATE when somebody uses the word "literally" in a wrong contex.... Oh. Wait.
---

WTF??????

"Dick! Dick! It's Marvin! Your cousin. Marvin Winters. You know that new battle drill you've been looking for? Well listen to this."
---
Dude that would be amazing! I super want a Chatterer!
---
The post after this literally has a 28 comment long argument lol.
---
pallet wasting like that is a legit survivor strat to distract the killer. Once you recognize they're doing that, break some pallets for a bit but then break off for your gens.
---
Ohh, sorry to disappoint, there's no real leaks. I just made these because I got bored! Sorry if I made you hope for something! I thought you wanted to use the separate Images for whatever but that's all I can offer, sadly. ~~Plus I'm a big stupid so I'd never be smart enough to datamine real leaks, sorry :(~~
---
Was a meme from the weekend. It looks great though
---
WHAT ARE YOOU DOOIN IN MY LOCKER!
---
Oh look, a shit show over a clearly satirical post! Fuck.
---
So it‚Äôs treason, then?
---
Yes, I'm a killer main with, frankly, a strong killer bias and the userbase here hates me for it
---
By that logic cant the killer do that for the survivor? And just hunt them down and tunnel?
---
No. Again I should be allowed to dodge shitty ping as much as I need to literally half the killers around here only dodge shit ping
---
I fail to see how that was "clutch." The Legion player fucked up by forgetting when you down someone with a regular hit you run out of Frenzy. You used Dead Hard to get a little closer to the gen and pop goes Adrenaline (another 2nd chance/comeback mechanic Survivor Mains absolutely insist is fair). 
---
Basically you lucked out and both of you had Adrenaline. Big whoop. 
---
as far as this legion dc meme on reddit goes I haven't seen more DC's than usual and he's one of my 3 main killers right now . I leveled him up during christmas box event so I got quite a lot ebony moris and even secret offerings + legion + franks mixtape don't make people DC more than expected p3 claudette failed first chase in 30sec and ragequit shit.
---
Maybe on rank 1 its more frequent. I didn't have time to play much this year so I'm hovering around rank 10 all the time
---
You hurt them right in the feels. 
---
I use Stake Out sometimes aswell, but it's kinda meh compared to other perks, I mean is good if you're against ruin and suck at skillchecks, but I dont see that much use outside of that.
---
When you are getting looped for almost 2 minutes, this red is your blood boiling deep down in your brains.
---
Poor OP,is not his fault Daddy Trapper is so fuckable. 
---
All I want is object of obsession, BHVR plz
---
Good DLC survivor perks 
---
I really don‚Äôt get why people can‚Äôt just accept defeat and lose fairly why can‚Äôt people just except that they can‚Äôt always win and that there‚Äôs always someone better
---
Good point
---
Jeff is a good boi
---
Hell yeah, brother!
---
Cheers from Haddonfield!
---
I think we have had that in late 2018
---
hey that works for me. :&gt;
---
You folks are underestimating the utility of Tinkerer as Spirit/Billy/Nurse who can move quickly across the map. Yes other perks are better on most of them, but the alert and no terror radius makes for hilarious confusion mid chase or starting a new chase. 
---
This shrine is a bucket Full of shit for killer mains.
---
Duck and Roll: Whilst crouched and stood still, press the interact button to quickly roll a short distance (Like, length of a gap between two walls and a pallet) in the direction you are facing leaving no scratch marks for 3/4/5 seconds after the rolling.
---
Has a cool down of 30/25/20 seconds.
---
Does that sound too OP?
---
what are the roles again other than dwight in closet
---
Idk I‚Äôm pretty damn short. Like about 2 and a half maybe, give or take. And yeah the chainsaw is about that big. Considering billy is probably much taller than me (I‚Äôd guess at least 5‚Äô8) his arm range is much longer.
---
But I‚Äôm talking the red forest big. I didn‚Äôt even see his face when I was chainsawed. I wish I filmed it just to show how dumb the hit was. More than likely some shitty latency issue or lag but who knows. Dedicated servers cannot come sooner. 
---
I know it‚Äôs one of those spilled milk stuff but after the 20th instance I just can‚Äôt help myself from being a little tilted. At least his arms don‚Äôt spaz anymore when he chainsawed (although that was kinda funny). 
---
How do you feel about chainsawing through the window? I mean when the survivor is starting to run and they still get chainsawed. 
---
Again, lag issue, but it‚Äôs still kinda bull sometimes. 
---
All I want is barbecue and chili 
---
Say gg ez everytime they get salty. Ignoring and laughing at their faces are the best.
---
It would be funny if the next Killer Survivor Mains deem to be verboten and constantly ragequit against. 
---
It's either they deal with it and get good or go play Civ V. 
---
He‚Äôs so cute
---
They‚Äôre always so altruistic 
---
Yeah I'm not the guy in the screenshot. But I've been playing as a killer recently under various names like Jim Halpert and Pepsi Man.
---
Just imagine how strong he is üòçü§§
---
is it just me or does the smoke look like hands near the part holding the symbols? 
---
Zoom in on the right, between the gold thing in the middle and the stone wall on the right. There‚Äôs a figure standing there. 
---
Can‚Äôt they just look up guides to get better and study the killers to come up with a strategy to win
---
FUCKING FINALLY STAKE OUT WOOOOO
---
FINALLY STAKE OUT WOOOOOO
---
That was not even a half second of reaction time what the fuck
---
Thank you, that's something I'll definitely try exploring  after I prestige. I just was worried I might lose out one some perks or something, but it seems like most everybody runs the same 6-8 perks for survivors anyways. This thread has definitely made me reconsider staying with Meg just because. I'm interested to try out some others now.
---
And Thank you! It makes me feel so much better knowing I'm not the only one!
---
Happy hunting/surviving!
---
Jeff is the Best Boi
---
flashlights, my friend.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
flashlights.
---
Welcome year zeeerooo
---
I would be really excited about this, obviously. 
---
Aug. 27, 201-Sep. 2, 2018 :)
---
That's the mentality of Survivor Mains. You would have loved last October when Freddy first came out. 
---
Wheres that redditor who posted a huge post about there NEVER EVER being a killer who would appear like the survivor and move like them (Legion) and posted this huge whiney ass rant about it never happening. Anyone know that users name? 
---
Actually legions was the snow map picture with the caption ‚Äúwith snow comes darkness‚Äù
---
If he did not use a regular hit the other survior would not have been downed, so im confused of what you mean here. Also do you think Legion is balanced? No counter play at all to him. I belive Adrenalin (fair) considering what other perks there is such as Noed and Decisive strike. And how is it any luck here?
---
I'm confused as to what tinkerer actually does.
---
Anyone who supports that pedo is probably doesn't fully grasp what a pedo is or how seriously awful he is. They're most likely are 12 years old as well.
---
yes and sadly they do. PERSONALLY neither should get that information. 
---
I'm just wondering why I got down voted for this.
---
When you‚Äôre being chased by a nurse and they accidentally blink into the basement
---
This is underrated lmao
---
Noob is cool. He's not a pedo. üëç
---
Takkke onnnnn meeeee.... Take meeee onnnn........
---
What happened with Freddy?
---
The devs would never do that tbh
---
Wonder what this killer could be
---
I just don‚Äôt care about the toxicity anymore. Someone messages me with toxicity, I report them and move on. Survivor is toxic? I move on. Killer is toxic? Move on. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying this to show off or anything, I‚Äôm showing how apathetic I am towards problems in this game now. I just play how I want to play and if someone has an issue fuck them. 
---
The only caveat: I ALWAYS message nurse players. I‚Äôm on PS4, and those guys are a goddamn inspiration, whether it‚Äôs a 4K in a single gen or a complete no-hook wash. Their struggle might be the most real, and I like to show my appreciation for people with bigger cajones than I have
---
[deleted]
---
name me ONE reason why i'm supposed to care
---
Camping is a cheap and easy way of securing a kill, but it's not the same as holding a game hostage, and then exploit the hatch and allow a friend to escape by disconnecting.
---
I did post out a video link well if it doesn‚Äôt 
---
Here the channel link 
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCga66YXuawgjLIsj0d0cB9Q
---
Adrenaline is almost as bad as DS. People insist it's fair because it's end game only when the benefits are massive: instantly get up if slugged, healed by one hit point or whatever it is, and a sprint burst on top of that. The perk is insanely common SWF squads. 
---
And Legion is balanced because (1) it still takes a while for someone to go down even if the player is using Frank's Mixtape. Compared to a good Nurse that could put your ass down in about 30 seconds. (2) If Legion can't find multiple Survivors to slash and then focus on one he's kind of fucked because you're not slowing them down. (3) If the Survivor finds a jungle gym or the Killer Shack (with a pallet obviously) they can still juke the Legion. Certain loop spots can still waste Legion's time depending on how far away he is. (4) Sprint Burst hard counters Legion. 
---
Stop crying about Legion. 
---
Noob3 is a decent guy. He actually acknowledges when he plays toxic and mainly memes. He did get banned for showcasing an exploit in a video some months ago and for getting his legacy back after his save data got deleted.
---
Some people like to compare him with ochido but imo he is just a fun guy to watch and really cares for the game.
---
(Also doubt they are friends anymore. Ochido was a meme/joke and gossiped about a ton already months ago)
---
My boy got pulled into the fog over here, damn
---
that's what i thought
---
Let‚Äôs sub each other :)
---
I don't watch much TV, but a Google search literally answers this for me
---
r/facepalm
---
What if he believed the Entity to be Satan?
---
Smoke based killer?
---
&gt; Just cause a survivor perk gets changed and kinda buffer tbh, doesn‚Äôt mean we have to change anything on the killer end. 
---
I was making a general statement towards the devs balance ideology, not this particular patch in general. This patch was hardley a nerf to survivors however I found it ironic of them to talk about risk vs reward on the survivor side when it virtually doesn't exist on the killer side. There used to be a lot of "risk vs reward" style perks on the killer side but all the "risk" has been removed nowadays from the good perks, while the survivors have plenty fo risk vs reward perks.
---
I love this
---
Is there a chance that's the new map?
---
WE WERE GONNA CALL HIM DONNIE! YOU AND DEANDRA DEVOURED HIM BEFORE HE COULD BE BORN!
---
The Wraith and Trapper and funny and all but damn you draw a great Billy normally.
---
You say you hate (bad thing), but you keep talking about (bad thing), so you must like (bad thing).
---
Wowee that there is some gold-medal mental gymnastics just to randomly defend a fuckin' pedophile lul
---
I only DC if it's a huntress with iridescent heads and infantry belt. To be, it's worse than noed because you didn't work for your instadown, AND it isn't even endgame.
---
Same, We Gonna Farm Forever David has probably killed me more times than killers like Freddy.
---
But you're right, it's most likely that she would look very similar to the nurse
---
When survivors are working on a generator, and they are 85 percent finished working on it, the killer receives a visual and auditory notification and the killers loses its terror radius for a little bit
---
So you see where the almost finished gen is and you don‚Äôt have a heartbeat
---
i‚Äôm personally betting on a corrupt priest/bishop/pope because i feel like the thing in the teaser is very reminiscent of a thurible
---
such is a very catholic thing and it fits appropriately into a time period much earlier than our current oldest killer
---
As far as legion goes, it‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs too hard, is just that it‚Äôs unfun and the person playing legion can be significantly less skilled than you yet still down you with relative ease because of how legion just ignores chase mechanics. 
---
He‚Äôs not an inherently good killer, but he‚Äôs no fun to play against because it doesn‚Äôt really matter how good you are in the chase.
---
Shrek is going to show his love
---
It could also be something referring to eclipse, which would also make sense to me since the "bell" looks more like a moon to me. It kinda reminds me of the film "Darkness" (2002) in which seven children (you can also count seven "baby angels" on the picture) were sacrificed in an eclipse ritual by some kind of demon nun a long time ago. This is another way of looking at the meaning of "darkness" and "light" and it also has something religious/satanic plus it is definitely old.  
---
What I find the most interesting is the fact, that the previous DLC's always seemed containing a hidden hint for the upcoming one (eg Kate and the "Free Spirit"-Shirt). So maybe we overlooked something regarding Jeff. Maybe his cosmetics are hiding something that would lead us indirectly to the new DLC.   
---
I don't know why but I'm really excited for this DLC since Legion turned out a bit disappointing. Although perks itself were ok :-)
---
It‚Äôs literally a better lightweight, so yes.
---
That's a new one to me
---
context? pretty confused rn
---
Dude, just deal with it. You have to be hooked 3 times before it's over. That's before taking account of any 2nd chance/comeback mechanic perks. You're given more than enough chances here. Imagine if Killers DC'd if they saw a guy with DS and Instant Heal? Or if a guy has a key? 
---
Grow some balls. 
---
This makes me laugh like Newman, which, is this scene, is also like a velociraptor. Great JPob!
---
Dude, if you're gonna pick a wrestler, \[pick the right one\]([https://gifer.com/en/Eq3Y](https://gifer.com/en/Eq3Y))
---
Dude dodge for one more second I almost have the hex!!!!!! ......and now two of them are down......... &lt; sigh &gt;
---
Hmmm, would you say lowering the numbers/removing the scratch mark invisibility part entirely make it any better balanced?
---
Not really but its a fun perk.
---
I generally don't trust the opinions on all of those content creators, even if they may be skillful like Scott, doesn't mean that they the best on balancing the game. For example, Scott said that Trapper is better than doc and Pig, which is just strictly not true. Just because someone is good at the game/has a lot of hours, doesn't mean that they are the most knowledgeable about balance. Most of the time it does correlate yes, but I don't think so in this instance. Clown is bad against bad survivors, period. I could send you a link to a discord if you wanted where people smarter than me could explain a bit better.
---
Tru3 was actually realising how bad Clown was, which I was surprised about because most of the time he doesn't have the best opinions on balance (still love him tho)
---
This... could be a cool power if you wanna play with the terror radius
---
I usually run the Bloody Cleaver and Hellfire Mask nowadays. 
---
My guess was that he wanted to finish getting the stalk on her and heard Ace running behind.
---
My build is:
---
BBQ and Chili, Ruin, Spies from the Shadows, and a wild card for the 4th slot, though I recommend Enduring if you're new.
---
Spies helps a lot on Huntress, she benefits almost as much as the Nurse does from knowing when someone is sneaking around behind a rock near you. Get lots of free hits on people out in the open like that.
---
The two most basic tactics you need to learn as Huntress are: how to hit people running in the open, and how to use hatchets in loops.
---
Getting better at hitting people in the open is simple enough. When they start zig zagging, don't try to aim where they are, pick a single line you want to throw down and, the moment they cross over it, release. Works a surprising amount of time (see last tip for how to line up shots better).
---
Pallet hatchets are tricky. Basically you want to chase the opponent as normal until right before they drop the pallet, when you have a choice to make: wind up a hatchet and hope they drop the pallet, or run through it and hope they don't. I generally run through the first pallet I run into in all my games, just to let them know I'm not afraid of disrespecting pallets. From then on, it's all mindgames. If you think they're about to drop a pallet, backstep and wind up. If you think they're trying to mindgame you, run through and smack them with your axe.
---
Also, last tip. If you want to get better at throwing hatchets long-distance (or even short distance if you're quick enough), in your peripheral vision, line your target up between the "o" and the "w" in the "throw hatchet" text at the bottom of the screen before you wind up. You can get some gnarly cross-map hatchets if you see people working on gens or going for hook saves when you see them with BBQ and take a second to line up the shot.
---
Just get YouTube to ban him. Tell BHVR.
---
Twisty is legit the first time a horror villain has both made me feel such terror and such sadness.
---
I‚Äôm sure if I care, I can yeah. But these are all your own accounts, are they not?
---
The Lich
---
Meanwhile, I can use Legion with Ruin up and still get gen-rushed. Especially when playing against an SWF squad. Especially when the totem spawns still fuck over Killers. So yeah, wow, Legion is so busted that justifies crying like an absolute bitch on social media about the character. 
---
But man, using Dead Hard and completing a gen to get Adrenaline is so insanely skillful. I bet only a handful of people on the planet would know how to do that. Get the fuck out of here. 
---
Im getting it because I‚Äôm not buying the Saw DLC anytime soon. Its cool for a meme ‚Äúgen rush‚Äù build too.
---
I bet its chucky
---
Addons are the different ghouls and they change the song that plays. And yeah it could be kinda fun but itd make a lot of people mad because it's very anti immersion 
---
Every single killer requires some degree of skill. Even Trapper takes some intellect and planning, as well as patience. 
---
Legion is pretty awful if he doesn't have the right add-ons. Just takes way too long to down people.
---
Some streamer is being toxic, the only reason I would know is because people keep posting about them and linking their videos. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs better to not mention said streamer and to instead send evidence of toxic behavior straight to the devs that way I‚Äôm not inadvertently promoting said streamer. But I also understand that sometimes people aren‚Äôt dealt with unless enough people make a stink about them. It seems like the stink isn‚Äôt working though...
---
looks like hes ready for a bit of the ultra-violent.
---
They said they didn't want to make solo survivors have to wait until the end of the match to see the killer's loadout, but they couldn't tell which survivors had been in a SWF at the point, so they had to do it to everyone. So if what I said isn't how it works, how does it work, then?
---
Well, maybe not the songs, but the concept of a power that forces survivors to move in a certain way would be cool for a killer. I'd be down to play with this, on paper at least.
---
Trapper takes skill don't get me wrong. However killers like Leatherface the only skill that you need is basic m1 stuff.
---
I stopped watching at 'Hight'
---
There is a difference. Camping is over in mins, and a smart team can take advantage of that and do gens to ensuring killers get 1k only. Holding a game hostage on the other hand is pure toxicity. If I didnt catch them, they would hold the game hostage for even longer. DC is pure toxicity as well, because that's exploiting something outside the gameplay mechanic.
---
It's definitely going to be based on religion. I'm guessing it's a worshipper of the entity. Maybe Benedict or Vigo? One can still hope. :(
---
Fuck the fear turkey
---
They can't tie it to individual survivors due to how they have the networking for the game set up. The new dedicated server coming in a few months are going to let client data tell the server who is in a group. Which means SWF can also regroup immediately instead of re inviting. 
---
I wouldn't doubt it for a second. I bet this is where center Gen is. 
---
I know that this is just a meme but one can dream.
---
In a fucking bush probably
---
Here's why we're at a disadvantage--time. Our every action wastes time. From the start of every match, there's a countdown that requires attention, time management skills, and map pressure. Our perks are far from as broken as yours and our every single mistake costs us killers way more time than you Survivors, who literally have backup plans for shitty plays that we as killers have to capitalize on. To kill takes patience. It takes skill. We have to know every last number that this game employs. We have to plan ahead and pray we can burn your **stupid, ANNOYING** get out of jail free cards! 
---
But you seem incapable of seeing the obvious. If you value this game, understand our predicament, shut your damn mouth, and look at the numbers. 
---
So...how is what I said not how it works? I said they can't tell who is in a group past the group lobby, and now you're saying they need new tech to tell who is in a group. That seems like it agrees with what I said.
---
I watch streamers escape Legion like every day
---
I feel like people just quit and like, don‚Äôt really care that much. I doubt there‚Äôs some message anyone‚Äôs sending. I see random quits as a survivor all the time. I don‚Äôt think any of the care nor are they like smashing their keyboards / throwing their controllers at monitors. There‚Äôs no real penalty. Until there‚Äôs a penalty that they care about, we‚Äôll all be experiencing it.
---
Also legion is snoozeville@gmail.com they might‚Äôve just fallen asleep on ALT+F4 /jk
---
It's not even about the skill checks. It's about the screaming. You can say you can avoid it by going into lockers but if you're working on a gen and the only lockers you can get to are next to it, Doc is gonna know you're there.
---
Is this a Dying Light: The Following teaser lol? Meant for the children of the sun
---
ah, thank you for answering.
---
So pissed that it isn‚Äôt a bee
---
I'm scared, but... umm... r/confusedboner
---
A M&amp;A Doc with add ons that increase TR
---
/confusedboner
---
I just let them kill me if it‚Äôs Legion: Thanato / Ruin / Sloppy. Ain‚Äôt got time for that SNOOZEfest. Lmao
---
r/confusedboner
---
Anyone remember how long it took Legion to get to PBE after their first teaser?
---
BHVR can just keep giving him hardware bans.
---
Wow triggered. You started by stating adrenaline aint fair. And now you throw mud around like a child. Grow up, maybe you are just bad with Legion. If u cant come up with construtive critism or controle your childish behavior then your arguements is a fart in the wind.
---
Stop crying about adrenaline.
---
Salty
---
Pot Killer?
---
Sister Frieda from Dark Souls confirmed?
---
People keep commenting that the item is a censure, but I'm starting to doubt that theory.
---
Looking at this object, there's no holes in it for smoke to be released or incense to be placed inside. Also, the location is odd since censures are traditionally carried by members of the cloth to spread the cleansing smoke, and not hung in a single place.
---
This appears to be some kind of holy relic, but I can't guess its purpose for the life of me....
---
afaik, only the far left offering is unobtainable now, so keep it, cherish it :p
---
Trust me, she can hide more than just a bush, she's is hell trying to find in the game
---
On that last question, It's mostly because they're not the best when it comes to design in general. Both are very maze-like, so you don't know where killer is very often. At least, that's my experience after over a year of playing
---
I'm scared, but also.... r/confusedboners
---
And y‚Äôall thought it was a heartbeat you were hearing 
---
I'm going to be leaving this game. I wasn't being an asshole, or toxic. I didn't get caught all game then I get face camped. I have the whole video where I called it in the lobby ahead of time, saying I'm ready for a big fat face camp. It makes the game unbearable. Nearly every game is like this. It has been for the past week. Whether it's a basement camping nurse who's mad because it's Lerys or Bubba that comes running back to the basement, it's old. I hope you guys can still have fun, I really do. I wish you all the best, but I'm out. 
---
Completely unnecessary, but suprisingly accurate. 
---
As long as you aren't running remember me, yea. It's a pretty good perk for any killer besides huntress and nurse.
---
Newman laugh approved üëç
---
save the best for last and remember me LMAO
---
All day with this, I can't anymore. I don't know why the sudden change? I've been to rank 1 twice. A video game is not supposed to be this stressful. It's supposed to be fun. 
---
You can remove the efficiency penalty all you want, but progressing on multiple gens is better simply because it ensures that at least one of those gens will be completed, while two people on one gen can have that progress completely nullified if the killer has discordance, bbq, or pop goes the weasel. And if you wanna talk about psychological damage, imagine having one chase go by and 3 gens completed because everyone stayed on separate gens. It only really needs to be a 60 second long chase too, if they all do gens, given hook time and time to get to gens.
---
Nice
---
Anyone else read the caption as them desperately trying to not plagiarize The Last of Us? 
---
Mori me Papa Emeritus I
---
Well, Demoman is in Overwatch now, so...
---
Never played wraith yet. My first add on pair will be this.
---
AcHSualLY... the killer deserves his kill and face camping at the end is warranted. Or it's just your fault you avoided them the entire game to get hit with noed at the end. You should've just spent your first 3 minutes of the match cleansing the 5 totems bro. 
---
-Killer mains
---
I mean the doors are open at this point. Letting someone go would just be silly
---
Caption: "bright and saturated for your analysis"
---
Me: *turns up brightest anyway*
---
It's that new offering that allows you a chance to go to the new map: "The Jerk Store"
---
cant tell the direction of the bell and cant tell how far you are because no terror radius  and no stain is like almost jumpscare wraith
---
So in the lobby you wanted s face camp, then cry and quit when it happened?
---
I didn‚Äôt know Dwight went to hogwarts 
---
That makes me think we are getting a mummy after all. I'm not sure what the thing in the teaser is but when I saw it the first that popped into my mind was Tibet which has it's own history of mummification but it could be lots of different things.
---
Because atm survivor is pretty unbearable between legion, absurd hitboxes, and crappy teams
---
No probs, sorry for the confusion.
---

I put the term ‚Äòhostage‚Äô in quotes because you said it. In reality, That‚Äôs not holding a game hostage. Find them and kill them and you won‚Äôt have that problem FFS. 
---
I never said anything about rules either ... I called them both shitty players. Bottom line, that they did want not holding the game hostage, nor was it an exploit. It was a shitty thing that shitty players do, just like a killer camping the hook.

I am honestly super happy PS4 doesn't show player rank until after. Honeslty, I rarely make it past the EXP screen anyways, why should I care if it was unbalanced? Game is over. Just my position, I get where everyone's coming from.
---
(P.S. totally understand the PC fam that deals with this before hand, you guys have to deal with either knowing yours super mismatched or leaving/rejoing over and over, and that would drive me insane, I feel you)

Fam if trying to make you understand something pisses you off so you reply these kind of shit then you deserve to be pissesd off
---
i really hope not. the issue with copyright stuff in the game right now is, that we aren‚Äôt getting more cosmetics than the originals
---
Mostly speculation, but it wouldn't surprise me. People ask for nudes from anyone, even underage girls. I don't call him a pedo because I don't know for sure. I just call him an half brained toxic asshole because that's something I can confirm.
---
Chainsaw are also heavy and not exactly the easiest things to manoeuvre in such a way that you would need to in order for it hit someone on the opposite side of a tree. 
---
I like windows better 
---
Gross
---
No you are right, his hitbox is absolutely fucked right now. I‚Äôve straight up been hit through walls on certain maps. 
---
Every killer is viable at rank 1, if this were 1.9 or earlier you would have a good point.
---
Let me get this straight, you died but still pipped.  Yet, you‚Äôre angry.  Angry that, after the gates are opened and when you‚Äôre caught, you get facecamped for about five seconds before he runs off to chase down your buddies.  This is some fucked up entitled bullshit to have the mentality to run to Reddit and put this on there. 
---
Honestly, if you really are done, I won‚Äôt miss you or anyone like you that can‚Äôt fathom not only not pipping, but being killed during a match.  
---
Boi the gates where powered, smh.

Yup, killers camping the first person downed. survivors wasting time trying to get the rescue instead of doing gens. It has been hell lately. 
---
The amount of times I've gone back over a pallet and the killer has predicted that makes me question if I have a brain at all
---
It might have something to do with the doors being open? 
---
Freddy C(r)ougar
---
My build is Ruin, BBQ, Whispers and Brutal Strength. 
---
Also most people expect a huntress to wind up a hatchet at a pallet, so I run right through it and get free hits all the time.
---
Know the stereotypes against a killer and dont do them. 
---
Gonna go ahead a say: BHVR, give us 2018 Myers mask. I don't spend money on your game, and I WOULD BUY THAT SHIT SO FAST.
---
drinking game take a shot everytime you see a comment on this talking abt how Claudette is invisible 
---
I like the addition of the red stain! It's something alot of people leave out. I don't why everyone is fantasizing about him though.
---
If they're going with the bee theme, it better be Candy Man!
---
&gt; So realistically, what is expected of the killer
---
Regardless of circumstances, you are *always* expected to leave the hook and ignore the rescue attempts. Allow the rescue to happen. It doesn't matter if you see another survivor standing there waiting for you to leave, you get your ass out there and chase the guy teabagging and baiting you to run far away from that hook. 
---
Give survivors the most possible chance you can to survive. Nobody cares if you're playing to put yourself in an advantageous position, if you don't chauffeur the survivors through the best possible experience, you're a piece of shit. Maybe, if you're lucky, a survivor or two might take pity on you or reward you for your graciousness as a host with a kill; however, they can only die on their terms and when they feel ready.
---
That's what's expected of you.
---
Play as the Bye Bye Man, so everyone expects you to bomb and you can kill those bitches.
---
I‚Äôm not pissed off, I‚Äôm just saying I think that our pal Ochido has changed and shouldn‚Äôt be bother as long as he doesn‚Äôt brake rules. This was fun and all but I‚Äôm gonna forget over night so maybe talk later?
---
Is it bad to spend shards on cosmetics? I'm a sucker for character customization, but I feel like the cosmetics are really overpriced in terms of spending real money on them, but shards are also valuable for the shrine, so either way you're losing something. 
---
Also, how much do bright cosmetics hinder your gameplay? I'd like to give my Feng Min pink hair, but I imagine it'll be much easier to spot on every map. 
---
The devs can't make killers scary again, thats just not how it works. Over time survivors have realized that they're never in much danger because the maps are littered with free escapes like pallets and windows. The only way killers even scare survivors nowadays is through jumpscares (Myers, pig, &amp; spirit) 
---
This isn't mine I, just found this. A guy pinned his/her name in the comments somewhere, but ig he/she wanted to give a theme without using much time
---
More like Pizzachu.

I love how noob can be toxic and get away with it. Amazing

---
Never gonna happen, i will suck a dick if it does
---
Search the sub, it's already been posted that BHVR is trying something things with matchmaking right now. 
---
the first thing I saw in the smoke was like. a ghost girls face? on the left side, kissing the onion thing. 
---
Oki thanks 
---
Face camping is normal when the gates are open, killing is the last objective 
---
Just let me put a little bell that glows green and red on her
---
I don't think the entity does that. They wait until the person is "batshit crazy" then gets in their brain, compel them to kill, then take them into its realm.
---
I maybe should have included more game footage. He hooked 2 people with noed after the doors were powered, downed me then face camped in particular. 
---
The question is who to go for first
---
This ‚Ä¶ when the gates are open, camping is not a thing. 
---
Hey guys, just curious about 2 things:
---
1) Is there any way to lower the volume of the engines? I sometimes do the trick where I move the camera angle to a certain spot and the volume of the gen sound goes way down. Makes it way easier to hear those skill checks.
---
2) I've seen streamers constantly go left and right as they are running from the killer. Does that actually do anything, or is it just to not run in a straight line?
---
It's not a new killer it's a Freddy rework! (A joke but that's what the fog face looks like to me)
---
Ik but wanted you to be assured just in case
---
So you‚Äôre telling me that when in the deep wound state adrenaline just removes it while keeping you injured
---
Do you have the IQ of one single celery stick?
---
If I did, that would be higher then yours. 
---
I didn't find anything in the lore specifically about torture. Can you send a like to where this was said/confirmed?
---

Really depends. A lot of shitty onboard NICs don't let you touch the MAC address. And that's with most motherboards. All the same though, they will just ban him again.
---
I‚Äôm not angry at all. I‚Äôm not the one who took the time to post this video on Reddit to complain about ‚Äúfacecamping‚Äù and proclaim that they will no longer play this game. 
---
However, I am annoyed with this mentality that loses and slaps down words like camper or bad killer, etc. when things don‚Äôt go their way. It‚Äôs detrimental to the community and are usually said by players who can‚Äôt face the fact that they just might not be that good. 
---
THERES A FACE ON HIS CHEEK. I cant tell what it is though ugh
---
No it doesn't. They still gather data from players. You can see it during there streams, often times bring up that % chance to escape per rank chart. 
---
There is...
---
***IT'S HIS!***
---
But otherwise, uh uh  
---
Well then either the killer was intending on tunneling and was just an inexperienced killer who was indecisive, or his intention was to gain stalk on her and to go after you because he didn't have enough stalk to gain on you and he just hesitated on his intentions. Point is, we're not mind readers and I'm just making an assumption off of a 30 second clip with no context to the rest of the game and how he was playing throughout the match.
---
Wait seriously that's not the Easter egg? Lmao
---
I played for a week or so in red ranks as piggy and clown. Neither had ruin. I would be covered in sweat and barely eek out one or two kills. Close games? Maybe. Fun game? Sometimes. We‚Äôre survivors ever giving respect for not playing Billy non stop? Absolutely not. Always T bagged at every turn. I‚Äôve tried! And I love Pig/Clown but struggle at top ranks with them. 
---
I'm  curious as to where you see the face, lol 
---
Snoop Dogg?
---
If you zoom in on his cheek there seems to be a face. But I could also be blind.

I‚Äôm blind sorry. Where is it?

You're probably being downvoted because you seem aggressively negative, not because your opinion is unpopular.

Dwightachu.

Hes one of the swf squad that held my game hostage. He and his bodies are here downvoting and defending what they did. Don't argue with those little kids, they don't understand the concept of reasoning. 
---
Probably wouldn‚Äôt mind, as long as it‚Äôs done
---
I would absolutely love a Silent Hill DLC. Especially if it were Heather and Pyramid Head. Thought I think we‚Äôd all be too spooped if the killer were Ideal Daddy/Abstract Father! XD
---
Killers tunnel because its efficient.
---
Hmmmm I think there might be something, but its so Dark....
---
A real big knife and some sick dance moves.
---
\*gasp
---
It all makes sense now 
---
Yup! And I know every killer is totally viable. Top streamers do it. But when I play a few hours a week and hang around rank 10-5ish for killer it just gets tough. I recently leveled huntress and have been playing and survivors have a field day with me. But I gotta learn. I hope I‚Äôm balancing out the game sometimes. 
---
I do love spirit. Favorite killer and always pip as her. A lot of double pips and 4 kills as well. But she isn‚Äôt fun to play against and I get that side as well. 
---
Does anyone else see that thing in the middle? It looks like the top of an archway or something, but I can't tell with how dark it is. 
---
Oh true! I mean there are some gold/blue splotches, but it'll do until we get the full teaser trailer!
---
Dawg you wild, can you trace it in photoshop for our blind asses?
---
My favorite survivor salt story is still the time every single fucking survivor lead me back to shack and went down one by one and then when I'd finished piling them all up on the basement hooks they called me a basement camper in the post-game. Motherfuckers I started chasing every single one of you outside shack and you ran me directly back to it.
---
The Kate's fine. She was first and shack was the strongest thing in the area.
---
But Claudette you dumb sonuvabitch you didn't even give me time to leave. I was ten feet out the door when you tried to run in behind me. All I had to do was look over my shoulder to catch your ass trying to sneak in. And I know you knew I saw you because I threw a fuckin' hatchet at the back of your head. Why'd you keep going down to basement you idiot? Did you really think you were gonna rescue in that situation? Run away from shack! Away! Give your other teammates a chance to rescue!
---
And the fuckin' Ace. I smacked him well outside of shack and he used the hitsprint to run to it and start trying to loop it. Against huntress. With the pallet already gone. Two teammates dying on hook underneath our very feeth, and one poor David in the bushes outside like "I can rescue, I can fucking rescue, just stop running her around the shack. Please." But no, Ace is gonna loop that fucking shack until I down him or those two die. Spoiler: I downed him and he DC'd immediately.
---
Yeah but no that's my fault. I'm a basement camper toxic baby killer. Claudette or Ace aren't fucking braindead morons who got their entire team killed at 5 gens or anything. Definitely not. Any and all survivor misplays are actually just killers being toxic.
---
Thanks
---
No, no they can't. Actually moving players into a queue again without literally having the ability to do so because of the network infrastructure is a completely different task from gathering information already there. By the time you are paired up with a group and queuing the game knows you are a SWF
---
It's not that the game can't track them it's as soon as the group is disconnected from the host they are thrown back into a seperate lobby because there is no where else to put them that keeps them together.
---
Just gives some tiny fucking buffs like holy shit
---
Give Leatherface a shorter charge time and better movement speed on his chainsaw, and make the last swing actually connect.
---
Give huntress 115% movement speed, no she wont be fucking broken and no it woudn‚Äôt break the game. Some maps make her fucking useless but no one ever acknowledges this. 
---
Make the Pig‚Äôs roar happen mid animation instead of announcing it at the beginning to the entire vicinity ‚ÄúI AM HERE‚Äù when she is supposed to he stealthy, so fucking stupid. 
---
Make Trapper start with traps, I don‚Äôt know of some addons effect this but this should be default. He should start with two, no matter what.
---
Make Wraiths exit animation faster.
---
No idea how to touch Hag, unlike Huntress she can be played extrenely tactically on every map. Even huge maps, which hurt her, enable her to lock down an area.
---
Myers is fine I guess but I wish stealthy myers was more playable, super fun looking on tighter maps but useless on any maps even remotely open. 
---
Feel free to disagree but NONE of these changes would break the game, it would make it better because it adds variety. Survivors have it fucking easy because they are all the same, God help you if you are Leatherface against a toxic SWF bully group who all have borrowed time, self care, current decisive, and whatever else they use. 
---
NOED should be nerfed but not drastically, make it so that you have to do 3-4 dull totems instead of all of them. 
---
Time for a fucking crusade
---
10/11ish
---
They‚Äôre talking about the killer‚Äôs gamertag, not which killer they‚Äôre playing. That way they can leave a lobby if they recognize the gamertag of a known toxic killer the way killers can with survivors in the lobby.
---
Smoke kinda looks like a dragon head to me, fire breathing killer?
---
Tbh I don't know how to I did this on my phone I noticed it zoomed in screenshotted it then posted it here
---
If there was a perk that let you DS a fellow survivor for unhooking you within the killer's terror radius, I would run it. "No, Claudette. You're not urban evading into the fucking aether while I desperately run away grunting and spilling koolaid everywhere. Not this time. You're gonna sit here under this hook and wait for the killer to come back while I run the fuck away."
---
Lol.
---
Jump scares are an involuntary reaction from the body and are cheap. They aren't real scares and I do not want to see more of it. 
---
I'd prefer killers that were unsettling and straight up creepy looking because that impact lasts more. There is no way to be scared of a killer in a game that is like this, were encouraged to run around and play in a arcadey fashion. 
---
Absolutely! 
---
Does anyone know when the last time Adrenaline and Lithe where in the shrine?
---
Going more in depth and having actual evidence are two completely different things. Just because he explains it a little better, doesnt really mean anything. Until theres actual proof, ill just assume its people wanting something to be true because they dont like someone. Dont get me wrong, i think hes a pretty shitty person.

Ranks 10-20 in a nutshell 
---
This change is quite heavily a nerf. Yes, some elements are better, like the skillcheck being bigger and the skillcheck starting at pickup, but the survivor can no longer choose when they want to use it. If the 60 seconds after being unhooked is up, or the killer doesn't tunnel at all, it's a dead perk.
---
If one of the survivors managed to get the guy off the hook, who would you chase? The only thing that really makes me wanna cry in this game is when the killer is obviously focusing one survivor 
---
Put some respect on Freddy‚Äôs name.

You aint got the juice like that
---
&gt; There's an apparition, more terrifying than anything I've ever seen, lurking amongst the shadows here. It moves like a silhouette, appearing and disappearing at the sound of disturbed tall grass. It's impossible to track it. Several times it has caught me without me even seeing it closing in. Often convinced I have my back covered, it has promptly materialized right behind me to decisive strike from close range. Stay still and watch the tall grass. Don't move, don't blink and for god's sake don't breathe. If you can control your fear long enough and can show self control, sometimes it is possible to see its form as it crouches forward if caught at just the right time. I pray for your safety.

pretty much but why put a quit feature if it is something that can get you banned if you do it enough? no different than entrapment lol sorry your argument does not change my mind on why they included a quit button on a game they dont want people quitting
---
I did nothing all game and still pipped.  - The survivor main.  Insert alternate caps and intentionally bad spelling where applicable.

Talk about rude.

 Tapp Log, Day I don‚Äôt even fucking know anymore. This campfire seems to never end and every hour I‚Äôm running back out and winding up back here again no matter what. I‚Äôve gotten better at seeing some of these places. Cornfield, Asylum, Residence...Meat Plant.
---
Young is here too but she‚Äôs different now. I‚Äôve been Staking this locker Out until those damned crows come up and give me away. Filthy animals. Keeping track of her is no easy task. Sometimes she runs around kicking those generators, throwing people on those meatbooks with no effort. Sometimes I know she‚Äôs close but I can‚Äôt feel her. She‚Äôs like some super stalker. Freak of nature Predator blowing up pallets one leg two kicks. I still can‚Äôt get that image of it just exploding when someone threw one in her face. 
---
Every day...no..time I get back here I try to learn something new about this place. Move stuff around, help these other civilians out. Can‚Äôt seem to do too much with all the weird stuff that goes on here. Too much to Tinker with and not enough time. I want to stay here but if I‚Äôm ever going to find a way out I have to run off and try to go somewhere else. When will this madness end? How long do any of us have? 
---
The Window Of Opprotunity feels like it gets closer and closer to shutting every single time I wind up back here. But I haven‚Äôt given up and I don‚Äôt plan on starting today.

He's not really good at making videos either.  He cuts and pastes gameplay clips and attaches the same old shitty meme sounds combined with occasional zoom ins which really isn't hard at all. 
---
Not just legion. Dsers and others do it to everyone. Waaaaah I dsed you but you got me back down I wasted your time by a measly 10secs more so Imma rob you of a bbq stack, finding another survivor and make the game harder for the rest of my "team". Or waaaah I missed my skillcheck. 
---
Fav disconnect moment I had was when I played doc on a shitty map for him. Right after the first survivor screamed they all dced. 4 flashlight running ds strike swf.

I couldn't seem to get used to rank 1 killers being braindead, jfc. PC killers are so much more interesting to face.
---
I have so many Questions about what is happening in this image but I am too scared to ask.
---
What a surprise all the perks suck.
---
I mean in all fairness you're in an online game with completely random people. Anything that's supposed to be fun can be ruined by someone who does not want fun. It's to be expected. 
---
I think the camping in this clip is justified but every other killer camping throughout the match is pretty annoying.
---
I was about to say, "Bubba time", but then I saw the trap. 
---
I don't understand how you're going to surprise anyone with tinkerer and nurse Billy or even spirit they all make noise sans spirit with prayer beads. 
---
I agree on Billy and Nurse, but I don't think it's too effective on spirit because the spirit really relies on having a terror radius at all times. Survivors can't hear her 'woosh' sound when they are in her terror radius, and tinkerer taking away her terror radius now alerts anyone, close or far, to if she is actually phasing or not. It's can work if combined with prayer beads, but that's more of a perk for a build built around a single purple add on rather than a perk that fits into a more universally useful build for her. I've gotten some amazing stealth plays off it on a lot of killers, but spirit is one of two killers that I really think works more against them than for them.
---
I totally get this.  I run remember me on my trapper and while i love not having to get to the stress of end game it makes me sad when i basically play with 1 perk 
---
Well hopefully they'll give the chapters a rest after this one to fix/rework killers already ingame. It's not like we're short on them anyway. 
---
That's good to hear. :)
---
It's like a tragic baroque painting
---
XD
---
So I just watched the kings new video and apparently nurse is the current oldest killer. Apparently she‚Äôs from 1914.
---
Real talk is there a way to report players on the forums? My ping in MLGA went from high 160s to "No Players", to 6 when this happened. 
---
? 
---
Bring on the campers
---
That killer was an idiot for walking into a pallet when he knows people are swarming around him. 
---
Hex: No One Escapes Lag Switching

why can i hear this

Nah just make it a regular perk, hex perks don't last until the end of the game.

Uh are you on the right reddit?
---
Insert Quentin is Killer joke here&gt;
---
Long queue times will also drive away new players. The queue times for 3 and 4 man SWF is absolutely unacceptable. Seriously I have to wait close to 10 minutes sometimes with my friends just to finally find a lobby.  The matchmaking needs to be like CoD where the game doesn't give a shit if you're prestige 15 level 50 or if you're a brand new player they'll throw you together.
---
Why do we care, exactly? This isn't really related in any way to dead by daylight.
---
the bell is just his asscheeks clapping together
---
You have to own dark souls to play the new dlc
---
Waaay to dark. How do you expect me to guess the killer in this lighting?
---
If you want an enjoyable gaming experience where you feel totally in control at all times and can dictate your fun as you see fit then I really don't think playing a PVP focused game is going to be the smart route to take.  
---
If that were true, don‚Äôt you think you‚Äôd see more of them? Not to mention that people constantly complain about balance between killers (such as the skill versus reward). 
---
Viability and playability are different. I sure CAN play as Freddy, but I‚Äôm probably gonna get my ass kicked harder than if I played another killer like my dude Billy. 
---
Again, it‚Äôs an overall problem, not a player to player problem. Poor Freddy has been shoved under the bus and I honestly think the devs are gonna get shitted on no matter what they do. I think this at times discourages them to want to do anything because of the fan base getting upset. 
---
But yeah TL;DR you can always play other killers at high rank,  but you won‚Äôt coast as easily as say omega blink Nurse and insta-chainsaw Billy which can be frustrating for the average player. 
---
I pretend I‚Äôm gonna loop the killers shack, but then just leave it. I watch as I‚Äôm running away as half the killers just mind game themselves and swing around the corner thinking I‚Äôm waiting at the pallet
---
Who cares?
---
Definitely Mothman
---
Maybe some sort of dinosaur?
---
What has this sub come to
---
BHVR should just copyright strike his videos. They have the legal right to revoke the stream/reproduce/YT etc permissions they have without offering a reason. Would solve the problem once he's struck out he's not allowed to make a new YT account.
---
IDENTITY THEFT IS NOT A JOKE. MILLIONS OF FAMILIES SUFFER EVERY YEAR.
---
MICHAEL!
---
Blindfuqs don't see it :-DDDdddd
---
Outskilled :)
---
^ yup.
---
^ this
---
lol
---
He's only rank 14 and the rest are either rank 12 or 13
---
Bottom left says Auric Cells
---
yup, he's a poster child for shit house behavior in game.
---
Yeah I wish I could say much but honestly I‚Äôm a bit of a coward and get easily scared by anything. The trappers traps and hag pop ups always get me :(
---
But yeah I get what you mean. Why be scared of something that I can easily outmaneuver. Not to mention with the current balance frustration between certain perks and constant arguing, I think both sides are too annoyed at this point to want to be immersed anymore. 
---
This game has such a ‚Äúwell this last guy was a toxic piece of shit so I‚Äôm gonna be a toxic piece of shit in the next match‚Äù continuing this cycle. 
---
I think if people saw more diverse killers with more diverse perks then the frustration would be somewhat lifted. Monotony isn‚Äôt fun. It isn‚Äôt exclusive for survivors either. If killers saw more than ‚Äúsprint burst, adrenaline, DS, self care‚Äù then they might be more active in searching for creative builds instead of feeling as if they‚Äôre forced to have a meta build too. 
---
In the end, I have actually no idea how to fix the problem. This game and its playerbase is damned if you do, damned if you don‚Äôt. 
---
Noob3 nowdays is nothing like Ochido, he can actually play as well, I didn't watch his early stuff but hes fine now.
---
He may not be the best, but at least he isn't legion.
---
God I hate the internet 
---
Hell nah to the nah nah nah
---
Something like this?
---
https://dbd.onteh.net.au/
---
Only shows you who is queueing as killer and how long they've had lobby open, you can't specifically join one of them. Are you talking about a diff site?
---
This isn‚Äôt skill. The killer obviously lag switched. 
---
Bad players being bad, what's new?
---
Win10 stores its key in the bios, its probable they use something tied to that to get/generate the hardware key in the first instance.
---
Would require new Mb and new Windows key.
---
This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things!!!
---
artorias just impales claudette from a mile away
---
Thank you for the tip! The only killer Ive tried so far are the Wraith and Doctor but Im usually strugglin hard with the doctor since I havent gotten a single kill with him sadly. Im planning to try Legion soon when I got time playing the game again
---
Not gonna lie I thought his pecks were tits.
---
Also outer nodes used to be 8k per item 
---
Is this a good manga?
---
Duh no shit you have to be a fucking moron to not see the obvious joke
---
A crusader would be too dull imo.
---
freddy‚Äôs more annoying than legion imo
---
Well it‚Äôs pretty hard to detect sarcasm over the internet. 
---
So much detail.. 
---
Who says they‚Äôre not ;^)
---
Dude I had forgotten about that. That shit sucked
---
The ":)" and the general context where it was said should've made it impossible to think otherwise....
---
Hope he quits cause of you
---
If your cheater is using YT to fund his BS, then revoke his copyright status for reproduction of your games on YT and get them to ban his YT account.
---
‚ÄúWhen you have to tunnel because you‚Äôre a trash killer :)‚Äù smiley faces can be used anywhere. They‚Äôre not helpful hints. 
---
And dailies gave like 7.5k BP on average haHAA
---
The lanterns, of course! It all makes sense now
---
I can see... ***EVERYTHING!***
---
I feel the same way about people bitching about reposts.
---
Yeah basically the more you rank up the more you hate the game. I‚Äôm rank 10 right now because of rank reset and not playing the game overall but when I was in rank 3 matchmaking was HELLA long
---
C O N T E X T
---
I don't see anything ever anymore. I'm blind now thank you. 
---
üëç
---
I mean it makes sense. If I were a mass murdering psycho I would just reach through the window. Also, on Red Forest sure the saw can‚Äôt reach around entirely but Billy can still move so...
---
Well every survivor must be bad because I do this every game with nurse. No ruin btw
---
You only get gen rushed against a swf or if youre shit at the game.
---
I mean, that's probably the best explanation to why the MM is blitzed right now
---
One could look at what to wrote and easily assume you to be a killer-biased player. Context doesn‚Äôt matter here because you can really display tone of voice over the internet. 
---
1) I think the charge time is to compensate for the fact that, given the right situation, he can down over half the team. I‚Äôm betting 5 bucks that that would piss some people off considering he could very easily down you at that point. 
---
2) All 110% killer speeds have something going for them to allow them to overcome that issue. She‚Äôd be exactly like Billy where she could get up your ass for a free hit. (Hello iri head). I do agree on the map tho. Given the right looper, she can get actually destroyed with all the damn pallets and trucks in auto haven. 
---
3) Yeah if the survivor has sprint burst and time it right, they can just yeet the hit. I also want rule set to be automatic. SWFs absolutely ruins it because I‚Äôve had situations where they just 99% all gens and wait their friends to get off the hat. It‚Äôs annoying because it removes all pressure from the mechanic and turns it into a skill check simulator for the certain survivor. Also make it explode on hatch pls. 
---
4) Never understood Trapper and why he doesn‚Äôt actually start with traps. Little weird? Also carry more without having the usage of addons because I feel like Trapper mains don‚Äôt like trudging around finding the traps and resetting them constantly. 
---
5) So his reappearance? That would be pretty spooky. 
---
6) I think hag is in a pretty ok spot. I‚Äôm not sure how you could buff her either. Make her teleporting to a choice trap an actual thing without add ons so she can have way more map pressure. Or make it to where she can sense if a survivor crouched over a trap but it still won‚Äôt activate. Just a tiny warning indication. It would make survivors really careful about her traps. 
---
7) Bruh I love scratch mirror Myers on the cornfield. It‚Äôs absolute perfection. 
---
I‚Äôm really not a fan of bullying a killer simply because they have perks that you just can‚Äôt win against. You can‚Äôt do anything about BT, you can‚Äôt do anything about DS (sorta), you can‚Äôt do anything about Adrenaline. All and all, people who act as if they‚Äôre gods because they have ez perks are downright horrible for this game. 
---
I saw an idea I liked where small game gave you an indicator on how many totems were left. Bam, single players wouldn‚Äôt have to scout the map hoping to find totems that might not even exist and I don‚Äôt think that would piss the killers side off too much. No more ‚Äújust cleanse totems‚Äù to ‚Äúwell you had an indicator‚Äù which is completely true. 
---
TL;DR: I like some ideas and some add ons should be base for killers. All and all the devs really need to sit down and look at balance issues before any more cosmetics or events. Trust me, people want fixes over skins. 
---
Just admit you have a hard time getting jokes lol
---
Or, get this. You take a step forward and then hit them. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong because I‚Äôve never held a chainsaw in my life and the only time I‚Äôve seen one I almost killed my friend but I reckon it would be easy to move around the tree to hit someone. It‚Äôs not hard to hit someone with a melee weapon.
---
I don‚Äôt when I can tell they‚Äôre jokes. 
---
Idk maybe since I‚Äôm just a huge fan of horror I just love the adrenaline (no pun intended) rush I get from a Myers grabbing me off a gen because I didn‚Äôt bother paying attention. 
---
The closest thing to ‚Äúunsettling‚Äù we have is hag and even she‚Äôs funny. The fat man scares me more and that‚Äôs probably due to the outrageous jiggle physics he has when carrying you. Like dear lord it‚Äôs terrifying. 
---
But I get what you mean, make a killer who you actually want to avoid rather than giving you the cheap experience. 
---
As long as he dances like in the rats clip, I'm down for cardinal.
---
I'm a semi-casual player.  Meaning each season I play a few hours and get to maybe rank 14, 12 if I'm hustling with Freddy.  When I get a 3 or 4 kill game it seems like every 2 or 3 I'll be accused of cheating somehow because you're never supposed to win as Freddy.
---
Freddy's whole deal is tracking not chasing.  I let people go, follow their aura and sneak attack.  That's cheating...
---
Killers don't need buffs. If people want red rank killers to be improved, then what needs to happen is:
---
Nerfs to Nurse and Billy so people stop playing the OP AF killers.
---
Nerf gen rushing. When 95% of the games at red rank are over in &lt;5 minutes b/c of how strong gen rushing is, especially with SWF, it's telling as to why people only run the broken BS that can't be beaten like Nurse.
---
I‚Äôd like to raise you monstrous shrine/beast of pray there sir. 
---
I liked whispers for a while but then I realized that a good survivor can still hide from you so I eventually gave it up for something else. I‚Äôve seen M&amp;A on nurse and also MYC. It‚Äôs all up to how certain people want to play. My friend takes thanataphobia with his nurse. 
---
But again, Barbecue, Ruin, Nurses, and insert your favorite perk is still no variation. 
---
I think people do whispers because you can scout the area instead of random teleporting. I don‚Äôt play her at all so I don‚Äôt think my opinion would be much good.
---
It‚Äôs just player by player bases. 
---

How to commit karma suicide: DBD Edition.
---
If that‚Äôs true, that‚Äôs actually one of the more dumb things I‚Äôve heard from them. I love Queens faces sometimes when the head guy speaks. She looks so dead inside sometimes. Love how honest she is too about some of the bullshit when she streams. 
---
Yeah that‚Äôs just dumb. ‚ÄúHey you enjoy Freddy? Well whoopsies have fun getting your ass eaten by competent survivors.‚Äù That‚Äôs a horrible mentality and forces killers to pick between fun and viability. 
---
All preference buddy. 
---
I so want this to be true, I've been wanting Pyramid Head as a killer for so long. Not getting my hopes up though
---
I‚Äôve been thinking mummy since I saw the pic today, although silent hill would be cool
---
Good ole Cloopdoop
---
I think it will be some sort of 1000 years Inca Mummy Killer and the surv. an Indiana Johnes
---
Well windows are broken rn imo but I do agree that it shouldn‚Äôt make you immune. Anybody could just reach through and smack you. It‚Äôs just logical. 
---
Does it suck? Sure does. Viable? Sure is. 
---
Also can you clarify that he can ‚Äústill move‚Äù? As in, he can swing the chainsaw around a corner and it still connects? Sure wish that worked for Bubba. You so much as grace a pixel of a tree and he flips the fuck out. 
---
It consistently happens to me. I think there‚Äôs something wrong with my console. -.-
---
1) Sounds like a spookier legion. I like that. Gives him a different core gameplay and can apply more pressure on gen rushers as they have less incentive to group together. 
---
2) If they buffed her movement speed, they‚Äôd have to do it for every other 110% killer or the backlash would be gross. Plus doesn‚Äôt clown slow down when he reloads? A good huntress knows how to use her hatches. All it takes is good timing and good map knowledge to end survivors quickly. Just look at Scott, he‚Äôs an amazing huntress and completely works with her 110% speed. 
---
But yeah maps like Haddonfield can be a nightmare for her. I‚Äôve had some just DC on the spot because they don‚Äôt wanna deal with that shit. 
---
She‚Äôd remind me of legion to where she can just hug your ass with a hatchet and then 115% movement speed to you and down you. Or catch up rather quickly to throw another hatchet. 
---
3) Her traps are a dumb mechanic and people don‚Äôt care about it at all. If crouching were faster, she could actually scout out instead of hoping her terror radius would go away in time by running to them (also fun fact she‚Äôs the only female with 115% movement speed). 
---
 4) Yeah totally agree with you on that one. 
---
 5) Yes please give more stealthy killers. I hate killers that you can see from a mile away and hide from super easily. No pressure from that. 
---
6 ) Yeah I think Hag is better than what some people consider but she still needs just a tiny bit more buffs. 
---
7) Could you imagine that in movies. Him trying to swipe at a person and just having the lunge range of a small child. It sounds actually hilarious. 
---
But yeah, you‚Äôd think eventually after months of complaining something would be fixed. I guess in the end all we can do is tell the devs this and eventually they‚Äôll cave in. 
---
Hagrid?
---
I‚Äôve used one, numerous times and can confirm for you, it‚Äôs not as easy as you are thinking it is. 
---
Not to mention they aren‚Äôt exactly curved meaning to hit someone around a tree one would need to extend there arms out and turn the saw towards the tree from a very peculiar angle which would put the wielded at more risk of injury than the person who is being chased.
---
Idk about you but phantasms make me jump still lol even tho Ive played hag dozens of times 
---
Ingame power, Gamma correction, shit is 150/160/170% less Claudette friendly ingame. 
---
A return to the basics of M1 killing - nobody probably.
---
Do you think Billy really cares about hurting himself with his chainsaw? 
---
I love this lmao
---
I agree completely. 
---
&gt;and forces killers to pick between fun and viability
---
This. Survivors don't like just seeing Nurses and Billys at rank 1, and killers don't like being forced to play top tier killers or be *really, really* good at their chosen killer to be able to play the game at rank 1. The community's opinion clearly differs from the devs' opinion. 
---
Want me to send you a link on how to drop pictures

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnwdPlx9yR4&amp;list=WL&amp;index=15&amp;t=2105s
---
Literally the top comment on it.
---
Oh man what a shame for me wanting to play a game with my friends.
---
Onion or garlic? Night/garlic/old I‚Äôd say Vampire.
---
Does anyone see letters in a horizontal lines at the end of the incense burner? I know some people have translated some of the words on the weapons. I wonder if that translates to anything...
---
Tinkerer+ muffler+chainsaw file= free hits
---
We can hope so. Tiny changes should not be hard and most of these are reasonable and make sense. None fix gen rushing but make the game a bit more bearable. 
---
Oh, right. Forgot to complain about NoEd. /s
---
Change 1: Removed the suggestion for Skill Check chances. 
---
How is it now, you Commie bastards?
---
It‚Äôs def not, holding the game hostage is when you make it so it can‚Äôt progress 
---
Being viable does not matter when people want to win. It‚Äôs a fact that nurse, billy and spirit are the best killers in the game so the viability of other killers become irrelevant when players with nothing but victory (in most cases easy victories) reside in the rank of discussion. 
---
Viability merely means that the killer can do well at high ranks the majority of the time. This is something even ya boi Freddy can do and does constantly. I mean look at tru3 and honestly tell me that every killer isn‚Äôt viable. 
---
I do believe you may be confusing viability with playability. Players choosing to play the top few characters does not mean that the other killers are not viable, it‚Äôs simply due to players wanting to win with relative ease.
---
I've been playing as hex depression and when things go bad I go and sulk in my basement.
---
Yeah I do think gen rushing is a small problem and makes Ruin absolutely necessary otherwise you get torn a new one from good survivors. 
---
Also on a side note please fix totem placements. I can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve had a totem spawn right next to a gen and the survivor has no sense of urgency to find the totem. It‚Äôs just awful. Or it‚Äôs the swamp map and in such an obscure corner that you have to just complete all gens with the Ruin up anyway. 
---
Couldnt tell üòÇ
---
*Sighs in Freddy* 
---
I agree. Every killer should be fun and viable, and have at least a little built-in help in all areas of the game. Come on, devs.
---
I somehow never made this connection despite them being right next to each other... How I wanna try it üòÇ
---
Who uses WGLF on KYF? &gt;.&gt;
---
I mean yeah? At top ranks, I‚Äôm more than likely facing a good survivor so I need to play a good killer. 
---
And again, just because Tru3 can play Freddy well, all you see is his highlights and that doesn‚Äôt make him amazing. The best player could probably make any killer good. 
---
Viability is whether or not the killer can keep up with the steep curve that ranking up gives. So therefore, Billy is more viable than Pig, in any rank really. 
---
Devs should make it to where it‚Äôs less frustrating to play certain killers at high ranks. Nurse and Billy don‚Äôt hold much frustration because, like you said, you can win with relative ease. 
---
Therefore, buffing other killers would ensure that they also get some spotlight and make it better for both killers and survivors so there‚Äôs actually variation among red ranks. 
---
Was looking for this
---
i miss dodging SWFs
---
What‚Äôs green like? I hear it‚Äôs wonderful. :)
---
The fact that Ruin is demanded is absurd. Hell I want ruin BUFFED because it‚Äôs fucking useless when it spawns RIGHT NEXT TO THE FUCKING SURVIVOR. 
---
Gens are fucking stupid easy to do, but guess what? Devs thought survivors are fucking brainless babies and gave them an item that speeds up a fucking piss easy objective that took NO effort as is: The Toolbox
---
Here‚Äôs a complaint; Why do survivors even get items? It‚Äôs not like they have the easiest job on Earth as long as they communicate or something. Also why is there a perk that lets you heal yourself when the game already added an item that does this? I fucking hate items and I wish Franklins Demise was default on every killer, if I smack your dirty sorry survivor ass you‚Äôd better damn well drop that fucking toolbox. 
---
Hell, give killers the option to BREAK items on the floor. I‚Äôll stomp the shit out of your cheap fucking flashlight. Fuck that flashlight. 
---
Why can‚Äôt killers bring shit? It‚Äôs harder for them in every way if they play against good team, I want Leatherface to have a chair he can bring and yeet it at a gen, breaking it. 
---
And the guy taking the photo is in the parallel locker
---
Devs are goofy. I wish that they could have a sit down stream and actually address all the issues but I have no idea if that would happen. Especially how blind they are with some issues.

---
No one dced!.They pallet stunned me many times but i didnt get stunned,just teleported to the otherside of the pallet.
---
YEET.
---
It‚Äôs pretty worthless if you‚Äôre good at hitting great skill checks
---
Stake out is terrible. Tinkerer is kinda good on billy if you have the silent add ons though 
---
Well it is the explanation.
---
Yea thats the explanation for these crazy matches
---
That's obviously the best drawing of the Wraith that the earth has ever seen and will see!
---
They'll never show Vigo or Benedict, that'd end one of their only plot hooks.
---
&gt; So how would you recommend nerfing them? And also the biggest point was that every killer isn‚Äôt nearly as OP as Billy and Nurse so everyone thinks you HAVE to play them to succeed in red ranks. That‚Äôs the huge problem.
---
For Billy, some combination of removing one shot chainsaws, make the turn raidus on a chainsaw rush significantly less (seriously, this mfker can turn better than Leatherace with chainsaw), dramatically slow the Chainsaw rush/make the distance significantly less, and increased time to rev up the chainsaw.
---
For Nurse, removing extra blink would be a start, but I think she basically needs a rework. Being able to blink from one end of the map to the other, being able to ignore pallets and windows, and being unloopable are just fundamental issues. She's a product of the past when DBD was a different game.
---
&gt;Killers having to rely on add ons to be viable means bad core gameplay. You can destroy people without addons with some killers and with others you‚Äôre fucked without them. That‚Äôs not good design, and almost a lazy one.
---
I agree 100%.
---
&gt;Especially my boi Freddy. SWF wreck him and anyone who can loop decently wrecks him as well. He needs something to help him along. There‚Äôs a reason why everyone makes fun of him.
---
He could use a buff, but he's oppressive at low ranks, which is why he'd never be buffed (another just terribly designed killer).
---
i like playing against legion, i never liked playing against freddy
---
Weapons spear and a secondary bow and arrow attack.

---
Thanks for the reply and advice :) I dont usually like to play petty because I dont normally need to be but I like the idea of penalizing the one person who's being toxic. Sometimes I bring an ivory in anticipation of someone being toxic lmao
---
I am very aware, being a rank 1 killer who uses mainly Trapper, Clown and Leatherface. But I recognize they are too weak.
---
Also Clown is like, the 4th best killer in the game. He is nowhere near garbage like the others.
---
If you're at a vault and the killer fakes going around the wall to meet you at the other side of the vault but actually doubles back wouldn't you want to have vaulted? I'm having trouble visualizing your post.
---
Howd they preview Clown? 
---
I don't like to be that way but sometimes you have to with dbd 
---
Papa Emeritus!

I would be more excited by bug fixes, tbh.

I might be grasping for straws but the quote involves light, generators are one of two light sources (I can remember of the top of my head) the other being barrels. I believe the power will somehow effect generators in some fancy way or another. Maybe forcing survivors to seek out a source of light (complete gen or barrel) to cleanse an effect.
---
&gt;	To kill takes patience. It takes skill. It takes intellect and planning.
---
Lol and you're  right on that. So why don't you want to keep it that way?

His ppwer is his natural sex appeal. Survivors just run to him, because he is that good looking
---
Why?  Why even bother to do this?  This might be the laziest post I‚Äôve seen here. In a land of shit posts, this is just diarrhea. 
---
She looks like a shrek baby.
---
Learning nurse is hellish. Suddenly almost everything you know about being a killer gets thrown out so your basically relearning how to play the game and survivors emboldened by your poor performance start taunting you relentlessly because suddenly they think they‚Äôre gods. Every time I try to learn nurse I spend about ten matches going at it before giving up. You never feel more impotent as a killer than when learning nurse which is the exact antithesis of what your meant to feel like when playing killer. 
---
Rant over. 
---
Good luck with your nurse practice. It is possible to succeed, I‚Äôve encountered a few truly devastating nurses and they‚Äôve all left an impression. 
---
This is one of two licensed killers that I desperately want. The other being Pinhead on aesthetics alone.   Unfortunately, the new killer is most certainly not Candyman. 
---
Ooh, that would make for a really interesting killer power!
---
The bullying was fun though haha 
---
i thought the phrase was knife through hot butter though
---
4th best killer in the game? I consider him the worst killer, with maybe some argument that he's better than like Pig or Myers, but not even close to upper tier. Nurse, Billy, Hag, Huntress, Spirit, and Legion are all for sure better than him in basically every situation. Why would you consider him 4th best?
---
* No downsides
---
* Can fuck up loops like no one else
---
* Can mindgame
---
* Bloodpoint machine
---
* Bottles give you free hits in the open
---
* Can help you find people
---
He is barely out of S tier. Just the mere fact that his only downside is a short reload animation you can do at anytime puts him this high. Bottles do more then you think.
---
My Boartress is gonna disagree with that
---
Joke post? Dwight is up there. 
---
Man this format is ancient, haven't seen it in forever.

Always liked it though, so thx for the nostalgia OP!

Ummmmm, I was looking for the Claudette but I got distracted by two of those usernames..... üò≥

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying!

Good thing, F13 may be on it's way out due to legal disputes

THANK YOU

Didn‚Äôt they also say no clowns?
---
Seems to happen a lot more recently. Not sure why. 
---
I throw few IZI DUUUUUUD just to trigger inner Ochido in them and then snack on popcorn while they type away how "shit I am" then ask if I and hit what level of trash are you to die from me?!? Then some more popcorn while they curse on xD
---
About how long was it between teasers and the release for past killers? Love the theory btw 
---
Told me that Shrek is gonna roll
---
for context: i only bought legion because i had some left over aluric cells and i really wanted the Susie cosmetic, and before this match i only played killer twice and that was with michael. i loaded in and found a meg, and we messed around a little and i hooked her once and got her down maybe twice or three times? then i hit a claudette and quentin once each, i never saw the fourth survivor lol. they were good sports and weren‚Äôt toxic at all towards me when they saw how bad i was at killer, it was a good game even though i absolutely sucked ! 
---
art in its purest form
---
Wtf is going on here 
---
Not sure if anyone noticed, but it is highly important to identify the killer: These small round things on the rectangle-formed object hanging below the onion have small symbols on it. First one is a questionmark, second is a -, third seems to be a 0, after that it is a + and I cant recognize the last symbol. What do you think?
---
(Sorry for bad description)

He will get banned by the system or the devs for ban evasion, something he would have to do if he were to move to another platform again.
---
What's going on in he...
---
...*NICE*.
---
I really didn't have a direction i just made this for fun what about you
---
I understand the reference and love everything about it. 
---
The politics of legally distinct because he looks a hell of a lot like the surgeon

Did you try to bodyblock myers while he‚Äôs stalking?
---
Me choking my meat

Lol I'm molest me myers XD
---
Imagine walking and thinking that you are bugged and cant move only to realize there is a claudette there
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ do you and moist for Myers know each other or just share the same murder kink?? 
---
Kinda hard when she literally isn‚Äôt there. Thought maybe in front of you or around you but if you zoom in you can see grass so that‚Äôs a no go.

He got a shirt with a striped pattern in one of his alternative base skins but I'd hardly call it a "Mime" skin.

Oh my bad, I haven‚Äôt played in awhile, couldn‚Äôt quite remember the skin.
---
Bc she does this thing called ‚ÄúSurviving‚Äù It‚Äôs something good players do consistently, so I don‚Äôt expect you to understand why she is there
---
exactly why people shouldnt get excited for chapters.
---
if youre expectations are set lower than legion status then you cant be disappointed if the chapter is bad as well.
---
It was a really obvious joke though. The people here are really dumb and can say really dumb shit. They aren't that dumb though
---
Oh. But you are. So.. Grossly Incandescent.
---
How do people not realize that was a joke
---
No fucking clue
---
I'm not exactly sure how the flags and killers are related TBH, I believe Freddy was England and The Pig was Finland but I don't see a connection there. Only thing I can think of for Legion is that he runs fast and I think a really fast Olympic runner came from Kenya?
---
It actually sounds awful. If he can curse you like freddy can drag you to dream world with the press of a button and its unlimited curses, and you have to go to the basement, when oh boi camping will be on another level.
---
But literally everyone bullies me when I play doc :( I just unlocked spirit to spook people. 
---
Honestly, hill billy is really good though, if he was as fun as the doc and spirit, I would main him too. Nurse is fun too, but tiring. 
---
A zero TR Billy chainsawing your ass from across the map is about as scary as finding out it‚Äôs Hag from a trap. 
---
Cant wait for the bible dlc 
---
Paulie esther mentioned it in one of his videos before either the spirit or the legion was released. Some chinese or something "leaked" it.
---
Should also note, on PS4, I think spirit is the most common killer I see in red ranks. Almost every killer is spirit or billy pretty much. Huntress and nurse aren't as OP on PS4. 
---
So basically its just extremely obscure hints. 
---
puke
---
Turning off messages would probably be your best bet if it starts to bother you. It doesn't really matter what killer you are or even how good you are, people that want to be toxic will be toxic and it's those people that you should be laughing at instead. 
---
When someone goes out of their way to bm you with messages I always just laugh. Like, it's only a game at that kind of attitude is just sad. If someone is intentionally trying to make you feel bad, what kind of life have they lived to be so angry at people? This really only applies to messages though and I'm not including in the heat of moment messages. Plenty of people send those and likewise shouldn't be taken seriously. 
---
In game teabagging and flash clicking are just kind of part of the experience toxic or otherwise. They're taunts and the job of a taunt is to throw you off your game. It's no different from t-bagging in a shooter after killing someone or using taunts in smash after a ko. Some people handle taunts better than others and the best way to get better at handling them is to handle them even more. You can only see so many t-bags before you just get numb to it or the very least, not bother you as much.
---
This is all just from my own experiences though so others may have better advice for you. Also, best of luck on the nurse. \^\_\^ I'm also trying to learn her as I'm working on my last few trophies and I also have about 50/50 luck in my games.
---
Yeah, but if you would like to change the name and other parts about it you can
---
...then learn how to use him 
---
What if there is a cooldown per survivor for the curse? What if the time doesn't go down whilst in a chase? What if the curse makes you exposed after a while? Still a pretty cool idea IMO.
---
Do we know when they will release more info? I'm actually really excited lmao
---
Most likely
---
a. You have to report killers steam profile in steam after match
---
b. Report it to bhvr on their websites form
---
c. Have video evidence
---
Kill you later, ya Catholic sociopath. OOPS TAUTOLOGY!
---
For a sec I thought you just wanted us to find the words for you
---
I'm not positive, but I believe it was about a month between initial teaser and release give or take.
---
Where is no such thing as hot butter, as it would just melt. Alsnana is correct.
---
Who cares about the chat? You already won and kicked their asses. The last picture isn't accurate at all since they can't actually hurt you... 
---
"Evil Within 3 must be ending soo-"
---
Ayyyy it's me dude, got smoked with the infinite load screen. Sorry boys 
---
Nothing is really for sure yet. I'm pretty sure with legion they had teasers like one day after another, but with spirit I think they took a couple days to a week to do another teaser.
---
DBD has cost me 3 controllers that have a drift that slowly gets worse. I play on xbox.
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse is probably best for myers. Surveillance has become an extremely powerful perk, but I find I get the most use out of it when playing stealth or high mobility killers that can capitalise on the information. 
---
Damn, the Devs trying really hard to get us to buy them.
---
Open the picture again. Look for her glasses. Shes there 
---
Lol bingo 
---
The new killer will be onion man.
---
I hope the new survivor is like Meg 2.0
---
This would be so cool!
---
O HAI, HAG!
---
So anyway, how's your sex life?
---
Simply amazing.
---
It is about time Dev releases mummy as the new killer
---
Dwight‚Äôs head looks small
---
&gt; players should also have reduced movement speed while dreaming
---
no.
---
why? because speed is too important in this game and people dont seem to get that - sprint burst being nerfed a dozen times, or seeing a killer get way faster with noed just shows my point, and theres a reason why they have hefty cooldowns / are end game perks / require you to do wonky mechanics with the obsession to get speed boosts, and thats because speed increase/decreases are no joke, and shouldnt be given to people if it has no "catch" (ending chase with obsession, needing to get to end game, needing to recharge exhaustion) or downside to it (reloading bottles, totem can be cleansed)
---
its safe to say that pressing m2 on a survivor as freddy is far from skillful, and it already gives situational wallhacks ontop of a -50% action speed penalty - a permanent speed reduction as well would be too much
---
possible vampire?
---
I mean...it still looks like he skipped leg day tho. &gt;.&gt;
---

bad killer facecampes. Shit happens, don't blame him, blame the game to allow that.

But it isn't really a mime outfit

Its not black metal, you can actually read this

On that skin, he has skulls everywhere

Franklins and trap the item... I know what I'm doing later for fun.
---
a few months ago I was in the same boat, "why would people DC?" i would say....but after playing for several months now and the amount of bullshit I've had thrown my way whether it's 
---
lag
---
tunneling
---
bad hitboxes
---
killers DCing
---
OP perks/mori's
---
general toxicity
---
I fully understand why people would rage quit on this game because with this game it is totally fair to say quite a large portion of times you get downed or caught isn't down to skill it's down to flaws with the game, which those playing have no control over hence why they'd feel hard done by.
---
I do use Lf sometimes, cuz it's always fun to confuse people with PWYF 3 stack on him :)
---
When I looked up the crosses I came by the kabbalah tree of life which lines up with the image. Which brought me to the emanations/Angelarium. I'd say its gonna be a priest and an angel/demon being. And I also found this https://www.angelarium.net/treeoflife#/tifiret/ could be a mirror image of the Wraith.
---
I don't like low POV and/or slow speed. The killer doesn't have to be super powerful but I don't like to feel like a slug or relay on my power too much. I main Wraith, Trapper, Clown and Billy. 
---
Dude, don't get me wrong I didn't blame him at all. It's been happening more frequently recently, it seems like a lot of people do it more now than they used to. I didn't yell at him in after chat or anything. 
---
HALLELUJAH!
---
Honestly I have no idea.
---
"I'm kinda a veteran to DBD"
---
 Been around since clown LOL. On a serious note if you always get face camped assuming you mean every match my only suggestion would be to get out of the rank area you are usually in.
---
Man I'm not even sure if the "leak" was real. Let's just wait until he releases and we'll see. 
---
Nah, I meant that if you don't bm as survivor (tea bagging etc), that the chance of being facecamped is reduced. Because it can be frustrating as a killer if someone teabags after every pallet he throws down. 
---
That happened to me. The only reason i knew she was there was because i couldnt go forward so i started slashing. They are so crafy. 
---
Ah fuck me mis-interpreting shit. My bad.
---
 What is the problem? I hit rank 1 like 5 months ago and i still think that freddy is an op killer. Yea, you lose time by putting the survivor in dream word, but you have pressure on the map. When you have 4 srvs in the dream state you know everything and they are under pressure cuz they know you can see them. I hate matching up against freddy cuz of that presure he could get on the map. It is just my opinion, i can be wrong
---
Happy now ?
---
New ability: fucking YEET her hand at someone with magnetic force
---
1. No 2. It'ts to spread the scratch marks further apart making them harder to follow.
---
More killer the better
---
How RECKLESS of you (badum tss)
---
Try playing as killer more than once or twice and you magically won‚Äôt complain about them
---
imho knight is always the best option. great stats overall, good survivability / tankiness as well as the ability to kite easily. he also has one of the strongest starting items in the game
---
Well what are survivors supposed to do then if looping is off the table
---
Hopefully your last
---
Yes we get it I posted on the wrong sub
---
Trapping all the pallets and saying "you thought" when they try to loop me. I also like getting billy and blindly charged the exit gates. So far i get there before people realize im charging. I also love getting billy and running circles around rotten fields. 
---
I think what the other 2 guys said is great. Maybe take a few games and play casually. Dont necessarily go for kills. Just practice aiming at a moving target. If you get a 0k 8 times not big deal. If you get a 1k you are doing better. If you regularly are getting at least a 2k go back to playing regularly with you better hatchet throws.
---
I have actually played him enough to the point I get 3 to 4k each time. The chainsaw means bussiness. 
---
It worked to probably the extent of finding more games quickly and less queue times. But now it‚Äôs hurting low rank players
---
It really depends on your rank. People can say trapper but I destroy with him. Then again i main survivor so my killer is rank 16-19 and i know every spot to place those traps. I know wraith got buffed but i would still say wraith. Possibly legion. He is trash without certain addons.
---
It‚Äôs the new ‚ÄúI‚Äôm vegan btw‚Äù 
---
also Ochido kinda ruined Claudette, all his wanna-be imposters play her 
---
can't wait for devs to finally brighten up the blood on her p3 outfit so it is actually red(ish) instead of pitch black. also her other outfits could use a little color rework too, because right now in a game that bacially is a glorified mix of a game of tag and hide and seek having innate camo is just an adventage over other survivors, while they are supposed to be more or less equal
---
i was just trying to retarget killer animation to survivor including facial expression bumped into some issues but was able to solve them.. so just shared it here. these were hand made for spirit so definitely would looks best on her :P
---
I got a full team of rank 20-15 survivors as a killer, I‚Äôve never felt so bad before. 
---
Eac can be pretty buggy and even gives that message when nobody is cheating. 
---
Good killers know where to look for the first survivors and they might have had whispers on aswell. This goes for hiding in a locker aswell.
---
Well, you can start off by saying what platform youre on
---
There are cherub angel faces on it, so i don't see it being incan....
---
Its just like that on pc sometimes, just wait in the lobby, maybe do something else while you wait
---
Nice. 
---
I've tried it for fun. They are shit.
---
This. Give us Laurie's 2018 skin too (with shotgun on the back). Oh, don't forget the hammer (before he got his kitchen knife back) for ma boi Myers.
---
I run everywhere with sprint burst. Just wait until exhaustion is almost gone and run to pause it. When you want it to activate just stop running for a second.
---
Like rank 1 survivors don't play like that lmao
---
Hell, I would too. Even as a killer I'd be bloody terrified if a swarm of claudettes started circling me like vultures.
---
It was looking kinda ma uncle
---
Why, oh why would you use deliverance when I'm a foot away from your hook?
---
Same , problem is I have exams so I'll not even be able to test him √ß_√ß 
---
Fuckin‚Äô Pichael
---
Eugh. Gunna need territorial Emperrative  then I guess 
---
You're pointless.
---
The ping hurt me more tbh 
---
I love the game but right I'm struggling to enjoy it as much as I used to, partly because of me but most of the push factor is the bugs and other issues in the game

How can they expect anything when they can't see your name pre-game though?
---
So you want to give yourself an advantage over others? No one enjoys the loud ass chase music but its like that for a reason, without it locating survivors would be ridiculously easy.

Ghostface would be cool! He could run at you with his knife at a high speed and stab you a lot! Oh.. Wait.. /s

Dwight steps in a trap sitting in the middle of the open.
---
Baby Claudette gets scared and tries to immerse herself in a locker, only to find another survivor has been hiding from the killer in there since the match started.
---
Somewhere, a David with a BPS is watching from the tip of a hook, calmly surrendering all hope of rescue.

i really won‚Äôt touch legion again honestly. i have no idea how to properly play them and their power gets me really confused and disoriented in-game. when i do eventually play killer again though, it‚Äôll definitely be with michael!

&gt;A good killer wont let you cleanse it if theyre not camping
---
No camping = free unhook.
---
&gt; and if they are \[camping\], they have no reason to wait for you to unhook when they can instadown you 
---
Since they're camping, you look for the totem and safely cleanse. Then you can unhook
---
You seem to agree with the comment you replied to, so did you misread it or are you assuming that every single time the survivor gets hooked it's right next to the totem, so there's no way to save?
---
Or, they could do something with lockers. Or his phone. Or having two killers at the same time.
---
I'm sure that will help a lot!
---
This is like The Grudge!  Fantastic.  
---
I see Billy‚Äôs running it leather face running it does not matter. It always makes me sad to see a killer using NOED. It bothers me even more when a killer has not got anyone all game but then gets you with NOED and then hits you on the hook shaking his head like he did some amazing play 
---
Where is it said anywhere here that looping is toxic 
---
Eh, NOED itself doesn‚Äôt bother me because realistically it doesn‚Äôt come into play much, both when I‚Äôm survivor and killer. It just triggers me to see killers with one shots running it on top of their one shots
---
Did you brighten the garage?
---
[visible disappointment]
---
What sounds OP about it? If he cmps the basement or something he can't defend gens. It's not like the curse is going to prevent you from doing actions. Assuming this leak is even real, I'm not surprised people are already screaming "OP".
---
You like playing against legion? Well according to the subreddit your opinion is wrong and you should uninstall.
---
I have roughly 1200 hrs in this game, most of them being survivor. I play killer for dailys and had to do trapper. I really like him. Since I know pretty much every common area survivors run, that's where I place my traps and I always get people in them. After someone stepped in my trap 2 times I'll move it from that spot since at least 2 people know where it is. I place my traps and let them do the work while I patrol gens. Whispers helps too. I'm no experienced killer but i am very much so survivor and i play thinking what i would do or where i would be if i were trying to kill me. It helps.
---
Top right corner. 
---
If you win, you're a cheater. If you lose, you're a baby killer and should commit suicide.
---
Welcome to the killer main club, you get used to it.
---
Freddie was played by the actor Robert Englund in the films which is close to England? So maybe the references are just completely obscure but they are still clues, who knows 
---
Just read trough the comments, it is now a discussion of this issue. And hes right about writing this, way too many (evidently long term players) defending this. 
---
He might mean during the dream transition, not when fully asleep. The action speed penalty is meaningless since it's easy as fuck to wake up if you're not an idiot. The only good thing about sleeping them is that they're easy to see. 
---
Oh I get it. Still gonna look all over the map for the NOED and probably die every time tho.
---
Hi!
---
Lmao @the literal infants defending DC'ing because "it's the killer's fault"
---
Definitely helps learn where pallets and windows will be in a map, once you've played a while it's extremely hard to justify keeping it over other skills though.
---
This is why you should check the back of your car.
---
Ya honestly that is the one thing I‚Äôd not blame people from straight up DS for as it‚Äôs just not fair period 
---
Still too dark
---
Cool fanart! Mind if i use top left as steam profile pic? Pleaaaase :)
---
This is dope!
---
This.
---
It‚Äôs a baby angel, a cherub, if you will. This plus the censer leads me to believe the next killer may be a priest or a reverend, or on the flip side, a nun. 
---
Are you okay? I always go for the farmer because its just karma for trying to get the other killed. Slap that bitch straight on that hook. 
---
I don't know what everyone else thinks but it looks like a Greek Omega to me
---
I do like to level my lover skill ^^/s
---
^^it's ^^lower ^^*
---
I dont like tinkerer because it's obvious when they have it, even on a billy. Any perk that is obvious just let's me dodge them completely but I can see why people like it.
---
If you stack up all three tokens you can go up to 10% faster, I do agree it‚Äôs a little weak only because getting the tokens consistently is such a pain, but when you get that extra speed it‚Äôs so much fun.
---
The original is from the TV show "Silicon Valley".
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse would love this!
---
Not trying to sound rude but yes almost everyone noticed. 
---
It's just the community, whatever change or addition happens people will cry that it's overpowered or whatever the fuck, I'm a survivor main, I don't feel NOED is overpowered, just in the same way I feel that DS wasn't overpowered because it can only be used once, I don't mind the change they did because it will prevent some sort of tunneling by the killer.
---
Legion isn't overpowered, he's just unfun to play against.
---
Freddy isn't shit, his endgame is amazing with remember me, noed, blood warden, 4th perk of your choice.
---
Killers in general aren't underpowered, a perfectly capable killer can control the game and kill all survivors, even if gen rushing. 
---
This game does have game breaking bugs, lag issues because of dedicated servers, etc. 
---
However I think there's something the devs should do about tunneling/facecamping with killers. I don't think that the penalty of losing time or one tier on an emblem at the end of the game cause of proximity to the hooked is enough. It's really scummy, especially when you get into a game with an instadown killer, get downed instantly, go to the basement and get insidious facecamped.
---
I think the game is balanced how it is, maybe needs more balancing on some bits, but nothing here is that overpowered or underpowered. Now can we please stop crying about it?
---
Legion is a bit of a mess right now. Myers is a really strong killer and most survivors love coming up against him because he's sp00ky especially combined with monitor and abuse (reduces his terror radius). You can grab people off generators in evil within 1 because combined with M and A you have no terror radius. I wish you could see their reaction when that happens 
---
Holding the game hostage is bannable. Good luck with that 
---
Tbh I think things will get better when we get dedicated servers. Will fix a lot of my current issues with the game as far as weird lag and such. Imo both sides have equally shitty things they can do to eachother. I think the DS changes are a great step in the right direction. Only other things I would currently change is a slight nerf to Self-Care, NoED and being shown as Exposed as soon as the last gen is finished, and having a way to track how many totems are in the game. (Like, a little number somewhere by the number of gens, or maybe on the top right corner. Would just make it easier for everyone to keep track of, on both killer and survivor side.) Only other thing I could complain about is Nurse, but Nurse is kinda it's own can of worms that could probably consume an entire subreddit.
---
(Also, as someone who doesn't even play much killer, I feel like it's more annoying overall... it seems like a lot more survivors BM or be toxic compared to Killer, but I personally think it's less that survivors are more toxic and it's moreso just that you play against more survivors then killers, so you're more likely to run into a bad egg.)
---
This would be a great skin
---
I still just want shaggy as killer. But if I didn‚Äôt get shaggy I would be fine with Shrek.
---
Dude, last night I has someone flame me because "they hate Clown", and another left because I was "bullying him when he has No Mither" (He kept running into me).
---
You don't have to do anything to cause salt but play as killer.
---
Lamps are not the End.

Dbdgonewild back at it again 
---
Damn this is a solid tactic. I couldn't bring myself to kill any of them.
---
Don‚Äôt chase him then, go after someone else. If you play into their hands and chase the looper, you‚Äôve already lost, it‚Äôs what they want you to do 
---
Spine chill is a 5x better version of premonition. Premonition is pretty awful tbh
---
I've heard Tinkerer can be half decent on some killers because it makes for easier surprise attacks. I ended up grabbing Predator for the Bloodpoints because it's already teachable. 
---
Love/hate relationship with dead hard for sure
---
Deus Vult! - You charge your blade with holy fervor, causing a radial blind after a 2 second delay. Any survivors blinded by the light of God suffer tremendously from the hindered status because they're fucking heretics. You are inmune to blinds because you are a good a Christian. Cooldown of 20 seconds, any stuns inflicted on you refresh the ability immediately.
---
Perk 1: Emperor's Glare - You become obsessed with one survivor. Each time your obsession performs an altruistic action in your terror radius, gain a token. Max four tokens. For each token increase the hook progression of all other survivors by 10/15/25%. Struggle becomes a series of skill checks while this perk is active.
---
I can't think of any other perks. And this is obviously a joke but I want a knight now.
---
Why fix things we make when we can just make more characters and they'll throw money at us? - Behavior Probably
---
Feels bad man. All those bloodpoints, wasted. 
---
uhm.... could you link it? research purposes
---
I read this entire passage in Jeremy Dooley's "Detective on Duty!" voice. I couldn't help it. Well written nonetheless. 
---
That‚Äôs generally what they reserve mid chapters for.
---
I gave them bloody, only one random gave himself bonus. Lucker
---
I was waiting for it to load
---
It happened to all of us in gsme at the same time.
---
Wraith with a lucha libre mask... omg that would be hilarious
---
There is a difference between being challenged and impossible bullshit. There is a point where the "challenge" provided is at a level that allows no gain whatsoever. The entire ranking system is there to provide a challenge without causing the impossible bullshit.
---
There is a reason why such systems exist. Not just there, but in real life too. You dont put starting lightweight boxers against some heavyweight pro.
---
You really have to enlarge to picture, the giveaway is her glasses, look for the frames
---
So i guess what you're saying is all those Rank 1 SWF groups that play together nightly have a 100% Survival Rate each night, correct?
---
And Rank 1 Killers who pretty much face almost nothing but Rank 1 SWF have a 100% lose rate, correct?
---
And that anytime the SWF DO die, it's because the killer got EXTREMELY lucky, right?
---
We all know the game wasn't balanced around SWF but you're kidding yourself and being overtly dramatic to claim no matter how good you are, you can't counter a good SWF.
---
If that were true, no one would play Killer....
---
I play SWF nightly. We're all Rank 1 and heavily coordinated. Guess what? We still get wrecked in half our matches. Some nights we escape near every match, some nights we ger owned in most matches, other nights we hit 50/50 or 60/40, 40/60.
---
BHVR even put out stats that stated that Survivors escape about 50% of the time on average and Killers get at least 2 hooks on average at Rank 1.
---
And let's not pretend that a Rank 18 getting paired with all Rank 1's currently is much different than 3 Rank 1's in a SWF with their Rank 18 friend who's hosting.
---
That kinda shit has existed forever now and guess what? People still manage to work their way up as a Killer despite it.
---
So whatever point you had was lost when you tried to dramatize it up like good SWF groups are impossible to beat.
---
Wtf it‚Äôs so dark I can‚Äôt see shit still! Please make it brighter
---
Lol you right I‚Äôm stupid hahaha
---
Franklin‚Äôs is wonderful when you see a four man spawn in with flashlights and Merlot‚Äôs, trust me.
---
180k Bloodpoints. But like i said, i had we\`re gonna live forever. So it helped me.
---
Omg it looks awesome! You always make such good things &lt;3
---
Wow awesome
---
Knew a guy who'd do this to derank, his logic was he gets a game and has fun, then when he dies or is about to escape he dc's so he double depips
---
NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH!!!!
---
New chapter leak!!
---
[insert cool franchise here]
---
Did you not see the words in the bottom left corner that say ‚ÄúFIND THE EXIT‚Äù? 
---
Exactly!!! Had that rank 20 killer killed one or two of them they wouldn't have posted it.

Are you serious? He can see every survivor location in every moment just by getting slow as a snail and pressing a button? Wow, no I understand why I couldn't hide from him... (still a noob here!)

New survivor: Cerment

OLD MEME
---
If you DC because I didn‚Äôt follow your made-up rules, you‚Äôre bitch made.
---
It would give you even greater map preassure not less, without the sound Survivors only have the HB and their eyes to see the billy coming.
---
I have noticed it when i mostly play killer. Sometimes the killer just studder steps forward all game. Survivor doesnt really do it. I assumed it was my controller and switched to my better one which worked but it only happens in this game. 
---
GOD YES
---
A decent Billy has all of that but AoE damage, which is largely useless, including everything Billy inherently has.
---
Probably wrapped in barbed wire as well. 
---
fucking god please no
---
Haven't done that yet, F to you
---
wow another killer not getting 1 kill even with noed, lmaooooo
---
uuuhm, wrong subreddit?
---
same energy as Aqua saying "You're too late" tbh.
---
Noed is good on any killer lol
---
No, it‚Äôs not. 
---
STAY OUTTA BUBBAS BASEMENT
---
Fixing their game doesn't generate revenue. Pumping out cosmetics and adding more DLCs do. 
---
What other killers then? It‚Äôs a free M1 down for boosted killers with a haste effect
---
Huntress is currently the oldest, from early 1900s. Devs said this on stream when talking about how the new killer will be the oldest ‚Äúby a long way‚Äù. 
---
No ed isn‚Äôt really that good at all, it is half the time a waste of a perk slot, and it could be avoided.
---
Could you imagine the point getting tjsy could be done? It's unreal
---
That‚Äôs not holding the game hostage. Holding the game hostage is when the killer traps somebody in a corner and doesn‚Äôt move. The person trapped in the corner literally can‚Äôt do anything even if the rest of the team escapes. The only way to get out is to DC. 
---
Survivors can hold the game hostage by going to an area of the map that the killer can‚Äôt go to or can‚Äôt reach them - like on top of a rock or something similar - and staying there. Creeping around the map as immersed Claudette, though annoying af, is not holding the game hostage because the killer will eventually find them. 
---
He‚Äôs my favorite for that reason. I mean, that comes with a drawback: you can‚Äôt hit anyone unless they‚Äôre asleep and they can wake up easily.
---
You need to keep up pressure when you‚Äôre Freddy. Fire Up really helps. Also, the fact that you can put both the rescuer and the unhooked survivor to sleep during rescues helps. That‚Äôs the big thing to take advantage of.
---
Kind of like how killers punish good loopers and face camp them. Both sides are a lot of dicks.
---
not sure what you mean by tjsy 
---
yea, dedicated servers will help a ton. i believe a good change to help with NOED would be to make small game have a totem counter, like a stack number but showing how many totems are left. Selfcare should just have a slow decrease on heal progression when u stop healing urself (this would only be for selfcare). Nurse is difficult, as shes skill based. the extra blinks is where her problem is, and hitboxes.
---
As a killer main, more survs than killers are toxic, but if you can handle the bm its just a normal game really.
---
Do you do the trick where you follow them with your back turned? 
---
thats where i feel the problem is
---
It‚Äôs never a complete waste though is it
---
If you are on the hook, it is better to fight to gain time for the other survivor to find the hatch. Usually, when there are two people left and one is hooked, killer stays close just in case the other will come to unhook (plus if you are fighting,  he may think you are doing it because you are going to be saved). 
---
The devs have stated (it even got posted on the reddit not too long ago because of a thread about hiding to hold the game hostage) that hiding around the map without making any attempt to progress the game for an extended period of time is holding the game hostage, and should you record 5-10 minutes of you just patrolling all the gens and clearly nothing is happening then you can submit it to the devs and the survivor will get reprimanded. 
---
They do act on a case by case basis though, so it‚Äôs not like you can force a survivor into a ban, but obviously if they watch the footage and they can tell the guy is just hiding to be a prick then he will get a temp ban.
---
No it‚Äôs not. Unless the survivor is using an exploit ... which in this case they clearly weren‚Äôt ... they can‚Äôt hold a game hostage. It is a killers fucking job to find and kill them. Are you seriously that bad of player? 
---
Mommy the survivors are hiding and won‚Äôt let me kill them wahhhhhhhhh! 
---
So two out of 14 Killers aren't great? So what? With the inherent nature of this game's asymetrical design we're lucky that more than half, yet alone **86%** of the Killers are well designed. ~~Let's not discuss iffy Killers like Amanda RNG, Barbeque and Facecamp, Top Tier Default Killer, Broken Hitboxes, or Broken Hitboxes on the Floor.~~
---
I'm really sick of people bitching about how this game is dead and the devs don't know what two plus two equals because they messed up two out of 14 times. There's a lot of problems with this game but honestly in terms of Killers... they did a pretty good job so far.
---
Why is this toxic post being upvoted?
---
Get better. Practice makes perfect dawg, Monto wasn‚Äôt that good when he started, Panda makes mistakes all the time and is still a dece player, you just gotta stick to it. At the end of the day it‚Äôs just a game, like I tell everyone I talk to about this shit, we‚Äôre just here to enjoy the game and have fun, fun isn‚Äôt always winning, some of my best games I have lost but enjoyed thoroughly because it was so god damn intense and enjoyable. If you want to stop being trolled by toxic players, you either gotta get better than them or just not care in the end ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
neither do I, and it‚Äôs more fun playing without it. But it still secures kills, it‚Äôs an overpowered crutch
---
I mean...... There is already a swamp level....... But..... That does look like an onion....
---
He could have an achievement tied to his ability called game ogre
---
Photoshop DJ Khaled' face onto the Dwight. It seems so fitting
---
Ahh ok, I figured the map was unnecessary but wasn't sure. One time when we had a killer that just wanted to farm I searched everywhere for the hatch but just couldn't find it
---
Wasn't sure if you had to have the map to make it actually visible and thought that it would only appear when only one person was left
---
Just have to put together a team now and it should be a piece of cake
---
There should be a skin for the diversion perk where you throw a water bottle
---
Unpopular popular opinion: Freddy isn't bad it's just that his strengths are not useful at high ranks and his weaknesses are.
---
The issue with Freddy is that tracking and game stall are not needed at high ranks. But being able to quickly down a Survivor and get them on a hook *is* necessary, as is a power that allows you to contest pallets or end a chase quickly. Freddy's power is the exact opposite of "ending a chase quickly" as you have to wait **7 seconds** to start a chase.
---
Freddy can still kill and he has his uses. Sleeping multiple Survivors does slow down the game and it can be very hard to escape Freddy after you're initially tagged. But a 20 minute chase you can't escape is just annoying. ~~Something something Legion.~~
---
Spelling maybe? It's better than sitting doing nothing I guess. I only got them when we had extra time after a movie was over but we didn't have time to start anything else 
---
I will call the police.
---
Seems unlikely. New killers DLC earns them money, fixing something they already sold doesn‚Äôt. It would be a good thing to do, but it doesn‚Äôt really seem to me their MO (recent DS changes aside).
---
That's interesting. I'm a little confused though, what symbol did you see that led you to the Tree of Life connection? As I mentioned, the solar cross certainly appears in many parts of culture, but I never would have made the Tree of Life connection as it usually is explicitly spread above and below, with nothing but the expanse on each side.
---
In addition, is there any reason that picture spoke to you? I'm not familiar with Lurianic Kabbalah, but as I understand it the sefirah in that form (Tiferet, for example) did not manifest as physical emanations. The emotional sefirah had a physical persona in Zeir Anpin. Would love to learn more!
---
Because there are quite a few killers in this sub who think this is a thing. It‚Äôs not. They‚Äôre just really bad at the game.
---
Console war doucher nonsense.
---
Most people see a leatherface and assume it‚Äôs an easy win because reddit told them that he‚Äôs bad.  If you end up getting chased by a LF who doesn‚Äôt respect pallets you‚Äôre more than likely going down
---
If you're talking to me, he literally says in the title" so you hold the game hostage" he didn't even explain a scenario, he straight up said it 
---
benny hill chase music!
---
I hate almost every second I play but I still love it more.
---
Seems like the camera is looking up at the object underneath some sort of building roof tops. The ornaments around the object also look rather Victorian.
---
My theory is that it's some sort of European Killer. Setting seems to indicate some sort of church or mosque.  
---
My theory is either a victorian vampire or some sort of Jack the Ripper type Killer. Hell maybe even both?
---
Seriously...I was a survivor main for a loooong time.  Every season since last August I'd get to rank 1 within two weeks and then watch with mild humor as the same survivors would stumble in a lobby and sandbag or work with the killer.  Post chat is something like "DURR ME LOVE SALT DURR"
---
Having fun as killer from ranks 16-10 for the last two seasons has renewed my interest.   
---
I'm with you man. The community loves going against him but personally I don't. I don't hate him but I prefer to not go against him because he's sp00ky and I like to know when the killer is close rather than get jumpscared out of nowhere, it does create for some funny moments though. (weird because I always run monitor and abuse) 
---
If too scared to have it fuel toxicity, it could still be a personal indicator. You only see your own inforamtion, which in turn help you to try and find where you should be working on. Kinda.
---
No one. NOED isn't a unique killer perk.
---
Off topic: so *that's* why the home-made cookies that kids would always bring to school were either deformed or crusty.
---
Had this happened with a leatherface they had ran eboni mori but got basement and great map to defend it so got the other two real quick. I got off my gen jumped in locker so he couldnt bbq me then immeresed around the map breaking totems looting chests just waiting.
---
When he stopped patrolling I worked a gen to 99% then went to the gen next to it. Finished then sprinted over and finished the 99% one. He came running. I looped him till I found hatch and got out. 
---
You dont need to give up or not do anything. Just gotta mission impossible that shit.
---
I‚Äôm aware üòê
---
NOED isn't even good.
---
I pulled the trigger a few months back and paid the $5 for barbecue. Worth it. 
---
Highly recommend you do
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn977W9HjWM
---
Hatch should only open if the last survivor did at least 2 gens worth of progress.
---
A glowing 1000 degree hot knife through butter?
---
Especially with the new silent chainsaw bug!
---
That is terrifying 
---
Did you not see where I wrote killers camping the first downed survivor? 
---
Why is Michael taking so long to get T3?  He must be bad.  Incoming noed.  *Gets moried instead*
---
I think they turned it off today. Yesterday about 6% of lobbies were green ms for me, today it's more like 75%
---
dude they still havent fix the sound bug with Leatherface, but they were quick as shit to fix survivor laying down by the campfire.....like wtf! 
---
I have little faith in them, they are incredible slow to fix things these days.  I miss the old days when they use to release hotfixes on friday.  Then again, those hotfixes usually messed up stuff too...cant win either way with them :(
---
I am really looking forward to dedicated servers, my huntress game is gonna be on the next level. I miss so many survivor hatchets due to lag now, its makes me cry some games.
---
Game Over
---
Love u Jasper
---
would of been cool if, oh i dunno, announced they were doing this testing before they started it
---
Amanda: "Are you gonna behave?"
---
now, 
---
Well, let's hope the devs don't make a core mechanic of the game useless once again, right? That's all i ask for.
---
Indeed. But I'd love for them to be more accurate too...
---
I think a templar/knight is more likely than a hangman, definitely like the idea of a grappling type killer. But this community can barely handle an obese clown that throws gas bottles. Not saying it would immediately be turned into an *edgy* meme but it inevitably would be. Maybe an executioner instead of a hangman though? 
---
Yeah I really don't know how to feel about this chick throwing gang signs around..
---
You gotta realize that‚Äôd be way too much for the devs to handle lol
---
I had that once where I played against a streamer and 4K, so I went on her stream and watched it for a bit until the game kicked me out.
---
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear your question over the sound of a chainsaw that is being silently revved.
---
People would witch hunt claudettes then.
---
Time on a generator - 20 seconds
---
Time in a chase - 10 seconds
---
Time spent crouching around the edge of the map waiting for the hatch - 5:00 minutes
---
If you gain devotion in KYF that means your gaining shards for doing nothing, which is dumb. So no they‚Äôre never going to allow that. The higher you player level, the more shards you get, player level is based off rank play, if they gave it to you for goofing off then it would really mean nothing at all.
---
It would‚Äôve been easy, just change it to where the killer sucks and the other survivors don‚Äôt need saving, then you‚Äôd be suffering from success 
---
Well, you (as in "your side of this conflict") can play around face camping. Not so much around looping except you're nurse. And if you are nurse, prepare for 4 man dc.
---
Behaviour better be listening!
---
Have you thought about releasing these as separate files for custom pictures in game? I'm just generally curious because I'll look online for them but cant find many. Not saying you should but its definitely good where I would love to have them as my character portraits.
---
TFW I read desanitizes at first. Immediately had that guy that wanted to strangle Spongebob stuck in my head. And no, not Squidward. 
---
I disagree, I can't wait for the end game chat. Especially the 4k consists of toxic ochido wannabes 
---
*Laughs in lagswitch*
---
Some killers lack common decency.
---
Sadly, yes.
---
I personally like sitting in the basement and slaughtering whoever goes in and never leave unless someone somehow manages to get out
---
This
---
i mean team fortress classic is original team fortress so i'm just being a smartass based off that =p
---
Is that a statement or a question? 
---
It's kind of annoying that it doesn't actually buff the chainsaw and it's only 25% more points. I haven't had the guts to actually use it lol
---
Both a statement, question, and answer.
---
This is the first kinda decent shrine we‚Äôve had in a bit, excluding the one with ruin because that entire week was just full of no gen games.
---
Yeah you just learn not to start revving your chainsaw and thats it
---
Bee
---
I've been dealing with thisfor weeks.
---
It's only on dbd only on the left stick only at the top.
---
Usually goes away after I play around with it a bit. It's the most annoying thing ever... Gets you killed as survivor easy.
---
I'm one of the biggest fans of aftercare, but it's more of a fun perk rather than a perk you'd use if you want to win. The battle is between empathy and bond but personally I think bond is the best 
---
The content of this sub just gets better and better 
---
Yet downing several people at once is always fun
---
It's a beehive
---
ahh my apologies then i thought for sure you did and got a bit irritated. rip my fake internet points
---
&gt;as in one of the first taken
---
No, he would be the latest taken. In the lore, the Entity can pull anyone it wants to from any time. The Entity would be pulling someone from the past into its realm *now*. 
---
Cursed
---
Survivor is fun and easy. 
---
Playing killer is somehow less fun and more stressful than DotA 2 
---
I've learned to not get even slightly excited about new chapters until like 2 weeks after it is out. Then once the hype is over and people are learning how to play/play against the killer I make my decision whether it's worth buying. I am still waiting on my Freddy re-work Pepehands
---
Its almost like its not OP.
---
Will there ever be an end of game chat for ps4? 
---
When a survivor dies it shows their nam with "is gone" and it plays crab rave
---
Devs are too lazy to make something that different
---
I guess I always do this whole perk concept thing too often, but I just can't help myself.

---
Looking out for your few friends is a thing that comes natural, even if you have to break a few rules in the process.
---
* When you rescue or take a hit to protect an *injured* Survivor, they are healed **1** health state and have *all temporary debuffs removed*.
---
 * This effect can only be used once on each Survivor during a Trial.
---
* This perk has a cooldown of **120/90/60** seconds between uses.
---
*"Doc, about the future..." - Marty*

---
Every problem in your life seems to take on the same annoying shape.  But it feels like each new problem only gets easier to deal with.
---
* For each Survivor that is *Killed* or *Sacrificed* gain **0/1/2%** Movement Speed, perform *Break* actions **5/6/7%** faster, and Lunge **6/8/10%** faster.
---
*"I suppose it's poetic justice, two McFlys with the same gun." - Biff*
---
I love running Mad Grit for this reason. Plus, even if I don't see anyone, it's fun to spam swing your weapon as you head towards a hook lol
---
Not necessarily. For example, I never bought legion due to the feedback of the community that did purchase it. If they fixed/reworked his major issues, I would be more likely to purchase that chapter. Granted it will not be as much money as releasing a new chapter, but it will still earn the money. I'm sure I'm not the only person that has more than 1 chapter they didn't buy due to the community feedback of the killer.
---
If they did an "operation health" like R6: Siege did, it would help immensely.  However, people would bitch about the lack of new content because it would take a long time to fix everything.
---
Not to mention the fact that fixing bugs doesn't make money.
---
Can confirm
---
I'm sorry that this happened to you but the exit gates were powered. It sucks but it's justified. Dead by daylight is one of these games that when it's fun, it's absolutely amazing but sometimes you get really stressed out and frustrated(like overwatch if you played it). Taking a break might help you cool off a bit. Camping is really annoying but sometimes its necessary and when the exit gates are powered is such a time. 
---
All you're doing is defending someone ragequitting when they play in a way that you disapprove of. End of story. And like I said, if you acted like this in other games you would be mocked, called a bitch, and told to deal with it or leave. Guess what? In real life, people don't have to bend over backwards like the developers of this game to appease you. 
---
This is a website which shows you the best community-voted perks for each survivor, killer, and overall.
---
Here are the best voted perks for the Huntress..
---
https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/killers/huntress/
---
I personally would definitely use Huntress Lullaby, Bitter Murmur, and possibly Territorial Imperative and Unrelenting/Spies From The Shadows.
---
To do it consistently you'd probably need to be slugging the third guy. Other options would be BBQ and whispers. 
---
Whispers is particularly good for tracking down the last guy. 
---
I HIT MY DS THREE FUCKING TIMES, BUT THIS GODDAMN LEATHERFACE DROPPED ME EVERY FUCKING TIME. THEN HE FACE CAMPED ME ON THE GODDAMN MOTHER FUCKING HOOK. JUST SAY YOU'RE SCARED OF ME BRO, JUST SAY IT. 
---
&gt;There‚Äôs a difference between not having fun because you‚Äôre a poor player and you‚Äôre getting your ass handed to you, and not having fun because you‚Äôre getting forced to sit through a match where you‚Äôre practically an NPC because the opponent is playing with tutorial mode on and nothing interesting is gonna happen in the match. 
---
Dude, you're playing as a Survivor, doing gens and running around level geometry isn't fucking hard. Pull your head out of your ass. Jesus Hussein Christ you are pathetic. 
---
Hey. If looking only at the free to play perks without any DLC's, I would suggest looking into Nurses calling, which is a great and strong perk, also enduring and tinkerer can be quite strong perks if used correctly from hillbilly and also unnerving presence can work out, specially for lower level survivors. 
---
But personally I would suggest looking at some videos or tutorials on the DLC killers cause some of them are incredibly fun to play and also provide powerful perks, like your mentioned hex ruin (was in the shrine a week or two ago), some of spirit perks (I think shes really fun to play as and is a strong killer) and a few others, but that depends on your own gameplay and preferences. 
---
Funny story, I was playjng myers and I was at that one house in swamp with the gen and downstairs with the small pallet loop. I was looking for the last survivor a claudette. I swore I saw some movement from below the house so I checked there. I went all the way downstairs and was just about to finish by quick glance until she jumpscared me out of nowhere and threw the pallet on me. Gave me a heart attack but I did manage to get her.
---
Imagine getting this upset over getting teabagged in a videogame
---
HITBOXES!
---
HE'S AFRAID OF YOU AND SO AM I!
---
The singular time I used Object was when I was doing Laurie's adept achievement. You face any killer tunneling/hyper focus for using it? I know it irrationally angers some killers to see someone running it. 
---
You can, it just sucks having it done to you. All apart of the game though.
---
The basement chest supposedly has some damn good chili. Maybe that's why Leatherface wants people in his basement.
---
In my case is because I think it is unfair having infinite T3 or, if not, NOED when you have already normal T3 which is annoying as hell per se.
---
But I agree that sometimes you end up having funny moments when you are in swf hahaha
---
The bee is a meme.
---
The Ultra Rare that breaks a pallet and has map-wide terror radius is okay. Not amazing but okay. I really like Legion's add-ons because you can find weird combos and you're not forced to use the same old 2-3 add-ons like every other Killer. You could go with the Green and Yellow sketchbooks for actual map control and the likelihood of them juking you at a jungle gym or Killer Shack goes down significantly. Run the Green and Purple Knives to slow down the Mend process and make it so Mending takes like 20 seconds. Use Frank's Mixtape and something else, mostly Green Sketchbook though. Go with the Cold Dirt and the Green add-on that decreases the stun time when coming out of Frenzy so you get stunned for like a second tops. A lot of good shit to use. 
---
Oh it‚Äôs you again. Would‚Äôve expected you to comment something like this.
---
LF is a meme game.
---
Thank you so much. I will check them out. I do plan on getting the dlcs in the future. I will start leveling up the other killers for thr mentioned perks. Thanks again ^^
---
I would love that as someone who usually runs solo. And it makes sense to me. 
---
Maybe even a scale of some sort, 4 man SWF gets no bonus bloodpoints, 3 man SWF gets a bit extra, 2 man SWF gets some, solo gets a lot. 
---
Thank you so much. I couldnt find a decent site for builds since I started. Thank you again
---
Add sloppy butcher and thanatophobia to slow the game down just a lotta bit.
---
Ill be sure to try it when i get home to play. This helps a lot! Thank you so much
---
Glad I could help out a bit. Don't forget to just play what you want and have fun cause there will be a lot of people in the game telling you how to play or what you're doing wrong, but none of that matters cause you should be doing what you enjoy yourself. As the last thing, could recommend playing both sides and not just killer, so you can see how much the survivor can see and you can see what to expect too when playing as a killer.
---
 Best of luck on your games!
---
As someone who played killer at least once
---
Shit is stressful man, go play the other side
---
It's ScottJund not him  (probably)

---
Its like its locked? Its the first time ive seen that on reddit. What is it?
---
true thats why at 90% of rank 1-8 games are hillbilly or nurse. what a perfectly designed roster of killers
---
Tinkerer on Leatherface remains the most fun I've had in this game
---
HOW DID THAT HIT YOU?!
---
Yeah that is exactly it and it is the most toxic thing a killer can do
---
I am going to pop a J right now and play DBD. Playing high is just the tits.
---
No one ever expects noed on a Myers though and that‚Äôs what makes it strong. He can‚Äôt always be in tier 3 so it‚Äôs never truly wasted.
---
Red ranks doesn't mean you're good, but no one is convincing me that being killer in low ranks doesn't make your job easier. "Rank doesn't matter" is a quote that points at red ranks being easy to reach, that the highest rank isn't a sign of your skill. However, being in low ranks does say something about your skill if you play regularly.
---
Killers in low ranks get more kills than killers in high ranks, thats why I asked for the rank
---
Hag or Legion are better at farming points tbh
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
I WAITED 45 MINUTES FOR A GAME AND THE KILLER DC 1 MIN INTO THE GAME.
---
A LEGION WAS TRYING TO GIVE ME THE HATCH BUT IM SO BAD A READING THE "KILLER BODY LANGUAGE" HE ENDED UP MORI'ng ME OUT OF FRUSTRATION AND THEN SENT ME A PM LIKE "I TRIED TO GIVE YOU THE HATCH"
---
GOT FACE CAMPED BY A HAG WHO PUT 2848292 TRAPS IM FRONT OF ME LIKE...WHY. 
---
Welcome to the community, you've experienced it most of it. You got it all right, too. 
---
Now, that's a great idea.
---
Some entitled asshole. Don't worry about it. 
---
WHY DO GENERATORS ONLY GET DONE IF I'M THE ONE DOING THEM? TEAM MATES *PLEASE* DO SOMETHING!
---
WHY DO SURVIVORS USE EXPLOITS TO GET TO PLACES I CAN'T HIT THEM? ARE YOU REALLY THAT BAD THAT YOU CAN'T LOOP AND HAVE TO STICK TO STUPID TRICKS??
---
if you lose a survivor for even a few seconds they can self care and wake up if they get a skill check. he has no map pressure at all. the fact that you can see a survivor in the dream state means nothing when they only need a gen to wake them up even if all 4 are asleep. being able to see everyone =/= map pressure, especially because the scenario in which you put 4 people to sleep would only ever happen if all of them are grouped, and you can only chase 1 so the other 3 will just go wake up. he has no mobility to do anything about it when you see someone halfway across the map, they'll be awake and hidden by the time you get there, and he has no counter to loops. the best thing he has going for him is that you (sometimes) get a free hit when someone falls asleep... unless they jump through a window and fall asleep before you get through it so they get distance on you, or drop a pallet on you as they fall asleep. not to mention the fact that if you down someone, non-sleeping survivors can literally run up and start recovering a teammate before you can even pick them up and if there are 2 with healing perks or medkits they'll literally get the person up before you put them to sleep
---
I was playing as Myers and found s Meg in a gen, and she tried to UE around, but got stuck in a tree. I downed her and let her wiggle out and went for another gen, and the Meg showed sportsmanship by also going for another gen instead of the one she was finishing right there.
---
The game developed normally and I hooked her once but got saved, at the end all 4 escaped because I didn't apply enough map pressure, they waited to tbag and point at me at the exit gates and left, but the Meg didn't. She approach me when I was in T3 to hook her and get at least one kill, but I refused and forced her to escape.
---
We're not Canadian, btw.
---
My wallet is open
---
The nurse uniform is WW2 , huntress is the oldest killer killing off soldiers in WW1 
---
Thursdays and Tuesdays are the reveal days, so maybe tomorrow or next week. I hope is some kind of evil priest.
---
No it's not. The title also mentions breaking totems.
---
You can tell that the devs put everything they had on designing Spirit, and it came out beautifully. I hope we get a Killer as well designed as Spirit for this chapter to make up for the mess that is Legion.
---
Nice to hear that, I didn't really do to well because of the amount of loops I ate. So I did take the kill and thanked him afterwards.
---
Yeah, definitely some religious figure. Inb4 we get a werewolf.
---
This is handy!
---
The bee
---
This wasn‚Äôt a KYF it was a regular game
---
You should make more, these are good!
---
There is another clue, NotQueen posted "T..... M......", which can be The Mummy or The Moth.
---
It was a joke
---
Oh my bad lol
---
its just called "Red Ranks".
---
Just DbDC so you don't lose anything 
---
Holy shit, if she had the head without glasses she would actually be invisible 
---
well its a dick move but i dont understand why he is being salty
---
No light for a vampire to follow.
---
It's the logo for Avenged Sevenfold silly.
---
Oh THAT'S infuriating. 
---
Remember, according to this sub it's physically impossible for a killer to be salty or toxic.
---
me too! when I first started playing, I hated to go against him as a killer. but now, I use him as my killer main and I love him. bamboozling players who unhook and are getting unhooked is fun. 
---
‚ÄúOne, two, five...‚Äù
---
‚ÄúThree sir!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúThree!‚Äù
---
lol no worries, it was me and a couple of friends there. We just thought it was funny.
---
When you put an apostrophe in a word without a reason 
---
You think that's bad? Clown throwing a bottle removes tokens.
---
Ah okay, thank you for correcting me. 
---
It looked way too feminine for me to think it was Dwight so I thought is was a Gender Bended Dwight. But the artist said they were going to do Dwight so I don‚Äôt think that is Dwight.
---
Happened to me too as Michael! 
---
So, if you‚Äôre not looking to buy LF dlc and grind him out for bbq &amp; chili, I would work on getting spies from the shadows for her, as it can have similar effects. (Kind of) I would also work on gettin Hex: Ruin. It‚Äôs a hag teachable and she‚Äôs free to play, so try to grind her out for that teachable perk. I would do the same with nurse for nurses calling, and finally I would find whispers, as it can help you pinpoint locations of survivors, especially when it can be hard to find them when the huntress likes to sing and tip off survivors of her presence. Whispers helps counteract this. Other than that, just try to get ruin, and really, ruin is probably the only perk that  should be 100% on your build all the time. 
---
I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs my console. My other controller has the same issue.  sometimes the problem is more noticeable. Other times it doesn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs driving me crazy
---
Well one thing I noticed is the statue like thing in the bottom left and the cherubs on the arch
---
Survivor mains think that anything they don't find fun is toxic, but everything else is fine and Killers are just crybabies if they complain about something Survivors do. I play both and literally the only thing a Killer can do that bugs me in the slightest is when a Pig chases the only Survivor with a trap on. And that's solely because it's such an inefficient and dumb way to play one of my 3 favorite Killers.
---
Everything "toxic" a Killer can do has high potential to cost them the game and amounts to nothing. Survivors can be toxic AF and still escape because none of their actions require commitment and they've got 3 team mates who can cover their ass.
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs awful for killer too. Makes loops way to long. -.- 
---
Shup the up 
---
shut your up
---
I also mentioned, am I likely to get facecamped 10 games out of 10? If I get 1 game like that, fine. But am I likely to get caught all 10 rounds, 10 times in a row? There are still 3 other people?
---
You sound like "I must, 100% of the time, be allowed to be unhooked 2 times minimum per game" because you want to ***win*** the game by leaving the gate. Your team winning doesn't matter. It's ***you*** who must step out the gate.
---
Tunneling, yes, it's **stupid** for the killer not to tunnel you after you got off the hook. It's the best chance to get that second hook. But that's what Borrowed Time is for, that's also what the flashlight is for. That is what cooperation is for. 
---
It's also stupid to ***not*** go for the big red explosion sound on the screen when a survivor gets unhooked. Of course there will be at least 2 over there. The game even awards you points in being devious of faking walking away.
---
I'd rather it be the bee.
---
I'M SO TIRED OF KILLERS THAT CAMP. (MOSTLY MICHAEL) 
---
IS THERE NOTHING ELSE FOR YOU TO DO? ARE YOU LONELY? LAST TIME I CHECKED THERE WERE STILL THREE OTHER PEOPLE... I GUESS I'M SPECIAL? GETS JUKED, CAMPS ME THEN THREATENS TO GET ME BANNED WHEN I MESSAGED "CAMPINGS NOT COOL"... IS THERE REALLY NOTHING BETTER FOR YOU TO DO??? WAIT IN A LOBBY FOR 20 MINUTES JUST FOR THAT.. "HAVE FUN BOYS, HE'S A CAMPER" 
---
That would be awesome!!! 
---
We all know you wanna give another type of cell
---
Trapperdoor Spider.
---
You need:
---
* Insidious
---
* Franklin's
---
* Distressing
---
* Flex perk (Mad Grit, Iron Maiden, Beast of Prey)
---
Best addons are ones that increase the time it takes to get out of a trap, but I rarely run addons with this build. You locate the basement. Grab about 5 traps and place them near the basement. Sit in the basement and wait. If you knock an item off them, put a trap underneath. Scream at them in endgame chat if they trespass. 4k way too much.
---
Other Loadouts:
---
"I'll get you, bitch"- Rancor, STBFL, PWYF.
---
"Howdy, Motherfucker"- M&amp;A, Tinkerer, Nurse's Calling, Whispers (Best on Hillbilly).
---
"Ruse Cruise"- TotH and no other totem perks. Guard it with your life.
---
"Totemic Warrior"- TotH, Haunting Grounds, Ruin, Huntress's Lullaby.
---
"What the fuck even is happening"-M&amp;A, Distressing, Insidious, Tinkerer.
---
"Unga Bunga me no like loops" Spirit Fury, Bamboozle, Enduring.
---
It‚Äôs all so clear now the killer is Candle Ja‚Äî‚Äî
---
This would be sick
---
Maybe I dropped my weed between my sofa cushions huh nobody dodging you 
---
I workout with this dude every week.
---
Killer arms 10/10.
---
Yeah. Any mirror Myers benefits from NOED. Tombstone Piece, too, as you'll be out of stalk by endgame if it gets that far. But even just regular Myers benefits from the surprise of it. Like you said, nobody expects ~~the Spanish Inquisition~~ NOED Myers, especially not if you've been popping EW3 all match. It's a free, potentially endless, EW3, with real EW3 waiting to pop if it ends.
---
Eh if I get four kills that's good for me, I could be a bit upset if I can't use one time offerings like moris and such but don't bother me too much. 
---
Hodor.
---
Yeah, it's almost like it's completely counterable by good players. Funny that, yeah?
---
I hope new Killer brings some fresh Mechanics / Gameplay + High Skillcap so he is viable vs SWF.
---
My word.
---
Waaaaa
---
It ain‚Äôt *that* stressful.
---
No biggie, just had my best add-ons on it
---
I don't think it sounds op at all. In fact I think it'd be neat because it would make otherwise weak meme build basement perks actually viable on him. 
---
Honestly it's a toxic community, survivors are entitled, and dont like losing. I've gotten more messages trash talking in a week then 3 years of rainbow six seige 
---
I ignore any one using that Perk because they're probably not going to do Gen if I don't chase them
---
Is it that hard for you to just write "Nurse" and "Doctor"? You're not impressing anyone 
---
I think the whole Rancor/Dying light interaction is overhyped. If anyone is running a Dying light build, all they have to do is not down the survivor again, or slug him. I highly doubt you'll see a killer give up their DL that often.
---
Are you serious? Thats just dumb. 
---
PWYF is great Leatherface tho, id argue its one of his best perks. Ofc you could just play Hillbilly
---
a friend of mine does an amazing snake impression and I can't fucking wait to show him.
---
There's not a lot if head room in those lockers.
---
If you like Laurie then the whole chapter. If not, then no.
---
Hodor
---
Yeah, I have no idea why people are calling it a buff. It is so easy for killers to play around it isn't funny. I'm just happy Dstrike is gonna be a non-issue soon.
---
Nope. I have been playing for like 2 years now and I do not have a single survivor to level 50. I don't like playing survivor.
---
Exactly my point. What cost does a survivor have in being toxic to a killer? Spam that crouch button, flick the flashlight, spam 1 to point at killer. Can do it at least 3-4 times within a second where as a killer to be *toxic* they have to catch you and hook you which takes nearly a minute or even half the game if they choose to do something like facecamping.
---
You need to fully stalk 3 survivors tho...
---
As a leatherface main, I have to agree with you on both your points.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if this happens on pc but on PS4 8/10 games end with ‚ÄúI hope your family is raped and killed you dirty cancer patient‚Äù or something similar I‚Äôve turned off messages so I don‚Äôt have to deal with it but that‚Äôs just how the community is and probably always will be. If you can turn off messages on pc I would recommend it

---
Tbh i think the main reason why i think he's a fun killer to use is because he's easy! Like, he's super accecible to either newbies or veterans and i think that's what makes him great.
---
Plus once you reach P3-50 it's just fun, fun and more fun with the big guy.
---
legit, just makes the cookies more delicious
---
woah. This is worthless.
---
Because no one expects NOED on Mikey. Plus, it's a free indefinite EW3 that let's you hold on to your actual limited time EW3. The chaos of NOED into Blood Warden into EW3 when NOED breaks is hilarious. I've thrown games as Mikey just to do this for shits and giggles. 
---
The Legion bit caught me off-guard.
---
Moth is obviously the superior chicks to the bee it‚Äôs like Freddy and legion 
---
I find it hilarious that so many people get bent out of shape over it, after I started hovering around rank 10-15 or so, I rarely see NOED get used well. I stopped using it as killer because 9/10 times it gets rendered useless by the end of the game or it gets knocked out without 30 seconds of being activated. It's good for maybe one extra hook and if I don't camp them, it just gets cleansed and they get rescued anyway.
---
If a truly "trash" killer is using NOED they're either going to camp that first hooked survivor on their first stage, giving the others time to find and cleanse the hex, then save them. If not, the rest will just leave and they're stuck with a 1k. After that first downing, NOED only works if the survivors literally throw themselves at the killer's weapon. 
---
For more experienced killers NOED only works effectively either when survivors all swarm the killer after he gets that first down, or if they've already hooked survivors a few times anyway and NOED gives them one (extra) sacrifice when chasing someone to the gate. 
---
IMO people who claim NOED is OP just don't want totems to be a secondary objective, and/or believes repairing five gens = time to taunt the killer. If they're complaining "trash" killers are getting multiple kills because of NOED, it's almost always because they're taunting.
---
I'll never understand why anyone would want to end the round in 4 minutes with these add-ons which lead to moris which lead to rage quits. Like, there is so much about whining about "gen rushing" yet these meme add-ons like Tuft of Hair and Judith's Tombstone get a free pass?
---
Oh right yeah I agree with that unless the farmer is already injured in which case I'll just go for them
---
Definitely Hag, at least you have the jumpscare factor
---
No it is only auric cells sadly
---
That's why I love spirit, A1 mindgames
---
yeeaah... there's more than one.
---
BHVR has a huge history of doing licenced stuff. I seriously doubt it has anything to do with DbD. 
---
95% of the time. The other 5% it's more like [what just happened on Ardetha's stream.](https://clips.twitch.tv/SuccessfulDaintyPhoneHassaanChop) There's no middle ground.
---
What‚Äôs your issue? Gems are completed, gates are open, you‚Äôre fair game. You‚Äôre just salty because you were caught? Unless he‚Äôs running NOED there‚Äôs really no reason for him to leave the hook especially when the other survivors are obviously going to attempt to rescue you,
---

---
It's Claudette isn't it?
---

---
but trapper will Always be my daddy
---
I mean this is why you just leave the match instead of waiting at the door and needing to be babysat out like ass holes. 
---
PLAYING AS SOLO IS BULLSHIT.
---
I DO GENS, RESCUE OTHERS, CLEANSE TOTEMS I FIND AND I STILL DIE. 
---
OR I GET MATCHED WITH RANDOMS WHO ARE AFRAID OF RUIN. I DO 2 GENS IN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES AND THEY ARE STILL SEARCHING FOR THE TOTEM.
---
I think people think the devs are being more cryptic than theyll ever be. Spirits video was literally a girl being chopped up and people were coming up with crazy ideas. The killer was literally the chopped up girl.
---
&gt;Maybe it's only one generator that will change to a *red light* that will cleanse, just to make his power better over time as generators finish as opposed to worse.
---
Red light? Are we talking Jack the Ripper or prostitutes? 
---
I played a Meyers at coldwind. Lucky for us the Meyers didn't move until right before we popped the last gen. It was the strangest game of dbd. Near impossible for survivor lol
---
Monto vs Ochido

Basically monto vs ochido

Can you use shards to get it?
---
I feel like getting high would make me play so much worse. "Wait....... what generator was I working on?"
---
It's been awhile since I posted! This idea is super lose, but essentially I made a killer idea for funsies, that is losely based on Docs/Clowns mechanics, and a character based on punishing toxicity. 
---
Let me know your thoughts!
---
 If you‚Äôre curious what other weird stuff I make: [https://myurls.co/bunboiarts](https://myurls.co/bunboiarts?fbclid=IwAR0WZvHJBxgpQSsN6VEXqQIeT0nGC-4xtbXTANmd_KyqYSOB7pgztUsYK18)  
---
I see what you're saying, but the main problem is the broken chase mechanic. If you lose the killer for a few seconds, you are no longer in chase even if you're in heartbeat. No chase = no Lithe proc, and you could easily end up getting hit when otherwise you'd get away. 
---
I JUST GOT THE GAME IM SORRY IM NOT THE BEST KILLER IM TRYING I REALLY AM. 
---
Plus if you're using all three of those perks, that's three perks less you could use for anything else. Quick and quiet and dance with me both have cool downs and proc on fast vault, yet lithe doesn't
---
As I said, I wouldn‚Äôt either. It is, however, never a bad choice. 
---
I made a very similar idea, like a month ago. Not sure if we have the same mind or you saw my post and were inspired by it
---
Aka ‚Äújump scare Myers‚Äù. He has best value if played on maps like game or hospital since there are so many walls. 
---
I didn't see it but that's super cool! :D
---
Yet you are showing a severe lack of empathy and your being hypocritical as your whining on reddit about people doing something you don't like on a game yet assume they should do something they don't like to please you on the same game. Your right people don't have to bend over backwards in real life and using the same thought process people don't need to appease your every whim to keep you happy. 
---
I don't agree with rage quitting but I also understand why some people do it. In the case of Legion if your not someone who can dedicate hours a day to gaming and you play now and then why would you sit through a game you don't enjoy and a killer who is renowned as being unfun and boring to play against? 
---
On top of everything the fact your quite rude probably translates in game so if your BMing I am not surprised you face a lot of DC's. 
---
I‚Äôm a rank 10 but normally a rank 4 haven‚Äôt played killer much since reset, but I got a group that were 18,19 and 2 20‚Äôs. I thought it was some rank 10‚Äôs or lower because of the screwy MM system. They were all toxic AF, but Daddy Myers got his 4K and then I get to the end game stat screen and seen there ranks and was like wtf! Plus they only had 1-3 perks between them, all level 1 stuff  and then get a message asking why they had such a hard killer and that I was to OP! 
---
THERE IS NO FUCKING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SLOW VAULT AND MEDIUM VAULT APART FROM ANIMATION
---
I just recently watched Guardians of the Galaxy, and have changed my name to Groot. I just respond to anything, especially salt with ‚ÄúI am Groot‚Äù. 
---
That sounds like the pig with bear traps and only one jigsaw box
---
Bond&gt;empathy
---
Empathy=aftercare 
---
Auric Cells only, for those wondering. 1080 or 400 each part.
---
You also learn bad habits playing with bad players too though.
---
And that is part of the problem in games in general is that people want stuff to be easy for them so they can win without any real effort.
---
They want to be able to drop into a game and play it super casually with no real knowledge of how to play and still have a high chance to win.
---
And anyone who beats them using actual skill or who tries to offer criticism is called a 'tryhard'.
---
Mind you, i don't disagree overall that you should start with people of your own skill to get used to the game. I just disagree with the overall idea that you HAVE to and that learning via trial by fire is bad.
---
The only reason people don't put up with it is because there's nothing forcing them to. They know they can just bitch and whine until things are made easy for them.
---
And that's why you can go on numerous games and see people with hundreds of hours on a game who are still absolutely terrible at the game.
---
Even on DbD you'll see numerous Rank 1 Killers run mind boggling shit like Insidious and BBQ on HillBilly and face camp through all 3 phases.
---
Because they can. There's literaly nothing forcing them to get better. They don't have a desire to. And it's acceptable to simply call anyone better than them a 'tryhard'. As if the better player is the problem, not them.
---
So yea, is it easier to ease players in with people of their own skill level? Sure.
---
But i don't feel it's a 'necessity'. 
---
Freddy is my daddy smh
---
It's distasteful to be in a solo queue and the survivors your with does stuff like that.. I'm always worried that the randoms i play with will just utterly take a huge dump of salt on the killer if they didnt get the 4k. On the flip side I also see killers dishing out the "wow, trash team" ect which.. sucks. but it probably sucks more when you have 4 people taking the piss out on you instead of one :(

---
Omg that happened to me. I was just there to distract the killer cause I couldn‚Äôt do gens
---
funny thing is, i thought the same thing too and i hope you‚Äôre right
---
Yeah, they have cooldowns but they don't allow you to create distance (as exhaustion perks do), just to mind game the killer. Chase mechanic is not broken, the chase should end if you are not in sight for a few seconds, otherwise the killer would get Bloodlust 3 pretty quickly and eventually get to you.

yes!
---
Spoken like true camper 
---
Maybe you're a good legion and I just suck idk, but in my experience legion is crap unless you moonwalk or use Frank's mixtape. Because not doing these 2 things gives you 2 options:
---
A) chase survivors with 110 speed(basically huntress and hag without hatchets or traps) which if you're facing good survivors will be a nightmare
---
B) Frenzy hit survivors 4/5 times(not sure which is it) but that takes a super long time because you have to wait to charge your frenzy, hit survivors with it, they sprint away quick because you hit them and you get stunned/fatigued which will waste a lot of time and there's nothing the survivor can do to counter that which creates an unfun exp for both the killer and the survivor.
---
Again, maybe I just suck with the legion but this seems to be the case in my experience
---
I feel like that's something only low-rank killers do...
---
If dedicated servers come soon losing items hopefully won't happen anymore, but you can not do anything about people leaving a game they are free to do that, and some actually close the game on purpose so you lose your items.
---
Terror radius would be much better trigger than a chase which it's currently is
---
&gt;after the doors were powered
---
And? The bottom line is you got caught and chose you to die. I don‚Äôt know what you expect the killer to do. Why does he owe you to let you live? You‚Äôre not gonna stop doing generators to let him hook you.
---
Who you gonna use it on? üëÄ
---
I'm rank 7 and it's super annoying because I lost rank about 10 times in my first month playing
---
If it‚Äôs as scary as spirit i‚Äôm 120% for it!
---
Hey can you do the same meme but about Myers thanks
---
Trigglypuff lost some weight. Oh, that's hot.
---
I really hope so
---
Also imagine how hard it would be to take the killer seriously if they running around with a nameplate like"The Pooper booper"
---
No dude. I lost them all. Offering was a blood points bonus and I had a yellow toolbox with protective gloves and grip wrench
---
I KEEP GETTING GAMES WHERE KILLER DECIDES TO SLUG THEN RUN AROUND DOING NOTHING WHILE LETTING US BLEED OUT! HE CAN SEE US, I CRAWLED TO HIM! HE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO AND THREW BOTTLES AT THE SKY.
---
SEMI-RELATED: WHY IS IT ALWAYS THE ONE TIME I SEE A CLOWN IN LIKE 5 HOURS THEY PULL SHIT LIKE THIS WITHOUT FAIL. MAKES ME WANNA DC ON CLOWN SIGHTING.
---
Nope
---
Nice play, Love seeing NOED users getting stomped.
---
That‚Äôs a glitch then. It may not what usually happens when a killer DC‚Äôs. If that‚Äôs happening often, put in a service ticket with BHVR
---
Funny because people said the same thing about DS and killers still bitched.
---
Why did mention Clown? 
---
I'll check that out. Thanks
---
Who....is that?
---
But two wrongs don't make a right? I don't like instas or ds either. I've just had a lot of bad experiences with iri huntress' being clearly boosted and still being rewarded for the game's lazy hitboxes. If I don't DC, I just feed the killer. If I didn't get hit by the huntress' semi-truck sized hatchets from seven feet to my left or right, maybe iri head huntress would be more tolerable.
---
I PLAYED AGAINST A WARDING TRAPPER WITH THAT IRI ADDON TO MAKE HIS TRAPS DOWN SURVIVORS + A MORE TRAPS ADD ON. I GOT MAD TUNNELLED OFF HOOK UNTIL I WAS SECOND HOOKED IN AN AREA WITH 3 CHOKE POINTS LEADING TO IT. YOU BETTER BELIEVE HE HAS LITERALLY LIKE 5 OR SO TRAPS JUST AROUND ME BASICALLY MEANING I COULDNT BE SAVED OFF HOOK BC HED KNOW AND COME RIGHT BACK TO TUNNEL BACK ONTO HOOK.
---
FEELS BAD. IM TRYING TO BE A GOOD SPORT BUT GAMES WITH WARDS AND IRI ADD ONS *PLUS* HITBOX BULLSHIT JUST MAKE ME SALTY AND I HAVE TO LEAVE THE POST GAME SCREEN BEFORE I GET SALTY AT THE KILLER.
---
Sorry to have wasted approximately 10 seconds of your time
---
Looks like trapper wants to stuff Dwight‚Äôs crust. 
---
Devs should make it eaiser for them. I mean if you hit your ds you stay but hit anywhere but the skillcheck and it dcs you. 
---
They also need a perk for people so that if they get downed at anypoint of the game it dcs them. Just a nice quality of life perk. To much effort to pull your connection every game.
---
DEFINITELY WAIT, THE SHARDS WILL STILL BE THERE IN A FEW DAYS.
---
Saving Private David. Great post by the way.
---
Trapper: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna stuff his crust.‚Äù
---
It's really up to personal preference. Bond is an ever-present and constant perk, meaning you ain't gotta do anything for it to activate. Empathy exchanges power for versatility, as you can only see INJURED survivors, but anywhere on the map. Any room on Lery's, any floor on the Game. Aftercare is literally the best of both worlds. You have unlimited power and range, with the exception of having to do work to get it: you have to heal or get healed, or unhook someone. However, it has as much power as Kindred III when at full power. Yes, it can be wiped if you're hooked, but if you're proactive rather than reactive, Aftercare is the way to go. It's my personal favorite, but Bond is my personal choice of utility for cost.
---
Kindred is actually the best perk as a survivor if you fail at using all three of the ones above, as even when being useless, you can be useful.
---
FUCK YOU SURVIVORS THAT DON'T LEAVE WHEN THE GATES ARE OPEN, GUESS WHAT BITCHES I BROUGHT WHISPERS!! GET DOWNED WHILE HIDING IN THE GRASS AT YAMAOKA, CLAUDETTE. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU FOR 5 MINS AND THIS WAS THE LAST GAME I COULD PLAY BEFORE WORK. OHH NONONONO. DON'T SHAKE YOUR DOWNED BODY AT ME CLAUDETTE, TRYING TO ACT ALL CUTE LIKE A WOUNDED ANIMAL. YOU ARE FUCKING DEAD YOU FUCKING WRAITH WANNA BE.

I was just joking, but that glitch sucks so bad. I thought they fixed it like 2 patches ago? I've been lucky to not have it but have had teammates do it. If it's not one bug its another.
---
Doubt it, I say we'll probably get it on March 3rd or 5th.
---
Nothing at all
---
I mean I would suggest recording this happen with [plays.tv](https://play.tv) or shadowplay if you got ninvidia. It would allow you to figure out what was going wrong. It might also be lag, possibly the server didn't see the player go over the trap so it didn't happen?
---
Most likely when people see it they'll just leave ASAP
---
Totem placement stills needs a few tweaks.
---
Considering the game doesn't have dedicated servers there's no place for a site to automatically pull data from, it would have to be manually inputted from players or, a site making it so people agree to have some program running in the background recording matches to automatically input on the site.
---
Hell I don't think BHVR even keeps any match history.
---
First match of the day was versus a whole squad (likely SWF) of bike delivery Dwights. I was surprised how quick people bought the skins so soon after release.
---
That's why it's a **secret**.
---
i mean you can assume as many things as you want, but getting camped and tunneled off hook happens 8/10 games at high ranks because people at high ranks just care about getting a 4k. you can assume me being upset about camping means i think i need to escape every game i guess even though i never once said that. playing the game and enjoying it doesnt mean you need to escape every game. i mean have fun defending tunneling and camping to the death i guess if thats the hill you wanna die on
---
Some killers dont accept pity kills. If I got destroyed in a game I will even bring the last person I downed to the gate. Letting them go helps stop the flow of harrassment from them post game. If you played poorly and get one person the salt is worse than 4king or all escaping without the carry out. 
---
Those last 2 perks should honestly just be part of the game. Especially the exit one. I'm sick or survivors just jacking off in the exit for 3 minutes waiting until you get over there so they can show you how good they did with ceremonial butt dances.
---
I'm a killer main, and I have never disconnected unless I had something important to do.
---
Maybe they had small game? Or sae you placing the traps?
---
RicardoFlick
---
Exactly, there's being stealthy and avoiding the killer, but then there's purposely not doing any gens and just hiding out from locker to locker
---
I don't understand
---
I would gladly throw my money at the screen to get that as an actual spirit skin
---
I guess Caustic quit apex after being bullied so hard
---
Thanks for at least being real and having something to do
---
I agree with you, I‚Äôm just saying the change does indirectly affect those perks
---
There's more to it
---
woah! he stole that guys pizza!
---
Great idea, but devs can't even fix the bugs in KYF (window vaults, DS only works on host, Dead Hard is bugged etc)
---
I agree with the ideas though, why can't more survivors spawn with 1 killer if that game mode doesn't matter.
---
You are sick... I like your style.
---
I hate when this happens, but when I came up with the idea for this meme, I couldn't resist. 
---
Can we stop reposting the same 4 memes, thanks
---
You're welcome. And by "important things" it is mainly my mom calling me to her room to talk, or supper is being served.
---
I really love the effort put into this, they're almost all really well designed. Great job!
---
Yea now that's life and is important 
---
Because dry blood is red right?
---
My favorite exhaustion perk ia dead hard.
---
the perfect thing to wear in the dark when there is a psychotic killer trying to stab you. A glow in the dark reflective vest xD
---
Lol
---
Completely depressing, imo. The only map that seems to do totems right *consistently* is Ormans, but I could just not know it as well as the others.
---
It would\`ve been so much better if you could see both of his eyes through the face mask, and there wouldn't be an obvious greenscreen. I recommend you reposting this with these edits, and then I\`m pretty sure it\`s going to be a bomb
---
Why do you like it? 
---
Skemoo you never fail to make me happy.
---
Good old Ricardo.
---
Three DCs against a Level &lt;10 Hag with no add-ons. Oof.
---
If it wasn't chase-only, it would only have the one disadvantage
---
stake out seems good free great skill checks
---
Played 3 killer games yesterday, 3 people in 2, 2 people in 1...
---
Yeap it really takes commitment to do it that way
---
I like Claudette, her story, character, design, perks. She gets so much hate though.
---
Disappointed yet? 
---
The edge part of my phone curves cuz I dunno, phone design from galaxy, so it was so hard to read lol
---
Cool design tho, sounds fun
---
amazingly and coincidentally Valve is under Auric Cells. also btw white is right next to Vein
---
Because they're ultra rare add ons you cant use every single game and theres still tactic and planning needed to make that work. You dont need anything to repair a gen.
---
Christ is this 148p?  
---
Was that teabag an acknowledgement of the lag or are you just being toxic
---
WHY IS THERE NO TEAM STAT SCREEN AFTER THE MATCH SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHO WAS THE LAZY ONE CROUCHING AROUND? PROBABLY IT WAS THAT CLAUDETTE!
---
Nearly. Survivors can run from pallet to pallet, stun, tbag, flashlight, stun, tbag, flashlight, use BL to infinite loop, hide while both exit doors are open, then say "gg ez" in chat as if it was the killer's fault they played like assholes. Killers can... body block and say "gg ez" in chat without knowing whether or not anyone is still around to hear it.
---
Please understand I'm not actually holding games hostage, this is just a meme. 
---
Except this clip required skill and coordination. Obviously this killer doesn't need NOED.
---
TONIGHT WE WILL EAT AT DIGIORNOS
---
Id you don‚Äôt think facecamping is toxic then I don‚Äôt know what the hell are you thinking
---
the one true god
---
Damn hitboxes.
---
Just cause I'm high doesn't mean Leatherface can't end a chase quicker than the legion. He even deals with the survivors being grouped better than the legion. Legion doesn't do anything better than any killer other than tunnel one survivor at a time. 
---
LEGION, LEGION, EBONY, NURSE, NURSE, NOED, CAMPING BILLY. 
---
But we wre in a chase and they didnt stop for a second
---
I think those guys are little bitches.
---
I'm a Leatherface main. He punishes sub-brick I.Q. survivors and is only okay versus the rest.
---
I'm going to play devil's advocate here and say there is usually a reason, you probably don't see it because don't know the killer's point of view. When I play Leatherface I always try to be a gentleman about it, but sometimes I get that special survivor that runs ds, and teabags and flashlights me at every pallet and they are obviously crying out for attention so I give it to them. Then in post match the others ask why I was a salty camping killer and I tell them and sometimes they understand and we both agree that it sucks and move on.
---
I agree with you, sometimes the killer is right next to but the game doesn't notice a chase so the killer hits me as I'm trying to vault.
---
So because you had a bad match you can trash talk? Alrighty then...
---
good!  Saw them nerds down!
---
He's a good killer to me! :,(
---
Exoctly!
---
Earns additional BP? :D

---
This was me last night: [https://clips.twitch.tv/CallousAmazingKoalaBuddhaBar](https://clips.twitch.tv/CallousAmazingKoalaBuddhaBar)
---
Imagine feeling the need to do it in the first place. In other games it seems different. I feel like trolls do it for fun in other games. In dbd it feels different like they are trying to say they are better than you. Atleast thats how it feels. I guess playing with so many toxic people has shell shocked me
---
I thought ochido was banned on pc and ps4 though
---
I knew I was missing something.  I read it as Giordano's (Chicago restaurant). 
---
He was but  I would not be surprised if he found a way around it but did not broadcast it. 
---
I have all the killers, LF isn't really in my rotation because of the constant sound of the chainsaw.
---
The only reason to hang around in the exit gates is to be on standby to try rescuing someone else. If everyone is at the gates, just leave.

You can't still hit him?

---
LIKE
---
HOW DID THEY KNOW I WAS BLACK. ALSO RUDE
---
Just think, in the time you took to spam the reddit with yet another picture of this exact same thing you could have instead googled how to get up there and killed him 
---
Soon‚Ñ¢
---
I do feel like there are better, cheaper pizzas. Red Baron for sure, Tony‚Äôs is pretty good too. For a little more money, though, you can‚Äôt beat Freschetta. 
---
I had someone do that to me on an autohaven wreckers map. Managed to hit them after which they tried to run, they failed and got hooked. Gave me a really good laugh
---
First, if you don't think that running from pallet to pallet, not to get away, but to piss off the killer, is toxic, or holding the game hostage is toxic, then you really don't have any business saying what toxic behavior is.
---
And Haddonfield houses are infinite loops with BL.
---
Sexy 
---
in light of u/lumenhunter who made a post about this girl under the false impression that she was a new survivor, i realized i think she would be cool to actually have in the game. I know she's the alpha meg, but in my mind she's always had the name Jane. petition for Jane to be added to the game!!! she has a cool design imo!!
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre just really bad at killer tbh 
---
Just ignore him, this guy is either a troll or the first killer main to be incapable of hitting rank 15
---
Happens to me at rank 6, not that anyone cares
---
Just run at her
---
10/10 meme, would meme again.
---
Leatherface can easily just rev up when he sees them go towards a pallet. It takes him less than half the time to get through. You don't want to try and pallet loop a LF thats how I get a lot of people. 
---
tragic. and thank u. doubt they'll bother though I'm salty
---
Looks great, awesome job! I love the possession look, Feng is a good choice for this as well.
---
Fuck, I was just about to say Shrek
---
If you aren‚Äôt enjoying yourself or having fun *more* than you are frustrated/depressed with the game, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs healthy to take a break.
---
I‚Äôve had so many death threats/suicidal encouragement/harassment in this games post chat and DMs that I had to take a break for the sake of my own Mental Health.
---
The game is super fun.
---
The community is *beyond toxic*.
---
If you aren‚Äôt feeling up for it, don‚Äôt play, trust me. 
---
But you lose
---
If he used a controller to type that entire paragraph of counter arguments then hot damn.  This man deserves some credit for his dedication.
---
The devs are 100% aware of it it‚Äôs been in the game for at least a year 
---
Lithes disadvantage is literally the exact same as Balanced Landing; can only be used with a vault. It just has the additional disadvantage of requiring a chase, a mechanic that is unreliable in the games current state. 
---
It would be a nice QoL change for Lithe. And using 3 perk slots to evade a killer every 40-ish seconds isnt exactly broken.
---
Ane everyone's reply is "We can tell."

Clown is amazing if the survivors are stupid and try to loop you. Otherwise they will just camp the pallet, force you to break it then move on to another one, making your power useless.
---
The green screen adds humor if you ask me
---
I wish shards could be exchanges for cells, all the good skins that come out need real money :(
---
They're supposed to get away. If you're not being toxic and can't get away through 8 pallets, you suck as much as the killer does.

Interesting how campers get so triggered when you point out they're camping. Because you know... it's a legitimate strategy and totally not an exploit. (bring on the downvotes baby killers)
---
Just end the game and escape. Stop being toxic in the game. He could be toxic by face camping you but he didn‚Äôt so why be toxic?
---
You're welcome, friend.

Does this make anyone else think of ancient Rome? With the cherubs and lions in the archway,  the gold, the vague religious symbols, etc. 
---
The Hag: "You had better brought extra sausage, big boy."
---
Good point. This is possible brought to you by the fact at the beginning, it was possible that the first ever Killer, for whatever reason, got sent into The Void as a result. Same thing might‚Äôve happened to Vigo as we aren‚Äôt getting any updates about his current status unlike Benedict Baker, who is still documenting sights of Killers and Survivors of new and old to this day. 
---
chill out ... maybe i should change flair because i wasn't salty ahahahaha, i only wanted to share a beautiful bubba build a camp :D and yes, i wasn't complaining at all in the game, i take his attention for 3 gens and the last one popped out right when i was hooked so yeah, i was prepare for dying but i manage to escape and take that damn trophy of the 4-man hatch :D
---
If only they did that when we actually need them to.  
---
Lmfao

&gt;... most survivors at every rank are terrible and get downed in 10 seconds.

The future of advertising. Get teenagers to think ur a xD funny meme and advertise for you.
---
I'm fairly new to the game and it seems like this has been happening a lot. Am I shitty for turning around and giving them a good whack for it? I dont camp hooks at all but I'm not just gonna ignore it from two feet away.
---
Lol I guess you're right xD
---
Seems kinda pointless not gonna lie. 
---
Could be a Claudette outfit. 
---
Dwight is not exactly the avatar of masculinity. 
---
can't believe its only few days for this meme to be actually DbD related
---
&gt; head cannon
---
I'M HAG, I'M GOING TO STAY AROUND A HOOK FOR A BIT TO SET UP SOME TRAPS, TWO TRAPS PLACED I TURN AROUND AND YOU'RE TRYING TO UNHOOK THEM? AND IT'S NOT TUNNELLING WHEN YOU TRIGGER MY TRAPS AND I HIT YOU. NOT MY FAULT YOU RAN INTO MY TRAPS ON EVERY UNHOOK!
---
AND LEARN TO LET PEOPLE DIE, GATES ARE OPEN AND THERE IS ONE PERSON ON THE HOOK, AND ONE PERSON HIDING SOMEWHERE. IT'S OBVIOUS WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. I WON'T CAMP WHEN THERE IS A REASON NOT TO, BUT IF YOU GO DOWN BY A GEN WHICH IS 99% COMPLETE, I'M NOT GOING TO RUN AWAY JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE HOOKED NEARBY! I WOULD STAY NEAR THE GEN EVEN IF YOU WEREN'T BECAUSE THAT IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY GEN ON THE MAP!
---
Save the best for last, rancor, and remember me (in certain situations) are pretty decent. I wouldn't run remember me or rancor outside of certain builds, but save the best for last is one of my favorite perks (not saying it's the strongest killer perk)
---
It really isnt that stressful. The only time I feel pressure is when going for Adept challenges. Otherwise Im just cruising by.
---
Haha Haha get it guys its DiGiorno disappointed that its delivery and not their pizza! Isnt it funny?  Please buy our pizzas we are desperate and need the publicity. ü§£
---
Thats totally fine! You can go to my steam profile and download the large pic&lt;3
---
I get 4k's almost every single time i play. And i agree with this message except if tunneling and facecamping should be fixed. Then pallet camping should be fixed as well
---
I play everyday. Never wait more than 2 or 3 mins. If you are in the main menu and are trying to join a lobby never let the que go for more than 2 minutes without cancelling and trying again. I promise you will find matches quicker. Friday has a lot of players. For me dbd can make me wait longer. Swf makes me wait like 10 minutes if i que as killer its instant most times. I think that boils down to not enough killers. 
---
Agreed 
---
No of course not they should be waiting until you get a certain distance away or are distracted by another survivor 
---
The haddonfield basement house is an infinite loop with BL because the killer is forced to vault to get to the survivor. But you can mindgame it pretty easily honestly.
---
[PLEASE FIX YOUR BROKEN ASS GAME](/intensifies)
---
Sincerely, BlueGalaxy
---
Why is this?
---
When you're so bad you get 3 kills
---
WHEN GATES ARE OPEN AND ONE PERSON IS ON THE HOOK, 90% OF THE TIME YOU SHOULD JUST RUN. KILLER KNOWS YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO LEAVE OR YOU'RE GOING TO RESCUE FROM THE HOOK.
---
WHY WOULD A KILLER RISK TO LOSE BOTH KILLS OVER 1 KILL CONFIRM + A SURV WHO IS GOING TO BE CAMPING NEARBY AS WELL?
---
YOU MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE!
---
Random aside, what are Nurse's best add ons? I once heard pocket watch was good but open to others 
---
As with 90% of the good skins..."able to get everything in the store with shards" my ass. 
---
If u mean separate files, yes they are separate. Just for reddit i combined them. Separate pics are at my steam profile, but I can do a combination of files later today XD

She did have an original name but it‚Äôs on the tip of my tongue and I can‚Äôt remember it, so Jane it is! Justice for Jane!!!

Good job on blacking out those names :P
---
Well now I'm going to get some Digiornos for dinner.
---
I don't think it's unplayable on console and pc, but okay 
---
More like: The ***B U L G E***
---
It‚Äôs not delivery, it‚Äôs failing to load 9 times out of 10
---
Congratulations, you took the time to write out a comment complaining about something that made people laugh and feel happy. Is your day better? Do you feel happy?
---
Yet come to a public forum and cry about it.  Is this just over your head or way over it. 
---
Oooooooh!!! Thats awesome! Thx for ur guide! I would try to do that!
---
&gt;They're supposed to get away. If you're not being toxic and can't get away through 8 pallets, you suck as much as the killer does.
---
‚ÄúJUST BREAK CHASE AND HIDE 4HEAD‚Äù. Except thats proven to not be the most optimal way to play. If a killer is going to hyper focus on you, its better for that to happen than for him to lose you and start patrolling gens or finding the immersed claudette who cant run the killer like you can. 
---
You cant unironically think you can ‚Äújust get away‚Äù from the killer, seriously?
---
Just gen tap. 
---
Thank you for the feedback. I like playing hag and never get to use devour hope because of this.
---
I play casually so oh well 
---
It's not funny that's the problem. It's literally every company now trying to copy Wendy's and be relevant and its just cringy. Literally had nothing to do with DiGiornos. "iTs nOt dElIvErY iTs dIgIoRnO"
---
It's a drawing. It doesn't move. Not moving wraiths are 100% completly invisible. :)
---
Digiorno has agreed to digiorno dwight! When is it gonna happen BHVR?
---
implying Freddy gets invited to anything
---
unless they used the PS app or the tiny plugin keyboard. Worthwhile investments if you're gonna do this often.
---
Agree as well. It‚Äôs typically a full escape too 
---
or jason
---
That was one. 
---
or have better reflexes than a turtle and simply Hit the great checks

Literal embodiment of the [autistic screeching](http://2static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Eu+be+like_fbe2e2_6097856.jpg) meme.

SHUT UP GIORNO
---
Is was a joke.
---
I wish all the OG Survivors had sets for the current original 4 that made them look like this.
---
My freddy is still locked.

---
It's free marketing, they're also causing uproars intentionally for the free advertising.  It's disgusting.
---
Well they are not now, try again. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
If it was better on console, then yeah. 
---
so was mine, turtles have great reflexes
---
Most maps are pretty big, you're basically telling someone to find a needle in a haystack. You got 3 kills, and can't find someone who is actively not trying to do objectives. One of the only reasons killers find survivors in the first place is because survivors have an objective they need to come out and do, not being able to hide all match.
---
As a survivor main who has only had the game for about a month, I personally couldn't tell you. The wiki might be a good place to check however
---
I‚Äôm so upset, survivors run all of the same fucking perks like losers because they SUCK. Off to play Leatherface and Wraith and Billy and Myers and Pig and Trapper and Doctor - rate my build for them its BBQ/Enduring/Spirit Fury/Ruin.
---
Chase time efficiency, it‚Äôs not worth even if playing legion.
---
imagine being this upset over a tweet 
---
need a smol billy.
---
 When you go to Controls you‚Äôll be able to see what buttons you have for each action in the game. On dropping items for example it‚Äôll say circle. Change the one that is for vaulting windows and dropping pallets.
---
Oof
---
Not upset its just sad that every company tries to copy the one that actually does it right and makes a fool of themselves
---
Corporations have now reached a level where they can advertise and people wouldn't even realize it.
---
BUSY WORK
---
I will look for you. I will find you. And I will sandbag you. - Said from other dead survivors.
---
FIX LEGION ALREADY GOD DAMN IT, I REALLY LIKE THE CONCEPT OF THE KILLER I WANT TO PLAY THEM WITHOUT FEELING LIKE A PIECE OF SHIT.
---
Bad totem spot post #748494848203038922048&amp;4
---
Agreed, survivors need to stop being afraid of ruin and just work through it. Worst case scenario it slows you down because you keep hitting good and not great skill checks. But it doesn't stop you from making progress on a gen. 
---
That's meg .... they re did her for the actual game tho same for claudette 
---
relateable. 
---
Frame rate can make hitting skill checks hard sometimes
---
Detectives hunch is the perfect counter for it anyways. I hate seeing everyone run scared when there is a Ruin 
---
Ok, valid explanation (allthough most of pc players dont play on the optimal frame rate either).
---
Don‚Äôt mind me just a Doctor/Freddy/Legion/any killer with a smaller terror radius with some combination of BBQ, Nurse‚Äôs Calling, Bitter Murmur, Rancor, Spurs from the Shadows, Predator, Stridor, Shadowborn, Surveilance, Discordance, Iron Maiden, Territorial Imperative, Whispers, Bloodhound, Sloppy Butcher, or any of the 50 addons that reveal survivor‚Äôs auras. Oh yeah you‚Äôre toxic if you don‚Äôt lose me in a chase btw
---
Wow if you don't invite the Pig to your party is it really a party?
---
It does. I do SWF a lot but when I play killer its instant. 
---
No they both bought him, you paid. They don't want to admit that they shelled out money for him. Both are completely embarrassed and feel scammed. At least they both didn't buy legion... I hope...
---
You mean the studio doesn't consist of one team that does everything at once?
---
Sorry my weird fingers and slow brain aren‚Äôt good enough for u, but I can‚Äôt hit consistent great checks so I‚Äôll find myself a totem
---
What are you talking about? Do you not see this masterpiece?
---
Need a Jake park skin like this 
---
Its the subreddit for finding friends, and no its not locked
---
*stun noise*
---
They are really missing out by not having some sort of lore published. Whether it be a book or comic novel.
---
Except when the game literally skips the frames where the great skillcheck is possible.  Because optimization PASS is still PASSing us by.
---
It‚Äôs a joke. 
---
Oh uuuh ok
---
The solar cross is what brought me to it. I think I just saw a pic of the tree and the bottom looked similar to the teaser picture how the lines connect to the sphere on the bottom. I wish I had photoshopping skills to put the picture over it. And finding the Angelarium came randomly from researching that. When I saw the Tiferit art work I was just blown away. This could all be coincidence  and in my head Haha. 
---
uhm.  Am I the only one who is confused AF by her voice?
---
Yes... that‚Äôs kinda the point. Doing gens isn‚Äôt hard, it‚Äôs boring though. Most of the fun in this game comes from the chase and outplaying your opponent, and legion strips all of that from the game.
---
I never said legion was OP or that he‚Äôs a super strong killer, in fact I said the exact opposite of that, he‚Äôs rather weak and addon dependent, and combined with the fact that most people who play him are 10 IQ individuals he has a rather high escape rate when you factor out matches with DC‚Äôs. 
---
The match being hard isn‚Äôt the issue, it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm supposed to be playing a game where I‚Äôm competing against my opponent for the win, and yet there‚Äôs nothing I can do to best a legion. You just run and he hits you. Then he hits you again. Assuming he doesn‚Äôt moonwalk, you maybe run him like normal, but then his power recharges and he hits you again. Then you run a little bit longer, his power comes back and you go down. 
---
There‚Äôs no fun in that. I‚Äôm not even playing the game at that point.
---
READY UP!! READY THE FUCK UP ALREADY!!!!!
---
I love Piggy. She's my favorite killer to play, and I found myself gravitating to her almost immediately.
---
True but as a ps4 player I can attest to sometimes  some maps and some killers male the game tank frame rate wise. Hard to hit that great when that needle goes o'clock o'clock then hangs up for a second and ohh missed it because needle had to be hit at 7 o'clock but the needle is now at 11 o'clock.
---
Doesn't always happen and sometimes its ping not frames which I get ping can't really be helped until dedicated servers. But console despertly needed optimization they promised and then backed out on.
---
The frame rate hurts other areas too... smack survivor frames tank then catch up survivor just went poof.
---
Oinks
---
Hey guys. I want to play a game
---
Two words:
---
Small
---
Game
---
Sweet joke bro
---
Official One
---
I'm pretty sure it's the official dbd one
---
For the uninformed, what did Wendy‚Äôs do exactly?
---
really? cause i barely see leatherface used, mostly i see myers or billy
---
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHANGED BUT CONNECTION IS SOOOOO BAD RECENTLY
---
YOU GET MAYBE ONE OR TWO GAMES BEFORE YOU'RE STUCK IN AN INFINITE LOADING SCREEN AND HAVE TO FORCE CLOSE
---
GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER BHVR
---
I used to spend ages looking for the totem but now it‚Äôs like nah let‚Äôs power up these shits
---
Im pc so cant relate all that well, only one thing hits noticeably and it is the legion map. I have usually around 40 fps (yea bad computer), but when i get that map it ALWAYS tanks down to 15-20, literally eyerape.
---
Yeah as someone can‚Äôt even hit ‚Äúgood‚Äù skill checks 50% of the time.. i disagree. But that‚Äôs a personal thing, bc i need to git gud or whatever lmao
---
When you're too ready to be toxic and you burn out your literal batteries before the game even starts :^)
---
Awe :( this was always funny too see a nurse shaking there head while clenching there fist but was unfair I guess
---
would be a nice touch, would be nice if he had a chant while in chase aswell
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAib5ysm-QI

üëè Why üëè do üëè people üëè still üëè do üëè this üëè crap? üëè

Yes! replace the heartbeat with the chant!

I know it's Meg!! I said that in my original comment but they should re use the design

Another good thing to do if you want to play without dealing with people‚Äôs complaints is close the chat box. Especially helpful if you are playing as a killer.

Oh awesome. Lol I'm just always looking for character portraits. Wasnt sure if you upload them. I like to change them every so often
---
I just played in a game with one. He got focused first by the LF and taken to the basement. It wasn‚Äôt a happy ending. 
---
You read pretty upset here buddy. 
---
My only problem is when chin dribblers think multiple people working on one gen while it's up is a good idea.
---
https://youtu.be/EqWRaAF6_WY
---
Like 5 times total
---
we need more than 3 black characters and only 1 is a chick so they should make her a new survibor imo
---
Please use the [Megathread.](https://redd.it/aqchce)
---
EXACTLY 
---
Gotta love this scene.
---
Here, have an upvote. 
---
Amanda has the best voice actor in this game you can't change my mind
---
I love both WN2 and DBD and Dead By Daylight is actually really fun!!
---
I mean, if you run DiGiorno‚Äôs Twitter feed you don‚Äôt have much else to do than search for trending topics with the word ‚Äúpizza‚Äù in it. 
---
It is also very active for the most part
---
What do you mean? Him and leatherface clearly went down there, and ate all the pizza so nobody else could have any! Well, I guess that means it's not a happy ending for the rest of you
---
Yeah, seems about accurate. 
---
Wow, Claudette accusing other survivors of being immersed?  Talk about pot calling the kettle... uh...
---
Probably from the app on his phone 
---
Nah. it‚Äôs hard to hit great skill checks when the meter decides to play hop-scotch while rotating the circle. But maybe if I ditch the Xbox original for a One X I will see a difference? 
---
I've had it suggested to me this killer could be Egyptian themed- maybe a mummy? I'd be hyped if so. I adore Ancient Egypt and a mummy killer would be so cool.
---
Btw, this motherfucker brought ds and made sure there was not a hook that i can dribble near
---
Ok? no one cares
---
Ah, didnt see the comment. Sorry üòÖ
---
My guess is "lucky lag spike saved me so I'm a god at this game" teabag... so toxic yes.
---
"My pizzas here"
---
lmao I just noticed
---
Yes, dedicated servers are coming too. 
---
Yeah did that, still not seeing her lol
---
The tenacity clutch
---
Yea, fix the fuck game.
---
THEIR DEAD GAME GETS THE TERMINATOR, BUT WE CAN'T GET GODDAMN ROBERT ENGLUND FREDDY. 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Aw, that was actually really wholesome to read. 
---
Pizza leftovers are the best! I‚Äôll go down next time, for sure. 
---
what I want to know is why did whoever watermark it with Joe Gattos name lol
---
We really don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs more races than just black. 
---
Every match i play as a survivor i am the only individualthat does gens
---
Except a killer with a functioning brain won‚Äôt lose you
---
Poor no0b &lt;3
---
It's not hard, but it's not very fun either. If damn near every other killer didn't run it, I wouldn't have as much of an issue with it (although I probably wouldn't be good as hitting the skillcheck). It's one of those things where I go, "But Ruin? Really? A killer of your talents?" rather than babyraging that it's hard to hit. 
---
Dead Weight ability sounds sick, and I‚Äôm a survivor main. But would be pretty terrifying 
---
And? That doesn‚Äôt change the fact you‚Äôre gonna go down and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it
---
IT IT JUST ME, OR ROES IT REALLY PISS ANYONE OFF WHEN THE KILLER DODGES THE LOBBY THE SECOND THEY JOIN? 
---
Ooh ty
---
I don't know if I would say it's entirely balanced, but I like that it genuinely incentivizes cleansing totems though.
---
It could be argued that dribbling was the counter to the current ds, but it's such a janky, luck-based counter due to the fact you need a hook nearby.
---
NOED at least has the concrete counter of - cleanse all the totems you see in the match.
---
Bbq is the better option imo idk if the 500k will get you close though
---
‚ÄúAaaaand he‚Äôs getting into a locker to deliver it?‚Äù
---
Yes. Sooo worth it.
---
I‚Äôve only played as killer for a few hundred hours and only had this happen to me once. It was when I first started to play the game. 
---
I didn‚Äôt cry about it, I found them. I‚Äôve played as survivor for almost 1500 hours ... So I know that mindset better then most killers. This game is cat and mouse and at times can be like chess. He was just being outplayed.   
---
The survivor was going to die anyway and at that point can farm and do whatever until the killer finds him. Again, not holding it hostage. Find them. 
---
If it‚Äôs that much of an issue there are perks that can help.
---
They need a hispanic/latino hero imo
---
It's a macabre joke
---
For when you're hungry but you're getting camped on the hook. 
---
*Killer has left the game*
---
lmao
---
Looks like a fresh new Copypasta. 
---
New killer
---
Surprisingly not üòÇüòÇ
---
Look man, I understand constructive criticism, but you don‚Äôt need to just talk shit on people‚Äôs artwork. Not cool.
---
His ability to break the hatch seems super OP
---
Gas is a more balanced take on doctors insanity depending on balancing e.g. vomit takes 1.5 sec, has a vomit bar to show its going to happen,  but slows/immobilizes you not stuns, you can still say throw a firecracker or torch the killer 
---
Ability to grab wouldn't really matter as people playing vs him would know he can do this, but it may be good on other killers
---
That‚Äôs really good especially for your first time
---
I consider 2k good enough, points dont mean anything if you dont safety pip. There's no leaderboards so again points dont matter other than giving you bp and if you get 0 kills then you aren't getting many points. Just because you scrape by with 100-1k more doesnt mean you won in reality it means you're pretty bad at killer and need more practice (perfectly okay) but dont try to tell people getting 0 kills and having 100 more points is a win 
---
Yeah but it doesnt down you. That's my point,  they seem kind of weirdly designed but not in a "this is brokenly **strong** kind of way. 
---
I mean this is why killers want pretty much every other killer and all new killers introduced to be at least at Billy‚Äôs level.
---
Legion is one of the best killers in the game, no discussion. Why do you think people DC as soon as they know the killer is legion? His ability is annoyingly effective and there's nothing a survivor can do to counter legion
---
in my game basically 15 minutes ago too!!! wtf??
---
BUT DISCORDANCE SEEMS LIKE A LEGIT GOOD PERK, ESPECIALLY FOR MY SWEATERBOI!  I'VE ALSO HEARD THEY'RE GOOD IF YOU JUST WANT TO COOL OFF WHILE PLAYING KILLER.
---
I guess it's happening to many killers right now
---
ohh shit nope pc. But a LF took pizza dwight to the basement early on and went downhill from there :\
---
owo

---
There are kind of Angels/Fallen angels/Devils on the picture, completely not Tibetan looking imo.
---
Fair enough, but I figured if some rank 10-20 players read this they might gain some perspective. The game rewards you very little for the kills themselves, and much more for chasing and hitting multiple survivors.
---
It is based on the killers being played to the best of their ability. Cold dirt legion with Franks in the right hands is the most broken thing in the whole game.
---
Gordon already in the end zone, Antonio Brown streaking at 9000 miles an hour down the sidelines, Edelman running a perfect slant route down the middle and Gronk  on a deep slant route with James White open also.. As Patriots fan that is one hell of a good dream and not too far fetched 
---
I encourage downvoters to reread this and tell me if anything sounds off. (Spoiler alert, it's a grammar joke)
---
The most unrealistic part was about Gordon. He gone.
---
I never said you only go against bad players, I'm saying that the people who have tried holding the game hostage in your experiences just probably weren't very good at hiding, and thats because a lot of people simply don't try to do it.
---
You can't relate because your experience has only been positive in terms of when people have tried holding the game hostage. You don't even have to actively play dbd to see how absurd it is to ask someone to find a player with natural camoflauge like Claudette in an insanely dark, somewhat big map where survivors can be anywhere, that is, unless you're playing doctor. If it's the situation as previously described in other comments, it is classified as holding the game hostage, too.
---
If that's the way you want to play, then go for it. I think most people don't have every killer and survivor maxed though, and focus on kills because they think their supposed to. When in fact they could progress much quicker by not tunneling as hard.
---
If that were true, wouldn‚Äôt that make Legion at the top of this tier list? 
---
Eh... not really.
---
I know many guys like him. Wouldn't call them masculine either. YMMV. 
---
Top quality, of course
---
I saw that, I dont understand why they chose a horror game tho...
---
Hagrid
---
Uhhh. People DC because Legion isn‚Äôt fun to play against. 
---
Legion belongs in his own tier right below Freddy. I know everyone has their preferences, but damn do I disagree on that one. Worst killer for miles.
---
Granted, Adam provides it.
---
Spirit is addon-dependant and has lots of counterplay. You don't just loop her like you do a normal killer, you have to be good at juking and window loops. Shes definitely not in Nurses tier.
---
foot
---
Glad to know i'm not the only one then
---
Pig: I've personally never liked her bcos the traps are RNG, that's my only real reasoning. Aside from that though, her lunge isn't good at all, her stealth slows her down too much and she still has the exact same problems with pallets as most killers. Her only advantage in my eyes is that she tunnels like no other killer. If you have a seething hatred for a survivor, the pig us your best bet to completely tunnel them
---
Legion: Everyone DCs when its a legion. His ability is annoyingly effective and survivors can't escape him
---
Spirit: I wholeheartedly think she deserves to be at the top. Watch any YouTube videos or streams from literally anyone who has gamesence in the dbd community. The spirit has mind games, movement speed and vrazy builds like no other.
---
LF: a standard killer with an instant down. No gimmicks, no BS, just an instant down chainsaw. How is that bad?
---
Clown and Trapper: I honestly don't think you know the power of the trapper or the clown if you don't think they're average.
---
I agree 100%
---
Often times people are waiting to make sure everyone else gets out first. Waiting in case you need to go back for a save is different than tbagging at gate. 
---
Ah I get ya
---
Thanks for the clarification 
---
Let's be honest, Freddy needs a nerf and nurse needs a buff
---
His ability has no counterplay, but it's not good (franks or double cooldown aside). It takes too long to down someone, he has no map pressure, and his stall is negligible.
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/tqxgZou
---
Yes. 
---
How anyone with a brain can think that perk is overpowered is beyond me. Not only does it do nothing but take up a perk slot for the majority or entirety of the game, but it can be literally prevented from ever showing up in the first place, and if it does show up it can be removed. It is also completely negated by perks like borrowed time, and only does its primary effect on a hit, which can be prevented by throwing pallets down earlier (unless survivors wasted all the pallets already). It is only useful if the survivors lack skill.
---
The only reason there is any complaint about it at all is because salty survivors who gen rush can‚Äôt do their usual end-of-match BM fest as well. They‚Äôre forced to actually escape instead of sprinting around setting off notifications, hiding forever, and t-bagging. NOED punishes assholes, and assholes are a very vocal bunch.
---
There is a reason why the devs have said that they won‚Äôt nerf it. It only affects survivors who gen rush and do dumb shit because they think they‚Äôve won before they‚Äôve actually escaped.
---
Small game could help with that. Or they were able to run around the traps. It depends on the map guess. What map were you on?
---
PIIIIIZZZAAAAAAA!
---
Idk. It just seems like a really good perk. I'm a killer main, so I'm not as experienced with survivor perks.
---
Yeah I notice that too. 
---
Oink
---
that's interesting, hope it gets fixed soon
---
Opposite of that, I had been the only one to die and I still had 8k more BP than the next person. They got 5k just for escaping and when I had mentioned how bad my team was, they had the audacity to gang up on me and ask me "then why didn't you escape?"
---
Hide in the lockers when someone is hooked
---
Hex skill checks aren't that bad or try find the totem.
---
Sorted  :)
---
One of the corn maps
---
I'd have to disagree. I try to be as unbiased as I can, but the trapper is one of my favourite killers. 
---
He has some of the best basement gameplay out of all of the killers. He can shut down loops  when in a chase by placing a trap on the loop literally in front of the survivors face similar to hag. I'll admit he isn't as good as him glory days, but that's why you have to be completely unorthodox with your trap placements. If you even get a single survivor caught in your trap, it can shift the game in your favour immensely.
---
https://imgur.com/a/vfhpHpM
---
Clown really isnt as good as people say and freddy really isnt as bad as people say imo. 
---
Cultist vampire maybe? I mean, he's supposed to be the oldest one yet, and vampires are immortal. I'd have no idea what their ability would be either.
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about running a Pig basement build where I bodyblock the stairs to trap survivors until the RBT timer goes off and kills them. It sounds pretty effective on paper. Anyone have experience with this type of build?
---
Good thing it's in the shrine this week. 
---
Bubba is hAngry
---
If you really have this perspective on Ruin, you‚Äôre a good ass survivor. 
---
What did Wendy's do?
---
You sound like a steam forum killer 
---
Why would you need to work through it when the totem spawns right next to you anyway?
---
Waiting for zub‚Äôs next stream lmao
---
I've had this as Survivor before, but for some reason didn't think it could happen to killers.
---
And now I don't know which one would be worse.
---
No Mr. Peanutbutter so no
---
I don't think 500k will get you exactly to bbq but will get you closer. Either way, that perk is definitely worth it. You're basically investing in something that will get you more score, may cost you a lot to get it, but the investment will show fruitful in the future 
---
This wasn't that long ago 
---
&gt; Pig: I've personally never liked her bcos the traps are RNG, that's my only real reasoning.
---
Fair point
---
&gt; Aside from that though, her lunge isn't good at all, her stealth slows her down too much and she still has the exact same problems with pallets as most killers.
---
Her lunge is godly, people just use it wrong. Your not supposed to use it when sneaking up on people on gens, that when you uncrouch and grab. You use your lunge on loops, you can very eaisily get hits on pallets if you know how to use your ambush effectively.
---
&gt; Legion: Everyone DCs when its a legion. His ability is annoyingly effective and survivors can't escape him
---
He's annoying, not good.
---
&gt; Spirit: I wholeheartedly think she deserves to be at the top. Watch any YouTube videos or streams from literally anyone who has gamesence in the dbd community. The spirit has mind games, movement speed and vrazy builds like no other.
---
Too addon dependant really. No addon Spirit is rough. She is damn good, but she needs green addons or above to be effective.
---
&gt; LF: a standard killer with an instant down. No gimmicks, no BS, just an instant down chainsaw. How is that bad?
---
Because against good survivors you will never be able to use your power. Ever. You have to be breathing down the neck of the survivor your chasing AND pray there isn't any pallet or windows near. He is garbage.
---
&gt; Clown and Trapper: I honestly don't think you know the power of the trapper or the clown if you don't think they're average.
---
As a wraith main, I wish I could've put wraith higher, but I just can't. Any survivors with experience in the game will see you when you're stealth and the whole ambush factor is mitigated when his bell is loud af. With the coxcomb clapper and the ghost add-on, he is on an another level, but coxcomb clapper is expensive.
---
Pig I've never seen to be that good. Maybe I'm a hater, but the only times I've ever really been destroyed by a pig is when my teammates don't know how to counter the pig. She has great potential, but in practice I find that she falls flat on her face most times. If she works for you, more power to you, but she's just not for me.
---
OUCH
---
This is how spies got buffed. 
---
500 for hooking, another 500 for entity summoned (might be slightly off in that) and the 200 for the kill so. 2200 for killing a survivor if that's their last hook
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a killer main who plays other killers xD Freddy, pig, Michael 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter how strong or weak something is if it‚Äôs complete aids to go against 
---
Could be considered OP but would basically just encourage players not to body block hooks etc 
---
I'm gonna do everyone in due time B-)
---
[WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT] (/intensifies)
---
The possible killer list is hilarious, just took me out. But yeah--I agree. This was a good idea. This should be pinned. lol
---
I think the same, but I'm a bit cheap in paying those 500k points xD
---
I was hoping to get it from the store but it didn't appeared this week. 
---
Wow, thank you! :D
---
Getting into the lobby isn‚Äôt hard.
---
Getting past the loading screen is where things get interesting.
---
Bubba made survivor pudding out of both of our dwights :(
---
Well it's unfortunate that I haven't been able to sway you. My tier list still stands though, I'm curious to see what your tier list is though. Would you mind sharing?
---
Unpredictability? It's almost guarenteed someone will have noed when they do terribly. 
---
it would pay off in the long run tho, people would come back to the game if it was more stable and it would keep new players around 
---
Maybe its garlic...vampire priest would be sick!
---
Oh I will most definitely be doing Evan, maybe even with and without the mask! 
---
All the waifus
---
I pray that o get good enough at the game for that to happen
---
Indian too. I've gotten downvotes for saying it before, but a bigger, more diverse roster is never a bad thing. Inb4 "diversity for the sake of diversity nyahhh," they're essentially skins and more of all colors is good for everyone and the livelihood of the game.
---
I think its appeared once in its entire lifespan on the shrine. I wouldn't count on the shrine to provide such a nice gift for everyone
---
No worries, I'm doing all the killers for sure! :)
---
The devs have said that if killers want to have fun at rank 1 to just play Billy and Nurse, so thats what their doing ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
not unplayable, but some issues in their make the game work like their not supposed to and sometimes ruin the game
---
I'm sad now, I was just going to buy it with shards :C
---
A couple people isnt enough to make a character top tier, that's not how it works, a competitive for honor player that's in grandmaster can beat pretty much everyone with a shit tier character  does that make them top tier? Just because a couple people can doesnt make her top tier. The only top tier character on that list is quiet literally spirit for console 
---
I think he's the worst designed killer in the game hands down. Objectively though, in chasing and downing survivors, he is good at what he does, regardless of how annoying he is.
---
CaMpEr ^(/s)
---
PIZZA TIME
---
The suicide squad references would be lit. 
---
Regardless, he‚Äôs still alive.
---
I reckon its the Egyptian god of death Anubis!!!
---
Not everyone is from the US as well.
---
I dont think she is on Nurse level but still extremly powerful
---
my syndrome may be down, but my hopes are up!
---
If we are talking about PC id put huntress in A tier. Also poor legion
---
Playing Death Road to Canada with DBD Survivors. Found a place that had a shitload of kitchen knives just lying on the ground. Gave them all to Claudette.
---
As someone who runs Stake Out, I can‚Äôt say Ruin has ever been an issue for me. Can‚Äôt miss a great skill check when the whole zone is a great skill check. 
---
Huntress does not have enough map pressure to be on A level.
---
Fair point. There are some situations where the hindrance doesn't matter, but there are some situations where it really sucks to have to put survivors to sleep ( examples being generators that are 90% of the way done and having to watch as the survivor completes the gen, having to watch a survivor break your time in front of your face because you have to put the to sleep, watching as survivors unhook their teammates without being able to do anything)
---
Like I said before, Freddy is bad, but in a lot kf circumstances, I feel like I'm hinering myself by playing him.
---
Yeah unless you're playing with 3 randos, who all have to come 1 by 1 to check the hook, confirm the facecamp and go back to doing gens. Or unless the guy getting facecamped gets frustrated and kills himself (I've seen this happen multiple times)
---
Did he have to get kyf and replicate the match or how did he get these angles?
---
DOCTOR IS A BIG BLACK MAN 
---
Why so many Down votes on this üòÇ
---
Nah, she really only has one add on that makes her power extremely good but other than she‚Äôs not all that impressive.
---
Hmm 
---
YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM 
---
finally, Pizza Time!
---
... She can end chases in no time and even without add ons is fast enough to pressure multiple gens. You ever played a good spirit?
---
It's not delivery, it's Developers actually fixing the game challenge
---
Unfortunately there isn't much of an option for killers who wish to be competitive at high ranks. I never play Billy because I find him boring af, and I only play Nurse on occasion. I usually play any of the other killers because they're more fun to me and I don't really care about getting a 4K every game - but I cannot fault the players who  resort to those two killers because they give the highest chance of "winning". 
---
The main point of leather face is to go stand in the basement all game then kill anyone who dares to enter
---
Yeah I dont get this either. People I guess prefer to complain for literally years than spending 5$
---
Sadly the only decent cosmetics they've added have been event exclusives except legions. And the bugs should've been fixed by now it is highly irritating 
---
Xbox matchmaking is faster than PS4. The longest I‚Äôve had to wait for a game the past few months is like 10 min, and that‚Äôs while in a group and at the highest rank. 
---
I have the game on both Xbox and PS4. The Xbox community is bigger/more active, from my experience. 
---
The game is definitely worth it. I‚Äôve been playing pretty much nightly for the last year and a half. 
---
That said, it goes on sale a lot, too. So if you wanna wait a bit, you can probably get it cheaper. 
---
Yeah, you can dribble, but that still eats time. Like totem breaking with NOED does. **But** with NOED it can go off and still never affect you, no need to totem break. Just good play can see you through. That is not so with DS. If DS activates, you get hit. Period.
---
People don't actually heal against legion, they just rush gens and use Adrenaline. Maybe console is different idk
---
switch doc and lf and i‚Äôll agree
---
Gladly

I am very aware of the fact that traps can be disarmed very quickly, I am aware of dead hard and I am aware that trapper can get caught in his own traps.
---
Maybe I play trapper in a different way to other people but I don't use the traps to catch survivors, I use them to block off safe areas that if not dealt with by the survivors result in free downs. 
---
I think the trapper, the hag and the cannibal have the best basement gameplay of all killers hands down. You can't dissuade me from that opinion
---
Shhhhhh
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aus4c9/my_tier_list_im_curious_about_your_opinions_on/
---
I'm assuming you are going to disagree with Clown and Freddy.
---
Lol yeah. I figured the first 3 seem to be the most likely, but no reason not to include the other ones even if it is just for fun
---
Probably but if so then they need to make the hitboxes bigger because you shouldnt be able to just walk around it if you have the ability to just disarm it in 5 seconds
---
I think you're looking at him wrong. His ability is like making an investment. Yes someone may pop a gen in your face, but you've still slept them, you see them across the map, you know their every move until they manage to escape the dreamworld. Putting multiple people to sleep is often the better choice than sleeping one and hitting one, but his ability grants you a lot of information, and can even tell you where other survivors are (as an example, when you see someone waking up, it'll be a "2 for 1" sleep deal). I feel like the only real problem with freddy is the fact that adrenaline wakes survivors up and that getting up from dying state wakes them up, if that's gonna stay only one of them should stay 
---
WHY IS THERE A "G" IN KNIGHT?
---
How good play vs NOED can save you from it? By not being the unlucky one to get hit first and escaping? If you consider this a team game, overall your team still gets affected even if you do not personally
---
There seems to be a general consensus that doc should be higher and quite frankly, maybe he should be. 
---
LF on the other hand I think gets too much hate. He bootleg hillbilly, but is that so bad? If you're caught out in the open, it's a free down for LF and I think that's really good.
---
No problem! You definitely should, great music and concept 
---
Honestly that‚Äôs the first post on this subreddit that made me laugh, have my like.
---
Yes. After you get bbq you get twice the BP so it will be faster to lvl up and get them juicy addons. You didn‚Äôt mention a killer so I assume your playing LF anyways. So addons will come as you go for bbq if that‚Äôs the case. 
---
Didnt even pay Ricardo the respect he deserves SMH.
---
Ricardo deserve a full animation, thank god im learning PS
---
I, Dwight Fairfield have a dream. And that is to be the *GREATEST GANG-STAR OF ALL TIME*
---
After watching an ardetha video he mentioned something about all killers should turn their screen brightness up to help counter it. 
---
Absolutely love this! I'm a survivor main and this even sounds fun to go up against as well as to play.
---
Whenever the killer follows me to the escape I point for him to get out and then leave 
---
If I can I'll down the farmed one to prevent "safe unhook" points, but then the other person is going down.
---
He was so confused the whole game and had a hard time finding survivors 
---
Yeah yeah. xP
---
It's kay though, template is there so others can make more relevant jokes. :D
---
Cackled, keep up the good work!
---
Holy shit. I haven‚Äôt played the game since late October but why is wraith so bad now? He used to be at least B-A tier
---
Well I obviously can't convince you, which is fine, you're entitled to your own opinion. I don't know if my explanation of how I play the trapper is poor or if your mind is already completely made up, but I believe the trapper to be good if you know how to play him  (which I believe I do)
---
0/10  not enough claud
---
It is a very popular game... oh and XD
---
It‚Äôs cake to plow through and I‚Äôm on Xbox. 
---
Oh I guess they turned back on their new match making system, or is this a screen shot from a couple days ago?
---
#IT ISNT A FUCKING RESTRAUNT
---
Well now that you mention it also the score but being a new player and playing against survivors with 500+ hours isn't acceptable.
---
It's shitty to turn around and down *and hook* the person who got unhooked (I will sometimes hit them and leave them to prevent the "safe unhook" points).
---
But please feel free to go after the person who did the unhooking.
---
But their entire motto is that it isn‚Äôt delivery
---
Next time run your memes by me for inspection üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Really? Yesterday survivors were telling me that she's literally uncounterable 
---
weird
---
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=BM
---
It was sarcasm, sorry if I confused you. I think Freddy is the worst not because he is bad, but because in comparison to other killers, he's not that good.
---
Yes, ma'am.
---
That could be what happened but their matchmaking system must be pretty crappy if it let's new players play against 500+ hour survivors. And yes this is a new screenshot
---
If you down and hook the person who got saved, yes. If you get the other person, I say somewhere between no and maybe.
---
Wraith was considered a good killer for like a week and a half after being released lol
---
Lmao I‚Äôm just saying in general restaurants on social media. I don‚Äôt even know this place lol
---
that was a cool mission. 
---
what build do you run(skyrim &amp; DBD)? 
---
Agreed
---
Wrong, after a few games your piece of shit PC starts lagging hard because you own it, and the low fps endured from your porno coinminers totally ruin the immersement. Then, your mom.
---
That‚Äôs a yikes from me dawg
---
Oh, then yeah. I think the pointing and waving is funny when I'm playing killer but not the other shit. But, I've also only been playing for a month so I haven't experienced anyone being totally rude post game. 
---
Yeah. For wraith, if they don‚Äôt fall for the uncloak fakes to bait down pallets and you don‚Äôt have bamboozle then you can have serious problems. 
---
Okay, good deal?
---
I would assume.
---
rip in peace everybody

Yeah, bamboozle is a god-send

You know a killer is bad when you hope that a killer hits you with their power than normally. Freddy is much better than him, switch their places and the list is almost perfect. If you would like to hear more about why I think freddy is far from the worst killer, do me. This is an open invitation to anyone who wants to hear more. 
---
True, you just urban evasion outta that bitch when she starts her shit, but I mean, she has literally no counter.
---
So so bad. I just wanted to be toxic and flashlight save and insta heal in front of the killer :(
---
He can be good, but it relies on the survivors being bad.
---
Does all info have to come through streams , we got a blog post for DS , why waste the 2 hours setting up the stream if all the info you need to give can fit onto a blog post.
---
By all means, voice your opinions on Freddy, I'd love to hear what you want to say
---
Hello?? This is the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen on this subreddit???? God bless your friend, and I hope you enjoy the DLC!
---
"~as a killer main~ allow me to tell you why ACKSHUALLY getting kills is not the objective"
---
lol okay. 
---
FELLOW FREDDY, I HAVE FINALLY FOUND ANOTHER! Completely agree with your tier list. I hate how people say "but he needs to wait 7 seconds." And then discards him. Justice for Freddy.
---
I think i said "OMG" irl and typed to him over a 100 times. I was so mindblown when i saw this gift. I gave him a bearhug after i saw him IRL. Was overflowing with happiness.
---
Who's Jason? Trapper?
---
Indeed.
---
DON‚ÄôT TRUST MYER LOL
---
Heh, and here I am always trying to play killer but having to give up because wait times are so fucking long. I can't imagine why people don't want to deal with early camping and tunneling every other game, not to mention killers getting free wins with an early DC and still deciding to punish the people who didn't leave by playing as cutthroat as possible.
---
There very much so is a correct tier list. But it's hard to determine because personal feelings, and low rank fluke wins clouds people's judgements. That and the fact that few are a master with every killer. Maybe Tru3ta1ent is, he plays every killer regularly so I trust his opinion, but I don't think he's made a tierlist.
---
Your ‚Äúinsert-troubled-receiver-we‚Äôre-paying-unders-on‚Äù for 2020 will be Brown, not Gordon. Gordon too far gone. It‚Äôs sad but he needs too much help...and Brown is ruining his value by the day that I can see NE picking him up cheeap.
---
Git gud
---
You have to let it rest. I have not played for 2 weeks and have rediscovered the world. I'll play again in a few weeks.
---
What do you mean by this?
---
Agreed. The only problem I have with it is end game, as if survivors aren't strong enough at end game already.
---
I think you need around 900000-1mil bloodpoints to get to level 40 to get bbq unlocked, although it will get you very close. 
---
Where are damn Kate cosmetics?
---
PR = People Representatives. They are literally hired to take our input and unmad the community. 
---
Just more venting about people being assholes and making the game un-fun. This is why I prefer to be a survivor main.
---
Okay.
---
I love pizza dwight but am I the only one who thinks this is a horrible cosmetic?
---
Yeah, I never understood the thinking that survivor is "relaxing" while killer is hard. I can load up one of my good killers right now and be 100% guaranteed a 4k, because I'm still at rank 7 or so and haven't climbed back up after rank reset, but my survivor rank is also low, and that just means my teammates are going to make me feel homicidal.
---
Hide in a locker/Hide behind a gen/Run distortion
---
Trust me, everyone on both sides is sick of the same perks on rank 1. Decisive strike, sprint burst, adrenaline, borrowed time etc. Ruin, bbq, nurses calling, enduring etc etc
---
thanks man!
---
Honestly, I don't think it ever will be on the Shrine again. It was on the Shrine once, and that was when Leatherface was new, which was quite a while ago.
---
Rule 3
---
Check the game files and see where the reports go once sent
---
gotta balance it all out
---
I'd like for the devs to play around with the idea of survivors not knowing they fell asleep. In the movies, there's sometimes no clue that they fell asleep except for red and green lights... In DBD, it's extremely obvious that Freddy put you to sleep, nevermind actually being asleep.
---
&gt; In a time of darkness, some look for a light to follow
---
What do you think about this? This is a official quote, according to something the OP posted in the reply section.
---
Does your theory explain this?
---
Not trying to sound like I don't believe you. I think your theory is very compelling and I am wondering if this fits in at all.
---
You can play however you want, I'm just pointing out that hitting all 4 survivors a couple of times gets you more points than hitting 1 until they die.
---
Just don't tunnel after the obsession is dead and it won't be a problem. I don't understand the worry about Dying Light.
---
I think you're right on that one. I was mainly thinking that the survivor were the shitbags, but your moral definitely fits better. I'm editing that one.
---
Wait so why is every killer upset with DS? What does the perk do that upsets people, I thought it was just a way to get out of their grasp, I don't have it so I don't understand. 
---
emoting at the killer is typically done under the same vein as teabagging and is considered bm.
---
Every little thing a killer does gives them blood points. It's meaningless. Kills are the objective metric whether you like it or not. It's so obvious that this is just shit pushed by survivor mains
---
No, that's Freddy. Are you blind?
---
Uhm.....the logic fallacies you just displayed are something else.....
---
After Jeff I have high hopes. It doesn't even need to be a person of particular gender, skin color or nationality. I just want to see nice design and not-so-bad lore.
---
Get good baby killer
---
The legion can do that, however if the survivor is good he wont be able to catch them, due to him being 110% movement speed.
---
7 seconds fedora man bad lol
---
Jeff but it's Channing Tatum!!
---
I‚Äôm so glad I play this game on console, end game chat is so toxic. 
---
YOU CAN'T DERANK PAST 15 ANYMORE, IT'S JUST PLAYERS PLAYING LATE INTO RANK RESET.
---
Tru3 is good with every killer but not great. I don't really trust his opinions tbh, he has had some weird ones in the past (still love him tho)
---
The pattern for non-licensed is usually male-female, and vice-versa for the killer. The only same gender original release was Nurse and Nea. This should be male killer and female survivor. 
---
When you have 4 friends for a SWF but 0 in real-life.
---
What a bunch of actual losers.
---
I'M SICK OF BEING CALLED SALTY EVERY TIME THE KILLERS WIFI IS GARBAGE AND I FEEL THE NEED TO LET THEM KNOW. LIKE I JUST WANT TO INFORM THEM WHAT WAS GOING ON AND HOW PLAYING AGAINST THEM MIGHT NOT BE FUN UNTIL THEY FIX IT. I GET IT COULD BE THE SURVIVORS FAULT, BUT WHEN IT ISN'T IT IS ANNOYING BEING CALLED SALTY JUST FOR INFORMING THEM. I CANT WAIT FOR DEDICATED SERVERS
---
Now that‚Äôs a good idea‚Ä¶ however sometimes I loose them. If I can‚Äôt find the person who unhooked, and I find the person who got unhooked, I will rehook them ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
What is digornio
---
Bethesda hires them to make the Fallout Shelter game and let them work (essentially) with their code. They signed an agreement saying what they did there, stayed there. 
---
WB later hired BHVR to make a WestWorld mobile game and they basically copy pasted the work they did with Bethesda. Bethesda sued them.  BHVR knowing they were fucked, settled for an undisclosed amount. 
---
I agree, there should not be two  GG's when the other three are gg's REEEE
---
HE LOOKS GRAY TO ME
---
Why is he carrying the pizza like that though
---
Trap the dropped items
---
Well. Last killer was male and female with a male survivor, and the one before was also male survivor. 
---
why is he carrying the pizza like that though
---
Well a correct tier list implies that data would've been gathered which implies that each of the intricacies of the killers, from their height, to their ability, to functionality on certain maps, could be quantified and statistically ranked against each other in order to obtain a 'correct tier list'.
---
This has not happened, nor will happen as a lot of the variables that make up the killer are either qualitative or subjective and not quantitative which makes the variables unusable in a statistical ranking system.
---
Though I would definitely trust someone like tru3 or Monto or any other member of the dbd community with vast experience, I almost guarantee that their tier lists will differ from each others, despite equal amounts of experience with the game. The differences will not be cause by statistical facts or anomalys in judgement, but due to opinion. 
---
Opinions are what make killer tier lists, not facts.
---
Huntress has a much better basement game than Trapper tbh. All she has to do is stand at the top of the stairs and chuck hatchets.
---
Myers' competition? :O 
---
Does quick and quiet stop the noise from slow-entering lockers?
---
Comic Negan memes will always get an upvote from me &lt;3
---
can we talk about how he is carrying the pizza
---
By that logic all the trapper has to do is place a trap at the top of the stairs. Quite the same scenario, wouldn't you agree?
---
Yes 100%. Clown is garbage, and Freddy is mid high tier.
---
I don't. I refuse to pile onto the shit for the unhooked person, playing solo survivor is hard enough when you aren't being actively farmed. Besides, if I'm close enough when they unhook to find the injured person, I was close enough to find the unhooker.
---
Just in case he bangs his head on a locker and not multiple swings from blades, clubs, and even chainsaws, definitely no
---
I don't think so. But it will make it pretty much silent to fast enter lockers.
---
I have wanted there to be a badass old lady survivor forever. 
---
Except you have literally no way of knowing when she "starts her shit"
---
And wtf does urban do to her exactly? She can't see you anyways while she's phasing, so it's no better than just walking 
---
ayy, birthday brothers
---
Had the same issue when i played surv, it's pretty annoying
---
I hate being the last survivor and not being able to find the hatch. I'm way way way better at hiding and not being found in the first place than looping, so I'm going to work methodically and carefully. Then I feel bad cause it seems like I'm trying to take the game hostage.
---
I will briefly cover 3 things, the dream transition, the slowdown, and the aura reading. 
---
People like to instantly dismiss freddy because of the 7 seconds, most even think that the block addons are his best. However without going into depth because I'm on mobile, if a freddy has reached a point where the 7 seconds matters, namely opening gates and getting in the hatch, he has already greatly messed up. The dream transition is super good for mind gaming especially with the pill bottle. 
---
The slowdown is just great, it means that without even considering the aura, survivors will focus on spending time getting out of the dream ASAP, and they cannot make much progress before so. Given how easy it is to put many survivors into dream state for how much it can slow down survivors, it can bring the game to a halt. Another angle is its endgame potential. It applies to gates meaning it is like a free tier one version of remember me just for using the power. Adding in remember me makes it almost impossible to open gates asleep. It buys him so much time.
---
Finally is the most powerful part of his kit, the aura reading. Once again another part of Freddy's kit is overlooked, many people think it's only good for tunneling to find a survivor you are chasing when you lose them. The aura gives you so much control because in most scenarios being a good killer means you can predict where survivors will go, but with freddy you don't have to. You can easily prioritize target based on if they are healing far from pallets, trying to get that gen that's almost done, or even just a way to get right into a chase after hooking for max pressure. Let alone that survivors who are asleep will be very cautious knowing that they are revealed to freddy. 
---
Finally the cherry on top is the fact that he isn't slow, is short and dark for mind games, and he doesn't breath so you can hear better, makes freddy a much better killer than most give him credit for.
---
What did i just read.. wha...
---
This is the feeling
---
Good luck actually catching anyone with that trap lmao. The survivors will just run right by it.
---
As in, they aren't directly teasing the Killer, but showing a part of the map. This indicates the theme of the Killer, however.
---
Pikachu as a playable character needs to happen
---
Why wont it be a problem? 
---
Hags too low, Spirit too high and Freddy way too low. Also Clown is a bit high.
---
Gotta get ready for the hatchets somehow
---
I think wraith is better than trapper for sure and arguably leathrface.  Trapper takes too much time and can have little reward for his time spent.  Wraith can at least patrol gens quite effectively
---
Justice CRASH!
---
&gt; It's meaningless
---
It is if you've sunk 250+ hours into the game and have maxed everything. If you haven't, then it means a lot.
---
THANK YOU! AND FOR THE SAKE RAGING AGHHHHHHHH
---
Nega-Pope
---
Like I said, don't tunnel and it won't be a problem. A new obsession can only proc if you tunnel someone off hook and pick them up. Just don't do that and Dying Light won't have a problem. 
---
JUST KEEP PRACTICING, DON‚ÄôT FEEL BAD ABOUT LOSING, AND WATCH SOME TUTORIALS ONLINE.
---
DAMNNOHTML IS A GOOD KILLER CONTENT CREATOR
---
Same, I definitely do always go for the unhooker‚Ä¶ I probably will just leave the unhooked from now on, you‚Äôre right. Those gens need to be checked on anyways üëè
---
Couldn't agree more. Range addons and dresses are my baby.

Id actually rather see the Pats go for John Brown or Humphries tbh. 
---
Is that Sally Hardesty?
---
"hero" 
---
Ok. That's probably why then. Most likely new killer or not paying attention.
---
Didn't need to put an excerpt from your diary in the title 
---
Would be pretty neat if they went down the same route as Pt 3 Dream Warriors... Survivors are assigned a randomly generated dream ability which can increase their chance of survival in dream state. Or maybe it just buffs a perk they already have. Sprint Burst for instance, for each time you‚Äôre pulled into dream state your Sprint Burst is increased by 2seconds etc.
---
Buff the survivors yo 
---
Thank you, I was ranting and the positive responses replies like yours makes me hopeful in this community again. Thanks.

I was having lag on PC. The skill checks were harder to hit due to chopiness. Then one day i swapped my mouse out for a better one. Suddenly my fps is better and skill checks are smooth and now it hit ruin checks most of the time. (Except for when i think its a good idea to join a game with 150+ ping)
---
Moral of the story: be careful of cheap mice.
---
THANKS FOR THE RECOMMENDATION. WHEN THE ENTITY IS DISPLEASED, IT MAKES ME DISPLEASED AS WELL. 
---
Yes, by not getting hit. NOED doesn't guarantee any hits, I've had plenty games where no one get hit in the end game. There's no luck and there doesn't have to be a first hit. That's what good play does.
---
The team is irrelevant. This is only a "team game" in so much as there's 4 people sharing an objective who need to use each other to complete said objective. But there's no team objective, you're solo players taking advantage of each other for personal survival. When push comes to shove you're competing with the other Survivors as much as the Killer.
---
&gt;Dribbling also takes considerably less time than finding and breaking all 5 totems
---
Irrelevant.
---
And that actually worked?
---
On the one hand, I'd like Wraith's, Spirits, and Legions to not be able to cheese the chase mechanic. On the other hand, I *like* the fact that Lithe only procs in a chase. It's impossible to accidentally use it, and it's always there when I need it.
---
That's a really good idea! Imagine Freddy popping out of nowhere when you had no idea you were asleep. Would make him a lot more entertaining to play against.
---
Thank you. I was ranting and the positive comments like yours makes me hopeful in this community again. thanks.
---
I dont think the Dwight expected it to work either...
---
Regardless of strength, it promotes bad gameplay.  The killer has significantly less incentive to apply map pressure and to improve as killer in general.  It discourages altruism from survivors because they dont want to unhook the distraction because they (understandably) don't want to fuck with NOED.  I'm well aware that it is counterable but it is not enjoyable for either side in my opinion.
---
Well as far as skyrim goes I've tried almost everything I wanted, right now I'm going heavy armor, two handed/illusion as I've never really gotten into illusion before
---
Dbd: Freddy, I use monitor and abuse, remember me, BBQ and chilli and enduring. Although blood warden is swappable with remember me but I almost never get to a spot where I can use it, but when I do, oh boi oh boi it's glorious. Most of the time the exit gates don't get opened
---
Lol I didn't realize I said that. I obviously meant Survivor. I play too many other games
---
But how often do you accidentally fast vault? For me that's never, and I'd still be able to use it when I'm being chased, whether or not the game thinks I'm being chased.
---
These are very cute :3 Enjoyed quite a bit.
---
Unbroken emblem points
---
What are you talking about?  There‚Äôs at least two there. 
---
I never saw this until after I played the game for awhile. At first I wondered if they were platform exclusives. I would love to see this girl in the game.
---
I run Quick &amp; Quiet, so I'm fast vaulting more often than most. I wouldn't like being able to use my Lithe if it activated outside of a chase.
---
He's always been mediocre at best
---
Hmm, maybe it could activate while within terror radius and fast vaulting? 
---
It's not very fun to get SWF genrushed every game either 
---
A little humor can go long way, if and when people in this game appreciate it that is.
---
Aka, the r/dbdgonewild side of the game
---
&gt;Save
---
**d a r n** 
---
Your first point is really good actually; I very much agree that if a Freddy finds himself in a situation where the 7 secs is an issue, he himself is to blame.
---
Your second point is very niche; I'll admit, I saw a video on you (Monto I think) where end game Freddy demolished, but I don't think that it's something that you should rely on. End game is always risky, but if you run remember and even blood warden, I could see how Freddy could be seriously dangerous at the end game.
---
Your third point is good; the aura reading is often overlooked, but survivors get out of dream state rather quickly sometimes so the aura reading, though very handy, is mitigated by survivors trying to leave dream state.
---
Your fourth point is something I didn't even consider, and you've opened my eyes to something I didnt even consider with Freddy.
---
I want to say though that there are some negatives with playing Freddy that go beyond the surface level of '7 seconds to go to sleep'
---
1- the fog is a hindrance to Freddys vision and of survivors run misty reagents, it is a nightmare to play Freddy
---
2- survivors try to leave dream state ASAP and they can do this very easily but failing gen skill checks or finding a survivor that is awake
---
3- Freddy is poor at protecting totems. I don't think you should rely on totems as a killer, but as a Freddy, you should just kiss your ruin or devour hope goodbye
---
4- Freddy, like a lot of other killers in the game, has no mind game potential unless of course you run 'pill bottle'
---
5-Adrenaline counters Freddy very heavily
---
I think you made some really good points though.
---
Maybe make it a certain proximity to the killer instead. Wraith can cheese the entire chase mechanic simply by cloaking.
---
I think it is a Mayan person.
---
This makes me so happy. Stupid NOED frosty-eyed bitch. 
---
Where can I read about this? Never heard of it before
---
How do you mean? 
---
You‚Äôll get reported for body blocking them in the basement.
---
How is it toxic to return the favor for a survivor who risked their life to save you? This is a noble play on both survivors who value doing the right thing rather than just escaping to ensure they get the full bp and screwing the other over. It‚Äôs called teamwork.
---
Dude how do you not understand that it's not a place, it's a brand of frozen pizza. This is like saying "Hey let's go to Tyson's Chicken Nuggets" or "I don't wanna cook let's order Hot Pockets" 
---
how much do i owe ya?
---
I don‚Äôt own her but her sound when she gets stun is saddening af
---
Damn! I played with you today, I was All-time_Whovian. Remember me?
---
If you want to get a strong endgame with no worries of failure you bring classroom photo (this addon helps you be strong all game yeah, but endgame you become an actual Nightmare) and then sleep everyone, this becomes so easy with this addon's aura reading and survivors will not really have anything to wake up with. My overkill setup is: BBQ for some basic aura rading to find the next non-sleeping survivors, NOED  cause i love the end game, Remember Me  and Bitter Murmur to keep finding more non-sleeping survivors
---
Addons: Classroom Photo, Blue Dress
---
The one guy ran out as soon as Meg got downed. So obviously he wasnt trying to save anyone because the killer wasn't even looking his direction. So if we're going the whole altruistic route, he wasn't doing a very good job because he could've taken a hit and still gotten knocked out and escaped. 
---
well after trying something someone taught me about hexed generators i believe this post. 
---
Omg. Hi!!!!! 
---
I'm glad someone else had the same idea as me. Props to perfecting the outfit.
---
It's OK you can play DBD on Switch now. Big improvement!
---
It pops up whenever you're in the killer's terror radius, including the edge of it. This means that you see it even if you can't loudly hear the killer's terror radius yet.
---
I agree, but I still don't think Ruin is a very fun perk. It doesn't do anything for the killer's fun (other than make the game go longer, which is not a noticeable "ah yes it was Ruin that made that fun"), but it noticeably makes it less fun to play survivor. I think that's pretty lame and I'd like to see it reworked. That would be a net-nerf for the killers though, so I'd additionally like to see either more secondary objectives or potentially an overall nerf to gen speed or something along those lines. I don't run it as a killer, even if that means I potentially get genrushed, simply on the principle that I do not like playing against the perk so I don't want to subject others to it either. 
---
Lmaoooo it‚Äôs okay about the bad healing... those skillchecks can be pretty tricky sometimes lol
---
Yes true, but that's the killers choice to run it. If a survivor perk lit up when within a certain range of the killer, that would likely cause balance problems 
---
Can we get a sound clip of Tobey Maguire saying "Pizza time" every time Dwight hops in a locker with this on?
---
Wait, it's not a house in the background with a phat ass chimney?
---
According to the wiki, it has never appeared
---
A survivor perk not working because the killer can cheese the chase mechanic causes balance problems.
---
I seriously just looked away cause the other guy was getting hit, and forgot I was Also doing something lol. 
---
Trust me I know, that was my whole point in making this post.
---
There is no good reason for Lithe to have the chase requirement. It's stupid that they haven't removed it.
---
Besides a few small balance options, which really shouldn't be a problem, I can't see any reason it's chase specific. 
---
To be fair, its roleplaying of delivering a pizza because its all within the trial so it's not delivery...it COULD BE DiGiorno
---
yeah that happens to me too, oh well looking forward to the next game we play! gg!
---
Ace says 10 percent
---
I'm usually pretty good at not sending hate messages or losing my cool when I get hate messages but what frustrated me was being teabagged and spammed when I'm playing nurse and could easily destroy them with any other killer but yeah I usually dont mind teabagging or flashlight spamming
---
Of course üòÇ
---
Yeah I've picked up survivor a bit more recently when I usually main killer but I never teabag or taunt unless the killer is playing toxic like camping or a moonwalking legion.
