It was in there once, 6 weeks after Leatherface came out. Not once since.

Ah, that‚Äôs exactly where I thought she should be placed! I appreciate this, thank you. I just hope that her power to leave survivors Broken doesn‚Äôt leave her vulnerable the way survivors used to not heal completely up while going against Legion. 
---
I think he's on a low tier because you have a Hillbilly. They have the same ability except Hillbilly has mobility so technically BBQ and Billy is better than BBQ and Bubba. 
---
It'd be fine if they didn't ask the same question every other new player does. Use the search function people.

I always thought that he killed the workers because his dad told him to. It seems like at some point he started suffering from some kind of degenerative mental disorder, and his son, still idolizing him, kept following his every command, even when said commands became "go off a buncha people for no discernable reason."
---
I'm not sure that Trappy would have lifted a finger against him, unless corruption by the Entity was already at play. It's entirely possible, look at Rin's dad. 
---
Exactly lmao
---
Survive With Friends, it allows survivors to choose the people they survive with before getting put in a lobby.
---
Don't let some jerk bring you down. You made me laugh! I've been feeling so tired and a little blue and it brightened up my night. That's A+ to me. 
---
She also chained them in a corner so they wound't run away, also, only little girls. She killed the boys.
---
&gt; When they downvote me, they're saying I'm right.
---

---
Are they though? ü§î
---
Id like the sickness to do more, like slowing the survivors action speed and a way to get corrupt intervention without having to go to the fountains. Maybe make it so that if a survivor cleanses all fountains become corrupted for a bit idk.
---
So when can i buy it? Really like your works !
---
So are all 4 gay or?
---
*screams in i am too poor to buy amanda*
---
I feel it. Solo and SWF (even with a four stack-(teaching new friends how to play)) matches take forever. I thought it was just me.

Ok

Its all just guesses honestly. Most are thinking the 19th of March.

MY FRIEND AND I GOT INTO A MATCH WITH OUR FAVORITE STREAMER AND HER FRIEND AND WE DIDN'T REALIZE IT UNTIL AFTERWARDS. SHE TRASHTALKED US THE WHOLE TIME AND WE VOWED TO NEVER WATCH HER AGAIN. (I LITERALLY DID ALL 5 GENS)
---
Well if we say that the Nurse and Spirit are strong, we can agree it is because of the Entity, right?
---
So if we go by that logic, it strengthens what I am saying.
---
Entity prob gave legion the power of a bull and the fury as a bull that was kicked by the previous bull.
---
If we can't agree on their dangerous level pre entity, we can at least agree that the Entity's favor gives them a HUGE advantage
---
A SWF group is a group of survivors that are communicating with each other. People often complain about 4 man SWF as the information they all share is often not supposed to be known by the whole team at some points in the match.
---
For example: often in solo matches multiple survivors will attempt to unhook the same person due to a lack of info. This leads to less generator progress and it gains the killer a lot of time. However, a SWF group can communicate with each other to figure out who will unhook their friend whilst the other two do gens, taking away a lot of the killers momentum.
---
If there are any spelling errors it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs very late where I am and my eyes are blurry.
---
Is that her dad in the front row with the flowers or an elderly admirer?
---
I know the window at Yamoaka is buggy and will sometimes not let you fast vault- neither survivor or Legion was able to get over it.   
---
If you got good accuracy and can hit a survivor full stream then you got effectively a 2 shot, so a pallet destroyer build works well on her
---
I haven't seen anyone having problems with vaulting, do you think it's just the killers connection
---
Noob3's 2 personalities...
---
Shouldn't Laurie be at the left
---
None of the killers are unplayably bad right now, but Leatherface is definitely weaker than most. He has no pressure, no speed, and no stealth potential, and what he gets out of it is a rather situational instadown tool.
---
His saw isn't unusable, but he needs to be very close to get use out of it, and if a survivor is near a loop, it's almost impossible to get a saw off unless you pull of a really good mindgame.
---
His saw is just more situational and generally less useful than other killers' powers.
---
Michael runs well no items IMO
---
Exactly! 
---
I‚Äôve never got so many threats or spammed with hate mail ever in my life until I started playing this game a couple months ago.
---
Seems people can‚Äôt understand that not  only is this just a video game, but life goes on whether you win a match or not. Growing up playing competitive sports, I‚Äôve never came across so many poor sports as the players in this game
---
Eleventhed 
---
lol the new stupid player is me
---
I thought you put him there because he tried murdering several babysitters
---
BC freddy is at the bottom? I could try to explain why he isnt as bad as people say if you wanted.
---
NOED is literally fine , learn to break totems. 
---
don‚Äôt understand people‚Äôs hate towards a hex totem that has direct counters. 
---
Honestly rank 1 meant literally nothing before the first rank change. Rank 1 was retard easy to get as survivor due to infinite‚Äôs and pallets paired with just being easy to pip in general. Likely a rank 8-12 player in today‚Äôs game. 
---
The DLC is two weeks later than expected. People be bored.
---
Also, Killers are awaiting the DS nerf so we never have to deal woth that toss again.
---
I can only wish Jeff would babysit me when I was a child
---
Lol not bunny mama

---
Thanks!! 
---
Welcome to someone's aspect that shouldn't be making tier list
---
he'd cut the kids finger off
---
When I was at rank 1 killer the past season or whatever they are called I would often run into the same 4 man swf group who would have 3/4 dc when on their last down to protect their flashlights, then I got sick of it after like 7 games of it I started to dc as the killer against them. Most satisfying one was when they used 4 streamers, fuck your bp you annoying bastards.
---
Yeah, another dissapointment for our Hilly Billy. 
---
But it massively affects how fast you go down and thus the time your team has to do gens in the first place.
---
Yooo I‚Äôve been looking for this since you put it in the postgame chat! It‚Äôs ya boi beeg yoshi! That was a dope fame 
---
‚Äúalmost everything,‚Äù does not solely mean Freddy my good sir. 
---
Anyways, carry on. 
---
Don't spread misinformation, dude...
---
I will not ever understand why people let streamers get to them.  They are just people, usually arrogant who deserve to be knocked from their pedestals which people put them on.  It‚Äôs not all streamers though. Some are very knowledgeable and entertaining.  Take it with. Grain of salt and the insults are usually given because it makes them feel better about themselves in from of an audience. Pay no mind and keep playing. 
---
Gees you guys are insane, how did i get 310 upvotes over like half a day, i thought this was so simple that someone had to of already done it, gg i guess lol

https://www.reddit.com/r/SuperNt/comments/axmtc3/a_way_to_shut_down_the_super_nt_from_the_menu/
---
You mean this post? You weren't downvoted to hell and you didn't get a bunch of rude people. You got a few upvotes and two people were being rude with one person trying to help you.
---
You dont know how to play him obviously, because he's extremely good at shutting down loops. Just like with Huntress hatchets, if you use all your bottles and theyre not down, you did it wrong. You literally throw a bottle at the top of the pallet, and boom you won the loop. They are forced to drop it or get hit, or both happen. Either way, the loop is won.
---
If you put on spirit fury/enduring/bamboozle/perk of choice and use the hindered penalty and exhaused addons, its impossible to loop him without getting hit
---
The only ‚Äúscary‚Äù Skin he has is the Halloween one, and even that one is a little weak.
---
I wasn't that bothered about it, but my friend seems pretty hurt by it. I know of plenty of perfectly pleasant streamers, but there are certainly a lot of toxic ones.
---
Wow, nice assumption. Yeah, Freddy should be at the bottom, but Clown and Trapper are DEFINITELY not F tier. Clown can slow them down in a chase which is godly, and Trapper can deadass stop the chase if he‚Äôs smart. Overall, I suggest reconsidering the list after playing the killers a few times.
---
THAT FUCKING SUCKS, SORRY THAT HAPPENED TO YOU!
---
Obligatory do you not have phones?
---
It really was! I was freaking out about this for most of the endgame haha
---
Bill would teach the kids to add Fuck into every sentence.
---
Figured it sounded so absurd, no one would believe it
---
Me and Lucky weren‚Äôt leaving yet bc we were gonna stay and make sure you got it off, we were so confused when you escaped üòÇ
---
I get that struggling by mashing keys adds a bit of intensity but...
---
ITS ANNOYING and not scary at all for experienced players. I dunno about skill checks cause there are poor ppl who are awful at them, but it shouldn‚Äôt be mashing.
---
You asked for why he's considered bad and you're getting answers. If you didn't want the answer to your question, why did you ask it?
---
Chests are a waste of time. If you open chests, you aren't gen rushing effectively. Bad survivor play.
---
Leatherface with totems? The only totem any half decent LF would use is Ruin, and if you're sitting there thinking "totem in middle of cornfield vs leatherface, can't possibly go wrong", then you're an idiot.
---
Hooks? Why do hooks matter? If LF isn't running good addons then none of the survivors should be getting downed before at least 3-4 gens are done. Let the guy die on hook, 3 escape. Only bad survivors go for hooksaves if you don't think they're safe.
---
What have we learned today, classroom? Leatherface can only do moderately okay against bad players if he doesn't have good addons. If he does have good addons, you still could have performed better with Billy.
---
What?
---
So technically the trap could go off while on the hook if not rescued?  I like it.
---
Me and Lucky were swf too and weren‚Äôt leaving till you got it off. We were so confused when you escaped haha
---
Yes I have a phone. Man i must sound really stupid rn.
---
If a killer got moris then you fucked either way if they aren't a potato
---
The issue is that whenever someone uses the word "gay" this way, it's being used as a synonym for the word "bad." Gay=something negative. I am gay and would absolutely never use the word this way
---
&gt;Pallets used up
---
If you run out of pallets, *especially* on a Coldwind map, it's because somebody wasted the pallets. You can easily loop a leatherface for 5 gens on most Coldwind maps without running out of pallets.
---
I apologize on behalf of the survivor community 
---
I think KlatusHam was trolling you hard lol.
---
Yeah for sure.  He is a rank 1 though.  What people say should not matter.  If I listened or took anything to heart that people message me or talk shit I would never want to play this game.  Dust on the shoulders.
---
When you're just trying to win a game fair and square and there's a killer also trying to win in the SAME match, smh. 
---
you heard the man, do as he told you
---
Which killer are you using? I feel like grabs are broken with The Spirit when she's using the addon that makes her reappearance speed faster
---
Supa hot locker

I‚Äôve had this happen with Myers too, on Xbox. So it must be across all platforms

PEOPLE WHO PLAY THE PIG AND TUNNEL PEOPLE WITH TRAPS ON THEIR HEAD WHILE 3 OTHERS ESCAPE, YOU'RE A SPECIAL KIND OF PATHETIC
---
In the movie there was a guy that wore blue! But he ended up being a double agent, then a triple agent, and then I don‚Äôt remember if he swapped sides again üòÜ. But it was a guy so maybe should of had Dwight with a blue shirt or something instead to be üëå
---
Are you nuts lol, no decent Killer will lose more than 5 seconds with an well done Diversion play. Indeed it is in fact more fun, it's a whole new mechanic built just to annoy the Killer, but a guaranteed Great Skill Check was the difference between life and death more than once for me while healing a teammate or repairing that last gen.
---
But yes, it is certainly an alternative to Stake Out and one that I'm sure a lot of people will choose, so I'm going to add it to my post if you don't mind :)
---
The survivor was just camping the hatch. Nah dude.
---
Plus I‚Äôm not gonna double depip for someone else to get out and screw the killer over. I already run Unbreakable in my builds cause even just the recovery speed bonus is helpful, but DCing just cause you got slugged is a pretty crappy thing to do.
---
I agree! Though I have been having more luck if I restart the app once I‚Äôve been waiting too long, it‚Äôs almost like the issue is with the lobby because after I restart I usually find a game fairly quick.
---
I use different ones. The Wraith, Hag, Meyers, Huntress mostly.
---
I can‚Äôt stand people like this. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my way of boycotting it.‚Äù What a fucking moron
---
Who else? The plague, I can understand the legion but her?
---
Also WTF is feddy doing out of **F** tier!? Why is hag so high!?
---
Every killer is in O tier. No more arguements about things that wont matter in 30 years.
---
Well idk about who sent you that, but I send ggs to any killer who was playing well/trying hard and not being toxic. Some of them are really good and kick my ass, and some are obviously newer or well below my rank so it was a bit unfair.  But I send a friendly gg bc they're learning and not being assholes, I don't mean it sarcastically bc I still had fun playing. 
---
literally the shittiest tier list ive ever seen for this game. Worst part is I don't even think you're trolling
---
**"The right thing to do"?** According to whom, you?
---
If another survivor is downed and I get hooked first, sometimes I kill myself to let the other get the hatch, but I would never sacrifice my hard earned points and my pip just for another random player to get a couple more points.
---
Scrubs will tell you he‚Äôs a low tier killer but he‚Äôs B tier for sure. 
---
Something I actually noticed is the recent killers get countered by no mither. Legion and plague
---
yeah, if ranking was actually based on any sort of skill. You can hit rank 1 in this game by just simply playing. That's why towards the mid\end of each month Red ranks are littered with awful players that you wonder why and how in the fuck are they at Rank 1, 2, 3 etc...  
---
The people who would likely be True Rank 1 level players if this game had any sort of real MMR system, they're the ones back at Rank 1 by the end of the first day of rank reset
---
Because, contrary to the circle jerk, freddy isnt a bad killer. Plague is kind of meh, hag is really damn good, and Wraith is also meh but his addons make him somewhat decent.
---
not the hero we deserve.
---
2 years in and im still loving it 
---
Jimmy looking like he has been looped for 14 minutes
---
Ive played all these killers multiple times, and I main Freddy. He's better than the circlejerk would have you believe. Clown is really bad against smart survivors that know not to loop him, and Trapper takes too much time to set up with little reward.
---
Thats why you dont loop him lmao, you camp pallets. Did you not read what I said?
---
Yes, but most survivors are always looking around them, because of Michael, The Pig, and...well, the Wraith. If you have a map like Ironworks? Beautiful, wondrous, best thing ever. Coldwind? Throw in the towel, most the time.
---
Delete this. 
---
"Louis, I'm gonna sink that boat just to make you SAD."
---
My personal favorite.
---
No
---
He is not.
---
I wish there were dances so I could BM more. I want a twerk animation because violently crouching just isn't the same. 
---
Howmst the fuck you get such clean lines with filling it in ? Like what did you do first draw the outline of the dwight first ?
---
I didn't play her, I only watched so I'm not sure exactly what to make out of it but if I had to guess she'd be in Myers-clown tier. I think she's worse than Myers but flip flops with clown 
---
I always thought Huntress was a Mama
---
 I just wanted to address freddy first, as that if the most obvious difference from other tier lists.
---
&gt;  my good sir.
---
lol
---
Bring on the downvotes because "fedora man bad, clown good"
---
Good survivors will be able to loop with enough time anyway, due to how short gen times are.
---
I mean, he had SO much potential in the various things he could do, and yet he ended up doing none of them...  
---
  
---
The way I would have thought was that it could take a while and various power uses to put someone to sleep, but once you did it would be harder or impossible to wake up, and you would have special traps and stuff to use in the dream world to slow down, injure, or trap survivors.  
---
So many possibilities for original content, cool looking traps, and powers, all wasted.
---
Probably because they are representatives of the community and the game and people expect them to act that part. Maybe because you get trash talked in front of a big audience? Or because, if playing with a stream with an audience (not your usual XYZ.ttv wannabe) you might end up getting doxed over it, as by the nature of how streaming works their viewers see your handle, and if the streamer hates on you there is bound to be at least a handful of sad losers who think that shit makes them a hero in their starlets eyes (i mean just look how many bigger streamers/youtubers aks end up asking others not to bully people being rude to them (or to whom they have been rude). That shit realy happens. Dont underestimate the obsessive creepyness of socially inept basement dwelling nobodies.
---
But its probably for the most part reason 1.
---
If this is practicality, then I do think Clown and Plague should be higher
---
I wouldn't say The Clown is underpowered... It's just that he's fundamentally flawed. His power enables him to end chases a little faster but that's about it. He has no map presence so the other 3 survivors can work on gens without any threats while he's chasing another survivor. 
---
I love the clown, and I play him a fair amount.  I think he‚Äôs rarely seen due to him being not new anymore, so you‚Äôll see more spirits and legions.   Also, his power isn‚Äôt too exciting. You throw gas bottles. And the M1.  No bells or whistles. It‚Äôs pretty straight forward and lacks the pizzazz of other killers that people are drawn to. 
---
I mean, eat pallets, shut down windows, catch people in the open, use add-ons / throw at gens to remove their sprint burst.
---
He's not amazing, but he's totally fine at what he does.
---
I hate to say it but I feel a lot of Killer concepts would be very cool if SWF just wasn't a thing anymore. A lot more things would be cool if SWF wasn't a thing. I just feel this game wasn't mafe to technically have completely accurate communication between players. Yes it's nice to have friends to play with but there are way more fitting games to hang out in a group in. 
---
God I hate the clown. 
---
yikes I mean killers are in a pretty powerful state at the moment when SWF aren't involved but any more survivor nerfs and honestly RIP survivor mains lmfao
---
That's what is good about Nurse - she's crazy OP, but not without a counterplay
---
Laurie is debatable. 
---
Facts. 
---
I play about 3 games a month nowadays for the same reason. The assholes just take any fun out of it. You play survivor, get facecamped, play killer get teabagged, or even if you 4k without using scummy tactics, half the time survivors will still bitch you out in chat. It doesn't happen every time, but often enough to where you would just rather play something else. 
---
Clown I dont think is good due to his gimmick essentially being slow down and that's it. If they camp the pallet your power is nullified so when you break it, they run to another. His power does nothing else either.
---
Plague has chase and a bit of tracking, granted shes much better than clown and an argument can be made for being better than pig, I don't feel as if she has enough stall or map pressure to be "top tier"
---
Lots of killers have near guaranteed deaths with add ons. Trapper has traps that inflict dying, huntress has insta down hatchets, unlimited evil within 3 for mikey, or being able to kill with bare hands at evil within 3, clown can make you exposed after hitting you with a bottle, cant think of any others but point is i dont think a near guaranteed death with add ons is unfair.    But you are right about the camping, i would just camp whilst crouch a hooked survivor. Kre often if it worked like this. Pig could use some kinda add on buff tho
---
I gave up and uninstalled after infinite loading screen started happening every second game. I know a lot of people who moved on because of that shit, and devs are in no hurry to fix it. Unbelievable.
---
"Camping pallets" means absolutely nothing to the clown. Throw a bottle directly behind them and break the pallet. They have to run through gas to get to the next one, which means you're right up their ass and you're gonna get a hit... and if you're using spirit fury/enduring like you should be, IF they make it to the next pallet, it usually means they're dead.
---
Basic fucking clown mechanics, you're welcome.
---
Reddit is the absolute best 
---
Killer main here. Let me try to explain. Imagine you have four chicken nuggets. Eat all of them and you win a ice cream. You can at best eat them one at a time. Now imagine you pick one up and fumble it. Now proceed to fumble that chicken nugget, mid-air, REAPEATEDLY. for the next 4 to 5 minutes before dropping it down a sewer grate scented trash can, and when you look back one of your chicken nuggets blind you with a flashlight while the remain two jump off into the trash. And the last one stands there watching you from the edge of the trash and fucking trust falls into it. Also no ice cream.
---
Looking forward to my man's new look
---
isn't it just because that's the level one version?
---
boy that's the dumbest shit Ive read today
---
They are forced to eat through pallets sure, it doesnt matter, the gens will be done by the time the Clown has got through all of them. The only reason it is widely accepted that clown is good is because survivors refuse to adapt to him, and try to loop him like idiots.
---
At tier one it‚Äôs only effect is the mori
---
I find them great for being able to sleep someone in a chase without breaking it off. Blocks are useless against a group of people cause you aren‚Äôt going to hit all of them. They are great for sleeping people who you‚Äôd otherwise have to catch up with cause they decided to sprint burst super early and you‚Äôre pitiful default range isn‚Äôt enough. I don‚Äôt think blocks are bad, they just don‚Äôt have the utility range does.
---
Claudette: "I know where you live" 
---
I guess I'm bad at tracking too because I swear to god some survivors straight up disappear in thin air. Even if I look around the whole vicinity 3 times, still nobody around.
---
I don't entirely get this "Just camp pallets" strat that has begun to pop up recently vs. Clown. He's at his best and able to get hits other killers can't when he's slowing survivors who are transitioning from a used loop to a new one, not at using his bottle in a loop itself.
---
then play more Freddy, I think people play 1 or 2 games as Freddy get a 4K and say he‚Äôs not bad. Play with him consistently in low ranks, I find some games you‚Äôll just run into egotistical survivors that think they‚Äôre god because they‚Äôre playing against Freddy and they just play like shit and you 4K.
---
Freddy and Leatherface turn survivors into potato‚Äôs 
---
If they drop the pallet early, then that means your power is working. The Clown makes the survivors play in a way that drains pallets. 
---
Oh hey, it's the Bill guy again.
---
Doesn't leatherface *technically* have a mask?
---
Aaaand then pig becomes the best facecamper in the game.
---
Every single other chase based killer can counter this.
---
fake and
---
The issues I experienced were that nobody respects freddy and most just stay on gens until pretty much in the dream world. Honestly this works in my favor, because I never have a hard time finding anybody with Freddy. Also monitor and abusee is pointless to use on freddy for this reason, yet ppl claim it to be one of the best perks fro freddy. 
---
I think killers who do that have mental damage. 
---
Lmao love the meme
---
In always a potato against Freddy. I'm pretty sure my record is better against most other killers.
---
Nice. I‚Äôm on the same boat, except you have way more shards. I have enough to buy Jane and then have 4K shards left over for cosmetics.
---
Far different than Adrenaline.  Adrenaline is earned by survivors for efficiently completing their sole objective.  Killers receive NOED as a handout for failing to protect their objectives.  Adrenaline effect is single use lasting 5 seconds.  NOED is repeated use against all survivors indefinitely as long as the totem is up.  There is no comparison NOED is a far bigger crutch and it's used exclusively by weak killers to mask inability to multitask and chase intelligently OR solid killers who are just extremely lazy and want an easy safety net to guarantee an easy pip.
---
And by the time they've drained the pallets all the hens are done and he might get a 1k. 2k if the survivors are bumbling idiots.
---
I GRABBED A SURVIVOR OFF A HOOK BUT THE ANIMATION GOT CUTOFF MIDWAY THROUGH AND IT ENDED UP AS A NORMAL HIT
---
When they had ample time to do the last gen, but didn't? Oof, not me. 
---
It's sharp hand Joe.
---
I think it would be neat to incorporate something like the Doc's madness hallucinations, only have a selection of random dream horrors that could potentially crop up around people.
---
Have a fear level, similar to the Doc's madness level. Once pulled into the dream, fear begins to climb until the hallucinations start to appear. Early on, it could be tame-ish stuff: randomly see Freddy, randomly see phantom hooks with survivors on them. But once the fear starts to build up, start throwing in the crazier stuff like Worm Freddy, long-arms Freddy, etc. Get increasingly helpful notifications as the killer, and maybe even a Hag-like teleport to the location of an active hallucination. 
---
wait...Hag has eyeballs now???
---
I think you must have just been against either campers or noobs.  Or just idiots.
---
Yeah no shit the killer is supposed to be more powerful that the survivors. Ever seen a horror movie smh.
---
Damn Herman got that cake.
---
Pretty subjective.
---
Clown should be way higher. Spirit should switch with hag. Freddy all the way down. Wraith, and legion (sadly) should be higher. Idk about plague. I'd argue that huntress could be as good as spirit/billy but it's up to the addons I guess.
---
Correct, but you do get to play the game more with it than without it.
---
It's pretty objective. I love playing as clown yeti out him as the worst because he is.
---
Its the killer equivalent of teabagging at the gate, except unlike gate teabaggers these are relatively rare.
---
How is that any different from the Plague? 
---
Why should he have to be played like every other chase-based killer when folks making this argument also always make the argument that Freddy HAS to be played differently than everybody plays killer for him to be successful and clearly we all just don't "get it"?
---
&gt; They have to run through gas to get to the next one, which means you're right up their ass and you're gonna get a hit...
---
Gas wears off in 2 seconds, they will get to another pallet. If you repeat this process 3 more times your out of bottles, and a basic m1 killer. 
---
&gt; and if you're using spirit fury/enduring like you should be, IF they make it to the next pallet, it usually means they're dead.
---
Shouldnt have to use specific perks to make a killer good, and even then it wont work a lot of the time. People generally dont like to try to go for stuns on clown, they throw down the pallet early.
---
&gt; Basic fucking clown mechanics, you're welcome.
---
I'll admit I slash a survivor more than a couple times only after they've been toxic in some way (though not for minutes at a time, I leave afterwards). Usually I just gtfo from the hook area right after I hook someone.
---
Spirit isnt as good as hag, she cant teleport to traps and she cant end chases as fast.
---
Freddy has stall, tracking, and a bit of stealth.
---
Wraith and Legion are fine where they are IMO.
---
I think a lot of people who play this game have mental damage, to be frank.
---
The ever present Survivor's Guide to Killers: What to Do and Not to Do, the Killers' No Doing Anything Except Running into my Hatchet thing, the t-bagging, the camping, the "You have to give me hatch because I said so" thing.
---
It's like 90% of the playerbase wants you to play a certain way solely so they can rub your face in it, like children. I mean, it's all over the internet and internet gaming, but I've honestly never seen it *this* bad before.
---
Because hes one of the many chase focused killers and Freddys power is really unique in how it works?
---
This is without a doubt the most crybaby game I've ever played. It is still fun, but some of it is so tiring. 
---
Plague is ranged and can in general down quicker. Michael has stealth at the first two while being an M1 killer at tier 2 and has an instadown, a fuck ton of lunge, and fast vaults at tier 3. Basically he can snowball with his M1 instadown.
---
Doc's zap can be used to get free hits and so can Clown's slow, but neither are terribly flashy or enjoyable to use. Instead of having a power, they just kinda have a gimmick.
---
Nah I just put on lightborn and wallow in the free hits.
---
This is mostly what I see from any killer that's not the Nurse or Wraith, though. If you can get, as any killer, 8-10 hooks consistently, and nobody is able to adapt, they're not in a bad place. Theoretical mechanics don't matter too much at that point, IMHO.
---
Omg i kept waiting to see something happen. Assumed the Michael was plotting. I feel cheated. ü§¨
---
But he isnt
---
The point of her traps is not to kill the survivors. The point of them is to waste the survivor's time, and they are really good at that already. I think Pig is pretty good as she is. Sure she could do with some small addon buffs and perhaps some new addons that change how long/fast her dash attack is. Some of The Pig's addons are kinda pointless.

WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WITH THIS GAME FUCKING LAGGY KILLERS EVERY. FUCKING. WHERE. IN 2 DAYS AND 10 GAMES ME AND MY FRIEND HAVE HAD EXACTLY O N E NORMAL KILLER, EVEN THOUGH THE PING LOOKS NORMAL. EVEN I AM A FUCKING LAGGY KILLER NOW EVEN THOUGH I HAVE AWESOME INTERNET BHVR EXPLAAAIN :@ PREDICTIONS HAVE NOW CHANGED FROM MINDGAMES TO PREDICTING WHERE THE FUCK I'M GONNA TELEPORT TO NEXT SMH
---
Noed has nothing to do with playing bad. Even if you play well gens can still get done. 
---
I had rank 2 killer with one pip left logged on today got dropped back to 11. Fml
---
Yeah I just realized, but wiki shows otherwise. Thanks
---
No, not really, objecitve would be if you took a general consensus, this is all your opinion, which makes it nothing more than subjective. Sorry bud.
---
What? Then every tier list is subjective. 
---
It did for me!
---
So your basically saying clown is good because survivors are idiots?
---
Fair enough tbh. Its just against smart survivors (they exist I know) clown will get destroyed. Any killer gets destroyed against smart survivors really, but clown more than anyone else.
---
**We Walked**
---
üíÄüíÄüíÄ Yall got me DECEASED.
---
I don't get digital games because i fear forgetting my log in password and email. 
---
Yep.
---
BEST PLAN FOR SURVIVNG THE RIDICULOUS UNBALANCED MAP THE GAME IS TO MAKE SURE 2 GENS GET DONE AND THEN HIDE UNTIL YOU ARE THE ONLY 1 LEFT. IT IS THE EASIEST MAP TO FIND THE HATCH SINCE IT IS ALMOST ALWAYS ON THE LOWER LEVEL
---
115% killer downing everyone with one hit? Sounds good to me.
---
Well, cant say you're wrong.
---
Yes I‚Äôm tired of ruin because of work and school I don‚Äôt get to play much at all so I‚Äôm always in the lowest ranks possible where players bad/New players are 
---
We're fully agreed smart survivors dick on any killer.
---
I think most things in the game were designed for sub-optimal play and people panicking more than they do tbh.
---
Hag is B, Myers B, spirit A, plague A, Clown and doc both B, legion is F literally the worst killer without addons, freddy and leather face C, 
---
üòé
---
&gt;Hag is B
---
Wh-Excuse me?
---
Sure. That‚Äôs fair, but 5 seconds could make the difference if you‚Äôre trying to get out of a chase!
---
Time for franklin‚Äôs 
---
that's my penis in dick pics compared to real life
---
Easily offended shouldn't watch this.
---
I was waiting for their match to be over... But I still caught this gold
---
Hag should be A, that‚Äôs one of the few things right on your list üòâ
---
That skirt and her crop top is gonna be a big oof üòç
---
Not a lot of people play clown because they either find him boring or they don‚Äôt want to learn how to sue him, he takes a little while to get good at.
---
Yeah DBD was designed to be a casual game, and it shows to this day. It sucks, because it means that people who want to take this game seriously get dicked on bc of how dumb the balance is.
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS UP WITH THE LONG Q TIMES??? I PLAY KILLER OR SURVIVOR AND HAVE TO WAIT, RESET EVERYTHING AND STILL THE SAME! PLUS WITH RANK RESET THE 11 MATCHES IVE BEEN IN AS SURVIVOR HAVE BEEN A CAMP FEST 8 OUT OF THE 11 FUCK THESE PLAYERS ON PS4! 
---
yeah they can be unfun but killer addons can not be fun for survivors so does it not balance out funwise? I dont think you understand my point
---
On a full list of "chase focused" killers, depending on which killers you place in that bubble, I would imagine he would not compare favorably to the likes of Nurse or (a top-tier) Billy. However, to me, that still puts him around high B tier, probably a very small notch below Michael.
---
Killers like Wraith &amp; Pig are in a category (stealth-focused) that really only has it's uses against inexperienced survivors, imo. That automatically drops their usefulness down in my view. They're good for 1 hit and then have far less in their arsenal to end a chase than Clown does. I find it laughable at top ranks when I play against Pigs who think the dash mindgames are going to work on survivors.
---
SILENCE, POTATO
---
Better then I can do
---
Honestly I could stand a bit less of the grind.
---
I mean, I get where they are coming from, they want you to spend time getting each killer to a higher level to get experience with them and they want you to know how to use the perks for survivors.
---
But jesus christ I just want to play a specific build with a Killer I've never had an interest in before now without having to grind a cubic butt ton of blood points to finally get that one perk on a second killer that I've never had a use for before.
---
At rank 1 at least half the players are potatoes who dont belong there.
---
A good clown won't let you do loops without a.) getting hit or b.) using the pallet early. If you use the second strategy then you'll run out of pallets eventually (not to mention he slows vaults). Spirit has the best mind game potential and ends chases more consistently, imo. Hag takes time to set-up and can't do much if someone wastes her traps or knows how to play around them. She's better now compared to before though. Freddy is the easiest to abuse. It takes so much time to put someone to sleep and waking up is easy. He's also incredibly weak because his power doesn't help him catch survivors at all (you can see them, but can you reach them?) This is also the reason bubba isn't very great. Huntress has hatchets; nurse has blinks; legion has frenzy; etc. They have things to actively help them in a chase, compared to freddy who resorts to just mindgames/survivor mistakes/chasing until windows are blocked. Legion is broken right now with some addons so I won't say anything more about that. Wraith is actually decent now so I'd reckon he could go higher, but whatevs.
---
She isnt in the same tier as billy or spirit, those two alone are the only ones close to nurse. When making a tier list addons dont come into play, even if this was an addon list she isnt close to billy or spirit 
---
Case in point: there's no better explanation for Ebony Mori's tbh.
---
Glad we got through that one.
---
Steam achievements are pointless since you can just use SAM to unlock them.
---
And rank 1 is super easy to get if you play. Just go a gen and get an unhook and run the killer for a bit. Dont even have to survive.
---
&gt; I find it laughable at top ranks when I play against Pigs who think the dash mindgames are going to work on survivors.
---
They do, if you know that they like to run away from the loop when you crouch just crouch and uncrouch. It doesnt provide consistant hits but it does work.
---
This is a bit much, Freddy isn't hard to use to get at least a 2k every game
---
That‚Äôs not the point tho. The point is that new players should not be playing with people that has experience in this game, how good or bad you are at the game is not particularly relevant in this case. Having spent enough hours to achieve rank 1 gives you far more experience than a completely new player. 
---
Afterwards, with just a smidge of life left, the doctor did me a solid and picked me back up! Went after the nea and I took us both out! XD idc I‚Äôm glad that nea got her just desserts üç® üòÜ gosh it was funny! 
---
Well if it's possible to 4K in rank 1 with Freddy consistently, then Freddy is OK and just has a high skill ceiling like Nurse.
---
It's..... just like staring into a mirror.
---
Careful man. For when you stare into that mirror, that mirror also stares back into you.
---
And Pig's magically catching me faster than a Clown would while I run to the next pallet how, exactly?
---
Because camping pallets works. Clowns power doesnt do anything when you camp a pallet, forcing him to kick it, then the survivor can just head to another one. Once the Clown is out of bottles, the survivor can loop like normal.
---
I mean, ill literally get chased the whole game and do fine, but then I get downed, the noed exposed thing pops up, and everybody refuses to save me. Its all that effort for nothing, and I can't rely on my teammates to break the totems or break it when it activates, and I can't break it myself because I either can't find/break the totem and have to say screw it because I waste too much time or the killer finds me, or are the one getting chased and then the scenario above happens. It just...feels like so much bullshit. I don't want to be punished for playing good.
---
Stealth is getting you a free hit if the survivor in question is busy reading their Twitch chat or giggling with their SWF and not playing seriously, I guess? 
---
Faking for NOED perhaps. 
---
I keep getting this on the other side, I open a lobby and within ten seconds it's a constant rotation of Brazilian players entering, seeing 700 ping and leaving. I can't get other aus players cos the lobby is full of people who won't and can't play
---
"I don't make the rules, I just think them up and write them down" -Eric Cartman
---
I guess Legion would be the worst to me. Their power isn't all that great if a team is even kind of decent at the game in my opinion 
---
It‚Äôs a legit fucking waste but okay honey, you waste a perk slot if you want!
---
I hope he gets changed soon. Legion is horrible design for both survivors and killers. Completely unfun in every aspect.
---
Nothing beats the 3 blink nurse that I ran into and me and someone who also had the same Jeff cosmetic looped her for the entire game, THEN I load into my next game and the 3 blink nurse person is on my team as survivor. I think "Alright maybe they're a survivor main and just decided to do a killer for a daily." NO, this person is the definition of potato. This person was hooked and then proceeded to kill theirself on the hook before the first gen was done. I'd expect this if they were at rank twenty but  they were rank 10. Like wtf.
---
Killers already call Decisive Strike toxic
---
Yeah hate not getting any evader points when I actually spent the whole game evading the killer. 
---
I think you are missing the point
---
I love that you‚Äôre getting the upvotes but I got the downvotes ahaha. Fucking idiotic killer mains.
---
I play spirit a fair amount. I do love her mechanic. 
---
First things first, you don't need unrelenting. I'm honestly not sure why you have it on, you land most of your hits. That perk slot can better be used by nurses, bbq, or ruin. Super meta, but obviously very useful on spirit. Assuming you have them unlocked. If not, spirit fury is not bad at all, even better with enduring. And I'm not sure how you do in other matches, but if you play her that well every time I doubt you need noed. 
---
You mindgame with her really well, especially at pallets. I would have suggested checking gens more often, but you didn't have time in this match. 
---
For real advice, you should post a match where you don't do as well and aren't using addons that give such a big advantage. It's hard to give advice on a near perfect game.

---
Yeah, you should.
---
I screamed for you 
---
[removed]
---
I feel attacked
---
What is also petty is you not acknowledging the point and this has been your only takeaway, and the only reason I've been downvoting is out of disagreement.
---
Explain why freddy is not as bad. His restrictions makes him a really bad killer, I can tell they made for end game kills but end game is NOT designed for that
---
The funny part is that it's actually the other way around, and that's why a lot of FT13th fans were disappointed 
---
The best build for him is Enduring/Spirit Fury/Ruin/BBQ.
---
You can‚Äôt do anything about toxic survivors except ignore them. Gens getting completed too fast is because of your lack of pressure on the survivors. Even the best killers struggle with generators being completed, you can never stop it. You just get better at putting pressure on the gens.
---
In short. You just need to practice.
---
Time to criticize memes:
---
* Hag was kidnapped by cannibals as a kid before turning into what she is in-game, so it's unlikely that she had kids.
---
* Jeff designs beer labels and metal album covers. Doubt he's a good influence on kids.
---
* Nurse literally choked all her wards to death. I wouldn't leave my kids with her.
---
* Claudette and Jane can probably be moved up. Claudette is a caring University student (yes it is hard to believe) and Jane is fucking Oprah. Oprah would be an amazing babysitter.
---
* Trapper, Hillbilly, and Spirit are all deranged psychopaths with serious anger management issues. You could make the argument that Spirit pre-entity would be a great babysitter though.
---
* Dwight would probably be fine as a babysitter. He's a dweeb but he takes authority with pride and energy. He'd do his best to make sure all the kids were happy.
---
* See point about Trapper/Billy/Spirit for Clown. He's a sadist who keeps the finger of a kid he murdered in a cigar box.
---
* Feng would honestly probably be okay at babysitting. Like, the bad kind of okay, but still "okay." She's the kind of babysitter who turns on the XBOX and just tells the kids to fuck off and play CoD.
---
* Ace is a grampa with a gambling problem, but that being said he's got a great attitude and is always smiling. I don't know if he'd be great or awful, and by who's definition.
---
* Huntress loves to take care of kids she's just too stupid to know how to feed them. If she learnt that humans need fucking food and don't survive off Vodka alone then she'd probably be a great babysitter.
---
* O h n o, F r e d d y

üòçüòçüòç - Love, a Clown main
---
Oh yea that totally happens. If you know that they‚Äôre SWF then you know it‚Äôs always going to be harder than a normal game. But, you can do stuff to punish their communication if you predict their plan. Fake pick-ups and random direction changes stuff like that. And slugging w/deer stalker/nurses calling becomes insanely strong against flash light teams. It‚Äôs harder but can be more fun/rewarding when you‚Äôre able to punish! And I seriously have a hard time believing most SWF actively comminicate/strategize. I know it exists because I‚Äôve played against it many times but usually it seems like the SWF are just friends playing together, maybe in voice comms but prolly noy strategizing
---
The entity is displeased 
---
ok? Get caught near the end then. This situation is pretty one off and you should just take it as it being what it is. You don't HAVE to leave and it is just a perk. Get the totems before you get into a ''full game chase, every single game to the point where you deathly have an issue with noed because EVERY SINGLE killer runs it''. This is not the case so lets not be so upset over a perk that only some people use.
---
Because the game is essentially over. Even if you were to unhook yourself, the killer would just down you again.
---
Well that‚Äôs like, your opinion, man
---
Can't tell if ur trolling or bad
---
Downvoting people for disgrement, what a fucking baby 
---
I don‚Äôt play clown just because he‚Äôs not fun to me. He‚Äôs a scuffed version of huntress. If I‚Äôm gonna throw stuff at survivors, I want to at least damage them.
---
Also, I‚Äôve yet to see any killer make a clown stick out. I‚Äôve seen plenty of good killers play good clown games, but no clown mains to make him pop.
---
Gettin a lil too close to our turf dwight cultist!
---
I‚Äôm a noob too though - less than half a week. I‚Äôm so bad at killer that I‚Äôve never hooked anyone to know if they get blood points for slashing a hooked victim, but a friend said they didn‚Äôt.  And camping in one thing I understand somewhat, but being out in the open in front of the victim seems silly. So maybe a mix of campers and idiots.
---
Clown is pretty boring gameplay wise, and while he's effective at what he does that's pretty much all you can do with him. There's no built-in map pressure, tracking, or stalling just chasing so there isn't much depth to using his kit beyond equip Ruin/Whispers/BBQ&amp;C etc.
---
I hate when people teabag at the gate! I‚Äôve been hurt and struggling and a tea baggers gets in my way more than once. 
---
End game isnt even that great for Freddy. Mid game is where its at for him. People think that end game is good for Freddy, because you generally see Freddys using NOED blood warden and the such, whereas good Freddys can stall so much that the end game wont even happen. Freddy isnt meant to tunnel, hes meant to keep as many survivors in Dream World as possible, switch targets constantly and make use of his small height to have good m1 mindgames.
---
This steam guide can explain freddys strengths better than I can: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1628612661
---
Or if you want to talk to some people who are masters at Freddy, join this discord, its a teaching server for all killers and survivors:  https://discord.gg/r4KTbua
---
Its just that, people saY, "Do totems lol" but I cant. And I still lose. Becuase nobody saves me cause they are scared of NOED. That or I get facecamped because the killer chased me the whole game. That's the problem with noed. It rewards bad plays, and screw over those who play good, just because they try their damndest to survive
---
Cool.
---
yep everytime its the same exact response with everyone, just buy it, its only the price of a coffee, quite being cheap or whatever. Not like you don't spend money to buy the game upfront or anything right?
---
Can we please not forgot that originally double dipping was not the norm and there was generally 1 payment method you interacted with instead of 3.
---
Not the hero we need or want either. In fact, calling him a hero is a huge stretch
---
This is the most wholesome, adorable post I‚Äôve seen in a while. OP‚Äôs responses add to the sheer innocence of it all. 
---
So, they‚Äôre probably new, like yourself. My guess is that they‚Äôre overly joyed that they caught someone and don‚Äôt want to let you go. It‚Äôs camping and it‚Äôs a pretty shitty thing to do. Most new killers camp like crazy, and you‚Äôll gave to grin and bear through these messy times. 
---
Some newer players think that if they slash you on the hook, you‚Äôll die faster. I don‚Äôt know why they think this at all. 
---
Most killers are dicks at low ranks. They have the ultimate ‚Äúthey‚Äôre all out to get me‚Äù mentality and will bad manners (bm) you while you‚Äôre on the hook. 
---
New killers aren‚Äôt good at chases/spotting survivors. They‚Äôll hang around because hooked survivors are like lamps to moths. The slashes might be to entice others to come and play because it might get people all riled up. 
---
Kudos on you though for wondering what‚Äôs going on and not having an adverse reaction to this.  You‚Äôre not doing anything wrong and, in my mind, are allowed a little tea bag at the gates if you ever get off the hook and escape. 
---
Giving the killer a disguise ability could work out if he has a secondary ability and/or benefits to being a survivor.
---
Off the top of my head some ideas come to mind. If the ability doesnt have a really bad transition phase, he can get close to survivors with no heart beat, he can have third person view which could be useful at ambushing along with the no heartbeat, he could have a speed burst similar to wraith when he gets out of his disguise, he could give "exposed" to survivors in a 12 meter radius if he manages to trick them for long enough, etc.
---
An idea I have for a passive ability if thyere still considered weak: each time you disguise, you get a "corrupted" survivor perk passive that changes each time you disguise (this perk would carry over when you aren't disguised, it just switches each time you disguise), some examples: "leader" could make every survivor in your terror radius get a 25% decrease to every action (except gens), "empathy"  could reveal an injured survivors location to you for 3 seconds, "sprint burst" could increase your lunge range and lunge speed, "saboteur" can make generators you kick regress at 2 or 3x faster. 
---
Point is, a killer who transforms into a survivor can work if the ability provides more benefits then just "I look like that guy".

---
You're right though; I should revise my statement :P
---
Was down when I first launched the game, but I think they're back up.
---
I uninstalled last night after getting 3 SWFs in a row that teabagged and blinded at every pallet. Several of those players were streamers.
---
I'm probably going to come back at some point, but right now the choice is between gritting my teeth, getting more skilled, and learning to ignore the toxic players, versus doing *literally anything else*.
---
You really don‚Äôt, trust me. It‚Äôs the most god awful SWF experience you can possibly have. 
---
I actually noticed that in the last week or so...
---
Looks more like Kate tbh
---
...excuse me?üòÇüòÇ
---
Oof
---
I look at it everytime and can only think of spaghetti.
---
Admittedly, I haven't even glanced at the store in the Ptb. I stand by my original statement that a blanket "girls with thick things always have noticeable belly and chin fat" isn't accurate though. Also, to be fair, all of DbD's character models look kinda alien ish to me. 
---
They are amazing
---
I found the toxic person 
---
You might wanna reformat
---
I'm sure he's probably sprung for an 888 by now. 
---
Yeah, some seem to take this game too seriously. I‚Äôm having a nice time (for now - I just started) regardless of whether I survive, though I do try my best to survive and help others. I like when people who help me get away safely. I was pleasantly shocked when a killer dropped me by the hatch and another let me crawl through the opening. Though I think I may have been too far from a hook for him to hook me and that‚Äôs why he dropped me at the end. 
---
But it requires no investment on their part to weigh the shrine, im not talking about some grand conspiracy, it literally just a case that License Killer Perk have a lower chance of showing up on the shrine then other killers because it then encourages people to have to throw direct money into the game. I do wonder how many LF sets were brought 90% because of needing BBQ.
---
Even if its not weighed its kinda a crappy system them, why not have it being RNG weighed so the less a perk shows up on the shrine the higher the probability it should get selected. Resetting once it shows up on the shrine, done, now a perk not showing up for 3 years if far rarer. 
---
Mine is down right now
---
I agreed with you before i watched this vid but i actually dont mind this one, the rabbits hanging from the belt is a nice touch.
---
On console, any killer is viable at rank 1 (except Nurse due to hardware limitations and turning speed caps). Perks hardly matter, if you are remotely skilled at all, you are better than 95% of players because the majority are very.. bad. If you can work around people exploiting the frame rate (360s) and hit them then you will always win.
---
I cannot for the life of me understand this level of pettiness. It's like shooting yourself in the foot to get bloodstains on my dry clean only shirt, like wtf?
---
Tum-Tums. 
---
Y'know, Leatherface. :D
---
Wtf is that name. üòÇ
---
big oof
---
&gt; other killers have nowhere near as many issues
---
I'd take a legion rework over a freddie rework any day of the year.
---
Neil Armstrong and Michael Jackson would like some words with you. 
---
Even billy? I don‚Äôt think so
---
Make a Ranked mode that you can't do SWF with really high rewards and even cosmetic chests every now and then.
---
I'd argue the fun factor, though. For me, the chase can be a literal drag, no matter who I play. I like feeling like I have some merit of control, and a lot of killers feel so... Helpless.   
---
Freddy is the EXACT opposite. With him, I feel like I determine a lot more of the game.   
---
If I am not actively hunting you, then you are either trying to fail a skill check or ignore it all together. I know where you all are, almost all of the time even, so the pressure is constantly on for survivors.   
---
With Freddy, I at least directly feel my impact on the game, where with other killers I may barely even notice until my power comes into play. Freddy has a direct rewarding feel, you instantly see what you did go into effect and the game slows because of it, so in that sense I would say he is rewarding and fun, more so than you seem to believe at least. 
---
Yes.
---
Not only that, it would be very difficult to balance. Imagine for a moment that there is indeed a shapeshifting killer that works with you on generators. Can he grab you? Or if someone is on the hook and notices a "survivor", can you "save" your hooked survivor? Is there a heartbeat or a terror radius? What about chases, can a disguised survivor pre-emptively drop pallets?
---
No no not at all!  It is a legit question.  I was just agreeing with the other commenter about the general state of the game.  :)
---
Steam Achievement Manager
---
they didn't just yet.
---
hold tight BROTHERRRR
---
Yes. Does this mean they are doing an update?
---
Thank you!!
---
Hopefully ochido wasn't watching him
---
Surprising nobody, Behavior's next update is placing totems directly on the survivors. I should have read the patch notes for the PTB 
---
Truly amazing. I always love fan music for any game at all
---
I thought of this concept and I just think of an idea where the killer looks different in everyone's eyes 
---
Hag ain't s tier 
---
From what I've seen so tru3's gameplay plague is solid a tier
---
Try civ 5 I hear it‚Äôs a fun game.
---
Nea isn‚Äôt on this list 
---
Ah, I see. So basically if they‚Äôre trolling you which makes sense. Also, teabagging behind pallets seems way too risky unless they‚Äôve been playing a long time. I can see how a quick slash is justified if they‚Äôre actively trying to make you mad.
---
Yea. Was just able to log in. Guess they were down. 
---
Good for him! 
---
You play survivor right? Do you like to be aggressive and try to waste the killers time or do you enjoy trying to stay hidden and quiet? 2 very different and very valid playstyles.
---
lol, IDK. 
---
I probably picked it up from some DbD streamer, but it's my favorite nickname for him. :)
---
Yup. It makes it so hard when you're not in a party with the other survivors. It's so obvious as killer when the other survivors are all in the a party together. It makes a massive difference to be able to communicate. I really think the devs should implement in game voice chat. 
---
"DON'T DREAM AND GEN RUSH!"
---
&gt;From what I've seen of tru3's gameplay
---
That's your problem. You trust tru3 for your tier lists.
---
Level up Nea to unlock Urban Evasion. Next, choose Claudette to be your main. Equip self care, urban evasion, and whatever else you want. Boot up the game and proceed to crouch in dark corners. Work on enough generators to have two finished. Hopefully, others have done this for you. Stop what you are doing and hide in the shadows. Wait for the rest of the team to die and find hatch. 
---
Congratulations, you‚Äôre now a seasoned vet. 
---
That would make a lot of sense! I though I saw 'killer' on the first box and then 'survivor' on the second, but I'm probably just braindead!
---
I‚Äôve noticed this too and I‚Äôm on Xbox

Probably not the type you're looking for, but don't get into arguments with people who are trying to start one. It just makes the game stressful if you focus on it. Though it's not too often that I see stuff like that 
---
Yeah the game forces you to suicide, but it doesn't make sense. Why can't survivors in the dying state automatically bleed out if they're the last one and the hatch hasn't spawned? If the killer can slug me and watch me bleed to death just to be an ass and waste my time, I should be able to sit on the hook for 2 minutes as the last survivor to do the same thing back to them 
---
Thanks!

From what I'm seeing it's mostly people complaining about clown being low and freddy being high. I'm all for jokes but it seems that most people who are pissed off about this list aren't joking
---
I guess that's true.  But I still sort of agree with your friend!

---
Same reason survivors tea bag.... to be assholes 
---
Cause console players are like really dumb sometimes and create a war on reddit over an incorrect tier list. Have you played every killer? 
---
nothing, its risk reward
---
Usually try to stay hidden and quiet
---
PC players are really dumb sometimes too? It's not exclusive to console. You cant be this dense right? Also yes I have and have seen gameplay of Plague.
---
Oh word?
---
So you can just make everyone one shot if you don‚Äôt collect pools?

if you want yeah

is this the new wraith skin?

if you want, yeah

Hello

We need "I HATE MEMES"

Dope post history

I‚Äôd just by the dlc and get her and Jane it‚Äôs cheaper and it‚Äôs 6 decent to great perks total. And you save $2 then. 
---
My boi Dwight getting some of the spotlight! Nice art üëç
---
Basically tuft removes the over time drain but the tombstone piece just sets you back to tier two regardless of how much time you have left so with the combo you get an infinite time to find a survivor with jt bu you still drop to tier 2 on using the piece
---
?
---
this style is good fun and when i'm having a good art day i can knock one of these out and time flies! i hope y'all enjoy it as much as i enjoyed making it. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
also, after someone observed that my bloody Claudette made them hate Claudettes just a little bit more, i totally leaned into the "toxic" expression with this one. just a little bit. d:

---
Never knew how this combo works! TIL, thanks to you guys!
---
Thanks!  I would try to make one for the others, but I'm not sure how I'd go about it for most of them. 
---
Wow. That really sucks. Even without a No Escape build?! Wish my traps could hold on for that long without Fastening Tools! 
---
The Thing - can consume and make an exact copy of survivors, would be so cool 
---
Not often.
---
Ok some great perks for that style are Urban Evasion (Nea Karlson perk), iron will (Jake park perk but currently available in the shrine), sprint burst (Meg Thomas) and Self Heal (Claudette). 
---
To get better at the beginning, don‚Äôt be afraid of the killer, watch some videos on looping and how to evade the killers and what each specific killer does. It‚Äôs quite a big learning curve but a lot of fun once you get a hang of it :)
---
To be fair, it could make Squadette games a little interesting... but there's about a. 001% change that quad outfit matches claudette aren't in a swf. 
---
No, once they‚Äôre all corrupted, they all reset.
---
The Face
---
I‚Äôm fucking crying at this comment
---
I thought that 096 would have a cool face mechanic like he does in SCP Secret Laboratory 
---
It's so bad. She needs variety
---
Feng should be a rat, she is small and squeaky like one.
---
Haven‚Äôt played it can you fill me in
---
mint rag myc is amazingly bullshit &amp; its great
---
This is BHVR, so you would disguise as any survivor not currently in the match, have a terror radius, not be able to drop or vault pallets, and possibly still have a red stain.  In return, you can charge a survivor in a straight line for about 2 feet, no turning.  But! You'll have an add-on that cranks your movement speed up to 135%, and just brushing a survivor will down them. 
---
Right? Can us Kate mains get some goddamn variety?
---
My guess is that the devs had a different concept for Legion, but for one reason or another scrapped it late and settled on the half baked Feral Frenzy. 
---
Myers is not A tier lmao. People have such a hard on for Myers and idk why. He‚Äôs dog shit.
---
Yeah no, I don't buy it for a second. I even agree that killers are just on the edge of op (they have the clear advantage outside of swf, and even against swf the swf actually need to be good) but that's not why they are DCing.
---
It's like when someone DCs against me, I make fun of them after the game, and their friends tell me they had to "go to bed" or "their parents told them to come to dinner." Yeah I totally believe that somehow it was so pressing that you quit right at that moment and not before and not five seconds after.  Oh and you just happen to have a purple flashlight...
---
Basically if you look at his face, he cries for a few seconds and than goes berserk for some time 
---
This IS epic
---
There are some maps I can't track for shit. I want to cry when I get family residence as the nurse or the huntress.
---
I fear no man but that fact ... it scares me.
---
I think I'm lucky because I never ran into that and most Legions I face tunnel the people they find first but damn. 
---
BTW, not to sound dumb but did they buff Whispers somehow because I remember barely anyone used it for a while and recently I saw many people talk about it??
---
Doesn‚Äôt that make it attack if you see it‚Äôs face
---
As a killer, if I'm not going for a daily ritual/achievement, I'll just fuck around once somebody insta-DCs.
---
I've played survivor before where some asshat gets downed within a minute and just DCs, and it sucks for the remaining survivors. The DC basically just gave the killer a free Mori and now the remaining 3 are basically facing an uphill battle against any competent killer.
---
So now whenever I enter a match and see it's a 3v1, I normally just let go of M1 and just lay traps or stalk only.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm not discouraged though - I just wait for the next match! Sometimes I feel like I need urban dictionary to understand half of what my bf (who plays online a lot) says. Right now, it‚Äôs fun. When it‚Äôs not, I‚Äôll go back to the single player games in my backlog. Even when hooked, I don‚Äôt mind too much though I feel like I let the team down. Most online games seem to be FPS, which I‚Äôm dreadful at! I like that this is an online game I can survive in about half the time. 
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt understand why Dwight is mediocre and Jeff high up. Dwight is a nerdy leader. I think he will fit in well with the kids and play video games with them and bring pizza. Kids will love him. 
---
And if he needs to be strict he would be strict with the kids. 
---
CAN I LIVE FOR ONE GAME!? THE LAST 15 OR SO GAMES IVE BEEN FUCKING TUNNELED AND MORI‚ÄôED IM SICK OF THIS FUCKING GAME AND IM MOST LIKELY GOING TO DELETE IT, FUCK THESE BUGS AND FUCK BARBECUE AND CHILI! IM DONE. 
---
Sleepy Boi isn't a rat; he's an emergency medkit wielding, speedy gate opening, faster exhaustion recovering hero!
---
As for Nea, she's a cat. Not a rat.
---
This dude would probably love no blink nurse. She's the only killer slower than the survivors.
---
Just start hitting the dark corners around you, you're sure to hit wild Claudette. 
---
decided to play again after multiple months break (and even back then i barely played)
---
first game: was going fine at first, suddenly survivors started blocking for each other and then all d/c before i got to hook em which i had to do for ritual, as if they knew i had to get hooks.
---
second game: apparently a full swf and all are a hundred times better than me. keep looping me, decisive strike me, block everything they possible could and when i finally get one he ofc disconnected.
---
so im still sitting here, with 0 sacrifices done after 2 games because matchmaking decided to put a noob lvl 12 killer against survivors that are playing like red ranks. allready considering dropping it again lol.
---
DONT WORRY IM STUCK AT RANK 12 NOW BECAUSE EVERY FUCKING KILLER HAS TO TUNNEL ME, I PLAYED FOR FOUR HOURS TONIGHT, AND I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD THREE OF THOSE FOUR HOURS WAS JUST ME GETTING TUNNELED RIGHT OFF THE BAT AND THEN SPECTATING I WISH EVERY TUNNELING ASSHOLE WOULD DELETE THE GAME AND LEAVE
---
Problem is that killers are extremely strong against 4 solo queue players, but a 4 stack swf with voice comms that are deliberately not in the game (hence perks like kindred, empathy, blackout etc existing) mops the floor with killers. Makes Dark Sense a "buy one get three free" perk, makes Adrenaline extremely powerful, allows you to always be efficient by sending only one person to unhook without needing Kindred, and gives a whole hell of a lot of free information that doesn't exist in solo queue.
---
That is the single most horrifying and hilarious thing I have seen today.
---
Thank you.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the fact some survivors who have mostly 1000 hours into the game purposely stays at rank 10-15 just to bully killers for not getting any kills 
---
That's got to be the best damn [P3 FILTHY SURVIVOR TRASH] I've ever seen

please use the correct terminology. Instead of saying "I main Nea and Quentin" try using "I main King Rat and Queen Rat"

Sure, but he is really weak. Why nerf him?

ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO SAY RUIN IS GONE IN 30 SECONDS ARE LYING, I CAN NEVER FIND THE HEX WHEN I NEED IT AND WE END UP ALL DYING TRYING TO FUCKING FIND IT BUT INSTEAD FINDING THRILL OF THE HUNT
---
I SUPPORT THIS
---
can you not be banned for using macros? that's the only reason i haven't set one up for my controller, carpal tunnel + rapid-pressing A is a pain in the ass.
---
freddy too
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You can usually tell who has adrenaline by the way they play at lower gen counts. Oh, a Meg is getting in my face bodyblocking and teabagging with one gen left? That's a fast way to get ignored for me.
---
Was thinking exact same thing I almost always see wraiths and Michaels running Noed for some reason 
---
The worst part is you can get two kills by facecamping then downing someone else with a gen or two left at rank one. Sometimes you will even get an idiot who blindly farms hooks without BT. Easiest on someone like clown where they can't escape you. Add in NOED to waste their time enough for second person to die or get other free downs. It's disturbing. You often can't even pip off of it because you didn't heal, unhook, or be chased.
---
Cold dirt to add more salt into the game 
---
IF I'M BLATANTLY TRYING TO CARRY YOU TO THE HATCH, *STOP WIGGLING*. I'VE PASSED BY 4 HOOKS: IF I WANTED YOU DEAD, YOU WOULD BE.

It's a reference to the Diablo Immortal fiasco. They announced a "fun for the whole family" mobile game to a crowd expecting information on the next PC release.

---
You rock! Cancel that.
---
Wait.. wrong sub
---
Gonna say it.... get good. Every killer has weaknesses and strengths. And in some cases. Only weaknesses (Freddy). So learn them
---
This is perfection. 
---
DID YOU KNOW IF THE KILLER HITS THE SURVIVOR WITH BT ON, IT COUNTS AS A FREE PROTECTION STACK FOR YOU? 
---
BEING UNABLE TO THOROUGHLY PUNISH A FULL TEAM OF SFW FLASHLIGHTING TEABAGGERS AS KILLER SUCKS ACTUAL ASS.  
---
I NEED TO GET GOOD. 
---
Why would you save a 25k daily and not just blow it on something and get at least a 30k?
---
Smart Myers
---
Played huntress today against some SWF with flashlight dead hard, DS and all the usual stuff, I main survivor but wanted to play a bit of killer to slowly grind my huntress to 30.
---
They kept on flashlighting me, sabotaging hook and looping me constantly, I didn't camp/tunnel them for that as I don't like that style of gameplay, one of them tried to bodyblock me/dead hard escape constantly but failed and died super early.
---
After a while a managed to sacrifice a 2nd one, they have two gen to do and when one is looping me the other is being the gen jockey, they managed to finish the last 2 gen and I finally manage to hook one I go check which exit door are open and on my way back I spot the last one going for the unhook, threw an axe across the map to down the last one since they never healed since the 2v1 started.
---
Pretty clutch game and I'm pretty sure that if they didn't spend alot of their time trying to 3 man chase/bodyblock/flashlight with the classic T-bagging behind pallet meme me early they could have won. I have 12h~ as killer (45h total) and was pleased with how I managed to get a 4k against a premade that was decent. Got called baby killer and shat on post game and they commented on how "bad" I was when they lost alot of precious time early to taunt me since they were in fact better than me, alot of it came down to how cocky and how risky they played and how it costed them 2 survivor early.
---
on the other hand I got a decent game tho were people commended my playstyle (always going for unhooker and if I lose they unhooker not tunneling the injured one and just going for gen pressure) that wasn't as satisfying gameplay wise but I still had a better experience then.
---
Saltyness from survivor that lose when they though it would be an easy game is really strong, It was a fun 1st reset day for me, even tho I got destroyed in every single survivor game I played
---
ah okay, I'm sorry then. Yeah, players there do not deal with Ruin well.
---
OR WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT TWO PEOPLE RUNNING SABOTEUR MEANS YOU LITERALLY CANT HOOK A SURVIVOR UNLESS THE SABO'ERS ARE ALREADY ASLEEP
---
No, he's obviously Jeff Metal
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it man. 
---
...THIS IS NOT HARD TO FIGURE OUT. THEY WERE DEATH HOOK WHEN THE GATES WERE OPENED AND GOT A FREE ESCAPE
---
TRY PLAYING KILLER FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE
---
My first survived match was against doctor. Two people disconnected and one died before I thought it was safe to save her. I somehow did all the generators and escaped even though my experienced friend said it was hopeless. Or maybe he was guarding a hatch often because he stayed on one half of the map. I think he‚Äôs fun to play against, though I literally screamed the first time when my character screamed! Pig with her headtraps is worse for me (though I‚Äôve never been killed due to one; I‚Äôd kinda like to see it). Your character is designed to play like that, so I‚Äôm not sure what they expected you to do. 
---
As a new player it's the worst when this happens because you feel completely powerless. Had a couple games like these recently and since I'm a survivor main with less than 15h as a killer it feels extremely frustrating and I end up not even wanting to play for that trial 
---
I RUN NOED TOO SPECIFICALLY FOR PUNISHING SURVIVORS. IT'S SO DAMN SATISFYING DOWNING A TEABAGGER IN ONE HIT AT THE EXIT GATE! SURVIVORS THAT WHINE AND BERATE KILLERS ABOUT NOED ALSO DESERVE AN INSTADOWN!
---
NEA AND I WERE THE ONLY TWO LEFT ALIVE. I UNHOOKED HER OUT OF BASEMENT WHILE THE TRAPPER WAS PATROLLING. THEY SLUGGED ME TO CHASE NEA. POOR GIRL WAS TWO FEET FROM ESCAPING WHEN SHE WAS DOWNED. AFTER SHE WAS HOOKED, I HIT THE DS AND ESCAPED AS THE ONLY SURVIVOR.
---
Like the Thing.
---
I was with you until step 3. Thanks for the salt.
---
Damn right.
---
Then everyone would only play the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù survivor. And even if they limited it to one specific survivor per team, then what happens if somebody only has perks on Claudette but they‚Äôre already taken? It just doesn‚Äôt work well with how the game is already set up. 
---
I just buy the auric cells because I only play killer so it doesn‚Äôt make sense the buy the survivor.
---
PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT ME USING OP CRUTCH PERKS WHEN I USE PERKS LIKE NURSES, DEERSTALKER, DISCORDANCE, OR BLOODHOUND.
---
Its optional because my friends hate legion I personally would never report someone for that but they get mad and threaten to report but hey I don't get mad because I always dc against legion. 
---
had that with an ace i stabbed recently
---
WHY DO THEY GIVE KILLERS FUCKIN PERKS ITS SO UNFAIR! I'M 46 YEARS OLD GETTING MAD AT A VIDEO GAME, MY PRIORITIES ARE STRAIGHT MOTHERFUCKER!
---
Seriously, that dude needs to stop, get some help.
---
LEVELLING BUBBA WAS PROBABLY THE WORST EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD IN DBD. IT WAS A HUGE INVESTMENT IN A KILLER I DIDNT ENJOY AS EITHER SIDE JUST TO GET HIS INSANE PERKS.
---
I HATE RANK REGRESSION DAY, EVERYTHING IS MESSY AND I HATE IT. WHY IS IT A THING! I NEED A GOOD REASON SO I CAN STOP HAVING RAGE!
---
Is this irony?
---
Yeah.. why is there a legion in that game.
---
I run bond so I can call people out for doing things like crouching, hiding in lockers, and generally being useless when the killer isn't around. 
---
I don't regret this. 
---
*NANOMACHINES*
---
You dont need bloodlust for that very unsafe pallet really :(
---
This is why killers tunnel/mori streamers. More often than not, they deserve it.
---
Not often, because they ‚Äúmess with the blood point economy‚Äù. You know, because the game isn‚Äôt grindy for new players or anything /s
---
&gt;Y'all need *bing bong*
---
Yes and THATS why she has a creepy school girl outfit &gt;:|
---
No, BHVR are the assholes for not fixing it. Maybe dedicated servers will. I'm not holding my breath.
---
NO, I USUALLY DON'T RUN WE'RE GONNA LIVE FOREVER BECAUSE I STILL NEED TO GET ADAM'S 'NOT TODAY' ACHIEVEMENT. 
---
I WILL KEEP THIS IN MIND THOUGH, THANK YOU!
---
All my mains in the middle D:
---
MAN FUCK THE HATCH. JUST CAUSE I CAN KILL 3 OF YOUR TEAMMATES WHILE YOU DO 2 GENS MEANS YOU GET TO ESCAPE? FUCK YOU WHAT ABOUT ALL MY WORK 3 HOOKING THE OTHER SURVIVORS? JUST REMOVE IT ALREADY. OR AT LEAST LET ME CLOSE IT IF I FIND IT FIRST
---
Meanwhile I have resilience and dead hard, and it's annoying when people sit there tea bagging for 20 seconds trying to get me off the gen to be healed when they could've gotten on the gen and finished it with me. If you are ignored for more than the time to complete a late skill check, they don't want to be healed. Move on or get on the gen
---
The fuck does that even mean lmao. I swear reddit killer mains get dumber by the day
---
He should've been a stealth killer that lured in survivors by pretending to be one (like the trailer). But we got a power that feels like they tried to recreate nurse and failed.
---
The plague should be higher in my opinion
---
This is why I'm waiting for dedicated servers :(
---
These charts always crack me up...keep em coming!
---
Same lol
---
Note that there is an inclusion of add-ons, but their base-power matters more than their add-ons, the reason Legion and Trapper are in the "XD-tier" is because of how much they can fluctuate, Legion is A-tier with Frank's Mixtape + Cold Dirt, and C-tier without add-ons, whilst trapper is also a lot stronger with a bag + a boost to setting time. 
---
Also Doctor wouldnt even be able to be on this list without add-ons. 
---
You are the true hero here. I want to heroic like that but i disabled my messages because i have nothing nice to say.

---
Enjoy.
---
I‚Äôll sometimes go out of my way to send the killer a message about where a useless or selfish fellow survivor is after I die.

I wanted to put her A-tier but I have my doubts so far. She's still at the top of B-tier since she's a lot better than any of them, but I dont think there's any way to justfy putting her any higher than above Huntress at most.

I sometimes run Paintbrush with MaA and the pill bottle. Can't get looped if they don't know where the fuck you are, and one you get the first hit, let them free and do the same to another survivor. Rinse and repeat until they stop healing themselves to full (I can just self-care myself out 4head) and watch the hooks just walk into you
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be a bad game to play I reckon
---
Wut in retardation is this format?
---

---
DIO confirmed next killer? 
---
And vampire powers 
---
"microwave? how is a small wave going to warm food"
---
Another bandaid hex, yay!  I hope his power is just 4 extra perk slots so we equip all the perks that solve basic mechanical issue the game has. :p  Helio is a nest idea.  String puller needs WAY too long to activate.  The last one will probably make Survivors burn down your house. 
---
In identity V, (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong I don‚Äôt play it much, survivors items are stronger when they match the character. 
---
For example, anyone can pick up a syringe and heal, but only the doctors syringe never runs out of charges. 
---
So like Claudette gets a buff to self care, (maybe faster healing speeds all around), and maybe meg‚Äôs sprint burst lasts longer than other characters (4 seconds instead of 3)
---
Also characters have different traits, like the doctor has slower vaulting speeds but a bigger boost after getting injured by the killer. 
---
Now these ideas could potentially change the meta completely so they will probably never be implemented, but this would be very cool and would solve the problem OP is referring to. 
---
Let's see
---
Do I dedicate thousands of hours of my life to a video game where the only way I'll be able to turn a profit is to either be a streamer or Esports competitor (Esports barely exists in DBD)
---
Or do I run a perk
---
Don't get me wrong if I made more than 5k a month playing a damn video game I would be the best I could possibly be at it as well, but maybe some of us don't have the motivation to do so because we're like, busy with life?
---
Alright, you win the Reddit argument, I guess NOED is only for no-skilled noobs

2 sacrifices, one DC, and one escapee that was hooked twice.

---
Hahaha if you like being rewarded for playing like shit you do you. I don't see how it's fun having a perk hold your hand but like I said you can do as you please.
---
Hey man, when it gets the killer to slug me if I unhook someone, then I'm going for it. (I run DS and Unbreakable. Pick your poison)
---
Trapper is one of the most underrated characters in the game. The guy counters every loop on the map with spending 2 seconds on a trap.
---
Change some in most and we are in agreement.

No killer can be called good killer when: 1 he can't stop a survivor who is working at an almost done to finish it in front of you while dream world transition - this applies to ruin too. 2 he can't stop a just hooked survivor to be unhooked in your face, especially frustrating when the gates are opened and you could have one more kill with every other killer but freddy.
---
I think his power is just too weak. It takes a lot of time to put a survivor to sleep and it's too easy to wake up. Self care it's a nightmare for him.

YES!!!

But why do I always lose to Freddies? I just feel too slow and can't loop or outrun or juke in anyway?

YOU HAVE TO BE BRAIN DEAD TO ASSUME EVERYONE PLAYS SWF! ONE PERSON PLAYING AROUND NOED IS VERY INEFFECTIVE AND CAN TANK AN ENTIRE TEAM! ALSO, THE MAJORITY OF PLAYERS DON'T PLAY SWF!!! THIS ATTITUDE THAT BREAKING 5 TOTEMS IS ALWAYS PRACTICAL NEEDS TO DIE ALONG WITH NOED!!!

I have no problem going against a team willing to go hard vs me. What I don‚Äôt like is when they do a six second timer switch when I was planning on goofing off in the game. I know they‚Äôre just trying to bully/get their memes off though. 
---
UNFORTUNATELY FOR KILLERS THE HATCH IS A NECESSARY FEATURE, WHICH CANNOT BE REMOVED FROM THE GAME. WITHOUT THE HOPE OF ESCAPE YOU WOULD NEVER GET THE CHANCE TO KILL THE LAST SURVIVOR ANYWAYS, BECAUSE EVERY GAME WOULD END IN A DISCONNECT. FORCING A PLAYER TO SIT THROUGH AN AGONIZING FINALE WHERE THEY HAVE 0 HOPE OF SURVIVAL WOULD BE UNFUN AND TERRIBLE GAME DESIGN. EVEN IF YOU COULD GET THE PLAYER TO PLAY IT OUT, THEY WOULD JUST GO SUPER IMMERSED AND HIDE FOR THE REST OF THE GAME, AND THAT WOULDN'T BE FUN FOR THE KILLER EITHER.
---
That‚Äôs why Agitation is one of his perks. Just look at that big ol grin.

I would have the Plague at B tier.

why do people not like legion. ive just come back from a break and dont get it lol
---
Diablo 4, rather the lack thereof
---
There is no win or lose in the game. It‚Äôs up to you to decide that yourself. However, killers do get a lot more BP than survivors do. 
---
I should do the same honestly, i expect too much from killers. 
---
Today had a killer facecamp the 1st guy, then slug me and the other 'til we bled out, fun times :)

Omg I love you both, VER!

Too bad I don‚Äôt play anymore lmao

Swap huntress with hag and this is my exact list üëç

Funny enough, someone did a pole a little while ago about killer mains and survivor mains and it turned out that 54% of this sub are survivor mains, but ok. (I don't have the link but im pretty sure you can easily find it or find someone to link it) 
---
I GOT RESET TO RANK 10 AND NOW I‚ÄôM RANK 10. IF THE KILLER CATCHES ME ONCE HE‚ÄôLL MAKE SURE I DON‚ÄôT GET TO PLAY FOR THE REST OF THE GAME.
---
More specifically, her hex totems 
---
I've had it happen to me once where I brought stab wound study, Frank's and an ebony mori (these were my very first rare items btw I was saving them ). 2 survs never loaded into the game. I felt bad for the other 2 guys so I just let them do gens and escape, they had a good laugh in post-game chat lol. I never use any of these anymore nor play legion much at all
---
Godamnit I thought this was going to be serious 
---
Or you hear it, you scan the area, find nothing, but you swore you hear something and don't give up the search and a bit later the Meg shows up.
---
Either way the totem cleansers are brave
---
it's like you're all assholes. Oh wait.
---
Adept Quentin is and full bloody Quentin are the only achievements I actually cared and tried to get. The rest just come naturally
---
waiting for a perk in the shrine is (Most likely) not worth it. It's all RNG so discordance could pop up next week for all you know. But there are 87 teachable perks in the game. Assuming the shrine does not allow for repeats until EVERY teachable has been on the shrine at least once it could take up to 22 weeks for the perk you want to show up. And I don't know what the rules are for which perks can show up at the shrine. If you REALLY want that 1 perk  just go for the DLC. But there are other perks that do the job. Surveillance doesn't do the exact same thing but it's a pretty good perk now. 
---
Candy mountain Charlie
---
Base-line Clown is surprisingly weak and he lacks any sort of map pressure other than ending chases fast and hanging survivors up on hooks, which makes survivors leave generators and go for rescues.
---
The complete lack of map pressure is his biggest problem. 
---
*Bing bong*
---
https://youtu.be/0w6L93kD3xw?t=8
---
I run discordance on about every build if I have it. It's a good perk. Like the other guy said surveillance is good now it just doesn't do the same thing. Discordance is a good game starter perk. Really gets the ball rolling for you. Mid/end game don't have much impact since you should've put enough pressure on during the start. Personally I love the idea of Legion. He's def not the worst killer but he can be if played wrong. But it doesn't matter what the community thinks, if you wanna play him play him. The perk is good tho.
---
But PEANUT
---
Swap Hag and Huntress, bump Freddy up, lower Pig a bit and lower Clown and this is good
---
I play both dumbass. Lol, however with that statement it shows me you are a survivor main. Which is even worse.
---
Two Possible reasons. One is that I like your scream. Claudette's cracks me up. And Two, you somehow triggered me to the point that I want to hit you on hook to say "You're not going to say daylight this trial"
---
When you're giving out candy on halloween and all the kids reach their hands in the bowl
---
So why are you responding to a two month old thread if the context has changed
---
TOK KI DIDS
---
It's time to stop guys
---
Because I didn‚Äôt check the date? It‚Äôs mildly embarrassing yeah but not really anything to raise a fuss over
---
I‚Äôm here for the controversy 
---
As a survivor "where did they go" mostly because it happened completely naturally, without anyone aiming for it, we were newbies, playing with 2 other stranger newbies, suddenly I see that the hatch is open and literally from 3 corners of the map all of us go for it, might seems childish but it felt cool to me. 
---
As a killer "from the void she kills" because I'm a potato nurse that never uses addons, the one time I decide to try and I get it. 
---
There is technically no winning and losing how ever after every game you get 4 emblems the tell you how well you preformed in different categories and based on that you can either:
---
Depip - lose 1 rank point
---
Safety pip - Neither gain nor lose a rank point
---
Pip - gain 1 rank point
---
Dauble pip - gain 2 rank points
---
____________________________________________________
---
These "Pips" can be seen after the game in the post game lobby and can be seen as the little dots under your rank.
---
Their order on the tier is also to be noted, Freddy is still at the bottom while Wraith is closer to B-tier.
---
Swap spirit and hag. Move Myers down. Swap freddy and clown and id maybe agree
---
? You were aware as soon as I told you that you were necroing a two month old thread, why are you still messaging me
---
He sounds like an idiot
---
I DIDNT KNOW YOU COULD GET GRABBED WHILE JUMPING INTO THE HATCH AND IT HAPPENED TO ME FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER THE OTHER DAY AND I WAS FURIOUS. JUST WANT TO YELL ABOUT IT BECAUSE I SURELY YELLED IRL WHEN IT HAPPENED 
---
Stop messaging me.
---
wow, cool
---
Partially the reason I main doc
---
TRUE BUT WE GET A PERK TO COUNTER ALL ANNOYANCES EXCEPT THE HATCH, WE SHOULD AT LEAST GET A PERK THAT REMOVES THE HATCH SOUND OR SOMETHING THAT MAKES THE FLOOR DIFFICULT TO SEE, THERE IS COUNTER PLAY TO ALL ANNOYING SURVIVOR GAMEPLAY EXCEPT THIER FREE ESCAPE, MAYBE REMOVING IT IS WRONG BUT I CANT EVEN STOP IT NO MATTER WHAT, UNLESS I FIND THEM BEFORE THEY FIND THE HATCH ASSUMING THEY HAVENT DITCHED THE LAST SURVIVOR LOOKING FOR IT. 
---
Can someone help me understand spirit? I‚Äôve been maiming her and put in a lot of points for her but I‚Äôm not consistently getting killls like I do with billy
---
From a cartoon called King of the Hill
---
Quentin did nothing wrong. 
---
IT'S NOT HOLDING A GAME HOSTAGE TO USE OVERCHARGE AND KICK THE CLUSTER OF THREE GENERATORS YOU GUYS LEFT UNDONE. STOP CRYING AND GET GOOD.
---
I don't think the concept of "security" is right in your head. There's no such thing like being "secure" of a legitimate fact. When people talk about insecurity, it's to do with perception of themselves and others. I don't perceive myself to be 19, I *am* 19, therefore I am not a "kiddo". You tried really hard with this comment, too. Sad. 
---
Hank hill is a character from a show called king of the hill. It‚Äôs an animated show from the 90s revolving around the life antics of a middle aged Texas man and his family and focuses on the ‚ÄòAmerican living in the south‚Äô while including stereotypes and injecting humor into some social situations. 
---
It ran for quite some time and even though it‚Äôs often dismissed by some as simply a hillbilly comedy cartoon, it usually has a moral lesson in every episode   
---
This is a super quick and rough description that might be incorrect but it‚Äôs my take on it and the easiest thing to type while at work
---
 The Quentin in me agrees.
---
What‚Äôs the best way to use spirit? I leveled her way past 50 but still can‚Äôt win with her. What should I do
---
let me know if i messed something up
---
LITERALLY ME TODAY, BEEN PLAYING ABOUT 3 WEEKS AND IM STILL TERRIBLE, JUST FINISHED A GAME SOMEONE HAD 3.5K HOURS. I'M LIKE HOW AM I EVEN SUPPOSED TO COMPETE WITH THAT.
---
1. You can always play Survivor/other Killers to get bloodpoints so you can buy the add-ons you want. That said, I just run basic yellow/green add-ons and never struggle with her.
---
2. I admit Nurse is potentially the strongest Killer. But here the thing; if you aren't good with her, you'll often struggle to get a single kill. If you aren't good with Hillbilly, you're still likely to get 1-2 kills just by virtue of his strength and simplicity.
---
3. Of course my tier list is subjective, it is based on *my* experience with the game. I don't have access to the statistics required to make an objective one.
---
4. Yes, a Survivor runs to the next loop, but now the loop you're at is unsafe for Survivors. Hag isn't really meant to stay in a single chase for too long. She's supposed to bounce from Survivor to Survivor.
---
Lol. I actually can't believe people like you are real. you actually think I put effort into that comment lmao no bud
---
Do u know what literally means
---
You're trying too hard kid
---
NOT SO RAGEY UPDATE: I ESCAPED! AND IT FEELS SO....OKAY?
---
That feeling, when even with tools they escape in 2 seconds.
---
*Insert joke about anti-vaxxers here*
---
As mistressofdeath94 said it is really up to you to decide what your definition of winning and losing is. That being said it is only your first three games. There is a definite learning curve when it comes to this game. I would not expect a 4k in your first few games, and there will be a few games where you will be frustrated because it felt like you weren't able to catch anyone. Right now just take your time to learn how the game usually plays out and how to effectively use your killer and their power. The best piece of advice that I can give you to learning killer is to play survivor as well. I started out only playing survivor but one day I played a few killer games. I enjoyed it and now I have around 500 hours playing killer to my 300 hours as survivor. Seeing the game from the other sides perspective will help you understand what the other side pays attention to and what they look for which you can use to improve how you play killer. Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions. I am always willing to help out a new DBD player.
---
It spawns 2 lit totems. If one of it gets destroyed all surviors get exposed fo 40/50/60 sec and the other totem becomes a dull one.
---
But it did! I held it in my hands for a few secs before putting it back.... sooo it LITERALLY did! :) 
---
Then that means that, theoretically, legion was TOO strong. 
---
Think about it- he was SO GOOD at killing people that the entity coulda been like "Frick, not enough food, must prevent"
---
So it added the whole "stun" thing at the end of Feral Frenzy. 
---
He was SO rabid and SO dangerous, the entity had to tone it down a little bit.
---
I really like the legion I can continue 
---
They get a sound notification if you aren't using purple beads, so if you dont have those, dont try to get pulls off the gen, instead mind game them by cutting it early to catch them coming towards you or just follow the scratch marks into the chase, otherwise you just have to have clueless survivors 
---
r/whooosh
---
BROWN THANOS BROWN THANOS BROWN THANOS
---
Thanks. Do all survivors get a noise notification when I use the power? Or just the ones nearby? Also is the sound notification playing the whole time I am phase walking? Or just the beginning 
---
All survivors in terror/heartbeat range and it's the whole time you are phasing
---
i mean but isnt that the point of having to hit multiple times in frenzy? 
---
I blame this shrine for the influx of DS's that I've been encountering.
---
With addons I think that nurse should still be a full tier above spirit but they are definitely close. 
---
Me 2 so I agree with you
---
those goes to clown, leatherface, trapper and legion. 
---
I thought the stun was just a weird and theatrical way of the members being exhausted after exerting themselves.
---
If entity was having too much of a food problem, he would have dumped Sally Smithson back into the 1900‚Äôs a long time ago.
---
Pretending to be a survivor will never happen as long as SWF exists. 
---
Guess they need to learn the Jostar secret technique
---
Eleventhed
---
"You cant stun me, if the pallet only exists in your imagination" -Herrman Carter
---
Freddy is an M1nner with effectively no power.
---
Spirit is that high because she doesn't get looped and a survivor can't do anything to a highly skilled Spirit. S-tier in this is basically the "ignore maps and the survivor-skill entirely".
---
Balancing around SWF would kill the game. SWFs already destroy any killer who isn't top tier.
---
I'm not good enough at Spirit to say. I can recommend ScottJund, I think he has a Spirit guide and is good at her.
---
the guy prevents the gens from being done better than anyone else in this game (yes even pig cause he dont need no rng). and can control the entire map and use survivors as pawns to find even more survivors with his aura reading.
---
Mind games on specific maps can cut chases short. Also, many legion players run Thanatophobia, and you are giving him a free, permanent stack of it.
---
I seem to always get tryhard killers with good addons and perks.
---
I seem to always get tryhard swfs when I play killer during rank reset.
---
Magically most of them disappear when I reach rank 1.
---
Wonder why that happens
---
Not bad
---
It‚Äôs called urban evasion 
---
People think Clown is boring. I mean, basically he is. All his power consists of is throwing a gas bottle at someone. You have to have a special connection to Clown to really enjoy him.
---
It would have been better if they weren't laughing and they were more serious. 
---
Easy counter. Disconnect from the internet on the loading screen and they‚Äôll take 5 mins to finally get kicked out of the match. Punish their toxicity lol.
---
It makes no difference in terms of overall speed if two survivors self-heal(32sec overall) or they heal eachother (16sec x2= 32sec overall)
---
If I were to post this, I would be called toxic for just posting it instantly.

It's weird at time. You'll partially begin the grab, then it becomes a swing. I think it might be latency. The Survivors appears to still be occupied when you reach for them, but they actually stopped doing what they were doing and that bugs out the animation.
---
I mean it's Nurse...on PS4. You should expect minimal fun.
---
But you must admit its true :(
---
That was me the first time to get there just to get the achievement( I thought I was bad at killer and would never get back there). Nowadays I easily get to rank 1 survivor and killer each month without addons or offerings.
---
Sadly true
---
As I'm reading this, I can't help but want to play Hag now.
---
Who was the streamer?
---
Why shouldn't Enduring (Lowers stun duration) counter Decisive Strike (Stun)? Please, explain to me how that makes even the tiniest iota of sense.
---
I don't know what the deal is, but that's usually how it goes for PS4. Survivor lobbies take ages, but Killer lobbies are quick.
---
Soon(tm)
---
lmfao love u
---
I never said it wasn‚Äôt the same company. The entire point of my post is talking about how people complain that they‚Äôre making cosmetics instead of fixing bugs and how they should stop making cosmetics.
---
If they stopped doing cosmetics, then that means the artists will have to pause their work and will have to just sit around, preventing any additional income to support the game.
---
I have no idea why you pulled that comment out of your ass because this entire post has literally nothing to do with where the money goes. And I‚Äôm pretty sure using Maya to make models is completely different to coding in the Unreal engine.
---
So is perma tier 3 Myers also Wraith tier? Because again, that's what Plague is if you don't cure yourself, except she doesn't have to stalk for half the match and instead just vomits on survivors once.
---
I thought they weren‚Äôt going to pick any killers based on real religions?  Also, seems pretty crazy that they‚Äôd release the trailer for Vishnu only a week before Plague drops.

Looks like corrupt purge
---
How are they not?
---
update i,m rank 16
---
Please tell me it was a nice killer 
---
It‚Äôs because nobody wants to play killer due to the shitty framerate. Console survivors aren‚Äôt much worse off than their PC counterparts with the exception of skill checks being harder, but killers are genuinely gimped by the performance and a lot more difficult to play than they are on PC. 
---
Hey, that‚Äôs pretty good.
---
Is that a pier type map? That'd be super cool, love to see something that's half industrial half wilderness (maybe finally some water???)
---
sfm? this is really cool
---
I‚Äôm so happy for you keep going and you‚Äôll be rank one!
---
DS and DH are quite spicy.

---
Well a lot of his add-ons + really annoying perks, like sloppy butcher + thanatophobia + nurse's calling, add-ons like frank's mixtape, iridescent button, cold dirt and ebony mori to top it off. Everyone hates and DCs after metting legion with some of these toxic perks and add-ons
---
Made me smile thanks 
---
Getting the Laurie Adept.
---
I never run any obsession perks so had a rough time of it.

Took me a number of attempts to finally get it.
---
Bing bong boi is special 
---
No Mori, Por Favori
---
It was a Spirit and she didn¬¥t go after me. I got one gen, then stunned her a few times and then I told her to hook me. :D
---
TLDR on how many bloodwebs? There are 168 levels to get 100% of perks on a killer (including the Plague). Not sure about the total bp count but after 50 each consecutive level cost 40-50k bp. After level 50 it is somewhere 5 milion bp to get all levels. 
---
This cracked me up so bad
---
but the survival points bruh
---
Could also be Freddy with a disfigured body and a Beanie. 
---
Sometimes killers, sometimes survivors. My experience as killer is that sometimes they move slow and I get an easy hit, other times they teleport just as I hit nd I miss. 
---
dead link
---
Take off the "bled out" part and you'd be correct.
---
Also tbagging is almost never malicious tho.
---
Then Master of Magnetism can be his special ability rather than a perk. :)
---
Can someone explain some of these? How was the odd bulb OP?How was freddy OP? Thank you :)
---
Not really needed imo.
---
Just need to time it right, a few tries and anyone should get a hang of it.
---
But again thats just my opinion
---
You can clearly see the other trap, plus it's next to a hex. There was no bad luck there. 
---
WRONG. EVERY SURVIVOR DCS WHEN I USE A MORI. 
---
recreate the game with better balance we'll all play
---
It's either way too OP or way too weak.
---
If his power only works while moving towards a gen, it's super weak.
---
If you just have to look at a gen, well... That's Nurse tier
---
Am I missing something? How meta/popular is Enduring? I know it's actually pretty powerful but at the same time I don't feel like it sees use often.
---
[THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT A LINK AT ALL, BUT FLAVOR TEXT THAT MAKES YOUR TEXT SHAKE ON DESKTOP, MAKING YOU SEEM ANGRY OR AT LEAST LOUD.](/intensifies)

Oh my god, I'm gonna- 
---
*dies*
---
A tip: when you're going around walls and stuff, try not to cut your corners so wide, what I mean is that be as close to the wall as possible when running and when turning around corners
---
The face camping is somehow worse at Rank 20-15. Its like the noobs are already learning to be toxic.
---
wait why is dwight and the trapper affiliated with eachother again?
---
I'm SWF main and I think shapeshifter concept could work, you just have to make it that, it just have to be designed in such a way that killer would be able to get close before the survivors could confirm their identity as it would take some time like 2-3 seconds.
---
Also I had an idea that would let a killer to tag survivors and then posess the body of tagged survivor if they are in killer's TR without them knowing. Once survivor is posessed, killer can reveal themselves at any moment at the cost of posessed survivor breaking free with a short sprint and invulnerablility for a short period of time (to get away) 
---
Gen lights so short
---
I lowkey like when they were serious just cause it‚Äôs fun to see everyone‚Äôs opinions
---
Damn that is brutal
---
I wouldn't say never, but it really isnt as bad as people say. Tbaging can mean many things, it can even be friendly under the right circumstances.
---
Twelveth
---
And the hate you get for it, is just great. All those arrogant survivors thinking everything is for them...
---
You forget that this is a different Freddy. We have the reboot Freddy. Not classic Freddy. Reboot Freddy has not really done anything like what classic Freddy did in his respective movie. Maybe reused some of the original Elm Street kill scenes but nothing as bombastic as the original.
---
If you can make a decent carnival/circus/funhouse map, I'd definitely recommend your stuff to BHVR.
---
Adept Doctor, his perks work against him. 
---
Really fishy ... would not trust OP
---
Ugh I love the gays of DBD
---
Who‚Äôs the bigger noob, the noob who gets caught by the noob or the noob camping ?
---
A new way to loop.
---
Oh by all means, it's definitely a fun thing to see, depending on how one looks at it.
---
As much as I'd love an "all-loving, wholesome and welcoming" community, not just for this but for every game, that simply isn't going to happen, ever. There's always going to be some person who has to be an asshole for no reason. We all know those people who say "Oh I love their salt, I feed on it!" *(Right...)*, etc.
---
All we can really do is "be nice" ourselves, for as long as one can stretch it. I know that being nice yet still getting trashtalked isn't a good feeling.
---
I disagree with this completely. Freddy is the only killer that always gets us, no matter what. 
---
And here we have retard survivor in his native environment..., every match at least one DC. Honestly I don't even mind that much if he does not care about wasting his time and losing BPs. Best twats are those that DC at start of the match and then wait for it to end to cuss at me in post chat xD
---
Killer has to find the survivor before they find hatch thats the game once it spawns. Not perfect but good enough. Again i think hatch is fine as is
---
Fucking Fairy/Poison type.
---
There are guides by various people on YT. It's usually better to watch others for a bit to see how they play, and then try to apply that yourself. But the best way is to get some field time.
---
Hey! I started DBD a few months ago and I‚Äôve hit red ranks, so I reckon I can help a little. 
---
The first tip I‚Äôd give is learn the maps. Maps change in the smaller details (hook spawns, chest spawns etc) but main structures remain the same. For example, there will always be a killer shack and Mother‚Äôs Dwelling will always have the wooden hut with the carcasses hanging. 
---
Next, I‚Äôd suggest making your own play style, or if you‚Äôre struggling with that, watch people like tru3talent and understand what they do and why they do it. By having a play style that you‚Äôre personally involved in, it‚Äôll be a lot easier to make adaptations based on the match and the survivors. 
---
So this doesn‚Äôt get too heavy, I‚Äôll stop at 3. The last tip is to just practice mind-gaming. By that, I mean trying to get into the head of the survivor you‚Äôre chasing and basically lead them to where you want them to go. As you‚Äôve said you enjoy Trapper, if you‚Äôve trapped an area, you should be able to lead them in that area‚Äôs general direction. This takes a bit more time to master, but will help you a lot in the long run. 
---
Good luck and see you in the Fog!
---
calculating THAT would be a pain in the ass, your talkin about leveling from base to max on all characters? Its not that cut and dry because the more characters you level up the more options arise, if that makes sense. The variables constantly change. I'm sure it would be possible but it would be a pain in the ass
---
What? Clown is overrated. He isn‚Äôt bottom but he is low mid tier. He is in the same level as a Trapper and LF though. I feel like that entire tier should be swapped.
---
I dodge nothing 'cuz it's a scummy tactic, but when I see 2+ tool boxes, I usually prepare accordingly by adjusting my mindset to meta-game the fuck out of literally everything I do.
---
That usually means getting salt in the endgame chat for actually checking the area around the hooks, and getting my free kills when people unhook others in front of me.
---
Darn it. I just wanna lurk and save why you want me to expose myself?
---
Yeah, not too long ago I would run Odd bulb and Intense Halogen thinking it would be OP only to realize my flashlight battery was down to 5% after a couple uses.
---
I didn't read it all I laughed at the "This is a HORROR game. There is absolutely no reason you should be angry when you get killed" part and came here. This is a never ending war between us and the survivors
---
Ahem. Yeah, that was 100% me. I said that. And I do love getting hatemail, even to this day. But I am doing my best to stop just hunting for it (Got plenty today just for playing doctor like doctor. Was funny seeing people rage and threaten to report me because I kicked gens with Overcharge. Like ‚ÄúHow dare you use your perks to stop us from escaping‚Äù while they were a multi-Decisive Strike squad.)
---
Point being, not trying to be a hypocrite so I‚Äôm going out of my way to practice what I‚Äôm telling others to do now.
---
I'd rather have the survivor be Dr. Bright.
---
I think you did a pretty good job so far üòÇ
---
I don't think the cosmetics are necessary. If I were to implement it myself I would just make it so the werewolf's human state randomly selects an appearance based on one of the survivors in game, that way there's no easy way to tell which one is the real survivor.
---
for me, it's about frequency, and speed. If i teabag twice quickly, i'm greeting another survivor. 3 slow teabags is a thank you. A constant quick stream is me being a little douche
---
7 seconds isn‚Äôt long but 84 is.

I have clue of what achievements I've gotten but I've got my own lol
---
Me and a friend fixed five generators against a Nurse and we both managed to make it out alive
---
For two minutes you've done a great job. I'd waste thirty seconds thinking of how to start. You even got the pose right
---
That's why i play Legion. To ruin survivors day
---
I want to do this too &gt;.&lt; but too lazy to draw
---
I think wraith would be: no looking
---
They did. By not letting people see the perks. Dont get me wrong, its still too op, but they do try the best they can. What else can they do? There isnt really that much to nerf them. How are you supposed to nerf talking?
---
As a Dwight main, I forgive you
---
Someone (YouTubers are my guess) is promoting to use gay as an acceptable descriptor because I see it rampant in the middle school ages, 11-15, and when I first took issue with it, these are kids with rainbows on the same folders and are shipping same sex relationships so they aren‚Äôt anti gay... it‚Äôs confusing because it almost seems like every generation uses it differently.
---
I'd just exclusive emotes that you can only unlock for others once you prestiged the survivor to three
---
Shirtless DIO, Dio Brando, and purple lipstick Rockstar. Damn, now I want him as a killer. 
---
Woah B-But why? 
---
When i play against legion eith Franks‚Äôs mixtape because it‚Äôs hell to play against that. 
---
I know that people DC because they don‚Äôt like the killer, to derank, to troll other survivors or just because they want to. Dc-ing just screws over the survivors that are left. Same with killing one‚Äôself on first hook. At least give the game a chance.
---
Clown isn‚Äôt high mid tier.
---
Legion is worse than Legay?
---
What was tinkerer like before? And what's that thing (add-on?) under STBFL? 
---
#SUFFOCATION  
---

---
The add ons however require a buff. Not insta flash, but something that will actually make them viable. Nothing is worth using besides batteries and yellow bulb.
---
Yeah There is this 'confession' post, look for it and read my sins :D
---
Nea and I rotate killers. I‚Äôd love to become a Nurse main though (ps4)
---
DBD isn't a horror game. It feels more thriller. There are definitely tense moments in this game, but I'm no longer scared.
---
I would like to be scared though - I wish they added more atmospheric lightning and made all maps significantly darker, but all killers have night vision (maybe even thermal sense to an extent).
---
Shit, should we go looking for him?
---
Nice ideas for the rework. Would be a fun killer to play as and against. Plus is will become a true horror game, other than loop loop loop it is now
---
&gt; along with Brand new part
---
That sounds like a man that experienced 4 insta gens way back then
---
michael would just be 'no'
---
Ya but that's not the flashlight lol
---
dead by daylight
---
While DBD has scary moments, the horror wears off pretty quickly. I've played Silent Hill 3 at least 10 times and I don't find it scary anymore either. When the horror wears off, all that remains is a competition between 2 sides. The ranks may not mean anything, but we still often strive to get a good score and at least a pip
---
Don't really play killer all that much anymore but when I do it's The Trapper. Only ever play as Myers or Doctor if a daily comes up.
---
For survivor I swap between Ace, Claudette and Dwight.
---
Ok, let's go from the start I guess.
---
1\. The game is meant to be scary.
---
Ok, to a degree, yes. But a game like this is never going to be scary for long. There's jumpscare-based killers, both in terms of stealth and Hag traps, but for the most part the game is more a "horror-themed asymmetrical multiplayer" game than actual horror. It uses many tropes from horror but there's very little reason to actually be scared beyond your early days of playing.
---
2\. Complaining about dying.
---
Horror games actually take a LOT of balancing around dying. Most of the ones you reference are very careful. You die too much in a horror game and any fear is lost because unfair enemies force you to repeat sections and destroy your immersion.
---
3\. Dick moves and unfun tactics.
---
Camping someone to death isn't fun, and when it comes down to it people want to have fun in a *game.* To suggest people will just become happy from dying in a cheap way, even considering the point of this thread "killers are meant to kill you, dwi" (I guess) is just ignorant. If you're suggesting looping is against the premise of the game and should be removed because it doesn't make sense, nor does a horror-movie killer watching a person slowly bleed out while 3 perfectly valid targets are around because they want to 'secure a kill.'
---
Interlude: Maybe make your argument in your post and stop spending half of every paragraph on "don't hate me or disagree with me, people who still haven't responded, ecks dee!"
---
4\. Gen speed.
---
Gen speed fucking confuses me. We know it's the biggest problem, especially to start the game. The devs know this too. So what happens?
---
"We don't want to slow the game by making you hold M1 on a gen longer, so instead you can hold M1 to heal longer, that'll do literally anything when 3 gens go off in the first chase, right?"
---
And of course, it makes the game more boring for survivors but really doesn't fix gens going off to fast in the slightest.
---
And then we have Ruin and Corrupt Intervention, 2 absolute BANDAID perks to fix the issue. I'm still trying to work out the thought process behind CI, so the only effect is you may start chase 1 a little faster by forcing them near you, then what? They can only do 4 gens in the first 2 minutes? Slow down there BHVR, wouldn't want to make a perk impact survivors AT ALL. Hell, even if they still do 4 gens before the perk drops, chances are the last 3 gens are now very distantly spread making it an easy grab against most killers, seeing as the only way to pull a 3 gen out of CI is to spawn as killer up one end of Azarov's. It's a terrible waste of a perk slot.
---
Can we please have even just a test of a gen mechanic change? There've been like 50 mentions by devs of a secondary objective yet we see 0, often "it didn't feel good so players never even got to see any of it." What about slowing down generator progress for each one remaining, lowering how many gens can pop quickly at the start but not hindering late game progress as a consequence?
---
5\. Good luck fixing toxicity.
---
Balance the game, encourage good gameplay, whatever. You can't fix toxic behaviour entirely and it's always going to be in competitive games, better to just accept it and move on. And yes, the act of competing against another side does make this a competitive game, even if it isn't a style of game that supports professional play.
---
killer mains who complain about geb rush clearly didnt experience the old brand new part and it shows
---
With Frank's Mixtape addons you just need to hit them 3 times (2 Frenzies) and with Cold Dirt + Julie's Mixtape it's 2 hits, you just hit them in Frenzy, catch up, exit Frenzy and hit again
---
Tinkerer was a perk that affected specific add-ons on every killer and made them more powerful. F.e. as huntress there was the machine gun build where you could throw super fast hatchets because Tinkerer made some add ons more efficient.
---
The New Mon Bouquet (the offering under STBFL) effected the lighting in maps. When you offered it, it was dark af. 
---
Ye it's fire
---
&gt; cheat...
---
&gt; by chasing after the target with the least health.
---
Ok buddy. If Survivors didn't suck at staying hidden, I wouldn't chase the injured one again.
---
Jeff/David (can't decide) and Myers. I like them big bois
---
Just 3 seconds? Okay!
---
I am still waiting for a harder nurse nerf.
---
Just had a "match" against a 4 blink, full prestige, invisible ruin nurse and it simply was not fun. I know nurse has been topic of debate ever since people figured out how to play her and do realise that  killers should have a certain power over the game, but this is just to much. 
---
You will argue "be sneaky", but it's not possible with so many detection perks and  ever so weak stealth perks. 
---
This makes me want a new Spirit mori where she just gets a shit ton of arms that just rip the survivor to death 
---
Ending of DiU be like:
---
No offense to you,  But I think this is a horrible idea 
---
You‚Äôre so random what‚Äôs your myspace.
---
Thank you for proving my point. 
---
This is a good list
---
No it wasn't. Original was missed cooldown reduction of 20%, successful of 33%. It was then swapped over to a 40% reduction on successful attack **once, after you have spent 20 seconds in a chase** and if chase got broken you only got to keep it for 5 seconds.
---
If you were using it more than once per chase you were probably relying too much on bloodlust. New verison's much better.
---
Why not a mode with infinite flashlights, maps completely dark and no music. And the killers have night vision
---
Nurse &amp; Freddy. 
---
First time I ever played the game was with the Nurse- so I‚Äôm fond of her (being OP doesn‚Äôt hurt either). And I remember being terrified of Freddy, terrified of going to sleep, as a kid... so I main him too. Freddy may seem shitty, but the more you can instill that terror and mindgamness, the more you can get them to run around like headless chickens and be unproductive (at the lower ranks, anyway). Can‚Äôt wait for the Plague‚Äôs new terror-radius-swap perk to come out. Gonna be TOP NOTCH M8
---
Survivor-wise, I like the look of Kate, ‚Äòcause she looks closest to me. I can‚Äôt wait til she gets better cosmetics... full-on Viking apparel would be sweet.
---
Oh yeah, DbD is at its best when you just started out. That "scary" element is what really gets you hooked first, before the gameplay really does and you can't stop playing!
---
Have fun in the fog! üòÅ
---
Sure, just give me unlimited sprint burst.
---
He was asking what it was before the nerf
---
Feng! I love her subway mask outfit and she‚Äôs cute and sounds cute. I‚Äôm simple minded when picking characters in games. Also, if I‚Äôm panicked, her technician skill is useful. Plus I like the perk that lets you see the killer whenever they break something and the arrows that point to the killer. 
---
As for killers, I like Spirit‚Äôs school girl outfit, but I‚Äôm terrible at playing killer. 
---
I‚Äôve had the game less than a week, so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get sick of only Feng and explore other options later. 
---
I forget the name but there was a program that showed an overlay of sounds. It displayed a sort of 360 degrees pie and showed you where sounds where coming from. Maybe it'll help here?
---
It might be dirty, but... I got an erection.

My main killer is Myers

My main survivor is Feng

I always try to keep one Pick me Up loadout on my killes. Something that‚Äôll let me feel good during a bad day or top off a great day. 
---
With Legion, it‚Äôs Stab Wounds Stufy and Filthy Blade. People give FMT+SWS the evil eyes but what people don‚Äôt truly realize is the amount of time needing to be spent Filthy Blade requires to Mend off and SWS cutting a 30 second timer down to a 20. I like to call it ‚ÄúOne Finger Death Button‚Äù cause I can hit someone with a frenzy stab, and just herd them around an area because I know they will have their finger on the don‚Äôt die Button. I will just wait cause I know they won‚Äôt be able to let it go and I just slowly stalk around areas to find them. 
---
How is ds Dead, it's basically an anti-tunneling prevention perk if you are good at loopimg the killer might aswell ignore you or DC.
---
On live, it's 50%/75%/100% bonus BP for Deviousness. On PTB, it's changed to 100% to deviousness on all tiers, only the terror radius increases.
---
Ear rape
---
4 gens in 2 minutes wtf i hated killer maining in those days we have it pretty nice now in comparison.
---
TBH I've been testing new DS on PTB and I really like it and find kinda usefully. 
---
Thanks a lot for sharing this with me, it's definitely helped me with my matches since I've watched it! c:
---
Ill never forget spawning in as a wraith, having to cloak myself, and watching 4 gens immediately pop by the time I've taken my 5th step forward. 
---
as a Toxic Nea and Spirit Main I approve of the new ds
---
Actually tho!
---
Looks good, only gripe is you didnt make trappy boi T H I C C enough.
---
I'd argue they are stupid. In any sense of the word. They've been listening to community feedback for years, and still designed a killer like legion. Even after all the PTB feedback, and them even acknowledging the moonwalk exploit, they still haven't done anything to fix him. Like most issues with the game they ignore it for 6 months to a year before either doing nothing about it or half assing a fix.
---
I also approve, as an occasional solo survivor who gets paired with one too many immersed Claudettes. I had a few situations last night where I thought to myself ‚Äúif I had the new DS right now, I‚Äôd be in a much better spot‚Äù. I‚Äôm a killer main but watching other killers just blatantly ignore everyone around me, just to come for me without any good reason, yeah. DS will be huge for punishing tunnellers. 
---
Apparently everyone is making memes between The Plague (Adiris) and the Spitter from Left 4 Dead 2.
---
Tradition?
---
An important thing to note is that while you can consider "pipping" to be winning, you don't get anything at High Ranks. There is no bonus to being Rank 1 or anything.
---
What you do get, however, is a bunch of try-harding survivors with flashlights, meta perks, and t-bags, along with the same three killers every single game and queue times that go through the roof.
---
He's wrong. They're just changing it to 100% bonus to deviousness across all tiers instead of 50%/75%/100%, and still counts towards your 8k cap.
---
Wtf is invisible ruin?
---
That's what I thought, thanks for confirming.
---
I'd argue no fun applies to all of these except hag and trapper.
---
When major updates come out they release on PC under an optional Player Test Build (PTB) before releasing fully on consoles etc. The current ptb made changes to numerous perks but with Decisive Strike as of right now it's a chance to escape when the killer picks you up that you can only do once but in the PTB it's now changed to prevent the killer tunneling you when you get off the hook
---
Dwight n' Doctor
---
They're cool
---
I enjoy your content, man. Don't listen to him, he's just farming for downvotes. Pls make more of this :)
---
Don't you dare to mock the absolute unit being 
---
Play against legion and you'll find out. Unless you love holding M1 and getting """"outplayed"""" more than life itself. 
---
I understand that this is a shitpost but what's 'J' supposed to mean?
---
Amazing!
---
Exactly. Just tempt them into dropping it
---
what are you gonna do, StAb Me?!
---
I haven't played the new update I am also wondering this
---
I THINK YOU FORGET, THIS IS DBD WHERE EVERYONE IS A DICK FOR THE SAKE OF BEING A DICK 
---
Honestly Legion is awful to play against regardless of how they play. Even when they don't hit you twice and leave its still boring as hell. And 90% of the time they don't play that way anyways.
---
I was about to say...
---
Don't downvote the man if you can't explain yourself.
---
I don't really have mains but I'd say Nea and Bubba if I had to pick.
---
There was a reason they removed brightest and darkest moonlight offerings. It was way too much work.
---
His perks kick him in the teeth. The only addon that counter m and a is the purple calm. And then you have to yellow calm to get a bigger terror radius. But in a chase m and a helps you cause you gain 8 meters so 8+8+6 is a 22 meter increase. So in total 54 or 55 meter terror radius. 
---
Myers: no warning
---
But this means you are the horrible teammate? 
---
This comment chain is like if you boiled down this subeddit into its base components.
---
"I play killer to be an asshole"
---
"Sad"
---
"Salt"
---
It says you have 25 perks unlocked, leavin 26, but there are in total 57 killer perks.
---
:o :O
---
can you tell me how it punishes tunnelers i haven‚Äôt seen anything about the new one yet 
---
Pirouettes! Moonwalking! The possibilities are endless! 
---
He's king of the Pumpkin Patch
---
The Freddy launch was when I finally decided to buy Dead by Daylight (nothing to do with Freddy, it‚Äôs just coincidence). I read the Steam reviews and all the reviews on the Freddy DLC were thumbs down and ranting about how he needs to be nerfed. 
---
I didn‚Äôt get to go up against him too much before they nerfed him. 
---
To be honest I wouldn't, because that'd mean that there would be voice chat And that means that I can cherish the reactions of the survivors I'm up against. And I can recognize the toxic people easier and focus them down.
---
Ds is still good... ill still run it on my builds, its great for anti tunneling.
---
Someone bring that emaciated one on the right some tendies and hunny mussy sauce STAT
---
I haven‚Äôt downvoted anybody?
---
What is this platform I keep seeing, where people can talk to the players on the other team?
---
you can only use it after getting hooked once
---
it activates for 60 seconds or smth and if the killer downs you during that time you can **Instantly** the moment he picks you up ds his ass
---
You done did get downvoted though. I voted you back up.
---
Save The Best For Last was thankfully reincarnated...
---
your name blackout is insufficient, btw
---
So you don‚Äôt want to learn how to play against them? I get it, legion can be annoying sometimes when they run certain add ons or plays a certain way but that can be said for any killer with their god mode add ons some can down you faster then legion 
---
You should stick it out and even if you don‚Äôt think you will win just try things out and see what works instead of just dc when you see deep wound but if you don‚Äôt care it is what it is and you can do what you want in the end 
---
It is PlayStation Messages, which is a PlayStation app (obviously ) 
---
Oh. 
---
Eh. Redditors will be redditors. I try not to take karma too seriously, especially in this sub. Lmao. 
---
I will fix that right away! Worked on an iPhone lol
---
No, his name is now legay
---
Probably want to derank 
---
DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT SWF STACKS SAY ABOUT YOU. IF THEY'RE DIVE BOMBING THAT HOOK AND YOU SEE TWO SURVIVORS WHILE YOU'RE CARRYING SOMEONE TO IT THEN YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO STAY IN THAT AREA UNTIL YOU'RE CONFIDENT THEY AREN'T THERE.
---
The issue being that it was a lot of situations, not just the situations where the killer is running something to buy time that could be countered out. It's going to be interesting to see the meta shift a little now that there's a bit more breathing room coming from the confidence that a down from chase number one actually translates into some form of momentum, rather than a kick in the teeth.

---
They just defy all the other rules of dbd. They discourage alot of what the game is built on and they can tunnel so effectively that it feels like if they see you you are dead. I know its git gud mentality but I just get annoyed when I dont with other killers. 
---
I try every now and again but the annoying legion players ruin it for the good ones
---
Ah, thanks.
---
Thank you!
---
Classify Doctor as No Fun, and then we can agree.  Fuck skillchecks on console against a doc.
---
Peps...
---
It's a reference to STBFL + Unrelenting combo. After they were both nerfed, STBFL was one of the worst perks for a long time until it was recently buffed.
---
I used exaggeration to point out that it was really hard to find. Actually, No one found it so it might well have been. Probably not though. Just a bit of salty wording.
---
I remember using iton some killers, but I can't remember those 10% being OP on anyone in particular? 
---
shhh my phat fingers confused b and g
---
lol not understandable i prestiged my boy myers and didn't recognize his perk smh
---
HHAHAHAHA
---
lol not understandable i prestiged my boy myers and didn't recognize his perk smh.
---
This. They're intentionally trying to drop ranks. 
---
Freddy is great at watching kids, it was a burning passion.
---
In my opinion leatherface is not better than trapper, or even freddy. Such a niche instadown 
---
1.5 hour then my brain just stop responding to anything 
---
Now with the new Killer you can get face camped and puked on repeatedly. 
---
It's task manager time
---
You can't really avoid his power if its used right. And in my experience they play like assholes. Its not like his power is game breaking, but I really hate how it blurs the screen. Its like the doctor in that way, just really really annoying. 
---
how? the whole sub is just stupid memes
---
Wasted 2 Memento mori Offerings for this. Good old bad times
---
Huntress reached 50% increased wind-up time with them, and Hillbilly reached up to 55% faster chainsaw charging. It was changed for a reason
---
:D
---
THE REBOUND ADDON IS THE IRIDESCENT ONE 
---
yes, they said they changed it because they had to make the killers abillity and addon around that perk exsisting, and I can't remember the chainsaw with 2 speed addons becoming worse after losing it, I never used it on huntress tho. 
---
Moro machine broke
---
Add Benny Hill and you're even more accurate 
---
I laughed, nice.
---
Actually, I crawled over to the Claudette, she got me up, crouched in the corner again, Legion found her, killed her and I got the Hatch ü§£
---
geg rush?
---
That was a long long time ago
---
Hey guys, it‚Äôs the thread police, this one is getting shut down. Party‚Äôs over, please leave.
---
No, unfortunately. I think it should given the perk's description, though 
---
Aside from other suggestions, look into Jake and Feng perks. Alert, Calm Spirit, and Iron Will are great for stealth and awareness.
---
WHO LIVES IN A BASEMENT UNDER THE SHACK
---
Jesus that sounds so frustrating, but at least justice was served in the end!
---
Bad lag, when someone else DCs in the first ten seconds, sometimes when it's a 3 man bc fuck that. Very rarely out of sheer frustration, once I had a game where a huntress hit me thrice when i was two metres away from the hatchet, that can get a girl to rage-quit.
---
Also hell yeah I don't want to rank up, if I didn't want to be an asshole I would be DCing all the time just to get out of the red ranks. I don't want to play against people with 3k hours when I have just got to 300. Though of course there's also way too experienced players in the not-red ranks, but that's a different problem
---
I wish they'd nerf legion so I don't feel bad when I play him
---
Survivor: David because of WGLF, and I still have good perks before I prestige him.
---
Killer: Wraith, but I‚Äôm going to be working on maining Hillbilly and Hag.
---
Most of these marathon streamers treat this game like a job. If its anything similar to my job they've become numb to it 2000+ hours will do that (drugs and alcohol help). But I'm sure they do get *tilted* they're just better at processing it and dealing with it because no one wants to watch someone stream and act insufferable towards a game/other players.
---
Buuut before she was found I was chased for another good 5 minutes which she stood still (she ended up getting 3 crows that‚Äôs how she was found)
---
correct.
---
I hope your kidding about Freddy being on top ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
And totems. Please do totems I'm tired of dealing with noed because people run by dull totems instead of breaking them
---
To be fair, killers had their own fair share of over powered bullshit back then.
---
Three blink full speed Nurse.
---
Invisible traps.
---
Arrow key Hillbilly.
---
Unlimited NOED.
---
Game was an unbalanced but glorious mess.
---
Yeah but why not just be completely AFK? Instead they have some program so they keep attacking while standing still. Isnt that bannable?
---
In the lore, I believe Frank is the only one who is over 18. Julie is 17 and Susie and Joe are 15-16. 
---
Well, Billy.
---
Both sides have some bullshit and for some reason a lot of players don‚Äôt want to admit it. Survivors want killers to play nice and usually killers start out playing nice but after getting tbagged at every exit gate because survivors refuse to leave until they can make sure you see them bag, then the killer stops caring or carry over the salt into the next game and take it out on the next group. 
---
Survivor can be pretty challenging if you playing solo and your team just isn‚Äôt doing anything or going down quickly. Ruin can either kill a game or have no effect at all but killers run it because at higher ranks gens just go super quick. Going against certain builds as a solo survivor will make you want to break shit lol and if your rng is bad you can have no pallets or your team used them all up and it‚Äôs just a matter of time before you go down so it comes down to how efficient is your team in the end.
---
Then you have the noed debate and yea I‚Äôve seen killers who definitely rely on it but survivors need to understand that at the end of the game isn‚Äôt the best for killers without certain builds and when that last gen pops you usually have 2-3 people go to full health and booking it to the door (adrenaline) so noed counters that and at least makes survivors scared of the end game because right now if you aren‚Äôt running certain builds you have to hope you down someone and hope the team wants to make the save so you can get some last minute pressure
---
Main point you have to see it from both sides and a lot of players don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt think either side is more broken the other it just depends on the players and most (definitely not all lol) games have a good push and pull of momentum
---
And that's not including the fact that certain players might not have the teachables of a particular survivor so when someone picks that character, not only do they not get to play the character they wanted, they also don't get to use the perks they wanted to use. 
---
(This can branch beyond just teachable perks too.)
---
Clown is addon dependent. Play clown with no addons or brown addons, and throwing bottles is actually a waste of time because you slow yourself just as much as you're slowing the survivors. You basically have no power.
---
What a beautiful Duwang 
---
I play 50/50 and attempting to play during rank reset as a killer is fucking brutal because queue times are even more atrocious. As such you‚Äôre forced to play survivor and then you have killers who get mad at you for simply existing. 
---
Personally I love the new DS change. I've used it a lot in its current state but I like it as an anti tunnel perk and for it to be dribble proof now
---
I play survivor a bit more than killer, I personally believe the nurse is fine. She takes a TON of skill to master, &amp; once she does she becomes quite a competitor. That‚Äôs how i feel it should be. You must use skill to have hope of winning with her. 
---
Plus, she‚Äôs the most fun to fight against, especially when she‚Äôs talented!
---
This made me really wonder: what is her opinion on The Entity? I feel like she accepted It as her new True God giving her basically an eternal life. On the other hand, she's physically suffering eternally.  
---
dang
---
About tree fiddy (minutes)
---
Don't know if I really have a killer *main*, but I really enjoy playing Myers and Spirit. I play all of them except for Legion, Billy, and Doctor though. 
---
I play all the female survivors equally; my main used to be Meg but lately I've been using Kate a lot. 
---
That‚Äôs not specifically toxic, my friend. If a pallet happens to be down, you can get a free break sure but there are so few pallets on most maps unless it‚Äôs an auto haven variant I think it‚Äôs called Wrecker‚Äôs Yard. Outside of that, Legions UR addons are honestly tame by comparison to a lot of others. 
---
No one likes playing killer on ps4 anymore or atleast alot dont 
---
Legion with BBQ, Distressing and Beasts of Prey. Very easy to max Brutality / Hunting / Deviousness.
---
With 4 stacks on BBQ, easy 50k+ even with 4 escapes. 
---
Holy smokes that is brutally quick.
---
I'm not sure about the enjoying killing part but I feel like she's definitely doing it to please god/Entity. She's basically given an eternal life after all. 
---
Doctor/Hag/Wraith 
---
as it's easy to get Deviousness filled up pretty fast on em, after that just hook em once then move on. After that chill or play tag with em 
---
you could go the survivor route and farm hooks by dismantling em 99% (easy quick bold points) + were gonna live forever to get those sexy post game points stacks + prove thyself to fill up obj meter quickly. throw in a cake and your gonna get a decent amount.  
---
Most points i've gotten outside of 1.5 or double blood points without anyone else using party streamers in the lobby streamers. 
---
Killer close to 100k Survivor 80k 
---
Whoever you're best at/have the most fun with + BBQ really.  Doc gains Devious points really easily, but they still max out at 8000, and if you hate the way he plays you're probably not going to be able to farm points on him for very long anyway. 
---
If you've got a wide killer pool start off by checking your offerings to see who you've got puddings and streamers laying around on. 
---
Someone answered
---
Maybe but to make sure the game is legal (?) they all have to be over 18
---
Voice chat breaks the hell out of sooooooo many aspects of this game. 
---
I personally think that she accepted The Entity as her new god (or one of the god she worshipped) who granted her an eternal life. 
---
I‚Äôm on the same thought train as you. She was calling out for help and begged God for help and while she was definitely suffering before she and the others were taken, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs still suffering as much as she‚Äôs just stuck like that now for the rest of time kinda like Deadpool. 
---
I am not defending DS overall, just stating that it gave some extra time against moris.
---
I need beasts of prey. Legion is my BP farmer. 
---
True, I believe they did say sometime ago that all the survivors are over 18 to avoid, but lore wise I find that some of the characters would have to be under 18 due to the nature of when and how they were taken by the entity. 
---
Ship it. Free Dlc.
---
Such as what? Most people already use discord. I thought it would be cool for the killer to be able to hear you if they got close and you were talking.
---
guessing you want it to run ingame similar to Fridays voice chat without using the "Radio" 
---
A voice chat ingame allowing randoms to talk to each other will get "killers" up in arms 
---
No problem, good luck!
---
Dammit I read the responses in the tune 
---
Lmao cheat
---
My favorite killer by far. So easy to end a chase, or start one when you had no clue a survivor was somewhat close by. Also, it's like make your choice was designed for her. If you just drop a trap about 5m behind a hook usually the rescuer will run into it after crouching away after a save lmao
---
I used to be that guy that would get hit by ruin and immediately go try and find the totem, or gen tap all game but one day I just said fuck it. Ever since then I've been telling myself to just go for those great skill checks whether it would get me killed or cost me the game. Now I can hit those more consistently and just yesterday I hit my record of 7 in a row. Just do it!
---
same
---
Same for me, yet I don't like her. I only play occasionally so got only around 300h so far in the game, and if there is a good killer, I will die anyways. But I have fun being chased by hilly or other top tier killers, even though I lose most of the time. I got the illusion of having a chance. 
---
For me it's the same thing why people complain about legion, and I can even partly understand the dcing. If you play for fun but all you get is the space-bar-press simulator it's just not worth playing. 
---
I also played killer and the dark age of flashlight gave me ptsd as well. It simply wasn't fun.
---
But I am a casual and can understand that balance patches should not necessarily be based in this. 
---
I main Kate Denson and the Huntress
---
I shoul'dve put a "," there, my bad :)
---
I have never played Friday the 13th. 
---
That‚Äôs kinda crappy but I guess they would as much advantage they could get.
---
The Breakfast Club here! (Legion, Nea and Spirit) 
---
Just a quick question. Regarding hard focusing the strongest player on the team in order to get a 4K, wouldn‚Äôt it be better to target the weaker teammates and use them as bait for that specific survivor? 
---
Most recent [Patch Notes](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/50204/2-6-0-chapter-11-player-test-build), cc: /u/JaCrispy_34
---
Didn't know that about pallet numbers but still makes the game pretty ez for him once he removes the pallets with an Iri button. And i just listed some add-ons people consider toxic, not all
---
She‚Äôs soo much fun once you get the hang of her. I‚Äôd recommend watching Space Coconut on Youtube to get some tips for how to play her effectively. 
---
I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt change it when they added deliverance TBH.
---
You can still pump 4 in 3.
---
I DC against Prayer Beads and Iridescent Head. Its not worth playing. 
---
If i get hooked and no teamates are doing gens, I'll suicide. 
---
If another teamates DCs early, i will too. 
---
I just want fun games. I dont quite understand auto DC'ing against legion (or any specific killer) but to each his own.
---
For a looter build on Quentin: Pharmacy, Ace In The Hole, Plunderer's Instinct + whatever you need to survive. I prefer Iron Will.
---
So I came back to the game the other day with a friend. (Our ranks got reseted a couple of times and we went from 1-5 to 17)
---
We playing against a Wraith. We take turns running with him. We repair 3 generators. 
---
Then he found another survivor. Down him. Hook him. He kills himself in hook. Other one gets hooked too. Unhook him. Run with killer. Killer tunels him (in this case, acceptable I guess). He purposely dies too.
---
So we start taking turns on the killer again and we do another gen. The friend got killed and I get hatch.
---
WHAT WERE THOSE 2 GUYS DOING. IT WAS A LONG ASS GAME AND ONLY MY FRIEND AND I WERE REPAIRING.
---
I would actually pay to see what they were up to all the match time.
---
It would make multiple perks useless *by design*, and throw the game off balance completely.  
---
Discord is not part of the game's design, therefore it doesn't need to be considered when balancing the game.  
---
If they decided to add voice chat into the game, they would need to rework almost the entirety of the game to make it balanced. Having the killer be able to hear you if they're nearby is not even close to being enough.
---
No billy love D:
---
He might seem slow, hut he's actually faster on his feet than any other killer :P
---
toxic or not, it got a chuckle out of me
---
You can use iy only once it PTB too
---
+1 to you. 
---
new nightmare
---
greetings smoothskin...
---
Well I wasn‚Äôt thinking as in-depth as others are. For me, I was thinking from the killers aspect being able to find survivors like me that don‚Äôt shut their mouth.
---
&gt;Decisive
---
One last hurrah, eh?
---
Oink. 
---
Am i the only person in the world who thinks this is just as much a buff as it is a nerf? The killer won‚Äôt know you have it. The biggest downside is it‚Äôs useless against Moris. But isn‚Äôt everything?
---
Ahahaha eyyyyy
---
Doing generators, you?
---
maybe it depends on the amount of  of chaser and malicious.  You got all of the gens so he didnt get very much gatekeeper and because he bled all of the survivors he didnt get any Devout. Most likely he black piped instead of deranked
---
Swap wraith and pig and you're good
---
if he downed you at the hook I think you have more than time to get to a pallet or window and even if you cant its a perk slot to another.
---
I‚Äôd probably get banned for just being annoying when something startled me, so I‚Äôd mute myself to save everyone else the earache If voice chat was part of the game. 
---
Still it punishes him for being a dick no derank for him
---
Legion is definitely worse then Doc
---
Meghed
---
As a LF main I wish they would but due to licensing issues and the contract they made it would be really difficult.
---
If you put hag in A i would agree 100%
---
Was expecting this comment, well done
---
ULTIMATELY I'M NOT EVEN MAD I'M JUST REALLY SAD THAT SURVIVORS KEEP GETTING NERFED. WATCHING THE DEVS DO IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER HAS MADE ME REALLY NOT EVEN WANT TO PLAY THE GAME. EVERYONE KEEPS SAYING IT'S IN THE NAME OF "BALANCE" BUT THERE IS SO MUCH SHIT THAT THEY'RE DOING/HAVE DONE THAT ISN'T MAKING IT BALANCED, IT'S MAKING THE GAME ONE SIDED. ALSO PALLETS ARE UNUSABLE UNLESS YOU'RE FAR ENOUGH AHEAD OF THE KILLER TO STAND THERE TO DROP IT, BUT DOING IT IN MOTION IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE AND EVEN WHEN i'M IN IN AN OPTIMAL POSITION I STILL GET HIT THROUGH THE PALLET EVERY TIME. AND ALSO FUCK THE HIT BOXES IN THIS GAME. I JUST HAVE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS BECAUSE i USED TO LOVE THIS GAME AND I'VE SPENT A TON OF MONEY ON IT AND NOW I BARELY PLAY IT AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE WASTED A TON OF MONEY AND THE DEVS REALLY JUST DGAF.
---
I didn‚Äôt know this game was Mac compatible!
---
Ohhhhh, I didn‚Äôt know the Brand New Part was nerfed. Can someone tell me how it used to behave? 
---
I think killers who just stand still and keep swinging are players that disconnected or crashed and the game didn't get cancelled. It's a bug that happens sometimes. If the player is truly just afk, the killer is not doing anything. I've bumped into those swinging killers many times and not one has ever come out of it. Killers that stood still doing nothing eventually have started moving for me.
---
They already added for default character why not for other survivor so sad.
---
Whenever I farm I use legion or Freddy. 
---
I used to DC when the killer would face camp, but now I utilize the opportunity to help my teammates get 2+ gens done.
---
I once had a someone message me ‚Äúgl‚Äù before the match started. Turns out, he was a legion main and face camped me. I got pretty tilted, but didn‚Äôt DC. 
---
When you get a nurse like that you are just participating as an NPC in their single player game.
---
117 if you're a respectable person and doesn't play legion
---
If you create a lobby and put on the iron chuckles mask you can kinda seen him
---
Who cares? Even she was a prominent streamer with a large audience (probably not), no one is going to possibly remember you. 
---
Don't give a random teammate's opinion weight just because you heard it. 
---
I can go all day but I tend to keep my sessions to 3-4 hours. I don‚Äôt solo que though I either play SWF or killer.
---
But....but...but... i wanna t-bag
---
You people can stop acting like DS is useless now, you know. It lasts for a full minute after an unhook. That‚Äôs about twice as long as it should be. You still have a god tier perk there. 
---
0.75s of stun time is kinda too small window of opportunity to get anywhere unless you were dropped right next to the window/pallet
---
Then you'll all be making loud vomiting sounds? That's not even including her ultra rare that would reveal your auras
---
They‚Äôre literally changing this next update, don‚Äôt worry
---
Myers billy nea and specifically bald dwight
---
A Perk for a Perk
---
So I actually laughed my ass off last game the killer was running NoED.
---
- Killer didn't ready up.
---
- Three generators pop almost immediately.
---
- I'm working on my second Gen, am not paying attention getting properly paranoid, miss skill check.
---
- Doors get powered, three of us escape.
---
- Last guy decides getting the hatch is better than just moving on to the next game.
---
- Bing bong, bing bong.
---
- No One Escapes Death.
---
- Guy who got greedy gets nothing.
---
- Killer says in post game chat he went to the bathroom when no one was in lobby and got distracted by his wife on his way back to the game.
---
This is why the hatch just isn't worth it people.
---
Honestly, play Legion with Iridicent Button and either the Green addon for Duration or the Green Mixtape for Speed and let me know how often on average you break pallets with that addon. 
---
It‚Äôs primary use is turning your terror radius global to keep track of everyone. The pallet breaking is more of a throwaway effect because it‚Äôs a very rare situation where someone will throw a pallet once they either know you have the addon or if you just happen to leave all pallets down and run back to some areas with Killer Instinct active. 
---
You can read about patches and nerfs at https://forum.deadbydaylight.com
---
I can play for a lot of hours but after two hours or so I‚Äôm playing pretty braindead
---
It's what Alyssa thinks she looks like 
---
The first time I ran into ruin, I got one skill check the entire Gen.  Wasn't even a Freddy. 
---
Geb is a mess
---
I posted this on another thread, but I‚Äôm so jumpy that I‚Äôd cry out when startled and get banned for abusing the ears of other players, so I‚Äôd mute myself. 
---
If I could give you gold I'd hand it over
---
I am not toxic. Why would I? If I don't feel good playing a game I can just stop exposing myself to it and do sth that makes me happy.
---
I think the existence and discussion  of elements of the game shouldn't be based on toxicity of the community.
---
What was the exact details on how the old brand new part worked?
---
I feel like, to be an equivalent of BBQ, it should give a nice power to it. Like a We‚Äôll make it (BT would be too OP and they farm even more) 
---
*^^grrr* ^^i ^^just ^^get ^^so ^^fuckin ^^angery ^^when ^^i'm ^^forced ^^to ^^read ^^shit ^^i ^^don't ^^like
---
r/wooooosh
---
Not exactly, as people often take Enduring just for the sole purpose of eating pallets, plus there is an extremely effective combo of Enduring + Spirit Fury. It was the same way before, I'm just sad that it's not really anti-tunneling perk THAT much
---
Easy to say. But with this amount of map pressure plus no chase time ruin being active that long is simply adding insult to injury
---
Memba when Killers didn't need to hook Survivors to Mori them?  I Memba
---
Yes, for me this was it. Took me just a couple matches to actually see that it didn't work that way.
---
It is still a good perk against Spirit, Nurse etc..
---
YES SIR o7
---
I was doing it for shits and giggles with one gen left quiet wraith had Thrill so I said screw it and it was haunted. I immediately realized I was a jackass for doing so. I ran him around for the whole duration but I wouldn't dare to imagine the pain everyone else felt from it
---
Once you get to tear 15 and up he becomes trash he is only really good against new survivers who don't know what to do
---
always blown away at the great lengths people will go to just to win a video game.
---
Wow, wraigth above hillbilly?? This is a bad tier list
---
It will end, but with everyone DEAD (or hatch whatever) 
---
They probably won't use Enduring that's true
---
I'd add a number 10
---
10) he/she's a noob and thinks that by hitting you, you'll get sacrificed faster. 
---
i use noed in my build cause i dont have ruin ( i cant slow down the game just lil bit) usually get one or two after the gates are powered... so noed gets the job done
---
I think nurse is fine. But the amount of blinks shouldn't be modifiable or come with stronger drawbacks. There is just to much room for compensation. In my opinion that is.
---
Intresting
---
Killer main here 
---
They haven‚Äôt added other faces because they didn‚Äôt negotiate it into their contract. They also couldn‚Äôt make faces for licensed survivors like Bill or Quentin. They would also have to go back and pay the company that owns LF more money to add in some cosmetics. Just be happy leatherface has more than his default and bloody cosmetics.
---
They‚Äôre clientside, so it only relates to FPS, not your connection 
---
But if you see a Pig, Billy or clown Lmao u better pray
---
First time? 
---
Play SWF there‚Äôs your fix.
---
Billy gets looped though. I think Spirit is actually more of an issue, especially with Mother-Daughter Ring and Manna Prayer Beads
---
You can rebind your keys on the in-game menu on PS4 and they have a sensitivity slider as well.
---
Are you on PC? 
---
First time in front of two survivors.
---
then the killer remakes the lobby bcuz nobody likes playing against SWF. the devs could easily fix this perk but it hasn't been for years
---
yea that was my point. Or Trapper or Wraith or Myers or Bubba :D Basically any 115% ms killer who wants to make pallets more delicious to eat
---
You can't really counter a Legion. Just play the game, get points and accept your death
---
What is arrow key Hillbilly?
---
I do see how console hates ruin though. I played with my friend on console a few times cause dbd was free on ps4, and it was way harder for me to hit the skillchecks on there then pc.
---
The thing is that some do it when there are all gens undone and of course people were working on them and the same player that destroyed Ruin obviously goes for the other totem. Suddenly Exposed, survivors drop down like crops :)) 
---
You will be missed
---
Hyper-immersed noobs are a staple of the 15+ ranks.
---
They just sit in corners crouching hoping to never see the killer lol.
---
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE POWER ROLE AND SNOWBALLING IS THE BEST WAY TO DEFEAT "THE MANY". KILLERS THAT DON'T SNOWBALL DON'T WIN.
---
Fair, I can see why Doc wouldn‚Äôt be fun for some people. 
---
What?  Fighting games aren‚Äôt particularly elitist at all, I‚Äôd say the exact opposite.  Fighting games have a very small community because it‚Äôs very hard to learn, and every fighting game has people working on resources to make it easier as well as people eager to help
---
Thanks. Are totems less likely to be cleansed on match start now?
---
Come on season 6
---
Freddy didn't need a nerf. New (and probably a bunch of old) players just didn't take the time to learn to play against him before saying he was OP. Even the devs admitted they reacted too quickly and changed/nerfed him before giving the community a chance to learn how he works. 
---
Why they haven't reversed the nerf, in that case, Idk. But they still agreed they were too hasty.
---
Can't 4 gens technically still be done in 2 minutes? 3 survs do 1 each for 80 seconds. All 3 tag team the fourth for 30-ish seconds.
---
No?
---
DON'T FORGET ABOUT HIDING IN GENERATOR AURAS. THEY CHANGED AURA COLORS JUST TO MAKE THAT EASIER.
---
If you don‚Äôt like getting farmed the longer wait times are worth it. 
---
I dunno facing SWF is fun for me because unlike those who solo que they actually provide a challenge.
---
The masks for the original survivors was part of the licensing agreement.
---
Yesterday i got my 2nd killer adept achievement being adept trapper my 2nd main. Really proud of it because i got it on thompson house.
---
The best way to counter Leigon is to try to make distance as much as possible and try not to throw down pallets too early. Whenever they use Frenzy it removes scratchmarks, so try to break line of sight if you catch them using it and sneak.
---
#Laughs in Dead by Daylight on Ps4
---
Please clap.
---
Toxicity shouldn‚Äôt dictate balance for either times. Also nurse gen times don‚Äôt matter to nurse. Omega blink nurse with ruin and sloppy butcher means that you can‚Äôt heal cause that‚Äôs a waste of time and gens will be annoying to do cause trying to find ruin on the game, swamp, lerys, etc. takes too long. 
---
STAND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A WINDOW. A KILLER CAN HIT YOU. THAT'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT THAN BEING HIT AFTER VAULTING. WINDOWS AREN'T FIFTY FEET ACROSS, DEAL WITH IT AND VAULT SOONER.
---
TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. BUT IF YOUR GONNA PLAY LIKE A PEICE OF SHIT AT LEAST DONT HIDE FROM IT. JUST MY OPINION I GUESS.
---
Yes. I just used 2 minutes as a blanket time. Back in the days of op BNP if all 4 SWF had it amd they all split up 4 gens could pop in as little as 15 seconds. Then they could meet up for the last gen and be out the gate in around 3 or 4 minutes everygame
---
It'd be so much fun if killers could choose whether or not that could be voice chat. I'd like the Dwights to know I'm coming for them &gt;:D
---
Jesus christ lol
---
Doing gens, you?
---
People should learn how easy it is to counter ruin by yknow, sticking to gens. If you find it, cool. You don't need to. 
---
What was the nerf, havent played for a while.
---
One OP add on. Because his other ones, especially iridescent, are garbage.
---
With a lot of spirit players I‚Äôve noticed you can make them mind game themselves. Such as camping a down pallet they‚Äôll phase to one side thinking you‚Äôll quiet vault it and same with windows. Another trick that works for me is if they start phasing in mid chase just run back exactly the way you came from but be carful not to bump in to them during their phase.
---
Legion, just DC 
---
The need to add a "kill vs. AI" option with an easy mode so these people can get their stomps in. It's clear they don't want a challenge, so this playlist would accomplish that.
---
you obviously use this perk to teamkill other survivors. there is literally no other reason someone would be dumb enough to defend any changes against a penalty for unsafe hooks with WGLF
---
It really depends. Cuz most nurse players slug all 4 to end the game quick. The ranking system punishes that playstyle in the PTB.
---
None of the killers are scary besides the nurse. The people here talking about Myers being scary just want to fuck him. The horror in this game was gone long before Legion existed, they're just an easy target.
---
The only time I use items is to get rid of them when I'm about to prestige someone. So I'd rather prestige than get another 100 brown medkits to add to the 857 I already have.
---
What exactly macbook have you ? And how working Dead by daylight on macbook ?
---
I feel ya. I platniumed DBD on ps4 before i switched to PC i feel your struggle fam
---
Oh man, this was a while ago, before hag I‚Äôm pretty sure. It wasn‚Äôt amazing compared to today‚Äôs standards, but back then it almost halved the cool down time on a successful hit. It just got worse and worse after that.
---
I'd rather go through the fun of learning her myself :&gt;
---
Mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine
---
I WENT FROM PLAYING THIS GAME FOR HOURS EVERY DAY TO HAVING NOT TOUCHED IT IN OVER A MONTH. BUGS ARE INSANE. PALLETS ARE USELESS, HIT BOXES ARE 4 TIMES THE SIZE OF YOUR CHARACTER, AND THE DEVS JUST KEEP NERFING SURVIVORS INTO THE GROUND IN THE GUISE OF "BALANCE". I USED TO BE A VERY KILLER MINDED SURVIVOR MAIN AND USUALLY AGREED WITH KILLERS, BUT THIS SHIT FEELS LIKE IT'S GETTING OUT OF HAND. AND THE DEVS LITERALLY JUST DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF THEY LOSE PLAYERS, WHICH IS EQUALLY AS INFURIATING. I'M USUALLY SO EXCITED TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY AGAINST NEW KILLERS AND THE PLAGUE LOOKS FUCKING TIGHT, BUT I'M JUST SO OVER THE LACK OF CONCERN FOR THE SURVIVOR BASE THAT I GENUINELY JUST DO NOT WANT TO PLAY ANYMORE. HEARING THE COMMUNITY NEVER SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT WHO'S THE MOST TOXIC WHEN BOTH SIDES FUCKING SUCK IS MADDENING AS WELL. I'M NOT EVEN MAD THOUGH. I'M MOSTLY JUST SAD THAT THE GAME THAT USED TO BE MY FAVORITE GAME ULTIMATELY BECAME THE GAME I TOUCH THE LEAST.
---
Do they? Seems a little silly. Just get what you need. 
---
IS THAT A FUCKIN' JOJO REFERENCE?
---
I gotchu fam
---
nothing is wrong with the perk, its the player using it without borrowed time to blame i guess.
---
since it seems you run into this with people farming you within the killers terror radius 
---
you could use the offering spawning you farthest from the killer and use the perk that shows killer aura when breaking pallets/kicking gens. 
---
Freddy was never OP, he just had a high kill rate right at launch so the devs sort of panicked and nerfed him. He wasn't too much different than he is now, I don't even remember what the nerfs were tbh.
---
Purple flashlight + odd bulb + intense halogen was OP as fuck, you could get a full blind in about a third of a second. You could literally blind killers when you're just running around in the open if you had the flashlight pre-aimed at the right place. It was also back when the pickup animation speed was much slower, so people could sprint burst in from a mile away and only need a fraction of a second to get the save. Basically if you wanted to pick up someone you had downed, you would need to search in like a 40 m radius to make sure no one with an instablind was nearby, which made games where you would go without any hooks at all when playing against a coordinated SWF team a very real possibility.
---
It was so OP, in fact, that just a few days after the director of the game, Mathieu Cote, played against some survivors at an event in Korea that were abusing the insta-blind, BHVR announced they were going to nerf flashlights.
---
It's pretty glorious, you can see it here. 2:08 is where the insta-blinds really kick in:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R98e-Y4Lu8w
---
One solution is the killer starts throwing things at them. Or knocks over the obstacle if possible. Or walks away and jumps out when the victim starts looking for the exit.
---
To let last survivor take the hatch or to avoid being moried
---
This spot right there seems to always spawn a totem. Well maybe not always but pretty high chance of having one.
---
Yes when I play Doctor I cheat, using Carter's Spark, totally not Doctor's built-in power that he is supposed to use. No, that power is for sure a cheat. 
---
It's good, but nothing like it used to be. When the game first released you could use Self-care, bottany knowledge and a medkit to heal faster than the killer could recover. 
---
I guess man, what the actual fuck hahahaha.
---
Ive deranked a few time because playing rank 1 gets frustrating and survivors are useless compared to rank 6ish. I dc against legions. If a teammate is pointless i wont go out my way to save them. Like ill save them if they are about to go into struggle or die. But doing gens is more important than wasting time to save someone who wont do anything anyways. I used to run ds but play with people who dont and it kinda opened my eyes to other perks i could be using instead of ds every game. Ive played legion a few times. And hated myself everytime. Because 4king with legion is easy especially with third seal and ruin. I have stopped playing legion like a few days after they came out. And will only play for dailies but i feel sick. These are the worst things i do and im so sorry for all but dcing against legions and sandbagging useless teammates
---
The other one always seems to be the other spot you can drop in, the one with more blue drums
---
Back then the game actually was VERY killer sided, there was so much wrong with the game that the devs wanted to make it easier for the survives.
---
Thanks legion
---
Next update: Hex totems wont spawn 32-meters from spawned survivor
---
Me: Spawns 2 rooms from the bathroom, walks in Hex 
---
BANG 1-min in game 
---
Killer: DCCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDc
---
Toxic survivors as usual. XD
---
Who would have though that people don't like getting downed with zero counter play. 
---
Thanks for calling attention to it, actually. We NeEd oUR hAtCH
---
That's a big yikes
---
BING BONG  
---
Legion loses his frenzy charges if u hit him in the head with a pallet, unless he is walking at u, make sure to hit him with a pallet. If you aren't in an injured state, literally take the hit as u wait at the pallet and then hit him. Then run away.
---
But I can just use Calm Spirit and I don't scream from the doctor. Does this not counter him? 
---
Very predictable map. One other totem spawn is left side of one of the steps that's surrounded by wooden crates and a pallet.
---
Well... if that isn't passive aggressive, then I don't know what is.
---
I feel like they can‚Äôt really get the balance right. I remember F13 having the same issue as well. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è something about serial killer games I suppose 
---
Don't forget, the Entity turned her into a Boomer. 
---
PSA:  
---
If your game seems to be stuck while loading hit CTRL+ALT+DEL to open task manager and see if Dead by Daylight has stopped responding. If it has, YOU are the problem. Close your game and everyone else will load. 
---
It's mostly because it's a 4v1 asymmetrical game. They need to make it so the majority dosent have control over the game, but they likewise need to make it possible for the 4 to actually win.
---
Spirit you have to use Stealth and try to counter-mindgame her when she uses her power by relying on her ability to see scratchmarks. If you know she has Prayer Beads I suggest gen-tapping; since it will keep her from getting a grab.
---
Legion has no counter. 
---
The most you can try is Quick and Quiet to leap into a locker and hope they leave, or break LOS after they hit you with Feral Frenzy. However both of these strategies are difficult to pull off and are hard-countered by Bloodhound.
---
You may take my Hex, but I'll also have your Balanced Landing! Oh, wait, it recharges? **Shit**.
---
That's not true. You can absolutely use add ons and offerings. Just no other perks. 
---
Enduring has more value then just that.
---
Right? There goes my entire setup phase. 
---
Balance the killer around this omfg 
---
Do people even read anymore 
---
*HEADPHONE USER WARNING*
---
It gets a little disheartening sometimes. There was 20 seconds more of this before i actually hit record and at the start, i was close to the hatch. I might have had a chance to escape! &gt;.&lt;
---
doesnt mean it makes ds unviable
---
I see that tag, frank gang!
---
Nice idea actually. I think this is worth a thought. Because it would allow her to remain strong but also punish fuck ups.
---
The fuck does this have to do with dbd
---
Freddy missing from the list, needs his own tier: ‚ÄúIs legally not allowed to be alone with children‚Äù
---
Yeah, it's probably a brand thing. Hopefuly most new killers are original to the game so they can be altered for our entertainment.
---
I still dont think that having a weathered mask for Myers, torn clothes or mental institute clothes under the same mask will break the character. Rusty kithen knife?
---
Anyway. It probably wont happen.
---
When you‚Äôre a survivor main but you decide to play killer for a game
---
Usually it takes a week after the ptb goes down. It's just their standard protocol.
---
Killer:
---
Doc, Billy and Nurse but I also play a lot of Hag and Huntress
---
Surv:
---
Ace &amp; Claudette (claud just to flex my pink pants tbh)
---
She has a cosmetic in the charity case and is known by BHVR. I don't know why the devs choose to represent people who are somewhat toxic
---
*Speaking as a Freddy main*
---
He needed to be nerfed. He was complete cancer. Only because his terror radius was 16 meters so running M&amp;A made him absolutely ridiculous. I said it then and I'll say it now. 
---
However, I also said he should only be nerfed WHILE AT THE SAME TIME receiving a buff of some sort. But the devs wanted to be crowd-pleasers instead of do what was right for the game at the time. Thankfully they learned. 
---
They're cold.
---
What was the machine gun build?
---
What is he suppose to do in your opinion? (Genuinely asking). Just walk up to the killer and accept defeat? Attempt to heal the slugged guy? Do a gen? 
---
I considered putting hag in A tier because I definitely see how she can be great in the right hands but I have still yet to see someone use her correctly. Also, I‚Äôve never really played hag outside of doing a daily because of how annoying she can be to play against. So I guess I made a mistake there
---
que sad song
---
I can recommend watching Ryan, Scott and Zubat streams if you have time.
---
(Ryanpez69, ScottJund, ZubatLEL)
---
Zubat and Scott also have YouTube.
---
Also a few others I consider really good like Quixotic, but he also has some "interesting" qualities (not hating on him btw, I mean his choices of perks)
---
Heal the slugged guy and do a gen? As I said there was only one gen left and the killer wasn't camping the slugged guy
---
Your welcome to an opinion, even if It's wrong.
---
Don‚Äôt be hating on Tinkerer, that shit on billy is scary.
---
Do you realise what a change like this is? Survivors being able to communicate permanently would be too op. Everyone knows the killer, the perks (as soon as its shown to one), the totem spawns, who is running to a hook, if anyone has a key or an insta heal, where the hatch is, what gens are getting done and where to heal. This would render so many survivor perks like bond, selfcare and everything that shows auras, as well as keys (accept for opening the hatch) and pretty much also maps and a big part medkits unneccessary to get its effects. To balance this you would basically have to give everyone the power of peek a boo myers, which would basically make the game an exact copy of friday 13th
---
I seem to recall on launch he was always visible unless you used an add-on, and the next came with him flickering in and out of view during the transition.
---
Mate try hitting a great when your framerate drops to 15 fps
---
If ever the only "counter" people say a killer has is to hide so the killer can't find you, that's just confirmation from them that the killer is broken, whether they realize it or not. I say that because hiding is NOT a weakness of the Nurse. It's a weakness for ANY killer (sans Doctor whose power is built around easy finds). 
---
So no, that isn't a Nurse counter. It's a killer counter. And if that's the only counter someone suggests, that inadvertently confirms her power has no weakness or counter-play. 
---
Basically Legion on Feral Frenzy when you use Unrelenting and Save the Best for Last on any killer
---
I agree
---
I think more killers should have scary addons that make you panic
---
I have played this game for a couple years now and I am still scared sometimes, because I can immerse myself, especially if playing a Myers, pig or spirit. I feel like people DONT want to immerse themselves anymore, not necessarily that the game isn‚Äôt scary enough anymore, they just decide to play in a way that is boring to me... ‚Äúlet‚Äôs all group up and I‚Äôll try to find the killer and get him to chase me while I teabag and you do gens‚Äù... it makes me smile when I play killer and I get these teams, because I know as soon as I mori them, or tombstone one of them. They begin to crumble 
---
Every killer should have a threatening tool like this. You shouldn‚Äôt WANT a killer to chase you. Sure it‚Äôs a game, but it‚Äôs not in the spirit (no pun intended) of this game. 
---
Then again, that‚Äôs just my opinion 
---
Yes. Clown gang is the best gang. I‚Äôm currently a Santa main. 
---
For the state of the balance of the game, no she is not. 
---
Toxicity has no place in balance whatsoever. It does, however, help us find what can be unbalanced sometimes. Like how insta-blinds did. 
---
I am way being try talent and he once said you can counter the nurse by having urban evasion, dead hard and iron will.
---
IMO All of these perks are okay but the setup is based in you being hit at least once and funding the resulting moment to end the chase in your favours. So you have 3 secind window to make your perks count. If you manage to do so however You are exhausted for 40s so can't risk another chase and you also lose time healing. If she runs sloppy butcher, it's highly unlikely to lose her AND the gets your pressure away from the gens. 
---
To repeat what I said above, people who need an excuse because they can‚Äôt do skill checks 
---
Biggest new player mistake is being too afraid of the killer, just a bit of the terror radius can stop them from repairing again for like 30 seconds. Don‚Äôt be too nervous and scared of it, have a plan and you‚Äôll be alright don‚Äôt hide too often if he is not directly there.
---
You gotta run Overcharge, silly!
---
Dude even people with thousands of hours dumped into playin survivor (noob3, puppers) still get absolutely fucked by a good nurse. Unless you get lerys, you are fucked vs a good nurse
---
You never seen fan art before?
---
The best-- complaining about noed even though you can stop it
---
F sorry friend
---
Survivors are still stronger overall. 
---
I actually had Clown and Doc together at C tier for a bit but since I‚Äôm a clown main I had to do him justice by moving him up. He‚Äôs just too good in the chase when the bottles are in the right hands. 
---
Hillbilly's power doesn't necessarily help in a chase though. A good survivor can loop a Billy just fine. But he excels at catching survivors in bad spots due to movement speed and he punishes mistakes that are made VERY hard. But ultimately, if you run him like the M1 killer he pretty much is, he can't do much more to you than any other killer. 
---
He can't even really bloodlust at a pallet for a chainsaw unless you're really bad. 
---
Usually is a way of telling they are angry at you.
---
Sometimes when you are the last one it is just to do something, with the legion I like to do it because of the increased attack speed and with the hag I like to spank survivors.
---
You telling me you‚Äôve never been jumpscared by a scratched mirror Myers? A pig? A spirit with prayer beads? 
---
Hell, I get tense and scared while running from a Myers who pops ew3, especially if I found out he has tombstone lol. 
---
They need to give all killers something that can create this type of scare for survivors
---
What happened
---
We dont speak about the machine gun build, not since...
---
That actually wouldn‚Äôt work, nobody would fall asleep during the trial it‚Äôs only 10 minutes so he can‚Äôt affect them.
---
I like the wordplay here.
---
The hero we needed thx
---
That's accounted for with tinkerer. 
---
THIS!  it all comes down to:
---
You get made fun of for trying to win= tryhard/sweaty etc
---
You get made fun of for being bad= Garbage, potato, etc
---
So it pays to be mediocre because everyone gets a participation trophy.
---
My rule is when I am killer, I try to play the game "fair" but then the teabaggin starts so i will tunnel and camp.  
---
As a survivor I dont teabag or taunt because the player is probably new to the game.
---
Cleanse totems if you think noed if strong. You can literally remove it from the game before it activates.
---
I'm not mad since i could not hit it anyways
---
Did you have to complete a difficult skill check to complete it instantly? Kind of like how it is now?
---
May I see your Steam library and se ehow many games aren't even installed before you judge me? :D
---
Imagine all the kinky things she could do with this many hands.
---
Did you have to complete a difficult skill check for it to work? Or was there no challenge at all? 
---
EMBRACE THE SUN
---
Thanks though!
---
Shortform: if that was the case survivors wouldnt need 90% of what they can use to survive and to balance you would have ro turn the game into a copy of friday 13th
---
It‚Äôs me.
---
Honestly I've actually always liked facing Legion... I mean, the best way to verse him is to split up and do gens seperately to counter both Discordance and his detection abilities, which isn't too hard to do usually considering how big a lot of the maps are in this game. Also, they rely on you focusing a lot more on looping (Something I've always been bad at and generally don't rely on heavily...) then you should. The best way to counter a Legion is just to pallet stun them mid-Feral Frenzy. It causes them to lose all of their Feral charge in an instant. Hell, even doing the good ole' throwing down a pallet and jumping over it immediately as their vault animation finishes works really well on them.
---
Also, if you have a movement ability like Sprint Burst, Lithe or Balanced equipped, it's not impossible to get away from them and hide off somewhere to mend and dab out. They don't see scratch marks in Feral, so if you can break LoS long enough to hold up behind a rock or something, you're gucci sauce. By the time you finish mending, even if they does find you again after finishing, they forces a normal chase since their ability probably won't be up again, and then they'd also have to get the three hits. It wouldn't be worth it for them.
---
Personally I just focus on getting pallet slams while being chased by Legion. I know this only works so well depending on the map and all due to pallet spawns, but it can work if you know how to time it.
---
Perhaps the biggest flaw in the scoring system is that it RIDICULOUSLY punishes whoever gets found and chased 1st.  The 1st person who gets found and chased is almost guaranteed to get bad scores for Lightbringer and Altruism because you can't do gens while getting chased and cannot heal/unhook others while being chased.
---
Sadly, the best way to Pip is to hide until someone else becomes the 1st target.
---
i see nothing wrong with this list it's 100 percent correct 
---
Ooh, good one, I forgot about that.  
---
Hardly anyone gets in trouble for DCing. If you‚Äôre not leaving in 90% of your games, you don‚Äôt have to worry about anything.
---
^ this. SWF is broken because of that communication. If 1 person knows something, everyone knows. It‚Äôs incredibly broken and frustrating, and just like you mentioned it would render so many perks as useless. Aftercare, Bond, Kindred, Empathy, all of these would be trash. 
---
This would also kinda indirectly nerf Freddy. Instead of blowing up a gen or fail a healing skill check to wake up you can just meet up with another survivor so you can wake up, and all it takes is a little ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at killer shack, come wake me up‚Äù
---
Theres more than one? I dont really remember any other perk that does that. Lightweight reduces the time scratches are visible for the killer, but not dissappear as a whole.
---
I always reported it as griefing I think the griefing report button says working with the killer in the description. Make sure you have video evidence and also look at their accounts and screenshot that. You'll have to have all of this for them to do anything. I got two people banned a few weeks ago because 3 of us were working on gens and the other survivor would find us throw a pallet down and block me until the killer got there. The killer would stand there while they worked on stuff and the door. Went out of their way to kill everyone else. I had all of it recorded so it was easy.
---
Doing an entire Gen + trying to open an Exit gate with only 2 people left is often unrealistic.  In that case it becomes a game of try to find the escape hatch so you can Survive.  Healing the teammate goes against this since if you want to escape through the hatch you need the other teammate to die.
---
Cool, enjoy yourself like those who‚Äôll buy it will enjoy themselves. No need to be bitter
---
Yes. As a killer main most of the time, I'm thankful that survivors tend to group up early in the game. It's much better for survivors to spread out and work individually, especially if one or two can cross the map at the start to prevent a 3 gen. 
---
I thought this was going to be about Bond, which I've never seen anybody but sandbagging pieces of shit use.
---
People will farm you with or without WGLF. It doesn't need to be nerfed or under new requirements when survivors already get jackshit for BP
---
Unpopular Opinion time:
---
I think that the last two killers have left a lot to be desired. Legion is a bad killer but has no counterplay (seriously how does that even happen)
---
And the Plague looks like a cheap version of the Huntress only with a big ass range, hitbox, plus 115% movement speed. Then you put those green addons on her and she moves faster when you hold her vomit attack. So you can just get close to survivors, put them in the broken state, and down them easily.
---
I don't know. Spirit and Clown were well designed killers for the most part. Legion and Plague have design flaws to them that need to be addressed
---
Ever since bhvr bought the rights of starbreeze the game every new killer feels bland and boring. 
---
Jane Romero's perk does that. Scratch marks disappear for 10 seconds after a gen is completed.
---
Holy shit how fuckin' frail do you have to be to fly that far off the handle over a suggestion in a video game.
---
It's not disconnecting if the game crashes before you load in and you have to DC on purpose A LOT to be banned if it's even possible.
---
Preach it 
---
Rip? More like good riddance
---
Most tilt inducing shrine ever. Even if Overwhelming presence isn't good it's just as annoying to play against.
---
You should probably go cry some more about how posting like an asshole gets you downvoted.
---
Lighting def needs work but I assume thats going to be later on after you texture and finish up the map. Also think the grass should be overall shorter with small outcrops of taller grass in certain areas. Interesting map design so far at this angle
---
We really need a mori that's just hands/tentacles bursting out of the ground and dragging the survivors to hell.
---
Lmao. On average we got 3 d strikes in one match. I wouldn't call the new ds a nerf, it's a huge counter to big tunnelers. Now 4 players can benefit instead of just 1 per match. If killers try to slug well all just take unbreakable or tenacity.  I'm super excited for new d strike before all the new killers label it as OP and toxic again. 
---
Yup
---
What you said
---
GOMU GOMU NO JET GATTLING 
---
But what a fun way to go down.  Haha
---
# Oink.
---
You sure? My apologies then. Every time I've ever tried going for adept achievements and getting a 4 man with add ons, Ive never gotten it. 
---
Depends which killer you play, nurse is s++ and if her user is good she is unstoppable. People like bubba and trapper on the other hand really don't have the same map pressure/mind game potential.
---
Biggest was a few weeks ago on the sub where a user traced a drawing and posted as their own.
---
The thing is that all communication features are outside of the game which they can‚Äôt control. PSN parties, Xbox parties, Skype, discord whatever else people use to communicate they can‚Äôt control. Friday the 13th has in game voice coms that you needed a walkie talkie and be in range of others to hear, but still being in a party outside the game negates them and make them unnecessary. There‚Äôs no way that Behavior can take control over people communicating with each other. 
---
when you are running 1 hit hatchet huntress, and after the first hit everybody disconnects.
---
I can agree with that. Hag could definitely be A tier. 
---
But people use discord to talk. You can't have a perk that just blocks your computer programms.
---
I'm wailing at some of these 
---
Id swap clown and pig and put huntress above clown but I agree with the tier list
---
It's why I hate Hexes in the first place. Very few of them feel powerful enough to warrant the chance of them flat out not doing anything for the entire game.
---
I'm really hoping Corrupted Intervention is good, that means I can take Ruin off for good.
---
Myers doesn‚Äôt deserve to be rank A. He is easily looped and had little nap pressure. Hag should be higher, as well. 
---
For some reason people are very upset that The Plague technically didn‚Äôt willingly kill anyone before being taken by the entity.

---
Amazing...every word of what you just said was wrong
---
Make solo survivors have at least *similar* attributes as SWF groups (eg making kindred baseline) so that the gap is closed. Then buff killers accordingly so that instead of buffing killers to battle 4 man SWF groups and making the game completely unfair and unfun for solo survivors, they're buffing killers to battle all survivors, regardless of anything else.
---
There will always be a difference between SWF groups and solo queueing but as it stands, the gap is too big to make everything fair. Killers will lose to a good SWF squad but solo survivor teams will get destroyed by the killer with little chance of escaping at all. If the gap were closed this wouldn't always be the case. 
---
&gt;Save the Best for Last
---
I'm gonna stop you right there.
---
ah i see you want the Meter on screen 
---
exhaustion / borrowed time timer, 3 seconds might be minuscule to them to put effort into implementing this tho.
---
But we never know according to the people that attended the Bevhr invite they claim the devs are planning a lot of things this year so you might get lucky 
---
Tinkerer used to make ability affecting charge addons be more effective,for Huntress that meant you could take hatchets out faster and wind up faster too.With some addons you could throw them super fast.It was basically a instadown if you ask me.
---
Not very excited honestly. But its still better than another knife wielding mentally unstable human. I want more supernatural killers (Nurse, Wraith, Spirit) even a few non human killers would be appreciated. *desperately wanting Eldritch inspired chapter*
---
Thats "Literal Machinegun Huntress" build with old Tinkerer. I think machinegun M1 and that never co-existed together.
---
SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE A REAL KILLER IF THEYVE KILLED YOU ENOUGH TO GET THAT MUCH SALT OUT OF YOU
---
This actually made me shed a tear
---
J
---
Could you link the template pls? :)
---
they need to add in game chat to encourage people not using party chat/discord, then make it so the killer can hear it based on proximity. 
---
Ya you can use add ons and offerings. I have gotten others I just had a mori on the pig and didnt know you had to get 3 sacrifices at least. 
---
Myers is definitely A. He has some of the most powerful add-ons in the game, plus his terror radius is so small he basically has to be on top of you before you hear him. 
---
Example if you have no idea what I'm talking about " *There is a vast monster of a man with a hideous grin torn across the mask that keeps stalking my every move. Similar to a hunter, he tracks us, priming devastating traps amongst the greenery. Extreme vigilance and a light step is essential in avoiding the blood-curdling clench of a bear trap or the clutches of what I've taken to calling "The Miserable Smiling Killer". I have but many times managed to get caught in one of these traps. I have nothing but a fear for the feeling of blunt trap spikes grinding against my bones or for the heavy and deliberate footsteps which always inevitably reveal a plastered, sadistic grin. With the traps and the Trapper, it has so far been a constant battle between looking up and looking down.* "
---
Won't be missed
---
This gives me PTSD RIP Freddy 
---
This is so sad.. can we buff noed.
---
I miss them also. Even if they want to get the quote from someone else
---
It isnt ingame chat that is used so this wouldnt work. 
---
Hmm. I didn't know about that. I'll look out for it next time. 
---
Oh did i? My bad sorry i did this between classes. I feel like myers is a tier because how little awareness people seem to have at my rank
---
Bro idk ab y‚Äôall but huntress‚Äô movie (imo) would be fuckin awesome, and why would a nurse movie be bad??? I would like to see sally strangle an entire asylums worth of insane patients!
---
What? The PTB feedback of "this killer is shit worse than Freddy plz buff?"
---
Hate to be "that guy" but... if you think it's so easy why don't you do it? Behavior doesn't have a magic "make Legion not shit" switch that they can flip to suddenly balance the Killer and fix all the exploits associated with them. Even the Moonwalking Exploit alone isn't just an easy "poke 3 lines of code" sort of thing. There are a lot of layers of issues with Legion and while a large portion of them are caused by Behavior (I think the issue with addons like Frank's Mix Tape and Legion's general weakness without addons is a problem on Behavior's behalf) Bugs and Exploits are not something Behavior could've forseen. Even if they were reported during the PTB (which I can assure you they weren't, or at least any bug reports were lost under all the "Legion worse than Freddy 4head" comments) chances are they had a release date (possible agreement with Sony/Microsoft or possibly just an internal thing) that they had to meet and simply didn't have the time to fix the bug without causing a major delay on the chapter, which arguably would've pissed off a lot more people.
---
Legion has a lot of problems and a lot of those problems could've been avoided with proper foresight on Behavior's part. But saying that Legion as a concept couldn't have worked is flat out false, and we need only look at Nurse for proof of that. I think the initial design of Legion is flawed and that the Killer needs a reason to break pallets. But the idea of "Killer who can vault pallets / windows and puts a debuff on you instead of downing you" is perfectly workable.
---
And you need to split up to loop the killer and do gens at the same time
---
That and infinites and double pallet spawns on jungle gyms, infinite sabotage shit made me wonder why I even got any kills in the first place. If SWF wanted to mess you up,  they would mess you up. Once we did it on a group of 4 after the killer (you can see them before,  and we knew that was the exact same person with the same perks)  camped us all. We decided to bring 4 bnps, all the while saboing whatever hook we saw before using them. That Myers did not get a single hook, and no one pipped. I personally felt disgusting afterwards. 
---
This happened to me about 2 hours ago against a trapper. My heart broke the second the totem broke. It was half a second after I did the last gen.
---
Shit happens ... so what
---
Im a killer main and i still think its op. It was better when only the tier 3 had insta down. Its either op or useless
---
Is there somewhere i can read the rest of these?
---
Google the cult of Dwight steam page. 
---
You‚Äôre right,but they have different lores, like billy kills to protect his territory and LF kills cause he‚Äôs scared
---
How do you make a perk iridescent?
---
Hiding in a bush more like 
---
I agree. I guess it really does boil down to the user. I think the issue is that survivors rely heavily on teamwork, and 75% of the time, nobody works together, so it just creates a shit show. 
---
Accurate. The devs don't seem to know how to make decent lore anymore. I mean maybe it's from all the licensed DLCs that came out all around the same time? 
---
You made it clear! Roxxxy Andrews is found shaking. 
---
I FORGOT TRAPPER AND WRAITH! But trapper would be c and wraith would be very low c or high d imo
---
I see that and ruin. Ruin mostly. 
---
Truthfully I was really disappointed that Pig couldn't set up traps around the map. When I heard of a SAW Killer my immediate thought was an ability to trap windows and pallets to damage / slow down Survivors who vaulted through them. I love what we actually got (it would've been a crime not to include the Reverse Bear Traps I must admit) but I think there was a lot of missed potential with a SAW Killer.
---
I hope they visit the concept of a proper Trap Killer. Or rework Trapper to be less dog shit.
---
Yeah, after rank reset i played a match and all 3 of my teammates attempted instantly and didn't bother struggling. Needless to say i can't rank up when playing with people like that.
---
The only issue I have is that Spirit and Clown were *not* well designed killers for the most part. 
---
‚ÄúIm gummy bear! Gummy bear! I‚Äôm a Gummy Be-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEEE!!‚Äù
---
How's they rebuff ol' Fred? 
---
I've always disliked ripped jeans. Worn by too many hipsters in my middle school.
---
I just like that the killer is unaware if the person has it. So they have to be concerned each time vs just targeting one person.
---
That‚Äôs the worst. Hopefully the killer was nice? üòÖ I honestly don‚Äôt main either side, I‚Äôd say I play both evenly, but I would always just farm with the survivor at that point because it‚Äôs just so annoying to everyone involved. 
---
Interesting. Do you play xbox or PC?
---
Yikes what a little tryhard. 
---
Putting any other killer in the same bracket as nurse invalidates any opinion you have. Huntress is not in the same tier as hillbilly. Pig is C tier, so is doc because niether have decisive abilities. Trapper is B because instadowns and zoning during loops. Adiris is C because shes very predictable and can get denied her pools by SWF and never get the second hit in.
---
Isn‚Äôt  adrenaline free with the base game? 
---
His top addons require survivors to let him stalk them for extended amounts of time, which good survivors will not allow. Even at tier 3 his entire power is negated by people knowing how to do basic loops and run jungle gyms, which is extremely common in high ranks. 
---
As a killer main who is dragged into playing survivor fairly often I think that regardless of which side I'm on, this perk is going to be interesting and potentially fun to have in match
---
Ps4

Idk legion is just 4 edgy kids who killed a person. Not that interesting. Probably 1K movies like that already. Huntress abducting kids and an epic battle scene with her mom being killed would be a lot better than legion
---
And here's my guide to countering annoying, skilless facecampers!: download mlga. 
---
Also if the new ranking system comes out, I don't think you'll be able to pip playing this way.  
---
I mean to be fair Michael doesn't kill kids. He did have that one kill in the new movie that I won't spoil but there's also a scene in the new movie where he passes up a kill that I won't spoil.
---
If you had really young kids Mikey would just creepily stare at them all night but he wouldn't pull out a knife. I just don't know if I'd be comfortable paying him.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Yes I want a meter ! I hope devs are gonna read this thread please !
---
I mean her lore says that she *did* actually try to keep her people healthy. The thing is just that it's 2000 BC and no one knew what the fuck an antibiotic was.
---
You have to fiil a meter of puke or decay or whatever
---
So like if you're RIGHT BEHIND them, you can fill the meter super fast, but it's just about the same as leatherface or billy if you do it like that
---
i remember a buddy of mine as super gone (high) that he read a Fake patch note list stating that "Yoinks" and "Can of Whoop as" were going to be the best fucking perks this game has ever seen.....
---
we just sat there in chat and laughed our asses off as he continued reading the descriptions and updates till we told him those were not real resulting in him getting sad 
---
Becoming the game's best anti-tunneling perk ain't exactly dying, you know.
---
Who pays for free dlc? 
---
To be a little more detailed you'd trying a Skillcheck every 2 seconds and it either finished the Gen by 10 - 15% (don't clearly remember) for great or 5% for a good Skillcheck. So it was essentially possible for 4 Gens to be done in 10 - 15 seconds or something like that.
---
I definitely don‚Äôt think it was a buff, granted I rarely tunnel players at all. I‚Äôm happy because I doubt I‚Äôll see it in game against me and if it is then I deserve it for tunneling
---
Me and my buddy both like using dark sense a lot. Also alert but I don‚Äôt think that one is too underrated.
---
Ok yeah it might just be a difference between play styles for Console vs. PC. I play PC.
---
Sure are. 
---
But this next patch will be the closest they've ever been. Assuming the new tiles aren't crazy. 
---
This lovely Dwight you see in the messages here decided he wanted to be a asshole this game. On my first hook he walked over just tbagging and pointing till I struggled and bleed out. After that ran around with the killer pointing out all his teammates until the killer carried him to a door and he escaped. 
---
Either way trapper would be mediocre, since all he does is trap people, and billy is less of a rip off so I put him in decent
---
R.I.P Kira shouldn‚Äôt have turned around
---
That's fair, I can respect that.
---
How much does interacting with a puked on object fill it? Because on one hand being hurt just for playing the game would suck, but on the other if the Killer is no where near you you can just have people heal you back up.
---
Or does it give you Broken as well?
---
Only use I see in bond is awareness when a teammate is running a killer near by and and easier way to line up flashlight saves. Empathy is better than bond for that anyways imo.
---
Lmao just git gud if you can't play against a facecamper, just gen rush and only around 2 people die
---
I based it off lore and idea of the killer. For example spirit‚Äôs backstory wouldn‚Äôt make a good movie but the idea is pretty cool
---
Oh yeah that's another thing.  The killer has 0 idea who has it. Lol
---
To this day, my cold little black heart warms for just a moment watching that. 
---
Didnt know freddy had a sibling
---
Those people are stupid as fuck. We have lots of killers who didnt willingly kill anyone
---
Teleportation is a cool ability in dbd, but I feel it‚Äôd be boring in a movie
---
Sounds like he was having a great time, why did yoy have to tell himüòÇüòÇ
---
If you need NOED to get kills then you shouldn't use it IMO
---
Bond is okay, Its useful, but as other person said i much rather have empathy. Empathy covers the whole map at max rank, and when someone is hit you see where they are so you can kind of tell where the killer is with it too, and of course being able to go to your teammates and heal them.
---
So that's the new agitation buff huh
---
I think bond works better. Bond is always active. It‚Äôs good especially if you‚Äôre not running self care. And the whole empathy is better debate doesn‚Äôt make sense bc if a teammate gets hit and you don‚Äôt see them with bond then you know the killer is nowhere near you. Bond is a god tier perk imo
---
Unrelenting? You should‚Äôve put Sloppy.
---
To this day, my favorite way to play is to loop, break line of sight as they kick the pallet, leave faux-scratch marks by turning a walking after I pass an object, and high-tailing it in the opposite direction as the killer runs passed. So I prefer some stealth as well. But it won't work against a competent killer. Especially one with working headphones. 
---
I got a new headset recently and I can actually hear Michael coming and survivors breathing. If a player uses the audio, stealth is not an option. 
---
its amusing, but as time goes by is harder to explain to people because of all the extra requirements for it to work &gt;_&gt;
---
Reminds me of that one girl in outlast 2
---
I really like Alert and Windows of Opportunity.
---
Tip number 1: using NOED won't help you improve your skills as killer. 
---
"Hee hee ecks dee Fired Up nerf plz."
---
"NO PATRICK DON'T-"
---
[*"Hello my name is Mathieu Cote and today we are nerfing Fired Up because of reports of it being too strong we appreciate your feedback and think we did a pretty good job so far go play Civ Freddy mains."*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYS0EeaAUMw)
---
Pretty much luck. Countless times I haven‚Äôt gotten a flashlight save cause I did it a millisecond too early or too late.
---
Walk up. M2. Space bar. Gen done. 
---
No skill check. Period. 
---
Well I said a show would fit them more, and have it focus on the currently blank slate personality of the other three (Julie Susie and Joey), as well as the personal battle between not killing and supporting frank 
---
Next patch will be stridor, thanatophobia, sloppy hutcher, and hex ruin. Use BBQ ill rank 4 then swap to this till rank 1. Rank 1 will be harder to get next season.
---
Yah and if it‚Äôs a tier list where going left to right = best to worst in a tier then essentially I‚Äôd say B tier should be reversed. I can see pig being B tier, but she definitely ain‚Äôt better than Clown or Myers.
---
I love using Lightweight because I think it is severely underrated and I just like being able to run without worrying too much about the scratch marks. Also I've juked the killer so many times with it. Heh
---
This is why every new player should run bond over self care. Bond gives you away to get healed from teammates, and lets you know if the that nearby terror radius is already chasing someone cause that nearby guy is running in a circle. 
---
I dont see why they would need to do that. The fact that survivors dont know what all the others are doing is the only thing forcing survivors to make decisions. Like: Do I get this guy off the hook? Do I look for the ruin? Do I look for other people to heal me or do I just go on a gen? Do I try to get more gens while the only other survivor is getting chased or do I try getting more gens?
---
Making these decisions is basically the biggest of the 3 things survivors must do besides surviving chases and doing objectives. Even when I play with my friend I am still forced to most of these decisions, yet not all of them. Taking the decisions away from the survivors would remove the small percentage of horror the game has left
---
Nurse with no perks or addons is stronger than maxed out spirit easilly.
---
That's kinda the whole point it punishes campers and makes them think twice.
---
and now you're calling me dumb as fuck. preaching about "no toxicity" and "inclusive environments" yet you're as toxic as the people you hate.
---
I'm here to argue Wraith's placement.
---
I love his power because it's the ability to have information. Information makes me feel powerful so it appeals to my tastes as a player. But his power needs to do something in a chase. 
---
Hopefully the rework will adhere to that. 
---
And complaining about everything
---
As usual I don't think it'll effect Billy, nurse, spirit mains bc they dont need to tunnel but I would think itd effect mid tier killers a lot. Maybe Tunnelers will take make your choice instead.  I'm super curious to see how it  goes and changes the game! 
---
You get broken once the puke meter is filled
---
Throwing up on objects only lasts like 20 seconds
---
Once you're sick the meter SLOWLY fills and you infect anything you interact with (including players)
---
You remove all the sickness (and heal broken status if you have it from the puke) at any of the fountains or pools or whatever
---
As far as how much the interacting with puke objects filling the meter ? I never actually noticed, it doesn't seem like too much but if you're at zero it's enough to get sick so you tend to avoid it as much as possible
---
When a survivor tbags I camp. But I am a nice killer sometimes. Last game with Freddy I had 3 ppl DCing for nothing (I got Meg first time from a locker) and they DCed. I let the last guy do 2 gens and then he got away after he gave me a few pallents. Sometimes I just love to camp stupid survivors who think they are funny with their cool CTRL.. but sometimes, I love to be nice. I do let the last guy get the hatch too. And I do use NOED too, but I like to think I am nice 50% - 50%
---
Don't walk in tall grass against trapper lol
---
Was that sarcastic or not? Depending on your answer you‚Äôll get downvotes or upvotes.
---
That meme died years ago.
---
PLAY CLAUDETTE 5HEAD
---
I dunno, I have no problem stopping people in high ranks. 
---
Idk...if I see Herman on the big screen I might just have to risk it all so maybe no 
---
I played a bit,I don't think it increases the plague meter at all if you already got puked on.Might be wrong though.
---
Also if you try to heal someone after a certain level of plague progress you get the infection too.Definitely happened to me after I unhooked someone and tried to heal,got sickened too.
---
You still don‚Äôt get that extra cosmetic AND you just lost  like a really expensive cosmetic for any character. Buying characters with shards is dumb unless you don‚Äôt have a reliable source of income. 
---
Bond at tier 3 allows you to see survivor auras  at 32 meters, so if someone looks like they are getting chased you should know when to dip, this can be replaced by Empathy since it has a greater range but only shows aura of Wounded survivors. 
---
if your running perks like leader/prove thyself you might wanna stick to bond  so you can actually use those perks 
---
ah but they are nerfing empathy with 2.6 from tier 3 infinite range to 64/98/128
---
It's the killer objective
---
Just Git gud lol 
---
Lightweight is one of those insanely underrated perks, I feel like. 
---
YOU DIDNT SEE THE P3 CLAUDETTE IN THE TALL GRAS
---
Unfortunately this is going to end this summer once dedicated servers are added.
---
In your opinion, would you say a perk like Diversion only that you could "throw" scratchmarks would be a neat thing?
---
I guess I would pick this even if it would be an exhaustion perk...
---
GOTTA DISCONNECT TO MAKE THOSE SWEET JUKE MONTAGES
---
Imagine paying for free entertainment 
---
I sometimes use no one left behind for the extra blood points towards end game. Of course you can combo this with other perks! 
---
never leave the campfire without it
---
I'm currently taking a break from the game. I main both, and each are getting too toxic
---
Me and my gf both use dark sense when we SWF because we can both work away from the killer if separated it's a really underrated one! 
---
Maybe the Entity took her because of her strong emotions? She felt responsible for taking care of Babylon, yet she herself ended up sick. I can only imagine the despair she felt in that cave when she was covered in vomit, pus, and all types of nasty things, realizing how she has failed her mission to care for the people that looked up to her. 
---
Not all Killers willingly killed before being chosen by the Entity. Both Hag and Spirit had to be chosen and given powers before they could have their revenge. However this story seems to be different because Plague felt helplessness, as opposed to the other two who felt dread and deep hatred for those that tried to kill them.
---
Feng Min has great teachables tbh Alert is always a good one 
---
It will never die, only true dbd fans appreciate lol
---
I have this happen many times on console. I feel like BHVR doesn't care as long as they don't hack game assets like prestige or items or cosmetics or whatever 
---
Interesting fact of the day: 
---
Some/most people are casual gamers and a balanced game would make it much more appealing to them. 
---
Now this is normally where I'd bash the remake all together but you get a pass on this one. 
---
Daddy Ace and Huntress&amp;Nurse(sometimes)
---
.
---
yup, sorry for misinformation on my part 
---
‚ÄúFreddy is the movie.‚Äù All I remembered when I read that was, ‚ÄúWELCOME TO PRIME TIME BITCH.‚Äù
---
This is by far the most toxic community I've been a part of and that's coming from someone who regularly plays Overwatch. I have countless messages calling me everything in the book in my inbox from playing killer. 
---
So uh.... since you‚Äôve decided to say this, how exactly do you survive in a chase against legion exactly? I just want your opinion since you‚Äôre out here telling people to get good, so you must be able to last at least 2 minutes in a chase against legion... like sometimes at least.
---
But Legion is the only killer I have true fun whilst playing. ;w;
---
Best Mori for Devour Hope.
---
Also gotta get those 28 stab wounds before downing anyone.
---
That's how it should be, yes, but in the state the game is currently in, solos and SWF are unbalanced and its not fair to buff killers and make it unfair to solo survivors. There is no other way to close the gap and make the game decent for both sides. 
---
Learn to deal with my THICC drunky boi
---
I often just get facecamped at the start of games. It complete ruins the experience to wait 20 minutes for a lobby, get caught within the first minute, and stay on hook because teammates are too afraid to get me, or get sandbagged and tunneled because the killer just wants an easy kill. 
---
It's DANCE OFF with Myers!!!
---

---
Sadly not since I can't hit a hatchet to save my life and only play her because she's my second favourite aesthetically. uwu 
---
I actually enjoy salty pms. I find them entertaining and love sharing them to my friends but not soo much when my teammates decide to throw my matches. 
---
r/forhonor
---
U is for useless
---
The only thing about the change that could be considered a buff is that a killer can't tell if anyone had DS now until they use it, so they can't really take preventive steps. BUT everything else is a nerf, lower stun time, short window of time that its activated, and you have to be tunneled to use it in the first place now. It really only punishes  tunneling which is something a lot of killers try not to do anyway.
---
128 meters will pretty much cover any whole map unless you guys are on complete opposite corners so its not that bad.
---
His gaming chair ist just better xD #Sarcasm #IKnowItsProbablyLagSwitching
---
That one hurt .-.
---
Good bye mr mlga :) Now youre gonna have to play against some real killers :)
---
What if they can see two people on just one gen left and are waiting to open the door for them? I‚Äôve done that recently since my whole team died at an exit that was too slow to open (two including me died near the door, the last girl got lost and couldn‚Äôt find the other door - she actually ran right by it).  Somehow Michael got us all. (I had already been hooked and so had at least one other girl.) I never do it to intentionally to screw over other players. I think they know that since they see me at generators and trying to heal/unhook them.  My character is in all pastel so she‚Äôs hard to miss. When I was ready at the door, we barely all limped out of there in time.
---
But if someone just hung out by the exit the whole game? That seems so boring and pointless. How can that be fun for them? 
---
Ps4-Nuse blink- i can't see passed the corn 
---
LOLOLOL
---
I honestly think the movies would be great if they followed the lore of the killers. Maybe not about their powers but eh, them as a person. Not sure about the spirit tho since her movie would pretty much be another spooky ghost flick, we don't need anymore of them thanks. 
---
Would kill to see a huntress movie mind you. She'd be a good sympathetic villain/killer (if you know the backstory that is.) 
---
I still think it should cause exhaustion.
---
Invisible traps? 
---
This would be amazing but seems too easy for Killer.  With night Vision a Killer could see the Survivor from across 1/2 the map.  Likewise, would be super easy to see all 4 Survivors since the light from a flashlight would super stand out
---
Nah you still get bonus points from unsafe hooks
---
It has to generate a complete trajectory yes. But 
---
Imagine it combined with "quick and quiet" and "dance with me".
---
That would make for some really nice playes...
---
You know how long that takes to do space coconut 
---
What sort of galaxy brain legions are you playing against where he isn‚Äôt downing you in under 15 seconds with franks mixtape?
---
the daily that requires me to loot a chest and escape with the item.
---
i cannot for the life of me complete that daily, i always get killed when i try to do it.
---
I'm a Quentin main so cosmetics don't mean much.
---
Shards is basically free money. I don't have to spend a dollar and I get free content just for playing a game I love, I don't see how that's dumb?
---
Damn u right. My bad. I havent rly played against a good trapper yet so thats why hes so low
---
cheers mate 
---
\-a trapper main
---
I can only speak from my experience:
---
If I play solo I sometimes get shitty teammates. Sometimes I get great teammates.
---
If I play swf with my friend we sometimes get good teammates. But sometimes they are shitty. Then being swf doesnt help us a bit. I get farmed, I get tunnled, noone does gens.
---
There is a difference between swf and solo, but if its not a 4 man swf its not that bad. Of cause if you fight a 4man swf as a killer you are fucked if they know what they are doing. A genrush is predestined. So if you ask me: Buffing solo is not the way. You cant buff solo without also buffing swf or making survivors too op. The devs should try their best to nerf swf or/and maybe give some boni for people that play solo. Like a bunch of bonus bloodpoints to get people to play solo more often
---
&gt; unhooking 
---
You mean "safe unhooking", right? This is rather important to me, as that would discourage farming your team even more.
---
Also OoO allows you to see wraith until he's right up on you while cloaked. Must have something to do with the terror radius. Just a side note. :P
---
I do know because i do it all the fucking time. Hell half the time I run small game and make it my mission to cleanse all the totems. It really doesn't take as long as you think, especially if your teammates are cleansing the ones they see. People just run by totems instead of spending a few seconds cleansing them when they see them and then complain about NODED being fucking OP. Its actual insanity. 
---
What about this is fan art? Its just a generic meme.
---
Brutal strength and STBFL make clown a chase monster, even if brutal strength doesn‚Äôt give a crazy bonus anymore.
---
&gt;STOP DISCONNECTING ~~RIGHT AFTER YOU GET DOWNED FIRST. YOU SCREW YOUR WHOLE TEAM OVER FOR THE REST OF THE MATCH! ONE OF US IS COMING TO RESCUE YOU,~~ YOU IDIOT!!

Oh shit a new Fatal Frame sequel
---
I guess it's just differing opinion but I specifically like Legion for three things: I can go fast, I can stab a lot of people with little downtime and Their Mori is just Godlike for those rare times when I can actually get DH stacked up.
---
When playing killer I don't really look for killing potential and more for "How much can I toy with my victims" if that makes sense?
---
Nurse gang got your back. We'll ignore game mechanics together
---
Okay but unhooking a survivor only for it to be Freddy would be amazing.
---
" 10am, time to sleep "
---
-tosses a bottle of chloroform at the child-
---
I did that on purpose. Pig is better than Myers and clown imo. Her ability to mind game in the chase by using her height and crouching then using speed boost to catch survivors/force down pallets is great. Not even to mention her main ability which is to slow the game down with the reverse traps. 
---
i take the 2 add ons that increase the amount of traps he can carry and pray someone steps on em 3 times 
---
i've had this done on a path on haddonfield and it was funny as hell, survivor messged me calling me a dick 
---
I‚Äôve been enjoying running no-noed trapper. Gives me a perk through the whole game and extra time vs experienced survivors. This is due to everyone assuming trapper = noed and go around searching for and cleansing totems.
---
So I get a perk and extra time out of the deal, lol.
---
Yeah, I play Doc or Pig mostly, and I'm starting to get into Myers a bit more.
---
Despite the fact that he's considered low tier, I just find that Doc's messing with people tends to get me the most kills and I just love his psychotic laugh.
---
Ah wonderful! We'll welcome all the support we can be shunned together
---
F is for Freddy!
---
Im a lvl 1 trapper, so i dont have a single addon. Sadly
---
But SBFL is actually good now
---
No one? I dunno...I think a lot of people would find someone freaking out over DbD entertaining.
---
Hell that was pretty much Hexy/Sxyhxy's gimmick. Tru as well. Freaking out over balance/perks/SWF/Optimal survivors/Billy and Nurse etc..,
---
I got done with a match this morning as the Wraith (Mori ritual), and I had just put on all-seeing for the first time. One gen left, one person dead from the Mori, one dying on hook. All the way across the map is a gen at maybe 75%; if someone had been working on it while I was walking there, they coulda popped the gen. I didn't have BBQ, but this P3 Claudette knew I had All-Seeing (or she should have known), just crouching next to a window.)
---
Neither her nor Jeff escaped because of that immersed playstyle.
---
Yeah man, who wouldn‚Äôt of thought of a super diseased high priestess from thousands of years ago who uses her vomit and incense burner as a weapon. And who wouldn‚Äôt think about her vomit needing to be cleansed at small holy fountains which the priestess could use to turn her vomit into super deadly blood vomit.
---
One of them was probably a Claudette crouched behind a rock/tree the whole game, and the other I'm guessing was a Dwight that got caught switching lockers.
---
Frank's Mixtape disagrees.
---
Geez I'm sorry. Yeah they like to take it too far when they're really angry. I had a guy just last week sending me fake links to YouTube and another link saying he wanted to gift me a gift card if I let his friends live. Me being curious decided to use a free VPN and see what the links were to. Turns out he was trying to obtain my IP address to try and get my location for which I hope was just to threaten and scare me. He kept saying stuff like "how's the weather in Michigan" and "I heard traffic is real bad on Elder Rd". Thinking he had my address. Lol
---
Shiva the Destroyer up in this bitch
---
I used to think this was my least favorite one until I realized you could vulture an item off of another player.
---
Usually get it the first game I survive now.
---
Take pig down to D tier you silly console player. Wraith is C here, trapper is C here, legion should be swapped with leatherface.
---
It worked against legion because healing didn‚Äôt matter since he was a 110 killer and his power didn‚Äôt care about the first health state. With the plague, you do need to heal. 
---
The plague is a 115 killer and if she gets a corrupted purge then you‚Äôre gonna go down in one hit (not like it matters tho unless there‚Äôs 2 of y‚Äôall and y‚Äôall both go down). Not healing against the plague isn‚Äôt gonna be the smartest choice when it actually will leave you liable to being one shot in comparison to legion, where running no mither was actually a good thing against him.
---
The initial tier lists were tier lists. Then came the joke tier lists. Then came the dear horse beating that this sub loves to get into with literally everything.
---
Alert.
---
But I don't blame you for forgetting that one :P
---
the wiki isnt always up to date
---
As freddy is in his own dimension or whatever you wanna call it , Aura related perks will not work outside of it 
---
Ultra add on btw 
---
Good for you! Very glad you did
---
They‚Äôre so bad on PS4, one guy face camped me because I dropped a firecracker at a pallet after his bullshit lag hit me through it. P3 billy as well, like you need to camp with such an easy killer.
---
You forgot: pallets are no longer a thing. But now guns can be found in their place. Pick up the gun to stun the killer for .1 seconds. This will injure the player who uses the gun and takes 100 seconds to load a gun and shoot.
---
When I started playing this game I thought Empathy was good.
---
Then I tried Bond.
---
Never took Empathy again. 
---
Bond forever.
---
He‚Äôs using GEForce and it runs the game pretty smoothly, I have a Mac myself and I use boot camp and it works just as well
---
I'm excited for the Plague. The last two ranged killers didn't interest me but I like her design. You're entitled to your opinion but I think you should probably chill.
---
That laugh just gets me
---
Just play killer with BBQ then, I get average 40-60k as hillbilly per match, easily.
---

Pro tip: ignore flashlight clickers,they WANT to be chased and won't do gens, it's perfect

Delete

One is a taunt, whereas the other is actively preventing another person from playing the game. Whenever someone tea bags me I just hit them a couple times after I hook them, or nod furiously at them. I've even lost a game because I wasted time tea bagging a guy back as pig. There are plenty of things you can do as a killer to emote back at a survivor, without actively ruining the experience for other players. It trivialized the match for the other survivors as well, even though they had nothing to do with it.
---
Just asked if anyone else had the same opinion as me so
---
Save the best for last, i dont see people use it. Like, ever.
---
Quick and quiet, lightweight and iron will are so good for that I realized 
---
Well I am a Freddy main too, so I like this list :D even if it is not 100% true. 
---
10% of the time its always there..
---
It's looking pretty nice so far. I'd love to see some community maps in the game. Team Fortress 2 has done this a lot in the past with some of the maps players have made so it would be awesome to see the same thing in Dead By Daylight.
---
Woken
---
I mean, if ‚Äúone is a taunt‚Äù then you‚Äôve achieved your objective. You wanted the attention, and now you have it. 
---
An eye for an eye. 
---
On the official DbD Website as well as on the DbD wiki :)
---
Yeah at least Billy's best addons are Carb Tuning Guide/Doom Engravings, no pink addons at all for Billy Willy, and even his purple addons are pretty shitty
---
I think the timer should pause when you're in a chase / down. Right now if you're even alright at running it probably wont work unless the killer is camping
---
Some thoughts of my own.
---
Boil over. I would go in the opposite direction and buff the numbers. Say 50/75/100% and not show hook auras within 24m or at all. I think right now it doesn't do enough to help you and as a killer main, 14m is a joke. That's visual distance. I don't need an aura for that.
---
Alert. On paper it sounds like this perk helps but it actually doesn't. Seeing the killers aura when they are not after you doesn't matter. It just provides you with peace of mind. It's a, "oh good, killer is away busy somewhere else". So what you do in game isn't affected. If the killer is on their way to you, they are heading straight there. So I just personally think that the perk doesn't help you and maybe we can change it dramatically, like tinkerer.
---
Territorial. I think 40/48m is too far. That's not enough time to get back there after the unhook. You won't be able to catch anybody. Maybe there is something else we can do? Maybe keep most of it the same but allow killer to see the aura of those in the basement for a longer period, even after they leave?
---
i think the "nerf" actually makes DS much more enjoyable and rewarding because it makes hook tunneling, a thing survivors kinda hate, useless
---
Well not every killer plays like you or me. 
---
only, good one is territorial imperative
---
A quentin main? I'm so sorry
---
‚ÄúDisappeared?  Ugh!  You go out to grab some cigarettes for 10 minutes, get a little bit sidetracked, and never come into contact your family again for 8 years, and people suddenly start throwing around these crazy exaggerations!  This bullshit is making my head hurt, I need to get some cigarettes.  I‚Äôll be back in 10 minutes.
---
The daily that involves bear trap kills with pig as for me they are hard to pull of
---
Think you picked the wrong flair buddy
---
D for sure . High ranks out play her every time . Only low ranks have an issue vs her .
---
No one shows the crispy boi any mercy :(
---
Don't mean to be rude here but this exact question has been asked and answered 500 times on this subreddit. You could scroll down and find 13 of them back to back. More than likely Tuesday. 
---
If I read Alert buff right, you want it to reveal killer while survivor is in his terror radius. But that will counter any mindgames killer can do during the chase. Red glow tricks, double backing, etc. - all this will be gone. Too strong for a single perk. Too strong for anything really. Constant aura reveal is too strong in general.
---
The rest of ideas are pretty good. I'd also like to see your take on the Monstrous Shrine. 
---
*Now here's the story from A to Z*
---
I rarely ever see the same killer tbh now that the playerbase is so much bigger. If a lf facecamper comes by tho I can always just leave the match or suicide :). Is facecamping how you define real killers lol. 
---
*Now here's the story from A to Z - you wanna get with me, you better repair expertly* 
---
Yeah, this is why no one should ever ready up on ping that high. I‚Äôm sure the killer wasn‚Äôt having a grand time either. 
---
Good killers don‚Äôt tunnel 
---
He run
---
The alert change seems really unnecessary and would hurt survivors that go against a doc or killers that use unnerving presence for example. Diversion should change on it's own, I don't want to use 2 perk slots to make the pebble work and be efficient.
---
Bloodhound combined with sloppy butcher,cause scratch marks are overrated
---
Hi, rank 5 survivor reporting in! It doesn‚Äôt take too long? Now teach me how to loop properly pls
---
I'm confused, devs said that crows are the only animals in the Fog and yet Billy has 4 whole bunnies on his vest
---
Now here's the story from A to Z
---
You wanna get with me, you better repair expertly 
---
We rarely do it, but we had searched for game for a long time soo we gave it a shot
---
i thought it was only 1 bear trap kill, but i can see how it would be difficult without the speed up addons or tunneling the poor survivor lol 
---
It's hardly an eye for an eye if one guy pushes the Ctrl button at you a couple times, and you respond by trivializing the entire match for four other players. If some guy taunts you it doesn't really justify ruining the match for everyone else.
---
STOP TEABAGGING AT THE EXIT GATES. ACTUALLY, STOP TEABAGGING IN GENERAL. WHAT THE FUCK IS THE POINT OF IT BESIDES WASTING EVERYBODYS FUCKING TIME
---
Oddly enough... they confirmed my homosexuality.
---
Mori challenges on killers without mori.  Or chase a survivor for 3 minutes as the Hillbilly (I end chases in like 4 seconds lol)
---
Survivor escape and survivor or be chased for 2 minutes on my level 1 Claudette or Feng. These challenges wouldn‚Äôt be bad if they were for my main or some other survivor I actually have leveled up but no give me challenges for the survivors I have never touched.
---
Haven't found em ü§∑ literally scrolled down "don't mean to be rude" butttttt
---
Ok i understand and thanks for help
---
For..?
---
I get a beanie and free DLC, You?
---
Disrespect for disrespect. 
---
The other three can power though gens and escape; I‚Äôd hardly call that a ruined game. 
---
One fucks over gameplay; the other doesn't do anything in itself. Getting mad at teabagging is entirely in my control. I don't mind teabagging as they're just wasting steps in a loop.

As a LF main I‚Äôm offended that you just say ‚Äúsome hook‚Äù you bring em to the basement.

I‚Äôll check.  But the call out was with a second post displaying the original.  I‚Äôve seen some pretty brave plays using graph paper.  But this was almost a straight trace on a light table lol.
---
I hate noed!
---
180 seconds of Co-Op actions, because it is literally broken.
---
Notta; Alert would count you as in the terror radius when the Killer's aura is revealed. 
---
So if the Killer breaks something across the map and you have Diversion or Stake Out, you would get 5 seconds of charge time and hear the heartbeat during that time.
---
whats the acronym for MLGA for? still new to DBD.
---
Yeah but the only issue with crouching at pallet loops to get a hit is that the survivors can just straight up run away from the loop as soon as you crouch to a different one and they‚Äôre good. Her reverse bear traps can be good, but more often then not they buy too little time for what they‚Äôre worth. Myers and clown on the other hand have beautiful lethality, with Myers being able to flip matches on their head with a good EW3 and otherwise being a stock killer with a really low terror radius, and clown being able to end chases super quickly with his gas.
---
All three killers are utility killers, but imo pig is the worst of the three due to having her main power be RNG based, her addons are crap, her ambush has little use in a chase unless you‚Äôre in an enclosed space,and apart from her ambush (which is weak in the chase) she has nothing to help in a chase. 
---
Myers and clown are killers that don‚Äôt rely on RNG, and their abilities allow them to consistently snowball through matches once they get going. They have good chase powers and their addons are pretty good as well, Fragrant Tuft, both Tombstones, and RPF on clown are all powerful addons that give the killer a massive advantage
---
This would certainly explain a lot. I may just be an idiot, but I've had a handful of games recently where I'm running Small Game scour the entire map for Devour Hope and can only find 1 dull left. Haven't had the issue with Ruin, just Devour Hope in particular.
---
r/woosh
---
For his face
---
- RNG is usually the cause of these cases. Some pallets or windows are very poorly placed simply by bad luck but in the same way you can have pallet and window placements that are incredibly safe and can provide survivors with an almost infinite looping spot against killers.
---
- It provides a false sense of security to less experienced survivors. Less experienced survivors will usually run to any pallet and try to loop a killer or use it against a killer. Its like a trap almost. Experienced survivors can recognise how dangerous a pallet or window placement is and will either avoid it or simply use it to stun/gain distance over a killer in hope of reaching a more secure pallet.
---
- Unsafe pallets provide killers with a chance to mind game survivors or outsmart a survivor. It stops killers from having to constantly break every pallet they see as some of these pallets provide the killer with a chance to trap a survivor and get a free hit.
---
I suppose at the end of the day its more or less to provide a trap for survivors that immediately dash for any pallet and to allow for killers to have a chance at using mind games to catch out a survivor
---
I'm more about personality but you do you fam
---
You had to tap Spacebar, yeah? Or am I combining my memories of the insta heal addons with BNP?
---
Is this a joke list?
---
"Don't you guys have phones" was the statement made by the Developer on stage at Blizzcon this past year, when Diabo: Immortal was announced for mobile, and nothing announced for Diablo on PC, and the audience booed them and basically chewed them a new ass, Live.
---
Before then it was instant! I think it's the most tweaked addon in the game.
---
The new killer talk. Hope when they rework him they give him a few lines or at least let him say "Bitch!" when he get stunned.
---
No it wouldn't, because lore doesn't affect playstyle. Claudette is most toxic and she's a goodie two shoes student.
---
Never remind me of those times.
---
I‚Äôm a console player, and I think the whole daily ritual thing would be awesome if they reworked it to be a kind of mission board where you choose what you want to do from a list of dailies, weeklies, monthlies, etc.  there is just so little in the game to do as far as ‚Äúprogress‚Äù goes.  I‚Äôve leveled up the characters I like and that‚Äôs pretty much it.  It would be nice if the rituals were tied to some kind of reward system where you get exclusive cosmetics or items by completing them.  If they ever make a DBD2, something like this should be implemented.  Just make the whole thing feel more interactive, more rewarding.  Vermintide is a good example of this kind of thing done right.
---
They dont even talk in dbd and are literally just skins but okay üòÇüòÇüòÇ 
---
Similar to this, on PS4, I have had moments where a survivor isn‚Äôt struggling but once I try to hook them I am hit with extreme struggling to the point where it makes hooking impossible.
---
Is that lag switching too?
---
Which, to be fair, isn't a wholly unjustified reaction. If a developer made video lies, feels kinda fucked.
---
This is why I love Empathy (Bond too). Having awareness of the killer's location most of the time is so good.
---
"Oh, the killer is on the other side of the map? I'll finish this gen then".
---
No this is a step by step guide to greatness
---
...... i give up on you lol
---
Gay
---
Im sorry :(
---
Basically it only procs if you get downed w/i 60 seconds of an unhook. Then you get the option on pick up. It's now an anti-tunnel perk and generally better
---
Yeah I see your point, I just want to be able to play solo survivor without wanting to rip my hair out because of my teammates. 
---
A way to dodge killers that you dont like playing against, for example the large survivor streamers usually dodge killers who doesnt give them the hatch or plays nurse. Very cheap way to play the game
---
I hate him even more then fengmin screaming
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Safe unhooks are so unreliable though. I've had teammates killed feet away from the hook and still got the safe unhook. 
---
That's probably overkill at that point tbh. Lmao
---
It'd likely be smarter to PURPOSELY make a vault sound and then throw it while crouch walking the opposite direction, similar to how one can try to bluff a Spirit by purposely fast vaulting and then quiet vaulting back through the same window. 
---
You don't see any difference in level? You don't think it's an escalation to go from tea bagging to face camping? Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I have never felt the need to do anything more than give them an extra smack on the hook.  
---
Maybe it's because I've played enough survivor to know that being face-camped means I've already won. As someone who plays both sides about equally, I know that all this does is feed their egos. It's better to just move on and not give them the satisfaction of knowing that it got to you.
---
It was. Then people noticed that Save the Best for Last stacked with it.
---
Why is doc not fun tho?  
---
Yeah, yeah, I'm a doc main, but I like to play against a good doc myself. There's nothing really funbreaking, is there?
---
I‚Äôll buy it to level up Jane, because I‚Äôve got so little to do in the game that‚Äôs actually interesting.  I don‚Äôt play killer much because I‚Äôm on console and in general it takes forever to get a match, and the game usually runs terribly as killer.
---
I honestly hope that rumor of a ‚Äúnew mode‚Äù turns out to be true.  DBD is getting on in years and with only one mode, and such arbitrary progression, it‚Äôs hard to stay with it for any long period of time.
---
Most of the salt from survivors I suppose comes from previous games where they are tunneled or camped against and they have to vent their anger to the next killer regardless of their playstyle.
---
Playing the way you are playing without the mindset of trying to get a 4k but to have fun and experimenting will provide survivors with a better gaming experience as they are now playing against a killer that is using builds they have never seen before. 
---
I find that playing against killers using innovate builds to be the most fun. I had a game against a clown who tried to play a carrying build with mad grit, agitation and iron grasp. A Dwight tried to body block him from a hook and got downed for it from full heal which was hilarious to watch. Also having the clown chasing you with a David on his back was a fun spectacle. Although the killer lost the game, it was a refreshing experience and I had a nice chat with the guy afterwards.
---
Glad to hear you are having the most fun in months with that healthy gaming mindset.
---
Stop healing in the exit gate on a downed person just crowd around to block the pick up and let them crawl. So much more efficient.
---
The best -- spend half the round off gens to find and cleanse all 5 totems, only to die before the end and find out the killer didn't even have NOED. 
---
Remember when Moris let you kill anyone you down, regardless of hooks?
---
JOIN A KYF AND VAULT A WINDOW BUT DON‚ÄôT MOVE AFTER VAULTING. SEE IF THE KILLER CAN HIT HIT YOU. SPOILER: THEY CAN‚ÄôT.
---
But that's  a perk slot waste. Taking one perk just to counter a killer than you probably won't even meet is kinda bad idea.
---
It's not based on distance from the hook, it's \~15 seconds of not getting hit after being unhooked. Personally I haven't noticed an unsafe hook get called safe, but I don't really unhook unsafely ever.
---
Quentin is from Nightmare on Elm Street(2010) He is based on the character from the movie, I liked Quentin the character from that movie. Soooo...
---
Okay but like the Nurse's story would make an excellent physiological thriller and descent into madness story, don't @ me
---
That's fair. I personally just never really see that perk set up too much. There's a lot of really good perks to run with Legion since there are a lot of really strong killer perks in general depending on your play style, so I assume it's something you just see more with a super-optimized Legion build.
---
Probably seen more in rank 1 or something. I'm usually around 7 because I'm usually just memeing... but still, since there's a lot of strong perks to run with Legion, and Sloppy + Bloodhound take up two slots, I don't see it too often.
---
i mean same but with Doc  
---
Unlike Legion tho, Doc is not terribly hard to deal with
---
I wonder why are they are so common in PS4? 
---
&gt; BBQ tells you everything
---
well
---
no
---
I dont really consider looping something that toxic for survivors to do. Sure clicking flashlights and all of that are for sure.
---
The problem with freddy is that if he gets buffed, hes gonna be TOO annoying to play against. Even now, he can just defend gens with putting people to sleep and smacking them with sloppy butcher. Had a 30+min games like that and its boring as fuck. I think theres a reason why devs are so hesitant about freddy buff you know...
---
Joke may be stale but like... you got offended at me calling a character in a video game ugly so there's that. Let's leave it at that üòÇüòÇ 
---
No one else has said yet but... SPIRIT THICC XD. Or you could go with you being a weeb but...
---
Gen rush is toxic 
---
The first time I was like okay this is reasonable but the second time it was like 4 seconds of blocking for everyone to escape lol. In the moment those decisions are hard sometimes though.
---
Much more lethal in the chase, can‚Äôt be looped.
---
Huh? Aaaalllrighty thenü§î
---
hence the " **and whatever toxic shit you can think of.**  "
---
When you circled the Awakening daily does that mean all of them or just Dwight?
---
a bowl of spaghett that's been in the back of the fridge too long
---
I'm good.
---
Thats not a dead by daylight problem. Thats how you feel in any team based game
---
Sloppy butcher + bloodhound + frank's mix tape. You hit them to apply deep wound, then hit again with franks to take the timer down to half. Next you look at the ground/backwards "moonwalking" at them. This manipulates the games chase mechanic into thinking you aren't following the survivor so the timer keeps going down, and they have to mend or they will go into the dying state. It's easy to find them because the perks make it trivial to follow the blood trail. Then you can hit them once and they will go down, and there is absolutely nothing they can do about it, since they are forced to stay still and mend.  
---
This tactic will allow any rank 20 legion to kill rank 1 survivors. It's a stupid cheese build that the devs have even said is an unintended consequence of the chase mechanic. The fact that people take advantage of this is what causes everyone to DC as soon as they see legion. It's a borderline exploit, but it's not reportable.
---
I guess I should write a post detailing exactly why everybody is where they are, Please take into account these three thing though:
---
1. I'm a mediocre at best Killer and only really play for Dailies or Bloodpoints, I don't know how or why I'm playing at red ranks, I'd much rather be messing about down in the Greens.
---
2. I very very rarely run addons or Moris, I'm a Hoarder you see.
---
3. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, mine's just a little... controversial.
---
Legion: Probably the only killer so far where I actually have fun playing them. My favourite aesthetically both Cosemtic and Mori wise. I love being able to go fast with little to slow me down, being able to bounce between multiple people and act like a little murderous pinball. It's just a shame that so many people disconnect so I rarely get to use my Devour Hope.
---
Myers: The stalky boi, my fun playing him usually depends on how good a start I get. Got a Grab? Amazing! Got to tier 2 before a gen gets done? Pretty Good. Stuck in Tier 1 for a few gens... Not so good. But I can usually claw it back with smart utlisation of Tier 3 or using his generally smaller Terror Radius to sneak up on people in Tier 2.
---
Pig: My third favourite killer aesthetically and she comes with a couple interesting mechanics to boot. I love using the crouch to sneak up on people and her traps are so good at keeping people off of gens (similar to Legion forcing people to mend but requiring being left up to luck)
---
Wraith: Wow, all the sneaky bois are up here aren't they? Well, the bonus movement speed whilst invisible is immediately a plus and helps with sneaking up on people, partial Invisibility for sneaks also a plus. Also: BING BONG, BING BONG!
---
Huntress: I can't aim a hatchet to save my life but she's my second favourite aesthetically, (Yes I'm a massive Furry, no I don't regret it). That is pretty much why she's in meh... I like the way she looks enough to counterract how bad I am at playing her.
---
Doc: Bloodpoint Machine, 'nuff said. Also his little giggle when zapping people always brightens my day, shame his ability doesn't really do much to survivors that can hit skillchecks, but atleast it helps me find people sometimes.
---
Billy: Super Fast boi! Can't hit the survivors with the chainsaw at all but just zooming about the map on patrol is fun enough. Doesn't have any good cosmetics though (in my opinion).
---
Freddy: Has one of the most interesting and fun sounding abilities in the game. Such a shame it isn't very good. 
---
Clown: The bottles sometimes help me catch up to survivors, most of the time the effect runs out and they can get to a pallet to loop or whatever. Sometimes it works out in my favour though and saves time so he's alright I guess.
---
Nurse: Not really all that fun to play, When against bad survivors the match is so easy it's boring, and when against good survivors that can actually juke simple blinks it's frustrating as hell. Also spending half the match looking at the floor isn't fun.
---
Leatherface: Kinda like Billy but with all the fun taken out of him. The noises he makes whilst waving his saw are pretty funny though.
---
Spirit: I have no clue how to use her ability effectively whatsoever and 90% of the time using it makes me lose a survivor rather than catch up to them.
---
Trapper: I feel like I waste all my time setting up traps that absolutely nobody ends up stepping in and he doesn't really have anything else going for him.
---
Hag: Hag. (Ok but in all seriousness she has the same problems I have with trapper but with less movement speed and as a Survivor main she's one of the Unholy trinity of Killers I have no fun playing against [Joint with Nurse and Spirit].)
---
I can probably add more to this and answer questions if anyone asks. *shrug*
---
For real. The humming from the distance would be iconic in a slasher movie. 
---
It‚Äôs really not that big though. The person wants a full on circus map or carnival. I also don‚Äôt know why there‚Äôs a chapel for Kenneth‚Äôs map since I don‚Äôt remember his lore ever mentioning one
---
? Clown gets looped. He just speeds up the process. If anything Trapper has more potential in chase cause he can end it at anytime. In fact you could say that for LF too. I‚Äôm sad to say but my main and these other killers are lower mid tier.
---
Oh, now it makes sense. Yeah, that is reasonable. 
---
But that's entirely subjective. You directly said looping. Looping isnt toxic. 
---
Oh shit. This bug is real. I was SWF and noticed my friend going after a dull. It was real to him and the rest of the team. I didn't get the sound effect or destruction pop-up when it was destroyed either.
---
I thought maybe I was just crazy.
---
Woah, I'm going to the dentist later today 0.o
---
True that. It‚Äôs cause he and his wagon ‚Äúarrived‚Äù in the Entity‚Äôs world. The chapel is from Nurse‚Äôs lore. It‚Äôs just that Clown set up shop there when he arrived with his cute horse.
---
The Troglodytes that main legion: Um, excuse me, legion has counterplay. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what it is, or how to execute it, but you‚Äôre clearly just trash at the game. 
---
Kthx duuuuuuud XDDDD
---
Ohhhh that‚Äôs interesting 
---
what sort of normie shit is this?

Okay.

You can‚Äôt without changing game files. Back in  early 2016 to get iridescent perks like Self-Care, you‚Äôd have to go through every common, uncommon, rare perk before you could actually get them.
---
When you escape but you're put in the downed state
---
I know and it doesn‚Äôt matter if your survivor or killer I play both people will always get mad at how you play and how it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfair‚Äù killers say Gen rushing and survivors say camping it‚Äôs actually funny sometimes
---
Oh man then we can add fweddy fazbear and pennywise kiwwers! 
---
If clowns getting looped it‚Äôs on the player, not the character, because no loops should last for more than 10 seconds with the gas. Trapper and LF have less chase potential because trapper has to set his stuff up beforehand and try to get someone to run through them, and LF has to get right on their ass and charge up a saw. Against a good player, LF and trapper are at a disadvantage whereas clown can get hits at any tile really quickly.
---
oh my god you guys are dumb
---
T bagging begets Facecamping which begets hook diving which completes the cycle. 
---
no shit
---
Not sure why the downvotes, you're right. The only exceptions to this are Nurse or a good Huntress or Spirit.
---
Must be the latest patch. It made all my crows turn white.
---
Possibly. Where would one find this option?
---
The killer hosts the game, so only they can lag switch. If a survivor did it, they would just screw themselves over.
---
thank u. hag is a really good killer she carried me p hard to my first rank 1 killer experience.
---
She had only a slightly less movement speed no? Like 110% right?
---
i was the feng no Kappa
---
Do you use an actual mouse and keyboard or the mouse on laptop?
---
this happened and i destroyed it and i got facecamped :-(
---
It was right after Myers came out, it got nerfed pretty fast 
---
How is it supposed to work when you actually get into the game, but then have a three-man disconnect?  I've played a couple games where a 3-man SWF disconnects simultaneously, leaving the plus-one.  My HUD still says five generators left, and no hatch available.  The wiki says that the number of completed generators must exceed the number of remaining survivors by one in order for the hatch to spawn; but both times when only one dude was left, they both hatched out at four gens remaining according to my HUD.
---
Slender Man
---
Clown has 10 second loops but you said it yourself, hits =/= kills. Nurse is nurse tier because not only can she get hits in 5 seconds consistently but she has amazing map pressure as well. Setting traps isn‚Äôt horrible, but it wastes time clown doesn‚Äôt waste, you have a limited amount of them, and they don‚Äôt always do very much if you‚Äôre not chasing someone in an area with them.
---
Yeah, that makes sense. I‚Äôve run into it a few times where you get this sudden excessive struggling but never see anyone here mention it so I‚Äôve been trying to figure it out.
---
Yeah I agree that pig‚Äôs RNG can destroy many of her games. And against good survivors that know how to play against pig can make it tough. But she‚Äôs still much better than what people make her to be. Myers with his purple as pink add ons is obviously very good. He‚Äôs A tier with those. Being able to mori survivors before even hooking them and being able to see survivors through walls pretty impossible to beat. Just like how pig is strong with Amanda‚Äôs letter add on. 
---
am i the only one who has more fun letting survivors win? ooh that would make a fun post
---
No anime allowed 
---
So Clown is Trapper and LF tier then right? I mean a good Trapper always has traps where survivors are or will be.
---
You must not be great at chases then. I hate being facecamped so I don't do anything to taunt a killer, but I've been facecamped more than once for keeping a chase up for 2+ gens without looping any former infinites.
---
It's been my gamer tag since I was younger with my xbox 360 so it's been a running joke in my friends group ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è yeah it's stupid and that's why me and my friends laugh at it.

That‚Äôs the main reason why I use him lmfao and because of his Santa cosmetic. Best cosmetic in the game imo
---
Can't wait to see the finished product with texturing! It looks great so far!
---
Can somebody explain pls?
---
So Feng is a suitcase person, got it. Look it up people. 
---
Well, the only thing that makes survivors differ from each other is Bloodweb RNG and appearance so what difference does it make who are you playing?
---
The irony is that in creating a perk to counter tunneling, the devs accidentally made a perk that *benefits* tunneling with the right perks and conditions. You have Remember Me, PWYF, STBFL, or another obsession perk that benefits from an alive obsession but they DC'd or died early? Just tunnel and hope one of the other survivors has DS. The devs accidentally made a killer *want* to be hit with DS with this mechanic.
---
A good trapper is still restricted by a limit on his traps, and even a good trapper isn‚Äôt omniscient. No one can see the future and put traps in the exact spots that you with chase people through, there are simply too many tiles. You can predict where people will run through but people can also predict where you will put your traps, so various choke points that are extremely beneficial to have a trap in won‚Äôt really work unless you have iridescent stone. Clown doesn‚Äôt have to be omniscient, his bottles work at any tile and can be refilled on the spot should he run out.

I didn't try and offend you, I literally quoted your username, Tj The beast.

Anyways, gonna stop replying to this thread now since you haven't really said anything useful or genuine besides throwing snide remarks. 
---
Trapper's forte is the midgame. You have to put all the traps in one half of the map and be patient, but boooooi it pays off
---
This sounds made up.  I have never seen this.  I have seen Survivors get mad for getting tunneled or seen Survivors get annoyed because it is a 2 vs 1 because 2 people did not load in but the Killer still tunnels or plays as hard as they can.  Not wanting to avoid tunneling or having the Killer not try hard in a 2 vs 1 is hardly asking to let them win.
---
Why assume he's toxic?
---
I think it's more of a rip to machine gun build, since unrelenting is there beside it. But yeah, STBFL is legit a good perk now.
---
&gt; Rank rewards is not something we considered for this iteration, but it is something we would like to incorporate in some way for future iterations. 
---
No joke, they literally said they want to implement rank rewards since launch. 3 years ago... Still no rank rewards.
---
Turn it from normal unhooks to safe unhooks and actually make the protection score work for it, maybe give it a bonus effect like BBQ and it‚Äôll be fine. 
---
Sounds accurate
---
No date on that as of yet.
---
&gt; I assumed you may be the problem
---
Fixed that.
---
Nurse. She can break a generator without even touching it. 
---
Great job! It‚Äôs nice to have original new content here 
---
Not everything, but in most situations, enough to help you decide where to hunt.
---
I've been facecamped for long chases. No teabagging involved. I actually teabag other survivors just to say hi more than I ever do the killer. Long distance camping, face camping, Insidious camping ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî it's a joke to pretend that any of this happens JUST BC SOME SURVIVOR was toxic. Smh. Y'all ain't that holy.
---
Corrupt plague looks different
---
&gt; Decisive Strike and Head On will now be affected by Enduring. 
---
*laughs in Enduring*
---
Add on top of that the endless list of made up rules
---
As long as you get two gens done, and you are the last one alive (whether that's by disconnects post or pre loading screen) or by  sacrifices, hatch should be available. In all scenarios, at least 2 gens for last one alive. 
---
Far left girl tho üòç
---
They got the clown's gas there now! That's the good shit!
---
this is true. a man in a suit is attractive but a man doing a generator is off the charts üî•
---
So they actually nerfed thanatophobia if 1, 2 or 3 survivors are injured. This perk right now is already trash. In the PTB it was actually decent but now they nerfed it. Doesn't make sense to me.
---
This is why nobody likes survivor mains
---
They also just may not find you to be a threat tbh :( 
---
Then its not that bad. No skill check anymore?
---
I thought you said you were done replying tho my dude ü§î
---
Because killers won't throw a game for no reason. 
---
lol I will if I do.
---
I've done [other](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/99he59/hotline_miami_chapter_the_animal_powerperks/) [concepts](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9coxzs/childs_play_chapter_the_toy_chucky_powerperks/) [in](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9t7al6/halloween_postmortem_the_poltergeist_a_killer/) [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a0t1kj/fan_chapter_the_killer_is_actually_the_mirror/) [past](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a22nby/superior_firepower_the_shooter_fankiller_since/), most to find ways to make silly ideas work, so I'm interested. If I do, I'll pm and credit ya :)
---
Does that mean that the stun will be less than 3 seconds with enduring? Just enough to get off and move a second? Yikes
---
It's painful watching how slow Hag trap placement used to be
---
Toxic survivors are always complaining about killers camping them, 9/10 it won't be someone who isn't toxic that gets camped.
---
I mean if you find just doing gens and never interacting with the killer + getting next to no points not a ruined game, then fair enough.
---
I feel like the stacking was a bit much, but 1 level of this wasn't *too* bad. Then again, l always played David and Quentin
---
I swear I just saw this exact same thing yesterday.....but can't find it. 
---
If I did my math right, the stun will only be 0.75 of a second. Rip DS and Head On users. I think you'll be able to recover before survivors hit the ground with DS, lol.
---
Who said that?
---
Oh 
---
I just saw one for apex legends and thought it also could be applied to dbd XD 
---
There is a mute button. If you click on the button next to the chat box it will hide the chat so you can avoid speaking to players in the game. 
---
The offerings are still in my inventory, I just can‚Äôt use them :/
---
Well, if I play my mains I'll wreck all these low rankers, so I figured play my worst give them a chance lol
---
I HATE THAT WE GET A NEW KILLER/SURVIVOR BEFORE BHVR FIXES HITBOXES. GETTING HIT BY A KILLER SWING THAT'S ATLEAST 6 FEET SHORT OF HITTING YOU IS NOT OK
---
Interesting. I guess that does makes sense. Once you play enough of this game, you want to experiment with different play styles to freshen it up.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve come across killers who do want to de-pip. It makes sense
---
But you need to be respactable to farm the achievement with the survivors
---
Possibly but I tend to either play altruistic or gen based builds so I'll definitely be a thorn in their side.
---
I just think respecting the fact that the killer's job is hard and not making it harder through making a mockery of them will make them less likely to camp you.
---
I suppose they are making some final touches and are trying to iron out any bugs that may have been introduced. I believe they will release it next week or during the weekend. 
---
Fire up though is getting a slight buff compared to the initial nerf which is nice. 
---
4% per gen though is still debatable.
---
Ah, yeah....that was it!
---
In that case, carry on.
---
uwu
---
u/siberlily there
---
Common sense, experience, take your pick. 
---
It‚Äôs unfun for everyone though. Now all the gameplay everyone gets is afk holding m1 on a gen cause leatherfaces fatass refuses to move his chainsaw from the face of his victim.
---
i don't understand why survivors are like that, what gives them that kind of entitlement? 
---
I‚Äôve gotten to a point of just avoiding the post chat like the plague (xd). I almost always give hatch unless I reeeaally feel like I fought good survs and earned the kill but I still get trash talked half the time so I kinda just dip immediately if I‚Äôm not in the mood. It‚Äôs kinda sad the mental gymnastics people will go to just to protect their ego against strangers.
---
Didn't the hollowed blight event imply that he died (or am I mistaken)?
---
[The old reddit.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b0vvv8/some_of_the_killers_and_the_survivor_activities/)
---
Erm. Find the survivor before they get the hatch? We have many ways of finding survivors, I don‚Äôt slug and get 4ks like that. If they find the hatch oh well, I‚Äôm not gonna leave someone on the floor for god knows how long to try find one person who will probs just hide, at least with hatch they‚Äôll be walking around, shit most the time people just run around looking for it and it‚Äôs an easy down.
---
Glad to help man I can tell you it has helped improve my experience as killer.
---
"Which is true"? is it who I think it is? Was this a clue? I don't consider him toxic. I am overstating.
---
Okay sweetheart, let me break it down for you so it's easier for you to understand. 
---
Holding the game hostage was just an example of toxic survivor behaviour, not the cause. You don't get non-toxic players who suddenly decide to drag a game on for 20 minutes after it should have ended by tormenting the killer into getting them to ragequit. 
---
I can't honestly blame a killer for wanting to ensure a toxic survivor dies once hooked when faced with that possibility. 
---
As I always say though, don't taunt the killer and they won't taunt you back when you inevitably get hooked. 
---
I‚Äôd be much more terrified of Nurse then Wraith.
---
Great tier list just swap clown and pig and ur good
---
@Mun-Bun
---
No point in paying attention to people like that.  Even if you did rush all the gens and had perks, so what?  Fair is fair, the bloodweb gave you the perks so they're fair to use, and teamwork is essential in a game like this so there would be nothing unfair about you guys all rushing the same gen.  I really hate it when people bitch about something that they have no business bitching about.
---
2 tbags = friendly communication 3 or more = I'm being an ass. It's the bro code.  
---
Watch twitch streamer FUDGE, it's made me alot better at playing her because you can see the shot you can make and good builds.
---
Pm me the name I wanna watch the vod
---
I can only talk from my own vast experiences. I simply don't encounter many killers that are toxic without being provoked. 
---
&gt; So is perma tier 3 Myers also Wraith tier?
---
You forget about the perks that help injured players e.g resilience (highly underrated) and dead hard. Tier 3 myers also has a longer lunge range and vault speed, which plague does not. Survivors can just stay broken, pop the gens, cleanse themselves then they are out. Sickness doesnt do enough, you have to go out of your way to get corrupt purge and even then she only becomes a slightly better Huntress. Shes meh
---
Good luck on finding smart survivors who will let you do that lmao
---
Its 1v1 and I¬¥m sitting under a hook, waiting for you to end the game. I don¬¥t think there can be toxicity at this point :D
---
I think they mean the bug that causes Hex totems to *look* dull occasionally, but be active
---
What would you change?
---
jesus christ why is he so sweaty
---
Holy fuck tyde is this you?
---
As a killer main I can understand his pain in that generators can be done incredibly fast but its not the fault of the survivors for that being the case. The fact that he flamed you and banned you for it is a bit pathetic. 
---
Gen rushing by itself is just an issue of survivors having the only option of doing gens during a game instead of an incentive or secondary objective to distract them from the task. 
---
A cloaked wraith is easier to see than that shit.   Thank god its gone.
---
Claudette boy up in dis oh!
---
Watch me fix this, fix this gen!
---
Superman that oh!
---
That's not how Enduring (at least currently) works. It increases recovery, not shortens the stun. So if DS stuns for 3 seconds, under enduring it will be
---
3 seconds / (1.00 base recovery + 0.75 Enduring) = 1.71 seconds. 
---
Which is still a fairly significant difference. Considering survivors move at 4.0m/s when running, that only puts 6.86m in between them and the killer by the time the stun is over. If pallets, a window, or the hatch aren't nearby, you're going down again.
---
If the hatch spawned and there are only 2 survivors left then the chances are high that one of them is already sitting on hatch waiting for the chased one to die. 
---
EWWWWWW
---
the gens popped VERY fast. 
---
all of us spawned together, so the 3 of us got a gen to half before he found us and proceeded to hit us a bit and chase someone.
---
i then did a gen by myself. i got it to half before he came to me. he then hit me and ran away from me. he didnt lose me or anything, i think he just wanted to keep chasing the other guy. so i finished that gen. after i finished that gen, i began finishing the gen everyone had worked on in the beginning. whilst this was happening, a fourth person was on the other side of the map finishing a gen. and the same guy was getting chased
---
by the time i had finished the generator, the guy that had gotten chased had gotten moried. so it took the killer 3 gens to chase someone, hook him, have him unhooked and then mori him
---
im not sure how the 4th gen happened, i didnt see. the last gen got finished whilst the last person was getting chased
---
technically, was it gen rush? yes, because we did it fast. but its not our faults nor the games fault that the killer didnt put any pressure on us. 
---
at least i could understand it if we came in with speedy perks and toolboxes. but we didnt even do that
---
Billy can yee my haw
---
If you play like cancer then yes
---
I think so but Bloodhound might be better than Pop Goes 
---
ok. feel free to correct me if anything ive said doesnt match the game. i havent seen it myself
---
The first trap re-armed itself by the time he freed himself.
---
I agree that she‚Äôs better than made out to be, most people put her at like D tier above F tier, but she isn‚Äôt A or B tier. And yeah the reason I spoke about michaels addons is because they‚Äôre significantly stronger than pigs. Amanda‚Äôs letter gives her a strong ability, but it comes with the massive drawback of making her now one trap practically worthless, all for some small aura reading that isn‚Äôt gonna do you much more than you could do with your eyes and ears unless you‚Äôre on like lery‚Äôs or the game. Even wraith has that exact same addon, except it‚Äôs down one rarity, comes with no drawbacks, and he maintains a much faster movement speed.
---
12m aura reading is cool and all, but it‚Äôs nothing compared to what‚Äôs essentially perma NOED in one gen (assuming ruin and J. Myers memorial), getting moried on the spot, or always being able to instadown throughout the entire match once you hit a bottle.
---
Even if we aren‚Äôt comparing the top rarity addons, Myers and Clown have better green, yellow, and brown addons than pig. The combat straps used to be a necessity, but now that they‚Äôve tweaked the crouch speed pretty much all of her addons have very little important effect. The only addon of her green and below that I‚Äôd consider to have a meaningful effect would be the last will, because the addons that effect the box do very little, and the addons that apply status effects serve little use unless you‚Äôre trying to tunnel the guy with the RBT or are playing an endgame build where you‚Äôre trying to trap everyone at the end of the match. 
---
Those addons are quite weak in comparison to how quick you get or how long you can maintain an instadown, or how slow you make survivor when they touch the gas and how long their hindered effect lasts. Michaels green and below addons actively affect how much of a threat he is (except for the mirror set and kinda the jewelry set) and basically all of clowns addons (except for the reload movement speed set) affect how deadly he is in a chase.
---
Sorry for the long ass response. Usually addons don‚Äôt matter too much in a tier list, but pig is the exception just because she hardly has any good addons at all to even compare to when discussing killers
---
Don‚Äôt think I actually have Bloodhound. Pop is more to slow the game down in addition to Ruin
---
Wooow you did leatherface dirty...
---
He is just very thicc!
---
That build is basically called ‚ÄúYOUR FREE TRIAL OF LIVING HAS ENDED‚Äù
---
Very funny 
---
Yes
---
I dont mind those salts and things but this kind of thing shakes me with anger and regret
---
I‚Äôll only take you seriously when you rank 1 killer, or 1v1 final destination no items 3 stock 
---
That still makes zero sense my friend. The concept of holding the game hostage at the gate and facecamping cannot be related due to the nature of the game. 
---
I should've changed it. Clown has a chunky belly
---
&gt; QUESTION FROM GONZOLAX Will the ability for survivors to get fully healed on the fountains be removed on the full patch?
---
JANICK - GAME DESIGNER | ANSWER Not at this time, we feel at the moment that it is the right effect to balance her powerful Purge Effect.
---
Powerful purge effect my ass oh no I'm broken doesn't stop me from rushing gens lmao
---
ITT: "Because DbD used to have even worse balancing issues, it means no one is allowed to be unhappy with the game currently"
---
Do they think its good in any way?? It barely adds seconds to any action!
---
Well I do have a video by a talented huntress player that will give you very good tips while playing huntress.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQRDijaX5Io
---
Recommend watching the guys other videos. He is a really talented killer for dbd.
---
I don't play huntress unfortunately so the only tip I can offer is to not chase survivors extensively without planning on using your hatchets. Your 110% movement speed will hurt you greatly in chases.
---
I just explained why..... What part of it do you not understand? 
---
People who are toxic during the gen phase of the game are more likely to hold the game hostage than people who are not. Do you disagree with that?
---
They hate having perks ,that require specific condition to be used, to actually benefit you for using them. Seriously, Enduring is so common and actually freaking useful, why have it kill those two perks.
---
It does not. However, I feel when the frame rate becomes what they're aiming for (consistent 60 fps) it will be added. If you plug in your keyboard into your xbox, you are able to move in game (though it lags a little bit), but mouse doesn't work at all. I think this is a sign that it may come in the future.
---
HOOK CAMPING IS TOO EASY AND THATS THE WAY IT IIIIIS 
---
Thank you Ill be sure to give it a watch
---
Just a little bit 
---
Thanks. 
---
I started watching Twitch streaming of this game and i was struck by how they don't suffer from this framerate issue. 
---
Thank you to whoever did this ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
As a survivor, you did right. It's the end game, there's not much the killer can do at this point.
---
Oink
---
Survivors have been nerfed for many broken aspects of the game like pallet vacuums or too quick heals. The only time something really got nerfed due to swf was the change where you couldnt see the killers perks, which doesnt effect solo players. And the reason why people are bad at the game is soley because they are bad. Many people dc if things dont go that well or still play like in the old days when survivors where op and dont adapt to the new circumstances. The problem isnt the game, its the community that basically got poisoned by ochido in the past. Dbd doesnt have to balance the game for players that are stupid enough to run behind a killer, dont do gens when someone gets camped or are simply not productive
---
Yes. 
---
&gt;We tested out with slowing Survivor down, getting Exposed, reveal location (madness), but all those felt overpowered or unfun and unfair on the survivor side.
---
Good thing they bothered doing some testing with this killer to find out what would work instead of giving as another mess like Legion. I don't care how incompetent people make them out to be, but there is no way they missed so many bad things about them if they had actually tested them properly, lack of testing is surely what happened.
---
It‚Äôs more a case of perks. Even rank 1 killers when they don‚Äôt use Ruin or something else that specifically slows gens basically accept that 1-2 gens will be popped before they can end a chase. Part of why I say Ruin‚Äôs bad for the game is killers rely on it and hate it, survivors hate playing against it, and it‚Äôs overall just unhealthy.
---
*enduring noises*
---
Yep. I haven't even needed Ruin given some of the teams I'm facing. Bit of a breath of fresh air, but damn is it messy for me playing Survivor. 
---
Unless you are cursed by non-stop skillchecks like me.  If ruin is on, I'm getting a skill check every 3-4 seconds.    I've had 1 match in the last week where I didn't get cursed with constant checks.
---
30 days are up! 
---
It‚Äôs more I enjoy the game, weird as it sounds, and would like to see things get better for everyone involved. Plus, I‚Äôve got nothing better to do than type a ton while sick as hell on a day off.
---
Shitpost aside, you do you 
---
decisive strike does not deserve to go to meme heaven it goes straight to meme hell
---
geb rush
---
What was the perk that they are alluding to in the last question?
---
Don't think you have to worry about much as long as you have franks mixtape in your addon selection. Just tunneling with your power will guarantee a win. 
---
Perkwise
---
- Pop Goes the weasel is not bad considering you can sprint to specific gens. Normally I would be against it with legion as he has a hard time downing people but with franks your good.
---
- Ruin is great as always. Legion ability to hit someone working on ruin allows him to interrupt them which can be great for defending it.
---
- NOED not very good on legion due to his frenzy not working well with it. Doubt many people will reach end game with you anyhow with franks
---
- Nurses is alright but most decent players know not to heal against legion. best if you combine it with monitor and abuse if you are going to use it.
---
Perks I recommend with this build 
---
- Ruin for slowing the game down
---
- Discordance to find survivors and reduce speed
---
- M&amp;A to get close then frenzy survivors. Better for sneaking and confirming hits against them.
---
- Third seal if you want to slug. You could probably end the game in minutes with it if you combine it with dear stalker
---
- Thrill of the Hunt will allow you to chase down survivors that are breaking your totems. Combine with M&amp;A you can sneak up and tunnel him to death.
---
- BBQ for extra bp and awareness of players
---
Expect to have players DC as soon as you hit them twice with frenzy.
---
I only play survivor and I've played with people who get mad when the killer gets them. 
---
Like that's the point of the game, if they keep getting you, then you just need to work on your gameplay. 
---
It's so weird how people just want easy. And then if the killer let's them escape, then they're trash. 
---
Sadly, we have bad killers and bad survivors. 
---
It was a joke fam. I wasn't calling you an ass.
---
What add-ons did she have?!
---
These have been over the game's lifetime. For example, Flashlights were amazing *two* years ago, but then they got nerfed about *one* year ago. Freddy was nerfed about a week after he released, so people barely got to enjoy his amazingness
---
I only have Rank 1 M&amp;A atm should I replace Nurse‚Äôs with it?
---
"Using BBQ? Self-Care? Crutches. You camped at the exit hook to get your third kill? You flashlight saved another rando?? God you're sweaty.
---
 I can't believe we're all playing at the same rank and yet you got boosted/deranked/cheated.
---
Don't you know how to have fun?? anyway I hate this game, gotta get to my next post-game chat. Gut Gid, kid." 
---
 ‚Äî Someone angry and made of straw, probably.
---
I'll agree this game is populated by people wanting clean sportsmanship and easy wins, who will turn right around use/abuse any advantage they can possibly get, just to end up talking shit regardless of their results.
---
It can be a really immature community, wrapped up in a verifiably casual game that's constantly trying to become serious. Noticed that most of everyone feels straight-up shafted over any play made outside their comfort zone.
---
used to be horrifying on Huntress
---
they said 2 weeks for this one
---
Ow, I love nurse too &lt;3
---
I'm not talking about the pallet vacuum being removed, that was a well needed change. I'm talking about issues such as the lack of pallets on each map. I counted the pallets on a map in KYF once and there were only 8 on the entire map, including the shack pallet. Not to mention many of them weren't safe at all. 
---
Yes I would. M&amp;A will make your terror radius like tier 1 Myers so you can use stealth to catch survivors off guard.
---
as an older player who still has one, the offering is unusable and is listed as "retired" in the description 
---
Oh no the survivors did their objective while I wasted the whole match chasing one guy boo boo.
---
One i can think of is play with your food, since you can gain stacks all the while you keep vomiting on people, and yes the broken status caused by her basic vomit does not count as an offensive action. It's a bit gimmicky, but fun as hell.
---
I feel they need that distraction. It would make it so that Ruin isn't required and I can still have a setup phase as Trapper or more plentiful time to get to EW2 as Mike. The fact that playing Killer is almost all about time management and factors more or less out of our control is *almost* (but not nearly) enough to outweigh the upsides. 
---
On M&amp;A goes then, haven‚Äôt actually pulled BBQ as Legion yet surprisingly
---
I just hate playing for a week after it xD

yes
---
They literally said they want to implement rank rewards since this game's release. 3 years ago...
---
I honestly don‚Äôt like using modi‚Äôs
---
See Freddy now preys upon much older victims.
---
I was already to refute this somehow, but... *what*?
---
I would guess they will both appear on every blood web until you take one. Since a teachable will appear on every blood web until you take it, and bloodwebs have a maximum of 2 perks
---
And pharmacy 
---
not teabagging but you get facecamped anyways because by the time the killer has downed you all the gens are done
---
yeah, it would actually be super rad to at least be able to import your own character and map models into Kill Your Friends! i understand why they don't allow it in main gameplay, but it would be so fun to be able to test out new stuff you've made yourself and share with others.
---
I did 5 bloodwebs for Self-Care after skipping them, and never saw it until I removed Empathy from the pool. Likewise for Decisive Strike, and for that one I went through easily 10 L50 bloodwebs.
---
I might be unlucky, but I would say earlier teachables maintain priority.
---
I remember when we used to get tips for the killer we were about to play against in the loading screen. Wait... do they do that for the newbies at 16+?
---
Seeing how, currently, doing good chases, hooking twice, three gens and spamming powers get brutal or better on killer I rather have everyone escape and I get more BP. 
---
this is why this game is a joke
---
Pretty much. Those first aid kits are for me!
---
Thats what I want as well, I was thinking reduced action speed, but then she would be a Freddy 2.0
---
You know what that means? Your foot's still in the trap. You're not 
---
Hold the killer hostage? Can‚Äôt the killer just... kill them...? 
---
I see you've brought your "pile of salt" add on.. 
---
I like the Haddonfield trick. Michael's house... oh, god, Michael's house...
---
I think next update is tightening down on that, but it should still work if you do it well.
---
I'm not advocating for kill everyone, or taking it too seriously, either. Just explaining my opposing preference since they posted.
---
imagine if we could do that in game, of course you'd have to balance it after they added that because killers would be op if you didnt, but the entire game is already built around chicken dances around circles so I doubt they could, im just saying, the next killer vs survivor type game that comes out, they gotta know how to not make chases comical with loops
---
None of that makes a Nurse lose you. She'll miss on THAT blink, sure. But she won't lose you unless she's awful. There is no solid counter-play to Nurse. 
---
But yeah Legion is still even more unhealthy for the game than she is. Both need adjusting though. 
---
8)
---
Ah I see like :3
---
This the dude that never does gens
---
That's actually not a good idea unless everyone else is in Dream State. Freddy has no Collision otherwise 
---
Increase difficulty of ranking at higher ranks and offer no rewards for placement in ranks. I can't argue with this good logic...
---
Is it sad i am not surprised one bit by this?
---
Np. Well the current system on PTB makes anything less than 10 hooks per game barely gold. Really I don't see the point of ranking since nothing comes out of it. Rather have fun while learning.

&gt; QUESTION FROM XCHRISX
---
The new map seems like red forest 2.0 i was waiting for a new map not a remake like happened for the clown too. Can a map be changed in future with the lore? DAVE RICHARD - CREATIVE DIRECTOR | ANSWER The temple of purgation is set in the red forest theme. Even though we would love to create a unique theme for every killer we release, it‚Äôs not something that we can do production wise in our current situation. 
---
I like the new map. The temple plus the various ruins around it make the make look plenty unique. The only thing I would change about it is it's size. It's too damn big and is going to be hell on slower killers. Remove some titles from it's out-skirts and it'll be fine as is. It looks Babylonian enough.

Ridiculous that this was even asked (Not the Thana part since that's a legitimate issue) but there it is. If a perk stays the same at Tier 3 it's not a buff or a nerf. It's essentially just been left alone. Too many people freaking out over the lower tiers of perks becoming not garbage.
---
the problem is she is just a generic spooky ghost girl basically
---
&gt;Spirit use spine chill.
---
You don't know if you are going to verse the spirit and equipping a perk that is basically useless for any other killer is no solution.
---
Iron will is much more useful since it is very effective against any killer.
---
Probably not
---
That sucks in sorry
---
Just two more levels and I can buy the nice Susie outfit too :‚ÄôL 
---
"Silence, **Dwight Main** " -meg
---
Overrated. 32 seconds on a generator vs 32/40 seconds healing yourself?
---
Who cares?  The only people giving any importance to streamers are the people who talk about streamers.  
---
Just suck it up and try to find the humor in it.
---
Yeah i thought that aswell, after Malkav explained it for me xD
---
fr fr
---
I feel that. Lobby times have been absolute hell because of both rank reset and Daylight Savings. 
---
I mean, DS is still useful against tunneling and is no longer a free escape
---
You can still blind killers using flashlights and get flash saves, it\`s just not as easy as before, just get used to it
---
BNP is still free seconds of repair time and doesn't consume full toolbox
---
Unrelenting can be combined with Spirit Fury and Enduring in case a survivor doesn't drop a pallet, in which case survivor is not gonna be able to do another loop because of your missed swing
---
Save the Best for Last is way better than what it used to be after the huge nerf. It does it\`s job.
---
Tinker is now more unique and has more mindgame to it, its still good for good killers, and could result in a down if a gen is about to be popped while you\`re in a chase
---
The Moon offering is meh, it was pretty fun, but I can understand why devs did that
---
And Freddy, well...‚Ä¶ uh..... he\`ll get a rework soon!.....?
---
Who said they are honest 
---
They also said they look at perks after a time just look at surveillance 
---
Loop killer for 3 gens &gt; not even being toxic just playing the game &gt; get face camped
---
Were you not listening? You're going after the unhooker.  It just allows the unhookee to have relative immunity from consequences for going down.
---
If it worked like the suggestion I would simply body block for the unhooker and the killer could never punish anybody for unsafe hooks. If I go down I get to use DS 
---
I swear people need to play both sides to see how busted this suggestion is.
---
Yeah, occasionally you'll get lucky and have it be Myers and/or your main, but not most of the time 
---
Ded ard 
---
Same man. It will allow for so much momentum build up for M1 killers like Clown and such. Will definitely make pop goes the weasel more useful at the beginning of the match so you dont have to travel as far to kick a gen. Discordance will probably become stronger during that period aswell.
---
Cooperative actions for 180 seconds. It takes FOREVER 
---
Fuck, I miss moonlight offerings...
---
So as well as all the other conditions for it to activate DS is now like DS 1 currently is. Barely gives the survivor any distance lol
---
Also head on gets more of a shitty meme perk by the day
---
Wraith.
---
Oh man, don't even get me started on vacuum pallets. 
---
I think rank reset is fine.   A few days will weed out the really low skilled players and the better players will rank up quickly.  This isn't a perfect system, but keeps players from facing the same killers and survivors over and over again.   I think that a handicap of teammates that aren't as good as you will help you get even better as it forces you to fill in the gaps where they fail.  It also has you face better killers that rank up quickly to the red ranks and stay there.  This lets you get  experience and learn how some higher ranked killers play.   It might be tough for a bit, but it will be worth it to have to stretch you skills to survive.   
---
I feel like if a survivor intends to be playful by doing something that 95% of killers think is really annoying, they're not using their brain
---
Or blame the shitty killer. Good SWF groups won't save their friend until all the gens are done and if you facecamp that's exactly what will happen. If you're playing against good survivors don't chase the ones that flashlight spam you, teabag, etc because they are cocky and want to be chased, they WILL waste your time. Go after the people actually on gens.
---
Dying Light, Mori, black box, I'm guessing? 
---
No, that's absolutely not how it works, and there is a base recovery speed. The rate at which you recover is increased by 75%, as the perk states. It does not shorten the stun duration by 75% as you seem to believe. For example, the current stun time for a pallet is 2.1 seconds. With Enduring, the time is 1.2 seconds, as per the DBD wiki. 2.1 / 1.75 = 1.2. You can read how Enduring works on the Wiki [here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Enduring). 
---
Lucky you, I am a gen jockey 
---
It depends on how I‚Äôm feeling. If the survivors are being toxic I‚Äôll play normally. If the survivors are trying to be wholesome and work on gens, get saves, run me around etc. I won‚Äôt kill anyone off. Having fun is what matters 
---
It was kinda broken on some killers. legion in particular. Thano is shit but it needs a change different o making it dying light without killing people. 
---
Maybe just impact gen progression
---
I mean a 115% killer and you being constantly one tap is a very risky move. I dont see an issue with it
---
And he also triggered crows. 
---
Yea, every chapter brings typically 6 new achievements, 3 for killer and 3 for survivor. Generally only 3 of them are character specific (2 Adept achievements, 1 based on the new killer and their power). The rest can be done by anybody. 
---
Spirit needs to be moved up, would love to see something involving her. Legion should be put all the way down with Nurse. 
---
ARCHIMEDES, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN ZERE
---
I can help you get some of the survivor trophies or just hang out.
---
it feels faster doing this daily with prove thy self i was able to get this done in 2 games 
---
He was asking about the machine gun build... Which was nerfed with the Tinkerer changes in 2.1.0 over the summer, not sabo.
---
There are soo many strong tiles on a lot of maps that you can run to that the legion can hardly mind game because of his 110 speed. Even an L/T wall can keep him busy for a while. The only time I can think of that a chase can end quickly is if there are no pallets on the map or you run to an unsafe pallet.Thanatophobia isn't even a good perk at the moment. Perhaps after the update it'll be but in the current time, even if all survivors are injured, it only adds 12 seconds. 
---
That's why I love Alert. "Oh, he's in a chase, Imma just keep workin'"
---
Stan Lee was the best, I'm so happy to see him in cameos and memes following his death. I hope this mans memory lives on forever
---
Basically permanent Legion frenzy for missed attacks, and a regular missed attack CD on successful hits. 
---
YOU... WHAT--GAAHHH YOU FORGOT BOI
---
Mouse and keyboard 
---
Sounds like a useful perk. 
---
Good, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs ded
---
Happens way more often than I expected, it's amazing.
---
I said it before I‚Äôll say it again, legion could be interesting if you focus on the emotional battle between being with frank or not, as well as fleshing out the other three‚Äôs personality 
---
Still got a skill check. After use it makes you the obsession, so no way to tell ahead of time. It‚Äôs also immune to dribble since the skillcheck starts during pick up. 
---
They confirmed the exact opposite for me.
---
The best kind of mind-gaming is running a 4-stack all with Object of Obsession. We tested in KYF a while back and when ONE survivor activates it, EVERY survivor can see the aura, but the killer only sees the survivor activating the perk. So we went into SWF games, all playing Laurie, and at the end the killer accused us of using teleporting hacks until we explained it.
---
I dunno if its been patched since, but its so much fun seeing the killer freak out about the teleporting survivor.
---
He does need some added strength to his base kit. Can... can I at least have another? Maybe a bit of extra movement speed when I'm out of stock? 
---
Legion would just be another teenage sob story about depression trying to make me feel sorry for the character
---
its probably because the perk becomes abnormally strong when playing against Legion. 
---
With any other killer its a good perk that rewards the spreading of damage. Works great with sloppy by making healing almost take 50% longer if everyone is injured. The issue is that if you use legion who can practically ensure all survivors are injured, the perk becomes abnormally strong. I believe this is the sole reason why it was taken back. 
---
Having the Thanta buff with legion would lead too an escalation of DC  against Legion as playing against him would become substantially more tedious for survivors.
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone would forget him, he is a hero to millions 
---
Depends, when I play Piggy I won't work with the survivor I test them. And I will make sure that the others don't die unless it is from a trap. 
---
Other killers tho, they don't getthe Saw test pass. Report them.
---
Not really, they aren‚Äôt depressed, but torn between being with frank or not, being a killer or not
---
There is definitely solid counterplay to Nurse. Being experienced enough as the Nurse to understand what obstacles are a huge pain in the ass to see/blink over is very helpful. If you break LOS (in a forest, building, etc.), she either has to blink to where she thinks you went, or spend time walking with her 96.25% movespeed just to spot you again, losing distance in the process. 
---
She's one of the only killers that depend more on their skill than a survivor's, so you just have to be as good of a survivor as she is at the Nurse. It's uncommon for a Nurse to be that good, even at red ranks, but if she's better you lose. Simple as that.
---
The only time this doesn't apply is if she has 3 or more blinks. That shits absurd. 
---
Yeah that works.. Untill you see the date is June 2016. The month the game was released.

---
Urban Evasions straight to the basement chest as soon as the match starts.
---
Again, staying permanently injured against a 115% killer is very risky, a good killer will down you, its not like legion which needs their power. Plus this assuming a full 4 man swf not healing, if one guy uses the fountain all the no mither people are even more at risk. 
---
Stay the fuck away from my Amanda!
---
JK its a joke.
---
I will break all the bones in your body if you trash talk my Piggy again.
---
What are you doing to get facecamped so often?
---
I used a timer and started it as soon as the spotlight appeared from the flashlight, and ended it as soon as it disappeared. Both timings are the same.
---
I just realized that was Stan Lee, lol. Its true though.
---
It's 1% less at every tier except for 1 gen (where it actually does something now) and all gens (where it's 1% better.)
---
wait whut? 
---
On legion it was dumb and it was another perk that made everything take way longer. If new thanatophobia just effected gens it could have been okay maybe but taking hours to heal isnt fun
---
I always do totems. There's only three outcomes:
---
-I single handedly stop NOED, and completely cripple the killer's endgame, often saving lives
---
-I don't manage to find every totem, in which case people die because no one but me ever does them
---
-The killer has no NOED, in which case free bonus points... but more often than not, they have NOED.
---
I still don't see why people complain about having to optionally do them. If losing ten seconds costs you the game, you were gonna lose anyway
---
Thats fair, i'm just disappointed. It would've benefitted my boi Freddy so much.
---
You healed against legion?
---
You're right, good SWF groups will do exactly that. I have yet to encounter a good SWF group.
---
If your definition of fun is having tbagging SWF cleanse it while you are hooking your first down sure. 
---
Deep down you're satisfied 
---
This one hit me hard :(
---
Shed feel like Jason, and his backstory is amazing. I'd feel more sympathetic to the huntress, though.
---
just felt like ranting. chill
---
They say they look into a lot of things, and i am starting to think they literally mean they look at them like once and then focus on other things.
---
&gt; I disagree with you tbh, normal movespeed killer playing tiles well can end chases fast.
---
It depends on the survivors you get. If you get some with a brain, its really damn hard. Some tiles you cant even play well E.G myers house infinite.
---
&gt; Also disagree completely about legion, they are broken and unfun but without there power they will not hit a survivor apart from swamp etc with huge deadzones.
---
It depends on the addons used tbh, double cooldown makes it so m1ing a survivor is super easy.
---
wait what? he had franks mixtape? didnt even notice
---
Yeah I just wear the nice sweaters that claudette has or the Doctor's nice purple suit.
---
I was just about to go as well lol. It was nice discussing with you too, have a good night. 
---
/laughs in Punishment/
---
The ASM series is criminally underrated
---
Plunderers tier 4
---
Wondering why a useless post was made doesn't mean I need to chill. Maybe the one who should is you.
---
Sad Oink :(
---
When it's the teabagging Bright Hair Girl main that neglected to notice they were Rancor'd from the start.
---
The new killer is not any worse at running those tiles than other killers.
---
I know right? We only got BBQ,Enduring,Spirit Furry,Ruin, M&amp;A and some other boring trash.
---
Then it gets cleansed during your wipe animation. 
---
Can't say I'm surprised. Thanta buffs would have made Legion so much more boring for survivors to play against. Would have become the Franks Mixtape just to have Thanta on Legion. 
---
A pretty good job so far
---
Lol perfect
---
Thought this was gonna assign a survivor to each spice girl :O
---
Existing 
---
Aww my luck is so bad I never get a Feng from the chest :(
---
franklins is sooooo nice up against flashlight clickin' asswipes who bring a white ward and then they shit their pants and cry when you smack them the first time.
---
Sloppy Butcher ? I don't think I had it at the moment...
---
Nevermind I did, I just forgot it was there.
---
Bloodhound Legions usually only run it to moonwalk cheese and there is 0 point to moonwalk when you are running Frank's Mixtape with Cold Dirt.
---
My Myers is now level 8 and have Sloppy Butcher and Monitor and Abuse.
---
Haddonfield as a whole needs changing, there isnt enough pallets but there is way too many dumb window loops, lerys and the game too.
---
Right now id settle for them changing that basement that appears on haddonfield/preschool so the window cant spawn at the top of the stairs
---
@vro I feel like the Spirit is...TECHNICALLY in a lot of movies already.
---
Gotta work towards that achievement! 
---
BBQ is meh, only really good on Nurse and Billy.
---
Enduring is good I'll give you that.
---
Spirit Fury only works with Enduring, its bad on its own.
---
Ruin is inconsistant and most survivors can just power through it lmao.
---
Monitor is good yup I'll give you that too.
---
Can you name anything else? Bc survivors have Sprint Burst Lithe Dead Hard Balanced Adrenaline DS Borrowed Time Unbreakable Distortion and Urban Evasion. I could name more.
---
Part of a commission set for u/SpinningBandicoot :-D
---
looping the killer for 3 gens doesn't deserve a facecamp.
---
teabagging does. 100%.
---
Chill, hag.  They can post whatever they want, if you don't like it then scroll past it like a normal, non-toxic human being.
---
not kinda, 100%.
---
Not really, apart from her height being a nuisance. It's why most m1 killers are trash.
---
I really think Rin could have a really fun movie as the villain where here lore isn‚Äôt the focus of the story, I.e she‚Äôs the slasher ghost haunting the abandoned yamoaka estate 
---
Yes that‚Äôs why I put her high up
---
Sadly when paired with perks like SB and certain addons it just makes the game far to slow. Not to mention legion being even more annoying when using it, which is something the devs clearly want to avoid. 
---
This certainly is a low effort meme, but since you announced it I can appreciate it.
---
Technically it shows it on the perk icon in the bottom right corner but if you're looking at that you're not really looking at anything in front of you
---
That thing made me a nervous wreck before I realized you could gently press the tooth and feel tension to tell if it was rigged or not
---
As a new player, of course i'm scared of the killer. If I have the leg up i'm good at keeping line of sight broken and running circles around them but if they end up behind me I have no clue what to do. They're faster than me and I have no idea how to actually break away from them. It seems they're always on my ass. What do I do?
---
all of my games have been like this lol big yikes
---
Really, I argue that BBQ is great on every killer. Sure, Nurse and Billy obviously kill with it. But imagine: Myers with Tombstone build or something, finding the locations of stalkable survivors; a Freddy learning the locations of people not yet asleep; the Doctor figuring out if the survivors are hiding in locker or not; the Spirit figuring out where to phase to. The only killers I would argue it's bad on is SORTA The Doctor, since he's liable to find survivors anyway, and arguably the Hag, since she has to have a certain add-on to make use of that and she's got 110%, but really, I still say it's great on every killer for the *raw* information it tells you. Plus...bloodpoints.

---
Im brutally bad at looping, but this one time the killer was brutally bad at chasing too, i got chased for like 5 minutes because the place i was at had a. Lot of pallets and curves, during that whole time they only did 1 gen and i can swear i saw one of my teammates just staring at the distance 
---
Thank you! :)
---
i mean it could be the devs being lazy, or maybe it's intentional, like he died or something.
---
Thanks! :)
---
I don't see the common sense from you but okay.
---
Have you considered an idea that the rest of the team just gets bored of holding m1 and want to actually play the game, that's why they go for the hook save?
---
The killer removes all of the interaction from the match by facecamping. People get bored of holding m1 all match, might as well play cookie clicker for how much multiplayer that experience is.
---
Stop victim blaming sweaty. Turbo yikes!
---
hahahah yessss
---
I heard this song playing not even 5 minutes ago
---
In the video, the survivor do a medium vault. You will never escape a hit doing that, nor are you supposed to. The issue there is that the survivor did not run the shack properly 
---
That's exactly why I click the flashlight at them, I suck at chases, but if I'm the one that appears to be the toxic runner of the team, then the killer leaves me alone to go gen jocky. It works more often than not, but the moment I finally do get chased and downed, I imagine they feel like an idiot for letting me get away with the clicking for so long. I was secretly the weak link of the team with all bark, but no bite. This game is all about the mind-games after all.
---
Same lmao
---
Depends how much the urban evader has done in the game. If they have carried their weight I would go the other way and not expect them to get me but it is frustrating when you know that person has been hiding majority of the game. Recently happened with me where I died on hook so someone could get the hatch only to find they had 3000 BP and had pretty much crept about the edges of the map. 
---
Which spider man movie is this from?
---
I burned a Survival BP offering.
---
Fuck yo stack.
---
Meg, Jane, Feng, Kate and Claudette maybe? üòÑ
---
You'll get camped even if you play normally, you have too much faith in people.
---
*finally. some good fuckin' food*
---
Classic üòÖ
---
lads
---
Yes, close. It's unfortunate that another stun is affected by an already meta perk, but hey, that's what Enduring *does*. Not everything is supposed to work out in the survivors' favor. 
---
lol you're gonna get fucking worshiped. This subreddit loves people who play killer but don't actually play the game
---
How does one ragequit at third hook? They are dead anyway.
---
&gt; Killer ability to vomit until survivor breaks and then hit them seems really strong. Corrupt purge though looks a bit weak due to short timer and having to travel to gain power.
---
I feel like survivors are going to find a way to counter this very eaisly. Hugging trees or objects, idk. You can crouch behind a pallet and the stream wont hit you, that shit needs to be fixed. I agree with your points about corrupt purge though.
---
&gt; Dark devotion sounds really good for killing your obsession. Obsession going to find it really hard to loop you without you having a red stain. Too short of a timer for any stealth plays.
---
Potentially yeah, would have to test it more. Agreed with the point about stealth plays.
---
&gt; Corrupt intervention as you said sounds great. Gives you an idea were survivors are and plays against SWF shroud of binding.
---
Agreed, I'm feeling like this perk will make Hag Nurse tier.
---
&gt; Infectious Freight seems incredibly powerful for slowing down the game by slugging and then switching targets. Places so much pressure. Wonder if it will be meta changing.
---
Definitely with Mike and Nurse, I'm snapping that perk up ASAP.
---
&gt; Poised looks quite nice if combined with sprint burst. Can really help immersed survivors that don't want to be chased.
---
Maybe, I just dont think it will be run often, especially when the meta survivor perks exist.
---
&gt; The new healing perk seems strong against anti-heal builds. Combine with We will make it and you got fast heals. Don't think it will be meta
---
Yeah it might be alright, but like I said before, the meta perks exist so it wont be run
---
&gt; Head on is just a meme. No real practical use just seems like an easy way to die due to how situational it is. Especially if killer has enduring. Personally, I don't think it should be an exhaustion perk. Just have a timer for use on it. The timer means it cannot be really used in a chase and if the survivor is one you were chasing then they have likely already used their exhaustion perk.
---
yup lmao
---
Thank you, I appreciate it :D!!
---
As someone who hit Rank 1 playing nothing but Wraith... fuck you :P
---
As someone who has since branched out into other killers and finally realized that Wraith really is extremely weak in comparison to most... you're not wrong.
---
Killer facecamping one guy while giving the rest a huge advantage also removes all interaction from the match. Most people get bored if all they do all game is hold m1. People want to be chased/interact with their team and the killer.
---
By facecamping all you get is a boring match.
---
Other killers could just make so much use out of it, it sucks that Legion is holding it back.
---
Dude look at what he's wearing, he's practically asking for it
---
Why are you so angry all the time, haddonfield is the worst killer map I said that, but take away its windows and survivors have nothing to work with. The game and lerys have opposite problems imo, they dont reward skill/map knowledge just run straight and hope you find something, but every pallet is safe
---
Yikes, yep you are right on that one.
---
Bloodlust exsists there isnt infinites anymore, its a broken structure but its not an infinite 
---
Nah adds appear because of your search history and your interests you were doing some weird shit on your phone
---
So this just makes him an m1 killer? Does he have a power that he can use?
---
I love the coordinates though, haha xD I am main survivor. Guess I'll wait for a Nea one xD but always love your art :) 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Freddy going to have some real nice map pressure with Corrupt. Fewer gens to fail skill checks with as well meaning you can potentially burn out half the maps pallets before the timer runs out. Constantly running into other survivors working on gens while you are chasing will be great too.
---
What do you mean, freddy cant have map pressure, 7 seconds fedora man bad lol
---
&gt;  like how Thanta indirectly buff legion.
---
Not any more rip.
---
Wait how was tinker nerfed
---
no where near as bad as it used to be, now you can do stuff about it (most of the time)
---
You're faster than them and balanced only helps them once theres no reason you shouldnt catch them to a chase again.
---
Looks like a  higher ping too me haha xD didn't know it's already that bad at 300
---
I fucking wish I had Alert ;-;
---
I doesn't but that's not the issue. 
---
Its the fact that the whole game will be slowed significantly. If the legion has sloppy then healing is 46% slower with Thanta combined. Gens are 25% slower giving the legion so much free time. If he combines with ruin then gens get even slower. 
---
lol mods removed your post
---
Oh man, you‚Äôll hate my current solo survivor build.
---
Deliverance, Break Down, Kindred and Alert.
---
Deliverance for that sweet yeet (and also the achievement)
---
Break Down and Alert so I know where the killer is both before and after I yeet myself.
---
Kindred so if I get hooked first and can‚Äôt Deliverance I can still be of some use on the hook.
---
You can't beat em, so join em, be as toxic as possible. Run Legion with Frank's Mixtape, use Huntress' ethereal hatchets, Spirit's beads, Nurse's omegablink.
---
Fuck them, their made-up bullshit rules, and their entitled attitudes.
---
Screaming was never really annoying for me, hm. But I guess I'm alone who doesn't care.
---
And illusions on level 2 is an (insanely OP) addon, though. 2 sec stan isn't actually that terrifying and requires a lot of muscle memory and good timing to pay off, and even then, it doesn't always guarantee a hit. Cannot say anything about fps drop on console, though. Idk, I never thought that his abilities are an ass to deal with, and the only reason Doc can be any good is with right perks and addons, however I respect your opinion. 
---
No it doesnt. The stagger reduction means that they will always get to the window again.
---
The worst is when you're being chased down for fucking 5 minutes and no one do a gen in the meanwhile. SMH
---
Can you pm it to me too pls ^^ I love salt
---
When I was doing the heavy burden achievement I let them finish gens then picked one up and headed for the door. That way I could hit some of them before dropping the survivor. They might have been doing the achievement for killing survivors after the last gen was done/door was open 
---
It depends on the rank you are before the reset. The reset is more significant the lower your rank is.  
---
I was rank 1 and I was deranked to rank 10.
---
LOL even the mods are entitled survivors!
---
the top mod is a hag main, but the rest who knows
---
It's a shitpost.
---
Idk man, just trying to add something to the discussion. Fuck. Don't get on my case. 
---
Its bearable in my opinion its annoying but bearable. There are other maps that I dont like.
---
Fake it, make them fall off then back track to meet them if you cant catch them 
---
Was it just the first time? I could swear I saw them for a while for the same killer. 
---
At least take empathy, IMO.
---
His deserves at least gold
---
*Sprint burst is good but SO overvalued in my humble opinion,a perk that resets your bad placement is not god tier compared to other exhaustion perks, i myself have come to prefer DH over it.
---
* Speaking of DH, in the state the game is in it can also be a meh perk, also it can be baited more easily than one might think 
---
*Balanced like many say is broken ona few maps, ok on others and dead in like one or two
---
*Lithe will get a good quality of life in the next patch, but is still only situationaly great, mostly on those Dance With Me builds.
---
*BT is solid as hell yes, it's sad less people run it on my games.
---
*Unbreakable, as much as i love it, it's by it's nature a situational perk, great and game changing but not to the degree one might think most of the time.
---
*Distortion, somewhat solid, but it won't win you a game if the killer can chew through the tokens or if your aura being hidden means someone else, potentially ill prepared for a round of looping, gets to be hunted next over you.
---
*Urban Evasion, a perk that can wield great results and helps greatly in stealth builds, but usually a good search around the area you think a survivor is will force them out so it's not without a counter.
---
As for other good killer perks, NOED is still kicking ass left and right and i don't wanna hear that it can be cleansed before it activates cause that's bull if you cause even slight pressure on survivors, Make your choice is fine for killers that can take advantage of it, and yes taking advantage of it means to get back to the hook and not rely on luck to find the rescuer like you see people do, STBFL has been a huge help to m1 killers, Nurse's Calling remains a great aura perk, Sloppy Butcher because people undervalue the added extra healing time over the whole match, Tinkerer is a great addition to some builds, it does favor faster killers but is fine for the rest too, Whispers is a perk that needs getting used to but it's a super beneficial tracking perk
---
He's basically just a M1killer now. :P What do you think would fit in something like this?
---
Killer burned one of those brown offerings last night for Coldwind that was retired, and I knew I was in for some shit. 
---
I wasn't using it to criticize anything, I like Enduring affecting DS. 
---
I do gens every game, but there‚Äôs a difference from, ‚ÄúI need to do this gen to get out‚Äù to ‚ÄúI get to sit 5 gens for a few minutes cause the killer is afked in front of a hook‚Äù it isn‚Äôt fun. Weird how you decided to make an assumption because I dislike killers doing the least fun thing in the game.
---
B*tch, I got like 20 o'these and don't need to farm to do well. 
---
Unnerving presence, M&amp;A, ruin, bbq and distressing with double calm, they will never hit a skill check again
---
One of three questions were answered. Thanks 
---
Nurse = No fun as well
---
Look dude, it was a joke. Quit taking it seriously. 
---
Dismissing your post isn't having a debate. 
---
I beat Nurses far more often than they beat me because few good ones exist. Doesn't mean she isn't busted. 
---
You muddled your argument just to try to insult me instead. Good on ya', dumbass. Lmao
---
Still not getting into this debate. I'm right, you're wrong. That sounds ignorant and rude, I know. And I also don't care. Because I know it's also correct. 
---
I as a killer main can approve this and im sorry for all of you innocent survivors that i have camped out of frustration
---
I feel like if people get upset over an animation in a video game, they aren't using their brain.
---
His cosmetics are so god damned terrible
---
That‚Äôs racist!
---
unpopular opinion but yeah, back when survivors were very strong Nurse was a necessary evil, but I think she's a bit too powerful for the current days of DBD. Though I'm afraid of her being nerfed too much, as she needs more of a tweak than a nerf.
---
The legion is supposed to be getting a rework though I am interested in how they intend to change him. I doubt that will be coming out soon though due to the introduction of the plague. Maybe in the next few months, we will see them update legion but based on their previous history of changing legion it doesn't look promising. 
---
Infectious freight will be strong on killers like Myers but it does have a counter. Calm spirit totally negates the aspect of the perks power and gives the killer a false sense of security if no notifications do pop up. Even then the perk might still be nerfed. Will be interesting to see how the community reacts to it as a whole.
---
True but his bottles aren‚Äôt as good. That‚Äôs why to me, they are the same level. 
---
If you don't want to be screamed at by survivors then close the chat box. Helps you deal with the onslaught of survivor tears. 
---
If you t-bag you're intentionally humiliating the killer. AKA having fun at the expense of someone else. That's malicious.
---
Yes, there was a time of abuse from survivors said which badly called for the creation of sth like the nurse. I agree.
---
In the comments simeonebmentioned refillable blinks like hunters hatchets might be a way to deal with her
---
Yeah I was gonna say that if you can‚Äôt escape as survivor we had a problem.
---
I'm of the opinion that Freddy doesn't need a rework, just some minor buffs. I dunno what would fit in your idea.
---
What do you even mean by that?
---
For 1 chapter? I mean I still really want to see it but...
---
mood
---
Big facts. Fuck survivor mains. Gang 
---
There's not a lot of games where you take the role of a supernatural murderer, especially in online games, whereas there's plenty where you're put into a survival role. That dynamic alone contributes to a lot of the entitlement, it's harder to empathize with the killer's role unless you play it. Trying hard to survive just *sounds* better than trying hard to kill, right? There's also the (arguably incorrect) assumption that the killer is in the position of power over the other players, and so there's more obligation not to abuse it.
---
Did you keep the receipt? I asked for a Jane Romero
---
"Holding M1 all game is boring" that's literally all survivors do other than get chased. 
---
Hatred brewing...
---
I don't think so, but we'll see after everybody get used to her. Personally I'm glad that we have another really good killer! I just hope the new achievements are not as hard as the Legion one 
---
You‚Äôre right that his bottles don‚Äôt instantly end the chase the second they hit someone, but if the clown is good then the chase more than 30 seconds tops. That chase potential with none of the downsides that trapper suffers is what makes him good
---
A movie about the Nurse would actually make for an extremely good slow paced suspense movie. Start with a period piece showing a nurse working in a hospital in rough conditions, slowly becoming disenfranchised and losing all hope of ever truly helping people.
---
Following the death of her husband in the First World War she loses her mind and begins to smother patients to death, and abuses chloroform for a more dangerous high, when she kills she collects the last breath of her victims in a bottle before the bombs fall and destroy the hospital and the Nurse with it.
---
Fast forward to present day and a group of pretentious history students decide to make a documentary on the history of the hospital and the legend of Sally Smithson only to find themselves being stalked by a floating, ethereal entity, whose only aim is to choke the life out of them so with their last breath she may finally feel alive again.
---
Damn your right that‚Äôd be pretty cool
---
They do, almost always. If you wanna overreact due to own bad match you had in which you made far too many mistakes, whine to someone else. I‚Äôm not up to dealing with crappy points right now. 
---
‚ÄúThe Last Breath‚Äù
---
Tag line: Breathe your last
---
Understandable. It just creates too many complaints sadly. 
---
If he is even 2 milimeters to far from you when he revs it and he doesn't have addons the chainsaw isn't hitting and on console due to the doodoo framerate if you just run in a circle the game drops to 6 fps for the killer so you know
---
Welp, RIP my interest in Coulrophobia Doc.  I guess I might as well throw in the towel on playing him since I hate running generic chaser/stall builds.
---
Depends on how frequent and for what. Playing killer log enough you can tell when people are trying to BM you, other times you can appreciate the play, I know not to check the gates at a bad loss because people are just grouped as 3-4 teabagging. It‚Äôs the reasoning why that makes it malicious annnnnd it‚Äôs easy to tell
---
Mori spamming is amazing when killing a particularly annoying survivor. There‚Äôs nothing they can do to stop it. 
---
I like the hard achievements tbh as it gives us something to aim for. 
---
What ones are you struggling with?
---
neW pLAyEr
---
Players* are like this, no need to single out one half of the playerbase. It exists in every game, it‚Äôs simply more noticeable in dbd as you tend to play one side more than the other meaning you are obviously going to notice the opposing sides douchey moves over your own sides. That and there‚Äôs 4 potential assholes when you play killer and 1 as survivor. 
---
Lmfao maybe they shouldn‚Äôt be picking fights with people who can ruin their game like that? I‚Äôm not gonna get mad if I go shot for shot with someone who punches hard if when he punches as hard as he can it‚Äôs 3x worse than mine... that‚Äôs silly. You poke a bear and it snaps at you I can‚Äôt blame the bear, you provoked it???
---
But to be honest here, the sound of a bear trap trapping someone is satisfying as fuck. Even as a survivor.
---
This is why I‚Äôll always chase the bait, sometimes it‚Äôs a bluff and sometimes ill get lucky and they‚Äôll fuck up, if I can tell they‚Äôre going to be a problem I‚Äôll give up after about 30 seconds and go for someone else. Some people are insanely good at looping but most are not, it‚Äôs worth trying most of the time. 
---
As a whole I play both sides, but overall I see a lot more toxic survivors than toxic killers
---
Basically encouraging and making deranking easier 
---
Yet here you are still trying to convince me that you're right. Is that not what a debate is? I bet you're gonna reply to this one too and keep it going. 
---
So you say you beat Nurses all the time? Good for you. For a character who apparently has no counterplay you sure seem to be confident in beating them. I beat Trappers far more often than they beat me because few good ones exist. Doesn't mean he's busted. This argument is invalid. It almost seems like a player who is good at their main killer can do well and 4k with them. Hmm...
---
You can go ahead and keep thinking you're right all the time. I'm sure it'll help you get better at facing the Nurse. After all, you're almighty and infallible, right?
---
Choose wisely. One of them is probably Haunted Ground.
---
lol, thanks for noticing, Tha Engrish not mai ferst languuuuuuu! Just kidding I fucked up.
---
i run noed on a lot of my killers because its extremely strong when the end game hits and i get salt from survivors for running it when they haven't even powered up the gates  i should switch it up tho its useless sometimes 
---
I more or less meant that I hate running Ruin.  None of the other alternatives really do much in the current Adrenaline meta unless you're playing an already high tier killer.
---
*Basement camps in sadness* btw Happy cake day! 
---
come and get y'all juice 
---
Its hard to actually play killer imo. You just eat pallets or people have a metal breakdown. No right way to play and I dont feel accomplished at the end of the game

Every -rep, every KYS, every camping/tunneling accusation, every complain on gameplay style, etc.

---
Nurse would make an excellent movie wym? Did you read her back story, just seeing her go though the mental snap and maybe have one of the people who get killed one of the main people you follow as they get hunted down by Nurse.
---
That's the meme i always think about when I see an Adam ingame
---
This happens to me all the time lmao it‚Äôs so odd 
---
If a trophy is specifically for a certain killer or survivor, they will list that character's name in the trophy description. Typically these are the adept trophies as well as the one or two killer specific trophies. The other trophies are universal
---
&gt;No, but we would like to change Dying Light, so that it is less tunneling and oppressive. 
---
Why not just do the things you would "like" to do? Make it so Dyling Light's debuff only applies as long as the Obsession is in injured, dying or hooked state. There, this could be in the game tomorrow, minutes of work, no? Just like a ton of other subpar perks could be quickly and easily be improved, in the matter of days. It's been years.
---
&gt;Decisive Strike and Head On will now be affected by Enduring.
---
Head On is unfortunately a meme-tier perk on its own already, so not much of value is lost there. New-DS actually seemed nice however, disincentivizing tunnelling/farming off hook, a way to stay in the game and actually get a chance to a fair chase, for the respective farmed/tunelled survivor - yet, with a ~1.71s stun time against Enduring (an already ubiquitous perk), killers can do those same things more-or-less just as well; without a pallet or window right there, you are going down again shortly thereafter.
---
I think especially in light of the existence of Spirit Fury, Enduring should be reduced to 50%.
---
&gt;We have adjusted the stackable bonus of Fire Up to be 3/3.5/4%
---
Neat, but I think 5% would be better. Having Brutal Strength's 20% only in the end game, where most safe pallets should regularly already be gone, is just not worth it, and in reality, Fire Up has to compete with Brutal Strength for ever being considered for a spot in meta builds. Alternatively, make it so Fire Up gains all 7 tokens, in the end game.
---
&gt;We are thinking of changing the insta-heals in our game into heals over time instead. This means that instead of instantly being healed a health state, you will initiate the heal and it will take several seconds before you are fully healed.
---
So if the last genuinely powerful item in survivor play is set to be nerfed that significantly, when is the Mori nerf coming? The single-most unbalanced item still in the game.
---
&gt;We always review the Perks at some point based on players feedback and data collected. Live team will follow these closely once the Perk goes live.
---
Is that so? I wonder how many of the new or "buffed" perks from any of the patches now see more than like 5% of use, in red rank play (to be fair, probably more now that red ranks are full of new and inexperienced players). Nevertheless it have still been relatively few perks that have been adjusted at all, after years and years. If they were actually closely following the perk landscape, one would think they'd notice that the perks that see any regular use whatsoever are the same few that have been for years - mostly since launch, even. They've probably nerfed more perks into unviability than they have adjusted others to elevate them into that very limited pool (Tinkerer, Vigil, Resilience, Unrelenting, Shadowborn, Save The Best For Last (which is now thankfully usable again), Saboteur (well, the sabotage mechanic), ...).
---
It seems so obvious and simple to me, to rework a whole bunch of perks, to make them viable choices, freshen up the gameplay and diversify the metagame, make things exciting without the need for a constant flow of content. The pool of S-tier choices for both sides amounts to about 9-10 perks, respectively, out of more than 50 available total, respectively. Most of those perks having been there for years. Why not take a few weeks to think about ways to make that pile of subpar perks actually powerful and impactful enough to re-define the metagame, which is, to actually at all change how the game is played... and then rework them? Utilize a few PTBs and player feedback from veterans of the game and it should be a fairly managable undertaking.
---
&gt;We have reverted the Thanataphobia buff for this patch and we will be looking to update the different healing components together in addition to Thanataphobia in a future patch.
---
RE: Resilience: You've said you were considering giving Resilience (and Spine Chill) the window vault speed modifier back. In the PTB, Resilience still mentions vaulting, but it still does not affect vaulting. Has there been any decision made on this? The new vault animation/momentum change removed this feature that made Resilience an actually viable loadout choice, whereas it did not even achieve what it set out to, namely making ridiculous post-vault hits less of an occurrence - in fact, this change has made ridiculous post-vault hits even more common an occurrence.
---
I also think Resilience (and Spine Chill and possibly Leader) still shorten Dead Hard's dash distance.
---
My suggestion for a Thanatophobia buff would be to keep its current (underwhelming) numbers, but have them affect the same set of actions that Resilience and Spine Chill used to - while also making Resilience and Spine Chill affect those same actions again. So Thanatophobia would reduce vault speeds, and such, while Resilience and Spine Chill would again speed those actions up. Additionally, these perks could also affect pallet interactions, so pallet drop and pallet vault speeds.
---
&gt;We still believe that just like the Spirit, players will overtime accommodate to her unique play style and discover her true power.
---
I'm not saying Plague is a weak killer (although there is the issue that survivors can just opt to stay injured and deny Plague her powerful ability, that way, basically rendering her a vanilla M1 killer (ignoring add-ons that otherwise enable her to)), but it is not fair to say that people "discovered Spirit's true power": Spirit has received a plethora of adjustments that made her what she is today and very much was not in the PTB. Directional phasing sound, phasing sound after 8 meters, telltale signs of her model when entering phase, short lunge, weaker add-ons. (Spirit's in-phase collision with survivors should be removed, by the way.)
---
I do think Plague is a good and unique-enough killer design (even if she seems like a mash-up of a bunch of existing killer designs), and so was Spirit, as well as Clown, and so... after that Legion thing, we might be back on track for good original killer designs, fingers crossed!
---
if the killer is swinging, its a type of mod that spams the attack bttn or m1 (pc) 
---
Standing Idle: Afk killer
---
I've seen some dedicated people here saying to ban these people as they are "ruining" the game. As a form of  deranking to play against "newer" people.
---
Farming/botting is bannable but deranking is not 
---
i don't see the harm as its free game/points but i'm a console player idk how it affects the game on pc 
---
Lol, that almost never happens to me
---
Rip No0b3
---
My reasoning was that teleportation is an interesting power in dbd but not in a movie
---
This is 5 months late, but you practically described my go-to build.
---
Lithe, Quick and Quiet, Dance With Me, Decisive Strike.
---
I've played it with lightweight, but it honestly is not worth to stack with dance with me. Plus, decisive strike synergizes well with this build, as you can get away almost every time after using it.
---
Yes, that's the idea; if a Doctor sees that there are no auras but KNOWS that the survivors aren't near the hook, that tells him to start checking lockers for immersed Nea players.
---
Infinite are 100% gone, but some loops can last so long they feel it (looking at you wretched shop...)
---
Convincing you and being cordial enough to respond aren't the same thing, especially when it comes with the added benefit of disrespecting you consistently. The fact that I'm legitimately reading maybe two or three lines of text out of your essays should have tipped you off to that by now. Maybe you're desperate for attention, idk. Maybe I would be too if I were as wrong as you are right now. 
---
Either way, really don't care nor does it matter what your opinion is. As I said, you're either ignorant or delusional or both. 
---
I don‚Äôt know them walking around finding a way out through a asylum dead silence a loud ass screech out of no where and some floating creepy nurse spanks you with a bone say would be scary lol
---
How do you DM? I want one !
---
Maybe dont play like an asshole then.
---
Devs read the forums but a plague/spitting character isnt that unusual.
---
See if it was an asshole that was getting camped I'd understand. But I will never understand the logic behind "you exist. you get camped." 
---
r/wepoopyshitty
---
Imagine being the exact kind of player this is targeted towards and completely missing the point
---
It is, I should try this!
---
It 100% wouldn't be a new meta perk, but at least it would have crawled out from out of the gutter
---
At some point and for a while after i started, they fucked with the rarity of perks actually, at higher levels you were more likely to find an ultra rare perk than a common uncommon or Rare version, this was something i remember being a pain because if i didn't get a good enough tier of a low level perk for a character like Iron Will or Iron grasp i'd be waiting until well into the 50+s to get the rest of them, i also remember other peeps reporting the same issue, it got fixed when they made all Perks Yellow Green and Purple tho
---
You're not venting but I am. Both survivors and killers can be equally biased in their stupidity
---
They sank through the map making them impossible to see.
---
That's the thing though, I know about all that. I only vaulted like that bc it was a mistake.
---
What I mean is I'm often dead within 10 seconds of being spotted because I have pretty much no window of opportunity like in this clip. I still don't know what I was supposed to do there 
---
https://youtu.be/StwKmvZw-jI
---
(Props to the Pig in the vid tho. Managed to be the last one alive and she carried me to the latch and let me escape)
---
Yeah but as trapnslap said, 4:1 in terms of players. You‚Äôre bound to see more toxic survivors but to assume everyone who plays survivor specifically is an asshole just isn‚Äôt reasonable imo. 
---
&gt;epic battle scene with her mom being killed
---
epic???
---
Bring them to a jungle gym and either pallet loop or window loop. If you go down thats okay if you escape even better. Chances are youre gonna go down and thats okay. Use up as much of the killers time as you can. Try to bring the killer as far away from people doing gens or someone on the hook as possible. I like to bring one of the speed perks like lithe, balanced landing. Dead hard also works great for getting that extra couple of feet to a pallet or window. Its gonna take practice you cab watch how people play on twitch or youtube to get an idea.

Not to be that person (which I will be) but Nurse could make for an epic psychological Horror Movie. Will the right Camera work and some good scenes her spiralling towards Insanity would make an amazing movie.
---
Would probably be low-key tricky to pull off though, I guess. And it would definitely not be for classic slasher fans I suppose.
---
I‚Äôm sure they could pull that off and would be cool
---
No Mither is toxic? Literally launching the game is an act of toxicity to some of you people. 
---
Never forget ;&lt;
---
Oh lol I literally just commented the same thing without seeing your comment. Glad to see I'm not the only one who thinks that.
---
I don't get what you're complaining about here. People getting angry in the endgame chat? You can always just disable it if the amount of "toxic" messages is too much. People are gonna get angry at video games and say stupid and abhorrent shit, you shouldn't just chalk it up to "survivor main bad".
---
This makes me so angry... i thought we might finally get some new perk to use instead of going ruin 24/7
---
They have to make the game welcoming to newbies, too. That‚Äôs the whole reason why SWF is still allowed in public matches. 
---
Yup!
---
Monkeys. Room. Typewriter. 
---
Just play the game how you want and ignore everyone else, people tend to create imaginary rules for this game and get upset when it doesn't go their way. As for the whole rushing thing, the point of the match as a survivor is to finish the gens asap and gtfo. Just have fun with it and if you like playing with friends I'm always looking for buddies to play with :)

XD hahaha

just felt like venting. calm

i was gonna camp this ds using teabagging feng but ace got killed
---
Watch people be triggered over this joke
---
Yeah and on top of that you has survivors that haven‚Äôt learned to play well mixed with those that do
---
Thats the intention 
---
Vaulting back is the only option you can do, and it gives the survivor a massive distance gain.
---
It is so boring to play against him 8 out of 10 games in red ranks :(
---
It would've been meta on spirit, nurse and legion, but it would've discouraged facecamping so idk. 
---
Oh my god please tell me you are joking. 
---
CAN KILLER MAINS PLS STOP RELYING ON NOED AND ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME? I KEEP GETTING KILLERS THAT DONT HOOK, SMACK, OR CHASE AND LET US GEN RUSH JUST TO DOWN ALL OF US AT THE LAST SEC. THOSE 10K POINTS ARE REALLY NOT WORTH IT
---
I mean, as a survivor, you can't FORCE the killer to do anything. No matter what you do the person on that keyboard controls their own actions. They get some control over what happens to YOU, as that is part of the game, but if you're going to base your enjoyment on the way people play, you're in for a rough time in Dead by Daylight.

Idk about spirit, she still is a single target killer
---
Me computer broke
---
You cant mindgame the drop, the survivor will only drop when they see the killer start to vault.
---
Haha that went completely over this dude's head. Must be one of those survivors lol
---
Hopefully they come up with something else and give perks like Resilience a bit of a bump to make it more viable. 
---
No.

So thanks for confirming I'm right. I make a habit of it. 
---
I always get an oh fuck sensation when I see No Mither and  thanataphobia in the same match. lol
---
I¬¥m confused this looks normal to me .-.
---
&gt; Mindgame the transition, make use of the times you are invisible to switch directions.
---
I do do this. But that's still an insanely long time and survivors who aren't morons are good at knowing where to go. And you're not totally invisible during the transition. You know this.
---
&gt; Console?
---
Yep
---
Also, tracking scratch marks is really hard with him, especially with how the devs fucked them up a patch or two ago
---
&gt; Did you get the wipe animation?
---
No, but her skill check failure didn't happen until my hand went through her. 
---
&gt; Hes not a good endgame killer, hes best at the midgame.
---
...End game is when his power is most reliable. At every other point in the game survivors can get out of the Dream World stupid easy
---
&gt; Try to sleep as many people as possible, keep people in the dream world. Use your natural stall to slow the game down
---
I know that you're very defense of Freddy, but you know that this is just not viable. I had all 4 people in the Dream World and got one person down within 10 seconds of this happening and one person was out already before I finished the pick-up animation and then the other two popped out after I got d-striked and they had an extra 5 seconds
---
You shouldnt challenge him. He knows everything.
---
Aw, thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíö
---
I feel the best way to fix legion is map design. He wouldn't be such a problem if survivors had more than 2 ways of escaping. Not only that but it'd also give room for better and more threatening killers.
---
Also if you kill the insanely good person, you can feel better. The nuisance I spent time on dealing with much more relieving when dealt with. I'm fine if that happens when I play killer but I'm livid if he gets out.
---
Are you fucking serious?!  Now I have to continue running stupid ruin just to get a chance at slowing generators.  Fuck this.

You don't have to do things the "correct" way, but ignoring and demeaning actual advice on how to be better just to feel "superior" and "intelligent" on Reddit is legitimately depressing. I actually kinda feel bad for you tbh. If you truly make a habit out of intentionally being a prick to anyone you meet just to seem like you're the smartest one in the room, then that's a big yikes. If you're like this all the time, then I wish you luck on your social life, cause holy fuck you sure need it.

My best guess is you didn't hook one or two people twice
---
Ah, shoo! No, there was one that didn't get rescued a second time. :'( 
---
This happened with a Leatherface and a Legion. I don‚Äôt know why, especially since the latter seemed interested in farming.
---
Everyone got two hooks for sure! But not three ...

Trapper could probably lift me

I'm a survivor, but I don't believe I'm entitled to win. Yeah, facecamping sucks, especially in the endgame, but I can't control the killer's actions, nor the actions of my fellow survivors. It's all just part of the game. Although I will report the killer if I end up facecamped on my first hook at the beginning of the match.

Wraith is just wraith

What? No the survivor will only drop down when the killer will vault the window. Theres no mindgaming it.

As a trapper main I avoid Noed like a plague. Most of the time I finish a game with either 0-1 gens done so there's no point in bringing it. You'd be surprised how many people trap themselves on my ruin totem anyways.
