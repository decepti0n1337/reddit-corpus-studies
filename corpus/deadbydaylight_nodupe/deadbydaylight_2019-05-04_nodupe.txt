As much as I like Legion these are, imo, broken. One button removes a perk. Vault speed is fine and doesn't need increase. Leave the tapes alone.
---
Prestige 3. Whenever you prestige a character you get a cosmetic of their basic gear covered in blood. It’s arguably the darkest outfit on Claudette.
---
Thanks man
---
Exactly why I hate double BP events. Seems like the most toxic people come out for it. I never use streamers during the event simply bc I know I won't get any use out if them if the killer sees me first.
---
Cmon man, we all know you can do better bait than this
---
I actually lol'ed irl from this
---
Then die!
---
In game I mean
---
why
---
most of my friends are saving BPS only if the killer is messaging them that s/he wants to farm
---
I saw a Michael high up in the window and I ran. He saw me. 😥
---
Opposite has been true for me this time around.
---
Guide on how to get killers to be friendly:
---

---
Have a teammate and yourself to go a little fire barrel and crouch around it while looking up to have your character’s chin touch it.  This has worked for me and a friend multiple times, often they are friendly, or walk away.
---
There's no way they're not announcing Ghostface right? There's so much hinting towards it almost feels like they're trying to fool us.
---
You can call it all you want I've never rage quit a dead by daylight game. Im sure I've rage quit a halo game way back when but I cant necessarily remember it. I'd call that a weak moment regardless. I've certainly raged make no mistake but not quit and ruin the game for everyone else and certainly not for something that happens all the time in this game. At that point just dont play.
---
Not completely true...  water has served both as a means to imprison Jason and kill him in his own movies.  When he's in New York and they drown him in the sewer stands out.
---
This is so wholesome
---
Quality meme.
---
No... where did you get this from lmao?
---
well, youre not wrong in saying i need help, but that doesnt make your idea any better
---
I like the idea of having survivors slowly falling asleep the whole game--that was the best part of the Freddy movies was the fact that you HAD to go to sleep sometime.
---
Maybe you can stave it off with a skill check which start coming faster and get harder as well.
---
Another possibility would be a survivor not know if they are awake or asleep--that was the other cool part of the movies. But like your fellow survivors could tell you are asleep and wake you up.
---
I've gotten exactly 0 BPS leveling up the last 3 survivors, sadly. :'(
---
I’ve honestly really been enjoying Legion.
---
The better question would be how did you get on the hook instead of all these awful players?
---
Would be a cool mod if the game allowed Steam workshop
---
I hate playing with claudettes as killer and survivors all they do is urban and hide it's so annoying...
---
ya it was very petty
---
I stopped using BPS because whenever I do I end up getting cucked from it. Killers either tryhard and end the game in 2 minutes or I die first from being hook farmed.
---
I have a personal rule that if I'm playing killer, and the survivors try to farm (2x BP or not) , I help them farm; everyone gets points, everyone has fun being silly, everyone's friends, everyone's happy. If a survivor DCs, I'll take it easy on the remaining survivors and offer to farm.
---
As a survivor, I'd rather not risk attempting to ask the killer to farm, just because I'm generally really bad at looping for extended periods of time, and I'd rather not put the strain on my fellow survivors by having them come and save me right at the start of the game. If the other survivors convince the killer, or if the killer wants to farm, though, I won't say no.
---
No need to be such an ass about it.
---
This is the Friendly Rank 20 Killer starter pack honestly.
---
(Picture of Dwight working on a gen) "Play DBD like this."
---
(Picture of Dwight hiding in a locker) "NEVER like this. Only villains do that."
---
I really love it, it's one of my personal favorite perks but sadly it's a hex perk, which means it usually breaks
---
Your version of monstrous shrine sounds way too powerful, almost like a instant NOED that'll encourage camping. I'd like it if MS instead was a perk that caused the survivor to be lured in for the rescue.
---
Like what if MS instead closed off 2/3/4 of the furthest gens, even if they're completed for balancing issues. Or maybe if MS caused a dying light effect to be casted on all survivors until the rescue is accomplished.
---
I actually got it with Bill, but only because I was playing him while he was new, and I was on Lery's against a Nurse that wasn't pro-tier.
---
Meh...not really.
---
... But why?
---
I mean they're RGB which is a very common color palette.
---
me too
---
If this isn't me, I don't know what is.
---
When the killer finally downs me but I got adrenaline.
---
these perks were made for personal use so jakes perks are actually like that purposely. I'm a jake main and the colours reflect the flannel i wear irl :-)
---
Trapper will always be my best boi. Second place has to go to Myers though.
---
What happened? You disarmed the trap but it reset itself? Is that an add-on?
---
Post-rework Deja Vu deserves better than this. It's actually good for preventing a 3-gen game which is by far the worst combination of long and boring possible, outside of "I burned a Jigsaw Piece so guess what perks I'm using" Doctor.
---
I feel like 5 would be a bit too much. I think it should not be timer based (10 seconds), but rather completion based. What I mean by that is if you're healing and a killer uses nurses calling to find you but you have distortion, you will lose a token but your aura won't be shown until you fully heal up. 4 tokens would be a nice little buff though
---
You telling me I just had to xpost this for karma?
---
didn't realise people do that omg lol. i just wanted some nice perks for myself
---
I have no idea why you got hit with a downvote on this comment. Let me even that out for you.
---
Got dced during a bps game. My teammates probably thought I'm some salty dickhead survivor, when I'm reality I got fucked over by the game :(
---
Ps4 btw, console dbd is an actual joke
---
someone had to make a post, this shit is close to unplayable.

They're the best ones. They're feeding the killer through stupidity. I love when people do this.
---
&gt;I was boutta play DBD then I was reminded I will get endless hatemail if I don't play like survivors want me to ~~during extra BP event~~
---
Fixed.
---
Depiping when killer DCs.............still...
---
Happened to me literally 15 minutes ago. Lmao
---
Deleting and redownloading oddly solves a lot problems for this game. But since you're dealing with constant crashes and this is Dead by Daylight, I have no idea if that'll fix it.
---
TY
---
The killers were taken against their will just like the survivors were. Michael is the exception since he only knows killing, infact it's inferred in game with his tombstone/tombstone piece that he ignores the entity's bidding sometimes of sacrifices and just kills the survivors outright because his drive to do it is just that powerful.
---
I’ve had a killer run survivor pudding but pre-match he tried to get my friend to run BPS and pass on the message. He tried to camp but failed and all survivors got out really fast. This was yesterday and why I don’t run BPS. 
---
Also have you thought that maybe people don’t have any? I only have them on one or two killers
---
The lore from what I read in killers bios doesnt say if they were willing or not for all of them. I guess this is spoiler territory? But not really. The clown just road off on night in his caravan and disappeared. Spirit made a deal for revenge. Wraith was unwillingly taken. Trapper just disappeared from his estate after a massive death toll. Plauge was good but ignorant and made a prayer to her God but the entity answered. Freddy was luring quintin to him when the entity took them both and freddy didnt really know where he went but he knew people were there so he was okay with hunting in the realm. As for micheal and lori I think they were taken right after the events of the first movie. Leatherface was taken after his original movie after he had his freak out when the girl and trucker escaped. He was incredibly scared of the police coming and he was taken. The real hard hitting questions are who is vigo and how did he make so many contraptions to use in the fog. He made the escape hatch and numerous survivor addons and tributes. He had trapper chained up in his lab to experiment on but we dont know much else.
---
You should have moved along a long time ago. You won't accept that they're a theme and just wanna cry about it. Why don't YOU move along already?
---
Yeah, I got mine disabled because of survivors or killers that get pissed when I do something they don’t like AKA do the objectives
---
no one is triggered or defensive here besides you, just one glance at your post history proved to me that's how you are and can't take someone disagreeing with you
---
Iridescent stone, not diamond bar.
---
4 man SWF squads summed up...
---
Some killers like Clown came willingly while others needed convincing
---
But the true baby build is combining Premonition &amp; Spinechill with Urban Immersion &amp; Alert
---
Stop hard camping. He camped her to death when there were still 5 gens left.
---
Feel like there's some middle ground there lol.
---
I know, but it still saved my ass alot from tunneling killers or allowed me to block 3 hits
---
I would personally love these. They're the only complete set I'd want in my game tbch
---
This made my heart melt, it's so adorable.
---
Why not both?
---
Link pls
---
Sounds ehh to me
---
Yah don’t get this one unless they really asked in which who cares, no different than everyone takes a healthy dump once a day except for BhVR
---
Turning one person's game into total shit by camping this hard.... that needs to go. It still hinders the rest of the team, especially in solo play when you can't communicate.
---
I think you‘re very boring at parties
---
It's when bodies get rigid after death. It's where the phrase "death grip" comes from.
---
I don't know what you are talking about
---
pc isn't as bad because it all happens in post game and you can just exit out.
---
on xbox on ps4 they have to message you specifically
---
That was incredibly well articulated and spot on.
---
GET YOURSELF A WINDOW WIN WITH LEVOLOR AT LOWES
---
Idk much about the Evil Dead series but from what I searched up, a necronomicon is a fictional book of magic that shows up in different works such as H.P Lovecraft's stuff and Evil Dead series. Its appearance in the ED series specifically looks like a leather book with a horrified face
---
I want Frankensteins Monster as a Killer ffs. And Frankenstein himself as the survivor!
---
Some killers just suck
---
Who gently opened the door?
---
So someone already explained it but if you don't want to go through all of that wait until the legions change because once he is changed you only have to hit a person with ff 1 time then down them with your basic attack
---
I go for kills and I go for escapes, more bloodpoints
---
Michael doesn't talk though ... So you know, he'd  have to straight up take off the shirt to lure thots.
---
Just saying ...
---
I mean... She was afk. Thats on her.
---
I think they want an image of Jane’s backside as their flair. A justified request no doubt.
---
That's Slippery Meat. Small Game is the Survivor jumping over a trap.
---
If Bloodwarden does proc I just strafe away from the gates so my aura isn't revealed for a minute and then leave or try to help the other Survivors.
---
Yo!
---
I’m not sure on exact times, but it would shorten the exhaustion timer by that percentage. I’m pretty sure we’re on the same page there. We picked 10/20/30 because there was another perk (can’t think of which one) that used those numbers and it seemed like a good start.
---
Group effort essentially gets turned on when you’re within the killers terror radius. Much like some other perks like overwhelming presence. Once you choose to sprint, the perk is now activated and the exhaustion timer starts. 
---
Yep that’s the point of concussion. It’s a killer perk so it’s gonna help the killer out the most. You might get lucky and have that burst point you in the right direction that 1% of the time, but that’s not the real point of the perk!
---
What are some ideas on locker room? I know it’s kind of the norm to avoid lockers and joke about em, but I actually still see a good amount of survivors using lockers. For now I think it’s decent until something better is come up with
---
P3 Claudette is frustrating to all killers.  Blendette (with the earth tone cosmetics) is even worse.  Imagine: a good survivor that can run you around for a gen or two and then FUCKING.  VANISH.  In mid-chase, no less.  That's what dealing with a Claudette in camo cosmetics is like.
---
yeah it's this, I frequently am able to trick a killer into hitting the locker 2 or 3 times, it's more time off the clock for my teammates to do gens *(or crouch around doing nothing more likely)*
---
plus I think you get bonus BOLD points for doing it?
---
Not controversial, it's pretty good on any high mobility killer. There are just WAY better perks  to run over it
---
Oh yeah it would be a crazy looking coach. Probably larger than life sized. Much like the doctor. Just somebody continuing to do their job in a messed up way, after they themselves go through an experience that messes them up. Don’t have lore on characters yet but it doesn’t seem to hard to figure out!
---
Agreed.
---
But this is what you get when fans try to create cannon out of a dozen or more slasher films that really dont have a lot of rhyme or reason to begin with.  They're just a fun time, nothing more.
---
That's the catch though.  If said female has Iron Will (which is a necessary part in stealth builds)?  There are no pain noises.  Stridor helps...but sound is fucked atm.  Especially for Spirit.
---
Well there’s already a perk for detecting survivors in lockers with noise (stridor) so I was thinking something kinda big like 
---
Locker Room: the auras of uninjured survivors can now be seen even while in lockers. The cooldown of missed attacks made while in a chase with a a survivor who enters a locker is reduced by 40/50/60 percent
---
Who is teaching who in the pic of Hannibal and Bubba?  Cause I think the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre came way before the first Silence of the Lambs film.
---
Agreed, it’s only really worth a fourth flex slot if you feel you want your basement hooks to be more impactful. Definitely think it’s underrated
---
So strange that for many teachable perks, they’re bad on that killer but good on others. See:  M&amp;A with Doctor, TI with Huntress, etc
---
I mean he is pure evil incarnate, at least that's what the movie was going for. The idea that he has no empathy nor that he even enjoys killing persay and literally just does it just to kill is what makes him such a good and simple killer I guess.
---
If Jason ever got out of his legal hell, I'm sure the lore would be the entity enticing him somehow with the voice or image of Pamela and making him do it's bidding that way. We can only dream for him though.
---
That's one thing. But people DC for everything.
---
Just yesterday I was playing as Wraith and I pulled Meg off a chest and then she DCd. Then 2 of her teammates DCd.
---
Good point, we didn’t think of the slight overlap strider has. I like your ideas a lot though!
---
Happened with me and my friends PS4. 😒
---
Where are all the good spirit mains?! I'm not even a killer main but when I use spirit in red ranks I destroy! And shes so fun in chase. She has great map control and a huge counter to pallet looping. Yet I rarely see her and when I do shes usually not too great and just camps everyone....I personally find her to be Billy tier but everyone still plays freaking Billy to death.
---
Maybe people think rank is meaningless because you lose pips for doing well?
---
Where’s the sixth one just saying “using overcharge”
---
This is the most toxic style of play. Yeah, the killer gets no BP's for it if nobody comes, but it's not punished hard enough, that's for sure. That's why people keep doing it. If they want to troll, they don't care about BP's. They just *enjoy* ruining other people's games.
---
I just hope they do a bloodhunt shortly after the dedicated servers go live. More blood hunts in general, please. Like, would it be so bad to have one every month for one weekend? 2 days out of the month. That’d be cool. So people wouldn’t lose their shit when they can’t farm/don’t want to farm- you’ll have your chance to farm next month, or you can wait the weekend out to get back to the normal swing of things, if it bothers anybody that much. 
---
I personally feel a lot of pressure when I play killer during these times and don’t want to farm- I know some survivors just wanna get those tasty bloodpoints, and are prone to dc if a killer isn’t compliant. I don’t want a 3 man/ 2 man squad because I wanted to play normal. But it is what it is, and I play when I know I can handle waiting for a good, normal killing-spree match.
---
I apparently was called a dick for looping a Hillbilly for a long time even though I wasn't teabagging/BMing at all. Then the next game I jump into it's the same killer but Huntress with Iri head and ebony mori. I call that a win in my book lmao.
---
Too true :,(
---
I love this game, and the only toxicity I come across is on this sub haha
---
Well, that got dark.
---
People 1. Don’t want to farm 2. Get salty when I kill then early
---
I don’t spend any money on games. But some people pay a ton of money for brand items irl so what do I know LOL I have one outfit and it’s for Claudette, from shards.
---
How is that even remotely fun? And if you're just AFKing your being detrimental to your team.
---
"Play style"  
---
Killermains justify this in two ways. One by pointing out the obvious, that "IF they're against SWF, the killer is screwed out of 3 kills pretty much".  
---
Except, this totally screws over solo players who don't have any way to communicate. We were immediately down a person after this because I would have been downed had I gone for the save. This guy got an undeserved 4k because he camped the first person he could after Ruin, so it was like playing with an almost immediate DC into a game.  
---
The other argument is "I paid for this game, I play it how I want."  Then they get pissed when survivors don't want to play the game *their way*.
---
Nah, and the sentiment that the default skins make you a noon is suuuuuper obnoxious. I'm not going to pay for a bright ass SUPER VISIBLE skin on any character bc that's stupid to do
---
Yeah but I’d rather go for kills or escape. I think it’s just a really competitive thing for no reason
---
I would have had a heart attack
---
Survivors messaged me in the lobby today, "Farm? We're all bringing streamers." I told them I don't camp or tunnel, and I would slug them on death hook. They left the lobby.
---
I'd think Freddy would need to be convinced. You can't tell me that (if he was taken unwillingly) he wouldn't be at the forefront, fighting tooth and claw, to overthrow the Entity.
---
Lots of people have believed this in other games.  Then an update or something happens and you get nailed.
---
They won't fix this kind of ban either.  Never mind buying DbD again, I dont want the red mark of the beast on my profile over icons.
---
I ran into a Gate Guardian Myers once. He stood in front of one exit gate and refused to let us open it.
---
Drinking *because of dbd*

Why would someone use an ebony mori with iridescent head?
---
&gt;as I rather not play then play vs all these genrushing SWF groups
---
Then don't play?
---
Deranking is toxic as fuck and so are you
---
Weird observation, the coaches power seems like it’s a reverse MoM.
---
Also, the thing about Myers is his play style changing Add-ons (scratched mirror, tuft of hair, tombstones etc) and his naturally reduced terror radius, so what type of things would the coach have for add-ons, terror radius, and how could his  power be changed to make it more than just a straight up one shot every once in a while?
---
lmao, his nerf only made him useless if you played him in the absolute worst way.
---
Negative 18 quintillion points. You're gonna have to farm for years to even get back into the positive numbers.
---
ok?
---
or in my case; killer finds me in the first 10 seconds of the match, get tunneled while my teammates run away and crouch behind a tree because they hear the heartbeat, and die coming out with 3k bloodpoints. or play killer and have borrowed time adrenaline flashlight sweaty p3 clauds pop 4 gens in under 2 mins and leave the game with 2 hooks and a depip, 16k bloodpoints.

Go watch a PC player with nurse play and then go watch someone on PS4 and get back to me and you will see why nurse sucks on console.

If you really are not good enough to play these genrushing survivors then you will lose and naturally derank.

But hey, if you like being a cunt, go ahead and derank. I'm sure stomping lower rank players in a video game fills your pea-sized-dopamine-deprived excuse of a brain with a lot of joy. "tHe sYsTeM iS bRokEN cUz mE nOt fReE wIn evErYtIme hurr durr"

it fulfills my every dream hence why im doing it.

you understand it one day little buddy.

Thanks mate.

I’ve been doing the same all night &lt;3
---
Was gonna play Billy today, but someone’s name was mori me daddy myers so I switched to Myers and slapped that Ebony mori all over her. She was ecstatic in post game chat
---
The moment they actually implement a camo skin for claudette im quitting the game 🤣
---
That bitch.
---
i personally prefer to work through ruin as survivor becuz i know it makes me better
---
It only works best with Freddy when playing the end game. If you run NOED and Blood Warden.
---
It literally does nothing else but let you camp. That's the whole point of the perk, and because of it, yes, camping is a legit strategy, whether you like it or not, whether you're salty you fell for it.
---
Freddy can use it so he has a free Red Paint Brush + Monitor &amp; Abuse, but other than that, no.
---
Lmao wanted to post this without coming off as “haha I have a life unlike you nerds !”
---
I would be down for punishing chronic DC'ers, it would have to be if they keep DCing otherwise being punished for an out of the blue DC would suck but if you keep disconnecting then you should be penalized.
---
At max rank it isn't terrible for mind games, but only against bad survivors.
---
That's good that you help out your team. But in order to survive completely generators is a must hence why it's the main objective.
---
Spend it all at once quickly.
---
No. I do wish the timer was a little shorter, though. 
---
I usually end up finding the unhooked guy first or go after them to tank the other person's Benevolence and/or making sure they can't get Deliverance, as is a legitimate tactic. I usually do this before chasing someone else, but it's sometimes easier to chase and double back, pick them up, and--
---
BAM. 
---
Shanked in the back, even though I didn't technically tunnel off hook. 
---
But it's nowhere near as bad as old DS. I started back when the Halloween DLC came out and my wee lad Trapper was my first and only ever Machinegun. He took 5 second stuns the first time he picked anyone up, though...
---
End game blood warden and noed monster.
---
"I need to secure the kill!"
---
The hell? This post is just a joke. A interesting one too. No need to be edgy.
---
Pretty much
---
He clearly said he was too high of a rank to be good. I think the toxic person is you.
---
Me when running Spine Chill and turn my camera to see Michael watching me. RUNNNNN
---
Killer Jane? lmao
---
Harajuku Nea and her *stupid* graffiti.
---
I actually played Friday The 13th first before DbD because Friday was released 2 months earlier than DbD on PS4. Which the skill checks were both bumpers. So when I switch to play DbD this was easyyy for me.
---
More like killer disconnect central on PS4, since the blood hunt started yesterday about 90% of the games either the killer camps or disconnects. What’s shocking is how the survivors have almost stopped disconnecting. Guess they want them points lol. haven’t been able to play any decent games till after 11pm when all the trash little bastard children are in bed...
---
Ain't. That. The. Truth.
---
I swear, I had a game where 3 people including me were using bps, and that was the only time in the day that the game crashed at the loading screen. Goddamit.
---
Play one handed in a chase
---
Bet.
---
Where’s we’ll make it?
---
Jane the Killer is an actual thing. Maybe she's looking for Jeff the Killer so she can kick his ass.
---
Well yea you can’t play without an exhaustion perk because then you have nothing to help with a chase. I don’t run self-care because I just hope that my teammates will heal me but I do run Adrenaline because it’s like a reward for doing the objectives. Killers have NOED and they’re getting rewarded for not being able to get their objectives....
---
You lumped all of the exhaustion perks together but that’s not really fair because there’s like 4 of them that are being included for 1 category, that’s like saying Killers always have a perk that slows down the gens and then including: Thanatophobia, Ruin, Billy’s Addons to the chainsaw, Overcharge, Doctor’s passive, etc. Some things are a necessity.
---
As per the per the “feels like... necessary perks to run” that’s the exact same as the killer perks you mentioned so it’s the same boat.
---
Yeah I’m playing on PS4, internet is totally fine. Game crashed 3 times in the past hour and a half
---
I've always kind of wished they used the higher pitch chainsaw noise from [LF's release trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbUzCsR1BHo&amp;t=0m22s) for Bubba.
---
Start to disarm trap. Hear heartbeat. Freak out, stop disarm, run forward into trap. W.T.F.
---
I'm terrified of the fact that I agree with you.
---
This is KyF, so it's nonbannable! If u do it in public games, u can get into trouble. 
---
Glad u liked it! :)
---
No thanks.
---
I reeeeeally don't want Ochido wannabes in my games. I don't want the stress...
---
Why red twine? Doesn’t rainbow map already show the killers belongings?
---
Anyone who plays DBD wouldn't say that!
---
1 stack of BBQ + WGLF for every survivor DC
---
Let's say you're near a gen, hidden behind a wall with insidious activated. Somebody comes to do a gen, and (ideally) you grab him, no chase. Or you're a shitty Nurse who can't do blinks so after the gens are done you blink to get behind the exit gates, activate insidious+NOED+Bloodwarden, bam. Just hope they don't hear your asthmatic breathing and there's a hook next to the exit gates. But these are veeeeery specific (and kinda dumb) situations and I don't think this perk is any good as it's very time-consuming if you don't camp and it's a no-brainer if you do (esp if you're basement Bubba). That is what my half-asleep 5am brain came up with anyways.
---
Holy fuck, I would be practically useless with both bumpers lol
---
What did you do about it? You can depip the Killer so easily with that. Don't just sit there and bitch. If you want to spite a killer that does this, de-rank them.
---
Never knew Buzz Lightyear was bipolar...
---
Also, "white"? Are they referring to race?
---
Yeah, I got it when it was free, too. Then I decided to buy it on PC instead because the controller was too big for my tiny hands lol. Goddamn that game is addicting. They did a pReTty GoOd jOb So FaR
---
The mist is on the bottom floor I believe
---
I rarely get DS off because I can stay hidden when DS is on, and even then I can loop the killer during that time it's active.. If I do get it off it's because the killer tunnels me off the hook soon
---
they aren't just bootyclaps, they're thunderclaps
---
I even wrote it in my journal. Veronica said a very funny joke today
---
That's what I thought as well but I checked everywhere and no most
---
Rank 17 hags be place in traps around the hooked guy like:
---
he actually hit space too early
---
you should try and hit space later in this situation, but not too late. you could’ve fast vaulted if you pressed it right before you reached the window. either way though this shouldn’t have hit.
---
Duuh, Nea is obviously a lesbian.
---
I have disconnected intentionally three times in two years. Twice due to blatant lagswitching and once because I had a call that I'd forgotten about going into the match. Which is why it pisses me off all the more to see Survivors especially disconnect when *I maintain a policy* of staking it out no matter the cost. Any way you slice it, DCs are unsportsmanlike, kill *everyone's* fun, and are worthy of punishment. On *both* sides. I get what you're trying to say with this post, but don't. Ever. Promote this.

They swear up and down that it isn't related to BPS but I crash every time I burn them and as killer I crash when someone brings them. Unless a BPS was burned it is super rare for me to get kicked
---
No rules, Only death
---
Could it have been the one that clears the mist? And yeah, the meat plant has next to no mist to begin with
---
I'd suggest WGLF -&gt; sprint burst -&gt; adrenaline
---
Firstly, David King to 30 for WGLF, which is the only survivor perk that boosts your BP gain. You should always be using this perk if you need bloodpoints (and you need alot).
---
Secondly, I'd suggest getting Meg to 40 for adrenaline + sprint burst. Adrenaline is a top tier perk that you'll probably always run, and sprint burst is the most basic exhaustion perk. (you almost always will run one exhaustion perk) We pick Meg second because she teaches 2 useful perks whereas the majority of survivors only have 1 useful teachable.
---
After you get WGLF, adrenaline and sprint burst you'll probably already have a good feel of the game and you can decide which perks you want next.
---
Good choices are bill (borrowed time), Dwight (bond), claudette (self care), jake (iron will), or you can explore other exhaustion perks (nea for balanced, David for dead hard, feng for lithe).
---
This is happening to me and is very annoying, funniest/worst has been mid hatch escape.
---
Yeah you new or something thats a thing. Killers hate teabagging if you do it they typically facecamp.
---
So damn true (;
---
Hard as it is to believe I main Freddy. He was the first DLC I bought for this game and I love his playstyle, he doesn't seem to be as weak as people say since no one can remember how to counter him anymore.
---
Can you please dm me these or something, they're sick.
---
As a David main and profesional rank 20, I don't care since I learned a strategy for this very situation.
---
Turn around to face him, stay in place and watch him. Both you and the killer will be stunned by the beauty of each others six pack until 5 gens are completed. Also, Careless Whisper will start playing instead of chase music.
---
And then you just die.
---
I'm not new. I said it made my day because he got mad i tbagged. I barely get facecamped for tbagging and when I do it makes me laugh. Usually killers just play normally and could care less.
---
Yes!
---
Pathetic loser I hate gamers like this
---
Lots of different opinions here, interesting. And, yes, I fell for it insidious, but enough with the ultimatums. Just because someone falls for someone doesn't automatically make them bad. You dont HAVE to be so narrow-minded and assuming to make a point on the internet just because you're anonymous.
---
My thing is, if I want to farm, and someone else doesn't, then let me do my thing and you do yours. Playing the game normally is fine and you're allowed to do that and I wouldn't interrupt that. But also, I am entitled to also play the way I want and if I want to farm, you shouldn't try to stop me either. Fair is fair.
---

Okay. Just lookin' out for ya &lt;3
---
nah he told ya u just poor bro
---
Teach me
---
Generally speaking, I always do this whenever I know where the hatch is
---
However, as my level of skill as a killer is roughly that of a baked potato sitting atop a PS4 controller, nine times out of ten I actually haven't found the hatch
---
I kid you not, I have spent way more time trying to find hatches *for* survivors than any killer should be proud of
---
I dont know when that doesnt happen. I just dont teabag. You do you though OP.
---
Too bad.   
---
Any way you slice it, CAMPING us unsportsmanlike, kill *everyone's* fun, and should be worthy of punishment.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm not going to play a game 'their way' just because I'm forced to at present. I'm going to keep suggesting we punish this until a change is made. Killers wanna bitch about people leaving their games, maybe they need to change their behavior.
---
they do stack.
---
So untrue. If one person wants to play normally and someone else wants to farm, both are fully entitled to play the way they want.
---
no you can’t :/
---
Try reading the main post again so you can see why.
---
Accept farming is a form of holding the game hostage which is against the rules.
---
He gave absolute ZERO shits about pips. He just wanted to ruin people's games. He made that ABSOLUTELY clear in the post game chat.
---
Tenebris Tempestas (Latin for dark storm)
---
When getting mystery box, it’ll get stuck on x continue. But you can’t continue and can’t see what the reward is. And so won’t be able to continue upgrading character.
---
If you'd read the main post you'd see that camping isn't the only way it activates.
---
*horror remix of Ginuwine'a Pony plays*
---
Nope, but people get weird about them. I got angry messages from a survivor who claimed I was "trying to be toxic" solely because I played default doc. he wasn't mad about anything I'd done in the game, merely my choice of cosmetics
---
I like how you're only mocking the extreme variety of people who don't want to farm and then everyone who doesn't want to farm is instabutthurt.
---
Yeah, farming doesn't bother me. The usual game can be stressful dealing with camping killers and shit teammates. Farming is just a nice 10-15 min break from the monotony and has the bonus of getting those nice BPs. Most of the time I let the killer kill me afterwards if they're a good sport.
---
The devs have said that Vigo didn't make the hatch, and where does it say he had trapper chained up?
---
I’m kinda new but how do I get a bps?
---
This was amazing. Would give gold, but I only have this &gt;🏅
---
Free psn user here too.. the rest of my games remain neglected now. Rip
---
I’m thinking about editing my perk icons but not sure how or where to start

Maybe, but that's a last resort on console because it takes a long time. I'm just trying to find out if anyone has any suggestions before i try that

DBD takes up a lot of my time too. Its fun, addicting, and a shit ton of grinding. :-)
---
Looks like that's rotten fields? That map has not a lot of loops and with the recent increase of minimum pallets I think that the game spawned those in regardless of the minimum distance in order to meet the minimum pallets. So basically if there aren't enough pallets on the map the map generation says "fuck it" and yeets them wherever. I think atleast.
---
Anymore room down here for us bottom dwellers. Bing bong is my boi!
---
No season pass. You can buy individual characters with Auric Cells.
---
As for advice, do you like killer or survivor more? What are you having trouble with?
---
But can it banana?
---
I feel like its missing a few notes.
---
Of course! Here's an upvote Bing bong boi!
---
“Genrushing” AKA “playing the game as intended.”
---
Sounds like you’re playing against survivors who are better than you and you’d rather stomp noobies. Git gud.
---
Try to have fun. Oof.
---
That was great! This is the content I'm here for lol.
---
Thank you kindly fellow peasant!
---
Wishful thinking i know. Im usually stressing it the whole time as it loads into the trial.
---
The Hag was the first character I ever had an interest in, even before I started playing, the first killer I ever played, the first killer I to rank 40 and continues to be in my top three, and is probably my most consistent. Not only is the Hag *really* fucking good, she's also *really* fucking fun to play.
---
On PS4, killer queue times are shorter, so killer.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. If you're escaping, you're good. If you're juking and never going down, you're good. Both two good ways to measure survivors skills for skill based matchmaking. Nothing you said made any sense. Skill based matchmaking isn't something new to multiplayer games!
---
Probably, still worth it
---
I believe it's because the rightholders for the series came to the devs and asked to put him in the game, instead of the other way around like usual.

At this rate this guy continues McCote will have him killed by next week. 😵
---
Due to PTB ending earlier this week, I personally think the mid-chapter patch is coming on Tuesday (5/7)
---
I've noticed this has started to be quite a common bug (among myself and friends). The literal only thing that's fixed it was retrying over and over. Sometimes restarting the PC as a whole helped, but you literally just have to keep retrying to get it to launch.
---
Happy cake day fellow Anchorman quoter!
---
Its funny because people only associate camping with end game. But i've seen a billy use insidious pretty well and we had 4 gens left. I dont prefer to use it but i has certain aspect that are useful.
---
I play on PS4 as well And there's a fair amount of this, especially during double BP or special events. They always run bond too. It's incredibly annoying.
---
It's very rare to use Insidious anything else other than camping, but...

Whats up with Nelson's 2 sets of eyelids in the third frame

I noticed the same on Coal Tower..

Unfortunately, I was playing killer.
---
No, the cells are purchase only. IIRC 1080 is 10$, but it could be 1200 too I don't remember exactly. You CAN buy characters that are non-licenced with Iridescent Shards, which you get for levelling up. So any original characters made by the developers can be earned for free, things like Michael Myers, Leatherface, Amanda from Saw, and the survivors in their dlcs MUST be purchased with money.
---
no it doesnt lol. they are completly separate
---
Holy shit, it's op. Please nerf.
---
Dude Lery’s is awesome for survivors
---
He literally stares in on a family like a stalker and murders the son when he’s frightened.  I know the whole “the real monster is Viktor!  So deep” thought is popular but Adam really isn’t some poor victim.  He’s an angry adolescent that murders when he doesn’t get his way.
---
Oof
---
If you wanna give Freddy or Trapper a 5th perk slot, I don't really see the problem, but giving Killers as a whole a 5th perk slot will throw balance in the garbage. If Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Huntress, Hag and maybe Plague, Clown and Myers got a 5th perk slot, they'd go from ridiculously strong/reasonably balanced to ridiculously overpowered.
---
What we should be look at is the rank before has around a 60% survival rate. A lot of people won't admit that the game is closer to the Devs' idea of balance than we all think. Obviously there are more variables than just survival rate to determine balance, because no one should think perks like Mettle of Man or Spirit's Fury are balanced, same with add-ons like Iri Heads, even if the survival rate *was* 80%.
---
Ironically, for anyone willing to look deeper into theses stats, all they do is prove that Killer isn't hurting as much as everyone thought. I agree that lower Killers need a buff, but more so in their kit and not an overall Killer buff. We've seen how the top tier Killers perform, and it's foolish to say they need *anything* to help them win further.
---
Everything you're saying right now is irrelevant. BT needs to be balanced. Right now it has unlimited usage, it should be limited in some way.
---
Thanks!
---
Thank you! You have great taste my friend
---
More like coming home at 2am drunk and shit and loading up a match and waiting 20 mins for a game until you pass out
---
Indeed you can. 
---
It usually takes a decent light source being aimed at him from eye-level to be able to see them though.
---
Yeah, been playing killer for a couple of hours, everything seemed fine, but when I switched to survivor it started disconnecting me. The last two were as soon as the killer hit me, very odd.
---
&gt;Refuses to nerf/Rework NOED due to killer mains liking it and being borderline combative with Surviviors who disagree. 
---
 &gt;Reworks/guts decisive strike so hard they had to buff it to not be quite as garbage bc killer mains complained. 
---
&gt;Nerfs flashlights bc killers complained there was too little counterplay but kept Insta saw Billy and Bubba despite the same issues being present. 
---
&gt;Adds EGC bc killers didn't like endgame taking forever. Yet the killer can physically bodyblock Surviviors from doing anything at all, taking the game hostage ("JuSt Do ThE gEnErAtOrS"). 
---
&gt;Added disjoints on hitboxes, allowing killers to strike Surviviors when they visibly miss. 
---
&gt;Disjointed Survivior hurtboxes against chainsaws so the hitbox for hitting a Survivior is bigger than the hitbox for colliding with terrain in the case of Bubba. 
---
&gt;Adds Bloodlust. 
---
But no, they clearly don't ever give anything to killers. They always take the side of Surviviors
---
BBQ vs a shitty teachable that’s the easiest choice in the world
---
Oh wait. You're that guy who dc'd to run 1 a few months back
---
The unfortunate thing is after leaving PC to go to console then returning, I can’t play keyboard and mouse survivor anymore. I’m glued to controller :/
---
This makes me feel old
---
It also effects teammates items too right? It isnt that bad but I dont really like bringing items.
---
&gt;looping is rampant
---
Well what do you expect? For them to throw down the pallet immediately? Like come on. If you’re really that butthurt over loops play nurse or spirit ffs.
---
This meme sucks because Myers doesn’t talk.
---

---
Hagonetta
---
What was the original dialogue?
---
These perks are amazing! But I would love to make my own perks but I have literally 0 clue as to how on earth to start :(
---
Then why did he drown?
---
quiet possibly the best killer was picked for this. anyone other than Myers would not have the same affect. God tier content.
---
it can be useful on spirit (especially with prayer beads) you can use it to get super close before phasing

You should be able to prevent a 3 gen without the use of a perk.
---
😂😂😂
---
GGEZ
---
Yea, but also doing it fast doesn’t make it last long
---
That killers are wrong for killing? You want a competitive PvP game where the other side isn’t allowed to play their objective?
---
Give everyone but Claudette’s and Ash the hatch
---
I'm with you
---
I got into a lobby as survivor last night and the killer immediately messaged me "Farm :)" and I insta-dodged because I wanna play normally, and if I don't I'm just gonna get tunnelled
---
A killers job is to Kill not make buddies with survivors.
---
If the killer has a strategy that doesn't hack the game in any way or exploit glitches it's fair game and the same goes for survivors.
---
The most likely time a killer will camp is when he gates are open and the hook is nearby.
---
What other option does the killer have they can't down everyone and the survivor will be unhooked If they leave
---
Cause Bloodhunts are meant for farming, not mori'ing.
---
Well, first of all "Gen Rushing" isn't a thing. Survivors have one objective that they need to complete in order to escape, and that is Generators. If they get punished by NoED, Devour Hope, or another Totem that's their own fault if they don't do those totems.
---
Going off of what little info you've given, you didn't really have a reason to camp, so yeah I'd say that's pretty toxic.
---
Platform: PS4
---
Bug Type: Menu

Description: Every time Wraith loads in either in the killer select screen, or the campfire lobby while having the tarnished sickle knife cosmetic equipped, the game freezes for approximately 30 seconds or more. It occurs with no other cosmetic, and has no known effects in game. The cosmetic was purchased using iridescent shards.

praise be to the glowing table
---
I think it'd be 45 seconds not 50 hypothetically. They're making the exit gate take 5 less seconds to open as a base survivor thing. 
---
I agree the nerf feels heavy handed. I understand why (Endgame Collapse) but it's pointless considering the timer only starts once the gate is already open, unless it's "All other survivors are dead, killer closes hatch" situation, and I don't see even *that* being OP, the killer arguably earned it. (Made sure obsession is dead, got maximum stacks, and found hatch, + dedicated a perk slot for longer gate opening) + the survivor might already be at the gate when the killer finds the hatch.
---
I didn't 4k 3/4 of my games survs op :(
---
I used to run it on Myers, mostly for the sake of them not detecting me as my terror radius increased if I could stalk them in one spot that long. Then Monitor &amp; Abuse came along and I benched it.
---
It's perfectly fine to throw your teammates under the bus when you know not everyone is able to escape. Teammates are only valuable when they can help you get to your objective which is to escape otherwise it's every man for himself. If the killer targeted you to ruin your experience then that's between you and the killer. It's annoying, I know
---
Thank you for translating, I am also stupid
---
Ive lost my only bps and 2 cakes because of crashes
---
Im also on own(radiofox56). Queue times are bullshit. I solo queue and still have to wait a while to get into a lobby. So i just switch over to killer if my patience runs out.
---
Streetwise memes sounds like fun, its actually the only teachable I never unlocked for survivors. I dont know if I’d use it to cheese gen times with toolboxes and prove thyself, the thing I see myself using it for is on a map that tracks killer belongings to clear out all 5 totems by myself. 
---
People want to run meta builds because if you dont and you go against competent survivors/killer then you’re probably going to lose. The game would be a lot more fun if they just buffed a shit ton of perks on both sides. That would change the game way more than releasing a new killer and survivor would.
---
&gt;Go ahead do what you want, you paid for this game enjoy it how you want to! 
---
I mean the person who really runs the game is the killer, so if the killer is Farming its kinda not possible to play the game normally in that instance. 
---
I haven't been playing Dbd lately anyways so this has no relevance to me, but I was definitely part of the crowd that just wanted to play it. You say to enjoy how we want to but when the way we want to specifically involves the other side playing normally as well, there's kinda not a whole lot of input you have on the matter.
---
this was pretty hilarious, really great editing!
---
he’s not leaking anything... everyone knows he plays dbd😂 unless this is SOMEHOW connected to the stalk power leak
---
Survivors get annoyed at campers because A) it ruins that survivor’s game, which is the obvious reason, and B) it robs the other survivors of BP (from altruism, getting chased, etc) and possibly pips too because you are standing at the hook for much of the game. Survivors can be at the mercy of the killer when it comes to those things. If the killer is a shitty ass camper, yeah you might escape if you aren’t the camped guy(s), but the game is essentially a waste of time as no one is scoring much as all you can do is gens and leave. So yeah, people are going to give you shit for camping.
---
It’s almost like this happening is the risk you referred to
---
To me it is if they are gonna exploit a game mechanic then imma camp them, doesnt that seem fair?
---
i got it for free on psn, im on xbox now due to problems and moving and im trying to buy it, i shpuld be able to get it in a few days
---
Thank you, Virus!
---
It appears to have pissed off a lot of people lol. I wouldn’t call that nothing
---
Are you aware that a bad killer dominates bad survivors? Especially because a lot of bad killers camp or tunnel because they don't know better.
---
That's why Myers is fun. You just need one idiot or over confident troll, and you're gtg
---
there was no Patch against 2 man games
---
If what you say is true, I pity that survivor
---
The game is in a really weird spot balance wise, honestly, yeah, there should be more objectives. Maybe increase the importance and rewards of totens, idk. But sitting at a gen aint really that fun.
---
It's almost like legion players shouldn't be rewarded
---
I agree.
---
Just look for the outline or turn up the brightness. Also most of the spots they can try to hide are obvious. Idk how many times I’ve lost a Claud and then just checked the dark spot on the tree clump I walked past and they’re sitting there like a dumbass.
---
Invisible Claud only really works on the swamp, and that map is just aids in general
---
*hatchet appears out of thin air*
---
And that's why survivors need a totem counter. Good day.
---
&gt;But you can also use Dead Hard in a chase that you started healthy, potentially increasing the chases even further. 
---
...what?
---
The point I was making was that it makes no sense that you feel like you cant do *anything* while injured, you cant be chased you cant hide you cant do unsafe generators UNLESS you have self care and take 32 or 40 seconds everytime you are injured to heal yourself. But you *can* do things while injured and there are perks that will offset the obvious downside of being injured and my point was that these perks are better than running self care.
---
&gt;Medkits&gt;We'll make it&gt;Getting healed by someone else with less potent healing perks&gt;SelfCare&gt;Getting healed by someone else
---
How on earth is getting healed by someone else below self caring yourself? Its literally faster....
---
what an absurd and odd comment.
---
They don't need one. Good day, indeed.
---

---
Not to mention the statistics you reference as 70% are skewed, as you only included the top survival number, which is rank 1 survivors on pc, excluding both all other statistics, and the big phrase in the front “These are very general statistics, so use caution before drawing any conclusions.” Your attempt at falsifying information to argue a side only shows your bias.
---
I would say the opposite, at least against good survivors. The killer has no room for fuck-ups and needs to play like hamster in a wheel to have any chance of not depipping. If survivors are good at looping then killer will have a really tough time.
---
I don't understand why they don't just do what other games do. Which is, basically have a ranked and unranked mode. SWF is unranked and solo survive is ranked. Same goes for killers. If you select ranked, you'll get matched against solo survivors. If you select unranked you can get matched against SWF groups.
---
The killers didn't need a buff to NOED tier 1 and 2 and here we are :)
---
Yep, he's got a nasty shock waiting for the next time I see him. gotta teach him what toxicity really looks like
---
Except those weren't a buff at all, just a change. :)
---
[removed]
---
When did I say anything about DC’ing on the Pig?
---
These stats alone don't really mean that much tbh.
---
&gt;I can tell I don't like you from the way you quote everything.
---
I quote everything because people in this sub have the habit of deleting their posts/replies. By quoting I can always remember what I was replying to.
---
They do when you hear things like "Every round I play against a 4 person SWF" in a lot of threads on here. Now we know that statistically that's probably pretty unlikely. So in that way, I appreciate the stats.
---
Well then why even have the other perk options? If the go-to perks are pretty much the same across all levels than having other choices seems kind of pointless. I don't know-- I think the game would just be more interesting if there were more benefits to picking perks that weren't just from that small batch of them. That's what I'm saying.
---
man dbd is great but a lot of friends have been lost because of it
---
That would kill this game what killer would play unranked then? I sure as hell wouldn't touch unranked with a 10 foot pole if you told me thats where the swf's are.
---
I think your definition of "winning" is different then the actual game's definition of winning.
---
When playing the game as a survivor, your OBJECTIVE is to escape.
---
Escaping is the ONLY win condition.
---
Ranking up is not a win condition.
---
It may be to you, but it isn't the official goal.
---
I assume you play little survivor. As a survivor main it is very annoying dying to random shit. It is annoying finally being able to find a game where there isn't a DC. It is annoying when everything finally starts out fine and goes to shit because of natural causes. What is absolutely aggravating is if the killer decides to face camp me purely because things aren't going well for them. Sacrificing a great amount of blood points just to get some potential ego recovery points? The survivors should absolutely give the killer a shitty experience when the killer is doing something that selfish.
---
You know what I think killers are about? Destroy and demoralize the survivors and keep all of them from escaping. Maybe not "let me get one of yalls real quick becuz yall might escape anyway". If you take the name killer literally you might as well call them murderer. At that point you should ONLY get points when you murder someone and maybe you might feel better when you end up getting 5k points a game and no one gives you shit how you go about it.
---
I mean, I don't care about going against SWF groups. But maybe I'm also in the minority. I play for fun, I don't need to kill all four survivors to have fun or get a good amount of Bloodpoints. One or two kills and I'm good. If I DO get all four, even better. I think the issue is that people take the game too seriously. Like anything less than a 4K is a fail.
---
The moonwalking bit got me good. Nice edits, too
---
Shirtless Mike checking in
---
It doesn't make the game fun when killers camp I agree, but when it's the only way to secure a kill in a match where you constantly get looped or someone is taken off the hook as soon as you leave it or 2-3 gens pop in 1-2 mins it makes the game not so fun for the killer who is just getting bullied through the hole match.
---
The discussion isn't about what YOU use, it's about how good self care is. From my experience, when playing solo, self care is a lot better. And yes, I have tried bond a lot too, but sometimes you end up running around wasting A LOT of time trying to find someone to heal you, especially if half the survivors are dead.
---
Now that's smart. Did not think of that.
---
That doesn't make self care bad, it makes the Adam bad.
---
If it was the official goal than wouldn't that be what they based your rank off of? Adrenaline is one of the most meta perks right now and you would assume that the meta is based around ranking up right? Maybe I'm wrong and everyone else thinks escaping is the win condition and I'm just oblivious but I'm so used to people in other games tryharding for the highest rank.
---
This is a good example how even factual statistics don't change the mind of people who have their mind set. Self Care is the best and most used perk, especially when going solo, period. You can't argue against it, the statistics support it, get over it.
---
Don't heal - yeah the statistics would look much worse for survivors if they followed that advice.
---
Wait for adrenaline - yeah I will remember that next time there are 4 gens left, someone is on the hook and I'm injured.
---
Use a medkit - and ran out of it with 3 gens still left, then waste 2 minutes running around looking for a new medkit or someone to heal me.
---
Try again.
---
i see *two* issues actually...
---
I play the game to play the game I enjoy. If you think I'm just going to play killer and not play the game normally, then you're sadly mistaken. Maybe everyone does get a lot of BP, but it's not my job to make sure everyone has a happy, farmy, boring fucking game for an entire weak.
---
Good things none of them know their objective is to do gens lol
---
Thank you, Google was giving me nothing for the life of me.
---
Cuteee
---
If true, I explained the reason why survivors dislike camping in a separate post from this. Your issue seems to be believing things to be toxic that are not toxic. Looping is literally what survivors have to do to not go down quickly and not waste pallets, it’s not an exploit. It’s playing the game as intended. There may be a couple very rare infinites still out there I’m not sure, but I’m positive you are referring to 99.99% of normal looping. This is not toxic in any way whatsoever.
---
They already DCing at rank 19 now
---
It is very simple:
---
Bad killer vs bad survivors - killer roflstomps hard. Even if he "mindgames shack pallet to play around it". He can waste a lot of time doing silly things because bad survivors are slow with gens.
---
Good killer vs good survivors - survivors stomp, the killer has to outplay them in almost every chase to have a chance, because of the speed the gens get done.
---
I was Fancy Lisa! You were the second Claudette it happened with and the other one was just as confused as you were
---
I gave an example on how to fix the looping problem completely in a different comment on this thread feel free to check it out and see if you agree,also if there are ways it could be better please tell me its minimalistic but I think it could work
---
The name is not an issue, the 2 DC's and the rank is the issue, the rest were all new players and im a rank 12, why am i, at rank 12, being thrown in with people who dont know how to loop or deal with ruin or really do anything?
---
No ones shaming the killer it’s his call if you get to farm or not they’re shitting on the survivors who bitch about farming
---
I wish people in real life had such a low standards. Tho probably girls do bone guys just because they were born tall.
---
Yeah, the DC's and the ranks.
---
Farming is so cheap though. I'd rather earn my rewards.
---
A 360 MOONWALK?  
---
No one should possess this kind of power.
---
mmhm. Where's that DC penalty at?
---
You use the same reasoning for opposing results, you are contradicting yourself.
---
You say clown/plague is bad because they are not popular and then you say hag is good because she is not popular. Can you not see the obvious contradiction?
---
Clown is weak and good players know it.
---
I just said the 1st one as a joke
---
It was a question on the survey, hopefully they do a pretty good job with it.
---
Omg I got something like this before it was me and then a swf joined I was a P3 Kate and they starting ripping into me because I didn't have skins for her unlike them BUT THEY WHERE ALL WEARING THE SAME BASIC STUFF there game does not have enough stuff for me to mix and match with to care maby in 3 more years but all my money goes to cosmetics in another game warframe I sadly have spent 200$+😂😂😂 if dead by daylight gets anything good i might think about it
---
Yup
---
My brother bought it for me for my birthday and I enjoyed it a lot, until I joined the reddit
---
Oh right, my bad.
---
I’ve been getting a load of yoinking spirits
---
Good for you, but most survivors are not godlike like you and need to heal more.
---
I usually play in a 2-3 SWF when I play survivor, and I haven’t seen this yet and I grinded so much since double bloodpoints happened. Maybe it’s the low ranks this is happening? My friends and I are fairly high in rank and we haven’t come across anybody who has done so yet thankfully
---
lol You're the one who has no idea what skill based matchmaking is or how it works. Are you really this foolish? It's 2019 and you've never played a game with skill based matchmaking smh.
---
The high DC’s against legion are part of what drew the devs to finally rework him. So for that I’m thankful. If people had stayed and put up with it, it would have been nothing but game after game of legion after legion making survivors miserable and exploiting him. So I won’t agree. In that case, the DC’s helped. 
---
I’ve got nothing against pig. Never have really.
---
Miss piggy in the upper middle in grass by the boat?
---
Im a ps4 player and ive been playing since it was free and im on the pc players side, this game is depressing but i still playing for some fucked up reason
---
I just want a black rope Pig, pls BHVR.
---
The reson why shits controversial is because there too true for people to handle
---
Fountains? Plague is that you?
---
Sub out the bamboozle for NOED, works wonders.
---
5th of july? Why wait so long?
---
Lol yes
---
I forgot to mention my friend made this when the legion was realesed so he did not cop
---
I win a prize?!
---
Wouldn't that be 5 BPS and not 4?
---
That wouldn't be it. Take the disturbed ward for example. That green window in the main building activates Balanced Landing when vaulted through.
---
Thats why i just kill people in game. We arent playing these games.
---
Well it never happens when I play with my friends either, obviously. But I play solo a lot more since my friends can't play at my rank (there's a reason none of them have ever gotten past rank 10) At rank 1, it's either people hiding in closets or in corners the whole game while I do 2-3 gens before getting camped and dying, or it's Neas and Megs running around with Bond, sandbagging and teaming with the killers. Stuff like this is why I don't play as much. Other than the whole hitbox issue.
---
In jungle gyms there's normally one pallet (there used to be always two pallets), but there's a possibility for it to spawn with two
---
*haha someone’s about to get instadowned****ohfuckohfucj***
---
Ooooo a full set of perks like how Kate's are done would be AMAZING
---
Do you even bloodpoint bonus bruh?
---
This is a god tier shitpost. Thank you.
---
If you play enough nurse, you eventually come across one every once in a while. If you memorize all their moves, and why they work then you can become great against her.
---
One thing you can use every once in a while is if a nurse blinks right on you, crouch and stand still. On the nurses screen it looks like you ran behind her, but once you do it, you can't use it again for a while.
---
Another thing to do is constantly stay out of Line of sight. Once blink is in fatigue make sure something is always blocking her from seeing you and try to keep moving. Run through jungle gyms, and keep using them as cover to get to another jungle gym. If you stop moving you give the nurse a smaller area to guess where you'll be. Don't be predictable is the most important part, constantly change your strategy and pay attention to when the nurse changes her strat.
---
Basically nurse is who can predict who better. It's why I enjoy playing against her.
---
A post like this showed up last bloodhunt
---
How’d the joke go
---
Oh yeah
---
You took all the bloodpoints debt
---
The P3 nurse just farmed with me and let me go. Unfortunately, my 100% altruism offering was void.
---
"Oh well atleast they'll give me a break since I brought streamers"
---
Exit gate tbagging intensifies
---
Double bloodpoint weekend in a nut shell
---
Fact that nurse is the most popular killer yet one of the most broken-till-boring on 1-4 pc shows the balance of killers and rank system. Also the ruin being top 1 killer perk over BBQ shows how gens take too long to complete Kappa
---
The editing was not obnoxious and overdone, like some videos in a similar style. The humor felt natural, rather than forced. I loved everything about this (especially the moments where the Myers acted like typical NPCs you would find in a stealth game).  
---
I will subscribe for more!
---
Dat sassy Myers pose tho
---
Legions change fits my play style way better than the current one so if anything it's a buff. People get mad at me for playing him the way I do but pretty soon that's going to be the only way to play him.
---
I spot an ifunny watermark
---
Good times haha
---
Better get used to it. Camping was a part of multiplayer games since the dark ages. No one is going to do anything about it and saying survivors DC because of it is pretty stupid. When someone is prone to DCing and rage quitting, they will always find an excuse.
---
Nightmare.
---
If I can 4k as him I can 4k as anyone.
---
how did you find out how to do it in KYF
---
I bought DbD in 2016. DbD is like a drug, you hate it but you can't live without it.
---
These are all horribly unbalanced and game breaking
---
Doesn’t mean they don’t look like that tho
---
I couldn't agree more. I have nearly 1300hrs in it since it came out for free on playstation. Im a devotion 8. :'-(
---
&gt;Maybe I'm wrong and everyone else thinks escaping is the win condition and I'm just oblivious but I'm so used to people in other games tryharding for the highest rank.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
heehee
---
you said the thing i don't like
---
Nobody likes Claudette’s let alone p3 Claudette’s. Easy
---
Why does DBP bring out the abosulte worst Survivors?
---
It's her thread so why not.
---
I had the best time ever being drunk while playing. afterwards i tried to put my shoes on and fell into a cabinet 😬
---
Because here the vault animation overrides part of he fall, in disturbed ward the fall is still far enough to activate
---
My babe boy😘
---
Guys the source is my hamster and pic collage
---
That you’re a Claudette that didn’t DC? Very rare
---
This only happends when the game can’t place enough pallets in the rest of the map. So it looks like you have a very op setup, but actually your map has only given you 8 pallets for the entire trial.
---
Pretty much the most toxic thing you can do in the game...
---
Not really. Popularity of a perk doesn't necessarily suggest that it should be the baseline, it only suggests how powerful and impactful the perk is.
---
I’ve actually had like four killers give me hatch today. And I’ve given hatch to at least 5 survivors today and farmed with a 3v1. Idk probably just your luck
---
Yes it's a bitch move.  You're the killer don't fear survivors rise to the challenge.  Most of them aren't very good anyways.  For every depip squad there are like 9 boosted squads of friends just wanting to play with each other.  They also typically play incredibly overlyaltruistic which can come back to bite them hard.
---
Aside from all of that though there is the fact that survivor queues particularly on console are often broken af.  They might have waited 8, 10, maybe 20 minutes just to get dodged and sent back to the campfire.  It's beyond ignorant to do that to players.  As killer I will play any lobby they throw at me.  Others should do the same.
---
the killer already runs faster than the survivor. if a survivor loops you and you can’t catch them no matter what, it’s not the loops fault, it’s yours.
---
Good old days
---
Suggestion: if the killer is a dick then when I DC he should lose 2 BBQ stacks instead
---
Seems fair tbh
---
Alternate name: Bag
---
Lol I noticed a baby meg in my game so I did this too and then after she called me a tunneller even tho I didn’t hook her
---
Just get bbq, thr teachable will be in the next Level anyway
---
You make alot of fair points and your right im not the greatest killer the highest I have gotten was rank 9 and then I got hit with the reset and currently im sitting at rank 15 but slowly moving back up I understand that a good killer has many ways to combat said "gen rushing" and I agree that if your getting looped you should break off and find some one new. I just feel that the system can be better developed to make the survivors actually have a reason to be like "oh, I better get out of this chase quick before I get caught by the killer", not just be like," sup, imma loop you now good luck Fck boi" you know what I mean? Its understandable that high ranks have some major differences in the way they interact but what im talking about is how survivors and killers alike act in mid tier ranks and lower.
---
Uninstall the game, delete the Dead by Daylight folder in AppData and restart. Then install the game. Fixed it for me.
---
Even though it is the literal main objective of the game, it's honestly not always worth it. There have been many times where I've been sacrificed, but due to me leading the killer around the continent and getting a few heals and only a tiny bit of gen progress, I get more BP than I would have, sneakily avoiding the killer and surviving
---
The Legion changes are actually good. You're probably just bad.
---
Only pussies dodge bc they scared of a challenge. They just wanna face solo queue survivors bc it’s an easy 3-4K everytime
---
My sweet child, is that an ifunny watermark?
---
maybe they got better, but yesterday I literally quit the game for the event because you couldn't get a normal game
---
No, U!
---
That could work
---
To get super toxic people out of your game ASAP/make it known they are not welcome in your lobby.
---
I've gone with the setup once so far, when a guy who called himself "toxic niggas kys" entered my game. Nope. You don't get to play
---
Really nice editing friend! Thanks for sharing :D
---
Mid tier ranks don't suffer from "excessive looping" it's not possible. The system is developed as best as possible to make it so that survivors aren't guaranteed to die if they're seen and that killers aren't guaranteed to get wrecked whenever a pallet is involved. It is balanced, you just need to practice and improve your skills.
---
i'll dodge if i absolutely don't feel like being kited by one dude who just drops all pallets while others rush gens. i don't enjoy running tryhard builds and only strong killers i play are Hag and Spirit. but i love me some Freddy and Doctor and Trapper and these suffer greatly from well coordinated swfs.
---
Spine Chill is top tier. No one believes me...
---
Im sorry but not everyone constantly uses bamboozle or entity blocker also are you a high rank or a low rank just asking to see where your experience level is so i understand the kind of players your against btw im rank 15 atm but was a max or rank 9 in a previous season i've been having less fun playing the game recently if you cant tell fimor reasons im sure you know by now
---
DBD is a game you can only love to hate.
---
This is just a meme now. Legion is fine, time to move on.
---
Lol I'm getting only potatoes that fix one gen and start playing farmville with eachother. I quit the game for the event because I got tired of those easy games
---
Lets you play as a killer you dont own with no addons or perks
---
Freddy/Spirit
---
entity blocker doesn't need a perk, it's a mechanic in the game to prevent infinites. I don't use bamboozle, it's unnecessary. I'm currently at rank 11 and that's about where I stay, between 13 and 9. I have never played a game where a long ass loop wasn't due to my own failures, because looping is kept balanced.
---
*laughs in Iron Maiden*
---
You're god damn right!
---
Off-topic but got some tips for Spirit? Got her yesterday but she is pretty tricky to get right I feel.
---
It is really good, but I don't know if it is top tier x)
---
I see what you did there, or I didn’t. Stop shining that flashlight in my eyes
---
I do trap loops and I know about perks like bamboozle and the like im currently rank 15 but in previous seasons I have made it to rank 9 at my best  and traping loops doesnt always work because of the fact that not everyone knows all of the main looping points the main looping point that I know is the jungle gym and the killer shack and i normally trap them and almost any window I know would be used alot im not completly useless based on the way your comment is worded.
---
He's rank 15, thinks he knows what he's talking about but has no idea what entity blocker is. he's either trolling or he has no idea how to read
---
Like many others, the moonwalk bit was gold.  Especially the overlap of the song 3x when they all went.
---
Get him!
---
Any splinter allows you to play as any licensed character (mike, pig etc). Bone allows you to play as leatherface.
---
Given how buggered the Killer experience is, right now, co-ordinated SWF groups are pretty much unbeatable.
---
For competitive people, this makes for very stressful matches. If you just wanna mess about with your friends, don't take in any items.
---
Do you think it was intentional?
---
Hey man, don’t diss my girl Hag like that. She can punish Loops/Maps and obliterate chases like no other Killer can.
---
Change dying light for ruin and it would be a hard decision
---
*Talks about Killers being scared of a challenge*
---
*Uses voice chat for a unfair advantage, for which the game wasn't designed*
---
Imma stop you at NOED as it is 100% countable. It doesnt take long to break totems as 90% of them are next to gens
---
Was this on Xbox..?
---
Oh you use BPS? How about a game crash. (My game, 80% of times. Idk why it hates BPS so much.)
---
Thx and i understand what i havent been elaborating on well enough is how im being looped, i know about the mind games and the window blocking when im saying im getting looped i dont usually mean pallets and windows i am able to predict where they will go and get some good cut offs the problems im having are when your at a L fence for example you can see them they can see you and litterlally the only way you can get them is leave the area or hope they lag behind or run into a wall and get stuck because thats what i ment by infinit looping. Its when they have all the power in the situation where you have no other choice other than to keep looping or leave not woery about whether they will jump through that window that you can hit them at or around that corner you know you could have double back at or that pallet you could have respected
---
There's meant to just be one now, but recently two have been spawning sometimes on some maps.
---
Lag.
---
...You have to crouch away from the Hook for like, 2 seconds.
---
------------------------------------------
---
Is that a ddlc reference!!!!!
---
Yeah for real. If I die early I just think to myself, oh well, next trial comes faster this way. The only possible way I could see for being frustrated is if you had a high end offering or item, but even then, it's still better than just losing it because the game straight up didn't load.
---
I'm doing the same. I play normal til everyones been hooked twice (stop killing yourselves goddammit!) And then let em go or farm. By then I usually maxed out my own points anyway.
---
Except you don't use any of them. Are you complaining because this is something that happens to you regularly or are you complaining because it's something that could potentially happen to someone at some point? because the game is balanced around what actually happens, not what could. In the same way that at some point the moon could get blown up by aliens and cause an extinction event followed by an invasion, that doesn't mean it's likely or that we should plan for that. Looping is about as balanced as it can get right now, if you have difficulties then it sucks to suck.
---
I agree and i already watch noob3 and monto but i dont know many others
---
Vaults have been extremely sketcy ever since they implemented the medium vault, its so infuriating and it was definitely not lag, hitboxes literally hang out by vaults for several seconds, espe3if the killer is close
---
Also the second perk looks suspiciously like infectious fright.
---
Because they included a survivor perk. Remember its 4 survivors to every 1 killer
---
meggg will always be my favorite but i’ve been playing late a lot lately too. i’ve just been trying to level up all the survivors to 50.
---
This is why this game need a Ranked/Unranked mode. Or at least a “casual” playlist and a “Survivor” playlist of some kind.
---
It **is** nice farming Bloodpoints, but I’m at the point now where I just want to use the Items/Addons I’ve bought. I’ve had 3 Killer Rounds in a row where people brought Streamers, and I just wasted my Purple AddOns because I felt bad and just farmed with them instead.
---
i feel for you, everyone wants stuff to be acclimated for them without trying to adapt to the game first. it’ll end up killing the whole game
---
Ok your taking this off in another direction please notice my misuse of the word and move on based upon my correction
---
I had hung everyone twice so I didn’t kill anyone.  If I downed anyone I’d just slug them but generally just let them finish gens and exit.
---
Rotten Fields fucks with both survivors and killers, it's not exclusive by any means.
---
But isnt that fun for everyone? I dont see the problem. I love playing with killers like you
---
I'd be down but my controllers kinda wonky so I can be a gen jockey. PSN: AugmentedAlpha
---
Why should anyone care about rank? There are no rewards or incentives. Plus this is a casual game meant for fun. If you want to focus on getting to the goal you can just as much as not giving to jiggles of a jack rabbits patoot.
---
Or you can just keep chasing them since you get faster every 15 seconds and they can only use that window 3 times. Chase them for 30 seconds and suddenly you're too fast for them to do anything. This is just proving more and more that you don't know as much as you think you do about this game because you struggle with some fundamental reasoning.
---
If you havent looked at the newest comment from me then this is what you missed 
---
 i understand what i havent been elaborating on well enough is how im being looped, i know about the mind games and the window blocking when im saying im getting looped i dont usually mean pallets and windows i am able to predict where they will go and get some good cut offs the problems im having are when your at a L fence for example you can see them they can see you and litterlally the only way you can get them is leave the area or hope they lag behind or run into a wall and get stuck because thats what i ment by infinit looping.

---
Human kindness and/or pity
---
This would be so much easier to show you but I cant
---
Even if it was, BHVR won’t do anything about it. Best thing to do is go beat up his teammates while this dude  hides in his spot.
---
but the BLOODPOINTS man!
---
I'm away from my PS4. Add me and I'll accept it on the app.
---
I’ve been getting a few more Hag’s than usual too. I think a lot of people are levelling her up for Ruin?
---
yeah i get that. it's a hard map to play cos it can be very disorienting and there's no grass to hide blood stains but the constant los-breaking make it hard for the killer to keep track of you (especially nurse) and all the walls, corners and stuff laying around make it for killers like huntress, plague, clown and hillbilly to really utilize their powers. trapper is also really bad on that map. the only killer that really excels on that map imo is hag and myers with scratched mirror
---
My philosophy. As a killer, get your kills anyway you cam and ignore made up rules. Even if you're a Noed face campy pos.
---
Uh huh uh huh, and for the sake of my notes the shirtless David skin is a must, correct?
---
I know it an amazing thought but your not going to do very well with new killers, expect to do bad for a while when learning a new killer. If you want to do well every game then play killers you are good with.
---
The numbers are of the total perks so the highest possible percentage is 25%. So 20% for ruin essential means its used in 80% of the matches.
---
So he's a bit like Limbo in Warframe?
---
You're saying killer doesn't benefit from 3 minutes of extra time?
---
If it's clear that you cannot pick him up from there, yeah I'd report it. It's pretty clearly exploiting an error in the map, not outplaying you or anything.
---
Exploiting bugs is a reportable offense.
---
your version literally encourages camping even more
---
the counter to camping is gen rushing. if MS were to block gens or apply a dying light debuff, it would slow down gen progress thus making camping more effective
---
Yep!
---
He enforces the rules of Halloween.  It's an awesome movie.
---
Btw i asked for negative comments to be at a minimal because this is a descusion tab not a get gud tab
---
what stops you from sabotaging your connection at the end of the game?
---
Read it and replied to it since you're just wrong. There isn't a single loop where you can't catch them, some are just slower than others. I know the L wall you mean, but it's not as safe as you think, just follow them through the window and they only get to use it three times, meanwhile they haven't made you break a pallet so you're just getting faster and faster. Unless you play it the dumbest way possible then that loop is exhausted in less than half a gen
---
I thought it didn’t matter where you did it.
---
-sad console peasant noises- those Jeff ones are awsome!
---
that is also fair, rank is more about time spent playing the game rather than skill i suppose. idk. just pay attention to where survivors run, trap loops and jungle gyms and you shouldn’t have a problem catching survivors. trust me, as a survivor main i’ve seen my team step in some pretty obvious traps and i’ve stepped in them too. hell, trap a couple random spots and you may be able to catch a few. not everything difficult means it needs nerfed, you just gotta adapt ya feel
---
Ofc it doesn't. I mean, look at the %, that's mostly nothing, except Ruin and BBQ. Same goes for survivor perks.
---
Im pretty sure at this point people could care less about what i say in all regards even irl at this point
---
No, im assuming you can get him if you wiggle enough and hes bleeding out, the game will end eventually
---
Just play the match
---
But the difference is, these perks have counters. And I don't know many people who complain about those three any more. The only surv perk I think needs a nerf is MoM. Which (unless you're Huntress or Billy) can deny you a hook, cost you lots of time, and fuck you over. Just like old DS. As for these perks, you can destroy or work through ruin, and at the end of the day. A great skill check is about 2% more progress. It won't take much longer if you just hit the skill checks. And with BBQ, you can hop In a locker or mindgame the killer. This concludes my TEDtalk.
---
No need to get all moody like a teenager who lost an argument. I frankly don't really need to know your life events, I'm sorry things are going poorly for you but it doesn't have impact here. If you need help there are numbers you can call and people you can talk to
---
that is very suprising to me. before the event i had 1-2 DCs per game on average but since the event started they have become way more rare to the point where i can actually enjoy playing kilelr again. may i ask at which rank?
---
Gotta run WGLF, then unhooking is always worth it. Extra 2k for safe unhook after gates are powered and 25% more bloodpoints is worth more than escaping
---
So accurate.
---
you \*really\* think the devs didn't take shit like skype into consideration? the game dropped in 2016
---
I never once said anything needed nerfed i just bekieve that "looping" can be made less of a problem by expanding the ways a player can escape that feels legitamate to both player and killer like stuning the killer who goes through a trapped window that the survivor trapped by finding materials around the map or something of the like to slow the killer down without making nessacery to loop them and i agree with u btw
---
If youre on pc turn down the quality the maps get brighter and the survivors are more distinguished
---
* Best Teachable killer perk in the game, Ruin.  Makes any killer that isn't Nurse or Billy viable at higher ranks.
---
* Her perk makes her amazing at getting BP without even trying.  It's like Trapper's Trap except you can TP to it, almost guarantee a hit, and is stupidly easy to counter but most people don't know how \[Crouch through it instead of walking into the sigil.\]
---
* Generally all around good killer that is fairly newb friendly.
---
i get somany toxic game's when i play but somehow i keep getting a better rank lol
---
You say those two things like it's easy.  Ruin already halts generator progress, and sorry, you're not gonna hit great skill checks all the time.  Coupled with BBQ, getting into a locker / hiding behind a gen wastes time or doesn't work.  Survivors auras are bugged and you can see a slightly darker aura through or infront of gens, and their hair is buggy, also It's just too much if someone can't break ruin in a timely manner.  MoM doesn't seem like an issue.  DS was never an issue to me, just hit them again.  Sure it's a bit of a time sink, but lots of things are.  Using the back basement hook is a major time sink lots of people do and don't think about lol.  Pop em on the first hook and get back to hunting.
---
For someone who likes to seem like they make factual based arguments, there is a lot of assumptions and needless condescending language. You’ve fallen back into that category of “I’m always right because I can google something” type, who can’t seem to understand two points to any argument ever. I recognize killer can be difficult, but think survivor is harder. You double down on your beliefs and seem almost offended that someone has a different opinion than you. Get off your high horse, you’re not that special.
---
Featuring big personalities such as myself, Deadic the killing editor, Aaron the screamer, the sacrificed Algomancy and Steffy the retching survivor.
---
I don't think that killing 3/4 people is hard, especialy during double BP, survivors turn to potatoes that are trying to get as much points as possible. When there is no double BP it's definetely harder but still it's nto hard. Killers are now in really good position, if you know your movement speed and if you have overall game knowledge is fine. You can't win everytime, you win some, you lose some. People are just salty you need to bear with it.
---
Yeah, and the fact that three minutes is enough to do five gens means that there's more than enough time to find all of the totems to avoid NOED. You're just backing up the argument that I'm working towards.
---
Came out wrong not being moody just getting annoyed with myself and the way that anyone i talk to tends to not understand what im saying or meaning because i dont know how to express my thoughts better im kinda anti social except on the internet but im bad at expkaining things not to mention its 1:57 in the morning where im at right now i should really sleep
---
Or how about they solve much more glaring issues like the infinite loading screen where half the survivors in a match don’t load in, face camping, balancing the fucking perks, improving optimization, improving the map design, or any of these things instead of fixing your fragile ego
---
your stamina idea in the other post would be a nerf to survivors. and it would be interesting to add more was to escape from a killer, but i don’t see that happening any time soon really. i feel like it would be really difficult for them to implement that kind of thing for now. looping is a bit boring but it’s all survivors have to use at the moment
---
You are the one person on this sub who's just 100% genuine and not toxic, keep up the great work man
---
That's fucking great, but expecting others to want to do that- and being annoyed when they just *want to play the game* - is just ludicrous.
---
I don't get to play very often. When I manage to get a game, I want to play. Call me a try hard but if you run up to me to try to farm I'm just going to hook you asap to get the shitty match over with.
---
It helps but the most important factor is really knowing maps
---
Queue times have gone to shit for both killer and survivor for me. I'm rank 9 on killer and 15 on survivor (i suck)
---
Leatherface you mentioned is pretty new for me and I leveled him up for BBQ and chili. I got a few survivour puddings along the way so I´m using those atm haha. Yeah I´m bad as him but I still get some points because of double bp :)
---
I pre ordered it, bitch.
---
i get that, but people will only read the stamina comment at face value, like i did. they won’t realize you were frustrated at the time of making that comment. 
---
and apologizing for camping doesn’t make it better, at least not for me. if the survivors are swarming hook or looping you around the hooked survivor, then i’d get it but otherwise, no. but if they were toxic to you like teabagging or clicking a flashlight towards you for no reason then by all means camp lol, i would.
---
WGLF needs buffed
---
About BBQ, people run it for points, aura reading is secondary.
---
About ruin, I said it multiple times and I'll say that again. It would take you an hour of trying to learn how to land 90% of greats.
---
I'm surprised no ones done this yet. Frank, Julie, Susie, Joe.... And it'd actually be canon
---
Dwight in a closet was more about newbie identification than it was his potential homosexual undertones haha.
---
Nea is a killer was a great one though lmao My friends and I used to spread "OH SHIT IT IS THE KILLER!" whenever there was a nea in the lobby all the time. We all started that joke simply because of how ugly they made her look. Now, it has involved into her straight up being the entity lmao
---
Way worse. It was good good for a while but it went back to being in view of gens 80% of the time
---
I love your videos. This is hilarious!
---
I was thinking about making it nurse but a p3 nurse is not always good while a p3 claudette is always retarted
---
So basically a custom character? Why not, it's not as if the survivors we have now are unique anyway.
---
This. My totem literally spawned in an open field in disturbed ward yesterday.
---
Thats exactly when i do it lol you got it perfect you actually understood what i ment better tan alot of people on this thread because you didnt jump to conclusions so thx

---
Fucking kek
---
Yikes that sucks. It's like they stealth reverted the totem changes
---
that is the best thing to do to a toxic survivor and i don’t blame killers for camping flashlight clickers. and no problem. i will admit i do jump to conclusions at first but i’m always willing to hear people out and i get where you’re coming from
---
What show is this?
---
Spinechill stresses me out, can’t play right like that.
---
I have gotten 3 Ebony Nurses, 90% Shotgun Billies who tunnel, Spirits who play the long game during a hatch standoff, several Doctors who tunnel even when being bodyblocked by other survivors and a bunch of facecamping Bubbas. And that's if I don't get an infinite loading screen or game crash/freeze. This event has been pretty weird.
---
Stand still as the spirit and people think you've phased somewhere else, and promptly run into you
---
You can power through ruin. And BBQ is for points with so many counters to bbq theres no claim for aura reading.
---
Commit!
---
Yep
---
I remember they removed them, because It was nearly impossible to get tier 3, because of how bloodweb works. You would either have to be really lucky or buy every single tier 2 perk before getting them
---
Awww. No worries. It means bloody party streamers.
---
&gt; No, Not even some killers like noed, and saying killer mains like it is an assumption that isn't true. Also noed can be countered which some people need to learn.
---
Yeah, most of us don't really like it, but I do think it needs a rework because its counterplay is really stupid.
---
&gt; If you think DS wasn't a problem and didn't need to be gutted then i have no words. Also the perk is far from garbage now with its 5 sec stun, saying otherwise is dumb.
---
I am pretty sure they don't disagree with DS having been a problem, but they are outlining how it was nerfed into oblivion: hook requirement + 3 second stun [which could be reduced to 1 second if you ran Enduring] made it borderline useless. So they outlined how it needed to be buffed to 5 seconds again to be viable. They never said it was garbage with its 5 second stun.
---
&gt; Flashlights, when the pick up time was 4 sec, was basically a guaranteed get off if there wasn't a wall nearby. Or you could slug in situations where you shouldn't. I see your point with insta saw billy but bubba? what about bubba? just don't go in open fields.
---
No disagrees that flashlights were really dumb in the past, but these days it is extremely rare to see flashlight saves at all, and they are outlining how two-faced it is to appease the crowd rallying against that guaranteed mechanic while not addressing Hillbilly's stupid charge-time add-ons that make his chainsaw a Shotgun.
---
&gt; EGC didn't really do much for killers, but you cant compare it to bodyblocking which is holding the game hostage. The killer could force the survivors out. The survivor cant escape a bodyblock.
---
They are outlining the fact that EGC was added into solve the hatch standoff, because many killers complained that the survivor could hold the game hostage that way, but still haven't addressed how killers can hold the game hostage by bodyblocking at basement stairs.
---
&gt; Bloodlust was added for them loops where YOU LITERALLY COULDN'T CATCH THEM, also BL was added ages ago so how can that be a valid point for how they "appreciate" killers now?
---
Sure, bloodlust was added in to counter loops, but it also affects the rest of gameplay where loops aren't a factor and ultimately makes chases borderline strolling distance. I still think BL was a good mechanic to add in, I just wish it was more situational as it doesn't feel balanced for every killer.
---
&gt; Meanwhile survivors are still in the corner with an 80% escape rate at R1 PC, Mettle of man being completely broken a long with adrenaline. And (still) stupid short gen times. 
---
No they are not, that statistic is very, very disingenuous and was already called out by people for being flawed and easily discerned as an unnatural outlier:
---
&gt; This one is a little bit of an oversight. The game takes your rank from after the match, not the start. In addition, these stats were collected from April 1st to April 7th. This was when it was significantly harder for survivors to pip. So what ended up happening was that most of the survivors that died would derank and count as a rank 2 death, whereas those who survived would remain at rank 1 and count as an escape. It was very rare to die at rank 1 and not derank at that time. **In short, it's actually much closer to 43% if you took the starts from a week later.**
---
If you can pick him up no. If you cant then yes from what im seeing yeah thats bannable.
---
Problem is... I don't have the hag
---
My wet dreams are actually acquiring the hex ruin perk
---
That’s embarrassing, i totally should have figured that out lol
---
No
---
It does me too but it helps so much that i can't imagine playing without it now lol
---
you can get there as a killer with a lunge tho
---
With regards to 3, events end up making survivors try way harder than normal, esp. through swf. With survivors playing well, not only is BPS not worth it (5 gens done in 2-3 minutes = barely any points), it becomes painfully obvious how busted the game is, so some killers get frustrated and bring moris. I do it myself, if I see 4 toolboxes the pinks start coming out.
---
came here to say this exactly this. never have I ever seen a killer worse than me
---
Don't know why you are being downvoted, you are actually right and the other guy is wrong.
---
The only other option is to add a tunnel to Basement that has a staircase somewhere else in the map so it's impossible to fully camp it.
---
I can't think of a way to "Fix" the basement that doesn't make camping better.
---
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha I got this with a 3 man game where one suicided and the other one i was suprised could even manage to get up in the morning hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
This is so fucking perfect especially with the Blood Warden
---
Yeah, that's a good point, forgot about that. Maybe the game would just be better without self-care, but it is a little too powerful for a perk.
---
If YOu DOnT wHAnT Dcs JuST DoN’t Use RuIN
---
(300h random survivor)
---
It's an offering that used to spawn in the Blood Web that you could burn to play as a Killer that you didn't have unlocked yet at the cost of no perks or add ons equipped. I don't think they're available to find anymore, however.
---
If I get a feeling I'm being "gen rushed", most of the time it means I'm failing as a killer - I don't apply enough pressure. I play without Ruin or any other game slowing perks, so the only way to slow down gen repair is to hook people as often as you can. You hook one and find and chase other one, that's half of survivors not doing gens. If third one goes for rescue and heal, that's 75% slow down. If fourth one is hiding because the chase is near them - you're doing great as a killer.
---
Also, camping means less bloodpoints. And for me that's a second main reason not to camp (first one - camping is boring)
---
God I remember having my first brown perk and it was deerstalker. I miss the Pink perks too, I wish they would bring them back.
---
Perks that don't have a garanteed effect are not worth using (Monstrous Shrine, Slippery Meat or Up The Ande). I don't know what they were thinking when creating them.
---
Huntress&amp;Wraith win the most useless Killer perks and Kate&amp;Ace win the most useless Survivor perks. Plus, many no teachables are useless as fuck (Unrelenting, Dejavu...).
---
What do you mean? When they are all broken they are all one hit, that's what I'm refering to.
---
The bonus lunge is really negligible if that's what you're refering to. I'd say it's outweighted by the fact that she can get to the one hit stage faster than him, as she doesn't need to stalk them for a long time.
---
And???
---
I don't think it is all that bad now. It used to be 80% healing speed + 100% efficiency when self healing with medkits, so you could make a medkit last basically forever lmao Combined with early loops and boy did people never go down. These days it ain't nearly as powerful, it is just one of those "mandatory" perks.
---
The picture in the post is making fun of the people that don't want to farm?
---
Plenty of people get angry at the killer/survivors that don't want to farm, wdym?
---
Not really. Killers would just pick the same spots every time.
---
I love how I changed the perk icons about 2 years ago in DBD and everyone on Reddit would say that I will get banned for tempering with the files and how others got banned for this and now everyone is changing their perk icons, lol.
---
Wait is this game still exist?
---
Aww I thought you meant you made brand new ones. If you could I'm sure there's some sort of business within that, designing people personal perk icons. I bet the streamers would pay you to do that.
---
ooooo
---
Me too, they always took some time to complete but you were rewarded with a great amount of bloodpoints.
---
thanks
---
&gt;survivors stomp, the killer has to outplay them in almost every chase
---
Don't they also have to outplay the killer to have an advantage? I never get the argument that it's on the survivor to make a mistake for the killer to get an advantage, it's the same the other way around. If the killer fucks up he gets punished, if the survivors mess up they also get punished.
---
I get the first part, yeah.
---
agree, they're my fave!
---
Survivor spawns in front of Ruin totem, back to back L wall T walls and jungle gyms in Coldwind
---
You compared regular plague with tier 3 myers, not a plague who has already puked over everyone. Also Tier 3 myers doesn't need to get to one hit stage because he already is in one. You can't compare base plague to a tier 3 myers, you can either compare plague to myers in general, or plague who has puked someone into broken vs t3  myers.
---
because it's for perspnal use
---
They removed them from the game a long time ago. The reason was that the rituals took more time to complete.
---
ok
---
I literally only played killer 4 times, and 3 more in KYF, but at that point I was so sick of getting shit on as killer so I ragequit 2/3 of those KYF servers.
---
Oh I already do :) Commissions for people's fan concepts.
---
I been on Xbox since it got released even pre ordered but I’m just amazed how many new players they got on PS4 when it was free shit I’m thinking about also trying it on PS4 as I might have a easier time.
---
I understand the hits after they vault and are still about to plant their feet, but registering hits after multiple steps is bullshit.  Killers have been credited with every hit lately with vaults and they need to be addressed.
---
I really wish I could. I'm in Australia, and killer lobbies are absolute garbage. I've spent the whole event playing survivor just so I can get anything.
---
me, has that exact look equipped already: *Nice.*
---
you must be fun at parties
---
I am not saying that Clown is only having a bad killrate because he's not popular, in the response to the original post I say that I think he doesn't have a skill ceiling and needs a mini rework.
---
I do not consider Plague weak, so my only explanation for her having a low kill rate is few people playing her and understanding how to play her.
---
The reason for why I think Hag has a high killrate thanks to mains is because Hag has a pretty niche playstyle compared to the rest of the cast. A lot of the basic killer knowledge doesn't transfer to her. So due to how specific she is (while being a strong character) I think she's only played by her dedicated mains (and occasionaly people trying her out).
---
You got camped so hard, it even ignored the pip system and made you lose about 40 pips in 10 games (if you had 0 at 8, as ranks 12-2 have 5 pips and ranks 18-13 have 4 pips).  
---
Yes, I'm a professional at parties.
---
I can't recommend FunGoose enough. He's Australian, super chill, very positive and incredibly educational. I'm still really new to the game, but I've learned heaps from Goose.
---
it appears in a random bloodweb once unlocked. you don't have to prestige to unlock it.
---
Bag
---
Just do the gen and pray the killer will have mercy and farm.
---
Yeah I have found a few of those shards today, its always to play as Freddy or The Shape. I don't care to play either tho.
---
Thanks.
---
30-45 mins????There's no way a farming match could last that long.If you're survivor just do the gens and gtfo and if killer just force them to do gens if you don't really want to farm.If they don't oblige just kill them that's their fault for not obeying the killer
---
The best part is setting them all up on the dropdown in The Game.
---
I don't think a the split would do any good.
---
The playerbase isn't large enough to and the game isn't competetive enough to warrant it. Everyone would be suffering from really long queues.
---
The reason why ranked matchmaking is needed is because the newest players shouldn't be facing more experienced players. So say you would be rank 13, and you are queueing into a casual match. Well tough luck, you got matched against an equivelant of 4 red rank survivors and you get stomped. I think a ton of players would be playing casual just to stomp new players.
---
Ranked would be an AWFUL experience, broken add ons &amp; instaheals + hatch camping every game, nobody would want to play that.
---
Once you max out a lvl 50 bloodweb the bloodweb resets as normal but you stay at 50
---
Turn down your mic gain.
---
You're peaking every single time you speak.
---
Can't wait to try it out with Vigil.
---
If survivors are good players, then killers get punished much harder for their mistakes than survivors get from theirs. The only exception is nurse.
---
Of course I talk from a viewpoint of someone who doesn't tunnel or proxy camp (though I don't see anything wrong with either of those). But even then good survivors know not to save in front of the killer and just rush gens if killer is proxy camping.
---
It is very hard for killer to catch survivors fast enough if they are doing gens fast and are all good at looping. If the killer doesn't catch a survivor early, then he has lost too much momentum and likely gets gen rushed. 
---
If survivor messes up and killer catches him, then survivors still have a good chance to recover from it.
---
In order to catch a good survivor early, the killer pretty much has to ouplay him (mindgame succesfully in a chase). If killer messes up (overextends a chase, tries a mindgame that doesn't work, can't find anyone fast enough etc..) then its already game over.
---
Most killers only really can have good map pressure if they can finish chases fast, otherwise they get gen rushed. And there is not much a killer can do against a good looper to cut the chase short enough.
---
BBQ &amp; chili, devour hope, make your choice, and 2x BP event.....And still killers will camp. So much lost potential.
---
I played scratched mirror myers on lery’s and it was fun seeing survivors jerk their mouse after being scaring the living jesus out of them when I turn the corner to jumpscare them
---
both are shit
---
I am refering to PERMA tier 3 Myers. It takes a long time for him to stalk and get his tier 3 ready for all of the match.
---
Plague also has to spend some time getting people into broken state, but she doesn't have to spend nearly as much time.
---
William "Bill" Overbeck  
---
The old guy from "left 4 dead"
---
There's nothing wrong with people wanting to have a normal match. Not everyone is interested in farming and it's unfair that they get stuck in a match where everyone is just messing around/farming. It's a waste of their time.  
---
When I'm farming as a killer I try to give those people a somewhat "normal" play.
---
The kill should be getting de-pip when they tunnel and camp a certain surviver.
---
Honestly yea that would be great. Just the Black robe was John's, so idk if they don't have the license to his model or something. It wouldn't be very lore friendly, but lets be real, neither are most of the cosmetics
---
You called?
---
i once got a yellow mori at level 3 hag...
---
Toxic Myers would be scratched mirror with haunted ground/ruin  with bbq and ebony mori.
---
His ultra rares are hot garbage and take forever to get some juicy end results
---
I mean infinite tier 3 is a bit broken but everything is whatevet
---
What was your ping?
---
my virginity too
---
&gt;In order to catch a good survivor early, the killer pretty much has to ouplay him (mindgame succesfully in a chase). If killer messes up (overextends a chase, tries a mindgame that doesn't work, can't find anyone fast enough etc..) then its already game over.
---
If you play better than them in the chase and down them fast, you can use them as pressure on other survivors and slow the game down.
---
&gt;Most killers only really can have good map pressure if they can finish chases fast, otherwise they get gen rushed. And there is not much a killer can do against a good looper to cut the chase short enough.
---
If you know that the chase you're engagin in is not going to be successful, there is no harm in going for a different target. Chase them for a bit, make them burn through resources (pallets) and then go for someone else &amp; try to focus on that area where there is nothing for the survivor to play with.
---
You have to make good macro decisions as killer, that's for sure. But it's the same for survivors, if they make bad decisions and waste too much time they'll lose the match too, as the killer will drain them out of their resources and pressure them down.
---
Your dumb read petch nots it is says „playing legion makes you ban“
---
Bye bye see you in a month
---
Any killer that grants deviousness and brutality when hitting survivors with their power is a good bp gain killer.
---
Wraith with suprise attack, Frenzy hits, Hag's tp hit, Billy's chainsaw, Nurse's blink hit, Huntress' hatchets, bubba's chainsaw &amp; Pig's ambush hit, tho those are a bit inconvenient to land
---
Got it shortly after the pig was released
---
I played it since beta..
---
It's only bannable if it prolongs the game indefinitely. If he wasn't in the dying state then it would be.
---
I know, I was just flabbergasted that you would have the audacity to call him Bill "Will".
---
Ps4 NA. I was working gens, getting the sound alert for the L1 prompt yet the bar didn't appear the entire match neither was I actually able to press L1 and have the game register it. Was as if I wasn't pushing anything. Only match it happened in. I did not have an item equipped.
---
This is the most accurate thing I've seen in my life.
---
Yes it was.
---
It depends on what rank you are. If you're rank 1 the chances are they're god like survivors and will be annoying af. However if you're at rank 15 there's no point because 95% of the time they're noobs who probably hook dive. I have no clue why you're being down voted. A lot of people just don't like having to try-hard against tryhards, it's annoying. Some killers just like playing whoever they want to instead of playing Billy/Nurse/Spirit. I personally love SWFs though because I like to try-hard back (I love the hate, or sometimes compliments). To each their own. I mean you can not try-hard and play whoever and use whatever perks you want against rank 1 SWFs, but you'll very likely be T-bagged and end up with zero sacrifices (maybe one or two if you camp and use NOED, which isn't smart because it ruins your BP gain).
---
I love stake out, mostly because it makes going up against ruin pretty chill, if you get the stacks at least :p
---
Don’t forget in the Friday the 13th game, Jason is actually really damn fast when he’s in water (especially with the right Jason)
---
that would be kinda op for the survivors. You could make the smallest possible character, who naturally wears dark colors and has a darker skin tone to make them a perfect hider. This also means the killer would have nothing to go off of in the way or perks
---
Probably only addons and offerings would be my guess.
---
Then...when they let their guard down &gt;:)
---
I mean I've called him bill in the past and people have gotten confused and thought I meant billy
---
Killers buffs and survivor nerfs have evened out the playing field a lot. Most killers aren’t Nurse/Billy level, and they probably never will be, but getting three or four kills is easily achievable for most of them now if the player knows what they’re doing.
---
You know that hook camping is largely universal right? The only thing that Basement camping does is allow the Killer to block Survivors, and in general is BETTER because Survs are more likely to view that survivor as a lost cause and not get Unhook-Downed and instead progress the game. Unless they’re a SWF and in which case I don’t give a shit if they feel the Killer is camping or not.
---
I wouldn't mind being able to craft items using brown add-ons to make a better quality item,sense they're taking up space
---
Don't know why you're being downvoted for this, you speak the truth.
---
&gt;Yes of course, but we are talking about 4 good survivors who are all good at looping.
---
You misunderstood me, I'm not saying "look for a weaker survivor", I meant "look for a survivor in a weaker area". If the survivor is running towards a strong structure, they will be harder to get than someone working on a gen between 2 L and T walls. It's much easier to get a hit in there.
---
&gt;
---
    Chase them for a bit, make them burn through resources (pallets) and then go for someone else
---
If survivors burn the gens fast enough, then they will be already waving at you from exit games by the time you have gone through all pallets.
---
But I am not saying chase them for a long time till they completely run out of pallets, make them use something and then switch targets if you don't think you can catch them.
---
&gt;Good survivors don't waste any time and it is not hard for them to not waste any time.
---
And good killers don't waste time either? 
---
&gt;the killer has to play really focused like a hamster in a wheel, it is much easier to make a mistake and the mistakes are much more punishing.
---
No that's not how it works, if you know what you're doing as killer you won't go tunnel vision. You can absolutely multitask chasing someone and paying attention to what is happening on the map.
---
&gt; It is not as simple as killer outplaying a survivor and downing him vs a survivor outplaying the killer and considerably extending the chase having similar benefits for either side - the killer has to consistently outplay the survivor several times more than the survivors can outplay the killer to have an EQUAL chance.
---
There are several survivors and one killer, so it stands to reason that you have to get multiple of the survivors. If all it took is downing one person to win, it wouldn't be much of a 4v1 would it?
---
I got coldwin 4 times in a row yesterday. That jungle gym change cant get here soon enough.
---
I've seen my fair amount of dickbags killers such as ones who specifically bring Moris and camp one guy all game just so they can use it.
---
A perk that needs two other perks to have a effect is not worth it. Shadowborn became useless after M&amp;M
---
"medium vault"
---
See? this is the reason.
---
It's never smart to medium vault, so you should've tried to bait the hit or gone for a fast vault.
---
Loved the vid man!
---
Yes.
---
That is downloading a 'hacked' save file (i know it's not hacked) but that is very bannable people have been perma banned for this in the past.
---
Yeah x'D
---
Still needs correct pricing. And 10 bucks for a single outfit for a single survivor is just too much, seeing as the DLC that give you a new killer and survivor are not far off
---
Okay thank you I'll try this, could you just tell me where to find the AppData folder please? Like steps how to get to it
---
TBH they really shouldn’t have ranks at all. Sometimes you should get stomped, sometime you should stomp. Other times it should be a close game.
---
On top of this SWF shouldn’t be a thing either, but TBH it’s always nice to play games with friends.
---
What I love to do is run sprint burst and premonition on lerys. When I see killer coming while I'm on a gen I run with sprint burst the opposite way, then turn back and run to the nearest locker near gen that I was doing. Killers don't check lockers when they see scratch marks, and I see him the entire time. You can also run quick and quiet and unbreakable.
---
My favorite is you're on the hook, the killer's wandering around and there's two dipshits teabagging the exit just a short distance away..
---
You can get hit through windows. You can get hit through the fence at Haddonfield too if you are too close to it. It's always been this way.
---
&gt;The reason why ranked matchmaking is needed is because the newest players shouldn't be facing more experienced players.
---
Sorry, but the current matchmaking system doesn't address this. There is nothing more frustrating than having to play against player(s) with 1k+ hours in the game when I have 200.
---
I agree. Just played a match against 2 of those with trapper: all they did was crouch and disarm my traps, for like 10 minutes. Boring and stupid. They lasted 20 seconds in a chase
---
Without people even answering i'm beyond sure it was heavily voted as a big yes. There is no way a good feature like this wouldn't be wanted. We make all the skins, BHVR implement them without much effort. We get more skins and they get some work off their hands it's a win win.
---
Would it be harder if the killer/survivors are forced to open a door to trigger it. I kept the time the same for a solo player so it was actually fair to them
---
Totally. I felt like I had to pay out for my main characters, but if they were half the price I probably would be inclined to spend a lot more than I already have.
---
Rank literally is a punishment in this game, you get to R1 once for the achievement and then you just either don't care about it ir even want it to be as low as possible. The real thing everyone wants to get is Bps and escaping gives you 5k of those, not to mention that escaping as surv and 3/4k'ing as killer just generally feels good, it makes it feel like you've won, even if you didn't pip.
---
Im a killer main saying this...It makes you a fragile killer that will not reach their max potential . I honestly don't understand why killers do this. If you don't want a challenge, go arm wrestle an infant or something.
---
Pc or ps4
---
Every heard of being a good sport?
---
bunny feng bunny feng bunny 🐰 feng
---
I've been getting slugged like a bastard all day
---
I thought they were called splinters.
---
Its a great idea, but everyone is going to blend.
---
who's the one with bubba?
---
Art was made by myself for anyone curious.
---
I understand the sentiment, but it's so that Lithe isn't worthless. Balanced landing has the bonus anyway for all fall speed reduction.
---
The recent survey proves she is an effective killer so i am assuming people are trying her for that reason.
---
monstrous shrine would probably be better if they buffed the percentages and applied it to all hooks
---
Iv been the most casual dbd player 
---
Since i bought it
---
Now is probably a good time to try since most people want to farm.
---
Got a camping nurse yesterday. Was the sweatiest match I've  ever played.
---
you can grind out shards for cosmetics ?
---
it's not that toxic tbh
---
As a rank 20, I validate this
---
Pallets are the worst part, no mindgames or counterplay at all. At least it’s getting changed...I’m still going to roll my eyes each time it comes though. Forget 3 Claudette the bloody Coldwind maps are the bane of my existence
---
well, I can't loop the for 5 gens if I'm already injured, can't I?
---
why tho?
---
Except Legion, whole squad and so on
---
I’ve seen survivors come back to where I was standing to see if I was AFK. They were very wrong
---
I mean yeah, nothing's really gonna strictly objectively outclass the meta build, but spine chill does give you a fair bit of information. Extremely strong against stealth killers in particular. It's less useful in coordinated swf but in solo play it can be a godsend; I sometimes use it to aggressively do gens that either 1. would be really bad for us if it were part of the last 3 gens or 2. are in really weak structures for running from the killer.
---
he doesn't want you to kobe, what's wrong with that?
---
Though at that point it leaves an opening for a perk to deal with The Basement hooks.
---
IMO Hangman’s Trick should just take all of Monstrous Shrines current Percentages, and rework Monstrous Shrine completely.
---
Then by that logic why was DS reworked since it was 100% couterable. It isn't hard to juggle the obsession or strike randomly to throw them off
---
But survivors should survive.It is in their name.Survival.Every survivor wants to survive as any killer wants to kill.Plus you get 5k for it.Rank means nothing in this game so why even bother.
---
Given the game is only online it'd make sense it would be like this? Kinda similar to Fortnite?
---
Juggling was an exploit breaking totems is a literal mechanic in the game 
---
What a shit comparison that was
---
Let me guess, no party streamers?
---
You also get a haste and insta down on every M1 hit for failing to apply enough gen pressure to stop the Surviviors from powering the gate all bc the Surviviors didn't cleanse all 5 dull totems (which only really happens in SWF since there's no way to track dulls). 
---
But hey we can't point that out bc that doesn't help the narrative that no matter what Surviviors are op and toxic and bullies and broken and responsible for everything and they destroyed the French economy and they're the reason I stubbed my toe this morning.
---
Sold my PS4 and bought a secondhand PC because of that. Need For Speed 2015, The Division, Dead By Daylight, they're all fucked because of PS+.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
I actually think it's pretty good the way it is to be honest. Not all perks are applicable for every game and some killers should have some times where they're like "fuck your 1 perk" as long as they have counter play. Just my thoughts. :) That is an interesting idea though.
---
Dude my roommate easily cleanses them all on his own. They have set spawn locations. It's called pay attention 
---
Survivors have 100% control over the game unless they go up against a God tier killer
---
Your roommate is an anomaly then. And that's also anecdotal evidence which I'm not gonna listen to. 
---
Surviviors as of rn only have control if they're coordinated, which only rly happens if they're smarter than the killer.
---
No they will boot you. However you can buy 1 month for 9.99. Buy that for now if you are short on cash.
---
You only need 3 full survivors worth of evil to get tier three with tuft and tombstone
---
Interesting that the costumes for a killer will cost more than the killer's chapter.
---
Meh at least it works, console doesn’t get infinite load screens.
---
That’s fair, I just wish they would work on making some perks more appealing on both ends. I think the lack of character classes for survivors kind of hurts them on that but so it goes.
---
No the pricing is not wrong, they choose the prices. We don't know how much time they put into one piece of clothing, and they need to make their money back.
---
Edgy aesthetic brings in lots of edgy, underage and/or mentally disturbed people, are you surprised?
---
No he's just a basic survivor maybe you just suck
---
They have to be tricked 2 times to be downed. Like at that point it's their fault for being fooled twice in a row
---
Its a rng thing I've downed and there were no hooks by me at all and then other games every 5 feet. Just a rng thing to see to the game. We all wiggled out on some games its the way they made it.
---
Honestly I would pose the same way after killing anyone on Haddonfield
---
You just cant beat Michelle Visage :(
---
skskskkskskksk
---
If you want a mask cosmetic then yes
---
No if not
---
Can't Mori if you just loop him again for 5 gens or he just DCs ;)
---
Is there another account that is primary on ur ps4?
---
I love it when the Killer brings out his full Ebony inventory if he sees me again and i still do the same like the last game and he DCs.
---
Of course Needless outrage is horrible. But to pretend that Behavior is Survivior sided on the complaints is 100% bullshit. Surviviors have been given a ton of nerfs based on logic that applies to killers, whose nerfs in those same departments were either delayed or never happened.
---
What if you wanted to read a meme
---
But god said dark text on dark background
---
Maybe is he fire blasts a dropped pallet it will break faster too, to deal with loops
---
I see your an ash main😏
---
Oh you guys were talking about splinters n yeah they are but extremely useless
---
now this is a message i can get behind!
---
Be kinda useless to own this game then? Like why would you own this without plus ygm?
---
Lullaby is not that good my man, wasted slot
---
Not enough big terror radius builds: try fat radius doctor
---
Distressing - Overwhelming presence - Unnerving presence - Coulrophobia
---
I think it's down to the asymmetrical nature of the game (us vs. them) and adolescent psychology (adolescence extends well into the 20s).
---
Basically a lot of demonizing the other going,  aversion of pain (not wanting to admit personal fault contributed to undesired outcomes), as well as basic lack of empathy.
---
Plus what a bunch of people said, with survivor mains having a disproportionate number of edgy shitlords.
---
Something you will learn very quick is to not play by any rules, for this exact reason. This goes for both survivor and killer. It sucks for the survivors that aren’t dickheads and are playing equally as fair, but the toxic players ruin it for everyone.
---
It still happens to me every now and then, I’m not gonna lie. I’ll log in to DBD with the mindset of doing some no stress, chill BP grinding and the toxic fucks always make me go, “oh yea, I forgot I can’t play like that”. So that time their teammate unhooks in front of you or debate on giving them the hatch, just don’t. Capitalize on their mistakes.
---
Why’s that
---
Hey man, if I get you once those gens have popped, you're getting camped.
---
Billy is ridiculous with double charge speed. Needs removing. Leatherface needs all the help he can get
---
Foetnite servers down again?
---
I hear it's all about the cosmetics over there.
---
I hate spine chill but lol that perk looks amazing
---
That was funny lol
---
Finally all those green maps and keys will have a use
---
Ok.
---
Is there a way to turn down in game music? It sounds too much like a heartbeat, that I keep moving from generators when I don't need to. The only sound option I found was turning down menu music.
---
Hannibal Lecter.
---
You would be suprised the number 3-4 man games I get because of dumbasses coming back for the rescue. Should've just left, now you're all on the hook.
---
Hey,I looked through the txt but couldn't find anything related to when a survivor steps into trapper's traps.Any info on that?
---
All Bear trap sounds are in the BearTrap Folder.
---
“Unfun” is an understatement. It’s asinine that killers get to get away with this bullshit and it needs to be punished harshly. If devs won’t do anything, then I’ll DC. Not letting the killer get over rewarded by getting extra points off me. He’ll get the quitter bonus, and not one BP more than that.
---
You can get banned for doing it in normal, but can you get banned in KYF? The way of doing the glitch is also different so i am guessing its not but maybe you know it?
---
it’s not just survivors😂
---
Spine Chill should come with a little “Nya” when it activates. Then it’ll be a top tier perk.
---
is that why there were DCs?
---
AFAIK, there isn't any major disadvantages to this anyway. I've been a PC gamer my whole life and I use my steam controller for playing this game and works well enough.
---
Ah,didn't see that folder.Thanks for the quick reply!
---
The thing with electronic sports is that you cant break the rules. Tunel, map, do whatever you need. If a survivor has a regressing gen at 90% and another one at 0%, he is gonna do the 90% gen. No survivor is gonna say "oh im not touching the 90% gen so the killer can have some fun and I dont ruin his experience". In competitive games you play to W I N. If you are playing LoL you are buying the best build for your champ and you always focus the easiest target. If you see 2 survivors, one of them completely heal, 0 hooks and a medic kit (potencial insta heal), and the other injured, with a tool box, and die on hook, you go for the injured one because you want to win. If he wants a good experience, pleas link him candy crush or something like that. Snowflakes think that the world is an extension of his fathers home, were they always win at monopoly because anyone wanna hurt their feeling.
---
Nah, I don't really play for cosmetics. So the few I want I can eventually purchase with shards.
---
And if you got 4 stacks and have done objectives and been chased yummy
---
Yeah, along with the 3 man games it's really unenjoyable to play survivor. You just gotta get lucky with what teammates/killer you get.
---
I run it with resilience, this is not happening and spine chill for being a gen jockey but other than that I don’t see the point
---
Jesus, is being dishonest your job? Totems and boxes are not objectives. There is no point in doing totems, and boxes are especially useless if you brought something on your own. I never said killing isn't the objective, I said camping isn't.
---
Happy cake day though 😘
---
Made with mematic.
---
Did you t-bag ? If not that's toxic AF
---
Ash mains unite!
---
I DON'T MIND NOED BUT WHAT ARE THE COUNTERS?
---
Always do your research before buying a game. The DBD community is notorious for being in constant conflict, survivor/killer mains will almost never be in full agreement of anything other than shirtless Myers.
---
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT?
---
So annoying because that's obviously some dumb kid. You're poor too, kid. You don't have money, your parents do
---
You can also get unlimited 14 day trials
---
1. CLEANSING ALL THE DULL TOTEMS
---
2. NOT GETTING HIT
---
PRETTY STRAIGHTFOWARD
---
Lol Tru but then again alot of randos are out for themselves which makes the game very annoying to play. 
---
I can 360 it works half the time but once a killers' knows ur capable of it then it won't work unless ur lucky.
---
I agree with the fact they work hard on it but given a chapter costs £5 and the game cost £15 to £20 I don't see why one outfit costs the same price as 2X chapters
---
Because once a killer downs you, that was your attempt to not go on the hook. The wiggle bar is there so the killer has to hook you, not so you can get out. 
---
Like someone else said, I would recommend playing killer at least 10% of the time you play survivor if you’re a survivor main. This is so you understand both sides of the playing field. Same goes with killers vis versa. If you dont, you’re gonna be one of those people that spew all kinds of dumb stuff on the forums/reddit. Trust me. At the very least, go watch some killer streams.
---
I guess I've been getting lucky.
---
Rank 5 survivor here and most killers have just been playing normally. No hard tunneling, no camping. They wanna maximize their BBQ+Chili as much as they can.
---
On the flip side, I'm a rank 14 killer and my god the DCs are insane. I just want to play normally but some survivors just want farming matches *every* game. If I see more than two bloody party streamers, sure I'll give it a go..but no one's really popped them when I play killer.
---
Hopefully your survivor experience improves this weekend :(
---
Suggestion: If a Survivor teabags or Bad Manners in any way they lose 50/25% of their BP  
---
Seems fair tbh  
---
/s
---
I played with that guy yeaterday... same results lmao
---
I hate facecamping even as a killer. 
---
It’s boring AND you get less points.
---
Not for me but then again I'm not poor
---
Incredibly bad for me. To do the survivors a favour during farming time ive equipt 3 hex perks on my hag + chili for me. Played 7 games yesterday. Im seriously not even exaggerating. In every game of those, bearing a single totem in a single game, they all spawned next to generators with only one side covered, and them being open to see from all other angles. Worst was one on the hospital map that could be seen along the entire length of one of the long corridors.
---
Why are there so many toxic killers Everytime there is an event going on?
---
Yes, because that's the only thing that ever happens and there are zero survivors who are going out of their way to make this experience shitty for the killer and their teammates
---
Dc isnt toxic, dc is being a pussy
---
The first time I read this: "There will always be the next trial to hook forward to."
---
My experience has been the exact same as yours. I knew there was a chance of some try hard-ness, but I figured because of the bloodhunt people would play a little more fair I guess? I just played a game where a Leatherface face camped while revving his chainsaw. Two died, two escaped. He made it out with less than 10k in bloodpoints while me and the other survivor doubled him. I don’t understand the point.
---
If they didn’t clip all weird, I’d be more reluctant to say no but Kate Denson literally cannot control her hair.
---
Yeh, alright. So, like, there are these people, right? They live in a country you have not heard of. Anyway, these people have this thing where they have no institutionalized government, no central place for their country to amass its power. This means the power goes to whoever happens to be walking by at the time.   
---
So this one guy, he gets all the power, and he starts taking everything for himself. I mean everything; women, children, men, animals, money, food, all of it. This guy would have pre-teen female and male virgins from all sorts of villages brought to him so that he could take their virginity; if you didn't like that then you're probably gonna paint a wall with your brains.  
---
Now the people of the country wouldn't stand for it anymore and they got together and they went to go fuck this guy up, right? But then the US government steps in and says "Nope, this is our guy." The villagers may have had a chance against the country-fuck militia but the US military was too much. And so this guy got to keep doing what he was doing until the US government got him out of that country into the safety of the USA where the villagers could never get revenge for the many atrocities he had committed. He grew old into retirement and passed away peacefully.  
---
Talk about frustrating!
---
Repost...
---
Seriously though. I’ve never seen it so bad.
---
So basicly
---
this gave straight up divides players into 2 groups and makes them fight. they also don't use the same mechanics, so it's never actually balanced.
---
as a result of that, both groups call eachother names for everything that's at least a bit on the stronger side.
---
PC
---
Yeah, the DCs are awful, but they aren't just people being salty, the games sometimes decides to kick you out and there is nothing you can do unfortunately. But yeah, some people go by - if I DC I don't die, which is stupid and there should be consequences for intentionally doing this.
---
Thank you, same goes for you as for the killer experience.
---
In the games Saw 1 and Saw 2 Amanda has the black rope pig outfit so it is canon.
---
I think it burns it though, I can clearly remember me trying a great game in Lampkin but killer used a lerys (fking scratched mirror Myers) and I didn’t have the offering for the game after.
---
Actually it’s MaDe WiTh MeMaTiC
---
Keeps happening if I even get into a game, suddenly I’ll be disconnected in the middle. Also PS4.
---
I remember this being on the front page 5min ago.
---
How are those 30fps doing for ya?
---
&gt;Your argument based on nerfs in the same department stands on no basis. This is an asymmetric 4v1 survival.
---
Except how far is that asymmetry supposed to span. Is a group of 4 coordinated Surviviors supposed to be extremely weak against a killer? If so, then how much of a wreck will solo q be. Is a group of 4 coordinated Surviviors supposed to be stronger or even with a killer? If so, soloq would still be a nightmare and killers would complain that SWF is bullshit (more than they already do). This asymmetrical thing is a nightmare for balance. 
---
&gt;Nerfs for the same reason doesn’t effect both sides equally. Instant flashlights would give survivors much more time using the flashlight since it took less time to blind. 
---
Yes but the reason for nerfing things needs to not then be bc of something that's also applicable for the other side. If Flashlights are bs bc they offer no counterplay, then insta saw needs removed bc it also offers no counterplay. 
---
&gt;A nerf to instasaw would take more time to down a survivor meaning the survivor that was out of place has more time to get to a window, pallet, or locker.
---
Getting caught doesn't always mean you're out of place. It could just be that Billy did the ever skillful thing of holding down M2 and just so Happened to show up in your area and is now deciding to saw you down through windows bc yes that's a thing. 
---
&gt;Increasing the time for a down. At the time it would have been a huge blow to those killers, as it was so imbalance between killers and survivors. 
---
Fine, Imbalance them. But counterplay should always be a factor and the fact is that instasaw had no counterplay, hence it's nerf. One side should not be stronger than the other bc they don't offer counterplay, they should be stronger bc the player is better. 
---
&gt;You look at it all as if it is black and white. There is a lot of grey to balance, especially in an asymmetrical game. Survivors got a nerf to flashlights, killers got it elsewhere.
---
You seem to want this asymmetry to go extremely far, while I want it to not be as drastic
---
My experience has been fine for survivor, I’ve been getting good games, I guess I’m just lucky.
---
For killer it’s basically the same, just the survivors are sweatier than usual.
---
thx :)
---
Free psn user here but I ended buying a physical copy at Walmart for $30 after I got HOOKED
---
DBD needs custom games. Like where you can do anything.
---
And I gotta ask 
---
&gt;Quite a few killer perks have been completely gutted like decisive was.
---
What perks
---
that and he had prayer beads also
---
I can’t stress this enough!
---
I didn’t see that. I found it on Instagram and thought reddit would find it funny
---
Nope, i never tbag. He said post chat he did it for "swag", whatever that means
---
I play LF with Devour Hope so I don’t get trashtalked for camping, plus I love this perk
---
because the survivor will eventually bleed out
---
I don't know using exploits or bodyblocking survivors in a corner for 45 more minutes seem more toxic as you need to dc to avoid it.
---
LOOL hate when that happens
---
Would be fair but it's not gonna happen
---
My highest rank is 9, that’s if I don’t constantly disconnect from games
---
This gets on my nerves as well
---
We're going to get a lot of people that want to make current memes like Shirtless Myers and clown and because they're a big meme DBD sees the money that will flood in, eventually we're going to see a lot of cosmetics that are neon and not serious, while that is nice and all I really do think it breaks the tone of a suspenseful terrorizing killer when I see Susie with a bright pink Susie with glitter and rainbows (though not gonna lie I'd like to see her with a hood that has cat ears with worn out pastel colors or when I see someone (Dwight) who is repeatedly going through a stressful life threatening trials endlessly and decides to willingly wear bright orange and neon. That's not to say the brighter cosmetics aren't good. I would love to see the community create cosmetics of ummersively cosplaying as characters from other series like the Left 4 Dead survivors. I know that if they did make custom cosmetics a thing I would like to create prestiged versions of existing cosmetics or custom ones they have in the future.
---
Well if the survivors are better than him, obviously he was matched wrong, no?
---
Then either Bloodwarden them or wrap up &amp; move on to the next match? You aren't going to 4k every game before 5  gens pop.
---
I'm rank 12-13 and every one of the past 5 games I've joined killers facecamp lmao.
---
Preach. Spirit is jealous
---
American system.
---
Month/Day/Year

May 7th.
---
Oh Jesus Christ
---
On a casual level, no drawback.  On a competitive level, it hurts the killer meta and especially the Nurse meta due to how hard it is to course-correct for getting properly 360'ed
---
So as long as you aren't tryharding it, you're safe - Nurse is still plenty fun to play as on console, and not everyone on console knows how to 360 properly
---
Smh
---
All I could hear during this was the Pink Panther theme
---
I'm one of the people that doesn't like farming, but I'm also probably one of the least toxic people in this fanbase. I've also been playing since the dawn of man it feels like, so farming the old bot games as survivor (which used to take forever and was incredibly boring bc you didn't even have a killer to interact with beyond him endlessly swinging) really expended as much fun as I can have while farming. I understand why people farm during bloodpoint events, especially when there's 4+ bps, but I would really rather just play the game as is. I only have so much free time these days, it'd be nice to spend my time playing and not just going through the motion for some points
---
Keep in mind that Licensed characters still won't get cosmetics and copyright can shoot down other skin ideas.
---
Works fine thanks 👍🏻 thanks for asking, “Works”
---
NOED is bad. There's a reason you don't see killers in red ranks use it; there are better choices. I don't see them nerfing Adrenaline either, so I fail to see your poin here.
---
&gt;Reworks/guts decisive strike so hard they had to buff it to not be quite as garbage bc killer mains complained. 
---
Decisive strike was previously oppressive and unfun when it was ran by a SWF. It was the devs choice to nerf it as hard as they did, not "garbage bc killer mains"
---
Anyone with a brain agrees that carburetor needs to be made into a pink or purple addon. Instasaw billy is probably the easiest character in the game to play and do well with.
---
I have no idea why you bring up LF though. LF is in the dumpster tier along with Doctor and Trapper. I haven't seen anyone beyond rank 15 legitimately complain about LF.
---
Taking the game hostage is bannable, so I fail to see your argument here whatsoever.
---
That's a connection issue that has been addressed multiple times. It will be fixed with dedicated servers.
---
Again, LF is garbage and needs all the help he can get. I play killers without addons and LF is just as bad as Freddy and Legion currently. He literally needs to be inside your asshole before he starts holding m2; any good survivor will take advantage of this and just camp jungle gyms.
---
&gt;Adds Bloodlust.
---
Bloodlust was added as a band-aid because survivors were abusing infinites for over a year. Was it okay to you that every time I spawned on Ironworks in 2016-2017 I had to disconnect because I knew my game would be held hostage for a good 1-2 hours if I didn't let the survivors win? Don't even mention the entity blocker because if you actually play this game you know it's been bugged for months and doesn't do anything.
---
Survivors have received more nerfs than killers over the years because survivors needed more nerfs. If the game was reverted to the way it was in 2016 or in beta, everyone would probably quit. 
---
Survivors having sprintburst that let you go halfway across the map, on a 20 second cooldown, that recharged while you were using it.
---
We'll Make It worked with selfcare, so you could bodyblock killers into a corner and heal yourself faster than their swing would come back.
---
There were way more pallets and windows. Remember when shack had 2 windows? I'd imagine you don't.
---
I heard they have automatic bans for this stuff?
---
well,  that's why he's the hatch king
---
Sounds good! My PS name is BouyancyOfWater
---
Ironically I get tryhard survivors when I'm trying to play a farming killer, and tryhard killers when I'm playing survivor :/
---
OOoohhh... i've never seen nothing about him, so i honestly didn't know, thanks
---
I would assume it would work more like a treasure trade where you could trade 10 Yellow Flashlights for 1 Green Flashlight as an example.
---
I actually pirated the game before free weekend was a thing. Since I really liked the game. I bought it.
---
I got my PS4 Just now but I've been wanting to play this for a long time. Is it worth it 10$?
---
Mori in a lot of my games.  Again why now?  Do what you want i guess but again you are screwing yourself out of points too.
---
Imagine a mori taking a whole 40 seconds
---
Nah its just a squeaker. Orthography + logic fit that age group.
---
So now Myers scalps people.
---
I usually don't dc but after seeing so many Freddy's and LF doing camping I think why am I staying its just going to be the same.
---
it's almost like they're on opposing team or something
---
Nobody does they just get the media tool
---
Doc, Michael, and Trapper of late
---
Every fucking game yesterday.. Wow we have some low IQ killers.
---
Exactly. I'm not going to DC against a mori or camping or whatever but neither side benefits from this.
---
The only thing they are getting screwed out of is the 256k farm but even with a ebony mori and addons like scratched mirror you can still get 77k+ with bbq.
---
It’s not like a huge loss and still more than the regular 30k.
---
You don’t really have a compelling point :,)

What because he wants to win? If anyone's toxic it's survivors like you who want the killers to bow down to them and serve them grapes on a golden plate while they open the gates and beg for forgiveness.
---
*Raises a brow at this plight.* 
---
Well I think you could use this, as I was once in your shoes and now I really done give a fuck about peoples thoughts. 
---
https://youtu.be/FI5L1Pvfs3Y
---
G'luck and happy hunting my friend.
---
Killers get stuck in trees too if they aren't careful. Fucking BHVR.
---
I’m a David #3 kinda guy if I’m honest 🤷‍♂️ I was a big fan of the NOES franchise until BHVR made Freddy a laughing stock in game ☹️
---
He hacks, just a little bit
---
I hope you are joking now.
---
Too real
---
Yee
---
First day was nice. Most people seemed to play out a normal game, nothing too sweaty except for one Hag 'using up mori's before I prestige'. A few farm matches. Then the evil started trickling in. Last night after 3 Nurse games in a row spinning on the ground as a slug I had to walk away from the computer. I'm going to play as Killer today and see if it's any better. I'm sure there will still be griefing from Survivors, but it beats being a slug.
---
Any time you use good add-ons is a waste because everyone DCs. This is why both sides need a way to keep their add-ons. Because at this point, I can just cash in a black ward for 5000 points when people DC. It's ridiculous.
---
This reminded me of a game I had recently I was spirit I did the mori cancel twice and then let him have the gate just to let him know I let him live.
---
I am nothing maining either one. Bought the game in 2017’s humble bundle. Played one day and uninstalled. Didn’t like the performance on my old graphics card. Didn’t liked that there was no actual tutorial telling you how game works. Most of all didn’t liked toxic people in the game. Then last week friends decided to get the game. It is still fun when we play together and tell each other jokes. But when nobody is online and I want earn some BP quick it all the childish players are annoying.
---
can confirm i have no fucking clue what I'm doing and i love it
---
You need to be able to do gens for that, so still doesn't work when you're being chased. 
---
Let's just agree to disagree instead of swearing at me, okay? Thanks.
---
Very well stated comment. Kudos.
---
No amount of toxicity from survivors can reach the levels of basement camping and moris.
---
You can't do totems when you're being chased either, so....
---
One little curse word isn't going to kill you, but whatever.
---
The Entity favors him. 
---
inb4 Monto mysteriously disappears and is the next Killer in the game.
---
My apologies I thought you were talking about when it was released as a free ps plus game
---
On xbox it has been wholesome af
---
3 Michaels and a Dwight? I thought this video was going in a totally different direction.
---
He’s already jake
---
On my first couple games I literally couldn’t do gens, struggled with healing skill checks, had no perks, and literally ran into Hillbilly’s chainsaw. Everything scared me. Being toxic has become so normalized but there are still some wholesome cuties out there I promise
---
I spotted it and thought of trying to hide there in a game so that’s what I’m doing right now. Wish me luck
---
huh? where? much less dcs on my end cause people stay for more bp
---
Doesn't matter if you are dead on hook. By DC'ing you are denying the killer bloodpoints, and that little bit of time spent picking up and hooking you can be a game changer believe it or not. When you disconnect you don't destroy a hook which can also fuck your teammates over.
---
You were just so angry from your own mistake that you couldn't wait a few seconds to die on the hook, so you denied yourself and the killer bloodpoints, and may have fucked your team over. Congrats.
---
BBQ for Michael? Only for BP I guess.  
---
But Dying Light sucks and you get in the next bloodweb so obviously ur right
---
But your team mates could if they knew how many remained, so.... a counter would be an incentive to do totems.
---
Anyway, if you want to swear, sure, go ahead, hope it makes you feel better to swear at a random internet stranger :) I even upvoted it to make it even more of a victory! Now, go get them with your NOED, tiger!
---
Did you just made a second account to circle jerk yourself?
---
I played dbd since the free week trial on psn
---
The aura reading from MoM is also null and void since they can just 99% their heal and only heal up once the killer is close. No risk, no downside to MoM.
---
Correct. Balanced Landing measures your fall distance from when you leave a surface to when you next land on a surface. 
---
Vaulting "ends" right when can control your character again, but your character will fall a frame or two before that point.
---
Working with the other side is reportable.
---
I have advocated for an unranked mode for a long time now. Just make it work like KYF and let people try out perks they don't have to see if they want to buy a character. Also disable Splinters in regular Bloodwebs and enable them in Casual for people to test out Killers they don't have.
---
Rank 5ish Killer/Survivor (going between 5 and 7 depending on how shit my matches are.) I get Rank 2s and Rank 12s in my games: the current matchmaker is garbage.
---
Found the upset killer main.
---
The Trick r Treat kid aw uWu
---
I do this kinda stuff too. Idk why but when I let the survivor live it’s important to me they know I let them go lmao. Maybe I have some kinda issues mentally
---
Sorry youre having such a bad time :(
---
Cheesy post inc:
---
Since I play both sides regularly, I've greatly improved my own behaviour and dont do or say toxic things at all anymore. When I'm in a good mood, I write "gg" when I'm pissed, I just leave instantly. No salt. Sometimes I even take out the time to compliment people on their playstyles or apologize if I took too long to find the hatch or if someone had a shitty team/lots of dcs. 
---
I think just leading with good behaviour might convince more people to join the train, even if it's really hard to not be salty sometimes.
---
Hang in there friend!
---
It’s the same shit that happens every event. Killers will bring moris and all kinds of sweaty addons while saying it’s for “toxic swf” when in reality survivors are just trying to earn BPs and don’t care.
---
I wasn't salty about you cursing at me, I just said it would be better for both of us to agree to disagree *instead* of swearing, but apparently you are terrible at letting things go, otherwise you would've actually agreed to disagree. 
---
Why would I get salty over a person I don't know on Reddit, really? Don't pat yourself on the back too hard, honey, you're not *that* important.
---
This is fucking hilarious lol
---
So you've never taken part in a bloodhunt.
---
Maybe if Survivors had better perks... Even Solidarity could be a good perk but it doesn't work with medkits and We'll make it, and it only gives 50%. They could just buffed it to 80/85/90% just to avoid instaheal and I would have been used it.
---
It's making fun of the people who get triggered and start shit-talking people for farming. I will admit that I also don't enjoy farming that much and don't farm outside of double BP events. But if the Killer is being friendly I have no reason *not* to get Bloodpoints, and I'm not going to yell at people for playing the game the way they want to.
---
Apparently I am very important, since you're this salty. And yeah, you started getting salty after the curseword. Plus, speaking of letting things go, you've been harping on me this whole time.....
---
Yes! Thank you! I knew I couldnt be alone with that feeling.
---
I have. I don’t remember it being this bad is the point.
---
You know what's funny? These kind of posts pop up every so often in like every game subreddit I'm subscribed to.
---
Have you considered the game has nothing to do with it? It's just a thing that exists. At varying levels between games sure, but exists nonetheless.
---
This does nothing to people who can actually hit great skillchecks, though.
---
Just a little, little bit
---
Consistency is key
---
Yeah I’ll never understand of bringing moris in BP events other than to be spiteful.
---
Okay, apparently you know me better than I know myself. I'm so saltyyyy, Frdjgejalek on Reddit said so! Ready to let it go now? Or do you still need to downvote all of my comments?
---
Are you the same guy who drops like 8 pallets, considers himself a looping god, and blames his teammates when he goes down because "they used all the pallets"?
---
the picture is really cute. but the title...
---
Well, compare that to how it is now in the sense that it does nothing to *everyone*
---
I don't need to know you better than you know yourself. It's extremely obvious in how you're acting.
---
Dwight is what?
---
They should either fix the hitboxes or the animations to make hits not look like bullshit. I heard the devs mention they would fix the hitboxes after the dedicated servers go live though, so that’s nice.
---
Drinking and playing DBD with friends
---
&gt; You misunderstood me, I'm not saying "look for a weaker survivor", I meant "look for a survivor in a weaker area". If the survivor is running towards a strong structure, they will be harder to get than someone working on a gen between 2 L and T walls. It's much easier to get a hit in there. 
---
Ok, I misunderstood, but what you described is basic chasing 101. Choosing to continue this chase is the same overextending I was talking about earlier. I already adressed this, whats your point?: " If killer messes up (overextends a chase, tries a mindgame that doesn't work, can't find anyone fast enough etc..) then its already game over. "
---
&gt; But I am not saying chase them for a long time till they completely run out of pallets, make them use something and then switch targets if you don't think you can catch them. 
---
Okay but what are you trying to say? All this is basic killer 101, what does it have to do with this discussion? My point is that even if killer does all that correctly, he still has less room for fuckups. Assuming the killer is already playing correctly and doing the things you say, he still has less room to mess up.
---
&gt; And good killers don't waste time either? 
---
Since killer is basically a time manager, then yeah, not wasting time is what makes killer good.
---
&gt; No that's not how it works, if you know what you're doing as killer you won't go tunnel vision. You can absolutely multitask chasing someone and paying attention to what is happening on the map. 
---
I don't think you understand what I'm saying. What I said is for the scenario where killer plays correctly, doesn't tunnel vision, multitask and pay attention to map. I wrote GOOD killer in caps just to avoid this very response of your, and yet somehow you managed to misread it. The killer being GOOD already means he is doing these things you said he should do, thats why he is good. Please try to keep up. I suggest you answer again because this answer is quite irrelevant.. I don't want to talk how killer should play, this is already assumed in this discussion that killer is playing correctly, do you understand?
---
&gt; There are several survivors and one killer, so it stands to reason that you have to get multiple of the survivors. If all it took is downing one person to win, it wouldn't be much of a 4v1 would it? 
---
Thanks for making my point for me. If those 4 work together they have more potential than a single killer against them.
---
It needs to do something to everyone, not just people who aren't that skilled.
---
Just play toxic but do it in a way that benefits you. Camping all game, for example, is toxic but it doesn't benefit you. Sometimes if the game really has pissed me off, I play Nurse with add ons and NOED.
---
Okay, sure whatever, I guess. 
---
Apparently you are not ready to let it go. That's sad. So I guess I'll be the bigger person and do so myself. I respect your opinion on not agreeing with mine, good luck out there in the fog.
---
Good job on backing out of the conversation. Good day, finally.
---
Well yes but they are completely unnecessary so the two kind of go hand in hand
---
Oops, it autocorrected.
---
You ruin the game for everyone.
---
Like I said: I'll be the bigger person... thanks for proving my point.
---
Right? That’s what I would do. I don’t know what you’re going to do as killer, I’m not a mind reader.
---
I don't even understand how camping is a fun thing to do.
---
You actually undermined your own point since you came back, lmao.
---
A little bit of Tina’s what I need
---
Voice chat still gives you free Bond, Kindred and far greater co-ordination.
---
How do Killers compete with that?
---
*yessir*
---
That's nothing compared to his key streak that one time.
---
There was one match he played with a few other people in which he found 4 keys, three of which were the ultra rare skeleton keys. Then he found ANOTHER 2 more skeleton keys in the next match.
---
&lt;3
---
I'm not the one who said I was going to leave to prove a point, so uhhh, no.
---
And really, all this got started because you took offense with one curse word, which wasn't even directed at *you* personally, and then ironically you come back with (among other things) calling me an ass later. Ok, dude.
---
Depends really like always, sometimes you get ruin being like a lighthouse in a middle of map, sometimes it is not found entire game. Tho as a survivor main, I pretty much now know all the good spots, where totem can spawn in map. It's just takes time to look through all of them.
---
When the game first launched, there was no "Survive With Friends" mode.
---
The devs didn't want Survivors talking to each other.
---
Problem is, they never *really* addressed the issue since introducing SWF.
---
Very nice :) you should get a drawing tablet if youre planning on improving your skills though, id recommend a Wacom intuos!
---
you're literally just describing the people i'm against, i don't get what your point is.
---
i don't drop pallets until i've looped them as much as possible, if the pallet doesn't need to be dropped i move to another loop. i don't use god pallet until endgame, if i find myself in a position where i need to drop god pallet early, i don't deserve the god pallet.
---
Wish there were more people like you
---
Nah, I'd want to cuddle it too much. And it doesn't have eyes, how would it be stunned by flashlight?
---
Alright, I respect that. I apologize for what I said. I didn't take offense in the swearing though, just that it wasn't necessary since we were talking about a game. You calling me salty annoyed me, so I clapped back. Sorry for that. Too bad you still choose to be hostile despite my apology, but can't win 'em all I guess :)
---
Im his supply for fragrant tufts of hair :(
---
I miss that feeling
---
I get the "SWF means we can coordinate BPS", but no need to be a total dick with every shitty maneuver you can do against the killer. Seriously, the level of griefing.
---
He follows the triple S procedure:
---
Stalks
---
Slays
---
Snatches
---
Two OS payments, since the free upgrade version of Windows 10 was abysmal.
---
While a PS+ sub is more expensive, you get free games every month and the system itself is significantly cheaper
---
The monster
---
What rank are you playing at?
---
I KNOW doesnt he know who I AM 
---
Why couldnt he go steal Jake's hair
---
Well, to be honest, it takes a special kind of asshole to bring Mori's, tunnel, and facecamp during a double BP event.   But hey, I'm not your dad, I ain't telling you how to play,  just pointing out why everyone dodges you with MLGA and DCs against you.
---
I saw, he’s clearly a bot and hacking the numbers
---
You could say the same for the Killers
---
Pls remove the autoaim/lockon dat the killers have
---
A PS4 Pro-equivalent PC will set you back an extra £200 (more if you were to buy all the games you get with PS+). It would take over 3 years for the PC to pay for itself.
---
I don't mind the Killers killing me but at least let me get some bloodpoints so the match didn't feel like a waste.
---
you don't really need spine chill, just look behind you or around you, its pretty easy.
---
The way I see it, it's just a way to support the game. I bought cosmetics once and felt silly for doing so until I figured I spend so many hours playing this game and I got it free with PS Plus ... I can give them something back.
---
I'm played in dbd before launch. From alpha. I waited players 30-40 minutes sometimes
---
Ps4? I wrote a post yesterday about a ps4 nurse destroying my team on the asylum map. I got out hatch. Nurse was all black. If it was you then your blinks were great.
---
that would be a good idea. It rewards reaction time and punishes missed checks. pretty good actually
---
Bringing DS into a mori game FeelsBadMan
---
No. It’s a radar system for killers, regardless of position or movement. They could be walking towards you 20 metres away, or be standing on your head and it would still fire up.
---
How do you know its mr
---
This
---
she’s flat 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
It can still happen if the minimum number of pallets on a map requirement has not been met.
---
Yeah, I got it for free, so me buying cosmetics is the least I can do to pay the devs something for the game. Even if the prices are a little over.
---
Report her lol, there's no way that claudette avoided all those hits like that.
---
Yes!!  I've been stuck too many times on them.  
---
90% of the time the killer understands, and even at that I'd let them get the free hook just for freeing me, but most of the time they just drop me after getting a few free hits.
---
Was this you? https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bkba6y/to_the_ps4_nurse_who_i_now_envy_i_watched_you/
---
This is very interesting on different levels.  
---
* Most PS4 Players tend to play alone. Never played on console, is it harder to play with friends on PS4?
---
* The win rate is not increasing a lot at SWF. Per friend playing you gain around 3% higher survival rate.
---
* Survivors on PC win at higher ranks a lot more games than Survivors on Console. The average game length also goes down on PC with rank, meaning that high rank survivors on PC are much better at gen rushing.  
---
* Hillybilly is top tier on all platforms.
---
I know, I'm saying at least allow SOME bloodpoints. Matches that end too fast are boring anyways.
---
I don't think there are many public Canadian schools that use a school uniform
---
No she was playing along. There was a disconnect so we decided to have a little bit of fun as you can see lol.
---
Tenacity and resilience to hide from the killer after getting downed from a vault hit.
---
What else are they supposed to do? DC? Teabag?
---
Have you even seen how many games actually have a 4 man SWF?
---
The best offerings during the blood hunt are the Bloody party streamer or the Escape cake/Survivor Pudding.
---
Both offerings increase your bp gain by 100%, the BPS just increases it for all players &amp; can stack with other players BPS. 
---
Survivor pudding allows you to get a 100% bonus to all bp gains. This is the best personal offering for bp.
---
The other Offerings increase only specific categories bp gains which makes them much less useless. The hollow shell, for example, increases all bp gains by 25% making it 1/4 as effective as a survivor pudding.
---
At least that partially explains recording with your phone in portrait mode.
---
Thanks for info good to know
---
Hey lord of plebs i think i have you as a friend on steam what a small world
---
You bring up some good points, but saying it has the highest skillcap in the game is just silly, a perk without activation cannot have a skillcap, just more skilled users. It does not take skill to use, unlike exhaustion perks, specifically dead hard, which is without a doubt the perk with the highest skill cap as it is the ONLY good perk thay can be activated by button press (diversion is the only other one but just doesn't have the same impact.)
---
No, why would I?
---
One of Hillbilly’s weapons is a shotgun. Shotgun billy refers to hillbillies beating you upside the head with muskets
---
JP is shorthand for Japanese.
---
Some people just have nothing better to do with their life.
---
the mental gymnastics these reddit killers go through is ridiculous. how about its...just an asshole who plays killer?
---
Ok, I’ll have to look into that when I get the chance thanks.
---
I dunno, this would work if it was just for hex totems *or* if the cleansing time was shorter so the setback wouldn't be so devastating when you miss a skillcheck when you've almost finished.
---
"Use traps so we can't loop you."
---
HELLO? THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY HAG?????

Was this arround midday yesterday ?

Because Moris are fun and it's not always about min maxing points, if I'm feeling bloodthirsty and wanna see some gory shit, imma go for a mori, itd about fun and not grinding points man.

American Horror Story: Coven
---
Same as Reddit name.
---
Pc, actually. I should put that in an edit.
---
I'd have turned it around on them and acted oblivious, "yay for time being moried by spirit! Her's takes a little longer than some of the others tho :/"
---
'Working *with* the killer' is the wording.
---
Nah man, you found the 8 or 9 survivor mains that are like "Nah... Im not toxic"
---
I play on ps4 as a killer and as an survivor i have o friends who play this. My gt is Demented_RezMutt
---
Nurse kill 40% on console Lmao sounds about right.
---
Sadly I'm on PC- just had to add that in my edit.
---
Mine's just an endless "searching for game".
---
I got this game last year and I haven't play it, is it worth the time?
---
I watched that video multiple times and it’s clear to me he is beyond what even the butt kissing fog whisperers could ever hope for! He is truly in the entity’s favor and can hear more than it’s whisper.
---
Fair enough!
---
In my evil incarnate achievement, the last Claudette kept vaulting at perfect times and gave me a twenty minute fight. 
---
But she was cool when I won no dc or salt.
---
You should get BP's for being in the killer field of view will on hook, should cut down on d/cing or suicideing survivers.
---
Why is Claudette wearing prayer beads?
---
Time? Perhaps. But the true question is, is it worth your *sanity*? And no one can answer that for you.
---
&gt;lol so sweaty XD
---
-Iridescent Head, Infantry Belt, Ebony Mori Huntress when I put the "you cheated not only the game but yourself" shitpost in post-game chat.
---
Same. I wouldn't mind the bad matches so much if it didn't take so long to get into a new match.
---
A little bit of Rita is what I see
---
Im a free user but i have bought a ton of dlc and ingame cash. So i guess i already paid for it in some way
---
It's not a good idea to camp, because then you're getting one kill and that's it. However, tunneling is very useful. Each survivor you kill gives you 0.25 seconds more time for every second that passes, and of course. Your job is to kill survivors.
---
When!? Shit all I get is try hard Myers left and right. Console killers love Myers and Bubba it seems.
---
EXACTLY! Devs won't do anything about camping and tunneling tho.
---
Like you never have time to do a gen because of constantly unhooking.  Its not boring. It was fun as hell to try to get her to miss hits. A few times for sure I thought I was safe and boom blink hit plus healing is hard because nurses calling. If I was not running premeditation I would have not known i was about to be hit.  Team was dropping so fast that its a struggle.
---
The KYF glitch to for multiple killers is not the same as the exploit that lets you queue into a survivor spot as a killer.
---
well premonition tells you what direction the killer is coming from so that is why people run when the sound goes off. I will always think premonition is better until spine chill gives an auditory warning
---
Absolutely.  Game was the most fun i had in dbd this year.
---
Slow down the game J U S T A L I L B I T
---
This is hilarious, and never actually noticed our boy Zepp was still there
---
Cool I added you
---
Hex ruin slows down the game, just a liiiiiitle bit
---
Depends on your sanity,if you dont plan to get 3k hours in less than 1 year,you good
---
I really wish they would add a daily login bonus that would eventually give you Auric Cells. Maybe 100 per week? “But they’ll never make money doing that!” Yes, they will. First, the person who is willing to wait three months to purchase a skin is *never* going to actually pay money for it. Second, study shows this actually makes the average person more likely to spend money. Gives them a taste. Gets them used to buying. They’ll get halfway to that skin they want and say, “Well, it’s only five bucks now. I’m still saving money.”
---
Nope  
---
It means within the range at all what so ever, and looking in your direction, even through walls

Quit crying survivor main
---
Oh okay
---
Let's be honest tho, most common thing u find in a locker is a claudette..
---
Lol I know the 360 movement on controller and I still can’t execute it :/
---
10, and yeah i had no issues at 11+
---
Ps4?
---
Yes, this is bad but still not nearly as bad as most survivors who DC after getting down one time in the middle of the game.
---
yeah
---
Empathy, Spine Chill, Alert, Dark Sense. See where the killer is at all times.
---
Yup, all day yesterday it was back to back games now I’m just sitting in a lobby scrolling the sun and commenting
---
Please Get this hatred out of my sight
---
I wouldn't say absolutely overpriced, if it is to much money don't buy them. For me money isn't an issue and I would rather pay for something then pay for it. But when it comes to cosmetics I don't have an opinion about it. DLC's make sense why they are priced lower as they offer new content and you don't want to put that content behind a big pay wall. But cosmetics are just for fun, and if 10 dollars is to much don't buy it. Or buy the parts you want from it.
---
I’m *broken*
---
yeah, i have the same issues as survivor too
---
Do you wanna do kill your friends ?
---
Sure it matters. But it also matters that it does happen at all. Like getting 2 killers in your game. What kind of argument is based of the premise that "well it doesnt happen a lot" so its ok. No. You have to account for the times that it does happen. A good nurse DOES break the game. The people that argue, well you need skill to break the game so its ok, have the mental capacity of a grape. Thats not the formulation of balance. When you say not everyone runs MoM so its not realistic to say that 4 people will have it, thus you dont have 4 hits is pandering. The fact you can have a game where all 4 people have it, was the original argument. Stop back peddling, stop arguing the numbers. The whole point of this discussion was that if 4 people bring it, thats 4 times the killer has to deal with it. Its a 1v4 game. 4 perks can and do show up in stacks all the time. Stop talking about the game in a vacuum likes its a 1v1.
---
When a killer deliberately stands near a hooked survivor, waiting for a save, and IGNORES any attempt at distraction. They just wanna keep the one hooked person, and won’t even chase other survivors.
---
Good thing you were already at the gates. What a garbage killer.
---
Those are not punishments. Those are anti-camp perks. Those wouldn’t have worked in this situation since his chainsaw can down everyone who gets too close. 
---
Punishments for DC are temp bans, camping should be harsh as well. Especially so damn early in the game.
---
Yes. We like to make fun of it but in reality it’s fun as fuck. We wouldn’t all be playing for hours at a time if that weren’t the case.
---
He turns into a white walker dog
---
I bought it on release, finally started playing and ide say it was fun until Ashley William's came out.
---
Every game is stacking perks to take another hit, dead hard, mettle, borrowed time, decisive strike it becomes a chore and worse if it's a group. As killer without hex ruin, and bad bbq chili rng, your basically fucked. Killing 3 survivors isn't even enough for a pip, and 90% of would be quad kills ends because the last person camps the hatch. Playing survivor is rewarding and fun when you outsmart the killer, but playing killer is stressful. 
---
Didn't even get into player hosted servers which make every game a roulette of decent hit reg.
---
Yup. I had a match last night where I was the only one to burn a BPS (which is fine, it's whatever), we load in, 1 person insta DC's. Me and David start working on a gen, spirit comes up and I attempt to point at the Gen to indicate I'd like to farm (if not I was gonna take my hook and play the game normally) which david is standing behind at the pallet loop, and David thinks I'm ratting him out. I get hooked immediately by the Spirit and David lets me die by just pointing at me and t-bagging. Everyone got like 5k BP that match because some ass-hole thought I was ratting him out and the Spirit didn't want to farm (which is fine, she didn't have to but because I died in the first minute it was a 2 man game with 5 gens). I was the only one who brought a BPS but ya, i'm sandbagging you ? Ok, sure bud. 
---
This was just 1 of the games I played where it was just bad all around. I'd say I had maybe 3 regular games, 2 farming games, and the rest were face campers or tunnelers and shit like that out of like 30 games. It's just great. s/
---
One of the pallets is broken. No need to thank me.
---
Smack a generator. Do dumb things, use your power inefficiently.
---
Let him have hatch
---
Just no
---
Who remembers not having emblems?
---
Jane can just use Peach Bomber or Kitana Booty Bash and Joey is done for.
---
If you would have asked me a week ago I would've said no, but this week has felt pretty dead. I want to say it's probably because people or doing finals or graduation this week in my area. (May not be the case everywhere)
---
You can’t see his right hand.*checkmate*
---
And the meaning is: Working with the killer in a way that causes harm to other survivors.
---
I mean I think this is pretty funny.
---
And you can't remove SWF because the player base would plummet. The game would die overnight. I enjoy playing killer, but I would absolutely never touch this game again if I couldn't play it with friends at lease sometimes.
---
You mean 5th
---
It works best with clown's mori
---
Yeah hopefully the next update fixes it
---
Vision on those walls is much more important for survivors as they are the one in charge of the chase. The killer can only try and counter when they vault but a good survivor waits until the last minute to vault.
---
 Yeah probably, I didn't think about that
---
Nurse has a good one. It is from her lore and she blinks in it. Pig on the other hand is the biggest dissapointment ever.
---
Thank you this helps a ton, also if you dont mind me bothering you, why are people so toxic when you kill them, and you're not being toxic. Or is that the community.
---
I feel like you fell for it
---
If that was your best thought “ever” I worry for your future
---
The exact same, everything has also gotten worse since the changes to the rank/pipping system and the dc issues so it's a little more noticeable in this event.
---
I would like to see her add-ons looks at but they aren't useless.
---
And her mori is fine.
---
Nurses mori is really loud and can kinda give away position
---
It’s no bother at all. That’s probably just the human’s natural competitive side coming to light. Not many people like to lose, and not many people who play the game are super mature. 
---
Also, sometimes they take it out on the killer, when the blame should really fall to incompetent/inexperienced teammates or themselves.
---
Yeah, pretty much all of Kate's perks are useless.
---
Windows of opportunity? You figure that stuff by the time you're rank 13.
---
Boil over? Useless, just as slow as without it.
---
No scratch marks after rushing a window? Killer already gets notification and sees where you're going, and it's only for 3 sec, not much help. Experienced players will know you're nearby if they don't see scratch marks after 3 sec.
---
Etc.
---
It's easy to fix those by buffing those perks, like give boil over higher increase to wiggle, allow at max perk level for Windows of opportunity to be able to see all the pallets/windows in the map, though that perk is still gonna be useless to experienced players.
---
That happend to me except with feng min
---
Thank you, you have been a Godsend.
---
This is should've been what the Legion should've been like...
---
Same af
---
It would look silly, he’d have to hook them up to the pulley, then crank the pulley several feet in the air, and force them onto the meat hook, then disconnect the pulley.  All in 2 seconds.  Riiight.
---
There's good balance to hex ruin, just make it like a 50 sec runtime, newbie players aren't that self-aware about that hex, and given that in ranks 15-20 play strangers, no one's actively looking for a hex totem to destroy.
---
With pros, it's simple, by that 50 sec time they likely already find it and destroy.
---
So 50sec runtime for hex ruin seems good.
---
Just hit them with a gg right away and stop reading after. Check your BP and dip. You dont owe them anything
---
Full plag lore [ Here ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
Yeah worst feeling ever xD
---
Ahem. Object of Obsession. Ahem
---
Lucky, I get this toxic stuff DAILY
---
Playing the way you are— willingly giving them some room out of not wanting to camp or tunnel is respectable and understandable! It just shows that you genuinely want to improve and get kills without playing like an asshole. Camping/tunneling is also easily punishable so you understand that which already makes you a decent killer. Might I recommend Make Your Choice- a pig perk that punishes altruism and rewards you for not camping and tunneling off hook— MYC makes it so if youre 30-something meters away from the hook the unhooker is exposed for the next 60 seconds. This leads to two things: They go full immersion and do nothing to progress the game or you find them and get a free down. Pig is a dlc killer that you have to buy with money but if you get lucky itll show up in the shrine. Wish you the best of luck on your games and I hope things get better for you :D
---
Can't right now. Letting my gf play. I will accept your request and def soon I will.
---
Same tbh
---
the mentality in this game is one side versus another. one side will always think the other is wrong and keep at it :/ when players are surprised to see a player who isn’t a complete ass, that’s when you know how bad the whole situation is.
---
Matches have been incredibly quick for me as survivor during the event, if you're trying killer is gonna take a while
---
Yes pls gief me ur i.d
---
I completely agree killer is allowed to do whatever they want. Doesn't mean they aren't an asshole if they camp or tunnel but still completely valid
---
 Gotta comment before I never can Neat.
---
That's what you get for running Urban
---
Oddly enough I actually play better. Lmao!
---
I just bought the spirit last night. In my opinion she’s a easier nurse and when you’re able to use her right she’s very fun to play. (sneaking up on people doing gens and grabbing them off is the most satisfying thing ever)
---
You think that’s toxic? Look at [ This ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
you're mistaking it with urban evasion
---
Cool bro whenever :)
---
 There’s an issue on XB1 where when a survivor gets taken off the hook their look gets inverted and it’s really off putting to some that don’t play regularly with look inversion
---
Not to mention the faces, from women only Kate, Claudette and then Meg look somewhat decent, the rest are just not so realistic.
---
well I feel lije you need to play Pig more.
---
So is it ok if killers were to DC just as often when survivors teabag and BM them?
---
&gt; some games facilitate that easier than others
---
Well that is exactly it. In most games I played for long I can point my finger towards something and say "this is why toxicity exist in the game" like in RB6 it's the friendly fire that enables people to kill their own teammates and in Rocket League it's for example the non-existence of proper matchmaking so noobs get put together with experienced players that will insult the newbies because they understanbly don't know how to play yet.
---
It really be like that 😔
---
Ebony moris everywhere. Of course they say it's for achievement...
---
thanks!
---
*clown’s
---
Teachables be like:
---
It’s awesome man. I love the style. Very clever.
---
once it opened my only thought was "how could this happen to me I've made my mistakes got nowhere to run."
---
Okay then, uhhh, bodyblocking and slugging? among other things.
---
It's gotta be the rank, everyone should be ranking up at this point and I'm having no issues getting games at purple rank
---
Trapper.
---
Any jabroni can lay down a couple traps, but taking a Trapper to red ranks an not get dunked on is a feat in itself.
---
Omae Wa Mou Jakeiru!
---
As someone who usually plays killer: Yes please. If I see someone has used a BPS I'll give everyone a chance to get some points. Please return the favour! I've had so many games where I've stood next to gens and let the survivors finish them. only for them to run straight out of the gate.
---
I had a Myers that camped me and my hubby. He ended the game just under 10k. He camped us both at separate times so the other survivors were able to do the gen that was left and get out. He didn't have any point adding perks and brought a survivor pudding.
---
thank you :) when i see MYC come up I will buy it anyway. I already got surveillance this week so I'll have the full set if MYC comes into the shrine.
---
Don’t like that
---
Make sure you report this
---
I have over 1500 hours in DBD and have at least 800 of those hours are dedicated to just The Pig, at Rank 1. I think I have a pretty informed opinion on her. But no sure, the person who openly says they don't play The Pig much is definitely right! /s
---
I heard she's around mid-low tier but I think she's fun to play. The nerf is that if you put a trap on a survivor AFTER the exit gates are powered, the trap won't work.
---
You need it on maps like The Game or Let's Memorials Institute
---
Sounds stupid, what other killers are fun?
---
This is such a cute and funny video!! I love it!
---
Well that's depressing
---
Is this just a PC problem or a high rank problem? Coming from Xbox
---
Well I only have two dlc killers so I cant really say much but I have the spirit and shes kinda fun but you need to practice to play her. I think others can give better info on that than me though
---
so tru cause i wish to play but i haven't been able to have fun as everyone is so goddamn toxic
---
Played a Baby Leatherface with two streamers played last night.  This motherfucker was literally spam holding his chainsaw chasing you around the pallet.  He ragequit like a little bitch when he couldn't get me for some unknown reason "by no fault of his own"...
---
Adrenaline and Borrowed Time don't need nerfs, wtf? Adrenaline only works if you reach the end and Borrowed Time BY NOT TUNNELING.
---
Killer camps me, I depip.
---
Killer tunnels/camps someone else, I depip.
---
Killer sweats with ebony mori, I depip.
---
Killer is so bad they never hook anyone, I depip maybe safety.
---
Literally if you do TOO good, or the killer does TOO bad you will never pip. Wtf kind of system is this where I feel punished in any match I perform well in just as much as those I do poorly in.
---
He looks possessed by a Soul from The Host (Stephenie Meyer's book)
---
Who said I don't play Pig much? And I have basically the same amount of time in Pig so back off before you assume stuff.
---
Did you hid your perks on purpose? I'm gonna assume you run Ruin, NOED, Mangled Butcher and BBQ and Chili
---
Doctor I think is one of the hardest killers to really master. I mean, anyone can play doc and do well with him. But to actually wreck a team by efficiently using his stun to close off loops/windows is incredibly hard to do. IMO if you can master this ability, you can bring Doc up to upper mid tier. It’s such a brief window and f opportunity and requires good aim, prediction and timing.
---
Second would have to be spirit. I find her to be the hardest killer to play and learn. At first I thought Nurse was hard, but in comparison to Spirit it’s nothing. You have to be really good at reading survivor language to annihilate with her.
---
Next would be Billy. Like anyone can chase and M2 but to master flicks and all that tricky chainsaw shit takes a ton of practice and knowledge of loops.
---
they played the game?
---
You can't get banned for trying out exploits or glitches in KYF. You're not gaining any advantage in ranked/it's among friends, so you're all good.
---
farming's bannable
---
That looks horrifying
---
I think it's a different scenario camping after all gens are powered and gates are open. I understand that especially if you haven't had a kill or even a hook yet. In most other situations it is just boring and you aren't improving your gameplay (or anyone else's for that matter) by doing it. You are making the survivors gen rush and everyone is loosing out on all the aspects of earning bloodpoints.
---
All you gotta do is ignore them. If you see a survivor t bagging, or BMing, camp them, tunnel them and make it your personal goal to see how mad and triggered they can get. They more salty those low-lifes get, the more you win your own game. Just make sure to be nice and not camp and tunnel until you know for sure that that survivor is BMing(bad mannering).
---
Good killers don't have to tunnel to achieve the same end result.
---
A little bit of you makes me your man
---
Cypress moris should be like that
---
Despite the trend to use Bloody Party Streamer and Escape Cake/Survivor Pudding offerings during Bloodhunt events, the generic Bloodpoint add-ons are actually more valuable to use during these.
---
The Bloodhunt doubles the BP you receive after the game. The BPS/Cake/Pudding offerings do the same, but they stack additively, not multiplicatively. So say you got 20k BP total. The event modifier makes that 40k. A double-BP offering makes it 60k, not 80. Using these offerings during these events has no innate benefit, they give you the same amount of extra BP they always do. The generic BP offerings on the other hand increase the BP you make in the point categories, increasing the total BP you get and thereby increasing the amount of BP you get extra from the event modifier.
---
With that said, during these events, players are more likely to play in ways that yield more BP, or even outright work together to farm BP, and so using double-BP offerings can be worth it, since you are not as likely to have such games outside of the events.
---
It not just killers it survivors to. Double BP brings back a lot of people who don't play regularly. And most of them are horrible people.
---
if EVERY killer has such a high ping, maybe, just maybe, you should check your connection
---
Some people find it fun when they spread negativity. Usually they are full of it themselves. People will do what they want, they don’t care how the other person feels - especially not in anonymous games.
---
Username?
---
I run bbq ruin shadowborn and nurses, I think that noed should be removed since it’s a perk that rewards players for doing bad.
---
Depends on what you find fun. The spirit is really fun to mind game with, the clown is really fun to herd around survivors, Michael is fun to jumpscare with, plague vomits on people, legion goes fast to chain attacks, leatherface is a billy that is better at basement builds, freddy is invisible until they're put in dreamstate (which is why he's weak because you can only hit them in dreamstate)
---
As for the pig, she crouches around for ambushes and has traps to either slow the game down or kill survivors.
---
The pig's nerf is that traps won't work until a gen is done, so after the last gen traps are useless.
---
There are toxic players on both side.
---
The point of the killer is to kill you, it's up to you if you see them trying to kill you as toxic or hateful.
---
Nurse is actually the only character I'll accept Ruin on , because she is usually incredibly bad and needs more time to kill everyone 
---
That said, I run Small Game to counter Ruin because every killer uses it lately
---
Once you get to red rank if you don’t run ruin on any killer except for maybe nurse and billy you’ll lose the game.
---
That being said the survivors have to be potatoes if they don’t win when ye don’t have ruin
---
A bit OP. It’s like giving all players bond towards you.
---
It depends. if you have BBQ and chili, you can continuously hook survivors  and they are pressured to unhook and heal
---
Two minutes to get out once the gates open (slows down if a survivor is downed or hooked)
---
Watching their yellow aura asses butt dancing at the exit gate while you dyin
---
Shit, for real? Well the game is awesome so far. I am about 7 to 8 hours in.
---
Jesus Christ.
---
Omg is that happening?! I am behind on news.
---
Tbagging and BM does absolutely nothing to hinder the killers game, whereas hard camping or face camping like the picture above definitely ruins the game for the hooked survivor. An incredibly harsh punishment for being purchased ONCE in the entire game. 
---
Ate you actually arguing killers should get to DC if they get tilted? Again, stark difference between camping and tbagging.
---
That’s very wrong bbq can be very easily countered in many ways once again he survivors have to be potatoes to let you snowball with bbq the main use for it at good ranks is for bp’s
---
Good to know
---
*laughs in Enduring/Spirit Fury*
---
You can always wiggle her... you know...
---
When the new endgame update comes out yes (most likely on the 7th but maybe the week after latest)
---
Its not a bug. If the pallets there are less than minimum, the game adds double pallets.
---
I'll keep it in mind.
---
Mine is fine.
---
I'd be cheering honestly. Amazing how ranking up makes the games feel that much more worse.
---
these kind of matches are why i switch to killer and farm like crazy afterwards :( makes me feel better to make sure people have a nice game.
---
As for pressured to unhook and heal , why is that ? The survivors don’t have to waste hook state just because you have bbq.
---
I wouldn't mind it if they have much more shards and gave us an easier way to unlock perks.
---
I'll give it a go after I'm done with Nier Automata
---
Not really, it’s a marker, not a tracker. You can leave the marked area. You can’t make an OP argument for something that already exists in the game. In fact, if four survivors bring maple with this add on into a game, that have all the advantages I mentions, plus 4 full perk spots, AND the beacon is spammable. 
---
That’s why there’s a cooldown on the perk idea.
---
I'm gonna try it.
---
fuuuck wtf?! That sucks completely.
---
Good bro youll love it I think
---
To be fair he was running plunderers and that perk is OP. The amount of great items you find with that perk is astonishing.
---
lmao
---
I would watch the official endgame video on dbds YouTube page (or any social media)
---
It's not as bad as it sounds, it's preventing alot of things like hatch standoffs and survivors drawing out the game
---
LOL, this
---
interesting, didn't know that! when exactly did they add swf?
---
Going to search now, thank you!
---
For how long you've been playing nurse?
---
My entire life i've seen people trying to play nurse but only once or twice they actually managrd to destroy me and my teammates
---
No problem!
---
I was going to say,  surely this is the same as using traps as a trapper? Or mind gaming with the spirit?   Ducking low under cover as the pig?   
---
What a trash talking little pleb.   😂
---
You... You went down? You medium vaulted that window and got hit? You made a bad play. The mistake after that was DC'ing.
---
uhhh....it aint exclusive to this event. 
---
If the killer ever brings a mori into a game I always check their profile. You know what the most common thing I see is for killer profiles? Steam profile picture is hitler and swastikas all over their profile. 
---
Theres a lot of killer mains that are just completely fucked in the head.
---
No, just Monika
---
Press the back button; it’s in settings. It inverts the look when you press it
---
Well it’s certainly a PC issue as of recently. The Mid Chapter patch can’t come soon enough. As far as people rage DCing that could be rank related but the game crashing constantly and random kicking people out mid match isn’t.
---
I was playing spirit the other day. Had a strong 3k. In chase with last person, 1 gen done. Got stuck in a pallet. They did every gen in my face.
---
That could replace virtually all of the other perks.
---
My experience as a killer has been P3s purposefully deranking to grief low rank killers and troll baby survivors, I hope you have better luck :/
---
The true crime here is using Stake Out instead of Adrenaline
---
Both, at the time of that comment, I sat in matchmaking for 10 minutes in killer and survivor with no game found.
---
"I expect zero latency and like to make a big deal out of that instead of the actual issues"
---
Literally me this morning 😂
---
I was a huge fan of the SAW series, and the pig fit my play style perfectly. Im consistently rank 3 pig, with minimal play (rank one on seasons I had actual time to get really into it). I agree that her higher tier add ons are absolutely worthless. You can make a tunnel build, which is... honestly no fun for anyone... Any perk involving altering the timers, the dash, or the crouch are also pointless. I understand why they exist but they offer either no real advantage, or an unreliable advantage, which is equally as pointless. I have found the best consistent build to be "Razor Wires" plus "Interlocking Razors". It gives the beartraps a purpose besides slowing down the game, and can be genuinely useful. A good pig will still never beat an organized team of good players, as a true balanced killer should be.   
---
And yes, the mori is so fucking disappointing. Its the exact same mori as Legion's. There are so many cool thinks they could do...
---
Not to mention that they're completely wasting a trap and its core function.
---
*Sea Goat
---
Played with this guy the other day and he DCed in that match too!
---
Painful to watch old jokes that weren't funny to begin with get repeated to ad naseum, makes you wonder if you're surrounded by kids or... morons.
---
Forget everything you learned about "playing fair". Don't play by survivors' rules. Your job is to kill them. If they don't like it, they can find another game to play.
---
1 easy trick to farm bloodpoints! Developers hate him!
---
You can’t blame survivors for map design. 
---
Are you really trying to start the “using ________ perks is toxic” debate? 
---
Using a perk is what it is. Yes, LF was using insidious, AND was using the corn to try and camouflage him I might add, but he was super toxic camping (5 gens left, really?), and had mega toxic post game comments. 
---
Again, he did not care about BP’s, he cared only about ruining games for others, simply because we’d found his hex.
---
pig
---
Well, I wasn't even thinking about this video but absolutely. Why the fuck would a killer mori-stun a survivor if they didn't do anything.
---
Had this happen to me last night on PS4. Unplayable match. Saw entity outside of map too. Players were entities to my view as well.
---
You follow them but keep your distance, or spin when you see people. It also helps to drop them or let them get off while spinning
---
This is just stupid
---
Teabagging is not toxic? I often teabag just to communicate. For example when 2 people DCed in loading screen and we probably cant win I don't run from killer I just teabag on spot if he comes - sometimes they agree to leave me in peace then. 
---
Teabag behind a pallet is different tho. 
---
But if a survivor teabags INSTEAD of running it means "Hey I am not afk but I am intentionally not running from you"
---
The most common way is just by rapidly spamming the switch teams button right when the game would start. 
---
https://youtu.be/Sskva92TutE?t=137
---
Just learn to 360. Especially on console. I feel you man trust me. They nerf the Christ out of survivors but as soon as a survivor suggest an overall  killer nerf, people like this guy scream and bleed out of their eyes.
---
The game would have to rerender the whole map if there are less than minimum pallets, resetting the loading screen bar and hoping you get minimum pallets or more. Even if it wasn't intentional, just making double pallets is the best choice.
---
*Get Off My D* starts playing
---
Clown didn't come with any anti-steath perks.
---
Pig mains generally just want a fun game, from my experience. (Although I too main Amanda)
---
testing's over
---
Honestly, the mechanics of the game seem to inherently piss people off.  
---
And the more you climb the ranks, the worse it gets.  
---
Probably because the most broken people are at the highest ranks.  
---
  
---
But I honestly don't understand people who constantly DC.  
---
What's the point of playing the game if you're gonna ragequit the second something doesn't go your way?  
---
I think the developers need to take a step up and fix their shit.
---
I don't particularly like the skirt or the top but the head is nice.
---
It's boring as fuck, that's about it.

Congrats bro! I play nurse on ps4 too, even if i havent ever get rank 1 with her (but i played nurse a rank 1) . 
---
My build is shadowborn/bbq/ruin/make your choice, what do you use?
---
Really hoping it's another original killer. Ghostface honestly has nothing going for him that isn't already covered by one or more killers.
---
Crapper*
---
Face camping is almost required when you see 2 or 3 people within feet of the hook just waiting for you to peel off to save. In those cases, Ill face and let them watch their stupidity fuck their team up. If they weren't there and very obviously visible, itd be different.
---
Of course, the same goes with chasing people. If you're trying to distract me by running to a pallet and standing there, fuck you. You've just shown me why I shouldn't go after you and keep after who I'm after.
---
im a good hag i dont camp hooks i place one trap and go uwu
---
I use ruin, bbq, shadowborn and nurse but I think that your build sounds better make your choice on nurse seems really strong given her ability to cover such distances. And thanks btw !
---
The reason for that is simple: If you don't let them know they're only alive because you allowed it then they'll think they won. Which means you'll think you lost!
---
I'm red rank killer purple rank survivor and I've have the same problem with both sides, only right when the bloodhunt started though, before that my killer ques we're almost instant and survivor not too bad.
---
Everyone's salty, survivors are toxic, and killers are assholes. Nobody wins and everyone ships meg x Myers. Welcome to dbd
---
This literally is happening I even hear people running behind as I hook, I leave and somehow the hooked survivor dies on their first hook
---
Teenagers dressing up and killing people for literally no reason was added with Legion though. I don't know if BHVR will revisit the same niche twice in six months.
---
Ladies and gentlemen, behold.
---
Shitticus Edgelordeus
---
Just because killers are supposed to kill survivors,  doesn't mean they should take advantage of the game and make it impossible for us to do anything. Same for survivors who ruin games for killers. A game is supposed to be fun correct?
---
If survivors want to loop because "ChAseS r fun! steAltH iS BoRiNG1!1!", then the time killers have to spend to find them needs to be reduced. It's as simple as that.
---
When a team of Dwight’s find the spot on the plauges map
---
All about this money, I dont think about no thighs
---
Ace in the Hole
---
Eh in games like smite, LoL, cod etc skins are normally $10 so not really.
---
So Snoop?
---
I feel like balancing killers themselves should be priority. Did you see the PC rank one survival rate? It was over 60%
---
The league of legions
---
LOL it was a bug, it should have been a fast vault
---
also cute
---
Haven't they gone through like 4 vocalists?
---
Flat is justice
---
Missing a skill check is a punishment for missing s skillcheck. I dont know wharbyoh mean by "if more than one is on a gen they get a penatly" and you can't really call an obvious triangle you put yourself into a punishment.
---
Actually I think he's referring to this problem as a killer main. There's been times where I try to hit someone and get autolocked onto someone else.
---
I play the game as normal, no tunneling, no camping, no hitting trapped survivors. I just hate farming, it gets boring after x amount of times in a night.
---
It makes her look fat and her tits seem to hang low. Plus that outfit is definitely a hooker outfit. Regardless, leather skirt? That's discusting.
---
Frank get back in your corner.
---
:(
---
Rainbows that one actually sounds pretty cool to see
---
Also happy mic day!
---
I like to change something after a while, using the same build over and over is boring. Both myc and nurses are great perks on her. I suggest you to try  deerstalker, with nurse slugging happen a lot of times and that really help you.
---
If The Hookers ain't the name of the biggest killer group I'll be disappointed in y'all
---
It's like you're new to videogames haha. Stop following rules. Play how you play and that be it.
---
I acc have a slug build for nurse if ye wanna try. Deerstalked, Ruin, infectious fright, sloppy butcher.
---
PC Nurse main: BBQ, Nurse's, Deerstalker, Infectious Fright, not sure how awful the frame rate is on PS4 though (in order to quickly utilize the aura reading from Infectious Fright).
---
Would you like survivors to run instaheals, teabag at pallets genrush and they all leave? It's fun for them right? Didn't think so.
---
Ps4 friends yay! 
---
Everyone add me, GT: XFastReflexesX 
---
I play casually (rank 1 killer and 10 survivor) promise I won’t camp hatch hahahaa
---
This is the one community I've ever seen where its cool and popularized by streamers to be called toxic. It's really quite sad that so many people want to piss other people off to have fun.
---
Hello again, Huntress video is done finally. I'm trying to get recordings outside of stream, so they're higher quality/don't have stream overlay stuff all over them (plus I started using a webcam and editing footage with my stupid face on it would look super disjointed)
---
Next video is on Leatherface, and shouldn't honestly take that long since they just did a "ctrl+c/ctrl+v" on Billy's addons for Leatherface, so there won't be too much extra testing involved.
---
As always, any constructive criticisms and/or comments are appreciated!
---
Just curious, do you use a headset?
---
I proudly proclaim that I enjoy this game full of broken mechanics and toxic losers. Just make a button at the start already that the Killer can click telling people if he's serious or not. If I click the skull, you're going on the hook.
---
&gt; People cursing at me for body-blocking them during the unstealth animation as Wraith
---
That's what you're supposed to do. Won't happen once you rank up
---
&gt; People calling me "camper" when I try to get at least one sacrifice in after doors are open
---
Another low rank problem. This is exactly what you're supposed to do and anybody who doesn't understand that is a salty survivor main.
---
&gt; People unhooking others right infront of you
---
Low rank problem again. Then they want to call you a tunneler/camper when they didn't even let you leave.
---
&gt; Survivors on the hook wriggling // From what I've observed that doesn't seem to be "meta" anymore
---
None of it matters anymore. There are people who think the wriggling means "come save me".
---
(PS4)
---
Me too
---
Cows has a Reddit??
---
Thankfully, I just kept it 7th for meme consistency (and I didn't feel like going back and seeing how many DLCs in a row the anti-stealth has been)
---
Legion doesn't stab me, Legion slaps my ass and makes me run faster.
---
Couldn't have said Survivors just put Object of Obsession in their builds lol
---
For everything besides the hooking part, it's all salty/toxic survivors or low ranks. For the wriggling, I wasn't even aware it meant that. I just do it while I'm hooked to keep myself busy since I have heavy ADHD.
---
Entity Commandment #7: If thou playest as the Hag, thou must place 20 traps around hooked survivors at every possible angle.
---
Oh wait yeah, I was zoomed in when I commented this
---
BECAUSE YOU FIRST HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT PLUS YOU DONT KNOW HOW MANY TOTEMS ALREADY GOT CLEANSED BY OTHERS. AS A RESULT YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR TOTEMS THAT ARE ALREADY CLEANSED. THIS TAKES UP WAY TOO MUCH TIME.
---
is this punishable in KYF? if not i’d love to try it.
---
also, how?
---
Same, but she did chase me for 4 gens.  ;)
---
Not even counting Jackie, yes they’ve had 4 vocalists. 2 at a time.
---
Check the settings. Pretty sure there's an option
---
YOU DONT HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT IF YOU KNOW THE TOTEM SPOTS, UNLESS YOURE ALWAYS IN A CHASE THERES NO REASON TO NOT CLEANSE ONE IF YOU KNOW YOURE NEAR
---
then both should kill people
---
The Clown is into some extreme shit. Best not get Moried.
---
If there are double pallets, then it's not the killer being fucked over, its the survivors since you only have 8 pallets. Besides, I don't think you know how the game makes it's maps. Research before making statements
---
It's the work of the Entity. She poisons our minds and  thoughts, manipulating our Behaviour. Why Survivors teabag? Why Killers Camp? Questions that have a million answers without reasons. Become one with the Entity, give In and accept His will. You'll smile more offten when Camping that teabagging Survivor or Teabagging that Camping Killer. Know She is trapped in game and needs you to Escape into real life "aka"post game chat"  She feeds on Fear, Hope, Pain, Joy and Anger. Beware!!!.
---
Lost it during the moonwalking this is the funniest shit I've ever seen in this game.
---
I have every killer and honestly I love them all. Your best process of choosing would be determining your playstyle/favorite killer and then choosing someone who has the best perks for it. I would recommend The Spirit, The Legion, and Michael personally, as spirit is fun and has great perks, legion is MY favorite but I recommend because he has great perks, one of them being great for huntress, and Michael because he's just so simple and good
---
What do you want to do? Chase? Sneak? Outsmart?
---
Got any tips? I seem to lose survivors a lot when I get exhausted after a blink. I'm trying to get better but I'm not sure what's the best way to do this.
---
True. I’m sure since my day went so well yesterday I’m gonna get some a-hole survivors today lol we’ll see
---
I feel your pain...
---
I still get looped even with Frenzy. I often eat pallets like crazy or someone vaults a window as I lunge. I feel like I often "Prevent" pallets or vaults via my ability MUCH more with Doctor compared to Legion.
---
Billies with reduced charge time add-ons that get up right behind you to rev the chainsaw in your asshole and avoid missing no matter what.
---
It is toxicity
---
Tbagging at gates or harassing messages are not "tools given"
---
I hope your luck is better than mine! Lol.
---
There's a little button to the left of the touch pad. It says SHARE right above it. If you press it a side menu will appear. From there you can save the screenshot. 
---
Welcome to 2019.
---
Meh. Luck is different day by day,  I just felt like ranting, still love the game especially when we get awesome killers and survivors.
---
Compared to other games? Yeah they're a bit overpriced, but they're all direct purchase so far which I really appreciate. If they were this price in lootboxes and such I'd definitely be hyper reluctant to buy them.
---
I did the same thing and then I got bored. Nurse is way to strong of a killer. Especially on console.
---
Hillbilly.  
---
On the surface, his chainsaw is incredibly easy to use - just get on the survivor's ass and chainsaw them to down, but once you get more in-depth with him, you'll see that there are many other things you can use the chainsaw for like chainsawing around loops to cut chase times by a significant amount, zoning, making specific curves and the fact that almost every add-on makes his playstyle differ make him a very hard killer to master and really enjoyable to play.
---
ppl are cunts thats just it
---
Typically I just play like normal until I get the four BBQ + Chili stacks, and then when I down a guy I drag them to the hook and just drop them.
---
Tells the survivors instantly that "Hey, I could have just killed you, but I didn't. Let's farm."
---
Really that’s weird I think she’s much much better on pc like no comparison.
---
As u/ZombieHuggerr said it's not "playing with the tools given" to teabag the Killer, unhook yourself with Deliverance, Decisive Strike them, and then get Mettle of Man to activate all while teabagging and nothing else.
---
Using Flashlights, Ultra Rare items (BNPs/Instaheals) and strong perks is using the tools given, and it's on Behavior to fix the problems with these mechanics. But being a dick is not using the tools given: it's just being a dick.
---
Auric cells only, so even if it was nice I wouldn't have bought it.
---
P.S. Claudette outfit is on fire, but still cells only.
---
Agreed. I still feel like his power captures his role in the movie pretty well. It's also cool that you can see a survivor on his shoulder while he's invisible for you - you also see that in the movies.
---
Freddy's power is just bad atm.  
---
The fact that you need to use your power just so you can wait until you can interact with the survivors makes him a really weak killer, even when compared to bad M1 killers.
---
Mostly looking for a balance between perks and play style
---
I bought the new outfit for Kate as I main her, but the skirt is utterly ugly. The top looks fancy yes, and works better with the long, black jeans. 
---
Even so, I don't use it...too visible and flashy in the grass, bushes, etc.
---
Which killers do you already have?
---
I couldn't when it was still active. Still can't.
---
Can confirm. Ran into him yesterday (or at least someone with that name). Disconnected on first down.
---
calm spirit is unaffected by infectious fright, but in the PTB patch notes they said they're buffing calm spirit to affect more screams so im assuming it won't for much longer
---
not sure about the answer to your second question, id assume they still scream through it though
---
Nope, didn't you know that Bloody Party Streamers tremendously increase chances of getting infinite loading screen?   
---
And I;m being serious, 70% of the times I get infite loading screens are when somebody burnt BPS.
---
Thank you for a reasonable contribution to this thread.
---
Making basement not an easily abused death trap when hooks are already viable now?
---
BHVR: I'd never.
---
Tuntunruntunrunruntun
---
Just never get to the point where all the gens are powered 4Head.  
---
It decreases to punish boring playstyles, which camping is a part of.
---
Yes I always play against you and you were really good and I added you I can’t forget your name 😂
---
If you don't chase survivors enough, your skill can't be determined.
---
Welp I can't now and I could before, so it's just not there anymore
---
xD thank you. I'm honestly trash at looping never mind going against the nurse since I've finally stopped being an immersed survivor
---
I-
---
•The campers
---
•The tunnelers 
---
•the NoEds
---
•The tryhards
---
•The crutchperkers
---
Oh I agree completely. I wasn't complaining about the survivors trying not to get killed, only when they DC as I'm killing them. And you're right about the double blood points. I'll give it up for now and try again once the event ends.
---
Spies was buffed and now is actually pretty decent on killers who need to detect Surviviors when close. 
---
Deerstalker is still top notch for slug builds (I'm pretty sure the nerf you are referring to was not being able to see when they're getting healed?).
---
Nurses calling is literally one of the best perks in the game to date. 
---
NOED was reworked ages ago and then was buffed so all tiers have insta down. 
---
PWYF isn't that great to begin with but was nerfed probably bc Monto showed off PWYF combod with tombstone and tuft for high speed Moris. 
---
Unrelenting is only used by bad killers. 
---
STBFL was nerfed to prevent machine gun Myers. 
---
Franklin's still does its job
---
Unrelenting Huntress pog
---
Really? Maybe only if you DC/freeze during the loading screen. I've had that happen and didn't lose my addons, and I read somewhere on a "Evil Incarnate" guide somewhere you could DC and keep your tombstone/tuft. Maybe it was changed since then?
---
I’d get in a chase with ye and lose you immediately I’d get so annoyed .
---
You could play on Xbox where they don’t need to derank. Just use LFG to find a lower ranked players. I’ve had so many matches this weekend where I went up against survivors more than five ranks above me who were grouped with people ten ranks below *them*.
---
You can hide chat I think if you hit the arrow next to the text box. I personally just ignore the dumbasses. I enjoy seeing them get so worked up over a game.  Public your profile on steam to get more great comments.
---
SWF does that too, but for free.
---
Meg's just ugly :)
---
If you like Killers based on traps: Hag
---
If you like Killers based on charges: Cannibal, Doctor or Plague
---
If you like Killers based on timers: Legion, Spirit or Micheal
---
If you like stelthy killers: Micheal, Spirit or Pig 
---
If you like aggressive killers: basically everyone who was mentioned and Clown
---
If you like mindgame killers: Spirit, Hag or Pig
---
Buy lincensed killers first, Micheal is the most balanced: Fun and original power, balanced addons that can also change the game.
---
When being immersed actually helps xD
---
Thanks, and based on the answers I can tell the comunity around this game is super positive.
---
I actually downed the same person at the gates but felt generous and decided to drop them and leave.
---
I didn't realize that. I really don't like DCing though. Especially as the killer.
---
I will.
---
So if I down survivors quickly, it can’t see that as efficient and good at chasing?
---
they told us it's a "full gameplay overhaul"
---
On console?!?! Holy shit, you certainly get the biggest props from me. It's hard af to get one kill as nurse on console
---
SWF = op
---
It's actually not as bad as you'd think it is, to be frank.
---
Been leveling Freddy up during the event so I could get Fire Up and Remember Me on some other killers, and I've gotten 3-4k every game I don't let the survivors escape.
---
The ability to walk up to a survivor on the gen, they leave, you hit it, and now you know exactly where they are at and where they are heading is ridiculously powerful. 
---
And even with a level 1 Hex: Ruin I practically have to let Survivors get gens done because they'll fail a skillcheck, I'll sleep them again, I kick it, they double back trying to get another skillcheck so I kick it again and on and on has made it where the game goes 5-6 minutes until another generator gets done.
---
Oh my god.
---
I pretty much consider myself a trapper main too, he\`s the most chill killer in dbd, you just put traps around and wait for survivors to step in them, or bait them into stepping on one during a chase. Also, I see anyone play trapper so rarely, to the point I feel like survivors themselves forgot how to play against him, I actually play against Freddy more often than trapper
---
I meant more like the type of comments I mentioned, with people needlessly arguing about dumb things
---
Gooooood *insert evil laugh*
---
Another ebony mori directly off hook post from you.  You're a god at this game, how do you do it?
---
Shut up bitch
---
True. I guess it's only worth learning if you personally just like Freddy. To each their own though.
---
God mode perks? Where? Mettle of Man is the only remotely usable perk we’ve gotten recently. Decisive got nerfed because of killer complaints.  Is it really such a travesty that survivors want a nurse nerf, or the recently introduced legion nerf? How dare we not want to be blink camped and omega blinked every game. I guarantee you’re the Leatherface that camps and gets salty post game saying we “genrushed” , or the Nurse that slugs and basement blinks
---
I play on console, so yes, she's the worst killer on ps4
---
Grrrr survivors are trying to survive and interrupt your objectives &gt;:( better be toxic
---
Farming downvotes I see?
---
What's your username? I'd love to play with/against you sometime
---
It's efficient, yes.  
---
If survivors go down too quickly, it's just assumed they aren't skilled enough - any decent survivor can last even a little bit.  
---
Which is why they can't ascertain your skill from a couple of really short chases.  
---
Nevertheless, the whole system is kinda flawed because you can't determine a person's skill without constantly watching him go against several players of different skill levels and taking previous games into account.
---
That would be so damn cool, plus it would fit an interesting niche not yet covered by any killer currently in the game. I would be happy with Ghostface or Pinhead, but I really hope you're right
---
Thanks for answering :)
---
Same happened to me today - ebony mori spamming Leatherface.
---
Real fun.
---
Also, happy cake day! :)
---
Imagine running Bamboozle :/
---
I don't mind the Ruin, but Bamboozle ticks me off &gt;:(
---
That’s why I never pip. I’m a p3 billy, I snipe people a lot, and get chainsaw hits fairly quick. I never have a full chase, so I never pip.
---
It’s a lifestyle
---
I'd love to mori you! :)
---
If you like something, play it.  
---
Isn't that why we play the game, to have fun?  
---
Each person has their own fun with different playstyles.
---
Speaking of noob3, some killer accused me of trying hard to be like him because I was trying not to use pallets stupidly. His insult was something along the lines of "lol look at me I am pallet conscience, fucking noob3 wannabe". 
---
I genuinely don't understand why it's bad to try to conserve pallets instead of just dropping them as soon as I run through them during a chase...and this coming from probably the worst pallet looper in the game lmao
---
Imagine not wanting to get looped to infinity at the shack
---
You get less points by tunnelling lol
---
New killer model: the scuttler. 
---
Some spider like being that runs really fast on the ground. Runs up walls and maybe ceilings too.
---
Looks like you glitched in a new model that's not fully tested yet. My hunch says it's a test skeleton for a killer they're working on way down the line.
---
Looks sick and creepy.
---
New can’t watch it
---
You'd have to be in red ranks to match up with me so that'll never happen
---
What a bitch lmao
---
This subreddit when survivors waste time butt dancing at the exit gates: Toxic pieces of shit!!!
---
This subreddit when Killers mori stun a survivor, wasting that person's time: It is up for interpretation.
---
This fits the SCP foundation, not dbd
---
You can see the circle button on the lower middle corner, so definitely PS4.
---
Who gently opened the door this time
---
All I see is some idiot that wasted like 7minutes doing nothing and never touching a gen. You guys woulda all survived if you actually helped in with objectives.
---
*Samara Morgan liked this*
---
i maintain that using belt with iridescent head is cheating
---
Why would you care about achievements, they do nothing. Besides, you can just depip for a little bit, get to rank that's easier to pip at, and play overly nice.
---
People say "Flat is justice" but women doesn't say "Small penis is justice"
---
Yes but i wanted to practice some 360s
---
Boys and girls of every age
---
Wouldn't you like to see something strange?
---
Come with us and you will see
---
This, our town of Halloween 🎃
---
only the bad women don’t say it 😩😔
---
Got the shrine one last week 😂 no need
---
Disconnect
---
People have been making me mad this blood hunt. It's almost impossible to save bloodpoints cause people are dicks
---
She gave you an Insta heal :D
---
Hag was one of the first Killers I leveled up so her perk pool is pretty poor for me. I also got one of the cosmetics for her that is missing the claw and I think her prestiged claw would complete the set. I’ve already hit 50 but I’m burning through her high level add-ons before I lose them.
---
The basic ones. Idk honestly. I like them all. Whichever one has a daily is usually who I play. I don’t have a desire
---
While it makes survivors unique, most people will end up playing the same survivor.  
---
Let's take the exhaustion buff on Meg for example - 2 seconds faster recovery may not seem like much, but for a passive, buffing exhaustion would make it so if you want to play any build with an exhaustion perk - use that character.  
---
I think it'll ruin some of the diversity of the game, but that's just my opinion.
---
seems fun
---
Looks like a glitched Hag model.
---
This is why I quit this game man, so many salty killers who ruin it for everyone, especially during events. They get a group who destroys them once and they bring out all the Moris and play like complete assholes. It’s so boring to go against after the 4th game it happens
---
So many gens would pop
---
Eh. I do mostly survivor anyways, ran a Plag for 4 gens, died first hook when they ran out the gate after I got hooked.
---
I'd recommend Bubba if you don't have BBQ&amp;Chili, since it's the strongest perk in the game.  
---
Spirit for Spirit Fury and really fun killer gameplay.  
---
Hag for good/fun Hex perks and if you're good with her, she's incredibly relaxing to play as.  
---
Shape for a slightly different experience of an M1 killer.
---
I love solo queue.
---
Claudettes can hide anywhere, anytime. This is what I call "a skill".
---
I don’t watch Monti too often personally, so I don’t really know where he’d be placed :/ you can suggest a coordinate though if you’d like :)
---
I started way back when so the last killer I bought was huntress
---
We've already got Pig which is a somewhat luck-based killer and she's pretty awful *because* she's luck-based.  
---
I think luck-based killers won't do good for this game, since luck is already involved in so many aspects of the game - the map, pallet spawns, tile spawns, generator spawns, etc...
---
this is the equivalent of a killer saying “don’t repair gens just stand around and let me kill you or else you have no skill”.
---
this is probably the dumbest thing i’ve ever seen in this game, kudos to you OP
---
Oh yea and even then certain matches will be a swf and you can tell cause of the big variance in each of their ranks and those are hardcore sometimes I'm at rank nine and when I get a swf who have red ranks I get slaughtered still fun though
---
It would be funnier if you showed a huge amount of moris and said this.
---
Spirit's incredibly fun to play as, but a nightmare to go against.
---
Ok
---
maybe instead of doing 360s you should practice looping bc 360ing a killer doesnt waste near as much  of their time as looping them
---
nice job wasting the god pallet btw
---
I did feel like she was a weak. How would you improve her?
---
Both sides are awful and toxic.
---
Play killer, end up against a 4 man SWF who finish generators in 3 minutes and tell you to hang yourself in endgame chat because you only have 2 perks on a fresh prestige character.
---
Play survivor, your teammates are dumber than the rocks they crouch behind for the entire match. Killer tunnels and mori spams you while your last teammate gets hatch with a solid 8k points afterwards.
---
Freddy gets a bad rep, but people whonare freddy mains know how to use him to the point that i would take him over billy and huntress.
---
This is Halloween, this is Halloween, pumpkins scream in the dead of night.
---
I like how she messed up the flashlight blind by shining it at his back 😁
---
Im not your momy, I dont give a fuck if u have a good or a bad time. I dont care if u ragequit the game if I tunel u, just like I dont give a fuck if we play statcraft and I rush you. What is wrong with the community is ppl like you, entitled snowflakes how think that the rest of the world should take care of your happiness. Flash news, we dont give a fuck about your enjoyment of the game. If losing a game vs certain strategies makes you angry and dont wanna play more, maybe you dont like the game as much as u think.
---
07
---
VINCRYPTID
---
Bad Hand seems... useless.  
---
Greed doesn't do much, since there're only 3 chests a game, and most survivors don't even search them.  
---
Nervous Fumbling just seems like a more annoying version of Franklin's Demise.
---
check out my channel and u can see i can loop boi
---
* Deerstalker and Nurse's calling had their radii gutted because survivors complained about bleeding out on the floor because of a situation ***they*** created.
---
* NOED was completely destroyed when it was made into a Hex perk. And no, its tiers being more consistent is not a buff. The perk has actually been nerfed again in that patch where tiers 1 and 2 were changed, the melee cooldown reduction was removed completely.
---
* PWYF was way better on release, the current iteration with max stacks grants the same m.s. bonus the original iteration used to grant with 2 stacks.
---
* Unrelenting used to reduce the cooldown on both missed and succesful M1 attacks. Was changed to only reduce whiffs, effectively making it useless.
---
* STBFL was nerfed because killers combined it with Unrelenting to stop survivors from swarming their hooked teammates.
---
* Franklin's demise used to have higher values and to work with M2 attacks.
---
Babr4200.
---
Yeah, stay away, we don't need more good Pig mains. And survivors don't need to know how to play Pig properly (not that he's bad on other killers, it's just his Amanda is amazing)
---
by not adding her to the game. cant get bullied if you don't exist
---
Ultimately it's his stream and he can do whatever he wants with it (within Twitch's guidelines of course). He might be a dick, certainly sounds like it, but I don't feel like it's an issue worth spreading everywhere. If anything you'll be helping him out by giving him more traffic.
---
My twitch is Babr420 for anyone that wants to tune in when I stream :)
---
Killers are punished for playing in ways that are unfun, and I couldn't agree more with that.  
---
Let survivors enjoy the game, and even killers get more enjoyment out of it - do you enjoy watching a survivor on hook while doing right about nothing? there's nearly no killer-survivor interaction when camping, no matter when.
---
What's your rank?
---
I wasn't saying all killers are assholes. I've gone against plenty of killers that were fair, its just the asshole killers REALLY stand out and often have creepy/racist steam profiles.
---
There's a surprising amount of people playing survivor on PC atm, actually.
---
Thanks for the extremely helpful feedback
---
Yeah I agree
---
And Holy shit your comment went down quick from 17 to 1, jeez people calm down
---
no problem
---
🤔
---
This is true in more ways than one
---
I'm not arguing that it's "hard" to find a Claudette. Let's take an extreme example, you have a character hiding in a bush/corner, there's a higher chance you'll see him if he's a Dwight with the new pizza delivery skin. Again, that's an extreme scenario, but you can't argue that it's a small advantage. 
---
Now, I'm not complaining about balance, the entire reason why I brought this up is to show that(hopefully) small advantages won't affect the diversity of characters played. But I may be wrong.
---
Probably cause of the longer que times on killer, I tried playing killer earlier but didn't want to wait for the que so I just went and played survivor where it's been instant ques for me
---
Yeah just make him more popular by making posts about him. That will help.
---
*uhhh*
---
id rather not but judging from the part where you camped the pallet instead of running im gonna go out on a limb and not believe you
---
Rosa... is that you?!?
---
Yeah that was bad of me but i thought she was gonna swing trough it and didn't think i would make it to the window if i didnt drop it boiii
---
I only play on PC since I don't have the money for online play on PS4 and don't own an xbox, but if that's seriously the way xbox lobbies work right now it doesn't look like I'm missing much :/
---
&gt;Deerstalker and Nurse's calling had their radii gutted because survivors complained about bleeding out on the floor because of a situation they created
---
Nurses calling being anything *BEYOND* a terror radius is 100% bullshit. 
---
&gt;NOED was completely destroyed when it was made into a Hex perk. And no, its tiers being more consistent is not a buff. The perk has actually been nerfed again in that patch where tiers 1 and 2 were changed, the melee cooldown reduction was removed completely.
---
NOED before becoming a hex was literally overpowered. It had 0 counterplay and could turn a near 0K into a 4 man easily. And the attack cooldown is negligible when you remember it's a free haste and free insta down. 
---
&gt;PWYF was way better on release, the current iteration with max stacks grants the same m.s. bonus the original iteration used to grant with 2 stacks.
---
Yes but it also sucks bc doing anything pretty much removes a stack. 
---
&gt;Unrelenting used to reduce the cooldown on both missed and succesful M1 attacks. Was changed to only reduce whiffs, effectively making it useless.
---
Again: to remove machine gun builds. 
---
&gt;STBFL was nerfed because killers combined it with Unrelenting to stop survivors from swarming their hooked teammates.
---
And, again, to prevent machine gun builds. And killers got Mad Grit to make up for that. 
---
&gt;Franklin's demise used to have higher values and to work with M2 attacks.
---
Yes bc cross map Iridescent head Huntresses need to also destroy your items as well as your health bar and sanity
---
Survivors or even killers being toxic is a thing that happens, that's just how the internet is.  
---
I recommend ignoring those kinds of people, and if you can't - report them(you said they were racist which is reportable).  
---
No matter where, you're gonna meet douche-bags. It's unavoidable, but you need to know how to cope with those people.  
---
All I can do for you right now, is wish you a better continuation of your day.  
---
It's nonchalant btw :)
---
I don't know why people don't crouch off hook. I've been hook trapped and fully healed without triggering any because I'm not brain dead and crouch. Meanwhile I'll approach a hook crouched, pull someone off and they'll trigger them all at once and get downed again.
---
Dude I am new too and earning blood points is such a hassle oh my,  I can't play this game everyday of the week but I want good perks too... They need to add some buy BP thing for players who can't invest so many hours.
---
Just a thought people
---
Survivor's been instant for me as well, but killer's been really good since double bp.
---
interesting but why
---
Um...Dwight is super cute in a nerdy way. Especially Dweader.
---
Don't forget your hex ruin!
---
Lol that's awesome. Me and my friend decided to try and play a free ps plus game at the same time together and it just happened to be this awesome game that we now play 24/7. 😀
---
Horrible on PS4 too.
---
you got banned for asking for advice, saying the advice is wrong, then insulted him
---
Oh man! Rosa is a dog I take care of some times and looks exactly like your husky!
---
To quote the legend himself, “I understood that reference”
---
The sheer thiccness of Jane caused their computer to overload and crash
---
I believe that once you get to rank 12 or so, your queues will be much faster.  
---
It could also just be the time of day.
---
ok homophobe
---
So isn’t it unfair to expect people to not play the game as they would normally?
---
Listen, I get that you’re salty that a Killer kills you when you run BPS, but at the same time just farming BP isn’t what people want to do all day.
---
Sounds like you do m8y
---
We'd finally have a character thiccer than Jane
---
It's worse when you use party streamers during 2x bps. Every time I run streamers i get tunneled
---
I still prefer the original 2 there vocal harmonic difference made for a good fucking sound.
---
How about dropping the ban hammer on these constant disconnecting assholes?
---
Fourteen years old 
---
*Fourteen years old*
---
***Fourteen DAMN!*** uh, years old.
---
Oh God, good riddance to that.
---
Exactly, the simple stuff of trash go off yourself this that but saying it verbally is unsettling.
---
Alright. I sent the fr. (Sorry for being slow ;-;) I'll probably play tomorrow, hope your games go well!
---
Thanks man same goes :)
---
Because some people only have fun when others aren't able to.
---
The teabaggers
---
Idk if he is my main main, but, he is a bad killer overall, but the most fun, placing them at pallets and chasing a survivor into one is like winning on a lotto ticket
---
"Because Killers are supposed to kill the Survivors and Survivors aren't supposed to taunt them or make it difficult for them to kill them."
---
Why though. You are neither going to pip unless you farm.
---
Idk what you're talking about, Frank's Mixtape is the only add-on that makes Legion fair.  
---
Going against all these toxic genrushing SWF groups, only Frank's can deal with them.
---
These would all probably be made into clans, honestly.
---
I never asked help from someone of that skill level I get help from Tru3
---
Would there be Bloodpoint Racials like +10% Boldness BP on David King?
---
The sweaters that give more profit vs The sweaters that take much more effort
---
Well you're banned now so go on back to tru kiddo
---
Just use a mori the normal toxic way.
---
People run NOED in every rank. If you're sick of it, waste your time cleansing totems.
---
wah, wah , wah WAAAAAH
---
god spirit is so annoying
---
Thank you! Now to just implement it into my gameplay...
---
A mori isn't enough, you need to make them dc or they genrush you, even on a 1v1
---
oh ok r/deadbydaylight i'm boutta head out
---
This. But you gotta admit, red rank spirit using noed? Yikes
---
But you gotta admit, any killer that's better than Freddy running NOED? Yikes.
---
All of my matches have been killers playing with all their purple &amp; pink add-ons &amp; offerings. Moris and brand new parts galore.
---
NOED rewards bad gameplay.
---
It is a good perk, why would you not?
---
I hope they at one point introduce a new game mode where everyone is completely stripped off of their perks and add-ons
---
Yes. It's called "map pressure".
---
Rank doesnt mean anything, especially nowadays.
---
One tip I have that I used when starting out was going into a game with a green mori (or a red one). The point is to kill one survivor ASAP. Since you are trying to win I wouldn't care about it not being fair or if they think it is "toxic", you are just using the tools you are given. Once one survivor is dead the game gets a lot easier. You chase one survivors, down them and chase another one, this makes it so one guy is on the hook, one is going for the save and the other is being chased, which means no objectives are being done.
---
He needs to be on the hook
---
Wig. Anyways stan Kingfeild.
---
Keep playing the game and you´ll get better. Use the ruin and apply map pressure
---
I love how confused the game that it shows yourself with bond.
---
Joke's on you, I'm gonna be the new Killer! The Smasher...except instead of breaking environmental objects with my hands, I'm just gonna grab the pallet and break it over the survivor's head.
---
well it's not easy and you can't fully stop then, you can delay them tho
---
Hex: Ruin can make them work slower
---
playing a killer that finds it easier to apply pressure like Billy can delay their work
---
leading the chase near generators by kicking pallets on right sides can force the one you chase to interrupt his friend's job
---
not chasing one person for god knows how long also helps a lot. if someone's simply too good, leave them and go find someone else
---
I consider thiccphobia to be just anti-niche strategy like how Hangman's Trick is anti-sabo squads, in thiccphobia's case counters self caring between loops
---
But when said self care looping was nerfed the perk became a lot more just general anti-alturism
---
Which is why he can’t be in the game, he is simply not a good candidate for a killer BECAUSE he’s a living joke.
---
I don't know, i just wanted to kill her and be done with it, she was afk too
---
I can only find and do so many when running solo.. I always hope a random has done at least 1 or 2 but it never fails they dont.
---
You literally are just complaining about the add-ons and her mori. There isn't a single person who gives a crap about this post so I don't know why you're getting heated. You said you were a bit of a big fan so I assumed you didn't play pig much.
---
since you're the only person giving actual advice, what's the best way to deal with pallet spammers, juke gods, and super immersed hide and seek players?
---
It matters now... its a lot harder to get to red rank you have to actually work for it..
---
As long as survivors bring adrenaline, I'll bring noed, if BHVR wants to delete both perks at the same time then I'd love that.
---
It rewards bad game play.. its mostly for newer people who need help getting a kill. Not people who've been playing for a while.
---
You learn totem locations as you play the game, it gets really easy to find totems once you know where they can spawn.
---
Because you're *obviously* supposed to kill everyone before the gens are completed.
---
It’s definitely more of a PC issue. I play on PS4 and see shit like that once in a blue moon. I watch streamers that have it happen multiple times **per hour**. It’s insane.
---
you man really need a guide, not a comment. someone can't just tell you that. the best way would be to show it to you. watch how some streamers play and try to analise how they are dealing with that.
---
Well it is the survivors who allow NOED to get activated. Considering the meta is to do gens ASAP using things like Ruin and NOED just makes sense.
---
Frank you're already a killer's club.
---
Because it rewards bad gameplay.  
---
Because it's a boring perk that most people that run it need to rely on it to get a kill or two.  
---
Because if you're a good killer, it won't even get used as you almost never get to that point of the game.
---
Iv ran into 3 different ones running noed. I'm rank 2 survivor right now and I've been blown away at how many people run it especially on spirit.
---
well I'm a doc main, so map pressure isn't a big deal for me, but when I run into a super immersed 4man that knows how to hide and dodge, that's when I have an issue
---
Someone put that Shooting Stars song over it with a space background
---
I love when the nontoxic streamers show their items and offerings and they have like 200 ebony moris on each killer rofl
---
It’s a great perk but by no means does it have the highest skill cap...
---
Honestly, just turn off the chat.
---
You just need to embrace the salt,  in my philosophy, if they are so salty it means you're doing a job well done, your job as a killer isn't to give them an advantage, and you can and should use every mechanic at disposal to your benefit, if it is "unfair" then that only means the game is unbalanced, and the developers are to blame, what i recommend is just quitting as soon as the game ends and let them have to keep all their salt to themselves.
---
Some killer are better than others when it comes to chasing and tracking, Doctor is probably the best killer for tracking and Nurse can completely ignore pallets since she can blink. or try and use perks that help you, one easy combo is Spirit Fury + Enduring.
---
"No, that's a waste of a perk and something bm'ing bastards with no standards use, I have standards you bby killer" ...That was a bad joke if no one got that
---
I dont get how you can compare a 5 second speedboost and a heal that causes exhaustion to infinite instadowns.
---
I was told that. I never catch her streams.
---
It doesn't grant vault speed anymore, neither does Resilience.
---
Rip vault build, I used to run adrenaline/spine chill/resilience/balanced landing or dead hard :c
---
And then the survivors get mad at you because you they didn't get a lot of points.
---
Report them Mori spamming is against the rules per not_queen, I remember them discussing this in a video.
---
I mean sure NOED can feel like a cheap way to win, especially if all 4 survivors are alive till the end and all and the killers isn't that good or being out skilled and then BOOM all 4 die thx to NOED. But think of it this way, a survivor is on a gen ,doing it ASAP and once it is done they run over to another gen, and they spot a totem, if the survivor doesn't cleanse the totem it is their fault that NOED is activated, you cannot blame the killer for using NOED if you are letting it activate. Your basically giving the killer a bullet and then being mad because they brought a gun. Just like the old DS, NOED can be abused by bad players to make up for the lack of skill. As of the current state of the game, gems are being done to fast, perks like ruin doesn’t buy you a lot of time. So what is a good solution to a group of players doing the objective ASAP and getting out. *Spoiler alert*, it’s NOED. I don’t get how survivors can get mad at the killer for using a perk that they can just disable. If there is even the slightest chance that the killer might have NOED why are you not cleansing totems? NOED isn’t a baby perk, ofc weaker players can use it. In reality the survivors are the babies, not cleansing totems. This is the main thing with NOED, survivors have a very easy way of not getting fucked over by it. If the killer runs NOED and gets you, it is not his fault, it is your fault cause you are the baby survivor.
---
It isn’t exactly infinite.
---
Why don't you take a seat?
---
She's just trying to disguise herself as a pallet. Keyword is "trying".
---
Are you going to do addon and offerings in this style too?
---
the irony in this comment
---
So short killers cant be scary? Got it.
---
Sillyness is what helps a lot of horror keep its lasting appeal.
---
Sure Freddy was scary at first but after a while is the sillyness that kept me coming back. 
---
Evil Dead 2 was the definition of silly.
---
If you feel insulted that I think some light hearted characters would add to this game then you have some serious insecurities.
---
Don't be afraid of some fun loving killers, it doesn't make it any less of a horror game.
---
+ respect for trying to understand their point of view instead of just disagreeing :D

Exactly! I did this last night we had fun and made a shit load of blood points! Done with these pos toxic killers! When you see 2-5 bloody party streamers don’t kill everyone in the first 3 mins of the game! Drag it out or fuck it farm! I swear so many blood thirsty idiots, let’s waste these and not get the full benefits. I don’t wanna hear the bs lines of that’s not how I play or whatever, it’s not like we get a double blood point event once a month.
---
I hope you aren’t implying that tru3 sucks.
---
Thanks for the sugestion, I'm playing much better with Sloppy Butcher.
---
Yah either I find a game or am waiting for 10 mins as survivor and then killer side I’m eating 10mins and I know why because of the Double blood hunt but survivor should be instant then!
---
Exit parade!!! That's my favorite part about playing Hag &lt;3
---
I'm mostly angry about good killers(people) and top tier killers(characters) using NOED.  
---
As long as the person understands he needs NOED in order to get a couple of kills, I don't care for it too much. Just don't be a cocky fuck if you're using it.  
---
Totems usually require you to go out of your way to get, so it's not entirely the survivor's fault for not getting all of them.  
---
Old DS got changed - because it rewarded bad gameplay, I think NOED needs a change too.  
---
You don't usually need perks like Ruin if you're a good enough killer and know how to spread pressure across the map.  
---
To me, NOED isn't an enjoyable perk to use or go up against.
---
I'm totally fine with everyone bouncing as soon as NOED pops up. Just leave me. Don't let a 1k spiral into a 3 or 4k.
---
When ur re appearing from the closk u slow down s little bit
---
Jeff should've been Adam
---
She's hiding in the tall grass ;)
---
Don't have to be a debbie downer about it. It's still what we'd prefer to buy.
---
Ohmygod lol
---
Nice!
---
I actually haven't encountered the plague yet and have only just recently been against Legion. He sucked.
---
uhhhhhh, no you're wrong as fuck? Never seen a comment more off then yours in this subreddit.
---
Staying close to the killer as they're about to hook somebody is a normal strategy to counter BBQ And Chili. The Blendettes will always be hard to see, just run whispers if you're having a hard time spotting them.
---
Imagine having a counter to the perk and saying “well nobody actually wants to counter it”.
---
I’m talking about when it’s active
---
Awh man I can imagine I’d love to get a pc but I’m the average student with no money atm :(
---
Can you get me some sprite?
---
Either you get fucked and don't have time to do totems in which case congratulations, you suck against a 3 perk killer and deserve to die
---
Or you have time to do totems. If you don't then you also deserve to die
---
Alternatively you can play stealthy when the last gen pops and open the gate only when you know the killer isn't near. As there are exactly zero good detection perks this should be easy
---
In short, if you die to NOED it's your fault
---
it is amazing how many people play  spirit and still lack the skill to play as her
---
I’ve actually never played against a face camping spirit in my life. I would actually be honored to play against one as they could just as easily phase back to tunnel u anyway
---
Console gang rise up
---
[deleted]
---
I found her hex totem. I guess I had to go. Lol
---
I stopped playing fair a bit ago, after being cyberbullied for about ten minutes straight, I downed their carry and hooked him in the basement and proceeded to camp him.    I got a 4k that game
---
PS: its still not as toxic as the Division community
---
HAXXORZ
---
No, rank is still absolutely worthless and there is no reason to care about it
---
Idk man nurse seems like a hassle to me. You’re bad? Have fun having constant migraines and looking down. You’re god? Oh meh another 4K and more stupid migraines
---
Kind of my situation too, I got lucky a buddy of mine gave me his old setup. Playing on low but not having to deal with framerate bullshit on console is awesome!
---
Let's hope for the optimization! XD
---
I’ve actually been debating between Freddy and trapper as the next killer for me to main. I’m a pig main now and have gotten over half the killers to prestige 3. I’m mostly waiting for the Freddy rework to play as him but trapper seems enticing as well. Trapper was actually the first killer I began playing as though I only prestiged him once
---
haha wtf . This is funny ! Also I didn't know people can still chat after the game if they dc. Did you report them all for dc-ing ?
---
This is exactly what most of my matches feel like.
---
Very very toxic they tea bag every time ye fuck up a blink it’s ridiculous .
---
Maybe my imagination is a bit too limited, but what would these clubs really add to the game? Would this allow survivors to join a sort of guild and invite fellow members to play when they are online? Would it just be a source of specialized cosmetics? Is it something as mundane as a tag next to someone’s name?
---
I've had only really good discussions with him about perks &amp; different opinion in his stream.  
---
Sure, we've had different views on certain things but hey, to each their own and everything was fine.  
---
So, sorry buddy but the reason you got banned there must've been your fault cuz bans don't happen for nothing in his stream.
---
The 5 second speed boost alone initiates an entirely new chase, not even counting the heal that can get you up from dying.
---
No, NOED punishes bad survivors who refuse to play stealthy and ignore totems
---
Don't tank a hit to finish the last generator and wait for the killer to leave the gen before you finish it and NOED already becomes so much worse
---
Most killers who camp (not proxying) don’t care for their rank or bp, they just want reactions from the survivors.
---
no they dc'd after first down but the issue is the ranking.
---
Me too, though I prefer Feng's.
---
Bro is the building (stained glass) fucking attached to you ?!
---
Best thing you can do is not say anything end game. If you don’t feed the troll they’ll eventually die off.
---
Not to mention people feeling safe behind their screens to say whatever they feel with no repercussions.
---
Rank is worthless and there is no reason to care about it. Just play what you want and stay at whatever rank you end up at
---
The first will probably be more useless for more skilled killers. What about if your hook your obsession the first, you get a permanent speed buff of 3/4/5%.
---
Wait until you hit rank 12-13. Hope you bought the hag and got Hex:Ruin if you want to even **consider** playing anyone but nurse or billy.
---
True, it may decrease their profit margin per unit, but having an interesting product may boost their overall sales. They would be making less of a profit per sweater, but they would be selling far more and they would be making their fan base happier in the process.
---
The thing is, literally every single gaming community thinks that theirs is the most toxic. WOW thinks they’re the most toxic, Overwatch thinks they’re the most toxic, LoL *and* DotA both think they’re the most toxic, etc. etc. So when you see someone say, “Our community is really toxic,” It’s like hearing them say water is wet. Toxic is just the Internet’s default tone.
---
Every time I use a map offering there’s a survivor that puts one on as well... and the entity always gives the survivor their choice of map :.(
---
Hmmm I’d say it’s closer to 4.2 salt, maybe 4.3 salt.
---
Credit cards are standing by
---
I didn't say that Noed is OP or a problem to me but it is actually a problem for the killer that is running it. They get to the endgame almost every match since they don't know and don't care how to actually play the game at high level and how to put pressure on gens and always rely on Noed to get them some kills and thats a gg for them.
---
It’s a joke on the comment the survivor made...
---
"Is this the first time ya'll got spanked by Scatched Mirror" loved it, A+
---
And the heal from being hooked (dying state to injured when unhooked) for a total of two health states
---
it was a stupid joke op
---
don’t take politics to this sub
---
It also is useless if you dont make it to endgame, or arent being chased at that exact second and it makes you exhausted so half the time it hinders you. The survivors have to earn adrenaline by completing their main objective
---
NOED gives you free instadowns and tons of endgame map pressure for essentially doing nothing and losing your main objective. The only way to stop NOED if waste several minutes finding and cleansing totems that serve no other purpose
---
I wouldn't call it very very easy. lol  Also, what crutch perks did you use the first time you hit rank 1?  Did you SWF?
---
Nope, just a checkbox for Fullscreen. It's obscenely annoying when you have two monitors but can't switch over to the other one because DbD locks your mouse into its window.
---
Try the application Borderless Gaming. I used it for Nier: Automata, and see no reason why it wouldn't work for DbD. I'm gonna try it when I get home.
---
I didn’t swf and my load out is borrowed time, well make it , self care and dead hard wbu bro ?
---
*Raises hand* Fuck no professor, they sure don't!
---
And raising entirely new ones.
---
&gt;Noed on the other hand rewards killers for sucking the whole match
---
You can't say NOED rewards killers, and Adrenaline rewards survivors, without saying that Adrenaline punishes killers for not doing their job, and that NOED punishes survivors for not doing totems.
---
I slugged one person ones and it was because 0 gens were done she was the only one left and she just sneaked around the map for 10 minutes or maybe 15 minutes so when I found her I slugged her until she had 1 second left and hooked her to get the points
---
To quote Socrates, “Big oof.”
---
I mean even I personally don’t like farming as a killer unless there are DC’s. Instead I’ll just play with my food a bit yknow. Pretend I don’t see that person healing and instead go for the healthy survivor or whatever. If your confident your doing well there’s no real need to tunnel people to shit. Just play normal it really doesn’t matter if you get the 4K because your still likely gonna walk out of there with at least 60-100k points anyway.
---
I recommend you to try Bond instead
---
I used to run empathy for the same reason, then one day I swapped it for Bond just to try it. 6 months latter, Bond is my favourite perk.
---
Thx :)
---
I would buy Feng's sweater in a heartbeat, plz BHVR
---
Freddy’s not bad. He’s a hard killer and takes a different skill set to master. He’s not for everyone, not should he be. I used him for over a month and was quite good with him. It’s all about the perks that work with his abilities. If they buff him i might have to go back to playing as killer and crush it.
---
What is that about the opera?
---
Lol wtf is political about that? Oh right you are one of those PC SJWs that get offended by everything
---
The same happens to me.. It also happens more often when I use a Cake/Pudding. It's some sort of curse
---
Theories? What he states is all true. You can't finish one game Without being called numerous insults from the other team, luckily for me I got little when I started playing and usually just from one player. Seeing as I play on console. 
---
and if "OchidoIsBestDBDPlyr" as you state, this doesn't surprise me. You're probably the exact person OP is talking about.
---
It is an dark time comrade
---
If they're old enough to phase then they're legal
---
How did you receive notification of the bans end date?
---
Survivors badly need a BP buff, ffs
---
fortnite is a better game anyways
---
how can i be a pc sjw i’m just pointing out that a political comment maybe isn’t appropriate for a video game subreddit
---
and yes it is political because inserting “pro choice” into there for no reason makes your motives questionable
---
I didn't bm, he said he did it for "swag".
---
Oh, then no they won't do much for you. When there is one person left tho, those sound cues can be nice. Just don't count on them
---
When I tried to load the game up while banned, it stayed on the "Press Space" screen but popped up with a bar listing my ban reason, and its end date.
---
"free Karma"? Lol with these downvotes that aint happening at all bud
---
Vape man
---
The amount of frames that have frozen for you to get to this point. Fair play
---
I know on palerose on the boat it's a big indicator but that's it. Perk worth it?
---
and a good joke calls for good timing not just being edgy for edgy’s sake op
---
I hate this bug so much :( it just makes the trial unplayable. They only just acknowledged the bug on Twitter this week for the first time. It’s been in the game since Plague? Or legion?
---
You need jesus.
---
Date ended now? And you can play ptb?
---
Really sucks if you can't participate
---
So it's massacre because oh no gay? Grow up dude
---
They need to change scratch marks to bright  green, it would be a little refreshing
---
Bunny Feng too.
---
Prob main Feng if it ever comes out (sorry Meg).

Sloppy butcher to stop survivors from healing

Play me ;)
---
The overwatch suspensions are automatic aside from cheating and abusive chat. I've been suspended for throwing on one account when I didn't even throw, it was because I was playing Widowmaker
---
the hag wants to know your location
---
What would the tokens do? Stop the alert like the perk does now?
---
StEaLtHy.... enough said...
---
Because we wanna play the game...?
---
the father the son and the holy spirit
---
The real question here is how were they able to write in the chat post game after they dc’ed ?
---
Because Freddy totally needs even more counters. No thanks.
---
Straight tunnel and camp off a 3 man/4 gen start. Nope, not even going to let you try for a 2 hook rescue because I'm a fucking asshole and my mother loved my sister more than me and my dog loves my brother more than me as well.
---
I was talking about Makoto
---
Uuh YES!!!
---
not a sweater but yes
---
My idea of fun is fucking over kids who think they are edgy. The fact that you see something wrong with this shows you are one of them. But def keep the teabags at every pallet and exit gates warmed up; it def makes you a good player.
---
Yup, everyone who plays Claudette is some level of arrogant/asshole
---
The repost we expect.
---
*Its not a repost*
---
This toy has been posted here a thousand times.
---
*But I took the picture*
---
Still a repost. 
---
*Well I didnt know*
---
Competition between survivors is bad for the game, we see it all the time with the seasonal events
---
I do look for NOED, but if I can't find it and the killer is closing in while you're on the other end of the map I apologize but I am leaving.
---
*freddy dislikes this concept*
---
Now that looks balanced :3
---
if you play on console, your tv should have a setting where you can increase gamma.
---
I'd be fine with a shirt too
---
Calm down there fella
---
That is the opposite of what I have said
---
I say that non-stealthy survivors get punished
---
With Legion, comitting to one direction with your movement speed should allow you to quickly catch up &amp; hit a survivor with frenzy. Your lunge is long enough that you can usually snag a hit from survivors as they are dropping the pallet. 
---
You will definitely find better success with Doctor as he is a substantially better killer than Legion is. Especially if you are used to playing him.
---
Try chasing with the doctor during punishment mode &amp; then compare it to chasing a survivor using treatment mode. The 5% difference is noticeable &amp; in a chase its what can allow survivors to make an extra loop or 2 &amp; make pallets much safer.
---
A few hours on Legion is enough to fully grasp Frenzy &amp; play it well.  I wouldn't try mind games with Frenzy &amp; if a survivor runs to vault a window try get used to the lunge distance. Holding M1 gives you a massive lunge distance with Frenzy.
---
Nurse and Legion mains: I don't get it
---
How does it feel being the funniest person on this sub?
---
If you are unable to participate in discussions in good faith then stay off Reddit and similar platforms
---
Yeah. Every token would stop an explosion, so you'd have a guarenteed 2/3/4 prevented explosions after hitting 2/3/4 skill checks. The concept is just to make the prevented explosions more reliable instead of it just being a coinflip crapshoot.
---
Time to spam shrouds to root out the weak.
---
Thanks, I know what to remake next
---
Cool
---
If everyone on the same page, I might be down to go a little easier. But they aren’t. It sucks going easy on survivors just to have them complete all the gens in 4 minutes and teabag you on the way out.
---
Yea. Nope, not again. I’m just gonna play like I normally do unless there are 3+ BPS and they make it extremely clear they want to slow down.
---
I can understand that, to a degree.  I feel like it's harder for a killer to really get across if they care about the points or not, so they at least need to be trying to hunt people down for hooks.  It's just that, the other day especially, I had a decent amount of games in a row where I or someone else was purposefully tunneled or facecamped, early on, when there were still gens to be done.  And survivor side, the rush to escape as fast as possible is the norm as well, I still hate that it is so quick, or can be at least.  Like I said, I get not wanting to farm, but I really do think it's bullshit to just waste a party streamer during double BP weekend, it feels really easy to just tone it down for 4 days, that doesn't sound like asking for much.
---
Did they say anything about it?
---
Also one perk I would really like to have reworked is Ruin. It is too inconsistent. You can either find it within the first second or never see it the whole game. I believe if it were reworked to become more consistent then it would also be easier for the devs to balance.
---
I'm not gonna lie, this is totally me.
---
I mean I don’t specifically go out of my way to search for crows but it’s kind of hard not to notice there are crows flying off in the background.
---
It's not an uncommon bug. If you send a ticket to the support, they're usually nice about it and give BP.
---
&gt;  I read somewhere that you can grab the unhooking person like when someone goes over a pallette, but so far I haven't seen a prompt to do so? 
---
Click M1, but don't lunge, keep in mind you have to be close enough. I don't think there's a prompt.
---
That dog is gorgeous, I hope your matches go well.
---
lmao I don't know how many times I've hit people when they 360 and it doesn't register
---
ARRGGHHH REEYAAHH
---
And you’re being downvoted for stating the truth. How fucking dumb are people? This question is posted at least once a day.
---
oh god not the clown
---
I have a feeling you might be right about add ons if you don’t load In yeah, still think offerings tho though as they’re burnt before you load I’m, again you could be correct about add ons tho.
---
Says the guy with name, “penis-muncher785.”
---
Newb survivors are the worst. They’re just plain bad at the game and blame their badness on the killer. “Rheeeee you tunneled”. No dumbass, your teammate farmed you.
---
#s h h h
---
Nope. There is actually a build based around this to annoy the hell out of survivors.
---
the devs said t not report people for dc-ing because it automatically puts them in the system
---
There’s a difference between playing normally and playing like an ass, the latter happening much more often since the blood hunt started.
---
Tell that to Claudette.
---
Says the man who got caught.
---
I think that they should add a whole new category to the store to buy a new Mori animations they would make so much money from it
---
can confirm, when i play hag i've seen survivors let someone die on 1st hook because they are afraid to go unhook
---
not to mention they always suicide going for totems instead of just sucking it up
---
It doesnt affect your bp in any way. Bps are additive not multiplicative.
---
For example:
---
25k match
---
+25k for BBQ or WGLF
---
+25k for each BPS (or your cake/pudding)
---
+25k for event.
---
Use your bos whenever, it isnt "better" to use them during bp events.
---
killers like to use events like this as a chance to troll and ruin peoples fun 
---
thats the gist of it
---
I'd like to see Killers be given more tools to pressure gens, rather than slow them down. Currently you have to create more objectives for Survivors to stop them from working on gens: hook someone and now a person has to go save, if people are injured and feel under threat, they'll heal before returning to a gen. If Killers have more ways of creating different objectives, it slows the game down without making it boring. I think the reason Survivors ignore the secondary "objective" of totems is because it's just more M1ing in a corner. Objectives for Survivors need to be varied and interesting. Killers need to have the power to create these objectives.
---
Maybe the game checks if it is he who's playing the game, so if the hatch must spawn it spawns as close to him as possible.
---
I did, and although most would find it frustrating, it was super fun. She didn't even have any perks)(it was in the game map) and she absolutely slaughtered us. 5 gens, blinking back and forth murder
---
Blaming the killer for their own poor plays is not just restricted to noob survivors. Seems to be the default stance for about 50% of the player base.
---
I have never seen an overwhelming toxicity in this game. This game is based around using addons and a lot of them mean you can outright kill all four players easily, if you understand that it's really not bad to just die in a round, it should be expected. Not only that but the killer can tunnel or camp a single survivor which is really frustrating. When this happens round after round it just gets more and more frustrating. Yesterday I started playing killer since I literally could NOT make ANY bloodpoints as a survivor. Fucking nothing, we got destroyed every match. So I started playing and did the same exact thing that happened to me every match, I would kill all four of them relatively early and they would all post salt post game. One of them was a streamer and I tuned in to hear "this is one of those games that makes this game not worth playing and it sure as hell isn't enjoyable". The reality of this game is that it is so unbalanced that a lot of times one side has the advantage and it feels like complete bullshit. On top of that, both sides can "bully" the other side, although it is much easier to camp than it is to learn how to loop. The 2x event is bringing out the worst in people as it is literally more worthwhile to DC then to stay in the game and once you are down people you have even less of a chance but the killers are trying just as hard. Occasionally there is a sweaty survivor/killer but the last day and a half to put it bluntly have been fucking disgusting and I have never seen it as unenjoyable as it has been.
---
This must be a console only thing
---
Learn how to write properly.
---
Absolutely. Solo queues you can easily factor in several extra minutes before all of the gens are done just by virtue of survivors getting spooked and hiding, not knowing where a gen is, two survivors going for a hook rescue, etc. Against an SWF as soon as the killer is spotted by anyone then everyone is on a gen. When someone is on a hook they identify who is closest and everyone else just keeps doing gens, etc etc. You really can't make any mistakes against em.
---
LOL don’t worry, this happened on PC when legion came out. never posted the vid tho
---
My idea for it would just be to add a cooldown. The next gen explosion will be averted, but that can only happen every 60 seconds, something like that.
---
its a meme is not an excuse for homophobia 
---
maybe stop hating gay people and grow up before telling other people to calm their tits
---
I never run ruin but then again I'm just grinding blood points this weekend and so don't mind if the games are faster, i still end up ~100k bps. (R10 killer)
---
Survs can do it after a dc (normal on purpose) they cant do it when the killers dcs
---
His hair... Wack!
---
His gear... Wack!
---
His Skills... Wack!
---
His anti-looping skills... Wack!
---
His ability to stop chasing... Wack!
---
r/namechecksout
---
A beautiful woman's heart can always be a powerful weapon...
---
Maybe bloodpoint bonuses for the entire team if you do well in a set amount of time? Or extra points for playing with your team?
---
since when the survs can message the killer?
---
didn't play for almost a year and a half and didn't see that option this days.
---
no i meant the thing at the top is not a sweater
---
Dude he's getting a full scale rework soon.
---
The devs said that they have something going on.
---
Not too sure what they meant by that though
---
I'm sure he'll Survive
---
He’s barely making it through as it is what do you mean D:
---
Dwight, you definitely did not prove thyself
---
Yeah man stop the wallhacks 😂
---
Considering he has a ground up rework on the way. He won't have to suffer for long
---
Slugging ain't toxic...
---
Ooof my dude. You won’t believe the salt my Lady Lisa can bring forth from survivors. 
---
I have to say the being accused of being toxic by shutting down loops with a trap is new though XD.
---
Right, and how does one improve so the killer doesn't automatically know where you are. Which is what I've been saying. I could crouch walk the entire time and the killer will beeline straight to me from across the map. I don't understand what people mean by "looping" the killer. I can't outrun him, and vaulting seems to slow and ineffective since he can hit through the object. I've tried running circles around things, but he still easily catches me. I've tried tricking him and doing a swift cut turn to get behind him, but he swings before I can actually get anywhere. Sometimes I can get away, but sometimes I'm a one hit down in the beginning of matches. Maybe I'm being placed against killers way above my survivor level. Cause my perks just aren't all that great, lol. 
---
This said, the game is fun, and probably more so if I had more friends playing it. I just don't want to be dead and down in the first 30 seconds of a game.
---
That's literally what a full scale rework is
---
If "gorgeous" means "looking at it hurts my eyes" then yeah.
---
I agree with you, but some people think it is.
---
Well even he couldn't piss me off half as much as these DCs!
---
If your playing on PC you can use Nvidia experimental settings and add a brightness overlay
---
I like the idea. Personally I am a fan of Stake out style Perks and wish there were more of them
---
The why specifically have a report for rage-quitting?
---
You thought it was Mori but it was me, Shroud!
---
That's one nicely brushed ego.
---
Good work. Keep it up.
---
Sometimes it really do be like that
---
Because people don't like being outplayed, that's it. Looping is not toxic and has never been that - unless you teabag at every pallet and do the annoying flashlight clicky thing. Relax.
---
For real though every time I burn a BPS the killer will hook me and stay nearby so as soon as I get unhooked he comes back and puts me right back up on it and then does it again and I leave with 3k turned 6k max and he gets to leave with 20k min turned into probably 60k and I don't understand why everyone would rather play with a playstyle that griefs players than one that gets more blood points (like chasing someone else)
---
I reported a killer for doing this. I believe it counts as holding the game hostage
---
Worse, it's the crapper
---
Play the way I want guys REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Really should've stuck to one. But gg lol
---
I know survivors get salty because of tunneling, but it’s an actual strategy. For example, if they get unhooked why would you go after the filled heals one when you can get the injured one easier and get him/her to their second hook.
---
You must feed on their tears my friend. It’s the only way to thrive as a killer main.  Drink their trolly tears until your hydrated and bottle some up for next match muhahahahahahha!
---
At the beginning of the ptb it was 3 minutes but they changed it because it was too long, so they're updating it to two minutes
---
Noed is also a complete waste if you don't get to end game, but survivors will still call you a no skill noed user after you get a 4k.
---
I don't think it's that; if someone deliberately plays more toxic to deny people of points when setting them though, that sucks.
---
I've been facecamped first hook over people bringing in BPS. There's definitely a "gotta ruin people's chances" mentality with some.
---
“Marty, I’m scared”

Farming with Freddy is a bit.... Awkward.
---
In this case I would give him (played with him as well, and he DCd against trapper) a pass.
---
I can appreciate a good window fake if you aren't teabagging me afterwards lol
---
I knew about Chainsaw Myers and survivors running a splinter to force the killer to play Perkless Freddy but never heard of a killer running survivor perks.
---
You said the entity but that doesn't look like nea ???????
---
That could actually encourage me to join a club, but I have to wonder if this feature would encourage the formation of 4 man SWF groups. If those become too prevalent (only 5% of matches have these groups currently) and prove to be too powerful it could lead to survivor nerfs that really hurt solo players.
---
Yeah, thats literally how they got to red ranks
---
Had to vs the same Wraith several times last night and they got increasingly toxic. DC'd the third game because a hooked survivor got away when gates were opened, we were all about to leave and got booted. 
---
Console is a fantastic place.
---
But … they can’t distinguish between leaving through the menu and an actual crash?
---

---
All of this noed shit started away before MoM came to the game...
---
Trapper main here!  It’s all about owning your turf.  Pick your side of the map and corral survivors onto it.  Never gets old when survivors burn through 3 genies super fast and get overconfident when they are playing right into my hand.
---
What does prayer beads have to do with a DC? Does it make your internet shitty or something?
---
Yea that's annoying as killer.
---
I can't find a game on PS4 :(
---
To be blunt, I’m doing that because I intend to prestige that character and want to actually try those add-ons before I lose them.
---
This. I get miffed from the tbagging, and not actually from skillful escapes
---
oh for sure, for farming I'd say knock it out altogether tbh. Just gets to a point where you want to actually play, and you only get 1 chase before a gen or two pops, and it feels like they snowball too fast for you to catch up.
---
Then your totem gets popped instantly anyway.
---
Tbh I’ve been rank 1 a few times now and only went against my first scratched mirror a few days ago. Then two games after had scratched mirror on ormond the poor bastard. 
---
You rarely see it now. I do have one ready in my inventory though just waiting on a game or lery’s offering.
---
Congrats my dude!
---
It's the only game where you expect the other side to play fair. I played 7 years of League and still think DBD has a worse community.
---
Isn’t there a bug around that can cause player models to become invisible? Someone posted an invisible Claudette cleansing a totem a week or so ago.
---
*4 stocks the killer*
---
It's $10 for ONE outfit. I get that the devs need financial support, but I wish they'd reasonably price everything like their old clothing DLCs.
---
Wild guess. Is it for a tattoo?
---
