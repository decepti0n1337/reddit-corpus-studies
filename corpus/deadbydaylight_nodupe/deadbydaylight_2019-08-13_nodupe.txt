Really, how is stream sniping even a thing on this game, with the lottery system they have it‚Äôs very unlikely your gonna get that person and the off chance that you do, so what take your lickings and move on, it‚Äôs not the end of the world, then to get them a second time is even higher! Plus doesn‚Äôt twitch have a delay on the feed?

I agree. Doppio best boi.

Do you have any tips how to play against hex: ruin? I seem always to lose against it. My winratio is probably 40% but somehow I'm rank 8. I don't get it. I'm so bad at the game I should be like rank 17...

Wait are you Ghostface or the Grandma?

Love the negativity dude but if I wasn‚Äôt running noed I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to humiliate this poor Claudette tho /:

I'm gonna let you know you suck and there's nothing you can do about it. You are trash and the game and need free kills.

Woah! You got sell his features this is incredible! Good work.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I went back and skimmed through your comment again and i thought maybe you were just a triggered survivor but honestly you're riding dick so hard it seems like you're a dev. If that's the case, can you do me a favor and stop being an asshole? I really hope you are a dev because you took that criticism to heart lo
---
The fact that you won't read the entire comment, and removed your original post doesn't give you much credibility. It makes you look like you're not open to any opinions but your own.
---
Yes, skins cost money, but they are not essential to gameplay. If you had read my entire comment, you would have understood the purpose of the skins, why they cost money, and why it's good for the game. And if you choose not to buy them, or disagree, then you can just not buy them, and it's a non-issue.
---
All of the unlicensed content in this game can be acquired for free. You can purchase all of the unlicensed killers and survivors, and even the licensed perks for iridescent shards, which you earn by playing the game. This costs nothing but your time. Only the licensed characters require your money.
---
Just because I disagreed with your original comment doesn't make me an asshole. I took the time to explain and respond to a number of the concerns you brought up. You're showing your hand by resorting to baseless insults. I'm not a game dev. Sorry to disappoint you.

Adrenaline takes skill doe üòÇüëå
---
ahhhh you mad
---
It's the opposite for me (or maybe just xbox), killer always takes longer. Even in the day i can get into a game as a survivor pretty quickly. 
---
Also i would LOVE if they had a single player mode like Ft13. They could do so much with all the killers they have but i honestly have no faith in that happening unless someone buys them out lol
---
They need to be paired with the highest rank in the group since they already have a big advantage (swf) period.
---
If I get all four of my stacks I win. I'll be happy the rest of the match no matter what happens.

---
You shouldn't have press anything to struggle. Please, for god's sake, get rid of the struggle phase already. I would like to not have to mash my keyboard or tire my finger out scrolling the mouse wheel.
---
Kinda like NOED *thinking emoji*
---
You should change your name, light would have figured out a clever way to kill spirit. He‚Äôd never go to a public forum to cry about her.
---
Bbq is a waste on the Hag, she doesnt have the mobility to make use of it. Noed is trash, its better to lose a game and learn from you mistakes than getting cheap kills with noed. It doesnt help you get better. 
---
If you have monitor &amp; abuse, slap that on her along with Nurses or Make Your Choice. Sloppy Butcher is a nice perk on her and Ruin is essential. 
---
Other than that, someone suggested watching Space Coconut. He has a guide where he details the Hag fully, Id recommend watching it.

try again honey: the hook breaks before the killer can hook, 1-second cooldown, also effects basement hooks

Problem being, I'm new to playing killers, just finished with the cannibal, so I don't have the luxury of all those perks
---
rancor
---
Speech 100
---
But if I kill 3 toxic survivors by being toxic then that means I got rid of two toxic players in total
---
I play both and I don't care if you play with noed.
---
Nice
---
The doctor didn't hold the game hostage because the game could still be ended. That's what the Developers called holding the game. If there is absolutely no way for the game to be ended then it is held hostage
---
whens the perk that's going to stop the no exit gate collision glitch going to be released?
---
I'd watch Youtubers, personally.
---
I started watching Tru3Ta1ent, but as long as they're a solid player, you'll learn tips and tricks like which loops are solid, best ways of juking, how the killers think, how survivors think...
---
I went from a rank 17 killer to a rank 12, and rank 18 survivor to rank 14 in less than a month. It helps watching other people doing it.
---
why are you big mad about this, just use the so called overpowered survivor perks or cleanse the totem you dork
---
Rank 1s are either the most wholesome people or they will use it in every situation to back themselves up and convince you you're wrong despite them being wrong
---
10/10 would eat
---
This needs more upvotes
---
Someone tell the devs! Imagine if we could get her to voice herself :)
---
The problem is, as I've said numerous times... it's not supposed to balanced like that lol. And even if it was... I'll be damned if I'm gonna run at the killer hoping the other 3 teammates do the same thing at the same time lol
---
To build upon your sentiment, collecting the required amount of shards for killers/survivors doesn‚Äôt actually take too long either time-wise.
---
I earn about 2000 shards every two to four weeks with only a few hours a week.
---
It's like playing with training wheels on, or a safety net.
---
yea but if the devs release it than they cant make the excuse that they aren't aware of anything
---
In the end, I won.
---
I love Biscotti.
---
Idk the real ghostface was already pretty clumsy in Scream, it was part of the joke
---
the only fix is to change their names from legion to the scene kids
---
Yeah, well, that's just like, your opinion, man.
---
Why is rank 20 killer getting matched up with rank 15 survivor?
---
I just hate my camera jolting all over when I alert the shiiiit.  I don't have time to crouch walk right now, they are 10 feet behind me already.
---
It certainly doesnt.
---
Do gens.
---
Maybe a special attack that cripples survivors?
---
They both have a built in insidious, why would you bring that perk?
---
Totems are sort of supposed to serve as a secondary objective but they aren‚Äôt very interesting.
---
I‚Äôve seen more Claudettes fall into this category that dweet
---
Probably a she. EnTitty
---
I'd insult you further, but your post is enough of an insult to yourself.
---
How is gona cleanse this, the Killer ? Cuz survs can cleanse the totems.
---
Not the same bruh
---
im actually thinking that there are  only rank 20s at this subreddit
---
Hex ruin is incredibly strong on any killer, that's a hag perk. Sloppy butcher is available to all killers by default, and it's amazing on legion. The legions perk discordance is pretty good for her as well. You could consider bbq from bubba for bloodpoints as well as some aura reading, but really up to you.
---
Thank you:)
---
It's called the End-Game Collapse. The killer must have closed the hatch, which allows the survivor to open the exit gates regardless of how many gens are done. Killers can also open exit gates.
---
It would be  a wasted perk slot on Ghostface because he has built in insidious while being able to move with pig it would only be a bit more useful as she doesn't need to crouch which slows her but it would still be pretty bad .
---
Wow that's crazy.
---
Highly bannable...
---
This Guy got a legacy Claudette and does this stuff ?, Maybe a cosmetics cheater...
---
Hmmm. I honestly don't know. He's such a basic enemy really all he does is punch, grab and rip off heads. Lol.
---
But he looks cool :(
---
*finger guns intensifies*
---
Probably because she's not very powerful or underpowered, she's in a good spot, so people don't really complain about her.
---
It‚Äôs hard finding people who understand how to play casually and not going all out.  I know whenever me and my friends use bloody party streamers and escape cakes and all that we just fuck around trying to help everyone (killer included)  get as much blood points as possible. T-bagging is stupid.  I don‚Äôt do it unless it‚Äôs to get a killers attention in a serious match.
---
I've noticed it's the mostly the really bad killers who use NOED. So that's probably why they don't get any respect ... they haven't earned it. 
---
If we're popping gens and escaping chases with ease, I start doing totems. Most good killers don't need it.
---
Holy shit I jumped
---
I think veteran killers shun it because in order for it to have any use, all 5 gens must be completed, or 3 survivors must be dead and you close the hatch, triggering EGC. If you're a good killer, you'll ideally never reach either of those, especially if you bring a more useful perk that makes you a better killer during the earlier parts of the match.
---
Dude I'm red rank my friends are not, some are yellow. I'm always the host and it was pretty unfair. Lmao imma keep being host so they'll suffer.
---
Just dc, i mean it can Happen to lagswitcher
---
As far as I can tell, Easy Anti-cheat only closes the game and doesn't report anything, you shouldn't get in any trouble
---
My karma is actually going out the window
---
No, just don't post hundreds of already used memes and threads about "SuRvIor bAd"
---
To build on what you're saying (i actually don't use reddit idk if i should reply to you or him lol) That's bullshit. I also didn't remove anything, if i did how the fuck would you reply? 
---
Now ignoring the dick riding and you basically saying this game is pay to win (since i never said that but you keep bringing it up i guess there must be some truth to it, which i guess make sense) you actually taught me something really important, i didn't know you could use shards to buy characters that's great!.....except when i checked i see that they actually cost 9k shards. So as this guy said, 2k shards every 2-4 weeks means that maybe you can get one in a few months. I've played for about a month (and played A LOT) And i have 6k. So really the argument i made still stands because the price is so fucking high. That's 9x8 which is 72k shards. Assuming I've been playing exactly a month that's 72/6 which is 12. So a year of playing as actively as i am now means ill be able to get everyone currently in the game. That's really kind of fuck you because they really should be free anyway. Imagine if overwatch did this
---
So thanks for the tip, at least i know now that i can get legion for free instead of wasting money on a shitty character but please please PLEASE get the devs dick out of your mouth. And not just them, anyone. Don't justify anti consumer bullshit because you like the game. And more importantly don't justify the game being shitty when it could be better! I mean you are the ultimate dick rider and you still couldn't bring yourself to say the game didn't need to be re balanced, so imagine how the fans feel? 
---
Also just to reiterate, 72k shards and growing
---
Today is the worst day for this stuff. You're gonna see tons of high ranks queueing up with their low rank friends (who are also high rank players) trying to get to a high rank today. 
---
This is known as boosting and happens in every game! It just so happens to concentrate before the 13th for bdb.

The devs actually released a statistical analysis that shows Huntress and Nurse have extremely low kill percentiles.
---
I was a Freddy main before the changes and loved him and think what they did to him now is fine. I really love playing against him now. It's really a lot of fun. He's not broken you are, gg
---
Good advice until u remember adrenaline is a thing
---
I read that as ‚Äúcrotch dancing‚Äù which almost makes sense because of T-bagging
---
Playing Dead by Daylight automatically makes you gay.
---
Excuse me, filthy killer main, I'll have you know adrenaline is the most skillful perk in the game. For one, the fact that it is an exhaustion perks means you run a CALCULATED RISK while playing it with another exhaustion perk, and if you don't play other exhaustion perks then you just suck. Another thing, if there is no loops on the side of the map that you are on when it triggers then you are going to take a hit (or go down if the killer has NOED) so basically it's useless in like... 75% of situations? Sure, we'll go for that. And finally, the fact that you cannot control when your *fair* insta-heal triggers while you are in a chase unless you are in cahoots with all other survivors means that you are not ready for it and will probably go down anyways. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
---
/s
---
Tbh they got better really quick, it helped them a lot. Yeah I can imagine, I want everyone to have fun and that's pretty rare especially when it comes to swf.
---
Getting on now!!
---
Ditto. It's happened to us so many times that my friends and I live in fear of a killer disconnecting if we're doing too well. Just this morning I purposefully let the killer sacrifice me because I was afraid she was going to rage quit after we repaired 5 generators without her getting a single hit, let alone a sacrifice.
---
I'm also frequently compelled to be altruistic IRL, so I was probably suffering from bleeding-heart-syndrome.
---
You came to the wrong place, this Reddit is even worse than the game chat. Most people who are going to respond to you are going to be toxic if not much worse just wait.
---
Just spent a million prestigious new, felt good.
---
I think Legion is one of the weakest killers in the game, so yes I would want to buff him. Here's what I got:
---
So first of all, I would still keep what he has now with his power, when you begin your frenzy you can vault windows faster than normal killers and vault pallets and when you hit a survivor they have to mend themselves within 15 seconds or they will go down.
---
Now for the changes: 
---
**When the Legion hits a survivor twice while in frenzy, the survivor's movement speed is slower for about 3 seconds.** This will work like Clown's bottles or Freddy's snares and it will also make up for Legion's long cooldown after using his/her frenzy by helping him/her keep up with survivors after using the frenzy and maybe even give him a slight advantage in chases.
---
**When the Legion hits a survivor who needs to mend while in feral frenzy, their deep wound timer goes down by 10 seconds.** This one could probably be debatable but I think since Legion has to wait for his/her power to fully charge back up, this could be necessary.
---
**When every survivor needs to mend themselves, all generators and exit gates are blocked by the entity for 40 seconds.** This would actually reward Legion for managing to hit everyone with his frenzy in one frenzy and it would give him/her more game slowage potential as 15 seconds to mend isn't that much and if survivors are in Legion's terror radius their timer stops.
---
I also have a 2 addons I'd like to rework:
---
Frank's Mixtape: **Every time the Legion begins his frenzy, all survivors auras are revealed to him/her for 4 seconds.** This would help give Legion better map pressure as he/she would know where all survivors are right away and can go to them; kind of similar to Barbecue and Chili. Also, since I wanna make the mend bar going down after each frenzy hit part of his base kit, this addon should be changed.
---
Stab Wounds Study: **When a survivor that has been hit by feral fenzy 2 times gets put on their second hook, your vault speed is increased by 6%.** Ever since Legion's rework, this addon hasn't really been that useful because survivors can mend within a survivor's terror radius without worrying about it going down and plus they can still keep mending even if their timer runs out anyways. I think this change could give this addon some more use and actually give people a reason to use it.
---
Someone sent me this message after randomly stumbling upon one of my very recent posts in this subreddit. I am new here.
---
NoMitherSabo Squad is stupid fun, but maaaaaaaaaan does it tilt killers.
---
They do, it just there's a vocal majority here in our little subreddit family that like to cry on every post about it.
---
Outside of reddit posters, majority of killer players use it an don't give a singular shit how anybody else feels about their perk choices, at any rank.
---
And why should they? Outside of reddit and the made up rules and bullshit honor code we came up with, the Devs leave the perk unchanged, hell they *buffed* it not too long ago to give exposed at all tiers.
---
That right there, is more then enough for the non-forum going player to continuously use it an not care at all about how much people cry and complain to them.
---
Those players make up the majority of the playerbase, an that's why the perk will most likely never get an actual "nerf" or "rework" regardless of how "unskilled/lazy/sloppy/bullshit" of a perk it is to use.
---
It garentees pressure on non gen objectives, and the pay off is huge in comparison to not having it.
---
It's hands down a top 3 perk choice for it's utility and game stall, regardless of much people belittle those that use it.
---
So disrespect them all you want, you'll never stop anyone from using it, an apparently the Devs like it as is.
---
I use it on my Trapper occasionally, but I'd also argue he's the only one that sort of needs it sometimes. Gotta get as much time between gens as possible on that ol' boy.
---
Next live stream have a ton of people question the team about their views on it, gather what you can, an maybe we can garner enough of a case as to why it needs a change besides using insults to people that use it to why it needs such a change.
---
Yeah
---
People take the game too seriously. That‚Äôs why you get the toxic post game chat. 
---
There are some things in this game that are seriously unfun though.
---
Yea but that's skewed by the amount of shit nurses there are. Nurses kill rate on PC is also super low, but it's still the consensus best killer
---
*DLC protagonist from Outlast wants to: know your location*

Good job johdudeNL

Both the official forums and their discord is just hot garbage. For a game about violence, killing, murder and gore you really have to walk on eggshells in those places.
---
"they haven't earned it"
---
I was playing just last night, and hooked every survivor twice. The exit gates are powered, I caught two and sacrificed them. Guess what? In post game I got insulted, because I'm apparently trash for not getting all 4. I played fair, I walked to other sides of the map after unhooking, and I thought I did pretty damn well to hook everyone that amount of times. But no, I'm still "trash".
---
I wasn't using NOED btw, so I apologise if this is off topic.
---
But even when respect is earned, the community can still be toxic shits and rarely respect anyone except for themselves.
---
Lol!! WHERE ARE THE DAMN HOOKS!!!
---
Sounds like a tunnel to me lul
---
It looks like it‚Äôs way past your bedtime kiddo
---
Preventing NOED solo is horrible, you either take one of two garbage perks to find totems or sacrifice a toolbox or a medkit for a map. There‚Äôs also no guarantee that they‚Äôll even be running NOED. It‚Äôs a piss poor perk design.
---
 I'm not 100% sure. Id say give him a passive ability based on his hooking that way he would be a killer that promote juggling instead of tunneling. 
---
 First 2 hooks : Basic Attacks apply hemorrhage
---
 Next 2 hooks : Action speed boost (as in breaking pallets faster, vaulting a bit faster, even walking a bit faster)
---
 Final two hooks : Injured survivor's auras are revealed within a certain distance (Not a very long one since that would be a bit too powerful) but it would give survivors a reason to want to heal and make them not want to do gens for that reason.
---
Definitely need to look behind you when you‚Äôre running away.
---
Love that show. She was my favorite part watching it as a teen.

---
Killers like their easy kills
---
I‚Äôm never coming back here again would be a great way to keep the remaining survivors in game. Many games have started with one person dc‚Äôing just for the next person to kill themselves on the hook.
---
hi rory i‚Äôd love one!!
---
I can‚Äôt even reach rank 14 üò≠ I get shitty teammates all the time
---
Something like that would never be allowed to be made today with how politically incorrect it is, but it's so fucking good.
---
When is the new chapter?
---
What I meant by solo surv is that most people wanna play in an SWF because solo is horrible
---
You‚Äôd be surprised about how many red rank killers are potatoes, survivors too
---
ding dong!
---
Really? You guys all act like it‚Äôs a big deal! Get over it! If you don‚Äôt like being streamed sniped then don‚Äôt ply and don‚Äôt stream period! Most you streamers are toxic scumbags anyways and deserve to get sniped every now and then! Besides don‚Äôt they have a delay on the streams????
---
And what add on shouldn't be brown? I can't think of the one your talking about.
---
I didn‚Äôt link it because it‚Äôs not some political discussion it‚Äôs a mechanic in a video game.  I know that linking things helps make a point.  Obviously.
---
you're the type of person to dodge a lobby when 3+ survivors load in at the same time aren't you?
---
Waylon Jennings, bruh.
---
Or a way to get tokens back
---
The one that makes it so 6 seconds after uncloaking, no terror radius and red stain. A must for sneaking up.
---
good username
---
Sadly, there are programs (black listed ones, of course) that allow you to always enter someone else's specific lobbies. Griefers use it to locate a specific killer main lobbies they want to harass. It happened recently to Tru3t41ent for 16 days in a row until devs took action.
---
It needs a buff. There is only three tokens and they get used way to fast.
---
saddest part is thats devour hope
---
You are pretty much right. She is on the weak side but fun to play.
---
just cracking a joke, like your meme did  ‚óî\_‚óî
---
Why are you still lurking on this post? You are oddly obsessed with gay people.
---
It is rough in all ranks. I had the same issues today. 5 matches in a row i died on first hook. De piped in each match except the last (last hooked). A majority of the matches my teammates were barely helping. Just crawling around the walls of the map. At the end of the matches I was expecting I was expecting to see ranks 13 and above. Nope. Purples and red. Killer was usually in green ranks. I kinda felt like everyone was actively trying to de pip for some reason. The game play was just so bad all around. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Looking for validation online for your choice of game character is dumb. Just play the damn character. No one's cares who you play.
---
I mean, no mother is objectively terrible and largely sabotages your team because they have to rescue you.  Just get hit by killer then never heal and use iron will
---
Preach
---
Literally just asking if she‚Äôs worth the purchase with my shards but ok
---
billy is beautiful you watch your mouth
---
More like, any time a survivor has a decent perk, killer mains whine until it gets nerfed.
---
My strategy is to die about 10 minutes before the week ends, giving me enough time to end up in another trial.
---
Sure you died, but the Entity keeps bringing you back, you just have to not be dead when you're sent back.
---
She's one of my main killers, not because she's a fiercely good killer, but because she IS fun to play. Although she is considered to be a mid-tier killer, she has a lot of utility that you don't realize until you play her. For example, you know where a survivor is when they cleanse, you can instadown after using her power, you can tell when a survivor is working on a gen, or prevent gen rushing, etc. She takes some strategy to play, but she's easy to get the hang of.
---
Just the worst. I cant stand trappers that put down their traps in tall grass too. I cant see the traps how am I supposed to step into them?!
---
Depends on the player level, not necessarily the rank. The matchmaking uses rank, but ignores character level. So it's theoretically possible to go against a level 15 survivor (four perks) who is rank 17, etc. 
---
Kind of depends which rank you are. Also, matchmaking is not perfect and anomalies with the Survive With Friends matchmaking has been posted about before.
---
Yea I have the same question with the dream mode. I don't get what the point is....?
---
The plague is an interesting killer that forces the survivors to make a choice. Do you wanna be broken all game or give the plague a timed, but powerful ranged attack. She also slows the game down decently.
---
Imagine though, you could keep a flashlight, how cool is that?
---
Ignore this asshole, there's nothing wrong with asking for the opinion on whether or not a killer is currently worth buying. It'd be shitty to buy a killer just to find out for sure that they're garbage and unfun.
---
Definitely not on pig. I can't tell you about GhostFace.  Piggy has no TR when crouched AND you can still move around with no TR. I hope this isn't a  serious question..... ü§î
---
Yeah I don't what it does because I can see the killer now either way. What's the point with his lullaby?
---
Do I recognize this custom UI?
---
Yes, I know finding totems with or without perks and a map can take time, but once you play enough you learn places totems are more likely to spawn and you learn whether or not you want to make those choices. The entire game is about making the best choices in order to survive, like whether to heal or not or whether to search a chest to see if you can get a toolbox, so I think the symmetry of noed having a hard counter because a survivor decided to take time and get rid of it is nice. It's another choice you make to try and survive.
---
Do I think it's the best perk in the game, or that it should be run by every killer? Nah. Do I think it's piss poor perk design? Definitely not. Do I think killers should get ragged on just for running it? Also definitely not.
---
You want all tracking and gen protection. I would use pop goes the weasel, ruin, nurses calling, and stridor.
---
Is this from a YouTube clip?
---
Well it never said I didn't go in as a killer....so go in as wraith and keep the ability to go invisible?
---
But damn if it isnt funny sometimes
---
And became a meta slave in the process
---
[removed]
---
it opens room for vertical loops, that can be very strong
---
Couldn't put it better myself. People forget that this is just a game and take it as if not surviving or not getting many kills is the end of the world. There's also a divide in the community of killers and survivors - both sides are always fighting. There's also an extreme amount of entitlement in players. The game also became quite popular and the devs aren't sure how to handle the toxicity and honestly, nether do we. I'm also sure that the youth who play this game get influenced by other toxic YouTubers and streamers.
---
I‚Äôd agree if totems were a good secondary objective that granted anything other than BP in a category that I max out every game, but totems give the survivors nothing but the chance at preventing a perk that the killer might not even have. Also it‚Äôs less about finding the totems and more about not knowing if you‚Äôve got them all as you can only account for yourself, you have 0 idea what your other 3 teammates are doing. If small game or detectives hunch counted totems like TOTH then I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem but right now, as a solo, it‚Äôs a fucking migraine to get all the totems.
---
Lol!!! RIP
---
May I suggest another perk for this killer? I feel it fits. It would be called, ‚ÄúHex: Hemophilia‚Äù Torture and cruel memories of your past have taught you how to make your victims die easier and far more painfully. While the hex totem is still standing, any hit with your basic attack on a survivor will apply an un-mendable deep wound status effect. The deep wound status effect persists onto the last 1/2/3 survivors hit, and takes 60/50/40 seconds for the survivor to bleed out. Quote: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve suffered enough to know what true pain feels like. And soon, you will too.‚Äù -The Corpse
---
I feel like a small caveat to my previous post is in order; a Late Game Build (Something along the lines of Fire Up, Remember Me, NoED, and then another perk) is an acceptable way to use NoED while still being considered a "Good" Killer, but that's because you're trying to trade in the early and mid game for an extremely powerful (and extremely risky) late game.
---
There's a difference between going for the Hail Mary for fun, and just slapping it into your build because reasons.
---
This helped so much. He's more fun to play against now but man was that overwhelming when i was completely unaware lol
---
I don't know why but I feel offended as an Ace main
---
oh shoot, i‚Äôll fix that really quick,,, you might have to download it from my complete pack post
---
This makes sense. More fun now
---
Thank you
---
A special infected from L4D whould be nice, since they have Bill already.
---
Thank you!
---
I'd use that character
---
Lmfao. Oh I can‚Äôt wait for Rick and Monty to release a new season.
---
"Clever girl"
---
STFU
---
Yeah he is a lot better as well.  Some people are thinking top tier if used with mindgames properly with his teleport.  Bbq and pop seem especially powerful on him to keep up pressure. 
---
Lot better than he was that‚Äôs for sure.

on PlayStation it should be more than easy. you just go to the ps store from the home page, go to the search bar, and typing in "dead" should be enough to find the game. he can type in the entire thing if he needs to but it should be there. if it's not his PlayStation may have some sort of bug or something in which case he should contact PlayStation support
---
Hex:ruin and BBQ, thanatophobia and bamboozle.
---
Ruin and bbq are good on every killer(especially ones that have mobility like hillbilly)
---
Thanatophobia is really good on legion since you can injure the entire team with Feral Frenzy and at higher ranks, some survivors don't even bother  healing vs. legion.
---
Bamboozle increases speed for window and pallet vaults, it's neat but it can also block windows so it can shutdown killer shack and T-walls pretty fast. If you don't like bamboozle, you can use STBFL instead.
---
r/howtorotatetext
---
Sounds like something a killer main would say
---
Thanks buddy. That's crazy there were only three.
---
oh see really?
---
I mean... if you're a trash killer who camps, why would you expect anything different?
---
Yea I feel the same way. I have to force myself to play survivor. At least with killer, I can only blame myself for bad plays. That and holding M1 as your main objective gets boring real quick. I‚Äôm surprised there are as many survivor mains as there are TBH.
---
Loved the concept. Wish these posts got way more love
---
thank you &lt;3
---
I have the least amount of hours. I specifically specified I'm a survivor main, but you neglected my fact and downvoted. I have probably less then 12 hours on killer playing it 4 days straight.
---
The entire fight over the hatch mechanics has been fixed by the Endgame Collapse.  
---
If it's not broken, don't try to fix it.
---
What's the actual nerf?
---
Bing bong
---
10/10
---
I absolutely love distortion but it's one of those perks that deserve a buff
---
I'd rather they do this than the typical running around doing absolutely nothing
---
*raises hatchet* "YOU LIKE?"
---
The reason that Nurse's addons hinder her is because they screw with your muscle memory, which is the biggest asset for Nurse gameplay. The only addons that don't mess with muscle memory are Matchbox (increased chain blink window with no downside), Fragile Wheeze (+1 blink), and Plaid Flannel (baby blink training tool) - Every other addon alters the time it takes you to charge and the time it'll take you to move to a location which screws with muscle memory.
---
I have a prediction for the next three killer perks
---
Super woke - everytime a survivor throws a pallet, their aura is revealed for one second, has a cooldown of 5 minutes
---
Hex: imposing presence - survivors more than 8 meters away from the killer suffer from the exposed status effect, getting within 8 meters removes status effect from survivors, survivors are only exposed to normal attacks.
---
Persistence - while chasing a survivor, every 15 seconds of chase, gain a token, each token increases movement speed by 1 percent, when bloodlust activates all tokens are deleted.
---
I'll be hugging a gen
---
The game is called Dead by Daylight meaning that all trials take place during night-time.
---
I wouldn't say borrowed time is toxic as it only activates when in killers terror radius
---
Freddy has worse posture than Billy? Billy literally has scoliosis and walks with a huge limp. Hes always leaning to the side.
---
Die
---
Billy is just low budget bubba
---
Yeah it looked like David was running with Jake at a glance.
---
Thats tru i just use em to help out since im using no mither lol
---
Billy is just low budget bubba smh?
---
It opens up so many loop capabilities. Even without the sprint burst, the reduced stagger means you don‚Äôt have to be so afraid to drop, and if you do drop, it‚Äôs most likely not going to be as detrimental as if you wouldn‚Äôt have had it. On some maps, it can be a complete game changer.
---
New Killer: Grandma
---
I would like to see this in game. DEVS NAKE IT HAPPEN!
---
Why???
---
Ahh Bubba new face lookin good
---
Np
---
really?
---
BhVR needs to implement a color blind mode! Every other game out there has this! But that would probably add another 2-5 bugs or glitches into the game. Look at all the bugs we got now and returning ones after they were patched!
---
How is it bad to tap gens? It takes the killer longer to kick it than it takes tapping it as a survivor. Only time it can be harmful is when the killer is running Pop goes the weasel and tapping could give them the opportunity to double Pop a gen.
---
I tunnelled a Tapp with Huntress once and when he asked why all I said was "you husband now" and he immediately understood
---
Hahahahaha no who would do that hahahah do you have any links so i can laugh at it haha
---
Benedict Baker said that the sunrise never comes in the realm of the Entity. Just a gloomy fog and darkness.
---
oof
---
Yeah, I see that now. I‚Äôll add a token system in an edit. Thanks for pointing that out.

r/dbdgonewild

Congrats!
---
Yessssssssss! FRIDAY MEMES! Debo as da killer! fuck sign me up and take my money! He even had his own terror radius music in the movie and you know when he was coming! Just let him peddle around and up-to his victims! Shit this guy already has everything written out for him!
---
While I don‚Äôt enjoy playing with OwO I don‚Äôt see anything wrong using it with a flash light, and I‚Äôm glad to see mention of survivors who don‚Äôt teabag or drop that fucking gg ez (especially baby killer) since I feel like 97.53 percent of posts on this subs are just shitting on survivors who use strong perks
---
But when you DC your body lies dead on the ground in game
---
Doesn't Ghost Face stand up like a normal person? Also shouldn't he have the best back since he's one of the few who can crouch?
---
Ranks are screwed up i guess
---
I know! I remember the first time I watched this movie and that scene! The whole movie I was dying of laughter! 
---
‚ÄúWhat The Fuck You Stealing Box‚Äôs For?‚Äù Smokey...
---
But why is camping allowed );

I‚Äôm new to the game and didn‚Äôt know
---
Toxicity is very subjective and relative, personally I've noticed that you could be the nicest human being in the game but still have people be toxic towards you.  
---
Some people view certain things as annoying or toxic, Forcing players to change how they play because certain people get offended isnt really good.  
---
Some stuff I can understand, Like shit talking, unless its just banter doesnt really need to be done, but shit like teabagging and flashlight clicking, just ignore it.
---
Some people consider it toxic, others say it's just doing the objective. I agree with the latter, it's just rushing the obejctive and it's not really toxic.
---
What I don't agree with is people who say it's not a real thing. If you're so concerned with doing gens ASAP that you think cleansing totems is a waste of time, how is that not gen rushing?
---
It's prime time
---
For the same reason as you run it on any other killer. It either creates more time between gens, allowing more time to create pressure, rewarding more hits/hooks before the end game.
---
Or you get to garentee a kill or 2 for them plowing through the match so quickly nobody even gets to pip.
---
In the case of Ghostface/Meyers(whom I do not use) I'd anticipate they would use it to create more stalking opportunities as the Survivors will need to cleanse all totems to ensure NOED never arrives in the endgame, or else they avoiding getting stalked to exposed status only to gain exposed for rushing their primary objective.
---
It creates more time, or it punishes survivors for not creating more time.

I‚Äôm new and my first time playing the game is today
---
Lol ‚ÄúCan I Get a Amen Brother‚Äù
---
‚Ä¢ Trapper was tortured by the Entity too
---
‚Ä¢ Only Legion member that didn‚Äôt want to kill was Susie
---
‚Ä¢ Disagree with Pig since she does like killing people.
---
‚Ä¢ Plague isn‚Äôt crazy, she‚Äôs just devoted to her gods (The Entity in disguise) and sacrifices Survivors for her.
---
Looks like he does what I do, which is look around constantly while doing a gen then stops when the skill check audio cue plays, to focus on the skill check.
---
PepeHands
---
He actually gets plenty of exercise kicking pallets. Those legs may look like noodles, but do not be fooled, for it is an illusion.
---
Since you know, the killer was ghostface, it would be wise to make sure he's not stalking you down there from time to time
---
Plague couldn't show up cause she was feeling not too good
---
With no teachables:
---
 Discordance, Sloppy Butcher, Distressing, and Mad Grit
---
With teachables:
---
Ruin (Hag), BBQ and Chili (Cannibal), Thanataphobia (Nurse), and Monitor and Abuse (Doctor)
---
alex lin aka hermin carter aka the doctor is my favorite killer tbh
---
Wasn't it Hybridpanda?
---
I think it's a perk effect from your teammates, called prove thyself. It basically makes you and everyone on the generator work on it faster. It also can only be on gems and near the person with the effect.
---
My point is just get her. Only you can decide what you like. Instead of having someone "taint" your experience with the character, just play her and decide, even if it results in you not liking her
---
thank you good sir for teaching a potato something new thing about the game
---
I mean, Head on is the most fun perk in the game, so...
---
I disagree with the Pig and Legion, if your talking about Frank, then they do kill for fun, he‚Äôs a masochist and definitely enjoys killing (I don‚Äôt think so for the other members, but the Pig in the movies was methodical and killed those she saw as ‚ÄòNot enjoying life‚Äô so she would probably see what‚Äôs she‚Äôs doing as justice, she isn‚Äôt insane but with a strange ideology.
---
This is why im a wraith main
---
They better rework legion leatherface and pig are fine right now
---
He's an M1 killer. You didn't unlock the secret that nobody else knows. Everyone knows how Wraith works, you're the only one that claims you're some kind of Wraith prodigy.
---
"Game Over"
---
She gets to say it at the end of SAW 2.
---
I forgot to mention, that the blue diamond that shows up at the bottom near your own equipped perks means that generally another survivor has a perk that benefits more than just them (for example there's "Streetwise" a start perk for Nea that lowers consumption rates for survivors that are close to her). But if that diamond is red....well that means the killer has a perk that's hindering your chances of survival (for example "Thanatophobia" one of the Nurse's starter perks which slows down all progress a certain percentage for every survivor that isnt fully healed or sacrificed/dead already). There are a lot of symbols in the game and many of them you dont see every game especially if you're barely starting out. If you have anymore questions feel free to ask away and there are plenty of players (I'm assuming) that would be happy to help you!
---
noed
---
Bruh no please
---
Thats why i fucking despise playing clown. My hate for this character is almost as much as pre nerf legion
---
It's great
---
That cat meme gets me every time its just so sad
---
I spat my coke. Damn you. LOL
---
How‚Äôs you get the light to reflect off him like that?
---
I wish casual games were possible without getting disrespected the entire game
---
Some people have their humanity taken away by the word, he probably wasn‚Äôt offended, it‚Äôs just easy to use a different better word. That‚Äôs all.
---
Really? I see NOED every other game or more at every rank, everyone is using it from grey to red ranks.
---
So do you have a real reason as to why people shouldn't use NOED or just another excuse wrapped up in an insult? 
---
NOED adds *minutes* to the games length just by existing, you don't even have to run it, just the overuse of it is enough for multitudes of players to run about willy nilly looking for totems, creating more kill opportunities.
---
On top of that, if they *don't* do the totems, you are rewarded with easier kills for having less kill opportunities.
---
The perk is so good, regardless of how "cheap/unskilled" it is in your opinion. I would very much like to see this plethora of matches where you claim that less people use NOED, as my experience has been the polar opposite, and I climb yellow to red every season.
---
Yeah but legion is just boring to play and so is cannibal
---
I love the clicking sound and I find survivors taunting each other with flashlight clicks hilarious (as long as it's non toxic). Some of my funniest moments have been like 3 survivors just flashlight click spamming each other as if they're having a duel with their flashlights. I thought it was hilarious.
---
I was very torn about those top tiers, I felt like all of them had a reason to be at the top (Wraith: very straightened shoulders, Plague: vomiting, Trapper: just a cool guy, Myers: would have SSS+ tier posture if he took his shirt off)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
also it's worth mentioning I've never played DBD ;\_; I did this from watching streams and some frantic google image searches after the guy I watch mentioned how awful and outstretched Freddy's neck looks
---
I'd say everything is great outside of the killer herself, progress at any cost, and hex:paranoia. The doctor springs to mind for the latter. The killer's power would make her even more hated than legion, and about on par with them as well. Here is what i would change:
---
Hex: paranoia;
---
The rooting its power on the fear of the unknown, for every survivor hooked, you gain a stack. For each stack you gain an additional 3/4/6 meters to your terror radius, while losing the same amount when in chase. The increased/decreased terror radius only triggers when out of chase.
---
P.A.A.C: 
---
For every survivor injured by your hand, you gain a token. For every token you lose 1% movement speed, but gain 10/15/20% increased attack recovery, lunge range, and miss recovery.
---
Killer power:
---
"Embrace the madness"
---
When activated the killer no longer sees scratch marks, blood and cannot hear injured survivors as clearly (the cries of pain turn into a radius not directional) but moves at 150% movement speed, and can instantly down a survivor, smash a pallet (no delay/stun but consumes the power) or fully/partially regress a generator. During this time the killer can vault windows as survivor fast-vault speeds.
---
Cool down: 25 seconds (add-ons can reduce or increase this)
---
Duration: 15 seconds (add-ons effect this)
---
Agreed agreed
---
Start a love train, love train!
---
Isnt there one for completing the last gen yourself and escaping?
---
Rework/buff legion
---
New meta
---
I was BMing the Meg because they told me to KYS last game
---
I'd like a Dead Space crossover, so this seems pretty cool to me.
---
What platform do you play on?  
---
Well to me NOED is a crutch. You get a speed boost and a one shot down for playing poorly?  Seems kind of odd to me.  
---
Currently at red rank on pc, I've been playing most of today. Seen NOED once today on a rank 3 legion who wasn't very good.
---
Head on was buffed and is a lot more consistent now. I still agree with you tho
---
&gt;when it's one sided as it always has been
---
I get this suspicion that you think killer is more difficult than survivor
---
RIP that sucks man üòî
---
Must be a glitch then, because I'm certain that they are supposed to stay in your inventory. Send a ticket about that to the support.
---
I swear rank 20s wouldnt stop running ever if there wasnt a wall
---
But rancor is countered by lockers tho
---
I don‚Äôt have enough time in my week to give a fuck about the meta when I finally have a few hours to play
---
Also Ash came out recently
---
I swear that cypress moris are like 10x rarer than ebony
---
I'll just sit in the lobby and take home 4 perks, an offering, and probably an insta-heal, incase I, or someone I know, is dying. Do we keep the person?
---
But what if you bring the killer with you and they kill you irl?
---
At first glance I thought this was Heather Mason from Silent Hill 3. Was disappointed it wasn't.
---
I'd grab onto one before I got sent home. As a trophy, of course.
---
Wasn‚Äôt a Paragraph a fan-coined term and not an official one?
---
I played a game last week as Meg. Only had adrenaline and sprint burst because she's only at level 8. However, I was able to see the killer aura whenever he went into the basement. I could see him down there the entire time. Did someone else have a perk that gave the team that ability or was there a bug in the game?
---
The devs confirmed that the Trapper was tortured into killing for the Entity this also applies to the Doctor.
---
The Hillbilly wasn't tortured at least it isn't mentioned in his lore and it is also not visible beside his natural deformation he probably kills because he thinks it is the real world and these humans are in his territory.
---
The Pig also kills because she wants to if you read the last few paragraphs in her lore she sees the Entity as her new master
---
Yes, exactly. Once you reach a certain level, the perks included with the character become "teachable", and can be found on the Bloodwebs of other characters. Welcome to the grind.
---
You can purchase some teachable perks from the Shrine of Secrets in the store, but it's fairly limited.
---
That is likely why the Ghost Face chapter didn‚Äôt get a map/survivor, it was all hands on deck for the rework of Freddy and Springwood.
---
Very true
---
I will throw entire games if someone is in a locker to sit there until they leave.
---
The little kids absolutely are toxic. It's gonna be great once there back to school. Also they will prob have bed times again so late at night won't be as bad either.
---
Billy is worse cuz he can actually win
---
That... that‚Äôs a hag...?
---
Fuck off
---
When does that 15% slow down activate?
---
Oh god imagine the t-bagging
---
I finally got BBQ on Huntress AND NOW I CAN'T GET IT ON MYERS REEEEEEEE
---
In the original film, he killed people to torture Laurie (Play with your food, does that make sense?). He wasn‚Äôt on some brainless rampage, he stalked Laurie to see who she hung out with (her friends closest to her), killed those people, and then set their corpses up and baited Laurie into the house so she could see them before he pursued her (save the best for last makes more sense too doesn‚Äôt it). He definitely had meticulous and malicious reasons, if you watched the film.
---
Are they saying my physical body is teleported into the game or I assume the role of a character in the game? Assuming the latter I‚Äôll just play as nurse with Addons that allow me to blink 5 times and I come out with the ability to teleport. Or if it‚Äôs the first suggestion I play immersive and bring back an Instaheal Med Kit and Sprint Burst :)
---
I have one of meg that‚Äôs even worse
---
It‚Äôs all good my guy. I thought I was the stupid one to be completely honest here
---
That's nurse on PC too
---
"chill killer game" ahah nice one you can't have one of those even if the survivors aren't toxic scum
---
Sole Survivor is good too
---
Also, like, Philip killed one guy after he found out the horrible crimes that guy committed (and without Philips knowledge had him commit too). I‚Äôd say the entity is definitely forcing him, since Philip did try to help the person he found in the trunk of the car.
---
im pretty sure the last gen pop is an aura read for the obsession
---
Wait, really? Huh, then my luck has freaky good timing.
---
If Im running technician and someone is working on a gen with me will this cancel out technician or will the perk effect the other survivor ?

Ah, I figured. People always trash on console nurses which is kind of innacurate. Good console Nurses aren't AS good as PC ones, but they come close sometimes.
---
Oh my gosh! I completely forgot about Becker! Holy crap that was one of my favorite TV shows too.
---
Now I know the next TV show I am binge watching.
---
Thanks!!
---
Great job ... it‚Äôs always a special moment when you get that first red rank. Especially considering the level of shit you have to put up with to get there ... gg
---
they may not be allowed for whatever reason
---
Why should perk tiers be removed ?
---
Can you help me understand?
---
Just for clarification, Michael didn‚Äôt kill at random in the film (talking 1978 Halloween, since John Carpenter said all the sequels except the 2018 film are noncanonical). He‚Äôs always had a plan.
---
It‚Äôll be ok fren just wait. Rank reset will happen and then the game will be interesting at the very least. Nothing like a game of, will I be playing with pros or potatoes?
---
I know I'm nitpicking here but Frank is more of a sadist than a masochist.  Sadists enjoy causing others pain, masochists enjoy their own pain.
---
God no. My GPU would catch fire and explode dealing with whatever lighting code they set up.
---
If we‚Äôre gonna be fair, most survivors are trash anyway it‚Äôs rare you‚Äôll find a decent one never mind a full group
---
YouTuber named Samination makes DBD animated Parodies. Well a running gag in the Parodies is that Tapp asked Adam and Laurie why they didn't use the hatchets in the lockers against the killer, Tapp pulls out the hatchets and demonstrates but accidentally kills them. Huntress comes over and assumes Tapp killed them for her, so she kidnaps him and decides to make him her husband. The image of her saying "you husband now" is when Tapp wakes up at Mother's Dwelling in the next parody after Huntress sees Tapp kill Adam and Laurie.

Salty messages are seen a lot so they fall under oversaturated content.
---
Same. Once you get good enough ruin means nothing. The problem is when you realize your team isn't in the same boat and they're all wasting fucking time looking for it.  
---
For me, to balance NOED, it either needs to give the speed boost or the insta down. Not both.
---
That's pretty true, I guess I get it now.
---
That was my bad, but still he definitely enjoys his gig with the entity
---
That looks amazing! üëå

And you think that's a fair, justifiable reason?

Did you looked at this system, if it's not bugged, because for me it feels bugged. It's ALWAYS and I mean not sometimes, not usually, but ALWAYS the first box, or the last box, never the middle ones. Just check with other devs.

Me neither, it‚Äôs always an experienced player hiding as a Baby Dweet

You'd be surprised lol, plus it likely won't punish on first offense

This never gets old.

As long as you're not sitting in front of the hooked survivor slapping him you should be fine.

I mean you can do that if you want, but people will get salty

Would you happen to have a link for the pink ultra rare perk mod? And is it risky? Thanks.
---
I was going for a hex totem and got bodyblocked by a Hag for the entire match
---
Nah. I am solo survivor and I often see my team mates trolling killers after they realise that killer isn't very good and can easily be looped. Nothing to do with tactics, everything to do with survivors acting superior and wanting to humiliate the killer.
---
I'm really hoping this gif doesn't show up multiple times. Reddit crashed the first couple times I tried posting it.

did the devs ever say they wanted to do crossplay?
---
You don‚Äôt get points for luck normally so why would you do it for exposed hits? And would you get extra if for example you hit someone who had the blind effect
---
Than*
---
 and youre a meanie
---
It's why I don't ever use one until I'm past rank 6. I'd rather not ruin people's games and have to try against swf occasionally.
---
That would be more then fair, I'd like it if it was more interactive, say 1 dull totem gives the insta, and each additional dull totem gives the 1% speed boost topping at 5% if all 5 totems remain standing. 
---
Or even if it was just a choice between the two, making it more interactive based on the killer, like a Meyers/Ghostface with a 5 percent speed boost alone would be interesting combined with the stalk aspects, or the insta down for the weaker half of the killer roster like Wraith/Trapper/Pig.

I really hope this gif doesn't show up multiple times. Reddit crashed the first time I tried posting it.
---
We'll have to wait an see how severe the penalties are, but the devs have said that DC'ing is getting out of hand(In more words, I'm paraphrasing) an they want to take a strong stance against it. 
---
So we'll see, I have high hopes they put a pin in first down DC's ASAP as that is aggravating for both sides everytime.
---
How difficult was it ?
---
Just watch out for the 4-man "Survive with Friend" groups that are all rank 1-4 and have one friend smurfed to rank 20 so they can all bully new killers!
---
What fun!

Is spamming a button really that bad to make you quit Survivor just because of that...?

It‚Äôs generally more valuable to be being chased, distracting the killer from the other members of your team, then on a hook and thus useless. Worse than useless actually, because another person needs to devote their time to save you. Thus at high ranks, (I think, I‚Äôm a rank ten survivor on a good day) is that people play to not get downed, ever. Medkits, Dead Hard, Sprint Burst, good knowledge of loops, et cetera, make avoiding hits a top priority. Kindred simply doesn‚Äôt fit that gameplan, because you have to be on the hook to get value from it. At high ranks Killers also tend not to camp, and if they do the survivors can deal with it unless they tilt, removing a little bit of extra utility from it.
---
Also if you play the game primarily with friends (even one person, though many people play solely in a four person SWF group) Kindred is entirely useless.
---
I love kindred, personally, as a solo R10 survivor. But it‚Äôs rarely part of an optimal build.
---
My experience is that at higher ranks players develop a lot of situational awareness and map awareness, and don't need it. A lot of matches kind of follow a "flow" and you can gain a lot of the same information through things like hexed totem pops, gen pops, Spine Chill, terror radius, downed survivors, etc.
---
Some people do run Bond to maximize their map awareness, but Kindred is, to me, the anti facecamping perk and doesn't do much else.
---
Maybe next time she will leave when the door is opened
---
Quality shitpost
---
When you accidentally put the game on Veteran Mode
---
I understand the intent? The idea is that Clown is supposed to be the "anti-loop" Killer as opposed to the "anti-chase" Killer.
---
The thing is why can't Clown also be the "anti-chase" Killer? It's one of the big problems with Behavior's game design, and how they favour making weak designs and then never touching them again as opposed to making strong designs that they then have to nerf. It's why so many perks have so many random restrictions (Solidarity only healing 50% and not working with medkits, Flip-Flop only giving 50% struggle, Dark Devotion only working on the Obsession, etc.) that stop them from being amazing.
---
I've been stuck at rank 2-4 and rank reset is here :( rip.
---
Well I mean theoretically it sounds like they would be readying everything but if they don‚Äôt I‚Äôve word on it I suppose it‚Äôs not for sure of course, but thank you for the information!

[GET THIS BETA SHIT OFF ME](/intensifies)
---
Yeah it‚Äôs the worst when a survivor gets downed 30 seconds into the game and DCs like a child. I had a bad lag switching killer today and all 3 of my teammates DC‚Äôd lol so I wasn‚Äôt sure if there was a point of if they were just doing it out spite. Thanks:)
---
I forgot to mention that, but legion doesn't have a cap on vaulting speed, seeing that using bamboozle and fire up can increase his vaulting speed when used together.
---
If you want to play Basement Bubba without being toxic, replace Insidious with Territorial Imperative (Huntress Perk). Territorial Imperative reveals a survivor aura when someone enters the basement and you aren't nearby. It then goes on a cooldown. At rank 3, the cooldown is like 20 seconds, so you should be able to catch anyone who goes into the basement. 
---
You down someone, put them in the basement, and go back to playing normally. If Territorial Imperative reveals someone going to make the basement save, rush in and down them both. Rinse, repeat.
---

She was left on hook on the last minute and got that 4% chance and got off of hook
---
flashlight clicking and teabagging for survivors and the good old head shaking for killers

So combining Feral Frenzy with Fire Up and Bamboozle means the Feral Frenzy vault is faster?

---
No, you play a serial killer whose purpose is to kill every last survivor, by any mean necessary
---
No perk is toxic to the game imo. There are ways to work around any perk anyone would call toxic.
---
You're not required to do that. Play how you want to man
---
Yeah that‚Äôs kinda what I thought, thanks for the input.
---
No. In the realm of the entity, no one escapes death. Unless it's a really cute baby Dwight. Then maybe. Just maybe his innocence is enough to sway me.
---
If im already stubborn on meme builds with stake out and pebble, that'd just make it worse
---
To be fair, his posture is a bit out of place, but the piece itself looks well done so idk either, but it did deserve more love imo.
---
Don't even need to, just play the game normally. 50% chance is pretty good odds, if anything just pretend to be the person that doesn't have it by running towards the loop when the killer gets near, preferably you want to use it after the killer has chased you for a bit anyways. Playing with only 3 perks is not that big of a deal for survivors in red ranks
---
What would you say is a "Typical Gay Gamer?"
---
What‚Äôs slugging?
---
it defines who i am
---
INCREDIBLE JOB!
---
She's underrated. The key to her is mastering the use of the stealth capability that she has. But do not take this the wrong way! Do not be one of those pigs who goes around crouched at all times.
---
Well, it's possible or no one would be in red ranks.
---
Same! I've been using Make Your Choice which is a perk I never saw myself using. Somehow made it to rank 4 with her and pig
---
I've noticed the same. I'm trying to depip and even at lower ranks every match has been a 4-man with purple flashlights, instaheals, and super toxic streamers. I had 4 4SWF's in a row. 
---
I'm not DCing but I'm grabbing doc, zapping obsession all game, then instadowning him with NOED and Moriing him with Rancor.
---
Was it wraith?
---
This usually happens when people want to depip before rank reset. They go in as wraith, who starts cloaked and they hide somewhere with no terror radius. :/ it‚Äôs a waste of a game imo but at least you get out I guess.
---
Oh man, that's one of the greatest pieces of art I've ever seen
---
***DO NOT DELETE***
---
honestly not that difficult, some matches were tough but it was easy to moderate most of the time.
---
Yes. I haven‚Äôt played killer yet but I will very soon
---
That actually has decent potential as a meme format
---
Nah mate it‚Äôs from a porno
---
damn, yeah it was my goal this season to get to rank 1, honestly just grind it and try and black pip and you will most likely end up pipping, i grinded it and got to it in a couple of days, playing 3-5 hours a day with breaks.
---
Or become Jane and become down with the T H I C C N E S S.
---
I dont think a nerf is in order i just want some kind of counter play for the locker cheese.
---
I'm rank 5 and my friend I play with is rank 9, which is why we were matched with him but we play with a lot of purple and red ranks and I've seen it ALL night. It's been super annoying. I lost my key, add ons,  and offering. Didn't even get the usual 5000 bloodpoints, guessing they forced quit on us. 
---
I hate the doc with a burning passion, but you gotta do what you gotta do against those pesky swf I suppose. 
---
I also just want to know the purpose in depiping? To hard in your rank or what?
---
Yeah, because baby killers whined as they always do when survivors get a decent perk in the sea of trash ones.
---
Baby killers whining that survivors get a whole extra hit, while equipping iri heads and ebony moris.
---
Imagine the uproar if a survivor started whining about those. Ironic.
---
We can't even see the ranks lol
---
The sound itself can be heard as 
---
"nnnnoooooooooeeeeeeeed". 
---
Thats how i hear it always.
---
I blocked em out at first thinking I was getting the names lol. But realized after a small blonde moment that didn't work and blurred them out.
---
But why does that matter?
---
I'm just interested in killer ranking.
---
When my friends and me SWF and still get destroyed
---
why would squinting mess up your posture?
---
I‚Äôve tried that a couple times! But there‚Äôs always one fucker who has that perk that lets them save themselves from the dying state, then they go save someone else and it all goes to shit lol.

Hey we all start out somewhere! I was working with a tiny desk for awhile but finally upgraded to a decent size desk!
---
I see that
---
I presume you won as survivor because killer is broken e.g billy can‚Äôt cancel his chainsaw,trapper can‚Äôt see his traps through walls.
---
Exactly.
---
I didn't say it was. If you say something that frustrates you about survivors like Genrushing all the survivor mains downvote you and talk shit, if you say something bad about noed all the killer mains downvote you and talk shit
---
Oh shoot lol my bad I assumed u meant survivor.
---
Honestly lol it's crazy. A few matches a killer cannot just destroy everyone, so it's must ruin every game for people who like to play with their friends lol. My swf isn't toxic at all, I've honestly made tons of killer friends,  I rarely even see the shit they cry about and I play killer. Lololol.
---
I saw that, and ironically enough thats my main build too! Sometimes I put on Deliverance instead of Head On, but I really enjoy getting those Head On saves, really satisfying.
---
Bead dy baylight Im gonna start calling the name like that
---
And got revealed
---
That would be Unbreakable, try to memorize survivor perks. If you down a bill he could have unbreakable and or borrowed time. I remember a Jane ran into a locker and I remembered one of her perks were Head on, so I walked towards the locker and stepped back so she wasted her head on
---
While this is true sometimes I try to have fun but then it‚Äôs ruined like how I get tunneled if I take no mither
---
noed rewards killers for being bad. and requires survivors to do a secondary objective that is often useless just because it might be in the game.  
---
It also sucks to play against, which removes fun from 4/5 of the players. 
---
hhonestly based on it being so unfun to play against should be enough to rework, but its presence in a match regardless of if its actually being run is another problem
---
 Thanks for all the kind words. I appreciate it. :)
---
"Rind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and *insidious* killer"

No. It used to be something you could do without much drawback but now you get punished hard with points and pips.

Chase theme starts at 1:07
---
SWF = Survive With Friends
---
Baby Dweet = New player (usually Dwights) that just hide in lockers the moment they hear a terror radius and play super immersed, usually not actually doing anything for their team.
---
You can completely counter a killer and his build if you know who it is and what they have before hand, and can easily destroy any hexes. It absolutely gives a drastic advantage.
---
Downvoted for speaking truth
---
People throw around the word toxic all the time. I don't think there is a problem unless someone is going out of their way to prevent another player from having fun, or taking advantage of some exploit.
---
Some people use ‚Äòlowest‚Äô due to ranks going down from 20 to 1. While highest is the term used by most, it is understandable why some do call red and purple ranks ‚Äòlow ranks‚Äô
---
I dead ass commented I'm gonna wait in the loading screen.
---
Congrats! Hope you had a blast and keep up the good work for the glory of the entity lol
---
Truetalent got sniped all day fourteen days in a row last I checked. All day. Three other survivors and the sniper. Back to back. Stream sniping absolutely should be bannable. It gives the sniper an extreme advantage over the streamer.
---
Or they could just make it so you cant use it out of a locker but i don't like that either. I play a lot of survivor as well.
---
But yes you are correct. I feel like spirit fury should be change complete and enduring should have its affect tied in with the pallet stun reduction but with 3 pallets for the trigger.
---
And spirit fury should be a retaliation perk from stuns which would fit rins lore better seeing how shes been stabbed to death and she is all vengeful and what not.
---
there's a difference between "doing the objective" and "running 4 BNP on purple toolboxes + speed add-on, with at least one prove thyself and possibly streetwise"
---
The actual genrush is rare these days. Also, the genrush of today isn't as genrushy as I remember tho
---
I still have nightmares with the old old BNP.

"press space to fix a gen"

"blacking out counts as dying"

I don't get this retarded caveat.

This happens a lot when a Blendette gets a killer daily - it's hard for them to realize the goal is different.
---
I mean I doubt his dad ever actually let him go to school. Gotta continues his education somehow.
---
I just tried the game on pc first time (I play ps4), didn't have the hang of the controls yet, and as first match is loading it says "facing The Cannibal". Needless to say I didn't last very long.
---
I like haddonfield and perk tiers
---
I consider it toxic when someone does something to be arrogant, annoying, or just a bad person to make people angry. While a lot of people who do these things are toxic it doesn‚Äôt inherently make these toxic. They all give each side a boost that can help them complete they‚Äôre goal. It might be annoying to fight someone using these things but it‚Äôs not really made to make you angry the only thing I can see here that could get really used to make you angry is an ebony mori and that‚Äôs just as unfortunate as running into a P3 nurse so I can‚Äôt call it toxic. Sure people can know that these things could make people angry but they probably just want to make things a little easier for themselves. Besides if you call a cypress mori toxic then you need to grow up.
---
something tells me if we get hellraiser it will be a paragraph like ghost face &amp; leatherface, of course they'd probably go with pinhead because of recognizability but it would also be cool if frank or julia were the killer (since they are like, actual killers) or even kirsty when she took pinhead's place in hell and became a cenobite (since she's just female pinhead essentially)
---
Let's hope
---
Legion was nerfed pretty severely in his rework. Being a 115% killer is good but now he‚Äôs severely underwhelming. I don‚Äôt want legion to be anywhere near as annoying as he was but if they increased his movespeed in feral frenzy, I wouldn‚Äôt be complaining. Also he should at least be able to use his frenzy when the bar is half full or something, waiting the full time for it to come back is excruciating when you consider missing a hit also cancels his power
---
You probably don't understand what the removal of perk tiers would be then
---
Not really, they're just part of the game. It's the shit lords who suck at okaying against those covers that turn them toxic.
---
Ok, then tell me what would they do?
---
I feel like Ivory is the most toxic but also the funnest to play with or against. It's like a "Fuck you in particular" and when I get it used on me I'm just like "lmao fuck"
---
With flailing tassels? I think not.
---
Well she was taught by Jigsaw to test people, putting them in life or death traps that required the will to live to pass. He honestly didn‚Äôt see what he was doing as murder. But when Amanda was in charge of the tests she didn‚Äôt give them any chance to survive.
---
Wow, I didn‚Äôt realize I would have to explain this much obvious nuance.  I was implying very obviously that this conversation doesn‚Äôt require me to go through that much effort since it‚Äôs not important.  It‚Äôs a video game.
---
or angelique because she's my favorite but yeah that's farfetched
---
English?
---
Haddonfield Rework? Yes, please
---
The other two? Hell the fuck no.
---
Double BP just makes the game unplayable
---
When perk tiers are grindy as fuck. just straight up removing them would make everything TOO easy to get. BHVR told us they are working on a bloodweb change that possibly will give you more than one perk per level and they'll give us more info this month
---
God damnit you got a laugh from me

no one found the killer
---
Didn‚Äôt the Entity strike a deal with Spirit so that she could take revenge on her father? And in exchange she must serve him
---
Stranger Things would be awesome and so would Hellraiser, but I'd like something original next. I'll be fine either way but licenses have been getting a good bit of attention lately and I'd like to see what new exciting concept they can bring to the game next.
---
What does p3 mean
---
I‚Äôd be happy af. The last game I played was MLB the show 19 so I‚Äôd be rich
---
That is the dumbest shit I've ever heard in my life.
---
Usage of power, add-ons, and perks are ALL things that are meant to "make the game easier." They all accomplish the same thing and the fact that you're distinguishing them is the most self-righteous argument I've ever seen on these forums and you should be laughed at.
---
Because it's a part of his power. It's Deviousness. It's a scoring event meant to be exclusive to him. They're not the same thing and they're not worth comparing.

Totally agree, it‚Äôs too much of a grind to level up perks
---
Time to use hope as an infinite
---
She's a high skill killer for sure. You need to really manipulate her crouching, charging, and understand how to keep survivors busy with party hats.
---
She definitely needs some small buffs but if you're good then she's easily up there with new freddy or mikey
---
Dbd redditors be sipping the small brain juice it seems
---
Oh I get it guys! It‚Äôs because Wraith can cloak into invisibility so he cosplayed as an invisible Wraith therefore he‚Äôs not actually in the picture! Haha, brilliant!
---
Wow, your so talented, now draw The Ghost Face In stalk mode
---
Instead of getting tier 1, then tier 2, then tier 3 perks in your trees, the first time you encounter it it's just the perk... as a tier 3.  Tier 1 and tier 2 wouldn't exist anymore.
---
To assert your dominance, drop the last survivor near the hatch, close it and then Mori them on it. Ez
---
r/woosh
---
But, in the end game screen you can see the killers power and add ons, the power will let you know which killer it was, for future reference.
---
Then you'd get all the perks too quickly and the game wouldn't be as fun
---
Can't even read everything you said because you said no to double BP yikes
---
To me or him I got the joke
---
Nice foreheads
---
We could and I believe people have. Dont remember what the Devs said though, or even remember if they addressed it. 
---
As a killer and survivor player, I think the penalty should be stricter than it is but not extremely strict. I know as a survivor I sometimes just DC because the game is going shit and everyone is dying anyway (&amp; i mostly do it on my last hook anyway when the killer has already gotten points for hooking me) and as a killer, I never really DC but when people do it doesn‚Äôt affect me but as a survivor I know it affects the survivors in my killer game. So I would like it to be fair, possibly like a timeout session, like how you get if you disconnect during a ranked match on Rainbow Six Siege. Once again, something stricter than it is now but not to strict/severe.
---
Eboni Mori works pretty well for me.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôve barely got one survivor to 43 and it feels like it‚Äôs taken forever
---
Do what you want but you're gonna get hate for it.
---
Grinding bloodpoints is not content lol, the game is supposed to be fun in its own right(which it is).  It is definitely too much of a grind for new players.  Even for the veterans of the game with thousands of hours if they have everything unlocked for everyone else, when a new survivor/killer comes out if they want to unlock every single perk on them they have to spend like 42M bloodpoints iirc.
---
Him ig I thought you didn't get it either
---
You still depip if you mori too fast lol

Can I ask what the hell he was doing on the tracks
---
Yes but they already said they're making changes but removing tiers completely would make it worse because grinding is part of the fun if anything they should just make perks cheaper
---
Evens the game out with a swf with insta heals tho. You actually end up having to hit each one about 4-5 times.
---
The only thing I believe has little to no counter is Nurse. A good Nurse can't have the same thing done multiple times to them. A good Nurse can easily adapt to a survivor's playstyle and can easily get a 3 or 4k because a good Nurse is a cancer Nurse to play against.
---

Oh man! The most jumpscares happen when I'm against Michael
---
Are you asking for a rework for those three or saying those three shouldn't be reworked?
---
F
---
Awesome! Of you're looking for a teammate let me know! Steam name is same username as here.
---
Hmm seems a bit weak :/
---
That would be fair, I'm unfamiliar with how R6siege gets down on their quit penalties, does it increase in severity the more it occurs or is it just a flat penalty across the board for quitting?
---
I never quit, as an Xbox player I'm aware that dash boarding your game doesn't give you the negative pip to your account rank like regular quitting does, so I see alot of inflated rank survivors in the high purple to red ranks, and as a solo player they are pretty detrimental to my matches, an id really like to see that herd get thinned out.
---
As a Killer I just hate when I find someone in the first minute and they just flat out quit, the. I feel like the asshole if I don't let the rest go/let them farm. 
---
These are my main 2 issues I want dedicated servers to fix, so I'm not sure how strict/lax it would have to be to find that fine line but that's what I have my fingers crossed for.
---
Honestly I feel ya. &amp; Yes the penalty does get worse you can get banned for up to a month. Not sure what happens if you do it again after the month, that‚Äôs the furthest I‚Äôve heard and seen someone get banned.
---
Only exposed to normal attacks
---
When the ANOES chapter came out, Kyle Gallner (Quentin‚Äôs actor) expresses surprise on Twitter how he had no idea this was happening, and he was really interested in playing it. The fact that he didn‚Äôt even know but was so enthusiastic shows that if the devs had pursued Gallner for Quentin‚Äôs likeness, they‚Äôd likely had gotten it (I mean, they eventually got Bruce fuckin Campbell after all).
---
Showing the killer you know where his totem is, is a 1 way ticket to getting tunneled.
---
this is my new favorite post on Reddit!! I'm so excited and happy that you got to meet not only Shawnee Smith but Tobin Bell as well. That's definitely something I wish to do in the future.
---
Thanks so much for this post, it put a big, goofy smile on my face!
---
Hey thank you so much. It took a lot of work to figure out how to make myself invisible. I won't actually tell you how i managed to do it but I may be at the next cosplay event. I'll keep it a surprise for now.
---
[For the confused ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mz296Izw-S8)
---
Also I'd say the skill cap on nurse is its own counter. You have to be really good to be really good with nurse. If someone is willing to put in the time and effort for the payout, they've earned it. Still, being a good nurse isn't toxic.
---
Wow that's incredible man, you should enter a comp or something, my mind is truly blown away...in fact it's so good it could be from live actionü§î
---
Hey hey hey.. a true cosplayer never reveals their secrets. Let them ooo and ahhh at your magic ;)
---
Not *handing* a person a free win isn't toxic. You do you, if they don't get gens done that's their problem.
---
I can only imagine the parents named their kid Trapper because they think they gangster
---
One of my favourite parts of the Scream movies is Ghostface getting smacked around a shit ton during the chase scenes. The scene in the first movie in the garage is hilarious.
---
Thanks for understanding. It's like asking a magician how they did a trick. I rather keep, uh, silent.
---
Was referencing that, lmao
---
"Deebo that's messed up! Why don't you give him back his flashlight!?"

---
Rec Room is cross platform.
---
I was thinking maybe being able to saw through pallets without losing momentum or a sorta legion like chain reaction each time he hits someone (speed boost or another swing) it would make it so he is instead of being a weaker billy a different kind. Might be a bit op but I like the thought
---
Queue times I am guessing
---
Hex Ruin helps, although I'm not sure if you have access to it yet. Its a Hag perk you can unlock it through her bloodweb. I'm not that great either but I also use Bitter Murmur- that helps too because if they are doing gens I can see their aura when the gen is done and usually catch one. Hope that helped a little
---
Good point
---
Let's face it, we all thought it was a killer who had multiple personality disorder and could switch masks to gain different powers of different aspects in the game.
---
Lol
---
Lol rank 16
---
I‚Äôd just become a killer, then no matter how shitty I do I get an awesome ability and I get to live!
---
I have the same feeling with doc or even wraith tbh, but despite that they‚Äôre just so painfully bad
---
If I notice 1 survivor doing just about everything an giving me solid chases while the rest of the team hides and goes down in 20 secs chases then I may pity them, as I've been on that hard carry survivor life a few times, I may give them the hatch if they are also the last to be alive.
---
But also it's not toxic at all to not give anyone the hatch for free. 
---
Play how you want.
---
About legion, It depends. Frank is probably a psycopath (or sociopath) and he enjoys killing.
---
But If you look at Susie she doesn't want to kill.
---
MAYBE the entity took each member diferently, like Frank didn't need to be tortured or anything but the others (especially Susie) had to be "convinced".
---
I also never understood Susie's mask and why It is so weird, maybe that's the entity's doing (like, the devs couldn't change the model of legion Just to show that Susie WAS tortured so they represent it by her mask)
---
It‚Äôs blendette time
---
Hex ruined gets popped way to quickly, and guarding my totem is tough, when generators are still popping. then again lv1 hex. What other suggestions does this community have?
---
(As a hag)
---
Wow lol
---
Stop it already. It looks awful
---
This is fake. You bought this online.
---
I personally don't use it, but can definitely see why others do. I guess for me, I've gotten so used to just looking around while I do gens/listening for the beginning of the heartbeat and use urban to sneak out. My audible queue for Spine Chill going off is so faint, is yours? That was my biggest deterrent, having to look at the perks to know it was activated.
---
For a killer running BBQ&amp;Chili/Discordance, Spine Chill is a good way of letting you know they went for you and to get out quick.
---
It's kinda why I just run Pharmacy and Ace in the whole or pharmacy with botany knowledge for two full heals generally. Med kits are the only thing I need since self care is so bad, especially with sloppy butcher.
---
Well if it was more realistic, you would be able to crawl around, and actually hide better, so I think I‚Äôd think you‚Äôd have a pretty fine time, if you hide goode
---
Can you do a tutorial on how to draw this? I'm bad at drawing.
---
Hex: Haunted Grounds and Hex: Devour Hope. Have never run NOED on any of my killers ever. 
---
Seems like you're projecting. Lmao
---
When I play plague it‚Äôs much easier to control the map with corrupt intervention and infecting the gens around the map. Gives me some extra info. Then with hillbilly it‚Äôs a fucking joke because of how fast he moves. But once they get 3 gens I just feel like and idiot because I‚Äôm not getting my hits in and I‚Äôm getting looped and all these fucking survivors with med kits and flash lights show up and lord have mercy it‚Äôs annoying. Plus the message spam post match.  But thank you anyway amigo. I‚Äôll pump some more points into hag to get the teachable
---
Auto-struggle or press Space to suicide.
---
It‚Äôs not that hard.
---
Don't worry guys OP is a Blendette. He'll be back safe and sound before you know it.
---
I kinda thought they'd be in the store section next to aureic cells, character and killers but they aren't 
---
are they expensive?
---
It would make the game so much less of a grind though. There's 56 Perks total, each of them with 3 Levels. That's 168 different times you'd have to unlock them. And considering the complete randomness of the Bloodwebs, it's just such a grind to even unlock what you want.
---
It'd make Character Prestige actually worth it, since you wouldn't need to start square one with the friggin' Bloodpoint grind.
---
It's not a waste of time if you use it right. I always carry lightweight to run around the map when I know I'm not in a chase, and urban evasion to crawl away from the place the killer is actively hunting me in. Works about 75% of the time. The players you're talking about, we commonly refer to them as Blendette's because of the meme where Claudette mains blend into everything around them and creep around, and they usually aren't top tier. Like at all.
---
For some reason i would be twerking against one side of the wall.
---
Oh nice. Man with killer it‚Äôs so hit or miss and is super dependent on how aggressive the survivors are :/ makes the matches hell somtimes
---
Everybody likes beads
---
The Legion's brother, ***The Cohort***

I get that but I love a little bit of grind. It makes me feel like I'm becoming stronger and better. I think the new system they're incorporating will be much better aswell

Serves him right

Tbh I just want a legion rework or buff to both them and their addons. Even as a legion main it‚Äôs sometimes just painful to play them because of how underwhelming their ability is and useless their addons are.

If your playing hag you can always trap your totem, the only other good gen perk(imo) is pop goes the weasle 
---
Don't hag is Abit of a setup character, you might want to look into running corrupt intervention to give you more time to setup and make it so you don't have to worry about 1 side of the map
---
This is so unnecessary..... What the fuck is wrong with you????
---
when  do cosmetics usually come out?
---
how do you use whispers?
---
does stridor work at all if someone uses iron will
---
I use the all eyes build (Deja Vu, Object of Obessession, Dark Sense and Kindred) cause i find it fun. And it makes my mates angry which i always laugh at
---
Yes for sure.
---
The community is very much alive.
---
And I thought it would be clear enough because the killer got 0 points. No front btw lul
---
A lot of people (like myself) like to depip to try out new killers. Though I can‚Äôt speak for everyone, trying to play a lvl 1 killer completely new to you can be difficult and demoralising when you‚Äôre up against red rank t-bagging swf with purple flashlights.
---
But im killer main, so thats better, will keep every outfit and weapons, some megheads and perks, addons, sounds nice, just for collections
---
Rather than that it's just when you want to not try as hard and meme build as killer and the survivors taunt you for it. I know I'm most likely going to lose by playing agi+iron grasp+ mad grit freddy terror but there's no need to rub it in.
---
Idk but as survivor I'd rather have that then a basic bitch billy, prayer beads spirit, or nurse in general.
---
Still though I have to resist the urge to just play a ruin ebony nurse game after going against a sweaty swf. Killers are overpowered and if I want to win then I will.
---
It's just hard to tell with swf groups who are the assholes and who are the chill ones.
---
Definitely. I also got the perk that if you are the last one alive you get a 75% speed bonus when repairing gens. But now it seems no point in running it thanks to the update. Doors and hatch opens no matter how many gens were done.

Yoo I have the same keyboard.
---
How is this toxic? 
---
You got the gates open ( saw your answer to another post) he quits, but at that point you get all your points and your escape points do you not?
---
All he did was short himself points and look like a pussy, that's not really toxic lol just stupid
---
\*cries in OG BNP\*
---
(press space once to fix the entire gen)
---
huntress + imposing presence = ?????????
---
*dc*
---
Oh no they definitely had glaring issues but they stem from the entire concept not working properly in the first place and them having to become a really odd M1 killer. Just look at the premise of the killer and then what we actually got.
---
Plooks like the game didn‚Äôt even start. Nobody lost a pip.
---
But my fav killer is daddy Myers &gt;:(
---
Oh I remember when I took matters into my own hands and I spent an entire day picking wraith with only Ruin, going invisible and bodyblocking the hex to let people practice landing greats
---
I also called myself "Ruin Security"
---
nice bait
---
No counterplay, exploits, annoying gameplay, bugs. Nothing wrong.
---
Even if it is it's console nurse so not really a problem
---
Small game is the name. I think I dont run that one because it doesn't let you see hidden killers. Which is the main reason I like premonition when I am being stealthy.
---
Another perk which would only ever be worth it on tier 3 if then
---
The thing is also that some people see people as toxic while they are not doing anything special.
---
I have been called toxic as a survivor for looping the killer while I just simply tried to avoid getting hooked.
---
And toxic by survivors for almost anything. (I play a lot more killer than survivor)
---
I belive that most people just see things as toxic while it is not.
---
Yes (even if I bought the game for 50%) but you should wait for the sales to buy dlcs.
---
At least u could piss someone off with it
---
Im sorry, SCP universe?
---
Lucky for you rank reset is near
---
I'd pay for this as a cosmetic
---
Dude, you're a tool.
---
every killer can make that with their lunge
---
Yeah the ones I see the most are: noed, DS, bt, and to a lesser degree ruin and adrenaline. 
---
Also playstyles such as: gen rushing, looping, tunnelling, and camping.
---
Items and add-ons usually include: insta-heals, flashlights, insta-saw, and prayer beads.
---
They should change the percentages and make the medkits the most common to appear. Medkits in my opinion are the only must-have items in game.
---
i'm a killer main, so i get to not die and keep a cool weapon, mask/outfit and a bowl of human meat pudding
---
Myers is my little Pumpkin üòò
---
&gt;making the killer hit them before they leave
---
I do that a lot but I don't do that to be toxic
---
I do that to let the killer get some BP and also chaser and malicious emblem points
---
Yup the pallet drop with jumping over it repeatedly at the start was a "try and catch me" move by an overly cocky survivor. Funnily enough those are usually the first to dc when they get shown they are not as good as a they think.
---
Every gauge killer cannot use his power if it's not full. They changed that because legion could just wait for someone to drop a pallet, activate his power and hit them. Leaving again no counterplay. Imagine if spirit or Micheal could use their power without having full gauge.
---
Almost. Moonwalking exploit was a nuisance. It should've been just fixed somehow while legion should've been buffed
---
Great suggestion ;)
---
25K/28K what lmao?
---
I thought it would be really annoying though to have so many locker auras especially when combined with windows of opportunity.
---
My policy is if they escape the hook by themselves, I won‚Äôt kill them. They deserve to win with those odds stacked against them.
---
I see it as more quality of life.
---
I can't tell if this is a picture or a screenshot. Can't be real smh.
---
So i can get to keep Janes T H I C C N E S S?
---
Yes they will moan in 50% instead of 150%(depends of ur perk tier and theirs)
---

Can't wait for Freddy! üòä
---
what exactly do you need? templates, editing software, ideas?
---
Everyone on this sub complains about everything. Killers dcing is the least toxic thing they can do. Thats why not many people complain. When a survivour dc's, other survivours have to deal with the fact they just lost a team mate and both survivours and killers get less points and survivours most likely lose. Killer leaves? Everyone safties or pips and you get bonus bp and the game ends. 
---
If you're confused why you're getting hate for this thread (that I'm sure youre thinking "this is proof of my double standards") isnt cause of a "double standard". It's cause you're trying to convey something in a childish manner as well as something that doesn't exist. Both sides fling shit at eachother and both sides are just as toxic.
---
Thanks will post there!

I don't think that's how this format works.

Omg the pig I love everything about it
---
so... put a 20 min timer on survivors and make them work much faster. 20 min matches are VERY RARE and this perk speeds the game up so much I'd be surprised if they lasted more than 8 minutes. also, the timer start with the first gen. in most matches, 3 gens pop at once, giving them 20 minutes to do 2 gens and escape.
---
1. doesn't sound very usable,
---
2. won't make a fun experience for either side,
---
3. brings back what EGC fixes, no time pressure at the end game (as they'll have like 15 minutes left everytime), letting survivors save everyone and teabag for ages.
---
ü§Øit's gonna be great!ü§Ø

Good luck!

**lazy karma whore** oh whoops guys my cat got on my phone
---
yeah but most dont have an in game lore reason. you just kinda respawn. I think a decent rule would be, any game that doesnt explain why you come back doesnt count
---
WTF BHVR
---
they stated themselves that it was "overpowered" and needed to be changed
---
It‚Äôs good, but it wouldn‚Äôt work against gen rushers but it would worked against aggressive players, it doesn‚Äôt work for all kinds of players.
---
Lol i was playing arma 3
---
im still tweaking the idea
---
Trophy time?
---
just be a killer
---
I looked at the forums and found this 
---
* Marked Survivors may no longer be stalked. (**Bug fix:** This was a planned change that was omitted in the 2nd PTB patch. We increased the Mark lasting time from 20 sec to 45 sec, but we wanted to remove his ability to keep Stalking a Mark Survivor to balance that change.)
---
Thanks. Didnt know you could do that. Will do.
---
Thanks for the advice! I'm really struggling with the mask.
---
Does it suck getting farm games when you want to play?  Yeah, but I would say less than half of games are farm games.  Considering your post frequency in /r/dbd I'm assuming that you have a ton of things unlocked already so you don't really care for double BP, that's just being greedy.  There are new players that would like more bloodpoints, the game experience isn't all about you.(This is in regards to both of the things you disagreed with)
---
this game if on sale like every 2 months
---
Omg it‚Äôs the most toxic survivor legion
---
Leatherface going to be happy after seeing this.
---
Bruh this threads from 2 weeks ago lol why come back now
---
## bruh üòúüòúüòúüòúüòú
---
I thought so too
---
end chases more quickly. hag is very capable of that.
---
you need to work on your mindgames a bit and put traps down in the middle of loops (even when chasing)
---
I reached rank 3 as her perkless and add-onless so trust me, it just works.
---
Lmao bruh
---
getting the first down quickly is essential
---
as trapper, you pretty much need ruin to have time to set your traps up
---
Discordance and Pop Goes The Weazel are my two go to‚Äôs for slowing down the game. Ruin despite the RNG for Totems is basically a must.
---
Alright thank you
---
I think he means that even if there are perks to hide as long as possible, the game doesn't reward this gameplay (aka you won't pip).
---
I doubt Freddy's happy about the situation considering his number 1 was passed over in favor of... fucking Quentin. It just isn't right. Imagine if Michael was stuck eternally obsessing over Ben Tramer instead of Laurie.
---
That title goes to Trapper
---
I'm still very new to the game but have quickly figured out tactics against each of the killers... except for Freddy.

I played one match against him about a week before his changes so I don't really have anything to base the current difficulty off of, but my god he seems impossible to beat.  He's incredibly quick, can be virtually anywhere at any point in the trial, and benefits from people being asleep (which happens extremely fast).  I don't think I've ever played a match against a Freddy where more than two generators were completed. 
---
What kinds of tips can be given to help combat this literal nightmare?
---
The hero we deserve but doesn't need!
---
Only reason I got this game was cause it was free on ps4+ so I got it and waited like 6months to play it.
---
Never thought I'd get quite into it, but hey 2months in I have 3 killer mains. Mad fun would recommend highly... survivor side not as much fun from my experience.
---
I know survivors don‚Äôt get maps, but we get her one? And can it be a giant Lululemon?
---
Only if you have friends to play with
---
don't put them in places they expect
---
Some examples:
---
don't put them at windows or pallets, put them a bit away, so they can't just vault right as you teleport
---
your traps make activator's camera rotate toward them, use it to make them miss their fast vaults
---
always put one or two traps down next to a hooked survivor
---
when walking around, put a trap down just because you have so many
---
if the survivor vaults a window, put a trap down on the other side. if they decide to come back, they are fcked
---
if there's an activated trap on one side of the pallet and you're on the other, don't teleport right away. wait for survivor's move. (as currently they have a hag on both sides, they might try to vault back to avoid your teleport)
---
If you go higher in ranks you might play with better players, but aside from that there‚Äôs really no point since DBD does not offer rewards for being a high rank at this time.
---
I know right
---

Make her another fresh mori animation with the bear traps where she actually says "Game over..." into their ear before manually setting it off or some shit :))

Being there in our body would allow us to:
---
Sprint instead of jogging like your life isn't in danger.  
---
Go prone.  
---
Climb on top of stuff so that the killer can't hit us.  
---
Grab hatchets from the lockers to defend ourselves, especially for survivor-sized killers.

I don't think the devs care. Those who already have the game already paid, they don't want to scare potential customers.
---
What i get punished just bc my connection is bad.
---
What i get punished just bc i throw a tantrum
---
What i get punished just bc i tell people i don't know that they should kill themself
---
Many of the Killers own teachable perks don‚Äôt work well with them. Franklins was changed years ago to not work when using the Killers power as a large majority of perks that have consequences only work on normal attacks.

---
I think its worse to be kept on the ground for minutes getting patrolled. its wasting everyone's time because the last survivor could go for a risky save but the killer will most likely be close enough for it to be worthless to even try. it just ends up in 3 people waiting for the one dude on the floor to bleed out.

It'd be better if ranks instead affected the Survivor or Killer that you play.

So maybe you're a Rank 1 Hag and Bill, but only a Rank 15 for Doctor and Meg; that would show your progress and skills with that killer, and would help get you set up with others of a similar rank with whatever character they're using.

It‚Äôs such a weak perk and Bubbas such a weak killer just give this to him you don‚Äôt even need to give it to Billy

---
All the Samination stuff is a pure meme mine.
---
More detailed info for interested
---
Preminition seems better for new players, because it tells you where the killer is, but it has a long cooldown and you should always know the general direction of where the killer is (by, for example, looking around, keeping track where the last chase happend or seeing teammates with your Bond or Empathy). Also knowing where the killer is isn't as helpful as it seems. Yea, you might run into the killer when you're not careful but you should notice them before they bump into you anyway.
---
Spine Chill on the other hand has no cooldown and gives you information you most likely don't have at the moment. if it lights up for a "long while" when you're working on a gen, the killer is probably going to check that gen. if it often flashes, the killer is probably chasing someone around a loop nearby. This info is much more valuable
---
Still want other Pigs I fucking hate Amanda she was such a bitch
---
Even though you said "found this gem" I give you up upvote
---
I think it‚Äôs just your mind fucking around with you, because they have a bigger model
---
im not even gonna pretend i coordinated this or that im good at dancing.
---
I remember I was playing Pig long time ago, it was 4 man swf in purple ranks, none of them did any gens ... whole game was me slugging and hooking all 4 of them. It just baffles me that purple ranks don't do gens, are they even trying to win?
---
That is actually a MUCH better idea.
---
So a free 4th fucking hook state for FREE with no need to be unhooked and an insta heal and a whole new chance to loop the killer with FUCKING HASTE and you get it by getting hooked three times I‚Äôm fucking having an stroke holy shit
---
I know alot of people don't want a Xenomoroph as a killer in DbD, but what about Ripley as a survivor?
---
Take my upvote as penance for their sins.
---
Just reset for me.
---
Blocking someone while uncloaking isn‚Äôt holding the game hostage, it would only be if you then refused to hit them

I don‚Äôt think the entity allows that.
---
If you know how to path as a survivor and have a plan balanced landing can save your ass and increase a loop by an ass ton of time also it makes some loops on maps infinite‚Äôs
---
Having it as an perk would mean you can pop it whenever you like. Having it as a one time thing like an offering would be more fair
---
Lmao dat face in the camera at the end got me.

But when stated in the lore, Ormond wasn't placed in Ontario, It's placed in Alberta.

Would‚Äôve been nice to hear Shawnee yell ‚ÄúGame Over!‚Äù When the time on the trap ran out and then your face explodes out the mask.

To completely meme this you can drop Tapp at the killer shack or at the house if it's Mother's Dwelling instead of hooking him but kill everybody who isn't Tapp
---
Here comes the trapper
---
bubba, what's wrong, do you need a nap? :((
---
The fact that they changed that is because legion could wait someone to drop a pallet, activate power and hit them without counterplay. Every gauge killer has to wait a full gauge to use their power (spirit and mers). Why not legion?
---
That was totally a SWF group using the low rank in their party for BMing. This is why I hate SWF; at the very least it should be balancing for the highest ranking member of the team. Fuck this.
---
Or... hear me out.... when she puts the trap on, she says ‚Äúare you going to behave?‚Äù
---
Is at least one aura perk as a killer always mandatory and if so how should one go about making a killer build on a "deeper level"? I feel like i'm limiting my build (and skill) potential by always cruching back to a few such perks like bbq, bitter murmur, nurses or surveillence. I feel like most of the times there's really not much thought behind my picks, and stuff working is more down to luck.
---
Ikr, they haven't even considered touching this spot, it is available sonce before the totem update.
---
Dude that would be killer.

*laughs in Entity*

Bruh.. what?

Yeah it would definitely be ‚Äòkiller‚Äô ;D

I've seen shit....but this is the shit on my shoe.

Yes. Also, Sarah Connor as survivor, and the first Terminator as killer (rotting skin, no eyebrows, red eye, the works).

Hopefully the other person knows you're responding to me.
---
When i click on this post, it shows that it exists, but the content of the message was removed. Perhaps it was removed by a moderator then? I'm not sure. Happy to send you a screencap if you'd like.
---
Yes, it takes some time to accumulate the shards you need to purchase a character. Newer players will feel further behind than older players. Ones who have been playing for a while will have had more time to earn their characters.
---
We're all going to have different feelings on what's reasonable and what's not. It seems like you feel like a lot of this game isn't reasonable, which is fair. Others don't have to share your feelings though. If you feel strongly enough that the game and company aren't fair, then don't support it.
---
When you say the characters should be free, by which I am assuming you feel that anyone should be able to download them whenever, that you feel entitled to new content. Why? Lots of people are putting in hard work on the other end to create that content. Do they not deserve to get paid? What if you went to work every day and your employer felt like you should just be contributing for free?
---
The fact that we are given the option to earn our characters is nice, in my opinion.
---
I'm not pushing any anti-consumer BS, as you put it. In this world, if you want something, you either have to earn it, or you have to pay for it. Simple as that. You can just get things handed to uou on a plate because you want them.
---
I never said the game couldn't be better. In fact, in my original response, I specifically mentioned how the game is getting better over time. Maybe you didn't get that far?

Omg

No, whilst they often help with tracking there are still many other perks that are very good in different builds. Just use whatever works for you!

Oh sorry. Im fairly new to this subreddit
---
Hey, nice fanart \*\_\*  
---
Can i use it as twitch subscriber emote ?
---
The problem with Amanda **SPOILER IF YOU DID NOT SEE THE MOVIES** is she never gave a chance to the people in the trial to escape. This can be seen when officer Allisson Kerry manages to pass the Angel Death trap but still she gets killed because Amanda never let any survivor actually pass the trial.
---
Legit this, even exhaustion perks were useless as he pretty much could catch up to you, now since the changes they are more useful now

Alright man. If you don‚Äôt get it, you don‚Äôt get it.

Do the brighter-colored cosmetics affect the game drastically? As in, do killers actually have a much easier time noticing, say, White Valkyrie or Neon Fanatic Meg as opposed to darker themed skins like Fortune Teller and Track and Field?

---
Not really, I got genrushed
---
Counterpoint: ebony moris ( for example ) might be enjoyable due to getting to see the unique animations, which is fun, but it‚Äôs incredibly unbalanced for the game.
---
Shirtless clown when?
---
If you think that bbq is toxic or op or something really need to learn a few things xD 95% of the killers using is only care about the bps
---
Pop goes the weazel. Regress a gen by 25% by kicking it for 60 seconds after hooking a survivor.
---
Had streamer face camp as Bubba. Then when I went to his stream after to tell him my thoughts he defended it as a legit strategy, explains why he had only 37 followers.
---
You can make multiple offerings. Like theres different moris too.
---
Because I'm leaning forward trying to see more
---
Aha aha aha ha. Funny.
---
So u want an insta kill+ a dropped item. Seems balanced to me. Guessing survivors with items destroy u, to be this worked up.
---
Rank reset is a roller coaster.
---
Tbh im surprised i got this much love
---
Legit this, 100% true, everytime i see a scummy killer im like "yeah he probs has noed"
---
Then the last gen gets done, NOED pops
---

Yeah, man that was uploaded recent

Thank you! I was nervous to post this, but I‚Äôm glad I did!

Oof 100

I feel happy already

I 2nd this

Also promotes to not camp and tunnel
---
Legion needs rework but this is definitely not the way to do it
---
I see something that appeared in Otz livestream, I upvote.
---
Doesn't the huntress have the mind of a 8 year old because her mum is fucking dead and left her to fend for herself. I'm pretty sure she wouldn't even know what sex is when she is confused as to why the little girls she keeps kidnapping starve to death
---
Listen here you little shit-
---
May wish to pay closer attention to your post-game score, to see if there's any weak spots in your BP scoring.
---
Generally the trick is to grind with your best BP earner (for starting survivors this is usually David with We're Gonna Live Forever) and then use the BP surplus to pick up Perks and/or upgrade your *favourite* character. Once your favourite has We're Gonna Live Forever, you can play them as much as you like.
---
If you were playing killer, it would mean Leatherface with Barbecue &amp; Chilli until you've successfully unlocked it on your preferred killer.
---
That doesn't make sense.
---
When the killer DC's you get all the points you had already earned plus the free escape points.
---
So unless your connection crashed, you definitely should have had more points then you started with considering, as you claimed, you played the whole match, basically, before they quit.
---
For me it feels like it zooms out after a while. It's probably mind tho
---
I don‚Äôt think Doctor, Freddy or Ghostface enjoy killing for the Entity
---
PROTECC THE BABY DWEETS
---
u/trash-nea provided a good list, but bear in mind that survivors are all essentially reskins while killers are largely unique.
---
Ruin and Barbecue &amp; Chilli are probably the two most universal killer perks, the value of the rest is dependent on the killer you're running - Nurse doesn't need Enduring or Spirit Fury, for example, and instadown killers don't really need A Nurse's Calling.

Whispers lights up if there's anyone inside its area of effect. This is why you never run Whispers below tier 3, because the lower tiers simply tell you that there's a survivor on your 1/4 of the map. The area decreases as you tier up, so tier 3 means you can finally use it to meaningfully navigate towards a survivor.
---
It is generally used at the start or end of a trial in order to quickly find a survivor. Slower killers, such as Huntress, can use it mid-game to prevent wasted time patrolling an empty map area (faster killers get more benefit from Barbecue &amp; Chilli mid-game, since they can quickly move to any highlighted survivors).
---
At tier 3, to navigate you just walk forwards until it lights up. As soon as it does, stop. Move left, and then right. If it goes out when you move left, survivors are ahead and to the right - and vice versa.
---
If it "flickers" then it means either a survivor is running a small loop at the edge of the radius, or that they're running across a chord of the circle.
---
Whispers is activated by healthy, injured, dying, and hooked survivors - you can't use it effectively if you're aggressively patrolling a hook, or if you're camping.
---
It pretty sure is. In these games I'm not trying to pip or get a 4k, but just wander around the map, using my power and smack some people. If I get a kill great, if not whatever.
---
*Mories the bully*
---
She was definitely worth going to the con! I love the saw movies too, so I got my box collection signed by her!
---
Spine chill is good to counter Spirit, Myers, ghostface, cross mapping Billy boi, wraith and honestly many perks too
---
Plague is manipulated but not crazy. Legion belongs in enjoys killing. And so does pig as this pig isnt john. This one is angela, 
---
angela was a part of one of johns games, and once she escaped she realized how important his games were and became his successor to the jigsaw name. But her games were unwinnable. The moment you escaped a game you still died. And john had to punish her again for it as the games are meant to show you how valuable life is, not throw it away.
---
So yeah pig enjoys her killing
---
Stridor and unrelenting
---
Looks sick
---
Killers standing still at loops is my favourite thing. I know for a fact the pallet/loop I'm at will now last longer, and I'm still stalling the killer to allow my teammates time to do gens. Trust me, there's no feeling of helplessness when a killer stands still and stares at you on a loop.
---
I dont believe billy belongs in the forced into killing by entity
---
As he was already fucked up mentally by his family
---
Also, don't forget the clown!
---
Thanks!
---
Dead hard po Polsky jest Wytrzyma≈Çy skurczybyk ü§£
---
I agree with that completely
---
I don‚Äôt Michael is a fair comparison because you have to personally build it up. However I see your point so I guess legion needs to be buffed in other ways
---
&gt; ***Don't fall asleep.***
---
BBQ on killers with good map control is extremely powerful. You can hook and start another chase immediately. Btw when I play killer 80% of the time I play huntress so I use BBQ also to try some cross the map or just long distance hits. When you get one it's like a drug. One of the most satisfying thing in this game
---
Me but without noed tbh. But honestly complaining about BBQ and ruin makes you look like a whiny bitch baby, because no one thinks either of those perks is op.
---
You can't see shit with hag since you're so low to the ground. Not saying shes bad but i have trouble finding people and chasing them so i dont like playing her.
---
XD!!!!
---
What a pussy
---
yes
---
If turn into a blendette REALLLLLL fast lmfao.
---
You might have a bug, I haven‚Äôt seen a splinter in like 700 hours.
---
ETA is short for Estimated Time of Arrival, my dude.
---
Rn I'm running pop goes the weasel, ruin, bbq, and nurses. Works pretty well. Another build I like to do is use the same build but replace ruin with devour hope. A lot of survivors are afraid to touch your hex totems when playing spirit if there's no ruin. So, you can usually go around one shotting everyone. Once the 1 shots come in to play it snowballs and then the moris begin. It's the meanest thing ever but I love it.
---
The toxic series is just him running each characters unique perks. He'll 360 people and loop and make fun of them in the commentary but there's very little actually toxic play imo. Im a big noob3 fan.
---
I only stay when the killer is close by. I don't teabag or anything, I just wait go give them some points if they want them. if they don't hit me in a few seconds I will just leave
---
Why would survivors do this too me? I thought I was glitching out....
---
Damn it. Those toxic survivors. I'll probably snitch rat them next time... if they let me die for it.
---
Why?
---
Yes as killers you notice brighter cosmetics easier than p3 Claudettes however as you move up in ranks you usually start to care less about being noticed since most people get fun out of chases so it doesn't matter if you get noticed. 
---
However if you play stealthy and don't like chases you should just go as a blendette
---
There goes all my hentai ideas
---
Thats a great question that you should perhaps ask yourself.
---
Nice, If only I wasn't like 1000 miles away from my house and forgetful then I would go to a convention like I did last year
---
Why am I getting downvoted tf I didnt think that was real
---
Are they supposed to not be there if you already own the killer? I have all the killers and they pop up on my blood web a lot.
---
When the game came out Dwight was the weakest survivor, then the memes came out that Dwight‚Äôs just hide in lockers
---
I would facecamp her the entire game. Don't care if i depip or let everyone escape that bitch is going down.
---
then don't group like that. one good survivor can break the entire experience for a not very experienced killer, letting everyone escape easily. ofc, the killer should just notice that this person is too good and switch targets, but that's a bit much to expect from an unexperienced killer
---
I know I hurt all these killer mains feelings. they rely on all these crutch perks just to face camp LMAOOOOO
---
Cringe
---
Well I hope someday you are able to make it to one! My boyfriend bought the tickets as a birthday gift to me, so there is always hope that one day you‚Äôll be able to!!!! And I hope you do!
---
I've done this so many times lol
---
Explenation lol
---
I love this idea OP, the lore of the killers has always been really interesting to me.
---
Billy a nurse thrive off that info since they can go across the map really fast that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs good on them it‚Äôs good overall but especially so on them.
---
I hope it's okay if i just still play the game.
---
these were question from the perspective of toxic potential customers. Quite strange that you think a person would use these as an point.
---
Never DC'ed never told anyone to kill themself and never throw a tantrum.
---
Servers cost like nothing and no one is scared away because of them, only people that are "negativly" affected are lagswitchers.
---
I am proud of this community. The post went negative.
---
Not that I think this a bad ide, by all means, tune into a dev stream an throw it in as a suggestion.
---
 But, there are alot of other things the devs are working on/still need to work on before something like this comes under their attention scope.
---
This would for sure help people that only view the game become much more involved and potentially increase game population/popularity.
---
The Killer downed me Wahhh Wahhh Waaaahhhh!!!!!!!  
---
What did you expect him to just let you go?
---
Everyone gangsta‚Äô until people start laying bear traps and teleporting IRL
---
Add-ons make a killer a lot stronger. Nurse is okay, can't say the same about her add-ons.
---
If you truly are 12 you shouldn't be here :P TOS states you need to be 13+ to create an account.

Idk, i seem to find plenty of manchilds... They're usually anywhere between 20-30.
---
Yes that is also true, but I was thinking that someone outside of the game could do it, i don't know if it's possible for a regular player to do it so if it's not you are correct
---
Nah everybody here just thinks your a ü§°. Survivor mains included ;)
---
Yeah it would be nice to go cause there are probably a lot of  people I would recognize, like this year BARNEY was there! But I couldn't go
---
omg, such players are so pathetic with their ‚Äúez‚Äù, ‚Äúnoob‚Äù, etc. 
---
don‚Äôt even pay attention to them :)
---
Not authentic enough. The background throws it off. 10/10 costume though.
---
Request approved- SIKE
---
You're a pussy who has to make a new account to talk shit. No one gives a fuck what you think.
---
Then I suggest you put a tad more effort into the construction of your sentences, as it very much so reads as if you are making these points as a player and not as potential consumers.
---
Ye that's why I said it's really powerful on killers with good map control and considering that at high rank billy,spirit and nurse are the most common killers I don't think 95% of them use BBQ only for Bps like he said.
---
I noticed I'm getting better at looping and surviving overall. I'm spending a great time watch PainReliever, No0b3, Monto, Ussylis, and that's paying off. I'll try to pay more attention to minimun detail, like what they do, how they do, etc.
---
It's because it would be too strong. If they are down, they can't use the item anyway.
---
Actually, the little girls die of strangulation when she ties them to the wall with rope around their neck.
---
Fuck off weeb.
---
Preach, brother. Nea is the best survivor
---
go ahead and play with them, but just tell them that playing with you will make it much harder for them. it's still better than most games that straight up don't allow you to play with someone with too big of a rank gap.
---
Look, I know it sounds harsh, but if we go with "the middle" then rank 4 playing with three rank 18 will put you against a yellow rank. does this sound fine to you, when white and yellow ranks are both "nooby"?
---
Ruin, BBQ, PGTW and nurse's. The most fun build imo is gen-grabber. Discordance, surveillance, monitor and abuse, ruin, always with prayer beads.
---
Or...you know.....search survivor perks and read what they do....like a normal person? I mean I'M lazy but not to the extreme, i was watching a Tru3 video and didnt know what a perk from detective tapp does so i searched for it, took me like 20 seconds

Thanks , I'll try not to be too toxic
---
R u being srs bro? ü§î
---
I hope this is what happened too.
---
Idk just checked my inbox n saw it lol
---
Darn it, my cover is blown. I do try and masquarade as a baby Dweet when i use him(nothing but default cosmetics), but in purple ranks, nobody is gonna fall for this ruse, so it's never really done anything to help me.
---
Thanks for that epic Ghostface representation my man
---
Imagine coming back to reality with the ability of setting bear traps and hit with a machete.
---
I used to not be able to tell the difference in some perks- &amp; a lot of them do look similar, like Hex: Ruin &amp; Corrupt Intervention for example- so I just started reading about different builds &amp; memorizing 4 at a time, why they were good, &amp; now I can pretty much tell all of them at a glance. It took about 1 month.
---
The term "genrushing" is one of the most hilariously ridiculous terms in the entire history of gaming.  If I play killer and don't have  a good start and they get a good lead on those gens then bravo to them.  They came prepared, did well and did exactly what they were supposed to do.  Their number one objective...complete all the gens as fast as possible.  using that term is the equivalent of whining because a killer chased you...not tunneled..just chased...like followed too quickly with the intent to injure.  Or complaining because a killer broke a pallet we dropped so now we cant hop over it anymore...that's about what the term "genrushing" compares to.
---
Kinda like the killers number one aim is too kill ALL the survivors...or as many as possible. (Meaning more than the one Dwight in front of you).
---
&gt;The fact that they changed that is because legion could wait someone to drop a pallet, activate power and hit them without counterplay. Every gauge killer has to wait a full gauge to use their power (spirit and myers). Why not legion?
---
Yes but this mechanic has been removed. Hitting a survivor with Deep Wound does nothing and applying Deep Wound for the first time allows you to activate Killer Instinct and go after other survivors to get the most out of Legion's ability by attacking multiple targets. Also, when you hit someone for the first time, it fills your power gauge.
---
Just sit at the campfire
---
This looks awesome, great job!
---
Thanks for taking the time to explain bro :)
---
 Rank 7 üòé
---
It's not "mandatory", but it makes the first and final hooks happen sooner.
---
The importance of the final hook is related to how badly you want a 4k, or if you're trying to claw some points back from getting steamrolled by survivors. The first hook, however, will dictate the pace of the entire game.
---
There's a lot of killers that rely on that first hook, since hooks *generally* take pressure off the gens - mostly it's the slower killers, because faster ones can pressure generators *directly*.
---
Bear in mind that the closer you get to rank 1, the less "dead time" you can afford to have as killer. This is why the fast killers are significantly more effective than the others, and why you nearly always see Ruin and/or Corrupt Intervention in play. Tracking perks are just another tool in the arsenal.
---
&gt; cruching 
---
It's hard to consider a tracking perk a "crutch" perk. How else do you expect to find an immersed survivor? Is crawling around the map as Huntress while gens are constantly being popped preferable to knowing where survivors are?
---
&gt; limiting my build (and skill) potential
---
I'm pretty confident that most of the high-end players are using tracking perks *where appropriate* (tracking is almost irrelevant for "fast" killers).
---
&gt; stuff working is more down to luck
---
This approach will work at the lower ranks, but at higher ranks you're far more likely to have a thrilling game of "Walk around the corn/bamboo while all the gens pop, and then arrive at the Gate for a dance party, GG EZ".
---
If you were to ask my opinion, I feel you're more likely to limit yourself by believing in "objectively" crutch perks - your pool of viable killers is going to be quite restrictive if you refuse to use perks that might actually benefit a killer.
---
Yeah i get your point but i find it really unnecesary since it doesnt add anything to the game. In hearthstone i see how it could be useful since the one watching would like to see the effect of the card and help them plan their own deck, but for dbd there really isnt that many perks that will hinder you looking for it online or in the game itself(if you have it).
---
If the devs do decide to implement what you're saying then i would say they would add it at the very end of the game, when they have nothing more to do or add
---
It‚Äôs also short for Edited to Add, my guy.
---
How many Pools of Devotion are on a map with Plague? Is it 5 or 6?
---
it‚Äôs weaker than her base power to teleport to any trap within 40m
---
Cuz she a thicci
---
Everytime I see Jane i think about "Baby got back"
---
Oh! That‚Äôs A Bonus!
---
You know it‚Äôs possible to build one, right?
---
I agree it's a crutch perk but it's exactly that, a crutch... If you're a good killer you won't use it if you're ok it'll give you that last bit to win but if you're bad you're de-piping anyways, which is a loss
---
Yeah definitely. But you would have to learn to listen for it and figure out which one it could be. 
---
I think the perk that gives you more time to get unhook yourself, as well as a better chance to get out of traps is better. As that as you play longer you'll naturally memorize the totem locations in different maps

But.. freddy is just a dream demon for the only purpose of killing the kids that framed his pedophilic abuse, he would not be interested in murdering random people

tbh, Legion, Plague and Doctor don't belong where they are

I‚Äôm really jealous, I‚Äôm a big fan!!! I‚Äôm glad you had fun OP!

You can use multiple obsession perks but there always will be one obsession. Obsession can change but there always will be one at a time.
---
While true, he can't do anything in this timeframe either.
---
All he does is artificially draw out the game, without gaining anything from drawing it out.
---
Killers like you that ruin the game for everyone. Fighting toxicity with toxicity juts leads to more toxicity.

Just give it a week to settle in and then we'll see

I know he's annoying to deal with, but just like old Freddy, annoying but very easy.
---
How is Legion forced into killing. Lmao
---
9/10 because I like to imagine he holds up your set up in his arms.

\-1 point cause he's still clothed tho.

Make this into and order so we can paste it in every 360 or 4k post.

Oh wow self care got a buff

I'd recommend Whispers to find the first person easy to down them. I use it on Trapper and as soon as Whispers goes off I start placing traps near loops to catch them. I don't bother trapping early if Whispers ain't going off.

I dont know who you watch i have like 8 dbd streamers followed and non of them seriously talks about genrush.

a lot of non rank 1's commenting, obviously it's not hard to get rank 1 but saying you'll eventually get rank 1 isn't the case ive seen people who've played a while that suck ass and can't loop for anything

I go with bbq ruin pgtw and stridor sometimes i swap pgtw or ruin because spirit can end chases insanely fast

I only touch a gen at the start to check for Ruin. Then I look for Totems.

Not sure of the exact date, but probably around the 2nd week of September. Should be about 6 - 7 weeks after the Freddy rework was released if they are sticking to the schedule.

They follow him blind so it does not matter at this point. Besides they have add-ons like Staby wound guide so i would not be suprised if all of them were ready to kill even before entity.

You underrate those items. 1 full heal and time off a gen is nice (although gen decreasing times will hardly do much if you used that time looting instead).

Eminem's song Cleaning Out My Closet should be playing.

What about just for Jeff? I love the idea of unique styled perks for every character, and Jeff is an artist, so it makes sense.

I know it sounds crazy, but NOT ALL killers run the enduring/spirit fury/BBQ/ruin meta build.
---
I have had games like that where the killer is just getting off on trolling me for an extended period of time. It takes everything I have to not disconnect when they do that.  If the killer does a good job I always say something like, that was great!!! If he does the stuff you are talking about I just move on, I refuse to give him the satisfaction of getting upset.

You can actually see which characters were tortured. Wraith, Trapper and Doctor are the most obvious. Trapper has spikes inside his skull, Wraith is, well, a literal skeleton, and Doctor has got this weird contraption on his head that keeps his mouth and eyes wide open.

Would be neat because getting 1 mil just to spend 35-45 levels of a new killer wont get you any decent perks unless you get lucky

I use Botany and Pharmacy often. 2 guaranteed heals and a med-kit unless the Killer decides to take off 2 chests and protect the basement chest or all survivors just seem to be running chest perks.
---
If I come across any other chests, I tend to hope I get a yellow med-kit as that's 2 full heals with Botany. Helps with that chest search time shaved off.

All depends on your playstyle.

I do read them correctly, but your purple rank example is quite "normal" so I ignored it. I'm talking about the extremes, because that's where issues can be spotted the most easily
---
Every single time

Prioritize staying awake just after going gens. My most success against freddy has been spending on 30-40 seconds on a gen at a time, staying mobile and focusing on staying awake. If you are awake freddy loses almost all of his power and just becomes a M1 killer with an occasional fixed point teleport. That teleport is incredibly powerful in the latr game so that's why I suggest moving between gens alot against him. By the time you get to the end game you will have a number of gens almost to completion. I had a freddy game that we did the above and finished the last three gens in about 40 seconds of each other.
---
Thank you for your service to the country
---
Yeah just a rise in the bloodpoint cap would be nice haha
---
Your survive with friend group literally called this out. I'm not seeing a lot of "luck" here dude. Just someone trying to promote their twitch.

Which platform do you play on?

NERF!
---
Yeah I just went against my first new Freddy and had the same feeling. It was a major wtf moment the whole match üòÇ
---
I think if you buy the kill on there own they still show up but if you buy the full pack they stop :)
---
Spirit is incorrect, even though I hate her so much, i still read her lore and it says that after almost dying she swore that she would kill the man that was her father and the entity granted her that, turning her into a malevolent ghost
---
While I cannot say why it's happening it's definitely due to high CPU usage
---
Gen rushing Pok√©mon
---
Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm slightly aggressive, which is the best?
---
Why not just run at the killer instead of DC?
---
100% Spirit. Legion pales in comparison to her.
---
I'd say nurse was killing out of insanity due to her backstory
---
Legion. They are all about making the survivors panic if you hit them all with frenzy.
---
Spirit is hands down way more powerful, shes the second best killer. I love playing her for the jumpscares ane easy 4ks plus her mindgame potential is insane, I've made so many survivors second guess themselves and run right into me. Her power is a bit difficult at first but once you get into the habit of listening really well (use headphones) you'll be able to track survivors right on their heels well enough to cut them off. Plus her perks are really nice, Haunted ground always pops for me so I get easy downs, survivors see a glowing totem and swarm it without thinking, Plus when I'm having bad games Rancor helps me secure a much needed Mori on my obsession at the end.
---
&gt; Getting good perks on a P3 is the hard part.
---
that's the point of P3... If you could become P3 with the best perks in 2 days of play that wouldn't mean anything.
---
It's something ultra optional that is only used to get the skin. And bloody skins aren't even nice on every characters.
---
I like it a lot on Bill, Kate, Spirit, Huntress, Myers‚Ä¶ i think that's it.
---
Well, idk how it would go for me, the last game I played is For Honor, and although I have a decently impressive size, I would instantly lose against any hero in that game in a real fight. But it‚Äôd be cool before getting stabbed, slashed, beaten, toestabbed, ground pounded, throat ripped, ledge killed, or thrown into a fire.

Rank reset or just low rank in general. I can reach green-purple ranks as killer but cant hit 360s consistently.
---
I mean have you played against a good Freddy recently? If he gets ahead of you when looking for the hatch YOU ARE SCREWED. He‚Äôll place a blood trap on the nearest gate switch you‚Äôre on and another at the other gate and you lose. The doors really do need to be further away at times.
---
No u
---
I'm not degrading them. You are just putting them on a pedestal like it's a huge effort to play nurse well. 36 hours is nothing on a videogame. We are talking here about the best killer in the game that can consistently 4k and survivors really don't have any counters to. The reward is way too big for that amount of practice. Being good at huntress is something I could say takes a lot of skill and practice, but not nurse.
---
Yeah, that was me when I saw the post. RIP us.
---
Killers that don‚Äôt bring ruin are baby killers? I‚Äôve seen it all

Cleansing totems is just some of the best bp/hr. I'm pretty sure most players here care about bp more than rank.
---
DCers are the worst which is part of the reason why i like to SWF now.
---
Removed - Uncivil behaviour
---
I am not an expert at programming, but it really shouldn't be black magic to avoid this
---
Depends on the circumstance. Slugging forces a survivor to come pick them up without wasting the time carrying to the hook. So with piggy, intentionally wasting time on a trapped survivor who isn't doing gens isn't a smart move but at the same time if you stumble across them you might as well apply a bit of pressure by slugging so they have to be picked up.
---
Another example is if you down someone and another survivor is there then you have one on the floor, one being chased and one, if they are altruistic, coming to pick up their teammate leaving potentially only one on a gen.
---
&gt;de-piping anyways, which is a loss 
---
Why is depipping a negative? Being a lower rank means your future games will give you more bp because you're paired against worse players. If it was a choice, every single killer would be rank 20 until they farmed all the bp they wanted.
---
Depipping, in the current game, is a positive.
---
Kindred is a great solo play perk. Though I think the reason alot of players don't run it is because they think that they won't be hooked so it won't apply to them and they are wasting a perk spot.
---
If you play a moba game and you feed you feel like you will waste your time so you want to quit - but you can't since this will put your team at a major disadvantage
---
This game from a survivor side is a TEAM game there is no but, you agreed to play on a team and now you are responsible and i am glad they will ban lousy sissy players like you from dc'ing 
---
You want to play solo? If only there was a solo mode in dead by daylight... Oh wait there fuckin is

---
how is it incorrect exactly? she was still manipulated by the entity into killing for it when she only wanted revenge upon her father who funnily was also being manipulated by it
---
Apparently so, I guess being doctor without ruin makes me a bad killer
---
That sounds really nice, and I can definitely track survivors via audio, and I can make mind games work, And her perks are definitely good, but in my opinion legions perks are better, and honestly the deep wound thing sounds great to me, as using it on a cluster of survivors is kinda similar to playing the nurse (which is my main, and I can easily destroy coordinated teams with her) seems more fitting for my playstyle, I will probably pick legion but spirit is right afterwards

"Please don't give us more 2x BP or remove perk tiers, I like the 3k+ hour grind to get everything!"

Like, I accepted P3+ max perks on everyone is a long term goal but currently this game is basically a Korean MMORPG in terms of how much you have to invest to get there. 
---
I've had friends who basically said "fuck this" when I tried to get them into the game on a free weekend but they found out just how long it would take to try and get to the level of the people who were curb stomping them.
---
That's the problem, why NOED is considered toxic. People who use it are not in their skill level.
---
Yeah kinda similar to my beloved nurse. I probably have my pick, thank you.
---
Nice :)
---
I like that take on toxicity and the perk. I hadn't considered it before despite hating being paired up with obviously better people when I was new.

Regardless, you had someone in your swf group literally call out it was on the street. Not much "luck" involved. Also did you gild your own post? Lol

Gain 10/25/50% extra blood points for time spent in a locker or in a corner healing yourself. Points gained with this perk are multiplied by 100% if you manage to DC before the killer hooks you.

Say I'm super hungry, need to use the restroom, move over my laundry, or anything... and I just started a game of dbd. If the game goes well, I'll suffer for 20 minutes. But if it doesn't go well I'd rather poop now and take my -2 pips (the best part of leaving).

*JAGGERS!*

They will punish dc with dedicated servers soon

Both of you look really cute, nice picture!

Oh no, rainbow six Vegas

No they called the standalone survivor and killer dlcs paragraphs on the dev streams way back when
---
This is the best thing I've read in forever
---
This is beyond science
---
Check dev notes
---
&gt;Rank reset sucks if you care about your rank
---
no. rank reset sucks because you get paired with fucking useless teams and die on second or even first hook. they get downed from fully healed in 20 seconds and spend their time urban evading (even without the perk) and walking (because of sprint burst) and stealing precious time.
---
Ayyyyy
---
I never knew I needed this until now
---
Seems like that‚Äôs changed now, considering that Leatherface and Ghost Face are advertised as chapters.
---
You sound like the type of person that deserves to be camped.
---
Kyogre massive weakness to grass too. Can‚Äôt touch it.
---
Haha i tried with Frank, im gonna try susie next. Thank you for your input :3
---
Entity fears no one.  
---
Nurse was insane, Doctor enjoys causing pain for sure. The whole "insanity" tier is wrong imo. 
---
Trapper killed a lot of people before joining the Entity's realm but was tortured by the Entity. As I said Doctor just enjoys causing pain, he isn't insane. Plague isn't insane, she was just doing what she was believing is rightful. Bubba isn't insane as well, he just wants to protect his family.
---
I don't think Billy and Huntress enjoy killing so much. Both are wild people who most likely don't understand what they're doing. I mean, Billy was kept locked by his own parents and kept away from the world and society, Huntress was raised by a forest.
---
Roller coasters are fun, no?
---
"Sorryyyy"
---
watching you not pick a perk on your bloodwebs hurt me
---
you forgot about the biggest change. he could hit you with frenzy over and over again to chip away your deep wound timer
---
&gt; not tunneled.
---
Tunneling is just kill rushing

Damn. People legit getting annoyed with an old meme. Now thats hilarious, I knew boomers couldn't handle jokes
---
He is shit. Probably the worst killer in the game and that's agreed upon by just about every top killer.
---
At the very least, he's bottom 3.
---
The only question is - why didnt you play nea, you know how much potential have you missed?
---
I commented on that post yesterday. Looks like Basement Bubba has come to play
---
You can watch them on YouTube they're not very long
---
*When you cheat to fuck over the killer because you're a baby that can't stand being outplayed
---
I know lmao
---
In all seriousness can we get x2 bloodpoints or something each time someone does DC?
---
I can see this as a potential fun idea, but it needs adjustment on the time. Let's say a flat out 15-ish minutes and 3/4/5% faster time running out per generator completed. so when all gens are done 100s. will only take 75s. to remove that much from the timeline.
---
Totally, my friends love it when I tell the same joke over and over
---
so what if hypothetically only 1 killer at rank 18 is searching for a lobby while there are 4 survivors at rank 12 who want to play a game. they would never get matched and those people would wait for a set amount of time until more people would play. it would be "better matchmaking" if those people would be matched when there is no better constellation at the moment

---
i don't think you understand how the hatch works man, my friend was just guessing that it was going to spawn on the street, also there a multiple spawn points for the hatch on the road too
---
Yeah I was just sayin it wasn‚Äôt just fabricated by the fans though. I think it was either Mathiew or Dave Richard who coined the term. This may not be the exact quote but he said something along the lines of this after someone asked if we will ever get another solo survivor dlc akin to Bill and LF 
---
Dave: were always looking to do new things and see what people like and maybe we‚Äôll do something like leather face again think of it as a paragraph
---
Mcote:paragraph?
---
Dave:yeah you know because a chapter has a survivor, killer and map and this kind of thing is much smaller like a ‚Äòparagraph‚Äô *laughs*
---
So he was joking around when he said that most likely but he is the lore guy so ü§î
---
So then I could go to rapture and get a bunch of super power drugs?
---
What can i say? The artwork inspired me during my morning dookie time.
---
Woah, that's awesome. Very few dbd art pieces convey a creepiness like this one. It's almost as though she's about to reach back and chuck a hatchet through the drawing into the viewer. 
---
Would love, LOVE a Pig drawing if you ever find time!
---
I guide others to a treasure I can‚Äôt get
---
Agreed ü§£
---
Horny on main?
---
Spirit is widely considered a top 3 killer in the game. Her ability to mindgame is unmatched.
---
She's deluded. But yeah, all she wants to do is cure her people. She was manipulated by the entity to change how she cures. _sacrificing survivors).
---
&gt; What you described isn't balance, but Medium Vaults are still, well, balanced.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; It's not that they aren't balanced, it's that vaults in general are screwy right now. You can be entirely through a window, and away from it a good distance, and still get hit.
---
No, you're not getting it. This *is* a balance issue with medium vaults. If I make a killer miss a hit then medium vault through a window, I should be safe. But because of medium vaults being completely indistinguishable from slow vaults **that is literally impossible** and that ***is*** a balance issue
---
YES!!!!!!
---
DBD player base is large worldwide but it reduces drastically depending on the region you are playin. It might not be a problem in US or EU (which I doubt) but it definitely will be in every other region. 
---
These matchmaking posts are annoying because the game is giving you a game instead of having you wait 60 minutes just to find a match. I wish sub mods would start deleting it for oversaturated content.
---
Bruh your really gonna be that guy lol
---
Come at me? You're the first person to respond to me here.
---
I've never met an adult in my entire life (which I suspect is 3x yours, at least) offended by the word rape.
---
Those totems are dope!!!!!
---
I tried making a bloodpoint decor. I'm gonna do better next time. That one was last minute idea.
---
How about you read developer updates before complaining ?

---
it's a bloodpoint icon

Same thing happened to one of my friends once
---
Bubba wanted to protect his fam? I haven't seen the movies so I don't know. He peeled of a guys face, u sure he's not insane?
---
Thank you! :3 They're my fave! I have 2 orders for them already.
---
Skip to the last two minutes.
---
Yeah and??
---
I think you did that to me once and it was terrible, there are less scummy ways to depip
---
You want me to buy the game 2 more times pr grind their accounts and make them boosted?
---
When I first commented they didn‚Äôt know how to hit skill checks. Now they know how to do gens.
---
I am now just teaching them how to run the killer shack loop efficiently and how to drop unsafe pallets and run to better loops. How to fast vault windows from tight loops.
---
Its a process and I just want them to be accustomed to the shit ping and at the same time learn how to play against trash or good killers. Mind you I have been getting queued with rank 20-15 killers and some are legit smurfs. They play on my skill level and my friends would have been getting screwed if they queued solo.
---
yeah but i guess the reason behind it is maybe you lose motivation/hope with each piece that gets taken?
---
Congrats, u/urmomhasbiggay69
---
Kaaaaaaaarl, that kills people!
---
I would never kill people. That‚Äôs like my least favourite thing to do!
---
Just watched scream last night! Looks really good!
---
Weird flex but ok old man
---
For now - until dedicated servers storm in
---
I have dreams I‚Äôm in DbD a lot and I haven‚Äôt even played for a while
---
it doesn't matter if she doesn't know killing is bad and that she is naive, she clearly enjoys killing otherwise she wouldn't have just hunted down and murdered all those people or raided those villages
---
Well, guess I'm playing Killer that week. I'll be armed to the teeth when I get back and maybe have some difficulty selling it off, though.
---
I think the next killer should be frank from house party
---
A Killer with Hydro Pump would ba amazing.
---
Plague...sort of has it.
---
Just like on pc. Except Nurse, Huntress and Wraith and survivors in those dlc you need to buy too (shards or real money)
---
What you are saying makes 0 sense. I very rarely get such bad match making and my queue time is never longer than 5 minutes. You don't need to wait 60 minutes for a balanced match in a 20K player base game.
---
Then they accuse you of tunnelling.
---
Imagine coming back to reality
---
If you have a function in your game that is supposed to be a middle ground between a slow and fast vault but that middle ground, functionally, is no different than the slow vault and it is by design, then it is a balance issue, full stop
---
Imagine reality
---
I agree with Myers‚Äôs place. He is easily the most evil out of the Entity‚Äôs killers.
---
I roleplay a little as Killer, in that I will stab whoever is nearest to me, because slashers tend to stab people without being overly concerned if they already have a boo-boo.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt dream of it.
---
We all enjoy this one!
---
Three seconds is a major stretch.  You went down same time as the pallet.
---
Randomizing all 4 perks seems more rational
---
People would DC 10x worse than now
---
Yea I think it would be cool
---
A mode where it gives u four random perks during the loading screen so ya never know what perks ur spawning in with
---
Yes because the devs have always been so good about using our feedback and turning it into something that doesn‚Äôt meet even a tenth of our measly expectations
---
Green hydro pump, yum.
---
no im just an idiot dw, i didnt even think about the bloodpoint icon.
---
Don't you know ? Being a killer makes you a baby killer.
---
Yea the police would be down for that
---
yeah i realize im an idiot now
---
Isn't there an add-on where if your the obsession you can't wake up
---
Costas Mandylor.
---
On paper this idea looks fun but might make the games a bit too RNG.
---
Now this does put a smile to my face.
---
I know what u mean but when all 4 survivors have them it takes about 10 seconds to finish a gen
---
Yeah, and maybe the Xenomorph can set down eggs like the hag that spits out facesuckers to survivors who get close
---
I would‚Äôve put Ghostface a lot higher. Keep in mind the floating tendrils were a gift from the Entity which means...Yea, it must like him a lot lol
---
This is true
---
Prick
---
Already has it bruh
---
Not very? It's usually pretty easy to tell what perks a killer is running. Totems aren't exactly hard to find (or matter for the most part, it's easy to power through ruin)
---
On top of that, if he's dumb enough to let himself get sniped for 14 days... I don't even have words. 
---
Put up an overlay, interact with your stream for a while, queue at some point no one will know. Put delay on, do something to help yourself. I know that true, unless he changed since his fgc days, isn't the most charismatic or entertaining guy so it might be hard for him to fill time, but he could've done  something.
---
No, surprisingly not. BHVR plans to add this feature, sometime in the future. They're working on it anyway according to the August Dev update.
---
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THERE ARE NO OTHER ASYM SLASHERS ANYONE PLAYS.
---
White Noise 2 and Damned are dead, so your options are DbD or F13, and F13 is deadlocked by its lawsuit. If you're REALLY desperate, there's Soul at Stake, which looks janky and has paid DLC killers.
---
So...IDK, gloating at prisoners you can't confirm actually play isn't an attitude I like in my devs.
---
GhostFace is officially one of the easiest DBD cosplays. Lol still a pretty cool pic nonetheless. I would love to cosplay one day.
---
Yea but so are the killers:  
---
Fucking Sprint like the maniac you are.  
---
Insta down and mori you. Why even hook?   
---
Use hook as weapon. Do a scorpion and Yell:‚ÄùGET OVER HERE‚Äù. 
---
Will use the locker to crush you
---
agreed, just stomped 8 games and only got 1 pip each...
---
Doctor enjoys killing for his test, he's insane but that's not the only reason he kills.  He using his "torture" techniques (his add-ons) and the trials are like test so he can perfect "mind control" like in the end of his lore.  Reading his add-ons you can find out that they're his "treatments".  "I CAN SEE THEY'RE DISGUSTING ILLNESSES", "BREAK THEY'RE IMPURE BODIES", I believe are two of his purpule add-ons and M&amp;A is "TIME FOR YOUR TREATMENT".  While he's crazy he's still intelligent, if you get what I mean.
---
Might upload an actual screencap later when I feel like it. Just woke up so not feelin like editing pictures outside of my pbone right now.
---
I mean people in the lobby would be able to see how many perks are allowed to choose their perks from there. If they hate the number they can dodge the lobby.
---
There seems to be a lot of DbD dreams, I guess it‚Äôs just subtle brainwashing. I‚Äôve had like 3 dbd related dreams for some reason lol
---
but here disconnecting will help my team... if i'm the one on the ground. its not being a sissy player. I don't want to wait while being on the ground. my teammate wants the hatch. disconnecting in that case is a win win. 
---
Also you get so angry over this its kinda sad. no need to insults like that when we could just have a conversation.
---
Seeing her eyes is freaky
---
Great job!
---
i dont really want a powerful killer since im really good at the nurse, i just want a killer that is fun to play and has coll animations and crap. i know that the spirits attack and phasewalk animations are really good but i just like legions more, plus legions playstyle kinda matches the nurse's
---
I think that rng is the most stupid thing in this game
---
It was a meme build for no hooks
---
And that‚Äôs a problem because?
---
if your petty insults and mocking about something that wasn't even my opinion is just your style of talking then i feel sorry for you.
---
I think rank reset is kinda needed tho
---
lucky cunt indeed lmao
---
Hey good job on stealing other peoples memes
---
Leave my boi Frank alone
---
More shirts on Myers, you got it.
---
Nah why even downvote? If y‚Äôall want to downvote something. Downvote me instead
---
I have this exact comic on the table in front of me as I read this meme.
---
I‚Äôm loving the mastermind memes. Great movie.
---
Yeah with the endgame timer clocking down and the killer LITERALLY knowing when you‚Äôre fucking awake will surely make a difference bud.
---
Shoulda been a killer main!
---
Survivors have shitty resources.
---
i mean i do play as the killer 100% of the time  so that'd be sweet
---
[perfect time to post this](https://youtu.be/AAbSJgOHTqo)
---
Trapper: oh now you are butt dancing, *So Mature!*
---
It would actually make the devotion ranks worth while
---
not in its current form. Its just fucks over new/Bad players
---
Legion is a very straightforward run at you killer who applies a lot of pressure and forces survivors to mend and heal. I love him. He‚Äôs not the greatest against red ranks unless you are a solid killer anyway, but he‚Äôs my main, and I enjoy him a lot.
---
&gt;What you are saying makes 0 sense. I very rarely get such bad match making and my queue time is never longer than 5 minutes. You don't need to wait 60 minutes for a balanced match in a 20K player base game.
---
Good for you, I guess. Your experience doesn't change the fact that on certain regions at certain times (late in the night or very early in the morning) the amount of players available is very low. 
---
Again, 20k worldwide. There isn't 20k players in OCE, there isn't 20k players in SA, Asia, etc and within this reduced population in each region, there isn't 20k killers to match all the survivors ranks. I don't get why this is so difficult to understand.
---
You either have a wider matchmaking or you sit in queue forever until you get the perfect match with the perfect ping.
---
Ah, thanks! I have heard about it a fair bit lately so I just sort of assumed it was a somewhat "meta" perk. Still pretty new to the game, so I'm still learning the ropes when it comes to perks.
---
Just realized you're a dev! Awesome that you guys keep an eye on Reddit! Loving the game so far and can't wait for the next chapter!
---
It aint no pig - he doesnt know where you wake up, if the exit doors are too close its gg for almost any killer anyway, besides you can always open the gate to 20 percent and then continue - the first red light flashes after 20 percent progression, but i think you prefer to complain on reddit rather then trying to get better
---
If you wanna make memes, at least try to make them funny, and wtf does it have a screenshot flair
---
Thankfully I was playing Killer. So the only thing I have to live with is the fact that at least 3 people aren‚Äôt coming home after that game
---
The hatch doesn't spawn in until a certain number of gens are done. Since there weren't any gens done, it wasn't even visible yet to anyone. When he became the last survivor, it automatically spawns and opens. Watch it again, you can see it appear on him.
---
Can't wait! Xbox has been nothing but swf in the green ranks.
---
I did hit a survivor there too, playing as the Nightmare. I got reported cause he was thinking I was using a glitch.
---
Or Jane
---
I hate when a TTV D/Cs against me but they didn't have their stream on :(
---
I wanted to see the rage
---
Oh that's just so cliche. I aM sOrRy YoU aRe SaD. If words control you so much you need to get help because the world is full of mean people that are not just fucking around like me
---
Who hurt you?
---
I never said I pull the plug every single time I lose. As a rank 6 solo q survivor I lose a lot tbh. I DC under certain circumstances but usually I just kill myself on first hook

Not too bad!!!!! I may hit you up soon!!!
---
We need more people like you tbh. Too many people forget that it‚Äôs just a game
---
He likely did, but survivors jump faster than killers can close.
---
Also, he was a hit preoccupied with the whole wiping blood off the knife.
---
I don't get it, what you are talking about? The key binds are role specific, aren't they?
---
Still means the killer is gonna have to hook everyone 4 times and encourages camping.
---
Doesn't happen with me, weird.
---
He was the first i made, never made masks out of paper machete before, got better with the other 2, im gonna redo him later. Lol
---
The game is already lost if I loop the killer and go down just for people to be doing fuck all around the map lol I‚Äôd rather get into a new game 
---
And no, my Ethernet plug is within arms reach, all I do is pull it out, put it back in and I‚Äôll be sent to the DBD loading screen and ready to start another game. You just gotta deal with it lmao. Alternatively I just learned I can dashboard and not be penalized but they take around the same time so whatever

I didn't say you did. I just said people make builds for fun outside of the basic and boring meta.

---
Hex:ruin should be enough for you to roll your face on the keyboard long enough to 4K every game, good luck.
---
i feel like to do even decent as survivor i have to bring the exact same perks everyone uses every time (balanced landing, borrowed time, self care, urban evasion, decisive strike etc.) but as killer i feel like it doesn't matter what perks i bring because they generally barely change the experience. maybe i don't have the right perks yet but every killer perk seems to have a caveat, and the one perk most people agree that you need, hex ruin, they'll get the generators complete within seconds anyways or get the totem immediately, i just feel like most of my perks don't come in useful during the game and i have to rely on NOED, which can also be cleansed
---
In my experience it's a good way to get the other survivors to equip an Escape Cake. ~~Even if I'm guilty of it too~~
---
NC does not show survivors mending, snapping out of it, or waking up. Strictly healing actions.
---
Don't work/word too hard.
---
I think so. I stopped counting because no one ever uses jake and I've had the others for so long now that I don't remember. I just switch to bubba every time I see a Jake and check after the match is over to see if I got it so I can finally quit using bubba.
---
Thanks I appreciate it ! And I agree, i always try to save my bloodpoints for the future but I'm always in need of more to spend, there so much to unlock it's hard to save some especially with 1 million as the gap
---
Excuse me.
---
*what the fuck*
---
That's when you farm them and maximize your stocks once more
---
Look at how many people think Pre-Nerf MoM was balanced and you'll know why asking the community at any rank is a bad idea for perk balance.
---
Oh you mean those 2 perks wasted so we don't get camped by the countless degenerate killers who can't do anything but stare at a hook? Those perks that don't do anything unless you're a scumbag piece of shit killer with autism? You're complaining about those?
---
Fatigue time generally isn't a muscle memory issue, no, but your chosen combo has a difference in charge speed - which *will* have an effect. The pairs I've suggested match the charge speed like for like.
---
I messed up on White Nit Comb - it should have been Metal Spoon. I'll correct my original reply, thanks for spotting that!
---
Seeing how the mods read Reddit and how you are such boastful about it, i Hope the dc penalties will be harsher, and I Play pc anyways and killer so i couldnt give no fucks about a survivor dc or not, i want the community to be more healthy , but then you could behave like a spoiled kid and learn nothing
---
Step 1: Run OoO
---
Step 2: Run the killer around for the whole game.
---
Step 3: Realize the killer actually isn't a baby but is a high rank that also had the rank reset
---
Step 4: Get owned
---
She's overpowered and so is spirit, only noobs call it viable because they are relying on them as the crutches they are "Spirit/david".
---
~Killer has disconnected from the game~
---
She is, indeed, my favorite killer! I just got III-50 with her last night! The Saw chapter is what got me into the game and a year and a half later... well, now I have like 13 other killers and 15 survivors to prestige!
---
jesus fucking christ
---
Honestly surveillance will slow gens better than ruin in the purp green ranks especially if paired with overcharge or pop... That's just my opinion though
---
being reaaaaaaal generous with the time
---
Yeah, because it's so much fun for red rank killers to be paired up against rage quitting potatoes.
---
You kinda have a point but i think some members of the community aren't too biased. For example, TrueTalent generally makes sense with his suggestions.
---
I love when they follow you around all game trying to get your attention. No thanks, I'm going to go for the survivors who are actually doing things.
---
then you would just be a cool killer and spend the rest of your time hunting down and killing survivors
---
I‚Äôm a Spirit main so obviously biased but I personally find her not only more fun but more rewarding when played well. I feel like Legion is fairly easy to pick up and learn and even do well with. Spirit takes some practice to do well with, particularly in higher ranks, but when you got those 3-4ks using her power efficiently, it is super gratifying and feels earned, if that makes sense. 
---
Perkwise, I‚Äôd argue that Spirit has more to bring to the table for most of your killers than Legion, but Discordance is a great perk, especially on Spirit, Nurse, and Billy.
---
Because i called you as inteligent as a rotten grape? Now these are some serious fucking insults. I am sorry for calling you that, i am such a scumfuck dicksucking ballslicking stinking homeless godbastard to do that
---
Yes you not seeing the obvious sarcasm was pretty dumb - should i apologize you for it?
---
Every single game I've played today has been up against Ghostface (Which is fine, if annoying) and I've had half the team DC when they get downed.
---
Rank Reset makes me legit not want to play the game until a week after the fact.

survivor is pretty unfun. so when i'm playing survivor i'm going to try and do things like this that are fun.

How about you don't make that post in the first place and do some research ?
---
You have a flair of ash and I liked the fact that I read it in his voice why are you booing I'm right
---
STBFL on huntress sounds like the biggest brain play I've seen in a while
---
I think you also couldn‚Äôt kill them right? And if survivors sabotaged a hook then it stayed down the entire trial too (could be wrong on that one)
---
AND have fun chasing megs who would get multiple sprint bursts during a chase because exhaustion‚Äôs cooldown was in-effect while running.
---
Let‚Äôs not forget infinites

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cpv607/new_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Then it's against the rules since he's not blocking out the other player's name.
---
Still, he's most definitely Salty AF.
---
On the other hand, 45 seconds of chase for 108% movement speed is pretty bad for a perk
---
Oh how I miss the old double pallets and pallet vacuum, the double sprint burst in one chase, getting d-striked  on the first chase, the good ol' time.
---
What about bubba
---
Yes police, this man right here.
---
Thank you so much it makes doing this even better its people like you that keep me going
---
You probably should if you're actually a newer player. High ranks are nothing to aspire to get to, they're honestly just a pain in the ass.
---
Sounds like we would get along as teammates!
---
\*coughs\* double pallet loops
---
Yes, you truly are
---
That‚Äôs nothing compared to how often gold is used by astroturfers. Considering how large reddit is, it‚Äôs a bit silly how much exposure a top post on a default sub can get. Gold drastically boosts the odds of getting it to the top.
---
When there are 3 gens left it appears but it's still closed, or if you're the very last survivor alive it appears opened but the killer can close it
---
Red hydro pump, yum.
---
Thank you so much I appreciate you spending your time to see it
---
Matters which it is though. Might want to avoid that with Micheal...
---
Are you sure it goes off for hooked survivors? That would be super trash
---
I know kids in school are, well, kids, but all because someone is 20+ doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre any better, in fact they‚Äôll probably rage more or be more toxic
---
Fucking awesome!! Talented!
---
this is the best spot i‚Äôve seen the doctor on one of these tier lists
---
I mainly run distressing on bubba cause it stacks a ton of blood points with bbq and it causes people to react incorrectly to my presence. As I get to higher ranks, what purpose does the perk have outside of Doctor?
---
Your friend is what is professionally cataloged as a "Fuck Bucket".
---
Maybe even instead of 9 leaves, 9 steps of ban length. You get so many games before progressing to the next stage in ban length. Say 3 games. Once you get your 10 minute ban, you sit through it, and ragequit again. Well instead of going to 30 minutes right there, you get another 10 minute ban. After 3 10 minute bans, it progresses to 30 minutes. So to get the perma ban you would have to leave 27 times in a row over the course of 3 years, 3 months, 3 weeks, 3 days, 5 hours.
---
Thanks random kind stranger for gold
---
You clearly have self control issues. Have a little dignity. Calling people autistic degenerate scumbag pos no matter what they did in a video game shows how little integrity you have as a person. I recommend you take a break from video games and work on your mental health. And aside from your issues that's not how decisive strike and borrowed time are usually used at high ranks. They are used to play extremely aggressively against the killer. Only occasionally are they used to actually counter tunneling and camping. You will learn this from either A. Playing the game at high rank or B. Watching someone who does, such as tru3talent.
---
Gotta love when killers lunge when it‚Äôs way better to get close for a guaranteed hit
---
r/suspiciouslyspecific
---
Thanks
---
Me out of hatchets... me get... MORE hatchets!
---
I actually desperately want to see some Mystery Dungeon-esque Pokemon hiding from Trapper Kyogre now.
---
Those same people probably don't run BBQ anyways, and any amount of tokens would be worth as many as none
---
I have over 1k hours on pc and this just started happening like 1 month ago, dedicated servers will fix that to some degree since survivors will need to connect to the same server as you, and si≈Ñce they will have shitty internet you wont be abused by this
---
Susie didn‚Äôt want to kill and the entity likely tortured her and she snapped. Showed by the unique mask and the fact that she is the only one of the legion that is smiling when you take off the mask
---
While the killer might not see your aura, it's still being read, and thus consumes a token
---
Ah yes, the killer deserves to lose points and their fun because they used something the game have them to kill survivors with. You're toxic and you're literally just fueling the us vs them mentality that makes the game worse. Grow the fuck up man imagine getting so pissed at a games perks (a game where winning and losing don't matter) that you feel the need to not only complain in a game chat or a message but actually come to Reddit and insult people for playing the game and trying to enjoy it. If you can't handle go play something else
---
But thats also bannable farming with the killer and helping him to kill the survivor..
---
And you also can give them the video so they can ban  him if you want :) or i can do it but the problem you didnt show his name.. shame
---
It is annoying that like all the skins they‚Äôve released for the last while have all been $10 (and even $15), especially when there‚Äôs still so much wrong with the game. Plus, the game costs money to buy (I bought it back when it was more than $20). With other games that have cosmetics and stuff (like overwatch, fortnite, etc) it‚Äôs either one or the other (overwatch costs money for the game, but everything in game can be obtained for free just by playing, and can be very easy to obtain; with fortnite the game is free to play and skins cost money, but not all of the stuff gets to ridiculous prices). But also, the companies/dev teams that work on those games are also constantly working on improving their games, doing incredibly quick bug fixes.... meanwhile, dbd is still pretty broken (though they get a little better fixing some things lately).
---
Should you play more on/during rank reset, or wait a week for the effects of rank reset to die off?
---
(Playing for pips, not fun)
---
Holy shit this is gorgeous
---
Already happened.
---
Im guilty of doing this  because I can tell the killer wants 4k. If there are 2 survivors left sometimes the killer leaves someone in the dying state so they can find the other person instead of hooking them. They don't want the last person escaping the hatch.
---

---
No offense this looks scarier than the ingame one
---
 To be fair, hiding takes very little effort. Just don't go on gens, urban evade all around and use iron will. It takes minimal effort, and if you could somehow pip off it at the end of the game, the game would become awful, because you'd have survivors farming pips who'd do nothing but hide in a grass and unhook you, and never even touch a generator
---
Np have a nice day and please its not like i dont want you to play with this man but its just uh be careful ;-; you dont know what will happen to you when you play with these people y-yikes
---
imagine complaining about Huntress
---
Well he is my friend. I don‚Äôt wanna detray a brother like that but the first person that died said they did that so we‚Äôll see if he gets banned :)
---
To be honest,  when I started playing dbd, I had A lot of dreams about it. Kinda weird to me since I never had dreams about games and I play video games for 20 years
---
Buffing something to make it god tier is not the solution to a bad perk
---
Huntress? Really? lol
---
Back in my days, you wouldnt get the hatch since you didnt do at least 2 gens
---
*Angry veteran noises*
---
this except its purple rank survivors that still can't survive more than 4 seconds in a chase before rank reset even happened
---
At Bloodlust 1, she is slightly faster than Survivors, yes.
---
Well, proxy camping. I know they usually don‚Äôt but the last two hunters I played against did :(
---
It's not that i can't handle insults. its just that this community already has enough toxicity. Would be pretty neat if there could be a normal conversation with 2 people that have different opinions that doesn't go to your kind of behavior.
---
I'm imagining and still can't believe it
---
but
---
Well bad or not, they are last alive nonetheless. Don't think of it as a reward, think of it more as a balance mechanic; no matter how well or not you played, you shouldn't have to complete the last generators by yourself and/or escaping from a certain death by endgame or killer
---
Good job mate
---
Freddy's new effects are pretty neat, but I suspect they were also really time consuming and resource heavy
---
Ugh cant wait to play survivor today with rank reset....not.
---
.
---
Don't know if the Killer's a potato or you're a god.
---
True, thanks for the heads up, have a good day
---
I would like to add that I'm going to argue my points of why i think they are not.
---
All speeds in m/s.
---
Survivor running speed = 4.0
---
Nurse walking speed = 3.85
---
Bloodlust 1 (15s) = 4.05
---
Bloodlust 2 (30s) = 4.25
---
Bloodlust 3 (40s) = 4.45
---
You'll only start to gain on them at Bloodlust tier 2, after 30 seconds. Blinking will immediately reset your speed.
---
You'd arguably get more benefit from Agitation, Iron Grasp, and Mad Grit, at which point you're basically a meme build.
---
*At least until there's a Bloodlust perk...*
---
Am I missing something? Help?
---
You can probably loop a rank 20 killer for the entire game, just because they'll cut corners really wide, respect pallets and not even try to mindgame, so you can just hold Shift+W forever without even trying
---
I don't think the killer themselves are over-powered. If I were to try and play either of them I would fail miserably. 
---
They are only incredibly strong in skilled, capable hands. It is the player that makes them strong. 
---
Everyone complaining to nerf them doesn't understand the skill required to actually be really devastating with these killers. Should we nerf players? No. 
---
You just went against a really good player. Applaud them and move on to the next game.
---
im sorry to be like that... but god bless the person who did that üôèüèª and i hope he will get a ban like for one week so maybe he will learn something from it^^
---
I see this as an absolute win!
---
/s means sarcastic my guy
---
Bbq isn't that strong a perk unless used with Billy and nurse.
---
Spirits stronger and has spirit fury which is almost a must for m1 killers spirits stronger too (not a fan of playing her myself tbh) so yeah get spirit fury unlocked for the rest of your killers then get legion sometime in the future!
---
Woah woah hands in the air r/emojipolice here
---
Breaking post rules
---
It's the Entity slowly taking us to its world.
---
‚ÄúOh the survivor is woke, He‚Äôll surely try to escape through one of the 2 hatches‚Äù better start actively patrolling for Switch lights
---
One of her perks is literally describes her having such a lust for the kill that she forces the entity out of her mind and becomes completely unpredictable. She absolutely likes to kill.
---
Bubba straddles the line between insane and retarded
---
what
---
You ruin the game for the killer - isn't killer a person who also deserves respect? Or are they dogs who work for your fun and you can just disrespect them however you like
---
I used a real candle to show, but you can use flameless tea light candles
---
You can't tell me it doesn't look suspicious af.
---
Bht where is tap
---
strong flair
---
The totems are better than the totems in game, the amount of detail is insane. Trapper‚Äôs mask is the only thing I dont really like
---
PGTW is godly on Freddy since he can teleport to gens so definitely go and unlock Clown's teachables
---
PGTW works well with Thrilling Tremors (Ghostface) since you can see which gen is being worked on and can teleport to it.
---
you can go for Hex: Ruin (Hag) 'cause Ruin and Pop both together are annoying to deal with. 
---
you can also use BBQ (Leatherface) instead of TT for information and bloodpoints as well.
---
in high ranks you'll get looped a lot so it's not bad having an anti-looping perk on your build such as Brutal Strength (Trapper), Enduring (Hillbilly) or Bamboozle (Clown). 
---
so PGTW, Ruin, TT and a 4th perk slot by your choice. you can use NOED but i don't think you need it since you have 3 perks that slows the game down a lot so don't be insecure about your playstyle or afraid that survivors will get out, you can do great without it :) . imo, it's better to play with 4 perks the whole match rather than 3 and risk at the endgame that survivors will get rid of it, especially at high ranks.
---
Umm... That's what I was quoting... (*_*)
---
On PC and believe it or not I am a 51 year old mom of three lol
---
I believe it! I'm a 40 year old father of 3 fur babies! LOL!
---
It's decent.
---
It helps you evade the Killer for longer and the time limit shouldn't matter since the game should be ending soon anyway, but if I'm running a perk as a Survivor that doesn't do anything until the end, Adrenaline is just that much better.
---
Yup. It's pretty unacceptable that his one power is chase but he's mediocre at it. People overrate the Clown because nobody ever plays him. His base gas literally does nothing in a lot of situations. Some loops are safe even if you gas them with Flask Of Bleach. The base reload time for 4 bottles is asinine. I love the aesthetic but I always wonder why I put so many hours into a halfbaked undertuned killer.
---
Their attempting to put stitches in the wound to stop it from bleeding
---
The hatch appears when the amount of generators finished is more than the amount of survivors alive. It opens when there is only one survivor alive.
---
(Though, it is *technically* always there, it only becomes *visible* when the requirements are fulfilled. But that doesn't really matter, just a bit of trivia I guess)
---
Yes!!
---
It's like the organisation from the cabin in the woods they capture and contain monsters like scp 173 which is a statue that kills you when you aren't looking at it
---
r/UnexpectedTF2
---
Idk what you mean by suspicious though.......
---
&gt; They are only incredibly strong in skilled, capable hands. It is the player that makes them strong.
---
I don't think Spirit is OP or anything, but she really isn't that hard to play at all
---
It‚Äôs actually when there are 2 gens left, dunno if it used to be three but it‚Äôs definitely 2 now xxx üôåüôåüôå
---
She was already bringing sacrifices in her lore
---
I get that completely!
---
Half this sub complains about queue times.
---
The other half complains about matchmaking being too wide (rank 20s against rank 10) and they rather wait for a proper MM. 
---
Go figure.
---
No! PC killer lobbies fill fast enough. You cant have my survivors!
---
I don't know the exact stats on how it chooses your new rank, but I don't think it's too hard to make semi accurate guesses
---
For instance, I finished rank 1 last season, I got moved to rank 10 at reset
---
I'm not sure players rank 18 and up are moved at all though, ive never finished a season at that high of rank. 
---
The exact numbers I don't know, but I went from 1 to 10, and if you were 14, maybe it multiplies the setback by twos?
---
I yearn fot true greatness
---
That is definitely an extremely solid choice. I have some doubts about not running Ruins but its hard to argue against any of those 4 perks.
---
Basically, every time you reach level 100, you gain a level of Devotion.  
---
Before you ask, no, unfortunately Devotion doesn't actually do anything. It's just a neat way of signifying that you're dedicated to the game.
---
Yeah buddy it was already quite obvious that you're just parroting whichever streamer chews up the food for you as you gobble it down without any thought or criticism. The fact is they're both overpowered and true is a killermain who would never admit that, now before you say "but he plays survivor reeee" just keep it to yourself because nobody buys that shit.
---
Gimme kith
---
Thank you so much! :)
---
Yeah, and i tried to see about doing trapper mask, but im not sure, i may do susie next!
---
No printer
---
*hastily opens garden city or sum shit*
---
Just look at it. 100% it is.
---
A killers entire game isn't ruined if one person disconnects at the end if for you it means your entire match is ruined than that's on you. i'm not saying killers don't deserve respect. everyone deserves respect. wasting a persons time isn't respectful. just hook the person on the ground and done. 
---
You can try to make it look like i'm treating someone like shit over this but that's simply not the case. We're talking about this one specific thing. someone disconnecting in this specific case isn't acting like the killer is a dog who works for their ammusement. you keep making this look worse than it is.
---
Ah, I'm sure I just confused 3 gens left with 3 gens done.
---
Moms and dads unite! Lol
---
Looks like your setup is shaping out well, now all you need is a desk!
---
I've played killer often enough. Enough to make up my mind on what i think is toxic and what i think isn't. disconnecting instantly when you go down is toxic imo. Disconnecting when just sitting and waiting for minutes isn't.
---
I love calling everything genrushing when I play killer. Yesterday I had a legion game where I encountered a very inexperienced team who got one gen done by the time I hooked my third victim for the third time. When that gen finally popped I was like ‚Äúwow, filthy genrush‚Äù 
---
My last remaining survivor, Feng, I was patrolling the gates and saw her running to one and even then was like ‚Äúomg look at this disgusting gen rush‚Äù.
---
Tbh i think Ruin is a bit overrated. It will usually grind all gen progress to a halt in lower ranks while they run around like headless chickens looking for the totem, but in purple and red ranks, people will be hitting great skillchecks without much trouble, or will simply work through Ruin anyways. 
---
I was up against a Myers with Ruin today, it lasted throughout the whole game, but 5 gens got done anyways. Did it slow us down? I guess we could have gotten them done faster without Ruin, but it certainly didn't stop us dead in our tracks. Keep in mind he also got pretty lucky to have it up throughout the whole match, as his totem ended up in a good spot. If it wasn't in a good spot, he wouldn't have even managed to buy however much time he did. Is this (occasional) slowdown worth a perk slot? You be the judge.
---
From my experience as a survivor main, the most effective way to stall gen progress is by applying pressure. If there is constantly someone on a hook somewhere, people will too busy going for unhooks and heals to do gens. End chases fast, don't facecamp (as people are gonna just ignore the guy on the hook and pop 2-3 gens by the time he dies if they realise you are camping him), and if you want a slowdown perk, PGTW is a much better choice that further compliments this playstyle.
---
No lol. The eyes look really funny to me, that's all lol. Overall all of it looks really good.
---
Lol you clearly aren't high rank
---
Yeah, first time making paper machete masks. I'm learning more about them, ill get better in the future. Promise.
---
Thanks Entity
---
Well now I will too. It is the Goldeneye 007 cover hand thing all over again.
---
I stopped doing this as almost none of them would say thank you after game.
---
I just let you get 5k extra blood points at a loss to me, show some respect
---
Congrats. They are not that powerful but honestly they have a ton a fun and useful perks
---
Groyle using Dig to escape Kyogre.
---
Probably a he. EnTisticle
---
You don't even have a thought process mate, you just repeat what daddyTrue says and think you sound smart for it, you couldn't even figure out that everything he says is killersided and that he's probably a bit biased towards killers and some would even argue he only plays survivor so he can claim not to be a killermain.
---
You got downvoted for missing the joke
---
My 2 luckiest hatch escapes.
---
1. Crotus Prenn Asylum, avoided Ghostface the whole time until the end. 2 dead, teammate‚Äôs injured, and I get hooked for the 1st time as the Hatch spawns right in front of me. Teammate gets caught and quits, I kobe my butt off and peace out.
---
2. Lery‚Äôs Memorial Institute, SWF, and I brought a purple key. I get hooked inside a room at the end by Clown but my friend saves me. I dip out one door and run right into the hatch. I call my dude over and we escape while Claudette is left to escape. She didn‚Äôt
---
You gotta take your shirt off it is a requirement.
---
So it doesnt bother YOU - because you feel like someone can dc in your game you are free to be glad when someone does and you can change your nickname to "dcme"
---
But this game isn't about you - no killer likes to have their 4k taken from them or play a game with 3 survivors and just because you accept some behaviour it doesnt mean it isn't toxic 
---
People were saying ochido wasnt toxic because he isn't bad and abusing bugs is not bannable
---
I don't want to play with any of these bums. That's why rank reset needs to be removed from this game. I'm a 5th devotion red rank killer getting paired up with these fucking people and I can't stand it. Apparently everything needs a /s next to it on this sub because no one gets obvious sarcasm.
---
Agreed. Survivor on console is a straight up nightmare. Getting quicker lobbies would make it much more bearable
---
that's not that steep. Rank 1 drops to 10. Yeah that's normal it happens on the 13th of every month.
---
&gt;I just wanna play the game I just wanna have fun I dont care about the ranks
---
I understand it. The thing, the other half of the community wants better matchamking. BHVR just can't win.
---
That‚Äôs right baby
---
Wow guys this Michael is so bad, he isn't even trying to chase me and is just looking at me.
---
Says the one who doesn't even understand "abusing pallets" LOL GROW UP
---
No, I just don't want dumb people in my threads. I've a right to control my population. 
---
Deliverance gives points for a guaranteed Kobe. Decisive Strike gives points for a stun. So does Head-On. Items and add-ons give unique scoring events. All examples of non-killer powers giving scoring events, including examples of other perks doing it. Zero reason why this would not follow that same trend and you're narrow-minded for thinking otherwise.
---
I mean I bet being mad at those far more than a mid tier killers add ons
---
Quentin &gt; any other survivor
---
Chill man he was just saying his own
---
I like the entity in the background looming over. But the real talent here is in the detail!
---
Yeah I remembered it was that way before I started playing. But yeah it proves the point even more, they just have to be careful with strong survivor perks.
---
Nurse with no additional blinks actually isn't that awful. But i'd argue that a truly top tier nurse is OP even whitout addons.
---
Firstly you're dumb for thinking winning the game means getting more points. You get 2.5k for killing all 4, but if all survivors died a minute in, you aren't getting shit otherwise. So flawed argument to begin with, as has been your MO. 
---
Second, I don't want people to agree with just me. I want them to agree with facts. Which is what I've been posting. Your ignorance doesn't change that.
---
Nah, those little bitches definitely deserve it. I don't see what's wrong with camping a toxic cunt and letting the other 3 go.
---
Bro, noüòÇ it's not bad. It all looks really good.
---
Lmao
---
After I saw this I went and did the same. Power in numbers.
---
yes this game isn't about me alone. but it isn't about you either. why would you waste a persons time. why is your 4k more valuable than my time. i don't mind losing. i do mind waiting 4 minutes being unable to do anything just for a loss.
---
Nice jukes but the only reason you got away is cause they‚Äôre not good. He should‚Äôve just used the aimbot you get as killer to down you.
---
How is that not luck to have it spawn right under him? Knowing a few of the more popular hatch placements on maps doesn‚Äôt change the fact the timing was incredible.
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only intellect that sees this every time as well üòÇ
---
Yeah, the mask i used has raindrop looking eyes, i tried to make it more animal-like but wasn't working with me, so ill try again another time. And thank you
---
I'm not OP but I bought a few killers with cells and I get them so it seems like it's true. However I only get the ones for Freddy so it may be a bug related directly to him.
---
Nurse on console is actual aids to play. The highest sensitivity is painfully slow considering you need to make quick turns while blinking. Plus the game doesn‚Äôt even get past 30 FPS so good look tracking people mid blink. Props to OP
---
What is the joke
---
Yup
---
You can lunge around the balers in the corn field too if you stand on the bit of metal to the right.
---
Congratulations!
---
First off you're just blatantly wrong.
---
Second off, where do you get the idea that you have a single fucking clue to say this and not even add the "imo" to it? How many hours on this gme do you have?
---
Already has what?
---
More map pressure and powers in chases.
---
Yeah why
---
Imagine a map which slowly filled with water, causing survivors to move slower if they didn‚Äôt also pump water out. Or perhaps a map with flooded areas that the generators would pump out once started
---
But the thing is - what are killers doing to 4k is perfectly within the game mechanics and rules - slugging is in no way shape or form a bannable offense
---
What you and other toxic survivors are doing is not - you are purposely abusing your connection to the game to ruin someone's match and it WILL be bannable when the dedicated servers drop in and i am so glad it will be done maybe a ban or 2 will make you think a bit about your behaviour
---
You dont want to waste time? Then dont play 
---
You want to play the game still? Then respect the game rules
---
I believe you guys have made some really good points that i have struggled to come up with a good counter argument for. But this is how i look at it. My arguement is that with strong enough mind games usually via breaking line of sight and playing extremely unpredictably, she Is jukeable most of the time. I think why many people say she's op is because she requires a depth to the mind games not present in ANY other killer.
---
Is t intentional that the guy on the exit button in the main screen seems to be dabbing?
---
He doesn‚Äôt have to put Survivors to sleep to hit them anymore. Survivors who are asleep hear his lullaby instead of the heartbeat, which makes it harder to tell where he‚Äôs coming from. His add-ons can considerably reduce action speed for sleeping Survivors. His traps and fake pallets only affect Survivors who are asleep.
---
It does, you just don't lose the pips immediately. You will at some point later on though, guaranteed. Dashboarding also registers as a full DC.
---
No problem, good luck with future projects!
---
Ye ik but i want to at least feel like im good lmao
---
Looked at your profile for 20 seconds and instantly know that you‚Äôre a toxic wanker with no other goal than to annoy people. This person is making points that are completely true. You are the one who is blatantly wrong. Fuckwit.
---
Just switch Dark Sense with Spine Chill. You can run away fast leaving tracks to fade away quickly with Sprint Burst and Lightweight
---
But then it turns out to be haunted grounds
---
League of legends. Guess I‚Äôll just sit in fountain and buy items when I can.
---
Okay dude. I doubt we're gonna agree. all i can do is repeat what i already said so i'm not gonna do that. Was nice seeing you can have a somewhat normal conversation and show your points though.
---
The big thing for me is he can immediately right hook a survivor to the chops. He doesn't have to put them asleep and wait like a bellend while they continue doing or finishing whatever it is they're doing. Then there's the fact he can teleport to gens, giving him a ton of map pressure where prior he had -0.05 map pressure. Cherry on top are the snares and pallets.
---
Well yes because hatch is a bullshit broken mechanic that rewards failure.
---
IDC about the real life part I just want to be Billy in-game!
---
True
---
You are obviously skilled at the game I never said you weren‚Äôt. But there were too many times he should have downed you but they kept missing
---
I mean I hate to lower myself to you people's levels but you guys are flat out add holes. Don't you feel bad about your self talking shit and being so aggressive instead of debating like a normal human being? Just because I have views that align with someone else doesn't mean i just repeat everything he says. I don't know why you persist with this bullshit where you act like your some kind of tough guy. Were having a discussion about a video game. There is NO NEED TO BE A TOXIC ASSHOLE.
---
They hated DrKlezdoom because he spoke the truth.
---
Yeah me and my friend the whole match was like wtf is going on
---
Or the killer DCs
---
Based
---
I didn't know about the lullaby or the heart beat part. I haven't replayed him since his rework but I havent found a video that detailed me on the rework so I can know what exactly is going on with him.
---
Nobody asked you triggered nerd.
---
totems are spot on! nice job!
---
She is easier than Nurse, but she still has a skill-cap. Especially to be really good with her. 
---
Sure you can play her, but can you "wreck" with her? You know what I mean?
---
As i was saying - it is not a discussion if you are blalantly wrong and the developers of the game disaprove of your statements entirely
---
lol just cleanse the ruin
---
lol just hide in a locker 
---
lol just loop
---
I might be throwing you into trials for my own amusment
---
But i‚Äôll be damned if I ain‚Äôt gonna be fair
---
"When a survivor suffers from exposed effect, they no longer." Now wtf is this whole post... I don't understand if it's a shitpost or an actual 11 y/o on DbD... I've seen a bunch of 11 year old cringe kids on DbD so this ain't nothing new.
---
There are no limits to the number of stacks you can have. Tier 1 Myers can‚Äôt lose stacks. If he chases a survivor for 30 seconds and downs them, he now has 2% extra movement speed for the rest of the game. If he chases 3 survivors for fifteen seconds each, he has 3 tokens and all of them should be wasting time healing. 
---
Loadout: Scratched mirror, Boyfriend memento with a lery‚Äôs offering. Persistence, Ruin, M&amp;A, Perk of your choice (mine would be brutal strength) . You could easily get 5 stacks, putting you at huntress speed. Any time you enter a chase, you should be able to gain at least one stack, meaning that your speed increases for every chase you enter.
---
[deleted]
---
i think he means the expression on the mask is like the huntress is giving a suspicious/questioning look.
---
Me, what kinda question is this?
---
me
---
A LOT of people. What is your point?
---
The player/players that just beat you
---
Calm down kyle
---
"your opinion is wrong"
---
My advice may seem strange but... don't be upset. Low ranks games are more fun and many people wish they could reset their ranks lol
---
Holy moly
---
Weird flex but ok. (Seriously though nice one)
---
It resets on the 13th of every month, it probably showed you the resets from when you stopped playing and again when it reset today
---
me. Idk why but i don't get bored of it
---
Come on guys, letting the community create a killer is a cool idea
---
Ur mum
---
I think that's the true point of this post.
---
&gt; but can you "wreck" with her?
---
You definitely can. Not like you can with Nurse, but her skillcap isn't as high as you make it out to be. She's also the type of killer where already strong perks get a big boost in their power simply because they are being ran on her
---
Then you get to bully them
---
Nea, meet hook
---
I'll take shit matchmaking  as long as I can actually play and farm my BPs
---
Lol get back in the basement dicknips
---
Ohhh yeah, play with me daddy
---
dont forget actual infinite loops
---
Idk about that, I guess it is just me might just need a break. Even when I win games I find myself irritated with the way the game works and the community
---
With how strong the jawline is, it almost like looks Ash wearing her mask.
---
I don‚Äôt know about radius but I like the idea of any survivor you are performing an action with also benefits (so if you‚Äôre healing or doing a generator with someone it doesn‚Äôt reveal them)
---
Thank god I‚Äôm not the only one who has the problem. I just get looped once it gets down to 2 gens left to compete and the game becomes a nightmare :^(
---
BECAUSE YOU ARE A LEVEL 16 THAT IS 
---
HOW YOU ARE BOTH BIG THICC POTATOES
---
damn myers is daddy
---
I was able to get to rank 12 and then it reset and I'm back to rank 15 as killer
---
Yea but... I want to the very best that there ever was
---
Legion is also my first and currently only killer adept perk, lmao
---
(Hug)
---
That‚Äôs a good question. As far as I know there really isn‚Äôt any professional dbd players so it‚Äôs kinda hard to really answer that.
---
What do you mean "right hook a survivor to the chops"
---
I didn't know we were talking about tru3ta1ent today
---
It‚Äôs not much but it dishonest work
---
did you at least get adept hag
---
If you manage to breakout of the competitive mindset (in a casual game) and try different builds, different plays, your stock of fun is almost unlimited.
---
Bruh, just give up. Alexior is a troll. He knows he‚Äôs in the wrong, but he‚Äôll keep dragging you down whatever wormhole this is. Your DC‚Äôing is being a team player and the situation comes around so rarely that I doubt it would be bannable.
---
As survivor its sometimes better to be low rank. At low ranks, you can equip OoO and essentially practice being chased for the whole game.
---
At high ranks if you try doing that you might get killed fast lol
---
The game on mobile
---
its called teabagging
---
&gt; busy complaining about how op she is. Even tho she's not really.
---
Props?
---
Lol its sumerian and yea I guess she does
---
Well seeing as i followed them till they stopped and i could pull them in the dream and show them i was being friendly and just wanted blood points... I don't think that is very annoying.
---
I mean, you could just not walk into the husk...
---
I get them when I play right before bed; they usually reflect the frustrations that made me give up and go sleep.
---
Imagine your team all using self care while you're on the hook but at dream logic speeds.
---
I almost feel Freddy would have his own "Making the best out of a bad situation" tier since he actively resents having a "boss", but goes on killing anyway because it's not like he doesn't like it. Clown is 100% in heaven though.
---
More fun than the guy telling Chuck Norris and Yo Mamma jokes all night like OP.
---
Thank you for the reply.
---
And Myers is way worse for those killers that like to stay in teir one.
---
wait,I just looked it up and indeed she does speak sumerian,but ain't she babylonian?
---
[SACRIFICE IS GOING ON TONIGHT!!!](https://youtu.be/_3Vynew5mrw) 
---
Honestly this whole song is relevant to DBD and the perk makes me think of them. Just saw Iron Maiden in philly a few weeks ago and it was easily the best concert ive ever seen.
---
New killer leaked?
---
ha ha ha you're so funny and quirky bro
---
Iridescent head you mean?
---
Mhm. Clown was ranked as being decent for the longest time because no one played him and his power sounded good on paper. Then people actually played him and realize "Oh wait! He's shit!"
---
When her mother first died and she had to learn how to hunt or when she killed the German soldiers sure, but not when she was killing random people.
---
No, it‚Äôs when the amount of gens done is more than the survivors alive. For example if thier are 3 gens dorm and 2 survivors a live the hatch will appear, but if everyone is alive it will not appear until all 5 gens are done.
---
Takes time keep practicing! First game with angrypug I got looped and tbagged all game.  The last 3 games i played against him he killed himself loool.
---
God mode?
---
Gold
---
Did the doctor also tell you that you‚Äôre a healthy weight? What about your friends that only you can see and hear, but no one else can? How are they doing
---
Yeah but wait til you get spine chill 3, 1 is useless
---
Nah that's "Locked" it's a new perk with the last update that allows a killer to put a lock on a locker.
---
You're an idiot. NOBODY knew where it was until the second he jumped in.
---
Hol up
---
Against survivors who don't just dc at the mere thought of nurse, it's not that hard to juke her once you learn how ( yes I know it's hard against an extremely skilled player). And yes I see the error in my logic prior. What I mean by skill with a worse killer isn't really skill but more intelligence, as obviously your mind games must be on point to play an m1 killer, Where as your mind games can be kinda trash with nurse. Due to the fact you just need skill with her blinks and lunges.
---
You play a little too much don't you?
---
Removed we ask you take part in the community before posting videos thank you
---
Well, even you can't deny that the doctor was holding them hostage for thirty minutes, and the Nea was at fault. Even if you don't blame the doctor, which I don't see how you can defend him, the Nea should be banned for not ending the game. The Nea should have ended the game, but instead stayed around like a dumb ass.
---
That Mori tho.... So awful.
---
Hillbilly next please!
---
Ty
---
Well i live in the north so i have acces to it
---
I mean in the entity's realm you don't really die
---
I actually have my name up there. I didn‚Äôt put it up, but it‚Äôs up there. Les play the guessing game :D
---
Its pretty hard to get down on a controller but wih practise ull get it :)
---
holy fuck lol that's next level
---
If you played well and won they would instead find something to complain about. Some players just have to be an ass post game chat, no matter what.
---
I see what you mean. Well I'm not on console so yeah indeed it's a very different nurse there.
---
When you play solo it‚Äôs a real help sometimes to have a teammate running it. 
---
I never can rely on others to unhook someone, so if I‚Äôm across the map and they‚Äôre approaching tier 2 I‚Äôm not sure if I should run or not. 
---
With kindred, I can see the one guy looping somewhere while another guy goes for the safe unhook/heal. 
---
I don‚Äôt waste as much time running across the map only to see someone get unhooked. 
---
Not the best perk at all, but it‚Äôs got its situations.
---
I had this happen when playing with my friend whose new to the game. (He was rank 13 and i was rank 8 at the time) against a 3 gen doc. He sat and camped the 3 gens not chasing or even hitting a survivor only kicking the 3 gens repeatedly with overcharge. I brought my friend to the hatch and then dc‚Äôd. He sat and patrolled the 3 gens for over 10 minutes doing nothing but kicking them. Fair enough if you want to keep the last 3 gens close together but refusing to chase a survivor for over 10 minutes is pathetic
---
I find it amusing there are killers with garbage base kits who are left to rot while BHVR is going overtime on "OP" killer addons.
---
Yeah i get some games like that, i‚Äôve noticed its most of the games when someone has DS. I dont know what it is but the games without a DS in it are smooth and everyone enjoys it, killer and survivor but the games that have DS in it are terrible and only the survivors enjoy it. Just something I‚Äôve noticed, not complaining about DS, I use it myself.
---
Let‚Äôs not pretend that this sub isn‚Äôt heavily killer-sided. OP was only trying to reiterate that point and the reaction OP is receiving from you and others verifies this. Your delusional or in denial if you think it both sides are equally toxic when one side is clearly the majority. 
---
If you were intellectually honest, you‚Äôd spend more time responding to killer‚Äôs complaints on survivors.
---
The meme was good at the beginning, but it became so oversaturated with the time that it became the Ugandan Knuckles of the DBD community.
---
np &lt;3
---
My dude I struggled with anorexia....get blocked
---
Does that mean you could somehow use a key to open it before it even appears? If not that would be an interesting bug
---
I wish i could be ranked down to 18. have fun dominating my dude :P
---
Well I enjoyed our debate. Thank you for being a sensible person and not one of those toxic dudes who just throw insults and just yells and bitches all throughout the argument.
---
Ye dude as you want, I'm sure now survivors who get chased are going to say: "shit I've already looped 2 pallets, better that I stop for a moment and let the killer hit me cause I don't want to abuse pallets". 
---
Also i see that a lot of people agree with you lol (/s).
---
Btw I only said my opinion that his: the term abuse pallets and insta loop doesn't make any sense. You are taking about a legit mechanic in the game and survivors are not going to stop using pallets because you can't get your 4k every match.
---
At the moment you are the only one who can't argue with someone with a different opinion. With these comments you are just attacking me accusing me of being a salty survivor main, giving random judgements and telling me to grow up. You will not "win" a discussion throwing shit on the other person, you should probably try to explain your point of view in the future.  So you really think I'm the one who needs to grow up?
---
Anyways I will not going to give other answer anymore, my point of view is already clear enough. Bye and good gaming!
---
Ha! I was just in a match as Clown for my daily. I‚Äôm rank 17 after reset and played against 2 rank 7 Megs, a rank 11 Claudette, and a rank 9 Laurie. All had flashlights, DH, DS, BT, and Adrenaline. I still got a 3k though
---
It's cause their life outside dbd isn't very great. That, or they are just really competitive.
---
So you have 100 levels to reach prestige 3, then 60 perks for killer and 3 perks for each time to get all 180 perk tiers on the P3 bloodweb so 280 webs for all 16 killers, that brings to 4480 webs for JUST killer.
---
Same initial 100 webs for survivor to reach tier 3, 65 perks each with 3 tiers for 195 webs/survivor + the 100 initial webs = 295 webs for all 17 survivors to make 5015 webs total.
---
Combine 4480+5015= 9495 webs total. More than a little bit of a grind for people who play other things or have a busy life. They also wanna keep the game going for several more years so that number's just gonna keep getting bigger.
---
*Laughs in Guardian Powers*
---
If only I had that much art skill
---
You can‚Äôt go any further down, actually. 16-20 is the ‚Äúnew player‚Äù zone so you‚Äôve basically hit the end of the line.
---
Same for me.
---
Nah I watched the whole thing.  You straight camped two of the pallets including the early one at the house where you took the hit and then wasted your burst of speed to stay there and waste the pallet.  You cost yourself a loop at the cow tree by hesitating at the pallet waiting for him and then the last one you camped and tossed with him not even being near it to justify the throw.  I'm sorry I got nothing against people still learning how to loop but when they take to reddit super cocky about their "juke" skills there's going to be criticism.  If it was better executed I'd have said nice things lol.  Take the advice and consider it with future pallets.
---
I know
---
You can still catch them without bloodlust. I agree that some maps are still op, but for the nost part bloodlust needs to be removed completely.
---
Irritated with the way the game works? AKA you're mad you can't win every game. Also the community shouldn't affect your enjoyment. If people send you messages just I G N O R E them.
---
*Laughs in prayer beads*
---
Not bad advice for red ranks, just don‚Äôt expect to pop against that bad a killer, I‚Äôve had multiple games like this. You have to rely on the killer to actually do something which is very dumb sometimes.
---
Awesome! Ill sub back, what's yours? You can search CinderAllie Gaming. I should be the top one.
---
if he truly did the saddest part is he did that on the dead by daylight subreddit. there are plenty of other subs that he could have tried to swindle more karma
---
I did play it through, I never dc‚Äôd. What are you talking about?
---
I love the passion that you put into all of this, now I want a totem in my bedroom!
---
Ikr hahaha op is funny and quirky haha haha boomer mad cuz op is comedic genius.
---
The opposite is true too. As killer some of my most dominant wins results in "safety" pips, which is also stupid.
---
Never said they were abusing anything, and never said SWF was a bad thing. Don‚Äôt put words into people‚Äôs mouths.
---
as if i use self care when it isn't necessary and i have nobody else to heal me
---
As a killer main I‚Äôm debating. Letting the survivors in this instance go, or #PLEASING #THE #ENTITY
---
No need to sub back :) I don t post anything
---
I don't really get it. Micheal pretty much just killed. He seemed almost completly emotionless.
---
On the other hand GFs usually played with their victims more, torturing them psychologically, same with Freddy. That seems a lot more evil to me.
---
As a Ghostface main on console, it's mostly due to lack of better perks. I don't want to buy a bunch of killers and put god knows how long into all of their bloodwebs and then pray to the entity they show up in Ghostface's. So I run some decent perks that I have on hand (usually Ruin, Whispers, Sloppy) and I have NOED for the endgame. Ruin itself is not very good at slowing the game down considering it usually gets cleansed in 30 seconds, and since I don't have other good perks for slowing the game down or gen regression, I anticipate the endgame.
---
It's also important to note that Ghostface's stalking is very hit or miss. You will sometimes get potato survivors that stare at walls while doing gens or don't look around them while walking out in the open, giving you free one shots left and right. You will also run into red rank SWF groups that are always alert, call out your position to each other, grind through gens optimally as you are stuck being an M1 killer in a chase because stalking is realistically out of the question or would take more time than the chase itself. As everyone here sort of shows too, no one expects a Ghostface to run NOED, so with the speed boost you can catch a lot of people off guard and at least get a kill or two. I'm sure a lot of people will just say get good, but against a coordinated group and no good perks to help Ghostface *really* struggles
---
But the leatherface in the video dc‚Äòed. I think you didn‚Äòt watch it to the end.
---
That was kinda nice. Can‚Äôt lie
---
I just see poor excuses, that‚Äôs all.
---
Did Frank *want* to kill? I'm pretty sure the only kill they actually got was kinda on accident, as he was protecting Julie.
---
F for hillbilly
---
Us killer mains are probably fine
---
Your not supposed to shame people on this subreddit dude. =/
---
When she first came out and months afterwards people were saying the complete opposite. The general consensus was that Spirit was a higher skill ceiling but lower overall performance compared to nurse. Once you get down Nurses muscle memory you‚Äôre gonna have an easy time, spirit however can mindgame herself making each movement she makes more critical because she has to wait much longer to use her ability again compared to nurse. Nurse flat out ignores obstacles and game mechanics. Spirit has to guess at these obstacles or hope the player makes a mistake. Once the player hits the survivor once with spirit she becomes less about these guessing games and becomes a homing missile but Nurse can effectively use her power against healthy survivors easier.
---
Is there such a thing as "selfish" perks or build? Someone reviewed a recent VOD of mine and criticized that my build had no team perks (Poised, Sprint Burst, Lightweight and Spine Chill). I understand the redundancy of Poised with Lightweight but personally I think SC is a solid perk. I also love Lightweight.
---
I'm asking because I'm currently at Rank 14 trying to climb and actually improve (looping and running the killer and getting away, not getting caught and lasting only 5 mins in a trial).
---
TLDR:
---
1) Are there such things as selfish perks and builds?
---
2) How can I improve at running/looping the killer and escaping?
---
He deserves it
---
Why are you so passionate about this? Lol
---
When did I make an excuse??
---
He just said he won a game and he still thought that you absolute useless muppet of a person, even in telltale games there's an option to just stfu sometimes mate you should try it.
---
‚ÄúA friend‚Äù isn‚Äôt that you though?
---
Proof of lagswitching? How are you sure or are we sure it‚Äôs not just someone with shit internet or far out of your region.
---
Poor Piggy.
---
That‚Äôs because ghost face has to stalk enemies he gets the point for stalking and stabbing not just stabbing. His ability isn‚Äôt to instantly get a one shot kill. If he gets seen he has to stand up
---
Incorrect.
---
That's a deathgarden mask &lt;3
---
Yes its just you
---
Ah this post again
---
You sound like a toxic meme not a survivor.
---
I‚Äôm calling it it‚Äôs gonna be remake Jason
---
They are hard to use but if you get the stalk due to idiot survivor then they are screwed
---
Everywhere I go...
---
...I see this post
---
Hey, it puts in YOUR game, so wouldn't you still have YOUR save file? And if not then I'd just be Blendette and camp the hatch/let everyone else do the gens.
---
Lmao this one kills me everytime, the clueless look on Steve Carell's face is priceless
---
I didn‚Äòt use a house for the looping so it doesn‚Äòt matter if I was on Haddonfield or if not because the loop I was using were like a normal jungle gym. Besides that you‚Äòre absolutely right about Haddonfield.
---
I'm still trying to figure out why I only seem to get an itch while going a gen...
---
I do. I'm currently 850 hs in the game. But as time passes i'm taking longer breaks from the game.
---
Bahaha poor bubba wubba.
---
Should have just committed to the loop and force the pallet down and after a run around or two he‚Äôd get a hit.
---
Lol don't bm if you want a fair game.  You toxic baby survivors want it both ways.  You want to be able to disrespect the killer in every way imaginable but not have to face any consequences for said BM.  Either do it and accept the fact that you literally begged the killer to play you like a piece of shit OR grow up and don't bm and enjoy a likely fair game.  You don't get both though kid.
---
Me but it‚Äôs more of a addiction
---
Yeah, I figured I‚Äôd be downvoted to hell
---
Why did you get down voted?
---
the totems look dope everything else is no fire material brother
---
With that lawsuit? Fucking unlikely.
---
Super cocky is how you took my comment
---
Noted
---
9 months ago (probably more because i dont upload the clips the same day) i played like this. Been looked at a lot of tutorials and i dont do this anymore. So your comment is coming off as redundant.
---
In their general direction and you‚Äôll get the hit obviously
---
Red rank isnt actually as hard to get to as people think. Lots of red ranks here in america suck too. The matchmaking is via location I think so it will probably be worse killers as there are less people that play the game outside of the US and Canada.
---
Thanks, i love the metal noise when he hits the cement.
---
No worries! Thanks for your support!
---
If you balance around high ranks you shoot low ranks in the head. If you balance around low ranks the high ranks can bully like you wouldnt believe with the crutches. The game is too inconsistent to be fixed in it's current state. Honestly I haven't played more than 5 games since the last rank reset on killer side because they just straight up aren't talking about the changes they are making which are hard in favor of the survivor.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt mind this coming back. It‚Äôs annoying for killer that the one immersed Claudette is able to escape cause they did nothing but hide while their team gets demolished, and if I ever get a hatch as survivor at 5 gens, I don‚Äôt really feel like I deserved it at all. Similar to people not liking noed cause it rewards a killer for failing to defend gens, getting a hatch at 5 gens rewards for survivors for not doing any.
---
Yesss!
---
And if youre gonna go as far as to critisize an old clip, at least comment on the whole point of me showing it right? 
---
Like sheesh my guy
---
Lol thanks!
---
Thank you so much!
---
Oh good to know!
---
Yeah, that would be witch hunting
---
Fuck spelling too, apparently.......
---
Lol!
---
I feel like Nurses is kind of counter-productive, at least for the way I play. I use Surveillance to know when people are around my Gen, that lets me know they crouched over my Traps, so I can run back and either catch up to them, or force them to run away and set off my traps.
---
It‚Äôs a great meme building app, I highly suggest it
---
Is the game meant for you to be able to loop infinitely? If you look at the current BP System, survivors are awarded for ‚ÄúWinning a chase‚Äù . Which is successfully losing the killer after being found. So.. bloodlust ensures that the longer you take to lose the killer, the more chance they have to catch you. You literally said yourself they are trying to remove good loops and you are still doing them well. So have they really fixed looping? They won‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt believe it will be leaving. If you‚Äôre gonna take aggro, have an escape ready.
---
It used to, they changed it. You are right, it is stupid, and don't let people tell you it would be "too strong". It's not a strong perk at all, and there's no reason it shouldn't work on ability hits that deal damage.
---
It's even more stupid because in the scene it is derived from, it literally is the chainsaw that makes Franklin drop the flashlight.
---
Imagine those eyes staring at you. Creepy. So detailed!
---
Who the fuck are you?
---
If you need to be lucky to find the hatch means you didnt do at least 3 gens which implies you were not efficient in the game in which case why in the world do you think you deserved the victory in any way?
---
Lets say you did 3 gens then: you should know now where the hatch spawns since its really not hard to find it: killer hooks someone, you escape no luck involved
---
But for your sake lets say you didnt find the hatch by luck or skill : what do you do then?
---
When you know killer will find the hatch you camp the exit doors and open 1 to 20 percent progression so the red lamp wont appear yet, you wait for the killer to come to that door, hide and when he leaves start immediately unlocking the door
---
This will work most of the time unless you are really unlocky with the door placements which can happen - that's why every match is somewhat random, you can't be sure of anything - hex ruin users also have it bad but you wont see people complain since they learn to deal with bad object placement
---
Same applies to windows: you could have a quaranteed 3 loop on azarovs with a gen in the house - or you can have a shitty one window loop
---
I message them sometimes saying why tho and the conversation usually leads up to them saying something along the lines of ‚Äúyou just got whooped by a 14 yr old gg ez uninstall baby killer/survivor‚Äù then leads up to them spamming me gg ez
---
Looks great! I'm interested to see the hag!
---
Insert "guess I'll die" meme here.
---
Giving out the hatch is always a personal choice.  It isn't toxic to not give it out by default.  The only times I would say really dude.....is if the game starts and someone immediately quits giving you a 3 man 5 Gen game which is bullshit or if a gamebreaking glitch costs them any chance at competing such as getting trapped in a locker or something.
---
Wow very good texture on her skin; great shading on it too!
---
Paper plate.
---
Actually now that i recall i ran across a few i guess its sadder for them cause they dont have an excuse to be immature
---
I have no idea but I‚Äôm glad it helped
---
H3H3 Myers
---
It was already nerfed so I wouldn‚Äôt be overly strong it‚Äôs fine
---
No gens done should be no hatch....at least try
---
Thank you!!
---
I too had a LOT of dreama about dbd, usually I was david and woke up SO happy that I looped the killer
---
And i would mind my friend : let me tell you why
---
As a killer main i believe that i should be rewarded for my good plays but i also think that survivors shouldnt be helpless, we can already close the hatch and dominate if we know the hatch spawns locations, its a random game after all
---
The one bad thing about these people when they escape through hatch with 5 gens left is 
---
GG ez noob killer
---
Lmao. You‚Äôre kinda sad tbh
---
"Everything has a counter"...Excuse me sir but Prayer Beads would like to have a word.
---
Well I mean you were triggered about your Nazi thing with the mods and felt the need to post it
---
I was semi-OK with it when they had to do at least two gens to get it. Now you get it no matter what, it's ridiculous and it promotes survivors not doing the objective. If you dominate a team and they have two survivors left at four or five gens, they will *never* attempt to do the objective. They just hide to try and wait each other out. It's frustrating and unfair to punish a killer for playing well or reward survivors for playing poorly.
---
Most of the time you save teammates just to improve your overall survival chances. If saving teammates will leave you to die, you‚Äôre not supposed to do that (or at least it‚Äôs advertised this way by devs). There is no such thing as selfish builds if you think that your ‚Äúselfish‚Äù perks help you survive more.
---
&gt; Here‚Äôs why I hate Haddonfield
---
Nothing that happened in this clip had anything to do with Haddonfield
---
Oh the downside I could die, but on the upside I would come back with the quads of a god after all that tbagging.
---
You can go further with rank reset, you can‚Äôt with depipping.
---
you're probably right but i feel like my usual teammates have bigger issues than that lol
---
Vaulting grabs, they do have to be injured. Locker/hook/gen grabs they do not. This is for any killer.
---
Kinda sounds like the Hollowing effect in the Dark Souls series.
---
Why are people misusing the word ‚Äúboomer‚Äù all of a sudden? Lol
---
*yes perfect*
---
A guy who's fed up with morons strawmanning everyone.
---
This is what projecting looks like.
---
Is there a way to tell if they're a swf? Other than maybe checking their steam friendlists I guess.
---
Big spins
---
Id want gengar as a killer, but Wraith already is in the game
---
*sinister piano music*
---
But ask anyone who has a lot of playtime what the current balance feels like- they'll say killers are in a very good spot rn.
---
Reddit likes to regurgitate the "Survivors control the match" stuff that had been true in 2017 but since then killers have been getting buffs and survivors have been getting nerfed more and more.
---
It's not the same anymore. Nothing that made SWF busted is as bad anymore. Simple knowledge of zoning and which pallets to force drop (and from what side) will net you good results as any M1 killer- good enough to just walk away from hook straight to the furthest survivor every time and retain pressure
---
Yea, it was, but im defensive because you're just coming at me saying stuff i know about now and had nothing to say about the one clip i was trying to show
---
I understand you just wanna make me better and you didnt know it was old, but im honestly not that cocky, i just like the name tbh
---
Thanks though. Honestly. I appreciate that you wanna give tips
---
Lol if that bothers you then don‚Äôt let anyone tell you about the shit you don‚Äôt know when it comes to karma whores.
---
It's funny you say that because I noticed a very long time ago that everytime I get matched against a South American killer they facecamp with gens up.  Sample size is probably about 50 games over the years I'm an American player so not like i get paired against them often but when i do it is a constant.  Always the Brazilian profiles for me.
---
Congrats! I just need the 3 nurse trophies to platinum the game. It‚Äôs never gonna happen :‚Äô)
---
Define toxic pls
---
Sometimes I can't tell if I'm truly bad or if nurse is that much more a beast to tame when on console
---
Paper mache presumably
---
Running around a pickup on Autohaven requires a lot of skill as well, right? :) A good survivor will loop you around pickups and debris loops on Blood Lodge for ages only because he/she can see you over a loop and loops are too wide to try mindgames.
---
After the ghostface release ive learned not to expect much
---
lithe, we'll make it and spine chill and three really good perks.
---
Small game is much more niche for sure tho.
---
No screen capture to meme it. You get to live the rest of your life wondering what could have been.
---
For once a NOED idea that doesn't sound completely stupid.
---
I like your idea of just overall more speed. Allows the killer to still have a scary chance to bring the game back in his favor without it being stupidly easy to win. 
---
Kudos to you man.
---
Freddy had his power granted to him directly from a relative of the entity, or equivalent.
---
Everything about Freddy and his nightmares is the same as in the entity's trials, only Freddy is a lot better at accuracy in recreation of real world locations.
---
Same, some runes stuff.
---
I kinda agree messing with the survivors was fun and definitely felt like Freddy from the movies.
---
With that being said, the new rework made him kinda easier, but more viable. Also the fake pallets are one of the best things in this game, I mean when some kid starts teabagging and throws the fake pallet, it feels so good.
---
Nope
---
Teachables=
---
I choose you!
---
You are obsessed with one survivor, start the match with 4 tokens. Every time you hit your obsession all generators with progress will reduce 3%/5%/8% of total progress. You lose a token.
---
Hydro Pumped
---
Once 4 generators have been completed all remaining generators will be blocked for 15/20/30 seconds
---
Hex: Gotta catch em' all
---
When a survivor is hooked, all remaining survivors will suffer from exposed status effect for 30/40/60 seconds.
---
gotta get that 4% boost
---
Just a thank you
---
thank you man
---
Still the best perk icons &lt;3
---
I mean, some people aren‚Äôt going to watch every stream. 
---
In the in-game lore, it‚Äôs implied that the Doc enjoyed human experimentation to such a degree that self mutilation doesn‚Äôt seem far off. Always felt like the Entity enabled shock-doc to continue his ‚Äútesting‚Äù rather than force him.
---

---
Ive had so many night terrors after playing for hours.. My wife says she just lets me yell sometimes because I freak out so hard. Love DbD ha
---
Because you‚Äôre using the most unfun build to go against versus noob survivors. What do you expect
---
I highly doubt dedicated servers will bring people back after 3 years lmfao. 3 fucking years, this game is over with, won‚Äôt be surprised if the servers are delayed again. Shit, F13 brought out dedicated servers a few months after release but the game was already dead. Dedicated servers is not about to boost this game like you think it will lol
---
Yea
---
made with mematic
---
Oh. I always thought the perk was named after the band but I‚Äôm just now noticing that‚Äôs an actual Iron Maiden torture device which makes sense with what the perk does... duh
---
Don't do this to me, now I'll always see that.
---
He would‚Äôve been the only survivor deserving of their fate.
---
Makes sense, but I guess the survivor‚Äôs have to be redeemable. Except Nea, who‚Äôs totally the Entity.
---
Ez job for a killer main. Can't die, and I get to bring back all of those... er, blood tokens?
---
I was only pretending to be retarded.
---
Yes Bc everyone wants to stay in a game where they get farmed off hooks, tunneled by the killer. Being a solo player sucks and there is no teamwork unless ur in swf. dedicated servers might help the dc‚Äôs but as for dying on first hook, not likely.
---
It‚Äôs being toxic
---
they scream so her vomit actually goes in mouth
---
A few of LeatherFace‚Äôs add-ons allude to his fear of the Entity, beast marks? mentions something along those lines.
---
It would be either the Demogorgon, or Billy as the mind flayer host most likely.
---
Of course bro doing totems is toxic, so is checking for ruin. Swf scum 
---
Damm. I'm survivor main and I hate people going to cleanse Totems (not hexes). But to downvote that? That is a hole next level.
---
Looks Awesome!!  :)

Haha yeah I realized I had them off, but wanted to see what people had to say. I mostly played csgo, but haven‚Äôt since I‚Äôve gotten into DbD. All of my games have been either people being super nice, to counter the toxicity I assume, or just calling me mean words over and over, and I have to hit them with the ‚ÄúSorry you‚Äôre mad!‚Äù
---
Nice man!
---
I use reddit. I am fully aware.
---
So you're saying I should play Undertale?

No. Nea is the Entity in Killer form in Survivor form. :&gt;

It's cool no problem man.  Definitely wasn't trying to come at you or make it a personal thing.  Best of luck in the fog and may your teamates not be potatoes.
---
~~Just cleanse totems~~
---
Just pressure gens 
---
FTFY
---
I can‚Äôt answer everything but I‚Äôm going to respond to some of these. 
---
- To find totems, learn their spawns (it just takes time) and use Small Game (I think that‚Äôs the perk that gives you an audio cue when you‚Äôre looking at a trap or totem). 
---
- Don‚Äôt was the time searching for Ruin and don‚Äôt waste time gen tapping. The fastest way to work through Ruin is to just work through it, even if you can‚Äôt hit greats. 
---
- Nurse‚Äôs Calling, Enduring, and Ruin are good perks to grind for. 
---
- Flashlights just take time and practice. You have to angle your camera upwards for it to hit the Killers face and adjust for the distance between you and the Killer. Timing is just as important - if you flashlight too early, they will blind but won‚Äôt drop the survivor. If you flashlight too late, they‚Äôll turn. You have to hit them right square in the face just as they hoist the survivor onto their shoulder. 
---
- Looping just takes practice. Watch some skilled streamers, use fake outs and mind games when possible, don‚Äôt be afraid to tank a hit and try to use pallets efficiently. 
---
- Don‚Äôt attempt to escape, you only have a 2% base chance. If you‚Äôve noticed multiple luck offerings were burned, you can try but it‚Äôs still a very low chance. The only time I try to unhook myself is if I have nothing else to lose and think I‚Äôll die anyway. Sometimes it pops off, but again, 2%. 
---
- Use Ruin to slow gen progression. Use Billy or Nurse or even Spirit for the most pressure. Go for downs and hooks, not just hits (unless your build benefits from it).
---
Keep in mind. The entity likes torture and he can watch them and gain power from it. But remember, micheal, dear god, run for your life.
---
Spirit is no mindgame. If you're injured without iron will you're literally fucked. Also if the Killer wears headphones you're fucked.
---
Spirit by design is Bad for the game. Her wooshing Sound is sometimes bugged making it frustrating for survivors to verse.
---
Nurse in the right hands is outright broken. But in the average Hand shes okayish. Ive had nurses that chase people for Minutes and nurses that ende games in 20s. Its a coin toss
---
Wtf people are asking for gold and you guys want downvotes
---
" YOU LIKE?!!!"
---
Thank you for agreeing
---
I think the entity doesn't dare to mess with Michael, that's why he is the only one that can Just decide to kill the survivors without an offering
---
And Evan doesn't take pleasure on killing, no one knows why he killed the people on the tunnel.
---
And the Devs comfirmed that he was the one that resisted the most  against the entity(that's why he has hooks and other stuff on him) so i think you could say that he is insane now.
---
Because Nea
---
sickness for the thiccness
---
My point is that you rarely see the perks I run (except spine chill) while the ones I listed are usually 2 or 3 per game. Not saying I'm some Messiah of underdog perks just saying the Meta is the Meta and no one cares to vary it very much.
---
Maybe
---
When you return to the real world, you find out you have a terminal illness, but whenever you die you just come back. You're forced to spend all of eternity in constant pain, never able to be rid of it.
---
Where you playing from?
---
Wholesome &lt;3 its just a survivors way of saying thank you
---
She had the third seal?
---
I'd say his ability to waste time is second to the fact that his Killer Instinct shows you where survivors are, which is pretty powerful by itself. If you can hit someone and then chase them normally, you can get a fairly easy hook most times, unless they're saintly at looping.  
---
I might just have bias since I've always been a fan of Legion since their launch, but I think they're better than most people say.
---
Throw the hachet already!
---
Laughs in German, excellent.
---
Da war jemand ein miese Peter XD
---
Is laughing at garbage maps and terrible hex totem spawns considered making excuses? Because I‚Äôll laugh at maps with 3 infinite loops or a ruin that gets cleansed in 20 seconds in the post game every time it happens.
---
I love how my pun got downvoted and yours didn‚Äôt
---
God I hate the new Adept killer requirements. Just got a 4k with only 2 gens getting done and I only get Ruthless (one square away). Like fuck me short of a full baby team doing no gens I don't get what the fuck I'm supposed to do. Any tips?
---
OP making this post as seen above
---
You must have really bad luck, I'm on Xbox and unless I'm in the basement people get around to me eventually.  Dying immediately on the hook doesn't waste any if the killers time, which I don't like one little biiiiiit
---
1k for cleansing one.
---
Tired of the game? I hope you are at least enjoying it a bit
---
Thats me
---
Someone asked her that in a q n a. She is aware.
---
Ive done it on a controller before but only a couple of times. I pretty much just very quickly moved both of the sticks and hoped it would work.
---
This trophy was a real pain to get, congratulations on getting it :)
---
Looks really cool!
---
I have Dead by Daylight dreams all the time.
---
If anything I'd say Decisive Strike is the survivor equivalent of NOED.
---
Protect baby dweets at all costs
---
Ok. I‚Äôm happy you posted this. Literally every time I start this game up it‚Äôs like a fucking plane engine.
---
Happens to both me and my wife on our PS4s!
---
I'd just rather have someone escape super quickly if they get demolished rather than to just sit there trying to find this immersed Claudette for 30 minutes. She's not gonna pip from it, it's just an escape. Who cares?
---
Considering BHVR has envisioned that their goal for the game is 2 live/ 2 die then it really is survivor's version of NOED. Yet so many people act like they have to work hard to get to use it. 
---
If an average game is meant to have the gates open at some point, your Adrenaline activating isn't some big pro-gamer move you pulled off. Still, here we are with another shitpost shaming NOED/ praising Adrenaline.
---
I don't know why Amanda is always in the top two, but I'm not complaining
---
&gt; who has a lot of playtime what the current balance feels like
---
I'll indulge you, briefly.
---
I've been here since launch. Killers are in a better spot than they ever were at the beginning, but that doesn't mean they're in a "good" place. Generators are entirely too fast, loop tiles are entirely too strong, and SWF still retains an impossible-to-balance level of power. If you're playing at rank 1 against optimal survivors, God help you. Ruin, if not found in the first 30 seconds, is almost completely worthless because the players are good enough to hit the skill checks, and if you aren't playing Nurse, have fun getting dicked at the abundance of safe tiles or jungle gyms.
---
&gt; Survivors control the match
---
Except they do. Despite balance changes in recent history, it's still the survivors' game to lose. As a killer, you're reliant on a survivor making a mistake, so your entire plan is to try forcing one, or waiting for one to happen. This might sound "balanced" or "skillful", but you'd be incorrect, or just have really shitty perspective. 
---
Think of the theme of this game. You're a bloodthirsty killer tasked with the hunting and sacrificing of 4 survivors. How emasculated must you be to have your power in a match dependent on someone else fucking up? Killer is supposed to be the power role, able to impose its will on its victims who desperately struggle to escape and survive. In current fashion, survivors are, and have always been, the power role, able to dictate the entire pace of a match by the use of a handful of brain cells. The killer struggles desperately to land M1 hits through windows or pallets while having to execute multiple guessing games to force an error. I have no problem with having to work harder as the killer because, after all, it's an asymmetrical game; however, the amount of effort required is so disproportionate it's laughable. Some tiles you have to merely stand in a single spot, wait for the glow, and run the opposite direction. Others, you can see directly through, and you know the killer has no choice but to run through it enough times to force you to throw the pallet down, allowing you to get enough space to find another strong tile in the time it takes him to break the pallet.
---
&gt; Nothing that made SWF busted is as bad anymore
---
I've suspected you of being intentionally obtuse and outright dishonest this entire time, but this really takes it. SWF has always exacerbated the amount of issues killers have against survivors. Being able to have a pinpointed location of the killer at nearly every second of the match, coordinating generator times, keeping track of pallets still available, outfitting synergistic items, addons, perks, and offerings. I don't know what kind of bullshit you're trying to pull here, but it certainly isn't going to fool me.
---
Now, that's the end of it for me. I gave you 7 whole minutes to write that while I wait in queue. I have absolutely no doubt that you'll do precisely what I said you'd do before with hyperbolic anecdotes and lame deflections. From here out, further discussion is pointless, as your entire objective is to intentionally misrepresent and outright lie.
---
But if newer players don't have to grind like I did, who the fuck am I gonna feel superior to for having more time!?
---
*Looooot* of dipshits think they're skilled for having more time to dick around and hate the idea of new players not having to "suffer" like they did.
---
Found the guy who hugs the husks.
---
Bold assumption. I‚Äôd imagine you brought in the game offering as well, just to make the game all that much less fun from them. No they didn‚Äôt  know your build, but they realized it the moment when they started screaming. Not saying you should DC ever, like you said, against a weak killer but it‚Äôs rank reset and your complaining bc they DC‚Äôd against what is literally the most unenjoyable build for that map. But I guess people get salty when their unnecessarily sweaty build backfires on them during rank reset.
---
You both are dumb as fuck.
---
*old decisive
---
These are awesome
---
I agree with you there, maybe I misinterpreted your last comment? Where I‚Äôm aiming at is all the negativity in the community. I just happened to pick at people making excuses when they lose. It‚Äôs either a ‚Äúlag switch‚Äù, tunneling, camping, toxic survivors,etc. I wish the people in this community could take an ass whooping like a man üòÇ (okay I know I said man, don‚Äôt get all SJW on me now lmao)
---
The Spies from the Shadows icon always throws me. Even though it is clearly a crow, I always see a bell at first. I have no idea why. It drives me crazy.
---
Host Billy could actually be an interesting killer, possibly with powers relating to sabotaging of the gens, or something screwy with the basement.
---
The site isn't working for me. Down already?
---
But we're supposed to pretend that Rank 20 and Rank 1 opinions are *exactly* the same because people get butthurt when you tell them that they don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

360s just look so stupid. The idea of spinning like a helicopter to avoid a killer that‚Äôs meant to be scary.
---
Bubba's waddle kills me.

Oh my god. You ruined a good comic.

That's actually brilliant.  I love it! Thanks for the idea!
---
Gee, who does this sound like

Not Otz recommends using whispers+monitor.
---
Basically whispers lets you know when to crouch and monitor lets you do it without triggering a terror radius notification
---
Give credit, please.
---
I told my friend this the other day and he said he would never unsee it
---
I get it!
---
Michael is like a force of nature. He has no higher plan, no great motive, he just kills. Whatever drives Michael is beyond what any man, god, or entity can understand. Sure Michael abides by the rules and sacrifices for the Entity just like everyone else, but like Baker said, "He does not strike me as someone who even went unwillingly to this place."
---
I know I'm getting into personal thoughts now but I like imagining that the Entity dragged in Laurie Strode, and a while later Michael just appeared. Staring. Unmoving. And the Entity just started throwing him into rituals because it was too scared to kick him out
---
I know who I‚Äôll be maining
---
A band of criminals making their own masks out of paper mache would be a pretty funny scenario, you‚Äôve gotta admit. That‚Äôs probably what I‚Äôll go for if nothing else, though.
---
Can confirm, my PS4 tries to take off aswell.
---
Ayyy, I got that same texture but on lockers, lmao
---
I wasn't sure if Ft13 solo mode worked with the trophies, plus, I really got the idea in my head of earning the right to play as Jason, but I should check that out as I could definitely use the experience.
---
Underrated reply
---
New dream state mode for Freddy?
---
Or BHVR should fix the targeting or field of vision on killer,  you obviously would still be able to see someone turn around in front of you irl and DBD soent allow for it, you have to play looking down quite a bit in a chase
---
I think the only reason why NOED is so hated is cause of how you get it but you cant really balance NOED withought balancing Adrenaline. They're both the most powerful perks in the game except one gives you something for doing something and the other gives you something for doing nothing.
---
Yea but it works and its easy counterable so why not use it. :)
---
these memes based on stereotypes are so unoriginal that it's not even funny anymore + you're mistaken her here with Meg
---
Haha, yeah, I attempted it a few times, but honestly, it's just turning around and running into the Killer for the most part on controller. üòÇ
---
I imagine, what with the dedicated servers coming, Chapter 13 won't release until the 17th of September. This is also almost exactly 1 year since the release or Chapter 9: Shattered Bloodline.

If I'm right, the PTB won't be until the 3rd of September.

What headphones did you use?

I'm not alone!!!! ....but now I want to know why...
---
Ruin (since your power is down at the start of a match), Pop Goes the Weasel, Thrilling Tremors and either Surveillance or Haunted Grounds.
---
Did you try clicking her shirt options in the cosmetic store for her? It's not a packaged item, just a top piece.
---
Ok
---
When do you die with a RBT on when leaving the trial and when do you not?
---
How the hell did he stay so calm afterwords... probably has iron will
---
Yeah but then they're on the other side of the map and you waste time looking for them.
---
I personally don't hide from BBQ a lot. If I'm having a difficult game, then yes, but most of the time I get behind the generator aura and call it a day.
---
I've seen a lot of posts saying "Iron Maiden + BBQ is good combo?" No, it's not. You're spending 2 perk slots for just a single effect. You *have* to bring Ruin or the gens will all be done really quick, and even though Infectious Fright is a good perk, you'll have no chase potential besides a slightly faster vaulting speed in Tier 3.
---
The real combo with Rabbit is Monitor, but then you'll have a smaller Terror Radius, which conflicts with Infectious Fright

Move speed during chainsaw
---
I'm batman
---
Yes, its a fun and powerful perk. Its not as versatile as Adrenaline, but its last longer and doesnt cause Exhaustion. They are very powerful together, you get a dependable chase escape once per game.
---
A quick note about endgame perks, because i feel they are misunderstood by a lot of players: until the doors are open, the goal of a survivor in a chase is to extend as long as possible. Once the doors are open your objective changes to escaping. Thats where Hope comes in. 
---
Adrenaline is obviously great when you are in a chase. But in the scenario where you are the one who powers the last gen and you're already full health, you run to a door... And the killer shows up. Now you're exhausted and as god tier as it is, Adrenaline just fucked you. With Hope, you dont have to worry about that. 
---
I find i prefer Hope when i run Dead Hard and Iron Will, and Adrenaline if I run Balanced Landing.

LMFAO!
---
Maybe have it make all the Killers clean like feral legion just a quick wipe while they move and a smaller speed buff then the current 4% (I think?)
---
lazy titles should be banned
---
A terror radius that propogates like Line of Sight or sound rather than just a set radius. So if you are around the corner his TR goes away but it's normal if you're just on an open field.
---
Honestly I feel like he just needs a rework. Buff him all you want his ability to down multiple survivors with his chainsaw only ever comes into play when he‚Äôs camping a hook. I‚Äôm not sure what to do for a chainsaw related attack but as is his kit just encourages camping.
---
He just wants a friend :(

*meg
---
So, I'm using small game, the time that I usually take cleansing totems is enough to make 2 generators, by now, every match (10 in total) it always take 1 generator to win, this generator should be one that I had to do, but I had to check 100% of the map because a single totem means a lost, yeah, doing bones isn't that rewarding
---
So it's not a hotdog?
---
Oh yeah. She‚Äôs a hard Adept to get because your power actively hinders your malicious emblem. I would suggest focusing on vomiting on random objects as well as the players too. Her Deviousness score really hurts when smart survivors don‚Äôt cleanse. What you could do is run Iridescent Seal with the Activation Tablet but vomit on everything. You‚Äôd be playing against newer players still but what you can do is scare them into healing so you can drink the corruption, have it tick down fast but still pressure people by downing them in chases, then waiting on your puke to turn green again and like on them still. 
---
Also slug people when you‚Äôre done with your first kill.
---
You know what this reminds me of??
---
HAIL SITHIS!
---
Yes but it‚Äôs a hex perk. Not only is it a perk that allows you to one shot but also your not on control of it it gets cleaned or not the survivors are.

i wish nurse was that trash on pc, fucking hate dealing with her
---
Or run small game
---
So you're telling me you're more in control of preventing any of four survivors from revealing you as a stealthing Ghost Face than you are protecting a totem that may be hidden of its own accord anyway?
---
You're a hypocrite. I have you feasible counter-play comparisons for both sides, and you've failed to give a viable reason as to why there should be a disparity in points between the two instances.
---
Thanks! Lol! I hope to get many more in the future!
---
If everyone did totems as they saw them all would be cleansed most of the time. If you see noed at the end just check for the more obscure spots.
---
Regardless its a non-issue. NOED is prevented by doing totems. Adrenaline can't be stopped.
---
A sacrifice
---
Saaaaame fam
---
Just do the totems as you see them. Most of you play swf so just coordinate with your buddies to know how many have been broken.
---
It's really not that hard.

It's Adiris

Even easier

Please dont do this
---
You can use it aggressively actually. If you want to you can try to distract the killer then get knocked down on purpose use DS then run away you really should do this to waste time for the killer and let other survivors escape.
---
aw all the killer mains are upset :')
---
I think you need to calm down mate this is just a video game if you want to have a civil discussion go ahead just go blow off some steam first.
---
I'm a rank 1 survivor but a rank 4 killer. you could call me a survivor main.
---
Why were they standing still?
---
well, doesnt "play how you want" mean I can do what I want?
---
no you're not, you were on my team and you were trash yellow rank as survivor. then I faced you on your purple killer as trapper and you were terrible
---
As long as they say gg wp at the end game chat I don‚Äôt care how they play might annoy me but I‚Äôm not gonna tell people they can‚Äôt be sfw or use toolboxes
---
Not at all it wouldn‚Äôt be close to OP both leather Face and Franklins demise are low tier

Hey i need you! For barbeque and chili!!

Shes low mid tier

God I want her to sit on my face I mean I really like Jane

Um no killers are already overpowered spine chill just gives survivor more time to set up a defense plan which is fair
---
Damn! You can even see the frustration on his/her face.
---
I'm rank 11, I don't remember what everyone else was
---
He‚Äôs mid tier but needs some buffs to his shock, baseline illusionary pallets, and a new UR add-on.  The devs are supposed to be updating his add-ons in a future update and will probably buff his base kit while they‚Äôre at it.
---
Character that was only in the cinematic trailer for Ghostface, instantly became a meme and wanted Survivor in the community.
---
ahhhh &lt;333
---
Other survivors get so butthurt when you leave without killing yourself to unhook them in the face of overwhelming odds.
---
I'm not too worried about console playing with pc players on this game. An fps game like Fortnite? Sure, that's messed up. But dbd? It'll be fine. There are killers that are just inherently harder on console aka nurse. Console killers may be easier to 360 but that's really the only argument and even considering that we aren't talking huge game breaking balance issues. I have no doubt killers will still reach rank 1 on console even when going against pc survivor's.
---
its not necessarily something for nothing, but it does heavily rewards the killers who dont pressure generators enough. the other problems are that it promotes bad habits from killers who dont know any better. I.E. committing to chases that last too long, camping etc. when killers who do this don't use noed they lose games. so can we really blame killers for using it? i do think survivors should cleanse totems as much as they can especially now that its 1k-1.5k bp. but as solo survivor spending too much time on totems when you should be doing gens could cost you the game. i just cleanse any totems i see and pray others are doing the same.
---
And thats why I hate having a Bubba game even if he is the worst killer. If he finds you and you go down you aren't getting off that hook.
---
Congrats!!!!!
---
\*E X P O S E D\*
---
yea boi
---
Can confirm and it‚Äôs not just dbd for me
---
"hello fuccboi" \*THE SOUNDS OF CRASHING AND DEATH\*
---
Not sure why it happens but ive found that if i go straight off the map ill respawn in the middle. If i escape again it lets me actually escape.
---
At this point, it's not in the roadmap for the game, which has been outlined for the next year.
---
TORCHES BLAZED AND SACRED CHANTS WERE PHRASED AS THEY START TO CRY, HANDS HELD TO THE SKYYYYYY
---
Oh okay brilliant thanksüòÇ
---
No
---
Damn, Nea gained about 30lbs.......
---
Has not happened to me but it happened to a guy in my game while I was killer. For a sec I thought he was just taunting me at the gate till he mentioned what happened in chat.
---
Some games you do especially when you have to constantly loop the killer
---
Leave spine chill alone.
---
It's there.
---
As a killer main, I feel bad seeing a survivor DC, cuz all their buddies are now fucked... but it's a lot like stale theater popcorn; yeah, it tastes like shit... but it's right there, its salty, and provides something to do...
---
Generally, if I'm in a good mood and the survivors are having it I try to see if we can farm . Survivors generally dont like to farm though, unless there are two left and three genes done.
---
im gonna say it
---
P H A N T A S M
---
They didn't manage a single gen on the best survivor map in the game. Better player won I guess.
---
I would want to see a sort of aliens chapter, with ripely and the xenomorph. Very low chance tho
---
Just read the other comments
---
r/emojipolice
---
At least people get bloodpoints when a survivor DCs, no bloodpoints for anyone when a killer DCs
---
Dc's are worse when survivors do it. You have to keep playing.
---
I just think, an insta heal and sprint burst at ONE point of the entire game, if it even gets to be used, isnt going to make or break your game. Killers hate having to actually work around survivor perks. I play w and w/o adrenaline and it DEFINITELY does not carry me to victory. What is the issue? That I dont have to take an extra 45 seconds to heal? I could also easily not heal and play immersed, I could also run iron will or deadhard to save me that time. What exactly is it that makes adrenaline too strong and a free escape?
---
When you approach the gen just strafe towards it while facing at an angle away, ez counter.
---
I mean, everything can be an excuse if you just stop giving a shit about anyone else.
---
killer DCs are the worst because you can depip because of it
---
thank you!
---
I thought Legion was going to be the mimic killer based on the survivor trusting him in the video. That would have been dope!
---
Noob3 would love this
---
IMO a survivor who runs Spine Chill and relies on it will have their game sense and skill capped. Rather than reading the map, interpreting movements, manipulating the camera etc. They just look at the bottom corner of their screen. I never see this perk in red ranks and I play both killer and survivor at that level. It‚Äôs a perk I always tell newer players to ditch. You already get a warning a killer is approaching via the terror radius. If they are stealth you only need to look around, know your escape routes etc.
---
I think spine chill is perfectly fine  because it's really only there to give information if  the killer is close by and looking at you(or in spirits case phasewalking)   also it helps with saves to see if the killers coming back. Besides those points it doesn't really do anything and this is coming from someone that plays a  stealth killer(Ghostface)
---
Spine Chill often gets a bad rap from good players because of the immersed Blendette's that use it to hide all game. 
---
It's actually quite helpful for the action speed bonus that affects your vaulting speed. You can extend a lot of chases with your faster vaulting and it gets quite nasty for the killer to be chasing you on some maps. It also helps against Spirit players and lets you autopilot on gens easier so you don't need to pay as much attention to the game when you don't need to.
---
Then it is your team problem not a perk.
---
What about Freddy and his invisibility when survivors are awake? He's a stealth killer too.
---

What if, it wasn't very funny to begin with?   
---
Let alone the millionth time after.

i thought they scrapped that idea?
---
The hook looks incredible! Is that a hatchet stuck on the side?
---
It's Unreal engine's texture for missing textures
---
I don‚Äôt play killer. Got R5 on Survivor and R18 on Killer.
---
I love Doctors but hate his kit so i won‚Äôt play him.
---
The entity's getting a bit lazy
---
Hmmmm no
---
Or, how about when killer is just chasing survivor main streamer and streamer starts crying about killer tunneling him after 10 seconds chase. Then when he/she gets hooked, it's camping just because killer didn't go on the other side of the map. I've seen this way too many times even by high ranked survivors.
---
Sad truth is, people payed money for the game and can play it however they want. It's not other people's jobs to make sure that others have fun, their only job is to have fun themselves. And even if it was, we can't force them to play the way we like
---
Good luck trying to pip with -75% on Benevolence...
---
The grunts of pain. Yes.
---
Every single time I remember or read the story about this damn lawsuit I get so angry. Jason was just a fucking plot device for the sequel for that dude, he never attempted to flesh out the character past the ending of the first movie, who the fuck does he think he is taking any ownership of him?
---
... nice...
---
Also taking all the money out of the bank in Monopoly is actually cheating. Tunneling, camping and tea-bagging are not cheating.
---
Also for context of bottom right, the whole team was dressed the same.
---
Not true. The mind flayer created that creature to specifically kill 11. It was designed to. The mind flayer is still in the upside down.
---
As spirit just don't look at the spot you plan on going. I do it all the time. Getting that grab is almost easier since they won't move at all the first time as they are depending on their spine chill. On other killers just run whispers. Works just as well as you know there is still someone in the nearby area.
---
That isn't anyone's problem but yours. NOED allows you do instantly down survivors and it gives you a permanent increase in movement speed.
---
How are you watching 4 survivors benefit from adrenaline? If you're running a slugger build that's your problem.
---
I already made a meme like this a month ago
---
Killer rank: 21
---
Just rewatched Texas Chainsaw Massacre from 2003 few days ago and Bubba seriously needs some buffs or rework. Such an iconic character and people are buying his DLC only for BBQ perk FeelsBadMan
---
Why don't survivors who get injured while going in a locker, come out of the locker with a different animation more showing the fact that they are injured? Seems like such an obvious thing to fix, even if they do look funny while doing it...
---
Sounds like a bad killer that is just tunneling. .
---
This happens to often but at least they have done a pretty good job so far
---
What? Dedicated servers are already in the game

Your [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cpvst6/whenever_i_see_the_perk_iron_maiden/ewszhqd/?context=3) to /r/deadbydaylight for the following reason;
---
The number of survivors running it shouldn't matter since you shouldn't be getting hit by it in the first place.
---
I know there are those situations where you *have* to go after the guy you just hooked, but those are few and far between. Just slug them and start chasing someone else.
---
Must protect the baby dweet
---
I mean you post what you want man I'm glad your having just ignore me
---
You know, i think i've been watching too much noob3 when i could literally hear [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4nMp90MYQ) in my head
---
From the sounds of it, either way your Shrine is going to be Ruined :P
---
How is it unrealistic?  
---
Four survivors, four different generators, 80 seconds each.
---
NOED exists because the two minutes of EGC last *longer* than it takes four solos without toolboxes to split up and pop all five generators, and when you keep that state of the game in mind, how can you justify not popping a single generator?
---
You can team up and pop one with three or four people before the Killer even finishes a patrol (28-33 seconds), let alone a chase.
---
No, if the survivors haven't gotten a single generator done before the hatch opens, their aura should be permanently revealed to the Killer or something.
---
Better be some good perks on the shrine this week because i personally don't want to level Meg for adrenaline or new for urban evasion, I refuse to dump bp in survivors (or killers) I will never use
---
He really wanted that toolbox back lmao
---
I‚Äôm a 40/60 on Surv/Kill. Got R3/R4 before reset.
---
I kid you not, I had that exact same situation happen to me the other day. If I wasn't the obsession, I would have gone back, as the killer had a mori and had NOED but I wasn't hooked at all that trial. My buddy also left because he was able to be moried. as a result, a Meg was moried right in front of Claudette on hook, and they both died.
---
"This is the worst shrine ever." - Everyone after every shrine reset that doesn't have Ruin
---
Actually, it all depends on how the Killer DCs.
---
If they Leave Game through the menu, Survivors get to keep their blood points and I believe they get Survived BP as well. If a Killer just pulls the plug off the internet, then it's a disconnect and no one gets anything.
---
&gt;Just juggle first then hook em
---
What? Juggling doesn't work anymore AFAIK.
---
Every time i have been DS'd it's by the last survivor who just got unhooked after i've downed the person who unhooked them. I'm just really goddamn tired of losing games because some guy happened to have gotten hooked anywhere on the map, messing up, then getting a get out of jail free card on the easiest check you can get without self care, a generator, or add-ons.
---
I knew exactly what to expect with that link
---
Clicked to verify
---
I was right
---
Maybe I have been too
---
Well I asked about what people think so I don't think you're being rude at all. I was just wondering if there was a way to make iron maiden work in a non huntress-build. Thanks for your honest opinion. Have a nice day :)
---
Depends on if it's Michael, Huntress, or Plague.
---
I'd add Ghostface to the staring contest but he kind of blows  at them...
---
Trapper was forced to by his father, that's why he killed him. You can tell how forcefully the Entity tortured the killer by their physical deformities and supernatural elements. Trapper is mutilated, Wraith and Hag are basically inhuman, and Nurse and Spirit are basically living ghosts. The Doctor is deformed in several ways, his skin turned blue and his face wickedly pulled open, but his lore is 100% in support of him killing for pure enjoyment. Legion is also tricky because they are a pack, but in the lore even Frank wasn't too hot on murder, because he only killed the janitor to save Julie, he forced the rest of the group to stab him in order to make himself feel less complicit. Hillbilly and Huntress are essentially adult toddlers, killing and inflicting pain because it is all they ever knew (hunting to survive, being tortured by family). Based upon the era from which Plague hails, she isn't insane for sacrificing to a god, this was common in Babylon even though the "god" is the Entity.
---
I‚Äôm doing my best here, gimme a break
---
I'm sorry not to be rude but I do not believe your story, best of luck figuring out what you need to though
---
Ruin hasn't been on shrine for like 23 shrines, and only has been on shrine once this year. With an average of 5 shrines a year, ruin better be on this one or the next 3 &gt;:(
---
Urban Evasion
---
Good perks
---
Pick one
---
I had a Ruin+NOED Leatherface who facecamped with a bunch of over-altruistic survivors, still managed to get the last generator done, but went back for someone at the end instead of a gate. Died myself, meh.
---
NOED doesn't frustrate me, I consider it necessary considering the ease and speed with which generators are repaired and the difficulty in meaningful pressure on the entire survivor team at once.
---
But it does result in some toxic cheese sometimes.
---
Blendettes are pure evil
---
It's not an essay it's a thread on Reddit chill out GF main, Ghost face is garbage compared to killers who can just run certain addons and instadown, not to mention perks that allow you to do it and the fact that those killers can actually apply pressure, being able to 1 hit down a single survivor while crouch walking slower than the Pig to make sure your stealth isn't wasted and you have to wait another 30 seconds before you can do anything useful in the match, I'm a Spirit main, I can get insta downs all the time if I just predict survivor movements with her phasewalk, nurse can ignore almost everything and end chases immediately if you know how to predict and blink, Ghostface's power is just a REALLY shitty NOED that can only work on a SINGLE survivor for a short amount of time every 30 seconds, if he doesn't get caught stalking, which at high ranks happens all the time because no one is stupid and unaware past rank 10, he has nothing for him, you can see him easily spot because of his white mask and he still has awful audio ques, not to mention his base perks are complete garbage, especially the meme ass perk, Furtive Chase, who cares about terror radius in chases? Especially considereding that at high ranks almost every lobby is a 4 man so if you try and counter argue, "Well it could bait other survivors to you in a chase" that shit won't fly because the one getting chased is going to be calling out and keeping track of the killer.
---
:D congrats!
---
Console?
---
Well sheeeeit I didn‚Äôt know this was a common occurrence, it was my first time seeing it. It blew my mind that I was able to see the killers name.
---
That was a really cool thing to do!!!
---
nah man you good i troll people on twitter too much to say anything its all fun and games
---
Ghostfaces probably considering it's a reference to scream(even though he isn't from the movie) it's just satisfying to see him wipe the blood off with his other hand.
---
There's a difference between being diverse and literal griefing.
---
How many of you are working at the entity's?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs probably the worst part. Most times it results in me having to restart the game. Did this happen to you?
---
Correct, _dribbling_ was removed with the Decisive Strike rework. But you can still hook someone if they're downed right in front of a hook if you mash the button fast enough.
---
That is information i‚Äôm not allowed to disclose to the public
---
Yeah XBox
---
Well good perks because that benefits everyone and not just stealthy players like me
---
watch it be bond again
---
Try Microsoft paint a lot of people use it to make memes
---
this one hurts tbh
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll try it out
---
Spirit is a close second then further followed by Billy. Below them is probably Hag then Huntress. I'm not saying that Billy, Hag and Huntress are Nurse and Spirit level, but just what the top 6 currently are.
---
No problem
---
Hey what do you know, I made it today
---
Look pal, if you think Freddy players putting down a bloody trap on a gate switch is uncounterable, that's a you problem. Literally no one agrees with you, as evidenced by the downvotes on *you* and not on me, so just accept that you are the minority in this situation, ok? 
---
Besides, it's not my problem if you always face the killers who sit at the one gate you happen to be crouching next to and never leave. If the killer won't leave a gate alone, go for the other one. And if the killer is actually trying, and checking both gates, wait for them to leave before opening a gate. Starting one up immediately like they aren't gonna be on their way soon is your fault, no one elses. 
---
Also, *learn to fucking socialize.* No one over the age of 15 thinks you're cool when you use swearing as a defense mechanism for being an idiot, ok? Real life doesn't operate like a schoolyard fight so leave that attitude at the door.

Pretty sure they changed that with last patch. I know what you are talking about, a killer did to me many times.

I don't dc I just tell them not to come from me if the killer is slugging me to get the 4k.

Okay that's pretty rough, but the muscles responsible for breathing - and incidentally for moving your eyes up/down - are not subject to sleep paralysis so that's pretty odd.

SAME. The one good anti-tunnel perk... thjat's on a premium character... please...
---
Excuse you for being wrong and regarding up/down votes as the correct answer lol what a fucking dipshit you are. Didn‚Äôt bother reading too much of that though
---
The map introduced with the Plague features a guarenteed chest locked within the temple, requiring the nearby generator to open a gate and allow access to it.
---
Several maps also open pathways or shortcuts upon specific generator completion.
---
I would say it‚Äôs something like, but subject to opinion in the middle:
---
Nurse
---
Spirit/Billy
---
Huntress/Hag
---
Myers/Freddy
---
Ghostface/Plague/Pig
---
Clown/Legion/Trapper
---
Leatherface/Doctor/Wraith
---
A snowballed Hag is as scary as a Nurse IMO. A skilled huntress can probably push Billy out of the top 3 especially if the map is favourable. 
---
Etc.
---
Well i assume there are alot, so tell your coworkers to work harder, cuz we're sick of these glitches.
---
Make No Mither give double Bp!
---
Op is the worst.
---
The thing I hate about it now is that the Obsession is now random. Why? It just forces me as killer to wait a minute after downing someone as opposed to just doing it to that one fucking guy. Isn't that fun gameplay? You stay slugged for a minute and the killer waits because of one perk? Isn't that fun?
---
And I love they removed Enduring's minimal effect against DS too. I fully expect another buff to DS soon along with yet another buff to Borrowed Time (AKA Broken Time). But if you complain about those two cancer perks you're just told that you're a bad killer, git gud, this is a casual game so assholes are free to play however they want to (but killer's cannot because that makes sense to insane people), and etcetera and etcetera.
---
Survivor Mains will never concede to anything being op. These pricks defended old DS as being fair and used the same old excuses I just mentioned. 
---
Meanwhile most killers, myself included, are fine with NOED being removed and Nurse/Billy nerfs IF the game is actually fucking balanced. Survivor Mains incessantly cry about NOED, cry about Nurse, cry about tunneling, cry about camping, cry about mori's  and all that. Fine. Take out NOED. Remove it. I'm good. Just balance the fucking game. Slow down the fucking gens. Add secondary objectives. Fucking something so we don't need Ruin. Better yet, slow down the gens and give the cancer perks survivors always use an actual down side. How about if Dead Hard doesn't give them that extra little burst of speed so assholes can't make it to a safe pallet? How about all the obnoxious 2nd chance/get away for free perks affect action speed or something? Run DS or Unbreakable? Here, have an action speed nerf. 25% should be fine for running shit like that. Run around with Sprint Burst or Borrowed Time? How about you can't fast vault anymore? Can only slow vault and that also applies to pallets. That would be good. Adrenaline? Can't use items. Cannot equip an item before a match and can't pick one up during a match. Self Care finally, finally, finally, finally, fucking finally has a limited number of heals so no more running to a cancer loop spot and healing as much as you want. There you go. Just whack all of the fucking cancer perks. Behavior needs to grow some fucking balls and stop listening to these fucking mongoloids.

Hopefully not all today

&gt;genrushing

Doesnt exist

But I can agree that I've been facing "clans" as killer that are somehow red ranks who are absolute godawful. Why are you in dbd clan if youre that trash?
---
Woops, my bad. I forgot that some children were raised by trailer trash who disregarded proper upbringing as an important aspect of the real world. The resulting kids are no better than animals with a chewtoy and I might as well move on. You'll be eating your own defecation long after I've moved on, so I might as well get out of your way and let you get back to that.

Those killers are just showing they love you. Thank them for the love and tell them they need a breath mint. Lol

Why not zoidberg

You cannot. I've tried this and you still cannot hook them.

Dude! I had the luckiest hatch escape also. I have the video on my profile

Yeeees

What's the point of getting rid of items?
---
Nah don't be sorry, you laid it out really kindly
---
When I load up dbd my PS4 flashes red and shows a warning saying it‚Äôs to hot, even when iv just turned it on.
---
I was about to reply seriously pointing out multiple flaws and stupidity in your arguments but thankfully I checked your profile first.
---
Literally first comment of a brand new account... think I'll pass.
---
the good news is..... yeah I got nothing
---
Naw i rape with spirit on any map, it's all about her mind games and how you use her power
---
Props. Been wanting to play nurse on console, but have felt discouraged seeing posts staying how hard she is
---
Any killer is really strong when you just start because survivors don't know how to play. Once you get to 14+, it'll get a lot more challenging and you'll be glad you have ruin.
---
One quick google search will tell you that it was the mind flayer in physical form. It didn‚Äôt die when the physical form died, it‚Äôs still a shadow in the upside down, but that was still it.
---
It‚Äôs only a problem when you‚Äôre Doctor or Freddy with fake pallets.
---
I think this bug is a case of we don't know or it would have been fixed. I think several things can cause it not just one thing.
---
I remember in some patch notes or dev article they said they added tracking for the issue to help find causes and resolve them so I don't think they even know all the causes.
---
As for abuse it you can't really if gates are open endgame has started and you have 2 minutes to explore then die by then entity.
---
... what in the deep corners of hell?
---
Adept plague; it‚Äôs the only one I haven‚Äôt gotten and it‚Äôs annoying..
---
And camping isn‚Äôt a good strategy and will make you lose if your not facing potato survivors and how in anyway does this invalidate my point yes Leather Face is one of the worst killers in the game
---
You‚Äôre playingg spirit. Loops dont exist after you get a hit, any other killer fair enough complain but when a killers power completely negates looping and has 0 counterplay other then luck theres really no reason to complain
---
Dude i know im a no life for it but i read ALL the lore your killers are a tad off tbh im not hatin and if you want ill explain them all lol
---
I've seen a game do this before... ohh wait it was this one...
---
Mandatory... pretty good job so far
---
You need more water team, got a little too much salt in your diet lately.
---
The same amount of players on both sides are whiny, you cannot say survivors ALL bitch about something then count yourself in the majority for killers who are okay with other nerfs.  
---
DS is so assholes don't tunnel so much, and people use it to their advantage, same as killers who need NOED is a crutch for new/bad killers.  Every good perk can be abused, but GTFO with your crazy last post.
---
Honestly, even as someone that almost always runs Spine Chill when I play survivor I've gotta say that I agree. If a perk completely breaks a bunch of killers' only power then something is wrong with it.
---
Then don't play until they fix more maps. Take a break.
---
There should only be crossplay between consoles
---
It's just a little vomit.
---
Yea that one. I won't dear to touch that one without any friends
---
Long answer: definitely. Hell yea. 
---
Short answer: yup
---
I hate using plague in general it‚Äôs no fun
---
Yeah but F13 fucking sucked on release. Was a glitcher shithole then DbD has ever been, an a cess pool for trolls and team killers.
---
Have your opinions, but understand they are not facts an I do not agree with them.

Yeah :c

Yeah no shit sweaty swf time

no not really all I care about is getting my 4 BBQ stacks I don't really care if all 4 escape

How you get the survivors faces?
---
Yea I don't even get why it even exist in the game as a achievement like wtf
---
As a killer main honestly I think current DS is in a good place... on occasion in endgame it has cost me a kill but win some lose some.
---
It‚Äôs never really gonna happen naturally which is why it‚Äôs annoying
---
What is the joke?
---
Kinda sad but i do the same lol, almost every game has people dcing or the game goes down to 2 people and there's 1 person trying and the other just hiding in a locker. In both of those cases, or if a survivor played particularly well and survived to be the last person, i give em the hatch at the end.

New meta survivors' perks are totally fine unless they are like MoM - giving reward for making mistakes and being 0 counter crutch perk if used correctly.

That‚Äôs a funny / friendly-salty post-game msg idea

Same I don't really care if I don't get a 4k all I care about is getting my BBQ stacks for some extra bloodpoints

Honestly I was in red ranks and got reset to 11 or so and bc I'm a solo player (someone with no friends lmao) I hate to play with the higher rank survivors that run around half the game without touching a gen, injured or hooked person.  If they wanna improve the system make it so that every two days you dont play you depip (not a whole rank, just a pip).
