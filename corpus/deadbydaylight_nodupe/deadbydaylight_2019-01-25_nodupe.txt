Is normal looping considered toxic now? Has that been a thing?
---
---
---
How am I a SJW? I’m just exposing how inconsistent 
---
&lt;3
---
Keyboard warrior
---
Yeah, but any other killer would have been able to hit them off of her. Freddy can't. 
---
Not sure why this is a thing, they allow completion of dailies, Queue the red claw circle up top, profile saved during a trial, DC then daily still done. Fail on behalf of the games producer for non standardization. 
---
Nope. Just a regular guy who loves a bit of hypocrisy 
---
Nerf them so nobody plays them untill the rework
---
I personally never DC for any reason but it feels like 90% of games if you're the first one downed the killer is just gonna tunnel you until you die so I can understand the mentality. 
---
I like :Autodidact, We're gonna live forever, empathy, and Aftercare: it's a good team build and after helping people you can use them as beacons of where the killer is to avoid him better
---
I love how you told him to learn to play against a killer you can't outplay
---
No, i meant non toxic as in no t-bagging, flashlight clicking and all that stuff. :)
---
Reverse this.
---
Ohhhhh ok
---
Been seeing this for more than a week, was in before patch.
---
I too was staring at them tiddies
---
I just want the game to run at a reasonable fps on console
---
I need an adult?
---
During the stream one of the devs said that the event offerings affect your bp gain, so you will still get extra points even without the bp multipliers.
---
They do get banned, but it takes a couple months.
---
Tis the angriest piano I've heard. Especially the low note of dread.
---
Already have them all :(
---
Well because if survivors are getting their purple items and iridescent items from the chests then it is only fair that killers should be able to use purple and iridescent addons more. 
---
BHVR has openly said they have no system to ban players on console unfortunately
---
Because Freddy doesn’t need to. Again, he gets more out of putting three people in the dream world and then re-downing the obsession than any other killer does out of interrupting a heal.
---
Oh I'm sorry here is one for you:
---

---
Today I met a Dwight,
---
He had a flashlight.
---
Add-ons were a thing,
---
Good weapon against bong-bing.
---
But what had happened next?
---
Can't tell you in a text,
---
I might as well try,
---
To let out a huge cry.
---
Why is it so easy,
---
To hit that f**king DC?
---
Dwight, that little t*at,
---
Did exactly that. 
---
Last Time sounds really cool, especially for the visual of the entity on your back. It should probably only apply to the last person in the trial though. If everyone got the lucky 75%  that would really suck for the killer.
---
Hillbilly, Pig, Trapper, Legion, Shape, Wraith, Clown, Doctor, Hag, Spirit, Cannibal, Huntress, Nurse, and Nightmare.    That's My Personal List in Order \^\_\^
---
where's enduring?
---
No they for sure won't. Any other killer will have them down before they get the downed person up. Freddy MIGHT have them asleep and injured. At which point all 3 scatter and you get to pick one to chase down while the rest continue on their way and you've lost all pressure. If mikey or trapper smack them off or down them you now have lots of pressure.
---
And the other two get skillchecks before I can do anything with them. How much did that really do for me? Not much.
---
Yeah I can bounce to this
---
I see this all the time and its like.. gg thanks for rewarding the killer. If you know its a Bubba, and you have zero heartbeat near the basement and didn't see him leave gg for doing this you're screwing your team. Let the person die and do gens.
---
This is beyond science
---
This happens way too often. Either that or they spam flashlight and when you down them BOOM insta DC. 
---
ah fuck you got me :(
---
only with bad survivors. Anyone half decent will hear the saw (if you use it) and notice you don't leave so they will stay away.
---
Is there anything good about legion?
---
In a perfect world you would be able to still see the list of achievements and click on them to redeem their BP
---
Imma stop you right there.
---
BHVR have a better track record than most devs.
---
How much support has Black Ops 4 gotten since launch? 
---
PUBG is still a mess on consoles.
---
Did you SEE what happened with Battlefield V?
---
Friday the 13th is laughable in comparison to DBD.
---
Etc.
---
So you loose it if you die, if you have a vial you glow slightly? Ok. Sorry claudettes.
---
That dog has a good sense of what he should be avoiding
---
Yes. Yes 
---
I'm tempted too when the killer is sluggin, camping, tunneling, but I never do, because that just gives them what they want and if not, I don't have to punish someone just because I'm bad. 
---
That's like complaining that you didn't play 'rock' before your opponent played 'scissors'. Them's the breaks. 
---
Would be nice but Licensed killers are stuck with 1 outfit. 
---
&gt;You can wake up pretty much instantly after you’ve been put to sleep
---
Not without blowing up a generator and immediately being put back to sleep, except with less progress now.
---
&gt;Freddy gets looped for days
---
Everyone gets looped. Freddy has the option of leaving to go after someone else, because that survivor isn’t doing anything progress-wise for a while.
---
&gt;He gives you a 7 second warning before he can actually attack you
---
And in that time he can get into attacking range if you’re running, or grab more survivors / break a generator if you’re not.
---
Not really.  The P3 cosmetics are shit unless you're Claudette.  And even then there's a better one in the store.  And prestiging is borderline worthless anyway.  I only have a few PIII characters and that's never gonna change.  You're not missing out.  At all.
---
was this not addressed in an earlier comment? the VFX for deep wounds/borrowed time (which applies the deep wound effect so really they're the same) was changed to incorporate more blood in it because they wanted the survivor to feel as if they were in peril. in other words the deep wounds screen was changed not to hinder vision but merely to add flavour to the game. so yes, the devs did say something along those lines in the patch notes 
---
No, the worst is the furry that Spies from the Shadows while you're pooping.
---
&gt;If you sleep them again and follow them the other two hit a gen and wake up easy and you've lost all pressure.
---
You haven’t lost anything. You have a person downed and damaged generators. By the time the 2 survivors hit the generator and wake up, you should have the downed guy on a hook and then it’s as easy as walking to the exploding generator notification, re-sleeping the ones that ran, and chasing them down.
---
Nice
---
I wish i could give silcer to you rn.
---
I'm pretty sure shaggy would instantly mori the spooky stalker 
---
you felt so bad you tried to stay at the door for bm. Nice.
---
Sorry my handwriting sucks. I’ll try and articulate some of the perks in text form 
---
Blind rage: so if your on your last hook (After struggle and attempt) the first time you are hit (from healthy to standing but injured) you will stun the killer for 1/2/3 seconds depending on level. You will also gain a 30% speed boost for 1/2/3 seconds depending on level and you will have a red tinted screen for a little bit. I thought this would be an easier but similar replacement for decisive strike
---
Last time: This perk has a 75% chance of activating and will only activate on your 3rd/last hook. If it activates you’ll fall from the hook with the entity still on you. And it will only take one hit to kill you. And then once you’re off you have a timer to get out before the entity kills you itself, the timers are 2/3/3:30 depending on level. You can escape through either the doors or hatch. In addition to this, the hatch will open during these few minutes to let you go through, and if you’re near the hatch it will kind of draw you toward it. I thought this would be a kind of interesting perk that saved you, but also put you on a time crunch. 
---
Outlier: You have a decreased chance of becoming the obsession. If you are the obsession, repair and heal speed is increased by 10%. On the flip side of this, it will take longer to struggle out of the killers traps and have no attempt to escape option(although the timer on it will stay the same) 
---
You get more points for actions during the event, as you gain coins for doing generators and hooking people. Even without the multiplier you are getting more points than usual.
---
Exploiting the game should be bannable. The exploit being in the game doesn't justify people abusing it.
---
They don't really care if you tell them if you used it, they would find out on their own. It's not like they are banking on people admitting that they've abused the exploit.
---
Chase the injured one and hook him. The 2 in the dream world will have to either get help from the last survivor or blow up a generator, all of which slows them down and gives you your next target to go after.
---
The pressure comes from them now having a guy hooked, a generator broken, and a killer on the way.
---
Every morning I boot up some Dead by Daylight and head into the salt mines as a proud Doctor main. Sometimes the survivors just give up and stand still at gens, some try to loop me. They soon find out the Doctor is near un-loopable. It's a fulfilling killer main.
---
Because people don’t want to get camped and focused all game first person down is usually tunneled for the rest of the match
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Oh, you're one of those cocksucking streamers that always has people enter your lobby and body block and bring Instant Heals into your game. 
---
Also, no addons. 
---
You get more points for hooking and doing generators. You can completely ignore the event and still get more points than you would outside of the event. And interacting with the vessels nets you bonus points too.
---
Even without the multiplier you are getting more points than usual.
---
I've heard this happens if you have your FPS uncapped but i'm not sure if that's true.
---
Really? That sucks.
---
The third panel got me rolling, lmao.
---
Even if you don't EVER escape with a vessel, you can still easily get 12-20 points a match as a Survivor.
---
As Killer, getting 3 kills (2x3 hooks + 1x2 hook + 1x1 hook) and destroying 4 vessels will net you 30 points.
---
That's possibly 50 points for every two matches, meaning you'd have to play about 180 matches (if playing both sides equally).
---
That's roughly 13 matches a day for the 14 days the event is active.
---
Yeah... that's a lot.
---
If you don't leave them and just chase he's an m1 killer who gave a 7 second head start. Objectively worse than trapper and mikey. Obviously you have to pressure champ, but if you sleep multiple people you can only choose one. The others wake up near instantly at any gen or by finding another survivor, or self caring.
---
Trappers traps sure can be disarmed quickly, but they also almost guarantee a hook, and if you have good trap placement its not like its a free disarn, they have to actually find it.
---
Mikey CAN get looped for a minute, sure, but if you don't pop it until youre about to down a person they can't. And for an entire minute you get one hit downs, which means no bodyblocking, and you can punish the fuck out of misplays. He has insane hook defense and pressure with nearly on demand one hits. Not to mention his addons don't just make his power less shit like freddy's, they actually increase his lethality. 
---
Freddy's power is brain dead easy, i agree, but it has far less impact than you are acting like it does. If you aren't actively chasing someone they're going to wake up basically immediately. At least mikey and trapper can get free hits on people they bump into during a chase, freddy just slightly delays them and slows himself down dramatically to do it.
---
You get more points for event related things, so doing gens and hooking people, basic game mechanics.
---
Even without a multiplier you are getting more points than you would normally.
---
I feel like this won't even happen for PC players and him claiming people will be banned was purely to scare them into not doing it.
---
You can see survivors’ auras though. If you’re in a chase and see a survivor being woken up, break off and put both of them into the dream world. If they go to a generator and blow it up, then they’ve just set back their own progress, and that’s a win for you, because you’ve basically just set back a generator without ever having to be there to break it yourself.
---
This is a lot of bollocks.
---
There is no such thing as gen rush. Doing gens is the objective for survivors. 
---
If you think the game is unbalanced, tell the devs. Don't start being a cunt to other players.
---
I have been playing killer all day/night. I've played with Pig for a few hours and Freddy the rest. I have not dodged a single lobby like some sad pricks do continuously. I have not camped, tunnelled or slugged the 3rd person to go on a 5 minute hunt for the last survivor like some sad pricks do continuously. I've 3 or 4 kill many of those games. A few have been 2 kills. Had a couple of games where 3 or all survivors escaped. A handful of matches had a few pricks in. That means 2 or 3. Doesn't feel that unfair overall to me.
---
Indeed! You still have to invest in the bloodweb, just not in every single item now.
---
A large number of crows in one place that all set oFF at the same time. Like on the big boat on the Pale Rose map. I guess it's called a bomb because it's kinda like an explosion happening.
---
I think it's interesting how everyone new to the game feels Freddy is very op, even I felt the same, but once you get used to the game you will get why he is the weakest killer and this is coming from a Freddy main. Fact is it's very hard to pressure the map the same as other killers, people can wake up easily from sleep unless you have some of the bettter add-ons, he is slow so can't handle loops well and forget having hatch standoffs or stopping people when the gates are open lol. The only thing Freddy has is a great range on his lunge. 
---
More selfish when playing solo, more altruistic if playing with a friend or a group. 
---
Unless the gates are powered, it's better to be altruistic and save someone off the hook because the killer will break many vessels if the survivor stays on the hook for a long time. This is an incentive to save your teammates.
---
But yeah, expect more immersed teammates that camp hatch after doing 2 gens.
---
Shaggy couldn’t be put into the game because he could down everyone in a heartbeat without using 0.01% of his power
---
I love the fact that you see nothing in deep sound because it makes looping pretty much impossible. That’s how it should be.
---
except all their BP
---
Well i do uncap my fps so I guess that would make sense 
---
Make sure you do it on console.
---
Because ban is permanent and on console there is none.
---
I love that style of drawing tbh
---
I honestly think Dwight is a better support character than Claudette now. Leader, Bond, and Prove thyself are a good combination of perks that supports your team better than Claudette’s perks. Especially since one of her perks is called self care which is a “selfish” perk.
---
Claudette only has Empathy and botany which is alright if you’re only look to heal people. But I think bond is better because you stick together with people and gen rush faster.
---
I think her camouflage was unintentional. I bet they didn’t take into consideration that Claudette with her P3 clothes is nigh invisible. They probably don’t care.
---
&gt;* No Bloodhunt / Double bloodpoints 
---
And like that you've lost me.
---
Better idea: make very powerful add ons have just as powerful drawbacks so that they don't make you stronger, they just change how you play the game. Tombstone Meyers is a great example of this, because he isn't overpowered despite using two ultra rare items.
---
Yeah, but if a survivor is willing to give up a perk slot for a random addon.. fair play. Im sure the killer would rather they did that too.
---
 
---
&gt; Every generator and hook will be themed
---
And like that you've lost me. 
---
Prestige exploit?
---
LOL FUCK NO THEY AREN'T. LITERALLY THE BEST THING THEY COULD DO FOR THIS GAME IS ADD MOD SUPPORT AND HOPE SOMEONE ELSE CLEANS UP THEIR SHIT
---
DARN
---
&gt; No Bloodhunt / Double bloodpoints 
---
I love how you missed the skill check almost mockingly weird flex but alright 
---
30 second chase is a big underestimation lol
---
Lol 
---
I had a game last night as survivor where the only thing on the HUD was the map name. I couldn’t see progress bars or prompts and I couldn’t heal myself or others. I managed to complete 2 gens by gen tapping (there was no ruin) and escape. It was quite the gaming experience. 
---
Bish, you stank, clean yo damn ears
---
She would tell me I’m a dumb ass for breaking the game. 
---
I like being dirty &gt;:U REEEEEEEE
---
Ummm.....he happens to play killer you fool.
---
THIS IS SO FUNNY
---
Just buff camping to discourage camping 4head
---
It was to wake up from dream state
---
That does not change the fact he is slow lol or that his lunge is great? I was just stating well known facts about Freddy not saying it was only him so I don't really get the point of your comment.
---
When you pull your cord to get out of the map. reported. FYI for all those that want. walk towards exit, unplug eth cord first while hold w, then let go of w, plug cord back in, your out of the map. Horrid exploit due to bad codding devs have yet to fix. 
---
I found out by accident when killer lagswitched me. I put 2 and 2 together. 
---
Devs are too lazy to fix. Make exit area instead of thin line ffs. This has existed since the beggingin of the game. 
---
Good to know, thank you :)
---
As much as I hate to say it. Call of duty did it best.
---
For example, there were challenges with tiers. Plant 5 bombs/ plant 10 bombs/ plant 20 bombs all with increasingly larger Xp. Maybe they could use that sort of concept. As in complete 5/10/20 gens and be rewarded with blood points or maybe iridescent shards
---
You can't be banned on console? Why?
---
I have people rage quit on site, likeI'm just using him so I can make it rain with bp's
---
0/10 knife not sharp enough
---
Dude I went against a legion in green ranks with good perks but pretty bad add ons and clapped em.
---
I mean also playing Freddy without dream transition addons (who does that)
---
also playing Freddy at all
---
also just being a W gamer
---
he also had the addon to block his appearance during the dream transition, by the looks of it, and could have easily bodyblocked the stairs, which almost certainly one would have taken
---
lets report this person for not getting downed
---
Whoops, read past the loop part. That's why I was confused about there still being 2
---
They always ask if they need to worry about grenades, but no one asks how are the nades
---
I feel like there's a dbdgonewild joke to be made here but I'm too dang tired
---
Oh I am an idiot i suppose 
---
Wish there were beartrap skins for trapper so I could change the noise to Matthew Cotè saying “well shucks”
---
Whats your point? Its green ranks and he has bad addons
---
That's not true they have "bloody" clothing
---
Yeah I find it ok for you to be punished by camping one guy while others do the generators. That's really unfun for both sides and frankly if you need to camp to win games with Billy and Nurse then I think you need to work on your performance, as neither of them need to camp to win games.
---
ALL. THE. FUCKING. TIME.
---
Doctor is my boi
---
Thank you, friend, cheers! How do you feel about her new cosmetics?
---
I'm not mad just disappointed
---
Yeah it's hard at those early ranks due to inexperienced survivors. I don't think I can give any good advice to get out of the ranks but I guess you can try being immersed. It worked for me when I first started out which was last summer. 
---
How do you define "Win?" Escape or a pip? Because even if you're solo, pipping's easy. Escaping is a crapshoot if you're not SWF.
---
eciN
---
Nea being friendly with the killer... I KNEW IT!
---
Weird flex but okay
---
The Wraith and the Huntress ones are my favorites! Especially the Wraith one!
---
Weird oinks but okay**
---
You spelled Joey wrong.
---
P O G 😩👌🏻
---
What do you mean by there’s a lockdown? Sorry I’m dumb
---
No you're not the only one, let's try and get these dedicated servers first though.
---
Wait, is this really you? 
---
It’s my cosplay, yes~
---
I clenched because of how amazing this is.
---
It’s really good on Wraith
---
But I spent money on him if they do that would I get a refund 
---
Cross your fingers and hope your teammates don't body block you and aren't shit at skill checks
---
I love beast of prey I feel like its superunderrated tho
---
That also
---
Just use prove thyself and farm your teammates to pip to get out of those ranks. Those ranks are filled with urban evaison neas and claudettes who hide when they hear the heartbeat
---
I cant believe an exploit that obvious is ingame. Shesh. 
---
All played as survivor - forgot to mention that in the title :( sry
---
If you try to do 4 man swf on console (at least xbox) you will be waiting upwards of 20 minutes for a game regardless of average rank. If you aren't 4 man (even if you're 3 man) queue times go a lot faster.
---
It's weird because if I play Killer I'll get a 4 man swf joining about 60% of the time.
---
NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP, BABY
---
Noob lol 
---
🤫
---
TEAMWORK
---
He's a very good killer player on twitch, lots of advice to give and tips on how to improve, especially on his YouTube.
---
Give him a watch and you may learn something 
---
That's where you're wrong kiddo.
---
Nah Bruh, I just use Deerstalker, can't make hook saves if they don't go on a hook.
---
No Mither. You’ll never have to worry about the exposed status effect!
---
I literally see that totem at crotus Penn everytime
---
[removed]
---
Oh yeah, that's hot
---
the legions locker perk gets rid of the locker counter as well as gives you exposed status when you leave the locker 
---
so the only real counter to him now is calm spirit
---
It’s fairly easy to beat legions. Yes we were green ranks and he had meh add ons, but we all were in green rank and all had similar colored add ons and perks. Meaning we were placed equally. 
---
Susie
---
hmm colorfull. Gays are colorfull. Devsa can't make skin for myers cus copyrgiht so workaroundis... shirless myers confirm! ne killer.
---
really?  i love billy.  hes makes the lower ranks a breeze(tbf though any killer is viable in low rank) but it feels so satisfying getting one hit downs. because they arent thst easy in high ranks
---
Just buy LF. It’s like the cost of a cup of coffee. 
---
I was gay, but now I'm double gay.
---
no, I play to have fun not for you to have fun 
---
Nah, I'm good. I'm a rank 1 Billy so I don't care what some self-proclaimed big shot says. 
---
He can still be looped and Iron Maiden is in the same league as Calm Spirit, don't know anyone who runs it
---
This game really needs to be fixed with having a dc its fucking shit and ruins your night.  
---
1 gen is not enough it does not count as 1 player.  
---
This absolute cunt who deserves to be hanged in front of his family. Trapped nea and then camped her till death. at this time there was 1 gen left. But then another got caught and it was game over. He just stood there waiting for us to die.  
---
This game can be a piece of shit sometimes.
---
LF mains know that camping actually slows the game down lmao 
---
If the community response to your big special event is an extra-long groan of frustration then you need to stop doing events until you look back and ask yourself how you managed to fuck things up this bad.
---
Thanks. I've had the luck to still be rank 17 so some people try to escape with the traps if I put it on at the end. Sadly I don't have nurses or thanataphobia or ruin unlocked yet. I started playing over the free weekend. I usually run make your choice, no ed, SFTS, and surveillance.
---
Which means you've never versed a good legion who knows what hes doing.
---
I feel like it’s improved. I’d check those settings because I’m now hitting them 80% of the time. 
---
You think this is bad? Back waaaaaayyyyy then, most matches, it used to lag like HELL ITSELF. These are but alas rare sights and weak bugs that don’t alter the game to a point of literally unplayable.
---
But this still is bad from what I’m reading. 
---
Dragon freddy rework confirmed 100%. Dream world transition gone replaced with fire breathing .
---
Nice. I never thought thst insidious can be used that way!
---
It’s the wrong description I’ve heard
---
everytime i play survivor i either get legion or Myers
---
you have hag in there twice
---
To be honest, as a killer I usually farm with the survivors, but that gets boring when there's 2 people who leave every single match, so you know. It isn't that killers don't care, it's that they can't just farm EVERY match.
---
sh0wstopper\_ps got arrested for sexual assault 
---
Literally got hooked just now after the exit gates opened. Last team mate left me hanging. To die. 
---
Calm your fucking tits. This was actually kill your friends with us all in a party chat. I knew he wouldn't tunnel.
---
Opposite for killer
---
D A R N
---
Yeah...maybe that would need to be worked on? It doesn’t really mad though just some ideas o thought up 
---
Oops I didn’t realize it wasn’t supposed to be mentioned. They mentioned it on stream today. I think they threatened resetting and banning people who use it. That said I’m sure console players will get away with it since bhvr can’t ban them
---
He deserves to be hanged in front of his family because he did something mean in a video game? Lmao I’d advise you to see a therapist if you’re truly this mad bro. 
---
I used WGFM to get it straight, hot off the presses from David. Worth every blood cell.
---
Is there a nice DbD reddit no one told me about?
---
Lol really? You got a link to a news source?
---
Just had a game where someone rage quit because I downed them after they got off the hook (T3 madness kinda fucks hooked survivors tbh). The hook I was going to put them on was the only one in the area. Later that game, I downed someone right by that hook. Since they dc'ed, the hook was still there. Had they stuck around to be sacrificed, that second survivor probably would've wiggled free before I got to the next nearest hook.
---
I hate players like you. 
---
Its is, but I miss evolve. :'(
---
I did this to some poor people earlier.
---
If you're playing solo survivor, it's useful. In swf, the bond becomes useless tho
---
Hope there's something for my boi.
---
How the fuck am I supposed to know that? That's exactly why I asked. 
---
He did an even worse offense: Not getting Tombstoned! He must be permanently banned from DbD!
---
There's lots of dudes out there that can't afford to buy a ton of games.
---
So every now and then I buy a game and give it away to people. 
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
Neat guide. Do you have any others?
---
Doesn't always work but can give a nice jumpscare! 
---
Yea how can they ban console people? They can’t tell how it was done?
---
Then you gotta turn it back up to hear the gameplay, then have your eardrums erupt from Haddonfield
---
One. It’s for the Nurse, but I bet because of new Perks/Perk changes, it’s probably outdated, but go for it anyway!
---
"Legion is broken" 
---
This is the kind of quality humor I come to this sub for.
---
This is me my last 3 games.
---
Well they can ban people on pc, but they can’t ban anyone on console. I’m not sure why it’s like that, I kinda wish it wasn’t. 
---
You coulda just typed it mate. 
---
What even
---
One big issue I can see is Survivors actively standing by Vessels until someone's hooked.
---
In the console universe we have this thing called FPS drops. It happens constantly to the point where sometimes survivors can just disappear off screen. That's what happened here lol.
---
Darn
---
Prestiges. I don't know what, or how, and even if I did the mods would remove the comment for breaking EULA, but there's currently a bug that can let you get free prestiges. They're going to fix it by the next week and warned players they'll be banned for abusing it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Don't do it on accident.
---
down voted we were never supposed to see this
---
in what planet is doctor un-loopable, it's like his biggest weakness.
---
Aaaaaah
---
Tried to farm with him earlier today. Hooked the first guy and left him alone so they could save him. They just let him die and didn't get anything done so went and killed the rest. Was fun. Would zap again
---
I thought it was only me experiencing this..
---
Hey, OP. Don't take it in the wrong way. But why are you not using pallets 😂
---
While I dislike your DS use as a killer main, I have to admit that it can be quite useful as seen there. 
---
Implication does not mean for sure. But it wouldn't be a surprise either.
---
If that's how it works, yes. But I can't test it since I don't have someone to hop into kyf mode
---
Probably not the reason but my theory is that killers are sick of the shit they have to deal with and so there's less
---
Yes. But still it is bad to do that unless it's end game and hook is near exit game. You are only making it easier by letting him tunnel 
---
Add ‘farming’ and you got everything
---
Yeah this whole thing is twisted. Hag A tier? With the speed of this meta? Nah.
---
When they specifically sabotaged event hooks to make sure the killer could not earn event progress.
---
It is what they call "The big gay"
---
I'm 18 but my handwriting hasn't gotten better then age 6 sorry 😅
---
I seriously don't understand how they don't have few lines of code to check where the totem is.
---
Pretty much the opposite of me. Really slow killer ques and fast survivor ques.
---
Amanda's Letter I think? 
---
I think Myers won.  He changed it up, and that's guaranteed style points.
---
This tier list is all fucked up.
---
Oh, shit.
---
Evolve?
---
Stardew Valley, RimWorld, Binding of Isaac, The Forest, Dwarf Fortress, and Factorio are all indie games that have received years of updates from teams significantly smaller than BHVR over roughly the same time frame, and they are all fantastic games.
---
Even if you're not counting them for not being multiplayer, saying "Other things also suck" doesn't give them a pass. Placing a 4/10 next to a 2/10 doesn't suddenly make the 4 a 10.

Ah! I see, I'll keep that in mind for next time. Thanks!
---
Time to use my mori haha..
---
I am deceased 
---
No u
---
It's worse if survivors do tbh, killers leave, the game ends and everyone moves on. Survivor dcs and now 4 other people have the game ruined because they are still locked in. 
---
Why monitor over distressing? 
---
Should've hopped in a locker you have nothing to lose
---
surely swf combat this easily still. They simply just use comms and do 2 gens.
---
I know the star of the show here is dat Spirit ass, but Reporter!Wraith needs some love, too. 
---
Thank you! I have to admit it helped that my Siblings used to make me play all my Games in English with only half of the subtitles, haha :D
---
Will do! I mean tbh if it gets too obnoxious (which I doubt since I luckily do have lighter hair anyways) I can always just dye it, I suppose. I most likely won't since I'm too lazy but there's always an option to keep it positive, I'd say.
---
Lategame I like to be able to get close to people in punishment stance, it's really just personal preference though.
---
If the trap is put on past the exit gate, you can leave 
---
Exactly
---
survivor DC = no BBQ tokens is dumb
---
Cool, just curious. I used to main doctor a lot. Monitor can definitely be a lot of fun on him. Just haven’t thought of using it in conjunction with UP over distressing 
---
Seraph of the End, idk about the other one because i just found these 2 off google by searching manga strips
---
Is this how pork rinds are made?

I haven't updated my log since Tuesday, but of 89 trials since January 1st:
---
Trapper - 7

Wraith - 5
---
Hillbilly - 12
---
Nurse - 1
---
Huntress - 8
---
Legion - 11

Cannibal - 11

Doctor - 5

Nightmare - 8
---
Pig - 4
---
Clown - none
---
Spirit - 7
---
This right here. Is the best.
---
Damn... this hurts.
---
Take a break man, if a game is getting you this fired up it’s not healthy. 
---
You zap them before they get to a window/pallet and they can't vault/drop the pallet so you get a free hit.
---
I found it online sorry.
---
What’s weird is the vault button is R1 and the hit button is R2. So you’re right he did go autopilot.
---
 Interesting stats man
---
ENTITY d̶i̶s̶PLEASED
---
The Killer might feel bad, but IME, most Killers don't give a fuck and are happy because an early DC usually means 3K.
---
I don't think it needs to be changed in the way of progression just give it more skill check chance or make a different perk for higher skill check chance 
---
Is this confirmed anywhere? 
---
Fellow spinechill user *hug*
---
Mirror myers
---
I was once confused to, but whenever you read the word BONUS in a perk or add on or offering, it applies to totals AFTER the trial, so the Spotted Wreath for Hunting will add whatever you earned during the trial to the total number of bloodpoints gained for the trial, not to the bloodpoints earned in the catagory. 
---
So imagine you score 4000 in all categories.
---
And you used a Survivor Pudding. That gives you 100% BONUS bloodpoints in all categories. So you would make 16000 base bloodpoints. Then add another 16000, on top of it because of the offering. I'll save some characters and just say that BBQ and Chili has the same concept after hooking all four survivors. But if you have both BBQ and and Survivor Pudding, those BONUSES stack. So you would get BONUS 100% for BBQ AND 100% BONUS for Pudding. So with the numbers above you would get 16000 +16000 +16000. 
---
Now for some perks or add ons, they add a percantage to the bloodpoints you gain IN the trial. So like Distressing ads 26% to Deviousness points earned IN the trial. 
---
I cant think off the top of my head but I think Doctor's Shock Treatment gives 600 Deviousness points when you hit a survivor. So if you add Distressing to his build you would gain those points in that catagory, basically faster. 
---
Or crazy RNG...I have 8 after getting my Nurse to 40 for the teachable. My doctor who is lvl 42 has 0.
---
My mom doesn't let me buy games. I'm sharin a library with mah friend.
---
It does not
---
APPEALS ARE NOT ALLOWED FOR HIM #banop
---
Big pog
---
I like that you wrote it on paper: I love seeing people’s handwriting! :)
---
It’s also a great idea, for an add-on! 
---
The game says that you survived, but since the game says you didn’t do anything like repair, unhook, win chases, etc. You don’t get pips
---
Lmao this is great 
---
Thank you 😊
---
Good to know ;)
---
who invited the cheeto
---
I see a name at the top
---
Wow, I'm speechless. Planning to upload more? I sub in case
---
Mori me harder daddy 
---
That's a story not a rant. 
---
What ever idk to be honest i just don’t know why they do that 
---
You underestimated rainbow map power. It saved my ass so many time if all other teammates are useless, which mean a free hatch escape.
---
Yes it the crows don't proc it doesn't work
---
I oink you too!
---
Well, up until the killer is Doc running a 3 gen strat build.
---
Thank you :3
---
Should I be worried?
---
It's just aggravating a bit because he would fit in the game so well lol
---
People who play DBD are little babies that get upset when things don't go their way. 
---
The cosplay is incredible!
---
Until someone mentions ds or noed
---
*Standing at the exit, maybe wanting to give the killer free points, not teabagging or anything*. Fucking toxic survivor, absolute scum. I swear some people lol.
---
This is great! Which killer do you prefer to play against?
---
You don’t see auras but I like nurses calling on her. As long as you can remember where they are before you go into spirit world you’ve got a good chance at hitting them just by going to that area and listening for the heal
---
So.... why exactly did you feel the need to post this?
---
Lol that one got me pretty good
---
Legion because I have a 4.50 win ratio! 
---
I had to delete the same post because someone could see the names
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Um... Sorry, they made three full sets (or 9 pieces) available then too. So they’re actually giving us less with this event because again only the three free sets this time are possible, you can’t choose anything outside of those three sets with money or grindables. I’m ok with what they’re doing, but I can’t agree with the notion that less is somehow more, in this particular comparison.
---
Sh*t
---
When you are in the insidious phase, if you rev the chainsaw without moving, will you still be stealthy? 
---
I love doing this. 
---
The devs stated they would like to have Jason. Friday the 13th being a game doesn’t make a difference because the makers no longer own the intellectual property, that’s why their game lost support if I’m not mistaken. It is possible for BHVR to some form of Jason.  Just like they got the licenses for specific versions of the killers that are currently in the game 
---
I totally get your point, Also taking into account both the restriction of no 2 perks from the same person (that would change not just only bbq's) and a perk can't reappear the next 2 weeks is kind of hard and would make this look really messy. I'll still stand my ground that its not enough evidence to call it rigged but lets see...
---
Weird flex
---
He trying to get SWOL
---
That casually gives me hope!
---
...you ok?
---
Sorry i am from other country what is SWF ?
---
Doing gens you?
---
I only dc if the killer does something cancer like slug all 4 before hooking anyone, moonwalk with legion, or if I actually have to go do something. Other than that I’d rather just get points / be toxic back to the killer if they’re camping
---
Survive with friends.
---
Michael needs a nerf, immediately. ASAP, too powerful, beyond meta, nope,  too broken,  OP
---
sweaty white females
---
SWF = survive with friends, or when survivors queue up with their friends.
---
higher on the street?
---
Ragequitting has nothing to do with servers...
---
Jesus. They said they balanced it so no side would be faster, but based on that Survivor has the potential to be *way* faster than Killer.
---
So accurate. I ran into SWF earlier and it was so boring that I just disconnected. I've only done that one other time, to a different SWF match.
---
Meme was better when I posted it about nurse
---
Hey, Listen!
---
People stopped playing, incredibly unbalanced at decently high level play so that monsters never stood a chance.
---
Also too much of the game was just following tracks, and if you weren't playing the tracker class it was zzz
---
the other day i saw (no pun intended) a pig running insidious 3, dont know what she was trying to do but probably had the why we still here? meme on repeat as background music
---
There’s an exploit that lets people prestige characters for free
---
Play on console. Can confirm it happens constantly. Really bad to where sometimes it feels like your playing on a dream cast 
---
Pm me bro
---
Would you be mad if they gave you the refund?
---
Am I the only one who likes the new music? It feels more intense/more atmospheric.
---
Thanks :)
---
So Mathiew is the one dodging the ban system?
---
Lithe is actually god like on that map.
---
That is most likely to make it harder for people to farm while working with the killer but realistically I doubt it will be as impactful as people seems to make it.
---
I did that before and I got dropped in the corner of the map until I got off due to the 4 drop rule. I was pretty bummed after that. 
---
this sub thinks Dedicated servers are going to magically fix everything. E V E R Y T H I N G
---
How tf did you get the survival points???
---
Are anything being done about the servers? The game crashes every other game I try to load into. It's pretty annoying and it's making me want to stop playing.
---
That's a lotta bullshit.
---
The sacrifice category is just bs iirc
---
is that the prestige exploit I keep hearing about? every time someone explains it gets deleted
---
just hit her you dumbass omfg
---
What exploit?
---
Bhvr at it's finest.
---
Should we tell him? Okay ill tell him. 
---
This game’s community is toxic as fuck.
---
The Doctor is always faster than survivor (except while zapping) so if they keep running, you just chase them till the next loop and zap them there. It's a vicious cycle, but Doc will win them 9 times outta 10.
---
I searched this subreddit just for this 
---
???
---
Wrong thread my dude?
---
Wish it was, but it ain’t
---
Haha hahahah no
---
I would say Jake has the best
---
wait so you cant like jion lobby xd nice one if ya gonna swipe the pigs &gt;:(((i wish i had hair like THAT AHAHA bt  u need ot activate the other KILLERS who called "cereal killers" what have athey killed when i bring offerings hahaha bloody party streamers lolololol maybe next tine dont facecemp 
---
Potential being the key word, yes if you can escape with the vessel then you get a load of points, but you could also get camped or potato team mates can get all the vessels destroyed.
---
pm me too
---
Must be hard to kill someone when they're exposed and you have a free mori.
---
Yah since The devs have to Bow down to Sony &amp; Microsoft and won’t ban people for lag switching or other exploits! I’ve heard them say they can’t and also heard other streamers saying they can’t ban people on consoles. 
---
Dope
---
also wh yu be meen and wrte stuff on my P R O FILE  i dont get so many two comments XD listen if u want i take the otherside to the convention an we get the codes ya
---
You mean the loadscreen bug or any kind of disconnects?
---
I had the infinite loading screen of death far before thee. For I had a shitty laptop, terrible connection, and the lack of cntrl shift esc. Making it closer to a tier, possibly a+
---
Cursed video 
---
listhen DUJMMY is u going to crtizize him a tleast hae a point see like me ihave the chocken
---
Killer favoured game which hasn't fixed DC issue for years. And now they need to fix it because of cosmetics I guess?
---
I saw that post, we could all see the names it's too late now I'm going to tell those people you put them in your Reddit post without their permission 
---
It's related,  but not the same. 
---
No myttens, amirite?
---
Regular disconnects, in game.
---
Wait now people hate doc too :( he’s my favorite to use
---
Photoshop
---
Yes, because I also put time and effort into leveling Legion up--no one can refund time.
---
oh my God, it's been a long time since I laughed at something this hard.
---
You wish. No there's literally no reward from the devotion system. It sucks it was such a great opportunity for them to create exclusive skins that you get from reaching certain degotions
---
Maybe some kind of witch doctor shit
---
Stop saying things about the clothing, OP said Anime version that's all it is
---
Yo dude how do I get free prestige on dbd? Does it work for pc? Thanks love from brasil 
---
I can relate
---
Legion with cold dirt and the green CD add on bamboozle, thanataphobia, sloppy butcher and whatever for the last perk for adept my first time just because of the add ons you can catch up and cancel out way too quickly
---
As a Myers main, I second that scratched mirror on lery's is *the* most fun I've ever had in this game. It's so OP it's almost stupid
---
Shaggy would be op as a survivor, he’s fast as fuck 
---
No, you're fucking stupid. It's always about bm. Either you leave so the killer can move on more quickly, or you stay and make them want to kill themselves. No other options.
---
Hmmm, these are all colors which are typically depicted in paintings. Paintings are done by artists. Some people consider filmmakers to be artists. Wes Craven was a film maker. WEST CRAVEN DIRECTED A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET! Freddy rework confirmed 😎
---
I don't think it would be useful because your either able to see them since your in a chase and not need it unless they have dance with me(which would be a direct counter to that perk). Otherwise your not in a Chase with them and it doesn't activate. 
---
I'm so sorry he behaved that way. Please don't let it get to you, you sound like you're doing an awesome job, and you'll only get better with time :)
---
You'll experience a lot of salt. Try your best to not let it effect you. I have to remind myself everyday of how fun I thought this game was before I got so jaded
---
It's a free animation software called Source Filmmaker, or SFM. It was created by Valve to make their cinematic Team Fortress 2 trailers. It's pretty easy to get the models for it too.
---
I hope they never do that. What a waste of effort thatd be.
---
ahahaha!!! he's so cute omg
---
Lol well done how long it take you?
---
Event isn't out yet. Nothing to look back on, no valid groans to listen to.
---
well, whatever happened, your game profile got bugged, and now your a level 1, rank 20 with (probably) all cosmetics and p3 level 50 killers.
---
since you cant get into a game, your either banned or the game is having a stroke. have you tried restarting? if it doesnt work, contact behaviour (game dev's) support.
---
Depends. Ive had every killer at lvl 40 aside from my mains for months, but ive only been doing this since right before legion came out
---
Yes but it will not work on the B's crows on the 2 main buildings on the swamp map those fuckers be snitching

To be fair, he was pretty much dead anyway unless he got that trap off.  He was on the last bit of the timer, and it may have been his last box.
---
There is. Burn an offering, do an event objective, get bonus BP.
---
Well now it'll be much more often when the killers finally get to experience when their internet connection is shit instead of blaming us.
---
I play on Xbox and also have this issue. Do survivors still hear it? Can I insidious with chainsaw rev’d? 
---
Ah, a classic. Just call the other person an x main. Why is it everytime i defend killers in an argument i get called a killer main and everytime i defend survivors i get called a survivor main?
---
Thank you c:
---
The totem spawn struggle is real
---
I still have more to upload if you're interested
---
You get BP for buying the offering and doing event objectives. You can get more BP this way than from a multiplier, so why is that an issue?
---
when you bring tampered timer and ruleset No2 and it kills a survivor
---
I expect every billy to run Tinkerer.
---
He has the speed to react to it in time, and others give themselves away usually.
---
run piggy run!
---
I literally gave another reason in my first comment, giving free points, which plenty of survivors do. I'm not pretending.
---
Yup, it's definitely a bug, I've swf'ed with someone it's happened to multiple times.  Their game can either crash and it doesn't DC them (at least visually), or they can still show as alive/injured/slugged but have been technically sacrificed.
---
Tells an ignored community not to do something or we will ban you.
---
Anonymous: bring it on 
---
and you see them at the end of the game
---
When you break into a sprint, for 1 second you stay in place.  After that, you have 300% move speed for 15 seconds.
---
Usually the first few matches skill checks are choppy, but then they go back to 60 fps. Not sure why, it just do.
---
Double BP would be less points than the event objectives can give, so why is this an issue?
---
Killer: you activated my trap card
---
Flip: when ruin is cleansed locate the survivor and face camp
---
Why?  Because they're the obsession?  Rancor MAKES them the obsession, not DS.
---
Hit me up if you're looking for a bit more collaboration, I have used SFM for a few years, so I feel like I know a lot of the ins and outs.

I just lack the ability to make realisitic animations and I don't really do sound as much.

And when I'm done, I'm gonna "Kill Bills".

I'd love to, the only problem so far I'm having is figuring out how to make them walk without it looking dumb, I literally started the other night and started with the basics by posing them for photos, hoping YouTube or something could help me out with it. Added you, I'm the "mori me daddy" going to bed atm so if you send me a message and I don't reply I've scuttled off to bed
---
Oof I thought each devotion was a small XP boost. Do you have to prestige to continue collecting shards?
---
Or running perks to get other survivors killed. :\
---
And I know it's my time to go.
---
The killer must've been farming
---
Oh god, not the scariest, it's when you try move the whole person when you're in the edit thing mode and it turns into some spider swirly monstrous thing 😂😂😂
---
scratched mirror on haddenfield is also good, lots of angles to approach survivors stealthily, probably not the best map for it though, but hey its THEMED!
---
Hacking, the tbagging and not running is bo coincidence.

You can accidentally create great things that way.

Tbh, these discussions about new killers being OP literally less than a week after release are getting old. Instead of children crying over how they don't know how to survive a new killer, why don't they ask for tips? (Clearly the OP isn't smart enough to understand that)
---
Oh jesus
---
Can't you turn it off? Like shut the power supply?
---
Awesome, will have to be in like 11 hours though 😂 I still need sleep it's 6am and I'm a self destructive hermit, drop me a message though so I don't start talking crap to some randomer thinking it's you 😂
---
I'm not an expert player myself so I make it a point to judge anyone that doesn't play that well during a match. Its supposed to be fun, not stressful. 
---
Running from the killer is toxic
---
After the patch I've never been sent to haddonfield, I guess is time to burn those keys and find out what ppl are talking about
---
Bringing items into a match is toxic
---
Diversion, pebble is life.
---
you spelled piggy wrong
---
Having perks on survivor is toxic. Running from the killer is toxic. Don't you know you're supposed to surrender yourself to the killer?
---
he's also a fragile boi who needs to mind these delicate bones 
---
Having perks is toxic
---
Not that much of a point to even ask something like this to be honest. 98% of the players answering will just tell you the exact same tryhard meta perks while the other 2% will actually tell you about the fun stuff.
---
And I the only one who doesn't hate playing against Doc? At this point i'd rather see Doc than billy, spirit, or legion again and again
---
Alert, dead hard, ds, spine chill usually
---
1: when I play killer I appreciate survivors standing at the exit gate so I can get more points/ screw around with them if they’re nice and it gives me the chance to get more points as well 
---
2: even if I was doing it to be “toxic” I would feel justified considering she taunted me literally in this video but sure I’m the toxic one lol 
---
who does that? decent freddy players
---
my favourite is BT, We'll Make It, Botany Knowledge. and one perk is always changing cause it's pretty much a free spot. 
---
it's a thing in my head, I don't think I deserve the altruism points if I was not able to provide fast healing or land some time for them to escape the camping killer. 
---
Saving survivors from hooks is super toxic.. (vomits)
---
but I also enjoy the No Mither, Urban Evasion, Resilience, Iron Will. but then I just focus on gens and totems. 
---
Haha!
---
Easy bloodpoints denied!
---
Looping should never be impossible. It’s the only way for survivors to outskill a killer. Otherwise they just run in a straight line till they get downed. But, then again, this is Legion we’re talking about so I really shouldn’t be talking about skill 
---
Spine chill is my favourite perk I love it lol 
---
Thanks! 
---
seems to be a bug where the same ones keep showing up. they claim to have fixed it before but I don't think so.
---
im guessing they then blamed the killer?
---
*unpopular opinion* it's my essential perk.
---
Autodidact. Usually i don’t get use this perk in game but when I do it works like a dream. 
---
We have a winner boys!
---
They load in for you faster than they load in themselves, it wouldn't work out. And even so some dude with a lag switch could hand pick who they want in their game so they can't get caught using it in game.
---
They don’t care about the truth 
---
Aye I wanted BBQ and Franklins so it was well worth the $3
---
Who was the killer tho
---
maybe they didn't pay attention or were distracted, or were convinced the killer was coming for them - or maybe they didn't feel like they could get the save properly. most of the people don't do it on purpose or to frustrate you personally, however I do hope you don't experience that too much :) I once tried to save someone last minute but it didn't work out and the killer got them right before we reached the exit, and I was yelled at post game chat for what a stupid save attempt that was - everything you do might be heavily miscalculated or turning out to be an unfortunate strategy. 
---
the problem is we need to buff legion
---
My clown bloodweb is broken, I get one about every four refreshes. This is why I will never prestige.

So not getting caught makes her kill her friends. I understand now. I take borrowed time so I can hide and save people though if that helps.
---
The addons only affect the Perks?
---
MistressOfDeath is my username yes?
---
Just get 1m bp then spend it all

True, solo que is beyond boring. Can only play one solo que game but can play SWF for hours

Welcome to Dead by daylight. They need to stop showing/or alluding to offerings from the other team...period. Both ways.

If you listen he's still screaming till this day.
---
im not a hacker, idk what you mean. dont make assumptions like that dude
---
You know you could just use the rectangle tool thing and just completely cover them.
---
If you're SEA then I'm Knoblin
---
Would change nothing.
---
uhh no????? i dunno why everybody here thinks am hacking LOL you're all being mean
---
They are all true
---
There’s no way you have 50 hours in the game and just started last month yet have a FULL LEGACY nurse. Only people who started playing about 2 years ago have Legacy and had to go through a long ass grind for it. 
---
AAAAH BOOLI KNOB!!!!  
---
It's not the only window.  There's one on an outer fence (white fence) that I couldn't get through.  I was so frustrated I kept trying while the clueless nurse just smacked me and carried me to hook.  Try it sometime... The outer white fence at one end of Haddonfield near the jungle gym bars.
---
It's a known bug, should be a fix in the patch next week.
---
Pretty much, there's always been a -10% efficiency per additional person on the gen. All the devs did was give us a visual cue.
---
&gt;Amanda's Letter
---
Pretty much.
---
He got me good. I didn't realize the hand gesture was the joke so I tried going to the subreddit hoping to find something. 
---
You're the one sounding offended at them unhooking in front off a Freddy.
---
Run Iron Maiden. 
---
You partially explained how to use the exploit, which enables others to break the EULA (we do not assume that this was your intention, though). 
---
The removal of such comments is a precautionary measure for all parties involved based on experiences in the past. 
---
Yeah like you said it usually happens to prevent spamming of the drop button
---
Holding w is toxic
---
Please bestow the knowledge of this exploit on to me
---
I like blind spot but it might be pushing it at 1 min. The camo thing is just no we already have claudette and dont need her to be an actual ninja. And the longer pallet stun is no good because looping. Nice try tho!
---
An education... please inform me which college you went to so I can put it on the list as one of the worst education anyone can get (also anyone that tries to use a fallacy as an argument is already a dumb person). Kiddo there is no such thing as a high ping killer, he can have a bad connection and make other people have high ping then do you know what you can do? Back the fuck off the lobby, or not complain. You were warned before the game that it would be laggy af. Latency is the time it takes for the information to reach the host, since the host and the killer is the same machine the latency is virtually 0, there is no such thing as a high ping killer. You are the one with high ping regardless of who's fault it is.
---
This sup went under when legion was released.
---
Why/how are your perks colored? If you know the answer, please tell if it's possible on consoles as well.
---
Nice ideas. I wonder why people who get paid for coming up with ideas never came up with something more creative than what we have..
---
my friend made it, I'll tell him...
---
Thank you someone with an actual brain
---
No we dont.
---
Console? You can switch characters with the shoulder buttons on console now, maybe you're pressing them on accident?
---
Use: iron maiden! and for survivors cleanse all totems or Deal with noed!
---
You can only juggle someone by dropping about 4 times, after that, dropping them again would trigger a killer grasp escape for the survivor
---
My ears were bleeding after hearing Haddonfield's music
---
Studying? Never heard of her.
---
Only 1.4k hours since launch?? I have 1385 hours and I've had dbd since September 2017
---
The fact that they're shitting their pants about a literally useless prestige exploit instead of shitting themselves over the game running like shit on console or the sound not working or the textures breaking is fucking ridiculous and shows how unbelievably incompetent  they are.
---
"OH NO THEY"RE EXPLOITING TO GET TO P3!!!!!"
---
"Sir, shouldn't we be working on Freddy or ..."
---
"NO THIS IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE GAME! FIX IT NOW!"
---
"Sir, what about-"
---
"NOW, GOD DAMN IT!"
---
I can tell. ;)
---
Because that's the goal of the game of course. To make people angry and disconnect. Or have you ever NOT laughed or had fun because your opponent disconnected? So many people do that and there are so many videos about it that statistically it must be that most people play this game for the schadenfreude.
---
Did I understand it right that killers can only destroy vessels when they hooked someone who **is carrying** a vessel, meaning it would be best for survivors to only pick them up at endgame? Or does the killer get to destroy one after **every** hook? 
---
Video not available for me here. Dunno why.
---
A legacy hillbilly did that to me yesterday 
---
If you run iron maiden I guarantee you the first time they hide in a locker will be the last time 
---
yep comes from the map funny thing is the killer can see it also 
---
The trial/chapter is from a killer I Made previously and posted on reddit.
---
I'm a killer main and I think that is a great change, it gives counter play to some possible frustrating perks. They're still powerful and the survivor has to time it correctly or they will be shown entering the locker. Maybe for addons/killers powers it shouldn't protect aura but all those perks? Sure, protect the survivor who actually uses their mind instead of mindlessly rushing gens and doing loops.
---
Perfectly describes ds haha. Gj op
---
It's not 2 x 4 for the gens. It's 5 x 4. Any/every gen gives points, there are no specific hooks or gens you have to use.
---
Disagree. There are games made by 2 people which runs smother than dbd
---
Ditto.
---
Boohoo
---
&gt; macro to turn 180 degrees 
---
as opposed to simply turning the mouse? and what if they don't vault back? what a dumb comment, but I agree with the original sentiment that the extra vault distance is pointless
---
Nice I envy your extra free time, low key kinda jelly. 
---
I meant the part about fixing any bugs that helps the players asap. 
---
I went towards one just as I got downed, except Freddy's stupid range/DBDs stupid hit box got me. I'm not a great looper though, I prefer to juke and hide to confuse them.
---
ngl, that is scary to look at with that head.
---
Wow. Are you comparing a DS to a Mori? Awesome 
---
well according to a lot of the above people, this juke is way easier on console...
---
Killer main here, I think it is a good change. Gives a sense of counterplay to aura perks beyond just "run distortion and deal with the fact that you have limited stacks". I like there to be purely baseline ways to counter perks. Granted BBQ already had a variety of strategies worked out to counter it but that is only because it is evergreen in meta so survivors were forced to assume a killer always has it.
---
if that is true (Not fully explained yet) then why are they reintroducing the event offers?
---
the whole game should be fixed tbf
---
All of those are pretty unbalanced.  
---
1. Blind spot is just stupidly powerful. The way its worded means the killer can't even see strach marks from someone on the other side of the map, if it was you leave no scratch marks maybe, just maybe it could be balanced (and 1 minute is just insane, it would be more like 5-8 seconds depending on the rank). 
---
2. Bush camper is just useless on maps that have no bush, it would be really hard to code it and making them completely invisible? Not even the invisible killer is completely invisible, if its just a better blend in then its ever harder to code since it will require some sort of color change to the survivor.
---
3. That would completely break the game making some loops last the entire game, no exaggeration here, it could literally make some loops last the entire game, also no one needs a buff to loops they're at a good spot for once in the game except the odd case here and there.
---
The concepts are all cool but completely nonviable in my opinion.
---
Mine changes character on its own too! (on PS4) 
---
I’m claudette so I must cleanse the totem next to where I was just unhooked 
---
Doc isn't over powered, he's annoying. There is a difference. 
---
tfw you can hear this image
---
Vanity mirrors are ass, it’s the scratched mirrors you want to horde
---
It’s only in 2018 gamer.
---
This post makes so much sense that it must be true.
---
There would be no incentive to go for multiple hits. Legion would hit you once and then walk behind you waiting for you to go down with no way to stop it. When the bar goes down only outside of a chase it is already virtually impossible to escape so long as legion just follows the blood and scratchmarks without directly looking at you to initiate a chase. Your suggestion makes it so legion doesn't even have to do a fake chase to make you go down, they can just follow you normally.
---
I play killer when playing with survivors ticks me. That or I start working for the killer when they sandbag me. 
---
whats a gamemode and how do you find it in settings, what would it be called
---
i’m pretty sure most of his upvotes are people who also stay to give the killer a final hit or know someone who has. Not everyone is a bad sport.
---
*Deliverance Intensifies*
---
Survivor main here. 
---
Just posting because you told me not to, dick. 
---
Half of those should let you see the survivors go into the locker and then get an easy locker grab. You can't just spend all game in a locker vs Michael.
---
no, no. not op. it's good for camping and sneaking up but nothing too much, she still needs to get you. facing skilled players she rarely has a chance. not many Pigs use it on red ranks.
---
the Wraith before the rework had same add-on. All Seeing used to give you wallhack. that was bit annoying on Game but overall also not op. 
---
No not really. But honestly you could have went without saying that last part after all both sides cry OP all the time 
---
The Killer cannot see it. 
---
I really don't understand why that is...He kinda sucks, all he has is the shock that's unreliable at stopping loops.
---
And you might have to do 3-4 skillchecks to get out of madness.
---
How is that aids to play vs, when things like legion, nurse, billy, spirit are in the game?
---
That’s basically what he replied. 
---
maybe, waiting for you to unhook first makes me think they weren’t that green but who knows...
---
DS users deserve moris, moring a DS user is the killer balancing the game themselves, because DS users get a free extra chase. sorry not sorry, its always a good idea to bring a green mori for DS users
---
so wait you don't have the Leather face DLC?
---
get the heck outta here. it's a civilized discussion between big boi killers.
---
I get that it’s not fair for people who grinded to P3 50 legit, but there’s seriously way more concerning issues the game has than an exploit to get free prestige that offers no real gameplay advantage, besides Claudette’s prestige outfit. 
---
you will see this around the 10+ ranks mostly.  some occasions you will run into em in lower ranks when nearing rank reset.
---
the general idea is to derank back to whatever they were sent after reset so they can get closer to 20 and have easy games
---
I have it as unlisted in youtube, that should work right? Ill have a look.
---
By default, you have 7 SECONDS where he can't hit you.
---
If you can't make it to a pallet or window in 7 seconds, that's a *you* problem.
---
The camera shake is what makes this for me
---
I want to know if survivors dc just before being put on the hook will the killer still get blood points
---
the exploits that let you prestige for free, and another that lets you buy the same item/perk over and over again
---
It says you lose a pip, but if you check your rank afterward, you should still have that pip.
---
Well but killers cry that survivor things are OP so...
---
If we dont play SWF then we get body blocked in a corner or farmed off the hook by other survivors. I understand where youre coming from, but to enjoy the game and not get endlessly trolled, SWF is the only option for some.
---
oof I have nothing like that, only can mess with brightness type settings
---
Thank you 🖤
---
liiiivin in a lonely woooorld
---
the post literally says "console players"
---
as a mixtape?! what on earth are you going to hear!? 
---
well afk idle or swinging will usually lead survivors to come and farm chase points. so 8k standing doing nothing more if you have it "swinging" 
---
also doing this gives you about 300-500 xp per round if survivors find you making farming shards possible 
---
The screams of pleasure and moans of acceptance?
---
"""""rng"""""
---
lol
---
Check in advanced settings if you have the option. Something might be there. 
---
Uh, definitely a no. Iridescent head makes journal look useless 
---
odd it does for me  when playing killer (ps4) 
---
School girl spirit uwu
---
You hear that? Sounds like a distant "Darn"
---
yeah its literally the entire point of the perk
---
I laughed at that shit for like 15 minutes straight so this deserves more than silver
---
Piggy and nurse
---
:D yup, ty haha
---
a legit buff I have in mind is to make your movement speed faster every time a gen is complete, killers seriously lack any viable movement speed perks (noed doesn't count)
---
Zoom in on the 32ks, they look like they were copy/pasted from another scoreboard.
---
if you drop them after awhile &amp; they wiggled to about 75% it counts as a killer grasp escape. dropping 4x consecutively will also do this. 
---
yeah real = hex totem
---
If it  wasn't for dbd this would be a weird fetish video 😥
---
What comes after Haddonfield, I wonder?
---
My guess is Kate's PTB voice actor.
---
Not a bad idea but the wait time alone and making a whole new menu for it. Devs will fucking have crippling depression at the thought of ....more
---
it seems so, yeah. like I play both of these a lot, in fact I'm a Freddy main, and I know how to properly juke and outmindgame both. or how to break a chase and hide. I know that to lower your madness you just need to crouch or go in a locker outside of static field. it's really not hard and not annoying to survive them, I actually love playing against those. and with that I also played Legion a considerable amount of time and I see that I win every chase cause they's literally no counterplay. I get 3k perkless and add-onless with Legion. easier than with Spirit or Doctor in particular. Doctor with no perks is an easy win for survivors tbh. easier than Fred.
---
so I seriously can't understand what's wrong with people thinking there's anything wrong with Doctor. I get it might be uncomfy on consoles due to frames but come on he is still very much loopable. he's like mid-tier. cheesus.
---
im against dream transition being made faster, because it nerfs class photo, one of freddies strongest addons
---
Waluigi hentai sounds, idk i guess one would be edgy like let the bodies hit the floor "buy my mixtape fam" - legion
---
Nah he has vhs porn hes old school
---
Doctor isn't overpowered just extremely annoying 
---
Not sure if susies hoodie saying 1996 on the back confirms thats the year they from but if thats the case it narrows it down a bit
---
They get a free extra health state/half chase. Nothing more. I hate DS as killer because it's annoying as fuck, but let's not pretend that it's worse than it is. 
---
there's no wallhack after rework. they changed it to "seeing the gen progression"
---
You have a lot of fucking patience  
---
Play the spoons on the street with a coffee cup in front of you and you'll earn enough to buy leatherface 
---
Bill could beat up Amanda and the Legion so easily
---
Tbh this is still pretty bad
---
But that exactly what you do to piss of tombstone Myers. You toxic.
---
This really fits the name and it would be a Bitter Murmur-esque change, but I would change it to a flat amount of time.
---
I was expecting it to just stop her loud ass breathing but that looks like an alright add on
---
Lol if you run ds your getting slugged 
---
Technician, urban evasion, stake out, lithe
---
I like to play the sneaky Gen repairer with lithe as a backup plan
---
I think that at least 1 person should escape per match otherwise why would survivors play? A good killer can get lucky and get 4 kills but there are more people trying to leave than an individual person trying to stop them. The hatch exist so people still play the damn game. 
---
did she not just simply know that if she left you would have just ran for the hatch and got there in time?
---
The last couple days I've gotten a bunch of random ass locker catches with doc, maybe they buffed it secretly
---
Hah jokes one you i don't bother with ruin i just play legion and soak up the tasty dc's
---
the devs hate actually making new things
---
hahahahaha
---
*what a story - mark- kraivo
---
freddy mains rise up, you're probably right
---
Or if you try to buy something and don't have enough, it'll stay zero while you hold it
---
"Teenagers" by My Chemical Romance, one would expect. These days those teenagers they sure scare the shit out of me.

---
I only play killer for dailies, and can say from experience that I've always had 3+ kill games as the huntress (about 4-5 times), and I haven't got her to level 2. I just continue to use the starting perk.
---
I'm not sure you understand what a fallacy is, w/e I'm not here to bully a little kid but if you keep that attitude you're not getting far in life, going to a college doesn't make your arguments and explanation any more important than anyone's else (even though I highly doubt you have a degree since you're most likely 12yrs old). I already explained why your arguments make no sense and all you can do is repeat the same old bs (and try to insult, typical of someone who is insecure about their knowledge). Also yeah my english is not perfect at all, its not my first language but even then I can make arguments better than you so...
---
Noice! ;)
---
**F I N G E R G U N S**
---
That's sadly true :/
---
+33% progression on wiggle every time you drop them
---
Implying DS actually matters against decent killers lul, almost all the survs who use it are mechanically weak players who unironically think a second chance perk is gonna change the game while in reality it's literally a wasted perk slot (unless it's a well organized 4 man swf where there's 2-3 people running it which actually breaks the game).
---
deserves more upvotes
---
I saw, but thanks for posting it again
---
Or maybe it's not blaming anyone but just describing what the survivors are doing. I guess some people think that instead of condensing it to "genrushing" they should say "the survivors are now giving their full and undivided attention on completing the objectives, ignoring all else, which enable them to achieve the primary objective of the game, which is powering up the exit gates which allow them to escape after they have been opened"
---
You could get the exposed with no mori, or the mori with no exposed. That sounds more balanced to me. Remember that Rancor isn't a hex perk so it can't be cancelled. 
---
I love how you just fucking drew it on a sheet of paper then took a photo
---
*sigh* “Well at least she hit the che...”
---
***BOOM*** *sounds of sprinting away from generator*
---
“*GOD DAMN IT MEG!”
---
Yea I wish that too
---
*Insert drake and josh "megan" glare meme here*
---
They get to hide behind the generic mod throwaway too so we can't  pinpoint which mod is responsible. 90% of the mods are inactive for months but the 2-3 that are active are usually pretty cool.
---
rancor big lame
---
Seeing how many points actually escaping gives, I expect to be gen rushed even more now..
---
Did you mod your game to get those images there?
---
Every time you drop a survivor it adds 25% to the wiggle meter
---
Entity seems you unworthy.
---
Well if you want to be specific sure. My point is only more proven if it can be put on other killers. The slowest two killers in the game have a blink/teleport so they don't need that perk. The wrathe gets movent speed from his invisibility and comming out of it. The clown has a slow he can use multiple times. Meyers has two movement speed and dash buffs with evil 2 and 3. Just saying, killers don't need to be faster. 
---
Nothing new. Just a gay survivor main gloating.
---
It’s free karma, why would they? /s
---
im so happy you didnt get any down your shirt.
---
with that line of thinking no one needs perks at all
---
No meg would ever do that, that’s a Claudette thing to do. Demon Claudette 
---
Ok fair enough
---
Lol i cant believe something like this made it past testing
---
When you don't think bisexuality is a possibility. It always is. 
---
At least one of those claudette images definitely shows gens still
---
who hurt you
---
Oh
---
Do they have to break into my house and piss on me while I'm sleeping before I'm allowed to stop stroking their egos?
---
this is amazing
---
No one in the game disconnected
---
**I'M GONNA STEP ON THE GAS**
---
It doesn’t matter
---
what do you mean?
---
Hatch definitelly isn't bad and i say that as not a survivor nor a killer main. I play both and well... its good because while playing alone you often play with stupid teammates that die fast as fuck boy. When you are alone you most likely won't do the last gen because killer can track 3 of them one after another, kicking them with Overcharge... you will either die or make the game last extra 30 minutes.
---
haha my bad
---
but why?
---
You could see freddy during the transition tho
---
You forgot to mention that you can't counter his greatest asset: the flexing
---
How did you know they had no key? There are chests around the map and the key is consumed upon opening the hatch so it wouldn't tell you they had one post match
---
But why do they get used before the game even starts...
---
What if it was done unintentionally
---
You drop the items when you die, At least on the hook (dont know how it is if you get moried) 
---
It literally means you get blood lust faster.
---
Nurses are not going to really be relying on bloodlust unless they're babies because blinking is just infinitely better, there are very few cases where a good or god tier would rather not blink and most of those cases the survivor is close enough so they normally can get the hit off without using bloodlust. As for babies, baby nurses are literally the easiest killer in the game to survive against if them getting bloodlust quicker is so overpowered then I seriously question your skills as a survivor.
---
Once again you get bloodlust faster so I don't really think you know what you're talking about considering Wraith can't get bloodlust whilst he's cloaked so his speed boost coming out of it is irrelevant.
---
I think you're starting to see a pattern here but you don't know what you're talking about when it comes to Myers' two different movement speeds Why because in tier 1 ( his first movement speed) not only do you move slow but you also can't get bloodlust.
---
It's sad to say but you are literally the definition of a survivor who whines about something being overpowered without knowing what the hell they're talking about.
---
Well this is an asymmetrical multiplayer game with a fanbase that is constantly hostile towards the devs for no good reason apart from entitlement. You can’t compare that to some college students shitty indie survival game that requires no balance
---
It sucks for you, but it wasn’t a bad choice. They figured it would turn a 1K into a 4K. Most survivors don’t run BT, so they decided escaping was the better option. Sometimes, I even see no Adrenaline. 
---
In the post I said I was standing right next to the hatch and literally watched it open, no one opened it. 
---
OH, it says altruistic. I first read "I'm Claudette so I must be autistic"
---
I think i got the vid working mate
---
When I saw it, I was 100% expecting Kate's old voice to be somewhere at the end.
---
plenty of people ie streams tyde time ardetha bricky hybridpanda Demi they all hate the hatch a lot just want to get rid of it make end game more interesting no waiting around for 30 minutes 
---
Play Hag. Camp the basement AND go chasing after the other survivors.
---
Regardless of the D/C's the game was well and truly over, and to be honest i dont blame the 2nd or 3rd from disconnecting.
---
Didn't see the /s the first time haha
---
He’s not saying it’s toxic. He’s just mad you kept getting away from his slow ass. 
---
Clearly you are obsessed with the game and my opinions have upset you. I'm sorry you have to send huge papragraphs to reply.
---
WAH WAH WAAAAAAAAH
---
That just made me LOL woke my dog up from napping shes not happy.
---
Cough
---
I have had Rancor applied on me while I never run a single obsession perk...
---
Same. On PC it takes me an average of 5 minutes to find a match as killer
---
Dedicated servers will actually fix many problems with the game. One of the biggest problems for me is the Huntress hatchet hit detection. Because currently killer hosts the game so hit detection is done on killers end. This means the latency between killer and survivor plays huge role in knowing where and when the killer is throwing the hatchet and if the hatchet will hit the survivor before turning a corner. Sometimes the latency can be 300-500 ms.
---
I love your edits they're entertaining. I learned a few things from you to make videos less boring. Do you have a youtube?
---
Removing it would only really hurt the already weak side of the game (Solo Survivors), which can't really be blamed by others performance. At least on SWF if you guys didn't manage to get the gens then its your own group fault. Its not more interesting having a solo player try to do 3 gens solo, if he really tries it will be waiting around for 30 minutes until eventually he loses his patience and decides to risk doing one and gets caught. Yeah the hatch is awful, just removing it is no solution...
---
Oh snap, that sassy come back, you definitely put me in my place.
---
How?
---
White ward or the key add-on that lets you keep it when you die 
---
Oof. Like I had intention to argue with you in the first place buddy. 
---
it\`s simple. 
---
1. select a LV50 survivor or killer.
---
2. push the prestige button and just the right timing( when then prestige warning messege shows), push L2 or R2 and change the character.
---
3. the character you changed, will be able to prestige eventhough the character\`s level is not 50.
---
Camping is a complex question. Is camping really ever justified? How many generators are left? Is everyone else wounded? Is the survivor like, five seconds away from summoning the entity, and you're in the same area? Is the last generator done? Is the gate open and you haven't managed to hook anyone else all game? Was the survivor using a flashlight? Did the survivor pallet loop you for like, two minutes and start crouching?
---
There are at least 2 variatons of bug when people DC but "stay in game" one of them has them alive on scoreboard and in status panel, the other one removes from status panel but leaves "body" staying in the game, attracting crows and able to be hooked.
---
How did you not tbag??!?!
---
When are they patching it
---
Because they think they deserve a chance to escape, camping is generally looked down upon so they assume this carries forward including endgame. A lot of people also get annoyed that a killer basically loses the match but gets a kill just for sitting by the hook. That or they ran the killer around all game but due to being downed once right at the end they die for it 
---
Where'd you get the models from?
---
I love seeing stats like this.
---
Any guesses why a lot of killers use "NO Perks"? I'd assume it is because a lot of killers only play killer for dailys and use their low-no leveled killers for them.
---
Nicen't
---
I played 3 games with ruin on. In all games the totem was wide in the open, not behind any cover or even in the grass. Hexes are so freaking unbelievably useless most of the time and the times when RNGJesus bestows his good graces on to you they are "meh".
---
In the workshop. Just type dead by daylight in the searchbar
---
Being called toxic for playing Nea, what a familiar feeling.
---
Dude, we get it... chill
---
And no doubt that'd be riddled with bugs as well. *Tries to place a hex totem, gets catapulted across map* This shit still happens sometimes when I'm hooking a survivor.

I good way to get better is watching streams and/or videos. Not so much “how to” vids, just people playing it and try to pick their tricks. I like to watch HybridPanda on YouTube. I’d say start with trapper because his ability is basic (the only thing is to not spend too long setting traps) and you need to learn and get better at finding/downing/hooking survivors. I started with Michael who also is pretty straight forward. 
---
Actually, i play on PC and i have regular FPS drops when i try to hit the survivor, so sometimes they disappear for me as well...that's sad :(
---
But I always find the wraith one isn't too great cos you still give them the warning off the bell. With Pig I was getting the hit every time. I paired it with B and C so tracking after 1 hook was like dominoes falling. 
---
So according to you, killer should just let them escape? I'm if you get downed, then you were bad and fucking deserve to die. get good and dont get downed next time. Why should killer owe anything to survivors. Should you honestly except ' well you played good so here you go you can escape!' or something? Are last standing survivors near the escape tell 'well dear killer you killed most of us so you deserve a perfect win. Come on kill me!'
---
Hm the only issue that might be resemble anything connection related is that post vault hits are VERY inconsistent post update but thats most likely due to the vault changes than any connection issue, who knows... I haven't got any rubber banding that couldn't be explained by me or the guys internet.
---
Life is like a hurricane here in duckberg. Spaceships lasers airplanes...
---
wow this event sucks
---
Ok, but u asked for it
---
There is one that involves buying the same node over and over again... it still consumes BP but you could for example buy the same mori infinite amount of times. I'm not explaining how (not even on PM, don't even try).
---
Myers' dance is far superior, he wins.
---
Agreed, but I don't main either so I see both sides complaining and don't get it. That's why I asked
---
Actually I'm way cooler with in game chests than bringing your own items, chests needs to be searched which makes noise and takes a little bit of time.
---
I've only been around to witness The BBQ event, the Hallowed Blight event and this event. 
---
Honestly, the BBQ event was the best BY FAR. It didn't affect gameplay which was the best part- most other games have separate gamemodes when an event that affects gameplay is held, which is stupid
---
How DARE you play the game? I should have you know, as a killer main, I am personally offended that you play a video game and use it's mechanics to your advantage!
---
You know, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a single Fred mori. 
---
You gotta realize that there's a lot of different opinions from a lot of different people because everyone values things in different ways.
---
Like for the Clown, for example, I am a really huge fan of the Solvent Jug + Flask of Bleach combo, since it robs survivors of their exhaustion perks and also slows them down even further.
---
&gt;Survivor dcs and now 4 other people have the game ruined because they are still locked in
---
Pretty sure most Killers don't give a shit if one person DCs. At least when I play it, I don't care about it enough to consider it a ruined game for me. If 2 or 3 do, then it's probably possible that the Killer wants farm with the last guy(s) to get some more value out of the match instead of ending it with 8k BP for everyone.
---
NOED? More like.. NOPROBLEM. Seriously. Why the heck people complain about NOED? It's one of the biggest clutch things in the game and completely unreliable at that.
---
I. DONT .AGREE. WITH. THEM. Read that sentence 3 times dude, You asked why some survivors moan about you camping after the gates are powered and I answered your question why some do moan.
---
On that note this constant shitting on all survivors like they are all toxic complainers really doesnt help anything, plenty of killers bitch plenty as well lol this entire community complains about everything. Most survivors whove played the game a long time dont care about camping at all, it is what it is, especially after gates are powered, a few might moan a little but accept thats part of the game same as killers moan about DS or a survivor looping an annoying window. Newer survivors do bitch a lot because they see camping as unfair
---
Blackwake. Good, balanced, interesting and entertaining. Made by 2 guys.
---
This is constantly happening to me as well whenever I go into the basement. It's in the patch notes of 2.5, and it's super annoying. 
---
You can always test it the good ol' fashioned way!
---
I'd bet Joey that they won't either. Still, is it really worth the risk?
---
The only way in which you are wrong is that you camp instead of trying to catch the others before they can escape.
---
The fact that you even have to camp in the first place is so that they can't get the rescue.
---
Rather than do that, just slug as many people as you can since they're probably around the hooked bastard anyways.
---
Other than the fact that i disagree with your playstyle, camping one guy when the gates are open is justified i would say
---
I want a red dragon, not everybody has your tastes.

Spirit doesn't like girls, eh?

This happened to me twice today, the survivor got hooked at the beginning and was stuck on the hook for the remainder of the trial. The second time the survivor died early in the game but it showed they were still active.  Also, my survivors have been glitching. While I’m loading them out, they start switching to another survivor. Has any of this happened to you guys ? 
---
Stop being a fucking asshole.  You asked a question and he's answering, chill out
---
Does it only work on console then?
---
If I did I would have been fucked because he was right behind me 
---
CaLm SpIrIt 
---
God damn that's ten times better than mine lol
---
i start laughing so hard when they camp pallets like dumb little babies and then they complain to me that i'm playing like a scumbag
---
You mean, Spirit with Mori deserves a lot of Claudettes? 
---
oh holy heck it's still there
---
I adore this art style. Jake especially looks cool. 
---
Oh god, people will just try to get the hatch everytime to escape with the vessel. 
---
Replace the top panel with Claudettes tbagging for 3 mins hoping the killer sees..
---
Meanwhile the killer ignores them while he hunts for jake
---
wait, there was a scrapped teacher killer you think there might be any similarities
---
Yes
---
Ya it was amazing she threw a hatchet at me lol
---
Would still suck because Freddy needs Survivors to be in dream state to be susceptible to damage.
---
Fuck it, if someone would be so kind I’d like to be pm’d also 
---
Ok I need to ask this, what does Freddy actually do during this mori ? So he slash them in the dream world ? But it doesn’t actually take affect till they wake up again ? Other then the hand through the middle I have no idea what he’s doing back there. 
---
Respecting kobe's shouldn't be a rule, yes it's nice as hell when a Killer does respect it but expecting every Killer to respect it is completely asinine. 
---
OP would very likely get prison time if you were to do that. Why would you want to do that to OP?
---
Please DO NOT pm me for instructions on how to replicate this exploit, i repeat, DO NOT, i will NOT send you an imgur link with the instructions
---
Since when? I ne er saw it appear until it spawned in
---
Holy shit this is probably the best Amanda cosplay I’ve ever seen
---
I just recently got Piggy &amp; was very underwhelmed by her mori...  
---
David main here, can confirm. 
---
Also means your trashing scrubs tho. I'm the same I hate killer it's so boring and toxic. But good survs make pretty dam good perkless low rank killers.
---
Camping doesn't need to be justified. Nor should it.
---
The survivor slowly gets up and looks around. Meanwhile, Freddy is getting closer and is readying the stance. Freddy then jabs claw hand through survivor's chest, what you're seeing in the gif, pulls out, and the survivor falls over. Freddy then takes another step forward, looking at the camera like he knows all your secrets.
---
It’s a hard knock life
---
Played my first match since the update on Haddonfield yesterday, and daaaaamn, that shit is loud!
---

---
Nah, dbd Reddit is just bitchy and entitled like usual.
---
If you know about the item glitch, I’d like to hear about it. I’ve heard about  and seen the prestige glitch, but the item exploit is news to me.
---
That's really pretty
---
Not sure why you are downvoted. Sloppy is meta on wraith and every time I played wraith I had to remind myself to check that sloppy is not equipped.
---
This is amazing.
---
Same for me: I don’t have a specific time to play! :p
---
That’s a good question!
---
How fast is that fúcking clown. Jesus fúcking Christ.
---
People want to have the most fun possible and they expect you to deliver that experience. So when you do something they deem as unfun, you get blasted for it.
---
Fuck 'em. Do what you like.
---
I don't agree with op's whining but I don't agree with your reply either.
---
I love playing fair and the game doesn't favour fair play. if you face non brain-dead survivors and you don't use ruin or noed, you're gonna get shitted on, man. you will hook all at least once and most likely have this one last guy on second stage when gates are opened cause you're good but you didn't want to tunnel when over 3 gens were done so here you are. leaving the hook? fuck no unless I don't care that day. and even with that... sometimes I do leave this hook knowing damn well gates are opened and guy's gonna be saved. and what do I get 90% of the chat messages? ez baby killer git gud. that's unpleasant. when I legit get people trapped several times in a game on red ranks it says something. if I hooked and chose not to go for injured when they unhooked behind my back I'm not a baby I just don't want to tunnel and want everyone to get decent points and fun. yet still I'm either a camper or a baby killer. ok. can't give a damn. will camp every cocky Claudette now, well done survivors. 
---
i always give it to a teammate since they might actually get some use out of it... 
---
This makes me wonder if they fixed Meg having a very noticeable gap between her body and legs with her new shorts.
---
Not sure where irony comes into this.
---
I hate to say it, but get used to it. Great game, shit community. (For the most part)
---
The best thing to do is ignore it and go on about your business. Don’t give them the reaction they want from you. 
---
Pretty sure he was talking about ingame
---
Maybe I am agreeing with you?
---
had to of
---
Honestly me too. But I got some into the nostrils :’( 
---
It's not a teachable on console
---
Thank you :3 
---
*blushes*
---
And then took a screen shot! 
---
Do they have to blow you for you to stop shitting on them?
---
They have made mistakes, true, but they've worked hard to give us a pretty damn good game. 
---
Ok thank you for telling me. :)
---
Saw a clip from N00b3 on exactly the same window. Seems like a bug with that particular tile.
---
Thank you!~ c:
---
Ong that was my first game after patch I was afraid that the entire game was like that
---
What I'm thinking? I think it's a huge disadvantage for killer. I wish every killer camp early-mid when I play survivor. I means easy gens. I remember multipal times that we repair 3+ gens while killer camps for 1 kills. If Killer happy to get 1 kill only and derank, it's his business and his alone
---
When it comes to multiplayer games, these days, not "completely and utterly shit" is something worthy of praise.
---
What does that say about the state of the industry? 
---
Damn.
---
Situations like these are the reason I run borrowed time
---
I mean, does anybody do anything else than going 99% into EW 3 into OS someone ?

yes that's the point. why they feel so entitled is beyond me
---
huh... weird... i saw this yester day mmmmh... Oh i know... ITS A REPOST
---
rip
---
Just for consistency's sake, just like how messing with hooks triggers skill checks, hex totems should also trigger skill checks.
---
To make it so it's not very annoying, maybe dull totems could be cleansed without triggering them.
---
Adrenaline, Borrowed Time on all my builds basically. Then either Balanced or Dead Hard. Then a fourth perk of choice which is often DS
---
REEEEEE NO VAULTING ALLOWED
---
It heavily inflates the already flawed ranked system.
---
Simply unhealthy for the gameplay
---
when the 3 last gens are right next to each other so it's easy for the killer to patrol the gens, making it super difficult to complete the last gen
---
No
---
BHVR doesn't tell, but yeah it has to be somewhere around that. You see way too many DCs these days and it's still going strong. I also tried reaching a cap in the last few days (played some games to depip, then DC, rinse and repeat) to have a percentage of like 20-30%, nothing happened yet. Also it's unclear across what number of games - incase they calculate across ALL games you ever played, that would be ridiciulous. I played thousands of matches without ever having dc'd, so that would net me with a hell lot of dcs before I'd temporarily get banned. 
---
Whatever it is, it's not nearly as strict as they want it to appear by not telling us numbers. 
---
Every time you hit 1M BP you wasted some, I just spend it immediately or when I have over 950K

D... did you read his comment?
---
God damnit Snikk0r
---
Damn that was nice.
---
The Nea in my game tried her hardest to body block as you can see.
---
He face-camped the only guy that died, as soon as he died he went for the other guy on our team, we managed to unhook him and he instantly got out.
---
I was on the complete other side of the map from the exit gate so I had to loop him for a while.
---
I abused that window because he was using the chainsaw and the entity blocked it, nea body blocked but didn't want to get hit so she stopped body-blocking and went straight out.
---
It was my first hook and as soon as I saw the nea going out I was like "fuck it, I'm just gonna yolo" and that happened. (My shitty 360 skills helped out a lot)
---
I had seen the memes, I tought: "it can't be all that bad"
---
Yesterday: *joins Haddonfield match with friend*
---
I now realise it is really that bad, holy damn
---
Technically it’s the entity’s fault. In the lore it’s the entity who drives him mad by whispering in his mind. 
---
The hatchet throws _should_ be based on the Killer's perspective. If not, you'll get a ton of hits just as survivors round a corner but it doesn't register because of lag compensation. If the Killer has enough precision, timing, and prediction to hit the throw on their end, they should be rewarded with its consequences on the Survivor.
---
You should be happy that you hacen't yet experienced the opening music of that map after the patch
---
Good idea. Maybe there should be really hard skill checks on ruins. Even if the spawns are bad, the survivors should have a hard time cleansing it. 
---
If you think simply throwing this game on dedicated servers will fix any of what you listed, I got bad news for you...
---
I don't think it's new music, it's just super loud
---
Guess you're no headphone user, my ears are ruined
---
Same here
---
I thought this when first getting into the game. Hex totems should definitely have skill checks. 
---
Legion's one and only advantage to play is that they rival Doc in terms of BP gen.
---
I can't 360 for the life of me so I'm always pretty impressed when I see somebody else do it, lol. Yours was definitely a nice escape!
---
Haha, I always go for the gen in the middle of the map first, SWF or not, I'll try and make shure that the gen progress is spread out
---
I’m very guilty of doing this now that i know it’s a serious offense I’m going to spread myself out next time, thank you ☺️ 
---
actually vault spamming can be pretty earrape 
---
Wow. I never knew this. I wonder why it's not seen more often? Seems useful.
---
Yes but not by BHVR. Steam has EAC and it can detect when you modify the Game files and auto ban you.
---
lol don't worry about it
---
Had to have, not had to of, there’s nothing cool about improper grammar

unfortunately my 2 remaining brain cells aren't able to comprehend such confusing tactics

Wait untill you play against my pizza delivery dwight group
---
😂
---
Oh sh*t I remember you, I still feel kinda scummy for it, but IDC
---
Genrushing isn’t bad and is exactly what survivors should do, but there’s definitely a point where happens that the killer has to plan for
---
Selfish Whiny Four
---
Little educational comment coming through, since I see this way too often:
---
Always remember: "of" is not a verb. If you think you are hearing an "of" it's just a quickly spoken "have" which can end up sounding very similar.
---
It's: modal verb + have + past participle. 
---
So: "He had to have heard it." "He must have heard it." "He should have heard it". 
---
It's especially frustrating since it is done correctly in the following sentence. 
---
At the ranks I play at, killers don't stay at EW1.
---
You're right, I made a killer DC after 3 pallet stuns in a row.  
---
He gets an insta down by staring at people
---
For a killer to catch a survivor they must capitalize on a mistake being made by a survivor. Being good at the game in terms of killer is being able to take advantage of those mistakes more often, and in a greater variety of ways. But unless you are playing the nurse, it is still entirely reliant on the survivor making the mistake in the first place. Take a pallet loop for example. You can mind game all you want, but until the survivor actually falls for it, it doesn't actually accomplish anything. Against a mind-gaming killer, so long as the survivor continually reads your intention they can keep the loop going basically as long as they want. Blood lust was introduced to prevent this, but all a survivor needs to do to break that is land a pallet stun. Ultimately, even the best killers are at the mercy of the survivors they are playing against. This is what people mean when they say that survivors have the power role in the game. It isn't that the game is necessarily easier for survivors, it is that a killer can only win if the survivors are making mistakes.
---
You have to be in feral frenzy after you apply deep wound on to someone
---
This is a great description of the game.
---
Toxic altruistic kate
---
Sometimes I play like movie Myers and stalk from far away til EW3 and then come hurtling at a player with no remorse and once I run out I go back to stalking from a distance.
---
It's not practical, it's fun though and sometimes players will comment that it's a different kind of play style that they'll enjoy 
---
Sun is shining in the sky...
---
So it only works if someone is in deep wound status? 
---
It is more a question of capability. A survivor can maintain a chase against a killer for as long as they don't make a mistake that the killer is able to take advantage of. Generally it requires 2 mistakes to down someone. As you get better at the game as a survivor, you make less mistakes so the chases take longer and longer, while the time limit that the killer has (the time it takes to finish the 5 gens) gets shorter and shorter.
---
Next week
---
Dont forget the Wraith with sloppy that literally broke the fps for survivors? Took mone then a month for the fix. 
---
LOGIC : 100
---
Ah. There’s been quite a few of those lately, but we all know how BHVR is about banning people breaking rules.
---
I do play survivor uwu, and now that I think about it... DS is like an extra life... AND deliverance, because another survivor doesn't need to "unhook" you from the killers shoulder. wow this perk man.
---
They were usernames, not actual names, so I probably wouldn’t get prison time for it
---
Tbf, the Spirit’s mori is a bit stiff too. The survivor just randomly stands up from the dying state, which is kind of strange.
---
Nah, you’ve unleashed this, no putting it back
---
Healing is toxic and reportable.. 
---
4k'd 4 games at rank 20 🤔 also yes i saw the s 
---
mr aizawa can surly handle one killer
---
Cant argue that. But even so, I've had a lot of killers lately that justify camping by saying that bbq didnt show anyone. 
---
hatch shouldnt open if gates are already open. *gets downvoted*
---
Lol I had a game like this earlier too, the poor meg was doing all the work I felt bad 
---
I play on PlayStation, where BHVR can’t ban people apparently (according to a response to my report on a lagswitcher) where every 10 killers there is usually at least one macro
---
Recent game of mine: me and 1 friend of mine play SWF together (and get matched up with 2 randoms) hex: ruin was active for a very long time. 2 gens did get done in that time. The killer (huntress) randomly walked to a location where my friend was hiding (he was on his last hook) it sounded like there was no reason for the huntress to look over where my friend was hiding, so I went over since I suspected the totem was there and I found and cleaned it. Managed to hide before the huntress could find me. Anyways, 1 person dead and 3 more gens to go. I start working on more gens and my friend who is now spectating tells me how one of the other 2 people was just runnong around a tree over and over again, not doing anything. I got a gen done, managed to stay hidden from the killer (managed to mindgame her since I figuered she had bitter murmur). However, she found the person that wasn't running around a tree, so now I was the only one doing generators, 2 left to go. The person was very good at looping becauss she managed to run the killer around long enough for me to complete 2 gens (the claudette that was running around a tree decided to help me with the last gen right when I was about to complete it) the claudette got cought and killed, Instarted opening the exit gate, but right before it was opened, the killer came and I had to stop if I wanted a chance at survival. I ran and soon the killer stopped following after injuring me and found the survivor that ran her around for half the match. Somehow, even tough the survivor was healthy, they got downed after 10 seconds (probably because she already dropped all pallets in the area). I (still injured) ran to the exit gate while the survivor was brought to the basement (next to the exit gate). I decided not to risk my life since I tought there was no way for me to save her at this point and just left her behined.
---
The end game chat was pretty infuriating to me. The survivor that ran the killer around for half the match told the killer how their teammates were incompetent and that she was playing a 1v1. Really pissed me off. Yes, good job running the killer around for so long, but fuck, who do you think completed 3 of the generators? Who do you think found ruin? It certainly wasn't that claudette running around that tree. You shouldn't even have died there. You were hiding somewhere and the killer was after me, the exit gate was 2 seconds away from being opened, i had bond and made shure not to run the killer in your direction, so how do you think you got cought? There are 2 exit gates on a map and I was the only one who touched one of them. Cut me some slack will you? There was nothing else I could have done for you
---
Because she’ll be too busy tbagging, flashlight clicking or vaulting nearby pallet repeatedly 
---
Ye some rare add ons are a bit overkill alright. I mean if you are a good shot with huntress her insta down hatchets are easy mode. 
---
They are on PC too, albeit a bit less often.
---
Bro this could actually work as a perk if you change aura highlighted for 10 seconds, and exposed for 20? That seems legit fair, considering if by random you mean like 100% random so the chance you spawning in the locker next to the one you just entered would be HILARIOUS but worth it
---
"had to of"
---
Yes, you get the same kind of notification as when someone fails a skillcheck or breaks a hook. With other words, you should be able to imidiately figuer out wich totem is being touched. And the extra second(s) of cleansing time are a lifesaver sometimes
---
Too much korean for a japanese themed character, nice art tho
---
Have you tried cold dirt and joeys mixtape? I swear that shit ends chases so quick
---
I play on console!   (Vomits)
---
[deleted]
---
Balanced is pretty bad anyway. You wont be able to use it every chase and at least sprint burst will refresh when youre not in one and then be activated really easily.
---
That even effected killer's FPS some times. Hell, if enough survivors had it at the same time you could tell where they are by the FPS dip regardless of range. Saw it on Scott Jund's stream while he was in Red Forest
---
My personal problem with autodidact is that I become a token junkie. If I see you across the map wounded I will drop everything and go heal you if you're not in chase. Not a problem with the perk, just my personal experience.
---
Also yes, increase the chances of a skillcheck happening please.
---
Freddy's Mori is based on this one from the reboot (and I believe it was in the OG one too) https://youtu.be/Nd5xweHX2Pc?t=154
---
Just saying though
---
It's a really good idea! :D 
---
(Also we write ds the same! Nice!)
---
There are currently "no servers" the game runs off of peer to peer and makes each killer you face the temporary host.
---
He has to spend so freaking long time to do that and even then it's temporary. By the time MM gets EW3 survivors could've EASILY done 1-3 generators and/or cleared a totem. If instadown is such a great thing, why is Leatherface considered one of the WORST killers in the game?
---
Pretty shure it's less
---
Yey ive had it when i ran into a feng mid chase and i bounced back and left a bit. I think it messed with the killer harder then it did me at the time then i bounced back.
---
Oh wow, Blackwake has changed then. Last time I saw it, it was a 5v5 fps game.
---
You can’t say it’s an asymmetrical because there are loads of weapons btw, that’s like calling COD an asymmetrical because of killstreaks
---
Bond and Botany Knowledge with SC.
---
You’re an unpleasant person, aren’t you? Take the win and go about your life.
---
I've gotten a lot of hours in on this game, so I only play it every now and then. But x2 bloodpoints will usually result in me having a weekend full of DbD.
---
Ohh thank you, they where pretty accurate to film, though I would of wanted Roberts tv “welcome to prime time bitch” even more. 
---
Those are the code names in the files
---
You know that's why there is a no reposts rule idiot. Stop trying to encourage people to break the rules. 
---
The whole "name-seeing" debate is so dumb. What am I gonna do with those names? Message them via steam and say "Ha! You only got 29k points on that reddit post I saw, you suck"? Like we all don't got more important stuff to do? I understand that publicly shaming people is bad - but nobody is being shamed if their damn name is shown 
---
Idk people just pointed it out a lot
---
Yes because this makes any sense
---
Rofl
---
Yeah, it’s a mod.
---
As a survivor main, I agree. Totems should have some difficulty to cleansing them, as they are voodoo curse magic things. It kinda makes sense to be afraid of messing with it inflicting you with some sort of madness while cleansing it, maybe having you scream if you mess up a skillcheck.
---
They could still do it, it's pretty easy... Check the connection between all of the players, are the 4 still connected to the internet? -&gt; yes. That means killer DCed, award escape points.
---
That's been in the game for ages
---
I never said all killers are toxic. Even if only 5% of all killers abuse this it's still ridiculous as one player should not have the power to prevent four other players from progressing.
---
I qm currently keeping track of all killers, their rank, their perks, their addons, their offerings, their kill count and their disconnect count. The count stops at the next big update and I'll be shure to post some of the more interesting findings on reddit (deadliest killer, most disconnects aka. Legion, amount of ebony memento mori offerings, ect.)

idk but i regret it
---
You're cute
---
The hatch isn't visible to survivors (or the killer) until a certain amount of generators is done.
---
However, the aura of the hatch can be revealed using the Rainbow Map. The hatch itself? You won't see that - but you can see the aura.
---
This would be nice. It never gets used anyway
---
That's why I figured he might be high up (voted Nea though, been using UE+BL on my actual build and loving it). Kind of surprised to see him at only 6% right now.
---
You forgot, no mither is the best perk of the game
---

---
The people on this sub are brainlets.
---
No they get progressively more expensive. 100 then 200 then 300, etc.
---
With or without NM? :p
---
This is my flair
---
It's always the Meg doing this though.
---
Yeah, exactly. They're like a second objective.
---
What about the madness lullaby mix of checks if a Killer can get to the hex first and can booby trap it?  Then the surv will be hesitant as to what they'll get when they start cleansing,  ooooh will it be booby trapped or not?!  
---
If normal, not booby trapped, great checks give normal speed, as it is now overall &amp; good gives a slightly slower than now cleanse.
---
Booby Trapped. 
---
Maybe at..
---
-low levels, narrower/harder skill checks.
---
-mid levels, lullaby or madness style, randomly one or the other.
---
-high levels, a mix of lullaby &amp; madness.
---
Yeah I know that much already. Every time anyone says that dedicated servers wouldn't fix something or has nothing to do with certain problem you get downvoted. Look at my comment right above yours for example. Literally stated something obvious but people can't accept it.
---
Cause his insta down sucks
---
Yeah but it more or less explains everything you’ve said
---
But that's a stupid survivors fault for staying.  Only would work on certain killers with small radius.
---
Ahh really, I did only notice it really recently and have been using a unlocked fps for ages now.
---
Oooo ill have to try that
---
it also be like: https://youtu.be/OYirswZQPkc
---
Now all you have to do is imagine shirtless Myers flexing.
---
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
---
Where in the rules does it say "no reposts"? Find it for me.
---
I 100% agree, I have a diary now I write in and log when it happens and the only games I can get it done are Frank's mix tape games (which makes me feel dirty) or if it's a 3 man lobby and I let them farm and escape. 
---
It's so hard even the devs acknowledged its difficult 
---
If you think Survivor has greater power in most generic tiles then you aren't a very great player.
---
Bloodlust was made to counter infinites, not if you mess up mind gaming 20x in a row. There is no more infinites since windows get blocked after 3 Vaults. Honestly, in most scenarios, if you even see anything past bloodlust 1 then you're playing poorly.
---
Watch this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
Look how he ends loops very fast. Killer only becomes hard when the Survivors do gens since you'll just run out of time. The chase has nothing to do with it. (This is why Ruin is a must have. Even if they hit all greats they still do the gen slower because if they hit greats normally they'll get progression. If it spawns far away from you then you should immediately head there. Most of the time when Ruin gets cleansed fast it's the Killers fault)
---
Of course they enjoy it when u don’t catch them and waste your whole EW3 lol
---
Find it yourself cunt
---
No, I want the same information to be displayed on all clients. The way you equalize that is have the registering done at the same place and distributed to all clients preferably at the same latency so that what is happening matches the expectations. Right now the killer could be lagging so hard that what killer sees is a survivor running against a wall and what survivor sees is he has already escaped the killer only to 5 seconds later teleport to the location where killer saw the survivor running against the wall.
---
With dedicated servers you now have adequate equipment required to run the game and distribute information instead of having to rely on some kids 10 year old toaster.
---
I never said dedicated servers will get rid of latency. But what I'm implying is that with dedicated servers all players have (reasonably ideal situation) same latency to the server and can at least expect to be fed the far more correct information because of stability.
---
That is actually one concern with the dedicated servers. Because this game is "balanced" (its not really in balance but thats another topic) based on the information gathered when the killer acts as a host there is a possibility that large balance issues arise with dedicated servers.
---
The key point in my message is that all clients get the SAME information. Right now this is not the case because killer gets instantaneous feedback while survivors are behind 100-500ms latency.
---
RIP 
---
No. I wanted to keep this one. 
---
yes it should be because tbh if you have the last survivor down 99.9 percent of the time you hook them and get the kill anyway so id say for the cherry on top of the 4k to see the mori animation
---
Years*
---
Well then what is your suggestion to balance (Yes this game isn't balanced but you know what I mean) the game around servers? I'm pretty sure the easiest way is to make everything hitwise still killer-sided, other than maybe making hitboxes for skillbased attacks (Billy's chainsaw, huntress hatchet, nurse's lunge after blink maybe that too) which is pretty much negating the entire point and just giving killers wider hitboxes to compensate for the lag that they will be having on their end, ultimately ruining the purpose of dedicated servers (except maybe for the laggiest of killers but this is Behaviour, they could still fuck that up)
---
That's what bbq is for. :)
---
He should just git gud.
---
Plz write a book
---
The whole point of them is a risk reward system that is balancing between sometimes you get lucky sometimes survivors do. Sure people can endure hex ruin (I have never nor have I ever seen someone streamers included make it to 90% without a skillcheck) but it slows the game and does what it is supposed to do. I'm referring to perks like devour hope that will build up and down people are powerful. If the fact that you could lose a perk makes you dc then I think you're relying on your perks too much. They're there to help you not beat the game for you. If you're that concerned start running ruin with haunted grounds or haunted grounds with devour to change it up to down people.
---
You can get mad that you disagree and that's fine everyone can have their own opinion but I dont think hexs are a make or break point of me playing killer or getting a 4k. 
---
Idk what I expected from someone with your name tbh. Tra mate ;)
---
Just break out the Butcher Pete ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcA24RTmnF8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcA24RTmnF8)) and start hackin', and whackin', and smackin'!
---
The best way to play Myers to his fullest is to save your EW3 until you have a massive opportunity to down like 3 or more people with it. (Obv it’s a judgement thing in game so it can be used to amplify the pressure you have over a certain area for a limited amount of time or for other strategic uses.) 99% then pop on the first healthy guy is that tactic for most average Myers players where you have experience and know some cool tech but aren’t a pro or anything. 
---
Seriously though, if you want to up your Michael game then try playing pretty much normally except restrict yourself to only using one EW3, and try and make it so that when you do use it you’re in a position to literally flip the game on its head or end it straight up by downing so many people consecutively. 
---
When you start playing people that will restrict your stalk and pump out gens it’s so much better most of the time to chase someone and hit them twice so that you still have your instadown when the chance arises to get much more value out of it.
---
VERY YES
---
thot 
---
this is an old picture from before Claudette was considered toxic
---
That totem is fine lol wtf are you on about? Not every spawn is going to be godly, I agree it shouldnt spawn in the middle of a field but that spawns fine
---
I felt really bad for the spirit and the huntress , they all had their fucked up origin stories
---
Very Yes^TM
---
I get this issue whenever I join friends. Never ending loading screen. Developers likely have no idea how to fix it if it's been an ongoing issue.
---
Noooooooo, I don't know what you're talking about 
---
Everyone would just use the bloodlust perk then lol it’s too good not to
---
I'm calling bullshit. Both of you obviously knew that wasn't an intended feature.
---
But you're fine. No bans on console.
---
I have a love hate relationship with this tune 
---
Don’t 
---
Read the patch notes, clearly states it is broken still
---
Mm, actually its not the dame template, the original template was taken from an insperational video while this one was made entirly and this is a repost of someone elses work, this guy who reposted it is just looking for some easy karma for a meme that isn't his.
---
In the most recent patch notes it got it's rework. The info of it being bugged came from a dev stream last night.
---
Thanks for labeling the hatch; I can never find it.
---
Because the obsession is NOT affected by remember me, though whenever they are hit (up to 6 times?), It adds like 5 seconds gate opening time for everyone else.
---
It would be good if they had a lower occurrence rate the higher the level of the character. But then again they gotta make the common rarity stay common.
---
Iron will? 
---
And why is that? Because it takes fucking long time to wind up that attack. MM has to spend a minute just staring at a survivor before that becomes a possibility and then it goes away. And after he has done that enough of times, it just becomes not possible. There's actually hard limit how long it can potentially last.
---
Yes.  Bar will show red and opening the gate will be slow.  Let the obsession do it, as they are not affected.
---
Yeah the "NO Perk" datapoint is a bit bloated. Most of the time the killer has it twice or thrice if he hast it at all.
---
And you are right, seems to be on players who just do a daily.

Liking this for FF7!

50/50.  Devs say they preassign boxes, but this does not make sense based on the data.  They just want to sound cool..."we've preassigned a box somewhere out there with a key inside..."
---
Playing agains legion is fucking boring it make this game loading bars simulator. Change my mind
---
myers has it anywhere from 60 seconds to infinitely has addons that allow him to just murder everyone by pressing M1 next to them, his insta down doesn't limit his mobility or turning, and it buffs his lunge and vault/break speed 
---
Even without franks tape he is a fucking snore fest.
---
"And you still don't agree that some hex spawns are COMPLETE TRASH. Which makes you a survivor main."
---
God this statement points so much to you. Oooh you disagree with me which makes you a survivor main. I was civil through this entire chain but have differing opinions doesnt mean "uh uh uh...survivor main" which is just a cop out. I am a long term killer and have drastically less hours as a survivor.
---
Have a good day and good luck with all of your future stuff. I dont really see anything productive moving forward from you after that fumble.
---
Because they must give him ability to add sloopy on frenzy shit 
---
No worries.  This game, in my opinion, should be fun.  Plenty of killers like you that do whatever they can to "win".  You have your priorities, I have mine.  I want to enjoy myself, you want to get sweaty.
---
How is that in any way shape or form a News... anyway I believe that is not recent
---
That was well played, but the Pig could have easily killed you too if she turned around and went to the boxes you were most likely going to run to, instead of picking David up.
---
They could replace these offerings with better ones. Or just push up the bloodpoint gains. Like, 100% for common, 150% for uncommon, 200% for rare. That way, these things are actually useful. I mean, I hoard these shitty offerings because the bloodpoint gains are abysmal and barely worth it.
---
Somebody already posted these links and they got deleted. Please don’t share ways to cheat lol
---
Omg. I literally left F13 because of the rubber band.
---
Yeah that's always fun for some Jumpscare Wraith, but that requires two really rare add-ons. Whereas the Pig only needs one to be able to sneak that first hit. Then the chase it easy cos you follow, get bloodlust, then track while crouched for a second sneak attack. It worked for me really easily but maybe the survivors weren't great, it was rank 8 so thought not. I'm glad the question is out there though, I enjoy these chats.
---
Openly facing a pallet is a horrific spot
---
Join us!
---
Its the same guy posting it over and over. Hes on a mission lol
---
I may outplay the killer without making loops near one pallet for eternity. And it becomes impossible only when you’ve been in Deep Wound for at least 20 secs, which already means you are going to die soon.
---
You may loop while in Deep Wound. You may flashlight/pallet stun while in Clown’s toxic gases. It just requires more skill and I love that fact.
---
It’s just over moderating for the sake of moderating. Plagues Reddit currently. 
---
DO NOT USE THIS BUG!! ok?
---
That’s so annoying omg, what’s he even gaining by posting it here :’))
---
Walked up to someone as wraith and they immediately DC’d yesterday... swear people will dc for no reason as well lol
---
YOU'RE GONNA GET COLD YOUNG LADY
---
Yea boi, welcome to spin shit world 
---
Just to let you know before you leave I'm badass 
---
No idea on what new killer could be coming out but I do know that if they ever release a Mickey Mouse Killer into the game I will switch permanently from a Survivor main to a killer Main. I'd also really like to see a pyramid head killer type would just a really large weapon that move slow but his weapon ranges extremely longer than the other killers
---
Because his face covering your screen gets really annoying after a while. Spirit is aids too because I always think I’m lagging when she does that passive stutter thing 
---
Based on the recent clue that was released which was the flag of Mali in Africa, and how the new killer originates from the oldest time period, people have concluded that the new killer is from folklore in that country. 
---
Some believe the new killer to be a 'Adze'. More or less a vampire that can morph into a firefly. 
---
https://vampireunderworld.com/african-vampires/adze/
---
Seems strange but Mali is the clue that has been given. Any time period before world war 1 is also another clue with the 'oldest killer' in the game.
---
I agree when it comes to playing killer. Fortunately, this bug only affects survivors, and I can tolerate playing survivor at 60fps.
---
When I play killer I change my cap back to 144.
---
It's just in the live patch it's doing great with only half the perk actually working, so when it's fixed I am imagine it'd be pretty insane.
---
As others say it’s opinion based, but there are some that are considered superior. Like Huntress’ iridescent head and Clown’s redhead pinky finger (both instadowns if you can hit your shot.) Plus someone mentioned Thompson mix for hillbilly and the mixtape for legion. 
---
In my experience, BP doesn't really matter to most people if the alternative is ruining someone elses day.
---
Lmao why 144? 60 is pretty much enough. I would understand refusing to play the game under 60 but 144? Why tho
---
After the reset you'll be rank 10. Probably not the worst time to try.
---
thats a yikes from me dawg
---
Not_queen said it was 39% or more of your games on a dev stream a long time ago. Console players cannot be banned as of now by bhvr. The ban has to go through Sony or Microsoft and they don’t care about how many times you DC it seems 
---
Great artwork. Nice to see some of the killers are somewhat sympathetic in their histories too.
---
True. I usually use rank reset to get adept achievements. Maybe it’s time to try for theirs, eh?
---
Interesting take, I was maybe thinking a mummy type of person. 
---
I wouldn't have a problem with this. 
---
It'd make getting those dang Mori Rituals a lot easier.
---
I always measure out what I need so that the waste is negligible. Last time I needed 4,647 so I played a round as Survivor and got 4,721. :)
---
Unless you're a P3 legacy who grinded through the bullshit like my friends did, you have nothing to be upset about. I have P3 on all of my characters already so a bunch of console people skipping the grind doesn't bother me. Either way it doesn't affect the game and will be patched.
---
It isn't worth having a stroke over.
---
The scream at the end is basically built-in bm and I **LOVE** it.
---
Looking at your phone screen when you wake up
---
Just remember. If you think you're good at something, there's always a 5 year old Asian kid who's better than you.
---
Evidence. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omuYi2Vhgjo
---
I think it would be good if you killed all 3 other survivors (so no one escaped). That way it would be a reward for playing well, why also not being game deciding (with the exception being if you couldn't get them to a hook otherwise, which is rare, or if they have ds, but fuck ds, so yeah). It would also mean that Mori dailies suddenly make far more sense and reward you with a nice chunk of bloodpoints if you did play well, instead of you just burning a ebony one

I'm sorry to the OP, but this guy just kinda murdered you with words.

Bbq and Billy :D
---
Are you on ps4?
---
Yeah. I'm probably just going to exclusively play Survivor for this one. I survive enough I should be able to knock this out in around 50-60 games, depending offerings.
---
This game dosen't worth your money anywhere
---
JK join the more than 20 fps club
---
The risk is the fact that it can be destroyed. Killers should be able to hex their own totems. Imagine if D strike decided when you got to use it with a RNG every time you were downed. Or Sprint burtst arbitrarily decided when you got to run fast. Totem spawns are much better than they used to be, but they should never be near pallets or generators. So those are two things survivors are *always actively looking for*.
---
How do you pm in reddit? I want to know but can't figure it out.... :(
---
Dude fo’ real stop posting this, this exploit can get people banned, stop encouraging its use.

Is there even a match where someone dosen't get toxic?

Description: Sometimes, a DC is not shown as a DC. The disconnecter has still the "alive"-icon, but is not in the game anymore. There is also no audio cue or whatever. It confuses the hell out of people. Hatch-Spawn is correct tho.

It’s been around for a bit, it’s a bug that has shut down my ani-killer shack trap many times.

Wraith: "Come here and get moried such as the other ones!"
---
No reward for getting there and it’s a massive sweat fest anyways. I actively make sure to lose some matches here and there by playing killers that are under leveled or that I don’t use just to keep my rank in check because I’ve never had less fun in a video game than a rank 1 killer match
---
What's wrong it it?
---
Do you guys remember that meme "Killer/Survivors can walk please nerf"? We're getting close to that. 
---
Agreed.  
---
Little educational comment coming through, since I see this way too often: 
---
Always remember: Character speech does not need to (and honestly should not) use proper grammar at all times. Natural organic spoken language is not grammatically correct, and correctly reproducing it text is important. When it comes to character speech the occasional use of incorrect grammar is the correct way to write it.
---
People complaining about proper grammar while that's exactly how I talk.
---
I know how it's done,  but thanks for the explanation.  In my region of the US and at rank 1, 70% of the profiles are either private or have their friends hidden. Which is fine by me, I don't dodge unless one of the survivors has multiple VAC/game bans. I will dodge cheaters and a-holes, that much is certain. 
---
He's correcting character speech, which is incorrect. Improper grammar is perfectly correct in character speech because people do not talk in perfect grammar. The 0 is accurate because the comment is inaccurate in the given context.
---
Playing against swf and getting looped for 5 minutes while all the gens are getting done is infuriating change my mind
---
Lets be honest here both sides have things to bitch about 
---
Who ask you?
---
Those loops are ended quickly because of survivor misplays. Playing killer is playing a numbers game. it is taking the action that is most likely to counter what a survivor does. That is why at the high level it often becomes a game of double bluffs where survivors will intentionally make sub optimal decisions to counter a killer trying to read them making the best plays. All of the counters to the generic tiles that they showed there are the best ways to get the maximum chance of hitting a survivor, none of them are guaranteed because it is always reliant on the survivor making the decision that counter-rotates them into you or has them run a loop too many times. In either case, that is the failure of the survivor that put them in your hands, the killer's role was just being in the right position to capitalise on expected behaviour.
---
Character speech, so it's not actually wrong.
---
have you tried getting better at the game?
---
Never heard of a 144 hz monitor?
---
Instead of using block add-ons, try to use range add-ons and the dress add-ons. It's better to sleep them from a distance then run up to them.
---
I spent a good year with Freddy, and I wish you the best of luck too.
---
There is no "planning" for it, a coordinated survive with friends group will have 3 gens done within 90 seconds of the game starting even without toolboxes.
---
There isn't really a 4th perk that helps when it comes to gens, and I usually play solo. So in case I get unhooked or something, but dont get a medkit or everyone else is dead, I can still hide.
---
r/Boneappletea
---
&gt; Like we all don't got more important stuff to do?
---
Quite a few people in DbD and this sub actually don't have anything better to do. It probably wouldn't have happened in this post, but it's a blanket rule so mods don't have to try and imagine all the ways a well meaning post could lead to trolling.
---
Imagine being able to spell, this comment was made by literate people gang
---
Ya bois a jake main
---
&gt; Besides, it’s pretty easy to pip on killer, so it’s not like people would be down in rank 20 for long if they’re truly that good.
---
Depending on how much hours one plays. I can see myself staying in yellow ranks for majority of my killers (I feel comfortable playing like 6-7 of them), and I usually play purple.
---
I’ll never forget those grey suited bastards. They ran me around the entire game. They played every trick in the book, flashlight saves, 99%ing hooks, baiting me into chases while the others healed their friend when I finally downed one.
---
And I fell for all of it. Fuck Ace. 
---
But why have a red dragon when you could have a crimson dragon? Or even better, a blue eyes white dragon you mere dark magician.
---
Literally running does since he moves at below 110 speed 
---
Solo survivor can be shit but thats part of the skill of playing survivor, work with what you got
---
sometimes you just get potatoes disregard the rank too. like I've had multiple red ranks that behaved like 20s
---
I did literally the same thing. With both Jakes and Dwights, since Megs and Claudettes are really common.
---
I’ve seen footage 
---
Really sole survivor would be shit even if it wasnt an obsession perk. With so many killer obsession perks revolving around punishing and killing the obsession sole survivor should be way stronger. 
---
Yeah I am a Jake Main and almost never find another Jake in a lobby.
---
ah, but the game would turn into trying to find where the totems are first, in the meantime survivors would be hurrying up getting the machines repaired. 
---
Imagine enslaving hundreds of thousands of km^2 of land and now your most interesting thing is that your Queen dresses in different coloured dresses. This post was made by the non-UK gang

8m seems way too small maybe 16 or 20 meters bc there's no warning when he enters feral frenzy almost guaranteeing a free hit.
---
hmmm that's a big think right there.
---
"Punishing and killing" a good chunk of those require the obsession to stay alive, as noted by OP.
---
Ah makes sense ty. That's pretty much all that this Reddit is these days though.

That'd actually make sense.

You're right on the 2nd point, they "work" but the benefit is so tiny it's hard to even notice.

Thank you! I think I might've worded my post wrong and made it look like I was dropping them more than once per slug, but I wasn't, but this answer is definitely what I was looking for. Thank you again!
---
It can take a few minutes. I think It feels worse than it is. I wish we had a hurry play mode where you could pick one of each and get whichever one you get but I think it would make normal queueing worse so we probably won't see that. Also hope you don't get stuck with me IDK what I'm doing yet. I've killed but I haven't yet survived.
---
Unfortunately, your control stick is damaged.
---
You'll need to use a different one. When you wiggle, just do circles.
---
Not enough data for any kind of conclusions, please keep going. :)
---
Right now it either makes it unfair for killer or survivor. Hex totems have nothing to do with fairness
---
Yeah, I'd even take something like the tutorial. Just some free space to practice abilities on survivor AI so that you're not going in entirely blind. 
---
For me it's this:
---
Trapper - Trapper/Stitched Bag (carrying more traps with you is always good) with anything.
---
Wraith - Coxcombed Clapper with Ghost (silent bell and suppressed terror radius/red stain after decloaking). Let's you catch Survivors off-guard.
---
Hillbilly - Carburettor Tunining Guide with The Grease. Fast charging chainsway for close range insta-downs.
---
Nurse - I don't play Nurse.
---
Hag - Mint Rag and Rusty Shackle. Survivors don't know whem they've tripped a trap, and you can teleport to any trap at any time.
---
Doctor - Calm and Order. Massive terror radius in treatment mode and faster build-up of madness. You'll slow the game right the hell down and fake pallets are a nice bonus.
---
Myers - J. Myers Memorial and Memorial Flower. Extremely fast build-up of Evil Within let's you get hella insta-downs.
---
Huntress - Floral Babushka and Oak Haft. Faster charge and cooldown times on hatchets.
---
Leatherface- Same as Hillbilly.
---
Freddy - Unicorn Block and Z Block. 3.5 second dream transition. Essential for high-rank play.
---
Pig - Videotape with anything. You need the videotape for your ambush to ever hit anything.
---
Clown - Red Head's Pinky and Cheap Gin Bottle. Get 6 bottles and if you get a direct hit with one, you can insta-down the Survivor. Ends chases very quickly.
---
That post was the one that was on my mind.As if he isn't weak enough,his add-ons don't even work....
---
Not if all available totems were highlighted like gens are
---
I have yet to experience the Haddonfield sound bug but this paints a perfect image.
---
It's just a game, dont take it serious....have fun
---
Problem is it doesn't take that long to cleanse a totem. So eventually I'm going to find and chase a survivor and another is going to take it down. I can't just sit there and camp a totem all game. I don't want ruin to be up the entire game I just want it somewhere where its going to at least extend the duration of the match while I'm going about my business of finding and hooking survivors.
---
Dedicated servers in the Summer. They revealed this a while ago 
---
Lol fuck the mixtape stun reduction is where its at

Thanks for the update 
---
Dwight as Dwight ha

I'm a good killer (not great, but I reach rank 1 each month), I play every killer pretty equally, but definitely don't play enough of any individual to reach rank 1 on even a single killer within the month, nevermind to reach it with several killers. I have other things to do and other games to play. It would be completely unnecessary to have separate ranks for each killer. The basics are the same for the majority of killers.
---
This
---
Thanks! Most of the time, I will use already made perk icons to help make new ones. Though, sometimes, there’s just no way and I have to design them from scratch. Takes longer, but sometimes that’s more fun. 
---
Yeah I was pretty disappointed at how it actually sounded, given how dramatic everyone was being. I even had to burn 3 keys before I even got to hear it
---
Sometimes that's how it do be
---
The only people I've seen say that is YouTubers and they always say it sarcastically. 🤦
---
Kinda bad
---
nope, rank doesnt matter, so doesnt matter if you go up or down.  Only one way to learn and learn from the best if you are up in the reds 
---
When you hit someone with frenzy, quickly look around for any nearby survivors that light up. If you see someone light up, run to that survivor. If you see nothing, hit that survivor again and chase them normally.
---
Or if you have instant cooldown addons, hit a survivor, then bodyblock them. Depending on the survivor you can get an easy hit on them.
---
I'm like 50/50 between playing survivor and killer (I main Trapper, sidemain Billy and have been working on the Spirit) and it is much harder to play as a killer than as a survivor against a GOOD and COORDINATED group of survivors at any rank below 10.  If you're a killer main, you should be the first to understand this (assuming you've played as a survivor in such a group).
---
As a killer, you have much, much more to keep track of then a survivor. They only really have to watch you. You have 4 coordinated people to keep track of.
---
I'm not saying you can't 4k win against such a group because I have before (mostly because of their altruism) but it is just so much harder for you to get even a sacrifice on such a group. 
---
What i do is i smack them catch up to them end frenzy and m1 also try to hurt a few before picking a target if there is a few around because it will keep them off gens, and buy you some time. make sure to run sloppy for maximum tilting nurses is decent as well :) happy stabbin i use sloppy, nurses, discordence and bbq personally so i can get to a gen with 2 people quicker at the start of the match
---
\*angelic bog water sounds\*
---
I love franks mixtape
---
I mean I kinda agree with him, worst comes to worst and you derank say 3 ranks while practicing. you just get back on your main and you play like normal.
---
At least it doesn't stack if there's multiple
---
Thank you for the full context to the situation. i have been told that the friday the 13th devs have actually already abandoned the game and stopped development but I am not entirely sure if that is true. Last I know about that game is they got the summer swimsuit pack but no updates since. Of course I don't know what role their shutdown would play in terms of getting Jason into dbd when Miller won the case but maybe Cunningham can appeal? 
---
As for Friday the 13th as a game yah I remember all the press around it but the game had no progression or ranked system at hand and was more of a party game. Not that there is anything wrong with that just that there was nothing to really grab on to in the game unles you just wanted to mess around with funny people.
---
I think it would help if they actually did unit testing, because it would find their regressions and stuff like this infinite loading screen/dc issue wouldn't make it to a live build.
---
Game seems pretty well optimized to me. I get constant 130+ fps with a high end setup where other games I struggle to get above 70.
---
I’d like to see one too lol I’ve been unable to play since the patch 
---
&gt;how seriously BHVR takes glitches and exploits
---
HahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahAhahahahahahaha
---
What? Is this a real post? If they actually gave a shit people would have been banned for using the sloppy butcher wraith exploit and yet here we are. With them still playing the game. Or how about everyone who exploits the moonwalk bug on legion, still to this day, people will walk backwards or stare at the floor forcing the survivor to bleedout. 
---
Anyone taking advantage of this bug should be rewarded for having to put up with their incompetence in game design since everyone has had to put up with it for far to long.
---
I'll get his IP and send mustard gas drone strikes
---
Killers should be able to mori the final survivor and the cypress should instead allow the killer to mori one survivor after they have been hooked twice
---
On a side note, I highly recommend everyone watch the whole match and the couple matches before and after this one. 
---
Friendly reminder that this person is in the official BHVR program and this behaviour and extreme biasness seems to be highly praised by many people. 
---
Not saying anything about the playstyle, just the attitude and the intent.  
---
I tell everyone holding it means come get me i mean it makes more sense that way doesn't it? 
---
You spelled Nea wrong, she the real killer here
---
That's actually pretty shitty of you. 
---
I don't think I'll ever be able to accept they dbd Dwight is not the real Dwight.
---
The reward is iridescent shards..... 
---
I had a person hit a ds skill check when I was running impossible skill checks build with all my lullaby tokens and madness tier 3, and well, at that point, I *had* to let them get hatch, right? Mad props to whoever did that. 
---
I prefer tea myself but coffee is pretty good
---
So what’s the deal with legion. When he came out everyone bitched that he’s shitty, now I’m seeing mixed reactions some say he’s good others say bad 
---
And who wanted you to comment? 
---
Great now i want him to be corrupted and turn into a killer
---
Yeah but they have to give up a whole perk alot and. Killer doesnt.
---
If it's intentional only.
---
survivors screaming and crying about killers will never not be delicious 
---
that's a great idea, and it will make the annoying mori dailies easier
---
Why thank you ;)
---
Thanks, and ya i agree with that completely, the BBQ cosmetics were dumb, and it is good to be able to get full sets and this will be the most we can get free which is a good change, as you said! Hopefully the grind isn’t too bad!
---
I thought that but it'd be more of a nerf to legion than anything so
---
Oh I just wanted you to know in case you weren’t aware
---
They did but go off
---
Man he's actually not that bad defiantly not too teir but not bad
---
/r/Pareidolia 
---
&gt;who tf wants a red dragon
---
I do, Captain Wise-ass.
---
I would be pissed if that was me lol 
---
How do you delete somebody else's post
---
"every title represents one of the members"
---
It's because you were acting like an asshole.
---
Then when 6ou realise levelling WITH bubba while using bbq is still likely faster unless you are a literal potato who can't track survivors.
---
I can understand getting all to p3, but everyone at the same time is mental, i’d do 1 at a time
---
pallets are now set on fire on contact
---
That's cheating making a distinction between red and crimson lol. And if we're going the Yu-gi-oh route, I pick red eyes black dragon 
---
How do you do the item one?
---
Is it the same as the Prestige
---
(I only want BPS so everyone can have fun)
---
You all escapes one game, so the killer isn't DCing every game you are winning 
---
Well they’re overall average however they have potential to be extremely uninteractive in chases or very game mechanic breaking with 0 counterplay. 
---
I too make a "Bwaaaaaah" sound when spawning into Haddonfield
---
legions issue isn't balance though, his issue is that he turns the game into a single player experience, there is absolutely zero interaction going on with him, you just find someone, chase them with frenzy that they can't outplay, and then you hit them and eventually down them without outplaying them. Neither party can do anything other than this one thing. It's completely against the game.
---
That happened to me on that exact same window against a doc lmaoo
---
Yeah, I didn't realize that until I faced a freddy and got into his dream world
---
WHERE THE SHIT ARE ALL MY DISTORTION STACKS GOING
---
When i play against a legion without franks i always get myself hit on purpose and then sprint the fuck away so he wont be able to follow my scratches its not perfect but works most of the time and when they have franks theres just nothing to do
---
Nothin wrong with ruin and its not hard to beat legion i'm sure i will get shit on someday by a swf or something
---
It’s nice to see billy spending time with his autistic cousin
---
Did you read the post... At all?
---
: ]
---
Its a rare occurrence i guess but damn not even one at the pig vat? Thats odd 
---
Maybe not for you. I don't get stressed about it because I don't care. I play as well as I can and just ignore the teabagging without getting pressed then I give them some lovely compliments at the end about how well coordinated they were. They always say something nice in return.
---
I was gonna comment about the art, but you gave credit
---
Not boring. Just annoying. You get camped most of the time and then you have to watch your teammates sit behind trees watching as you die without even trying to unhook or do generators.
---
Yeah then i'll get rotten fields :/ fuck that map as lf in particular
---
Man what perk or add on do i need to pull that sketchy shit off?
---
it should be “had to have,” but many people slur their words a little bit or speak quickly so “have” can sound like “of” and now people have started writing it that way incorrectly
---
it uses all remaining charges to Open the lock
---
Cause it's empathy 1
---
Then at least I'm not crazy alone...
---
Had that happen once. Crawled out the moment he grabbed me. So my character got duplicated to one on his shoulder and one running away. I assume this is very rare. 
---
I made a post a few minutes ago about the most importand killer addons in the game. Going over them all in detail and then at the end a summary with in my opinion the best overall addon combo
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ajqzo1/going\_over\_the\_most\_interesting\_killer\_addons\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ajqzo1/going_over_the_most_interesting_killer_addons_in/)
---
They look so happy
---
Does it automatically open the lock? Because I didn't use it on anything.
---
The amount of times I could've used said mechanic is limitless. Good ideea tho'.
---
It seems like they plan on reworking the whole end game which may mean removing the hatch all together if this is the case dont expect any hatch perks ever.
---
This is indeed true, however, playing what is concidered "fair" and still winning is pretty hard to do
---
After sloppy wraith and the current legion exploit still in the game, anyone doing this shouldn't be banned on any platform to begin with. The balls he must have for even suggesting people should be banned is unbelievable. 
---
They don't care about other exploits, performance on console or literally anything else but reeeeee at the first sight of this. They should be ashamed of themselves for saying anyone doing it might be banned. 
---
Well he is faster with more lunge in EW3 so if you can use it to catch up to somebody i could see why but besides that yeah thats the best way to use EW2
---
&gt;Don't get hooked
---
Or just, save your teammate so the killer doesn't get a lot of time to destroy more than 1 vessel?
---
&gt;Don't pick up the vessels until the exit doors are powered
---
Except the vessels that you pick up stay on you till you get hooked. So if someone else gets hooked the vessel is still on you and the killer can't kick that particular vessel. Also if you are good at running the killer around you can keep the vessel up for quite a while.
---
That's probably it honestly, I didn't even know there was a perk that made you drop items.
---
You can just export the video on a flashdrive and put it on your computer 
---
Burn literally any other map offering lol
---
thanks i’ll try that next time
---
Had to've
---
My first survivor game ever was against a hook camping wraith. I, of course, immediately panicked and vaulted through a window into him and was the #2 camp. It was so weird to see camping because I had never even thought of doing that as a killer
---
Yeah true but a lot of those loops happen on low tier killers where its easier to do. I barely see a lot of loops on nurses or billys or even spirits. Its rare where a survivor is good enough to do that on even the best killers. As opposed to legion where every game is gonna be the same thing :(
---
That's all you did?
---
I had the same thing happen last night, I’ve never seen them only downstairs before till then.
---
When I'm in a SWF we try to get match costumes then we sandbag each other whenever we can. It's glorious. 
---
Do you play Huntress and noticed that survivors can duck behind a down pallet and hitting them is super hard?  or was that always a thing and my aim is terrible or the hit box got smaller?
---
But whats a fun and balanced game? the killer getting 3 kills at the 3rd gens? But then that's not really fun for the survivors either. Only one side is really allowed to have fun in this game and that's not the games fault just the genre itself unfortunately.
---
You can do it, but don’t be that killer who comes on here crying that Borrowed Time is OP if they manage to free the guy. I also do find it funny though the amount of end game campers who will BM at the hook, I think that’s when it becomes pathetic.
---
A system like that will never be in place because as already stated, it would mean killers always choosing the best spots, and that takes away from the risk of the perk. 
---
Your ‘logic’ is highly flawed too. Killer hexes are active for the duration of the game until the totem is destroyed, they are not situational abilities the way to two survivor perks you mentioned are. DS can ONLY happen when you’re getting carried, sprint burst ONLY happens when you try to run. With the exception of NOED, killer hexes are active for the duration of the game. You don’t tell Ruin or NOED or TOTH when you want to use them, it automatic. 
---
You see, this is one of those bullshit things killers love to cry about. “Wahhhhhh! My OP perks are gone!” While at the same time on another post saying, “NOED is totes not OP! Just do totems! DUH!”
---
You want your OP perks and scream that they aren’t OP and that survivors aren’t smart enough (in your flawed opinion) to get rid of them, but also say they’re too easy to find at the same time. 
---
Well, too bad. You want the big perks, you accept the big risk. 
---
https://img.fireden.net/v/image/1519/50/1519502428029.jpg
---
Spotted the master brainlet hard at work.
---
I agree with the guy you are replying to,  I don't care about a win if I get it by doing nothing. What's the point if there isn't fun /challenge involved. 
---
Resilience doesn't work after you Deliverance. \[[x](https://imgur.com/KUkbk2Q)\]
---
Well, yeah. My main killers are basically done. And freddy bbq is been eluding me for a fucking long time. When bbq 1 showed up I just lost it and lined up the bloodweb for the exploit. 
---
There’s always room to improve, but I’m pretty sure his main issue is that the killer role is purely reactive (except nurse spirit huntress or legion) and so in most cases your skill matters less than the skill of the survivors, especially when you throw in swf, which is widely considered (even by the devs) game breaking even though we all know they aren’t really going to “fix” it. 
---
It’s wouldn’t be fair for me to tell a group of survivors to “git gud” if I had even one friend free roam spectating the match and calling out survivor locations  whenever he saw someone.
---
yeah i remember one time i m1'd 3 times and missed but i still hit the fourth. Crazy hard 
---
/s
---
No. 
---
No matter how toxic the game gets—and believe me, I’ve been stuck in my fair share of them—nobody can hit the “leave game” button but you. 
---
Yeah but not everyone wants to play nurse or billy or spirit including me and i know legion is boring i didnt say he wasnt
---
Yep, it drops on the ground where you were hit. You can pick it back up from where it dropped unless another survivor steals it.
---
Rancour, looks like. No ebonies here m80
---
True but then you take that possibility into account when you play that killer so its something you should expect and try to prepare for.
---
Trash, reposted.
---
Its just so fucking clunky. 
---
I havent played on it yet since the patch and I'm scared 
---
They spawn often at the pig vat, but I've had matches that didn't have a gen there
---
I'm cool with that. 
---
With the hag add-on where you can teleport to traps without someone activating them, how does the game choose which trap you teleport to?
---
Claudettes were always considered toxic and/or bad players.
---
grunts? ooh you mean the 'aoao'
---
***even killers have to slay the bills.***
---
The game teleports you to the trap closest to the middle of your screen. Also something that might be handy, you look in the direction you were looking at before teleporting if the trap didn't get triggered
---
This is nonsense. Watch some streams for proof how it is perfectly possible to win as killer many times in a row.
---
Doesnt hurt me any as a survivor main. I woulda been hooked and died anyway, unless i saved my DS but then whatever should have used it earlier or not been caught
---
that doesn't help.
---
Meh, that works.
---
Mint Rag is actually really awkward to use. You have to be really careful or you end up teleporting to the other side of the map for no reason when trying to pick up a survivor or damage a gen or something. Sometimes you just end up going to the wrong trap all together. Super broken with MYC tho.
---
They can’t do anything about it either on console, no bans at all. Their community might listen and have respect for them and honor the issue instead of abusing it but its a shame BHVR doesn’t quite treat console with the same level of respect they’re asking for right now.
---
you have to flip them, then call it "learning to be a better game"
---
Oink
---
I told you what they do. Franks downs survivors quicker and dirt make the cool down faster.
---
Yeah the weird stun noises and frenzy noises
---
Yeah I was just talking about the option of increasing the volume of frenzy to “balance” legion.
---
I'll be honest sometimes I'll be playing with a friend who's around rank 13 while I'm red ranks and we usually get a rank 7 or 8 killer so the game is pretty fair. But on 2 separate occasions we were faced against a rank 20 killer and legitimately felt bad after the game because they'd immediately leave in post game. 
---
I dont see how picking on new players ESPECIALLY in post game chat is beneficial to anyone. Schmucks will be schmucks. 
---
Don't quit chases unless there's another target readily available. You'll see the opposite a lot, but it's shit advice.
---
I did some searching to try to find the artist, but I got nothing on my end, just endless reposts to meme websites and pintrest. It may have been made by someone named wobufet, but I think they just reposted it as well. Always make sure to sign your work, folks!
---
Try nurse ? She’s good at stopping loops.
---
Care to be specific? I was watching this stream at the time and saw none of what you are referring to. Just because you are a Fog Whisperer doesn’t mean you aren’t allowed to laugh at a killers mistake or be critical of their play style. 
---
Never played Meyers, are you saying that you go 99% to ew3 and then once you get into a chase you stalk for just a sec so you get ew3 in the middle of the chase without wasting it?
---
I wasn't saying the perk is overrated and/or bad, it's arguably the best perk in the game. I just get annoyed seeing people repeatedly complain about it not being in the shrine every time it refreshes.
---
No you can still hear everything else, the wind rustling sfx is loud but not so loud you can’t hear wounded survivors or even footsteps at close range if the killer has good ears.
---
Ahh righteo. I see what you mean now. Thanks for that. These things always interest me. How people find them etc. 
---
Its been confirmed already that its just a text bug from the new patch (again one of the many new "features"), but the game still uses the correct values (which idk but 3 is better than 1).
---
Well. This is reddit so people regurgitate stuff every day and just shitpost all day. Complaining that people post stupid shit on this sub is like complaining why there is shitstains in the toilet.
---
And the the reward for the stupidest suggestions I’ve ever heard goes too you my good sir 
---
You wants some too?
---
Why not self care? 
---
Did you not just repeat the exact same scenario that I illustrated? So... that IS what you said. 
---
It’s not controlling whatsoever. Like I said, the killer is the only one who can ultimately quit out in this moment. I get it, toxic fucks make you want to leave. But nobody makes the final decision but you. 
---
By your logic, in real life, someone “makes” you kill them by pissing you off. But who pulls the trigger? 
---
I can't be arsed to look it up, one of the streams before Clown's release.
---
I'm fine with power being added back in in compensation.
---
But he is completely and utterly unfun to play vs because of many of his low counterplay mechanics.
---
No wonder they hated you two XD
---
Or just put it down if you dont want it? You had to pick it up if you had something in your hand already - it makes no sense. 
---
There is no downside to picking an item up. Why would you not want to pick up an item?? Should get reverted asap
---
Of course! Sorry, I personally do not like her for her very negative attitude towards people, for her biasness and just general behaviour in certain matches. I think she can very rude as well. 
---
Even wanted to make some clips, but was a bit worried that it would be taken out of the context and that's just would not be fair to her. 
---
Of course you are allowed to laugh. It's just... general impression, you know. 
---
Lol imagine being so pissy you start diving in my comment history and insulting me as if I care.
---
Lol "console peasant" ow my feelings
---
I never said anything about you being good or not?
---
Jesus Christ 
---
Honestly this happened to me and my friends last night. It’s scary as fuck and very annoying 
---
Free escapes? So powering up enough gens, avoiding the killer, finding a key, AND finding the closed hatch is your definition of free? 
---
Wrong!
---
Depends on what you're selling, but I've got time Dwighty. I've got time. 
---
Idk why you are getting downvoted. That just means he played trash. Literally, 80s per gen. He didn't check OVER HALF THE GENS FOR THE FIRST MINUTE AND A HALF. That is just him playing terribly. 
---
Some of them are very sneaky now not gonna lie
---
Quentin- aight guys finna head out
---
You have to press M1 to open the hatch with it.
---
About to get moried
---
I dont know if Rancor is necessary when they already have bitter murmur. I would swap Iron Maiden for nurses calling
---
But rancor isn’t really needed since bitter murmur is in there
---
Everyone is still learning how to play with and against him. The killer itself seems ok to me, his addons idk.
---
Did you get banned?
---
If they had four unique perks! Then the grind to get past more worthless perks would be that much longer.

---
Technically they all get 32k.
---
What changes is how fast they can cap 8k deviousness. So, basically... Play anything and as long you are getting hooks and using your power the BPs will flow. 
---
Just cause you are happy playing at 60fps doesn't everyone else should be happy with the same thing. 
---
i'm guessing more than 1 person makes it out via hatch?
---
you could always run franklins lol
---
It’s like they aren’t bothered by the fact they’re being chased by a killer. Like, they knew they were gonna get chased by a brutal murderer and they still decided to wear a god damn suit. The disrespect...
---
Thank goodness it's a rare add on in that case xD 
---
Thanks for the info! :) 
---
Or she didnt want you escaping while she ran around and vaulted the window.  
---
No but IF they do bans it's gonna be with the next patch/update . 
---
Ahh that explains it. I had just never seen it before and was worried it was some sort of bug. Thank you!
---
Saw this video for the first time in 9 years the other day lol JESUS ONLY.
---
Sorry, guess I should have clarified. Which killer gets the most bloodpoints from a standard game? They are definitely not all equal. For example, even with the buffs, a pig player will have a hell of a time capping deviousness in a match. A doctor player will do it every single match.
---
Gotcha, thanks! 
---
Pig is never hitting that 8k
---
I would say legion or doctor
---
ino i get the most on doctor mainly because he maxes out his deviousness
---
Nurse and Billy are top their, but the nurse will use her power more in a match.
---
Well not queen is a dbd employee so I don't think it's lies or whatever. We will see
---
When not abusing their mechanics they are an average killer. Not amazing and not horrid. You can do wonderful with legion just like every other killer, but that doesn’t change their potential for being extremely unfun to play against. It’s good you don’t resort to doing those things, but your experience as them and against them do not change their teetering imbalance. 
---
Yeah, theres that, its possible but you gotta handicap yourself af to focus on ambushes 
---
"Hard" work.  
---
See it more with survivors honestly
---
Top tier at killing, maybe, but not at getting bloodpoints
---
Legion. You max out Brutality very fast and chase is a close second. Might have to try running Distressing to cap out deviousness though if you can't hit a 4k with them.
---
Legion
---
Hillbilly, a perk that allows him to damage fixed objects in the game (walls and such) not enough to destroy said object but maybe knock a hole or two in it?
---
 Wraith, another tracking perk perhaps similar to nurses strider perk
---
Trapper, a perk that makes his power silent, no sound when setting a trap?
---
Fuck man I have no idea its hard to come up with new perks that fit in with the killers existing perks, fun to think about though.
---
Had to of
---
i think that ship has sailed mainly because that would be so many more survivor and killer perks combine that with the licenced dlcs. i dont see it happening. Hypothetically if they can i would want them to because it would make the grind even worse
---
What about BBQ and cancer?
---
Yes every Myers do this ( well that's what I thought at least ). I do it.  
---
Best is to catch someone on a gen or in the open where they can't loop you and just go EW3 and down them instantly
---
Legion, doctor and Freddy are all great for getting a lot of bloodpoints. 
---
It's an improvement.
---
Freddy, doc, hag, spirit, legion, wraith. Those are free 8k 
---
Nurse usually gets there since basically every hit is a deviousness hit. Huntress if you can land hatchets. Trapper with a bit of luck. Billy/LF are weird so I dont know. I dont play Myers so idk. Pig dont even try. 
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
Thank you kindly, there’s so much new terminology in this game it’s almost a bit overwhelming. Guess i’ll head back to YouTube to watch some more vids on the game and what not! 
---
everytime when i dont see her coming
---
BBQ is good for all killers, I'd replace whispers with it if you aren't to familiar or comfortable with it. If you are than replace discordance with BBQ.
---
This isn't true from my experience. The map pressure she has can prolonged games to absurd lengths, allowing 32k games.

He’s pretty good. At worst he’s a 115% M1, at best he’s got instadowns. If you use acceleration add ons, it’s not hard to catch people with the chainsaw. 
---
Top tier? Nah
---
Barely above Freddy tier? Also wrong
---
an autistic streamer. look him up (not making fun of him he really has autism)
---
It could be a scare tactic in order for people not to abuse this. Personally I don't see the big deal honestly ever since they added the cosmetics shop prestige is literally worthless unless you love to grind .
---
It’s an alright meme. But in a sub with a lot of bad memes, it’s good by comparison 
---
Easily mid teir. With or with out add-ons 
---
They are hiring for quite a few positions for Dead by Daylight. Maybe you'll find someone good. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Well actually , I should just change the title .
---
Wait the left behind on console is a girl? On my PS4 it looks like a guy
---
Once you're in tier 1 madness you treat him like any other killer. That's literally it. You don't even need calm spirit.
---
Useless until you pick up the survivor who everyone knows has been hooked twice, so they body block, attack with a flashlight, and sabo the two nearest hooks.  I've seen it happen more than once.
---
I sometimes go 100% when I’m really far from survivors, but it’s definitely not intentional. Sometimes I’m just not watching closely enough
---
Huntress is my girl. I ran iron grasp, bitter murmur, deerstalker, and nurses. This way when theres multiple people or ppl trying to flashlight you can chase or down multiple ppl and come back to find the original one you downed. As for playing whenever anyone starts running towards something draw your hatchet. Insta stop looping if you know where to throw.
---
Just run rancor instead of bitter murmur.
---
They're nice just to have and throw away on a character when you're goofing off or about to Prestige. Items that *actually* do basically nothing (Cypress Mori, Luck Offerings [they affect Chests now I guess but they're still bad], the various Oak offerings [they're better now but are still bad], Vigo's Shroud, Shroud of Separation [Shroud of getting gen rushed lol], and Splinters [Should be SWF only, or at least give you the Killer's 3 perks to play with]) should be removed or restricted to SWF.
---
Lock you into an animation? Girl if you need to run you can still run at any time. 
---
Who took an item they didnt want before and dropped it in the middle of nowhere? If you didnt want the item most people dropped it right there and when someone else came to the chest it PUT THE ITEM ON YOUR SCREEN and you could just take it - no searching or wondering what it is.  Its a stupid change and should be reverted. 
---
He needed to stretch out his legs
---
You spelled spirit wrong
---
I don't have bbq unfortuantely but I just got Discordance i feel like that would be useful
---
I've always had this opinion as well. The worst that this does is punish a survivor for saving Decisive Strike after being hooked once when they're the last Survivor standing, but really is that so bad?
---
I've also always had the opinion that Ivory Moris should allow you to Mori 2 people while Cypress should allow for 1. I don't want Green Mori to have 2 kills but I think if Cypress was made Green Rarity and given the current Ivory effect while Ivory was made Purple with a double kill limit it could be fair.
---
2 moris is often all you'll get in a match unless you're being an asshole and are specifically aiming to mori everyone. Taking half the Survivors out of the game is huge and I think a 6000 BP offering to do that would be fine if you want to have an easy game but also don't want to be a complete jackass and/or waste 7000 BP.
---
Usually, I only buy cosmetics with “left over” auric cells. However I recommend the black coat for Adam, because it makes him a lot more difficult to find if you get the chance to crawl away. Game changer.

0/10
---
Someone needs to have an item on the web in the same spot as he item you want. Lets say theres streamers on Jeff in the top left, and Kate is to the left of your Jeff. You need to find an item in the same spot on the top left on kates web, something thats 3000-4000 preferably. Then you do the same thing, hold x on the item in Kates web and switch over to jeff. 
---
Honestly the best way to exploit this is to just get party streamers/cakes on your survivors so you can actually gain bloodpoints at a reasonable pace. And if you wanna be a dick then you can get infinite iridescent heads or franks mix tapes or Yakuyoke amulets.
---
Platform: PC 
---
Type of Bug: In Game 
---
Description: When attempting to cancel a hatchet throw as huntress, the animation while doing so becomes very janky
---
Steps to Reproduce: attempt to cancel a hatchet throw 
---
Replication %: happens everytime you cancel a hatchet throw 
---
ye, wasnt sure which Button 
---
Best combo is that Hoodie from the first pic and her jeans from the 80's collection. 
---
i mean the wraith map lol sorry if i misspelled it, whenever i see it that name pops in my head hahah
---
People take things way to seriously sometimes... I hope things get better for you! And btw imagine if our Peppa could actually do this in the game. Like when you down that nasty survivor who's been following you all game and then you did this dance. 
---
One can only dream--
---
No!!! the grim matsuri leggings and P3 head
---
Awww, is logic beyond you? Sorry to break your brain.
---
Yes they do. If you really love the game and play a lot why wouldn't you want to support the devs and look different? And we can't possibly tell you what the best outfits are. Everyone has different taste so you should look in the store on your own and find what you like.
---
It works the same way but requires a bit of luck. Just have an item in the same spot on two characters bloodweb close to each other. So you have streamers on Jeff and a brown medkit on Kate in the same spot. Select kate, hold the button to purchase the medkit but switch to Jeff. Repeat
---
Myers struggles, I wish he got deviousness points for hits while in tier 1 or 3 but especially 3 becuase otherwise I hope you like hitting EW3 like 4 times a match to max it so long as you get a 4K. If you don’t get the 2.5k bonus you must tier up to EW3 the maximum of 7 possible times to get 8k. I hope you like staring at people lol
---
best looking? ask yourself 
---
best to use? P3 claudette je everything that makes the black characters darker
---
Whether it's intended or not, it's not unrealistic to have them standing up at a campfire occasionally.
---
yeah its pretty much a fucking joke but for all the shit people abuse let this be the fucking thing they start banning people for
---
I am on console, and the number of times I have died because I tried to drop a pallet or unhook someone and the game self cared instead would make you sad. I just don't really use it too much anymore.
---
Just because you use that offering doesn't mean the game is going to turn into a farm fest.
---
That's why I just save them for events(mostly blood hunt) so no matter how the game goes I still get my worth out of it
---
Well I think it's better that the new players learn sooner rather than later what the real killer experience is like.
---
That would scare the crap out of me if I saw it looking over my shoulder 
---
Only once? I think that’s a bit absurd with things like Chainsaws and EW3 Myers. Balancing a perk like this would be way too difficult so I don’t think they’d add this. 
---
Right? There should be a counter to NOED. Like a perk of some sort, where if you complete a generator then you get your one stack of not being Insta-downed. 
---
Or how about going around the map and cleansing all 5 totems? Just throwing out ideas here.
---
Jake is best survivor you chose the best path
---
Ppl would just complain about it 
---
Maybe but how would it tier up from level to level?
---
 Maybe have the broken status for 120/90/60 seconds?
---
Yup. I love cosmetics. 
---
Seems like a poorly thought out idea TBH. NOED already has a counter do the totems. 
---
Does it matter? No, because I enjoy the game. 
---
Legion and Doctor. 
---
I don't want it to turn into a farm fest, I just want to be appreciated and not farmed for others expense
---
 Removed for party thread please post it on /r/dbdLFG
---
Alright, thanks for your input. Will take it in concideration when I come to clown's good addons (haven't done his addons yet)
---
I consider BPS “unlucky” items. I burn one and bam! I’m found first/ tunneled or farmed. ): 
---
But that has nothing to do with swf, if someone is better than you, he'll loop you even if he's soloQ and you will lose the game. Let's not pretend you play against 4 No0b3 or Pugs at the same time, most swf are just playing to have fun and are not tryhard. If you get looped for 3 gens, just take an L and learn from mistakes you made so you can get better. No need in blaming swf for everything.
---
Ok your opinion has no relevance and you only shared it to continue the “muh toxic swf” circlejerk. It literally does not have any relevance. Saying something like “yeah Legion is unfun but survivors can be uhhh TOXIC SWF am i right guys??” doesnt mean anything and is just hurting the solo survivor experience.
---
Yeah and if you have self care you can fail the skill check on purpose to wake yourself up. 
---
I've put thought into what a pyramid head killer would have to be like.  I'm thinking he would have an otherworldly dynamic like freddy couples with the ability to slow survivors down before dragging them into his reality, since Pyramid head is canonically a slow lumbering motherfucker.  Either he'd need an ability to severely slow survivors, or an ability to freeze them in place for a bit while he drags his bigass self over to them. 
---
He seems very unappealing.
---
But if there is a survivor that purposely unhooks people at the wrong times. Then obviously teamwork doesn't matter to him. He got his 1500
---
if he doesn't care about whether you go down or not I don't think he cares about whether you get your blood points from your offering.
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is that if that's the type of player they are then you usually bloody party streamers is going to be irrelevant
---
I don't even think it's possible to tier up that many times lol. 
---
But I still 100% agree with you though
---
Haha
---
Seems like devs don't like us :( /s
---
Make some small holes in the back of the mask to put the glasses through
---
I highly recommend Tinkerer. You get the notification and chainsaw your way over there with 0 heartbeat which forces the survivors to either be super aware of surroundings or get sawed. 
---
that moment when the killer brings party streamers and runs into a toxic team @\_ 2 
---
If you read patch notes they stated they added new animations for it
---
Pretty sure that's carrot in my vomit.. but I don't remember eating any.. 
---
It's an unnecessary change that just makes the survivors take longer. Which wouldn't be a big deal except they keep finding ways to make survivors take longer to do things even if miniscule, it starts to add up.
---
shiet meg lemme come up on a number real quick 🍑🙏💯😩😋😝
---
just break all 5 totems and do all 5 generators bro. This counter of breaking NOED is not a counter for solo queue survivors. If I spend the entire match breaking totems while my team all get chainsawed by billy in 3 seconds there isnt going to be a gen even completed. And then if you break totems and they didnt even have NOED it was a waste of time. The only way for people to consistently break all 5 totems is to have a SWF squad with small game and leader so the totem breaking is faster.
---
Very true but doing that every match wastes 70 seconds of survivor time (14 seconds per totem x 5 totems). Since the game is all about which side can do their job fastest this perk would serve a purpose.
---
Drive faster Daddy!
---
Yes if someone is good and not in swf he can still loop me but usually when that happens gens arent done that fast because of lack of communication but when they are in a swf group they are usually well coordinated and even someone with 1 hour in the game can hold m1 for 30 seconds and then get to the next gen while the killer is getting looped on the other side of the map it dosent need to be a squad of noob3s or pugs it just has to be 1 decent player and ots not like pallet looping is that hard 
---
I'm sorry, I read bpoody and laughed.  
---
I get what your post is saying though... And I agree to some extent.
---
I can't, it's too wide. I tried putting them IN the mask, but then they got squooshed. I think maybe I just need to be a maskless main. #freddyforlife
---
EW3 Michael makes you exposed
---
it's a status effect
---
Chainsaws are different - they one hit you but there is no exposed status involved
---
Thank you. :)
---
BBQ/Beast of Prey/Distressing/Thrill of the Hunt.
---
Play as Legion. Max out every category after like 2 chases.
---
He starts with BBQ so the grind is fast on him
---
Yeah because Dead by Daylight games are known to be really slow, right ? /s
---
Yea I would figure that most Meyers players would figure that out pretty intuitively. Just never occurred to me since ive never played him 
---
Jake main since Day 1, I made him look extremely handsome recently (not that he already wasn't). He's a bae.
---
Totem breaking takes absolutely no time, leader is useless there, its also a safe thing to do most of the times. Also if your team gets all chainsawed in 3 seconds it doesn't matter anyway, you can't expect to use one perk to counter the entirety of exposes, its a rare status that needs some investment. Cry all you want but that is most likely never going to be implemented, makes no sense to entirely kill a mechanic with one perk
---
BBQ/Nurses/Whispers/Ruin
---
&gt; Back to the pic though. When I play trapper I usually get SWF groups so traps don't do anything, because they know where they all are.
---
I honestly switch off of Trapper if a SWF group pops up in my waiting queue. There is just not point since his power won't be as useful with SWF. 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect
---
“Get yo Dirty ass back here”
---
Because doing something about it would inconvenience their precious survivor playerbase.
---
Catering to the majority is what's making Behavior money.
---
Good idea. Then if someone is being chased then they can't just activate their balanced landing or dead hard right after dodging the exposed.
---
It’s a tiny detail, but it doesn’t make much of a difference, unless OP wanted the perk to specifically counter Exposed and only Exposed, in which case, fair point. 
---
Regardless, this perk idea would be wayyy too powerful or wayyy too underpowered. If it only counters it once or twice,then there wouldn’t really be a point in running it. If it’s more than 3, that’d be super powerful. This thing would be a nightmare to balance, and on top of other broken things like Legion, the devs just wouldn’t add it. 
---
Doesn't Billy have his chainsaw for pallets though?  I feel like you can just rely on chainsaw for pallets, take bbq + bamboozle, and then use your last two perk slots for like, Agitation or perks that help find survivors.
---
70s across 4 people with something that is relatively safe. Also aura reading is not even nearly as important/rare as exposed. 
---
Why wouldnt my opinion have relevance the first comment i made was my opinion and i only did it because the meme was a '' muh legion is unskilled and broken ''circlejerk its the same when i bitch about swf and when somone bitches about legion and his addons its opinions 
---
Sad, but true
---
Stop complaining about no ed, it is not op, half of the time the killer doesn’t even get to the end game, so it’s a waist of a perk slot. 
---
Because this is reddit. People do it all of the time. 
---
I'm farming my way to buy a shirt for him to finish my ultimate sexy dad look.
---
The gate is clearly open. Anyone dying now should have left when they had the chance. 😤
---
Oh, I haven't noticed they do anything when I've tried it. I've only ever noticed it work on the killer that goes invisible. (Can't remember what it's called lol) 
---
No mention of heart or ear add ons for hag? Those are pretty good. And water shoe is better than the hand since you get a lot more for giving up your teleprorting (still not great but worth more of a mention than hand). 
---
I find increase duration kinda weak. Yes you can teleport after hooking (usually) but they'll be long gone anyways. I'd prefer the aura read to that one since you can at least see where they are going and potentially head them off after hooking. But generally there's better options than either. 
---
Honing stone doesn't do anything if a friend frees them (most common way of escaping with swf, your strongest enemies) so it's kinda meh. If it catches a solo, they rarely escape before I get there so it doesn't really solve a problem I have. 
---
You’re right, but id say this community is pretty respectful towards others creations.
---
You should save the streamers and cake for the double bp weekends because people will not even care about it.
---
Then why does it matter that team mates are not the best
---
*^(I think I just peed a little...)*
---
I don't think so, the same way it doesn't work if a survivor struggles out of your grasp.
---
It is without hair/tombstone addons that increase the required evil to tier up.
---
(Easy explanation is each survivor has 10 evil and at base it takes 5 evil to tier up. You get 500 points for stalking as you fill up the tier and an additional 500 points every time you tier up. Essentially you get 1000 points every time you tier up but you need 5 evil. Each survivor has 10 evil so 40/5 is 8 meaning you can get 8000 just off of stalking. Only catch is that if you sacrifice one survivor before you get all possible evil from them then you will be relying on getting a 4K to make up the 0-2000 points lost per survivor depending on how much you did or didn’t stalk them.)
---
(Oh and if you use the hair or tombstone addons you won’t be able to tier up as many times, so you lose out on the 500 point bonuses from tiering up and can no longer hit 8k purely from stalking)
---
OPs suggestion is trash but it doesnt mean NOED is any better. There are only two other perks that are badly designed, Dying Light and Insidious. Why does a killer need a 4% movement speed increase on top of exposed? Just rewards the killer for not being good enough and not ending the game before the gates were powered. And it punishes the survivor for doing their objective. Remove DS and NOED from the game or remove the movement speed buff.
---
Dying Light rewards you for tunneling and its not even powerful enough to consider using. And Insidious only purpose is to basement camp as Leatherface.
---
&gt;And about the streamer part, yeah, they can win while playing killer; but only using the same 4 perks (mostly with Nurse), and you can already guess what is one of them (quick tip: it starts with R).
---
Good nurse players and streamers dont even use Ruin on Nurse. You clearly have no idea what you’re talking about lmao
---
You just made a post about Quentin standing as well. Are you going to make one for each survivor as you see them?
---
These posts are so dumb. 
---
1. It’s not even a bad spot just don’t chase survivors towards that pallet. 
---
2. No, actually, they did not say they reworked totem spawns. They said they’re workING on it. Aka it isn’t finished yet and there are more improvements to come so stop making these dumb posts 
---
I really don't think it's that important to do unique "oof" sound effects for each legion member. It's just stun noises and etc rather than any actual scripts. 
---
Kk
---
Saying that one killer counters the perk is a pretty silly reason for saying the perk is underpowered. And even against a Myers eating an exposed effect has amazing potential for slowing Myers' momentum. If he hits you and you aren't exposed then Myers is either forced to keep chasing or find another survivor, both of which wastes a TON of time and has a high chance of nullifying his T3 once. That sounds amazing to me.
---
Point 1: I never tried to change the fact it's a common error. So of course it doesn't. I just pointed out that being a common error means it's correct in context and that 'correcting' it is pointless.
---
Point 2: I'm not missing the point at all, but you clearly are. So it's hilarious you're trying to flip it. And of course you're done, you're clearly out of your depth.
---
Report this guy for being better than me at the video game
---
Survivors can cleanse totems at the same time. Leader just got into he meta I believe which also increases action speed.
---
Just google “Cookie Monster holding gun” in images
---
Literally everyone makes jokes like that and aren't actually complaining. That's all I'm saying, no need to be a rude ass.
---
"I'm still your boss."
---
Is the an Erik-Andre reference?
---
This may or may not help you, but it is useful to know that it only takes two people to get him to tier three when he uses the infinite duration as long as he is not running a tombstone at the same time, in which case he needs to stalk a minimum of 3 people for the ability to mori people on the spot for the rest of the match.
---
idk. they ae the only ones that I saw standing up
---
He’s like any other killer in my opinion, some do good some don’t. I just don’t understand what happened between his release when every post on here was that he’s trash and needs a re work, now everyone complains that with franks mixtape he’s op with no counter 
---
Ugh lame.
---
I have been struggling mentally aswell. Wish you the best bro.
---
...
---
Because exposed effect is built into many killers kits. Its just a dumb perk idea. Im sick of perks made to just band-aid fix something the community doesnt like instead of actually fixing the problem. Rancor was meant to punish le TOXIC DS USERS!! and its a trash unfun perk that can even target someone without any obsession perk.... Just fucking nerf the perks already instead of pussy footing over the actual issue.
---
DS REWORK: If you succeed the skill check, you are **Broken** for the rest of the trial.
---
NOED: Survivors are exposed when the hex totem is lit (remove insane move speed increase).
---
NO, If u go maskless as the huntress you will make the entity cry
---
Oh, I didn’t know that. Thanks. 
---
Which is why I suggested it only having once charge as opposed to 3. As far as saving 17.5 seconds per survivor, I think this is fairly comparable to other survivor perks and how much time they save you over the course of the game, yes?
---
Two days ago when the new Spirit cosmetics came out I immediately bought the black uniform. Before then I was using the dress and headpiece from her Very Rare skin. I’m still using the headpiece. Last night I got her bloody weapon, and now I have my perfect cosmetic setup. It’s so satisfying and I say yes, it was definitely worth it.
---
That does suck. Whenever people bring bps I try to farm with them, or if I don't feel like it (I got them twice in a row last night), I'll usually just kick around and hook everyone a couple of times &amp; let them go.
---
Also sad but true
---
The perk idea clearly isn't great. You were just wrong on a mechanics issue
---
Only once per match is not at all good. You don’t need this perk to waste time for Myers, just loop him. He’s a M1 killer so he’s susceptible to loops very easily. If you want this to counter other perks like MYC or Rancor, again, not necessary because with MYC the killer has no idea who saved the guy and with Rancor there’s nothing you can do at all. This perk doesn’t counter Rancor because Rancor has infinite exposed so one hit isn’t going to matter.    
---
Show me your ultimate sexy dad!
---
Don't insult people because you don't agree with their opinion. Trash behavior. Grow up.
---
Understandably 😅
---
Sorry was trying new ideas 😅
---
I like that idea. I know personally I use rancor a lot &amp; I always feel kind of bad that there's no counter to it besides 'don't get caught.'
---
So should I make less choas or make it very simple?😐😅
---
See u there bröther 
---
console peasant found
---
Bond IV: See **every particle of air** outlined for an **unlimited** range
---
That's the entire point, to choose between cleansing totems and giving up time or risking NOED. Stop asking to not have anything impede your genrush.
---
Pallets and looping are well within the games balance and design.
---
2 hitting someone with frenzy and then moonwalking to *literally* cheat the bleedout system and get a free down with 0 counterplay is not 
---
&gt; For more information on game rules: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system#latest
---
I do like the idea of balancing the perk rather than adding a new one. Obviously this idea would have more uses than just as a counter to noed (as you mentioned since the exposed effect is "built into many killers kits"). Since I'm suggesting just a one time trigger I'm interested to know why you think it's a dumb perk idea.
---
When people are too fucking lazy to take 10 extra seconds to look up the video themselves.
---
Ah fuck pls don't see my prestige glitch 
---
Oh. This just got interesting considering all the "They aint gonna do shit" talk happening yesterday.
---
Not necessarily, most other killers can't 4-man against the best survivors, and of the two that best can, the nurse is better both for points and killing.
---
Hillbilly can't realisticlly get the point the in deviousness, while most other killers can't get full sacrifice.
---
That could be them ducking into a locker. If you see somebody get picked up you can jump into a locker and completely nullify BBQ’s aura read. 
---

Pray you don't. I must have pissed off the BHVR gods because it's the only map I get anymore. My hearing is starting to fade. Run. Don't let it get to you...
---
finally
---
Dude.... I know you like Meg but please
---
I’d be angry also. 
---
Gee whiz, I wonder why that is. It couldn't possibly have anything to do with the fact that generators pop at the speed of light or anything. /s
---
So all the assholes have to do is simply  say "I didn't know any better"?   Will remember next time a bug of this magnitude appears again.  No need to be honorable if there is no punishment for being a dick.
---
Woohoo that means ochido is screwed i he even still streams or whatever he did
---
No they were specifically on gens. And ik thats gonna makr it seem like they just went behind the gen so i couldnt see them but they didnt move the aura just vanished as quickly as it appeared
---
Oof.. yeah I’d have been pissed about that. I absolutely can’t stand playing against legion though. I play both sides 50/50 and I refuse to buy legion and use him. 
---
What was the point, it is not like it unlocks the teachables or anything.
---
I know i said it in my edits that i dont defend legion i dont think legion is well designed or balenced and my problem isnt really with pallet looping its more with how fast you can get gens done while someone pallet loops the killer
---
Awesome idea but they fucked up legion so hard. Nothing is cool about that character. What a waste. 
---
True that
---
8.
---
Definitely would be good if they gave maybe 2,000 less bp’s than it took to buy them. Lots of extra bloodpoints to get the better add-ons and perks with but you’re not just farming infinite bloodpoints with it.
---
I would suggest also having to use that add-on a certain amount of times to be able to trade it in, or needing a certain total amount collected (say 25 for common, 20 uncommon, 15 rare, 10 very rare and 5 ultra rare?) for each add-on.
---
For an example say you want to trade out Spirit’s Dirty Uwabaki. You would need to get 15 of them total from the bloodweb, and they would trade out for 3,000 bloodpoints apiece. Note that you don’t need to have 15 in your inventory, but you would need to collectively purchase 15 total, and the count doesn’t change whether you use any of them or keep them.
---
Another example - Judith’s Tombstone for Myers. You would have to collect 5 of them to trade them, and they would trade for 5,000 bloodpoints each.
---
One more because I like being in-depth. Metal Spoon for Nurse. Collect 25 total and they’ll trade for 1,000 bp’s each.
---
I really like this idea so I just wanted to share my input on how it could balance out.
---
Yeah but the same principle also applies to the other side of the arguement, they literally could’ve just pulled a random employee to make some random noise and it would’ve taken like 10 minutes maximum of extra time. I personally don’t care but I do find it interesting that they went through a lot of effort with the design on this killer and then reused voice lines. 
---
Honestly it would’ve taken them like five minutes to edit the male audio file and lower the pitch or something then put the lower one in for Joey and the regular one in for Frank if they didn’t want to go through the process of recording someone. 
---
Well let's be honest most good players are toxic, I am at rank 10 now and everytime I chase someone for more than 1 minute they start T bagging when they drop a pallet. And yes you can say I ruin there game but how about me? If I have to chase someone for 4 minutes that ruins my game so that's why I don't wanna do it twice. 
---
My man Dwight, of course.
---
Ah i see i understand the ban hammer wont be so bad so there wont be to much to worry about but what if i bunch of salty survivors claim you targeted them specifically when all you did was tunnel. Ik they want video proof but i could see the tunneler somehow getting the shitty end of the stick.

BHVR: GAME BANS NOW AVAILABLE ON CONSOLE.
---
someone make this a meme, thanks.
---
The tea bagging may have been deliberate, but that doesn’t mean the glitch was. 
---
Oh god that's a long while. I was hoping your complaints indicated quicker matching on consoles. The kind of game it is though it makes sense for a small wait. 
---
I've got most of the dlc and honestly all I want is to be good with Freddy. 
---
"Fuck your Framerate. Fuck you getting simultaneous updates. Fuck certain countries not being able to but Auric cells on console. Fuck the load time times. Oh you exploited a feature literally nobody asked for? Let's update the consoles to ban people who got Hag's bloody dreadlocks."
---
Really glad they have their priorities sorted at BHVR. I feel so sorry for you console players who put up with their shit. 
---
I don't think so, ofcoure if he is facecamping he can't gain any points but he won't lose them.
---
So maybe they mean the killer is losing points because if he wouldn't face camp he could get extra points.
---
Type of Bug - Achievement error 
---
Description: Finished a game by escaping with a friend (who was playing as Bill) then all of a sudden we both get the left for dead achievement (the one you're only supposed to get for escaping by repairing the last generator and getting out by yourself. I feel bad about it, is there anyway BHVR can take the achievement off of our accounts. If not I think behaviour should patch this soon, as it's unfair to people who got the achievement legitimately.
---
If the killers talked I'd be more upset about this. But they don't so it doesn't matter.
---
Just realised I didn’t see anything about console bans in the link I posted, but they said this on twitter https://www.instagram.com/p/BtEgf4EA2iM/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=1dthw6iifvw3
---
It won't. They also will ban intentionally false reports, which is why they listed what you can't report. If it's not obvious that the killer is targeting you, then it's not gonna be banned.
---
I said that Ruin is mostly used with Nurse, not that it's always used. 
---
And still, my main argument still stands: having either to play Nurse or use Ruin just shows how flawed the game is.
---
Report and move on. This Ochido-wannabe assclown will get banned and be forced onto console.
---
My back! My poor back! 
---
The console bit is just grey with nothing on it. 
---
Slugging can be an effective strategy in moderation with the proper situation, but I wouldn’t call a 4 man slug build sweaty, just unfun to play against.
---
Granma's Heart: I feel like it's very situational. With how I play hag, traps mainly get triggered when I want to teleport to them, so it doesn't seem all that handy, not to mention that you have very little control over when your traps get triggered. I mean, whats handy about a 0 meter terror radius while carrying a survivor. Also, I might be wrong, haven't tested it out, but I think the Cracked Turtle Egg would helo you with this addon since if I'm not mistaken, it would increase the time your terror radius stays at 0. Unless the heart breaks off the chase music, I don't see the use of it.
---
Disfigured Ear: survivors are deafened for 6 seconds. Seems pretty handy to me, it's just that I don't feel like it has a chance against the other addons. It could be handy with the Scarred Hand.
---
Scarred Hand: again the Cracked Turtle Egg is a really good fit with this addon. Place your trap at a pallet and you deny the survivor the pallet for quite some time, not to mention that these traps also bodyblock when not triggered, you can make it impossible for survivors to enter the killer shack without triggering (or destroying) a trap
---
Waterlogged Shoe: While yes, the Waterlogged Shoe gives the hag a slight i crease in movement speed and the survivor a slight decrease in movement speed. You are basically throwing away your ability to teleport just so you can be a slower clown with only 1 (hag) addon. I first used this with the hand, but soon found out that the turtle egg is the better option
---
Pretty much
---
removed as we already have a post about it https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ajsyuo/bhvr_on_twitter_the_player_game_bans_feature_is/
---
I'm not trying to be disrespectfull of your feedback, I really apreciate it, but at the moment, I just don't agree with your hag addon choice
---
You know he can escape even from that way right...?
---
If you don’t chainsaw it’s incredibly easy to chase with billy. Not sure why, but he seems like he’s faster than the other killers with the same speed
---
I think it's repeated acts across multiple matches, don't think single instances would count. But say every time you saw the person in a lobby and you tunneled them each time, then maybe. 
---
It's a placebo. 
---
god yes please
---
That is pretty darn good. You have a great sexy dad, mine's kinda like...lumberjack gay
---
Those are perks, cypress moris are a ONE-TIME USE OFFERING that only works for the last downed survivor in the game.
---
Saving them for those weekend doesn’t matter. BPS and cake only work on the base value (before the add the double blood points for the event). We experimented with this during the last event. 
---
Oh no, the killer wants a kill and ruins your fun. Better report him for doing his job!
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I’ll see what I can do
---
Noob3: *dc*
---
Did you read what the first comment here said? The glitch also exists in a manner where you can’t get out.  Just because he can move doesn’t mean he can escape. 
---
I think most people complaining about noed arent complaining that it is "too strong" just that It's used every other match if not every match. I swear I have to clean all 5 totems in more than 50% of my matches to destroy noed tier 1 and 2 at this point.
---
I respect your optimism lol, honestly the only reason I’m kinda okay with playing against legion is that it’s fun to pull a sweet juke and watch them spin themselves out and swing in circles as you run away. They aren’t the most fun killer at times but at least it breaks the monotony of running around a loop for a while, and juking them at close range feels pretty good
---
I didn’t care about cosmetics until I saw the holiday sweaters. They’re the only thing I’ll probably ever have bought. 
---
And that fucking sucks. Perks are supposed to be options, something you can mix and match to fit your own playstyle. Forcing a Killer to use a certain perk just to have a match last more than 5 minutes is ridiculous.
---
That's not even the worst of it; it's still a hex perk, and that means you need to play around it, defend it, if you want it to last. Otherwise, you'll mostly end up with only 3 perks 1 minute into the match.
---
Didn't know Freddy was that weak
---
Locker sandbags are hilarious haha
---
Sea Turtles, Mate
---
Should have been stocking on ebony moris
---
Not about losing, it’s just stupid and boring as fuck and ruins the game
---
Feels sweaty to me.
---
I go bbq, devour, discordance or surveillance, and blood warden
---
Ban system live on console bois, GG
---
Still not bannable.
---
This post didn’t age well.
---
And yet my statement is still correct. 
---
I think OP just hasn't witnessed how it occurs and assumes he used an exploit because he is taunting him and sticking around for way too long. I think what actually happened was he ran past the gates without it counting as an escape and the survivor taunted the killer afterwards
---
Yes, survivors DO need yet another uncounterable crutch. 
---
If you make a claim that there is a case where someone can't escape where other people have been in that predicament and have escaped, you require proof. Have you been in that situation and haven't been able to escape?
---
No what’s BS is we get hit with a unhook PENALTY because assholes wanna camp and you can’t get them off the hook! I lose pips and go down in rank if you get multiple killers who camp game to game and on PS4 you get allot of camping, and your all like just do gens and leave! Yah that’s all fine and well but just hanging out the gens and leaving when the killer has gotten 2-3 of your teammates leaves you with nothing because of a stupid Penalty! If people wanna camp that’s fine but I WANT THE INCOMPETENT DEVS TO DO AWAY WITH THIS PENALTY!!! Also god luck with the bans funny how you fucks said you couldn’t do it before but since there is a exploit you guys magically put out your whipping Cains!  
---
Survivors who stand and watch are indeed the problem. I'm all up to "hang in there" to help the others. So teammates go get your fingers in a gen
---
What about 1234? Or 1337? Or 2000?
---
I meant broken like not being able to heal to the healthy state. 
---
Not gonna sell that one either are ya?
---
I highly recommend Make Your Choice. You hook someone, trap them, go away then when MYC activates you teleport back and get your free instadown. 
---
Really wish there was a way to see time played on console 
---
Nope, I'll leave that honor for those who come next.
---
My journey in the fog ends here.
---
It should but it doesnt 
---
Farewell then
---
Aaawww, so cute :3
---
Hell nah! It’s one of the few ones I’m starting to like~ when it’s plaster I also cannot guarantee it’ll fit others :3
---
He has ants in his pants 🐜 🐜 🐜 
---
How did I miss that? My mistake. 
---
Bubbly Homie
---
You mean Ju-On: The Grudge?
---
Unrelenting isn't really good, it rewards you for failing, and you should play with the idea of succeeding. Iron grasp isn't that good, but it's fine, I believe it gives you around 3 more seconds of carrying someone. 
---
Monitor and Abuse is pretty good, a Doctor perk, since she has a low terror radius, it gives you an even lower terror radius, allowing you to get really close before starting a chase. Thrill of the Hunt can be nice too since you thrive at defending, but if you protect your totem too much it can cost you the game. Nurse's calling, Enduring and of course Noed are good on all killers.
---
Yup! Glad we got that settled. 
---
Freddy and Legion are TERRIBLE at killing people, but they're the best point machines in the game.
---
They are hiding because you ran too close to them with the killer and got spooked by the heartbeat. Obviously. Damn rank 20s. Smh.
---
That didn't....okay
---
Oh, I gotcha, so now empty handed survivors have to treat chests the same way survivors with items do?  That's real dumb
---
It's been a whole month!! You can make millions,
---
It's been a whole month!! U can make millions
---
Freddy is life. 
---
When I asked for lady abs I didn’t think this is what I’d be given god dammit 
---
Omg poor Polnareff  😭
---
Nah, as long as he doesn’t hack anything he’s fine. Pretty sure that’s what he got banned for on PC, people seem to think it was for being toxic. You can’t get banned for flashlighting the killer and teabagging. 
---
There is, I'm pretty sure it's the same spot you see achievements. On Xbox. Not sure about PS4. 
---
Oh joy. Another Survivor vs Killer black and white why do (insert S or K main) cry so much.
---
Camping after the gate is open isn't camping. It's defending a hook which you know they're after because they haven't left yet. 
---
It's your choice to stay at the hook or not, no one likes being hooked with the killer just watching over them and no one wants to leave the poor person on the hook so you should probably expect upset players if you do that.  
---
It's not just a survivor thing either, if a survivor urban evades around Haddonfield hopping in and out of lockers after you get the other three, no hatch and no gates and you've basically won but you're unable to find this one person who's dragging out the game despite losing are you going to get upset about it?
---
I’m on PS4 :(
---
It takes a long time to make xd I also only use materials I have home due to lack of money, space and energy. I barely have energy for myself xd but yeah it’s a big problem that it may not fit people D: Maybe will consider it in the future. But not right now atleast~ 
---
Nope, I'm this way in real life too. 
---
You're sure full of yourself I'm sure once you grow up you'll figure out how things work a lot better. 
---
Best of luck kiddo
---
I don't get it. Why are people saying they "lost" something? Is there a glitch? Wat
---
Welp, atleast the next few months is loaded with great game releases, I'm having a blast playing RE2 remake right now! :D
---
I like them tho
---
If it's any sort of plus, the exploit seems to be under the non-permaban section. If they find you, maybe they'll only hit you for a few days to a week.
---
'enters lobby and sees a multiple prestige Claudettes'
---
"Nice! We're in for a good game with these pros!"
---
'All Claudettes DC first time on hook' 
---
Idk, but i don't think so
---
Learn to loop properly and don't break unsafe pllets
---
:0 
---
I did not expect this
---
Exactly. Saying how you have fun isn't a valid counter argument because everyone's experiences vary. If I get fruit looped im not having fun at all. Even if at the end of it I 4k it's still naturally frustrating.
---
Legion, Nightmare, Spirit, Wraith, Doctor, Shape, Hag, Pig, Trapper, Hillbilly, Huntress, Nurse, Cannibal 
---
I think differently. I found that both Legion and Nightmares are the best for my play-style. I’m not the killer main, so I’m really bad at playing Nurse and Huntress. Cannibal is the worst imo, no creativity, boring to play, and no fun for both side if you know what I mean.
---
I'm mostly hovering around somewhere in green/yellow ranks too though, currently 9 on surv I think. Certainly seen teammates some very odd locker plays that don't seem appropriate for anything but brown ranks even recently, but no sabo jakes in a long time.
---
That isn't because of amd mine uses amd works fine
---
Let me guide you into the light
---
Great 👍 now change to killer v survivor and put hatch in between 
---
Oh shit something must have happened with the video LOL my bad 
---
I love corn fields if im survivor especially with iron will and urban. Maybe sprint burst
---
He de-ranks to bully low-rank Killers and frequently uses exploits and toxic behavior in his videos.
---
Worst part is that his mostly young, impressionable fanbase loves to copy him.
---
He's so bad that he has been perma-banned on PC (twice, irrc) and has now fled to PS4.
---
You must really enjoy landing skill checks to want killers to camp more
---
Because you're a bottom feeding Ochido wanna be loser.
---
well its your Post....so what is it about 
---
Flashlights, pls.  (Only when I'm a survivor though :)
---
He got a few soft bans for publishing videos of exploits, I believe.  
---
Thanks for the report, I'll fix it in a second :)
---
It's our subreddit sidebar 
---
Can I be your sponsor
---
Asl? Hello
---
I think its a bit too much. The drawback for having the perk on is that it benefits when the obsession is alive, thus the obsession can do gens and possibly escape. Unless obsession knows where hatch is, this would basically guarentee obsession's death.
---
I usually find chainsawing pallets inefficient unless you have stacked add ons for charge time. Also, if you pre rev in most locations it makes you easier to read and slower, possibly extending chases.
---
It would be a great way to help prevent toxic teabagging at the gate.
---
oh okay
---
Sure, its fun but not efficient. That's like there being a way to bowl to get a guaranteed strike but you do it another way where you dont get strikes sometimes but sometimes you do and then your opponents patting you on the back because you didnt destroy them the right way.
---
How much longer are you inbred autistic shitstains going to keep riding Ochido's tiny dick?
---
For me personally, I’ll do it for some extra points. I’ve never really thought about the points it gets the killer as well, but I suppose it’s an equal share and can sometimes count toward them too
---
Im really doubtful they can do anything about it, how are they supposed to know someone did the glitch the games been out a long time now. 
---
In regards to console im even more doubtful given that its all of a sudden possible to ban apparently when they never could before 
---
The prestiege glitch can only be done if you are purposefuly messing with the game mechanics and you will notice it effects immediately when you do it. Those who do it know what they are doing and do it on purpose to abuse an exploit.
---
Sloppy butcher glitch could be done on accident while just playing the game normally and it didn't give any indicator to the one doing it since it was survivor side glitch only. It is unfair to punish countless individuals who had no way of knowing about it, especially if they don't go on reddit/forums.
---
There is a very clear difference here and you can't simply ignore it. 
---
Again, Azeroth?????? Hahahaha. 
---
Ruh roh raggy
---
Not necessarily in a row. Let's say we played one game where I tunneled and facecamped you. Some time later (say, couple of days) you are in my lobby again, and I tunnel and facecamp you again, and I make it my goal to get you first. Then a third game - same thing... That's a grieving, and it's bannable. 
---
Can we report people for bannable offenses they committed in the past? I kept a video of a blatant lag switcher on PS4 for this very reason.
---
Lmao, Azeroth comes to my mind everytime too.
---
(but DBD one Is Azarov) 
---
One can only hope.
---
Correct
---
It’s an altruistic action to sit there on the hook while being camped. You just have to hope that your being camped results in the killer getting facestomped by the other survivors, so the killer won’t get many BP.
---
I would say that if totems spawned well, ruin would be the best perk.
---
These are the best comments on this subreddit.
---
Im gonna be honest I dont think anyone ever has been banned for that, like how exactly do you define being "targeted", because if its just being tunneled every game that cant be bannable or being morid every game then that would be ridiculous as the person is just playing the game.
---
I think the rule was just put in as some streamers would get harassed quite often and they wanted something doing about it
---
Right. Shouldn’t be bannable but should be punished in the game, e.g., with fewer BP and/or a pip penalty.
---
*Laughs in Distortion + Quick &amp; Quiet to enter lockers faster and to block aura if you don't get to one in time*
---
Maybe you should get better at looping them, no offense. I don't really think they're comparable
---
2184 is the best number to have as You have played.
---
If survivors play smart, killer will be punished. Exactly like that: few BPs, no pip.
---
I do it to give some points, wait for others, and also if I'm first to get hit after gates are powered then it reveals NOED to the team and I stay safe.
---
It's neither hacking nor an exploit. It's a bug. Not intentional. Don't think he was teabagging to taunt you. Probably just freaking out not knowing what to do. If he comes back in you'll kill him if he stays out there he can't escape. 
---
Your team should be the potato because you’re carrying them. 
---
Death Grips 2.0 should play with the fuming mix tape
---
I'll bring Herman's punishment stick. He has a "shock people" ritual anyways, so he won't need it for the next trial.
---
Yeah, it can be sorta difficult to hit 360ing survivors on ps4 because the frame rate will occasionally just make them look like they disappeared.  Combine that with corn and I just can’t do it.  If I’m against a team of survivors that exclusively run into the corn and 360, I’m guaranteed to have a terrible time.
---
Platform : PS4
---
Type of bug : In game 
---
Description : Skill checks in game disappeared and never re appeared while working a generator. 
---
Video link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6_mIwdnujY
---
the game tracks currency, blood points shards cells so i'm guessing it might involve that 
---
I only noticed this recently too, but it goes with the same scheme as the bloodweb colors:
---
R20-R16: Brown
---
R15-R13: Yellow (actually, R16 might be Yellow too instead of Brown?)
---
R12-R9: Green
---
R8-R5: Purple
---
R4-R1: Red
---
It doesn't necessarily mean anything. You can be over- or underranked of course, I'm actually fairly happy with Green - can escape most games on game sense alone without sweating like hell to optimize chases (which I'm kinda bad at anyway), the killers generally know what they're doing but aren't unbeatable. Meanwhile as killer, even rank 15 can be stressful as hell as there a lot of really good (and sadly often obnoxious as people) survivors that lost a lot of rank (in some parts intentionally to screw around)... just to get potatoes again two games later.
---
Bbq is great on anyone, but if you see you are not doing so great with her, dont mind swapping bbq out since hag is one of the killers that bbq is less effective.
---
To explain. You simply dont have the time to abuse its aura reading. You gotta trap the hook, trap the areas that were popped on the chase, and you are ultimately a slow walking killer. So, bbq is great for farming, not so great for optimal play.
---
As for the rest of the perks. Myc is great even if it kinda makes you proxy camp sometimes.
---
Nurses cause its range its higher than your terror radius, couple it with Monitor and Abuse and you are one sneaky lady.
---
Sloppy to slow the game down iust a little bit.
---
Knowing dbd sometimes people don’t

Game might be messed up but that hud quality is better than my ps4 can do, and that's a screenshot!

That's what I told your ho mother last night when I was inside her.

This one is fun!

I run the same build but switch Monitor and Abuse with Sloppy Butcher. Hag really needs perks to slow the game down as she has to waste time at the start of the match setting traps 
---
-11 votes oof
---
in what dimension can dwight or claudette be considered  "innocent"?
---
If I am injured I will wait so another survivor can come and heal me and squeeze the last little bit of co-op points.  Sometimes I also stay and wait to see if anyone gets caught so I can go for the save, especially if I am Quentin because I run No One Left Behind.
---
i'll bring the  fists
---
They used to announce best players on streams, but then Streamers got their fans to upvote and it became free advertisement on stream for streamers.
---
Who wants to hear the same name again and again.
---
You mindgame/dont break unsafe pallets and kick all the safe pallets. Maps like autohaven have a lot of safe pallets. When looping these your goal is to make the survivor drop the pallets asap. When the survivor drops the pallet and loops it, you kick it. If e survivor drops the pallet and runs away you dont kick the pallet and instead go after the survivor.
---
You can look up DamnNoHtml's video on countering loops. He mostly goes over jungle gyms but he also gives some tips on double pallets/smaller loops
---
Sloppy was by no means survivor side only.  Killer has full view of the blood fountains that made players super easy to spot, even in corn.   My point still stands though.   No reason to "Play Fair" if there is no punishment for abusing an obvious bug. Simply going to promote and go full asshole mode on the next one.
---
Man spirit would actually look so cool with a blind fold.
---
Hopefully we get a blind killer soon. I really love the whole blindfold aesthetic, kind of like the demon hunters from wow. 
---
Platform ps4 
---
Spirits blade glitching
---
To repeat down a DS user and attack before the DS is activated. Her blade will be fully "constructed" in her hand rather the just the broken down tip. Works for lag "snatches" when you grab a survivor but it freezes mid animation and they escape
---
'Having an edge due to playing a lot' is literally the definition of skill lmao. You do something a lot and then you are good at that thing and then you have an edge on people who don't do the thing a lot.
---
you'd be surprised 
---
...they already lied about optimization and barely anything happened from it. Of course the company with a track record of incompetance and lying is gonna do it again
---
how am i toxic asshole?
---
"So that was a fucking lie"
---
I like Monitor and Abuse, STBFL, Nurse's Calling and a filler perk (usually MYC, Knockout or Sloppy) 
---
dude its perfect ur the only one who makes dank memes on this sub
---
"What Does the Fox Say" probably. Because that song is as useless as that add-on.
---
Why exactly do people not like the mixtape? Can't you mend yourself from deep wound? Or does Frank's top jams make the rather difficult?
---
"Logic" lmao, there's no logic. You're saying the typo is excused "because it's just the character talking" and blahblah maybe even throw the "muh ebonics" argument in there. It's not a character trait, the second speech bubble shows that. It's just the artist being a retard. Also no, no on talks in broken English/grammar, niggers use ebonics and southern folks often have their own way of saying things but none of those things apply here.

Could just be the design, I mean when you power and open the exit gate it opens by cogs turning.

A lot is happening in this picture

I bring Franklin's Demise on Wraith. I make people DC left and right because they dropped their Purple Flashlight/Toolbox
---
She may be wearing a Miko outfit (Shrine Maiden) which looks similar, but yes it does look closer to Korean traditional wear
---
theres a console exploit?
---
You need to sacrifice 25 Claudettes/Jakes/Megs/Dwithgts to get each mask specific to them, but there is no way to track it that I know of, outside of counting yourself.
---
I need to see Wraith doing the default dance.

Was this PS4?  Because that happened to me last night.  And despite the sexy flexing, I was not lured back in.

Yea, make franks mixtape the menu music since everyone just dcs when they see it

NICE MEME.
---
'The killer forfeits 3 kills just for the one'
---
And you're forfeiting a teammate just for the 3 gens.  
---
If you have time to get three whole gens done while a single person is on the hook that means you all immediately gave up on him right when u saw he was being camped. The laziest way to 'counter' a camping killer is letting someone die without even trying for any type of rescue. It takes no creativity or effort to let a teammate rot as everyone sits on a gen. There is nothing more satisfying as a survivor than getting everyone out and having teammate that was getting hardcore camped escaping in the process. 
---
If the camping killer has NOED active and you can't find the totem that's a different story, but completely ditching a teammate with 3 gens left....LOL!
---
God dang why ..what...I don’t like legion...but I main him..but this is...H E L P

---
The Legion's frenzy is akin to the nurse's blink. Except they takes virtually no skill to actually hit their ability because there's no penalty for missing attacks and its super easy to cheese the timer for the deepwound status. 
---
Because where's against a nurse there's still the element of mind gaming her to miss an attack or use objects around you to block los, with the legion however survivors just can't do anything but go around the loop while legion stabs them four times because you can't avoid the hit and that they can just go over the loops. 
---
There is also the added negative that against legion stealth is also not as viable as an option to play against them as they have a lot of anti stealth attached to their abilities. 
---
On top of that you have the deepwound which turns into another M1 simulator which slows the game down even more for survivor. which many don't find very interactive to play against.
---
What essentially happened was their ability is taken from some of the community's most hated parts of the Nurse, Doctor and Freddy. Which was probably why they had to put so many negatives on the legion on launch. 
---
Wtf

Oh and you arnt toxic? Welp checking your comment history you seem like a crybaby yourself, is survivor that hard for you? 
---
His chainsaw move definitely beats the Hillbilly’s. Far more likely to give you a hit. I guess it’s an unfair comparison because the Hillbilly’s can be used to move you across the map.
---
Blood warden could be active
---
Yah no problem, as you invest more and more time into the game, I recommend you play killer as well as survivor. There are people here that mainly play one side and only play the other side every once in a while, which is just fine because it’s game lol do what’s the most fun do you, but playing each killer and having good knowledge of the different abilities, strengths, and weaknesses as well as general abilities and mechanics that each killer possesses will help you play stronger against those killers when you play survivor, and will lead to less situations where something unusual is happening that catches you off guard or leads to you making a poor play due to lack of game knowledge. 
---
Obv tho licensed killers like Michael cost money so you may not be able to play as him personally, but watching videos every now and then by popular streamers like Zubat or Scott who play those killers and know really good tech for them is useful for learning as well. (Monto is cool to for some interesting and fun builds, and while Tyde has an interesting standing within the community right now, he is a good source of information about the game and covers/explains some of the more controversial aspects of the game like camping, balance, and gen rushing. Some people strongly disagree with some of the stuff he says, and each to their own opinion but for the most part I’d say his discussions/opinions are fairly well founded in reason. Except for that tier list video. That was a big F in chat. Hag and spirit are good killers my guy.) 
---
I’d share more stuff with you but honestly it’s all stuff you’ll find out as you get into the game and interact with the community. Seriously tho, the more you learn about the game and the more you get into it, the more fun it is my guy. Good luck out there in the fog!
---
Edit: if you’re looking for good survivor gameplay, most of the before mentioned people play survivor and are good with them, but people like Noob3 or Demi are good sources of survivor gameplay, and a channel called Ussylsis or something has some good tutorials on various game mechanics for survivors. Just a heads up tho, Demi is a bit crazy.
---
Or maybe it takes time to add a ben system.
---
This makes me hate Legion even more
---
Big T H O N K
---
A paradoxal perk, gets disabled in 10 seconds after match starts but neccesary for high ranks
---
it is punished in game as long as no survivor is nearby. They changed it so if a killer is near a hooked survivor and no survivors are nearby, he loses points while he's there. As long as survivors aren't stupidly rushing in to try to save he is punished. The problem is most survivors abandon gens and go for the save.
---
The same reason anyone does: attention and validation.
---
It’s a bug not an exploit
---
Yah sorry about that, I’ll go ahead and change the names lol
---
Operation failed successfully, continue?
---
Balanced, like all things should be, but what did it costs you?

I don't even buy it lol this is a PR move pure and simple

How did you find it if it was spawned yet? If there are 4 survs alive it doesn't spawn until all gens are done

* *Platform:* PC
---
* *Type of Bug:* SWF Lobby bug
---
* *Description:* In SWF lobby, as soon as we click on "ready" and it says "searching for a game", then few seconds later, i'm thrown into black screen "loading" page while my partner screen is still in lobby with "searching for a game".
---
* *Screenshot / Video:* none
---
* *Steps to reproduce:* Create a SWF lobby, invite a friend, click both READY, then bug is happening on lobby owner.
---
* *Expected result:* It should join a game lobby and at least stay on current lobby with "searching for a game"
---
* *Actual result:* Goes into loop on black "loading screen" for the lobby owner, other friends stays on "searching for a game" in lobby.  Have to manually kill .exe and restart game.
---
* *Reproduction rate:* It happens 50% of time, sometimes less, sometimes more often.
---
* *System Specs (PC only):* doesnt matter, it happens if other friends create lobby too. I7-5960x/gtx980/16GB DDR4
---
They've always been able to ban people. They just haven't because they want to be cheap and cut corners instead of paying people to do the right things. Sony and Microsoft have never had control over what penalties can be applied to misconduct. Only the game developer can. 
---
I mean its bhvr, are you seriously suggesting they wouldn't lie through their teeth when it suits them?
---
I feel like Micheal prefers “Shagadelic.” to something as vulgar as “fuck”.
---
Coincidentally they just happened to finish it right as this exploit is revealed?
---
Just for the fun of it
---
No mention of Wakizashi + Hair Brooch on Spirit? By far my favorite combo. But I agree that prayer beads spirit is extremely strong, especially when coupled with the now buffed surveilance or a totem build.
---
Let’s say you’re playing in red ranks with low survivor count for the hour, you go up against the same killer 3+ times and every time they go for you in particular, they remember your cosmetics to do so, that is targeting, chasing someone you see get unhooked is not
---
From what I saw you just get to prestige 3 to get the bloody clothes. How would they be able to get all the add ons and offerings?
---
&gt;It lets teammates more easily locate items you've found but not taken. Rather than dropping it somewhere and hoping they'll see it, they themselves can approach the chest and see what's in it. This is especially true if your teammates have abilities that see chest auras.
---
Or you know... You can drop the item next to the chest like a normal player would and not in the middle of the fucking forest wtf are you on about
---
Totally agree with the Anna, Phil, and Susie placement.
---
...heh guys uh w-we can suddenly ban on console now...please dont do any exploits or anything or else you’ll get uh banned...heh. 
---
People like you, who cant think of the other side, make this game unfun. Just the way you put time on writing that, I can tell u are a horrible person.
---
THERE IS NO WAY IT CAN BE THAT GENS ARE PERFECTLY BALANCED /s
---
What killer is that?
---
same exact concept but with the bloodweb. they have to line up and then you fake buy it on one web and then switch to the other web. Infinite ebony moris if the entity hasnt spawned because the bloodweb wont progress

Those are generally in red and white aren't very frilly, though

Leader hasn’t been effecting people healing or unhooking me, or it just doesn’t appear that way on my screen. Played game for a while, and pretty sure it was progressing at normal speed

Exactly. I have a friend who altered his save file (back when it could be done) quite drastically and nothing became of their account. 
---
What if my game crashes? Will it still count against me?
---
Hey Look! The Horse is okay :D
---
Thank God 
---
I mean, if we're being honest there are no wires leading from the gens to the Gates. They not really powered by electricity, just Entity magic.
---
That’s exactly what it means
---
Michael can say anything. It's confirmed in the actual Halloween time line that he can speak but chooses not to. 
---
How tho someone help me I'm dumb

heh guys we can uh ban now so dont do any exploits or anything youll get banned uh please?
---
controller exploit, so technically yes but not really
---
As far as I can tell, the opening piano playing is loud, but it's never been ear shattering for me. Rest of the audio in game has been fine though.
---
When this happened to me, the name of the place where you start never went away, no skill check, only the noise, I had to DC and got nasty messages from the other players. 
---
It also counters Borrowed Time.
---
Not that it really matters since you'll probably wait out the effect as they fall asleep.
---
Legitimate concern. Id guess that this would be handled similar to other games that count DCing as an offense and youd have a specific number of DCs in a specific time frame before youd be in trouble

---
Getting to the hook isn’t a problem so they would die anyway. All this does is give you a way to do a mori without paying. I honestly don’t think a single perk should guarantee a win without exception. BT can save multiple people but I can very well stop a wounded survivor from leaving. DS kicks me out of the game so the survivor could escape. Only “skill” in that is not using DS and waiting for the last guy to die. You can also punish teabaggers in a really good way. Survivors could stay at the gate to make sure the killer can’t get the mori. 
---
Damn.. That's amateur level managing.
---
play anybody else and just put any BP you get into bubba. So i played survivor with WGLF and put all the bloodpoints into bubba instead of playing him 
---
If you enjoy shutting down loops, trust me you'll love it. Especially since now sounds are fixxed, Spirit is in a really good place (even more with that combo). The best time to be alive.
---
This, except Sloppy instead of STBFL and Bloodhound as my filler for the extra tracking help. I usually put down traps at a pallet during a chase so it helps when I lose line of sight.
---
No way for them to remove it off your accounts,  and it’s a pretty common achievement, as friendlies exist.
---
They can still struggle off.
---
it essentially allows you to get p3 on as many characters as you want and infinite items  
---
Yea maybe you can just push the pistons down on 5 generators and pull them back up to temporarily power the gate 
---
Ds doesnt guarentee an escape unless the gates are open. Most of the time it's a chase extender and it's an overrated perk 
---
How many times has that happened?
---
Use old reddit
---
If you are next to the hatch and DS me you have won. Not talking about the exit gates. 
---
friend did it on my huntress and myers cause he saw it on the sub and thought i was a good thing and i might be fucked now
---
You can easily end the game if you get stuck out there, he just needs to step across the barrier which would trigger the exit animation to begin 
---
But I like new Reddit.
---
It's just because my friend is always playing as meg and I stared associating megs voice as my friends and I thought "what if she really did have his voice?" 😂😂
---
lmao. You jest, but I remember genuinely being impressed the first time I saw the clown mori simply because it had that little bit of "dismemberment"
---
Show how low the bar is for this game.
---
oh yeah I just know people would rather exploit it for the OP shit like syringes and moris rather than more bloodpoints for everyone
---
Obviously not if you're complaining about it.
---
No he's at max speed in ew2 he just gets a better lunge
---
thank you! I thought this was saying you didn't have to buy him and I was like what 
---
*angry British grunt* He sounds like how David should
---
At least a dozen times for me, I've had a few survivors escape off my shoulder before too when playing killer. It isn't THAT uncommon. Even easier with perks like Boil Over.
---
Except theres alot more context to that*
---
I was running hex: hunters (something I forgot)
---
Your team is giving the killer a chance to win the game. Remember that even though there's 5 players, one of them is absolutely needed more than others for a game to happen.
---
That would look so cool, but they would probably be accused of stealing the ''spine rip'' from the movie ''Predator'' though. Trapper could have different Moris, one when he has a trap where he jams a Survivor's head into it them stomps it (like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/8sfiie/im_a_trapper_main_so_i_decided_to_make_the_mori/)) and another where he mostly cuts them up with his weapon.

---
I like to try to atleast get one pallet used during some of the earlier chases. In the middle of the map if they are near a bunch of pallets they can simply run to another one after using one to escape, so let the run away and take your small victory of decreased map safety and apply pressure to generators away from pallet sanctuaries 
---
Lol didn't notice

What? How the fuck? No way, you are totally saying that just for your point. If there is no one in the game and you get downed you are done for. Only 2 ways that can happen is the Game with its crappy hook placement and I guess boil over in very specific situations. I.e. swamp pantry, lery, game, and I guess if you are playing against an absolute moron lol. Walking to a hook isn’t hard to do and boil over works as often as tenacity without swf and knockout.

I'm much better with bubba than Billy on console

If you're next to hatch chances are that it's a hatch standoff. Also you can waste a person's ds prior to that happening, I just used it as an example. Itd be a free win for the killer if he could just mori that last survivor who wasted a perk slot the whole match

---
Half the time someone unhooks ME with We'll Make It while the killer is on the other side if the map and runs off. Like hello?????
---
Or the killer doesn't see the close hook because it isn't highlighted, or nearby hooks were already used, or I managed to get down far enough from hooks, or a survivor has DS or boil over to get off or delay longer enough.
---
These are very valid things. And again, this is a buff that killers don't need.
---
If they had used the DS and weren’t near the hatch and got downed they will be hooked anyway. There are very few (like extremely small) situations where you could wiggle off as everyone has already left. Technically they didn’t waste the slot because if they stun me in about a 20 meter radius of the hatch without enduring they win.
---
seriously: the worst Wraits are those who wear that fucking Halloween skin; all the time they have fucking NOED and fucking Sloppy #BloodEverywhere #FPSDropsout Butcher, and most frustrating thing ... they camp and tunnel the unhooked survivor until he reach the third stage ... all the time.

This is mainly for streamers who gets sniped a lot by the same people, killers that will facecamp/tunnel/spam mori on them. But I guess it can work on other players too, otherwise u/laivu6 is right.

Then nothing will improve and people become complacent with it. Like it or not, it won't be long before "new reddit" is normal reddit. If you're fine using old reddit then go ahead, I think new reddit on this sub looks like shit and a simple font color change is all they would need to do.
---
It’s not hard to find hooks even with the 10-15 meter reduction. If I see a hook disappear I know I can still hook them. The fact that DS can guarantee an escape if you get downed near the hatch or exit gate is dumb and this is more of tiny DS nerf and gives killers a way to mori survivors without a paid item. The wiggle bar isn’t for escaping, it’s to stop the basement being used every time. 
---

Enduring isn't especially for palet stuns, it helps a lot against a decisive strikes. And it allow you to not respect palet at all. But good choices anyway. :)
---
The hatch was opened by another survivor using a key and only stays open for 30 seconds. The only time the hatch doesn’t close is when you’re the last survivor remaining with at least two gens done. 
---
Would have***
---
&gt;Honing stone is the other kinda surprising pick. It seems to rarely pay off and is outcompeted by other purple (like extra traps or even the color change on some maps)
---
I feel like you're totaly right that the honing stone's effectiveness is very limitet especially against SWF. However, I've had a lot of use from the honing stone where I am chasing a survivor and don't need to wory to catch the other survivor. If they want to free that guy that stepped in a random trap, then that will be 3 people not doing gens. I do agree that there are probably better picks. I just like the confort of not being pressured to imidiately go over to a trapped survivor
---
&gt;I'm pretty shocked you think so highly of the hand, which seems like an inferior shoe (both give up teleport but you get a lot more from the shoe).
---
I'm thinking the total oposite
---
&gt;I have yet to see it used well and it seems like you have to do a lot of set up (don't you need several traps to wall off a pallet?) for minimal pay off.
---
Just placing 1 trap in the middle of a pallet totaly prevents a survivor from going trough the pallet or dropping it down, usually they don't expect it and first run into an "invisible wall" for a few seconds. The hand doesn't get used often, so I've run into a lot of survivors (at high ranks) that don't seem to figuer out that the thing thats blocking them is the trap (funny end game chat results). It doesn't require more setup than a regular hag, just place the trap at a place in a strong loop where the survivors don't have the option to just go around and it's a free hit for you. The only underwelming part about these traps I've noticed so far is that survivors can just run trough them after you hit them. The big difference between this and normal hag traps is that you put these ones on places you should never put regular hag traps. One trap at killer shack and the survivors can't use the god pallet, 2 traps at killer shack and the survivors can't loop you. 3 traps at killer shack and the survivors can't get to their hooked buddy in the basement without removing the traps. Same goes for totems, survivors can't walk over your traps and will have to get rid of them if they want to get rid of your totem: note that this only works when your totem is in a snall corner.
---
&gt;Grandma's heart is absolutely amazing. It throws me off when surviving and see it work at all ranks. I can't believe anyone would dislike it.
---
Can't deny with you when you put it like that. Could confusion is indeed a strong tool
---
&gt;it seems like you pretty much place traps near pallets etc?
---
I don't do that. I always place one in the middle of killer shack, I place one on the edges of map specific big loops, I place them at my hooks, if there aren't many generators left, I place them there. Basically, I place them at spots where I could lose a lot of time chasing people or where they have a high chance of tripping.
---
This isn't the case with mint rag or the hand. With mint rag I place them at my totems and at the hooks. Also at the generators in specific cases (mainly when my totems somehow got destroyed). As for the hand, I already told you, this is the addon where I place it in the middle of pallets or one way vaultable windows.
---
&gt;That might be why you don't get a lot of use from other add ons.
---
I do get use from other addons, but the ones mentioned are by far my favorites and I've gotten the most use out of them

I’m on Xbox and I had a match against this one guy who was going out of his way to pull my attention to him. He threw down a pallet and kept jumping over it until I showed up, blinded me with a flashlight with 2 batteries if I tried to break the pallet, then ran me into a cornfield where he’d nonstop 360 with dead hard and decisive to get away if I ever did hit him. And when I’d decide to cut my losses and go after other survivors, he’d throw down another pallet and repeat the process.
---
I never did understand the key
---
Thank you! 
---
that would let her play just like she, hoffman and john do in in the movies where they sit and wait for a good opportunity and then strike
---
the closest thing you can get to that now is Amanda's letter + Video tape with a perk build along the lines of M&amp;A-Whispers-Tinkerer-(Perk of your choice) but its only like a 12 meter range and that kinda sucks. but yea i agree we need more jumpscare addons in general like T1 myers (or as my friends like to call it the boyfriend Michael build XD)
---
Sun is shining in the sky there ain’t a cloud in sight
---
It says in the rules you arent allowed to avoid bans by switching platforms. So i dont think he'll be fine.
---
No problem!
---
The wiggle bar isn't for escaping? Are you seriously going to be firm on something that stupid? Then why the fuck do they have perks about the fucking wiggle bar?
---
Your mori buff is retarded and so are your moronic justifications for a buff that doesn't need to happen. Nerf DS itself or buff killers in a way that will actually help them.
---
He hid the escapes... rip red ranks that did worse then the 12.
---
Here's [the full scene](https://youtu.be/rf5SCa0NqbM). It's from Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult. 
---
Yep, it's not every game but must high ranks will just begin the game searching for it.  
---
When you consider that sloppy buys you something like \~32 seconds total (assume 4 seconds of extra healing per heal off a hook), it's still the best perk to slow things down.  
---
Not so much toxic in game as in real life. Literally ask every female fan he has for nudes within there first conversation lmao
---
When it happens to me I can only see the game (if that makes sense) I can’t see what perks I have, skill checks or options like “press this button to vault”
---
Last time it happened to me (yesterday) I DCed and got called a coward lol. Luckily I explained what happened and they apologised so all’s good. 
---
It's from the 3rd movie, not the first
---
Oh yeah, I always run charge time addons when I play billy.
---
But I guess it closes even though all gens are done?  That’s what happen to us
---
Exactly. That is the exact skin
---
If they use ds and dont know where hatch is, when they get off your shoulder they can stumble apon it. Discounting the posibility cause it's "extremely small" means it's still possible, it has happened before guarenteed. If survivor is injured and is getting chased theyre already disadvantaged, using ds can give them a chance to find hatch.
---
Why does it go one way and not the other? You're saying "If they stun me in about a 20 meter range radius of the hatch without enduring they win" but if you get to mori them, and they still have Ds, yeah they did waste a perk slot and you wasted nothing but losing one of your kills when you already have 3. With a mori, you auto win. With ds, they can auto win but they wasted a perk slot and can be dribbled.
---
The little ''crow'' written on the bird lol, nice meme my dude.
---
There's a very rare and an ultra rare that keep the hatch open for a certain amount of time but will close once the timer's up

Did you even read what I wrote?

The little ''crow'' written on the bird lol, nice meme my dude. I used to have Calm Spirit equipped almost every time but then i stopped using it as Crows normally don't cause too much of a trouble. The new Spies of the Shadows buff is making me want to use it again now though.
---
Yes, it probably does. Your game would have to be crashing very consistently for it to become a problem though. I wouldnt worry about it if you dont DC from matches on the regular

lol no

Yup lol

I read this in Monto's voice.
---
It's the hag riding Maurice
---
Funny enough, I ran into the same survivors twice, then another group twice as well. Kates were plentiful
---
Yes, I understand that there is a possibility that they could wiggle or whatever. I could say that there is a possibility, if small, that I wouldn’t find another survivor the entire game and they escape without being seen. The wasted nothing part of your reply just doesn’t make sense. This would be a gameplay feature, not a perk or offering. This is simply a way to include moris to normal gameplay. It’s dumb that I’m locked out of moris or a core gameplay feature just cause of rng. How would you implement moris to the game then? You can say my idea ain’t to good but at least have your own.

---
So like do you still have 1000 hours? If so how long before the urge to play this game comes back.
---
i don't get it! what happened?
---
Can't not have him there xD
---
"lmao it's probably just a woman"
---
No, it’s actually plained, silly thing 
---
He had enough of entitys shit
---
It’s a peaceful life. 
---
sure if you don't mind walking everywhere. Sprint Burst is ass now.
---
I’m not saying justified attacking you It’s understandable to be angry after a game against legion due to the fact they also just want to play the game and have fun against killers they can counter. Try to look at it from their perspective when playing against legion the only thing you can do is run in a strait line to gain distance. Mind games are impossible due to his fast attack speed.  
---
Yeah I saw that, that actually makes me pretty happy because that means Microsoft/Sony is allowing them that access. I’m gonna be honest with you it kind of puts a bad taste in my mouth though that they ignored things until an exploit came out that let people progress faster on a character, now they’re gung ho about banning. But the toxicity and exploits that let survivors win games easily for what feels like forever now were wholly ignored.
---
How do i do this
---
Omg. Thank you for the laugh. 
---
It is now possible, according to BHVR. See Twitter post [here](https://twitter.com/deadbybhvr/status/1088889415131381762?s=21).
---
Idk, I'm not BHVR 
---
What's sarcasm
---
What are those Meg jeans?
---
I'm 85% sure that the female Legion voices are just Huntress' voice with slight varations. (They don't throw a tempertantrum when stunned)
---
The only tape that's run is Frank's, and knowing that Legion has Frank's really doesn't add much "counterplay."
---
Amusing, considering I'm the correct one in this conversation and the two of you are mistaken. Incorrect grammar isn't a problem in written speech because it's naturally occurring in spoken conversation. It's used to add flavor and nuance to a character's speech patterns, and to make them feel more natural and organic. Or should I correct your post and say it's "You're" and "lol" because those are technically correct and "ur" and "lawl" are not?
---
Always amazes me when someone tries to insult someone else only to prove themselves the fool.
---
Looks like he bout to kick some ass

"I think we did a pretty good JOB"
---
Exactly, I'm glad I didn't do the glitch anyways, and bans are kinda necessary in multiplayer games... (Also sorry if I have a bad grammar, English is not my main language)
---
I totally understand their frustration, however, I don’t understand them coming at me because of a character the devs made, not me. Whenever I go against a nurse or legion, I usually comment on how unfun the killers themselves are to play against, but I never go after the player for just trying to play a game.
---
Can't allow that. The Grind is the game. Without the grind, there's no game. There's nothing keeping people playing , except for the people who really want to play it.
---
It works on keyboard too. Home and End swap your character. 
---
No problem! 
---
I instantly recognized this comic so I browsed through everyone I follow on tumblr to find it
---
i never heard of it ,explain further in pm plz :)
---
heck
---
The switch is also super laggy and slow, it’s quicker to just go to the killer menu. 
---
Can you substantiate any of this beyond "konami can do it!"?
---
*Gets pallet stunned*  
---
What survivors hear: "OEURRGH"  
---
What Myers hears: "FUCK!"
---
LMAO WTF bro... I have over 6.4k hours on this game and I've never seen that shit happen. Crazy
---
What I'm saying is that if they run ds theyre wasting a perk slot while if this becomes a feature the killer can make the chance of survivor escaping basically 0 because there is no need to carry them to hook, giving killer the 4k. 
---
While in the current situation, for what you claim when you said if they get off your shoulder in a 20 meter range at hatch they get a free win, they still wasted a perk slot the whole match for it. If a yellow mori became a feature the killer wasted nothing to get his auto win because it's a feature.
---
I think the green mori is fine but the yellow mori should be changed or removed (increasing green mori appearance in bloodweb slightly maybe) while the pink mori needs a change.
---
Also youre locked out of the moris due to rng because they're powerful. You have to upgrade your character to get good stuff. 
---
Also hatch needs a rework
---
Always ignore that guy so he's wasting his time, not yours.
---
The harder someone tries to get my attention, the harder I bootyblast their boosted friends
---
I mean honestly you’ll likely lost reddit points for posts like this one
---
you should have replied "no u"
---
Healing when you have the occasion, because Wraith is a killer that tracks survivors on their blood

---
My best guess is DLC perks? Even then you don't need to pay to get them...
---
im surprised as you are never heard of it as well someone explain it through pm. 
---
I guess this ain’t it chief
---
We all died, but too be fair the killer had 300 ping
---
No, the wiggling bar isn't just a mechanic to prevent always using basement hooks. It's also a way for survivors to be rewarded for sabotaging hooks, leading a killer to a location with no available hooks, and for running boil over. I don't like DS, but I dont think it's fair or good game design to simply buff killers to indirectly nerf a perk because it removes depth and gameplay decisions that survivors can make.
---
 Not that you deserve hatemail, but if you play Legion, expect for everyone to be pissed. Nobody likes playing against Legion.
---
If you understand their frustration why would you post this... You’re posting this about their reaction which is nothing special, no funny insults or nothing over the top, just average insults. This post is so stupid contributes nothing except “players mad at legion and vent rage”.
