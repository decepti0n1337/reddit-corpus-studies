Im gonna chase this mfker with another mfker
---
---
---
Thank you for the nostalgia
---
Bugged from the beginning of the match. I‚Äôve had this happen a few times, and it‚Äôs really frustrating when it‚Äôs a good match. You‚Äôre actually still making progress on certain actions it just doesn‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm not mistaken. Same applies for when healing and getting healed.
---
On a Monday? Very unlikely. 
---

---
Then again, nothing stops BHVR from becoming unpredictable out of nowhere so we'll see. It would definitely break their pattern.
---
There are two kinds of people evidently.
---
This has been coming up for me as soon as the game is about to load for a little over a week now
---
What's the song from the "loading into lobbies" one?
---
I feel you its so difficult but i found i get it best when i actually feel like playing the killer and my mind set isnt on getting the acheivment but simply just trying to kill all the survivors
---
Technically there are such things as tactical DCs. The second to last survivor can DC after they get downed to open up the hatch for the last survivor. It's quicker than letting urself die on the hook and also prevents slug 4Ks. But at that point you already lost anyways so what's the real point unless you are trying to stop a toxic killer from getting a 4K.
---
Not at all since they do it at different times and thrilling is more of a counter pick to bbq. Also it's a hex perk and tbh it seems fairly balanced. Maybe lower the seconds by 5 for each level tho
---
Yes spine chill still works. You can also use it to tell what direction she's going if she uses it mid chase.
---
Impressive that the camera dind't broke,Jesus Nea and Quentin in the same screen, i think i heard a "crack" on my screen üòÆ
---
Let's not pretend like you're not running it for the BP eh
---
why does the revealing noise last forever
---
I was wondering this as well. I haven‚Äôt received any rewards lately.
---
Lmao
---
No one would go for hooks Lmao
---
Damn that‚Äôs annoying. Thanks for explaining man!
---
Or maybe just maybe you can fix it now and stop bitching about something that 0.0000000000001% of the player base had an issue with.
---
They should give Burrowed Time a one time use only instead of infinite since it's pretty much the strongest survivor perk.
---
Yea. I‚Äôve had this same sort of thing happen trying to let people leave through hatch or whatever. Stop struggling when there‚Äôs no hope left. I‚Äôm trying to spare you, but I do this on my terms, lol.
---
a 3% reduction isnt too much, that is about .4 seconds on a generator... If its removed when hooked or healed it should be like 10% to make it important to get rid of I would say
---
Clear the pool is what Surge should be, I like this perk
---
Wow 55 k bp on survivors how dude
---
It doesn't matter because it's in the game and doesn't prevent the game from ending because the survivor will bleedout if the killer just mori cancels the entire time. It's absolutely a BM thing to do, but so it tbaging, flashlight clicking, and spamming a pallet/locker. None of those prevent the game from advancing, and thus should not be bannable no matter how annoying it is.
---
I've had that happen to me b4 too. It happens if you pick them up right as the game is ending
---
This is me every game.
---
Nancy: Demi, NO
---
Demi: yis
---
Nancy: DEMI
---
Nancy: GET OUT OF HERE DEMI
---
Demi: :(
---
If you mage to go to tractor on rotten fields it can be pretty annoying if u play it right
---
Yes because t bagging as you infinite loop with balanced landing while in a chase is just fellow camaraderie.
---
Well, yeah, Identity V is better in general. It just has more Survivor abuse.
---
I haven't been getting the daily rewards for the past few days either. But on teachables. With Meg (at least this was how it was for me). Q&amp;Q at 20. Sprint Burst at 30 and Adrenaline at 40.
---
This are all really good, great job!
---
Thank you, I do.
---
Sometimes the Mori is faster than carrying someone to a hook, and you completely counter Decisive Strike, Flashlight or pallet saves, bodyblocks, sabos. So it would not strictly be detrimental to your game. And survivors have nothing that compares to the game-shifting power of an Ebony, by quite some margin. As it stands, burning an Ebony all but guarantees your win if you are a somewhat competent killer.
---
I agree with the proposal of making Moris only be usable once every survivors has been hooked. That way they could not be combined with the already strong tactic of tunelling, and would not be quite as devastating to groups of survivors who otherwise lose their first member very early on, crippling their chances of survival before the game has even really begun.
---
Especially sucks if you have a good game, with the anticipation of escaping... and you just keep on running.
---
Cool. I may start using Spine Chill more.
---
You killed em to fast lol
---

[removed]
---
Can the mods classify this beaten to death meme as oversaturated content already and remove these posts?
---
Mr. Ding Dong was my first killer. I can usually down* all the survivors with him. but that has a lot to do with how infrequently I play killer, which allows for me to group with rank 20s, vs the fact that for once in my life I'm pretty decent at this game.
---
I really enjoy toying with overly altruistic players even though I know it's wrong, but I do try to balance this by letting the match run on and letting players go every now and again.
---
* as in knockdown and not hooked.
---
Kates new outfit with brown hair üëåüèª
---
I try smacking the gens or I pick them up and start spinning them to let them know I wanna farm  and let them struggle out... most the time it works but some people don‚Äôt get it or don‚Äôt wanna farm...
---
do it after rank reset, as you just need a double pip to get a merciless
---
Because shrine bloodpoints baby
---
Wouldnt say avg. This is pretty shit
---
Lead a chase on and don‚Äôt kill them as soon as you can
---
That whole first paragraph is ironically oozing arrogance. Why do you think it‚Äôs near-impossible to lose as a good killer, but not as a good survivor?
---
I don't mind because if I know they're at the gate I waste their efforts by going on my phone lol.
---
People who complain about people not playing the new stuff are the same ones who burst a vein if any bugs slip through.
---
I know but if you already got a perk that's in the shrine you get bloodpoints and I need as much as I can get
---
At least NOED did it's job. Too bad it had to come down to it.
---
I've had this happen before. Usually its one of 3 things. 
---
1) they are super immersed and dont realize what you are doing or have gotten burnt by people pretending to let them go just to grab them off the gate switch
---
2) they figure they can go get a free item since you are going to let them go anyway
---
3) they for some reason are looking for hatch escape even though you closed it already
---
Are you being overly stupid on purpose? What about at the endgame when the killer is most likely going to be around the people they hook as they want to secure kills? By extension should Decisive Strike just be a game mechanic and not a perk? Also were you not around when borrowed time procced on both survivors? This isnt broken by any stretch.

Step 1: Spam the button. Step 2: butt dance. Step 3: ??? Step 5: Nea
---
Killers should be awarded all dropped items still on the map post-game, either to allocate to their Survivors and encourage crossplay or to dispense to baby Survivors they find/use as bait.
---
When endgame goes off during the pick up animation, the survivor doesn't die, but also can't move or be interacted with, a killer has done this to me and I was stuck in a game for 1 and a half hours bc I didn't want to dc
---
Pain Reliever would disapprove of your outfit.
---
That‚Äôs most likely just a place holder
---
They hate him cause he spoke the truth.
---
actually insane
---
I figure it‚Äôs not terrible because of the fact there are 3 DLC perks. Rather than non dlc.
---
A bit shitty but it's understandable since we had great shrines lately
---
Uncultured console players.
---
This is a code red! Ebony Mori omega blink nurse inbound! Sometimes you just gotta have a little fun yourself. It's nice to just chill. Plus there's salt, so what can go wrong?
---
I really don't kill them insta. I even take them to the gens and drop them sometimes. I just have so many people DCing. I really am not a toxic player. I don't kill rush, I try not to tunnel. I Chase them to let them get those good BP of course. But I play the game in a fun way I think.
---
In moderation. My guidelines for myself: is it fun, unpredictable, situational, dramatic, and most importantly, does it keep the momentum going or does it slow it to a crawl?
---
So I try not to go overboard even when I'm playing Infectious Fright or Knock-out. My Killer gameplay needs to feel like suspense and action, not like picking out snacks at a gas station
---
They‚Äôre just upset that you‚Äôre killing them. They‚Äôre the type of Survivor that just wants to escape every single type and thinks they‚Äôre a god.
---
Its stupid. Matchmaking currently just takes one of the ranks from SWF and picks a killer from that. You got fucked by rng mate.
---
nah, because if you want to use sprintburst for just running when to a gen when you know killer is distracted you can't. Its very similar, and could be very helpful, but has a bit different of a restriction. It does have the benefit tho of allowing you to run around and not waste sprint burst. So its like, "i get the ability to sprint normally, at the cost of a slightly more specific sprint burst"
---
Best way to signal you wanna farm is to let someone escape your grasp. But you also need to accept that a lot of people dont want to farm, so you should blame anyone for dcing. It wastes people's time. Maybe try to find a group on discord or something to farm with.
---
Just to find a Cypress Mori that you might use, if you're really lucky.

---
Alright, maybe it's arrogant of me to say that. I don't know if people think I'm saying wiggling in general is stupid, I mean wiggling when you're the last alive. With other people you've got bodyblocking and flashlights that can save you or delay the killer while you wiggle. When it's just you, there's nothing.
---
Realistically, you aren't going to escape after you've been downed as the last survivor. Why not just stay still and see what the killer does?
---
The entire purpose of it is to taunt the killer and anyone that says otherwise probably tbags all the time and doesn't care about the message it sends. Its unempathetic at best.
---
That being said, I've gotten used to tbaggers after 1500 hours and I love it when survivors waste valuable time in chases to tbag after a pallet instead of getting more distance.
---
I think the default is better. Solid grey/blue works in most maps. It's that Terror Radius though. Smaller, the better.
---
I have Iron Will and Dead Hard. Gens aren't getting done so just rush the objective
---
I get the not farming aspect. Just wanna play. But people just keep DCing. I wanna have fun with everyone but as hexy says "toxic diaper babies." I've been playing with some wraiths lately and their are toxic players. Is it because I'm playing him?
---
It‚Äôs a good perk if combined with others such as Quick and Quiet and Lithe.
---
I did the exact opposite yesterday, hatch spawned walked past it without any hesitation and hooked the guy
---
Not like he got to use his Prove Thyself with the other people being snobs.
---
Doesn‚Äôt bother me because I think it‚Äôs a useful form of communication.
---
‚ÄúHeal me‚Äù- when wounded
---
‚ÄúSorry‚Äù - when you blow a gen

‚ÄúFuck you‚Äù - to the Killer

Typical, the bias killer mains are down voting this topic into oblivion. This sub is hilarious. Create a thread suggesting anything that helps survivors, DOWN VOTED. Create a thread suggesting anything that helps killers, UP VOTED TO FRONT PAGE. These killer mains have never had it so easy as killer, yet they still whine at every opportunity, attempting to get any useful survivor tools nerfed.
---
What bother me survivors is tea bagging everyone and not doing objectives you just wasted my time as survivor. 
---
When killers take the game hostage so much and doesn‚Äôt want to end. Same as survivors tea bag at exit gate. 
---
Basically anything that players do intentionally that lead to me being wasting time and not having fun I consider it toxic behavior.
---
Thats the problem right there. You have a hitbox that your animation is supposed to go with.
---
If your animation doesnt go with the hitbox then its a problem because you are showing me one thing but giving me another.
---
Sure you could learn ‚Äúthe cone‚Äù but for more casual players and people who arent that invested to game comes off as broken and unfair and they are correct. Its unfair to play an animation that doesnt go accordingly with the hitbox.
---
Just because one thing is toxic doesn't mean another thing is not lol, pretty interesting logic there. Those are both toxic. But it's all about context, survivors tbag at each other sometimes in a non-taunting way, for example.
---
Agreed, I've gotten 4 or 5 adept killers just going about my business completing my dailies
---
Just depends. 
---
I always feel like I have to slug at least one surv when I‚Äôm playing against high ranked guys. 
---
Makes it way harder for the survs to find a slug then a hooked surv. 
---
I might lose track of them or they might get healed but that takes WAY longer than pulling them off a hook. 
---
Plus it gives me tons of time to go looking around for survs who probably think I‚Äôm busy hooking or guarding a slug. 
---
That‚Äôs what I instantly thought when you explained that, your Rank 1 and he found you early. Probably figured he could catch the babies off guard and leave you alone for a few minutes instead of playing Guard the Hook.
---
I'd normally agree with you but moris feel like a balance to save you from a full team of ds, bt, dh, adrenaline, insta heals, and keys. If these things were not so powerful I'd probably be inclined to agree, as I do feel they're really strong. However what they're up against is also really powerful, which is why is disagree.
---
That's what I was talking about. I don't go to the gates bc there's no point in watching them tbag then run out right before you hit them. That's why I tab out once I see a gate open and the rest of them staying in the game when I killed the people I could.
---
Not even perk feng, I'm disappointed
---
Well it's not every time of course. Someone puts in a birthday cake hell ya that obviously means farm right? This game everyone but one DCed and I was gunna let the guy run around and I'd Chase him. For some blood points atleast. But I let him go next to the gate and he DCed I'm like oh come on man.
---
I have a deep wound from that
---
Yes.
---
I'm disappointed I laughed at this
---
Restart......has to do with the ps4 remembering your best route to ps servers. Restarting clears that cache. Sleep mode while the game is loaded up causes this.
---
Finally dance with me, the last perk for my anti-spirit build üôÉ
---
It's almost as if they want to kill the player base...
---
New killer main, how do you play as the wraith?
---
If your getting 3 manned by a camper you're trash plain and simple, leave the fucker to die and gen rush it's an easy win
---
Are you rank 21?
---
Idk. It's pretty strong as it is and I think it's fine as a perk. If it was base mechanic it would promote (even more) unsafe hooks.
---
Detectives Hunch gang
---
Leatherface. Then meyers, then billy. 
---
Ditch lf for billy/meyers at rank 7. 
---
All 3 need u to run bbq, enduring, spirit fury, ruin. Period.  Youre welcome.  Run noed until u have all 4. 
---
Most of the advice is shit. Lol have fun getting 4 escaped and tbagged w wraith.
---
God, those hook distances really irritate me. I was anticipating a break out.
---
It is so fucking evil i love it
---
Tabbing out when people won't leave feels pretty good haha. Feels a lot better than walking across the map just to force them out, and robbing them of the satisfaction is soooo satisfying.
---
Yasss. Want Tenacity so much.
---
Attention seeker would get abused so much
---
Hexy got banned for mori cancelling a survivor a few times, so the devs have established the precedent that Survivor BM = ok, Killer BM = ban
---
Some people can't stand losing.
---
'Reborn' from the Hereditary OST

Let's take a moment to realise the Dany going mad and Jon killing her will be the book ending too. The actual plot isn't bad, the writing is. I bet the books will go over it much better and it'll make sense

Actually rank 7 survivor, but I attribute most of it to luck. This game is going to be dead by 5 years time if things keep going the way they are.
---
No worries good thing about rooms is they have 3 more walls!
---
sick
---
You realize everything needs a counter to be considered "fair" right? Having a 100 second long period of untouchability that can't be countered by Enduring anymore isn't fair. Especially when everyone and their mother's cat runs it. 400 seconds of no touching or 20 total seconds of stun time is ridiculous.
---
Im just, not going to argue with you anymore.
---
It's weird, you have all the memes, then in-game, it usually isn't true. I had a full team Dwight gang one time, then we got moried by Freddy:(
---
Killer BM = Ban Survivor BM = Ok
---
Head On last week and now Dance with Me, is it truly random ?
---
okey that is hilarious
---
This would be better for Bubba. The main reason I don't play him is because his Chainsaw is useless 80% of the time. Charging takes to long on top of reducing your movement speed, which allows the person whose ass you were just up in to get out of range of it.
---
Definitely, not sure why that didn't happen tbh. Grabs have been really finnicky lately, I can't seem to grab a survivor when they vault for the life of me.

Option 1. Spend almost all your time cloaked, uncloak only when youre pretty much right up on the survivor (not applicable mid chase unless your using windstorm or something similar), body block pallets and windows while invisible to get hits, abuse windstorm add ons to get hits
---
Option 2. Play Spirit instead, Wraith is one of the worst killers in the game and gets only worse and worse as you gain ranks, I wouldnt bother getting used to him. If you only have access to base game killers than try Hag (free on console), Billy, or Nurse (she is pretty much only viable on PC though).

How long is the "black offering"?

Thanks man, I try to be a bro whenever I play Kavid Ding.

I thought they fixed this with, like, the plague patch?

this meme got unfunny after the 100th time

Lucky
---
Just to add a note about Wraith. He is awesome for farming though. Great for points except Sacrifice. However, since you would get a lot of points, you'll rank up quick. And eventually encounter survivors that will loop you so bad you'll get no points sometimes.
---
"As a killer main" Said the survivor main, hoping people would believe it.
---
Not to be rude but why does everyone like nerfing fast vaults so much
---
Had it happen maybe 4 times so far in about 6 month usually restating sorts it
---
Just ignore them. They can cry about pretend rules all they want.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs shitty. None of these perks are too bad, but we‚Äôve been spoiled recently
---
slugging and tunneling isn't fun, hence why people dislike it.
---
On a side note, what are blood gems for?
---
Loop?
---
Agitation and remember are two of my personal favorite perks.  Agitation is so, unbelievably under rated and remeber me is awfully easy to get your stacks, especially after the change.
---
So literally cant offer any rebuttal, and just acts like a pompous buffoon instead. *rolls eyes* 
---
You didnt have the word exposed in there before, and "working like a regular hex but only lighting up when active" is an oxymoron. You cant work like a regular hex AND work like it does now. 
---
Run away like the chicken shit you are though.
---
I only know because I run the WGLF + PT combo too, we're all sluts for BP.
---
And I'm not talking camping like you would if there's teammates around. I'm talking full blown face camping.
---
My birthday! I'm hoping so but the real question is if I'll have enough money to get it then
---
But if the killer sees that the last person isn‚Äôt dying immediately then they‚Äôll know they have deliverance and just camp
---
She can counter spinechill by looking away
---
Remember me suffered a bad nerf. It‚Äôs underrated but definitely niche.
---
It would be nice if they could change it back to only requiring to get a 4K. It‚Äôs ridiculous how easy it is to get survivor adepts compared to killer adepts..
---
Every single survivor I face teabags :)
---
3 gens in general is pretty good
---
The iridescent shards? You use them to buy perks from the Shrine of Secrets, buy some outfits, and buy unlicensed killers
---
What does sfw mean?
---
im not sure what you mean
---
Your wraith idea is literally just "Beast" mud (I think) and Swift Hunt combined.
---
Every single survivor points at me sooo toxic
---
normally they stand in front of the hook anyway
---
So I've been playing this game for a while and I'm really sure if this question belongs here or not but I have been accused of lagswitching a game as killer to win. They said they even had video evidence and was getting everybody they knew to report me. This was a few days after hurricane Dorian hit and I just got my power back on and so did my ISP. It worked well for a little while but the Internet went really slowly near the end of the game and I eventually lost connection. This was my first game of that day.
---
Anyways. How do I go against this accusation? I really love this game and I don't want to get banned over a misunderstanding.
---
Entity is displeased because you took the kills. Its like when John Wick spares viggo for his sons location, and then after few moments Viggo kills Marcus, Wicks best friend. And well John was very much displeased after that. That is how entity feels too.
---
Yeah, those. How do I get them?
---
I am trying to get rid of all of my good stuff on Kavid Ding before I prestige him, while leveling up other characters :) Need that sweet BP &lt;3
---
Dude I can't even get into the game today :(
---
It's just my opinion, and i find them useful.  Not something I would ise on every killer but still useful
---
Play the game and level up, you get a certain amount of them per level
---
When you play Adam and don't use deliverence but still get tunneled first or camped till struggle
---
He looks like he‚Äôs motor boating her
---
Thanks for the help.
---
I bought a switch simply to play DBD wile traveling, I would also like to know these answers.
---
When I'm the last alive with no realistic chance of getting out I usually just do a silly little jig for the killer. Half the time they are not pleased by my artful offering, ignoring and hooking me, but the other times they are clearly cultured patrons of the arts and will dance back and sometimes even spirit me away to safety. Honestly even if they still kill me I love when they dance back. It's the little things.
---
Remember when you only had to kill everyone? I can sort of understand why they changed it: so people can't get adepts with a Mori. But still: why couldn't they just change the requirement to having to sacrifice them all, not mori them.
---
Stupid question and Survive With Friends
---
The attention to detail, to the folds and creases, you can tell this was done with love and dedication.  Beautiful! You mh friend have a future in art and design!
---
Fuck leatherface campers they suck
---
Im ok w this since it means more points for the killer but I hate when a killer does this to be ‚Äútoxic‚Äù for absolutely no reason
---
I just started playing 2 days ago, yesterday was my first game against a huntress. She decimated, and I mean *decimated* my team, leaving me last alive with 4 generators left as I‚Äôd only managed to get one. When she knocked me down (easily once she found me haha) she picked me up and started carrying me around the map. I didn‚Äôt understand why. But I wasn‚Äôt wiggling because I knew I was as good as dead. This went on for so long that I finally just wiggled out of her grip, and watched incredulously as she shook her body at me when I flinched away. 
---
She then proceeded to take me to a generator and whack it. I didn‚Äôt trust I was going to be let go so I didn‚Äôt get on the generator, so she walked away. I‚Äôm sure I would‚Äôve been allowed to do all four gens but at this point I was wildly anticipating being killed at the last second for laughs (I come from very toxic pvp games haha) so I searched for the hatch instead and got out that way. 
---
And that‚Äôs how I got my first piggyback ride from mom. We messaged each other afterwards but if you‚Äôre on here Huntress who carried my dumb new self around the map (Xbox one), thank you for making me smile and being kind enough to let me grab some points! When I start attempting to play killers I‚Äôll pay it forward!
---
Bob ross smile has penetrated through the fog and awarded you full marks üòÅ

Nah people just suck. I didn‚Äôt have problems when I started, but the community might have changed a bit.
---
Nerf?
---
Pooossst
---
I was literally just thinking that myself. The entire thought process. If it‚Äôs to prevent the ebony mori strategy they could‚Äôve just specified to sacrifice all survivors.
---
Click it
---
My friend, have you heard of r/dbdgonegay yet? :D
---
We‚Äôll be right back
---
I do that to people who flashlight spam and point spam at pallets. But usally.i wont even hook them I'll just wait for the entity animation
---
I've never cared about being tbagged, it's a part of most games at this point. So I stopped caring about it a long time ago.
---
Do you want to see what hell looks like?
---
https://ibb.co/nr0FpxJ
---
I don't think any killer mechanics need buffing, because if you're a good killer you can find another survivor by the time the hooked survivor is unhooked, or, you know, run make your choice with hag and insta down the rescuer...
---
Happy early birthday! The DLC MAY be a little more expensive than usual since its 2 survivors this time, maybe around $8, but I hope you get it
---
The criteria is no longer 4K? Goodness gravy, what is it now?
---
Can I get that info too??
---
I'm not sure I get your reason. As you say, the point of t-bagging is to taunt the killer. Taunting the killer into extending the chase against you is a good way to play the game. As such, why is it toxic to play well?
---
Also, could I ask you what message you think it sends? I cannot see it as anything worse than a "you suck" or "come get me noob", which are probably the lightest insults you'll ever see in gaming or IRL. Is that not more an issue of thin skin from the killer? Especially because a lot of the time, that probably isn't even the message the survivor is trying to send (its probably more along the lines of "bring it mofo"), and the killer is the one making it personal.
---
And yeah, t-bagging is also generally a huge waste of time, so why do people decide to think "wow that dude hurt my feelings what an asshole my game is ruined" rather than "lol imma break you harder than this pallet in 20 seconds bud just you wait." You're the killer, you can literally murder them in return, literally why are you letting them get to you?
---
I've been getting constant 4Ks (over 12 games) on Adept Plague and only getting Ruthless Killer. Even in 4Ks where I got 11 out of 12 hooks on survivors, I didn't get it. It's crazy. I think I even had one game where I got all 12 hooks. I swapped to Adept Ghostface, had him in a few games.
---
They're supposed to be OP.
---
Amazing! Honestly one of my favorite pieces of fan art.
---
I hope they do the same thing as last year but with diff killers Spirit, Hag, Legion, and Plague getting the gold juice treatment!
---
Dem boldness points tho
---
So I know nurse isn‚Äôt super annoying and complained about on console and I was wondering if it was the same with spirit. Because I don‚Äôt normally have problems against them. It could be bc I‚Äôm like rank 9 so the killers aren‚Äôt super good but idk
---
Give it something like borrowed time but only when your the last one on the hook.
---
I‚Äôm saving up a mil to try to get Nancy‚Äôs teachable immediately and then I‚Äôm going for Steve.
---
And yet I will keep doing it.
---
I approve.
---
Do you have default pig? Also if so I was the Nea with white tiger stripe pants and a skull tank top on an AutoHaven map (also remember it‚Äôs on ps4)
---
No need. I got the memes. Our job is done regardless.
---
Honestly you shouldn‚Äôt worry. Reports like that are baseless and the mass reporting will most likely negate itself
---
huh? most People dont even get the stun lol
---
A couple things:
---
1. Why would you risk opening the door as the obsession while the killer has Rancor? Why not wait for an unexposed teammate to open it for you, then dip?
---
2. How did you not hear the phasing sound? I could understand if it was prayer beads, but you could hear her phasing in the area, and where else was the Spirit going to go in that situation? Should have ran, or walked away and hid nearby so you could resume the exit gate opening later.
---
Noice.
---
Comments like this on prayer beads posts are as stupid as the point you're trying to mock. Iri Head and Amanda's Letter (among other add-ons) are super powerful add-ons that let killers counter pallets, and they're not talked about in the same breath because they're ultra rare and they have downsides. Meanwhile, prayer beads is a purple add-on with no downside that doesn't even affect pallet mind games unless you're going against a swf that actually has their shit together.
---
I like how my boy Ace is the only one concerned
---
Also, I saw this while queued as ghost face
---
You have to get a merciless killer at the end of the match. 3 iridescent emblems and a gold, usually. 
---
For some killers that isn‚Äôt too hard, but others have no help with slowing down the game, yet they need chases to go long for a certain emblem. While also having to control gens because if they pop too fast that kills a different emblem. 
---
It‚Äôs extremely hard to get the perfect balance with some killers.
---
5 down votes but 0 replies, in a discussion thread. Yeah, you guys aren't proving my point or anything at all with your silence.
---
Sounds great
---
You just missed Discordance. It was on 2 or 3 weeks ago.
---
Tips for Adept Legion?  
---
I'm at rank 15 and even there I can't get it.
---
Shit, that sounds like hell. Kudos to any and all adept killer hunters out there.
---
upvoted because doggo
---
Yeah, exactly. Survivors have extremely limited ways of communicating in game, and t-bagging is essentially the only way to even remotely get back at the people chasing you around to kill you outside of escaping. Its odd to me that the aggressors of the game (people playing killer) have such visceral responses to any type of aggression they receive when its all they give out as their role.
---
It‚Äôs amazing on Lerys though. The middle area??
---
Two maps being bad for it doesn‚Äôt make Sprint Burst or Lithe better
---
I'm loving these downvotes with zero responses to them. Just shows how many trash killers there are I guess, no wonder they're on Reddit.
---
youre 99% unlikely to get banned from a single report. On the off chance you do, itll be a week temp ban.
---
I‚Äôve been saying he was letting them unhook in front of him to get points. You said something that contradicted that, what you said suggested he was actively chasing them but pretended he was trying to win, when in reality he was secretly letting them win.
---
OP did not get points in terms of for himself but only put them on hook over and over so everyone can get altruism, judging by wording of the post I would say the people who were farming altruism knew he was helping them, so they let him hook them to rescue eachother hover and over until third hook, where they ran off, THEN they got betrayed.

I always thought her eyes got ripped out considering the blood around them but guess I was wrong
---
Well now that you put it like that, she doesn‚Äôt seem so great after all. 
---
Side question, what‚Äôs your adept killer difficulty list? Personally I‚Äôd say (all things considered from what you said) plague is the hardest, and *maybe* nurse would be the easiest considering she‚Äôs the best killer and her perks aren‚Äôt much of a detriment to her.
---
We aren't gonna waste our time responding to a rank 21 sorry
---
This is great to hear. I really hope that it doesn't lead to anything. If it does I'll definitely try to plead my case to BHVR.
---
Yeah probably, I guess that might be too much, but I would at least appreciate it if I was able to still unhook myself as the last one.
---
Im not on PC but im told its 1 and 2 on the keyboard for point and wave over. 
---
People pointing and running could be for a lot of things. They could be indicating that the killer is there and to run, or they want you to work on the gen while they go do something else, or they want you to go unhook a hooked survivor. Its all based on context and the player, you could really never know in some cases.
---
Looping: "A term to describe a common scenario during a chase in which the survivor runs one or more loops around a single pallet until the killer is close enough to hit them; then the pallet will be dropped to avoid getting hit by the killer (and possibly stun them). This strategy is used by the survivors to waste the killer's time as much as possible to give the rest of the survivors enough time to complete generators in order to escape."
---
You have the general idea though, but its really only a loop if theres an obstacle between you and the killer (Window, Pallet, or a drop)
---
So you're going to leave a 4 word joke in a thread titled discussion and not argue a point or even try to debate how you're right? Sad, really.
---
Only happened to me once, all the other ghost faces I've met have been super nice or fun
---
Same
---
I mean you cant get that low unless you haven't played killer for about 4 months
---
SCP-106 which is just a very naked old corroded man wearing a leather jacket that takes people to his pocket dimension and kills them I believe, he can also walk through walls which is interesting
---
Fix protection hits and make them distraction and protection hits
---
Knew it before I even clicked looool
---
okay? I was answering why people dislike slugging and tunneling. 
---
no idea why you are comparing it to a AAA FPS when dbd is an asymmetrical "horror" game.
---
Very naice
---
Are u really getting mori‚Äôed by yourself?
---
NAH IM WIT THE BOISS
---
True but it‚Äôs a wasted perk slot in the end
---
Imagine chaos queue, you have no idea who you'll be or what you'll have equipped
---
Same lmao
---
Anyone who spell T-Shirt like that **has** to be a fucking bot.
---
Oh boy time to play DBD!  
---
\&gt;Que for a billy game  
---
\&gt;wait 35 mins for players  
---
\&gt;spawn on o'lerys  
---
\&gt;actually manage to down a p3 Claudette quickly   
---
\&gt;she misses DC then really DCs  
---
\&gt;Nea DCs  
---
\&gt;Ace DCs  
---
\&gt;all thats left is 5 gens and a level 20 dwight with 2.1 hours  
---
\&gt;have to kill the Dwight bc he doesn't understand what farming is  
---
\&gt;what a great use if my party streamers  
---
thats enough DBD for today.
---
Hella good job there.
---
I may not be new but I have a reasoning to why I camped when I first started, it's me feeling worried I wouldn't be able to hook them again or just survivors going for their teammates which made my early matches easy which is why I still camp sometimes
---
Yeah, this happened with me awhile back cause I took a break awhile back. Came back to being rank 20 so people said they would report me for deranking lmao
---
Mhm...  way to be civil.
---
You've already been given the practical response mate, of someone's getting camped leave the fucker and do gens, get your points and dip you'll pip up atleast once or at minimum safety. 
---
Let me very clear, **if the killer is camping leave the fucker and gen rush**
---
I‚Äôm dy-ingggg. Why is this so accurate!!
---
I don‚Äôt think a troll teammate would care about a wasted perk slot.
---
Fair! I find it kind of difficult to know what they're actually expecting of me - it'd be nice to have some kind of system where we could have basic notifications rather than guesswork.
---
Thank you! I did actually read the definition of looping after posting this, but thanks! :)
---
I agree with that, I'd love to see those things fixed but first they should focus on more important things like servers that will actually help a lot more with that host bs.
---
Maybe even a more decent tutorial since right now it barely scratch the surface of the gameplay for newcomers, maybe introducing a bot tutorial to grasp even the details people will skip since they won't read everything but just play and can't blame them
---
Adjust some collisions for huntress and dumb dead zones for nurse, give a deep introduction to totems etc for survivors and so on. These animations are the last thing I will look at tbh
---
Here are the keywords: Long, Black
---
A bit new only have legacy 1 for billy and nea so i think its just that they don‚Äôt realize how fast gens get done and get punished because of it.
---
Just get gud lol
---
Can anyone really tell what the intention of the teabagger is? Nobody can really tell if they‚Äôre just trying to get your attention to buy their teammates time to fix gens or if they‚Äôre actually trying to take the piss outta ya. 
---
All that aside however, I personally believe that the latter is toxic and the former not toxic.
---
Just met a SWF squad thinking that I was farming simply because I picked Legion, so I got like every hook with 5 gens remaining. In the end I had to let them go because of my conscience.
---
feelsbadman
---
oof.
---
It doesn‚Äôt remove footsteps.
---
Nurse is possible on console. If you only play there, the frame rate is easy to get used to. She‚Äôs still top tier, and even better because nobody knows counter play.
---
Is it true that Legion has a longer lunge range when lunging while in frenzy? If so how much longer than a normal lunge is it? And if I lunge and miss while in frenzy does it add to the post-frenzy cooldown, or does it just bypass the normal miss lunge and go straight to the normal post-frenzy cooldown?
---
Nurse can be anywhere from easiest to hardest depending on how good you are with her. That learning curve can be brutal. Her placement seriously depends on the player. 
---
I don‚Äôt have an exact list because I got *a lot* of them before they changed the requirements. My first and foremost recommendation is to bring a Game Map offering. Makes map control much easier (and most lower rank survivors suck at the map). 
---
I‚Äôd say Spirit, Freddy, Ghostface, Clown, Hag, and Billy (on any map) are very easy. 
---
Huntress isn‚Äôt too bad, 
---
Hardest ones are definitely the ones I‚Äôm about to list. Wraith isn‚Äôt impossible but he‚Äôs difficult (nothing helps slowing down the game). But at least his power isn‚Äôt wasting any time. Trapper is hard because he has nothing to slow down the game, despite having a power that requires wasting time to set up (his traps around the map).  Same for Doctor, his power requires wasting some time (M and A also won‚Äôt help him) but nothing slows down the game, so you‚Äôre either wasting time or a basic M1. Plague is fucking brutal.
---
Ikr, I run it and fire up on Legion already for that sexy pallet vault speed anyway.
---
Dance With Me is Kate's best perk (unless you're new, then it's probably Windows of Opportunity). It's not particularly great, but it's the one to grab from her if you had to choose just one.
---
so...you hate yourself huh?
---
Because they want a kill.
---
Shit, I guess time is the most valuable thing a killer has.
---
Kinda surprised trapper was one of the hardest but I can‚Äôt say I disagree with you.
---
Your point on doctor is solid but I think it‚Äôs more of a trade than anything, spend some time (shock survivors) to waste their time and sap them (tier 3 madness, random skillchecks, screaming).
---
Not sure how ghost face is easy as all he has to slow down the game is thrilling tremors, I could just be a frickin idiot though.
---
What about bubba though? I think he‚Äôd be somewhat easy because his perks are pretty good and his power is mediocre. I think he‚Äôd fall short though because he has nothing to slow down the game.
---
I smell fan fic already.
---
Okay fair SWF's can be toxic little shits, true. But imagine being in rank 20-10 again as a survivor without much knowledge of the game, with zero communication and being camped almost every game if not every game. 2-4 years from now it will be all SWF's, wait times for killers will increase and minimal amounts of players will solo que making killers more and more toxic (somehow). Would you want to play a new game where if you get hooked it's over 50% of the time? Wouldn't you rather play killer instead? Hence the increased wait times for killers and the proliferation of more and more SWF groups or players just quitting in general?
---
Yeah, you been gettin' that too?
---
You hit the "unhook" button, your character examines the lint in your fellow survivors navel &amp; wonder if they should eat it as they've not had a meal in weeks, and *the* you start the unhook process?
---
Sucks.
---
Not gonna lie, nowadays survivors give me more heart attacks when I play killer, those sudden pallet stuns...
---
What platform are you on?
---
ps4
---
Haha I like that, but I'd say its more like telling the guy who's trying to murder you "you're gonna have to try harder than that!" Its a little toxic, but cmon, they're trying to kill me here. I crouch 3 times in front of the killer and suddenly I'm the asshole in the situation? haha.
---
Makes me want to draw a comic of a Michael Myers looking sad after getting t-bagged by a Bill or something, then the other survivors come console MM while glaring at Bill and he's like "How am I the asshole here???"
---
Source? 
---
People are talking about a streamer who got banned but nobody has mentioned the name of this streamer. Who is s/he
---
The "new" emblem system is stupid, I agree.
---
If you for example play a killer with instadowns, you might blackpip or even depip because you get those stupid chaser points only for hitting people.
---
And if you down them in one hit, you are losing 50% of the possible hits.
---
If you want to rank up quickly, just play Legion and stab, stab, stab, stab, stab at people. Iridescent chaser medal and if you manage to get a kill and don't facecamp you are almost guaranteed to rank up.
---
it is possible that the killer left the game by unconventional means, which resulted in a disconnect on your end rather than theirs.
---
Did you get points from your last game?
---
+/- rep has never been a thing on Steam, its just how people express their disgust of you because they can't down/up vote your steam profile. - rep is just a salt trophy from someone that upset at you. :)
---
Hes on sale on PS4 I believe, so I would get him if youre on PS4. You cant buy him with shards since he is technically a licensed killer, you can only buy the OC killers with shards (Clown, Spirit, Plague, etc).
---
DLC doesnt get any cheaper when new DLC releases.
---
I try to be a better player then the toxic ones. I don't wanna be "that guy" I just wish people were not buttheads. But that's the internet for ya I suppose lol.
---
Exactly this lmao
---
It can definitely be useful more often than you would think. I‚Äôd recommend it, especially with quick&amp;quiet/lithe
---
Posted lower in the comments.
---
THEY WERE ALL LIKE RANK 12 AND 7 IM 13 ON KILLER
---
*claps* how original
---
you can actually run up the side of the big tree on Shelter Woods high enough to proc BL. 
---
As a Nea main I was ecstatic to figure that out.
---
Same here but there have been times that I‚Äôm gonna be that asshole who runs straight to the killer with flashlight in hand and try to have some fun instead of it being a instant death shit show game, because killer has op shit and my solo randoms are potato‚Äôs, I play on PS4 and normally the killers are good and I get horrible players I lumped in with and rank don‚Äôt mean shit, the idiots in the purple ranks are the worse, not late Friday or Saturday you get some damn good peeps to play with
---
Phony Geese Touching Wombats
---
So what you saying is, nothing is toxic unless it's actual cheating and exploiting or being threatened or told to kill yourself. The extreme is not the only. Yes you have no reason to upset at small things, but that doesn't mean you are wrong for being upset. Ironically, thinking that way itself is a toxic behaviour.
---
Ruin is powerful but doesn't last long at all in higher ranks. Most survivors &lt;10 can easily find it. However &gt;10 it can be difficult. But suffice to say most killers are below rank 10 with it on killers like trapper or spirit as these are more experienced killers, for the more experienced survivors. Your argument is a false equivalency/non-sequitur because ruin can be destroyed and is typically not camped, if at all other than trapper/hag, where as there is virtually nothing you can do against a camping killer at hook, especially one capable of insta downing you, such as tier 3 Myers, hill billy, cannibal, ghost face, plague (if sick) and huntress/clown with their Exposed add ons. But thanks for contributing.
---
Jump scare is just sprint burst but good
---
They said they can‚Äôt ban people on console a while ago due to it being up to Microsoft or Sony at the end of the day. Something like that.
---
I‚Äôve done this and had the survivors run away. I‚Äôve killed everyone and left the baby Dwight to be last (not intentionally) so I offer the hatch and they just run thinking they wiggled out and outplayed me.
---
You drew this on your whiteboard? Damn that‚Äôs good
---
No prob, I love Ghost Face even if hes not the best, he replaced my #1 most played killer . If you wanna know anything else lemme know!
---
Just like Moris, keys shouldn't even be in the game... It literally skips your objective and completely changes the pace of a game once hatch is out.
---
Fair
---
I just spend 10-15s checking the nearby area then back to the gen. Rinse and repeat for the 2nd gen. If it hasn't been found by then, I'll go check the really hard to find spawns cause it's most likely there.
---
[deleted]
---
Disagree, she‚Äôs a perfect representation of who she was in the movies, since you like saw you should know that the revers-bear-trap was *Amanda‚Äôs* trap. The kind that was on her in the first saw movie and later was used to murder Jill, it‚Äôs the physical manifestation of her rebirth from being a drug addicted hobo to being a righteous (in her mind) killer. She doesn‚Äôt need other traps the RBT is already perfect and iconic. I agree pig needs a rework but mostly just a buff not any major overhauls.
---
This just fills up my desire for pennywise in dbd
---
Yeah i did. Heavily referenced a screenshot from his CG trailer. Thank you :)
---
So you did? So the majority of survivors who are new to the game should just realize that's how you had to play the game, be completely selfish and out for only yourself and maybe they'll rank up? All the while minimize their BP output, essentially making playing survivor only about ranks and rage every time they get camped.. So the solution to the problem is do nothing about it just let everyone fend for themselves and never see an increase in rank past 1 pip? That sounds fun.
---
Seriously get me good sometimes
---
You do realize that double pipping is the exception not the rule right? You realize you should only be double pipping if either you did really well or The Other did really bad? 
---
And camping wouldn't be an issue if survivors punished it by, and let me say it again because you seem to have trouble grasping this concept
---
**LEAVING THE HOOKED FUCKER TO DIE WHILE THEY GEN RUSH**
---
I have no sympathy for other survivor mains who dont punish camping, they deserve what's coming to them. 
---
Oh but please tell me more about how this game is gonna die because of camping waaah waaah lmao
---
Thanks for proving my point and being the toxic bile that hag mains crawled out of.
---
Oh fuck off, here's some karma lol
---
Whenever I play killer it's almost always meg and claudette mains who teabag me. Lol
---
I did it on my first game because it took so long to actually down someone with all the vaulting and pallet dropping that I didn't want them to get off the hook.
---
SWF really doesn't help newbies at all.
---
------
---
Another reason is newbie survs are scared, so won't touch gens if they can hear the heartbeat - This means gens get done VERY slow, meaning camping is a viable strat.
---
R/angryupvote
---
Why are you booing him, he's right!
---
r/angryupvote
---
Kate?
---
What ruins the game are some of the fucking maps existing
---
I think I‚Äôve had this happen more times than I‚Äôve ever actually grabbed someone (outside of farming).  One of the most busted mechanics in a game full of busted mechanics.
---
Fair point, I somehow managed to not think of the ability called "Jigsaw's Baptism" as a representation of how a person changed into a "better" person. From the standpoint of changing her power I guess I conflated John's "gimmick" into who Amanda is
---
No it‚Äôs JRR Tolkien‚Äôs ‚ÄúIt‚Äù
---
Just honest friend (:
---
Exactly.
---
WHAT IS THIS PICTURE? WHY??
---
Happy cake day!
---
&gt;You're the killer, you can literally murder them in return, literally why are you letting them get to you?
---
There are two kinds of teabaggers. 
---
Type 1: Overconfident players who get downed shortly after trying to goad the Killer into chasing them instead of the other players. Smacking them down is very satisfying, I might furrow my brows at their hybris, but I'll move on.
---
Type 2: Looping gods with 20000 hours played. They know every single loop on every single map, they know EXACTLY when they have to throw down a pallet and then seamlessly move on to the next loop. Since Killer gameplay is mostly reactive and you have to wait for the survivor to make a mistake, this can be infuriating. I'd call it bad sportsmanship. Imagine playing any other (sports)game against someone WAY above your skill level.
---
It's a great way to learn the game, but if the guy you play against taunts you and laughs at you every time he outplays you, you stop enjoying the game.
---
Playing this game has turned me into a remorseless killing machine with no regard for human (or any other kind of ) life.
---
I am afraid of what will happen the next time I pick up a badminton racket.
---
Soujds about right my guy, sounds like you're finally heading the wise words of your betters
---
Play survivor and get tunneled and camped and then come back and answer your own question.
---
Do you ever wonder why SWF groups are increasing and solo ques are becoming a thing of the past? See the sad thing really is you see me as your enemy when I'm a killer too, but if I stick up for the survivor SIDE you have a us vs them mentality, and instead of innocently engaging in a discussion you resort to name calling and being toxic, which really just goes to show the decline of this community's atmosphere in the coming years.
---
Awesome use of my boy, great job!
---
You can be honest without calling someone a loser for having a different opinion.
---
It's quite a gem, this is one of those perfect dbd clips!!
---
Mate I dont even play killer lmao I'm a hardcore survivor main lol
---
why don't you switch it to another button and use a macro?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs really aided to survivors, in high tiers its hard for hunters lol
---
I like to not press my spacebar intentionally so I can instead use the time saved to post whining rage threads on reddit.
---
I second all this
---
One I‚Äôm not a bitch and use macros two if I‚Äôm using 4 fingers to smash a button the game is broken not the mechanics
---
why can't we just remove keys? getting cheated out of a 4k because there was just 1 gen left is bullshit.
---
Claudette cigarette cosmetic confirmed
---
Hey read your title, that‚Äôs what you gotta do. 
---
In all seriousness there are ways to make it easier like getting a membrane keyboard vs mechanical, or installing a macro. Although they‚Äôre not really ‚Äúallowed‚Äù, a lot of people still use them because nobody wants to mash their space bar as much as dbd makes you
---
Agreed I honestly hate the whole (killer is host) system it causes stuff like this which is super annoying but if the host has good WiFi it doesn‚Äôt hurt me.
---
Scrap Thanatophobia and put on Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
No ewww
---
I shouldn‚Äôt have to install a macro to play the game
---
I say get rid of keys and red moris (not green ones because moris are cool and green ones aren‚Äôt that bad)
---
Mori animation spamming  is toxic and can actually get u banned
---
Not when it involves people getting upset about me using a commonly used word to describe a hateful person. I'm getting getting shit from people over saying that I don't like Racists, homophobes, etc.. so pardon me if I don't give a flying fuck about what you think. You could have easily just downvoted my comment and moved on but you decided to go out of your way to say how you think Bigot is a petty word when I was using it because it matched what I was trying to describe. So if anyone is being petty, it's you.
---
Trapper bc you can actually see his cleavage
---
Me and the boys playing kill your friends
---
If you‚Äôre really telling me to use a macro to use a major component of the game the game mechanic is broken
---
I'm not even super competitive, good game is pretty casual to me.
---
But I still like to play the objective. I'm not going to be a carebear and give the last survivor the hatch. If a killer did that to me I'd feel insulted.
---
Then they lose their escape bonus to üòÇ
---
Remember me is a good fuckn perk, I‚Äôm getting me that blood points tho because I already unlocked it.
---
r/wooooshwith4os
---
;)
---
 A survivor exits through the gates, but doesn‚Äôt actually leave, so they just run around the outside of the map. Sometimes you‚Äôll fall through the bottom of the map and appear in some random spot, I‚Äôve seen gifs of people appearing right next to hatch lol
---
96
---
Shy guy would be great in this game. How they would work his power in, idk
---
Relatively new to the game, what is Mori and why is cancelling it bannable?
---
Spending an extra few seconds of a gen does not make it worth it enough to waste the sprint burst. Then you also have the down side of needing to walk which is WASTING TIME to save the exhaustion
---
Well that's 100% understandable. I never try to kill rush. Like I just played a match and they were getting no Gens. So I got tired of hooking them and dropped them next to a gen. Like get a gen dude. I'll be back for you later type of deal. 2 survived and we all got 30,000 BP. If you ever wanna play on PS4 hit me up. You sound like a dope player lol.
---
lol I need this on twitter to retweet
---
Not at all if there was no struggle what would stop the killer from carrying your ass to the basement struggling isn‚Äôt for getting out of the killers grasp it can be used for that some times but it‚Äôs real purpose is to stop killers from carrying survivors to the basement from across the map
---
It also downed a Claudette
---
For anyone wondering: check this guy's post history. I'm gonna leave it at that.
---
I suppose I should have also mention that the addons could also work as an iridescent for bubba, I called it ‚ÄòIridescent Marks‚Äô to sorta match his addon ‚ÄòThe Beast‚Äôs Marks‚Äô. So far I‚Äôve mostly reworked all of hillbilly‚Äôs, bubbas, and nurses addons, though I‚Äôm a bit hesitant to share the full rework ideas for several reasons lol 
---
Bubba needs some love, he‚Äôs easily in the bottom three killers, same with wraith and legion imo. So this add on would be a nice addition to the game for both killers. Charge time would be a bitch but the speed would be ridiculous
---
My comment is basically just an amalgamation of this subs, the forums, and my personal opinions. Good to know I‚Äôm not completely wrong.

Yah I‚Äôve heard that too and I‚Äôve said this before as well that BhVR has no balls and bows down to Sony and Microsoft. Funny thing is if it‚Äôs a in Game problem Sony tells you to report it to the game developer and those pussys don‚Äôt do shit when you do report someone and then  go thru the bs hassle of filling out the report. I gave up awhile ago on reporting anything if BhVR Interactive wants to let there toxic asshole players ruin their game they can and I‚Äôve seen what happens to those games. BhVR is fixing to get a big influx of new players and you have assholes on both side that depip or rank reset bs and stay in the nooby ranks, that‚Äôs a problem and BhVR needs to seriously start cracking down on that shit and after so long with playing the game you shouldn‚Äôt be able to go past rank 13 period!

Lol Spirit is the PC Nurse of console IMO. It is without a doubt my most feared killer to go up against. I'm red ranks on console (and I have been basically since the game was free on PS4) and ever since she's been released, no other killer has taken that place for me as scariest killer to vs
---
aaAAA...
---
Pewdiepie
---
I give hatches to all baby dweets and any last survivor who doesn't struggle. If you struggle when I walk past my second hook, you're dying. Sorry.
---
They do that, but at least they arent survivors with a bloated sense of their own ego who tbag when they beat a billy on lery‚Äôs of all maps
---
Push up bras do God's work
---
This is sad.

You can play Basement Leatherface
---
Yeah, so? They're husbands
---
Literally any exhaustion perk on killer. Let me dead hard right into a lunge :P
---
Mega-bait it seems :/
---
What. r/woooosh
---
I jumped
---
Well the ideal balance is 2 dead, 2 alive.
---
The more that die, the easier it is for the remaining to escape and that's only if they have a key really.
---
If I killer and this happens I just go afk somewhere, maybe do a few chases.
---
Classic doc main
---
Omg she looks so good =P
---
I'd definitely want to see how'd you do Myers =P
---
He's kinda... complicated to draw in my mind but with your skills you can do it! =P
---
What rank are you? Ive found hooking everyone twice and maxing out BP usually nets me a safety pip at 13.
---
You just love contributing nothing while sarcastically inserting yourself like a high school teenager with one worded responses since you can't come up with anything nice or worth any substance to say. I'll take my downvotes from you with pride and smile since you are giving me free bumps, and proving my point on how toxic this community is, especially considering you saying there's nothing wrong with the game and nothing needs to be changed to reduce toxic killers, all the while being completely toxic in a discussion thread about toxic killers who camp or tunnel or abuse the game at lower ranks and repel new players from playing survivor away from the game. But please, continue your one worded sentences, acronyms and quips as you literally cannot see past your own interests as you said below "fuck them, do the gens" and hex:ruin the game for those of us who don't want to go up against just SWF hook sabo and gen rush teams.
---
I disagree. Have you ever heard of a certain super villain named Mr. Freeze?
---
* Internal Screams *
---
*Tips fedora*
---
People act like every power needs to have a 4 minute cooldown. When the game can end in 8 minutes or less with efficient survivors. 
---
Please go away.
---
I actually did this to a Jake who thought he could Killer Shack Loop...
---
Probably scared him to bits...
---
stealth mode activate!
---
I totally agree. Deliverance/Dead Hard/D Strike could create some big plays. Would it rarely work? Probably, but I don‚Äôt see any reason why it shouldn‚Äôt.
---
Depends how high you are.
---
I think slugging and never hooking can make you depip?
---
I've had a few ghostfaces who just afk in the basement in stealth mode, no idea if they got punished for it but I'm pretty sure it is punishable to afk as you're wasting the survs time.
---
-----
---
Why do you want to derank?
---
Wrong, you can still hear footsteps. It's how I avoid getting grabbed. People are just too immersed in holding M1 to realize it.
---
Ha, I can draw that no problem!
---
Me: proceeds to draw awful stick figure...
---
In all seriousness, job well done my dude!
---
Cause She's gonna get a new booty hole
---
Sure, this is a fun idea. Some people name themselves "Don't Touch My Chest" and just spend the entire game in the basement making sure no one gets their chest. 
---
But honestly, why do you want to depip?
---
Have you thought that maybe it‚Äôs not the game but either the space bar being broken from you smashing it..
---
Also some keyboards don‚Äôt have the sensor for presses under the entirety of the space bar due to its size; some have it in the middle others have two (one on each side).
---
More than likely you were just greedy and dropped it too late.
---
It's actually pastaferian.
---
Survive With Friends, a mode that lets two or more survivors group up with the Steam friends list. This is important because these players tend to be able to talk to each other (on Discord or whatever), making them able to coordinate far more effectively than a group of random survivors
---
The devs are able to track all that info but they haven't decided to do anything with it yet. Idk why they put it in the game to begin with
---
Same here, if they seem potatoy I slow the game down, let them reset and bang a few gens out, I‚Äôm here for points and to have some fun, not just be all blood thirsty like most pricks are and the game is over in 2 mins and you maybe got 10k base points as killer, waste of time and offerings like when people pop BPS and the killer goes all ham and it‚Äôs over in 2 mins with no points. If I‚Äôm killer and it‚Äôs a DBP event or streamers pop, you can bet your ass that game will be dragged out, not farming in a sense but you won‚Äôt know if your gonna live or die! Sure thing and you too!
---
BBQ: extremely obvious perk for him.
---
Corrupt Intervention: slows down the gens but can allow them to all pile on a gen and get it done even faster -but they already do that so...
---
Those two are must have IMHO but there's a whole bunch you can get good results with like:
---
Thanatophobia with Swing Chains. Pair that with Sloppy Butcher and new Dying Light. 
---
Surveillance.
---
Discordance.
---
Make Your Choice.
---
Or NOED as an "insurance policy."
---
I can already see Killers bringing Franklins and camping the dropped item.
---
HotüòôüòôüòõüòõüçÜüí¶üí¶üí¶üíòüíòüíò
---
I didn't kill everyone else with NOED. I killed the third survivor, dropped the hatch as soon as it spawned and finished him off.
---
Oh boy smooching time!
---
What is that?
---
Then they need to make prayer beads ultra rare and give it a cooldown penalty. Because I'm legitimately sick of people bitching about it. I personally haven't touched spirit since he release, but the constant crying on this subreddit is giving me conniptions.
---
For the locker trap, an Exposed and/or Broken effect would be better than being downed. In my opinion, anyway. Really good ideas, though.
---
You realize I'm taking about the health of this game long term and not individual preferences? You on the other hand are only thinking of yourself in your own experience, as if to say that's all that matters and new players, who would help the game continue to grow, can get fucked if they're put on the hook in low ranks because it wasn't easy for YOU. Someone doesn't run empathy, or for that matter, know what it is.
---
You don‚Äôt need to worry... all your problems will get ten times harder in the next week

Jewish 100%
---
What's the thread's title tho.
---
Yes hes good, hes a solid b tier killer, hes possibly the stealthiest killer in the game right now depending on if you're using cooldown addons, (I recommend stacking his best night shroud cooldown addons so it only takes 16 seconds to recharge instead of 30) and a tip, if you know where a survivor is, and you're trying to sneak up on them, dont go in a straight line towards them, try to approach from an angle they wont expect. (An example of what not to do would to go in straight line from a survivor you just hooked to a generator a survivor is working on, because the survivors knows you're in that direction) this may sound like incredibly lame and obvious advice but youd be surprised with how many people dont do this stuff.
---
All you literally said is to ‚ÄúPrEsS sPaCe BetTeR‚Äù I‚Äôm using 4 fingers that‚Äôs 3 too many for an even remotely casual player.

r/dbdgonewild

Naw mate you‚Äôre just letting the survivors open the doors, the obsession should be dead and at least one other survivor dead NOED, and the end game is yours. 4K every game
---
I repeat, REAL Meg mains would NEVER! They‚Äôre fake bitches
---
Farming sucks dick and so do you
---
Welp. Ok.
---
Is this a copypasta
---
Make fixated work while injured for the love of god. We don‚Äôt need a repeat of pre-buff urban evasion.
---
I dont understand your question? Pastafarianism is the orgin of the game.
---
Perfect...
---
I think theres a show literally called ‚ÄúSlasher‚Äù on netflix. Watched it with some friends a few weeks ago.
---
Meg! Don‚Äôt Sprint Burst to the edge of the map!
---
The last 4 games I‚Äôve had that glitch happen. It would be a fun glitch if I didn‚Äôt hear the hook music/injured noises constantly. I kinda like floating around like a knock off Nurse and chasing the killer around.
---
I'll say it again mate if you're letting the killer 4 man while camping you are trash plain and simple, I dont need to argue anything else because it's that simple lmao
---
That and the fact you could fast vault without any run up and the killer vault animation was much slower. People make fun of the game but it really is in the best place it has ever been.

---
I like Bloody Gears and Liber Of Death
---
especially Liber Of Death as there isn't much benefit for the killer in opening the exit gates
---
Giving survivors a "get out of jail free" card as a core game mechanic is not how you balance this game. Your post is the equivalent of a "Killers should always have NOED" Post. It's stupid.
---
My philosophy behind never dodging any SWF groups is that the match with them will definitely better me as a killer, and I never pass up an opportunity to improve.
---
That, however, is not to say that I don‚Äôt get pissed off sometimes. Some SWFs just absolutely fuck me up and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it, a survivor‚Äôs most powerful tool is 3 friends and a VC program. But I can‚Äôt complain, everything has a price, and skill is no exception.
---
Meh, decent I guess
---
Spoken like a true rank 1. Unlike how you would think at a lower rank, like how you argue "they said this game would die in 16, 17, 18" that's how long youve been playing. What about new players who are the ones building this community? Just keep everything the way it's always been and because you had to deal with a broken mechanic everyone else has to too? So solo queuing ranks &gt;10 can deal with all the camping killers you did and maybe if they don't rage themselves to death and quit they can be a low rank too? Really?
---
You know what's worse for the long term health of this game? Hella unbalanced shit like every survivor having borrowed time lol
---
So true
---
It‚Äôs the auto-aim and hit boxes that make the nurse broken
---
Oh shid oh frick I‚Äôm am a idiot failure
---
Hmmm
---
rank reset is in like 3 days man, you can hold out.
---
Ty, I would agree too. Wtf are these pastafarianism stuff.
---
What did it say?
---
Any survivor who dies to a camping killer had it coming lol
---
can confirm; this exact thing happens to me all the fucking time
---
Fast vaults are the main method of creating infinite or semi infinite loops. Giving killers ways to prevent fast vaults allows them a counter to the couple of super brutal loops that still exist.
---
I saw that post, that's why I made this. It was just a fun little thing to do and a bit of an art warmup, sorry if I did something wrong...
---
Both sides are killing the game by saying the other side is killing the game.
---
For every toxic survivor action, there's a toxic killer action.
---
There are FAAAAR less toxic Killers, but the Survivor to Killer ratio per game is 4:1. Most "toxic, tunneling, camping killers" are entirely innocent.
---
So, just stop with this shit, alright? We need each other or it literally will never work. A co-op Killer story mode will NEVER work. Ever.

Whats steves best perk?
---
[Sandstorm -Darude](https://youtu.be/vqffY-6OVKc)
---
Adding this perk would basically be removing one of the ways survivors can last in a chase, if you take away the vaults and make it just as quick for a killer as it is for a survivor, you might as well just remove vaults from the game. Bamboozle is good because it forces the survivor to move to a different location, and is very lethal in the killer shack. It‚Äôs not meant to trap survivors but rather relocate them and allow you to close the distance as they find a new area.
---
My keyboard isn‚Äôt bad though all my games I have no issues with my space bar besides this game, so clearly it isn‚Äôt a keyboard issue it‚Äôs a game mechanic issue. One guy was nice enough to tell me to bind it to my mouse wheel so I am going to try that and see
---
But if most survivors have to deal with toxic killers who camp, wouldn't that mean most survivors would also quit playing survivor or the game entirely? Or think camping is how you are supposed to play the game and perpetuate the cycle?
---
It is a mindgame. I get it, you hate the spirit and want to belittle her powers and invalidate her, but seriously guys, what the hell do you call that maneuver? If you dont have another name for it I'm sticking to mind game because everyone has a universal understanding of what it is. Rock paper scissors is considered a mind game, please explain how spirit is less complex than rock paper scissors.
---
r/strangerthings
---
Sometimes and I don't think any are planned right now, but usually during Halloween and/or the holiday season there are events. 
---
Stranger things is in PTB so I imagine very soon but I'm sure someone else has an exact date
---
Moonwalking isnt even hard and yet its considering a valid and skilled mindgame unlike spirit, people say spirit is only a 50 50 guess, so is moonwalking when theres no line of sight????
---
Can you stop already man? you may get a temp mute from posting on the sub soon. Maybe even worse
---
His hair.
---
Never seen someone complain about cooldown addons before lol
---
No, that's another non-sequitur because you can destroy NOED. If you have a cannibal face-camping a survivor there is literally nothing you can do.
---
That's fukin terrible
---
You know what will actually Ruin the game? A hex totem. Eyyyyy
---
I won't lie I've done something similar once I would've mori'd them if I brought one. I did it mainly because I couldn't resist, and the survivor was somewhat messing around. I dropped him just far enough that I could close the thing right in his face. It wasn't maliciously intended more just a gameplay troll.
---
Yeah that'd be cool but people would figure out how to break the game pretty fast knowing dbd, so I doubt they would actually do it unfortunately.
---
I don‚Äôt like ruin purely because it‚Äôs a hex perk. We all know that hex perks come with that 50/50 where the hex would either spawn in a god awfully placed dull totem or go full blendette and never be found. I don‚Äôt like it when something I need (good hex totem placement) is not guaranteed.
---
Rip trapper, he was doomed from the start.
---
I mean I know the dying light rework isn‚Äôt the best, but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs so bad to the point it‚Äôd be considered a nerf. At least it demotes obsession tunneling which in a way counters d-strike.

Either walk up hit chase. Wraith is free hit then chase. Beware as your rank goes down survivors are more trained to notice cloaked wraith and you can't be all Willy nilly just because you're cloaked. 
---
Or silent bell/mapwide bell reveal behind corner then fly out and go for gen grabs.

It's called do gens and leave.
---
I can take criticism lol, and calling me a fan of this game isn‚Äôt exactly an insult either. Either PrESs SpACebAr BeTTeR or try different keyboards and see if a specific type is easier for you to use (I know mechanical keyboards are more difficult to mash than membrane keyboards)
---

Yeah, that's why it's difficult. Otherwise I could just slap a Mori and call it a day.

As others said, just the characters thought up by the devs can be bought in game without real cash. There are good sales on all the dlcs (except the newest one typically) every now and then where you can get them for around half price.

Use a friend's account try all killers and which ever one is your favorite buy
---
Are you implying that the killers weapon should be a gun?? You can start an attack looking to the right and turn and finish it looking to the left, what's wrong with that.
---
Why didn't i think of that....
---
The claudette is literally teleporting I'm actually disgusted by PC players
---
I haven't tried Freddy and Legion is pretty bad if you're not running a specific build. I do enjoy legion more than any killer but legion is so easy to gen rush again if you don't have the specific build.
---
Spirit is one of the killers that requires the most experience/counter play. After playing against a lot of them (which doesn‚Äôt happen until like, red ranks) you‚Äôll be better at countering her. The only advice I have for going against a prayer beads spirit is running spine chill, and getting off the gen if it lights up for more than a second or 2
---
I mean on console nurse isn't a problem 98% of the time so that might be why you feel that way, but I promise you on PC, nurse is and has been the best since she's been released and has not given up that spot ever. Spirit is 2nd for sure, but I don't think she needs to be nerfed imo. She's hard to play so she has a higher reward than other killers. Just my two cents.
---
I say Bubba also need to move a little faster while charging his chainsaw and successfully hitting a survivor should make it so the duration of the chainsaw resets so you can go even further and domino off survivors
---
Chases are to long plus survivors get to many second chances and gen completion time is to short
---
Camping isn't fun, but I wouldn't call it toxic. If anything, I think survivors tend to be more unsportsmanlike compared to killers. In my time playing survivor, I've been camped maybe 5 times. The majority of the time I play killer I get insulted or harassed in post game chat.
---
Giving everybody borrowed time would be kind of crazy. The people that benefit the most from the perk aren't low ranked players. It's the higher rank players that understand how the perk works and how to abuse it. A rank 20 brand new player would lack the fundamentals to use the perk properly.
---
Can the mods please just ban this guy already
---
I don't mind losing so long surv so long as you aren't actively running past my teammates - which is what tunneling is.
---
Tunneling most of the time is when you just say "Fuck the objective, I'm going to kill this one guy!!"
---
Send me it bro

There's also a chance I'm not the only blind bunny out there haha.
---
No issues getting into lobbies on my end but the lobbies, as rank 15 killer, while being fast have also been bullshit filled with red/purple ranks instead of my own.
---
After leveling the killers you have for a while you‚Äôll probably get these offerings that will let you try out licensed killers for a game
---
Anti-hemorrhagic syringe add on for medkits allow you to heal yourself or other survivors to full health in a couple seconds. Probs used that.

I‚Äôm an absolute slut for BP so I do it rarely but occasionally if the killer does the slug &amp; hunt I‚Äôll DC for a good teammate so it‚Äôll spawn hatch and give them a chance.

You didn't read the Survivors Rule Book for Killers. You're suppose to let them blind you, no exceptions.
---
I did a 2k continuous chainsaw run on that map where they were all too scared to do a gen and it turned into that description without a single hit.
---
We get it you haven‚Äôt left rank 15 and you think getting lots of kills makes you good when anyone in this community with a brain can tell that Trapper and Doc are underpowered (Clowns ok I just think he needs more bottles)
---
No only on a PSP
---
lol. Heres a little lesson for you. Ahem. Pallets and windows are the only advantages other than exhaustion addons, that can help a survivor. To take away one of those (or two of those (nurse)) is a huge deal. Especially assuming that not every killer can do that (most cant actually). Just because you dont know how balancing works, doesn't mean you go whine on a meme post. zZz
---
Speaking of idiotic comments.
---
Amanda's Letter allows you to avoid any survivor mindgames at pallets with high walls. If you can't use it to counter those pallets, well, enjoy camping rank 20s.
---
Cool? I watched it several times and it gave me a good giggle.
---
To be honest this sounds like hell to play against. Would the Pig get a smorgasbord of different traps to use in every game, or can she only have two (RBT and one of these new ones)?
---
Only PC.
---
I bet it's pretty toxic
---
The survivor isn‚Äôt on the screen when they get hit
---
Now just have a knife behind the bunny with the caption "Adrenaline"

Second Wind probably, Camaraderie will hardly be of any use and Babysitter seems like a worse Borrowed Time.
---
Go ahead and get one pregnant and let us know , by the previous post the chances are pretty low but hey
---
Nurse is better than spirit though
---
1. You dont need to use 4 fingers, that's probably part of the problem.
---
2. Focus on consistently being able to mash space fast with your left thumb or any other finger on the left side.
---
3. Stop being hoes mad every comment i see you getting shit on lmao
---
Even though they were being toxic bringing an ebony Mori as nurse is just the most unfun things you can do, it completely ruins the fun of the match.
---
30% to have a chance to counter something that is map specific
---
Who hurt you
---
Speech 100
---
I'm with you man. As somebody who spends equal time playing both killer and survivor, it makes sense to tunnel and slug in many situations. And if you are a good survivor, or have a good team, it's very possible to overcome it. The game isn't supposed to be easy. I don't blame survivors for looping excessively or blocking the hook.
---
It's a little toxic to drop someone in front of the hatch to mori them. But also who cares. It's just a game. Those people are irrelevant at the end of the day. Don't let things people say on the internet, let alone on DBD effect you.
---
You're fine. Moris are annoying to go against but I never get mad at anyone for using one as long as they aren't bragging that they won or anything.
---
This is so sad
---
What bothers me is survivors opening an exit gate and then sitting there for an eternity waiting for me to come up and swing at them. I'm not giving them extra po8nts just because they ran through the exit and escaped a chase at the same time. If you open the gates and you have your pi8nts and it was a good match, just leave.
---
Lol yea using something the game allows u to use is totally his fault I bet you‚Äôve never used a key to escape before all gens were done üôÑ. Mori is part of the game if u don‚Äôt find it fun to go against it once in every like 50 games than maybe u should stop playing
---
You learn to ignore it.
---
How about cheating?
---
I figured 3% is nice and balanced. Thanks for your input.
---
What new strengths lmao he didn‚Äôt receive any buffs to any other parts of his kit to make up for his main playstyle being removed. Now he‚Äôs just how he was but worse and he was already pretty trash tier. His entire kit is easily countered by good survivors now and anyone that says otherwise is probably the same type of person to say old Freddy was good lol.
---
i highly doubt a high person can mantain a conversation longer than 2 exchanges, much less several. i‚Äôm calling bullshit
---
Spirit absolutely doesn't need a rework lol
---
On console there‚Äôs been many times where it auto collects.
---
Isn't that feng
---
You saw a funny meme, figured hey I can put my spin on that, and made your own version. I upvoted it, and I‚Äôm sure other people did too, so as far as I‚Äôm concerned you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong
---
Using a Key and a Mori are both kinda toxic. Yes, the game allows you to use them but us as players have control on if we use them. Also, telling someone to stop playing a game because they disagree with a mechanic is a horrible way of thinking.
---
holy shit that‚Äôs the worst purchase i‚Äôve ever heard of. 360 dollar dbd? dang.

my dumbass is that trash teammate

MOTHERFUCKING, DEDICATED SERVER
---
Never said you tunneled at all just saying
---
I haven't seen any yet. Cheatings kinda pointless in this game.
---
Correct, but some of us still have ptsd from when he wasn't, and he made you take 5 minutes to mend so, he can stay just where he is imo looool
---
"Sigh....."
---
Nah. Switch has a lot of great games I considered playing anyways, DBD was just the kicker.
---
But they *were* bragging. I forgot to mention it, but the survivor who said ‚Äúsuck my cock‚Äù was also the one who escaped, and he kept gloating and being a cunt about winning against a baby Nurse who was clearly struggling to even see the survivors because of all the corn.
---
Well see even a mediorce nurse is very strong as she completely denies everything the survivors use as a defense which is why I just believe you shouldn't run a Mori on her(or any killer for that matter) as it just makes a already unfun killer even more unfun. Obviously if it's in-game use it but if you're trying to be nice with survivors and make them have enjoyable time then don't bring it
---
It‚Äôs actually really often
---
Why you want to  be better? There is not competitive mode or something like that, this is a casual game you play to have fun
---
Completing the tutorials gets you 50,000
---
Liver of death is actually pretty tight
---
It is indeed a cast. Good movie honestly
---
No?!
---
It's pretty often for me, I'd say 40% of the time or a few times a day I get mori'ed.
---
No. If you play when you're pregnant, you and your baby will die 100% of the time.
---
Isn't that also called Burger King Myers or is that something else?
---
Adrenaline and noed is definitely not toxic, but mories are really common at least in ps4
---
It would depend on the devs discretion, I would prefer that all of them are in every game but I would understand the devs making it so that she can only have 1 of these traps in a game. Keep in mind that setting these traps takes 5 seconds minimum, and if the pig just spends all game placing traps she will lose. The intention is to build up momentum and tokens, and after you've gotten a few hooks to maybe trap a gen and an exit gate, although with this many traps every pig player would play her very different, which I think is really interesting
---
No huntresses thicc thighs make you die from boner
---
No. Just like pregnant women, any virgin who plays this game will die.
---
Yeah, they type toxic messages in chat a lot.
---
Still a lot better than most of the dumbass reposts on here, at least you actually put some work into it rather than just changing the caption.
---
What game do you play where you only play against a mori once in every 50 games?  That is an absurd statement.  Moris are played far more often than that and you know it.
---
Camping killers intensifies.
---
I mean the killer queue is somewhat fast
---
I play late at night on the us servers and it takes 10 to 20 minutes.
---
He‚Äôs always been bad, just exploitable with certain tactics/add-ons.
---
lol I can count on my hand how many times I‚Äôve been moried and I play survivor probably more than I play killer
---
Makes sense, late at night is pretty hard to find a match, specially with school and everything
---
Lmfao
---
I had i a guy message me sayin i didnt blink enough

Oh you misread my comment, in saying using a mori is fine as long as you don't gloat about it. The survivors you're talking about are idiots.
---
Middle one looks so good
---
Yes several lmao
---
Yeah, late at night is really the only time I have to myself. :(
---
Depends, u want to be a try hard, or u want to have fun? If u want to have fun I recommend legion, Myers, ghostface, but if u just want to be good and tryhard then spirit, or Freddy
---
omg yes I want Colin cosmetics for him
---
Didn't they end up having to Nerf release legion or am I thinking of someone else?
---
Oh. :P
---
Not when it‚Äôs the third survivor.  He was only doing so in order to shut the hatch, and got after the final one.
---
Just wow....that's legit pretty hilarious.  That's a new one for me to see a survivor have the audacity to get mad over that.  But seriously stand in place and give them the flashlight saves moving forward.  Apparently thems the rules.
---
I got it from that Chris D‚ÄôElia bit about Eminem lol. I hope I spelled his name right. I usually just type out Marshall Mathers bc I can never spell it lol
---
Oh, look. Another Killer who hasn‚Äôt read the Survivor Handbook for Killers. How cute.
---
For real, though, I am a killer main myself, so I can sympathize. Survivors get their panties in a twist over the most petty things. And you know why? In general, people find it easier to blame something or someone for their failure, rather than accepting their own failure and improving. Granted, things like facecamping can‚Äôt be helped, but in general, people just don‚Äôt Ike to accept their own faults.
---
Lol!  Okay man yeah making sense now.  I've played for 3 years.  Trust me you have a lot of mori games in your future.
---
Fuck em
---
Spirit if you want it to be braindead easy, and don't want to practice and become OP with Nurse.  Leatherface is good beginner killer that comes with BBQ.  Hag isn't a bad option either.
---
I would prefer a perk that removes blood trails rather than another that removes scratch marks personnally.
---
Even some of the generic tiles can be nightmares. Most maps have at least one super survivor favoured map feature anyway. It should be that way I think but it makes sense that killers would want a way to nullify the fast vault to weaken that.
---
Why am I having so many feelings?! Staaaaahp!
---
But if you have the trap on as the last gen gets activated then you can't exit using your adrenaline because it kills you at the gate since it was active, they are forced to either wait for hatch or get it off their head
---
is that a peepee dog
---
Lol I‚Äôm not sure how time played has anything to do with it over the course of 3 years yea I‚Äôd expect it to occur but ur saying 40 percent of ur games That‚Äôs occurring  then it should at least for me be 1 in 10 and it‚Äôs not even that I got days with out even seeing some one get moried
---
Bold of you to assume redditors can use their brain to mindgame spirit on pallets
---
Oink
---
!remindme
---
Survivors: why would you do that?!
---
Killer: because we‚Äôre bad guys, it‚Äôs what we do!
---
All women are beautiful
---
I'd just like a new cosmetic for the killers that don't have any. Meyers - Paramedic, Shirtless, Ghost Sheet, etc. Same with Freddy Krueger and even Leatherface in a way.
---
I see a mori popped every 3 or 4 games lol 
---
It happens way more often than you're trying to claim
---
Sure why not
---
Thanks. Idk why this made me laugh.
---
/delusionalartists 40 BUCKS?
---
I mean against a prayer beads spirit there is essentially no counter play right? Other than just dropping every pallet on the map considering you can‚Äôt loop her unless you wanna take a 50/50 every time
---
"The map is Ormond"
---
Maybe it‚Äôs bc I play Xbox
---
STONKS
---
Who actually says that?
---
Jesus christ lol
---
I‚Äôve actually managed to get away by crawling before; the killer had downed me and one other survivor and left with the latter to hook them, I crawled away towards the tall grass and he ended up losing me. I kept crawling along the map, the killer still searching for me, until through sheer luck, I came across the hatch, dragged my ass over to it, and hopped in. Narrowly getting away.
---
It‚Äôs obvious that you camped and are awful at killer. Devout is telling me you only one hooked everyone, while Chaser is telling me you lost a shit ton of points standing near the hook (probably face to face), while not getting in many chases (three to four).
---
Not really, lots of GGs, fun game, etc. If the killer or survivor was new I see lots of words of encouragement, advice, "it's super hard with only one perk you'll get better", etc 
---
Oddly enough, most of the toxicity I see from playing killer is *when I give a survivor hatch* as there tends to always be someone who yells it me for "giving it to the wrong person." Like sorry Nea, you were good and I had to kill you early, don't get mad that I let the rank 18 Dwight go because you "deserved it  more than he did" lol
---
PS4 has its chat function hidden behind a paywall, you have to buy the DEAD BY DAYLIGHT: MICROPHONE dlc for ¬•20,000
---
That pizza huge
---
no chase perks
---
First three matches of the day i get farmed. One i was moried in.
---
This deserves 10 upvotes
---
Except your logic is flawed. 
---
You're chasing a guy whos almost dead and is going to run around looking for team mates or medkits, Hes almost certainly not going to jump onto a gen straight away and hes not going to try to save the other guy when hes injured.
---
If however you get the other dude, You now have 1 guy injured doing nothing, 1 guy on a hook and another guy has to get off the gen to save him. The 4th might even be healing the injured one too.
---
I've had games against legion where my team spent the whole fucking game selfhealing and no gens got done at all outside of the 1 I did. This is really not uncommon with legion tbh. I also had a game earlier where a legion chased me for ages, tunneled me off hook and got nothing but 1 kill, a shit score and probably a depip.
---
&gt; The clock is always ticking on those gens, and eliminating survivors as quickly as possible slows down that clock.
---
&gt;I almost always tunnel the first survivor.
---
If you really want one dude gone asap then just facecamp.
---
If you're entire gameplan is to hope the other 3 survs are useless then facecamping is the best strategy since the useless ones will just stand around the hook.
---
Don't be surprised when 3 gens pop though.
---
Also what you are intentions are don't matter. We both know you are ruining someones experience because you somehow think it will help you win.
---
I personally don't care as much if people escape, I try to max BBQ stacks and get high BP since that's how you rank up anyway.
---
Sure I can bully one guy down over and over but where is the joy in that - There is a reason the game was not 1 surv against 1 killer - Gaining joy from running a single surv down is lame.
---
Among other advantages survivors have, if you stop and do the math all 5 generators can be completed by 2 survivors in under 4 minutes if they're at all smart about it. (This is assuming they don't hit a single great skill check and don't bring a single toolbox.) Considering just how mind numbingly easy it is to loop an m1 killer for a good minute with some of the map specific buildings like the coal tower, pantry, asylum, etc, the game becomes super survivor sided if they have basic understanding of how to make the most out of a loop. Killers who break this mold and can down survivors fast enough that they aren't trading downs for gens are also the ones that are hated the most. Wonder why....
---
Decisive is definitely not useless unless being tunneled. As long as your not in red ranks most killers can be fooled into going after you within the 1 minute time limit
---
Alright, so not only do you not have anything to contribute, but your memes are woefully misinformed. But thanks for confirming my rank 20 comment

"Using somthing the game allows u to" Ah ok so its alright if i lag switch bc the game lets me &lt;3
---
Ed, Edd n' Eddy cosmetics when
---
You're stuck in the past if you think crouching at a loop is viable anymore, any survivor can simply run away from the loop
---
I did this once. It was great. Haven't been able to do it sense.
---
Whats funny about this meme is that its so popular and its my real life acquaintances photo lmfaooo
---
Personally, I highly doubt Inner Strength will become meta
---
Thanks!
---
Iron maiden is like Monitor and abuse, it only works well on certain killers, Huntress is p good But doc, Nurse, Billy, and LF are amazing with it. 
---
Also People wont be running inner strength much after release, Its good yes. But i doubt it will be meta with the way survivors are right now.
---
Maybe if the EGC is paused while survivors have a trap on head we can revert changes
---
Big Dick energy 100

It‚Äôs punishable but most survivors just take the ez win and loot

I‚Äôm 90% sure it‚Äôs actually not part of Stranger Things and was made specifically for DBD by the developers of the game.

I'm not teabagging, I'm trying to dodge a hatchet to the face :\[

I was like "oh well... there are only two ways this can go"

at least I guessed right

You were munching it too much
---
Yea and I have a daily thats why I use irridescent head
---
Instantly heard it too lol
---
Personally I'd rather shave my pubic hair with a paper shredder than play against Ghost face or Legion
---
With other killers its possible to have meaningful chase with traps, jukes, mindgames unlike with those two its just
---
Hold W+M1=Easy Hook GG

It's worth it for the teabag alone

#1 killer in the game with ebony mori is awful to play against, you dont have to be a god with her, shes still BY A LOOOONG SHOT, the best killer in the game. 
---
people being toxic shouldnt matter. lots of people are assholes. just happens. i just got called a coward, an asshole, a pathetic loser, and a cunt because i exposed someone who was unhooking their friend as ghostface. 
---
so yeah, dont take it personally xD
---
I think he meant what‚Äôs ur main perk setup lol
---
me too tbh
---
I‚Äôve played the game 14 days that time played I‚Äôve had the game longer than 2 weeks. And I‚Äôve already gotten to rank 1 survivor Moris are rare at least in Xbox
---
Jake ii typically play as a strong stealth survivor. I mostly sneak around the map and try and do objectives or make stealth saves and pull the ago of the killer and lose them with his default perks after the saved survivor has gotten away.
---
How can I better my looping when playing a Survivor? I played the game for a decent bit, but I still suck at it.
---
I think you're fine. You definitely made it your own but maybe next time just say you were inspired by "so and so's post" if you do it again.
---
Mmm get those WGLF stacks brotha
---
Yep Blonde Feng, though they do look similar
---
But then they have adrenaline and a pink key.
---
Then the hatchet hits the side of the truck on autohaven

He died last second, I recommend watching the vid
---
Cannibal for bbq, myers for save the best for last and actually having fun at higher ranks.
---
No respect if he wasn‚Äôt the original
---
SEND HELP!!! GOSH DAMN IT!!!
---
You are right it is not an issue, but I wish it was changed to be more useful in a chase to CATCH a survivor instead of just removing the tile completely.
---
jumpscare and attention seeker would be perfect for the game
---
attention seeker you could cause an aura far away somewhere and slip off while your team does generators
---
jumpscare is super useful for when you‚Äôre running from a killer right out of his chase range and being able to get away, running from a tier 1 myers would essentially be like perfectly timed and more practical deadhard
---
Holy shit lmao
---
Not sure why you are getting downvoted. Babysitter and Cam don't seem like top picks at all
---
After playing ghostface for a bit, i watched the first Scream movie on netflix. Not particularly scary but i did enjoy it a lot.
---
If you zoom in on her face, you will change your kind. The only good looking cosmetic dlcs for her cover up her face.
---
Plenty of people on this community say the game  isn‚Äôt scary once you understand how the mechanics work such as looping and what not.
---
I have the neon Nea with the hat with purple highlights it ain‚Äôt bad tbh
---
This is the most blatant example of the killers weapon not make contacting I‚Äôve seen in a long time
---
Always wear your brown pants when you're facing Michael
---
Her armpits are a sneak peek of the demogorgon XD
---
When somebody steps in a trap they snap to the side a bit.
---
Trapper is included in this.
---
XD
---
Mind if I ask for a clean template?
---
It's actally possible to get a "disgraceful defeat". I once got it when a grabbed someone and the entire lobby crashed.
---
It‚Äôs love, Karen, you wouldn‚Äôt understand.
---
nobody said that, it is literally supposed to be a scary game
---
I agree that we shouldn't remove a survivors tools in a chase, but I want to change this oerk from being a bandaid fix for broken tiles into a useful chasing tool. Maybe the numbers are too high, but removing the Entity blocker has got to go imo, so the numbers should be bumped up.
---
You know how each survivor or killer has a teachable? Dwight has a teachable called which allows you to see where other survivors are from certain distance meaning you won't direct the killer to teammates if you have that on.
---
Well he does have ‚Äúleader‚Äù.
---
I‚Äôm honestly convinced you‚Äôve never played the Game map before cause the whole thing is made out of safe pallets and the tears of the looped killers
---
Haven't seen this happen in a couple months.
---
They were pretty good too, probably would have got most of us had this not happened. Was expecting them to DC
---
Yea Ghostface is definitely the safer choice and it's good to see how people like the demogorgon when he comes out and get used to him.
---
You magnificent bastard
---
Repent
---
I don't lie on reddit.  Not worth posting anything if that's the case.  Funnily enough I thought you were the one that was full of shit but maybe our consoles communities are different?  Weird.  I'd say at any given point I probably encounter them 1 in 10 games at red ranks minimum but it varies.  I've had numerous sessions where if does crack near 30-40%.  I've had sessions with my buddy where we will encounter them 3 games straight.  Not worth quitting the game over.  You play long enough and you get used to it.  Always a fun challenge trying to make them waste their moris by escaping anyway.
---
1 million is way too low for the cap in my opinion.
---
No I‚Äôm being 100 percent serious lol. It‚Äôs extremely rare at least to me and even if they bring in a Mori it‚Äôs the green 1 barley ever see the purple and I barley get purples from the blood webs as killer
---
On behalf of all quentin mains F
---
A few days later and I‚Äôve had about 20 more games since I made this post, and you were right. I got a few more toxic-ish if not toxic killers and eventually I wanted to be a toxic player as well, then your comment came to my mind. Wow, what a cycle.
---
His arms have a bit different proportions than human's, but the drawing is great
---
Lol I‚Äôm being serious idk what it is and now I‚Äôm more curious than anythinf

all of these things are natural parts of the game and you complain because you‚Äôre too bad to deal with them

That poor hag losing because of a glitch. This bug may be rare but it bothers me so much when it happens like he could've killed all of us but a glitch completely ruined his match
---
Pure evil
---
That's so cool üòÅ
---
Yeah I felt really bad
---
or he was using the quiet addons
---
Yeah, you know, like, those moments, that happen sometimes
---
in certain situations
---
I expected him to at least be able to break the pallet from in there
---
Dont play for a couple months. Come back to a brown rank killer.
---
Never heard of him.
---
I think I spelt it wrong ohicdo
---
Yeah, it's definitely not the best comparison. I mentioned it specifically because of the upside and ignoring the downside, which I do think is on par with Prayer Beads, and to illustrate why I think Prayer Beads needs a downside, but I could have said it clearer.
---
Toxic. Hypocrite. Possible pedo. Played against the noobs to make content. Spread toxicity among people and made it norm here. Arrogant af. Bug abuser.
---
Holy crap that was loud. A warning would have been nice.
---
So jared fogle in a can and some sea salt atop of it
---
You dont have to beat your spacebar like you beat your meat. 3 or 4 light taps per second is enough to keep struggling on a hook. Any more than that is excessive. Plus youll only ever have to do it for a maximum of 1 minute in a given game
---
Yeah I was pretty close lol
---
Not just in DBD. Any game they played.
---
If you cant cancel a loop as the pig , i think you should be considered the rank 20
---
Those girls don't seem very Christian to me.
---
Yeah I usually try to save the killers if that happens to them. Most of the time they're grateful.
---
how did he get 8k if he was just guarding the basement chest?
---
Me too except I never make it to 1 mil in the first place
---
I enjoy playing against Iri head. It makes for some tense games and escaping it feels extra rewarding. Iri head + belt is extremely powerful, but it's not a free win for huntress. Iri head by itself is actually more challenging and kudos to a huntress that pulls a win out of it.
---
What? Are we pretending that most of you don't teabag, get rekt, then DC? LOL
---
I'm talking only about dbd. However, he wasn't better in any other game.
---
I‚Äôm not sure! We were all running around down there with him so maybe from chase points?
---
I know. I was just adding to his list of shit things for anyone wondering. :)
---
I dunno. Billy in a wife beater doesnt leave a lot to the imagination. Mikey boi however looks like he just evenly stuffed a bunch of couch cushioning in his jump suit so he ends up looking like a walking, heavy breathing rectangle with big shoulders.
---
As a survivor, I love how dead hard essentially gives you three hits before downed and 2 if you're already injured.
---
I feel the exact same way, I've just has a match against a Micheal and had a Feng sit in the basement and self care and went into a locker every time she heard a slight terror radius, or I just have matches which are just I'm the only one doing generators while the survivors just  search for ruin and waste multiple minutes without finding it. Being a solo survivor is a headache that's for sure.
---
Nope try again lol.
---
I'm pretty sure it continues to drain your toolbox too even though for those few seconds you're not progressing on the gen
---
Fire up and Remember Me are pretty useless. Especially fire up
---
Clearly isnt doing his job if theres 3 people there
---
You know there's a list with the demogorgon right? (Even though he isn't out I'm just saying you could make a tier including him and say your thoughts and how much you'll play him.
---
The only was to free yourself is to play nurse, no other way
---
I dont want to call this out on bullshit in case i get wooshed
---
two and a half gens
---
He's not out yet so I didn't include yet (specified in the title)
---
I'm sure I'm gonna play him a lot tho. He was quite the fun on PTB.
---
Pig is great fun and really underrated in my opinion.
---
Mookel Myron
---
Ghost face when he first dropped lmao
---
A repost for sure but a welcomed one
---
I don't know about console but there's many ways to counter her but it's all pretty situational and difficult to perform. Some simple but effective ways of baiting her are vaulting a window 2 times in a row and trailing scratch marks etc. Never stay to loop at a pallet, just drop it and keep running.
---
You can bait her like you do with Nurse and her blinks, but yeah it's a 50/50 chance most of the time. 
---
Once you're injured, you're dunzo as she can hear your grunts like a mile away in her phasewalk (unless of course you're running Iron Will)
---
I usually have fun playing against the spirit but it's most likely because I'm a spirit main and know how to counter her.
---
Iron will is probably the best perk to counter her as the spirit will lose track of you most of the time.
---
Also gotta remember to run from side to side or do figure 8's or some shit while running away from her because that can really throw her off while she's exiting phasewalk and she might miss the hit.
---
Videos are boring and repetitive to say the least. Noob3 can is sometimes considered ToXiC but regardless of whether you think thats true, his videos are far more entertaining. If you want pure dbd talent and no memes, watch TrueTalent. If you want kind of a half-n-half between those two then monto is good to watch too. Just dont ever watch ocido. Hes been using the same "pew" sound effect for flashlight spamming for about a year now i think.
---
Guess I just wasted a perk slot on balanced landing.
---
Girl that top with that skirt mhm
---
We get it, you run Insidious Bubba. No need to post a screenshot of it on a daily basis.
---
Playing solo survivor can be a real struggle, but you have to go into it with the mindset of not caring about whether you escape or get destroyed. You can't control how good or bad your 3 teammates are (or if they're straight up trolls.) 
---
Its super frustrating when you're trying to win, but I've found it really does make the game more enjoyable if you just laugh it off when your teammates are terrible. Go in with low expectations and you won't be disappointed.. most of the time anyway lol.
---
I find it also helps that whenever I start getting tilted from playing solo survivor, I take a break and play some killer.
---
feed me more...the more u comment the more i enjoy it American boy...:-))))
---
Had this happen once. Lucky for me, the survivor I was chasing was kind enough to help get me out.
---
:-))))
---
I don't think so. I think they can't do anything with the pallet, otherwise they could just break it.
---
Especially appropriate using Jan aince she is just as insane as Myers.
---
Just needs (baby) Dwight getting up from the (generator) desk: "... MICHAEL!"
---
Not quite true, the survivors can get you out if they have mercy. If you manage to grab them off the pallet while they crawl over it while injured it'll pull you out.
---
ok :-))
---
Start watching people who make dbd tutorials on youtube. Channels like painkiller and Notzdarva are great at getting a head start among newbie bewbies
---
I spent 400k on nea just to get lvl 1 pebble
---
Nah the problem wasn't that he tried to use the chainsaw, it was that he tried to change directions for about 1 and a half minute instead of realizing that it doesn't work.
---
You arent kidding. Every killer that gets stomped lately just dcs lol.
---
Yep basically sums demogorgon chases just, shred that's it just shred
---
I heard that you can grab an injured vaulting survivor and that frees you.
---
Why do people care why people hate him?

it stands for "No question is too stupid to ask"
---
Me and my friends bust up every time the, "daily" excuse gets used. I was wondering if killers realize they are all using that same excuse lol.
---
How tf you gonna message a survivor?
---
Some people have fun in different ways lmaoo
---
&gt; Is there a double bloodpoints event and if so when does it happen
---
There's one planned but we don't know when.
---
&gt; when does the stranger things dlc drop
---
Nobody in here knows. We're all waiting for the official release date.

Theres a moon? What would create the light?

you ever played dbd? lag is constant

Well I don't think most people play this game with a "gameplan" in mind, or too perform with 100% efficiency at any given moment.
---
A tip for landing skillchecks
---
Remember, that there's an input delay and a delay between when you think you pressed the button and when you actually pressed it
---
aim a little bit before the great zone and adjust over time. remember, that you're there to learn. you'll get it eventually
---
also, if you have problems with your framerate, don't look exactly at the skillcheck arrow. estimate its speed. the icon might "jump" but the value goes up smoothly. The game looks at the value, not the icon
---
He hasn‚Äôt been around in a bit but his reference gets mentioned every now and again. The response to his mention is usually along the lines of ‚Äúfuck that guy‚Äù. I imagine players/posters that aren‚Äôt too old wonder why this guy is so universally hated.
---
What if you had a key And adrenaline
---
tbh i hate getting into 2nd stage so i‚Äòd rather get farmed
---
Doesn‚Äôt make it any less wrong
---
Addon reworks
---
How can we or the devs fix this?
---
Xbox and ps4 player can do that!
---
One of the last Q&amp;A streams. They confirmed that they will rework her addons
---
Not our jobs to fix it. The devs get paid to figure this out. We've complained about this for years.
---
just camp!
---
I've never noticed that there exists a moon in this game
---
&gt; No tech support questions ('I'm getting x bug/error, how to fix this?'); please use the official forum or our weekly Bug Report/Tech Support Megathreads.
---
I can see why that dude died with 6000 points
---
I'm always nice to killers in chat.
---
Some tiles have such ludicrous spawns with other tiles that at times bamboozle seems like the only feasible method as to counter them.
---
On top of this, most players won't run this perk simply because tiles can be cut off as to purposefully shorten them.
---
This perk only kills terrible loop spawns and infinites. It doesn't need a change until both of those go, and even then because at that point the perk would need a buff as to give it some use again. 
---
Window vaulting as killer should be rarely done in general. Giving it a speed boost at the cost of any of the perks utility is robbery when most killers won't vault anyways simply because if you vault enough as to declare bamboozle necessary you are just playing badly.
---
The only real window that is consistently vaulted for mindgaming or catching survivors is a double back at shack, which would benefit more from having the red stain vanish temporarily.
---
You shouldn't see Adrenaline as an exhaustion perk
---
you can run multiple exhaustion perks, but you can only use one per chase.
---
you SHOULDN'T run any other exhaustion with Sprint Burst, because you'll get no chances to use them
---
You can run Dead Hard + Balanced Landing to have options depending on the situation
---
You can add Head On to anything, as it isn't really a chase exhaustion perk.
---
This is not an LFG thread?
---
Hatch can't spawn when the traps are arranged on it. How he guessed, I have no idea. Maybe he blocked the hatch with all the traps?
---
Would this be getting updated when Demo\~Daddy, Nancy and Steve arrive? &lt;3
---
The 17th most likely
---
I guess that can happen to anyone. I personally stopped getting super worked up about pips a long time ago mainly just because i dont like high ranks. Im at rank 3 too (first time at survivor red ranks) just because i dont want to rank my killer up tok high. But i just roll with the mentality that if i pip, i pip, and if i dont, my games after rank reset will be easier. 
---
I just dont like for my gaming experiences to be frustratingly difficult especially if i cant figure out how to get better because even if i do win a hard fought victory, i'll be too pissed about how frustrating it was to get there to enjoy it.
---
It's a game, they'll live lol
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Again doesn‚Äôt make it any less wrong
---
Hm, I don't think I got Tenacity. Mayhaps I should get it.
---
I'd personally not play Nurse as your first killer. She goes around the mechanics of the game.
---
You'll learn how to play Nurse, but only nurse. her skillset doesn't translate into any other killer
---
By playing others, you'll properly learn how all killers work. I'd start playing Nurse once you get to rank 10 with other killers
---
Child.
---
H-how dare you!?!
---
I thought these types of spots were fixed
---
Sorry for the other asshole who said it's a stupid question. Don't mind him!
---
If you have trouble with the abbreviations this community is using, check out this page: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/glossary
---
So if they don't have enough experience than you they're a toxic a noob? Okay. 
---
Your words not mine.
---
Choose 4 gens close together that you like at the start of the game and put your traps around them. Hag gets better the smaller the map is. You can just ignore a part of the map to make the map technically smaller for yourself
---
see you in hot :)
---
(Yes I know it's out of frame)
---
No, I meant the old players who had been there way longer than us if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking
---
So jump-scare is just a better sprint burst?
---
Umm no, only perks you need is current bamboozle and 3 stacks of Fire Up, no ultra rares at all...
---
People have been asking this question since forever though. When he was still streaming Dbd (before his bans) people also asked why Ochido (and Noob3 at that time) was so universally hated. It's not a new question from possible newcomers.
---
In this vid last second.
---
Don't you know that shitting on Legion isn't cool anymore?
---
I‚Äôm hoping I can eventually reach a level of zen where I don‚Äôt care anymore. I play this game in my downtime to try and have fun, but recently it‚Äôs just irritating.
---
Same except reverse "killer" and "steve"
---
Why is this so fucking funny
---
Reversed positions would actually be funnier imo
---
watch scott junds video on how to run tiles as a killer, it applies to both survivor and killer
---
Yes, but not in the context they're talking about...
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d2m6su/they_need_to_remove_ebony_morris_from_the_game/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Nah he is just basement security
---
I had this a couple days ago but with brutal
---
killer.
---
(I got entity displeased :( )
---
I got a lot of shit for running sprint burst to the point I picked up BL and DH.
---
Now I'm conflicted.
---
At a Jungle Gym, you block off the window and now the survivor has no choice but to drop the pallet, same with shack. The killer gives up trying to outplay the survivor and get a hit or down in favour of just having the pallet thrown immediately, which is good but boring for both sides, and may just prolong the chase depending on tile spawns.
---
This change will STILL allow both sides to outplay each other bc the window isnt blocked, AND give killers a reason to vault windows, as you correctly stated is a thing to avoid currently. Again it doesn't NEED to be changed, but at high ranks it doesn't really do much for you right now except for infinites.
---
That tactic only works against rank 20s bud, the MOMENT I see the pig crouch at a loop I can EASILY abandon it and go to a different one because she slows herself down doing that
---
Yikes. Insulting someone over a video game. Couldn't be me.
---
I remember me and my friends saving a baby dwight from a camping nurse. We ran across the entire map to the exit gate and somehow didn't lose anyone.
---
Best part was that me and my friends got the "Unforgettable getaway" achievement.
---
It can also help in chases, although it's risky. You can move faster than walk speed when you're evading, which makes it safer to regain exauhstion in chases, but you gotta make some distance first.
---
I‚Äôve seen people get grabbed of a gen in the first 5 min and get facecamprd

#RemoveTheMoon
---
deadass feel this fucking post fam, got dbd a month ago, immediately paid for the ram skull huntress outfit, play like this :^[
---
Have you heard about morals?
---
This made me spit my toast out.
---
Well done.
---
STOP. IT'S TUMOUR TIME!
---
Nothing fun for the basement security when that's all you do too. But at least you both did your damn jobs and succeeded.
---
Are you really talking about morality in a game where people are killed in different brutal ways on regular basis? Lmao
---
Its a good perk for immersed players. Hide and if the killer finds you, sprint to the closest loop.
---
no matter how you spin it its just not fun ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I know exactly how they work, and that's why I'm saying it's a problem. You shouldn't be able to just hold M1 and spin around just to exploit active frames of a swing. Plus Spirit's lunge is way more forgiving than most killers. It's all very unintuitive and needs revising.
---
Not really a reason not to let others play the game
---
‚ÄúYou take the moon, and you take the moon, and you take the moon, and you take the moon!  You take the moon, and you take the moon, and you take the moon, and you t-tttttttt ake-ake!**!** !  Moooooon mooooooon mmmmo-ooo-on mmmmmooooonnnn!‚Äù- Chef Mung Daal

500k spent to do a 60k daily ...STONKS
---
Sprint burst is good for nicking hook saves, agains't stalking killers, and keeping it 99% recovered to baamboozle killers mid chase at whatever point you see fit B) Very good at bambozeling billies/nurses and bubbas.
---
I think people going for Adept Steve, will probably be the most self sacrificial people out there.
---
To be honest, his perks look garbage, but I like them and will use them.
---
Just throw Camaraderie on with Nancy's Fixated and Inner Strength.
---
I don't know if they do work well together, but please people who have played the PTB tell me if it works.
---
*it‚Äôs all coming together*
---
Nice repost bud im the og poster
---
you're the only person other than me who uses that jake jacket, good taste.
---
I think he'd be buyable with Iridescent Shards.
---
It could be false since none characters were purchasable without auric cells.
---
man, what the fuck is this? who made you the leading authority on who gets to decide what's toxic and what's not?
---
I'm not putting others interests over mine. If they aren't having fun, then it is their problem, not mine.
---
I recently bought Plague too, and I'm enjoying her. I find that it's usually the survivors who dictate my playstyle in a match, and if 3 of them aren't cleansing and one of them is, then I'm pretty much going to have a jolly time. Them staying sick also helps me hear them when the boys are trying to be sneaky, so I'm fine being a M1 killer.
---
Then again, I'm in green rank.
---
#goals
---
She's got a certain different playstyle due to how her counterplay works. Either survivors willingly give you what is probably the best attacking tool in the game being essentially a ranged stream of hatchets that's really hard to miss, or they all remain in an easily tracked state where they go down in one hit.
---
Often survivors will do the latter, so you want to be running chase-oriented perks like Endfury and addons that give you free corrupt fountains. With these, Plague can become really, really scary as she's honestly like a permanent T3 Myers just without the initial shock factor.
---
I have 1k+ hours and just found out there‚Äôs a tutorial.
---
Who the fuck focuses this much on the moon?
---
Flashlight clickers are funny to me, especially when they have a trap on their head and they walk right in front of a crouched pig... Like, what do you expect to happen
---
Bb dweet :(
---
i like hot david
---
Step 1: play Nurse.
---
Step2: equip Knockout, Deerstalker, Third Seal, A Nurses Calling.
---
Step 3: Never hook. I MEAN **NEVER**.
---
Step 4: everyone de-pips.
---
Ok, but we're actually really short so don't tell anyone.
---
Nice perks fam i only have a problem with atention seeker the pocentage is to high for me. They can just heal 4 times and get free 100% bp make ti like 20 or 15%
---
I think we may have, friend, as that sounds like an incredibly accurate depiction of my very own Nea. Depends though, were u playing pc?
---
[The killer](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/youtubepoop/images/c/cf/Edzilla_ID.gif/revision/latest?cb=20140705225150)
---
Nope PS4. My Nea had the name toxiccnea and honestly wasn't surprised when I got that message from them. We probably just got really similar Neas
---
F
---
Both rely on predictions of the opponent‚Äôs behavior, and are considered legitimate mind-gaming skills.
---
In a way, yeah, everything is a guess
---
Definitely Otzdrava he gives tips to new players and always comments on his gameplay and his fans are pretty nice.
---
Mission failed, we'll get em next time
---
stop bullying the wraith boi
---
Get ready for this one boys üçø
---
Aight. Lmao. Randomly start attacking me cus I said a games bad. Solid plan there buddy. Reddit in a nutshell I guess. How dare I have a differing opinion.
---
Oh yeah and #RemoveTheMoon. Togeheter we can fight this.
---
Make HybridPanda the ShrineMaster!
---
I love Woody_15's Community and NightBun's community's, both are really nice people, and are both friends of mine :)
---
If a video game ruined your day, it probably wasn't an eventful day.
---
When I seen fixated I instantly knew that immersed players had an orgasm.  
---
now yes its a good perk but survivors that hate super immersed players that don't help or do anything to the team are gonna be annoyed. (no all immersed players are like that but its usually Claudette that are boosted because they hide and barely help)

Licensed characters aren't purchaseable with Iridescent shards far as I know, just auric cells.
---
It‚Äôs hard to find some form of enjoyment if you aren‚Äôt able to play
---
Depipping while staring at hooks for shit bloodpoints is your interests?  Pretty sad man.  What's even the point of playing the game lol?
---
He's doing his best dammit.
---
I never said it was a bad thing, right?
---
I‚Äôm just trying to do a daily for survivors(I‚Äôm a killer main) so I‚Äôm at rank 14 and after 6 games of facecamping I got an actual game
---
*Excuse me,* *can you* spare a moment for *our Lord and Saviour, the Entity?*
---
Dweet i stg if you don‚Äôt get in that hatch in the next 5 seconds i will obliterate you!
---
The plague is just designed shitty, she depends on her power, if the survivors dont cleanse she is just an m1 killer
---
BING BONG BOI
---
Clown cosmetic which makes the knife a red balloon for it chapter 2?
---
More then you know, that cuts deep
---
From your mouth to the entity‚Äôs ears!
---
Edgar in my opinion
---
Gonna laugh if it‚Äôs the same nea but different versions of the game. Like they bought all the same cosmetics and use the same perks but play both versions.
---
Its the worst exhaustion perk by far, it forces you to walk everywhere, noobs use it because it seems good to players who have no idea what they are doing
---
All fun until you wake up in the middle of the night to notice Spine Chill flickering.
---
Your communicating your thoughts perfectly fine. Except for why you think the game is good. You never actually explained that. You've demanded I leave the Reddit and your post multiple times simply for offering a dissenting opinion and opening up a discussion about the topic you posted. Which again is the entire point of Reddit. Tbh I don't really understand why you are getting so angry over this.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with any of them?
---
Yes personal insults because I reminded you about one of the simplest features on EVERY console. My bad for pointing that out to you bud. If you‚Äôd... im not sure.. reread my original post, I said how simple yet complex the game is CAN make it great. It has its flaws but, what I was trying to reiterate here, which you continue to fail to get, is how great the game CAN be.
---
I‚Äôm gonna run this build and try to get people to play along. You open the chest i let you go, if not...
---
Not getting angry, it‚Äôs a brick wall at this point. That‚Äôs why you can leave
---
I don‚Äôt understand and i wish i did.
---
Okay I will
---
console bubba with insidious noed lmfao i'd love to play against you
---
oh my god how bad can console players be oml also that first hatched didn't hit
---
Practice is a good start, but it really comes from having an idea to begin with
---
Intriguing but highly disturbing
---
It was when people first start playing it. But it just becomes completely not scary anymore. Other than a few moments like this video aha
---
Otz
---
I keep around 800k before new releases.
---
Because the best SWF troll is to burn all your party streamers after a ptb before a big release..  bbq +4 party streamers = possible 192k blood points.  Just think.. one match and because they were near cap they could miss out on 150k bp.
---
The thing is that you aren't supposed to be able to be hit instantly off the hook. You are _supposed_ to have time to, say, Dead Hard. But it is broken atm and you can still get hit before you are allowed to move. And besides, the change isnt supposed to guarantee an escape or anything. It should be to have that possibility of escape, that hope. And if it fails the Killer gets more points, so I don't see any harm in adding it. At best it creates fun and tense moments and at worst it gets everyone more points.
---
This feel like a nerf to me
---
Thank you. I‚Äôve always enjoyed art but taken too long with getting simple things just right to do it. I might be able to find my old scratch art to show but idk where i put it
---
Scratch Art(Can‚Äôt remember the actual name): Use a sharp object(exacto-knife, razor, etc) to scratch dark off light to sketch lines in instead of drawing dark on light.
---
So why exactly do you post the same fucking shit as in older post, but with different characters?
---
I don‚Äôt need to. If you play the game you should know what I mean.. lol
---
Generally, killers do this to derank without being AFK reported.
---
Yeah thats just rank 10-20's in general, they dont know how to play properly and when they get flashlight saved, looped for a while they get annoyed and camp
---
If you google "he's doing his best dammit" you'll see it's a common, playful meme.
---
Oh yeah, dude that art styles simplicity is why it's so fun, I remember loving creating those
---
Ah. Hadn‚Äôt seen that.
---
Lmao. So I need to explain and detail why the game is bad for my opinion to matter and not be disregarded entirely but you are allowed to just blanket statement the game and it's totally cool? Alright man its been fun but I think I'm gonna call it at that. Go ahead and comment at me a bunch more so you can get the last word but I'm done lol. Have a good one.
---
Yeah. Had to do it in a art class a few years back and recreated Smaug‚Äôs eye over the course of like 4-6 weeks or so.
---
Amateur. Have 8.7k shards so you can afford 3 regular perks + a new perk on the shrine.
---
I meet this guy too. I start to get hit when I touch the item chest.
---
This is the dumbest shit I have seen on this subreddit
---
People who say they can‚Äôt hit them or use console frame rates as an excuse are just bums, it‚Äôs really not that hard
---
You just accept the lowest point value daily you've completed each day, then the new one replaces it. If it gets close to the day and you have 3 over 30k, you just keep them.
---
Or play some depressing matches with Devour Hope or Rancor.
---
As a person he sucks but he makes a sem-decent content, yes a 122 episodes of literally the same stuff but it's still funny from time to time.
---
What is our best guess for new patch rollout?
---
SUCC
---
....o...okay?
---
This is literally the equivalent of walking into a restaurant and notifying all the staff that you had just eaten and you're full.
---
If anything, video games has taught me to control my most intense emotions. 
---
And no matter what your parents say, that's powerful.
---
c o n t e x t
---
Bruh that's me
---
Then other survivors or killer would bully me just because I personally like swamp and indoor maps :c
---
You ruined it. You‚Äôre that amateur that you haven‚Äôt unlocked all teachables. Shards = BP or cosmetics when you hit end game
---
I've meet this very strong swf legacy 3 group as a wraith and they we're extremely good at looping, it really took every inch of my willpower not to dc, ah they also told me i was complete shit in post game chat and i should die in a ditch or something. So i can understand why people would disconnect facing oponents like that.
---
Cursed
---
\-
---
I would go for nancy first cuz of her inner strength
---
I've been running if for a few days for memes, can't say that tenacity was ever worth it. Speed increase isn't as great as I expected from +50% and if you are slugged, unbreakable alone will do the job just fine. There might be some extremely rare cases where tenacity would make a difference, but it would just be a waste of perk slot in majority of matches.
---
It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs honest work.
---
It does already....
---
Which of the 3 should i lvl first: demogorgon, steve or nancy?
---
Surviors op killers weak pls nerf.
---
Huntress and Plague looked super laggy on the first dedicated servers. How was it later?
---
You missed my point complete then assumed I was boosted. Have you ever gone against a J.Myers Memorial and Tuft of hair Myers with an ebony Mori that is higher than rank 5? Trust me it is game over very quickly but this killer slugs you to get his 4k every time. I have been up against him 5 times now. He isn't using any new perks, he isn't using the new map offering and when I did play up against him and we loaded into the new map he DCed because it is a shit map for Myers that isn't using scratched mirror. Like I have said 50 times before, if your testing OP stuff on the new survivor or the new killer that is fine I encourage it but if you are ONLY playing the PTB as an excuse to be as toxic as possible by using OP offerings with OP add-ons and items you wouldn't usually use in main game (because you would lose them) then stop doing it.
---
Might wanna adjust your fly, your noob is showing.
---
Perks are worth 2700 IS/250k BP the first time they're on the shrine, it has nothing to do with which ones you've unlocked.
---
D A R N
---
I've noticed yesterday I played against Bubba which didn't destroy and pallets, he would just commit to a semi safe pallet for like 3 minutes and then face camp, he would later do exactly the same for the next survivor, in the end he had like 10k bp and depip. Point is, you can just play without breaking pallets, practice which ones are safe and which ones just take too long to catch someone, that way you'll spend like 5 minutes chasing one person and the game should be over by then.
---
No. I don't want you to being in an instant medkit every round because you get it back at the end of the PTB. We are supposed to be playing like normal no "who can use the most OP stuff because we will get it back"
---
And you just have to click that flashlight when you do something good, right?
---
I agree with this, fuck swamp
---
/s
---
(actually fuck swamp though, but farming is a bit extreme)
---
'Toxic build' AKA build to help you survive.
---
Never asked you to explain. This was a thread about how good the game.. wait for it.. CAN be. I‚Äôm not sure how incomprehensible that is to you. But it‚Äôs simple. You called it trash on a thread saying it CAN be good. That‚Äôs your mistake bud. Thank you for calling it cuz it was getting annoying explaining it over and over and over and over
---
Now for Carters Spark.
---
Red forest offerings are so toxic.
---
So you can tunnel that Nea who used Haddonfield offering :D
---
Which of the nine teachables do you want most?
---
They were wearing the classic toxic Nea, neon blue hair, face mask, and they were using a flashlight.
---
Also to clarify I am a human as well and not a lizard person that is a preposterous notion silly ~earthling~ friend
---
I mean I don't run Iron Will and survive. I was going to do SC, SB, Adrenaline and DS but DS is trash after the nerf at high ranks because killers rarely tunnel, SC is one of the worst perks in the game right now. Bl is better then SB and I included adrenaline.
---
I few months ago, I had a Plague accusing me of tryharding when I run non-meta perks like We'll make it and Lithe, not even using any items, all the while she had BBQ, Ruin, NOED and one more perk I forgot...nowadays you're basically a tryhard if you don't just automatically give up and let them have a win.
---
Red rank survivor here: I don‚Äôt use it becuase I can‚Äôt choose when to use it unless I‚Äôm straight MONITORING cooldowns. I‚Äôll stick to my lithe
---
Nice moonwalk!
---
It's required to force the survivor to face X direction.
---
Username checks out
---
Inner strength,but i also want the killer. So its more a nancy or demogorgon question :)
---
I just want more perks in the bloodweb already smh
---
Bold of you to assume solo survivors aren‚Äôt assholes who will use you working on a gen as a distraction
---
I feel he'll be an uphill climb for your first killer, but if you like their concept and their playstyle then that'll go a long way to helping you stick with it.
---
Well there you go. Just get both.
---
Thanks man, hope dbd will fix these problem, i love this game
---
If you tbag, point at me and flashlight me, I will 100% do this to you, you piece of shit lmfao
---
Omg thank you so much
---
Don‚Äôt join laggy games then? Its available for you to see in a lobby?

---
It‚Äôs worth it if your a dedicated player.
---
1st you don‚Äôt have to prestige to share teachables
---
2nd the difference between a non-prestige and a p-3 blood web are noticeable but barely.
---
3rd p-3 cosmetics are a way to assert dominance over your friends and enemy‚Äôs.
---
I think it slightly increases the chance to get better items in the bloodweb but personally I haven't really noticed a difference. If you do prestige make sure you have a decent amount of bloodpoints to spend right after you prestige so the character has some unlockables. I mostly prestige for bragging rights. Do it if you want to

I didn‚Äôt, i explain it clearly i even show my pip percents (i think) with 0% whatever its called when you stand near the hook and i did one hook everyone and they were all hooked before they could save, and another thing about the chaser remember how i said the match was about 3-5 minutes,i cant chase them when they are all already hooked after 5 minutes.Notice I‚Äôm rank 12 I‚Äôm not dumb enough to face camp they would just do gens and sure I Might be "awful‚Äù you say but i still got a 4k so i should pip at least once since i didn‚Äôt face-camp,only had to hook them once to kill them all,and also quickly killed them.
---
either a survivor was really annoying the killer, the exit gates are already open, or the killer is new and doesn't know any better

Why does Dwight's prestige face look like he just rubbed marinara sauce himself while the other Prestiged actually look bloody, why in the lobby menu Hag and Freddy show their opposite hand and not their weapon,how is clown so fast but so fat at the same time, why are the hatchets on huntress so much smaller then the ones she pull out like wtf.

Acquaintances with billy ?Hope you didn't turn like him lmao that would be unfortunate.

Not for me, just a twitch streamer I watch. That's the dude in the pic
---
Technically you were camping at the chest, sooooo they weren't that wrong, were they? Or did you hook them after they came looking for you?
---
Im always nice to survivors when I play killer in chat ^^
---
Bing bing?
---
Oh, i just got that
---
I did this yesterday its one of my things to do with leather
---
Hey! I‚Äôve played against him before he did the same thing to us!
---
Ahhhhhhh NOED RUN LIKE HELL!!!!!!!
---
Ahh i see, thank you for sharing that information. i think i might just leave my killers/survivors at 50.
---
I'm just confused about the last one, because he seems to be no longer active? But congrats!
---
Nice!
---
It‚Äôs really off putting to suddenly hear ‚Äúgroovy‚Äù when a Ash joins the lobby. Having voice lines is really cool but it still scares me every time he speaks.
---
It's all gonna go crashing down with these perks
---
Played a game where we couldn't even find the killer in the basement and heard literally no heartbeat. We all exited and saw in the endgame tally that it was a wraith with only insidious equipped.

check reply to /u/crazy_void

I use it with urban evasion so that i can crouch around then sprint off if seen .. I like to do gens rather than loop the killer as im not that great at that .. I also run with Poised so as soon as the gen is done i can sprint towards the next one with no scratch marks
---
I try to do this on PC but everyone has their notifications off, resulting in me just giving hatch anyway.
---
makes you able to recover while crawling, you also crawl faster.
---
made with mematic
---
I‚Äôm gonna need some info.
---
1. Survivor, killer, or 50/50?
---
2. If killer: favorite killer? 
---
If survivor: favorite survivor and favorite perk?
---
If 50/50: do what you want &lt;3
---
3. Favorite drink (alcoholic or non)?
---
Head on too
---
Yup, I'm trash
---
You play like a rank 20
---
all the better for ouchy ouch stabby ouch stab ouchy you with
---
Freddy is underestimated overall.  The snares are great.  Outside of very high level survivors the pallets are very strong as well.  People get comfortable thinking they have a pallet and they basically give you a free hit thinking they're getting a free stun.
---
I see what you're saying but it simply doesn't work out that way in my experience. Sometimes the survivor does hop on a gen immediately. And I'll usually injure another survivor in the tunneling process(but I'll still ignore him otherwise, usually). Face camping is a dumb strategy because once people realize you are face camping they will rush gens. Tunneling has movement around the map.
---
All I was saying about my intentions was that they aren't founded in bullying one survivor, I'm simply trying to kill everybody. I know it feels like bullying to new players either way.
---
I'm having pretty damn good results doing what I'm doing. But not all Killers follow the same logic obviously.
---
\\O/
---
Once he gets me, I literally do something else like checking my phone, grabbing some snacks, etc. 
---
Once a Trapper messaged me after slugging for the entire endgame timer saying that he wanted to give me the hatch and why I was not moving(as I said, I was in the kitchen). I saved the replay on my PS4 and ge literally dropped me in the front of the hatch, closed it, and waited for the entity to kill me. 
---
And this is why this community is toxic af. 
---
Both sides tho.
---
Looks like something I would put up my ass
---
thats not really what i meant but thanks i guess
---
Maybe they're a lurker?
---
Relax bruv

Im offended

Bad manners to drop a pallet?

---
Nice insult tho. I think you are overly offended right now l m a o
---
Same! Sometimes you just get lucky, but youll never know unless you try to get away.
---
I saw this same guy camping the basement with trapper once he hooked down there
---
Lmao what else did they expect
---
Think like a Killer. [ScottJund's guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ) can help with that.
---
Otherwise, OhTofu has [several](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA/search?query=loop) guides on running pallets, structures, and specific maps.
---
If you are a dedicated player it is. Also, in the future, they could add new features to prestiges so Im doing it in all my mains. Take advantage of the double bloodpoint events
---
Endgame collapse, after the exit gates are opened you have I believe 2 minutes to leave or everyone on the map dies
---
Nah, people would still run it. Plenty of people run it with dead hard just for the stagger reduction, including me
---
Personally I have all my survivors at level 50 with Jane P3 50 and Bill P1 50 just for consistency and because I like the characters. I think I‚Äôm still going to prestige Bill fully and maybe Nea but that‚Äôd be it     
---
As my recommendation to you? Not worth it unless your dedicated to the game or (if you have a main character) just putting all your bp to that one character for a while.
---
Jumped outta my damn chair!
---
The GAME and uhhhhhh the carnival (I can‚Äôt remember the name of it)

Thanks

Literally every comment other than yours has so many negative points it's hidden. We walk among a graveyard.

I gotta see if this is true this afternoon

U don't get banned for no reason

Bleeded
---
I never said I did? I was wondering what constitutes Unsportsmanlike.
---
Great video! Got a few laughs out of me lol
---
lol. so right.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see your doctor cosplay.
---
Otzavarda and Badgerocity both on twitch. For a small streamer Badgerocity is amazing. Just a warning he's rank 4 but has like no teachables so his builds/playstyle are weird
---
Holy shit I thought the entity got rid of them but nope I‚Äôm wrong
---
yes my man
---
Every Watch Otz?
---
Ah. Took me a minute to hear it.
---
Purposely screwing over the team stuff like that
---
he got a lot of basement time ^^^^^/s
---
When tombstone Myers gets you
---
That's with the tombstone, it's much quicker without
---
It works.
---
I just prestiged my main to p3 but as for the other survivors they can just stay at 50.
---
I have never played survivor though. Only have ever gotten to rank 9 as killer but that was so long ago. I mainly between 16-12 now. What about killer?
---
The legions map
---
I think unsportsmanlike means you either hookcamped or tunneled somebody (even though you should play how you want) either that or salt messages idk tho I‚Äôve never been banned.
---
That‚Äôs why i had the /s. I knew you probably didn‚Äôt play nurse and just did it for the memes or another reason.
---
If he did then it‚Äôs kinda odd but who cares really? It‚Äôs an annoying situation for anyone and he‚Äôs playing literally the worst killer in the game too.
---
I tried to do something similar
---
Mmm teaming with a survivor. I cant think of anythin else off the top of my head

Is that what you did?
---
Another person said it would be for Camping and tunneling. Does that sound correct
---
I knew that the timer was messed up but I had already been using them. At first I thought they were just really good paired up but then caught a YouTube video that they were glitched so I switched over to Freddy. 
---
Oh well, I can wait the 7 days. Thanks again!
---
I've seen this guy loads of times before on PC. Been about half a year since I last played though, so nice to see he's still doing it.
---
It‚Äôs the opposite for me I learned how to bully from him
---
You can be banned for unsportsmenlike for rage quitting as that's in the description on that reporting topic. So maybe you dc'd on a lot of games and got banned for it?
---
To bm at the pallet.  They are dancing around in this photo.
---
Spirit bad give me upspagoots.
---
It‚Äôs solved! I was most likely banned for the Legion knives glitch. They just didn‚Äôt ban me for 3 weeks but by then I had already stopped playing.
---
Especially if the survivor does not loop and waits at every pallet. I miss playing killer in yellow ranks.
---
My entire life is a lie.
---
Oh, i just got that.
---
Nah 11 actually and all those survivors were 10 or lower. Salty much?
---
Can't wait to see the new mods in action.
---
They need a WW2 battle cosmetic for bill cause I‚Äôd buy that so fast
---
Number one killer when thy know how to play as her. I can play her, but not that well at all. But yeah, it shouldn‚Äôt. Maybe it bothered me because it was su unexpected. They were polite at first, so it caught me off-guard.
---
It‚Äôs been solved! It was when I was using the legion knives glitch. They just didn‚Äôt ban me for 3 weeks but by then I had already quit playing. 
---
Don‚Äôt think it could be that because I only played a handful of matches before I‚Äôd get off.
---
That‚Äôs with tombstone along
---
It‚Äôs been solved! I used the legion knives glitch. They just didn‚Äôt ban me for 3 weeks and by then I had already quit.
---
Did my toxic ass play against you because I got that stuff from spending 1,000,000 blood points on myers
---
He literally just asked a question how does that make him pissed off
---
And then you get facecamped for the rest of the match rip
---
Well I mean I thought it was pretty comical he sent a slug
---
I like being both killer and survivor. mainly dwight/claudette
---
Killer i like being the pig and the trapper
---
I had no addons and only standard Nurse perks like BBQ, Ruin, Nurse‚Äôs Calling, and Franklin‚Äôs Demise. Nothing toxic, just an ordinary build with no addons and an ebony mori.
---
As long as it isnt an edgy meme, self advertisement, repost, obvious bait, a rude comment or harassment there aren't many reasons to remove things.
---
They refuse it because they want to earn the hatch, must be a shame thing
---
Haha, what an asshole üòÇ
---
Ah. Well, at least you know :)
---
And here I am wishing i could bring more than 1 into a game because I never bother bringing them.
---
There was a trend going around a while ago where a billy would just zoom around the map with his chainsaw.   Hit someone to cause Franklin‚Äôs.  And then leave the game.  He had a similar name too.
---
The guy you responded too clearly didn't get the joke
---
I once forgot to put on NOED. So when he came down and opened my chest he got slapped and ran away. Lucky cretin.
---
Numbers from the wiki.
---
Survivor running speed = 4.0m/s
---
Average Killer walking speed = 4.6m/s
---
4.6m/s - 4.0m/s = 0.6m/s
---
Bloodlust kicks in at 15s, 30s, and 45s, adding 0.2m/s to the Killer's speed each time.
---
A lunge is 6.9 m/s for 0.3s, which is more-or-less 2m - this means the actual distance to calculate is 30m.
---
15s x 0.6m/s = 9m (of 9m total)
---
15s x 0.8m/s = 12m (of 21m total)
---
9s x 1.0m/s = 9m (of 30m total)
---
Therefore it will take them 39s to Lunge you. However, **the entire premise is flawed.**
---
* At 32m you will be very lucky to know exactly where the killer is coming from.
---
* 39s of running in a straight line is 156m, which is smaller than every map in the game.
---
* You'll be lucky to find a killer willing to chase you for 39s.
---
Kaboom
---
They fixed random trees forming together I think, but not with map tiles. I got an Autohaven Wreckers map with one of those Z vault tiles forming with cars with a pallet to make it extremely safe once.
---
Why would i be salty? Im killer main rank 1 and i play 1000x better than you. You are terrible at the game. Id love to watch you try this strat against rank 1 swf and you get 0 kills because you cant mind game or even hit survivors at all.
---
I thought it was pretty funny
---
[Like these?](https://m.imgur.com/tVXcQbx)

Wow, this should be pinned and quoted in every content for beginner players! Thank you very much!
---
Yea solo survivor sucks I cant get past like rank 4 because I have no friends lmao.  However when you do que with a very good 3 squad it's amazing how well the game can go.
---
Rn im running hex, haunted grounds, bbq, and discordance but fairly basic for any killer. Looking for anything that might help wether it be suggestions or just a new build. Thx bois
---
What are they?
---
Looks good, great job!
---
Damn that‚Äôs a fat fucking squirrel!!
---
Fair enough buddy!
---
Really? Describe to me how you would stop a loop with wraith. Or bubba. Or ghostface. Or purge. Or any other killer that has a power which is useless in chases
---
Well, it‚Äôs always the Quentin who is a big dum dum.
---
Make your Choice, Whispers, discordance, ruin
---
You have to try harder to surpass the spookiness of Leatherspiritbilly
---
Ruin - because you dont have good map pressure without strong add-ons or if you use your power to travel you dont have it for chase.
---
BBQ - Bloodpoints and aura reading. You could swap it for something else but Spirit is strong enought and she can have perk they are not the best but just pretty good.
---
Sloppy butcher and Nurses Calling - staying injured against Spirit with Nurse is suicide and sloppy makes survivors waste time since they will most likely heal.
---
It doesn't matter
---
I thought she was going to D-strike your ass as cherry on top
---
Im right there with you. Some days I‚Äôve had to dodge 30+ lobbies. But I‚Äôd rather have the chance or green ping, than not have a chance at all. No dedicated server for my region. Could kill the game for me.
---
What happened in post chat?
---
Rank means almost nothing so chill
---
Late reply, but you know Legion is chasing after someone else to put Deep Wounds on them so.... you just mend right after he hits you. All he gets out of Frenzy attacking you is an injure, unless he commits to the chase. At that point, your timer for said Deep Wound isn't going down... making them useless.
---
Bubba with Insidious? Seems legit.
---
ToxicTyler??? Really? Lol üòÇ
---
Its true
---
Yeah I know and a streamer did
---
WA HA!
---
thank you OP!
---
No
---
I‚Äôm a meg main and I always try and save ppl
---
Isn't time to find a new game if playing it the "regular" way is boring to you so you resort to idling in the basement? I'm sure this will offend some people, but I'm just curious.
---
Which one?
---
Definitely a copycat. There's dozens of them. Dozens!
---
Awww yisss
---
My main I'm hated in the community
---
Quentin. Been playing only him since his release day.
---
_The perfect crime_
---
Mine! Kidding of course but shameless self plug lol. Gzmo12 on twitch. 
---
Also check out small time streamers bro. Find someone with 5 people then you're part of building a community. Or check out trickster hes got a good following!
---
DH isn't baitable if its used for fixing looping mistakes or to get that extra edge to a pallet or a window. That how i use it and its flawless.
---
There is the new perk that stops the timer with certain circumstances.
---
No it doesn't stun the killer when near the locker it doesn't do shit
---
Thiiiis.
---
I main Quentin, because he's always tired and that's relatable.
---
But I've noticed that Nea is a bit smaller when crouching, so when I don't want to be seen really hard I play her
---
I love Quentin he is my main as well
---
I hate going after Trapper. I still don‚Äôt DC. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
no, i dont think i will
---
üêå
---
Considering that we didn't get a summer event, will there be any upcoming blood hunts in the near future?
---
Even at rank 1 the spirits on PC are nowhere near as scary as a Billy or a nurse.
---
Doing you, gens?
---
Same boat. At least I play like a Rank 18 anyway due to being rusty lol.
---
I‚Äôve played against him before!
---
Nope. Only a failed skill check, ruin or not, will reveal your position to the killer.
---
True.
---
No, sadly
---
OP worded it to sound like there‚Äôs something wrong with dropping pallets, standing on hills, flashlight blinding and standing at gates.

PS4 here.  I made a friend who loved playing as Nea and would rage at the killer after every match. He would also get very stoned. Wasn‚Äôt a good person really, but learned his name and his city/state and such. We didn‚Äôt really stay in touch. 
---
Like almost a year later, I‚Äôm killer and there‚Äôs my Nea friend. The teabagging led me to think they knew it was me (you can kind of check on PS4).  So after the game they rage at me. And I realize they don‚Äôt remember me. So then they say they‚Äôll come to my house and kill me. And I‚Äôm like ‚Äúokay, well I‚Äôll come to your house in XXXXX, XX and give you a big hug, Trevor.‚Äù
---
I think I scared that little Nea into oblivion.
---
Yup. Played with this guy. 
---
We had a totem guard once. ‚ÄúTotem Security‚Äù.
---
Was in a field the whole time and hit/downed anyone who tried cleansing the totem.
---
A classic wraith truck is to cloak on a chase, move ahead of the survivor, and block them from a vault/pallet. You move faster than they do, you stand between them and he pallet, then unclog while they figure out what to do. 
---
Also the cloak/i cloak dash is good for those situations where hey are standing on a pallet.
---
Yes, we will get 2x bloodpoints soon. No confirmed dates yet though
---
(I know OP already answered but I wan't to leave this here:)
---
While facecamping and tunneling isn't fun for any side it definitly isn't bannable.

Mains: Myers, Freddy

Played when i get bored: Clown, Pig, Wraith

Played from time to time: Hillbilly

I did this once and the survivors were running dark sense

It‚Äôs funnier because it‚Äôs a snail

Spiky.
---
Or, as Usyllis said ‚ÄòIf you have to tap gens, do it efficiently‚Äô. Work on them for a second at a time. No skill-checks and slightly less speed loss. Better than tapping, but still not as good as gitting gud at skill checks.
---
Reported for tunneling and camping
---
You should be very, very worried
---
Do you also deal with terrible lag spikes when goin into the basement on that map? I run at a constant 60 FPS on Ultra settings, so I don‚Äôt understand how a basement drops that 60 FPS to 20 FPS.
---
Samezies, it gets better after first time down there though
---
I wasn't him. I was the guy in the screenshot here but I definitely wasn't the guy you ran into.
---
Be good to her.
---
I let people trade items in the chest only if they drop their item first. If they try to steal it back it's franklin's time.
---
Mori is executing a survivor
---
That was head on.
---
Ooh boohoo, let me press F on the world's smallest keyboard
---
I find those skillchecks easy don‚Äôt @ me
---
yea the perk rarity system is just all over the place for really no reason. I think they should honestly go in and make all perks Rare (Green Rarity) simply to reduce the grind that much more, spending 5000 BP on every perk rather than between 4000 - 6000 would make gaining perks consistent and even out the grind.
---
"Would never hit us"
---
Literally hits someone 8 seconds into the clip

Lol. That was the only time. That guy was being an ass. My b

Dwight and Feng
---
and clicking, dont forget the clicking
---
Legion is actually one of the easier to adept with because of his insanely fast first-hit capability. Doing all the adepts for Platinum this weekend, I found the hardest part is getting survivors that don't attempt-escape and suicide on the hook tbh
---
Lol. Puts his name on a picture where he just placed a Claudette face.
---
Nice figure how long do you mak-
---
HOLY SHIT IS THIS CORVO MASK?! WHERE I CAN BUY ONE?!
---
The first perk is yellow, green, green, the second is yellow green purple, and the 3rd is green purple purple.
---
Really looking forward to the positive effect this will have on the sub. Welcome, mods!
---
Stay in school kids.
---
This works so well that it shocks me people still think Wraith sucks. Find someone, hit them, move on unless they have no good juke areas nearby. Either they self-care for six years and don't progress gens, or they don't and next time you find them it's an easy down.
---
Still better than my ex
---
The problem with that is what happens when you take it to its logical conclusion - they'll just split up once they realise grouping up gets your attention (again, not a problem for Legion or Plague - they'll already be snowballing from that first group).
---
OP has no other tracking perk, so when survivors split up they're going to be effectively invisible outside of the established trap area. 
---
OP's Trapper also has no instadowns or any other method of slowing the survivors themselves. Corrupt Intervention goes down in 2 minutes, Ruin could go down in less, and Pop needs hooks. Their capacity to pressure gens is only going to weaken over time.
---
The most likely outcome is that OP gets their 2 minutes, which they chain into a 3-gen, and then it's just a matter of time for survivors to tap gens and escape by attrition. As soon as the gates are powered, OP's pressure vanishes - they might get lucky with a trap at the gate controls, but that'll just be a consolation prize.

The pig guy is probably still rank 16

Awhile back someone mentioned that this DLC would be $11.99
---
I can't for the life of me find the post but I remember they linked a reliable looking source
---
Just scroll past it you fucking cretin, you‚Äôve spent about 2000% more time than you would have if you just ignored it.
---
Plague is the only one I haven't gotten yet. It's really hard to get the double pip playing her with only her 3 unique perks, so I've just put it off for later in the hopes that they'll change the criteria. Survivor adepts on the other hand are super easy to get, so why can't the killer catch a break?
---
This happened to me the other day on this map I trapped a pallet and tped to it as they put it down so I ended up in the pallet instead is this a glitch?
---
how far in advance do they typically announce when the patch will hit.  Is it like a week warning? 2 weeks?  or do they just release it without warning.  I want to farm some bp for the new blood webs, but also need to spend some as well.  But would like to have time to save up.
---
Unbreakable tho
---
Yea I saw it in his videos
---
Entity knows why I got downvotes for actually telling folk how the spirit's terror radius and whooshing mechanic actually plays with Monitor &amp; Abuse. 
---
Was this not a technically oriented thread where people were discussing mechanics?
---
The reason nobody is mentionning it is that the topics where the streamer was named got locked.
---
But he is a top DBD streamer. Hint: 4 letter name. He's sexy.
---
Illness.
---
TIL
---
I've only ever noticed the auto-aim when swinging at a survivor that is being carried away on after death on hook, as it jerks the camera into the sky. I don't think it's THAT bad, but it does add to the problem with her design.
---
Most of the changes look fine, but the facecamping thing was already implemented earlier and removed because survivors abused it. We're gonna live forever doesn't need a buff and it really doesn't need a change, but the other changes im fine with
---
Or just live up north and you can buy it every day lol
---
Thx you all
---
In order to understand the toxic d00ds that plague the game, one must have a toxic d00d working with them
---
Nope, don't worry. Only failed skillchecks (=exploding gen).
---
Things that alert killer:
---
Exploding gens
---
Fastvaulting Window/Pallet
---
AFK/Not moving for over a minute
---
CLOSING CHESTS (you can release the chest when the killer comes, but if you do it to fast/with sprinting/idk, it's gonna alert the killer)
---
Fast entering/leaving lockers
---
Thrill of the Hunt - when doing a *Hex Totem* and you see "Thrill of the hunt" pop up. That's a Hex Perk that helps Killer to defend their Hex stuff, like Ruin etc. - Dull totems are okay thiugh
---
I think that's most stuff.
---
Also, in case you don't know:
---
If the Killer is picking a Survivor up ... Find a Locker. Most Killer run BBQ (Barbeque &amp; Chili). That perk doubles Killer Bloodpoints, promotes a non-tunneling gameplay AND it shows all survivor on the map (outside of 32m from the hook)
---
You can counter BBQ by one of these 5 Methods:
---
1) locker. No Aura readin possible against people in lockers. 
---
2) be inside 32m when hooking
---
3) be over 70m away, so you're waaay to far for the killer to care/be there in time
---
4) use a Gen as cover. Gens have red auras, just like you. He MIGHT not see you. Maybe. 
---
5) No cover, gens? Okay then... Run Left. After 4 sec, when BBQ is over, run right. The killer might goes to the place you were running to before, which results in the killer wasting his time / searching at the wrong place
---
Hope i could help you :)
---
Maybe its the controller
---
Just bring small game
---
Unbreakable squad rise up

that shit on pc wouldn't work

U right unless it‚Äôs a baby killer

I love doing this with Bubba and scaring them by hiding in the opposite side of the room with the chest so I'm behind them and they have no clue
---
U right unless it‚Äôs a baby killer like that

Oh, I know that. I just wondered if someone took it personally and reported it

This was a good read. I can feel the raw emotion. You can probably dump it into one of those mainstream yougotwhat'scoming subs.

\-Huntress main, 2019
---
I mean, you absolutely can, the validity of the complaints can be challenged, but you can't say that you aren't allowed to comment on unbalanced elements just because it used to be even worse.
---
My issue with it is it deactivates so easily if you are any even a slightly extended chase
---
This doesn't let you fully recover, just up to that 99%, and then you need a teammate.
---
r/karmaroulette
---
back when i used to main Claudette i was in a chase and i went around a corner chrouched and the killer walk past me
---
Tenacity: Crawl while recovering, Crawl faster
---
Unbreakable: Self pickup once, Recover faster
---
Each perk Considerably decreases your chance of being slugged /s
---
Lol yea it‚Äôs literally just meüòÇ I‚Äôm not complaining. Survivors teabag all they want, idc. I kill you either way. If I don‚Äôt than oh well, gg right?

I hate the rng with Lerys. You never know whats gonna be in the next room.
---
Unless, as you said, you're using Rancor. Get all your stacks and then ignore them until the last generator is done, right?
---
Your name isn't Basement Security in your screenshot though. So it wasn't you.
---
Before dropping a pallet you can probably take note of where the next pallet is. Then 20 seconds is plenty of time for it to reactivate.
---
You can‚Äôt pick yourself up with it, you can only recover up to 99
---
I still main nea because im a noob3 wanna be. Its just that it took a while for the devs to get facial modeling down.
---
I think I‚Äôm probably gonna get ghostface but I‚Äôm not entirely sure quite yet so I‚Äôm gonna wait for bit to completely think it over. Thanks!
---
Thanks, glad u like it
---
Thanks so much! I really apreciate the words
---
Bruuuuuuuh, we got ourselves a mega gamer out here creating fuckin' weapons.
---
How could you abuse this? :O I mean, it's still going down, but just slower. It's not a difference if I'm facecamping someone for 4 minutes instead of 2 minutes right? Except facecampers get their well-deserved defeat. If the health bar wouldnt go down at all, this would probably be abusable.
---
Hard understanding sarcasm through text, also head on has been working alot actually now
---
Last night I played my first game as new Freddy and I left a hooked Jake who of course was unhooked moments later expecting to find his savior first but this idiot ran right into me so I downed him and I was going to hook him but then I felt bad and dropped him
---
Definitely underrated, for the reasons you mention. And identifying window spawn setups mid-chase is also very valuable. People are usually not confident in making non-meta calls, forgoing any of the standard perks for WOO.
---
For some reason claudette always has her hands really spread out and you can't hide behind trees and stuff. She's almost T-posing.
---
Adrenaline instead of sprintburst
---
He said it, no one was going to take that chest.
---
Na, just empty threats.
---
But don't be surprised if a porn company sends you an e-mail on information regarding if the stick could be made to vibrate instead of laugh.
---
 At the moment?
---
If it  counterd freddys and docs pallets I'd probably run it.
---
Gotta love sprint burst

I think Nightmare on Elm street was good (except for number 5) and the Scream trilogy(the 4th one felt like the older ones) and The Texas chainsaw massacre maybe a bit of Halloween.
---
Oh god, that would be amazing. Everyone gets random load outs and characters
---
I did the math. With 19 survivors, there's 342 different combinations you could do of having 2 survivors in this meme.
---
If you throw a 3rd survivor into where charlie sheen is, there's 5814 different combinations.
---
This is going to be a long year.
---
Bad wording on my part: I meant that ive seen some people say "The game is the worst its ever been!" and point to those two perks when in reality the game has never been in a better state
---
So far I haven‚Äôt gotten the chance to play GF on Lery‚Äôs. I think he‚Äôll be real fun there.
---
*Prayer beads spirit

Also he didn‚Äôt hit any of us. Just shook his head. I got ballsy one time and opened the chest but chickened our when he came towards me again XD

If you have anything I should add/remove/rework just comment your suggestions :D Im especially excited for changes for other perks :)
---
And...?
---
You know what he meant.
---
What's the back story? Like okay and what?
---
Tried to refund a skin I didn't want from a purchase bug and I got denied the requested. Isn't that a problem with bhvr.
---
I corrected myself less than a minute after i made the comment.
---
&gt; Lery‚Äôs was probably a poor example
---
I mean it's your fault if you bought a skin and didn't like it plus in their terms of services I believe it states no refunds if I'm correct it's your fault my guy. What did you even buy any way?
---
Thank you :D
---
Honestly the best advice I could give you is try to learn to not hate playing killer. You can learn so much about playing survivor well by playing killer and watching what survivors do against you successfully, and vice versa.
---
Thats one of my big issues when people complain about getting unhooked and then immediately downed by killer. Like, you had enough time to get away before he showed up, you just suck at evading and tried crouch walking away from the hook..
---
Yassss!
---
She is fricking adorable
---
I'm actually surprised there isn't a killer perk centered around chests yet, it probably won't be meta but would be neat to counter looting builds and have some kind of unique use in games.
---
Memeing can be fun in itself, you don't always have to play everything (or even every match) to win. Winning also doesn't automatically equals fun.
---
I wish they added this outfit to feng honestly the cutest and most fashionable ouutfit ever
---
I've switched to square and still the same thing happening
---
He's trolling, and the devs for this game suck horribly, so im sorry you had to go through that bs.
---
This is my Chest! There are many like it but this one is mine!
---
Is a fair perk that you can disable by destroying 5 totems around the map or the hex at the end of the match, and multiple different perks which encourages and helps in the destruction of said totems.
---
Same except I plan on pretigeing all killers and survivors
---
This is also true.
---
Take my upvote. :)
---
Hopefully can find someone to help, I need it
---
yes
---
Sad, sad little child.
---
Ok well I made a ass of myself I feel bad for you sucks Bhvr didn't refund you ya cells
---
I also protect my chest from those survivors who try to steal frome me.

To be fair, the 200,000 isn't wasted. It's an investment. You'll still have those levels for if you get that daily again.

You're doing it too fast, I played on xbox before and would die because I absolutely mashed the button, try pressing it a bit slower

You're back too huh? The projection in you calling people child is pretty fucking pathetic honestly. It's a game, move on. You're worse than a 9 year old when it comes to getting THIS salty over how someone else plays a GAME.

Tenacity, flip flop, boil over, unbreakable. It basically works 100% of the time as long as you‚Äôre in a lobby where everyone else is really good.
---
Remember me , agitation,  tenacity and dance with me.
---
Sure. But teabagging in the exit game,although extremely frustrating and mostly toxic, takes like, 5 seconds to watch and suffer until you hit the survivors. Making a survivor almost bleed out after giving him false hope of escape...there is no compare between the two. 
---
I also hate teabagging those few times I play killer and I can never defend teabagging or any toxic behaviour from survivors' side. But fighting toxicity with a higher level of toxicity...damn...that's what's evil,wrong and destroys this or any game

Thx

You deleted your post huh? Figures because it was a pretty bad one. Well I already wrote a response out so here you go.
---
You sound like a pseudo intellectual over a game right now. If you can't see how that makes YOU the childish one in this situation, getting mad how people play a game, then you're dumber than I thought. I stated how I liked to play a game, so you and a plethora of other man children started insulting me over it. I insulting no one until insults were thrown at me, it's a fucking game, get over it man-baby.
---
Is it confirmed this won't be getting released?
---
I mean, in a game where second by second timing is what balance is built on, yet there are offerings that reduce 4 hooks from the survivor's lifespan, there are probably more pressing things that need to be changed
---
I'm a solo queuer normally, so I tend to run Self Care, Sprint Burst/Balanced Landing, Bond and We'll Make It.
---
If I'm with my mates I tend to switch Bond for Aftercare. Sometimes if we've faced a few Ruins/NOEDs I'll put Small Game on or Decisive Strike/Borrowed Time if we've had some campers.

I want the game grumps to play DBD so fucking bad

The recent survivor perks haven‚Äôt been all that great
---
Their customer service is quiet bad. I one time cought a lagswitcher, who even admitted that he lagswitched in playstation messages. I sent the video of the lagswitch + him admitting it to me to the devs. This is what the devs said in their email back to me: 'As much as we would like to help, I am afraid that we are unable to as we only handle support towards in-game concerns.' While their was clear prove
---
I only prestige if I have blood points so I have a perks and items
---
This isnt really something that should be on the sub. I do appreciate paying respects though.
---
Devs said they want to, but need to figure out how to make the hoodie work since survivor head / shirt are technically 2 slots
---
Not a jump scare really.
---
I FEEL YOU
---
Thanks man. I know it doesn‚Äôt really belong but I hope the bots make an exception
---
It is almost negligible speed though. It was probably the super slow vault since it was slower to go around
---
Shit my internet went out.
---
Jason caught in the cease-fire not even part of this shit
---
Oof. Had something similar happen with the hag. Made it to the hatch but didn't see the rune in the bushes. Worst day of mah life.
---
Hey I had a Nea do the exact same thing, and I also just watched her bleed out. Also got called trash lmao
---
And nothing of value was lost. Real friends don't let Moris stand between them. üòè
---
I've had this happen a lot when playing Billy, he camps in the basement running  [**Insidious**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Insidious)**. Scares the shit outta you lol**
---
I p3 all killers because its fun to level up their blood webs, I don't bother to prestige survivors because what's the point of items on them, get the perks and play.
---
But I do the same when I prestige killer, use all the good addons I want to use and then prestige them, sometimes if I've got good perks I'll ride it to 1 million bp.
---
you dont actually lose those pips, its just visual
---
Yeah it just sucks you know?
---
Make one for me?!
---
RED RAIN IS POURING DOWN ALL OVER ME

I'm trying to learn to play without any exhaust perk, what's your build?

I did vault it several times after the clip stops she just hit every time I went over it

Jake. He just wants to be left alone, poor guy.
---
I get moris are bs and are in need of a rework as well as keys but I expected a haha fuck you but even still I‚Äôve got moried and tunneled by him before and I never reacted like that
---
Overreacts over absolutely nothing? Check.
---
Still acts like an asshole because people want to spend their money how they wish? Check.
---
Acts like he's somehow in the right for acting like a cunt for no reason? Check.
---
Dell Conagher. Go with knowledge.
---
Niiiiiice
---
I had thr same thing once, my friend went back and managed to get one of the items, the end game chat was really goofy with the killer saying that my friend took his stuff, it was great
---
Ye i do play other games usually. Alot of R6 and dbd is a chilled out game and i like it.
---
Oh sad...
---
Lol i dont fall for that, my luck if living in 2000s youtube
---
My internet gave out during a killer match and I get reported for it lmao. Like why would I quit mid chase and if I'm running I dunno how I would quit without stopping
---
I was wondering about how often people played along, had a ghostface do this once, we all went down and tried to get the stuff in his chest, we go really close. It was hilarious
---
Skin
---
Every Feral Frenzy attack counts as an offensive action, and thus uses a token, but activating it shouldn't. Sounds like a bug?
---
Too bad I'm not in the USA, plus that nationalism saying whoever lives in the USA is dumb af is a really bigot position. Welp, only dumb people would think nationalism or some sort of superiority they feel to live in some places instead of somewhere else is something to be proud of. 
---
Flash news, dumb people lives anywhere and you are the proof of that just by spreading nationalism and saying a group of people is dumb just by the nation they live in is so fked up and dumb I can't even conceive you actually made such a point
---
Yea that's kinda what i said. Moris are BS but obviously isn't worth ruining a friendship over lol
---
Sometimes the game has a mini lag spike randomly which is really annoying, they should add like a bar which fills up so you don't have to repeatedly mash space-bar or X etc.
---
&gt;like survivors can increase the distance between hooks
---
Well the "counter" to this is killers have an offering to decrease the distance between hooks, fyi, it's not one-sided
---
I really loved it til the end.
---
I can't count the number of times I've looked directly at the fucker and he exposes me before I even hear the sound for beginning to break him out of stalk. I personally have more of a problem with the pocket expose, but I still can't stand the dog shit design that ghost face's stalking is.
---
There isn't counter play to a really good nurse especially if she is using extra blinks. You simply haven't faced a good ones.
---
There is an insane amount of counter plays to GF.
---
If it‚Äôs that much of a problem you have enduring so just keep tanking it and breaking them  and Lerys pallets can also be super unsafe sometimes to loop.
---
Hope, Dead Hard, Iron Will, DS.
---
Fun, toolbox survivor build.
---
DH is a extremely versatile, and paired with Iron Will makes being injured much less an inconvience. Both are great against spirits and nurses. 
---
Hope because it lets us win the last chase, and its fun as hell zipping around the map. + it soft counters NOED and 110ms killers. I know most dont like this perk and immediately disregard it for Adrenaline, but Hope is probably my favorite perk. 
---
DS is flex. Getting tunneled or farmed sucks, and its great to have an insurance policy to escape the basement or End game facecamp.
---
Same honestly. I rathe killer dailys
---
I cant force them man, this is lery‚Äôs where every pallet requires you to walk 8 miles around something and by then they‚Äôd have walked through some doorway or window thats conveniently placed for them
---
Exactly lol, people pretending that guessing what the killer is doing is somehow unique to Spirit is big lmao.

You can argue that there's other factors that make Spirit annoying to play against, but making out that the act of having to guess what the killer is doing is criminal game design and the source of all frustration is silly.
---
Look who's shittin in the tall grass
---
Idk wtf was going on with the PTB the other day but THREE TIMES IN A ROW my friend and I queued for a game, loaded in, and then the game ended for us 3 seconds later......
---
Noob3 is one sexy bastard. 
---
jk i know how you‚Äôre talking about. Thanks!
---
i really hate the plag.
---
it seems too op.
---
oh look you got puked on and so did the other 3 players, well get broken for the match.
---
oh look did someone cleanse? welp goodbye bitch.
---
Yep
---
I never said the counter play is guaranteed to work, I'm just saying there is some. There's no counter play to a 99% insta down that he can use at any time, so he'll just wait until you're in a dead zone and pop it. He should lose exposure progression if broken out of stalk.
---
It looks like you reached straight into the game and pulled this out!! Absolutely incredible work, friend!!
---
TRYING FOR RANK 1 THIS SEASON WAS A BITCH! 
---
DISCONNECT DISCONNECT DISCONNECT SUICIDE RAGEQUIT RAGEQUIT SUICIDE DISCONNECT JESUS FUCKING CHRIST.
---
I mean, that very well could be an offering, just keep in mind there are four survivors and one killer, you'd probably run into the "increase distance between pallets" offering more than you can churn out the "decrees distance between pallets" offering
---
Not sure if that makes sense
---
well its either the design he currently have or him not having a power
---
Devour
---
They arent looping them man, they‚Äôre throwing them and running, so i either spend the time breaking each pallet be throws down every second or i spend time going around the pallet only to have them throw another one down. If someone runs me around a pallet and loops well, good on them, but if they can seriously stall me for 3 gens by being a brainlet, thats just dumb
---
The counter play is don't reach 99% in the first place, and worst case if you do reach 100%, its not that hard to loop a m1 killer.
---
I guess they could make it a bunny hat instead of being attached to the hoodie. Louise Belcher Feng when?
---
because it promoted tunneling the obsession AND it was getting disabled when the killer gets DSed by someone after activating it
---
the new one sucks too much tho

IDK WHAT THE FUCK WAS GOING ON WITH THE PTB YESTERDAY BUT A FRIEND AND MYSELF SPENT 30 GOD DAMN MINUTES TRYING TO GET INTO A GAME. THREE TIMES IN A ROW WE LOADED IN AND THEN THE GAME ENDED INSTANTLY. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON GOD DAMMIT??!???!?
---
From dying to full heal state?
---
there are a bunch of pallets on lerys where the loop is 8 cm. you also have double engravings which means if you know how to do the billy curves every pallet is an unsafe pallet
---
Nope, I honestly think if he lost exposure progress when you break his stalk, it would fix him enough to be bearable. Pocket insta downs should only be a Myers thing, since it has a time limit. But GF can just hold onto it for all 4 survivors, using it in any situation he wants.
---
If only people were this fun on console.
---
Why are you still here if you unsubbed. Not saying you shouldn't be, but if its making you so upset, itd probably be better to avoid the sub so it doesn't ruin your day
---
What‚Äôs WGLF?
---
basically
---
Never forget
---
Same problem with hook offerings man. Survs can put out more than you can put in
---
Randoms or SWF?  I'm a Jane main but I never really used this perk much.  With Innee Strength on the way I think I might.
---
People need to learn to be more like you.
---
Make stick louder
---
You didn't even read what I just said. He can just wait to pop it in a dead zone, and you're fucked. I'm talking about general game play where teammates toss half the map's pallets and you're left in a dead zone. 
---
Also it's hard to not reach 99% when most cases you either have to trade a hit for breaking his stalk or you can't break his stalk cause the mechanic is scuffed and he gets a free instadown since he had addons that made it so you have to be closer to break his stalk, forcing you to be near him instead of near a safe pallet or loop.
---
Because he didnt want to give ground...he really wanted that kill
---
I‚Äôm confused. Did the YouTuber actually die? Or did he just die in the game ?
---
if you want to make it easier for you to play against him look up int3r4ct he makes a guide like video on every killer and in the video he took some long time to explain how his reveal work. im not gonna say if the design he currently has is what it should be but thats the design they went with.
---
Happy to inform you guys :)
---
&gt; most people
---
Upvotes say otherwise
---
I've seen this, I need to try this
---
Collection plus they make a nice gold shine
---
He has a turret and teleporter and a machine that dispenses health. 
---
But with no dead hard he falls flat into the C tier.
---
Hush, it's fixed
---
Im not the best billy, but they arent looping, so i cant do shit like that. I either wait for the long charge time or i go around it and spend more time chasing him to another pallet that he‚Äôll throw down, giving me no time to do any of those tricks
---
Hey I saw this guy before, I went to the basement to see if the killer was hiding from us.
---
2nd is mine lol
---
If you play without using ruin, he/she has my respect
---
Sadly one of the things you mentioned are pretty much mandatory.
---
Where to start... Oh right. *Inhales* STOP PUTTING ME AS A NEW KILLER AGAINST HIGHER RANKED TOXIC SURVIVORS WHO COMPLETELY RUIN THE EXPERIENCE FOR ME
---
The fuck did he get 8k BP for?
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well
---
That Feng in the thumbnail is so cute! Your voice is pretty soothing as well &gt;w&lt;
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not a fan of the whole stocking stalk to 99% but ah well it‚Äôs no worse then Billy who doesn‚Äôt even need to stalk you.
---
Sorry about that, but we want to keep player names censored.
---
Dying light gonna be so strong now in combination with save the best for last and rancor. You can just ignore your obsession the whole game and stack your perks to the limit. Prob with another perk then play with your food to make a full build because i dont actually think it will help you out with the other obsession perks. You dont wanna waste time on your obsession
---
It came with the collectors edition of dishonored 2, along with a replica ring that Emily wears, beautiful ring but it‚Äôs huge and more for woman.

it is, isn't it? the artist was kind enough to let me use it :D and aww thank you very much! i've had a cold recently so I sound a little stuffy imo haha

Had to been me. Every time you guys dropped an item I'd move from the chest, and as soon as you'd pick the item back up I'd move back.
---
This reminds me of what is legitimately the *best* scene in [Halloween: Resurrection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Z1mnjLwiA).
---
And only 1 gen was done during that time
---
I don't know about generally, but I play a wraith build where I only decloak to scare people off gens.  If you run, I leave you alone.  No hits, only grabbing off the gen if you're too ballsy.  I don't do it to de-rank.  I do it because it's amusing to me.
---
You get a downvote from me!
---
&gt; It‚Äôs an okay perk, good players generally already know where pallets spawn so it not helpful to them.
---
As i explained in my post, a good ammount of pallets have pre defined spawn, but a lot of it is random too.
---
&gt; The perk only helps find the initial pallet and not the follow up which definitely hurts it
---
You can usually spot a second pallet once you are looping the killer a the first pallet, just gotta remember it :P
---
Thank you!

I had similiar thing ! We couldnt find the killer whole match so we left and asked where was he, he didnt respond BUT his name was RUIN SECURITY !and we couldnt find ruin totem xD
---
she gets her hair dyed on the regular.

Billy requires mind game, GF requires DC. Two games played with the same pieces

It is against the sub rules for over saturated content even if you're not mad about it being the exact same meme.
---
Most places have allowed Sunday sales now. I was in a dry county for along time because of the local bible thumping college in town, but things have changed and allot of those old fuddy duddys have died off. So influx of a new tax revenue for the city and county, since we could go one county over before all that lol!
---
We're Gonna Live Forever. Surv equivalent of BBQ but harder to get as it requires safe unhooks or protection hits.
---
After I was told my mother should die from cancer and that the survivors wanted to rape her corpse afterwards, I just back out of any lobby that has any legacy in it. Not gonna deal with it, not gonna give them the chance to be assholes.
---
I'm sure if I look up an in depth guide on it, I'll just get more pissed off. I know it's never going to be changed but I'm still going to rant about it since it's the one killer I hate. Every other killer I can play against, even if they're a 9k hour pumpkin head nurse. But ghost face just seems like such a gimmicky killer who just fucks you no matter what you do. 
---
Though my argument only holds up if the ghost face is actively stalking during chase. If the ghost face plays more like pig than myers, he's basically a m1 killer than can be looped forever. But if they're playing like a myers, I honestly think a pocket expose ghost face is more OP in terms of usability than tier 3 Myers at times. He puts more pressure as you don't ever know what exposure level you're at. While with Myers you can guess if he has tier 3 based off prior knowledge.
---
The plus men.
---
I keep getting up 300k but my brain keeps telling me "hey you could level up wraith and prestige him or hey you could level ash for another WGLF tier" I really can't save my bloodpoints but I gotta as I want to p3 the demogorgon in 1 or 2 weeks
---
Ranks don't indicate skills, that's for sure.
---
Dbd Mobile https://imgur.com/gallery/3fB7iPq link of an image. Shows like this red line (idk how else to describe it) but when you see it that means the killer used their power/ability in that direction. For instance the killer I had in the picture ended up being a wraith so we knew when he cloacked/uncloacked despite not being able to hear it.
---
Dark devotion, some amazing plays can be made with that, so much fun to use, especially on the plague! 
---
Autodidact, combo it with botany knowledge if you want (to try make up for the early game weakness), but quick heals can become fun, and getting it to max is so satisfying.
---
Lol that guy is a legend
---
Actually A boy that removes alot of comments and posts might be getting a can for being too trigger happy with removals
---
Angel-o
---
I think the more you rank up the less brain cells the survivors have. I see rank 20s do better then red ranks
---
This is like saying LF is OP because if he catch you in a dead zone with no pallets or window he will insta down you... well sure...
---
Then perhaps he's testing the 2nd main thing that is to be tested during a PTB, which is the build as a whole.  
---
This PTB included another test run for the dedicated servers, which is a pretty major thing that should be tested, and it gets tested regardless of how you choose to play. All in all, that's still a win for the future of the game.  
---
If you think you can read someone's mind and see their intent just from looking at their perks, add-ons, items or offerings, just stop. Because you can't. All you're proving right now with this discussion is that you're a frail snowflake. Not everyone who wants to use the strongest stuff is toxic. Not everyone who wants to use the strongest stuff during the PTB is toxic.  
---
If you can't handle PTB opportunism, then stop partaking in the PTB.  
---
P.S. You should really look into paragraphing. It makes your nonsense far easier to read. I can't promise it'll be more comprehensive, but I can guarantee it'll be easier to read.

I love playing with friends, you can come up with all this preplanned shit

At least 3/4 of the time for me.

I FUCKING HATE EVERY GAME I TRY TO PLAY THERES ALWAYS A DISCONNECT OR FRANKLINS OR A FUCKING MORI I JUST WANT TO USE MY PURPLE FLASHLIGHT AND NOT GET FUCKED
---
Oh? Is that a threat
---
Fuck dying light. Just fuck dying light.
---
Ay that's pretty good. You gonna take a try at the other Ghostface set also?
---
Not the same given that you can hear LF's heartbeat and you can actually plan ahead of time. Ghost face can pop his stalk, move at normal speed with no heartbeat, then when you either sit on a loop or move away, he can just pop it and you're fucked. He has way too much utility to be compared to leatherface in terms of unfair gameplay.
---
But I want my bp!
---
I'm insulting you because you're intentionally playing to grief other players which is both sad and pathetic.  There is zero merit to how you play the game.  You do it purely to ruin the experience of others.  There's no way you get to frame this as you being the persecuted good guy lol.
---
Brutal strength, not as good as enduring but you FEEL more powerful after using it
---
they gonna charge real money for the licensed cosmetic tho
---
I feel Ralph could be a killer or the sisters
---
i do hate GF, but he has more counters/is more fun to play against then spirit.
---
Tbh I was not prepared for that
---
Hard yes
---
 https://www.mediafire.com/file/7h4wv4m02z166vf/Dbd\_Bundel\_3.2.0.rar/file
---
What counters?
---
the answer is yes since you can ask any of those hundreds of streamers
---
&gt; May be in the future
---
Needs more jpeg.
---
Well this was an interesting post to stumble upon while queuing as Ghost Face
---
NOED can buy you kills but not game knowledge.  Poor lil NOED gamer didn't know how to play that loop.  Bless his crutched out little heart.
---
This man has never played on shelter woods, how about we have a killer addon to add more dead zones! that sure would be fun game design right?
---
You probably are low rank, those 3 killers are high skill dependant so in low ranks you will of course preffer to face them, but the good players are a nightmare.
---
Ghostface is kinda weak.
---
Its my dream match. All I want to do is steal iyems from chests without spending bloodpoints on perks. Finally a worthy opponent.
---
True that!
---
I mean this isn‚Äôt really anything special
---
WHY THE FUCK IS MY SAVE GAME STILL NOT WORKING?
---
ERROR 100 MY ASS.
---
* For non-text posts (images, videos, ...), referring to the game in the title is not sufficient. The main focus of the post itself must be on Dead by Daylight. The rule of thumb is: if you can post the exact same image/video to another, completely unrelated subreddit without changing a single thing in the image/video, it is considered offtopic.
---
Been awhile since I've seen this shit reposted.

yeah, I get that. I‚Äôm a chanka main in R6 Siege and I‚Äôll see ‚ÄúTHE LORD‚Äù in chat so often, it‚Äôs annoying as hell

Practice them mindgames üòÇ

Funny thing is he subbed to my yt following this game. I‚Äôm gonna upload the end of this match as well
---
Shouldn't the pics be opposite then
---
Me when I hear my mom making tendies.(good render btw)
---
They don‚Äôt do anything. Avoid buying them where you can, and if you can‚Äôt, then save them for if there‚Äôs ever a rework of his add ons.
---
I mean yes, exactly, so why would you want to implement a new feature that has the exact same problem?
---
It really do Trapper like that sometimes. Things like this are why Trapper is low tier.
---
Exactly I heard the devs talk about that in one of the dev commentary‚Äôs
---
The Irish was strong on this one
---
If you're going to repost at least remove the black bars.
---
I played on a map recently that literally had no structures other than the kill shack, is that shelter woods?
---
Somebody fill him in
---
Hey if u wanna get pig make sure that u r running the perks Whispers and Monitor so that you can get easy first hits and sometimes gen grabs. Other great perks for her are BS, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Ruin and STBFL. You can do some memes with her such as Amandas letter and putting the trap on someones head and proceeding to crouch in front of one of the 2 jigsaw boxes until the head pops lol. Other than that meme, you wanna also make sure that you have combat straps at all times because for crouch/ dash attack it is really really good!
---
It doesn't even feel like it was enough with only 6 or 7 survs and killers, and now we have twice that many and hundreds of levels to get perks on every character. Not to mention it doesn't even feel like that much BP, if you have a good binge you can go from 0 to 1,000,000 in a day or two. Not to mention that BP doesn't make them any money. Why have a limit at all?
---
bing bing?
---
Remove your veins for insertion of the cables.
---
Survivors have been nerfed enough, Buff m1 killers. thats what you are trying to say? bc i agree then.
---
Never said I preferred to face them so maybe instead of trying to insult me, read what I'm saying. I said I would rather face a Billy, spirit, or nurse because they take some form of mind gaming while with ghost face he can easily be looped, but if he catches you off guard randomly you get fucking downed no matter what you do because he pocketed an instadown from 20 mins ago.
---
Fuck that guy, you don't need a little bitch like that. The amount of times I've killed my mate or he killed me doesn't bother us. It's a game, we're having a laugh. If he unblocks you tell em to go fuck. Explode over a game hahaha unless your all like 12 or something.
---
gr8 b8 m8 i r8 88/8 it's f8 that you h8 your karma m8 so i a8nt gonna downvote you with my 8 alt accounts

Camping and tunneling are NOT bannable, they are asking NOT reportable offenses. No worries.

**Next up**: Not sure yet, I have a pretty strong idea for Michael Myers though
---
And there's more of my work on IG at: [@gopencyprep](https://www.instagram.com/gopencyprep/)
---
Not No Mither / Self Care / Mettle of Man / Solidarity out of 10.
---
3 minutes? Really? That hatch spawn is the most obvious in the entire game
---
There was no joke there, if you were being sarcastic drop a /s
---
I can't understand tone of voice through pixels.
---
Put the two women screaming at the cat meme, then replace the confused cat with this trapper.
---
Then you break your TV.
---
Unbreakable is one use only, No Mither is better
---
We circled the whole map twice, and then just came to his idea to just go in the school, plus i never expected my last mate to dc
---
Youre right, will use that next time
---
Let me point out that as far as the game's code was concerned, there WAS originally a Blood Hunt planned in that time frame. The devs program events into the game's code beforehand, with dates and everything. It was not the Wiki's fault that they then decided to postpone the Blood Hunt (confirmed by Community Managers) since the Stranger Things PTB went live.
---
Ah, no problem.
---
Seems like all of your kind disagree with me even though most streamers and youtubers with thousands upon thousands of hours think he's gimmicky and annoying. But obviously I'm the one who's wrong.
---
Bet you if their favorite stream said some shit they'd be like "OH YES THAT'S SO TRUEEEEEE"
---
It was on Ormond, I was playing Jane, I set down my medkit so doctor let me loot but then I gave my medkit to Nea and I kept picking up the toolbox I looted so he could hit it out of my hands.. sound familiar at all?
---
Dying Light was an extremely unhealthy perk for the game. It promoted hard tunnelling and essentially gave the Killer a free win when it went off. I did a [survey of the least liked perks in Dead by Daylight](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c72j0e/survey_results_the_worst_perks_in_dead_by_daylight/) awhile ago and Dying Light was in the top 5 for worst perks overall.
---
Hate to say it but if you like Dying Light you're factually wrong. I'm not even being hyperbolic here: you're actually objectively wrong. It's one of the least healthy perks for the game, and it's exactly *because* it's unhealthy that it's being reworked.
---
It‚Äôs hidden tho
---
People don‚Äôt know he can still down in his tantrum smh my head
---
There actually was a sound, but yeah kinda quiet
---
I always try to do the skill checks first. If I have a bad day and I fail them twice I start looking for the totem instead of resetting my team mates progress again and again. I am currently 16-15 though  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Yo, Angelo!
---
Yes. one of the worst survivor maps for anyone other then useless blendettes, Killer shack is the only building/100% safe loop, and Basement is always there. And to make it worse there is ALWAYS a massive dead zone right outside shack.
---
*Gets chasesed as a survivor that you haven't levelled up daily*
---
Amazing work.
---
yeah wtf i found that guy yesterday and he facecamped with bubba
---
Breakdown is honestly an underrated perk. It's not great yes but sometimes you can get away with things like this.
---
Killers when they know gens are protected by ruin under rank 10
---
Territorial imperative is op af.
---
Atleast you try generators also it's better to do generators alone when the killer had a ruin as it's less chance of skill checks,less worrying if the other will miss and multiple generators can get done.
---
This appears to be a hoes mad situation if you ask me
---
*insert Nea is the entity joke here* but I think it should be Dwight because people make fun of him for being a coward
---
r/cringetopia
---
Ay. Anywhere in haddonfield is perfect for hiding

---
üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
---
Claudette would be the best stealth killer that‚Äôs for sure.
---
Yes, indeed she would.
---
You're like the Bruce Wayne of the fog...
---
Remember, kiddos, Its not being toxic, It's Role-playing
---
Didn‚Äôt you hear? Playing survive with friends is toxic because survivors shouldn‚Äôt be able to work together
---
Or all three other survivors are raptor circling the hooked survivor waiting for killer to leave to rescue them, but they don‚Äôt realize I CAN SEE THEM ALL WAITING FOR ME TO LEAVE!
---
I‚Äôm one away from a full prestige ghostface. Demo will probably become priority though
---
Thing is you can't do a map offering / pallet offering together :/ you won't know which map you got
---
This needs to happen
---
Happened to me yesterday. His reasoning was "didnt want you to get any points" well sorry for trying to survive lmao
---
Balanced Landing, Borrowed Time, Bond and last perk is flex. Usually like to switch between Spine Chill, Decisive or Iron Will.
---
I've just never had lightweight do much for me. A new perk might be better suit for what I designed, but it was just personal opinion. I dont think current Lightweight has any real issues
---
Benedict Baker would be a good candidate. He was the one to "write the lore", through his journal entries about the Entity and their realm. 
---
Itd make sense that he'd would become a killer eventually as he was one of the first survivors and he obviously isn't a playable character yet.
---
See, I used to think it was fun to play solo BECAUSE of that reason. But because of how the ranking system works, it's so hard to keep your rank up that way.
---
I wont know, but i‚Äôll be reassured that if it is one of the many stupid maps i wont have to worry about that shit
---
I'm in Central time.
---
Were there two janes? Was one of them wearing the super blue suit? I also remember someone might have been fast entering a locker over and over. I did this a few matches.
---
This will seem really tacky and like I'm looking for attention but please upvote. I need the confidence boost. I had a bad day.
---
I loved the movies soo I have a sort of bias
---
I did not mean to be so gullible. If it‚Äôs not a real perk, I wonder why I always get caught down there.
---
I like this.
---
If 3 gens and ruin pop while you're dropping every pallet on my head I will gladly keep chasing you.
---
It's basically a free 4k as you left everybody else defenseless
---
You realize it‚Äôs 4v1, someone is gonna get the short end of the stick and no matter someone isn‚Äôt leaving the match happy. If killer catches no one, he ain‚Äôt happy unless he‚Äôs letting them farm. If a survivor doesn‚Äôt escape, he ain‚Äôt happy unless he‚Äôs masochistic.
---
Yeah I‚Äôll definitely be telling him off if he tries to talk to me and you‚Äôd think he‚Äôd be a child with how he acted but no we‚Äôre all over 20 lol, but yeah he can go fuck off and thanks it‚Äôs nice to hear that better friends will come :)
---
Man, if my friend did that to me I woulda laughed hard or at least had a good heart pounding scare.
---
Having said that, if you‚Äôve been through thick and thin with them and they decided to block you for this, something must be up with them IRL.
---
Give them time. It‚Äôs just a game. Just because he decided to get mad at you because of it, doesn‚Äôt mean that you should cut him out of your life like some have suggested. Let them reflect on their behavior. You‚Äôve done nothing wrong (from what I can see in your post). If they don‚Äôt unblock you, that‚Äôs their loss. If they do decide to mend fences, then let it happen and be best buds again. Sometimes people just want to rage quit and need some time to cool off. Be the bigger person and let love for your friendship always take precedence.
---
As a side note, if they were suicidal at one point, it doesn‚Äôt mean they might be actually over it. That tends to linger for a long while. Try to make sure that this event is limited to the game itself and not any other external factors if possible.
---
Either way, don‚Äôt get too hung up about this!
---
Plus it was implied that he was losing his sanity
---
I personally agree. I don‚Äôt enjoy playing against him and feel he gets you Exposed way too fast.
---
Don‚Äôt worry too much about the people downvoting you and attacking you. I was on reddit years ago and noticed that the toxic players love to prey on those in the rant tab. They‚Äôre in denial that they‚Äôre assholes. They‚Äôre just lonely and unhappy and are ready to pick a fight with anyone. I feel bad for them if anything.
---
I respect your opinion and you‚Äôre not the only one who shares this sentiment.
---
*survivor proceeds to complain about time wasted*
---
I non-ironically go no mither, tenacity, unbreakable and flip flop to essentially guarantee I get de pipped in hopes that one day the killer forgets what no mither does.
---
Poor Dwight. :(
---
Lithe + Dance With Me is a beautiful combo.
---
What's your steam name
---
I play pc, I‚Äôm not too good still new to pc dbd but I mean if u want we can play and shit I‚Äôm just still a noobüòÇ
---
Idk why but I'm picturing a survivor hearing another survivor hearing them heal in a locker and yelling "THAT BETTER BE HEALING I HEAR IN THERE"
---
I guess they didn't like my jo-joke.
---
&gt;  It's not particularly great, but it's the one to grab from her if you had to choose just one.
---
Run it with Lithe and it becomes hilarious.
---
Dan Paladin (the artist from Battleblock / Castle Crashers / other Behemoth games) is a pretty big inspiration
---
IF DC'ING ISN'T PUNISHED BY DEATH AFTER DEDICATED SERVERS ARE ONLINE, YOU DONE FUCKED UP BHVR. PUNISH HARD, BECAUSE IT RUINS THE GAME, AND WITH QUEUE TIMES THIS BAD AT RED RANKS, I'M NOT PLAYING OR SPENDING MONEY ON YOUR GAME. IF I WILL BUY STRANGE THINGS DLC IS ALL ON YOU BHVR.
---
Sure, haha
---
I find that what you designed is just made bad by being rng. Something similar with a specific trigger would be cool, which dance with me is exactly. 
---
Lightweight might not do much for you, or maybe you just don't notice. You literally cant as a survivor notice its effect (except with new fixated). But dont call for change on what isn't bad.
---
GOING AGAINST A FOUR MAN IS ONE OF THE MOST DISCOURAGING THINGS IN THIS GAME. ARE YOU EVEN GOOD IF IT TAKES YOU AND THREE FRIENDS TO GET TO RED RANKS? AS A KILLER I AM SOLO, I GET THERE WITH MY SKILL. PISS OFF IN THE END CHAT SAYING I'M TOXIC FOR TRYING TO 4K.
---
somber
---
FUCKING W8TING FOR THE SWITCH RELEASE SINCE THE START OF JUNE
---
Ah now it sounds great
---
The thickest boy
---
lockers are cool again with Head On
---
thanks man
---
To be completely honest, this sounds fake to me.
---
It just reminds me of the stuff I used to post online back when I was a pre-teen lol.
---
I‚Äôm sorry if it isn‚Äôt and I hope you and him can find healing and potentially make amends.
---
Interesting...
---
Oh I thought it was a spiked rocket
---
As a killer main with two monitors. You're not wasting my time. *You're wasting yours*
---
Mostly china. Most gorey games arent banned like that. Australia might have a issue but that's just in rare cases like Dead Island.
---
I did say in the comment that I didnt actually think lightweight wasnt a bad perk, and that it was personal preference
---
Oh damn over 20. That's wild haha oh yeah I've lost and gained friends through out my gamimg years. It happens.. This year alone I've meet some amazing funny ass people just cause I invited them into party and best thing about that you don't like them kick them from the party haha which I've done lot. For me if teammates are been helpful am a want to talk to you to say thanks and get the crack going. To be fair you gotta be prepare to talk to me hahaha wildcard yo.
---
I WANT THE NEW CHAPTER AND I WANT IT NOW
---
There is a perk that lets the killer know your in the basement.
---
Pfffff I‚Äôll just never leave the basement, now you‚Äôll never get my aura!
---
Especially when Nancy comes out, I think totems may go faster when you get free health from them.
---
Yes, me saying "dont call for change on what isn't broken" was addressing that. You say lightweight is fine but suggested a change in your post. I dont see the logic there.
---
Yeah well they were public. And it's not like they're famous or anything.
---
pmed u my discord ill def be playing tonight.
---
You‚Äôre making a blanket statement. This is your opinion; not a fact.
---
It was just personal. I stated that. That means I know it doesnt need changed, and it was just my own personal thing. I never stated that every perk on here needed adjusted, and I stated that some of it was personal
---
Or a prayer beads spirit
---
Meyers with a shirt on over his jumpsuit
---
And inner strength :D
---
Well to each their own beliefs i won‚Äôt attack you for it as so much stuff is fake on the internet but this is not I have proof such as the texts but I don‚Äôt feel the need to show them to the world
---
It don't let the assholes get to me, most of them give up after they realize I'm willing to have a debate on how certain mechanics act in game and specific shit like that. 
---
I speak out of not only my own experience but also speak from the perspective of the streamers and youtubers who literally play the game for a job. 
---
Good example would be Puppers, he's one of the best survivors in the game and he has played for so long he can feel movement speed changes from killers who have play with your food stacks or noed. 
---
When he and other streamers expressed their hate towards spirit just being a 50/50 factory, everyone agreed. But when I come on the reddit and want to talk about the specifics. The assholes come out of the woodworks to shit talk me just to shit talk me. You could present them a data set of 1,000 situations where spirit can easily cause a 50/50 and they'll still say some shit like "JUST RUN IRON WILL" or "JUST RUN AWAY FROM THE PALLET"
---
I have no clue why people jump on a post with pure toxicity instead of attempting to have some form of conversation.
---
Ight airfield
---
Always have hope. Bunny Feng is a need lol
---
I know but I'm just saying imo they're so boring, low effort and easily spammed, I don't think it's fact everyone has a right to find stuff funny it's just so annoying seeing the same joke over and over again.
---
I understand. I wouldn‚Äôt expect you to do that.
---
I‚Äôve been in the situation you‚Äôre in with KYF groups.
---
Our solution is to discuss beforehand if we plan to go try hard mode. It eliminates issues and quarrels. Best of luck.
---
I don‚Äôt mind it during a chase, unless I‚Äôm playing Nurse. Then people aren‚Äôt tbagging as a challenge, it‚Äôs humiliation. Most killers I take it as a challenge when I get tbagged in a chase. I don‚Äôt like it when they‚Äôre at the exit gates or hatch though. I get it, you got out. Quit wasting my time and leave.
---
If you don't mind some suggestions, (most) people nowadays don't really want to watch 45 minutes of multiplayer gameplay without commentary. I'd recommend either narrating / adding commentary or otherwise condensing your video into highlights rather than just raw footage.
---
Idk, may not be the case, I'm curious if others feel the same way or not
---
Im new to the game, why does people hate Dwight ?
---
That‚Äôs a rip
---
Guy was just being a turd.
---
Yes
---
Yeah sure, but just as any M1 killer he will be looped for days even by new survivors since his power doesn't help.
---
WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY FUCK YOU TO THE TEABAGGING SWF BULLY SQUAD THAT ACCUSED ME OF LAGSWITCHING WHEN I ONLY GOT ONE KILL. MAYBE THEYD LIKE IT BETTER IF I PLAYED NOED NURSE INSTEAD OF A FUN JUMPSCARE BUBBA BUILD
---
Yes please I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm suppose to upgrade all 3 new characters without double bp
---
insidious camping in basement is toxic, otherwise fine.
---
Showing objects after completing a gen is what Detectives Hunch already does. And WGLF is alright u can get stacks by safe hook rescues tanking hits and flashlight saves. Just give it an effect which at least could help during a the game.
---
You need to get that tasty prove thyself tho
---
Back during the 3rd anniversary, My friend fire cracker saved me right before a mori, but the killer had started the animation, and it crashed everyone's game. 
---
Weirdest thing ever. Never could replicate it.
---
Feng Min Smash!!!!!!!!
---
Cant find you but my friend code is - 241308149 (and other people can add me if they want)
---
Feng want Snu Snu.
---
Same thing but jake instead
---
Y O S
---
At the moment Jeff. But I have only played for 35 hours so far and only did Meg, David and one time Claudette.
---
Oh yeah, in the map with the boat? It was you!
---
When my partner and I don't like the toxicity, we go into Kill Your Friends and play "hide and seek". We just ran around the map and meme. It's really fun when he plays Bubba and we get the Swamp because I can see him from several places as he looks for me.
---
It's honestly so fun.
---
I literally just did this lol
---
Iron will, spine chill, bond, self-care
---
I never understood the shirtless Myers joke tbh and never found it funny at all. How can he even be shirtless anyways if he doesn't even wear a shirt lol I mentioned how I felt about it before on here and it got quote a bit of negativity.
---
Huh, What are the odds?
---
Feng is the killer now
---
The computer has sentenced the men to dwarf
---
Death.
---
Death, by snu sun!
---
That‚Äôs fair.
---
P3 Claudette ?
---
**DISGUSTING**
---
Oh Sad...the hatch always spawns there on that map..haha
---
its not really facecamping if you're the only person left in a match
---
No one hates Dwight, he‚Äôs precious
---
I just feel like if you aren‚Äôt interested in the meme, keep scrolling instead of making them feel bad.
---
This does not fempute.
---
Premium Grade Nightmare fuel I love it!!!! Nice work!
---
If anyone wants to add me also mine is 241292295
---
Wow, I didn't know "intellectual" is a slur now. I guess it was only a matter of time those pesky incels would demand being treated as equals.
---
It's been brutal but I'm picking things up quickly lol, so far nea has suited me well
---
Just wait til she gets her bunny hood. She‚Äôll be Lil Huntress.
---
Nah but see if you NEVER leave the basement it's fine
---
Stop bulli
---
I do I'm just staying my opinion here as im not directly saying their jokes unfunny also people need to learn when to stop spamming the same down joke over and over again it's just uncreative sure it may be harsh but they need to learn.
---
Demogorgon in a maid outfit OwO
---
Feng has had enough of the entity's bullshit
---
FLIP SIDE I MAY START RUNNING STAKE OUT BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE EVERY KILLER RUNS RUIN EVEN IF THEY DON‚ÄôT NEED IT
---
Hmm, yeah then it's totally their fault for dying and they deserve the camp.
---
Baby Dwight here.
---
Nobody needs to stop doing anything just because you personally find it unfunny.
---
I'm a Jane mane since she is p3 and I almost have all the perks I have unlocked on her. She is first dlc character I bought so that's probably why.
---
Aha! Does every killer have access to this perk, or is it specific to only one/some?
---
me trying to hit Claudette on a Macmillan Estate map
---
She even has the bowl hair cut of a serial killer
---
Anytime you posted ideas for reworks people just drag you to hell and back. This sub is very negative and unkind.
---
I didn‚Äôt read every single one, but the ones I did read sounded very unique and interesting. You have some great ideas in here. I enjoyed reading through it.
---
What‚Äôs your friend code?
---
Ah yes I forgot that I should take one of the best perks in the game that counters all Killers. Want me to also run Self Care, Decisive Strike, and Adrenaline to survive? Don't want to stop countering Killers now.
---
Spine Chill won't stop a Ghost Face from playing his Killer, but learning how to pallet loop will. Nice try at being condescending.
---
MAYBE WAIT TIL FRIDAY FOR THE RANK RESET
---
For Survivors. Now it's anything but fun for Killers.
---
I mean, Otzdarva said he thinks Ghost Face is one of the highest tier killers in the game, so that's at least one favourite streamer...
---
I think Ghost Face is fun to play. I love sneaking up on people and scaring the shit out of them with an insta-down. Having that insta-down in your back pocket is nice too, but as a killer you have to work for it. Because he's a stealth killer, he has virtually no gen pressure, which imo is pretty balanced - he can't run across the map like Billy or Freddy to punish people with BBQ, he can't switch targets easily if he's already marked one, he doesn't have any gimmick that lets him end chases early other than marks. 
---
Is he gimmicky? Of course, but some of the best/most fun killers are
---
It's just RNG. The more teachable perks you have unlocked the harder it becomes to find the perk you want in a bloodweb so keep that in mind.
---
Must be some hidden achievement. :D
---
It's called getting good for a reason
---
it is entirely RNG. the next update will make getting it a little easier since the higher you level up the more perks will become available to unlock in a bloodweb. It's all luck ;-;
---
RNG. Technically you can increase your relative odds of finding it by not learning other teachables hence lowering your overall RNG pool but it is pretty much just RNG. Do your daily quests and save up a chunk before you start leveling a character.
---
M'lady
---
didn't realize ghostface was there for a good 10 seconds lmao great post op
---
What's noed
---
The awkward moment when the baby Dwight is letting you stalk him on the other side of the pallet
---
Hex: No one escapes death
---
T-shirt that says ‚ÄúLicensed killers are getting cosmetics and all I got was this lousy T-shirt‚Äù
---
He can't switch targets easily? Go look at otzdarva's recent video and tell me that again lmao. Ghost face feels as if I'm playing make believe with a kid and no matter what I do, they say they have a force field that can block anything.
---
I LOOK AT YOU! ***Force Field***
---
See I wouldn't mind it too much If they weren't spammed constantly, it's the same joke over and over again and I gurantee alot of other people feel this way, a shirtless killer joke just isn't funny anymore if it's just posted so damn much I want actual jokes not just "BHVR GIVE USE. SHIRTLESS DEMOGORGON LOL IM SO FUNNY THIS HASNT BEEN SAID TO DEATH."
---
WHY ARE GHOSTFACE PLAYERS THE WAY THEY ARE
---
IT'S ONLY THEM
---
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
---
Yeah I should I‚Äôm just really angry at him I‚Äôll definitely keep what you said in mind if he unblockes me and wants to talk, thank you
---
That's not the word I was referring to.
---
It‚Äôs completely random when it will show up in the bloodweb for each character. In order to better your chances of it appearing early: 
---
- don‚Äôt unlock any other characters teachable perks yet.
---
- if you have to choose between two perks on the web, go for the higher tier one.  Once you have a perk to tier 3, it will not show up on bloodweb anymore (thus making it more likely to get the perk you want on the next one).
---
You were probably Mori cancelling. BHVR bans killer BM now, but not survivor BM.
---
DbD on Xbox doesn't support mouse and keyboard.
---
Me:I‚Äôm gonna win this game by skill...
---
Noed: *Im just gonna sneak myself in here*
---
If you look up right now, you'll see a gust of wind fly past your head.
---
Claudette is the worst. 
---
Dwight is the 2nd best and has two awesome perks.
---
Oh god
---
Christ.
---
It has its niche. Some people find commentary to be cumbersome and annoying, especially in a game like DbD. The average YouTuber or streamer might just be like "spooky game, better yell a lot."
---
Running self care is stupid, just run a yellow medkit and free up the perk slot.
---
Also spine chill doesn't counter all the killers in the game, ignoring myers, all it does is let you know a killer is looking at you. Which gives you maximum 2 seconds to either hide or get ready to loop. 
---
Also I know how to loop, but it's impossible to loop a ghost face that has you 99'd on either a T-wall or most jungle gyms. You can only guarantee to not get killed on a long wall. Once he exposes you, he now has no terror radius and has walls to stop you from breaking him out of stalk, allowing him to insta down you off of the smallest mistake and you have to be on your toes the whole time.

"take No Mither from your forgetten perks and to¬†derank down¬†until you find a "land that knows nothing of the meta", where the¬†*broken* status¬†would be mistaken for you have already been hit"
---
I thought I would try it, the keyboard works fine but the mouse doesn‚Äôt :/ I‚Äôm just going to have to rebuy everything on pc
---
&gt;This weekend starts with rank reset, it is Friday the 13th AND we will be having a rare full moon on the 13th. Plus people want to grind bloodpoints to level up all the new characters coming out. This would encourage more people to play and to buy the DLC!
---
But the DLC hasn't been announced yet, unlikely that we will get it before Tuesday (17th). What would be the point of having the event now? Apart from leveling old characters. 
---
Not even new players coming with ST will be able to enjoy such event.
---
It's a Huntress perk called Territorial Imperative. If someone gets the Huntress a high tier it can unlock for all killers.
---
Me and my 4 man swf went against someone who did this and we spent the whole game trying to get the item, it was a brown med kit. Totally worth it
---
oooooohhhhh shhhiiiiiiitttttt
---
caaaaaallllll 99999999----
---
iiii'm jussst gonnna liiie dooown oon thheee coooldddd flooooor
---
Is using a controller really that bad?
---
Go away big gay weeb
---
Is that what a bot looks like? It looked like she was just moving around and swinging randomly.
---
Corvo skin for nurse?
---
Fat myers is a build where you put on 2 addons that make you slower, which makes you slower than survivors.
---
Remember Me got nerfed hard and Fired Up is crap. Blood Warden is situational and it's better to have a perk that's active all game anyway.
---
Sometimes I just stand at the exit gate as wraith and bing bong to let everyone know they‚Äôre too good for me and I want to enjoy the escape with them
---
maybe it's just from my poor editing but thats what one of the outfits kinda look like lol
---
If killer queues are going to be terrible a couple weeks after release you may want to just level up the survivors so you can actually use them. You'll probably have enough time to level up demo after the new chapter hype is over
---
Put them together and get magic mike
---
I DON'T GET WHY I KEEP GETTING KILLER DAILYS, I DON'T WANNA DEAL WITH SURVIVORS I WANNA BE A SURVIVOR
---
I sent a support letter to Behavior after a guy called me a f-got n-ger and told me to hang myself. His Steam Profile has a link to a full Imgur album of times he's been banned from Dead by Daylight for toxicity.
---
It took them **a full month** to get back to me, and the only reply I got was "we're looking into this report."
---
They then sent me a letter to ask if I was satisfied with my service. Lol?
---
I still hide in lockers sometimes
---
Whammu!
---
Again, nobody needs to stop doing anything just because you personally find it unfunny. I‚Äôm sure many dislike it, and many love it. I personally don‚Äôt care about the meme. I‚Äôm not gonna make people feel like shit for it, though.
---
Just move on yo.
---
I don't know why you're being downvoted for this. It's really stupid that there's no refund option in general and especially if it was caused due to an error (according to your full story in the comments) you should really be reimbursed.
---
I think there should be a 24 hour refund period at least, in case you buy a skin to check it out with your other cosmetics and find that you don't like it.
---
Hope it wasn't too much money for you. :/
---
I played someone who started to the gun ran at me hit me with Franklins, and then dc'd so I couldn't get it back :(
---
Im in this picture and I dont like it
---
This would just be random items anywhere on the map, unlike Detective's Hunch's all items within a range. Then it would then be an exact parallel to BBQ. BBQ you hook someone and see your objectives (survivors). With the new WGLF, you complete an objective (gen, totem, healing) and it shows you some your objectives. This would ensure you actually get rewarded with the stackable BPs for doing things that help with the game more than just unhooks, which are extremely limited in quantity, and protection hits or saves, which either don't count properly, or are difficult to get.
---
Trust me she/he was real, that or she‚Äôs a self teaching AI as she figured out how to hook people before the wiggle free and how to break pallets near the end
---
If he was asleep he just gets the lullaby. instead of the terror radius which can be disorienting.
---
Terror radius turns into lullaby while slept
---
What‚Äôs the purpose of that? Just a meme build?
---
Half agree with you, half don't. It isn't on a player to not use powerful mechanics due to a preconceived notion of "fair play", but it *is* on a player to *not be a dick.*
---
Being a dick, no matter how you do it, is just *being a dick.* It's kind of implied.
---
Buy Leatherface. Mostly for his perks (BBQ, Franklin's Demise, Knockout) but the killer is not that bad either. Obviously he isn't as good as Spirit or Nurse but still playable and has solid meme builds.
---
As a sadistic Michael main, I would say to get him
---
Yea
---
This is common in the game. He did it because someone DCd.
---
Depends on what teachables you have unlocked and what you're looking for.  
---
Myers is an awesome killer because his add ons can really mix his gameplay up, but his teachables are a little lackluster compared to some of the others.
---
Well the demogorgon isn't even out yet and it's best to wait to see how the killer is in live servers instead of instantly buying them but yes if you really want the gorgon then you do you, for the other killers I'd say freddy as he's the best out of the bunch with his pressure and chase potential
---
Ace in the hole, plunderer, dead hard and ds
---
If one person cleanses I make it my goal to use every single fountain. Then the game forces plague to have corrupt purge, and all the fountains are clean again.
---
It‚Äôs lucky, and having luck is special enough.
---
if you ask me to explain the joke it would lose its purpose but.. ok.. i guess.. 
---
it‚Äôs not about shirtless myers himself, its a general joke seen mostly in dark humor websites about kinkshaming oneself with weird shit and the punch line being proud of it. ‚ÄúShirtless myers‚Äù is just a continuation of the joke of ‚Äúwanting daddy myers to strangle me and mori me with his big hard knife‚Äù going way overboard to being unconditional lust towards the killer
---
tl;dr: people wanting you to think they are unironically degenerates went too far
---
LF for BBQ and if you already have bbq plague
---
&gt;be invisible
---
&gt;be viable
---
*Cries in Wraith*
---
On topic I do wish that they'd nerf Spirit, Nurse, and Hillbilly and then nerf Survivors to be on par with all the other Killers and the new "big three."
---
A game will always have a meta and will always have the best characters, but I think the "big three" right now are far too high above the power curve and do really need nerfs.

QoL Suggestion: Let me harass people more easily.

&gt;So you gave a suggestion and a solid counter argument for it as well. Small brain plays.
---
Dam it is but need to turn on vpn
---
Honestly, i love playing against high rank people as long as theyre not toxic. You can learn so much about how they play and use it to get better
---
I'm inclined to say neither is balanced, but NOED is definitely far more of a problem than Adrenaline.
---
Just dont give him any ultra rares because moris are important on him
---
Im in school, im scared
---
No Mither + Tenacity
---
Freddy is stronger although his teachable perks aren't great. Freddy is probably the 3rd best killer in the game. Myers is mid-tier but can snowball extremely well. However, he lacks map control and getting to EW 2 can be annoying. His teachables are okay but excluding Save The Best For Last are situational. He can be very fun and he's the only killers in the game that's allowed to murder survivors without a Mori or putting a trap on them and hoping and praying that they die.
---
Ahoy, ladies
---
I don't approve of deranking but I approve of it a little more as Killer.
---
With that in mind just farm or do some silly shit. When I wanted to learn Nurse I spammed basementface for awhile to derank.
---
You can also try "fifth Survivor" Pig, where you walk around while crouched all game and "help" your allies do gens.
---
I'm okay with an occasional silly game with an occasional Killer acting funny. It's just lame when you got those Killers who load into a match and then instantly DC.
---
I know that but one guy told me he couldn't hear me.
---
Monitor and Abuse me with it! „ÉΩ(=^ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•^=)‰∏ø

Block the guy on PS4 (if you can IDK how PS4 works) and possibly report him for threats if you're actually worried. But more likely than not it's some twelvie being salty that he lost one round of a video game.

IT‚ÄôS WHAT‚ÄôS STOPPED ME FROM PLAYING RECENTLY.  I‚ÄôM A RANK 15 KILLER, STOP PUTTING ME AGAINST RANK 2-3 SURVIVORS WHERE THE GAME DOESN‚ÄôT EVEN LAST LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO LEARN WAYS TO COUNTER THEM BECAUSE I DON‚ÄôT HAVE STALL PERKS AND THEY ALL USE BNPs. THEY‚ÄôD BETTER FIX MATCHMAKING COME DEDICATED SERVERS.
---
Pretty sure this guy once got me a couple months ago. Name sounds familiar.
---
In this case it's a sign of nofucksatall, a disease I freely give.
---
Why didnt they add this
---
Imagine calling Struggling pointless lmao. It makes it harder to for the Killer to carry you and does give you a chance to wiggle off if your allies bodyblock or sabo.
---
The problem with Struggling is the hook density, yes. There are too many hooks on the map atm. But saying struggling is useless is akin to saying slugging is useless because Survivors can pick eachother up.
---
Btw, be careful what you call it. I think what you‚Äôre looking for is ‚Äúgrinding.‚Äù When people talk about BP farming, they usually mean the killer+survivors not doing the objective and instead farming bloodpoints together: survivor keeps touching gen and killer keeps kicking it, survivor keeps getting hit and then killer lets them heal back up, etc.
---
For grinding BP, killer is much, much better. Most survivor games you‚Äôll get 15k-20k whereas with killer you‚Äôll usually get 25-32k if youre at least decent as killer (without offerings/perks). Killer also seems to be a lot more consistent with how the games go, whereas survivor games depend so much on how your teammates are. 
---
Run BBQ&amp;Chili if you have it and a survivor pudding and you‚Äôre looking at at least 60k BP every game.
---
holy fuck that's like the funniest thing I've ever heard of someone doing so far.  
---
Imagine the sheer confusion leading to seething hatred and finally laughter.

Please tell me if hes rank one with him he must be a bad character

Bond, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Dead Hard, or Balanced Landing
---
Two week from the PTB as expected. Let's see how many bugs from the PTB remain in the live release.
---
?
---
Good deal, I should be done with my initial BL3 play through to enjoy the chapter on release.
---
Hiding in lockers is a legit strat at times. If you know the killer doesn't have time to thoroughly check the area then you can just hide in a locker and they won't bother. You obviously have to predict their behaviour well though.
---
I know lol it was a swf I was screaming at them to get out of the way
---
It just got announced.
---
Double bp 20th-22???
---
Nice flair. Are you my evil twin?
---
I've played against this guy, or something with the same idea! 
---
It was on Jigsaw's map and he was bouncing the stairs to the basement, just revving his chainsaw when anyone would come up, but he let the Detective in cause he was in uniform xD fucking banger of a game, really funny guy in end game chat too.
---
I just remembered I was too broke to afford the chapter lol.
---
Does this mean the double BP event is likely this weekend?
---
Bleeding out occupies the space between escaping and being sacrificed/mori'd.
---
What rank are you?
---
What? He gets broken out of his power easily. Even with "pocket insta downs" hes nowhere near a spirit or nurse
---
Well I should be able to critique someone's stuff and give my feelings about it I'm not trying to make them feel bad I'm just staying what I think about it. As you said move on
---
Hopefully!!!
---
Yep, we had the same guy.....
---
**"Misery and woe, my dudes."**

*flosses*

BETTER YET, I'M A RANK LIKE 18 KILLER, LESS THAN 10 MATCHES IN, AND GO AGAINST PRO LOOPERS AND PEOPLE WHO LOVE TO FLASHLIGHT SAVE CONSTANTLY. I BARELY WANT TO PLAY KILLER BUT KEEP BUYING NEW KILLERS SO RIP ME. ALSO I HAVE LITERALLY NO PERKS SO RIP ME TWICE

Survivors when running broken perks, overpowered items, broken map offerings, and gen rushing to shit: LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL KILLER SO BAD GET REKT BABY GO BACK TO RANK 20 NOOB UNINSTALL AND HANG YOURSELF XDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
Survivors when the Killer brings a single Ultra Rare offering that requires them to be hook 1 less time: OMGGGGGGGGG TOXIC KILLER MAAAAAAAIN SO ENTITLED I HOPE YOU GET PUSHED OUT A WINDOW AND FUCKING DIE NO ONE LOVES YOU I HOPE YOUR FAMILY DISOWNS YOU
---
Sounds like r/entitledsurvivors getting mad that you used an offering. Using a Mori on a Survivor near the hatch and then closing it isn't toxic: it's strategic play to get 4 kills. &gt;!(Closing the hatch in front of a Survivor and then Moriing them is another matter entirely d:)!&lt;
---
In the words of BrickyOrchid: Don't let anyone tell you how to play *your* game. No made up honour code or list of ethics; do whatever you need to do in order to win.
---
And don't let people being assholes get you down. It's Rank 13; dying as a Survivor at that rank means practically nothing.
---
NOED is a fair perk because of all the survivor perks. The cringey part is that the dude admits he couldn‚Äôt catch him without NOED. Gotta learn how to chase down if you want to be an average killer otherwise what are you doing? Lol yes yes ‚Äúlet people enjoy the game  yada yada‚Äù but any killer who cannot confidently track someone down after a free hit is no killer main. Not a chance. Lol
---
It‚Äôs fine but I‚Äôve been playing with controller for that long I feel like I need a change lmao
---
thats awesome
---
Ayyyy an early birthday present from BHVR! 
---
Now I can't wait for the 17th.
---
I agree, you should be able to. But your expression of your feelings was pointless in this scenario.
---
But you do you. Have a good one.
---
I literally only play Killer to do daily's and grind for perks (in case i wanna actually get serious killing) so I do goofy shit like this all the time.
---
Okay but Halloween 2018 Myers.
---
I totally agree, I think it works better than her default one.
---
Initially I only chose it because the mask was my favorite huntress mask, though the outfit the mask comes in IMO doesn't match the aesthetic of the mask. I think this coat works a lot better, gives her more of a necromancy/cultish feel.
---
We love fashion posts and she looks really cute!
---
I never understood that either, unless they just want to depip. I never DC. Even  when the killer camps the entire match. If I can't find the hatch in time. I'll just loop the killer until the entity takes me.
---
Myers wearing a heavy parka like that kid from A Christmas Story
---
I'd actually totally buy an Arctic Myers though ngl.
---
Whatever you say man, from my experience playing as and against him, he's just a gimmick and in no way a unique or fun killer.
---
Well that was kinda predicted but boy oh boy am I ready I'm saving up my shards to repurchase perks so I can P3 my demogorgon fast af
---
Beautiful corvo mask. Dishonored is my favorite game of all time. Wouldn‚Äôt it be cool if they had tallboys in dishonored somehow; a game mode or as part of a killer.
---
Fucking meat game map. Just hate it.
---
Rank doesn't matter, if you think it does then you should probably reevaluate your own skill.
---
Overly sexual posts belong on r/dbdgonewild
---
That fashion is top tier also realized there isn't a fashionbydaylight sub and I'm disappointed
---
Maybe.
---
I never understood how a person can be "12$ short". How can you live on such an insanely tight budget?
---
IT'S BECAUSE MOST OF THEM THINK THEY'RE SUPER GOOD DUE TO HIS ABILITY OF PREYING ON PEOPLE WHO AREN'T 100% PAYING ATTENTION
---
Good god, now I can't use my Ace in the Hole it's real tight security
---
Yes, my body is ready.
---
Same to you good day and hope your week will be great
---
Great perk idea.
---
Change the name to "Dragon's Heart" with a claw gripping a chest for its icon and we got a solid thing.  
---
Howabout if you change the name I'll do the icon free of charge, eh?
---
Lol so the boobs would be ‚Äúa good chase‚Äù like an episode of cops or somethin
---
You better have killed yourself. Also did you happen to bring a low ranking person into your swf to get baby killers?
---
Lockers have been cool since quick and quiet. Just need to learn how to use them in chase or to barely avoid the killer. Too many new players using them when they don‚Äôt have to. Honestly head on is kind of good and bad for the game. It‚Äôs fun as fuck but in the wrong hands it just leaves survivors spamming in and out of locker and not doing gens. I‚Äôd rather people just slap on object if they were planning on that.
---
I'm a student and DLC isn't my priority when I need to pay rent and food.
---
Shirtless everyone. But really where‚Äôs the petition for shirtless Myers on Halloween this year?

I was solo

 Licensed killers are getting cosmetics

\*aren't\*

Spirit fury without enduring??
---
Hoes that working out for you?
---
People say don't do it do you still get a free hit? Can you swing through pallet hit him pop Spirit and Hit him again ?
---
Territorial Imperative would be OP with Hex: Chest Keeper
---
Also you need to prioritize time. Spending too much time hiding when you don‚Äôt actually have to will hurt the objective immensely.
---
Thanks!!

Now we know what happened to S4 Robin!

---
THERES A NEW KILLER COMIN-- \*Warps back to 2019.\*
---
No need for territorial imperative if you are insidious camping on the basement chest hahaha
---
Get borrowed time at least.
---
Y'know, why don't they just make the hoodie two pieces (hat and torso piece) but when you equip one, it automatically just equips the other. Then you can just choose what pants you want and there ya go.
---
I mean.. it's gotta be a safe unhook for that.
---
Idk dude maybe their aroused that they are getting rid of the ruin
---
WHERES THE DLC?!?!
---
*insert Territorial Beast here*
---
Yes it would lmao I would run it. Would we make it killer specific or put it as a learnable for all?
---
hope they also put the game itself on sale, like 50% off
---
YEAH THAT‚ÄôS PAR THE COURSE. ONLY REASON I HIT 15 IS BECAUSE I GOT THERE AGAINST PEOPLE MY OWN RANK AND THEN MATCHMAKER DECIDED TO SHIT THE BED AND RUIN EVERYTHING.  AT LEAST THE LULL IN DBD FOR ME HAS MADE ME FALL IN LOVE WITH RIMWORLD AGAIN.
---
I agree, he feels like a gimmick. But hes honestly not that great of a killer. He was meta for like a month and then everyone realized that once you break him out of his power he can be looped super easily. Michael is way better than him
---
If you can hit them and then they throw the pallet, it does make the second hit easier whilst also breaking that pallet loop at the same time. Not to mention he can mindgame at pallets if you know when to use the saw, which helps him charge spirit fury.
---
New lore, Demogorgon takes Meyers's shirt

Understandable. Unfortunately, yeah, you'd have to rebuy everything on PC :(

SORRY FOR THE MATCHMAKING, IT DO BE LIKE THAT. I'M JEALOUS YOU AT LEAST GOT TO 15 WITH PEOPLE YOUR RANK, WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE I'M SURE

I'd say make it a teachable.
---
EVEN IF YOU ARE PAYING 100% ATTENTION YOU ARE STILL ON A LOUD-ASS GENERATOR AGAINST A COMPLETELY SILENT (NOT EVEN MYER'S BREATHING LEVEL) COMPLETELY FULL SPEED KILLER KNOWING YOU'RE ON A GENERATOR BECAUSE HE CAN HEAR THE GENERATOR, CAPABLE OF APPROACHING FROM ANY SIDE AND LEANING WHEN DETECTING HIM OUT OF NIGHTSHROUD IS A PITA AND NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE'S LEANING EVEN IF HE CAN'T JUST RESET YOUR PROGRESS.
---
Even if you play bubba optimally, in a situation like that, youre gonna get looped multiple rimes until you force a pallet drop. At least even with trapper, you can force them to abandon a pallet by baiting with a trap placement
---
MY NUT JUST FLEW ACROSS THE ROOM.
---
THANK YOU FOR THIS NEWS.
---
As someone with a phone, I'm not wasting my time.
---
Nooo
---
I hate when DBP is the same weekend as rank reset.
---
Happened to me, but it was a wraith who just kept ding donging after he downed me.  Didn‚Äôt hook me, just left me on the floor.  TBF to him tho, I did run him around for 5 gens.  Still got out, thanks to an Ace with an instaheal
---
Hold on, I'm coming to save yo- oh...
---
Corrupt Intervention is a top ter perk but plague is 'meh' when compared to Myers or Freddy.
---
Really wish it was after the new content drops... I've got 1 Mil saved up and ready.

Lets be honest here ghostface looks like a damn ring wraith.
---
Probably lol
---
Huntress with TI and Hex: chest with Ruin and BBQ and Chili
---
Salty Lips and Nothing More
---
I fail to understand how that‚Äôs a free 4k. Have seen survivors run killers all around the map without needing pallets. Using vaults and exhaustion perks.
---
I almost never see Daddy Myers anymore.
---
I mean.... they are *rubbing* them, perhaps practice?
---
look up other friends steven universe if you want to hear the original audio
---
I'm so prepared I even got a bunch of iridescent shards to repurchase perks for BP and I'm gonna get my dailies ready for this. P3 DEMOGORGON HERE I COME
---
Was this made by a 10 year old
---
PTB should be closed now.
---
Where can i find the original picture for this?
---
I remember that, I believe I have the thread saved give me a sec.
---
Yes if you break him out of his power he's just an m1 killer, but if you go look at people like otzdarva or int3r4ct play ghost face, you see how it's so damn easy to stop survivors from breaking your cloak. Then you just build everyone you can to 99 and next time you get them to a jungle gym, you now have no terror radius or bloodstain with an insta down waiting for them.
---
My biggest problem with ghost face is him being able to 99 expose on people. He really should lose all stalk progress if broken out before exposing a survivor. This would force him to be more of a stealth killer, instead of just a walking tier 1 pocket tier 3 myers who can take advantage of meta perks to cover his inability to pressure gens.
---
It's over I believe.
---
So i guess tf2 x dbd is thing cause
---
1.Demoman/gorgon is a thing.
---
2.Rancho Relaxo Billy is a thing.
---
So... Yeah..

Killer: "Is there a Killer Rule book for Survivors?"
---
Survivors: "HAHAHAHAHAHA"
---
I wouldn't even be mad if they screencapped it and posted that due to that guy not being ready it's coming out the 18th
---
I'm wondering the same thing. If they DC at the beginning of the match, whatever, but if you're a good chunk of the way in and you just want to DC as a "fuck you" to the killer, you're screwing *yourself* over worse by throwing away literally *all* of the bloodpoints you've accrued that entire match. The killer still gets a DC bonus.
---
Probably closed by now.

I know. Makes me sad
---
I mean it's just an excuse for me to kill noed before my team potatoes the end of the game.
---
Lmao this is me
---
In my experience the lullaby is delayed for a few seconds while the teleportation sounds are happening. It doesn‚Äôt kick back in until Freddy has fully materialized.
---
The survivor probably just didn‚Äôt realize how close you were.
---
I see lots of higher level teams come in empty handed and all of the sudden they all got flashlight, toolboxes and a purple key. Would definitely run something like this with groups that aren't item stacked before the match. It would be fun y then if the killer could run a Shi y coin offering to get more bait across the map haha
---
I dont know why they just dont kick them over,  nope, rub them together...its gonna start a fire.  Maybe the bones are sharp :/

Are you playing as survivor?

Canonically? No idea. The hexed ones I'd guess the fire burning and non I guess that energy?

Actually? As a slight balance thing

Yeah, my connection to the killer was fine until it became unbearably laggy
---
do both
---
Freddy was really really unique before the rework and since he was really really unique I enjoyed him very much, new Freddy really doesn't have the charm of old Freddy there's nothing unique about him, he hits you or you fall asleep fake pallets like doctors, and snares like clowns gas he also just has teleportation. I'd say old Freddy was great fun but bad while new Freddy is great but meh in enjoyment
---
The boar axe with this set if perfect
---
The best part of new killers is you can run your face across the keyboard because people have no idea how to play against them. It's free matches mostly.

But insidious doesn't cover chainsaw

I‚Äôve done a basement guardian bubba before. It was fun but they never looked for me until the very end. Kinda sad to be alone the whole game :(
---
Hi! I was an old school freddy main, and I still main freddy. I miss the old freddy, but I‚Äôm aware that most players had problems with his playstyle. He was perhaps the most unique killer in the game, he was also amazing for farming points and if you used the correct addons you could become a mindgame master, not to mention his godlike tracking ability. 
---
He is still a really fun killer, and I would love if they had some kind of way to play ‚Äòclassic‚Äô freddy.
---
I played alot of Freddie before the rework.  He is stronger for sure now, but I am so use to his old playstyle and I was really,really good with using his strengths.  I am probably the only one who misses the old Freddie.
---
MAN FUCK GHOST FACE, NOW I'M MAD
---
play a killer you're bad at
---
i like to chase bebe killers
---
Look buddy I‚Äôm a hillbilly that means I chainsaw my problems.
---
Didn't he get perma-banned from DBD for something and that's why he hasn't uploaded any new montage-music-videos since the Freddy one?
---
YESSSSSSSS
---
You should also know about insidious which is a general killer perk. If they stand still for 2-4 seconds, they lose their terror radius and red stain til they move or attack again. That make it easy to ambush people in the basement or near a totem or gen when there is cover nearby.
---
I miss old freddy.
---
New freddy isnt bad by any means, hes much better all around
---
But old freddy was more fun.
---
I preferred going for the occulty vibe, so the runes on this axe were my pref
---
It‚Äôs annoying, entitlement at its finest. If I hook a player twice in a row I know if I find them again I best let them go and risk losing the whole round, otherwise it‚Äôs about an 80% chance they dc and still stick around for the endgame chat to call me a ‚Äútunneler‚Äù, in which case I usually reply with ‚Äúnah brah, u got farmed‚Äù
---
Wimp
---
Do you mean [this one?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jiGKPd6rKU) Because he never switched targets *after he already marked one*, like I'd said. It's a given that any killer can switch targets, but once you've committed to marking one, your best interest is getting that 1-hit down
---
It was really funny initially. I think a lot of people find something funny and they think they can just say it at any given time and get the laughs. This causes them to overlook how exhausting repetition can be. Also a lot of people ignore what makes something actually funny. Timing is a big thing and when everyone is just doing it 24/7 it becomes less of a joke to laugh at and more of an obligation to laugh at. If that makes sense? Idk I‚Äôve been thinking about this shit a long time. What is actually going through these people‚Äôs heads to laugh at the same joke over and over. Is it something to do with their ego or insecurities? I don‚Äôt fucking get it but I‚Äôm trying to.
---
Ive gotten 0 prayer beads and im level 47
---
YES SIR
---
I know of one already; the hair missing when hooked lol.
---
Quick tangential question:  are the dedicated servers out of testing yet, or will they be coming along with this new update?  Last I had heard about it was "end of Summer, 2019," which is just about up.
---
Ghostface is terrible against groups and struggles to apply map pressure. He‚Äôs a glorified m1 killer with insta-down POTENTIAL. Just fucking look at him and stop bitching.
---
I have some days where I run No Mither and Left Behind and I just hide in lockers whenever I hear a heartbeat or if I‚Äôm in a chase. It‚Äôs just fun to mess around with stupid stuff like that
---
That sounds like hell.
---
We need a dispenser riiiight here!
---
Yknow I never realised it was that long. I retract my opinion.
---
Sometimes I do this too. It's best with Billy, since your chainsaw revving doesn't cancel Insidious, so you can surprise players really easily if they come to the basement
---
You can counter it by leaving the chest alone.
---
I'm hoping it'll release right after the DLC.
---
I swear to god I‚Äôve seen this clip before
---
Unless you‚Äôre playing against Freddy with dream pallets.
---
I... don't know. I hope not. Dude was lit
---
Hard to keep scrolling when people are just essentially loopholing a repost. Very rarely is there a shirtless Myers meme that actual tries to be creative. Usually it‚Äôs just he fact that they said it. Gets boring
---
*gasp* it‚Äôs too powerful!
---
That was an initial suggestion I had before the rework hit, an add on to play classic Freddy. No idea how hard that is though to change that much for an add-on in the design/coding  end though.
---
I don't want to hook the same survivor twice in a row and be that guy. When I see the unhook go off and am close enough that it makes sense to go back, I'm looking for the unhooker, not the unhookie. But if the unhookie is the one standing there right out in the open, well, you're not giving me a lot of choice, friend.
---
Except when the gate spawns suck and the killer can easily see you. Pumped to see how the demogorgon will pressure gates.
---
Sick deflect nerd. I think a lot of us want to know your rank because only a casual with little experience would champion GF as unbalanced with little to no counter-play. He is diet Myers for fucks sake. GLHF hope i never get matched with you.
---
I know i‚Äôm biased, obvi you can tell by the flair, but two perks that are good in general pretty much allow you to counter the spirit, spine chill lets u know if she‚Äôs looking at you, EXTREMELY helpful in chases and figuring out where she is going/weather or not she is faking. And with iron will she cant hear injured survivors. So like I get the ¬´¬†it shouldn‚Äôt  take two perk slots to counter a killer¬†¬ª these are two perks that honestly are just good against all killers, with the slight exception of tier 1 Michael not setting off spine chill, and some killers running stridor, which sadly is popular with spirits
---
I be doing that third one lol
---
It was cool but you'd feel like you were doing pretty good and then bam, they're done. His style was too slow and dependent on getting the ball rolling enough to have it work at the end for blood warden. 
---
It was fun but you had to go in expecting to lose lol
---
I hope dedicated servers are coming with this update. They felt flawless IMO
---
In that video he downed the people he marked very early into chases, resulting in him being able to switch targets. This is due to him being able to abuse the 99 mechanic, which my point revolves around. It's so easy to snow ball it into just getting free downs back to back.
---
Pig shouldn't be that smelly. Its just an human female with a mask.
---
* Screenshots highlighting common UI bugs and/or glitches, e.g. bugged Devotion EXP gain, massive amount of negative bloodpoints, not being able to escape, ... .
---
Can't wait
---
It wasn‚Äôt pointless. It was pretty damn relatable. Just as relatable as two people finding the Myers meme funny on reddit I found his outlook on the Myers meme relatable. Saying his views are pointless while at the same time saying there‚Äôs no point in critiquing people‚Äôs views? What in the hell?
---
This makes a lot of sence, wtf
---
I'm a rank 3 survivor, I prefer a stealthy playstyle, and lockers are Lifesavers. I still do gens and help the team but I'm not very good at chases, and using lockers to get out of situations where the killer would spot you shouldn't be considered "noobish".

I miss him in a way that I feel like if I played one or two games as old Freddy I'd be totally set for like, 8-12 months.an ultra rare add on to do it would be cool but I miss it like Eggnog. I don't actually need a lot

But Ive seen many posts vriticising Dwight
---
Go watch an int4r3ct video and show me how he's bad against groups, go ahead, go watch him play ghost face and show me where the struggle is.
---
Well I'm looking for a game where I put up a lot of pressure which is why I first gravitated to Billy and I've got a good chunk of good teachables so I think I might go Freddy
---
Honestly anything that‚Äôs new or an extra layer of thought into the original joke is better than just the exact same thing every time.
---
Hoping so, too.  I haven't played in months because I had to downgrade my Internet speed and despite being a killer main, I really don't *like* torturing people.  Heh.

&gt; in a day or two

Do you have no job?

Could be freshly butchered, hygiene is very important

I just miss running Z blocks and catching ppl off guard by the quick dream transition :)
---
holy shit that made me jump
---
Exactly, did that with Ghostface for a bit but then everyone got good against him making him so much worse then he seemed and I feel the demogorgon will go down that exact road. be good for a few weeks then just become a punching bag to Survivors
---
I've played against the same guy like a year ago

its allways down here

---
If you like Wraith for the stealth, but don't like announcing your presence every time you show up to a gen, try buying Ghost Face or Freddy.
---
Ghost Face is perfect for those stealth plays, especially because you can land a lot of one-hit downs if you're stealthy.
---
Freddy is stealthy in the dream world, because his terror radius (the heartbeat) is replaced by a lullaby, and it doesn't get louder/softer, meaning survivors have no idea how close you are (they know if they're in the terror radius or not, but that's it). You can occasionally catch unsuspecting survivors trying to watch for you in the wrong direction. Not as stealthy as Ghost Face mind you, but I think he's in a better spot mechanically
---
Exactly but it was so much damn fun to use I really really miss old Freddy because of how fun he was because if you were playing him you were expecting to lose so you could just mess around.
---
Does anyone slug no mither?

üóø
---
"promoted hard tunnelling" that everyone knows about and can work against from the very beginning of the game instead of hard tunneling noone knows about or can work against because thats my survivor gameplay.
---
"free win when it went off" ... Im not even quite sure where to begin with that statement ... holy moly Dying Light is in no way shape or form a "free win" on its own. I admit it might be really strong if used in conjunction with Hex Ruin and other stall perks but thats by no means the fault of Dying Light ... Better slow the game down without doing anything instead of actually working towards your slowdown wincondition amiright ...

So your survey with under 50 votes (which we dont mention because why would we) that put Dying Light on the 7th place (that means 6 whole Perks are worse than it (gotta mention that since you obviously dont know how numbers work considering " Dying Light was in the top 5 for worst perks overall") makes me factually and objectively wrong ... spare me with your bs pls.

3k hours, Agi IG LF. I see how you roll.

This is the proper way to derank

I got BBQ when it was last in the shrine, I‚Äôve never been more relieved
---
Pertisged
---
What's Franklin?
---
Not at all
---
Well, by bubba do you mean the clown? If so. His bottles make survivors slow. There ya go for him. I don't play wraith, but the ones I've seen where they cloak and uncloak fast with no noise could be something. If not then bloodlust will solve the problem. Purge? Never heard of that killer. But the plague on the other hand. Rely on her shit she spits out to break a survivor. Then bloodlust for the kill. And ghostface, I'd have to say, I got nothing for him. Cause he's easily countered. But you can see where I'm going with some of the more useless killers. Cause bloodlust is amazing. Plus if you don't break the pallets that you're being looped with or if you respect them. You're gonna get nowhere.
---
Yes please
---
borderlands 3 comes out in april tho
---
David King‚Äôs ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna live forever‚Äù perk is your best bet. As far as BP gain it gives an increase equivalent to barbecue and chili. However as others have said, killer is generally more lucrative regardless.
---
This takes low effort to a whole new level lol.
---
Wait, what if I don't have a TV *or* a controller??
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Wow Trapper and Feng Min look really different here.
---
Wglf and prove thyself, and deliverance. WGLF is exactly like BBQ making it great for BP, prove thyself just fill up the objective bar faster, deliverance grant survival bloodpoints which is the hardest to gain BP in so unhooking yourself grant 1500 in survival and escaping puts 5000 in the category. That's the best way to gain bp
---
I REALLY wish I had the will power not to spend them, but I recently started playing and I'm only rank 9 so far with a few survivors almost at level 50 for the first time. hopefully will be able to save up in the future.
---
... Fuck swf, fuck nurse, fuck ruin, fuck this game I guess.
---
Now this is the content I come here for
---
My hag is still at level 1, but I'll try her out for a match to see how things will pan out.
---
I did Dwight because he's my boy (and I wanted to do a pizzagram) but, naw, the rest of the survivors aren't visually interesting enough for me - plus after ~16 killers I'm sure I'll be burnt out on this series
---
You should only play one laugh and randomize it every time you press the button instead of playing all laughs one after the other.
---
Region?
---
I get a lot of lag but I‚Äôm in the UK and often matched with killers hosting from Russia, Ukraine etc
---
This is most of the DBD memes if we're being honest.
---
It comes out on 9/13 and now BHVR is dropping DLC 9/17.
---
She put me down to mori me. Standing over me had just barelt started the animation, friend threw a fire cracker, she saw the killer blind notif in the left side, the mori on me stopped, meybe because thebgame was crashing, then the entire game crashed. 
---
We tried to replicate it a couple more times in game and in KYF, but couldn't.  Know idea what or how.
---
Would Demogorgon smell like rotten flowers? Rotten meat like a Venus fly trap?
---
Ace and Ash just seduce the female killers instead of actually getting killed.
---
Nice, now I know to check there.
---
Yup. Why else would it have happened if it wasn‚Äôt a glitch, spongebob me boy? Argargarg!
---
Wait, you can bleed out in this game? How does that work?
---
Lery's or pantry by far. Both I feel I get lost in way to easy and the totem placement is either predictable or incredibly insane
---
YEEEEESSS
---
I was on spirit's map and I was behind those tiny stone walls, literally stared directly at him breaking a gen and it didn't even make a sound. But I went behind the rock and looked over the rock, IT FUCKING BREAKS HIM OUT. Like all the times I've been exposed, it has been a GF just stalking me mid chase or a GF popping his 99 on me and me trying to loop a killer with no terror radius, blood stain, and I'm at an unsafe pallet with nothing to do other than hope that I stun so I can book it to a nearby T-wall or jungle gym. 
---
Very very very few times has a ghost face stalked me till exposure at a gen, then came after me, it's always just 99 and pop later. The only reason why I believe he can be better than myers at times is cause he can 99 everyone, resulting in a tier 3 that can be activated individually with timer that is arguably way too long.
---
I MATCHED WITH A RANK 6 PRAYER BEADS SPIRIT AS A RANK 20 SURVIVOR TEAM
---
same tho, keeping my fingers crossed that they are able to do it without any legal issues.
---
demogorgon smells like a really weird puppy
---
Makes sense. *returns to closet bowing to shrine* I'm sorry my lord....he died for our gens :,(
---
Whaaaat, how did the firecracker stop a mori
---
[https://youtu.be/j2K8SILr3ls](https://youtu.be/j2K8SILr3ls)
---
no, it comes out in april
---
Sure. Im not saying that Dying Light is going to be weak or anything, Im certainly going to try it out but that doesnt change the fact that they plan on removing the way I enjoyed playing their game instead of creating a new perk or just nerfing Dying Light in a reasonable way.
---
Like pretty much everyone else here, I really miss old Freddy. New Freddy is ridiculously powerful (all hail dream pallets!), but it was so much fun (and powerful imo) to have near-permanent aura reading. Everyone talks about Doctor being the best tracking killer, but he couldn't hold a candle next to Freddy's all-knowing wallhacks. Coupled with M&amp;A, he was basically a scratched mirror Myers.
---
Was it annoying to have constant skill checks popping off and interrupting your power? Sure. Was it frustrating to watch someone get unhooked right in front of you, knowing you can't touch them right away? Sure, but with Borrowed Time being so strongly in the meta right now that doesn't really change much. Was it so satisfying to watch someone fall asleep right in front of you, powering through the gen, hoping to get a skill check and ignore you? Immensely.
---
He definitely could be bullied by SWF and high-ranked players, but old Freddy was magical. I really like the rework, and I think he's in a much better spot right now, but old Freddy was my all-time favourite killer, and I'm really going to miss him
---
Because bugs.
---
Who the fuck plays borderlands on PC‚ò†üòÇüòÇ
---
Using FACTS and LOGIC too
---
Yeah, I call the clown bobert. So I had thought that was just a similar name. My b. Lol
---
who the fuck plays shooters with a controller?
---
Micheal
---
Because of the evil magic voodoo trying to scare them away
---
The Huntress DLC is free on all platforms. I play on xbox too and got it for free, you just had to download it if it wasn‚Äôt already in your game.
---
Almost everyone by the sounds of this
---
Oh god dammit lol, I love this. I adore SU and actually have been playing this song on loop ;D haha
---
It really do be like this though, matchmaking can be balls. You can always just kind of tell when you're against someone new.   
---
As a survivor I try not to go super hamtaro and usually just go for one maybe two loops, hoping they see how I run the loop and attempt to counter it. then I let them bap my face, not by standing still, just doing more obvious movement or avoiding going to the next loop altogether. 
---
As killer I just kinda eat pallets and let survivors do their thang. This one time I was in chase with a dwight and he quickly turned a corner at a jungle gym loop then tried slowly getting into a locker. Super cute. Was like "Awe, okay little Dweet, I lost ya" He was rank 20, hope he had a good time.   
---
 **TL**;**DR** Nurture new players! Don't spank their faces!
---
Nice !
---
Lucky. Also happy cake day!
---
We played against someone called the basement police once, three of us died trying to get the item from there. We even managed to take it out of the basement
---
^ This + open the gate when you are the only one left in the match to get 1.5k Survival points for "Release"
---
I think you have could escape if you did not misclick with recovering !!

---
How dare you
---
Dbd doesn't have super amazing graphics to begin with. They're good but to expect tattoos on a character to be crisp is kinda silly
---
I usually don't play basic m1 killers. But I'd have to say yes. But again it is all on whoever is better with said killer. And it also matters with perks as well.
---
I bet Susie smells pretty good. Strawberries is what i'd like to think.
---
Kind of tragic if u ask me but thanks
---
I agree. I've spent many sleepless nights thinking about that misclick. It haunts me.
---
And you know what they say, 4 teabagging  the moried is better than only 3
---
And I just can't hide it.
---
Spaghetti code is an understatement
---
Would you please explain to me why you would downvote me?
---
I think saying he overreacted is an understatement. yes, it sucks to be mori'd, but it's definitely not worth that kind of rage. I personally think he needs to go speak with someone if he gets that mad and ends several years worth of friendship over a game (over one round of a game at that.)
---
something something demogorgon
---
Dang
---
Obviously youre biased towards no tattoos so why make the post.
---
You answered your own question
---
Honestly I didn't hate spirit until I hit red ranks. Idk if it's because spirits got better or because some nights you only ever VS spirit. (and in general people are more toxic at red)
---
I miss Old Freddy but I get why he was reworked. Both because played conventionally (Chase one survivor at a time) he was abysmal, and he was unfun to play against (Mainly the "Freddy always knows where you are" aspect making him nearly impossible to disengage from in a chase. A "Tunnel Freddy" could literally chase you forever).
---
I miss Old Freddy because his stall and tracking made me feel right at home as a Doctor main. I miss the really stupid builds like Paint Brush + Z-Block + M&amp;A 3-second transition 0 TR "Ninja Freddy" or STBFL + PWYF + M&amp;A + Rancor "One Punch Freddy". 
---
Like I semi-mained Old Freddy. IMHO the rework made him better but I miss the old one. 
---
IMHO Old Freddy was better than Legion, Leatherface, and Wraith. He wasn't the worst killer in DBD but he definitely was no nurse or hillbilly.
---
Aah the Basement Guard I've come across many a times, From all the chest on the map the basement chest is off limit.
---
This basement chest becomes my object of obsession from which I know the Basement Guard wont give up , but me neither one day i'll succeed.
---
Serious question: I thought I couldn‚Äôt heal in a locker. On my PS4, I feel like I‚Äôve tried using R2 with a med kit or R1 when I‚Äôm Claudette, and nothing happened. Is there a self-healing perk I‚Äôm missing?
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
FUCKING WHEN?
---
Art is art, and if it‚Äôs not your body why do you care? 
---
Also dbd graphics are shit you expect them to have clean tattoo lines ?
---
Yes, brand new with stranger things update
---
If he and his friend crashed then they have no idea if the others did
---
Yes, thanks for sharing this. I‚Äôll need to be more alert from now on.
---
I think we did a pretty good job cit
---
This absolutely helps me, thank you.
---
If it doesn't rely on pallets, like the killer shack. Then just keep in mind with I've said. Except the double back part and you're good. (doubling back in killer shack has never gone well cause survivors can see you practically everywhere there.)
---
Reasons why I look for ruin
---
\- Im bored
---
\- The games laggy so I cant hit perfect 
---
\- Someone pointed at something and then took my gen spot
---
\- I was running towards a gen and found a ***lit*** totem ( remember lads, if it glows, it goes )
---
Ooh, what was the Wake Up bug 1.0?
---
Borderlands 3 pre-order gang rise up
---
Laugh in console
---
My favorite is when survivors try to pallet stun me. I just stop and throw a hatchet into their face. 
---
PSA: unless you are very good at ducking under the high end of the pallet immediately after dropping it or know with 100% certainty that Huntress has no hatchets left, don't drop a pallet on her. Any Huntress worth her salt will take a step back and hit you while you're still in the animation or just after it ends.
---
Hot damn! And that should hit PS4 in September, right?
---
That's when I teabag in the middle of the animation

You know how there is a boost to open gates much faster? Now imagine applying that boost to literally everything, including gens.
---
This, right here, is the correct answer

Sauce?
---
Not really. I didn't see their behavior as toxic.
---
Also, since I‚Äôm here, sometimes I feel like my direction when running changes and/or puts me back in time a few seconds. Is this some killer perk or am I just experiencing a lag or other connectivity issue?
---
Going to be pretty disappointed, doubt there will be anything till the end of next month since they like to say in advance when they‚Äôre having one.
---
Just create a new object (with it's own physics) that follows the x,y,z coordinates of the parent object. Delete the "3rd party" object when Feng dies
---
this hurt me to read
---
I am a Plague main and I will be completely honest with you.....She‚Äôs very mediocre. All her perks and abilities sound good on paper but don‚Äôt add up in practice. Survivors make playing her boring because they don‚Äôt cleanse so you‚Äôre just a T3 Myers the whole game without the extra lunge and vault speed. Also like I said earlier her perks aren‚Äôt that great. At least Clown has PGTW, Leatherface has BBQ, Legion has Discordance. All of Plague perks are meh, they‚Äôre not bad but they‚Äôre not great either. I also felt like she just got overshadowed by Ash dlc. Seems like the devs don‚Äôt care about her either. It‚Äôs sad because I actually enjoy playing her and she‚Äôs probably the most unique killer in the game. But at this point she‚Äôs pretty much the unicorn of DBD.
---
1. SWF is the only way to enjoy high rank survivor. 2.yea fuck nurse. 3. Ruin is mandatory
---
Yea, the problem is the ones who take advantage of the matchmaking exploit because they can't troll the red rank nurses and spirits. Its the worst when you are actually doing well against them and they dc.
---
You forgot about the other 3 meta perks
---
I've managed to fix it now, my routers power cable was unplugged by the tiniest bit, doubled my Internet speed and its working fine
---
That IS a nerf. You are telling me a offering that gets rid of the only counter to bloodlust is not a buff? It's going to be spammed at high ranks.
---
That gives me a little more time with Borderlands 3 thankfully
---
Idk man it was just my assumption. I don't watch superhero movies
---
Not enough percent. You need 100 oof
---
Did i say i did? No because people who just comment because they want down votes wont get any from me lol
---
what they were saying at the beginning of the clip was pretty dickish i thought
---
I don't understand?
---
It could be abused. It‚Äôs just about buying the right things.
---
Has there been any reports of bans coming through because of these? I really want to use them but don't want my steam getting fucked
---
Its gonna be spammed at high ranks like hook length offerings are spammed by survivors vro. My experience has seen that put out more than most offerings that help survivors
---
DAMN BROKEN MATCHMAKING!!
---
We make fun of people constantly hidding in lockers while using Dwight. Its just a meme. We all love him &lt;3
---
She's got the yams
---
If you gave him pants he might even make a good first impression for his job interview.
---
I try to do this as well. I‚Äôm not a toxic killer or hardcore by any means, and I‚Äôm a pretty low-rank, but after getting toxic SwF every other game where I try to play fair, even when I don‚Äôt tunnel and camp them despite the opportunity presenting itself, it gets to the point where I understand why others do it to a degree. The thing is, the survivors don‚Äôt take it easy on us killers at all. They cleanse our totems and gen-rush, so it gets to the point where we shouldn‚Äôt pity them anymore either, especially when they get over cocky and toxic. Though I still will probably be too nice and pretend not to see someone when they‚Äôre barely hiding behind a rock or slipping into a locker. I can‚Äôt help it
---
Proxy camp meta.
---
Aahahha damn üòÇüëè These are the kind of videos that make my whole day. Wait no my whole week. Damn you good. You play dlc? üòÇüëè
---
Are you joking? Removing a few hooks does jack shit when they spawn super close to each other. Other then hook offerings what do survivors have? Luck? That's it. While killers legit have a offering that's REMOVES PLAYERS FROM THE GAME
---
Just kinda sad. I miss him. He was my best killer, I did not consider him a bad killer like 90% of the community, and I really enjoyed playing as him. His playstyle was unique. I played him as an ambush killer. I dislike new freddy now. Going against him feels cheap to me, it's kinda just "is this pallet real or not" which can decide the fate of your chase. I do enjoy some of the new animations that came with new freddy though.
---
Next Tuesday.
---
Glad it is solved! Enjoy the games!
---
Honestly, I fully agree. I've been in the subreddit since right before Spirit's release, and maybe the first few times, I found it enjoyable the first few times, but its been almost like, a year now, and my god, its just not even enjoyable. It feels like its just spammed for easy karma.
---
I‚Äôm in love with her, please, step off my woman.
---
why people save bloodpoints
---
just spend 'em mate
---
Makes sense
---
I honestly can't wait for Ghostface
---
Alright? Great talk dude?
---
I just can't wait for Adept Shape not to be as bad now that all the perks will actually compliment each other and not just encourage tunneling.
---
You forgot about the plag with a nurse skin and the nurse with a plag skin
---
It doesnt remove them anymore, it puts distance between them, and since killers rarely put iron grasp, that becomes a huge problem. Survivors have amazing perks, instablind flashlights, brand new parts, insta heal medkits, etc. we have one insanely broken mori that does need to be fixed in some way, but even then, survivors have way more things that save their asses than killers do.
---
Not enough survivors found.
---
It's a nice first montage, but got repetetive really fast and I wasn't a fan of music, the effects are cool, and the tumbnail could use some work but I hope you keep making more because the more you do, the better you'll get
---
good luck
---
Pie chart way more cryptic than needs to be
---
I understood that reference
---
Dang imagine down voting someone
---
Two portals on each gate, I saw a streamer do it and it was intense.
---
Yes there was a blue suit Jane too, lmao! Gg dude!
---
Its amazing how you point out all the shit that was nerfed. Its almost like survivors were and still are too strong and unbalance the game or something
---
I wish they'd just raise the cap. I'd love to save enough to just get to P3 from level 1.
---
Even if you play tryhard-trapper, just claim it was "just for the daily" in the end, if everything goes wrong. EZ
---
I rock this coat, the boar tusk axe, and the Chinese wolf mask.
---
Yes, that would do well.
---
You need pallets to break bloodlust
---
No mither should have you start healthy and the killer shouldn't know if you're broken from it
---
I think that's too much, up to P1 would be ideal.
---
I run 4 man Dwight squad with my mates and it's beautiful
---
we all go "trucker Dwight" with the left 4 dead cosmetics
---
Thank you! I‚Äôll be sure to keep those in my upcoming montage videos
---
Do gens.  Hide.  
---
Open gate.
---
Leave.
---
Also, since when has franklins been meta? Never seen one killer use it when i play survivor. Ruin isnt even strong, good survivors can just power through it with no problem, not to mention how shit totem placements are. Discordance literally just tells a killer that two people are/were working on a gen,
---
Of course I pointed out how many times survivors got nerfed. You tried using a dumb argument so I presented a counter argument.
---
Listen very closely. Survivors are not broken. There is just to big of a divide between Nurse and spirit and the rest of the killers.
---
Since you're fresh to the game itll take a little bit to learn maps and killer specs (perks, abilities, counters, etc.) and what survivor perks best mesh with your play style.
---
I browsed YouTube videos (Otz is my favorite content producer. Hes like a very friendly, helpful teacher that wants you to succeed). Browse some of those videos, and with muscle memory practice you'll get the hang of it fairly quickly.
---
Amanda and Demogorgon laugh in the distance.
---
M‚Äôobsession
---
Joker voice: is there a difference?
---
The Fem-ogorgon has entered the group chat.
---
Agreed
---
Both are balanced, it‚Äôs just that NOED rewards poor play and Adrenaline rewards good play.
---
I agree on the music, there's no need for music that has lyrics. Maybe use a generic electronic sounding song or otherwise "funny" music if you want that vibe
---
Yellow and red should be swaped to make it clearer
---
Why is that too much?
---
I still want shirtless Myers because he's sexy as fuck
---
We live in a society.
---
[BOTTOM TEXT]
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the question is If one is glitched or there both glitched
---
is there a particular reason they need to take it off of console but not pc?
---
This is really cool. Dig the arstyle.
---
But they'll check to, low ranks will just leave thinking you're some kind of magician
---
You can't open the door as killer right?
---
Eventually gens are being done way too fast for you to recover. You can only chase 1 dude, and you can‚Äôt just teleport from one gen to another across the map (Spirit lul). You need to learn when to rotate and when to commit
---
Nurse and spirit do need a nerf, but survivors still need more nerfs, mainly to gen speed. Even perks designed to stop that barely help. It really doesnt surprise me that a dude named nea main thinks survivors arent broken anymore. They still are, they‚Äôre still too strong to be in an asymetrical game like this
---
Well because all of the things you'd spend the BP on to get to level 50 would be destroyed in the process. The whole point is to use the things you get in the grind to grind more, after all.
---
Pc/laptop
---
Discoudance gives the killer a shit ton of info, ruin is strong. You're argument is "Survivors are OP bc they are good enough to work through my perk" be honest. How many people do you actually see at high ranks working through ruin effectively.
---
He is *likely* to be very soon
---
She looks like someone that uses voodoo...
---
Kindred will be useless that way, so yes.
---
What I allways recomend for montages is gaming music, Nintendo music is fantastic for dbd montages because it's fast paced!
---
I used to literally urban evade 24/7 as a rank 15. Miss me with that shit, it‚Äôs all about them chases at rank 1 now
---
Thank you for your honest feedback. It helps a lot. I‚Äôll be sure to include more clips in my next videos so it‚Äôs not so repetitive. I‚Äôll figure out how to make those other things better too
---
Yeah I think they said it would happen in August or near the end of summer so more than likely we will be getting dcs with the ST Dlc/update
---
I never said survivors didn't need nerfs in gen speed. Gen speed should be slower I agree. But nerfing pallets is like saying "rEMOve sWf". It's moronic.
---
Thats like 3 killer games
---
How did it get nerfed
---
I've met that guy before. I was the only who escaped, because I didn't go looking for trouble.
---
Might be a silly question but can this be preordered? Been playing since Ghostface
---
Aight dope, I know fucking with the files gets various stuff salty, but I also know EAC is stupid as hell lmfao 
---
As long as its just the icons/portraits then it should be fine correct? Just makin double sure lol
---
Nah I want the dying light rework
---
Alot. Not that hard for 2 gens to be completed through my ruin while i chase one competent looper, my argument is that ruin does jack shit to good players, and bad players can just find the totem with no problem and go back to barely passing skill checks. It has no impact on the game
---
Couldn‚Äôt login the past three months? Geez, when‚Äôs the most recent you tried?
---
About $11.99 (Usd) I think someone else said 12.99 for canada
---
I usually sub blood warden but for a hyper end game focused build
---
Hangman's Trick, Franklin's Demise, Bond, and Small Game.
---
Hangman's is just a lot of fun. You haven't lived until you Sacrifice all 4 Survivors on the same hook.
---
Franklin's is really helpful for denying toxic item usage. It's not perfect but it really does help.
---
I don't like sandbagging my teammates and I do like working with them. Bond helps me do both.
---
I feel naked with Small Game. It helps SO much against Ruin, NOED, Pallet Freddy, Hag, and Trapper. All of which I dislike facing.
---
They said it was delayed but im sure by then we should get some info
---
I have perk icon with that pose! (not made by me, someone sent it to me and Im not on my pc atm so cant link it sry!)
---
Prove theyself GOAT perk. Bloodpoint gain and fast gen progression
---
I‚Äôm surprised how many people are okay with adrenaline that perk is soo good and doesn‚Äôt counter play unlike noed. But I suppose there both in a decent spot
---
Yeah it'll be after the 24th at least i think. If they wait until then they can include the Switch players.
---
Uh most of the survs are covered in dirt
---
* When you pallet stun the Killer, Crouch rapidly in front of him.
---
* If using a flashlight, don't forget to spam click it when the Killer is close, it might scare him away.
---
* If you manage to escape, always wait for the Killer at the exit gate and crouch rapidly when he is close. It means "gg" and its disrespectfull not to say gg.
---
* If the Killer downs you, just quit the game. No need to waste time if you are already losing.
---
I honestly wish there was more gore, it would make getting morid feel a lot more visceral, like when you get a cinematic death in Dead Space
---
You can hear the basement chest being opened from above the basement.   So if a killer was close, they would know someone is opening the basement chest, and bee-line to the basement.
---
¬∞ There are different Youtubers that show how to loop and extend the chase more like OhToFu (I believe)
---
¬∞ If you know someone that plays the game ask them to do a kyf's lobby as this allows you to practice easier with different perks and find what works best for you. What do you play on? Depending on your answer I might be able to help more. 
---
¬∞ Along with the point above choose perks that complement your play style. Not very good at loosing the killer try something like iron will so they can't hear you injured. Prefer to do gens then get chased maybe something like bond or prove thyself to get them done faster and know when someone is near you.
---
Nope

Ill usually sit on the generator unless
---
I'm lagging
---
Theres multiple people and im missing my skill checks ( at which point I dip out to another gen )
---
I do not like that place.  
---
'tis cursed indeed.
---
&gt; It's ridiculous, but sometimes you simply don't get in enough chases, according to the game
---
If you understand how Chaser Emblem works, this would never be a problem. Is not even that hard to understand, you just need to hit survivors X amount of times.
---
Tankman: i'll fucking do it again
---
*uck you

I just want surge to be buffed back to 32 or even 30 meters. Id love it to replace ruin. But with it being only 24 it feels impossible and implausible to get more then one generator at a time. It may not be as good as ruin but it seems way more fun to use and thats what we want new perks for. To change up the game and make revamp the interest. Useing the same perks in fear of having all the gens done in less then four minutes past rank five gets really boring.
---
Yeah people are underrating Better Together. Most of the time as survivor you are on a generator if you arent getting chased. Showing that you‚Äôre on a generator to other survivors and then also seeing every survivor when someone goes down is SWF tier knowledge for solo players.
---
Best way to learn is through YouTube videos or Twitch streams if you're into that. You can also invest in some killer play time to better understand what they see. 
---
Orzdarva is very talented but focuses mostly on killer, there is some survivor games sprinkled in his channel though. 
---
Paulie Esther is very knowledgeable and wholesome to watch, he is pretty much exclusive survivor. 
---
FunGoose is one of the BEST at the game for both sides and I highly recommend his content if you want some advanced tips. (He also recently came out with a beginner's survivor guide)
---
Hybridpanda is also very good to watch for knowledge on the game, especially about perks and abilities.
---
So why exactly did you post "nerf pallets" instead of "nerf gens". I don't see much of a issue with nerfing gens as long as some tweaks are made to certain things.

Yeah but the thing is that I always use deja vu because I‚Äôm not that good at finding gens.
---
I was thinking about switching it with Urban evasion.
---
But do you think I should get Tenacity or wait a week for the next shrine?
---
A lot of people don't though. I'm not gonna go through all the offerings and items first, and then prestige. People who want to do that still have the option not to waste, those of us who do should have the option to. The offerings for 50%-75%-100% bonus for one category are garbage, it's a minuscule amount to even worry about.
---
**Yes yes yes yes yes**
---
# YES

Today I almost only got matched against bad survivors. I had to toy around with them and let them rescue each other just so the game could last longer. I only played 4 matches before i closed the game because it got too boring
---
People would be okay with it if they just made it an entire outfit, and not separated into different sections. It would be new, but it would also open more opportunities for cosmetics in the future along with it.

was just thinking about this outfit, needed reminder for the DEVS EHEM

Good spin on an overrused meme. Actually made me laugh
---
Because nerf gens has been around for so long but behavior hasnt done anything about it. Stands to reason they wouldnt pay attention to this either but i wanted to sorta kinda vent while offering a suggestion on how they could improve maps like lery‚Äôs for any killer because playing killers like billy on maps like that is just playing an m1 killer
---

No, not this weekend. Do it next weekend. Borderlands 3 is out this weekend.

how the fuck do people do that? I know that they can get your IP since they are all connected to you, but take down your internet?

* Screenshots highlighting unbalanced matchmaking (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
Devour hope. If you get it to 3 attacks without it being found it's easy to get up to 5 and of boy is that where the fun begins. There's nothing in this game that makes me feel more powerful than butchering a 4man SWF because they didn't worry about totems.
---
Oh okay I do play pc from time to time but primarily Xbox
---
But that's not a pallet issue, that's a map issue. Of course billy sucks on indoor maps, I main huntress I know the struggle. But it's part of the game, play around it. I can tell you that billy is much better on that map then huntress is.

The thing i like to do is just run all looting perks like plunder and ace in the hole i just need  pharmacy and then i can go loot crazy i also get lucky with medkits doing it i get insta heals like 3 out of 5 times and now i would get a medkit right away and test my luck for real
---
Legion?? These are amazing btw!! I saw your Nurse one before somewhere and was hoping to see more from you!!
---
Because that would fall within the perviews of your conundrums of philosophy
---
Would Freddy smell like sweat if his skin is all roasted? Unless it's Dwight's sweat from writhing about after being hauled across the map to the basement.
---
Not a newbie killer, just a really bad one, and I can feel this. Though on that rare occasion I see I sacrificed  rank 8 or 9 is is a huge sense of accomplishment. Even though it was likely a pity play on their part.
---
Legit before you ever bother troubleshooting anything technology related, try unplugging / plugging it back in again.
---
Like actually
---
*sniff* *sniff*
---
Is that a baby dweet I smell?
---
Wait, you can enter the hatch while downed?
---
Can we get a shirt but no trousers Myers?
---
NOED is for killer only and there is incentive to disable this by cleansing totems for tons of points and even more with upcoming perks. 
---
Adrenaline has absolutely zero drawbacks of any sort and doesn‚Äôt take anything other than survival to end of game to use. Also, if you‚Äôre exhausted it works regardless! LOL Baby Killer
---
No killer perk matches the strength of Adrenaline. 
---
NOED is fine, Adrenaline is a bit too strong.
---
Ya, like feetie pajama Dwight with a baby bonnet and binky
---
i think so but can‚Äôt be positive
---
Got 'eem!

I'm thinking eventually. I've done myself covered in blood for Quiet and body paint for other characters, so it's on the table. Might be a bit.

I love looping new killers for 3 gens without using any pallets

Power play haha. The worst feeling in the world is when the killer snatches you out of the air while your jumping in the hatch. Absolutely terrible haha

---
I HATE THE FACT THAT RUIN IS A STAPLE PERK
---
ITS OBVIOUSLY REQUIRED, BUT THE THING THAT SUCKS IS THAT THERES NO WAY TO LENGTHEN THE GAME WITHOUT HAVING TO ALTER MASSIVE PORTIONS OF THE GAME, IM TIRED OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH A PERK THAT PUNISHES ME HARDER FOR SCRATCHING MY NOSE, OR PLAYING IN A GAME THAT HAS YELLOW PING I WISH THEY WOULD TAKE SOME MORE TIME TO ADD MORE UNIQUE MAP MECHANICS THAT ALTER THE GAME
---
MAYBE THE INSANITORIUM HAS "SAFTEY SPRINKLERS" THAT ARE ELECTROCUTED AND KILL YOU UNLESS SOMEONE TAMPERS WITH A LEVER ON THE MAP SOMEWHERE TURNING THEM OFF AND MAKING THE EXIT GATES SAFE
---
MAYBE IN THE SWAMP YOU HAVE TO POWER THE GENS, THEN YOU HAVE TO TURN OFF THE FOGHORN OF THE SHIP OR SOMETHING TO PREVENT THE ENTITY FROM COMING
---
HAVE THE AUTOHAVEN WRECKERS HAVE A CAR SMASHER THAT WILL CAUSE INSANE AMOUNTS OF NOISE, OR THE KILLERS CAN DRAG SOMEONE IN AND THROW THEM IN AND TURN IT ON
---
MOTHERS DWELLING MIGHT HAVE ANIMALS ALONG THE OUTSKIRTS THAT WILL MAKE NOISE WHEN YOU RUN PAST THEM, WITH THE LARGER ONES GIVING LOUD NOISE NOTIFICATIONS 
---
WITH HAWKINS LAB THE LONGER YOU'RE IN THE GAME, THE MORE THE UPSIDE DOWN SPREADS, EVENTUALLY CORRUPTING THE ENTIRE LAB 
---
MAYBE AN ANCIENT RITUAL TAKING PLACE IN THE TEMPLE THAT THE KILLER CAN BRING DYING SURVIVORS TO IN ORDER TO POWER SOMETHING THAT MAKES THE ENTITY STRONGER, AND SURVIVORS CAN CLEANSE IT TO HALT THE RITUAL 
---
MAYBE HAVE SOME OF THE CARS IN THE PRESCHOOL HAVE MOTION ALARMS NEAR THEM THAT WILL FREAK THE HELL OUT IF YOU GO TOO CLOSE 
---
THIS GIVES SOME MAPS NEW AND INTERESTING MECHANICS TO BREAK UP THE MONOTONY AND GIVES MORE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN KILLER AND SURVIVORS 
---
YOU COULD EVEN LEAVE SOME OF THE EMPTIER MAPS WITH HOW IT IS CURRENTLY IN ORDER TO AVOID LOSING ALL OF THE OLD STUFF
---
Yep .
---
De-meow-gorgon?
---
People can‚Äôt hack in blood points on console, which is why there‚Äôs a cap. The game can‚Äôt detect BP hacking on pc, so it has a cap that takes away extra points instead.
---
Personally I prefer Botany Knowledge, since it assists with healing at anytime.
---
from what episode is this? I can't recall this character at all
---
We'll make It is probably the better option cause of just how much faster you heal than Botany, even though it is on a timer
---
I agree it comes out in April, fuck epic.
---
I also didn't care for the music at all. I didn't watch the entire video because of it. 
---
Personally, I enjoy montages that use funny voice edits and sound effects and better graphic edits. This one looks like it was made in windows media player. 
---
I don't know what you goal is here, but you should look at some of the more popular DVD montages and draw from those. You don't have to copy them, but get a sense of what's more popular. As it stands now this video is easily forgettable and I would not subscribe to your channel.

---
Huntress should absolutely be higher on the list. She hasn't looked after her hygiene since she was 8 at the very least.
---
Salty about EGS huh?
---
Lol your so toxic
---
Wha
---
Adrenaline does have a counterplay though. It's killing the survivor before the exits open.
---
I don't understand what the big problem is with Adrenaline. Survivors are basically running 3 perks for the whole game and then get rewarded for surviving till end game. I used to run the perk but took it off cause 90% of the time I didn't use it, cause I rarely got saved by Adrenaline mid chase. Killers have so many instadown perks/addons/powers in this game, why can't survivors have an instaheal as a reward for making it to the endgame?
---
To me the problem lies with gens being done too fast if you're not running Ruin. That's the real issue with the game, instead of fixing core issues the game has the devs release bandaid fixes with perks like Ruin and Bamboozle
---
Until recently i didn't know you could be blinded during Moris. Wonder if it has any use.
---
yea but that'd be pretty unfair to pc, also IIRC I think the cap was added because of how many people were idling with autoclickers to farm BP
---
Movie
---
I mean it takes up a perk slot u know wht im sayn
---
Both are balanced. However noed is like the most unfun perk in the game to go against and has too great of a variance for solo and swf.
---
Remove it on pc too. Or just increase it. I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôve gained the capability to detect it for over a year now. It‚Äôs not really needed.
---
A lot of people don't care about that, since a character doesn't feel "complete" until they are P3. The bloodpoint cap is an archaic holdover from the old infinite BP hacks, and serves no actual purpose.
---
We'll make it, it's a minute and a half of double heal speed at max rank
---
Lmao you sure are a good at dead by daylight advice.. newbies listen to this guy
---
I played strictly killer for a long time, and much of it as Myers. When I finally played survivor, the first game was in Haddonfield and me and another survivor we‚Äôre fixing a gen in the basement of one of the buildings. I‚Äôm scanning the camera around here and there and then it happens:
---
Behind the stairs. In a doorway. Myers. Halfway sticking out of the doorway just stalking. 
---
I almost died IRL.
---
Yeah and you don't chase someone who is able to waste your time for too long. Someone who drops every pallet is 100% worth the time investment because even a good looper needs a pallet every once in a while.
---
quality&gt;quantity
---
it's much better to record 100 hours of gameplay and use 5 minutes then to record 1000 hours and choose 80 hours
---
Use to be an insult that would start a war in Halo, now it starts sending mean messages between each other and chasing harder...oh how times have changed.
---
Demodog
---
Had a friend who used about 10 or so pallets on one side of the map. We couldn't get the last couple gens done because he took away all means of stopping the killer. We got bodied and he complained that he was better than the rest of us
---
You posted cringe bro, you are going to loose subscriber
---
My thought process is either, the killer will be busy chasing someone else/doing something else for the aura to matter or if they are coming, then they can run off and you get the killers attention.
---
Two questions: Double Bloodpoints when?
---
And how much is the DLC?
---
If I'm the last survivor remaining, I never go for the hatch unless I immediately hear it open near me. If I don't, I run for the closest exit door and wait. The killer will almost always close the hatch, which triggers the exit doors, and you'll have a 50/50 chance (depending on the killer and how fast they can get to you) to open the door and escape.
---
No, it isnt
---
Um. Flashlights?
---
At least in Halo it was over your dead body, not next to a pallet.
---
Ok
---
Why did he even disconnect, what the hell. He might‚Äôve gotten you all still because of Blood Warden.
---
Nice
---
I mean, that's pretty benign tbh. When I play killer idc if people struggle cause they need their points and I'd do the same. Idk
---
Legend
---
Perk and item load outs for 30-second **solo** generators (yes, is possible) even if the Killer is running Overcharge, Pop Goes the Weasel, Ruin, and Brutal Strength all at the same time ruin the game.
---
If you have a problem gen rushing the shit of a Killer and popping four out of five before their first chase even finishes (finding+chasing takes longer than 30, and even finding can take longer than 30) then you're running the wrong perks/items.
---
That's the punishment for playing any Killer, their map pressure is basically nonexistent - who are you going to use to take down all four survivors in 30 seconds?
---
Camping isn't going get a Killer anywhere, if they catch you before you've popped all five gens then maybe you played wrong, all you have to do is loop them for 60 seconds and then leave through the nearest exit gate.
---
I thought about that but then worried that if they see someone healing they'd go for them instead. I'd think with your aura showing you'd want to go the opposite way of the rescued person personally but try the build out, hope it works for ya!
---
It really is tho
---
What? I'm confused
---
He most likely has no scent due to being a dream demon.
---
It‚Äôs only 4%.  It makes you 119% speed, which isn‚Äôt that much.

---
Too good. Didn't chase long enough.
---
Ironically enough the killers that have the most problem with map pressure ARE the ones that run NOED.  They rarely play to create pressure since they know they can just insta down whoever they're chasing when last gen pops.  It creates the worst habits man.  They all have the worst decision making when it comes to pressuring gens and deciding when to commit or cut off a chase.
---
Can we just get a quick summary or something
---
Personally, I think "Toxic" behavior should be defined as purposely DC'ing, shit talking post game, purposely griefing/trolling others (sandbagging, hook farming, body blocking, things that can get you banned). Using flashlights, camping, all those things are in the game for a reason. There's perks to assist with camping.
---
Most of the things people think are "toxic", aren't. They suck, totally, and a lot of things are a dick move, but what I think "toxic" is and actually means is abusing the game system, harassing others, slinging around slurs, etc. That's just my opinion.
---
"Toxic" is a word that's really tossed around too much.
---
There is no counterplay to adrenaline lol unless your spirit/nurse and can end the game before the exit gates get powered (of course I‚Äôm talking about like the best level play not purple ranks)
---
What do you mean?
---
I saved 2/3 of my teammates when they were all downed and hooked in the same area (one suicided, so I didn‚Äôt get to him in time), and they let me die on my first hook.
---
Killer gave the last one hatch. FML.
---
Why not spectate?
---
No worries at all, it was removed for ya when I saw it. :)
---
THIS GAME IS PRETTY BORING WHEN IT PLAYS OUT THE EXACT SAME WAY AT HIGH RANKS
---
1. QUEUE INTO A 4 MAN SWF OR TWO PAIRS OF SWF
---
2. THEY NEVER SHOW THEIR FACE UNTIL THEY DID 4 GENS, UNLESS THEY MADE A MISTAKE
---
3. START RUNNING AROUND INFINITES AND ONLY DOWN ON PURPOSE SO THEIR FRIENDS WONT DEPIP
---
4. RINSE AND REPEAT EVERY FUCKING GAME
---
IT'S PRETTY ANNOYING HOW IF I DON'T RUN RUIN, THE GAME IS DECIDED BY SURVIVOR MISTAKES. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY SURVIVOR PERKS THAT FORGIVE THEM BEING NOT ONLY MECHANICALLY BAD BUT UNAWARE OF THE MAP WHILE A KILLER NEEDS TO MAINTAIN CONSTANT PRESSURE AND HAVE TO RUN THE SAME 3 PERKS OVER AND OVER AND HOPE ON A MISTAKE OR GOOD RNG OF GENS/TOTEM PLACEMENTS/BASEMENT PLACEMENT/NO MAP LOOPING RNG
---
Nicely done! Very clean lines.
---
It‚Äôs Santa clown that does, rather than regular Clown
---
It's an add on
---
Exactly what I‚Äôm thinking tho I imagine she does smell like mommy kink
---
Honestly people just don‚Äôt understand ableism yet. Imo it‚Äôs similar to older generations being comfortable using racial slurs without seeing the obvious problem with it. Hopefully at some point in the near future these people will grow up and realise that just because an insult isn‚Äôt aimed at them, it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not offensive.
---
It's an add on.
---
Oh yeah, it‚Äôs big brain time
---
Its an addon
---
I‚Äôm basing  power off of top level play
---
The devs don‚Äôt.
---
It seems nice, but the building is where I usually check for Ruin first.
---
It's a rare add-on called "Black Box". It means one survivor becomes the obsession. They start in the dream world, and absolutely cannot wake up the entire game- meaning you cannot interact with alarm clocks, other survivors cannot wake you, and failed skill checks do not work. Hope this helps. :)
---
Very neat concept. I‚Äôd love to see it in the game
---
This fucker's getting blocked.
---
How much did it cost?
---
Let people play with a fucking crutch if they're crippled damn dude all it's going to do against a remotely skilled team is net you one kill
---
‚ÄúPretty good job so far‚Äù
---
BK for medkits, WMI for without medkit
---
A 20% man I see
---
At least the pre-load has already begun them EPIC Store players got a 12Kb download volume they will need to wait until April to play!
---
No. You‚Äôll just whack them
---
Grinding out Survivor BP is painful. I have to use Prove Thyself and We're Gonna Live Forever just to get a decent amount each game. If I even get to use the perks.
---
Why is that too much? Why would 2 million be the right amount?
---
Yea seriously. A lot of people even spectate when playing solo
---
Because 2 Million gets you to prestige 1
---
I'm just waiting for the survivor mains who run inner strength for cheap heals get hit with iron maiden then come back on here like "OmG neRF iRoN MaiDeNn"
---
lol You're down voting me because I asked why it's too much. If you're fine with getting to P1, why not just allow to P3? There isn't a good reason for it not be allowed.
---
NOED IS STILL THE WORST PERK IN THE FUCKING GAME
---
Yes I agree but you balance it toward solo then set will stomp every killer. So in my opinion they might need to balance swf differently idk how but I feel it needs to be done
---
Even if doesn't have that player should go negative, fuck it.
---
As you inspect his teeth with your flashlight, you comment on how unhealthy his dental care is. Demogorgon recoils in embarrassment. Killer Stun +200
---
Oh, doing it just to waste time actually does seem pretty toxic. But yeah, I think doing it and downing the person is understandable.
---
*Entity sweats profusely*
---
Swamp queen!
---
Adrenaline is a top tier perk... but if your playing a viable killer and are good with that killer... then you shouldnt let that last gen pop.
---
Borrowed time is easily countered by stealth killers, aswell as simply ignoring the unhook, and hitting the rescuer.
---
Dead hard is a situationally powerful perk... the best way to counter it is predict the dead hard to the pallet, and go to the other side since they cant double back during the dead hard animation.
---
Balanced landing is another incredible perk but it's only useful on drops which demand maps, and areas of maps so it is situational... and also countered by ranged, speed, and lunge killers.
---
Decisive almost never comes to play, as it's super obvious they have it.... if someone hook dives with borrowed and you see the previously hooked get in a locker, it's obvious they want to decisive you... simply ignore them.
---
Their not terribly strong...
---
No more so than the best killer perks.
---
And that message is? Enlighten me...
---
Was he the one with the little noodles?
---
Unless you're really close, anywhere in the upper torso/head area works for all killers. It doesn't have to be really precise at all.
---
Why am i getting Mad Max vibes from this?  
---
My mind is stupid
---
Depends on your play-style. I personally focus my entire perk build on the concept. 
---
I would say that DH would be better than lithe in this case since you can‚Äôt guarantee a vault spot around the hook all the time.
---
Honestly whenever I know there's a hatch stand-off and I'm still on the hook, I'd always kill myself to secure the partly victory.
---
I also main Bill, and I make constant sacrifices, coincidence?
---
When you do that the beam should shatter of the fangs and his mouth should look like a 80's disco-ball!
---
Will do!

&gt; Dcing is pussy either way but for that it's hilarious
---
okay?
---
The Clown should be stonky supreme.
---
He farts in jars to yeet them at you.
---
Hey! Me too. I salute you fellow Bill Brethren
---
When all 4 survivors dc Spirit:üìà Stonks!
---
He walked in there like he owned the place
---
Certainly the latter.
---
***^(Its never gonna happen fam, let it go)***
---
It‚Äôs a pretty cool lay out for a penny wise killer that would be fucking super fun to play and super fun to play against but will also never be added to the game
---
You going to do offerings &amp; add-ons/items too?
---
That's pretty cool... and oppressive
---
Right?!
---
These look awesome!
---
Question- how do you even make these? Do you just make a copy of the image file and mess with it and put it back? I have no idea how it works lol.
---
So observe the survivors to learn to... well survive
---
Is it just my rank or do not enough people play Freddy? He‚Äôs fucking OP
---
The cold preserves the flesh. Duh.
---
I thought I was the only one who noticed. I get that it‚Äôs a meme but I think some people spam it to the point that it seems like they genuinely want it. I never personally found it funny but that‚Äôs just me.
---
Go ask Nurse then.
---
The Hulk at the top is from the past 2012, while Hulk at the bottom is present time 2018, from Avengers:Endgame. And yes, you're right. In the movie, the bottom Hulk is more Banner so he's in control, not always punching things. Using more of his brains than brawn. As you can see in the pictures, Hulk in present time is embarrassed by how his past-self has acted. So OP is trying to say that he's shamed/embarrassed by how he used to just hide in lockers all the time vs. now he actually reparis gen so escape. I probably spent way more time than necessary to explain this to you but I'm bored at the moment so... here you go.
---
Or he smells like bacon, hair gel, and aftershave.
---
What are custom's exactly?
---
Keep I'm mind I'm the console pleb here, don't be harsh.
---
Demo with a little hat and cane that dances and sings. HELLO MY BABY, HELLO MY HONEY!!
---
The only thing it really does is slow down your action speed and replace his terror radius with the lullaby. If the Freddy isn't running any hardcore repair/heal speed limiting addons, being asleep doesn't really matter much since the base penalty for actions isn't much. You can still easily escape while having it on. Depends on what other perks/addons they're running really. :)
---
Welcome to any competitive gaming bitch.
---
Yes yes noed bad because I die from it a lot
---
How much tho
---
I feel called out in the last tier...
---
Myers makes Demogorgon pudding
---
This should be how it works for real
---
The technology just isn't there yet
---
Demogorgon with glasses lmao
---
You probably haven't smelled a foul smell a human body that has not washed itself could make. It's definitely worse than axe spray.
---
That's not how it works at all. If you hack your bloodpoints over 1M, you get those bloodpoints - you just can't *gain* any bloodpoints (i.e. Have any added to your BP count) when you're at or above 1M BP.
---
Even just penalizing bloodpoints would be enough for most people.
---
With this in mind, Jane should have a Mori.
---
Even though this an old comment I agree also make them have to pay 10000 blood points to get a try at unhook to nerf the number of people who play survivor.
---
I wish the game still had pink perks it's lame seeing purple all the time on console
---
Yeah, this is losing a gen before I make it halfway across the map time.
---
When you hack in BP, once you spend it even one it sinks to a mil.
---
How about a Bubba Hotep skin?
---
Even if a surv has had their Adrenaline proc they can still get ganked by NOED so don't know how they can be considered balanced. NOED is clearly stronger.
---
Sounds fine by me
---
Cool, I have $22 on steam, I'll be able to pick up some auric cells, too.
---
and this is why i am trying to get iron maiden on all my killers imagine spending the time to heal  just to get exposed when you come out of that locker :)
---
Yeah, certain characters have some stereotypes. And they're mostly right. For some reason, Bill players are always nice.
---
Not exactly. It can be used every time you rescue someone. Also, its duration is long enough to heal other survivors occasionally.
---
Its probably just King Crimson
---
lol im so down
---
It‚Äôs probably just King Crimson
---
u/title2imagebot
---
I think we're forgetting about the truly overpower class, the scout. He simply runs faster than the killer.

You can report them after the game ends but i don't think something will happen to them.
---
We'll never give up, our utopia will be complete.
---
Doing nothing is an assurance your NOED will still pop.  Doing nothing means 3 survivors have to repair 5 gens themselves.  Not nearly as likely a scenario.  Typically you are earning your Adrenaline.  Your 5 second long and then it's gone forever Adrenaline.  How longs NOED haste and instadown effect last again when the totem activates?
---
Finally. Lithe, quck quiet, iron will and dance with me will be really fun to use :)
---
That's what I meant. We'll make it has a timer that starts each time you rescue someone, and resets if you rescue someone while the timer is on
---
I'll try agaisnt a nurse, but prayer beads spirit I'm not going to bother, it's not fun and I'd rather be in a different match
---
Please censor player names in the future! Thanks :D
---
No, it doesn't. How do you think BP refunds for lost playtime work? The devs themselves sometimes give you upwards of 1M. The hack I believe you're confusing this all with is the exploit for "infinite BP", where every time BP is spent, your BP count is set back to 1M.
---
Good mindgame
---
Lol!  Dude I routinely end my games with Trapper, Legion, Wraith, Pig, Plague, etc... with gens up.  Am I a God?  No it's called I don't run NOED so I actually put time into learning how to counter loops and apply gen pressure.  You NOED gamers are adorable with how impossible you find the game to play without it.
---
Solidarity with fellow lowbie.
---
Rancor as well. Was the unfortunate victim of that one time. Luckily they didn't catch me to use it.
---
Yuuuuuuuup.
---
I used to use We'll Make It, but I switched over to Botany Knowledge because of the added benefits and being able to use it at any time. You can really use either of them and do just fine, but the issue with We'll Make It is that in a lot of cases, your target will run the moment you unhook them and then it becomes a wild goose chase to get them to stay still long enough to heal.
---
Lose*
---
* Reporting is useless since trying to Kobe and then failing to press space is obviously intended gameplay. If they DCed then yes they might be in trouble eventually if they abuse that.
---
* I agree with these people that nurse/spirit gameplay is very unfun, so i can't blame them for DCing. I personally try anyways but its kinda a waste of time.
---
* Yes they will depip from this but most people rather be low rank anyways because u get less spirit and nurses.
---
Nah I get that. I just saying that it‚Äôs something people don‚Äôt think about as offensive because it‚Äôs such a ‚Äúcommon‚Äù edgy insult. But hey, you point out it‚Äôs an awful thing to say and suddenly you‚Äôre an SJW fun police freeze peach nazi.
---
If they are worried about clipping why don't they just put the hood down and give her a bunnie ear headband or something?
---
**Dweet
---
Ohhh I see now. It‚Äôs hard to see on mobile without zooming in.
---
yeah this seems to be the only way around it for right now. can be frustrating though when we don‚Äôt have the one extra to get us in a lobby though, so hopefully this is fixed with new servers ü§û
---
I‚Äôm already adding money to my ps wallet.
---
It just sets your BP to 1M every time you buy a node on the bloodweb, that way it looks like you always have 1M BP.
---
The root issues isn't "Killers are pussies", the root is issue is why would BHVR implement broken items in their games that totally break the balance. Using an Ebony Mori literally feels like a cheat code.
---
Hmm, then no, that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm thinking about.
---
If I had to guess, I'd say he'd be sooty from hanging around that boiler.
---
yeah, i wish they'd buff No Mither somehow. it's pretty good when you're running it in a squad, but running it on its own pretty much guarantees you'll never be left on the ground.
---
i know nothing about balance, so this might be too much of a buff, but changing it to something like - you start the game at full health, but once the killer hits you once, the broken status effect applies (but is not shown on the killer's HUD). you can still get yourself up from the ground whenever. that feels more viable than the tunnel city the perk currently is.
---
anything on price?
---
How do you hook a person with a flashlight?
---
Thanks for taking the dive and pointing it out.
---
There are people who have relatives or work with disabled people and hearing a term currently used in both medicine and academia as an insult is...disheartening
---
and it's pretty stupid, imo
---
I honestly don't know, since I haven't been in a match where it's happened. I'd like to know the answer to this too. Logically, it should swap out.
---
It pretty much destroys the purpose of the bloodweb though which is why it's not in the game.. 
---
Imagine I do one bloodweb trying to get a certain perk -&gt; I don't get it -&gt; I resell everything I got from the web -&gt; try again
---
Beta invite
---
Be a bitch and people will refuse to play.
---
I used to send the worst hatemail, now I RARELY send any
---
Im playing on xbox dummie
---
I dunno, I try to be a good teammate, but him? Him I let die on the hook.
---
&gt;Why do you need to use that combo?
---
They want an easy game. Even as someone who primarily plays Killer, as Survivor, I'll still suicide on hook or just flat out DC if the build just isn't any fun to play against, no remorse. If it's just Nurse, well, you can try to counter a good Nurse, but shit like Tombstone Myers, Cross Map Hag, Prayer Beads Spirit, NASCAR Billy, Insta-Down Hatchet Huntress, so on and so forth, that shit just bleeds the fun straight out of the game. 
---
I get that it's supposed to be fun for Killers, supposed to make for an easy game, but I feel like I'm wasting my time playing against these builds because the chance to win as Survivor against a competent Killer running specific add-ons just doesn't exist or are too minuscule to bother struggling against it. My goal is to make BP, and it's a lot of work for minimal BP to play against those kinds of builds, so I'll end it on hook early so I can move on the next match.
---
What the hell am I looking at
---
Alright imma head out
---
One day we maybe get dustin and his teachable perk "my little pony nerd"
---
Considering being AFK to derank is not bannable I see no reason this would be.
---
I think it was Not_queen stated end of summer is 09-21-19 but here in the USA is 09-23-19 and said they are sticking with the end of summer to launch dedicated servers but I bet it will be he PC crowd only and we console people will have to wait a few weeks so it will be the fall!
---
Jeez
---
Selling could be at reduced value though, even something like sell back for 10% of the bloodpoints back
---
12 USD
---
There's no penalty at all for being asleep in terms of action speed without addons. 
---
TBH with the removal of Freddy's aura reading and powerful stall Black Box is kinda useless, although to be fair Old Black Box was also pretty garbage besides the "Classic" Black Box + Dying Light + Mori "Tunnel Freddy" build.
---
u/ItzMisterMayhem I love how you pretended to hold a conversation for a few messages and only after like 6 messages decided to ask "Wait what do you mean"
---
lol
---
Oh my bad
---
Seriously. Disappointing to see someone play that badly. He could've just stood at the outer corner of the truck, and gotten him regardless of where he went. With NOED, all you need is that one tap, and you have your kill.
---
Heck, run the timer out in that position, since he would've been screwed either way if he'd just been more patient.
---
Except you still need to run his specific 3 perks only
---
Adrenaline doesn't get completely destroyed by a killer doing bones. Their strength isn't equal because noed can be hard countered by actually doing another objective other than doing gens.
---
cool cool!
---
Gonna get it right away!
---
Clearly both are balanced.  I play both but more killer.  Here‚Äôs the scoop:
---
NOED is a dual purpose perk.  It helps you secure a kill/put pressure on the end game, where killers have no built in pressure.  This has been a balance issue for awhile, with very niche perks benefiting it.  EGC is a nice way to add a little, but it is still in the survivor‚Äôs favor.  The other thing is it helps slow the game down, as survivors need to cleanse totems.  I know this gets bitched about but if every survivor cleanses 1 totem you‚Äôre 80% free of them.  Really not hard to do; I typically knock that out every match without going out of my way.
---
Now, Adrenaline allows survivors to shave off some time when gens are close by focusing on repairs instead of healing.  This is a nice little dual purpose use, because if I‚Äôm honest the speed boost is only useful if you are actively in the chase.  And that‚Äôs the thing with Adrenaline: unless you are the one survivor being chased when the last gen is powered (or currently hooked), it‚Äôs just a slight time boost because of the free heal.  The added exhaustion also ensures you can‚Äôt chain it into any of your other powerful chase perks.  Honestly, it‚Äôs a well-designed endgame perk.
---
The reason they both garner so much hate is they feel bad to be on the receiving end of because they circumvent one of the main features of the game of 2 hits=down.  Really though, they both can be played around, it just requires respecting them as known quantities which no one wants to because it flies in the face of the meta strategy.
---
tl;dr both perks are fine but no one likes getting styled on.
---
No worries
---
I'm just about back to my 1 mil
---
Good news, they're going to do that shortly after dedicated servers go up.
---
you're right and you *should* say it. sorry about your downvotes :/
---
If I didn't suck as killer I might be able to take Wraith to R1
---
This made my Nut shoot all acroos the Street. This is how Exited I am.
---
It‚Äôs dependent on context but in a majority of cases yes it‚Äôs disrespectful. 
---
With the exception of Ghostface photobombs ofc
---
Just providing you a stupid answer to your stupid question
---
It‚Äôs all part of the chapter 13 update so yes it will :)
---
Would the Spirit smell at all being she's a ghost?
---
Is the extra BP for any obsession perk cause if so there's finally a reson to play that perk where both killer and obsession see auras that never made sense to me why would you use that perk with no benifit to you
---
It is on console. Ps4 with each of the chapters on sale
---
Made with mematic
---
That's not how you should balance things that's like saying lightborn is good aginst flashlights so it's clearly stronger
---
Nah I'd laugh if someone t-bags my corpse
---
I love all of Michael's builds to be honest. If I see him tombstone someone it just raises the fear level especially when he starts chasing me.
---
Dude, every time a killer does bones it stops my adrenaline from proccing
---
I‚Äôm 69th comment no one else comment
---
Now I can't stop imagining them in a 3 piece suit.
---
[this](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1809314394) has them, all the way up to ghostface. not the stranger things chapter yet tho. :D

I feel bad for survivors bc I always do bones
---
Uhh u high? I get every killer at rank 1, cuz ranking is too ez.
---
I get this a fair bit. Sometimes I‚Äôll hook someone 3 times without hooking anyone else, not because I‚Äôm tunnelling, but because they are awful at evading. They‚Äôll self heal in my terror radius and complain that im tunneling when I have nurses on. They‚Äôll try gen rushing instead of healing and fail a skill check and complain that I‚Äôm tunneling. They‚Äôll hide in a locker not realising I can still hear them and a blood pool appears at the base of it. Usually I suspect it‚Äôs someone playing with their high rank friends.
---
Sad to hear about this, but I never had such problems and this is the first I saw having a bug. Care to try recreating this or at least make a full detail on how you purchased the skin to make this bug? I have some cells and shards that I can experiment on.
---
What‚Äôs this from?
---
Had an aneurism Reading the lore
---
Its why I run kindred on solo queue. Usually they aren‚Äôt toxic teammates, they just expect someone else to be nearer. I hardly ever get left on hook if I‚Äôm running kindred.
---
Then its working
---
I'd like Huntress in a Jason costume
---
The devs have addressed DCs as exploitation of the game. No matter if it's tactical or not, it's not allowed.
---
Another thing with both is that by using them, you are only able to use 3 perks until end game.
---
As killer I would much rather use a perk that helps me avoid getting to end game by killing all survivors first than use NOED. If I‚Äôm using Ruin then with NOED it would put me down to just 2 perks in mid game.
---
As survivor I‚Äôd much rather use a perk that helps me get to end game. Usually I‚Äôll be full health anyway after last gen so adrenaline is useless quite often.
---
Both perks are mid tier imo, but they‚Äôre just extremely annoying to be on the receiving end of, which is why they get so much hate.
---
Nice i like it cause I'm always the obsession lol
---
Is it free? Really!
---
How so?

Dead by comment√≤ italiano.

You play on pc? Out of the past 10 games, 3 of them were Billy, 4 of them were Nurse, 2 were Spirit, 1 was Myers. I haven't seen a Clown, Wraith, Legion, Doctor In a couple days now.

Okay the game shouldn‚Äôt be balanced of your green rank games my game but kinda adorable you think that way

Now it‚Äôs just a humanoid piranha plant...I like it

I‚Äôm probably just a salty boi but it‚Äôs a little redundant to call it King‚Äôs ‚ÄúIt‚Äù. It‚Äôd be like calling a ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù book Rowling‚Äôs ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù. There‚Äôs not really a need to clarify who wrote it because the works are so well known. It was a lame joke on my end at any rate, but that‚Äôs my forte.
---
Who says I was being sarcastic?
---
I believe so, but I'm not sure if you get some special reward if you but them with shards or cells
---
That‚Äôs sad man....
---
Yeah your right that‚Äôs why I said there both In a decent spot right now
---
It's just a question to find out what is considered Toxic Behavior since I haven't seen anyone else ask about it or even define it. Cool your jets, man.
---
I hope so. Some bugs are just unforgivable.
---
I had a generator not giving a signal when completed, and then Supernova exploding, blinding me for good 10+ seconds.
---
I suggest making any content that isn't this. It gets way too repetetive.

That being said, it's my opinion. Do what you want.
---
I could see the stranger things DLC come out with the Switch port! the only thing I'm worried about is the other licensed characters since I play as Laurie and really want the Halloween map and Micheal in this port.

I think it‚Äôs a good concept

Any other games: If someone tea-bags you, kill them no mercy.
---
Dead By Daylight: If your teabagged, consider it a blessing.
---
Huh.... The horror game is somehow the nice game.
---
I'm actually confirming this, because in COD or something I get super toxic and get banned. I scrolled through my old DBD messages and I was nicer to people. I complimented the killer even if I died.
---
Lol no flash light save attempted, just a big ‚Äúfuck this shit I‚Äôm out‚Äù lol
---
OK I'll finish the sentence it's a big.....
---
Bruh I think teabagging is hilarious. If a survivor teabags me it's their way of saying they outplayed me and I don't mind it
---
It's just for fun to see if people are greedy enough to go into the basement for a free item. If anyone comes down, they die/get camped. If you don't go down then you're safe (although sometimes killers won't commit to the role and will chase you even if you leave the basement). It's just sort of a roleplay thing for the sake of being silly/to see what sucker falls for it.
---
What a strange birthday gift

Well then, I'm still going to ask. Better I ask instead of being someone who is accidentally doing an asshole thing to a killer or survivor in game. Also I'm sure if you sort by Best or Hot instead of New, you might see less of these post. I'm pretty sure that's why I haven't any of these post.

I use tea-bags to honor them. I even go as far as visiting a dead hook just to honor them for helping me.

It makes me happy to know BHVR are looking at memes like this

Can confirm as well. I'm not quite rank 1, but me as a rank 6 should not be getting paired with rank 15s. I feel big sad every time.

I dont remember the names of the perks, but my footprints vanished sooner and loud actions no longer alerted my spot. So I would sprint burst away and just dash into a locker. Most killers would keep on going since...well I could sprint into a locker without making loud noises

Not a bad thing makes it feel like a kids book telling kids the ABCs of DBD A is for ash who‚Äôs perks are very bad B is for BULLSHIT WHO RUNS NOED?!??!

This is M E T A
---
Camping survivors.
---
The Huntress probably stinks of feet.
---
Sounds like you want a buff for legion, not slower gen progression. I feel like the speed of doing gens is about right personally. But I guess its a question of how often survivors should be getting killed, or escaping. Also I feel like people complaining about this sort of thing is anecdotal evidence unless you have a huge amount of time sunk into the game and play both sides. 
---
Have you tried running ruin or other slow the game down just a little bit perks?
---
&gt; that should hit PS4 in September
---
weird thing to say when it is september
---
Killer 
---
Plague 
---
Lemonade
---
I'll just hop back in the locker fool
---
Personally I like Ghostface, but that‚Äôs just my opinion
---
Buy ghostface. If you would like to buy Spirit and still have Ghostface, you can just save up iridescent shards to buy her.
---
Spirit for the wins, ghost face if you wanna tbag back the survivors.
---
He might have got away if he‚Äôd committed to unhook :(
---
They are under picnic tables in Lampkin Lane too
---
Hi, killer here to say I personally fucking despise the firecrackers. Killer out.
---
based on the answers, something about licensed killers not having extra cosmetics
---
Adam Francis and Jane Romero can be bought with iri shards
---
Honestly, it is understandable that they don't have extra cosmetics, but one thing I don't understand is making 1 cosmetic kroe expensive than the rest
---
He could look at the generator and just say "you coulda just flipped the power switch right there"

Cant doubt the truth with receipts
---
I just downvoted out of sheer horror
---
I hope that gore patch becomes a thing.
---
Yeah this is obvious bait seeing the username
---
By these changes,you would make these perks useless while they are already not that strong.There whole purpose is to fight against stealth killers,so with your changes these perks would become useless.
---
Just bring small game lol
---
No not baiting anything just being honest I do it all the time and don‚Äôt really see a problem with it but everyone hates it so I wanted to see if it was just when I kill them or if reddit also hates it
---
How  about shirtless trapper
---
Ehhh I gotta disagree with that respectfully. The ability to teleport anywhere on the map is far more powerful in my opinion, especially since you can see when a portal is being destroyed (even though it might take a bit longer) the fact that the demegorgon can lunge during a chase is far more advantageous at higher ranks in my opinion. 
---
Better versed survivors aren‚Äôt so immersive. The fact that Amanda slows down and makes a huge noice before pouncing are a huge give away. It‚Äôs much more difficult to dodge a pounce mid chase than when given a noise cue. This is exactly why the nurse is so OP at higher ranks as well. 
---
It‚Äôs like a mix between hag, pig and nurse imo and a very killer one at that. 
---
How many clowns you see in high rank games? Bubba even? Not many on my server. It‚Äôs billy, spirit, nurse and huntress all day.
---
Idk, why do killers dodge when they see toolboxes, SWF, or p3 skins? Why can't they at least try? 
---
The argument goes both ways. If killers can be selective about their matchups, I have every right to suicide/DC if I don't like my matchup either.
---
I agree. But also disagree.
---
Lol with what part how fun it is ?
---
It‚Äôs honestly the most fun I have as a killer beats running around a pallet just to get close enough for them to throw it down and run away to the pallet 10 feet away
---
Being toxic towards toxic people but not being toxic first.
---
oh my god this is amazing

"TUNNELING" SHOULD BE EXCLUSIVELY CONSIDERED AND DISCUSSED AS A SUBTOPIC OF CAMPING. IT DOES NOT MEAN "YOU KNOCKED ME DOWN AGAIN BEFORE I COULD HEAL." YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A TEAM AND I'M GOING TO TREAT YOU LIKE ONE. HEALING AT THE HOOK AND RESCUES FROM THE BASEMENT ARE DESIGNED TO BE RISKY FOR BOTH OF YOU. THE MERE THREAT OF BORROWED TIME AND DECISIVE STRIKE ARE OFTENTIMES ENOUGH TO DISCOURAGE A KILLER FROM GOING AFTER YOU AGAIN. AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT, I'M NOT GOING TO GO OUT OF MY WAY TO MAKE THE GAME MISERABLE FOR YOU. BUT IF I RUN INTO YOU AGAIN, I'M KNOCKING YOU DOWN AGAIN.  IF YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE UP THE BASEMENT STAIRS WHEN I REACH THE TOP, I'M KNOCKING YOU DOWN AGAIN. IF YOUR TEAMMATE UNHOOKS YOU--OR, EVEN BETTER, IF YOU UNHOOK YOURSELF WITH DELIVERANCE--AFTER I TAKE THREE STEPS TOWARDS THE FINAL GENERATOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP, I COME BACK, YOU'RE STILL STANDING THERE LIKE A DOPE WITH ONE-EIGHTH OF A HEAL TO YOUR NAME, I TAKE A SWING AT BOTH OF YOU, I KNOCK YOU DOWN AGAIN, I GO AFTER YOUR TEAMMATE, I LOSE YOUR TEAMMATE, AND YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PICKED UP BY THE TIME I GET BACK, YOU'RE GOING BACK ON THE HOOK, EVEN IF IT KILLS YOU. BUT CHANCES YOU ALREADY DISCONNECTED AT STEP FIVE.

Uncorrupted Lore: In the novel, It is a monster that can shapeshift and change forms. Pennywise the Clown is It's most used . After arriving on Earth, It would sleep for approximately 27 to 30 years at a time, then awaken to wreak chaos and feed. It prefers the taste of fear. It is able to take many more forms including werewolves, bats, leeches, and sharks, embodying any of a child's worst fears to break them down. It has the ability to control the minds and actions of people with weaker wills ant to the terrible events that unfolded before their eyes.
---
It originated in a void containing and surrounding the Universe‚Äîa place referred to in the novel as the "Macroverse" (a concept similar to the later established "Todash Darkness" of the Dark Tower novels). At several points in the novel, It claims its true name is "Bob Gray", and is named "It" by the group of children who later confront it. Throughout the book, It is generally referred to as male; however, late in the book, the children come to believe It may be female (due to It's manifestation as a large female spider). In addition, upon seeing It's true form Audra Denbrough thinks, "Oh dear Jesus, It is female." Despite this, the true form of It is never truly known. The final physical form It takes is that of an enormous spider, but this is the closest the human mind can comprehend. It's true form is not precisely what the children actually see.

---
Thank you! That's essentially how you do it. R/perkbydaylight has very thorough instructions!
---
You have a point, but the thing is there are more useful perks to use
---
get it because both characters have the same name
---
Oh damn I was just kidding, I will help you a bit. Deja vu (the one to see the 3 gens at the start) is one of the most useless perk since you can locate the gens easily just by looking around, the one that let's you see the killer aura istj so bad, it gives situational awareness but if you like this perk, I would suggest to you to run Feng Min's teachable perk Alert, which let's you see the killer's aura for 3/4/5 seconds when he performs a breaking action (kicking gens or breaking a pallet). Flip flop isn't that bad but it's situational, I would suggest to run unbreakable with it, unbreakable let's you recover 35% faster when in the dying state and let's you pick yourself up once in a trial (it means you don't need your teammates help to get up, but you can do it only once) and boil over is pretty much useless, you might have been tricked thinking that it would let you wiggle off the killer's back faster (everyone thinks about this when they read boil over's description) but it only makes the killer's movement worse when he's carrying you.
---
yay

Someone already did this

whats worse than axe is *axe mixed with sweat.* i call it rotten axe and its literally made me vomit

I like how this guy made this account today just for the purpose of making this post. Not a very good bait but I guess you got some people.
---
I'm a rank 19 killer with less than 20 hours on this game total. I keep getting match with reds who teabag and flashlight spam for no real competitive reason.
---
I understand your annoyance with The pig(honestly I hate playing against her as well) but don‚Äôt dc. It pisses off other survivors,you lose items and offerings and the game has a salty undertone for the rest of the match
---
Also you won‚Äôt have to deal with RBTs if you either stealth or escape chases.
---
Sam Axe has a chain and bracelet all the time in Burn Notice, sure its gold vs the silver, but its hard to deny that his Florida Ash isn't based on his Sax Axe.

ill take anything but spirit/nurse, michael still has to play by the rules of the game

It's because the Killer is the host of the lobby. If they leave you keep you pips unless they unplug their PC or close app on Console. It will change with dedicated servers. But for now STFU

I know shes objectively good, but I'm so bad at hatchets that shes mostly a 110 percent killer that occasionally gets a ranged shot. I just like her outfits...

This includes the new bloodweb update?

You are the reason this shit happens
---
Get a killer to level 30,35, and 40 for each perk
---
Real winning strat is to open it right until first light lights up, hide, wait for killer to check on the gate and then fully open it.
---
When you hit level 35 on a killer, you see one of their original perks show up as an orange perk. This is called a "teachable" and once you buy that on your bloodweb, it is now going to show up randomly on all other bloodwebs on all killers at some point from then on.
---
Then you unlock the next perk at 40, then the final one at 45.
---
Thank you
---
Yes, send a message to the trolls and toxic players that are trying to provoke a reaction, that'll fix it

Basically me but I keep spending bloodpoints even though I'm trying to save them for Flower Face, I absolutely hate and love how grindy this game is.

WHEN YOU GET IT TWICE IN A ROW IN THE SE DAY BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY NURSE
---
**The Master Builder**
---
If you disconnect so frequently from connection problems to make a 10k bp loss a problem you shouldn't play this game.
---
i mean playing like that will make you stay bad so its no biggie for everyone else, if you have fun with it then more power to you i guess?
---
Life isn't fair. Get used to it bitch.
---
Yea, i dedicate 3 / 4 perks to slowing the game down (Thana, Ruin, Pop). 
---
And i do play both sides, i would even say i play survivor more. When it comes to killer, i only play one killer that's it. I used to play pre-reworked freddy and when his reworked got announced i moved to Legion, and i have been only playing Legion since (of course with a few games of billy in there). Its fair to say i know a bit about Legion, whats good and whats bad, but the issue i see in him isn't his ability to not be able to kill, its because even with good snowball the gens are simply too fast. Its more of a core gameplay issue. This goes with other killers as well like wraith, Bubba and clown.
---
Theres multiple videos out there showing gens being done in stupid times, some of them are just bad killer games but others is a show of "Im applying lots of pressure, but gens are being done and i cant do jack shit".
---
What teachable do you want?
---
You have to reach the level 30/35/40 with a killer/surivor to make his/her perks findable in other blood web
---
Barbecue and chili, I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs an amazing perk
---
Totally agree to that. I think they definitely need ‚Äúranked‚Äù and ‚Äúcasual‚Äù categories. Not sure if the community is big enough to split it like that.
---
Na. I'll just beat you at the game. That sounds like a better idea.
---
It is good luck leveling up leatherface to level 35 (that‚Äôs the level for bbq)
---
Just a tip. Once you're at 1 mill (or at a high enough amount that you are comfortable to leave off with), try playing something else until the DLC comes out to prevent the urge of spending BP on other characters. Once I get to 1 million, I'm just gonna play TF2 and Minecraft until the day arrives.

What about SHREDDING her booty?

And when he tbags, it bellows out through his neck hole. Probably why he's always letting out those depressed little sighs.

I appreciate all the jokes but how about grown up D'Artagnan and his weapon is him holding a 3 musketeers bar
---
I was really excited when I saw an official BHVR reply to this and yeah: this honestly hits the nail on the head. If anything happens it's on EAC, not BHVR. But with that in mind Behavior won't revert a ban when EAC detects a hack, even if EAC is wrong.

if u can call it such
---
Killer: "Aha! I've closed the hatch, so that now the last survivor must open an exit gate. But with the gates so close together, there's no chance they can do so without my noticing! They'll have no choice but to fall into my clutches!"
---
Me, looking for dull totems: "It's time for a three-minute S C A V E N G E R  H U N T!"
---
That was me in Yellow.
---
Yeah I try to do that but something draws me to dbd making me play,  I don't really spend  1 million when I get to it it's more so when I'm in the process of reaching it because once I reach 1 million I don't spend them but just grinding and have a large sum of bp that isn't max makes me wanna spend them, probably because I think "oh hey it isn't 1 million so you can grind right back up to it no big deal spend away"

Naw, just me being bad at faces
---
We need an actuality scary clown
---
His outfit from the summer massacre collection
---
I don‚Äôt DC if I can help it, I‚Äôm just saying that DCing would probably become prevalent if Pig had every trap listed on this post at her disposal. If the game is slowed down to a crawl and no one can get anything done, all survivors are going to de-pip anyway and leave with low BP, so it makes sense to DC and move on without wasting time on that round.
---
That gate doesn‚Äôt look very open
---
I doubt Pennywise would be able to scare adults (Besides the Loser‚Äôs Club), but with Pennywise he‚Äôs like a dog, killing you to eat, The Clown is someone who enjoys suffering and the fact that he‚Äôs a human makes it scarier, he doesn‚Äôt need magic powers to make you suffer, just his sociopathic behavior
---
I suppose that would work, it would probably would be more consumer friendly to just let you buy the Mori on its own, but it seems that consumer friendliness is not an overly big trend with the gaming industry so yeah I suppose from a business standpoint I could see behaviour doing that cuz It would bring in more money.
---
I never even recommended a BP loss. That was the OP, I went against it. + I don‚Äôt DC at all, and have rarely ever had it happen on my own cause. Usually it‚Äôs the game servers closing for an update or something.
---
I sure do love misplaced modifiers
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).
---
Hate to say it but the joke was kinda funny the first time, now that joke is just a pulverized mush that used to be a horse.
---
Nah.
---
You seem too level-headed.
---
Give quitter bonus to survivors too
---
You say this because you haven't figured out how to counter him. You'll figure it out one day.
---
Ghostface isn‚Äôt really that great in general tbh. As long as they don‚Äôt nerf him at all, Im hoping demegorgon wont be too terrible in the long run.
---
If you haven't put on Spine Chill, it's highly reccommended. It gives you concrete information on a killer coming towards your gen before you hear a terror radius. Compared to just the heartbeat, I've hidden and stayed hidden much more than just listening for a radius.
---
However, learn to know when you should hide and when you should be chased. If the killer has no pressure (i.e. all survivors are healthy and killer is chasing no one) that can waste a TON of the killer's time and if they search even 20 seconds for you and fail, that's basically a gen they lost in that.
---
If your team is trying to recover from pressure, it'a good if you can be chased for at least a good 30-40 seconds. If the killer ends up abandoning chase on you in that amount of time, your team should be unhooked and fully healed by that time if they're competent.
---
just revert it to how it was in the PTB, I don't see the issue that it had there.
---
You're right..  the only yellow thing about me is my rank. Lol
---
Looks like that's on low quality graphics settings, so maybe it does look better on higher qualities?
---
We'll find out when they finally release them!
---
What should I have said instead, if I didn‚Äôt know the exact release date? Would ‚Äúsometime this month‚Äù have made you feel any better about this?
---
I understand that, I'm telling you that it shouldn't be a problem to implement bp loss. And DCs happen all the time, watch any high-rank streamer.
---
Hey if  it's in a bundle that means if they want they could just the whole bundle cheaper and allow the Mori to atleast be bought but it being more expensive meaning you could still get it but the bundle includes a bunch of more and the Mori animation and it's at a  meaning hey you could buy the bundle and spend less to get everything or just by it out right, sure it might be a little odd  buy I'm looking at it from the best way to make cash from a devs perspective without getting witch hunted by your own community.
---
Sometime this month would probably sound better, also it‚Äôs coming out on the 17th so be prepared
---
Democat
---
Lmao, this is so true it hurts.
---
im not sure how linking the original post makes him your "acquaintance" but alright man. It's not that serious.
---
I would love a Myers in a Starfleet iniform
---
NOED also has one of the greatest effects even in circumstances where it *isn't* being played, along with DS and BBQ. It forces survivors to run around the map cleansing dull totems, because the killer *might* be running it.
---
But, usually, said effort are completely wasted because of one totem sitting in a tricky spot, so most people don't bother and just rush the gens. That's the main complaint about it, and it wouldn't be hard to tweak.
---
I believe they are just nerfing the fatigue by a little bit meaning lunging won't be faster then just walking and give some time for the survivors
---
Adrenaline isn't really used that often just for the heal. What makes it strong is that it works on the hook effectively giving you super BT.

---
...whoops
---
True
---
I only watched a little bit of the footage but it  looks amazing. I started playing right before gf hit his ptb, so I never got to experience this version of the game but it does look way, way better than it does now. I wish they'd bring it back too.
---
Lol yeah right. If you wanna farm for an hour. No killer is gonna let you farm for over 20 alone.
---
No the DC'ing IS the message
---
Oooooohhhhhhh
---
Just got out of a match were I was a level 13 or so, verses a red rank, somehow we even got a level 18 in the game too.
---
Again, not what i'm saying.
---
3 gen strating is a bullshit tactic kids who can't win use
---
Well make it because tier 3 makes it a minute and a half it‚Äôs not much but you can heal anyone twice the speed and it‚Äôs good for quick heals when the killer is coming
---
Dont, as long as you do it PROPERLY to change them you wont get banned for it
---
Shirtception
---
He's played a lot in red ranks, Fred boi carried me to rank 1 because they always feel a false sense of safety in a field of dream pallets and get cocky. Then before you know it, 4ks, 4ks everywhere.
---
Hmmmmmm figured a troll who camps for lols would have thicker skin after all those end game chats.  I see this as an absolute win
---
He could have hit him with shred

That‚Äôs valid.

She just pushes you over and sits on you face, and your face is like the meme

He wanted you to wiggle, lmao
---
You can literally do that already though. You only need to play as one survivor or killer, not both, but just one to P3 everyone. I've never played as Quinten but I have him P3.
---
Nice man, its tough as shit getting rank 1 sometimes, I wish they would add the achievement to console though
---
the only problem i have whit getting high rank surv is feeling forced to play the top killers so i can compete whit them i deranked on purpose to play killers outside of the holy trinity " that and let my younger sister play killer on the pc " and i still get the gen rush army whit the usual  looper mixed in it at rank 16 ...

WOW for all 3 characters?!?!?!? That is erotic.

Ingame and on the website.

Aside from hacking or exploits there aren‚Äôt listed ‚Äúgameplay like‚Äù offenses. Aside from taking the game hostage which isn‚Äôt very clear. However they list body blocking as NOT bannable. For this reason I am not sure and think cases or examples would be more helpful.
---
safe unhooks are super limited and can be denied, if it is that easy then at some point it's on the killer for letting every single unhook be safe, not to mention it will have to take some sort of decent coordination for every survivor to get enough for multiple MoM's to activate.
---
Definitely a bait account.  Made just today?
---
I consistently play both sides, enjoy killer more, and still think NOED is unfair /:
---
The issue is I think survivors need something else besides gens to do. Some people say to just increase gen times, but who wants to hold left click for even longer? Sabo used to be a secondary objective for survivors, but it was so oppressive it was removed.

Had this happen to me once in my memory. Game was going well, and I got downed. As i'm being carried to the basement, I see someone open the exit gate and leave immediately. I think to myself "oh, that's going to make the save harder, but I still have two people to-" then a second person leaves. I barely have enough time to think "I swear to God-" before the last person that can save me leaves. This all occurs before I'm even hooked, so I don't even get the chance to try and kobe, which really sucks since I had decisive and could have escaped if someone stayed and helped. Later I messaged a survivor why they didn't save me, and I don't remember the full conversation, but his first response was just "because I left, lmao".
---
You like light theme?
---
Body blocking to wait out borrowed time or to prevent the killer from hooking someone is not bannable. 
---
Body blocking to hold the game hostage or as a survivor blocking another survivor so the killer can get a hit (which would be working with the killer) is bannable. 
---
Just common sense stuff.
---
It's already easy for killers to patrol, what do you mean? When the hatch is closed, it's pretty much gg for them. The only thing I'd want is for the gates to be more distant from one another in some maps.
---
Spine chill is really a great perk that almost always take. It is a bit unreliable when you are standing in a generator because killer might haven't seen you and they might go for the gen,but a great perk nevertheless.
---
But, with a killer running towards in your direction,you don't know if you had been hidden well,every with spine chill. Also,with a working gwn,they know a survivor is here.How much safety is usually needed to foul a killer (walking distance for killer scratch marks/gen)?I am usually try to juke and hide as much i can but i cannot find the time to walk enough.
---
Most people don‚Äôt think that they msg me complaining that it‚Äôs not fun for them tbh
---
Nice job just got my killer to rank 12
---
Yo I wear this exact outfit too! Glad someone gets it here. I'm sick of neon nea and clashing colors.

Talking about purple-rank players like that is like those "5'9" vs 6'0"" memes where the 5'9" is represented by Danny Devito.
---

---
why should every survivor be able to use it? sometimes you just don't get to use perks in game and if you really want to use it then don't be a gen jockey and be altruistic
---
Chest Protector Bubba Memes.  I've done them myself when I'm just messing around on my phone or something.  They can be pretty funny and I've had survivors message me postgame laughing their ass off about the memes.  There's different versions of it.  U typically only down and hook the poor soul who has the balls to touch my chest in front of me.  Survivors downed attempting to make a save are typically allowed to crawl back upstairs to get picked up.  I've got no qualms with them. This is between me and the little shit that's playing with my nice things.
---
Lol this made me laugh. Thank you.
---
Please, please, PLEASE buff Surge back to 32 meters BHVR, there are basically no perks other than pop goes the weasle that can replace Ruin. 
---
Surge seemed like the perfect perk to replace ruin on m1 killers but now with it only being 24 meters it barely covers more than one gen.
---
I really want to replace ruin with another stalling perk without having to risk getting run over but now surge just isn't good enough to replace ruin anymore.
---
No but could be?
---
The point was that dying light always directly conflicted with myers other two perks but the changes make it work with synergy. So it will be easier to do.
---
One alternative would be to somehow slightly debuff players in SWF. But I can't think of any balanced way to do that. And, since we're already deep in the nested comments, I don't think we're gonna have a proper discussion about it here.
---
Watch the not otzavarda video on YT. Just look up not otzavarda pwyf bubba
---
Ok thanks I‚Äôll check it out
---
They need to make it so that if you get it to work, Ash can just straight up mori the killer.
---
Very interesting!
---
I feel that the Hex perk is too strong though.
---
MoM just needs an additional way of getting stacks.
---
Relying only on buggy Protection hits is just bad game design.
---
Never mind that you have to go out of your way just to stack it. By the time you activate it, you‚Äôve done absolutely nothing. Just running around, getting hit and healing. If you actually play normally, you have even fewer opportunities to gain Protection stacks.
---
I understand how powerful it was, but this is just embarrassing game balance. If this is how the devs balance the game, then I‚Äôm really not fucking surprised about how many times NOED was reworked and how sick of it they are.
---
I just can‚Äôt believe anybody thought this was a good idea.
---
Damn, that looks awesome! On a side note, I can't get the image of Doctor chasing survivors while wearing shorts out of my head now.
---
Bruce is sick too
---
Minty rag hag If anything
---
Shouldn't the meme be reversed? Wouldn't it make more sense or am I just high
---
That's illegal.
---
I think it depends on how the teabagging is applied
---
I've always seen it as the person just being goofy, not a BM or anything. I'll even do it for shits and giggles because both the survivor being moried and the killer can't do anything
---
Lol this made me laugh, thank you!
---
Aight thanks
---
I'd go for a top hat, a black tie, and a cane weapon.
---
Bonus points if using all of them together it changes his chase music to Hello my ragtime gal
---
I'm sorry
---
that's my point... even with safe unhooks being a thing, it's highly unlikely that everyone will get an active MoM, and technically protection hits are "unlimited" but for everyone to just bum rush the killer for said protection hits, at that point you're probably helping the killer more than what's it worth to activate MoM multiple times.
---
I use whispers, Save the best for last, Ruin and haunted grounds. Save the best for last is great bc you can dash attack the obbsession and not lose stacks
---
I was thinking the same thing... Even without the ability to see survivors nearby, the Demogorgon seems like it could be near unbeatable in the EGC with this strategy.
---
We need a photoshop of this stat.
