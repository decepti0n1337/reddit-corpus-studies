Bill didn‚Äôt just die he sacrificed himself so his group of survivors could live on! Dudes a grade-A badass hero!
---
---
---
Reason was for evil
---
I don‚Äôt watch noob3. I actually don‚Äôt watch any DBD youtubers besides the occasional Monto videos. 
---

---
Yes I completely agree they‚Äôre both shit. I sometimes think to myself ‚Äúholy shit that should have hit‚Äù and then ‚Äúholy shit that shouldn‚Äôt have hit at all‚Äù. 
---
That‚Äôs pretty funny tho that it‚Äôs balanced by not being balanced. 
---
Didn‚Äôt know about invisible walls tho? I know about fat shaming. That‚Äôs about it. 
---
Yeah true. However I feel like he kinda became the wraith at that point and everything leading up to that was his backstory. 
---
Hitscan isn't the same thing as "favor the shooter". Projectiles can still favor the shooter.
---
Favor the shooter is a way game devs deal with lag. If you hit something on your screen you will deal damage after your ping delay.
---
In the case of DBD, you would hit the Survivor with a hatchet and the game sends that to the server. The server reads it and understands you've made a hit then sends an updated game state where you've hit them.
---
Right now, in KYF with 100-150ish ping you can hit someone with your hatchet and it just doesn't register at all. Or, as hillbilly, on your end you hit the chainsaw but the game says you didn't. So you'll have the hit animation but the Survivor will not go down.
---
This is the issue with Killer having ping. Scenarios like these will occur. (Still *a lot* better than what we have right now).
---
This is getting out of hand.
---
Most insightful list yet.

Im sorry man, we should get a licensed character this year though so that's something
---
this must have been filmed in southern Sweden
---
Huntress, should go down. She kills everybody who isn't a little girl. Billy should probably go down as well, nothing in his lore suggests he was ever sympathetic towards his victims. 
---
If they hit someone while frenzied to give them deep wounds, they see red outlines of anyone else in their terror radius, even though walls.
---
I have decided that I want to /disconnect/
---
Can you not downvote though please, i really want to get this message out.
---
LOL it‚Äôs probably you
---
What? Lol why would I downvote you? If someone did it wasn‚Äôt me 
---
A quick google search away
---
Family dissociates hits pretty hard for me. It's the most sad to me because its personally relatable
---
Apology accepted! &lt;3
---
You're under arrest for Necro-Pedophilia
---
If they're deadset on camping then it won't work but it does sometimes work and they have to consider the idea that the notifications are coming from someone with crows on their head  too so if you play killer enough to know exactly how that sounds and then time the jumping to make it seem like that it could possibly bait them. But honestly it's so much more productive to do a gen instead and your teammates will probably appreciate that more
---
It really do be like that
---
If Survivor rewarded more BP, there would be less incentive to play Killer. If I could get 45k+ BP every Survivor game, I would never play Killer again because of how stressful your time management is.
---
Ship seems too hard to program, and Graveyard seem over the top, but the rest sound good. Especially the tunnel one.
---
ohhh, i see...
---
heck
---
I'm assuming he found you in that locker and that's why the video ended there.
---
Still feel really bad for the dude.  He was just a normal dude, doing normal dude work, probably making three cents less than jack-diddly-squat an hour, living in an "open concept" singles apartment (read: bedroom with a toilet in the corner on the other side of the both-kitchen-and-bathroom-sink).  Then, one day, boom:  "Yeah, you've been killing people this whole time."
---
Sure, why not. 
---
&gt;It's gotten to the point now that if I want to level my survivors, the most efficient way for me to do that is to play as a killer.
---
I'd guess that this is intentional, like they're trying to give you incentives to play killer more often and fill lobbies. 
---
It would feel like the Lodge. Tbh.
---
Yeah isn't it weird that it's balanced because it's unbalanced for both sides? And yeah, a lot of invisible barriers are there. Not as much in the MacMillan estate but in auto haven wreckers holy fuck its invisible barrier land. Almost all the loops have invisible barriers and it's a pain in the ass. Thankfully I'm not a huntress player(I suck at her) so I don't have to deal with that 
---
You're welcome. Any thoughts on how I'd modify your ideas? 
---
Thanks!
---
Once Freddy gets his rework (I can dream), maybe Vigil could increase the time it takes for you and those near you to fall asleep in addition to the effects Darkwing\_Dork suggested? It'd fit well with how Quentin was able to help Nancy stay awake towards the film's climax and help his perks cement him as a Team First kind of Survivor.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Agreed.
---
Play Basement Billy with Territorial, then remake this list.
---
Make more $10 skins devs
---
can you cite examples of the monstrous behavior that you claim these people exhibit? they always seem to be nice to even the biggest douchebags, and if they tilt, they apologize pretty quickly
---
Wonderful idea. Vigil rework needs to happen soon üëÄ get on it devs!!
---
Ace and David in "hard" situations. üòè

[LITERALLY, FUCHSIA.](https://images.fabric.com/images/693/693/0462997.jpg)
---
No, he tickles your taint
---
Nope. Went outside and beat the hell out of Feng.
---
Bill is a fucking badass and I love him, I wish they gave him a perk where he just whips out his trusty m16 and fucking guns down the killer
---
Sounds good to me! :)
---
It'd also mean this mode could double as a way to level and learn how to play Killers you haven't invested bloodpoints into too, since you wouldn't be penalized for not having leveled them.
---
FUCK YOU MORE CUZ ITS RED
---
Oftentimes facecamping/tunneling is to benefit the game. Personally I find it shitty but it is technically a 'strategy' you can use to win the game. Only bad players use these techniques but it isn't necessarily toxic, whereas purposely going out of your way to taunt another player when it doesn't actually benefit you gameplay-wise is completely unnecessary and toxic. 
---
with Kate, i think the tragic and sad part of her backstory is the fact she WAS abducted, and manipulated into making her abduction possible. That's just me though \*shrug\* 
---
Correct, like 10 miles from gothenburg
---
Watched him on twitch, he ok but in like a 30 minute period over like 5 matches as killer , he was calling every survivor shitty and making the same jokes every  20 seconds.  Then he switches to a high pitch voice over and says the same joke but in a high pitched voice .  Can really only watch him in very short bursts, and really if there is no one else on 
---
When you get morid and the other fucking survivors come and watch
---
Thank you my friend! 
---
WELL IT LOOKS RED SO ITS REDD
---
Someone tell me why I can hit like 10 greats in a row with no ruin and suddenly when ruin is up I'm boosted af
---
&gt;When I see your legion I will DC
---
As a survivor main, this is toxic af. By DCing, you leave the rest of the team stuck in a harder situation and make it easier for the killer to win. Even if Legion was the worst killer to play against, you are just making the game unfun for everyone involved and screwing over your team
---
I'd argue it's slightly lighter than Fuchsia. 
---
IMO it's Cerise, not Fuchsia.
---
Please take advantage of the extra power of the Xbox One X and the PS4 pro
---
This is actually a good idea. As long as the cool-down for it wasn't super long then it'd work. But one change I really want for him is to make self-care no longer proc skill checks, forcing you to blow a gen or find another survivor.
---
Posts about how everyone DCs against you, yet you DC for basically the same reason... smh
---
Are there more people playing killer on PC than survivor? That‚Äôs absolutely not the case on console
---
Sorry for my confusion, thank you
---
This is the kinda quality I'm looking for on this sub
---
Darn bitches...
---
Darth Maul lookin ass Trapper üëåüëåü•∞ü•∞
---
wow this information is game breaking
---
Don't play legion, THATS the evil here \^\_\^
---
Lot of players play killer because they enjoy it, not to mention you need 4 survivors for every 1 killer. Even if there are too many survivor mains, using BP to get people to play killer is a band-aid fix on the problem.
---
 ü•ú 
---
lol yep :)
---
Not really
---
&gt;Just because we feel sympathy for them and their sad backstory
---
That's what I meant by "sympathetic", my dude
---
Between then dirty legs
---
Because it‚Äôs what should happen
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well
---
FUSCHIA
---
Actually it sparks. A lot.
---
[SAW SPOILERS!!]
---
In the movie, the last shot was to depict Tapp dying on the floor.
---
However, the video game took place after he was left on the floor, kidnapped by Jigsaw and was still alive but endures through much more events.
---
Two endings: [A] He walks free, discontinuing his investigation and committing suicide. [B] He pursues Jigsaw, only to be tricked. He goes mad and ends up in an insane asylum...
---
For me it's the complete opposite. I'll be nailing those Ruin skillchecks for 80 seconds straight, but then when we don't have Ruin, I'll miss the entire skillcheck
---
This. I‚Äôve hurled so many hatchets center mass at a survivor vaulting and it will just fly straight through them. Triggers me every time. 
---
r/dbdgonewild btw for anyone 
---
I thought this was based on how sympathetic the killers themselves were towards their victims. mb
---
What goes where then
---
Kill yourself you little shit eating cunt. All your posts on this sub are shit and Rebecca agrees with me. 
---
I want to get the icon for the store. Monster coming out of the suitcase looks cool tbh
---
You can‚Äôt move your planet. 
---
Right?!
---
I like licensed killers though. There are only a few more that anyone would want anyways. 
---
Where's the thing that describes Jigsaw's methods as "back alley therapy" when you need it
---
What immediately strikes me about Huntress' mori is that it's backwards.  She hits the head once, then the chest twice‚Äîand, I get it, it's a reference to a pop-culture quote, but once you've chopped the skull and its contents in half:  that's it.  You're done.  The other two hits accomplish nothing.
---
If you want it to be truly brutal, let them feel the crushing loss of that left lung, then the right, and wait just long enough for the feeling of bloody airlessness to sink into their still-conscious minds before plopping that thing down into the gray matter.
---
Nah I think she was in college
---
thats creepy
---
When you want to advertise your own channel but don't want the backlash from it. 
---
I'd say swamp should be b tier. Some of the spawns are like most, in plain sight and are pretty much a waste of a perk, but the ones that spawn in the corners of the map can take forever to find.
---
Das tuff
---
which ones the grey one
---
Vince is the man lol dude is crazy
---
Now we need this for the killers. I would love to see the comparison.
---
My ass. 
---
I feel bad for bubba, his family is the only reason he kills and they bully him and scare him so much haha
---
Dont believe that's better at all but w/e
---
Hags fun. It's weird that's all youre seeing though
---
I love Mathieu ‚ù§
---
Imagine getting sued for spamming crouch and having fun
---
The anime has 100% less buttered poopers.
---
Nurse: teleports towards you
---
You: turns around and runs
---
Im on board with any survivor Bp increases, just let killers keep their ultra rare addons after a 3K
---
Yes
---
&gt;I haven't played console in a long time
---
Not enough people playing killer
---
Except they did lie. They said optimization should be done by December, and it wasn‚Äôt and then they tried to pretend they didn‚Äôt say that. That is a lie.
---
Ultra rare add ons are typically quite good and things like iridescent head almost always result in 3ks or 4ks. That would imo quite problematic.
---
Thicc Boi mains unite!
---
Yeah, he was pretty nice to take the heat off the other survivors. As long as he didn't instantly go down, he was insanely helpful. 
---
Hah,  I assumed it was always the last given my luck
---
That‚Äôs clowns gimmick lol, he slows you down and catches you
---
They need to add a party system. I never seen any game that's online with such poor party system. I hate having to constantly invite my friends to lobbys everytime one is finished.
---
I too noticed that the Hag is at perfect height...
---
Story of my life...
---
I know his gas but like even without he‚Äôs just always there idk maybe I‚Äôm bad against him
---
its upside down
---
But doesn't 30K Bp's a game plus the ability to keep items and add-ons which could include rainbow maps or purple toolboxes seem problematic, just like killer addons, survivors dect out in powerful items have the ability to sway the game
---
Hmm... Nah. 
---
RED
---
That I'm color blind wasn't a joke, but the "I think grey should be moved to..." was a joke
---
4v4 Killer matchup
---
Yeah, it's opposite for me. I can hit all those greats with ruin, but the second it's cleansed I'm only hitting good skill checks -\_-
---
Huh? 
---
There should be a tier all the way above the rest that only has Jeff which says "DOG WAITS FOR OWNER TO RETURN". Y'all have no fucking idea how much I cried when I read about Jeff's dog in his backstory
---
Bill didn't just die, he sacrificed himself to save his friends
---
He's a character from the game series Left 4 Dead.  The game's about a zombie apocalypse, and Bill is one of the few survivors.  He's a grumpy old vietnam vet.  He's a playable character in 1 and later dies sacrificing himself to help the others escape.  
---
  
---
In DBD his bio is  
---
&gt;It took two tours in Vietnam, a handful of medals, a knee full of shrapnel, and an honourable discharge to get William "Bill" Overbeck to stop fighting and try to live a peaceful life. He hated it. After decades spent drifting aimlessly through dead end jobs, Bill went in for a routine surgery and woke up to find the world he knew was gone. A plague was turning normal people into mindless killing machines. Naturally, the first thing he did was fight his way home and put on his uniform. Making his way through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests, he found other Survivors, and together they fled from the infected hordes. In the end, Bill sacrificed himself to ensure their safety. His body was never found. Bill was left for dead. No one knows that he still has the only thing he ever wanted: an enemy to fight.
---
There's multiple layers though, it's not quite that simple. If you run straight you'll obviously be hit. If you try and just run backwards she'll short blink and get you, so you have to do a back and forth dance around obstacles to fake her out so she predicts wrong. That can go on for a long time depending on the skill of the survivor and the nurse and it's way more engaging (imo) than being chased by most other killers (run to pallet loop -&gt; loop around it until you misplay or they get bored and go elsewhere). Obviously it's not that straightforward, but most the general chase pattern is the same for most killers in contrast to the Nurse.
---
Her, too. I always get butt fucked by a Spirit, but I play her when I'm in tryhard mode. 
---
I know what makes her tick, but still haven't learned how to break that tick. 
---
Freddy only gets you in close if there is not a safe spot 7 seconds away, or the survivor is dumb enough to hang out in a dead zone. Wraith/Myers/Pig/Legion are better at getting in close.
---
This has been in game for months wtf is it seriously still unpatched
---
 [u/Atakori](https://www.reddit.com/user/Atakori) is the artist. That took literally 2 seconds to google. C'mon now.
---
Ik this is a repost, but who tf thinks alcohol turns your eyes red?
---
Yeah. We do know he's dead RIP
---
Bill. It's always been Bill. He's just a fucking Hero. If there is anyone that can take everyone out of the Fog it's Bill.
---
now i seem even stupider
---
FUSHCHIA
---
Like i've been saying we need a mummy or anubis killer, it'd be popular and easy to design
---
Too late, it's illegal in hypotheticals to add additional rules.
---
Sorry to school ya like this, better luck next time.
---
The bill one made me laugh omg. Also Min might have had a loving family but she didn‚Äôt love herself rip. 
---
Don't play Legion then.
---
IT‚ÄôS FUCKING RED!
---
I can see him semi enjoying being in another "battle" or something. I could also see a layer of guilt for sacrificing himself, leaving Zoey, Louis and Francis only to end up in the realm. He might think  his sacrifice was in vain or something like that.
---
Name: The ManInGauze
---
Perks: Slab Curse, Terrify Children, Endless Theme Song
---
Survivors may attempt to break the song by searching for various record players around the map, which, when smashed, will grant a small reprieve from the song.
---
New Survivor: (Stupid) Dog 
---
I agree, they should be enhanced. Maybe even improved visuals
---
Ahhh I see, I thought they could from gameplay I‚Äôd seen but I didn‚Äôt realize they had to score a hit and have others in range to get that. Thanks, match makes more sense now cuz two people tried to get me and Susie found them easily but the final person seemed harder.
---
It does turn your eyes red!...if you pour it in your friggen eye!
---
Get ready for the downvotes.
---
He‚Äôll top a tier list for ‚Äòbest at cracking one liners‚Äô but apart from that, he‚Äôs always gonna be at the bottom.
---
SCP-106 mid-emergence
---
They can play them though, you can use the brown addons that are stupidly easy to get. Survivors don't even need perks and addons and will function the same.
---
Thank you! Would you happen to have any other recommendations? I have max perks for both and plenty of adds to play with.
---
Which is just about as bad as me dcing. Juggling a survivor due to a perk you dont like to troll them. That's my only point lol
---
I would put The Pig and Myers a bit higher, just going off of my experience playing against them, and Legion way, way lower (also my experience). Everything else is fine though.
---
I main Feng and I really like to see Jeff. Even better when he's using the black metal skin
---
So nerf killers even more, in the current survivor meta
---
the billy killed and mutilated farm animals....so yeah
---
Pretty accurate.
---
Myers is evil incarnate, with no reason not motive behind what he was doing. Amanda was a drug addict who then got a warped perception of reality after going through one of Jigsaw‚Äôs games. She then obeyed the guy religiously. So whilst she definitely isn‚Äôt a nice person, she‚Äôs still nowhere near Michael.
---
It Pred haha
---
They've been saying summer since the servers were announced. Nothing was pushed back, we never had a date in the first place
---
I love his right arm being the only normal animation.
---
I think surviving with deadly &amp; traumatic experiences is worse than dying with them. But in the end, it doesn't even matter since they all kinda live in the Entity's realm.
---
‚ÄòBeing a shitty killer wasn‚Äôt a problem, but being forgotten?! Now that‚Äôs a bitch!‚Äô
---
Dude why did you even post
---
People rag on Legion a lot but that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs fundamentally broken and lame, but Legion is still an inescapable toxic killing machine with the right perks and addons. 
---
Defeated
---
He aggravates me to no end
---
Kinda spot on, though from my personal experience, Myers should be more at the top. 
---
I'd like to recommend the reverse for the Hex Ruin if it were to be. Should be its strongest with all 5 active, getting weaker to the point it no longer exists. Though to be fair I think it only really affects those who suck at skill checks (like me lol). Where as those who play loads, like a lot of streamers seem to just power through it like its not even there.
---
Tho am hoping the secondary objective does come to light. Hell, maybe need to find something first prep the generators for repair.
---
Prestige 3. you get bloody skins for your character when you prestige and it makes her darker/blend in more 
---
Happy cake day
---
Too much has to go his way for him to be successful. He‚Äôs a snowball killer that‚Äôs easily looped and bullied. Stealth and one shot mechanic isn‚Äôt enough to put him higher from my experiences against and as him.
---
He said ‚Äúbeen a long ago since I‚Äôve laughed that hard, those 20s‚Äù
---
Someone who judges people by their phones. Ew.
---
All I get is hillbilly
---
I bet you had the same expression when you posted this. 
---
Dead By Dumbshit
---
Moving people around:
---
Wraith +1 - Killed one guy who killed a bunch of guys. TBH IDK why Philip killing one dude was enough for the Entity to take him I think the Entity just thought it would be cool to have a guy with a bell and an axe made out of a spine.
---
Billy -1? - Was basically angery at his parents for calling him ugly but has never stopped being angery.
---
Leatherface +1 - Doing it cause him family are creeps and he doesn't know any better.
---
Trapper -1 - His lore literally describes what he did as "the worst mass murder in modern history." He maybe didn't enjoy it but he's certainly a sick fuck.
---
Mikey -1 - Has no concept of morality. He just does it because it's what he does. He doesn't enjoy it or have hatred towards the people he kills; *he just kills.*
---

---
I want to see killers ranked by how much hair they have. Idk why
---
Would you be able to interact with people as a god?
---
Almost a perfect lol
---
Pro tip: If you're playing survivor you can just pan the camera when you get to struggle state if wearing a skirt. There's not much else to do but enjoy the view. 
---
What is down and up voting?
---
Feels good man
---
so?
---
I have no idea what it means.
---
:(
---
Move Trapper to sick fuck that enjoys himself, definitely.
---
Survivor wait times on PC are nearly instant, which leads me to believe there isnt exactly a shortage of killers.
---
&gt;Billy -1? - Was basically angery at his parents for calling him ugly
---
they bricked him up in a room and fed him through a hole in the wall dude.
---
Beat Saber is 90 FPS. Thumper was 60 FPS until VR where it runs 90 FPS. Thumper was written by two guys, one of whom decided to write his own engine for it. Super Stardust HD was 60 FPS with 10k physics objects because they optimized the holy living shit out of their parallel SPU code.
---
Huntress would be much higher if the controller joysticks had the fluidity and sensitivity of a mouse. 
---
Its how reddit views the post, if you down vote the post it is less likely to spread but if you up vote it spreads the post and gets it shown more.
---
It basically determines how much the post is spread out and known.
---
Police jesus? 
---
Ded
---
Ha! Get fucked man
---
The barrel totems are spicy. Love them.
---
I know right. I‚Äôm glad I looked around tho:)
---
Not in his base kit. And if no one steps in your traps, you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time. Trapper is my favorite killer btw.
---
Sorry that I dont consider a killer losing a hit that will literally do the animation for the hit. That is far from better.
---
Get help.
---
&gt;No downsides
---
Lmao.
---
&gt;Can fuck up loops like no one else
---
There're so many pallets on most maps that his bombs end up not fucking up loops that badly.
---
&gt;Can mindgame
---
??
---
&gt;Bloodpoint machine
---
Sure, but we're talking about good killers vs. bad, not what's best for farming points.
---
&gt;Bottles give you free hits in the open
---
&gt;Can help you find people
---
Bombs aren't very good for finding people.
---
&gt;He is barely out of S tier.
---
He's the worst killer in the game by a noticeable difference. There used to be some argument as to whether Pig was worse, but with the recent buffs, Pig is far better. He has the same problem that all the shit killers have in that he can't pressure the map very well whatsoever. He's great for tunneling one person, though.
---
No addons? You a masochist?
---
I would assume it's a rank think. Rank 1 has a lot of 4 mans. If you're not past rank 10, I'd assume that the Killers are dodging to avoid the dreaded "4-man SWFs" they keep hearing about.
---
For me, I get full lobbies as a Killer at rank 1. Sometimes it takes a bit because 1 or 2 will leave and we have to wait for the lobby to refill. As for Survivor, I either get into a game rather quickly or it takes several minutes. 
---
totally forgot them xD
---
Jesus Christ. That guy is a badass. It makes me want to play him on PS4. Too bad we only have access to his perks.
---
Holy crap, dude. I'm well aware and familiar with that argument. I'm using the term 'gen rushing' to explain multiple gens going off in succession  &amp; doing shit like continuing to work on a gen even though I'm standing next to them wiping off my weapon after injuring them.
---
True
---
Waiting for him to come home from the store like I'm waiting for that Freddy buff
---
Classic Myers  :)
---
I would assume Ruin is the reason they are all playing. Gotta get that perk, yo.
---
I m always hitting great sc under unnerving presence. Tell me it‚Äôs not just me please. 
---
Whaddya mean not in his base kit? If no one steps in your traps you are playing Trapper wrong lol, that‚Äôs like saying if you never hit your chainsaw you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time. Both LF and Trapper are punished heavily if you hit an object or place traps in the wrong place. That‚Äôs why they are both in the same place.
---
How are you finding Clowns? I never encounter more than one every few weeks, if I play Survivor at all.
---
Your pizzas here
---
Knock out. Makes survivors unable to see other survivors auras unless within a certain range
---
How is this off topic lmao, this is funny af nice job removing content that isnt DS/NOED bitching
---
not every company is a soulless cash hungry corporation bucko, the circus is down the street, your act is about to begin
---
Not a clue I‚Äôm rank 10 on ps4 I just started playing to get my rank up and this is the first time
---
He doesn‚Äôt have a one shot in his base kit, addon only, and that‚Äôs if they don‚Äôt get rescued.  And experienced survivors don‚Äôt step in traps as often as they disarm them. You need to force them to. 
---
At the start of the match you just slam into the exit gate and everyone except you escapes hahahaha
---
This dish wants you to eat by the rules it made up.
---
Well kiddo I'm actually rank 12 so uhhh git gud
---
This thread was painful to read
---
I mean you are incapacitated and almost guaranteed to be hooked if you step in one. Exactly, not saying he‚Äôs top, just next to LF
---
Because you deserve them.
---
I do regret putting him in low tier. He should be one tier up.
---
So you just love him cause he agrees with the most of it? When people say you are wrong don't just say "u a crybaby", you have to understand that everyone has their own opinions and you should take that into consideration before comenting something bad just because they disagreed. You love that guy for being a respectful mature person, but \*you\* aren't a respectful and mature person. You just attack the ppl that disagree with you, that isn't right.
---
The whole point of Ruin is to slow your progress. The killer has only so much time they can use to halt survivors in a match, and Ruin is meta given how crucial it is. The game can be over rather quickly otherwise. Higher than rank 12 they're practically guaranteed to open the exits. 
---
Go ahead, add it and post it
---
Why do you disrespect Myers like that?!
---
Example of toxic survivors right there, they blame the killer for their mistakes and accuse then if cheating rather than accepting the L they deserve
---
This, Pig crouching up and Spirit phasing near your gen always makes me shit myself
---
An all time classic.
---
Funnily enough Julie is too. 
---
No. Just angry survivors. Killers aren‚Äôt obligated to play in any way survivors want.  
---
I dont recall anywhere mentioned that she hated her patents in her backstory. Actually, I think its the opposite: her parents were the one who nurutred her interest in botany
---
ok I have this muted but whenever I see billy's chainsaw rev up I swear to god I can hear it 
---
That's kinda what I assumed, but I'm also really new and the survivors were purple (also one was a streamer) so I thought I might've broken some unspoken rule. Thanks for the input!
---
You post google images all the time. Get sources or stop please.
---
Oh yeah, I must have been thinking of someone else.
---
Nah, that's just the survivors being salty that you caught them out when they could've at least tried to leave the area ASAP and hide.
---
You broke no rule üòÇ there tends to he none anyway when killing
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Rin was a student of Adam's. Might make sense if she were to say "SSENSSEIII..." every time she Mori's him with Rancor. 
---
Wtf did you just bring upon this cursed land
---
I'm not one of them :]
---
There was no reason for anyone to downvote you.
---
Nea maybe
---
People aren‚Äôt handsome enough to cosplay bubba
---
I play about equal survivor and killer, and I've noticed that survivors are salty waaaaay more often than killers. When I first started playing, I assumed it would be the other way around. 
---
A good huntress can be a nightmare too
---
Probably about 4 and a half minutes, if that. Grabbed a survivor off of a gen with Trapper of all people and hauled them to the basement. They kept going for saves and suffering the same fate until all four hooks were occupied. This was also a rank 10 match, I kid you not. 
---
The game wants you to interact with the killer, not hide from them all game.
---
Probably the best totem spawn I've ever seen on Crotus Prenn Asylum. That map has horrendous spawns.
---
It's ridiculous. I've been playing since version 1.9.4 on PS4, and I haven't had my PMs or Friend Requests enabled since then.
---
Gen rushers? You mean I completing the only objective?
---
Optimization? You mean moar skinz amirite?
---
I hate doing Ruin solo. If I‚Äôm by myself I‚Äôm guaranteed to take 45 extra seconds per skill check to hit it. If I do it with someone else, I‚Äôm Great Skill Check Based God. 
---
Go get that stick out of your ass and stop being a cunt. Mcote is a treat and a humble dude.
---
Because paper plates cost $2. Grab a maker, doodle eyes and fake blood. Legion cosplay. It's boring and too many people do it. Cringy as fuck.
---
Totems are an objective as well.
---
The dog but is fucking sad. Whoever that imaginary person who stopped sitting the dog was? *FUCK YOU* and the entity for taking the dogs owner away? *FUCK YOU* I'd come up there and slap the shit out of the entity if I could
---
You can pull off some real big plays with overcharge on rank reset
---
wouldn't feng min be on social outcasts/family dissociates? her parents made her move out bc she was so invested in games right?
---
If it ain't broken don't fix it.
---
I prefer stealth plays, but that being said, until the last person was hooked, I wasn't exactly hiding. I saw the killer several times during the match, but I guess her focus was always on someone else. 
---
 Just do a NOED totem cosplay
---
If the game had something worth talking about anymore, then discussions would be easier to come by. Memes don't bother me personally. But people are probably just bored.....then there are the karma whores, but that's the internet for ya.
---
As long as your internet isn't shit then you're ok.
---
150 ping p2p will result in a lot more cheated hits.
---
I'm assuming the servers will be about 30-60 ping average depending on your location.
---
Survivors gets cheated out of everything. Hit through pallet, hit through stun, Killer isnt even close and still hits you.
---
This way both sides rarely get cheated but both are on a level playing field.
---
NOED is kinda unfair right now for survivors
---
Everyday we stray farther crim the entity's darkness
---
Too real.
---
lol keep it up, these are hilarious!
---
BOWWWNSAWWWIZZZREDDEEEE
---
&gt;NOED is kinda unfair right now for survivors
---
I don't see how cleansing 5 totems that 99% of the time are right beside survivors objectives and with plenty of tools to find them are unfair. 
---
NOED is only unfair if you are lazy. Plenty of times I see survivors doing a gen with a totem right next to them. They finish that gen and straight to another one instead of taking a few seconds to remove that totem. 
---
Takes a Nurse main to beat a Nurse main! I am a hardcore Nurse main, and whenever I play survivor, I usually run Nurses around for a few gens because I predict everything they do.
---
Unless they know what they're doing more than I do. Then I'm fucked.
---
Platform Ps4
---
Type Ingame
---
I brought a skeleton key with both adds to avoid losing it. And once I died it consumed both addons.
---
I then brought it for the next few games and it proceeded to happen each time without me going out through the hatch
---
Wanna know why?
---
"Heh! They can't use it if they never get off the Hook!" - A Leatherface who is sitting in a tent and getting ready to make smores, probably
---
and down 1
---
Papa Nihil as the new killer would be the funniest shit. 
---
Are you on the level?
---
Now that I think about it, a lot of the earlier backstories are fucking weird.
---
Once again, get that stick out of your ass. They are balancing the game with decisive's nerf, killer buffs that are needed and an assortment of other things. 
---
[removed]
---
Uh, but why tho? Have you seen the new killer teaser?
---
Yep. They used to leave more up to imagination..
---
They may have hinted that he loved kids in that way in Freddy vs Jason, I always figured his murders were motivated by sexual desires. 
---
Happened to me last night too. Were their names "try to hook me" and  "carry me" or something like that
---
Not sure how this counts as nsfw but then again foot Fetish, so right on.
---
By toxic survivor logic going after the person or who is easy to kill or doing something that will kill them and giving the killer the upper hand is tunneling or camping
---
Really don‚Äôt understand how they think doing things in a pragmatist way is bad since the whole point of a killer is to you know kill
---
The Huntress has the mentality of a small child, just like Leatherface

---
[Also yes, it's a real DLC.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1024660/DEATHGARDEN__Terminator_Set/)
---
On the flip side though, it feels terrible to die to a trick you picked up maining that killer and knowing it's coming the entire time and wiffing the counter to it...
---
You nailed that exactly. If we could just turn faster we don't have to swing while not knowing where they are.
---
I feel like King Crimson would be a perfect Stand for lag switching killers
---
What is legion doing above Myers and trapper
---
Well now I have failed as a perv cuz I was too busy thinkin a gohst girl look legit cute in her attire 
---
Same
---
Sometimes you get attacked by a teammate when you don‚Äôt save them even when you would have had a low chance of succeeding
---
Clown is my "main" Killer (I tend to vary a lot with characters though) and when playing as Survivor I find it rare to find matches where he is the Killer and I find that sad as he's so interesting.
---
Upvote just because it's a wind waker meme.
---
Killers also have to play longer than survivors who die.  I won't argue against a small bump, but there does have to be a large difference
---
I couldn't agree more. I recently watched his movie with two other friends and we were actually really impressed by how much we felt for him honestly. He seemed so incredibly sympathetic, even if deathly misdirected.
---
Yeah its always console players
---
I‚Äôd love to see the survivors complaints that their favorite perk doesn‚Äôt work as efficiently as it used too
---
It‚Äôs beautiful 
---
Same for shards.
---
The Terminator wouldn't for the theme of this game imo.
---
Exclusive content like this, over time, will make Deathgarden more popular. (Remember, it's still in beta).
---
Yo the new DLC map with daylight looks great!
---
The shading isn‚Äôt bad, but I can‚Äôt really tell where the light source is supposed to be. It kinda looks weird.
---
Otherwise, not bad.
---
Much agreed
---
Lol
---
Spirit: Franklins and NOED.
---
It always feels good
---
Are you ready to swear right here, right now, before The Entity?
---
Summertime it will happen
---
I want to see his/her face
---
Aw shoot, I‚Äôm touched and seriously appreciate it &lt;3
---
I‚Äôm @bvtterball on instagram!!
---
Except now the killer gets screwed out of an ability literally every match, and, like I said, might as well not even be in the game at that point. 
---
&gt;It guarantees that survivors do dull totems for a purpose. And if they dont do them, they get punished for it.
---
That... is literally part of what the risk in this game is, as NOED already is a risk (as to if the killer even has it or not and when the survivors should do totems) and should continue to be. I don't see the problem???
---
It's not out of context, but go off I guess, lmao.
---
It's gonna be everywhere, I will be laughing from the side lines
---
IIRC, you also get boldness points just by being near the killer, terror radius or not.
---
Myers should be down a rank IMO. I get no feeling he enjoys his kills besides one scene in his new remake movie (which I think is a shit movie either way besides Laurie's entire presence).
---
Adept Hunter sounds pretty useless tbh.
---
I think you shouldnt Limit yourself to thematic fitting perks, just look at the Legion. None of the perks fit with their theme
---
Very nice but I believe Behaviors wendigo is the the hag. I forget where I read it but it stuck to my head although it's not as in depth as your very long intro to wendigo history
---
I didn't realize the nurse had a Dwight skin
---
It is out of context cause you're not arguing the argument I made which is that there was no reason to cleanse that totem. By responding like this you look like you countered the argument while you actually just countered a point addition to a point I made that doesn't stand on its own. Very dishonest if you argue like this
---
Sprint Burst and Adrenaline are semi second chance perks that help people who first get into a game. 
---
Either they would be leftsd speeches or have a tantrum both would be fun to watch
---
i tried to do this but ace ended up fucking dying
---
WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE ACE
---
Uuhm they get that ability now for free
---
Seems that stuff like that happens a lot with any game
---
When the game gets rebalanced to be more fun and fair the toxic players will complain like how in cod when a gun got nerfed some players actually threatened one of the devs
---
Your mom
---
I'm confused if this is an actual license or not. It does say T-800 but it also says "inspired by" and doesn't seem to show any official branding? 
---
The same thing is said about the rest of them, so it's kinda factored out...
---
He may not have applied. Not to mention the community seems to have a massive distaste for him. 
---
Don't know what you mean (actually blind)
---
NO FAKKA YOU IT'S PINK
---
What if every time you were in a chase that sweet ass Sax solo from Miasma started playing? 
---
Bruh if you put some time into her on console you can get 4k's with ease. It just takes a lot of time, patience, and practice, and I don't think you've put in enough of those. Keep ya head up. It'll get better lol
---
I think it makes sense really. If it'll add more players to the game then it's a smart move. I wanted Terminator in DBD too but I understand this move
---
THAT'S NOT EVEN A FUCKING WORD
---
ITS FINK
---
they fuccin'
---
I just hope it‚Äôs not something like Legion or Pig where you have to compete a secondary objective (mending and freeing the trap respectively). The best powers imo are those which actively help the killer in killing the survivors or locating survivors such as trapper‚Äôs traps, clown‚Äôs bottles, Huntress‚Äô hatchets ect.
---
I‚Äôd really like to see the smoke used in some really cool way!
---
Give me your picture and I'll fuc.kin' put it on another list. I dare you
---
That would be great
---
IT'S PINKER THAN THAT ONE SHITTY TASTING SKITTLE
---
?
---
Remember when everyone was theorizing that The Spirit was gonna be the Slit Mouth Woman? I even watched the movie to prepare for it. So much hype. She was cool either way at least. 
---
Personally I HATE playing against Hag. She‚Äôs hard to see, her traps are usually everywhere, and if you don‚Äôt have a flashlight or urban evasion it‚Äôs such a pain. On the other hand, Billy and especially Michael are the most fun to play against, also a bad nurse can be super fun too.
---
This is easily the most controversial topic in dead by daylight
---
In what universe are any maps, besides Coal Tower, killer sided?
---
You've been gone a long time, honestly bloodweb tips aren't really a thing anymore. 
---
Even at level 50 they aren't the monstrous mazes they used to be and you can probably get through them in one game as Killer or two games as Survivor.
---
Tips I can offer: 
---
* If you have time read the patch notes on the dbd wiki: [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patches](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patches), there's been a TON of updates since you left and I'm bound to forget something here. :p
---
* The Exposed status effect means Survivors can be instantly downed. 
---
* The only way Exposed can be bypassed is through the Bill perk Borrowed Time, which gives Survivors who are unhooked in the Killer's Terror Radius a bleedout timer if they would get downed after being unhooked (the perk isn't infinite, it only lasts for 15\~ seconds after a Survivor is unhooked). If you are hit into Borrowed Time you can recover without Self-Care: stand still and you will get the option to Mend and enter the Injured state. If you don't Mend you will go down when the bleedout timer ends.
---
* Nurse isn't weak, she's one of the strongest Killers in the game because she can teleport through walls, pallets, and windows. If you face a Nurse try to act unpredictably so she can't Blink ahead of you. Your best bet against her is Stealth.
---
* Michael Myers gains power by looking at you. Don't let him stare at you. If he stares at Survivors long enough you will be Exposed for a varying period of time.
---
* Sometimes Michael can instantly kill Survivors. You will know if he can do this if his hand is open instead of in a fist while you are Exposed.
---
* Michael Myers and Amanda Young (The Pig) can have no or a very small Terror Radius. Until you know who the Killer is keep an eye out around you so you don't get surprised.
---
* Some Michael Myers will have add-ons that let them see you aura when you are close to them, so be careful around them. Fortunately for you if they can see your aura, they cannot make Survivors Exposed by staring at them and they are slightly slower than usual.
---
* Leatherface's chainsaw isn't like Hillbilly's. LF swings it wildly in the area around him and can follow you around objects while using his chainsaw for a period of time. Windows are the best way to avoid his saw but he can hit you through them if you're too close to the window.
---
* Freddy Krueger is a confusing Killer to face. While you're awake he is totally invisible, fortunately if you're near him you'll hear kids singing a lullaby, so don't be too worried about him sneaking up on you. If he tags you you'll start to fall asleep for 7 seconds. This transition might be shorter or faster depending on Freddy's add-ons. After you fall asleep all your actions are reduced by 50% and you will be able to see Freddy and hear his Terror Radius. Freddy will see your aura if you're asleep and outside his Terror Radius. To Wake Up you either have to miss a skillcheck while healing or working on a generator or you have to find a Survivor who is still awake and get them to wake you up. Sleeping Survivors have fuzzy circles around their icons in the bottom left corner, so as soon as someone is asleep you'll know.
---
* The Spirit is one of Dead by Daylight's newer Killers and also confusing to face. She is blue, with crazy hair, and looks badly mutilated. Her power allows her to move very quickly while invisible to Survivors, however in this state she can only see scratchmarks. While shes uses her power she leaves her body and terror radius behind at the place she was last standing. If you see this Killer standing still in a chase she is probably using her power to try to catch you, so try to stop running so you don't leave scratchmarks. If you hear a wooshing noise, like a vacuum cleaner sound, that means the Spirit is using her power near you. You won't hear this sound if you're within her Terror Radius.
---
* The Legion is another new Killer and are another confusing Killer to face. They look vaguely like Survivors with hoods and their power allows them to sprint and stab multiple people in a short frenzy. When using their power they can't see scratchmarks and any of their hits put you into a bleedout timer like Borrowed Time, which you can exit the same way as Borrowed Time's bleedout timer. The timer won't go down as long as Legion is in a chase with you, but if they exit chase you will have to Mend to avoid being downed.
---
* Totems are a thing now. They're a bundle of skulls and bones placed around. There are always five, sometimes they are dull and sometimes they are lit. Lit totems have fires underneath the skulls and are associated with a Hex, a special type of Killer perk with varying effects. Cleansing lit totems is usually a good idea since it removes a Killer's Hex perk from the game. Be careful about a certain Hex perks called Haunted Grounds, which spawns two lit totems and does nothing until it's totems are cleansed, but after being cleansed lets the Killer instantly down people. Dull totems don't have fires and are not associated with any Hex. Cleansing them removes them but does nothing except give you bloodpoints.
---
* Hex: Ruin is a very common perk used by Killers. It turns generator skillchecks red and causes good skillchecks to regress the generator's progress. If you notice this happening to you on generators it's best to keep working on the generator and try to hit great skillchecks rather than searching the map for the lit totem associated with Ruin.
---
* BBQ and Chili is another very common Killer perk. When a Killer hooks someone this perk reveals the aura of Survivors who are far away from the hooked Survivor. You can counter this perk by entering a locker before the Killer hooks someone as your aura cannot be revealed while you are in a locker.
---
* The Killer perk No One Escapes Death is a hex now and is still popular. You can prevent it from activating if you disable all the totems in the game (even the dull ones). There is no way to tell if the Killer has this perk until the end of the game, so sometimes it can be a smart idea to cleanse all 5 totems.
---
* There are a lot less pallets now and you cannot rely on the pallet vacuum to help you. In fact there will be a lot of times you will get through pallets as the Killer is stunned. In general it is a good idea to use pallets sparingly and only if it stuns the Killer or it is necessary to keep you from being downed.
---
* Brand New Parts were nerfed. They only repair 25% of a generator when installed.
---
* When attempting to blind a Killer with a flashlight you should aim at their head, not at their chest.
---
* Leader no longer effects generator repair, but it's speed increase to other actions was buffed dramatically.
---
* Prove Thyself now increases the speed at which generators are repaired when you work with other Survivors.
---
* Sabotaged hooks will respawn after 3 minutes. A Killer perk called Hangman's Trick can shorter this time considerably.
---
* Some Killers and Survivors have Obsession perks. You will know if they do because one Survivor, the Obsession, will have white Entity claws around their icon. These Obsession perks vary wildly in their effects but it is important to note if you are the Obsession, since you will usually be a Killer's primary target if you are. You will know if the Obsession is in a chase because the Entity claws will wiggle while they are being chased. If you are the Obsession and can see the Killer's aura when generators are completed (unless you're using Dark Sense) it means the Killer has Rancor and will be able to instantly down and Kill you once all the generators are finished.
---
There are plenty of more things I'm sure I've missed and more than a few Killers I've neglected to mention but this list is too long enough. :p I hope you're able to get some use out of it.
---
I hope you have fun returning to Dead by Daylight. :)
---
I had that totem spawn right near a gen on huntress map last night. Only reason I found the totem is cause the killer kept running over there  even after the gen was finished.

Not everything is added yet (hence why I said WIP photo). Gonna glue some fur on the snout, add more fur on the other side of the head, attach both ears, trim all the fur and style it, paint the horns/tusks and weather them and eventually add the jewelry :3
---
is that me in every game

Nice can you fix shit like teleporting because killers are running 486sx computers and pressed a button like attack? Srsly it removes skill form the equation more than legions power does.
---
You'll just get a blank photo

It is the most efficient way to deliver pizza

I USED THE COLOUR SELECTOR. THE COLOUR IS FUCKING SHIRAZ

The Game has far too many safe pallets to be considered killer sided.

It's so bad I don't even know what perk that is.

You're totally right. Honestly I totally forgot about how nasty the Houses on Springwood can be.
---
I was just biased because I've gotten 5 stacks of Devour Hope on that map 3 times. :p
---
absolutely not. No matter what he will say gg at the end of every game, the only time he will be mad, it will just be about game design and not really about him being toxic.
---
you are being an absolute bullshit artist.
---
I knew my paint Skills would pay off!
---
Thanks :D
---
I think she killed them after the entity gave her power
---
The greater problem with Ruin IMO isn't that it just regresses the gen, but ALSO stops all gen progress for 2 seconds if you can't get the great as well.  I'd be fine with it if it was just the regression honestly.   
---
Yeah for real man, it's sad how desperate this community is to make everyone out as toxic. The streamers I mentioned almost always go out of there way to play polite, giving no.4 hatch, not slugging, not tunneling etc. (these things aren't even toxic), yet you have people calling them nasty shitheads, what a joke.
---
Not only white, IIRC she's french! 
---
You‚Äôre a sick fuck
---
While playing killer can net you more points in a game, survivors have the ability to go through games faster than killer. It would be interesting if someone calculated how many bp they can get in, say, two hours on both sides.
---
What do you mean?
---
Fair, but some of the trickiest totems end up near gens in other maps that people don‚Äôt see because the gen ends up the primary area focus
---
Nurse Mains = Virgins
---
Freddy Mains = Chads
---
Susie was 100% against murder and Frank quite literally forced her hand when killing the janitor. With this theme going she was probably tortured into submission by the entity so she would do it's bidding.

---
I highly disagree with the new snow map and new spirit map being survivor sided. They're no more in favor of the survivors than any other Macmillan map. 
---
Wtf are you talking about Panda has been a great ambassador for this game and has had a huge impact in the positive with the community. Tyde is also good but has said some completely stupid stuff, like the nurse being underpowered and then having flare 2v prove that someone who hadn‚Äôt played the game in 6 months can completely wreck high skilled survivors with her. Not saying Tyde shouldn‚Äôt be a whisperer but Panda is way more deserving than a few others who are. 
---
Because on the survivor side you had to effectively predict the killer was about to walk through it ahead of time thanks to latency always working in the killers favor other than the lag speed amp bug that effectively makes you usain bolt so long as it is a strait away.
---
Damn it I meant 2 gens lol
---
I'm on PC though. I'm just not the best at backrevving. ;-;
---
I do dull totems for the easy blood points and the fact the killer probably has noed. 
---
It may be in beta, but it has like 10 players 90% of the time.
---
I recently turned them back on ;) always fun telling them to get some water to get rid of the salt
---
CORRECT.
---
PINK IS THE ONLY WORD
---
FROM NOW ON I SHALL BE USING PROFANITY AND PINK AS THE ONLY FORM OF LANGUAGE
---
Bill isn't nearly that sad, while he was left for dead, we can assume that he was taken before the zombies ripped him apart and he gets continue fighting.
---
Bill went out like a fuckin' bill
---
He‚Äôs only as easily looped as the player allows, and in good hands his power can be devastating. It‚Äôs really not all that much that has to go his way, and he doesn‚Äôt need to snowball into the finish every time he pops EW3. (Although it‚Äôs more than possible if you slug properly)
---
Michael indeed deserves to be placed as a low high tier killer, he‚Äôs a very interesting character with a solid base kit that essentially gives him temporary NOED, and has extreme variety when it comes to perks, and he‚Äôs the only killer to possess two VERY strong ultra rare addons.
---
YOU CAN HAVE FUCKING PINK AS A WORD AND NOT FUCKING RED! ITS SHIRAZ!
---
/shrug
---
I treat the map the same as the Asylum. That juicy building in the middle with a sort of dead area around it. Then you have your average tiles surrounding. 
---
I have not had many issues with that map as any other killer, personally. 
---
I've seen quite a few decent dwights running leader and prove thyself, we've rushed hella gens
---
Had a group come down after a game and sacrafice their toolboxes to the great basement god, had a good laugh at that 
---
The Game is tiny and as a result it's very easy for a Killer to control generators. It's also very hard for Survivors to tell where a Killer is on the map based on Terror Radius. The Game is fucking cancer for Nurse though due to all the stupidily large map props making dead zones for blinking. It's also bad for Billy because of how small it is, Huntress because of the lack of lockers to restock hatchets at, and Trapper because the bright white floor makes it super easy to see traps.
---
While Corn is extremely obnoxious to deal with most of the Coldwind maps are "balanced" around shitloads of corn instead of places to actually juke. If you can actually fucking see through the corn you can easily chase a Survivor through it since there are no pallets or vaults to juke you at. Thompson House is probably the most corn filled but Torment Creek has practically no corn and Fractured Cowshed is somewhat lax on corn. TH has a lot of unsafe gens though, and FC / TC are rather lacking in good juke spots. Rancid Abattoir has like no corn as the map is mostly occupied by a giant building that has fuck all inside of it to juke the Killer with.
---
Damn you, using my favorite killer and one of my favorite comedians.
---
NOED needs to go because it's rewards facecamping, period. Survivors barely have enough time to do gens during a hard camp, let alone totems too. 
---
The hallowed blight event was a total shit show for a reason. Additional objectives absolutely do not work in this game 
---
Agree that main building is very easy to chase through. The map really favors stealth over chasing which is maybe why I find it so obnoxious, since finding Survivors is the harder part for me. The map is extremely lacking in pallets and vaults but makes up for it with the insane excess of hiding spots.
---
I totally understand. &lt;3
---
* My issue with Rancid Abattoir is that the big ass building is also a safe window loop that is within running distance of the Killer Shack and the Cow Tree. A Survivor can run you around that map for quite a while if they know what they're doing. There are also no good totem spawn points on that map; they're all either near generators or loops. 
---
* I'll agree about Family Estate though. Unless you have good tracking/the Survivors are bad at hiding, you'll have to go for the brutal Main House 3-gen to win that map as Killer.

Everybody‚Äôs arguing over whether it‚Äôs red or pink and my friends are out arguing if the uncommon items are brown or grey.

"Ultimately, she saw now that she had been right in the choices she had made. The time for games was over. There was no chance of redemption for any of them. They were meat, and meat was destined to die."
---
That is her DbD back story, she sees the entity taking her as a blessing and gets to kill without the puzzles in the way.
---
But you are Claudette with the darkest clothes on so... I can‚Äôt be sympathetic 
---
You'd think they'd be smart enough to cut their losses when the toilet they were flushing money down got clogged.
---
Enjoyed the anime but will admit some parts I had to pause and nope away from as my stomach was not having it. Mostly the tongue and eye stuff.
---
I think you can find this information on the wiki. But, keep in mind the strength of something goes: slightly &gt; moderately &gt; considerably &gt; tremendously, if that helps at all.
---
If I remember correctly, the devs said they're purposely vague about these details.
---
Who tf actually watches tyde time lol
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if a fellow survivor is acting as a radar for the killer to get us all
---
Jesus huntress is way too low, and Myers should be bumped up one or 2 tiers. I mean Myers below LF? Below legion? Fat oof.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the frame rate can get pretty bad, and the sensitivity isn‚Äôt mouse sensitivity but that‚Äôs not an excuse to put huntress so low. Unless you‚Äôre playing on a day one Xbox one and your TV looks like a PowerPoint presentation, it‚Äôs not the console that‚Äôs causing you to underperform as huntress.
---
Meme or ree? Tis the question
---
The amount of times Huntresses get me with my own tricks... ugh. This x 10000
---
If that was happening for an hour how isnt the bleed out timer almost gone? 
---
Your story and clip only show 2 people dead and 2 alive. So from what you're saying survivor B lead killer to survivor C+D by being downed. That leaves you survivor A as a helper healing the guy being downed. Sorry but your story sounds fishy and you cant say "I didnt time it" but claim it was an hour. Sorry but you probably helped and dont wanna be shamed 
---
I‚Äôll probably die from excitement if papa Nihil is the new killer.
---
Well it‚Äôs the smallest map in the game and allows slower killers to be more effective and mobile characters to get around quicker. 
---
Little bunny
---
My head canon is that when Philip found out that he was being used to execute who knows how many people his mind broke and Philip was no more, and so the entity took the Wraith and not Philip.
---
Thanks mate :)
---
What?? Sure thing buddy. This post completely went over your head.
---
Guess you will never get that stick out, huh?
---
:o
---
Killer mains, unite!
---
The devs have said he was intended to be the guy everyone would be rooting for to get killed off in a horror movie
---
The Nurse blink ones were hard for me as someone who doesn't play Nurse really at all
---
Bleedout timer isnt long enough to get two survivors even with using unbreakable the timer should've been down. You can try to argue the statement but it's pretty clear you helped at this point 
---
And, O irony, he died fixing a generator.
---
LMAO, you're that little bitchboy who was crying about a 2 day ban, ahaha. 
---
It ended up being the hatch one most because I don't have any mates who play the game
---
Congrats!
---
I played against a Wraith tonight using a similar Mad Grit build. It was both hilarious and difficult to play against. 
---
Lmao stop trying to guess what happened why would I post a video of a survivor and killer working together then complain about it if I was actually the one helping?? See how your rant makes no sense? Stop reaching for the stars and accept the post for what it is
---
Anyone here a Kate main cuz I sure am
---
He actually did. But got denied. His hypothesis is that it is because he's not the most optimistic guy when talking about the state of the game.
---
I actually enjoy to watch him stream (not only DBD). He's quite chill, and i enjoy that.
---
I can't wait until the DS change, no more DS just because the survivor doesn't want to go on the hook before they've ever been hooked.
---
Lol wtf was I supposed to do both gates were open and noed was gone.  Also I needed a sacrifice daily done with Spirit so lol.
---
Aye, I was saving that Mirror for days and then a Lery's FINALLY came up in my bloodweb... I load in, smack a Meg and then BAM, two disconnects.
---
thankfully the remaining survivors were willing to meme with me, so it lessened the blow a little bit!
---
Right up there with Deja Who?
---
Id say theyre red too
---
Zombieland saga season 2 new character
---
It's from a map bud.
---
Used to help fellow survivors with locating things like gens or the hatch. 
---
Oops 
---
All good  :)
---
Notice how he talks and how the others talk, Idc if people agree with me or not.
---
Sad thing is, you just wrote an essay about complete bs over the internet. Get a life mate
---
Thank you so much!!!
---
Definitely on the REE spectrum
---
Honestly shards I don't kind at all. 
---
Before I know it I have enough for a new shrine perk. 
---
Now I do admit though that for me it feels fast enough if I have enough to unlock one perk before it changes.
---
If the scale was to unlock all four then yeah way too slow for that. 
---
I don't main killer but I certainly found out the hard way what iridescent was hahaha
---
Best bunny
---
say it with me now... HOT PINK
---
Dude I still remember reading The Passing comic on the Valve Website and crying.
---
I miss when Valve gave a shit about their games. The story, comics, *ugh* man. I‚Äôd love a Left 4 Dead 3
---
Is that the trophy for getting all other trophies?
---
I followed him from Smite to DBD. Hes the reason i'm in this community.  
---
Everybody gangsta til the totems start walking
---
I‚Äôm surprised no one took your post seriously yet and wrote a full essay about why you‚Äôre wrong, is this actually reddit?
---
What does p3 mean
---
Black Box shouldn't really be F, it's really good in some situations.
---
Clown*
---
He'd probably make a mean bloody mary, but I wouldn't trust him near my Chef boyardee. lol
---
Wait there is more to deathgarden than stormtroopers wearing tuna cans? They made a DLC for that abortion?
---
I did consider putting him on tier 2, I honestly regret my decision. Like his handy work with knives is beautiful. I'd love for him to make sushi. lol
---
I did this for the first half of tonight too just hoping everyone 2x as spirit and never dropped below 3 pip rank 2. If nothing else it IS kinda nice that you pretty much have to try to depip and the process would take forever. Less people with the patience to smurf that way. 
---
something similar happened to me when i was playing spirit, i was getting kind of messed up by this group of survivors but that's on me. then after the gens get done and stuff, everyone starts escaping and i see that the hatch is opened, a dwight starts running towards the hatch, i begin phasing and RIGHT at the hatch, i come out of phase walking AND AS EVERYONE HAD ESCAPED, THE DWIGHT GETS GRABBED FROM THE HATCH AND GETS CARRIED TO A HOOK. it was wonderful and i laughed for a while.
---
They should really just add the hidden passive of Black Box to its text. "Increase obsession's chance of spawning next to another survivor by %100"
---
Very good! Make sure to sign your work though! I see a lot of art from reddit stolen and pasted elsewhere without credit given. 
---
I mean he did it because his parents hated him and kept him locked up his whole life, so i'd say he fits the tier. He murders, but he's still pretty sympathetic
---
Get better at dodging flashlights‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs really easy and you won‚Äôt have to waste a perk. Or use lightborn it‚Äôs even better than knocked out.
---
Yeah, it's pretty bad &amp; kind of frustrating. 
---
**fFFtZzztTt!**
---
Although it's hilarious when I blindly throw hatchets through the corn and hit claudettes.... I actually find I win quite a few games lower ranks on Coldwind especially when survivors get lost in the corn... 
---
Can I have a link to original image; for research purposes of course 
---
oh god i had to watch it a second time to see, ffffffffffff
---
That's a bold statement.
---
Black Box is easily removed (if the obsession just happens to spawn next to another survivor or a generator, you're out an ultra-rare, 7k bloodpoint add-on that literally does nothing for the rest of the match). It needs to be buffed somehow.
---
I enjoy the game wayyy better trying to stay out of red ranks tbh. Neither I nor nobody I know really enjoy playing in red.
---
Ok so I need to rant about this. I played nurse for a daily and downed this guy like 4 times but I didn‚Äôt hook him as I wanted to let everyone escape and just do my daily. Admittedly I kinda suck as nurse but whatever. After the game I say gg and joke how I‚Äôm glad my daily is done. I get flooded with these 2 shitheads saying how I don‚Äôt need to make the daily excuse cause they know I just suck and needed to stop being a bitch. Pretty rich calling me bad from the guy I DELIBERATELY let go and I could have killed him multiple times. It annoyed me more than it should.
---
Yeah, the window in Abitoir is probably the safest loop in the game.
---
Yeah I just look up.
---
One time I was playing LF and someone blinded me by my peripheral vision while I was carrying someone, just straight up bull.
---
Nobody said anything about survivors, though. It sounds like you're just salty DS is going to get nerfed hard like it deserves to be.
---
Xbox. 
---
I was playing on Pale Rose. I was near the killer shack, and just came out of the basement there. I went outside, Wraith chased and hooked a teammate in front of the building. I unhooked Ace, got hit while unhooking. While finishing unhooking so Ace could get away, I used Dead Hard to negate the second hit. It launched me towards the chest that spawns outside shack, and wedged me behind it. I was stuck behind the chest and the log. 
---
About an hour later I got the map again with the same configuration. Similar situation but against Michael, and I tried the Dead Hard in the same area. Sucked me right back into the gap behind the chest. 
---
I can‚Äôt really give you percentages, but I can give you this:
---
Slightly+slightly=moderately 
---
Moderately+slightly=Considerably
---
Considerably+slightly=Tremendously 
---
So it could help you a little if you want to stack stuff. Like Mist for example 
---
There really is no in between,  and it's crazy. If you wanna get your team mates killed,  why not play as killer? That's what I don't understand. People just try to ruin anything fun. 
---
Shhhhhhhhhhh. 
---
I like that there was nothing else said about Freddy besides ‚Äúno‚Äù. This guy has no redeeming qualities.
---
It is,  especially when you've already had a bad night against killers. Just to have team mates be worse.
---
"the Entity thought it would be pretty cool to have a guy with a bell and an axe made out of a spine" I love the idea of the Entity picking his killers by just being like "yeah this guy seems pretty cool"
---
red tier is for bee
---
The Game is actually a pretty terrible killer map nowadays. Every pallet is safe and it just comes down to if the survivor is good enough to run them. I'd argue Shelter Woods with its 3 pallets is probably one of the best killer maps.
---
Imagine taking the game this seriously and still be in rank 15
---
Because he is pure evil, that's how it's explained in the films. He has no motivation. He just kills.
---
I feel like Nurse would rather choke me to death than be friends with me.
---
Fair enough. The whole idea behind doing this though was to make something somewhat thematically fitting. I'll also openly admit I was less interested in making perks for the Wendigo than making the ability, as perks have a lot more restrictions to them (you have to consider them in a lot more contexts than you do with abilities).
---
I agree that Adept Hunter is kinda trash. The goal with the other two was to make definitively ok perks, ones that are fun, but not top tier nor trash. In contrast adept hunter is kind of universally as described. I could see it being useful on occasion (someone running from a gen when their spine chill shows you're coming is a good example of when it would be useful), but overall it's probably not worth a perk slot.
---
its more of HEAUGH HEA HEEA
---
Where you playing as wraith for most of it? Cause I think I played against you as a Bill.
---
An additional issue I've had repeated on Xbox involves The Game map. 
---
Multiple times lately I've been the last survivor alive, or I've had a skeleton key with the hatch available but not yet open. 
---
This problem is specifically when the hatch spawns in the all the way back corner of the map. It refuses to let me enter the hatch or use the skeleton key. The prompt does not appear. 
---
I did the SAME one day as the huntress! But they kept running from me,  to the point where I got so annoyed I killed them. LOL. I try to be nice,  and they just kept running around the same rock, and waiting to pallet stun me. I was like oh okay, that's how this is going. I let one person go,  since they seen what I was clearly trying to do. The other guy said I sucked because he wiggled free twice,  uh duh. I let you RIGHT beside my hex totem both times,  take the hint! 
---
Good point, the hag does share many similarities lorewise and visually. The ability feels very disconnected from that idea though (though I think it's thematically fantastic for a southern witch voodoo-type black magic).
---
Yikes, hag is so frustrating to play against if she‚Äôs good.
---
Nurse is the funnest to me because I‚Äôm on ps4, and due to that fact, nurses on ps4 usually are just average and you will be able to juke them Making the chases very intense, persistent and engaging, because they‚Äôre always a cm away from hitting you.
---
I used to follow the Blogs and updates all the time in Middleschool. The website was pretty cool, and I even still have the roaring Tank Plushie I bought, still roars.
---
Left 4 Dead 2 was when you saw it start to go downhill. The website was more basic, there weren‚Äôt as many comics/content as the first one and most of it was run by the Community, like most of Steam anyways.
---
Sad, really üò•
---
Fuck that map. Seriously. 
---
Don‚Äôt forget cancer, you gotta stay canon wit those comics 
---
I'm surprised they didn't disconnect
---
I saw someone suggest a rework that sounded good. So however many dull totems are left affect it‚Äôs strength so I think something like 5 dulls left exposed no timer, 4 dulls exposed 2 minutes, 3 dulls left 90 seconds, 2 dulls left 1 minute, and 1 dull left 30 seconds.
---
I got so lucky getting this out of the way. Had a 30k daily for Freddy and figured I'd try. First 3 people DC on first down and I chased the 4th around the map before killing them. Wasn't a real 4k and didn't even hit merciless but still got it lol. Granted weird matchmaking put me against rank 13s at rank 6, but still.
---
I always see a lot of disconnects on console
---
Oh my god yeah it‚Äôs so annoying. Like how dumb does that guy have to be. I could have killed him multiple times but I let his teammates heal him. Like I‚Äôm aware I suck as nurse I basically exclusively play survivor but they were so mean about it. Should have just killed them.
---
Wow, I thought i'd find a Nightmare on Sesame Street joke here.
---
You said survivors.. 
---
Not really. I don‚Äôt use DS. Just tired of killers crying at every little thing that survivors have as if they don‚Äôt have their own overpowered perks. 
---
No, it's only downed survivor's ranges. They can always see their aura otherwise, just not when they're downed.
---
This picture needs some [digital enhancement](http://needsmorejpeg.com/i/yZekj).
---
Maybe his friend bodyblocked the hook?
---
ARE YOU ON THE LEVEL?
---
If you down a survivor, other survivors out of a 32/24/16 meter range will not see the downed survivor's aura.
---
Why you shouldn‚Äôt listen to music while playing this game.
---
As of writing, there is a total of 2 people playing within the last hour, and 10 people have played within the last 24 hours.  oof
---
I like playing as killer occasionally,  and I'm by far not great but I'm not terrible either. I usually kill 3 of them,  but 2 or them end up being dcs. It's seriously annoying! If a killer lets me wiggle free,  I immediately hope or assume they want to do a little farming. Which is refreshing sometimes,  not every match but every so many it's great. 
---
just make it so you start off fully healed, but when you get smacked you can't be healed until you get hooked. Also hide the no healing for killer. There now it's still crap but a little less.
---
Amen brother. L4D 2 pistols suck

But then Tru3Ta1ent is a FW...
---
My guess is because he has previously, albeit briefly, quit DBD.
---
some people want that
---
WORDS DONT EXIST GET YOUR SHIT-RAZ OUTTA HERE
---
I‚Äôd put doctor upper mid tier and put nurse in lower mid tier, if not in low tier
---
Is there a reason why you should go for the higher tier perks?
---
NOT UNTIL YOU ACCEPT THAT THE ULTRA RARES ARE COLOURED SHIRAZ!!!
---
This helped a ton, thank you! If you think of anything else please let me know these were all super useful!
---
nah he was ripped apart by 3 tanks, it's like that picture of the white girl with 6 large black men but the little white girl was an old man and the 6 guys were 3 fucking tanks
---
Same. I was nervous as hell when I posted this. lol
---
THEY ARE NOT
---
THEY ARE! I CHECKED MULTIPLE SPOTS ITS ALL SHIRAZ!
---
I can't find a good workshop replacement for them
---
Nope, he is brutally and painfully slaughtered by the 3 tanks in the generator room. However his body is still in contact so he didn‚Äôt get eaten alive. But don‚Äôt forget he also was a veteran with ptsd, cancer, and just general survivor‚Äôs guilt expressed in the L4D comics.
---
I'm going to start working towards some of these perks now. Thanks for the info!
---
True, it makes no sense. But then how would the Terminator work in DBD?
---
Oh man! I almost forgot about the soul pizza scene. Didn't yellow shit come out of their heads when he poked them? It's been forever since I saw that one. Dream Warriors was my favorite
---
\&gt;implying ochido has fans
---
who the fuck down voted you
---
Yeah. I play killer probably 20% of the time, and most of that time I‚Äôm playing as my boy Myers. I feel like I‚Äôve been running into way too many toxic players lately. I ran into a Freddy that, after killing me, in broken English told me how garbage I am and that I should quit lmao. 
---
The survivor was not slugged, the killer down them so they could see others and then probably let them wiggle or dribble them so they'd show where the rest were. That's my wild guess.
---
The dlc is called "the Terminator Set". It's an actual license
---
the rake
---
inb4 someone makes a joke about leafs 
---
It fits into the criteria for ‚Äúfan content‚Äù. 
---
Tyde still plays the game? He was moaning how much he hates it every update
---
It's dead.
---
Barely anyone plays it, and because barely anyone plays it, no one bothers to try it.
---
When your average playerbase sits at about a dozen people IN THE WHOLE WORLD, there's no saving your game.
---
Remember, when DBD first launched, it had around 11k players.
---
Yes. You get a platinum trophy once you got every trophies in a game.
---
Third seal?
---
I had a similar thing happen to me once, I ended up dcing after i figured out what was going on. It sucks ;/
---
This happens to me all the times and it's always absurd and makes you kind of like... Well, I was trying to be nice but okay, I guess I won't do that in the future?
---
I'm probably in the minority, liking the remake Freddy. Very disturbing and menacing.
---
It plays the T2 music in menus, so it is officially licensed. But after Genisys, the Terminator license ain't worth much.
---
Ehehehe 
---
Congratulations!!
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
Pretty sure that isnt possible to code, it seems for the devs, but i could be impossible or the devs dont give a damm....for now ! 
---
Once they said they'd only include things that wouldn't confuse survivors, futuristic killer robots could confuse the older Gen ones.
---
This was a comment towards something like beings from another universe or aliens
---
It's not really a remake. It's a sequel to the original, where none of the other sequels happened. Myers has been locked up for 40 years after the original.
---
There is already a perk that affects skill check size and frequency, and that's Unnerving Presence. Why make overwhelming presence affect skill check size when another perk is more suited for 1 pixel skill checks?
---
Yea I‚Äôll play with you add me my psn is Galllade.
---
Killer on console is terrible, the framerate and controls make it so easy to be juked. And survivors know this and taunt you. 
---
As if people playing with their friends is the reason everybody hates SWF.
---
&gt;Freddy higher than pig.
---
Can confirm. Also survivor main and I try to be as nice as possible.
---
Oh god! I‚Äôm sorry that a basic game mechanic makes you mad.
---
I just want a sci fi killer like a robot
---
I agree with this. I also notice people are camping the hatch and letting peope die to get it. If im not camping the 3rd kill you can go save them. For more context in this instance 1 gen was left and 2 survivors my bbq and chilli said they were coming towards the hooked survivor and then suddenly they weren't and as soon as they died the hatch was used. Kinda lame. 
---
sorry didnt know which order in each tier mattered 
---
" But lately surviors have been MUCH WORSE " ....you dont play a lot Killer dont you ?  Tunneling and random dcs by the killer is fine, but unhooking in front of the killer, injured idiots leading him to you because they are garbage at running in circles and other shits Suv. do to OTHER SUV. os ridiculous ....not gonna speak about the abuse from these "people" against the killer. 
---
I won't play survior unless I am playing with at least one of my friends,  and not because I want to gen rush and destroy every game but because if not you'll literally die on your first hook most of them time. It's ridiculous, and to me that's toxic as well unless the killer is camping of course. I have messaged killers rudely before over random reasons like face camping,  but I also tell good killers gg. I don't even care if we all get killed,  I like a challenge. Especially a good Micheal Myers is my favorite. I agree,  a lot is probably people under 18. Espcially when they non stop cuss you,  I'm like oh ok I know,  you're 13. LOL. 
---
Possibly literally.
---
Yeah, usually it's left to right
---
Left being the closest to whatever that tier is (I.e. nurse being S would be close than Billy because she's better). 
---
I think we can all agree Freddy is the worst tho.
---
This isn't allowed and when AngryPug deliberately pointed out shitty teammates in lockers to a random killer using bond, he was banned for 24 hours for it.
---
Got this the other night, it was the definition of luck. 2 man swf party and a noob nurse and I was close enough to see when they popped the hatch, had my fingers crossed the other guy was going to find the hatch.
---
Congrats man, currently working towards this and I know the nurse ones will be hard af
---
"Thrill of the Hunt" its called "Thrill of the Hunt" :D and yes feel free to feel complimented it was not had any bad intend behind, just welcome back ! 
---
I said: just because the survivor doesn't want to go on the hook before they've ever been hooked.
---
That has nothing to do with "any little thing survivors have". DS is getting nerfed, as it should be.
---
:thinking: INTeresting i think it's also against twitch guidelines
---
I never understood the fun of dragging out a game by making the killer wait on you.
---
I wasn't on about the perk lol... üíÄüôÑ I just meant I like chasing and stabby stabby
---
So do you actually have to finish two gens yourself or can you use it if 2 gens get done? Im a killer main so i dont really know. 
---
She needs it ü§£
---
That‚Äôs amazing

---
Looks more like this is the chat between another survivor he played with and spectated after himself escaping/dying...?
---
This is PRECISELY how it works for me too.
---
This is probably the only kind of cosmetic that would make me wanna play as Dwight.
---
This works the other way around as well. I don't have a problem not escaping if you're a facecamping asshole and I can ruin your time.
---
There was a Hillbilly who was literally facecamping the first guy he found with his chainsaw revving the entire time. However pointing and teabagging got him mad enough to come after me. I ran him around for 5 generators while teabagging him at every single pallet and then got downed from NOED (figures).
---
I obviously got facecamped to death. But 3 people escaped, the asshole had like 10k points and safety pipped at best. And while he probably got a boner from facecamping me to death he probably had a terrible time which makes it worth it. 
---
Personally, I love ruin because I get to show off my great skill check moves while the baby survivors keep missing until they quit to go look for the totem.
---
That's right default Claudette, leave the skill checks for REAL men
---
It's the best defense against the "It's Pink" crowd
---
[Accurate](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/8myafc/how_they_think_it_is_vs_how_it_really_is/) 
---
But a survivor dying before the game ends usually gets them around 10k because they probs didn't max out bold/altru/obj yet and they are missing the survival points. You can run more games, but getting into a game even without queue takes up a lot of time (out of match screen, into character screen, into lobby, waiting in lobby, loading into game). Unless killer queue times are long, playing killer is always more efficient, because all the extra time in the game is just giving you more points if you play killer (whereas as surv you are likely to get fewer points in the same time). 
---
There could have been an arrangement under the table when they came to terms over Behavior's departure. That's what the OP is saying and it's plausible. 
---
We need a "Damn it Myers" flair.
---
That's a little hostile; I'm proposing a friendly situation to ensure that a teammate isn't getting a free escape at the expense of their team, and giving a chance for the killers to feel less 'shafted' from their 4ks because someone managed to hide until their team is gone. I'm not necessarily crying over it moreso offering a quality of life improvement for both sides. there's no reason to be rude about it! ouo
---
Doc, Pig, Trapper, and Legion all have their special spot in my book
---
Quite true, it's literally the same when I hook someone and they get unhooked not even 5 seconds later when I head away / search the surrounding areas. Of course I'll hit them again.
---
Then they cry of tunneling the injured survivor and ignoring the healthy one that's bodyblocking.
---
Like, I'm not stupid.
---
Survivors in a nutshell lol
---
Toxic Huntress bonus points for: NOED, tunneling off hook, beating the crap out of survivors on hook, and for calling someone an "attention whore" when they're a twitch streamer.
---
Pure art omg
---
Yeah, i just got the typical WGLF instant unhook and got tunneled off it twice.
---
Nope!
---
The Hatch will become visible ("spawn") whenever the number of fully repaired Generators exceeds the number of living Survivors by 1:
---
4 Survivors remaining: 5 repaired Generators / Exit Gates are powered
---
3 Survivors remaining: 4 repaired Generators / 1 Generator left
---
2 Survivors remaining: 3 repaired Generators / 2 Generators left
---
1 Survivor remaining: 2 repaired Generators / 3 Generators left
---
So no matter who does the majority of work on the team or has the most blood points, the last survivor alive will get the hatch, even if they spent the whole game rotating around to hide in lockers. 
---
I actually started laughing. What a financially brilliant move.
---
Freaky epic
---
Not gonna lie, that's pretty amazing. I'd *kill* for a Spirit figure :)
---
You think they asked for this!!!?
---
This sub is a suck fest for righteous killers. It‚Äôs hilarious. 
---
Depending on how close to release it was, I bet they didn't have time to scrap the idea and come up with another in a reasonable time frame. Better to release it and pull in some revenue rather than delay it, piss off everyone, and make no money whatsoever in the process.
---
But I could be entirely wrong. And besides, the game is pretty much dead anyway. At least on PS4.
---
Right, because an ultra-rare offering is totally a legit counterpoint to something I encounter every other match.
---
Damn, Imagine gow much fun they would have together
---
&gt;but he's beforehand a guy who cares about his YouTube channel and his subscribers
---
Where else would he get money from? And if his fans were really fans for him, and not his earrape in a game they like/love, why hasn't he moved on to one where he can actually play? Oh right, because people watch him for that, not his personality, because it's really goddamned toxic
---
Yes! At least wait until I walk away. Because I will. But if I see someone walk past as soon as I turn from the hook, yes I'm going to hit them. 
---
That doesn't change the incoming issue that we will now be pallet stunned from much further away, because it's no longer client side that decides whether you were under it or not, but server side, meaning that if the server thinks you're anywhere near the pallet, you will be stunned by it, regardless of where you ACTUALLY are
---
Also
---
&gt;you had to effectively predict the killer was about to walk through it ahead of time 
---
Isn't that how it SHOULD be? That you SHOULD take a risk with pallets, rather than net an easy 1K bloodpoints for minimal effort?
---
Only problem is the fucking totems in the middle of nowhere
---
Wosh?
---
The saddest part is that you need five to start a game
---
Not trying to start shit but if you define tunneling as being hyper focused on finishing off a specific survivor despite being presented with other targets how is that different from a survivor being chased off a generator that‚Äôs 99% done and coming back to it as soon as they can rather than starting on a different generator that‚Äôs been untouched? Both parties are just trying to complete their objectives in the most efficient way possible. 
---
Camping I‚Äôll agree is just pure cancer. 
---
I feel bad for bing bong boy. He may have killed, but really, he was tricked into doing it, and was filled with rage and sadness when he learned it. He's probably the most relatable killer in the cast
---
Unnerving reduces Good zones but Great zones stay the same, there's more focus on getting Greats
---
I quit after nurse came out too! And I got back into it again a few weeks before pig came out. 
---
I would read up on totems. They were confusing to me when I got back into it. But they‚Äôre actually pretty straight forward. Familiarize yourself with killer hex‚Äôs. 
---
They nerfed exhaustion perks so you can no longer recover/reset your sprint burst while running. 
---
Back when the game first came out, I remember sabotaging hooks was an encouraged thing for survivors. Now it‚Äôs a total waste of time. Hooks respawn after like 30-60 or so after being sabo‚Äôd. 
---
Basically, survivors have been nerfed very hard since the game came out. There are still plenty of people who can play survivor and run the killer around all day, but it‚Äôs tougher. Even though I‚Äôm not *amazing* at the game I am still a survivor main and have tons of fun with it. 
---
Also, grinding shards to unlock DLC is not very practical. Some customs require 11k shards, that‚Äôs like 3 or 4 DAYS of gameplay. If you have the time to do that, great. I prefer to put shards towards the shrine to get extra blood points though because I‚Äôm working to triple prestige all my survivors. 
---
Good luck!!
---
No u
---
We‚Äôre talking about biggest crutch
---
SWF&gt;NOED&gt;Decisive for like another week lol.
---
I hate when people do this. Like if I‚Äôm about to go into struggle or if you‚Äôve got borrowed time then I‚Äôll allow it but otherwise your just farming me for points and ruining all our chances of getting out. Of course the killers gonna bonk me back down again because he‚Äôd basically be stupid not to. 
---
*ITS RED!* *I SAID IT* &gt;:(
---
A leatherface not planning on camping won't be using insidious, and as such has no advantage in keeping their chainsaw unrevved. Trying to rescue against a revved chainsaw is just a no-go
---
Biggest crutch has to take into account how often you can use it, Iridescent Hatchets are a huge crutch as well but once again, it's ultra-rare.
---
'Only I am allowed to have fun. I can teabag, flashlight click and act extremely obnoxious, but if you camp me, you have autism REEEEEEEE'
---
Those would be some sharp ass cuddles.
---
Blood Warden reveals your aura in the exit gate area. You shouldn't have tried to hide
---
I fucking love facing my favorites as a survivor. And I prefer to play Clown and Spirit and I've had so many fun and exciting games because I know their weakness and strengths.
---
'I can ruin your time' really only works if your teabagging actually gets the killer mad. Most facecampers won't leave no matter what you do, and really, you're powerless against someone determined to facecamp with a oneshot(Huntress i-head hatchet, leatheface and billy)
---
Put em in a spin cycle üîÑüîÑüîÑ
---
Nobody gonna comment about the direct Kung Fu Panda reference? Do you men have no culture?
---
Lemme smash üòè
---
Sitting on their face after hearing 3 gens pop definitely isn't very tactical
---
I'm with you. Why prestige when the bloody skins are less camouflaged? 
---
Take my money!
---
&gt; Really don‚Äôt understand how they think doing things in a pragmatist way is bad since the whole point of a killer is to you know kill
---
Because they're entitled cunts and they're used to the devs bending over backwards to appease them. 
---
"Survivors are woefully underpowered and have no chances. DS is fine and didn't need to be nerfed. All Killers need to be nerfed. There needs to be more pallets and windows. Using mics while playing SWF is fair and the devs want you to do this. Legion and Nurse should be removed from the game."
---
Survivor Mains actually believe this. 
---
I think this is because the legion has no counters. A legion can moonwalk chase you until you have to mend and then down you.
---
it's like slenderman in the initial phases of the match
---
If we get the whole player base in at once, we might have enough for one game!
---
You should totally sell them!
---
I wouldnt do that as a killer. If a person loops me for 3 to 4 gens I will eventually switch targets and if they get saved from hook they can escape I dont want to go through a chase like that again when it may be easier to get another target 
---
Talk about false equivalency. 
---
One is non-moving object, another is actually living breathing player moving their character around. Your action has consequences for another person in that it prevents them from fully experiencing the game. You as a killer can still do other things if a gen is completed. Survivor can't do anything when they are being tunnelled non stop. 
---
Try walking on their shoes for once and see how unpleasant it is to be tunnelled non stop.
---
As much of a prock this guy is you might want to remove the name anfd link, reddit has site wide rules on witch hunting and shaming.
---
Lol this happens 99% of the time at rank 1. Fortunately most killers aren‚Äôt boosted animals and won‚Äôt let me run them for more than 1 gen, but the times I do manage to loop the killer for 3-5 gens, it‚Äôs a camp and I get hit on the hook.
---
Funny thing is after I say gg, they say ‚Äúwhy are you so toxic‚Äù or ‚Äúdeserved‚Äù Just because I‚Äôm a good looper. I never t-bag unless it‚Äôs a facecamper, and never bring items mostly play solo, so what‚Äôs up?
---
id add hag to that list, she suffers just as much as huntress if you cant use her power properly 
---
The only one I strongly disagree with is Azarov‚Äôs Resting place, which I would argue is strongly killer sided.  The map basically hands the killer a 3 gen cluster and all the killer has to do is lock down one corner of the map.  S/he can just forfeit the entire rest of the play space and cut the survivors to ribbons whenever they enter their block, which they have to do through a massively exposed corridor with no cover on the exit.  The only thing survivors can do is try to lure the killer out into the corridor and then rush one of the inner gens, but if the killer refuses the bait then there‚Äôs nothing to be done.  Sure, killers with below average movement speed and no distance closers will struggle, and if the survivors manage to get a gen done on either side then the killer is basically fucked, but the former is luck based and the latter requires the killer to make a ruinous mistake rather than the survivors outplaying them.
---
Or the insane killers trying to torture her and killing her?
---
I think the huntress is in the right spot. If her base speed was 115% then yeah. After you juke the hatchets she is easy to loop and bully. I think the very best huntress players make her look like she‚Äôs top tier, but for the majority of level 1‚Äôs she‚Äôs not that tough against. There is also no way to impact her terror radius which is also a negative. Lastly, when you load into a game and you eventually hear the huntress‚Äô singing, do you feel relief or do you worry? I personally feel relief.
---
There are times when it is abundantly clear that you've vaulted a pallet and landed on the other side already, and you still get hit. When the vault is .5 seconds, and the killers ping is around .2 seconds or higher at times, you run into these problems. If you've watched any of the popular DBD youtubers you must have seen these clips. I think there are examples in No0b3's everything wrong with DBD video.  
---
Dedicated servers will reduce ping for most players and provide more consistent ping for most players. The only way this could hurt someone is if they already have a very poor connection, or if they are intentionally manipulating  network traffic to cheat. There are plenty of times when poor connection screws over the killer as well. Idk if you've ever seen a survivor that is teleporting all over the place to the point where it looks like they are dead-harding every second.
---
I haven‚Äôt touched dead by daylight in about a month but 60fps on ps4 will be so fucking nice üôèüôè
---
I mean you are bad for getting caught in the first place if you end up being camped 
---
Except a generator takes 180 seconds to complete by yourself, and a survivor takes 2 hits. Lmao salty killer
---
She could potentially go up one, but she is 100% not bill bob tier lol
---
She has the best follow up in the game. She can pretty much one shot if she gets close, you actually can't tell when they are going to throw (if they are a good huntress) and locker reloading doesn't take very long (especially with Iron Maiden.) Honestly I just feel OP hasn't faced r1 huntress' or isn't too good with Huntress themselves.
---
Nobody:
---
Huntress and Spirit:
---
Her follow up is great for sure but the 110 speed means that the initial hit will probably be a throw right? And after that she needs another throw. She has to hit those two obviously and if she misses either it can be tough for her to regain momentum A. Because the throws have slowed her down even more. B. Because if she didn‚Äôt come into the chase full on hatchets then she potentially has to go to a locker to get more because survivors can bully her due to that 110 speed ya know?
---
You honestly believe that she belongs next to billy? 
---
When stuff was happening for the Legion and the chapter title was Darkness Amoung Us, i kinda thought it would be neat if the Legion was a killer and survivor, when they are the killer in the trial, they wear the masks, but as a survivor they do not. Play with the idea that the Darkness is in them so while they seem innocent they can be called upon by the entity. That didn't happen, but the idea that it could expand to a sibling thing could be neat, either one is a killer the other or survivor, or both can be a killer and a survivor.
---
Why does playing eFFiciently make the Killer bad?
---
You win either when you escape or lay claim to his bridge
---
I never get those... I can play swf whenever I want. 
---
I could MAYBE see her going up two. Her skill cap is definitely high, I do not see her next to ol bill bob
---
Class Photo is such a ridiculous add-on. Goes with any build you're shooting for and doesn't have any practical counter. Easily one of the best add-ons in the game. 
---
But... The hag killed the cannibals who tried to eat her.
---
Thank you so much! I'm not used to making any kind of fanart and not signing is a really bad habit, should really start doing that.
---
One hundred percent, without a doubt. I play ALL killers and she is part of my top tier try-hard trifecta. Huntress Billy and Nurse. Huntress, when played right, is near godly. Learning how to hit hatchets and not just chuck em around makes a world of difference

Nothing specific to her. In fact, she has gained a slight buff when you take current perks and the removal of lots of pallets into effect
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/20667/huntress-nerf-conclusion#latest
---
This guy is saying she was nerfed in Sep 2018
---
Once you hit rank 1 it's the opposite of what you want.
---
Yes, they changed the hitbox on her hatchets and it caused many issues with clipping and the like. It has since been reverted and is back to normal.
---
A beast. The jersey devil a sashsquatch or yeti or a werewolve. Why dont we have a beast?
---
Where can you find this info?
---
Thats not true according to Steamdb. They have its best time ever at 15th August last year (the day after it launched early access), which had it free to play for the weekend, with 3342 players. Next day it dropped to 2330, then 1860 (last day of the free weekend), to a bit above 800 after the free weekend, then, within a week below 200. It only got above 10k in anything ever if you take twitch views during the free weekend.
---
That's beyond toxic.
---
I found it
---
I love that song so true 
---
Solid 0 now.
---
I don't think it's against Twitch TOS, it wasn't stream sniping, it was just him pointing out other players because they pissed him off.
---
Just remember people who say things like that are the ones who are most pathetic and sad. üò∂
---
This license DLC was planed for the old DG. The Devs working really hard on an complete revamp. The new DG sounds so much better than the old one. They wanted to release this DLC with the ‚Äûnew Deathgarden‚Äú but they needed to release this DLC before March of 2019, because of an contract. And btw this ‚ÄûSkin‚Äú don't fit in the DbD world!
---
Never mind it's fixed.
---
I agree with you. I get just as weirded out about all the people I play with/against who are all about that "Daddy Myers" lmao
---
Idk man I still am gonna have to stick to my guns on this one and say that she isn‚Äôt up there w billy. When you said something the the effect of survivors don‚Äôt know when your winding up how do you do that? 
---
Love these. Who did you use for the Hag? Howleen?
---
Yeah but only after she died and the Entity gave her Lower I believe. Plus is it really bad to kill the people that legit ate parts of you and essentially starved you while you were chained to a wall?
---
Or....a alien! üëΩ 
---
That is not even a regular occurrence. What usually happens is that the killer is proximity camping/patrolling the hook that no matter how long the other survivor wait, it's almost impossible to pull off the hooked survivor safely.
---
And even when you safely pull the survivor off the hook, it's a guarantee that the killer will come back to see if they can tunnel the injured survivor fresh of the hook. 
---
This is why camping goes hand in hand with tunnelling and why it's BS that the deve still hasn't provide a clear way to combat this while happily do the reverse to survivors. 
---
They know you are winding up, but just hold the hatchet. If you watch the top tier huntress' they all hold the hatchets for _aaages_. But it is also a genius strat. Either you hold out and secure a hatchet hit or they juke your hatchet and in the process put themselves in a bad position and get thwacked
---
I know, man. I was shit posting to a shit post. 
---
To be honest it's a split decision for me. On one hand if someone does it to early just be an asshole I'll probably "accidentally" sandbag them. On the other hand when I just saved someone and the killer has been Proxy-ing I will probably teabags once to get their attention away from them even if I die if it gives the other person a chance (if they weren't an asshole. If they were then perish)
---
Due to the fact that it's an asymmetrical game in some cases you can still end up "losing" even if you outplayed your stronger opponent as much as possible. Unless the killer is really bad. Or when your team is a bag of potatoes.
---
And the lodge window in Blood Lodge
---
And one of the estate windows on Yamaoka
---
I think there's a window on Haddonfield too
---
And I'm sure there are some that I'm forgetting
---
Just remember that if someone is looking at you from a distance they're probably Michael in disguise üó°Ô∏è
---
I did a Mad Grit build several times in a row to the same group of folk. It was absolutely hilarious because I deliberately put everyone on The Game and chased people lol
---
I feel like I need to do some "off the wall" builds just to keep things fresh on DbD.
---
It's a Kate main. Rarely do they have more than one brain cell.
---
Fun but worse than annoying doctor
---
If they camp how is it hard to do gens? No one's after you. Noed gets activated and its not hard to cleanse. It happens anytime I use it. I can try to stop it but then I have to watch totems and exit gates. Its a lose lose. If I watch totems they can just open gates if I just watch gates there go my totems. Effectively it will just waste a perk slot or in the best case it will net you one person. 
---
Can you imagine clown running that build? Just a big guy trotting around with a survivor on his shoulder in every which way lol
---
I mean he probably cooks very well but something tells me Leatherface is the one person I'd ask to cook me a vegetarian meal. ~~Please tell me you didn't rate him that well for the human meat OP~~
---
For Wraith, I was running Save the Best For Last. Third Seal might actually be a good alternative to Frank's or Brutal Strength depending on pre-game setup.
---
Removed for salty after game chat 
---
Camping is one thing, tunneling is another.
---
I still have no opinion on camping as I play with friends often but tunneling depends on the situation. If a survivor is unhooked not even 10 seconds after you walked away, it's stupid for the killer to not tunnel that survivor. If you call that lame that means you're the one who expects others to sacrifice their fun for yours.
---
Nah you made a good joke
---
God, Adrenaline needs to be nerfed so that it doesn't wake survivors up.
---
Yeah you do for any offensive action (even if you miss), I dunno about stepping in a trap though.
---
PWYF is shit tbh
---
And it does a lot of damage...
---
The next couple of frames probably go like this...
---
Killer - "The game hasn't ended... Are you sure it isn't Dwight in the locker again"
---
Entity - "Nah... Oh there's Claudette"
---
Killer- "Where?"
---
Entity - "On the hole."
---
*Que showing Claudette standing ontop of the hatch, staring at the killer*
---
Killer - "..."
---
I was think yellow and purple add ons and it can make for a mind fuck mid game when doctor is flying around like teir 2 Myers with like 8 feet TR.
---
Ya it is i just was wondering if anyone could give me some numbers i could look at to get a better idea
---
It's an endless circlejerk of toxic Survivors -&gt; killer who rightfully gets mad and stops being fair in the following matches -&gt; decent survivors -&gt; salty or asshole killer -&gt; salty survivors who the become toxic and then from the beginning again.
---
[.](https://gyazo.com/26028a66d9269c1b132c86348c94b3bc)
---
You lose a stack when using a chainsaw (Hillbilly and Leatherface) when using a hatchet, using a bottle as Clown.
---
Grabbing an survivor or using a mori wont count. (tombstone and tombstone piece when playing Myers also wont count) 
---
As someone who has only escaped one match at the Chapel I'd say it's mostly killer sided unless (x).
---
I've had more victories as a Killer I suck as (Nurse and Clown mostly) there than as Survivors I'm good at. Totem Spawns there are usually hard to find IMO and if you find them the Killer will probably have spawned rather close to them since I feel like a lot of my matches on the map have both of them closer the the shack than the Chapel.
---
There's also the issue of a lot of free space and o my few pallets and when you find one it's one of those awful ones where killer can pretty much be on your side before you have time to vault.
---
That's just my opinion though so yeah
---
Its old
---
"Noed is a problem." "Cleansing totems is a waste of time when killers aren't even running it üèÉ" noed is good for a group of noobs or if you are in a chase with a healthy survivor and that last gen pops. It can work great if you get lucky. I've hooked 2 people after the gen goes only for a 3rd to open gates and cleanse the totem and go back for the others and everyone leave. Its my fault though because I didn't find that last person in time. Its all luck based imo. 
---
I ‚Ñ≤«ù«ùl ‚ÖÑon…π ‘Ä…ê·¥âu
---
So my only real options are Myers, trapper(maybe), and wraith since he end a chase whenever he wants to get a quick stack
---
Are you *genuinely* comparing suicide to not giving someone the hatch? Seriously? DBD is a casual video game played for fun, suicide is far more grave of a subject. Kind of ironic that you're upset at me for this and yet you're the one who is making a mockery of suicide. 
---
These are amazing! 
---
Glad you feel that way. I decided to delete it because I felt like I was lying (because I was lying) and I didn't feel good about that
---
If you are close enough to see the unhook it sounds like a farm. I always chase the person who unhooks so they learn to wait for me to leave the area before trying the rescue. 
---
For up to 60 seconds. After that, it's fair game.
---
I honestly don't see a problem with NOED. I dont use it on killer and i can't remember that last time i actually died from it.
---
Most of the time the perk doesn't even activate due to me being a point fiend.
---
If Anything it encourages me to either escape or *Risk* staying to find the totem, which is a nice change from "oh, all the gens are done guess i can go play with the killer"
---
You know that reminds me that Pope Alexander VI rapidly bloated and decomposed after his death. And that he also was an absolute asshole and most likely engaged in incest with his daughter Lucrezia.
---
Would be funny if Behaviour took inspiration from one of the arguably worst Popes.
---
I love customized Moster High Dolls! These look AMAZING! Good work! :)
---
Spirit and Pig can also work, pig uses one stacl with her crouch attack.
---
Hillbilly and Leatherface can be good because they have a one-shot and thus use only one stack.
---
I have so many questions, but a majority of them can be summed up with: WHY?
---
Congrats:)
---
Yeah without a 4 man swf you have to be very lucky or spam down on the d pad and pray people follow you 
---
Have you noticed that Legion members wear very particular clothing?  It's not the most demanding cosplay, true, but still not as simple as what you described. Don't know why you seem to be bothered so much by this.
---
It's so difficult to sort by new, give me the big support br√∂ther
---
The chain blink to grab someone off the gen is hard. I had to pretend to farm then grab someone off the gen
---
Oh really? I could tell it was clearly a joke, I think old mate was just a bit thick upstairs
---
Thanks mate
---
I hate playing against Huntress. I don't know if it's just me but when I face her as survivor the hatchet hitboxes are ALWAYS f*cked up (for me).
---
Thanks :) the nurse ones were very hard for me since I don‚Äôt play nurse unless it‚Äôs a daily 
---
Thanks and congrats yourself 
---
I'm still waiting for the final TF2 comic.
---
Imo you don't deserve those late game hooks. You did poorly all game and you get rewarded for it. That's why it's a problem
---
Best at chasing is Legion tho. Best at catching is Nurse
---
I wonder if you can do the Pig?
---
Well, while an undeserved hatch escape sucks, there's a counter to it, which, admittedly, isn't 100% fool proof. If you slug the 3rd survivor and look for the 4th, nobody will get the hatch. Also, take into consideration that sometimes people get chased the entire match, keeping them from doing gens, but will be presented with an opportunity to get the hatch in the end, should they be punisged for it then by not having the hatch open?

Whenever I play killer, I always try to go for a 3rd survivor slug to find the 4th strategy. Works almost all the time, unless the 3rd survicor DCs. It really isn't that big of a deal, since, like with NOED, there is a counter. There's no need to complicate the hatch mechanic even further. I'd also much rather have that last survivor get the hatch instead of them Urban Evading around the map, and my salty ass trying to find them if it comes down to it.
---
I'm not mocking it I'm giving an example of what some people find funny when it's completely uncalled for to laugh and watch videos of that for their own amusement. Just don't be toxic in regards to standing over the hatch. 
---
Sometimes I d/c when survivors make me wait to long. If both gates are open, get the hell out. I'm not even mad I just want to play a new match, not have to wait around on you to leave. Good grief.
---
Probably due to the lag 
---
I‚Äôm trying to get the trophy for 500 doctor shocks right now, so I just stand there shocking them until they get sick of their own screeching and finally leave ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I still can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm always surprised it takes a minimum of two minutes of shocking like that for them to finally leave though.

Just a couple things: anything with corn is massively survivor sided and Trapper on Haddonfield can destroy any team

---
i know this is your opinion but.... thompson house balanced? how?
---
Can you elaborate?
---
I have ZERO control over the unhook. Especially with randoms.  So the fact that IM being punished because THEY decided to get me infront is actual bullshit. 
---
At least it wasn't a hatch standoff. Those things are so annoying.
---
Most times survivors always win hatch stand offs
---
There's a point where if you're good enough there's literally nothing a survivor can do against a good nurse besides be immersed and hide all game
---
Hey if wee get posts saying that's he's weak and OP at the same time, then he's pefectly balanced! /s

I panicked and attacked when I saw the scratch makes but she also panicked and jumped in. It was a coincidence.

You could of actually escaped of your walked through the escape line then back again. 
---
What remake? Didn't know they did one. 
---
Imagine shining a flashlight at the killer. Shade everywhere except directly where she would get hit by the beam.
---
If they changed it to only lose stacks on SUCCESSFUL offensive actions then it might be decent. But overall the perk is ass
---
Hello post I see everyday, thought I was gonna miss you today. 
---
I think of her as ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùkinda‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù sympathetic. She was put through essentially two traps, told to slit her wrists (AFTER THE BEAR TRAP MIND YOU), was an addict, felt terrible for what she did, and was emotionally manipulated by both Kramer and the other Guy whose name I forgot. She was an abused woman who needed therapy, not to be told that traps were what kept people fighting. To her, any trap was escapable, as she had to do the unthinkable to escape hers. Part of me thinks that she thought her traps could be escaped, but the people never pushed themselves. 
---
She still is terrible, yeah, but i think that she should have been put into therapy and addiction help rather than jigsaw therapy. 
---
Personally I think its the other way around. Maybe im just a better killer and maybe you're just a better survivor? 
---
People bragging about "juking" and "Looping" are dumb, congrats for breathing i guess, its the only thing you can do to stay alive, her is your medal of "NOT DEAD" ...oh wait nevermind sometimes he died....lol

That‚Äôs your teammates fault.

WOW using a crutch perk to make later fun of the weakest killer in the game, you got killed by? Your parents must be SO PROUD ! 
---
I can't for the life of me get the blood on your face trophy, atleast one person dcs every goddam time
---
The devs already said "D-Stikre even after his rework isnt comparable to NOED" ...so stop complaining and just deal with it ! Take small game and cleanse every totem instead of bothering us, the game is imbalanced enough, this "idea" has so many flaws. 
---
" leave a wall of smoke behind him " .....so "The Clown" ... you hope the next killer is literally the clown ? 
---
I dont want to have to see the destruction of 5 totems with small game because that for every game is too annoying and thats what youre telling me to do. And how is my reaction numb? You are so dense. Just tell me how the idea is flawed instead lf acting like a baby killer 7 year old child
---
Would I call this Fredd-ception?
---
~~Bad joke~~
---
"Suvivors who tbag and dc" 
---
Your bad....guess what that is even worst then. Everyone who is offended by "tunneling" and "camping" dosnt understand the game at his core as killer. PERIOD! 
---
AND STOP USING CAPS AND EDITING YOUR POSTS
---
How is this nsfw?
---
Stronger debuff to skill check chances and the added time to the transition is basically a non-factor.
---
I didn't realize they were planning on totally redoing it. Is there anywhere I can see the planned changes?
---
 ‚Ä¢ Factory  ...but isnt the "IRON WORK OF MISARY" a factory ? 
---
Because everyone apparently compares it to d-strike (which they dont if you actually pay attention) doesnt mean that i did it. And if you could actually read then you would have noticed that by yourself
---
I 100% agree with this. No sane person is going to slug you when you have no mither.
---
what are those add ons for wraith?
---
By "You cant change my mind" i only say " I DONT need to change your mind" 
---
I main killer but I've played mostly survivor last month with my friends and it surprises me how many of the red rank killers use NOED and also Ebony Moris. I know the discussion is about NOED but seriously Ebonies should be removed imo. 
---
 
---
As for NOED, I understand that people might think it needs a rework, but tbh I totally disagree. I don't know the OP but I think this might be coming out of the frustration that being downed by NOED is. Also, if you mainly play SWF, it may feel really bad not being able to save your friends because of this high threat. But remember, NOED is not that good of a perk. It should get 1 kill at maximum if people are not braindead. Normally you should either just cleanse all the totems, or at least leave 1 clear spot for the totem so that you quickly check it before leaving, as you can't always guarantee your teammates (if not 4 SWF) are cleansing. If you didn't find it and the killer has NOED, just open the door and escape. Killers with NOED tend to just camp the first prey the find and hook when it pops. If you are only 2 survivors and 1 gets downed by NOED and the other isn't even close to a door, it's his fault if he gets downed on the way to it. He should just go for the hatch or save his teammate if the killer isn't camping him. If you are 3, then just escape. NOED rarely activates with 2 survivors alive and matters tho, as the situation would still be the same, 1 under pressure and the other trying to escape/save. NOED or not, it would still be dangerous to do anything that makes the killers spot you. So the 3/4 survivors alive case is more likely, and in both is fairly easy to just open a gate and have all but 1 escape.
---
All these posts about NOED are deceiving noob killers into thinking the perk is actually good, when it's not unless you really play a full endgame build. It might allow some clutches and that's it, it's not like that every game. You should reconsider what you are doing as killer if you really need this perk to get more than 2 kills.
---
It is when they try to be Superman and one by one try to resuce and die, then you get hatemail about blah blah blah... Happens all the time. (To each his own).
---
Just a advice, you shouldn‚Äôt kicked that first gen, make you waste time ;)
---
Noed's issue isn't it's power. It's that it is very uninterractive and can be used as a crutch to secure a single kill. There is a reason why none of the high level killer players use it, being how it comes active too late and is too unreliable as a win condition. A perk that lets you crutch a kill doesn't need a nerf, camping does that already if you feel you need it.
---
 And hilariously, your ~rework idea~ nerf doesn't even change the problematic aspect of noed! It would still be very uninterractive and used as a crutch. However this nerf would kill EVERY SINGLE LATE-GAME BUILD IN THE GAME. Killers already suffer from lack of build variety and this change wouldn't help at all
---
But David and Dwight dont wear skirts ....i cant look up there skirt ! 
---
God I wish they‚Äôd make DBD amiibo for the Switch version. Hopefully sometime in the future.
---
I'm not sure about Nurse in general. She murdered in utter cold blood. Dunno if I could see her being sympathetic akin to Billy who may be a murderous monster, but who's also a bit like a child. 
---
Thant the "suvivors" who farm you calling the killer out for staying near the hook aka CAMPING and  slapping you instandly down again for a easy sacrafice aka. tunnling.
---
And most dumb suvivors will call him to, because the killer ist the reason they died, never the TEAMMATES ! Teammates dont hook you -.-,
---
Well it is kind of, you got caught 
---
It‚Äôs rather you or someone else moaning about this issue. 
---
Terroused ! I got the right subreddit for your r/ConfusedBoners
---
This is nitpicky, but as a dg owner I always wished the devs would use their steam hub to post updates and news more frequently. I didn't even know about their small event a few months ago because they only posted about it on twitter and discord. If they would engage more with their steam audience It might be helpful long term
---
His only weakness is la chancla.
---
Ohh I see what you mean, and that's a total mistake on my part! It does lack some depth around the shards, I should really go back and add that in at some point. This has been a WIP for over a month and I just really wanted to be done with it, so I guess I threw my brain out while finishing it up yesterday!
---
And I'm glad I could make her face scary, I wanted to really lean more towards the in-game model with her crazy facial expressions. Thank you!

Even if her games were winnable, johns logic was literally never something anyone could ever agree with despite how desperately they make you try to sympathize, unless you are an actual psychopath.

12m terror radius outside of a chase.
---
If you do 4 totems and nobody else does a single one, that's on the rest of your team. I assume you also flame the killer if your teammate farms you?
---
Nurse, Spirit and Legion deserve way better spots IMO
---
Brown addon... Stunning!
---
But he has a low terror radius, a counter to the gen rush, insane map pressure that can lead to mind games, easy ways to find more than 1 person, powerfull add ons. Easy mindgames during dream transition, litteral notifications if someone wakes up (unless woken up my someone else but then he now know where 2 survs are, best late game potential. How exactly is this bad if you uterlise it correctly?
---
I see a Susie and now I am jealous.
---
True True...
---
It‚Äôs the other way round imo. For both sides you basically don‚Äôt really have to do anything besides playing to pip, so both are just really easy
---
All your posts make you sound like a salty survivor main.
---
Play killer more to better understand how the other side feels and stop watching noob3 and ochido.
---
Toxicity? Im literally giving him tips lol.
---
And going around the map itself takes more than 30 seconds
---
"Noed is one of the weakest perks and i dont use it" proceeds to write 5 Paragraphs on why it should be left alone.
---
Noed is simply a perk that shouldnt even exist in the first place. Same like DS. Like most say. Noed rewards bad plays which shoudlnt be a thing
---
Oh okay. I can give the Devs the feedback! The ‚Äûnew Deathgarden‚Äú is planed for later this spring. They add in this update: Characters, Progression system, a completely new Gameplay, Balancing Changes and more! What I read it's a completely ‚Äûnew game‚Äú!

Wait leatherface has an insta down that aint noed. What i have never witnessed an instadiwn with anything else i thought his ability was for breaking pallets : ^)
---
She didn't die, she was in agony and hexed the cannibals with the power she learned from the older of her town. Then she died
---
valid point. But red ranks look red. Ultra rare add-on/offerings/items look pink.
---
same PepeHands
---
Its more the fact of the fucker having no counterplay and is the most unfun shit in the came cause of this. Plus not being able to shit in deep wound is really annoying, he is just badly designed.
---
Haha YES do it üëç
---
Agreed. First name was Nurse, then Hag then Spirit so I'm just getting better hopefully
---
*screams in oink*
---
You might laugh. Its still used tho and it gives the killer atleast 1 ez kill.
---
And most killers who use noed do that for 2 reasons. 2% do it for a endgame build and 98% for ez endgame kills because they cant get kills during the 5 gens because they simply are not good at the game.
---
She's next actually! But going to be more realistic style, like my Legion pair 
---
ü§¢

Thanks ü§≤

Sloppy Butcher: when hitting a survivor you hack off one of their limbs, either an arm or a leg. Survivors without arms can't do generators. Survivors without legs can't run away.

---
Noed isnt problematic because of it's power level as i have said multiple times and you're yet to provide any arguments to prove me wrong....
---
Ans the door problem is not with noed but with map design which is notoriously horrible in dbd
---
Name a downside his power has.
---
number of pallets is not what im talking about. The fact that bottle can force an early drop or net you a free hit means loops end faster.
---
Bottle blurs vision while making a survivor scream. Clown then knows where the survivor is and survivors have a harder time seeing where he is going around a loop. Not only that, but you can use bottles to trick people as to where you are going. Most of the time you throw a bottle where you don't go, but you can easily walk through it to confuse survivors. Not only that, you can long-range a bottle to spook a survivor into thinking you are going there next.
---
Farming points always helps.
---
bottles aren't good by themselves at finding people, but when you get juked you can chuck them around walls and objects and use process of elimination to discern which way the survivor ran.
---
Clown is A tier, Pig is B tier. They are both leagues above the worst killers. Clown doesn't see much play because his power doesn't feel like it is doing much in the moment (as apposed to chainsaw, blinks, etc.) but it really is a simple and effective way to deal with looping.
---
I've actually been DDOS'd because of getting 4k's in the past. Sucks that there's nothing I can do about it. 
---
They are also remaking Deathgarden to be more in line with Dead by Daylight. More [here](https://forum.deathgardengame.com/categories/announcements). Deathgarden had a lot of potential and maybe they can bounce this one back with the rework.
---
You‚Äôll know when you‚Äôre older
---
Nice! Can't wait to see her!
---
Or if you're a good survivor it can last an entire match. Maybe you're just not a good survivor?
---
They‚Äôre not bad at all

Looks great in general, I think the face could use a little more...femininity? Keep it up!

The Darth Maul of survivors haha double flashlights  :)
---
noed benefits from the bad map designs
---
When the killer has no token and camps the surv then theres atleast still some hope to save the surv but a noed camping killer right now is 100% atleast one kill for the killer.
---
No

You should make a guide for these

One tile has a very small industrial shack. I was meaning an entire map/realm that's a huge abandoned factory. Like car manufacturing capacity type of factory. Iron work of misery being a sub-tile of multi-map realm is like calling the Chapel a carnival map, which it isn't. Just one tiny tile has some decorations but you're not running through a big top circus or vaulting over ticket stands. 
---
Let‚Äôs face it, the only reason this game has its number of sales is Megs mask
---
Stop thinking you are entitled to a 4 kill, every match, and you will be fine... the idea is to pip.
---
Once you stop stressing over it being swf you will get better and adapt and get more 4k‚Äôs.
---
You are gonna find survivors that are better than you, it‚Äôs just how it is.
---
What? Freddy‚Äôs is great! Straight outta the movies
---
The only problem with noed imo is addictional movement speed. I dont care about instadown but being able to move 5% or 7% faster (i dont remember exact numbers) is just ridiculus.

"You can run but you can't hide, bitch!"
---
If they do that then there'd be tons of player in low elos, ruining the new killers experience, also, if they remove the struggle, then hatch escapes would be impossible some times, what if you wanna let ur teammate escape or the killer is facecamping hard...?
---
What exactly were they sued over?
---
idunno I have fun playing against good players but a good nurse is boring because it's kind of just a done deal almost instantly unless you have a jojo stand that can stop or erase time.
---
Camping can be justified.
---
If 3 other survivors flock around the hook like morons, I‚Äôm not walking across the map. Stop being altruistic and I‚Äôll leave. 
---
It would make life easy for smurfers.
---
Instead, if someone quits more than 2 times, put him in waiting time. Let's say 5 minutes on first strike, up to 20 minutes. If they leave the queue then timer resets.
---
just lagswitch 4Head

Thank god for not putting blocks in the high tier. Im tired of seeing people that turning 7 second fedora man into 3 second fedora man
---
i mean you spent time in a locker instead of contributing to the progress
---
Yes. You. Can. 1. Sometimes unhooked survivors have 1 sek immunity. 2. You can bait a hit and then get the survivor
---
In their own way the loved by family survivors are just as sad. Kate had it so good yet I feel bad that she was ripped away from her dreams. 
---
Never trust a killer will give the hatch, that's why all survivors wiggle. Happened way too many times to just yank your chain and show you where the hatch is just to take you to the hook.
---
Congratulations!
---
Nah I'm kidding, nobody cares as you said lol
---
No, I mean they're likely to be in the same vein as a P3 Claudette. %
---
Get good and play the game as it should.
---
You play it for the rituals or to have fun? 
---
I am a killer main but if I get survivor rituals then I try to do my best at the game and also doing the ritual because no one gives a F**K about your ritual.
---
Same as killer. Survivors won't know you have ritual and even if you can speak with them that would be even worse because they will shit talk you for letting them win because...you know...more than a half of those players are toxic kids.
---
Just play the game in a chill mode and you won't even know when you've done the ritual. Good luck!

---
Getting hit with DS is annoying but not as bad as when they DC just because they've missed it before the first hook.
---
You can basically never trust a killer to give you the hatch though.
---
I completely agree. This next part is slightly off topic but I honestly hate it that it lets the killer know when you have Boil Over, the perk is trash enough as it is and the moment you're picked up the killer knows you have it. Sometimes the killer tries to hook me on a more advantageous spot by taking me to a further hook instead of the nearest one and Boil Over would maybe punish that.
---
I've had Boil Over work once in my entire 1000 hour history of playing this game and that's because the killer got way too greedy and tried to basement me from way too far without Iron Grasp or Agitation, but the moment I found out that the killer gets notified of me having Boil Over I completely stopped using the perk.
---
She never enjoyed it when people died, she killed that innocent woman because she was being threatened with a letter. She made the traps unwinnable because she tought the victims weren't worthy of redemption
---
People that can't afford paid DLC's does.
---
Both latency and a bug. The game gives Survivors time to react to your inputs before they fully take effect.
---
If a Survivor lets go of M1 on a gen/totem/hook it takes priority over your grab. Even if you get teleported into position and started the animation already, they have a short window of time to simply let go of M1 to prevent the grab. If the ping is low enough, the jump scare of getting grabbed is fast enough to prevent the grab as a Survivor lets go of M1. So it is a bug from starting a locked animation, but fails to follow through with it. But it is also latency as it is Survivors reacting fast enough to prevent a grab.
---
This is a VERY old issue and will likely never go away.
---
Wear the black jacket
---
When I checked BHVR's other game it felt like a recycled DBD, not so original, at that point better just focus on a single game like Riot Games with LOL. If they wanted more money better release spin-off merch from DBD...
---
Touch√©. I didn‚Äôt think about the shards. 
---
See? You‚Äôre a toxic disgusting person and I feel like you‚Äôre very lonely and bitter. I would give you a hug but idk where you are.
---
Why do you claim shit you don‚Äôt know? I play both killer and survivor, and I bet you aren‚Äôt even that good, but again - you give me the vibe of a narcissist so therefore Im ending the convo here.
---
Although I never play Legion like that I can understand why you'd do it.
---
If you need noed to get some kills then youre hilariously bad. And the only way for them to get good is to stop using that wheelchair and if they dont want to then they might just quit the game. Whats the fun in a game where you can only rely on one thing that activates after around 8 minutes while at the same time denying to actually work on getting better.
---
I feel disappointed that I need to say it was a joke.
---
So I've done a similar thing for a while and next rank reset I'm going to hit rank 1 without killing anyone. I usually 2 hook everyone then just slug and Max out my other categories. By the time that's done I usually have enough to pip on any killer but it's almost guaranteed on legion
---
She hunted for sport not protection (she get bored of hunting animals and start hunting humans). One of her add-on show she enjoy it and even take items off her victims as prize or for memory of the hunt.
---
Maybe I have just been lucky or playing against potato tier survivors, but I do pretty well with Freddy.
---
Hex Ruin + Dying Light + Insidious + Spies from the Shadows = really nightmare Freddy.

Chupacabra(Its a Brazilian Legend),or maybe Slender.
---
I mean she‚Äôs still not sympathetic to me but Amanda was blackmailed into making her traps so brutal and impossible to escape by Hoffman. She was there the night Cecil robbed the clinic (and was in a relationship with him and the one who told him to rob it in the first place) and Hoffman knew about this. He threatened to tell Kramer and it was safe for her to assume that probably wouldn‚Äôt end the best for her considering that event is what triggered him into becoming the Jigsaw killer. 
---
Amanda was clearly not an emotionally stable person and suffered from mental illness. Both Kramer and Hoffman saw that and took full on advantage of it. 
---
LOL since personal attacks is all you're left with, we'll end it here. Thanks for proving my point. Hope you get better. Perhaps you'll enjoy the game more once you do. 
---
This is so cool! I was planning on making a Pig Barbie from an old Elektra doll I found so this is so cool to see I wasn‚Äôt the only one. I hope I can reach this level of quality. 100% would buy a Rin dollüòç
---
Spirit main trust she is actually broken with the right add ins an perks
---
Was there post-game salt?
---
This happens if the survivor disconnects their internet cable when you try to hook them. If they disconnect it for too long they will disconnect from the game, otherwise you'll be stuck in the hooking animation until they wiggle free at which point they'll reconnect the cable. Best course of action is to report and move on.
---
Trapper adored his father and he only killed because his father ordered him to do so. Entity had to break the Trapper to kill for it.
---
That's asking a lot with this player base as a whole.
---
Sadly no.
---
Fair enough.  It's been a while since I've read up on backstory.
---
I'd say that's about right. The only counterpoint is not everyone SWFs just to have easier games, sometimes people just want to play with their friends or viewers. Compared to something like a perk or addon, which only serves the purpose of making a game easier.  
---
 If I had friends I'd probably want to SWF with them too :(  
---
I know people always say this about dying games but it NEEDS to go free to play, even if it's a gimped version of the game that doesn't let you customize your characters or something, or it'll forever be in this cycle of no one playing the game because no ones playing the game. I genuinely don't see other way for this game to come back.
---
On a personal note I don't use it. If the game hits endgame then I failed as a killer, however that doesn't justify calling them "hilariously bad" especially considering how easy it is for a group of coordinated survivors to bang out 5 gens. If anything the presence of noed was meant to slow games down by forcing people to do totems, that's why they changed it from a tier 3 instadown to having it down at all ranks. 
---
Snitches get stitches.
---
That was a nice trapper, I would be thanking him if I were you. 
---
‚ÄúNot a big deal‚Äù writes a, fucking, essay...
---
Unhook immunity doesn't help  if the killer waits for 1 sec. And again it takes the killer same time to recover as it tajes for you to unhook so neither of those works against competent survivor
---
I personally find hillbilly and hag on the same level as those two. I just can‚Äôt exactly put them all into one category. Amanda was a vulnerable addict that was manipulated into Stockholm syndrome and leatherface was vulnerable from the start because as a child your family is the only thing you have to look to. 
---
Point is they are both there because of vulnerability and Manipulation. Clown was on a good path. Leatherface was never in his life on a good path.
---
why would you give them the hatch?
---
I can unterstand that if a stand off is about to begin, most stupid mechanic ever.
---
But aside from that I would just hook them if I can
---
Honestly, Frank is made out in his backstory to be somewhat sympathetic, too. He never had a stable home, and was bounced around between foster families throughout his childhood. His last foster dad didn't give a shit about him beyond the money he got from the government.
---
He definitely isn't as sympathetic as the Wraith, Hag, or Spirit, but he's just a fucked up kid who never really had anyone to put him on the right path.
---
What the fuck? Why would they get the terminator license for a game that barely gets like 10 players at peak hrs? This is really puzzling to me lmao.
---
What the game is so BUGGY WHY CANT HE REACH TIER UP 2 !111!
---
^(/s) 
---
The lunatic is on the grass.
---
Because some people enjoy being nice, especially if it was a 3v1 or something like that. Not everyone feels the need to 4k every game.
---
Personally, I find killer easier to rank up with because of double pipping.
---
Like, I think both roles are *too easy* to rank up with. I think Survivor is too easy to pip with, but too hard to double pip, whereas with killers I think double pipping is comparatively really easy, but pipping just once isn't much easier, so if you fail a bit you don't rank up at all. 
---
Overall, I would nerf both sides, but especially Killer on double pip.
---
What black jacket?
---
Fair. To be honest I'd rather not use it and have to not only worry about defending a totem but also free up a perk slot, but it's just too crucial in the early game given my playstyle of setting up a lot of my defenses before even finding my first survivor. Not to mention, the maps where it can just spawn right next to a damn generator... 
---

A baby killer is some one who is either new to the killer or just bad at the killer. And instead of using one of those synonyms I prefer to use baby for it sounds funnier.
---
Or Clown.

It's concept art of the hatch and has always been on this map: https://youtu.be/T_wik23p85E?t=123
---
I love seeing killers and survivors memeing around together! :D
---
We had a dc when I was playing with two friends and it was a legion. I ran up to him to see if he was willing to meme with me and he did. He seemed fond of me xD so after finding out he had Iron Maiden, me and my friends took turns to jump in and out of the closets in front of him and our characters proceeded to constantly scream. It was absolutely hilarious! XD
---
The hatch.
---
well, thats the point, so If I can I Go for it.
---
I mainly do it when I do really well, hook everyone 3 times, I have max bloodpoints in all categories, so hooking the last survivor gives me nothing, might as well make someones day and give them 5000+ bloodpoints right?
---
No. But Spirit and Huntress fit into the same category. I think the four at the top two tiers are all on the same level. But I‚Äôm not going to shove all four of them into the same category. 
---
You forget that her mother died when Huntress was around 7. I‚Äôm not going to deny that fact. HillBilly and Hag got revenge. Huntress hunted on her own for years. With no one to teach her right as wrong. So if we‚Äôre talking about what‚Äôs worse - that is. 
---
I always think more of the spider monster from *Limbo*.
---
Its a dwight so i doubt that...
---
I never feel like I "won" if the Killer gives me the hatch...
---
It's situational. Obviously if you're trying to tunnel down someone that can loop eFFectively and chain powerful areas together then you're just fucking yourself over.
---
This shit has been an issue for a very long time.
---
This is a pretty damn fine idea.
---
It still baFFles me that people choose to moonwalk instead of simply looking down, which is far easier.
---
I love "I swear, Daddy did it!" 
---
When this happens to me it's because i've launched the game through my taskbar shortcut, which for some reason doesn't launch EAC. Launching the game directly from my Steam Library fixes it though.

Looking at the exhibitor list and map of the show floor they will be there. Doesn't look like the booth will be quite as big as last year but not much smaller.

But he didn‚Äôt say a one liner

Ahhhh you don't know how many times I died like this, my stupid ass learned to just leave and not to fuck around with the killer
---
Congratulations mate! I got it too a while ago. The hatch trophy was a pain in the ass 
---
Tunneling is when the killer chases a survivor.
---
Seriously, though, "tunneling" is not a thing. It's a made-up term used by survivors to shame the killer for playing optimally and/or because they're salty.
---
I fully agree. As a killer main it sucks just as much people getting rescued centimeters away as soon as I turn my back, I always put the person that was "saved" right back up anyway and they wanted a hook on the person's life. 
---

I've seen everything now. Is this what enlightenment feels like?
---
Why the downvotes tho :'D
---
&gt;In case you're not aware, we have no choice who we are matched against these days especially on **console**
---
I play on console (Xbox). Also, I play a lot more survivor than I do killer, but I still play a fair amount of killer (rank 5 survivor/rank 1 killer). So, I understand that it's annoying and or frustrating to play against someone that tunnels and or camps, but that doesn't  change what I said in that it's a really poor strat as the killer. Good survivors will make those killers pay. Who you play with has no bearing on if you are a good survivor or not. 
---
&gt;That's why we often get matched with level 15 and below whose method of winning is camping and tunneling. 
---
Again, that's just frustrating to play against, but easy to counter/beat. Though, I don't play anyone at that rank. Once I got to 7 I stopped getting people in the teens. Not saying it doesn't happen, because I've seen the evidence that it does on this sub. I'm just saying, it probably happens less than you're giving credit. Then, when it does happen to you, you're not playing against the play style properly. Unless you're mistaking that style being annoying rather than effective. They're not one in the same. Camping and tunneling is annoying to go against, but it's easy to beat. 
---
&gt;Camping will get you kills 
---
not against good survivors. 
---
&gt;But there's not much an injured survivor can do post unhooking no matter how good they are if they are injured
---
I mean, it's far less likely you'll survive but there are things you can do. Dead hard for one is a great counter measure to tunneling. Especially after being farmed by a teammate. If you're SWF in a group, you can have one of them take a hit and or body block. If the killer isn't that good (which, if that's how they're playing, they're likely not...unless they're trolling) then other perks like Q&amp;Q or DWM can really throw the off while trying to tunnel. So, again, there are ways, it's just much harder.

Thank you üôèüèº

Had similar as pig went to sneak up on a nea in while I was in crouch she didnt notice me got right up against her she must of stopped repearing because a skill check popped as I stood up my body got stuck inside of her and both of us stuck to the gen. Was able to move once she DC'd
---
I am the enemy of the people. The post had 69 likes but now it has 70
---
I see it as a mixture of trauma. She had to watch it. She even sung to her mother has she drew her final breaths. Plus she was under the age of 10. Which means until (however old huntress is in the lore) she was hunting on her own. But I can see why you‚Äôd disagree with Huntress being that high. 
---
LOL that would be fucking great! Also, I agree. Getting farmed is the worst feeling. 
---
This is why I run borrowed time.
---
Just kidding, I run it to enable my Deliverance and  get the +500-1000 BP. (I'm a terrible teammate.)
---
The original 1980s version was supposed to be a pedophile but they changed it last minute due to a real life pedophile murderer that happened.
---
And in Nightmare on Elm Street 6, they made it kinda clear he wasn't just a murderer and hinted at his full backstory.
---
Bad day?
---
I wasn't saying you needed a pre-made. 4 solo survivors who know what they're doing (in case of randoms, perks like aftercare and bond help with coordinating) can still do 5 gens in a little under 5 minutes if the killer tries to go after someone who's really good at running them around. Like I said before, the current NOED is meant to draw the game out by making people do totems, and having a solid chance of being punished for ignoring an optional objective. At the very least you can't say it's worse than the older noeds (not attached to a totem, 120 second time limit, and before that it was just infinite) 
---
Thanks for the tips! But for now I'll probably stay with Nurse and Myers heh
---
Can you send me the Susie doll?
---
Loaded into a 3v1 vs a nurse on The Game.  Nurse proceeds to tryhard.  My friend and I both die.  The Bill realizes she's a tryhard, and begins to take her on a running, hiding, juking, BMing trail of tears for the next 30 minutes.  Don't wanna farm in a clearly unfair 3v1?  Fine: I'm gonna fucking waste the shit out of your time and DC so you don't get any points either.
---
You got it. Happy hunting! 
---
Oy- survive with friends already is a bitch to play against. 
---
It doesn't really serve any purpose with regards to Trapper's ability.
---
On Tombstone Myers, PWYF is a staple. It can be a good tech choice on Wraith, for the reason you mentioned, especially in combination with STBFL. And due to increasing the movement speed both while revving and charging with the chainsaw, it is quite neat on Leatherface. To a lesser extent, it can be interesting on Pig, since it increases the ambush crouch and dash speeds, and since crouching (eventually...) breaks chase state, similar to Wraith.
---
Throwing bottles unfortunately consumes PWYF stacks for some odd reason (probably codeset paste from Huntress), otherwise it could be a flavour choice on Clown, too.
---
PWYF is definitely a perk deserving/requiring of a buff (among many such). Only losing stacks on successful offensive actions, like another poster here suggested, would be a good quality improvement. Built-in means of detection for the Obsession would give it more consistent value, since the perk relies on finding the Obsession frequently. You can't really "play with your food" if they intentionally avoid you. Similar to a fly in a spider web, you should get a location notification on the Obsession if they move around a lot. I. e. if they run for a period of &gt;3 seconds, you get an aura read/noise bubble.
---
I think it's way too slow for those people that want to unlock killers or survivors with them.
---
Obviously the devs want to make money but investing 4 perks worth of shards to get 1 of these characters is ridiculous imo
---
Ok so basically all the survivors with anything better than a half-ass backstories are the dlcs
---
Well if the win then spam 'ez', and if the lose then they say something like 'fix your internet', 'camper'/'tunneler', or my favourite 'boosted ape' (even tho im not even rank 15 cause i mostly play survivor).
---
It's kinda enjoyable tbh
---
Pulled a player off the hook while Billy was picking up a different person.  Billy brought the second person to the hook I rescued from.  I learned a lesson.
---
But they want your money... You know? To pay salaries and... work on the game.
---
I don‚Äôt think you need dlc trophies for platinum
---
A fuckhead Nea didn't rescue me vs Freddy.  I switched to killer later that day and got her in my lobby.  Successfully made her DC =)
---
I didn't even realise that was an option!
---
I'd there a particular section of the store I need to go to?
---
And I'm not sure that's really fair to say, especially when the additional killers come Frome paid DLC, if they made it too easy to unlock with shards why would anyone ever just buy the dlc? (Outside of supporting the Devs I mean)
---
A survivor DC'ing already counts as a hook to emblems, it's pretty much already done
---
This so much... ‚Äùyou do anything besides fucking run‚Äù = face camp. This is what people mean when they say baby killers. 
---
I main survivor but I play killer sometimes as well. There are very few things that will make me face camp. I‚Äôm more prone to face camp sandbagging survivors than survivors that are ‚Äùtoxic‚Äù to me. Apparently taunting is now something that warrants a face camp.
---
Huntress cosplays still seem quite common to me. She's not Legion ez, I know that but I still see lots of her compared to the rest of the roster.
---
Spine chill my friends.
---
The devs tried something like this at one point, but people in their testing matches just abused it and trolled other survivors. 
---
I just finished playing a match, can someone tell me why the devs decided the wraith was a good character I was playing and two people were getting kill camped so they left then the other guy just decided he didn‚Äôt want to have any of it and left, so there‚Äôs 5 generators I manage to do 2 the hatch opens the killer camps the hatch so I decide to do the other 3, now the hatch was closer to me so when he came to check out the doors (on the other side of the map) he spotted me last second and swung whilst 360 spinning when he pressed attack. The reason this annoys me is because he was invisible kill camping and also he had ‚Äòno one escapes death‚Äô. I don‚Äôt get how developers didn‚Äôt consider just how stupidly OP that combination is, when I play killer yeah I get annoyed if I don‚Äôt get many kills but I refuse to kill camp as a general courtesy to all players, why can‚Äôt other people do the same.
---
The normal survivor experience?
---
I was excited for the change, considering I had Billy at P1 and tinkerer seemed useless
---
I got it a week or two ago. You‚Äôre right or they find the hatch. This was very frustrating for me as it took about 10-15 games until I got it with Cannibal.
---
this is so relatable. i rub my hands together and go into epic gamer mode when i fight another Nurse
---
How is Lisa not finger lickin‚Äô good?
---
zap
---
I love playing Myers for this exact reason
---
Not at all
---
Good argument, if the player base is loud they should change it. Counter argument Freddy exist
---
No one's doing Doctor cosplays because it would require strapping a very uncomfortable contraption to your face that is probably bad to keep on for more than 10 seconds, Billy cosplays should indeed be doable but requires some good knowledge in creating prosthetics that not many people have the skill nor time to make, and there's already a Wraith cosplayer in the background of every cosplay post.
---
For the most part though, people do those cosplays because they can be done using a bought outfit as a base and then applying weathering effects to give it a good look. With most other killers you need to do a lot of custom made things to pull the look off, which raises the skill floor and time/money investment significantly. Like if you were trying to cosplay Billy, just getting his face right would be a way bigger investment than Legion's entire outfit.
---
i... honestly would agree with this list.
---
That doesn't mean it shouldn't be implemented and used. Lots of features/mechanics are abused in this game.
---
This needs to be an animated gif of her other big weapon, the teabag.
---
Don't you need 6? I thought it was 5 vs 1. 
---
I think BHVR just wants to stick to humanoids so they can copy and paste the animations y'know
---
The other person you were talking with got downvoted, so...
---
Fuck, I really don't like going up ranks, I mean, I am not good, why I kept going up.
---
*burning honk*
---
I don't know why you got downvoted. As if Freddy wasn't weak enough
---
Does mither not already mean mother?
---
I don‚Äôt agree with The Game being killer sided, because there are sooo many safe pallets on that map now then it used to be. 
---
I dislike playing against the nurse, not because she is op but because of her constant screeching. It gets annoying pretty fast Imo.
---
Also, I love playing against Bubbas, so long as they don't face camp.
---
Hag is kinda fun but I love playing against the pig. Legion actually is okay if they don't moonwalk/ Frank's mixtape and I don't see a lot of clowns, so playing against them is always refreshing
---
3%
---
Heh. Stalk. Corn.
---
Re:Zero spoiler  
---
&gt;!Fixed!&lt;
---
I mean,  when you have BHVR making toxic streamers fog whispers,  it's bound to get worse. They don't care about the toxicity level and won't until enough people stop playing and threaten their profits. 
---
Tunneling complaints by survivors are the equivalent of gen rushing complaints by killers. If I‚Äôm unhooked I expect the killer to tunnel it increases their odds and permanently takes a survivor off of gens. Don‚Äôt blame the killer for taking an easy kill blame your fellow survivors for making a bad play. 
---
I would hate a terminator DLC. I prefer realistic characters. Ones that could actually exist :P. So glad it went to waste on that game. 
---
Is this Photoshop... dbd cant have a good totem spot
---
Given how long it takes to secure some of those licenses this might have been in the works years ago and just now gotten approved
---
I remember when I first learned that too. Lol
---
Well I enjoy either cosplays. I just feel people should go out and give the other Killers a try. I remember one Billy cosplay being posted on here and it looked damn good, if people practice with their materials they can achieve a lot of nice looks.
---
True. From my experience he's just not fun to play against. He slashes me, runs off to do something else and then I have to spend time healing myself out of the Deep Wound state. Rinse and repeat this method until we get all the gens done (because the Legions I play against never seem interested in downing me or hooking me) and escape. At least with a Killer like Myers or the Spirit, there's an element of paranoia and genuine terror when playing against them, because they're pretty unpredictable (in my opinion, and again based on my experience)
---
For David King, I recommend a perk that would work well alongside Borrowed Time. I forget the name but it increases your healing speed each time you unhook a fellow survivor and it does stack and I think the max speed is pretty high.
---
Nah man Franks mixtape and cold dirt is where it‚Äôs @
---
But still. Yes, it was tough, but as tough as being tortured and eaten alive? I don't know. We can disagree though, it's fine. I still respect your opinion because it makes sense.
---
You can easily find this out but from what I've seen people don't know about it, either they are too lazy to do some research or its harder to find than i think.

He was a pedophile. This was the remake so it was hard confirmed. He got free because of a mistake when he deserved to be jailed. And then justice arrived and he suffered. Of course, that‚Äôs not the end. He then went on to haunt the dreams of innocent teens.

What are you waiting on? Go open that basement chest!

How is Legion ugly? :)) They all 4 look awesome. Also Hillbilly ok? Wtf...
---
Are you judging their attractiveness and general appearance or their personality? 
---
Some killers are ugly, even disgusting (Billy, Bubba and Clown to name some), but Legion and the Bing Bong boy definitely not.
---
I feel attacked.
---
How about when the obsession dcs right at the start of the game? Even worse when you're a survivor and the killer has dying light! 
---
Adam death of family member?
---
Takeaways from this list:
---
- Licensed survivors suffered more than non-licensed ones.
---
- Male survivors suffered more than female ones.
---
- Console doesn't know true suffering (lorewise; gameplay is another story ;_;).
---
Don‚Äôt forget object of obsession

Wait! You forgot the hillbilly in the corner.

When I recently got the game and started playing Myers one day I got M&amp;A and Dead Rabbit so I stalked an Ace on a gen from the edge of the cornfield so he walked up to me and I just stalked him, and I got Tier 3 on him. I'm not sure if he thought I was a scarecrow or was acting friendly but it was the funniest shit ever.
---
No thanks
---
Hahaha trust me! All the memes made about this have come directly from killers and they all mention something about toxic survivors
---
Haha I love how survivor mains who have never played killer try to get killers to just accept this idea that they shouldn't pursue kills
---
And maybe the survivors who need comms need to git gud
---
Darn.
---
Mario!
---
Shes not a cannibal, just a picky eater.
---
Like a kick in face option lol
---
Ok
---
That's the most common thought terminating cliche there is on this subreddit. You can't point out the atrocious balance issue killers face because "muh friends"
---
I would be a Claudette main but all of her good cosmetics are real money, and I‚Äôm to cheap to put money into outfits.

If not update the cap why not us earn more bloodpoints? You cant always rely on where gonna live forever or bbq and chili. 
---
"However the new killer may have inspirations from movie killer just how trapper is based off of Jason"
---
Soooo like a character based off of another character, like one from The Bee Movie??
---
I don't tunnel so that's out of the question. You shouldn't be playing if you're gonna DC how would you feel if the killer DC'd on you right before you were about to escape the gate and get 5K? 
---
Nope.
---
It's now an anti-tunnelling perk. It's still powerful, but only against tunnellers.
---
Thing is, taking away tunnelling can really screw over Killers in certain situations.
---
I‚Äôm coming for you.
---
I thought trolls were too
---
He specifically went out of his way to annoy another player. By pretty much every definition toxic. 
---
You're okay bud ? Need a hug ?
---
ofc, but only because he had a trauma from youth. His mother was in a clinic for crazy people. He got called names because of that. Then he started killing animals. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs just evil. At least not like Michael.
---
Meh, I don‚Äôt mind either. Camping is bad for the killer since my team can just work on gens and as long as they get out I‚Äôm fine, and I don‚Äôt mind tunneling because that means the killer has all his attention on me and not my team who are working on gens. 
---
Put saw boxes scattered around that laugh randomly when passed as well. Full on laugh fest.
---
*I'm gonna have to mori you*
---
&gt;&gt; not against good survivors.
---
Nonsense. Not even a good survivor can do anything against Bubba or Billy revving their chainsaw in front of the camped person. Even with BT, the unhooker still in danger from getting camped next. From time to time you may get lucky but luck is not depending on skills.
---
Dead hard won't do Jackshit to tunnelling pig who already put RBT into survivors head since the beeping noise makes it obvious of your location. It might save you for fraction of seconds but then you have nothing else, especially if all the pallets have been used up.
---
I'm not in SWF so it's doubly suck for me especially when you try to juggle between gens, evading killer, saving other survivors, and cleansing totem. I can't possibly destroy all 5 while doing other things and one wrong mistake is all that it takes for a killer from 0 kill to 2-3 thanks to NoED. 
---
I‚Äôm rank 13 and I vsed a rank 20 Myers that didn‚Äôt even know how to stalk. 
---
Unlimited. Not everyone has all day play this game but when i do get the chance i like to feel like theres some progress. 
---
Sweet! I‚Äôll add you
---
Did you happen to make a huntress? Would love to see her!
---
Salty killers will do this, nothing you can do but either wait and watch Netflix until the killer gets bored or DC and let the killer ‚Äúwin.‚Äù
---
I had to wait 3 hours once. Reported him, nothing happened :/ despite it being bannable
---
How'd that work out for Evolve?
---
Yeah I've seen those. The Trick Or Treat studio ones? I have the three H3 masks 
---
Tru3ta1ent is one as well
---
I think eventually they‚Äôll change how the clock works, once they get enough complaints from tunneled survivors who couldn‚Äôt even use it
---
El juego
---
Because why would you go for the survivor who will take 2 hits when you can instantly down the one that was on the hook? The killer has no reason to force themselves. Not to mention the game actually rewards you blood points for getting hit instead for the survivor you just unhooked.
---
Bodyblock all you can by standing between somewhere a killer has to walk around, wasting time or have no choice but to hit you to make up for losses so the one who just got unhooked gets away safely. Ever heard of teamwork?
---
The killer is there to punish mistakes made by the survivors, and the survivors must make a group effort to make minimum mistakes as possible. 
---
Survivors don't simply want free points, they want to have a fun time with a reasonable chance for success. 
---
If you're gonna shit on them right away and ruthlessly take them out of the match they wait forever to get into, don't be surprised that survivors wouldn't want to stick around and play with you.
---
Exactly XD, but seriously it will be a good dlc
---
What the hell is death garden?
---
I must buy one!!!!
---
&gt;it will be solved with dedicated servers
---
It won't. Getting hit through pallets doesn't have to do anything with connection anymore.
---
SHE LITERALLY TEARS OUT YOUR ORGANS AND EATS THEM
---
AbsoluteyUnsure my dumb ass forgot to ‚ÄúL‚Äù between the e and the y in absolutely. I‚Äôm kind of high energy but I don‚Äôt rage. I just want a good game. 
---
Being downed the first time doesn't kill a fun time or take them out the match it's the point of the game to either escape or die and if you DC cos you can't handle the first down or want free points for doing nothing then you're a sore loser.
---
Its not about getting a killer  to level 50 or even prestieging, its about me having to go through 30 bloodwebs just to get the perks i want. 
---
Haha awesome:)
---
I‚Äôll addnow

Am I a Mad Grit Clown main now?

Susie mote like sexy ( im bad at jokes )
---
Wait, I thought you couldn't talk in the chat if you disconnected mid match?
---
actually tier 3 is 4% i just checked it 
---
I don‚Äôt always recognize where local hooks are as a survivor. They obviously don‚Äôt light up, and I‚Äôm busy running trying to escape the killer.
---
Maybe those survivors really think they have time to wiggle free.
---
Lol! Who doesn't like a good mom joke?
---
*Exactly*.
---
Many thanks
---
The android from Detroit:Become Human looks cool
---
Hag is god tier on PS4.
---
Holy shit, it had the SEX NUMBER? Why did you ruin it?
---
That doesn't have anything to do with the BP cap. If there was no BP cap you would still have to go through 30 bloodwebs to get the perks you want.
---
That was before I got into DBD, but weren't the very old bloodwebs much larger earlier on than they are now? Making the bloodwebs smaller earlier on and the cap up to a million was a big step towards reducing that early grind. 
---
Haha ooh you‚Äôre using name calling now too! That‚Äôs how every intelligent person who‚Äôs clearly winning an argument acts! 
---
Bro you can write all the persuasive essays you want, but if you‚Äôre too scared to advocate people should be encouraged to actively play the game, maybe you should shift to a farming simulator or something more encouraging to standing motionless or afk
---
I usually just go for the perk that's on a worse path for the Entity unless it's BBQ or Ruin. Works out better since the entity eats more nodes and you get more perks for less BP. BBQ and Ruin are worth the slight inefficiency though.
---
MuH fWeNdS
---
Seriously though, they know damn well they can't defend voice comms, so they try to make like the real issue is people being salty that strangers are playing with their friends (for... some... reason... as if killers care that a complete stranger is playing with their buddies or not).
---
Cool cool. See you then 
---
Well at first actually, but Evolve just wasn't compelling enough to keep people playing, not sure if DG is since I only played the beta.
---
Last one should be nurse with ‚Äúbreath‚Äù

Because she‚Äôs a celebrity. Almost like how you‚Äôd say Tom Cruise or Jennifer Lopez. Idk I‚Äôm making stuff up now üòÇ
---
And it's a closed beta, right? There couldn't have been that many people playing it to begin with. Once it goes into open beta and then release I'm sure it'll grow as they advertise it and get some sponsored streams going.

Yeah. I care about the game. It‚Äôs actually my favorite currently. I happen to enjoy the lore and care if they force shove a robot that wouldn‚Äôt fit into the game or the lore. And it was a condescending, sarcastic remark that you surely didn‚Äôt think was gonna bounce off the other person well. And if you did think a condescending, sarcastic remark was going to sit well with the other person then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. 
---
Oh my God, HAG! great work!
---
Nope sorry can't agree. It's my favourite map of them all. 
---
Literally happened in my game a few days ago lol. We lasted maybe three minutes.
---
Huntress is fine where she is, but what about Susie? cmon man
---
Pretty good job so far
---
I hope it'll be something like a mobile dream world.
---
Maybe while you're outside his Terror Radius, you can see the killer and there's no smoke, but once you enter his TR smoke appears and you can't see anything a survivor's height or lower, which would at least allow you to use landmarks to find your way out of the smoke. 
---
Something like that would be cool, idk
---
Should be holding a skeleton key in her mouth, or is that P5 Claudette?
---
[deleted]
---
Wait, that‚Äôs illegal.
---
I'm saying that if a killer camps, there's a chance he's not doing it with the goal of having fun, at least not as the main source of entertainment, but you annoyed him and he wants to make the game unfun for you as well
---
You trying to justify being toxic, but you shouldn't get camped for it ever is the epitomy of moronic contradiction
---
100% UNPOPULAR OPINION
---
I actually like the changes and I'll probably start using it now, It's mostly situational now but after being triple hooked in 30seconds I would take it with me just to be safe.
---
Toxic SWF - killer does toxic things back - surprised pikachu
---
Me when it's pizza time. 
---
No shame in being salty, when I'm also correct.
---
You're either lying or delusional if you think most posts about DS are anyone other than killer mains. 
---
Thats some creepy as shit. Badass
---
Keep up the good work, olive!
---
That happens when the killer closes the app instead of leaving the match. If you day he didn't do that on purpose maybe his internet died or his game crashed with the infamous PS4 error (3-3478 or some shit like that).
---
Shiraz is a RED wine
---
Case closed
---
It‚Äôs RED! Not PINK!
---
If you KNOW your internet sucks why do you try to play as killer ? Just to fuck people over?
---
Thanks
---
¬£1m
---
He camped and tunneled me. 
---
Yeah she's a cutey
---
He camped and tunneled me for 4 gens.
---
I am talking about how are they managing Dbd, and also supporting that shitshow called Deathgarden with silly gimmicks instead of just developing a good game.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ I like that
---
Huntress is cuter than ALL OF THEM
---
Legion: "I'm literally the guy in that pic."
---
Well then i don't blame you. If he did that, he deserved the t-bag
---
One problem with that: Borrowed Time. 
---
I did this with a Cypress Mori just to show off. 
---
Iridescent 
---
I upvoted this bro, people are corny. I think that at the least if adrenaline gets you up. You should have to mend. 
---
I like my ideas but maybe I could offer additional perks to Fire Up like a possible increase in speed to actions like picking up and hooking a survivor.
---
Oh I fully expect it to not be perfect. I was going to try and guess the number of perks that would break in the next live update and see how close I could get. 
---
Nah he camped and tunneled me for 4 gens. 
---
I see you chase people with 10 traps in the pocket, huh
---
Tunneling is one of the few things Freddy is actually good at, you can‚Äôt blame him for doing that. Also, Freddy can‚Äôt camp for shit so I bet he thought there was a survivor nearby. Did he have whispers? If so then he probably thought someone was near 
---
It is though. You're acknowledging that they have bad WiFi.
---
Maybe not a stalker type perk set, maybe capitalize on the can‚Äôt move when survivor looks at you, but looking at you causes injury. It‚Äôs a very very very in depth kit but a good idea
---
Why not? I'm just curious.
---
I was thinking about that too but I chose my idea because it would have synergy with another perk too.
---
Well my theory is that you shouldn‚Äôt need two perks to do one thing or one perk to buff another. So that there‚Äôs more variety on perks.
---
Nah they were all on the first gen across the map.  He was literally face camping slicing at me. Then instead of going for the survivor that saved me. Still waited to pull me in &amp; chase me down. That‚Äôs the wrong way to play Freddy. That‚Äôs why people think he‚Äôs the weakest killer. I never get less than 3 kills with him though. 
---
Anything that can't be kited for 5 gens is unfun for some survivors. It's really hard to appeal to all of them, so just let them DC and ultimately get their bans. Nothing else we can do.
---
Hag has teleportation. That‚Äôs not what the wendigo is known for. Just because she canabalizes people doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a wendigo.
---
That doesn't work in certain scenarios because youll keep seeing them. 
---
Yeah, its too easy to go up ranks to a point where its annoying. Unhook 1 person, maybe touch a gen or two, and you automatically get +1. 
---
He actually camped &amp; tunneled me for 4 gens. I also didn‚Äôt get killed by him either my dude. 
---
It depends on what phase you were in after getting hook. If it‚Äôs your first hook and a survivor does that I won‚Äôt mind BUT they have to take the hit/aggro from me. Especially if they are at full health and never got hooked.
---
So happy someone got it XD
---
Just hit them and they'll jump in
---
honestly, i don‚Äôt give a shit if they do that as long as they let me have a free hit because i need those sweet, sweet brutality points
---
Funny how the conversation around toxicity always centers around survivors crouching and pointing, rather than the killers slashing and ripping players out of a match. 
---
Like seriously, what's actually more offensive? 
---
I wouldn't call OoO useless, it's actually quite helpful... 
---
To the Freddy that is. 
---
I get 4K‚Äôs all the time as him, he is my main, but I can‚Äôt deny that he‚Äôs the worst. People think he‚Äôs the weakest because he IS the weakest. Most Freddy players tunnel because it‚Äôs how they are. I‚Äôm sorry the dude camped you and tunneled you, but you‚Äôre only adding to that problem by teabagging. Being toxic towards a toxic player doesn‚Äôt fix anything, it only adds to the problem. 
---
You misspelled teabaging 
---
Maybe only give the option if both players are in the terror radius? So it can‚Äôt be as easily abused 
---
I only t-bag as a I beat your abusive gameplay. I didn‚Äôt message him like ‚Äúf u you toxic piece of crap, That what you get‚Äù blah blah blah. I honestly don‚Äôt think a t-bag is that bad. Even from a killer stand point. Now people that t bag while looping. Ugh I hatttee that.
---
Damn all the killer mains on here really need to learn how to read before commenting. They‚Äôre so quick to try to tell survivors how they should be playing. OP posted the situation of the trial repeatedly and they still condemned him/her for tbagging.
---
The game is still in Early Access. This is the reason that they change the entire game before they launch the ‚Äûfinal‚Äú version. This game has so much potential. I know the first version of the game flopped, but the new ‚ÄûDeathgarden‚Äú sounds so much better! I think we all need to give this game a 2nd chance. 
---
"Hennessytha2nd" a couple of buddies and I play dbd quite often just to chill and have a good time! We also play apex and basically any co-op game. Feel free to add me and we can game sometime! 
---
The nurse saying bitch pls cracked me up
---
turn up your sensitivity lmao, it looks like you put your sensitivity as "slug mode"
---
Exactly
---
???
---
Please tell me there is one for huntress
---
I'm not sure what that means I've never played cod :/
---
I think knowing Joey he might actually be a decent cook. The one I'd trust the least is Julie because she's so reckless.
---
I know they're going through a whole rework but is it too little too late? I know it's not OFFICIALLY released but it was launched where people could pay money and play it and interest quickly dropped. Early Access isn't just a get-out-of-jail-free hand wave, impressions were made.

Why doesn't this have more upvotes
---
Can we buy these ? I would pay money for this 
---
This is awesome
---
Sweeet!
---
Only killers that are afraid to lose their sacrifice do that, or, as I like to call them: trash.
---
Kinda joking though, but for real, you get more chase points going for the unhooker rather than rehooking the unhooked person right away. I only tunnel when the survivors are being toxic af.
---
Spread the word, our voice must be heard!
---
But either way, 4 man swfs are easily stronger than any killer except nurse
---
U have been blessed. There are lots of fuckers that mock you even when you kill them. A motherfucker escaped injured through the hatch, like 3 gens left, and had the audacity of saying "gg ez, baby killer" and then insulting my perk selection and calling me toxic
---
The Trapper does cook things. Just at very high temperatures and they're usually implements of murder...
---
if you have an issue with a 3v1, just dc yourself. just don‚Äôt get banned. also, don‚Äôt be a bad sport if the killer doesn‚Äôt play nice. 
---
Deathgarden is a new Game from Behaviour Interactive. (The same Developer and Publisher like Dead by Daylight but it's a different Dev Team)
---
Yea it happens ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è thanks though for taking the time ü§©
---
when i play killer i take mercy on all the screwed over survivors but i guess it makes sense
---
I want this one :(
---
survivors are pure entitlement 
---
That actually doesn't make sense, because losing track of one survivor still leaves you with 3 others &amp; a survivor who now only has 3 perks.
---
Many times, getting hooked once is all it takes for a survivor to lose a match (camping/tunneling killers, teammates won't rescue, etc.).
---
Lastly,  don't hate the player hate the game.  Maybe ask them why they even have a button to leave match at all? 
---
You are right, but many strong swfs know what they are doing and not a lot of people have such perks as pgtw and doesn't know very well how to add a lot of pressure
---
Well, that is kinda their objective. Get hooks and get sacrifices. Ive never had a killer tell me to kill myself or to suck my grandmothers asshole, but i wish i could say the same from survivors.   
---
Best daily you can get. Easy bloodpoints, although I hate bringing moris because they are not fun for the survivors whatsoever
---
lmfao you so clearly have never played killer in your fucking life
---
That's really all you *can* do in that situation. When a game with Myers goes south, be the meme.
---
Many killers don't give a shit about pip so they will camp these two poor Survivors. That's assuming the two survivors stick around for the Entirety of the camping while the remaining two doing gens. Many will just DC after realising they're being camped, which lead the shitty killer to camp the next person and so on. Soon 2 became 3 and the last survivor has to use hatch if they have enough gen.
---
See how shitty it is? Until the punishment for camping and tunnelling deter the killer, survivors will just DC as no one like doing nothing but repeatedly pressing a button to survive. Then the whole game is completely ruined for everyone. 
---
I want the shiny pink axe so badly now.
---
Your more then welcome to create a post about killer toxicity but this one in particular is clearly labeled survivor
---
"If I flip these pizza's, Mr.Aziz will flip out" 
---
If the new killer was "The Priest" or "The Pope", what sort of power would you like to see? 
---
Something that is fun to play as and fun to play against AND would actually help the killer to catch survivors.
---
Everyone says it's a worse version of Borrowed Time, but I can't use Borrowed Time on myself now can I? It's amazing for us solo survivors.
---
So, because you get outplayed you just become toxic? Like, I get where you are coming from, but just because your opponent knows how to play the game effectively doesn't mean you need to be an ass. That would be the same as playing a fair killer game and still getting teabagged at every corner and getting hate messages ij the end for things you didn't do; it's just not fun, nor fair.
---
I don't know if you remember this but it used to be a big issue for high rank survivors to even find a game. Killers didn't even want to play because of how awful it was. I think BHVR noticed and has been buffing them for a while because of that.
---
I wait at the exit sometimes whenever I play survivor, but I don't teabag unless they play like a bitch n try to camp me for no reason. I sit there waiting to see if my friend is gonna make it( only time I play surv )/people who actually are good teammates n helped out or checking to see if they have NOED...that is if no one has been hit yet. Besides that gotta show the killer some respect! I don't want those aggressive humps, so why would someone else.
---
I rage when this happens to me. Like the whole, ‚ÄúGreat game BHVR‚Äù ‚Äú Pretty good job so far‚Äù.  But when I‚Äôm killer, it‚Äôs like taking a hot shower after shoveling after a snow storm. 
---
A lot of people aren't having fun with the game right now. Solo survivor can be an awful experience. Many killers tunnel and use Moris, half the games have 3 survivors load in, etc. The ragequits are a symptom. Unfortunately, bad killers are incentivized to play scummy due to how fast gens get done at high ranks combined with many killers lacking map pressure. 
---
The Developers working since end of September on this massive rework. They change everything and addressed a lot of the negative feedback of the Community, to make Deathgarden much better! I think all of the owners and other players need to give this new game a new chance. It has so much potential! 
---
A well thought out rebuttal. Thanks for the great advice, it actually changed my mind on the matter and I will re-subscribe to the subreddit immediately.
---
I agree mostly. It depends on the Killer because Trapper can shift some of these maps a good two tiers downward. 
---
Alternately...
---
1. Dont care cause its a game
---
Fin
---
Probs because it‚Äôs the easiest one to pull off, the legion are all human so they‚Äôre body types are pretty normal, plus you just need to dirty up a hoody and jeans and make the mask which (aside from the Susie one) have pretty simple designs.
---
They should have just did a series of betas, going early access may have been the biggest mistake.
---
This is also why I don't think we'll get a Renaissance era Italian citizen as the new survivor. An old killer is simple enough, smack people, kick other things.
---
Although I can still hope for it since the outfits could just be different occupations such as , blacksmith, farmer, minstrel, sailor, etc.
---
But I'm going to go ahead and say that it will be a modern era historian that just happen to find the weak spot where the entity pulled the killer in.
---
*Laughs in looking away*
---
There are things I take mercy over, but that is honestly just personal preference. Think of it the other way around, were there ever time when the survivors had mercy on the killer? I've honestly never seen one you know.
---
the trapper should be cute sorry ion make the rules
---
If only reporting actually did something right...?
---
 You should take some time away and try something more relaxing. 
---
I'm sure those games are fun for everyone involved.
---
I rebound the struggle button to R1 (PS4) since the shape buttons on my controllers won't last long if they were the "mash" buttons.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve turned messages off on my PS4. Being a survivor main, it‚Äôs nuts how many times my teammates send me messages and call me out on shit that I didn‚Äôt even do, whereas the amount of killers who used to message me congratulating me on a good game...
---
Community is weird.
---
What‚Äôs so funny?
---
aw he's unhooking him! look at that team player. üòâ
---
Yeah until the one guy lags.
---
Imo the tragic part is that she was pretty much the living embodiment of hope to everyone she knew and met, and now she's trapped in a nightmare dimension where her positive aura is mostly useless.
---
Some Michaels can be absolutely adorable. I agree. 
---
I think it'll be a genie that has the power to transform into something else whatever it wishes to be.
---
STAR PLATINUM 
---
ZA WARUDO
---
*DARN*
---
Actually most of the time if i just ignore them and go for someone else they end up fucking up.
---
Like a meg that followed me the whole game pointing and t-bagging trying to bait me into a chase.
---
I ended up hooking her once because she tried to unhook someone immediatly after i hooked them.
---
Then when  they were only 2 left i started chasing her and essentially just waited till the other surv finished the gen so  i could rancor that bitch xD
---
It quickly gets salt because it's deleting someone immediately when they *deserve* the third chance. (Green Mori)
---
Dunno about higher Mories yet because I never had the chance to even see one.
---
Maybe if they would actually ADVERTISE DEATHGARDEN. I literally never even heard of this dlc
---
Someone didnt play killer back then. It was grossly unbalanced.
---
It is the Trick or Treat Studios one I think.
---
Yet survivors win the game by trying to force the killer to waste as much time as possible. Taunting in game to bait a chase when you know you hedge the ability to run the killer for a while should then, by your logic, be considered doing their job. 
---
I don't usually dc but I do have the urge everytime I go vs a legion (so boring and pointless) if you have ebony mori or some crazy add-on or if youre a camper/tunneler.
---
The amount of detail you've squeezed onto something so small is amazing. Great work!
---
Why a mori ? It's a legit token a killer has a right to use if they want to?
---
yes but also no
---
But why Insidious?
---
Lol bet
---
Like the others said, so making logical choice makes you a bad player?
---
No? This is a terrible idea
---
4 person SWF is not outplaying the killer lmao that's the biggest crutch hand game balance issue we have rn
---
I don't see why people go after the unhooked person. Unless they run right into me I'll just ignore them and go after the unhooker.
---
They‚Äôre going after the optimal target. That‚Äôs also why survivors hate it- it‚Äôs the play that hurts survivors the most.
---
Idk they were doing that teabagging and shit the whole match and I screamed when I got them because I rarely get anyone with the throwing hatchets xD
---
Nah, they did make bloodwebs smaller because they thought it was too grindy. Granted, now we have way more teachable perks so it‚Äôs still very grindy. 
---
Nahnahnah it's okay I said
---
"n i g g a"
---
You seem to think the killer is there to do something other than kill the survivor.
---
Sorry, ‚Äúfam,‚Äù but you dead and off the board is best for me.
---
Nope, just a dominance thing.  Folks have an inordinate need to show the killer just how skilled and amazing they are, and how little they need to worry about said killer.  Mostly, they aren't nearly as good as they think they are. 
---
I don't hate it cause it hurts my team the most, I hate it cause it's no fun to instantly go back on the hook because of something completely out of my control. 
---
This is exploiting the games mechanics, it‚Äôs like when trapper could trap right under the hook. There‚Äôs toxic and there‚Äôs just straight playing unfair.
---
And then what happens when you face someone with skill? You lose, that's what. It's still like that for some of the weaker killers. Just RNG to see if you get good survivors or not.
---
For a long time that's how the game was balanced and it didn't work, now they are actually trying to make things fair and survivors are pushing back.
---
Good.
---
Kramer wasn't evil, he just had a warped mentality of the right to life.
---
He went through a congo line of traumatic experience culminating in a failed suicide attempt, where he realised that life is the most precious gift, and those squandering it should be forced to either take better care of it or lose it entirely.
---
On the other hand, Amanda during her stint was straight up horrid. Her traps were purposely designed to be inescapable, going against Kramer's whole purpose and something he never did.
---
It was on PS4 about two months before bans were implemented. I mean, if you guys wanna ban him now, by all means, he‚Äôs still playing and streaming as of two days ago, but I appreciate your response and understand. The game is still great despite the flaws.
---
What happened if they opened the gate? 
---
If your team mates didn't do anything,  I would of done the same thing. I've had games where I decided to save the random on the hook,  for them to hide afterwards to get hatch. Wouldn't work on gens or anything,  it's ridiculous. I always feel whoever does the most should get hatch,  but that's not usually how it works because of us doing the most we are more noticeable to the killer. You're basically damned if you do and damned if you don't lol. I'm okay with not escaping anymore,  I just do what I can and get me a nice little handful of bloodpoints. I also always play with 1 other person, which helps take away SOME of the issue. I'm hoping to go back to a full swf soon.
---
I know, but do you have to be toxic just *because* they are SWF? I play 2-man SWF quite often, but we actively try not to be toxic. I never run DS and I often play using a random perk wheel. My point really is: Is it necessary to be toxic by default, even when the opponent is not? 
---
Freddy totally sounds like someone who would use the "muh mindgames" option when arguing why Freddy isn't complete shit.
---
No court in the land would've convicted Wraith.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind this. And it doesn‚Äôt even have to be that many bp. Make it 8k. Either they focus on one category (running killer, doing gens) or they split it a little. 
---
I had a game where a survivor stopped doing anything after the FIRST death. I went on to do two more gens, and the game lasted 10 minutes. 
---
We all died thankfully. At least she didn‚Äôt get hatch 
---
With a shorter fatigue and she could interact with lockers/pallets while in it.
---
Well to be fair Legion and nurse need rework Legion rework and nurse nerf
---
Sheltered Woods is cancer to find Survivors on and I will fully admit that I suck at actually finding Survivors while I find the chase pretty easy. The Game is pallet heavy but has no vaults and is super small and easy to control. If you have an anti pallet perk the map becomes a complete breeze to play but it sucks massive ass if you're playing one of the 4 killers who can't do anything on the map or the Survivors have Balanced Landing.
---
Then don‚Äôt take the hatch if they give it to you
---
Don't agree with the second point but okay.
---
*screeches nurse noise*
---
Gross.
---
I made it a mission to personally tunnel anyone who tbags into the fucking ground. 
---
Everyone else who didn't tbag can leave peacefully though.
---
I was playing with a friend earlier and he was rank 2, queued against a rank 20 killer 
---
Mainly the house. If the Killer comes to the house and isn't a complete potato it's basically a free kill. Other than that the map is fairly empty in terms of vaults and stuff unless you go to the edges of the map. If you run through the middle it's pretty much all corn.
---
Quentin was likely seconds away from also dying if the Entity hadn't intervened.
---
In my experience they stripped out the varying game modes they had when they launched F2P. I remember seeing escort survivors, a long campaign fight thing between monster and hunters. Culminating in an allout assault from a level 3 monster.
---
It's well designed because while there's a good density of pallets and windows a Killer can easily make dead zones to put the map in his favor. Likewise while the Killer has the option to make a three gen it's up to the Survivors to prevent that from happening.
---
Most likely, they don't WANT everyone maxing out a new killer on day 1, if I had to guess. 
---
Yellow is the final survivor.
---
Green is one survivor that's been hooked once.
---
Red is any/all who have been hooked once.
---
Ruin 100%
---
Serves them right really, people really need manners.
---
From someone who plays survivor mostly but I'll play killer on occasion for rank 1 if I can reach it. Rank 3 atm I find survivor way more challenging and fun with the new changes towards killers. Before it was just dull because even if the killers were bad they couldnt do shit now even bad killers can still slightly pose a threat or challenge.  I like how the killers are beginning to become stronger. That's the way it should be so surviving Is a challenge and not just how long can I hold M1 on this gen.
---
Depends on of you think you will get enough hooks for lullaby to work. Personally I think lullaby is better because players are pretty good at ruin skill checks. But ruin will prolong the game for you so secure more hooks and kills.
---
The jungle gyms on that map are bullshit. They're literal goddamn hedge mazes with like 80 vaults. If you have Quick and Quiet or Dance with Me you are almost guarenteed to escape in a jungle gym on Ormond.
---
Exactly that's why I dislike high rank as much as I like Billy and nurse its annoying to see nothing but those two at high rank. It sucks to see just two killers being played but I understand that they are like the meta in terms of actually securing a win. I like to play against all killers as long as it doesnt just turn into a bully fest. I've been playing freddy at rank 3 and I've been getting like 2 or 3 people most games one on occasion but I at least hook all of them. Survivors only fun with friends anymore because at least then it's somewhat exciting because solo is just dull. I play solo but it's just not fun to run someone around all game and then be camped. Which I do deserve for running them around all game I deserve that. But it just feels bad for the killer.
---
Literally the same meme was posted like 2 days ago
---
Use both borrowed and DS lol
---
Nobody knows the game outside of this subreddit either.
---
Nice snipe! I hate people like this smh just let the game end how is sitting in a corner any fun at all 
---
Missed a word. Will edit.
---
The change isn't going to help you there.  You can still get 3-4, and they can still hang onto it until endgame.  I really strongly suspect this ds "nerf" is going to pretty much leave it at the same power level for survivors, while making it even more frustrating for killers. 
---
Technically it can be a historical killer. That would be in the public domain and wouldn‚Äôt be licensed.
---
I don‚Äôt think it will be, but just in case you know of some murderous Pope 
---
Ruin
---
It will super useful with ‚ÄúBreakdown‚Äù in cause you get tunneled.
---
Green epoxy putty will let you bulk her up easily. 
---
Fair point about the architecture, they would probably be able to figure out metal boxes and the other survivors could just say "think of them as metal horses."
---
Not mime enough. 
---
I don‚Äôt wiggle if I think they might be nice, but in my experience I just get fucked if I trust the killer. I often get taken to the hatch, dropped in front of it and allowed to crawl to it then killed on top of it... Or pulled off it after being carried to it and hooked.
---
I'd like my enemies to admit defeat before I show them any mercy.
---
I think it would go a long way to helping curb it a bit by calling the steamers to task for it.  Certainly if you promote toxicity in the game by being toxic you shouldn't be a fog whisper,  for a start. 
---
Yes pls!
---
How is it not working when you have two dead survivors? Unless you define it as such in higher ranking, survivors are less likely to help when you're being camped, which is shitty all around.
---
At the end of the day all of your claims that in higher rank this is not possible still doesn't solve the problem that if a killer did those, two survivors still end up on the shitty end of the stick without much compensation to prevent them from DC.  
---
They wouldnt do a historically real killer because it would make the game feel more real, it would ruin the fun if they didnt have a power and no realistic killer has a power
---
Spine Chill all the way.
---
Where Legends cried
---
So this is what the killers do in their free time...
---
Slug if you have to. Deal with DS later. You just need someone not doing gens and someone rescuing. Less advantageous, but still wasting their time 
---
It‚Äôs pretty easy to just say ‚Äúentity gave them ___‚Äù in terms of power. And it could be something as simple as a tool. Trapper,leatherface,billy,huntress don‚Äôt have powers they have tools
---
Hag with mint rag means it literally impossible to not get hit by make your choice. 
---
Have you tried reinstalling the game completely?
---
Freddy's aura reading corresponds with his terror radius. No terror radius means people within 24 meters of him can be seen.
---
Yeah, realistic characters like Wraith, Freddy, Nurse, Spirit, Hillbilly, Doctor, Legion, and Hag.
---
Post this to r/contagiouslaughter
---
These post always need a backstory for most of it to make sense. I want to know what happened to make him angry! 
---
As far as I've ever seen, the Egyptians had incense burners in the vein of the middle east and not censers in the western tradition.  The only near east culture I've seen them from with any frequency is Tibet. 
---
&gt;  I had one guy sneak around the map for ten minutes after the rest of the survivors left. 
---
had something similar. killed 3 and the last one searched for the hatch for more than 10 minutes. he hardcore stealthed. never sprinted and used urban evasion. it was so annoying. in the time he tried to escaped he could play a whole game. i dont get why people do that
---
I mean you can go if you‚Äôre not having fun 
---
That was his idea. There are actually already colored perk, power, item, and addons online already. They are by HappyClown. Use at your own risk tho, if EAC detects and autobans you the devs will not do anything about it. I have been using it for months but just thought I should let you know.
---
It's just a skin, not even it's own character.
---
The doctor needs to help the clown but they are both too busy laughing. 
---
Either way they wont do real killers. They have said that before when people were asking for hannibal lector in 2017
---
Yes I did 
---
Someone already posted that
---
Trapper bouta get duel berreta‚Äôd 
---
But we already have Freddy
---
The EAC error are generally low,but infinite lobbies haven't been fixed for me 
---
Report the message and have PlayStation deal with him
---
They said they also would never do a clown. 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to argue I‚Äôm just saying it wouldn‚Äôt be a licensed killer if they modeled one after a historical figure 
---
Ruin since if you have a average reaction time and concentrate lullaby skill checks feel like normal ones.
---
I‚Äôve always thought DS was a waste of a perk slot anyway. Seeing everyone crying about it on their Facebook page was hilarious tho. 
---
Oh I see. I thought you meant that they physically couldn't. That is fair enough. I just like the idea of lumping two basement perks into one instead of having to run them separately, like with Deerstalker and Knock for slugging.
---
Can't you just knock them down again? It gives you more points. 
---
The last time I got fucked by lag was when I was trying to run to the exit gates to open them and there was only 1 other person left (other killed themselves because Legion/lag), but it took ~30 seconds for me to get to the switch (even though I was right next to it) because I kept getting pulled back. I finally made it and as the gates started to open, there‚Äôs Legion with fucking NOED. It was only tier 1 NOED too (worst perk change ever imo). If I hadn‚Äôt been getting stuck in place by the lag for that long I would‚Äôve got out... Sucks.
---
This is a possibility, but given that the burn victim is holding the censer, I'd say it leans a little more towards being the religious character and not the witch.  There's always a chance that it's a trophy of killing the witch-burner though. 
---
Agreed. I‚Äôd almost rather be face camped than tunnelled because at least if I‚Äôm getting face camped I know the game is over for me and I can just die but when I get rescued off the hook and start strategizing what I‚Äôm gonna do next and the killer turns around mid chase with someone else just to come knock me down, feels bad man.
---
Like I get the killer objective is to kill and all but I feel tunnelling is more inefficient than finding someone else and chasing them. Since one person is on the hook doing nothing, someone has to come save and heal, so they aren‚Äôt doing gens at all, and hopefully finding someone else and chasing them all of a sudden it goes from three people doing gens to one (zero if the last person hides in a corner)
---
Oh you mean physically combine the perks? That could work
---
That‚Äôs their connection to my game, so when I see a survivor with red ping I know he‚Äôs gonna call me out on bad internet or lag switching. 
---
I don't think so but I may be wrong. I was of the assumption that the terror radius would just disappear once you completed the transition.
---
thats so funny. its even better when they leave 3 gens next to each other and you hook someone in the middle of those 3 gens. how is it camping, when i literally dont have a reason to leave this gen triangle?
---
Exactly my thought process lol.
---
This is basically how every cthulhu Cult works. :p
---
Recently picked up freddy, drowning in said salt.
---
*screams in heavy breathing*
---
Damn I covered the iridescent stone and it looks red.... took my hand away and its pink
---
Oof.
---
Yea, I once was on a lobby with a 600 some ping claud. I thought it would go down eventually seeing that the others were in the hundreds. It didn't and I would see the claudette constantly blink forward and tbag and blind me at oallet chokes. I can just sum it up as "a power point claudette"
---
Nurse's backstory hurts the most. She literally went insane. The mind is a scary place.
---
I‚Äôm real proud of ya
---
Can you tell if it's real or fake?
---
The general idea is reasonable as a strategy.  If a killer can turn the match into a 3v1 early on, it becomes far easier to win.  The time wasted from camping in order to make that happen, though, should be unrecoverable vs. any halfway competent Survivors.  The only time it makes real sense is if there's 2+ Survivors floating around the hook the whole time.  If all 3 are on gens, it *should* be game over for killer very shortly after the first one dies. 
---
Moon walking takes skill
---
Darn
---
Legion‚Äôs Mori is awesome though
---
People get one chance when I‚Äôm being generous. If I pick you up and you wiggle I drop you and nod no. If you wiggle again you get the hook. It‚Äôs so much faster to let the killer carry you to the hatch unless it‚Äôs Nurse. Other players will run around for miles looking and I‚Äôm like....bruh lemme Tarzan ya ass there. 
---
Spine chill is amazing but bond is more universally excellent.
---
Grim Matsuri Hair, Prestige shirt and the grey sweatpants I know it seems like a bad idea but it works well
---
Yeah I agree but not for nurse, she just strangles people that‚Äôs not enough blood for me
---
Damn those noed nerds 
---
....what??
---
Nurse's mori is my favorite though.
---
uh
---
I agree,  I honestly don't watch streamers lol. So I have no idea what goes on in a lot of them. 
---
Why are you using her useless perks and NOED ?unless you have no other perks for her.
---
theres no "dbd content" in this meme, the nazi mods are going to remove it!
---
This is how I've always seen it too, it broke him utterly, and after brutally killing his boss he wandered off aimlessly and thoughtlessly and the entity found essentially an empty husk of a person and took that to warp it into the wraith we see today
---
Funnily enough, I always find barrel totems more than totems that are out in the open/easy to see.
---
LOL said no killer ever! if you don't wiggle you will have zero chance of escaping, if they intended to give you the hatch- answer me this...why guard the hatch/patrol it obsessively, why chase? why down? why pick up? None of it makes sense! when i am sparing the last survivor, i let them either walk out the gate or go to the hatch.  
---
Clown really doesn‚Äôt have map pressure unfortunately. You need to focus on a build that gives you an idea of where the survivors are at all times 
---
Hahahaha. Equip bloodhound and sloppy butcher. Viola. You know better than to make a silly comment like that. 
---
I can respect you, you little gremlin main
---
*bitching profusely*
---
It baffles me even further that people still choose to do either of these things when you simply hold S for one second after your second hit. Even easier
---
Are you still able to get it? Honestly would just get it for the mask.
---
He was camping poor Jake after only 1 gen is completed, basically just circling around the shack waiting for someone to save him.  I knew going in it was  suicide mission but I felt sorry for the Jake player.   But the entity seems to think the whole thing is BS and thanks to Borrowed Time, we ended up getting out safely.
---
Having said that, if you are in a chase against one of the two Chainsaw-wielding killers, try to avoid the shack with the basement if you can.  If they down you and put you in the basement, it makes it difficult for the rest of us to save you.  Especially if we are all random and have no means of communicating like in this clip.
---
Iirc It's okay to post nicknames, it's just frowned upon because witch hunting.
---
Amanda was a vulnerable drug addict that John put through one of his games. She was only proof of his 'philosophy' working, but it turns out literally torturing her didn't actually fix her issues. Who could have guessed!
---
Since no one is fixed by John's games, Amanda thought what's the point in them being able to survive anyway? By John's own philosophy if they aren't going to appreciate life either way they don't deserve it.
---
Kramer's whole purpose is and always was bullshit. Amanda's character arc through the films was there to expose that.
---
Hey, I said it takes skill to moonwalk! Only the weak uses easy mode
---
It is an interesting perk against Freddy, actually. Keep an eye on the perk while awake. If it lights up, that's the direction he is. If you're asleep, as long as he can see you, you can see him. I've done it a couple of times and I like it. 
---
You're not really very familiar with coding, are you.
---
I cant see that happening 
---
I feel like Freddy is underpowered because of the dream transition. If there was some sort of like ‚Äúspook‚Äù you could that interrupted a vault or something. But if they‚Äôre just running normally, it gives a small speed boost. As a Freddy main, every chase would be extremely short or even finished with this in mind. Sorry for the long rant, :/
---
It's an ego thing.
---
If a killer is going to give you the hatch then they can give you the hatch.
---
Apparantl some get real salty if you dare to wiggle. Like maybe you're far out and dont just want to give up and figure you might as well try....then they act like cunts about it. Had a huntress do it to me once.
---
It's sad. If I want a survivor to have the hatch then they get the hatch wiggle or no wiggle. In fact is rather them go find it themselves because i cba carrying them around on my shoulder.
---
Me too! I'd love to have one.
---
In the future try to either speed up the walking around or cut it. Basically this clip is way too long for what your trying to show and you‚Äôll get a lot more interaction if you keep it short.
---
Aim for 10sec max, that‚Äôs optimal for attention spans. 
---
They should be rolling it out sooner, the 'end of summer' sounds like they want it in a stable place by the end of summer. But it won't be June for sure.
---
**AAA**
---
Probably my most embarrassing moment is when I try to  self care near a pallet while in chase but instead slow vault it instead. Other than that there was the first time I played pig and tried to crouch around the map which was super bad because the survivors did 3 gens before I even found anyone and got one hook all game and everyone escaped
---
Don't be throwing that *main* around I throughly believe in diversifying my murderers! Now if only I could quit potatoing as a survivor.
---
oh sorry I'm new here, well we were on cowshed i was using her bracelet and father's glasses, and her 3 original perks since i want the trophy, well that guy specifically was destroying my hooks so when i was chasing one guy i saw him so i used my ability when the other guy threw the pallet and went towards him, a few seconds later someone destroyed my haunted grounds totem, i got him in one hit, and hung him in the basement, were he died. one disconnected and managed to kill the other one because the last one left her to die.
---
Yikes.
---
The fucking doctor laughing at me when I try to drop a pallet and it disappears because I‚Äôm in madness.
---
Fake, has to many pixels
---
I feel you with that and hey listen here. I like the little gremlin I'm experimenting at a very bad rank for him
---
Spend yo blood points lol
---
Oof
---
this made my day
---
Very much thank you for translating :\^)
---
Yes, it was a very good and fun match
---
Ebony flashlights. If you get stunned by her she can mori you.
---
I was joking, but people take it too seriously, but I don't like tunneling because I don't like to be tunneled either. It's just so unfun
---
You need to color calibrate your screen.
---
sksosi thats why u gotta be immersed and never get hooked
---
im glad :)
---
That's time management, strategy, and routing: you don't need to burn through ALL the pallets, just the ones near unfinished generators.
---
Leaving chase with someone after eating a few pallets is also a very good idea on that map because the pallet loops are Survivors only defense and, IMO, it's fairly easy to exit chase and find a nearby generator on the Game.
---
I made the mistake of trying legion and now unless I throw matches, I'm completely fucked when I want to play other killers that I'm still learning :/  
---
I really hope they change the ease of ranking, especially with Legion
---
&gt;Ed.....ward
---
Like that?
---
I don't have many perks for her cos I rarely play as her :/
---
That's literally the point of the game. Do you have a mental illness?
---
I‚Äôve only ever had my head popped twice by them. Once when I was a baby survivor and tried to leave with it on and the second time was when the killer was tunnelling me until I died in front of them.
---
It‚Äôs my goal as a Meg main to remove the stigma from the best girl. Some of us are good people who aren‚Äôt toxic and just want everyone to have a good time.
---
Honestly, legion's power drawing seemed like a bunch of scribbles to me, before i stumbled into this post.
---
Tbh I understand it when survivors get stealthy at this point. If you run around you will be found, but if you are stealthy the killer might not find you.

Playing as him or against him? 
---
I find him enjoyable to play but not for too long, he gets repetitive. Killers like The Spirit or Nurse can keep every game interesting or give you a sense of real power and control. 
---
That‚Äôs why you need PWYF to pull it off, it helps a lot, it‚Äôs still a hard achievement to get because of gens getting done and because of the hatch 
---
Xbox, I feel like it‚Äôs gotten worse over the past year

I learned recently that you can actually keep the chainsaw revved with insidious. Don't know if it's a bug, but since his revved saw isn't very loud it still works for basement bubba.

Just thought it looked like a confession booth and that kinda links to the teaser. Also guess I've never noticed it!

"Why is the shark going after the bleeding seal instead of the healthy one?"

Sweet! Will do

Lmao there‚Äôs a Billy Cosplay that looks spot on

Not being tunneled, you're getting sandbagged by your team. -&gt;survivor in chase runs past and unhooked you they know killer will smack you giving them more time 
---
People would use the ‚Äúsignal‚Äù every game to bait others into using their streamers and then not use their own. 
---
oink!
---
I like the way she ‚Äúpets‚Äù their faces
---
I think your memes might be a little too dank for this sub lmao
---
When does the new chapter come out?
---
True, but then it would be a waste of a mori. So both are bad
---
The best case scenario for new DS just like Deliverance, is that you never have to use it, but it's always there, just in case.
---
Now more than ever, killers have a reasonable suspicion everybody has DS, so they'll be wary of instafucking a recently caught survivor in fear of getting DS'd.  It's now like Noed, where just the fact the perk exists leads (or should lead) to survivors taking time to cleanse totems as they find them.
---
I personally live the uncertainty it brings.
---
I mean for 4 man swfs
---
if rank is that important, then play to safety pip. yeah, it‚Äôs an issue that needs to be addressed and fixed, but there‚Äôs no need to constantly bitch and complain. 
---
Or just make it only apply to "safe" unhooks the same way that Deliverance does.
---
I'm more bothered by the one missing fence picket.
---
Or just make the stack apply to safe unhooks only 
---
Not the point. If they don't play toxic, do they still deserve toxicity? They might have an advantage, but that in itself is not necessarily toxic, otherwise SWF wouldn't be a feature in the game at all.
---
Bind struggle to mouse wheel 
---
Everyone quit before I tried,  I think the game bugged out
---
wow, yeah i‚Äôve seen clever use of traps with basement trappers
---
Different person from the one who said they were using both, but bond you can tell if they are being chased once you use it a bit (or if you see the person and then the heartbeat right after). Empathy would just be for telling if they are on the other side of the map I assume.
---
Censorship Claudette saves the day!

The pig IS the food

Daddy3

Werewolf. The only killer that we have that is furthest from human currently is thr hag. We need more beast killers! 
---
oh god why can‚Äôt i stop laughing please fucking help me
---
Haha, I could see that, I suppose he‚Äôs closer to the mean jock archetype than anybody else.
---
I'd say go all in with the "wounded hero" perk.
---
Each protection hit you recieve or safe save you perform gives you an extra 5% dying recover recover and status recover speed.
---
Up to 10/15/20%.
---
You start off healthy, but picking yourself up gives you broken status effect for indefinite/60/30s.
---
That way, it stacks with WGLF and provides you extra defense for sticking your neck out for others.

Did you not pay attention to the movies all the way? She didn't murder an innocent woman out of jealousy despite Kramer telling her not to. She got a note from hoffman, blackmailing her to killer her otherwise he'd expose her for killing Kramers baby. So she was kind of pitted against extreme emotion, otherwise she was likely to let her go. And yeah, she made unavoidable traps, but most of the people she killed were criminals. Basically she didn't believe in rehabilitation and rather just of be best off of they were dead. So she's not as evil as myers, but the one thing that definitly puts her on the evil scale, was she was enlightened when people who were against her, on the side of good, lost against her so theirs that
---
Yeah but see what people are saying is that we know they're fixing the stuff, and it MIGHT be amazing, but even if it is, if you can't get players to play, you can't play it. And you need enough players to fill multiple lobbies, preferably of different skill levels. It's why a lot of Battle Royale games die. They're perfectly awesome and fun games, but they can't fill lobbies, and die no matter how good they are. Even if Deathgarden becomes amazing, we don't see any ways they're going to attract players back.
---
I think there should be automatic push mechanics. It's not just body blocking by killers. Teammates do it too, though I would hope unintentionally. Today I had a match where three of us ended up in the tub room at Lery's. After the killer passed us by, the Jake and I turned to heal the Dwight. Except I was caught between Jake and the edge of the tub so all I could do is spin in circles until they moved. Luckily the killer didn't come back, but I lost out on heal points since I couldn't reach Dwight. Later in the same match I got stuck on the edge of a door frame and sat there like an idiot as the killer downed me. 
---
There's no reason anyone should ever be stuck somewhere. Impede movement speed, yes. But never completely stuck. It's no fun when you face the consequences of being immobile when a killer is after you. 
---
ITS 100% RED
---
Instant map knowledge every time you sleep someone for a debuff that barely affects you. But its on Freddy so people sleep on it sadly.
---
I love these!!! &lt;3 They are awesome :) Are you going to make the male killers? 
---
The worst was that each jungle gym has 2 pallets at it and so did most common loops.
---
What I try to do (if I have enough wiggle time at least) is carry them past a hook after stopping at it. If they keep wiggling, I turn around and hook them. Otherwise they realize that I‚Äôm not carrying them to a hook and stop wiggling. 
---
60fps would be nice and so... But it wouldn't fix the matchmaking problems on console.
---
I've been hearing that the live stream Monday will reveal the new killer. Idk if it's true or not.
---
Same. My only issue is killers being placed with survivors they feel they can't handle, so they run noed and resort to scumbag anti-fun tactics like camping + NOED
---
I forgot about how much they reduced pallets. Any random boxes on mcmillian had two different pallets back to back. I laugh when I hear people complain about how hard it is these days.
---
The spirit kinda reminds me of the corpse bride 
---
I use "F" to struggle on PC because reasons 
---
I kinda see how he wouldn't fit the theme but I think he would still make an interesting addition to the game. If terminator got added that would open the door to more sci-fi killers like Alien and Predator (Who were also guest character in Mortal Kombat X). Seeing this meme I hope that maybe they would consider Predator as a killer now but he definitely fits more into death garden.
---
The only major disappointment I see in these "potential killers" being added to death garden is that it seems purely cosmetic as in they make no difference in gameplay so they have no personality or incentive to get them unless you just like the series they are from. I think that hurts death garden in the long run if they are trying to bring it back. 
---
I‚Äôd be ok with that.
---
Live by the booty, die by the booty.
---
Besides the shit Claudette gets, this is hilarious!
---
I feel your pain. When I see daddy Myers I feel all the blood rushing down to my pants as my dong extends to lenghs I could never understand. Please for the love of god, nerf him. I can't take it anymore
---
I made a Frank and Hillbilly and Wraith and Trapper already 
---
I can relate to this wraith on a deep level...
---
Its the clothes that's the issue 
---
It's movement based.  Standing still and using your killer power won't remove insidious. However, you can hear the chainsaw anyways, so insidious does nothing
---
I wouldn't mind these DS nerfs if my teammates weren't useless as fuck 90% of the time.
---
DS let me have agency over plays, like where altruism would go, where to drag killer, what gens should be rushed and which ones left alone, using tiles correctly/ not wasting good setups.
---
I like being chased.
---
Thankyou. I love the game so had to do some sort of justice to the characters
---
Not for sale, sorry 
---
I would love to see a Doctor one, maybe with slightly different colors of arcs
---
Not yet 
---
üíÄüëç
---
Damn, today's Shitposts have been God Tier.
---
You have to remember a lot of survivors have been burned by trolly killers. Trust is very slim. Some killers (not most, but some) do things like bring a survivor to the hatch, stand there holding them for a second, then hook them.
---
I deserve it alright if no one wants to cleanse totems.  I earned the perk. If I seen you in the mist id slug you with it. 
---
Cheating bans are permanent, and modifying asset files is really, really something an anti-cheat should be looking out for. Modifying asset files would let you do things like make all survivors bright neon pink or possibly even make all objects partially transparent (like Coldwind tiles).
---
As cool as something like this may be, I cannot recommend it unless the devs have explicitly acknowledged that those specific assets are okay to modify. Even if it doesn't ban now because DBD/EAC doesn't asset-check, all it would take is for some asshole to make one of the cheats I mentioned above and for it to get kind of popular and then DBD/EAC would add asset-checking to catch it and boom your account's gone.
---
*screams in bing bong*
---
Agreed. Sadly I do no play it on Xbox. I play on PC.  I was going to invite you to my group, were pretty anti toxic... Unfortunately it's just not possible. Wouldn't it be cool if this game was cross platform tho? Ugh wishful thinking. 
---
Oh! Also I know this sounds a but counterintuitive, but if you join the dead by daylight discord, the community in there pretty well regulated, therefore a lot less toxic, on top of that, you can make friends with people before you even start the game with them. That way they aren't just trash talking you after the game. I've met a couple of really cool beans off of that discord. 
---
The killer hitting you through the window üòé 
---
Yeah it's not terrible for knowledge of killer location, but then why not alert too?!
---
Thanks for info! 
---
I have no respect for remake Freddy. He belongs lower than he already is. By that I mean six feet under.
---
Then back tf up
---
I absolutely love the Freddy and legion ones.
---
I usually try a few tricks and if they don‚Äôt fall for it I give it to them, it is a waist of time to wait so long.
---
No one will take the hatch if you're that close.  
---
lol I had to laugh.
---
-Moonwalking with Franks Mixtape
---
What.
---
*oinks angrily*
---
when you play as meg with the deathgarden mask against a legion
---
They do it just to be assholes.
---
The funniest part is, the more DBD gets balanced, the better survivors are playing (except casual players, obviously).
---
Just look at the guy from this footage, wasting pallets left and right. 
---
Let her go

But what if we make another tier, a higher tier, we shall call it ‚ÄúDamn Boi‚Äù

Instead it‚Äôs the item right in front of the window

I main Spirit but....Huntress to me is #1 saddest story.
---
Damn you, OP......
---
I can't read the title......
---
Quit bitching. None of you have to use it. Its meant to be a challenge perk for a reason. Dumbasses always finding something to bitch about
---
Pig is hard to place because she has like 2 interesting/creative ones then the rest are just super boring and...even bad really.
---
Nurse is fiiiiine, tho.
---
The perk is not that bad, their some thing about using It, like if your playing against sluggers, or your playing resilient, with others perks like leader and prove thyself
---
that is actually very accurate.
---
I wanted Boil Over so bad because I am shit at chases.
---
And then I learn Boil Over is a shit perk. T-T
---
I don't think you understood the tone of my comment. My head starts spinning when everyone ARGUES ENDLESSLY OVER TIERS.. not whatever you thought I meant.
---
What am I looking at?

Had a game where all the gens were done but everyone was healthy, sleep, with my RM stacks and jump rope. It's basically like having a suped up version of Blood Warden lol.
---
Noob question: what is P4?
---
(Laughs angrily in Clown main)
---
(Has lung cancer in Clown main)
---
I didn't see many DS's before, but now? Does that perk even exist?
---
It's a pretty massive nerf, especially to solo survivors whos teammates just leave them on the hook till death.
---
Tell that to the salty players, not us who have to deal with them.
---
Is Pharmacy that important for your build?
---
See, I look at it that way more times than not. While everyone is focused on me being shitty and saying awful stuff, I‚Äôm fine with the occasional face camp! And I‚Äôm totally fine being tunneled as long as I have some time looping and breaking my ankles and then 3 get out. But sometimes it‚Äôs so disrespectful I want to uninstall 
---
who cares 
---
So unbelievably wrong. 
---
As elegant as I imagined. 
---
&gt;But you didn't get hit through a pallet. 
---
In this video, they did get hit thrpugh the pallet, otherwise, if the survivor wasn't on the other side of the pallet, she wouldn't have been able to throw it down. Since she threw the pallet down AND get hit, it's an issue considering hit boxes, not the server.

I showed a screenshot of a chat the russian gf of my brother, she refused to translate it.

If I could post several clips I would. I recorded plenty of gameplay that proves that, but I‚Äôm not worried about people believing me or not. Just a PSA to stop adding to the toxicity. All my clips from this game were reported so I‚Äôm sure these two will be doing this much longer

Yeah I‚Äôve just given up on being frustrated with camping and tunneling. Yeah your going to die but you just move on. Most of the time I get a good laugh out of it so I‚Äôm good no matter what. 
---
This is so amazing! I wish I could draw...
---
Someone else because definitely not me 
---
It got better it was far worse a year ago.
---
I'm pretty new to the game so I'm not sure if this is a hard rule, but I've found in all of my games that no matter where you get downed, the killer can take you straight to hook no matter how hard you wiggle unless something (a survivor, a flashlight, a pallet) gets in the way, so if you're last survivor, then wiggling will do nothing for you except for the v low chance the killer is walking you around to BM (but if a toxic killer really wants to BM, they'll usually bleed you out).
---
The killer version of "back in my day!" 
---
The boomer killers had to pull themselves up by their bootstraps to get their kills. Now the snowflake killers want everything handed to them.
---
That's the way the skill was intended, yes. You can only use it once anyways, and it's not even a guaranteed escape (not that it's super hard to do). That'd be like... if I had a perk that could bug me out so the killer couldn't hit me. I could say, "So I'm just supposed to let the killer hit me instead of using an exploit to be invincible? Cause that's fair, right?".
---
There should be blood on the flashlights lmao
---
Okay I‚Äôll make sure to put on my p3 Claudette and urban around the whole time and waste your time! Would you like that buttercup? :)
---
From what I know EAC doesn't check for these files. I'm using them in-game and have been recording my game play for a few days to test out editing software and the like. I've heard that there was a stream where the devs said this won't ban you for HappyClown's edits either (which I use them but they didn't do killer powers, or addons etc.) I don't have proof of the devs saying this because I saw it in another post but I can just post steady game play using the colored abilities. 
---
Yeah okay buddy lol. 
---
Macros

what are macros

99% of the time Auto aim hurts you as the killer imo.

Thanks for the confidence, fuck it, I'm going for it!

I'm a little upset to see that Behavior is Dead by Daylight-ing up Deathgarden with movie liscenses instead of making the base game work. Don't be me wrong being able to play as the literal Terminator is badass but I'd much rather that the core game be finished first. After the bad reception of the initial idea for Deathgarden they scrapped the whole thing to make it "more Dead by Daylight-esque" and I honestly don't want to try it now cause it looks far too different.
---
Original Deathgarden was fine it was just the garbage anti-cheat that made it unplayable. (Blatant speed hackers and aimbots in every other match is fuuuuun) Now I'm really worried that the "Dead by Daylight but worse" accusation is going to be true.
---
Will again say that a Terminator DLC is cool, and that the T-800 really wouldn't fit DbD. A robot walking through walls and shooting up P3 Claudettes would really break this game's core design, though I have to admit it would bring me great catharsis to watch that.
---
^lul ^emotions ^are ^for *^squaaaaares*
---
I posted my thread to state that campers and tunneling makes you bad. I don‚Äôt owe you shit in regards to a argument or discussion. I stated how I felt and that‚Äôs THAT so nice try.   
---
This editing makes me want to kill my self 
---
In short: game is becoming Dead by Daylight with guns.
---
Not with Save the Best For Last. But... still, that's good to know, actually 
---
Tell me to move on, on my thread. LMFAO

What a weirdo

I wish the Traps were more of a Steely color like that in game. With Logwood dye they'd appear more tarnished, and the Tar Bottle could essentially look like grill finish. 
---
You are a complex person
---
I have absolutely no idea why Freddy's aura can't be seen when you're not asleep. It serves no purpose. It doesn't add anything to Freddy as a Killer: it just serves to frustrate and annoy. ~~Something something Freddy in a nutshell.~~
---
They‚Äôre toxic everywhere. They still linger around Friday the 13th using hacks to drive cars through cabins.  I‚Äôll be brutally honest, some of my most unpleasant games have involved players from Eastern Europe.
---
My argument is, if you cannot add pressure throughout the game without singling one person out, you‚Äôre BAD. I main spirit and I can get all 4 people with no gens done back to back to back. Because I‚Äôm not shit at this game 
---
See my point? 
---
This was suggested before and I'd honestly love it.
---
If anything I'd buy a nice dress shirt for my wide boii.
---
yeah, I get told a lot less nice version of that a lot...
---
The "yeeting off the hook in the killer's face once per game for no real reason" build.
---
I was more than sure that I wouldn't laugh.
---
Dangit.
---
Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm pretty sure this is a desync issue. I have dodged huntress hatchets before and seen them sail past into a tree, then I get teleported back 10 m and I'm on the ground. The hosts client just corrected mine and was like, "no, actually that did hit you." There is nothing you can do in that case, it's just a bad connection.
---
I mean someone's posted mime concept art before, but no actual mockup.
---
Tried using a window, got teleported back 10 feet after running. Tried using it again, got teleported back through and the killer hit me.  
---
This is moreso salt that this has happened on 2 different maps and has caused me to depip both times
---
Obelix skin would do us good
---
Aw thank you man! All it takes is a paper and pen(cil) to draw :D If you have those, you can totally draw!!!!
---
Sorry bro, I don't mean to be condescending, but do you know what a network is?
---
DBD has a peer-to-peer network, where the killer's computer acts as the host for the game. Whatever the killer sees is realtime in the game. What survivors see are not realtime - this is because it takes time to send information from a survivors computer to the host computer. Because of this, Survivors will ALWAYS be a few miliseconds off realtime. 
---
Although in the video the pallet was thrown down, the packages of information (packets) were not sent in time to the host. This is often referred to as latency. So, technically, in realtime, the survivor did NOT throw down the pallet. In fact, she probably never made it past the pallet. The killer (realtime) would see a perfectly normal hit.
---
Hitboxes are for the most part fine. 
---
The issue is that the devs decided to base DBD on a peer-to-peer system. Changing the networking of an entire game is a huge project, hence why dedicated servers are not coming for awhile. Dedicated servers will fix this because a single computer is incharge of processing and transferring information between all 5 players, instead of the killer just doing it themselves. You could say in this way, all players experience equal latency.
---
P4=Bloody Flashlights
---
Or distortion with how fast he burns it off
---
Or killer would see the 'signal' and pick their favorite killer with sweatiest build and make the match hell and the streamers a waste for most survivors. "Oh your using streamers then I guess I offer my black ward/ebony mori" lol. 
---
I'm rank 2 and my last match was against a rank 18 lol
---
I actually broke my X button when i played dbd...
---
I've been swatted down next to a hook, picked up, walked past the hook (so I stop wiggling, thinking they're going to give me hatch) just to be hooked NEXT TO THE HATCH.
---
I always wiggle. 
---
Basically if you hit someone with a close-ranged hatchet you can often catch up to them immediately after their speed boost and finish the job with a melee hit. It's a very nice way for huntress to quickly down a full health survivor
---
Nurse would be fine if it was just easier to make mistakes. Once you're good at Nurse, everyone else is fucked forever. It might take a while to get there, but that's a small consolation for every solo survivor you go against.
---
Honestly I'm surprised the amount of times it amounts of hits I dodged with this
---
Oh absolutely, she's nuts in the rights hands, but I'm fortunate enough at rank 6 that I still haven't played against a Nurse better than me so I have no issues in the slightest.
---
Or... Or... Crazy thought to even think about... it‚Äôs a totally different game that‚Äôs in the same genre and made by the same dev company which is about it and if you like DBD more that‚Äôs fine some people like DG so don‚Äôt join everyone else in being toxic saying its a dead game or DBD 2. If you want to play DBD, play DBD. Don‚Äôt like the state the DBD is in because finding a match is just as long as Deathgarden queue times? Play a different game ffs noob3 asks multiple times why we‚Äôre still here :/
---
Also sorry to be short me and my friend are playing apex and randoms keeps taking wraith I need a new main
---
I really, really doubt this. I have come across a real hacker before and he said he has only had one account banned in years. Admitted to hacking openly and said he didn‚Äôt give a crap if he was reported. It was blatant hacking with speed boost and worse. If you don‚Äôt take hacking seriously I can‚Äôt imagine that griefing is taken seriously. Although I‚Äôm sure hacking accusations are higher because of BBQ and such. 
---
Because killers don't fake bringing you to the hatch ever.
---
Would his weapon and bottles be invisible?
---
im sure im gonna do that soon enough
---
QQ. 
---
Literally never heard of this game. 
---
Same here I'm just playing more killer now instead.
---
Even at red ranks on PS4 I very commonly see 3-4k on almost every game.
---
Cyka
---
There will always be killers like that. Dont know why you people still crying like it will change. Numerous posts about this. Just tired of yall complaining like your the first one to say something about it. We know lol.
---
don't wiggle = get hooked
---
I don't know why I didn't think of that and it would help a lot with survivors with 'dead hard'
---
naahhh
---
I mean, I can agree with everything except for saying that Survivor points are balanced. As a Survivor, a minimum of 1/4 of your points per game are locked up in actually making it out of the trial alive, not to mention the scarcity of boldness points unless you're going to go out of your way to get chased by the killer.
---
When I play killer even without BBQ I can get probably 20-25k per game. With BBQ it's 50k. Survivor games barely get 15k unless you survive. That's a pretty big difference.
---
Cool. Well here‚Äôs another posts of ME saying how I feel! Thanks!  Move along now :‚Äô)
---
It‚Äôs just my rule lol. Sometimes I‚Äôm just tryharding so I won‚Äôt give it either way, but if they wiggle when I wanted to give it, I don‚Äôt most of the time.
---
Why don‚Äôt they just remove collision for like 5 seconds if the killer is standing in the same spot for long periods of time and if they aren‚Äôt running insidious ? Seems like an easy fix 
---
I do agree, it's just a matter of improving at the game. As killer I like to give survivors chances and avoid crutch perks/everything that irritates me as a survivor (the issues you mention).
---
I'm usually nervous to be honest in case people get upset about it though. I imagine a lot of it comes from those who only main a single side, people who play both seem to understand frustrations with the game better imo. There really isn't a need for people to get so defensive over it, I never understood.
---
The phrase "X makes you bad" can be said for a lot of things, "Ruin makes you bad, just pressure the gens more" or "DS makes you bad, learn to loop and play sneaky". OFC a perk and a playstyle are very different. But when it comes to tunneling of the hook it makes sense, why would I go for the person that I need to hit twice or use my power on (in the case of Hillbilly or LF) when I can just M1 the other guy once. Same can be said for camping (playing defensively), if you know the survivors are overly altruistic and are just lurking around waiting for you to leave. That means no one is on a gen meaning they are not doing the objective. 
---
Are you on console or PC? I was going to suggest you clear your cache or uninstall and reinstall the game
---
Well we all know that, but the devs are brain dead, look at the code they have written! I bet if we walked into there crack crash team of coders they so like to praise so much,  we all would turn and run in horror the opposite direction.
---
Actually its Brazilian portuguese,my bad, good to know its the same in spanish tho.

Fuuuuck

I made many videos like this, I posted them on youtube, if you are interested I can tell you my channel

Oink!

 STOP MESSING AROUND ADAM AND START WORKING ON DA GENS!!! 
---
Doing a Great skill check on Console. If you do one anyone else on the gen will try and do one. 75% of the time they mess up. I remember having this exact situation happen and when I went to make fun of them I exploded the gen. Then I heard a Myers tier up.

That hex spawn has been there for months and it seems to have a higher fucking chance of being picked for whatever dam reason. I‚Äôve spawned with that totem spawn that past 3 times I‚Äôve played that map.
---
What Im saying lmao. This dude a example of how people keep crying over something futile. Wants attention I guess.
---
He 100% doesnt. Whats so hard about someone with speed, lunge, and ability to make people scream by just needing to be near them. All along with stupid op perks like overcharge.
---
Delet this.
---
Does everyone get the same daily? Even so, i would expect to get some variation. 
---
I get to rank 1 every reset on killer and usually get to around rank 3 as surv because i used to play surv a lot but killer has been funnier.
---
Haha fuck, this meme actually made me laugh.
---
The game detected the killer was legion so it decided to save you from a world of hurt

Those brackets were just harsh 
---
It needed to be changed but I don't like how short it is. 60 seconds just isnt long enough. I mean the killer can honestly just wait it out already if he wants its a minute. I think it should have a longer timer but otherwise I think the DS change is great.
---
I play both sides, so I know how it is. But unless the group is toxic to me, I'm not toxic to them either. I've played both Killer and Survivor in red ranks, and while 4 man SWFs can be toxic, I've had some good matches too without toxicity. It really depends on the group. No need for toxic behaviour when it's not necessary in my opinion. When they teabag at every corner, feel free to do whatever.
---
It‚Äôs usually like this, just cus of how far hooks are apart, but from time to time the generation really plays against killers and won‚Äôt put hooks in an area of the map, or sometimes hooks will be broken, either from sabotage or sacrifice.
---
Also who knows maybe the killer will walk into a rock like I do cus I‚Äôm fucking brain dead.
---
Haha
---
Well youre lucky, i havent run into a sigle r man that doesnt be toxic
---
Coordination like this gives the survivors a huge advantage (not like they have one already....)
---
But it's true lol pink and crimson red. 
---
Evil within 4
---
I doesn't take a SWF to cleanse hex totems tho. 
---
Whenever I notice that the killer has TOTH, this is usually what goes down.
---
I start cleansing his hex, he comes towards me. I start running and he immediately drops chase and runs back from where he came. It obviously means someone else touched his other totems so I just start cleansing mine again.
---
It doesn't take a SWF to do that, just brains. 
---

Apparently you can't read. 
---
Apologies on the gender part. But what could you possibly be asking here? You offered nothing that hasnt been said already. Are you expecting different responses? Beacuse these are all the same.
---
Real Answer Tho: Because he's in Russia and you're not, so your connection is probably a bit bad. So what you see on your screen is not what he sees on his screen, and because killer hosts, what HE sees is the reality of the situation.
---
Amusingly enough, him answering in Russian was all the answer you really needed to know why you got hit through the window ;)
---
Now I can run DS against killers and not be a scumbag, because it only works against tunnelers. I played a game with a guy who camped and tunneled everyone.
---
I can't wait to DS every douchebag killer who does this.

---
Incorrect
---
Punish them.
---
Haddonfield and Resort are small maps and therefore are killer sided, plus not many loops   
---
Coldwind is fucking humongous and because of that has alot of pallets and because of that it's hard to keep pressure, plus the jungle gyms are see through so no mind games so....  
---
Lerys is NOT killer sided, there are a shit load of hiding places, and unless your freddy, it's super dark in most corners so its impossible to find a Detective Tapp  
---
Swamp maps fuck everyone equally  
---
and those are the only things I disagree with but I like the rest of the list 
---
Not really, i just skimmmed through and read your comment as if you were implying killer was unbalanced at one point. I wasnt surprised because its r dbd

You can use M&amp;A and physically walk around with him with basically the same effect.

Decided to hit rank 1 this month, I'm at rank 2 and honestly might say fuck the achievement. High rank players are absolutely no fun to play with. Camping, tunneling, BM, and super tryhard builds (iredecent head, mori and noed on huntress a couple matchs ago)

Bill is amazing and it really makes me sad to see people that play him like a selfish asshole because it couldn't be further from what he is.
---
To be honest it's been so long since the last time I played it I don't even remember
---
Red Rank really doesn't mean much. All it takes is an average player with a lot of time put in the game to reach red ranks.
---
You could probably run dbd on a gameboy color if you wanted. 
---
I think my favorite rank is 10 for both survivor and killer. It's the not tryhard sweetspot

You can see he was midway through the pallet and was then teleported back once he was stunned. He must've hit you before you finished dropping it.

Maybe try not being so hostile? It was a 10 word reply. But ok.

_fcking cries in hillbilly_*oh wait*
---
I like these but I feel the colors are weird. Let me explain.
---
‚Ä¢ The Trapper's Bear Traps are a more peach/brown color than silver.
---
‚Ä¢ The Wailing Bell is made from cast iron and cast iron isn't that bronze color. It looks more like a dark brown/black in game and real life.
---
‚Ä¢I believe the effect around Freddy is ment to be white/bluish, similar to the effect the side of your screen when you're in the Dream World.
---
‚Ä¢ The Spirit's skin isn't that blue, it's more of a grey if anything.
---
I think they said a new chapter every 3 months, so around 20 chapters?
---
I wasnt aware the ds changes had been applied I used it yesterday and it doesnt seem any different

Seeing him could slowly turn your screen to static with an ultra rare consumable.

Otherwise, maybe have super long reach?  And/or carry two survivors at once?
---
I'll struggle because I'm afraid they want to take me to the basement. 
---
Chapter 14 would be the first chapter of the next year
---
I love Bill. I kinda doubt the suicidal thing, he just knows exactly what must be done by the end of The Sacrifice.  He's old and beaten, infected with a disease that is incurable and will soon kill him (and I don't mean the zombie infection). He'd much rather give his life saving the few people left on earth that he cares about who he knows have much more potential left in life. He's easily one of the best examples of a character that faces death to save those he loves. [He doesn't go down easy, he's defiant til the end, satisfied with the knowledge that the people he cares about are saved by his final actions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndNzd108IJw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=536) Any time I play him in DbD I try my hardest to live up to his actions.
---
I'm still stuck at Rank 20, because i just can't get that damn pip regardless if i escape or not :(
---
Agreed. If we paid money for a dlc WE were interested in let us play it however we want to play said character. If we want to main them even at high rank let us do so. This isnt siege with its pick and ban system just because you hate it doesn't mean theres an overall rule we cant use it.
---
I thought Evolve got shut down early and they didn't let the team finish the game to their disappointment. I mean the same interview I saw they also said they wanted the game to kinda be like left 4 dead but through alien landscapes with monsters instead of zombies but nobody wanted that game (Publishers).

Freddy A tier. What kind of fucking drugs are you on?
---
I disagree with about 70% of this tier list

What if you don‚Äôt heal after being rescued? Then that means your right back on a gen working. I survivor main and I never heal after my initial hit because I run dead hard and resilience lol.

This has to be a shitpost

oh like the flashlight spam
---
Most of the time I am. But there are occasions where my fellow survivors or a killer act like shit heads and ruin a match for me. But it gets made up for when I get a really good team, or a killer takes pity on me when the rest of my team rage quits. It‚Äôs different every time I play.
---
Gotta counter deliverance farmers!!
---
Yes. Playing SWF is really fun and I usually don‚Äôt get angry unless I‚Äôm facing a slugging nurse then it gets a lil annoying. Killer I have a lot of fun doing builds like anti-looper clown or even INSIDIOUS BUBBA.
---
Cause it's super ez to make lol
---
i actually screamed 
---
I doubt there will be a slenderman killer.
---
Wow. What a surprise. 
---
I don't even need to look at anything else. Freddy being A tier invalidates the list. 
---
(„Å•Ôø£ ¬≥Ôø£) bring it on
---
You get 1 in the dream world and if having trouble finding others, you can let insidious help you track them to the others. Either they find others and then you can drag them in, or you can just put them back in it they do a gen escape. Plus, I don't hit them, so they can't self-care out of the dream world.
---
And tunnel isn't exactly right, it just means I wont play nice with the obsession my goal is to kill them before they find the ruin totem.
---
Nah, it would be like Myers with tentacles
---
Calm down everyone it's just a shitpost in disguise
---
My favorite part of being a killer is sacrificing or Mori a chronic T-bagger, and they disconnect. 
---
This is good, because it can be used in the second state, where an emote would look silly while fighting off the entity.

But they play Spirit *so* much better than everyone else, you see.
---
How is it abuse to tell your team where the totems are? Even if it isn‚Äôt a SWF most survivors will hunt down ruin if they know you have it, even if you have Toth they‚Äôll still rush it.
---
Most of the time it's fun. Killers who tunnel or camp ruin it though

ok.

I have fun but I have not been playing recently because match making is taking so fucking long

If you know they are annoying, why post it to begin with? 
---
Just finished a game and levelled up 
---
Got a pretty bitchin' screen shot, though!
---
Because I acknowledge that they've become annoying, but wanted to share my tiernkist to spark discussion.
---
Or a killer that takes shape as a survivor so you could all meet up and just stare at each other like I knowwww
---
Record it, get their name, and then send them in. If a killer does this for more than 5 minutes, you can submit a report on the support website. People say the devs don't ban, but they do.
---
Freddy  is A tier, if A stands for ass
---
Freddy's isn't that bad actually, the thing is everyone say he is bad cause they do not know how to play him, so a lot of people stay away form him. Once you get into a game with a good Freddy he can be more effective than most killers.
---
Wtf
---
üëå
---
Dang you beat me to it Cookie, i was gonna do huntress new years cosmetic too but it's all good.
---
Looking great BTW!
---
I've been wanting to do one of the Hallowed Blight cosmetics just dont know how to go about certain parts for Billys and Wraiths.
---
(Essentially wearing it and taking it off)
---
My god. That is a cute cat. 
---
Agreed there. It‚Äôs extremely short of a time limit 
---
Class photo is gewt, people complain about the time it takes to put people in the dreamstate but it really really really doesnt matter yeah sure everyone once in a rare while you'll have them finish a gen in your face. But it almost never happens to me. Most times they get put in the dreamstate they wait on the gen for a while and then take off you can bait this to get gen pulls by pretending to walk away after someone else who took off.
---
Any of the dresses. Survivors will sit there and try to get skill checks on mega long heals and that only helps you.
---
But just play his strengths and dont let them take advantage of his weaknesses.
---
Don't leave survivors injured. Down them and leave them if you have to. Keep everyone else healthy and in the dreamstate. 
---
9/10 times you can catch survivors out of the dream state run straight at the person on the hook thinking that they get a free unhook but in reality all they are doing is giving you the ability to put them in the dreamstate and then put the "target" back into a chase and in the dreamstate. Yes its tunneling. But that's one of his strengths.
---
Just remember them being injured is a bad thing. Because they have the ability to take themselves out of it and wake people up. But you can definitely slug them if you need time. Especially if you cant find one that's not in the dream state he will come out of hiding to help they cant hide near gens because they never do it right because they dont know if you have line of sight. A lot of times they will be super discouraged to get on gens. Getting dying light off makes it impossible for them to get out.
---
Freddy is bad objectivity due to having to sleep to hit. But that being sad he is a really fun killer. I personally like to play him perkless to fuck with survivors and it generates some good salt when you destroy a SWF with him. 
---
This would be unrelated content, but I have acted exactly like this before.
---
Probably. I run it on a Windows surface pro, which is basically an iPad with a keyboard
---
Did you mean to start working on this gen and pull yourself into the trap, or did you want to actually disarm the trap?  Sorry bro.
---
Insidious legit catches people off guard on mikey. Get your ass to tier III and hide somewhere you'll know they'll be. At T3, survivors aren't really worried about myers jumpscaring them because he has an actual terror radius now. Not the case with insidious!
---
Yeah thats really my only issue is the time limit its too short. Honestly 2 or 3 minutes would be great.
---
Yep, for that though i would recommend just changing it to scroll wheel
---
spirit is definitely higher . she could prolly be s+
---
At base, shes pretty men. Too addons dependent.
---
&gt;Evan
---
Chamber with wooden doors btw
---
Why do people even bother making these posts... For karma? Everyone knows it goes the exact same way if you just replace survivor with killer.
---
No creativity on this sub at all
---
This is exactly why shirtless Myers will never come out. The simultaneous nut of all dead by daylight players will destroy all servers.
---
 But the professor accidentally added an extra ingredient to the mix... toxicity. 
---
And he was playing Adam, perfect
---
I love them they are so cute &lt;3
---
With addons, yes, without, no.
---
True SWF does give an edge to good players, that being said they should still be allowed because it adds an extra layer of difficulty and fun IMO. If SWF fucks you up this badly dodge SWF‚Äôs or play more sweaty (nurse, NOED). 
---
Would love this. Part of his character is that he taunts them, so it is kind of a shame that he doesn't do that. But, at the same time, the wrong voice would ruin it
---
Ignoring everything that the survivor has to defend themselves if they can right click real good is dumb. 
---
I was going for a spray-paint look. The images are very small so having them brighter colors makes it easier to see. That and the ability background is a dark brown so if I were to use dark brown it wouldn't really show up. I do appreciate the feedback :) I'll definitely consider changing them if they don't look that good in game.
---
If you could see my Nurse on PS4 lol.
---
Yeah, fuck xbox
---
Why is a p3 Claudette scarier than Freddy? LOL
---
They reset on the 13th, but there is basicly no reason to rank up in this game. 
---
It's literally the killers only objective. 
---
Well you do that and then look down that way you can get really close to the Survivor without the chase restarting.
---
They're native to Nepal
---
Fucking tunneled. 
---
The broken hooks and all the wounds are from the Entity. Some killers are forced by the Entity because they didn't want to kill for it while others were happy to do so without being forced. Devs said the more deformed the final killer form is, the less willing they were to kill at the start.
---
You're the last survivor and you've just been downed, it doesn't matter where they take you? You're the last survivor, what difference does it make if you get hooked in the basement or not.
---
Black Hole Billy
---
Not if you actually pay attention. You hit them, back up a little so the chase ends and look straight down. You can easily follow the scratch marks and/or blood and you're able to see a little bit of the Survivor before the chase restarts. So if you see their legs you slow down or back up if you need to.
---
It always works.
---
I've noticed that if you do this in an open space and the survivor runs for max distance, you usually do not even need to look elsewhere as by the time you "catch up," the timer is low enough for you to swing one more time and have them. 
---
He is Asserting dominance
---
Same tho; if you‚Äôre the last around you‚Äôre already dead, don‚Äôt make it harder for me to help you you little shit
---
it also looked like he was attempting to sandbag. If I was that killer, i too would ignore the trio and go for him for being an asshole
---
It's called interp it's not a difficult concept
---
True, but if you get downed straight off hook and you‚Äôre right under it you‚Äôll get to use your Decisive if you‚Äôre running Breakdown. If you‚Äôre not, you won‚Äôt get to use your Decisive unless someone body blocks which probably won‚Äôt happen. 
---
\&gt;Haddonfield  
---
\&gt;killer-sided  
---
It is the loopiest of loop maps, and has tons of sight-breaks, meaning killers will have a very hard time gaining (and maintaining) Bloodlust.  
---
But sure, it's killer-sided because "it's small."
---
Doctor and Clown should have their own talk show where they just laugh at random shit together
---
This was the situation in this game. I could stand on the top of the house and just watch.
---
LF should be on a completely different tier saying ‚ÄúHas Add Ons that don‚Äôt work.‚Äù
---
The blocks are hardly effective on Freddy, and yes, addonless Freddy is easily F tier. With addons I could see arguments made for B tier but A tier with no addons? God no.
---
Spirit is amazing without addons and with addons she becomes nigh nurse tier. 
---
If you can genuinely think of a way in which Freddy is better than spirit at base then props to you, I‚Äôll be waiting.
---
Piggy add ons are ok I think, but players seldom use the right ones for the playstyle they have.
---
If they plan on tunneling the trapped victim, blindness and exhaustion should be used.
---
If they want the traps to waste time, more boxes, more traps, rigged timers, box add ons...
---
If they want dash attacks to be useful, straps, tape, Amanda's letter...
---
But a few of them could be made a bit stronger. Or combined. 
---
If your talking about frames and how choppy it is. Yeah but I haven‚Äôt tried pc so I don‚Äôt really know but if your talking about my actual character movement. The person had boil over. But I‚Äôm sure your talking about the first thing.
---
They look great! I'd love to give em a try once you complete it!
---
Even better when you have a mori
---
Basically everything that u/ThePowerOfCutleries said.
---
* Haddonfield and Resort have an ungodly amount of loops and you have to be Rank 50 not to see them.
---
* People keep saying that Coldwind is much worse than I personally think. There aren't nearly as many pallets in my mind, though the jungle gyms are awful.
---
* Lery's is Killer Sided as hell. It's the smallest map in the game (objectively) and everything is a bright shade of white which makes Claudette (and Tapp) easy as hell to see.
---
I find legions relationship still very interesting with jeff, considering they were all in highschool together (implied).
---
You can only imagine how now they interact when back together in the fog, with Legion still as teenagers gone down a dark path, while Jeff is much older and has created a life for himself.
---
Mine is the normal sensitivity for console. 50 and 50. I‚Äôm not the type of person to mess with settings for games much.
---
I own Deathgarden and played it before the changes and loved it. Now it really seems like they're making it Dead by Daylight with guns which is really pushing me away from the game.
---
Agreed
---
Proud of ya
---
This is console so we don‚Äôt have post game chat
---
I thoroughly enjoy the game every time I play and honestly that's WHY I still play. If I didn't I would play something else, so maybe you should. Toxic players can really be a shame, but I've learned to ignore them and I have also learned that it's okay if the other completely dominates me. It's unreasonable to feel frustrated when you lose in a game and I feel like DBD players for some reason get pissed off when they lose as if they're entitled to win. I see a lot of that on both sides.
---
It's almost like the killer is standing right there
---
As a survivor, more fun than I've ever had before. 
---
Playing killer, it can be a lot to manage at once and mentally/emotionally exhausts me from time to time. If I'm facing a team that doesn't use the map well and mismanages their own time, I wind up with a less stressful game but still not satisfying because I know I succeeded due to their flaws. Against a team that cater their loadouts to finish the game asap and don't fall for mindgames or the like? I feel like I'm in the no-fun zone anyways.
---
Perhaps allow survivors to kill themselves instantly if they are on the struggle state, (preventing players from repeatedly half unhooking them to troll them). 
---
Not fixing the problem OP states but is still a problem. 
---
#BRUTAL KILLER
---
There was a clicky clicky feng with DS in my game. I ignored until all gens were done then rancored her. It was rewarding
---
She was going for the achievement, I forgot what it‚Äôs called..
---
I‚Äôd rather play survivor because I can chill out and don‚Äôt have to fully concentrate. Two different roles, so no I don‚Äôt have options. 
---
I dont think Slenderman would be a good idea. 12 year olds tried killing their friend as a sacrifice to him.
---
Bubba‚Äôs so cute he‚Äôs off the charts.
---
Nice!
---
Really? Trapper can be GOD!
---
Well I've never come across moonwalking
---
But have you ever seen a Taurie?
---
Funniest comment yet.
---
Same, one of the few because I know that feel.
---
Im fucking dying üíÄ
---
Was going to comment that too! I saw it in a video by Ussylis, seems to be pretty usefull actually.
---
Just smack her 
---
Thanks.
---
Me and my friends after we hear a joke
---
1. Killer coin offerings stack with the survivors‚Äô coin offerings.
---
2. 1mil BP would take you from level 1 to 35-40. So a bit more than 1mil
---
3. No idea
---
Boo..... give us candyman.
---
Because most like to be trolls once they realize theyre actually ass at the game. Or their ochido fans.
---
Which Leatherface add-ons don't work? I've heard this said a few times before.
---
yes, ive been doing it since i started playing
---
And when Billy finally gets his chainsaw back, it's covered in chili
---
Doc is not easy my guy
---
What‚Äôs a mock-up?
---
Lol, nice guy much?
---
Hasn't some one made this? Like happy clown I think?
---
Yeah when people use boil over it's used against them and I laugh in Myers voice.
---
Ik but what‚Äôs that really got to do with it if that was the case the multiple movies about wouldn‚Äôt be out
---
I have fun unless it‚Äôs against Legion. 
---
So you just choose to ignore half the game and insist on whining that there aren't enough killers for you to get survivor games. 
---
If more people like you played killer lobbies wouldn't be an issue. We need more killers.
---
Is it allowed? Yes. Should it be allowed? Hell no.
---
Playing wraith on haddonfield. Chased someone to a roof, I vaulted the window didn‚Äôt see them and dropped down. I looked back up at the roof and wanted to uninstall. I had been window teched. I always check and I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt on the map everyone tries to window tech on. 
---
Maybe that‚Äôs just embarrassing to me though because I know better.
---
[**DAMN IT, I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT UNTIL YOU POINTED IT OUT!](/intensifies). I'm embarrassed now
---
Ive ran through the perimeter before and that wasnt the case. I ran back and forth through both of the exits multiple times. I had to wait until my teammates left so I could get the hatch
---
Why aren‚Äôt we funding this?
---
I'm not being Contrarian but Freddy is O.K. ATM. Does he need buffs? Yes. But I'd argue he's still mid-tier if you use the blocks. 
---
Anywho, the re-work was set for Winter but the devs haven't said anything so who knows? 
---
He isnt good.
---
His traps do fuck all because you can stealthily nullify them forcing him to waste more time setting up again. Also they rarely catch survivors anymore because of the ways around them such as DH.
---
Agreed, theyve been caught up in the seven second fedora man bad meme so much that they can't think for themselves lmao
---
Yeah, he can do all that, but that doesn't mean he isn't extremely easily abusable and has no way to stop that.
---
but killing is fun
---
Start a petition, i haven't even seen someone try doing that.
---
You can‚Äôt honestly put Wraith over Trapper
---
Full video on my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oQnw6JIn9g) for the ones intrested :)
---
It's too late. 
---
Completely right dude. Freddy only needs two buffs.
---
1. No action progress in the Dream Transition
---
2. Longer base range on the power
---
Thats it.
---
It's sweaty to play Nurse, but not sweaty to use Discord? ok
---
They need to add some colorization packs into the ingame store!, looks great. 
---
Blocks arent that good man, use range addons dresses and Class Photo
---
Start one for next chapter
---
Pretty much this. Her power only gives her so much map pressure with it's timer that she has to refill. In chases shes pretty good but she doesn't slow down the game and isnt stealthy. She needs addons.
---
Tier 1 myers' wig got stolen
---
I just did and explained why multiple times.
---
To be completely fair though, if you do hit the farmed guy, you're occupying 2 people away from gens while you can go chase the original "unhooker" (because if you chase the original unhooker, then someone else has to come out and save him, and likely heal him). I try not to do this but I am kind of sympathetic with people when people do it to me because I know what it's like to have a pretty disheartening losing streak, and you can't deny that the sooner a game turns into at least a 3v1, the more likely you are to have a very dominant game. I'm not trying to say that going for the unhooker isn't the more moral option, but I am saying that I can understand why people take the opportunity that is handed to them by a farming survivor. Or maybe I'm just a madcozbad salty killer main, who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
I love the idea that Clown and Doctor are laughing at Survivors getting sacrificed, but then Clown starts to keel over and Doc starts laughing at him too. xD
---
I mean, *do they really even think?*
---
Every 13th the game is hell for about a week 
---
So what? He gets abused on that, but more than makes up for it with his other abilities. He's not bad.
---
Holy fuck
---
I dont think the game tells them you have TotH, but Discord communication and the killer reacting to you touching his totem is a red flag.
---
why is billy's saw blade colored brown, it needs to be black, gray, or silver.. the brown looks weird bro.
---
If you're on PC, I recommend enabling Nvidia Shadowplay to record the part 5+ minutes of your gameplay, or you can up it but the file size will be way higher. If you're on an AMD card there's something similar to shadowplay but I don't know what it's called.
---
All consoles have a "record" option, I have no idea how to do it but I know you can record current gameplay and the past X amount of seconds of gameplay. Make sure it captures the event, and if possible the end-game screen with their name. When you make a ticket on the support site, you'll need to supply the devs will all information that the little text boxes asks you for, I know on steam you'll have to use some sites to get some number code of both your profile and the person you're reportings code. You basically put their steam URL into some website and it gives you that code. There's a few other things you'll need to put in as well, but it tells you how to do it.
---
I highly recommend putting your footage on an unlisted youtube video as the support site sucks when it comes to uploading big files, so upload it to youtube, set it to unlisted, and link the video in the description of your report.
---
This meme format is fucking terrifying pls delete
---
Totem confusion: Interesting idea but creating more totems and not notifying survivors might be OP. Could just masks the hex totems for 2/3/4 survivors.
---
Scream control: like it
---
One at a time: interesting but I don't know how useful it would be.
---
Last attack: nope.
---
Progressive pain: probably not as useful as stridor.
---
Deep cut: nope.
---
Blinded by fear: I like it
---
That's what the legends want you to believe. We are only witnessing 0.2% of his power.
---
Spirit is better than hag, especially without addons and is arguably better than billy due to having superior chase potential. Hag has to hope her traps do well to be good and good survivors will not allow this to happen in most cases. With addons it‚Äôs a bit of a different story with hag but we aren‚Äôt talking about addons. In Billy‚Äôs case, he has better map control than spirit without a doubt but his chase potential is not on the same level as spirit. She‚Äôs the only killer that can compete with nurse in that sense (not counting legion). 
---
People have tried to think of ways for Freddy to be better than nurse, none of them have been even remotely correct thus far. Now again, I‚Äôll be waiting for your reasoning. 
---
‚ÄòSoon, I‚Äôll make it‚Äô
---
Fucking this, I only play solo and it‚Äôs nice to actually be able to get the second chance when I would otherwise die on the hook or not even have enough gens done to spawn hatch
---
cool concept but it is sadly unlikely
---
I love autohaven maps, I think it‚Äôs the color and the background that does it for me
---
An attempt at being funny was made
---
lmao stfu you fuckin poptart lmao i‚Äôm 7.3 btw
---
Hillbilly looks a bit off but these are pretty great
---
I thought it was ¬Ø\\_(0-0)_/¬Ø there are like 50 posts about how survivors will be complaining about the DS changes
---
Proudness: Maybe after healing or Unhooking but not for finishing a main objective.
---
Locker escape: nope.
---
Mending professional: nope.
---
Learned the lesson: I don't think it would be that useful
---
Debt: nope.
---
I just can‚Äôt get through a game of dead by daylight without being flustered by that hunk of man meat, I just get all hot and sweaty and can‚Äôt control myself. If he isn‚Äôt removed soon I‚Äôm gonna need to buy a new pc, the keyboard is getting real sticky
---
Damn that actually looks cool as hell.
---
No, you.
---
I tried inviting that drkflame666 guy to the discord server, he stayed for about 2 minutes, argued for a bit then left lmao
---
I play a t3 Laurie and other than once to see how it worked gameplay wise I never use the perk.
---
Just had to play an entire match with no HUD? Whats up with that.
---
How?
---
Just got another rank 20
---
Guess so 
---
My favorites are cold wind, Haddonfield and the preschool.
---
I‚Äôm not joining any more discord servers after the last one. People were massively circlejerking one another and there were 1 or 2 people genuinely saying Freddy is better than nurse. Not worth the chromosomes sadly. 
---
If you believe that spirit is worse than Freddy, you must have some reasoning to back up this belief. Would you care to tell me it?
---
Wait. Did you just call deliverance sweaty?
---
95% of people using discord to play are on there because they have friends that they want to play with.
---
Serious question, how does it run? Cheap student here looking for a semi decent laptop that also runs games okay.
---
its balanced that way cause you can keep your items for next match or even find them in a box killers have there's consumed straight away
---
Chase them one at a time and it will become obvious.
---
so disgusting ... and when you turn around the wall and the huntress trows her fucking hatches and hit you ... cmon fix this hitboxes man !!
---
* **Rule 1** - Uncivil Behavior.
---
* Do not participate in hate speech or bigotry (including racism, sexism and homophobia) or use slurs.
---
even with blocks people sit there and do stuff in ur face like gens and totems. plus late game if someones hooked and u cant move then far enough from the exit its gg and he gets away
---
* Screenshot highlighting a salty chatlog.
---
This^
---
No you get a notification that it‚Äôs thrill of the hunt plus even if your not paying attention the progress bar moves noticeably slower. 
---
It's too bad that Adrenaline wakes you up instantly, and it's a meta perk.
---
Is this how it looks when you‚Äôre playing??
---
I disagree. Id shit bricks of the terminator came around the killer. Why sci fi horror so discriminated against :[
---
It's a 50/50, no? Half the time they're gonna pull you in the wrong direction.
---
Not the same discord server BTW, way less circlejerky.
---
Freddy has tracking, stealth and has a bit of mind games during the dream transition. He also can slow the game because of his dream state which reduces action speed and forces people to wake up by likely failing a skill check, alerting freddy.
---
Spirit only excels in chases. She has no stealth, cant slow the game any, and has no tracking paired with mediocre map control. With addons shes good but at base shes meh.
---
I'm sorry, I never said I NEEDED it, nor did I ever say I use it. I think I've only had it equipped like 3 times. To this day I have never gotten a chance to use it, but seeing the changes ensure that I wont ever use it.
---
(As a killer I play against it and I'm ok with it. I dribble and even if they do use it, it loses me like 5 secs.)
---
You‚Äôre acting like people play nurse because of swf. People play nurse because they really want to win. If the devs for some reason removed swf, nurse players would find something else to complain about and keep using the most overpowered killer in the game. Just sayin
---
But then just turn.
---
The fact he mentioned it was sweaty at all implies doing likewise on the other side of the fence is not.
---
well the thing is ur not always going to find all 4 survivors late game let's be honest plus tons of people run adrenaline these days anyway so even if u had everyone in dream at least 1 or 2 will wake up and both go on different exit gates and at least one exit it bound to open let's be honest. I'm not saying u cant or dont 4k with freddy because I do myself but if u go up against a survivor who's IQ is above 12 then ull understand that he does need a buff.
---
Is it just me or has that never been an issue? In my opinion, the only time I had a problem with controller sensitivity was when I was going against people on keyboard who perfected 360s. They'd need to do it for when keyboard and mouse compatibility  happens maybe, but as it stands its never been am issue against people with controllers since they can't spin as fast mouse can because they're restricted too
---
idk some people get salty at the most random shit
---
killer had 4 devour hope tokens and was chasing someone so i left someone on the hook and let them get struggle while looking for the totem, with every intention of unhooking them before they died obviously.
---
Didn't find the totem, someone got back to them before I did and saved them, person being chased got mori'd. I eventually found the totem and got hooked for it, then that person ran up to my hook and did the same thing to me instead of saving me. Maybe thought I wasn't gonna come back for them at all?
---
It mostly does it when I use SLOBS and discord at the same time 
---
So much soul went into Left 4 Dead.
---

---
W a i t,,,,,
---
yeah, i use him with "windstorm" addons, hes really good, but he can be in C tier for sure :)
---
Happened to me yesterday. The guy was hooked all the way across the map and I saved a David right by the gate and he called me a douchebag for it. Like what was I gonna do 
---
*Screams in Vhs Porn*
---
*Oui oui oui oui*
