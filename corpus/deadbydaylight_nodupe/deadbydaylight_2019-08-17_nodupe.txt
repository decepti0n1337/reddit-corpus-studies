Don't care. Could be screens of another comment. Your opinions are still garbage.
---
---
---
So, like, chasing a survivor till you get him isn't tunneling. 
---
Gotcha! Awesome! Thanks everyone for filling me in on the lingo
---
I thirteenth that
---
No, they bleed while healthy.
---
Doesn't sound very useful
---
I use lithe with dance with me. I’ve lost a lot of killers with this combo during chases.
---
The one who kills for no reason just seems like a wild animal, it almost seems like it doesn't know what it's really doing. The one who tortures people does it to bring misery to others for self pleasure. I don't know about you, but that strikes me as pure evil.

IF YOU HAVE SHITTERNET, DON’T PLAY KILLER.
---
The only good streamer is a small streamer, and they're the ones who mostly have ttv in their names nowadays. Big streamers that use that deserve every Iridescent Head Ebony they get, because it's just greed at that point.
---
ok. 
---

---
hey consider suscribing and thanks for saying im good.
---
well with Ghost Face it makes more sense for it to be a killer just using the persona than it does to have a specific ghost face killer, i think. 
---
It's really unfortunate that it's reboot based because when i think of elm street i don't think preschool, i don't think male survivor, i don't think 2010.
---
Like it isn't how Freddy looks that bothers me because like....i don't see him while i play him it's everything else that's bothersome because it's just a shame that it isn't as true to the series as Michael and Leatherface and Amanda
---
I believe you can't buy Meyers and stuff with shards because licensed killers
---
Wraith is a good one, but I typically recommend Leatherface to new killers. It teaches you to really learn the game since he’s looped pretty hard and earn some sweet BPs with BBQ.
---
We already have cosmetics that drastically change butt size. May as well add one in that makes claudette david's size (except the head ofcourse)
---
A wild animal kills for food, protection, and territory, it knows exactly what it's doing. Freddy kills for pleasure, Michael kills because he's evil. Michael is pure evil.
---
I feel like the Other Mother is more like a distant taxonomic relative of the Entity.

If anything, I think what we have here is perhaps an Entitus Selickus, a distant, less powerful cousin of the Entitus Omnipotus responsible for our beloved trials.

This is quite random but at first I thought you were holding a dirty baguette. That DH read was good though :)
---
He slows down a small bit, ye
---
How do you have 54k subs but can't even break 1000 views on your videos? For comparison usylis has 43k subs and gets like 20-50k views a video.
---
I like the closet idea. But maybe not all closets, just a number of closets she can trap cause the trapper has a limit too. 
---
But I like this idea too.

Having more boxes actually lowers the chance, if you had one box, the chance would be 100%, 2 would be 50%, 4 would be 25% and so on.
---
It’s not true it’s bullshit I didn’t do it. I DID NAT!
---
No, not at all. The devs said they were going to look at how much it and the Blindness add ons were used because so many people called them utter shit.
---
That said, they've never done anything about the countless other Haemmorhage and Blindness add ons despite nobody using them.
---
jesus fuck i can hear the bubba noises
---
Man, this is glorious
---
Just lmao
---
That's what I meant, my bad! I had it typed out but must've deleted it before I posted it.
---
hi, nice to meet ya. 
---
-huntress main.
---
Mortal Kombat was different though, both fatalities were references to the first movie, and he was voiced by Robert Englund, it didn't look like him, but it wasn't necessarily based on the reboot just because it came out a year later.
---
the black and red sweater would've been a thing even if it was classic freddy, just because green &amp; red isn't easy on the eyes
---
What does classic freddy even look like in mkx mobile?
---
I named Billy Loomis because if they got the rights to that version of Ghostface we could've had a survivor like Sydney along with it. But as you said Ghostface can be anyone really so it doesn't matter much either way. 
---
Hopefully we eventually get some version of original Freddy as a cosmetic maybe but atleast the reboot is better than nothing.
---
*look who’s shittin in the tall grass*
---
Low ranks are supposed to learn and get better.... all the low ranks around on trappers stomping days are now the players who kick his ass....
---
I miss these so much
---
Nice

M O N S T R O U S S H R I N E

And max fog

More cringe tik tok
---
Give it to me!
---
Congratulations on surviving as long as you have
---
Just making the game playable for the killer man.
---
Neither side has any evidence for any particular string of games, so neither side is valid
---
You get more salt when playing legion so that’s always fun
---
-_-
---
Who’s askin?
---
oh well i guess that does look a lot more like the original freddy, but if dbd did that i feel like there wouldn't be much of a difference since characters in dbd aren't that expressive and classic freddy's biggest differentiation is his expressiveness. Like honestly I'd rather play as Robert Englund himself as a survivor rather than Robert Englund Freddy, since much wouldn't be different anyways (it's farfetched but he was in call of duty as himself)
---
that being said I'd actually prefer for him to not have a map or survivor come with him to be honest since i hate the preschool and quentin's perks anyways
---
You’re a walking contradiction.
---
whatever it is what it is
---
i'd prefer a the legion body pillow, if they made it
---
eat shit neckbeard
---
Camping is the most annoying thing a killer can do to be honest.  Specially in the basement.
---
I fourteenth that
---
I said theres a delay when you get picked up. never said anything about it not working.
---
the clown one's excellent! that's the kind of funny shit i expect from the fanbase
---
i like shattered mirror and judits tombstone
---

---
Broke: Expecting a killer to respect muh 4%.
---
Woke: Equip Deliverance and yeet off the hook.
---
They don't look different to the killer. It could also just be chasing whoever you find and just getting unlucky
---
I remember using that set up and it was the easiest 4k of my life, got one guy in the basement and all 3 rushed to the basement. It was glorious.
---
Why is everyone forgetting Spirit? She just came home from work one night to find her mother chopped into pieces and then she was killed, too. Her anger and desire for revenge is what turned her into a killer, not anyone she killed. She and the Hag deserved better, if not Hag, Spirit, and Wraith.
---
Very nice, but I got hit with Basement insidious Leatherface and now I have ptsd
---
Wolves by Kanye West
---
Wolves by Kanye west. It's off the life of Pablo album
---
Is she really all that innocent if she scrawls down an evil symbol that turns her into a flesh eating demon?
---
I honesty think that’s how every try hard that plays this game looks like. Like I know that one person that used to play this called Marth looked like this
---
Chad survivors vs. Virgin Killer
---
Who would win
---
I think you are seriously underrating spine chill, bond, and alert.
---
Information is the most powerful thing you can give a skilled survivor.
---
just break chase and hide lol
---
Only when it looks like shit, which happens pretty often.
---
Sorry my bad
---
hope
---
Honestly I'm surprised they picked that because it's kinda like bunny Feng ain't it? It has detachable head that can work with other cosmetics and stuff. I love clown so seeing this makes me happy now we just need bikini clown
---
What about them? Did you have something to add to the conversation or are you just asking random questions.
---
You had to cover their names
---
"Greetings fellow survivors"

---
When you run darkened traps and get Shelter Woods.
---
Trapper only needs to start with all his traps in hand, he's actually a good killer but not so popular. About the stone: if i remember well, it's a 50/50 chance to put the survivor in dying state, unlucky you. Trapper used to place traps in 6 seconds or 8 with certain addons years ago, and his addons were almost all useless.
---
Yep, and it's completely reasonable to be annoyed about cheating, compared to using an item people don't like.
---
Actually each box has has a key for each Reverse bear trap and some box’s may have have 2 keys or zero keys it all depends it there are no percents or rng
---
Depends. If you hit the guy on hook, you'll easy get him down. The other guy will still need another hit, unless you get there early enough to grab him.
---
Do you really need to dignify childish taunts with a response?
---
Adding fuel to the fire solves nothing...
---
I usually just hit the guy when they come off hook, but sometimes get screwed by BT, I just thought perhaps if I hit the guy unhooking then there’s more injured so I have more options.
---
You need to bump up spine chill to S tier my guy it is one of the best perks in game. It counters stealthy killers, tells you if the killer is checking the generator you're on,if the killer is coming back to a hooked survivor and etc.
---
We don't talk about 2010 Freddy.
---
Me. I spat in his bagel.
---
We do feel empathy for her, all we're saying is that Wraiths story feels more relevant and so we are able to feel more sympathetic for him than merely empathetic. We feel more sympathetic for the Wraith. But for the hag we feel empathetic, because we have no idea what it would be like to be a tribal Native villager.
---
&gt; I was killing people without knowing about it, so sad
---
Hags story= I was kidnapped and tortured, then I drew something that turned me into a cannibal demon, so sad :(
---
How relatable is that story? Wraiths story doesn't have anything supernatural and it makes sense. How often do cannibals kidnap and eat people nowadays, and how often do people turn into demons? Compared to Wraiths story, in which you'd be surprised how much criminal gang activity similar to that occurs in some countries.
---
&gt;Yep, and it's completely reasonable to be annoyed about cheating, compared to using an item people don't like.
---
Its not cheating tho and the punishment for that is quite considerable. The downside is hurting the killer's fewwings.
---
He's not overnerfed, he's just never been buffed/reworked to match the pace and gameplay of the game.
---
I mean it's up to your playstyle. Pressure is always a good thing. But you'll have to focus one or the other. If you know one guy has BT then I'd go for the unhooker, that way you can then follow the other one for a few seconds and knock him out later.
---
No please, i can't play with only one hand!
---
LATE POST! WHY DO I HAVE TO CONTINUOUSLY REINVITE MY FRIENDS TO A GAME AFTER EACH MATCH OF SWF?!?!?!
---
It's a confusing system. The "difficulty" really refers more to the complexity of their power. Doctor is "hard" because he has a LOT of different interactions, unique debuffs and weird effects, but anyone can jump on him and know "zap = bad for survivors."
---
I do it as wraith and ghostface. It's also broken if you have that plague perk to give your terror radius to someone else so you have no penalty and it doesn't activate
---
Tired of genrushing? 
---
Just erase half of the survivors lol
---
Hook ya boi up with some royalties and you got a deal :P.
---
The other more practical reason is that it puts more pressure on the team since the person getting unhooked will need to run off and heal. Also the unhooked might have borrowed time so you could be wasting a hit hitting the unhooked survivor.
---
I wanna play as Ernest from Ernest scared stupid.
---
So you're just gonna use gendered slurs against the nurse? It's 2019. Don't be a slut SHAMER!
---
Apologies I don’t catch that in the rules.
---
Cursed loadout? More like best loadout.
---
Spine Chill is overrated in my opinion, IMO. You don't need this perk to counter stealth killers, you only need awareness, Spine Chill is only S tier against Prayyer Beads Spirit, otherwise is a meh perk.
---
Too hot to handle; too cold to hold... digg it
---
I hope they let you keep 3blinks in the rework as long as it comes with huge drawbacks and is a very rare/ultra rare addon
---
YOU IDIOT IF YOU DONT BRING BORROWED TIME AND TRY TO SACRIFICE YOURSELF THE KILLER WILL JUST SLUG AND DOWN THE PERSON YOU SAVED AFTER YOU
---
Disagree, skilled survivors don't need detection perks.
---
*disgusting*
---
I was kinda hoping for just a blank sheet of paper
---
How much do you have to practice to know how to hit gens and windows like that?
---
And now I dont miss it anymore. Lol forgot the bad parts of it
---
Interesting. I thought the pre-hag had pretty typical black features. This drawing actually made me go 'Huh, I guess it would make more sense that she was black when she still had skin.'
---
Is huntress good for basement builds?

Other than all those super powers the killers have that the entity gave them.

I can relate to this. Had to check [past broadcast](https://clips.twitch.tv/ObeseAmericanWatermelonDatBoi) because I knew this happened recently. Took me a while but I found it.
---
Trapper has never been nerfed as far as I know. But he could definitely use some love, for sure.
---
Actually this is an accurate representation of all Plague mains
---
I mean it’s pretty standard
---
On PC, PS4, XBOX?
---
True but the idea of it being called sauce is for another post
---
You deserve to get banned for DCing over and over again, yes, obviously. You are wasting peoples time, and burning their offerings for no reason.
---
Too OP
---
If you wanna Derank just bloodfarm at least you get something out of it
---
No, you didn't. Grow some balls and get better. I did read your post. By deranking you ARE putting yourself against survivors worse than you. Play the game the way it's meant to be played or don't play at all. Oh wait, you can't, because you got a well deserved ban.
---
P3 CLAIDETTES
---
Yes sir lol Just gave up life
---
Squinting looking for that Claudette sitting still after I bumped into her in the tall grass.
---
ps4
---
Some survivors just want to have a chill game too without being hooked three times within the first two minutes. But you know, they live with it and move on because it’s just a game. That’s just me though. (And no, I’m not THAT terrible as a survivor. I do gens and heals when like, you know, I’m not the target of a Killer’s affection.)
---
so i should just play and get stomped on in 90% of my matches? that's fun? that's what BHVR is trying to accomplish with one side of the game? the ranking system is fucking broken
---
Gotta wait till it gets to 10 my dude
---
If it's fake then does that make you real?
---
 Gen rush is real, but its the fault of the developers for having weak killers that can get looped and "gen rushed" 
---
 I just want games where i can have a fun chase without having to rush so fast. If you dont get a down in 80 seconds thats almost a guaranteed 2-3 gens done
---
I don't know what you expected. It's known that you'll be punished for leaving games constantly. You earned your way to a high rank then threw a tantrum when you stopped winning so you tried to go up against lower level people. Your ban is justified. We know the ranking system isn't great, but you getting punished for directly going against the DCing system is completely fair.
---
wow, sounds like the ranking system might be broken... like i said it is. it's crazy hard to depip as killer so i keep ranking up despite getting fucking smashed in 90% of my games at the green ranks and beyond. even when i don't get one kill it just breaks even, no depip
---
I had a managed to kill a Nea once by insidious camping her flashlight. Just downed her every time she came to get it
---
All I'm saying is the prospect of a child being kidnapped and eaten piece by piece while still alive is way sadder to me than Wraith's story, and the supernatural elements or Lisa's background doesn't change that to me.
---
You could just, try harder to remember.
---
That would have been pretty funny I might do that and if I do I will credit the idea too you
---
Dang, my bad
---
She wasn't a child, but I get what you're trying to say.
---
It gives a speed boost and one-shots with entirely different requirements. That first one-shot is also a surprise.   
---
Tinkerer + NOED with multiple survivors chewing up that last gen often means surprise one-shot without the telegraphing chainsaw revving.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Good survivors are extremely difficult to chainsaw, Myers might not be able to stalk enough meter to reach tier 3 in time, etc. 
---
Survivors will bitch no matter what, so you might as well hunt them down and kill them with extreme prejudice.
---
Replace self care with something more useful, esp since you’re running Iron Will.
---
**Chainsaw raging intensifies**
---
Someones sweaty for the 4k
---
Only way to make it a non tunnel perk is make it a non obsession perk that adds more speed penalty for each survivor you hook and you have to hook a different player to gain its effect.
---
I drew these minis 2 days ago and I drew some today I’m gonna start posting these like a series (also I drew some legion it’s hard to detail them though they are small)
---
What about Ash?
---
No setup of a game accounts for such high levels of hostility.  I think it has to do with the community that is drawn to it.  From the streamers I've seen, they tend to be either fat and/or LGBTQ+ and/or very liberal (the self-hate crowd).
---
I think a lot of the people are just trash people who hate themselves and project that hatred outwards.
---
Are you saying being fat or lgbtq+ is toxic..?
---
I really really like DBD but it sucks when people are so fucking mean to me. I wish I knew why. I got this game less than a month ago and ngl it's been a pretty shitty experience so far.
---
try quick and quiet, head on, self care and alert
---
My bad, I always thought she was a child, don't know really know why. Still, child or not, it's the same for me.
---
I ran into one as well and brought a cypress, although he did DC 😂
---
Urban Evasion could get replaced with Spine Chill or alert.
---
Self Care could probably get replaced by bond.
---
Sure fucking am!
---
If you are getting stomped on then you would naturally lose rank...
---
People who are fat and/or LGBTQ+ tend to be more hostile and have more self-hatred than others, yes.
---
Agreed, one of the many ways that SWF is cheating. And yes, I am mad and sweaty. Excuse me for wanting to win sometimes since I'm not very good.
---
I also hate it when I mumble under my breathes
---
These are so charming! Keep it up!
---
Indeed.  I just recently got the game as well and tried to play a few games as nurse and from the post-game chat you'd think I was a piece of shit who is so trash I should kill myself.
---
Anarchy, I agree with you, you just got a little overzealous and missed that he was on our side, lol.
---
So being fat or being LBGTQ is toxic eh? Well i hate to break it to you but it turns out *youre* the issue. Don't get me wrong, this community is a hot mess and i do not defend either side, but what you just said is on a whole other level of stupid and toxic.
---
Eh, I would argue Ghostface is worse than Leatherface. GF is a narcistic serial killer that stalks and kills for the thrill and the glory. LF is a clearly mentally disabled man that kills people who break into his home and does so to protect his (albeit sicko hillbilly) family.
---
Overwatch is way worse.
---
Sacrifice process? I'm confused on that part...
---
And like Anarchy pointed out, using something built in versus abusing something not built in, very different.
---
Isn't the PTB supposed to come out in like a week? If they're not announcing anything here, *the what are they doing?!*
---
Yeah I feel like those would be fine to keep online for kyf.
---
Hide and seek for example.
---
Like, the period of time it takes for the entity to come take the person when they are hooked. They don't just disappear and the hatch opens.
---
I am unloopable
---
I never said it was a statistic, nor did I ever say it was a fact.
---
I asked people for their thoughts as to why the community was utter trash, and gave my own.
---
What don't you understand?
---
Once again, making her miss 9 blinks literally has *nothing* to do with the emblem. I'll ask again: what is your point in saying that?
---
All should be reworked it's just legion is the worst case right now
---
&gt;No. Lets not.
---
Yes, let's actually. Also, so what if it has more search results? You really think every single one of those is even related to DBD and Overwatch?
---
Overwatch gives you the ability to easily talk with other players without the use of a party. This means running into toxicity is wayyy easier. I just think you met some toxic moron and now you think this game is the most toxic one in the world.
---
I understand, and i said that was in and itself a toxic thing to think. Now where here.
---
I love that people are doing this. It's a fine little outfit for everyone's favorite Bush bandit.
---
Imma bet you okay on PS4 don’t you
---
Then why does DBD toxicity constantly return the most results on google (more than games with 5-10x the playerbase) and researching "the most toxic video game" constantly brings up DBD?
---
Id dig a Survivor set after you finish killers too if you're down
---
the way she nods her head when she downs you, what a clown, that's why you don't assume you've won automatically
---
The killer up until then was playing totally normal. It just came out of the blue.
---
Haha the old mythical "U can't use NOED"
---
Wolves such a good song off TLOP
---
Why is it a toxic thing to think?
---
Fat people and LGBTQ+ people have higher rates of self-hatred and suicide than normal people.  It would be a logical conclusion.
---
Why doesn't that train of thought seem logical to you?
---
I pretty regularly get people spazzing out on me for using BBQ, and its like. "Yes, I'm so sorry that I'm using the bp farming perk, while I'm farming bp"
---
SURPRISE BITCH
---
I mean it's not like kyf is a perfectly stable and optimized mode, we could at least check things out in there.
---
You said overwatch was more toxic than DBD.
---
All the information available via google contradicts that.  I've provided said information already.
---
DBD is indexed as the most toxic video game in existence (as of 08/16/2019)
---
Why is my rationale stupid?
---
And why is it offensive to some?
---
I go into a game to do a daily, and for killers it’s usually just ‘use the power’. Not hard to remember
---
Yeah, I sorta know that she's the best already.  So, her blink ability (which is her entire jam) can only be done twice in the entire game?  (Without addons)
---
Not when youre trying to understand why a group of over 100000 people are the same. 
---
Like you have to be trolling at this point dude.
---
Yeah I’m gonna need you to move spine chill up, and self care down homie
---
I APOLOGIZE IF I'VE KILLED YOU WHEN YOU COULD'VE ESCAPED A MINUTE AGO, BUT IF YOU'RE STILL SCREWING AROUND INJURED IN THE EXIT GATE AND I CAN PICK YOU UP, DON'T SAY IT'S MY FAULT WHEN I HOOK AND KILL YOU
---
Now THATS what I call a good totem placement!
---
Monto would be proud
---
Maybe in theory good survivors should run those perk, in actuality most good survivors (good at chases) will usually use Exhaustion Perk (most of the time DH) + DS + BT. 
---
Also, the idea that good survivors somehow don't need help in chases is flawed. Unless you're abusing a very broken set up/structure, good killers will find openings and down you/hit you, so exhaustion perks are still extremely useful. And being good doesn't stop you from getting tunneled, so DS can be amazing still.
---
Spine Chill is probably the most overrated perk in the game rn survivor or killer. It's incredible how high people rank it over a staple like DH which when correctly used (to gain distance in a chase to make a pallet/ vault) has the potential to extend a chase for like a minute or more. It's certainly a solid overall perk that needed more attention, but it's not this S tier, game changing perk people make it to be.
---
If it's so easy to clap trappers, howre you red ranks and supposedly receiving compliments on your play?
---
No, you're suggesting we make one of the most cancerous killers absurdly over-statted so they can still be less viable than nurse. Your changes literally dont do anything to solve trappers problems. Ok cool, you cant disarm traps as easily. That doesnt solve his midchase problems that are the real back breaker. And you dont solve his mobility issues with gen pressure. Your changes dont help him overall as a killer, they just increase the cancer and increase his strengths but dont help his weaknesses. Even if, somehow you got the balance team to smoke what youre smoking right now and they implemented this, trapper would be B tier at best because hes an m1 killer who has no mobility.
---
From the replies it sounds like your timing is just off
---
what info does it provide, really? You realize not every single search result is ACTUALLY related to DBD, right? And google doesn't pick everything up. There's no counting how many rants there are about this stuff on Steam, Tumblr, Discord, etc. "toxic DBD has more results" doesn't really prove anything. 
---
Anyhoo, it's just an opinion, so like I said earlier: Let's just agree to massively disagree.
---
Well the reason for the hostility is mainly because survivors keeping getting new killers nerfed and killers keeping wanting survive with friends gone which creates alot of hostility plus each side have ways to play like asses and I'm hoping this year(year of improving the game) makes a more balance between them then hostility
---
for real, it's so goddamn awful. The only reason I play at all is for them sick golden guns
---
Nah I had one between two giant bushes in a dark ass corner and there was a tree blocking so it was a small ass passage
---
but I'd like to play as a lot of different killers
---
Michael myers , spirit or pig
---
Lissssssssaaaaa!!!!
---
The nurse can blink as much as she wants throughout the match (there's no cool down) but she can only blink twice in one "chain". There are certain add ons that increase the amount of blinks the nurse can have.
---
No Patricia “Your Tone”
---
Yeah! Everythin is unlocked, would be nice to check out the different lighting.
---
The first one is fairly redundant, if they’re healing or cleansing that close you’re going to hear it
---
It was beautiful
---
Lol I didn’t have much of a problem with KOS, but FUCK LUDWIG lol took me forever to kill him,
---
Out get.
---
Imagine 4 survivors with that perk. Now imagine them with that perk plus desicive strike. Hell no, that perk would easily be S/A tier. 
---
You would wiggle free 80% of the time after the second pick up, no doubt.
---
There needs to be some drawback, maybe reset the wiggle timer or give the survivor a maximum 25% head start on wiggle on 2nd pick up. Also make it once per game. Still op as fuck
---
The plan is to do all of em!
---
I saw a dev saying that in that situation it’s the only reasonable play. It’s either guarantee a kill/hit on rescuer, or totally give up
---
What if when you look at him, you get a new form of blindness that creates a shroud of darkness around you so you can only see like 10 feet away in all directions?
---
But Ghostface is the only one who seems relatively happy to be there. I mean yes Clown and Myers aren’t evident of tortured or anything but GF is very expressive in his body movements and seems pleased to be around.
---
do spirit next!
---
Forgot about that cut scene lol
---
Technically GF would be the most “messed up” as in psychotic/willing to kill, Michael too. The entity loves him to much that it gave him those straps. Also the more deformed the killer is, usually means they rejected killing and were tortured by the entity.
---
You need to consider the other three people whos time your wasting.
---
40% of this image is the Devour Hope icon so this is probably fake.
---
Imagine losing miserably your first game ever to unfair matchmaking and then seeing 
---
"You smell"
---
"Hex: fuck you"
---
First week after every rank reset pretty much for me.
---
You can try but if the door is open then you may run out of time. Also feel free to report them to your network of choice if they were too nasty.
---
If the killer 1.is camping, 2. Has more 3. They didn't do shit for generators then no you aren't obligated to save also it was his fault for expecting to be rescued by someone he saved. Never expect stuff back
---
Wasn't the original name for the Trapper Chuckles?
---
You're not "obligated" to do anything in this game.
---
I wish they would add Evil Ash as a killer, it would be really cool and interesting. I wouldnt mind having another chainsaw killer. Although, he could have a "boomstick" that only gets two shots per match unless a dull totem is destroyed adding another bullet he can reload. Perks can include "Man Mettler": after hitting survivors 3 times, adds exposed effect to obsession or just the next survivor you chase, only activates once per match. "Unbuckle": Allows killer to see downed survivors on map and/or how much they've healed themselves based on aura. "Flop-flip": Every time a survivor wiggles free it reaveals their aura to the killer the next time they work on a gen. 
---
Thus was just a fun thing I've been thinking about. I literally downloaded this game for Ash William's to see what it was about and then stayed because I absolutely adore it.
---
I’ve got a perfect video for this on my page
---
Whose*, not who's. Learn English.
---
Why is there a slightly different version of this meme posted every day
---
&gt;It's like how the Entity gave Adiris the ability to cleanse people of the plague that she desperately tried to cure for so long.
---
Source? This seems extremely un-Entity-like. The only times it ever tips the scales seems to be to cause suffering and/or push a prospective killer over the edge (seen in both Rin's father and Rin herself in the Spirit's backstory).
---
Yeah rarely anybody ever brings keys, and it wasn’t even mine to begin with, but kudos to the man who brought it
---
Do you have a source to that claim?
---
I mean i like both and have fun with both, needless to say they are still very much cancer in their own right but also so very fun and addicting.
---
10 hags all appear at once and stare at you. Menacingly. One hag in the distance, watching, laughing her ass off
---
“What are you talking about a lower win rate on console?” That’s the very first line of your original comment, either you worded it poorly, or English isn’t your first language, because saying it like that implies that a noticeably lower win rate doesn’t exist in the first place, which it does
---
Oh yeah appearance wise he’s probably the most normal one, meaning he’s the one of the most fucked and sadistic killers. His pleasure in killing is to much that the entity loves him
---
Look up a video called Banned cheaters crying those cheaters at overwatch are the definition of entitled
---
In my defense, I was going to let everyone go, but the David killed himself on hook and the Claudette wouldn't leave and instead was pointing at the hook.
---
&gt;She could go no further. Delirious, she thought of home; she thought of the elders. With her dying breath, she etched the symbols they had taught her into the floor using what remained of her fingers. Almost in response, a dark hunger stirred inside her. It yearned for blood. In oath, she chose vengeance.
---
A running theme with the Entity which I love is how suffering at the hands of other human beings (sometimes driven by the entity, sometimes not) can drive a person to extreme lengths to seek revenge on their killer/torturer, even condemning themselves to horrific fates just so they can get that revenge. The two most prominent examples, Rin and Lisa, are also two of the most innocent characters from what we know about their backstories.
---
It's been some time since the games release the toxicity has likely gone down a bit since then

But he's not a functioning member of society... He's a serial killer. He goes town to town, swindles his way into jobs and kills people. He only pretends to be normal. It's like saying Ted Bunty was normal because he was charismatic.
---
If we're going based on functional members of society standards, Wraith literally was just a dude working his 9 to 5. He snapped and killed one person who arguably deserved it.
---
They should honestly just add shirtless Myers for the meme and be done with it but make it like 50 dollars to punish the people who ask.

This comment made me laugh more than i should of
---
Lemi see that lol
---
Lmao rippp
---
What.The.Actual.Fuck
---
Seriously why did he dc just because they were downed they screwed ovwr their tm
---
NO DONT CURSE US WHITH THAT SALT FILLED CUT
---
I get enough messages on games telling me to KMS
---
So nah, im good thanks
---
Only cos it initially sounded like he was referring to overcoming a DC into hatch, more than overcoming getting slugged.
---
Lol it’s cool, 1 of my favorite things about that movie was every time my friends and I got high and watched it. we noticed something we never noticed before. Either that or we were so high we completely forgot our it. We first watched the movie in high school, around 2000-2001. And we still quote the movie all the time lol
---
Banshee is the original Wraith's name back in the alpha version.
---
I would say the plague is the least messed up as there isn't really anything wrong with her besides her sickness. The most would be either the clown or the hag for obvious reasons imo
---
Weird, it usually occurs when the killers ping is bad. Which is pretty common now adays
---
omg yes
---
They could just not read the text or listen to the voice messages.
---
" I got 7 traps that game, not one dying state "
---
Then no one free'd themselves, duh
---
I am working on trapper next then I will try to tackle spirit
---
Sadly I've come to the same conclusion. And there's only one way forward. Get your ass beat repeatedly until your good enough to play an underpowered killer and do well.
---
No no, I went into the game just trying to farm BP, hence Legion.
---
Hook everyone twice, get max Hunting, Deviousness, and Brutality scores, then just let everyone escape. It allows me to farm while also letting people know I'm not playing seriously (Since I'll hook someone twice then just drop them off at the hook so they can be picked up)
---
Hillbilly's addon Grisly Chains has a repair debuff of 9% iirc for 90 seconds, i think the reason the addon is never used is due to 1. the minuscule debuff percentage, and 2. the fact it ends after 90 seconds when if you were chainsawed to the ground, you'll likely be unable to do a gen for at least like 30-40 of those seconds, considering the cooldown of the chainsaw hit, pick up animation, walking to a hook, etc. 
---
as i say, im not a game developer, but imo, having it be a cooldown status would make it a bit weak. Though if something like this was added to the game, i'd trust whatever call the devs decided to choose, be it cooldown or constant. Either would be nice if balanced accordingly lol
---
Lol
---
And the eye part of Dark sense, deja vu, Kindred, OoO
---
Thoroughly enjoyed it
---
This use to happen to me alot on xbox. I was able to control it at one point. If I loaded dbd and waited until it forced me to sign into an account it would load this way. Relaunch and boom rank reset on command. Then I got error code 302 and BHVR reimbursed me 27 mil bp with all characters reset. I lost a david donkey jacket but I dont have this issue anymore. Took forever to spend 27 mil bp.
---
If I dive a hook at end game (meaning killer is still around or camping) I do it fully aware that I’m trading my life to get you out. 
---
If I did that for someone and they stuck around and ended up dying anyway I’d be pissed. 
---
You played it right.
---
The hiccup seems to be a connection issue at the wrong time.
---
Looks completely different than what it is now
---
New killer: The onion
---
Banshee is Wraith's original name in the alpha version of the game.
---
If we’re talking physically, Myers is the least since he’s a swoll-ass boi. Meanwhile, Hag is the most since she’s missing a large majority of her flesh and maybe even her eyes.
---
Mentally, Ghostface is least since he’s able to mask his killer instincts and function as a normal member of society, and Doctor/Nurse are the worst since they are actually insane.
---
also Hillbilly who killed his jailor parents with a chainsaw
---
Blendettes
---
I posted a video of this same thing keeps happening to me
---
He really isn't that sadistic compared to the likes of the clown and doctor
---
Agreed, and legion is a pretty low-tier killer, not the worst imo but down there, so it'd be very useful for him to halt gen progress (just a little bit)
---
You got some skills
---
Get really good at either Spirit, Hillbilly, Nurse or good at surviving matches quickly as survivor and play a lot.
---
My suggestion is the following
---
Start with 10 or 5 traps that he starts with
---
Let him rearm traps at a range that can be increase with add ons
---
Give him the ability to walk through a pallet to break it without breaking it normally aa he doesn't have much chase power if he can't get his traps going quickly enough this would of course have a cool down time
---
What if you play more then 1 match. 30×4 matches(10 minute match)= 2 hours of wait time.
---
I doubt it...
---
Nerf pallets
---
I've been a rank 1 killer for a very long time and I gotta say this is the dumbest post I've read in a while. how could you dc multiple games so that you can play against worse players and not expect to get banned? seriously. deranking is the shittiest thing you can do in this game. if you are at a point where you aren't depipping, it doesn't matter if you're getting swf. the new rank system made it crazy hard for killers to rank up, and even safety, so the fact that you're struggling to derank against teams that are "destroying" you is not even a little believeable
---
That Freddy rework is looking really good.
---
I know, right? Lol I’m not opposed to it being a cool down but it’d just kinda make it a gimmick effect, though perhaps it could be a cool down with some things and a constant with others? Mangled is constant with sloppy butcher but a lot of killer addons cause mangled on a cool down so I guess maybe both is the path for this effect if it were added
---
I wish this was hq enough to see whats in his hand
---
He literally takes pictures with his dead victims doing silly poses, he loves killing
---
Makes sense lore wise considering they are 4 people and are called the legion it would be interesting but yeah it would be a bit op aganst non swf especially if the legion team all are perfectly coordinated and are all running specific perk and ad on builds to help them down survivors.
---
1st member uses detection perks like BBQ and nurses calling
---
2nd member uses totem perks like Ruin and devour hope 
---
3rd member uses chasing perks like brutal strength
---
4th member uses Perks like noed and make your choice.
---
For make your choice the player using it just has to stay away from the hook while their teammates stay nearby ready to instant down survivors.
---
I mean. If they weren't t-bagging and that whole deal and it's the end of the game, I might let them go, but if they were being just the worst, of course I'm not respecting it
---
This just makes me want a Hollow Knight cosmetic for Wraith
---
As a console player, how do you expect people to communicate fast enough to not wait 2 minutes every message? There's the Xbox app, but so few people actually use its feature to type.
---
Most messed up def doctor he just tortures people for no reason and least messed up is hag poor hag got eaten by canibals
---
That’s happened to me a couple times too. A strange thing to be jumpscared as the killer.
---
It's a bit far fetched but I'm not gunna bash you for it
---
Real Mori Hours
---
This actually keeps happening to me a lot with fresh killers recently. I’m not sure why.
---
I can't wrap my head around someone claiming a sociopathic serial killer is a functioning member of society but someone that never willingly hurt a soul before having a temporary mental breakdown after a traumatic discovery is not.
---
Yeah definetly! It really does depend. My biggest thing is sometimes when I'm playing survivor my teammates are the reason I die and idk it can get frustating although its not too often.
---
Considering the only other thing trapper has to help him in a Chase are his slow traps it's wouldn't be game breaking
---
They all learn the hard way. "Lol i think Michael is afk he's just staring at me." Next thing you know everyone is downed in a 30 second window.
---
Its a nerfed smoothie.
---
Just here to enjoy the discord bro. No need for the toxicity. Take it to another forum.
---
I wish I could hug him
---
This happened to me too! Legit the same exact thing. I made a post about it. I got bumped down twice however within a 3 hour span (an hour break in between.) it was awful.

Are you also on Xbox?

If you wanna try and cut off chases bamboozle will be a good help, that’s all I know as a filthy survivor main
---
No but it would be whack to make... my ideas are things that don't require new animations just some minor coding and behind the scenes witchery giving tapper a significant buff
---
&gt;1k bloodpoints isn't worth additional time for a killer to get downs and snowball for a perk that they might not even have.
---
I'm 100% certain that a guaranteed 1k bloodpoints is more than the average bloodpoints you save from the killer maybe taking some of your points away with an additional half a minute of time.
---
There is nothing you can do as a survivor that results in more bp than safely cleansing a totem when you can.
---
That is true but that's why we must keep bitching.
---
Buff slim jim and too hot and this could be a half-decent set of perks
---
I JUST GOT FUCKING ACCUSED OF TUNNELING FOR SETTING TRAPS NEAR HOOKS WHILE THE OTHER SURVIVOR UNHOOKS THEM, SO I HAPPEN TO BE NEARBY. OF COURSE IM GOING TO BE CLOSE I AM A GOD DAMN TRAPPER I NEED TO TRAP THE HOOK TO CATCH MY PREY YOU IDIOTS. I LITERTALLY BENEFIT BY BEING NEAR A HOOK BECAUSE I HAVE TRAPS THERE FOR A REASON. YOU GOTTA WAIT BEFORE UNHOOKING ON A TRAPPER.
---
The anti-teabag perk.

The ultimate fuck you to a toxic cunt at every pallet in the game.

You are getting downvoted but it's true. Plus the people who make cosmetics aren't even the same people who fix bugs. Two different areas of development

NO FUCK LEGION HES OVERPOWERED AND I HATE HIM. HE CAN OUTRUN ALMOST ANYTIME IN A CHASE AND IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DODGE AS SURVIVOR. YOU'RE JUST BAD, I KNOW THAT SOUNDS MEAN BUT IN THIS CASE ITS KIND OF TRUE.

He went from “Fuck the killers are so broken and op fuck this game” to “Can we play another? Can we play tomorrow?” It’s wholesomeish trying to explain shit to him has been hilarious the killer brought a Mori and he’s like “He can only do that once right?” Lmfaooooo this dude in for a wild ride.
---
Lmao fuck I play both. How long do I got to live?
---
;)
---
What’s SFW
---
Survive with friends. Basically premade survivor groups going into game with eachother.
---
I always thought if they added Evil Ash his weapons would be the Kandarian Dagger and The Necronomican
---
I only play survivor but the rulebook makes me laugh everytime. “Killer’s can’t have noed because then survivors can’t genrush” etc.
---
I hate it when people go for chest rather then the main priority at hand. A ruin totem or completing a slow gen is main priority. Instead they go searching for basic treasure. Rather then being objective based. 
---
I stopped looting chests, and started looting dead players belongings. They have some neat stuff with add ons. Not that I make it a priority. If I come across it, don't mind if I do...
---
Sounds like fun, but that would require quite a lot of work from the devs. I was just thinking about simple changes lol.
---
SCP-████ has breached containment. MTF Unit Gamma-██ has been dispatched to recontain the subject, amnesticize any witnesses, and confiscate, discredit, and destroy any media related to the breach.
---
Oh okay
---
As a Michael main, he is definitely too much fun, especially with all the meme builds
---
“I think we’ve done a pretty good job so far”
---
The main problem at the core of this is that SWF can abuse it, but really, anybody can. Think about it. There are two people left. One is down, or even maybe hiding. The other finds the hatch, so they tell their friend to DC so that they can escape. Then you're robbed of more than a few points.
---
Isn't he a survivor?
---
If you're a killer, it's more of a pVp arena. If you're a survivor. It's a survival game of the fittest.
---
This is a survival co OP game for the survivor. It's just different then most survival games, where you can't really fight back, and you're a lot weaker then most survival games.
---
Not necessarily weaker, but in most cases you should be weaker, or what's the point of playing easy mode survival games.
---
No... changes need to be Major...You gotta think Bigger.
---
In all seriousness I don't think it would be that unfair considering swf groups can pull the same with their flash light squads so it's only fair for the killer side to be able to achieve the same feat
---
The trick is to throw all pallets down at the start of the game, and then you know 100% that they are all fake.
---
That would be so much cooler. Thank you.
---
Both and neither.
---
Survivor - I have to trust 3 other complete strangers that they can do the objectives (do they know what a gen is? can they hit skillchecks? will they unhook me? safely? will they farm/sandbag me? will they selfcare in front of me and not let me heal them? **will they DC?**) Will this even be fun at all?
---
Killer - Are these people toxic? Will they bully me? Are they rank 16-20's with thousands of hours in the game? because I've only been playing 3 months... **Will they DC?** Will they report me for false accusations of lagswitching, etc? Will this even be fun at all?

Wear dark clothes to avoid being targetted. You'll slowly learn to run long chases. That doesn't mean, you'll never get chased. 
---
Plus the fact that too many flashy players hook bomb me all the time, and the fact that people barely work on gens following the killer around. 
---
You can do a lot more with dark clothes. That doesn't necessarily mean, you'll never be in chases. In dire moments, you'll need a cammoflouge advantage at any given time. 
---
If you do decide to go stealth- don't waste time running perks that waste time. Some examples of wasting time perks are (Self care, sprint burst, and urban invasion) not that they're bad, but a lot of people waste so much time with these perks being stealthy/unproductive.
---
While stealth often gets bashed, as long as you're being productive, it shouldn't be a problem. Just remember that every second counts.
---
Do you need to be healing yourself, or do you need to be finishing that gen while your teamates are buying time for you to get things done. 
---
Do you need to walk, or do you need to run to the other side of the map to find that gen. 
---
Do you need to hide? Or do you need to take risks in order to complete the mission. 
---
Don't abuse your stealth. In dire moments it'll serve you right. Your less bound to get face camped/tunneled. Chances for that being you don't stick out, so you shouldn't be spotted first.
---
Don't be afraid to be injured , remain productive. 
---
Bond or empathy will tell you where the killer may be. Empathy tells me exactly whose buying me time, and what my role should be in dire moments. It tells me exactly where the killer is, since I can detect strange patterns in players vaulting windows, and dropping pallets. Or when they're looping from across the map.

I mean I feel bad for her, but she didnt get eaten alive by cannibals and turn to the entity just so she could destroy the people who tortured her.

Instant sacrifice when the survivor enter the basement, injured or not
---
Yeah but she was chopped up by the person who raised her... Anyways yeah but I didn't think Lisa got eaten? I thought she just wasn't fed for so long she became like, a skeleton
---
-cleanse one or two totems before working on a gen 
---
-whenever you pass a dull, cleanse it
---
-if you find a hex cleanse it just in case
---
-do gens
---
-only go for chests if you have a chest loadout
---
anything else you probably shouldn't do
---
Nea - Pastel Bob Wig Matsuri, stylized varg and lightweight pants. This makes an awesome looking outfit.
---
Too balanced. Macho Man would just pal up with Ash and tag team the Entity.
---
How many thumbnails did you have to look at to find this title?
---
I missed it, I started playing after they were basically destroyed. I would just like to play one game in pitch black.
---
If it's placed BEFORE the last gen, you can't escape with it on. If it's placed AFTER the last gen,you die with it on
---
This is a high quality post.
---
&gt;So after the end game patch, someone told me that the pigs traps can now go thorough the gate? I thought you couldn't go thorough the gate with it on?
---
After you trapped someone, a gen must be completed in order to activate the RBT. If all gens are done, trapping someone won't activate the trap and that person can go through the exit gate.
---
Survivor because more action, more adrenaline.
---
Every damn time, but I’m addicted to this game. I can’t stop playing even though I know it’ll piss me off
---
Unsafe unhook - the most common cause of what survivors call "tunneling", as they expect killers to play by their rules, which state that the killer must chase the healthy survivor, rather than down the logical target. This also causes the secondary effect,  "slugging" because of DS. While the ultimate cause is poor choices by survivors, the killer is blamed for this rather than survivors taking responsibility for their decision to unhook while the killer happens to be close, rather than playing better and drawing the killer away from the hooked target.
---
If you do get spotted. You need to buy as much time for the team. It may be necessary to lose the killer, but when that happens go immediately back to a gen. 
---
Buy as much time as possible. With a stealth build, you may be at a disadvantage for looping, but if you can find pallets, and lose the killer. You'll waste enough of his time while he searches for you. Learning to loop is sometimes enough to buying time without relying on perks like exhaustion perks. 
---
Along the way, you'll progress, and may even ditch the stealth approach altogether. Wearing flashy clothes, you should be the last 1 saving people. Unless it's  necessary or you have borrowed time. A lot of times the flashy players just hook bomb me, with their most obvious rescues.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/crheqz/so_after_the_end_game_patch/

Possibly, but in those circumstances idk that anyone could be of sound mind, definitely not clear headed ebough to make a decision like embracing slavery to an Eldritch monstrosity.
---
Thank you!
---
If the trap isn't active, then it wont kill them if they try to leave. If it is, it will kill them. They made this change because of the EGC.
---
Gee man, between the game costing 20 bucks, plus 8 dollars a DLC, with over 10 DLC's, over 3 years of the game existing, I wonder if they have the money or the staff to handle fixing basic issues like match making or dedicated servers. Yes, *one* of those things is supposedly on the way, *after 3 years* so I guess we shouldn't complain right?
---
Like, I get your stance on the issue when a game is new, or free2play, but this is game is neither of those things. The margin for excuses is over and done with for them. Add to that, the fact that the issues we complain about are long standing issues from very early in the game's lifespan, then people are bound to get fed up.
---
And just because things cost money and people want devs to improve their game doesn't meam those people are children. More often than not, asking for a solution comes from people with any semblance of maturity as opposed to kids, who just whine that the game is broken. Don't try to be a gatekeeper about cash.
---
I've been playing the game for a couple years. I've got probably 1200+ hours and I still ask myself if I'm finna get bullied

---
why are you gentapping
---
Generators is always priority. Ruin is more second priority, but it's still a priority. All 4 survivors shouldn't be looking for ruin. Cleansing dull totems is alternative objective, only if you're gen rushing should you waste time on them. If no generators have been done, you're wasting time, because in order for noed to activate you must finish gens. 
---
If you can't finish gens or rush them, you wasted time on cleansing dull totems. Once enough generators have been done. You should start on the alternative objective (totems) since theirs a chance noed may proc. I wouldn't gamble noed for every game just to not even come close to powering all 5 generators.
---
I hate when my teamates are focused on the alternative objective, rather then main objective at the beginning of the game, when there's a gen in front of them, and half times we never get to the end game (exits being powered) with several gens to go. 
---
ESpecially when we don't have time for them. As in everyone is getting killed plus constantly self healing every second, while 3-5 gens remain.
---
Even if noed procs. A team wipe is possible, but noed doesn't guarantee that. It may even proc, the killer may still get 0 kills from it, if the team outlays the killer. Maybe 1 if the killer gets lucky, but for all 4 to go down... that's a team problem, not an OP perk.
---
What about plastic bag :(
---
Lol thank you. I can’t believe someone could make that comparison and not realize how fucked up it is.
---
10/10 cosplay
---
Yeah I can't imagine being new to the game these days and deciding to be a killer main. It has to be completely insane and I wouldn't blame anyone if they stopped after few games of getting bullied, insulted meanwhile still not knowing game mechanics and learning.
---
As a Dwight main, I am a locker
---
GOD I HATE SPIRIT. 
---
IF YOU PLAY SPIRIT FUCK YOU.
---
ALSO IF YOU RUN RUIN FUCK YOU THAT SHIT IS STUPID
---
Your stain...
---
Thanks
---
But tea though... I love Samination hahah I'm glad he makes an impact with his parodies
---
Depends. If you're in a SWF, OoO. If you're solo queuing, Spine Chill.
---
Yea too many pigs were doing that when pig is meant to waste survivors time during the game
---
&gt;More often than not, asking for a solution comes from people with any semblance of maturity as opposed to kids, who just whine that the game is broken. Don't try to be a gatekeeper about cash.
---
Except just whining about stuff that is supposedly broken is all this community does, even when the people complaining don't understand the bare minimum technical aspect of said issue (matchmaking and "broken hitboxes" are two huge examples). 
---
&gt;Gee man, between the game costing 20 bucks, plus 8 dollars a DLC, with over 10 DLC's, over 3 years of the game existing, I wonder if they have the money or the staff to handle fixing basic issues like match making or dedicated servers. Yes, one of those things is supposedly on the way, after 3 years so I guess we shouldn't complain right?
---
I don't know about you but, I haven't met anyone that paid full price for DBD in the past 2 years and a lot of my friends started playing recently, none of them paid full price. DBD goes on sale for 50% at least 4 times a year and the same goes for its DLCs. Out of the 10 DLCs you mentioned, 6 of them can be obtained for free and the other 4 probably have to share the income with the license owner. 
---
&gt;Like, I get your stance on the issue when a game is new, or free2play, but this is game is neither of those things. The margin for excuses is over and done with for them. Add to that, the fact that the issues we complain about are long standing issues from very early in the game's lifespan, then people are bound to get fed up.
---
I understand about the complaints being from the very early existence of DBD but you gotta remember at some point Behavior wasn't the complete owner of the game. Between getting the rights to the game, expanding their team and branching out to other platforms a lot of time and resources (money included) have been used. There will always be the one issue that they haven't addressed yet that will cause X or Y person to be mad but if you look at the entire picture, I don't know about you but BHVR is doing an incredible job.
---
I don't have the specifics but I am willing to bet with the amount of growth DBD had in the past 2 years alone, selling base game + DLCs (that not everyone buys because they dont care about certain characters), they need the income provided by skins.
---
Sometimes OoO can be extremely helpful even in Solo Ques because you can bait the Killer into chasing you which is especially helpful if you're experienced with taking the aggro allowing your team to "hopefully" complete the gens but I respect your opinion.
---
By playing the game
---
We are always glad to have new players :) the best way to get iridescent shards is to just play the game. It’s a pretty grindy system, but you’ll have plenty in a week or so of consistent playtime
---
Everytime you level up you get them, the amount you get increases per certain levels. I'm currenly level 50+ and getting 300 Everytime I level up, I think from 40+ is 270. It basically gradually increases making it easier
---
You get them every time you level up. The higher level you are, the more you get each time.
---
Honestly the map would be so much better if they took out half the windows and made it twice as dark.
---
I seventeenth that
---
     I, being a person that has played a ton of Evolve when it first came out, found that the lack of a concrete objective like the "complete the generators" objective on dbd made the flow of the game feel kind of pointless after awhile, how you would start and it just turns into a chicken chase with isolated battles that eventually ultimately turned out pretty much the same. Any tension (for me) just kind of vanished because of the lack of objectives mostly. Just kill the monster. Even the different modes were bland in comparison to DBD Like Nest, Rescue, defend, and arena. I think DBD is lasting longer because of the addictive loop of play and objectives. Even playing as the monster just felt more like, you have to keep running and running. You can't do much setup outside of eating and try to evolve and if you get caught in a tracker's dome at stage 1 then you might as well kiss that match goodbye because a good team of hunters will demolish you.
---
     Each match of DBD has several things to do, cleanse totems, do gens, escape the killer, find the hatch if need be, and rescue other survivors from the hook. I also like the amount of perks and how finishing a match feels meaningful, win or not, because you get bloodpoints. Evolve didn't have such a feature if I'm not mistaken. Don't get me wrong, I love Evolve and always will. Like I still play it against AI every now and again. I will always stand by the opinion that they have some of the most unique monsters. This is all purely opinion and I very well may be wrong, but that is what I've gathered from it all.
---
Ok I’ll just grind like gta lol if I gotta
---
No it shouldn’t have hit. Op was well away from the window, and got rubber banded back to the window.
---
Baby Dwight’s cries for mommy&gt;Jane’s thicc ass
---
They’re meant to do different things imo. Object is if you want to be chased, Spine Chill if you want to avoid the killer.
---
Why aren't all of Ace's perks in unranked? He's the worst survivor isnt he?!
---
FREDDY CAN GO FUCK HIMSELF. 10 GAMES TONIGHT, 6 FREDDYS. ITS BEEN UTTER FUCKING BULLSHIT. I HATE PLAYING AGAINST HIM. HIS BULLSHIT CAN NOW HIT YOU WHILE AWAKE. GO FUCK YOURSELF. SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HIT YOU UNLESS YOUR ASLEEP, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HE HAS A TIMER TO PUT YOU TO SLEEP. HIS HIT WHILE AWAKE SHOULD DO 0 DAMAGE, BUT INSTANTLY PUT YOU TO SLEEP.
---
You can actually pinpoint the second his heart rips in half.
---
Survive with friends.
---
The difference is not all Dwight's skins are related to pizza and not  all of Ace's skins are related to gambling or  whatever he is
---
Ah okay thank you!
---
Honestly Trapper without his mask kind of looks like kravchenko from the Black Ops games. Wish they didn't show his face
---
We get it. "HAHAHA PEOPLE DCD HAHA BAD MATCHMAKING"
---
Execute order 69
---
I think trapper, like other killers, should start with all of his traps, so he don't had to run around the map and collect his traps. Doctor just needs a bit longer default shock lenght, it's pathetic now and one of the add one you use have to be longer shock lenght.
---
Calm down man it’s just a shitpost
---
Ghost face!
---
Gamesphere dbd port when?
---
survivor because they feel so much stronger than killer, like i feel like i have such a huge advantage as survivor, so many pallets and so many perks i can't really do anything about like decisive strike or dead hard or any exhaustion perk that makes it so survivors can run halfway across the map, meanwhile playing survivor all i have to worry about is can the killer see me and can i be one shot by the killer....if i can't be one shot by a killer, or they're nurse, chances are i will be able to run them around for at least 2 or 3 gens (given that my team actually does gens) because so much seems to be going in my favor. plus with survivor i can play with friends and still get bloodpoints for it
---
Most will say killer. Although. I do both. Mainly survivor. Grinding can be a bit boring. I would suggest having fun. Kill 2 birds with 1 stone. 
---
Just play more. The more skilled you become, will help you grind better while also improving, and having fun. 
---
I grind solo survivor, and I don't really think of it as grinding.
---
Unless you enjoy endless grinding killer+ Bbq and chili perk is what most people run.
---
is this a joke or a thing that people actually do?
---
I got so scared when I first played against a michael becuz I was doing a gen (I didnt know to look around me at the time) and I turn the camera to see him staring at me. I freaked.the fuck out and got out of there, and it was a few days later when my friends explained his power to me
---
With pleasure
---
His terror radius should be the banging you hear in slender games
---
SAME! I thought she'd be something different than something sporty
---
Killer: I activate my trap card, BLOOD WARDEN!!!
---
Improving, and having fun while still grinding is the fun way of grinding. That way u don't get burnt out. Grinding alone will burn you out. Unless you really enjoy it.
---
RIP
---
There is nothing wrong with this photo. This is just pure DBD experience
---
Alright will do
---
For me it's survivor. I like getting chased, going back for that save when the gates are open, etc. I want to be the one wasting the killer's time, or popping the last gen, or the one who prevents NoED from proc'ing. I like the excitement of not knowing if I am going to live or die.
---
[Correct](https://youtu.be/M26wmKY-e3I)
---
That Ash was looking at dat fine booty Ghostface had.
---
The skull in nurses calling is supposed to have a cross on it, other than that really good.
---
Yea I see the problem. That one survivor that didn't run DS screwed his own teammates. No wonder why they DC.

I stopped posting bout 5-6 ago. My channel used to be a hustling minecraft channel haha

You only get a bloody cosmetic and you reset your perk pool. If you got terrible perks already, you are more likely to get the good ones now.
---
I personally don’t prestige (I have one P3 for the achievement) because I just want all the perks and it doesn’t look as rewarding to me
---
You can do whatever you want tho
---
I have thought this before. It would be awesome
---
DO NOT MAKE THE CASUAL MODE
---
Lol wtf
---
For the billionth time on this sub: *there are not enough players to have casual and ranked*
---
Also why do people even keep asking for casual? Everyone agrees the current matchmaking is garbage. Casual is NO matchmaking (which is probably slightly worse than the hell we currently have /s). I know you don't represent everyone, but any answer from anyone who thinks this would be helpful for me to understand.

I would've gone with pig, community seems most upset with her nerf
---
I forgot the terminology but in a sense each person has their own perspective in the game entirely. Survivors assume the killer is toxic because they're the first target. The killer assumes the survivors are toxic because they teabag or pallet loop so on. It's nonsense at this point of the game being it's a constant cycle that the community has taken influence to from streamers. Try not to overthink this so much. Try to have fun in your own way.
---
Self care breeds bad habits, change it to adrenaline. Iron will and urban evasion should be enough to not be scared of being injured.
---
Rank 14 is pretty low too.
---
Anytime
---
I’ll reply here but a cool thing is to let her evolve from the mom tontje creature per each gen done. Like maybe she starts off with no terror radius but as more gens are done she becomes faster and her terror radius grows along with evolving to look like the monster.
---
Uplayn2 is his name
---
Or it always has to be Yamaoka when I try to play Huntress :(
---
You wasn’t injured, so it didn’t work. You were deep wounded.
---
Matchmake bad
---
WHEN YOU DO IT LIKE THAT
---
Really glad you love it. And yes. My Trappy boi needs more love
---
Problem is the game cant find 4 level 20s so after a certain amount of time it just gives you whoever
---
if only it could also tey to balance it by adding an extra gen or two...
---
Play a bit of a mind game and if only one person comes for unhook, you can grab him as he unhooks. Especially if person on a hook is almost dead. You have all the time in a world, person on a hook doesn't.
---
I haven’t seen a clown in probably 6 months straight lmao.
---
Yes, I'm a neckbeard because I don't think exploiting sexual violence to win internet arguments is okay. You sure got my number.
---
Seriously what the fuck is wrong with you.
---
Same to you,  it's sad when people have to be this toxic. Like we are just trying to have fun here lol.
---
Many people feel like that. I just gave you a life tip that saved my life once. If you get stuck in a hard situation, don’t run away, try to conquer it. You really can learn how to play on this level.
---
Also, every 13th of a month the rank resets so it’s not like you’ll be stuck here forever
---
Bleh, that’s infuriating.
---
Flair checks out
---
Yes others have mentioned it being a fix. I’m assuming going into a locker resets your character state.
---
Exactly! I’m all for goofing off with the killer, but this ain’t it chief. 
---
I’m switching to killer to play around with the survivors now lol.
---
Self care is garbage
---
I play as both Killer and Survivor and prefer neither, but I honestly feel a lot more hopeless as a 7 foot all-seeing killer with a giant death stick powered by a dark, all powerful entity than a little tiny human. I get a lot more good survivor games than killer games, but good killer games are a lot more rewarding in bloodpoints and pride.
---
replace with ?
---
Exactly, and the sad part is we had saved the person who did this at the end. They were hooked once, touched a gen, failed a skill check and hid in a locker the entire remainder of the game. Micheal was chasing her team mate, she ended up running past her,  he stopped told her no and kept tunneling the other person down. I was like wtf is actually going on right now. Then let her hook farm. I 100% and going for the people who do nothing rather than the people who actually are trying to play and have fun. It's annoying.
---
When you said 9k I thought you meant 9 kills and was so confused lol
---
This is art definitely earned a Like, Sub, and Upvote
---
IT MEANS SURVIVE WITH FRIENDS.
---
If you can hit the unhooker before they got too far in the animation. Hit them (and cancel their unhooking) then hit them again after they unhook
---
If you can’t (hit won’t cancel their animation) hit the unhooked
---
Almost all of the Meg Cosmetics make her look like she grew up on the Jersey Shore or in the hood. Please give her some more interesting stuff since she seems to get 90% of the Cosmetics for female survivors. Why does she always have to have Buzz Cuts or cornrows and flashy ass outfits? Can't she just get a nice hoodie or some more braids?
---
Yes! I wouldn't of cared if he decided to farm around with someone or let anyone get hatch, but not when they ruin the game together for other surviviors! That's always fun, I like messing with surviviors using the Wraith lololol.
---
Amen to that
---
At around 11 seconds, the vault seemed to be delayed due to Ping, thats my guess as to why you got hit. Don't bother playing games above 250 ping as that 1/4 of a second makes a substantial difference
---
If the map is too big, predend that half of it doesn’t exist and never go there
---
"Ok that tone" I'm crying Patricia feel your sassy fantasy
---
Hopefully you reported them
---
Even when I play killer I have to shake my head and feel bad for the rest of the survivor team when one bitch drops it immediately
---
Dealing with the effect in a less painful way, still just sounds like a counter, because realistically in this situation. 9 times out of 10, the survivor being dropped will immediately go back down effectively countering Adrenaline since the killer is probably expecting Adrenaline to pop.

It truly is!

I play on pc.
---
Lol yes! Or if I use trapper I always step in my own traps so they know I’m goofing off!
---
He might mean "touch a gen and then go look for other ones"?
---
On Lery's, I sometimes do the same so that survivors can always HEAR gens if they can't see them. It also makes killers think someone might be nearby when they aren't.
---
Just dew it
---
I really dislike all of the giant bamboo stalks and random jungle gyms
---
5 blink nurse is a TERRIBLE add-on combo. Range is the most important stat for nurse as it affects everything from charge time to blink movement speed. 
---
You can’t really blink over a rock with those add-ons without it taking 4 years.
---
Just use rocks and tires to your advantage and you’ll be fine
---
4 blink with bonus range tho, that’s the biggest bullshit (not the strongest but the easiest to use) no one uses because they want to be cool with those 5 blinks
---
Hey, this is another Survivor Wave of Concepts Pops.
---
I know what your thinking (Where are The Killers?)
---
Dont worry im putting some last details to the Hillbilly. Ill be posting them very soon.
---
Let me now what you think in the comments.
---
(If you dont like Funko Pops thats fine, just dont  blame me)
---
You can always disable it if you don’t want it
---
The short cooldown seems a bit strong though. I'd say at least a 30 second cooldown at level 3. Love the idea, diversion is one of my favorite and your perk is pretty similar.
---
teaming can get your permanently banned right?
---
lol typically theres some kind of good average in ranks for matchmaking even with swfs but that's just straight awful
---
You normally can’t, but if you bought the character and still have those offerings on your other characters, playing with those offerings will use your build
---
Don’t kick gens, stay in loops for longer than necessary, and only hook everyone once. You’ll de-pip, but still earn decent points. And you’re still playing the game, just badly, so it’s not worth a ban.
---
BBQ tho
---
A is Object of Obsession, E is Kindred and Dark Sense, F is Deja Vu
---
I am one of the people who paid full price for this game, back when it was more than $20. It’s incredibly insulting to pay so much money for a game that is full of bugs and bad design made by people who don’t understand their playerbase; it’s worse when the very people making the game have been only releasing new content that can only be bought with real money and not the useless in game currencies. It is complete shit when all those new contents are $8 to even $15, and the game is still broken and all the devs can say is “soon.” They’ve got a dedicated community of people who love the game but just want simple fixes, and they keep trying to milk as much money from us as possible without fixing many issues (and when they do fix something they break 10 other things).  Boohoohoo, coding is hard, but when you have been working on a game for 3 years and have grown as a company, you’re kind of past the excuse timeframe.
---
This is the content I subscribed to see! Beautiful escape
---
Why though.. You get like no points that way
---
Excellent trapper map though. Good luck finding a dark trap anywhere on that map outdoors
---
Pretty sure they never intended the ranking system to be something everyone shoved so far up their own asses lol the devs themselves all play at around ranks 12-10, so they seem to take it less serious and just play to play, unlike many people in the community.
---
Oh I can't wait for the day when this shit is over and clothing/characters items cannot be bought with real money.
---
I'm dreaming I know.
---
Yeah I was exaggerating ofcourse. But Legacy should never return. I was proud to get the legacy items I did it took so much time.
---
Not all the time
---
I GOT THIS GAME TODAY AND HAVE NEVER HAD LESS FUN, AS A KILLER CONSTANT 4 STACKS OF PEOPLE WITH PURPLE PERKS AND ALL THAT, AS A SURVIVOR CAMPED CONSTANTLY AND CHASED TO HELL AND BACK LIKE THEY FOCUS ONLY ON ME. SURE MY TEAM DOES WELL CUZ WHILE IM BEING CAMPED THEY GET GENERATORS BUT I DONT GET SHIT IN TERMS OF BLOOD COIN THINGS SO I DONT LEVEL OR GET PERKS TO ACTUALLY COMPETE. VERY NOT NOOB FRIENDLY AND I AM GOING AGAINST PEOPLE WITH RANKS 10-13 AND I AM A FUCKING RANK 20. LEVEL 9 LIKE WTF OS BALANCE? I SUCK SO BAD AND REALLY FEEL LIKE I WASTED MY MONEY
---
S t u p I d
---
No one ever does it, but it’s possible. I play using a PS4 controller and if you just slightly push the stick forward your character will walk at a steady pace. The footfall sounds are slowed down to match, so I’m wondering what the animation looks like.
---
So I don't have the best internet. I can get usually 120-160 while I'm a survivor, but sometimes when  I attempt to play killer, I see the survivors get very high ping. (Like 300-400 ish)
---
Is it okay if I still go through with it since they can see their ping and have a choice to stay in the lobby, or should I give up on playing killer when it does that?
---
I use none of these perks, explain what the build is meant to do for me?
---

Thank you

Bonus points if you get what/who I'm referencing lmao

Had such a terrible time as nurse trying to get her blink daily. Tried to then get huntress and got tbagged for camping. Uninstalled game.
---
That thicc mama is in for a good time but it's no surprise it'd take three shirtless Davids to take on thicc mama.
---
It seems to be bugged at the moment, there have been a couple times where it just won’t register that I’m struggling and kill me
---
You in fact used this meme incorrectly my man. I understand what you're trying to convey, but unfortunately it isn't the appropriate response to the picture.
---
Why was the key on the ground?
---
Franklin’s demise makes you drop held items when hit, so someone might’ve brought one in and got hit
---
10/10 more please
---
You shall become a menace. One hit is all it takes. Unless they have iron will, you don't even have to chase them away. Just go back patrolling gens or totems or whatever. You'll one tap them when you find them again, usually making noise as they heal or get healed. If they are getting healed, get the insta down on the weak one, then wound the healer. Rinse, repeat.
---
Eh... As a long time fan of Chucky I don't see it. Bill was a Vietnam War vet and a Green Beret.
---
Lol this games devs have trouble balancing 1 killer and 4 survivors. Do you really want them to waste time trying to balance a mode with multiple killers?
---
I think if they were trying to do a mode with multiple killers it would have to be like Freddy vs Jason or something, where the killers goal is to kill the other killer and the survivors are just caught in the middle.
---
Well, the amount of time it takes for Devour Hope to start working is way too long. They'll have it broken as soon as you start oneshotting people, if not randomly before that. 
---
Third Seal's a joke. 
---
Ruin can be good, but more and more people are learning to just work through it, and it doesn't buy you NEARLY as much time as it used to against good survivors. 
---
Thrill is a joke. 
---
Haunted Grounds and NOED is the only one that's really high risk, high reward, and people cannot stop bitching about NOED, so I think that's very telling as to the balance of hex perks.
---
If my motivation lets me :)
---
They aren't asking for it, but they can't complain about it either, I think. 
---
Like, unless their name is "Tunnel Me Please" they aren't directly asking for it. 
---
But turning your name into a billboard is already a bit desperate/sleazy, and you are literally creating a problem that wouldn't exist without that input. 
---
So while I won't snipe on general principle, I can understand and not entirely condemn the people who do.
---
You have a lot of frustration ahead lol. Playing mediocre killers after maining the cream of the crop is just going to annoy you. 
---
That being said, mind gaming is always the best option unless you run brutal / bamboozle. If you don't run brutal strength you'll lose most games wasting time kicking pallets. Even if they don't loop you and just throw down pallets you'll likely get stalled for 3 or more gens against an equally skilled survivor if you try to just hold w.
---
I’m new to killer, and I lose people all the time. Once I hear the chase music, I’ll look around for 5 seconds. If I can’t see anyone or just too confused, I just walk away to find something else to do
---
Literally just played my second game as Killer for daily ritual stuff.  First time was Billy for chainsaws, got a SWF that all survive (partially my fault, didn't realize the one hooked person had a temp invuln perk) and they all crouch spam at the exit when the whole game I was struggling to learn about how to move around the map with chainsaw.  Second game I played just now is on Huntress and I managed to get three kills after the group I was against went super-altruistic and fed themselves to me trying to rescue the last hooked guy.  I say GGWP in post-game because they pretty much wrecked me up to that point and one of them says "Sure thing you shitter."  Keep in mind that I have one perk + no addons since I had no bp and this team had 3-4 each and brought items.
---
I get that sometimes you're gonna get unfair matches, it happens in any game.  But unfair matches plus people being assholes about it is kinda the shit icing to the garbage cake.  Funnily enough it's usually the survivors that are assholes while I notice more killers will usually gg in postgame chat.
---
1 Gen Left, No Hooks intensify
---
Dr.evil for killer when?
---
I'm really not into checking skins release dates, I just don't care about them. For me every P3 is better than any skin, especially since they're so expensive, that you could buy almost 3 non-licensed characters for iridescent shards for the price of one outfit :P
---
it's fucking terrifying when you don't know who the killer is and you just randomly pop a trap
---
Bonus repair speed, and faster wiggling? Why not add in a free extra hit to make the trifecta of over-suggested broken survivor perks?
---
You just never faced good nurses
---
Is it incest If David fucks himself ?
---
Randy would beat the bajesus any and all killers
---
Not really toxic. They probably were scared. After all they are rank 20s
---
Are you deaf and blind?
---
I wouldn't say so. Look at Clown and Spirit release dates. June 12 and September 18. 98 days difference between them. We got June chapter (GhostFace) even later on June 18. And we also got Freddy rework recently, so I'd bet September 17, or maybe even later. Remember that devs always released a PTB a few weeks before new chapter (in case of Spirit PTB was released on August 28, exactly 3 weeks before official release). I think we would already get a PTB if it September 3rd was official release date. But it is possible that September 3rd will be the release date of PTB.
---
learning the game isn't going to stop you from getting shit teammates lol
---
It just much slower animation. Not a big deal.
---
alternatively use the other door
---
Careful ...many survivor DCers swims these reddit waters like selfish KAREN sharks.  No sense of team play.  I Love a good round of survivor.  More intense.  Killer is easier on the psychy for those who don't play well with others.
---
There is a small group of Nurses on ps4 that can destroy teams, like good teams, SWF teams
---
Dont wanna be like “not to toot my own horn”
---
But id consider myself a good ps4 nurse
---
It’s because Claudette literally WAS white in the alpha.
---
Cluadettes XD
---
WTF?
---
The survivor is behind you, tea bagging and following you
---
This is great lol
---
It's okay to kill a human, but not okay to kill an animal? 1 human worth more than 1000 dogs.
---
I play no add-on or perk nurse on console for fun sometimes and she still absolutely demolishes survivors. The simple fact that she can ignore loops makes her S+ tier on any platform. She may have a high learning curve, and you don't have the sensitivity to do 180-lunges but she is still the strongest killer hands down with a bit of practice.
---
Im not sure wether to take that as a compliment or not but thank you anyways :)

Yep, they obviously wanted a kind of diverse cast for the beginning, but they didn't want to reinforce racial stereotypes, so they made the Smart and Nerdy girl Black instead of the Urban, Sporty one, as seen by Meg originally being black in Alpha footage.
---
imagine if when you bing-bonged when you're revealed but canceled it before the bar gets full, you got the "old windstorm" speedboost with a duration based on how long you've been bing-bonging
---
Maybe if it was only shown at a certain range. Say 10 meters.. other than that I agree with you
---
Not really, it’s just nostalgia
---
in you are name
---
His add-ons are good tho. he has many good add-ons to choose from. his base power is way too weak
---
one day i'm gonna put ttv in my name just to play the killer like a damn fiddle
---
Been there. I couldn't heal at all and then that shit happened. I ran to the edge and fell off, only to get lucky and "respawn" in front of the hatch :-D
---
I seen answer how to deal with that problem, but I dont remember the path. Can you wait for a while till I remember it?
---
I love this Claudette in action, name, and example. Press F to pay respects ;_;7
---
You know, I don't see a lot of jumpscares by Ghostface.
---
Grow up. 
---
If you don’t grow up, we’ll never get our glory. 
---
We’ll never defeat survivor’s crew. 
---
And just so we’re clear... 
---
The killers team isn’t some buddy-buddy club with a bunch of losers 
---
Who just talks about moriing people while trying to cheer each other up.
---
Once we decide in our hearts that we’re gonna sacrafice someone
---
THE DEED’S ALREADY BEEN DONE.
---
Tires
---
The fact that you stopped in shock and hovered over the prompt to throw the hatchet some reason made it for me. Nice tosses
---
OP on plague
---
The real question is why give Nea and Meg corn rows to begin with
---
Again, don't call it a crutch if it's bad. A literal crutch is something you use if your leg is broken or injured to help you walk. If you want to call it something else, fine. Don't get attached to a word just because you like to insult something, when it's wrongfully used
---
Exit gates are already open and they're currently tea bagging you.
---
I want thick borders back
---
If it's later in the game, you could just drop the pallet early and they have no choice but to break it either ways, in case you want to play around potential spirit fury. If it's at the start of the game, they won't have their two stacks. Either ways, it's still an extremely safe spot
---
Nice. I have a very similar clip of me also getting BM'ed, getting up with adrenaline and opening the hatch with a key (and it was a Spirit too lmao). I'm not sure why killers choose to let people go and close the hatch first. It's so risky.
---
Love it :)
---
I'm a hag main, and yesterday I played Myers for a daily.
---
And I can say I had honestly forgot what it was like to be able to see.
---
He put it down right before he got hit.
---
Doesn’t he already have a game?
---
This is me, I have about 30 hours now and haven't been anywhere past rank 15 killer and I'm always put up against rank 4-10s, sometimes rank 2s, and they're just always so toxic. It's kind of disheartening, but at the same time, I've just learnt to be toxic back. Especially If I vs. Swf groups, I just tunnel and face camp the ones that are toxic until they DC. It's not my ideal way of playing, but it is satisfying if necessary.
---
Now we just need to not make her stand like a robot.
---
It's dead.
---
Fair enough, I remember when people were telling me it was gonna kill DBD
---
Could have been an accident on your end, try getting a refund through your bank or contacting PlayStation support or whatever they have to help.
---
Fair enough I remember when people were telling me it was going to kill dead by daylight
---
Real talk, it's insane how many times it has been brought up, even I brought up the idea of faster wiggling before.
---
I wonder how broken a wiggle build with what we have available if a wiggle speed increase perk was added. Like running Boil Over, Flip Flop, Tenacity and Unbreakable, a lot of times I've been hooked with like under 10% left to wiggle free and even just getting 1 person to take a hit body blocking would often have gotten me out. I feel like if you were to remove Tenacity and put in the wiggle % increase, you'd be able to wiggle out almost every time you're grabbed if you just ran to a corner.
---
*Every killer disliked that*
---
I'm not that familiar with Moris, so i'm not sure if a kill counts towards the sacrifice category. If it does, then yeah you are probably right, but then why even bring an Ebony at this point? From what i gather, the primary reason to use a mori is to take out some annoying survivor who can loop you forever and/or is particularly toxic towards you.
---
BTW for anyone getting the wrong idea, I was not the person who teabagged him.
---
I don't get why lmao, they're only similar by concept not gameplay or really anything else
---
To be honest i just ignore any trash talk cuase it’s not worth my time
---
So much hate for streamers trying to grow their community in this game...
---
Wish I could get a bear trap hat from them. I'd be so happy mainly because saw is my favorite horror movie.
---
It is 100% a kids show. It has "scary" elements but it's a bunch of 8 year olds running around playing superpowers. The whole first season there was ONE *off-screen* death of a nothing character.
---
It's aimed at teenagers at best.
---
It's still considered a crutch to sustaining a longer match while being unproductive. A crutch isn't necessarily good or bad. 
---
In the low ranks people would gen rush. The closer you get to red ranks, the less people gen rush. Most players stall the game with healing constantly. While remaining unproductive. If you have to self care within the 1st minute of the match, you're doing something wrong. Not that it's you....
---
If you're wasting valuable time in which someone is getting chased, and you're over here healing, over completing generators. Something is wrong... bad players crutch for advantages, and don't play properly .
---
If you're using a crutch that doesn't hinder no one, but suits your playstyle, then I have no problem with that. It's still a crutch, but who cares... enjoy yourself.
---
Self care hinders objectives when there's a hex ruin, and no one is working on a damn generator, while some guy is getting chased for 2-5 + minutes.
---
Now if the whole team ran self care. Then you can see why I say that 3-5 times using self care accumulates gradually into nothing getting done. That's my problem. The moment 2 players run the perk it tremendously stalls. 
---
Most players are afraid to do anything if they're injured. They're scared. Most self care users abuse the perk, and remain unproductive the whole game, just to outlive and run to the hatch. That's my point, and that's a community problem with everyone. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I ran self care in 2018 so I'm not biased, but Now it sucks. Plus add bloody butcher or Thanatophobia, with 3 or 4 self cares, and it's game over. 
---
Example.
---
Team lost to an easy legion, because he had Thanatophobia, and all 3 of em ran self care. He wasn't tunneling or anything. The game was long. 15- 20 minutes. Last 2 generators. 4 alive, barely any hooked. Constant healing &amp; mending just to go get hit again, and go heal again ×3 other players= each wasting over 10 minutes of being unproductive, while I'm repairing, and wounded. No 1 lived, but me, and I was dead on hook, and injured going for the objectives then wasting time on slowass healing against a non threatening killer. It's a crutch that hinders everyone. Which is why it gets bashed, and frowned upon.
---
Lol, top tag for it on Netflix; "teen shows."
---
I stare at his
---
Breaking news: Teenagers are officially children
---
MAN THIS GOOD AND SCARY
---
I twentyfirst that
---
I twenty-first that
---
He got 1 person. That guy still managed to get unhook i guess, and no one destroyed the totem.
---
 Yeah, it was a bad trapper. My point was, he didn't get rewarded. A bad player is not guaranteed to get a 1K or a 4K. If the killer gets a 4K on a noed, the team definitely did something wrong to all get slaughtered in an instant. Even if he wipes half the team, that's not overpowered or rewarded. It's simply granted as a perk ability with no guarantees.
---
That looks exactly like me
---
0 Kills with Noed? Whatever. Maybe he had a bad day.     
---
0 Kills with Ebony Mori? Impossible.
---
WHY IS IT CAMPING WHEN THERE'S CLEARLY PEOPLE WHO I CAN SEE GOING FOR THE SAVE!!
---
In the deadbydaylight sub. At the top right. Click on the 3 dots. Go to community info, and look up glossary. Everything u need to know, just incase you didn't know this community had a glossary for all terms.
---
Until they have stridor
---
That fricking totem placement is so sick. I just had a game where the killer had it there. Needless to say, we just pushed through ruin.
---
I actually prefer this over the current one. To me, it’s just easy on the eyes.
---
I mean, the very first time I played dbd I played as Wraith and got bullied by a toxic 4man swf group that were purple ranks :/
---
Your name is casually clutching. Come on bro. How can you live up to that name. When you want a nerf on a B tier perk....
---
I don't want games getting easier. What be the point of getting good... best players need to be constantly challenged. Not win, because they're God tier.
---
No that’d be broken, also would make no sense as he’s a cannibal, not a wizard
---
He isn’t supernatural, i don’t see any reason as to why he should be able to.
---
i love this video so much oh my god
---
The Spirit World was always there.
---
I will probably get downvoted but I need an answer for it. Would I be in the wrong if there is only me and 1 other survivor left and we both get downed and the killer put the other survivor on the hook but purposely allowed me to escape via gate or hatch. Happened at least 4 times yesterday
---
As a solo queue survivor main, I must cleanse an average of about 2.5 dull totems again, it's not uncommon for me to cleanse 4, yet NOES still activates because my teammates like to pretend dull totems don't exist. It's certainly not easily counterable because if it were "easy" I wouldn't have to waste time I could be spending on generators just to actively hunt dull totems because my team refuses to cleanse them, merely for a CHANCE of preventing a perk they may not even have. NOED's only easily counterable in SWF, I don't think I should be getting punished for actively trying to prevent something from happening and being punished for the mistakes of my team. Furthermore, NOED isn't challenging, because it isn't fair. There's a difference between a challenge, and utter bullshit. If I'm being chased by a killer with NOED there is literally no way I can escape a lot of the time, even if I were flawless. In endgame there are very few pallets, and the killer is wary of the fact that you're going to be going for an exit gate so they're going to force you away from those gates as best as they can, and considering that they have all the control, they will. 
---
If they've got NOED and there's a TTV on my team I totally get it though.
---
only shit I hate bout ever putting ttv in my name is when people decide to get a stick up their ass and tunnel, camp, etc. Just because of 3 letters. I've played games where I do absolutely nothing toxic and don't even play well, but still get camped and tunneled and even a few where the killer brings a mori and just spams the start up so you take longer to bleed out.
---
Will say though, most of the time that people act like cunts just because of ttv they seem to also be watching and hoping for a reaction. A few times now I've had people doing shit just to be annoying, I acknowledge it and say, "Whatever I'll just take this as an opportunity for a break." Then play shit on my phone, go to the washroom, etc. If you're trying to be a shithead for a reaction, it's as simple as not providing it.
---
It's also unecessary because basement face exists lmao. I can just sit on the side with insidious and get the same results.
---
is that daddy ace I ses
---
Her skin overall is just a mess. She doesn’t look like a black person. She basically looks like a white person in blackface, skin-tone wise. Her palms are as dark as the rest of her skin, her complexion undertone is a weird, pink-ish gray and honestly it ruins a lot of her looks, because she isn’t ugly, it’s just that the devs really didn’t know how to make dark skin back then. Thankfully Tapp and Adam both look good and have realistic features.
---
Oh wow! I would have been so salty ngl (not with the looping, you gotta do what you gotta do to survive). I'm not one of those people who hates camping, if it is something you need to do then do it, it is a game, but the showing off and the ringing of the bell is just, oml I would have been calling my computer so many names there. lol
---
Quick and quiet, Sprint burst, depending on the map Balanced landing is also good. I like quick and quiet because it allows you to fast vault windows without making any noise, it can confuse killers and they'll go an entirely different direction trying to find you since they didn't get a notification that you vaulted, Sprint Burst for when the killer sees you but you see them first, so you have time to outrun them, fake a direction you're going in (leave tracks but then walk away and go a different route), and then balanced landing for if you get something like haddonfield or any map with drops so you can just haul ass, vault a ledge, and Sprint away to do the same as you would with Sprint burst
---
There are some vids on juking tips and tricks that sre super helpful. If you want to Be a good juker then watch those videos. 
---
Perks like Balanced Landing, Dance with Me, Quick and Quiet and Dead Hard are all helpful for juking and buying time during a chase. But none of these perks are gonna automatically make you a good juker, tutorials are way more helpful. If you become a good juker without those perks... It's probably better.
---
If you still find it difficult consider being a more stealth oriented player and focus on hiding from the killer, doing gens and healing:
---
Spine Chill
---
Urban Evasion
---
Iron Will
---
Bond
---
This is a good stealth build that I run fairly often.
---
A hardcore playstyle against odds is a clutch/challenge. It's not common to pull off, but not impossible. Also, cleansing totems isn't necessary the only counter. It's not a guaranteed kill. Even with a 1 K or 2K. 4 shouldn't wipe. 
---
You can also come prepared if it's something that bother you tremendously in other ways then just getting chased, and getting destroyed.
---
I shouldn't need to waste my item on something like a black key or my perk slot on something like adrenaline just to counter the possibility of one perk. The sheer fact that that's a common suggestion proves how powerful it is in itself
---
These survivors are all brand-new, even the one who dc'd just had basic Claud perks. You have Ruin and LF perks...
---
And as Myers no less, shame. Shame shame.
---
Way, way back in the alpha stage, Claudette was white, and if I'm not mistaken, Meg was black. White Claudette looked like [this.](https://i.imgur.com/Gu9UpqW.png) I don't know if they kept the same face model and just darkened her skin, but idk.
---
This might sound over powered.
---
Let Wraith attack while cloaked, but would make him uncloak and put his ability on a long cooldown, maybe for 75 seconds. This can only work on healthy survivors. He can still uncloak by channeling his ability.
---
Stripper Ace, tobe precise.
---
So they fairly recently changed matchmaking to shorter queues but allow a wider range of players to be added to a lobby. SWF also greatly increases the range as well.
---
Don't fall for fakes and wait till they commit for unhook. Also you have to be right behind them. If you are a bit away, you gonna swing.
---
Never been in a game where the killer slugs everyone and leaves people to just bleed out on the floor?
---
It's extremely boring.
---
Come play with me then - PC - BotherShawn - TTV
---
Probably not the only one.
---
Ok ty, I just get confused because other times I’d be hugging a window whilst the survivor is vaulting and I still don’t get the grab, I’ll just keep practicing.
---
Why does the hatch always seem to want to spawn in that spot on Badham?
---
Yep, i just had a conversation with someone about this, they switched the two’s skin colours around to avoid controversy and racial stereotyping, making Meg a regular Sporty woman and gave the urban-esque character to Nea instead.
---
I never heard about any changes to OoO. I heard a 'dev' in a stream still make fun of it as a weak perk. Also remember a key add-on can also reveal within 32m
---
When I’m mashing the button, sometimes I’ll get distracted and I’ll miss the button for a split second and die, rip.
---
Now you understand why everyone says Rank Reset is bullshit.
---
The red that you emit in front of you. Like the survivors make red scratches when running, as killer you are constantly emitting a red stain in the direction you are facing. Watch some videos on here. There are perks that can reduce and even eliminate it.
---
Saying billy is OP but noed is balanced lmfao what are you on
---
How it’s feels when your blinking around as nurse
---
You don't even have to play the game, you can literally be AFK as killer and still get almost the same amount of shards
---
Completely agree - I'm not an ankle twister so I'm more of an immersed player when I'm surviving;  typically running:
---
Spine Chill, Calm Spirit, Iron Will, and Urban Evasion
---
I'll swap out Calm Spirit for either Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, or Quick &amp; Quiet occasionally and it's been pretty effective.
---
Wooosh
---
Things would be somewhat easier if you could spawn into an empty map and practice your unique killer mechanics.
---
The survivor tutorial gives you your basic toolset, it covers everything except anti-killer movement. From there on out, the rest is experience.
---
The killer tutorial tells you how to hook. That's it.
---
These Devs legitimately don't care about your opinions. Don't waste your time
---
Guys, which keys open the hatch? Only the rare ones?
---
I have a few keys left but I never use it. After seeing this OP, you inspired me!
---
It sounds like a nice perk idea, actually. Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike also counter tunnelling and even camping.
---
Spirit is one of the highest skill caps in the game. If you are not willing to invest many hours into learning her then go for Clown
---
Should've thrown a lump of coal between your cheeks before the escape so you could pull a diamond out when the match ended...for real though that looked stressful AF
---
\*flashlights for you Americans
---
You will get steamrolled at high ranks without Ruin as Trapper
---
Dankeshön.
---
I WENT ON MY FIRST KILLER GAME OF THE DAY AS A BILLY AND LITERALLY 3 OF THE 4 SURVIVORS DC'D AND THE LAST ONE GOT THE HATCH
---
WHAT THE FUCK
---
Yep 😂😂
---
And this is why I use iron grasp.
---
Relatable
---
i had a similar episode. I was the last one, and i was in one of the houses. i was downed, so i couldn't run or recover coz i didn't have bill perk. the killer (was a nurse) was searching for me, and i managed to get in that sort of basement. i had luck 100 in that moment and i found the hatch. my crawling to the hatch has been of almost 5 minutes. it was so painful, but atleast i escaped  
---
sorry for my english, im italian, F
---
I think they were the same people that thought DBD was a F13 clone.
---
I don't understand the hate around The Game. Lery's is much worse.
---
i always play solo survivor 'cause i don't like breaking the game mechanics with external comms, but it's freaking tiring.
---
We get nerf to the ground just to allow killers to face swf… every other uptades it becomes worst
---
This is beautiful.
---
Whenever I play killer, I don’t come across OoO very often, you can’t really counter that perk. Sometime you have to kill them first, or do it in a way where it’s not tunneling, because you will get shit for it.
---
Uhh, why tho, she looks perfectly fine
---
Wow making a Sniper reference as doc .
---
Only a week? Damn BHVR is slacking. Hopefully they up it to perma for the next offense.
---
Poor Baby killer
---
Now I'm imagining a skin where she looks like just a normal person in a dress, but she's still yelling at you, using mud to teleport, and then promptly eating your liver.
---
Purple and pink
---
Ew
---
Wow, they did it, they gave us shirtless Kate. Not Myers but still.
---
ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T PLAY THAT OFTEN, IT TAKES ME A WHILE TO CLIMB BACK TO 8-ISH WHERE I ENJOY THE GAME, WITH IT BEING NOT TOO EASY AND NOT TOO HARD &amp; THEN ALL THAT IS LOST AND I HAVE TO SPEND ANOTHER 2 WEEKS PLAYING SHIT GAMES JUST TO REACH MY OLD LEVEL
---
Seems you had fun
---
It was top for a day or two, no problem
---
Thank you kindly! :)
---
No problem. I like to put the weaved ring and milky glass add ons on it when I'm trying to use the hatch. The first lets you lose it instead of the key if you die, and the second does the same, but for if you open the hatch
---
I'M SHITE AT USING DECISIVE, BECAUSE AS SOON AS I ESCAPE 8 SECONDS LATER THE KILLER CATCHES UP AND DOWNS ME AGAIN. EITHER THAT OR JUST GET TUNNELED. RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS OF WHAT PERKS TO USE BECAUSE NONE OF THEM ACTUALLY HELP ME ONCE THE KILLER IS ON ME
---
Understandable, sorry if i came off as hostile.
---
Keep the fight for chucky going!
---
Not really, see the game is like lery's but with 2 floors and really annoying for both survivor and killer cause you have to cover so much ground finding gens totmes or survivors, is really hard and gets annoying really fast
---
Maaan, it's all about them **CURVES BROTHER**
---
I'm using console from my experiences since the servers are different. if it's different on PC okay. Also no PC and Console aren't Equal. PC will always be better a Nurse Main On PC would crush console players it's one of the main reasons crossplay isn't in the game. Joysticks just give you better camera controls as survivor and better aiming with Killers like Huntress and Nurse
---
A single T3 perk is considered a full build?
---
the ace tho
---
waited half an hour to go against level 10s who teabagged and flashlight spammed constantly
---
and survivors wonder why people run noed and facecamp ;-;
---
Its terrifying, i'm only Rank 17 as killer, do you know how many times i've been gen rushed bullied and humiliated by solo and or swf survivor squads much higher rank then me lately? a lot
---
You can avoid the camping penalty If you hook in the basement if you go upstairs go into some corner then use insidious and when you see somebody then go downstairs and use your chainsaw.
---
what u get 4 camping loser
---
Now I use Pop I only got clown level 35 yesterday.
---
She looks like a cancer patient
---
but... she would also do sacrifices and self-mutilation for her gods(i think she was unknowingly worshiping the entity and that's why she got a spot with the others)
---
If you're talking about [this](https://youtu.be/iVEfNZlam0Q?t=111), it was removed to help with his stealth along with the sounds of cloth flapping in the wind.
---
Hag was easy, at least from a hag main perspective. She was super easy. Just got to play her right and not rely on the perks. Devour hope will not let you get the adept though unless you are super lucky.
---
I thoughtthis was an ad lol.
---
It's just the 2nd variation for his top.
---
I would prefer killer. Besides the bloodpoints, playing Killer is sort of thrilling. Though, sometimes you get looped the entire game, and everyone escapes, but that dosen't stop you from getting a 4k or a 24k your next trial. Also to add to the pile, you have *some* survivors at the mercy of you as they aren't prepared, or they're just bad altogether.
---
Survivors? Sure, they have some power over the game, but ultimately, the Killer's perks and strategy is the only thing limiting the Survivors and their ability to control the trial. Survivors don't have much over the killer besides Pallets and Flashlights. They also take away the "thrill" part of the game as you're basically doing generators the entire match and being altruistic. 
---
Ultimately, this is my opinion, and though now opinions always get frowned upon on the internet, I'm only a Killer main and sometimes play survivor. 
---
Also, don't mind the salt whenever you use Blood Warden on survivors, its just a minor side effect to "Thinking Ahead".
---
Oh, thanks for the information.
---
have fun getting probed by the entity
---
I tenth-fourth that
---
This is what happens when you have developers that repeatedly cater to shitlords. If you keep giving players the ability to bully via endless 2nd chance/get away for free abilities then you're asking for a player base like this. Not to mention catering to them the instant they cry about x killer or x strategy and FFS not even punishing ragequitting then this is what happens. The majority of survivors are spoiled little children that were never told "No!" And their behavior (ironically) was left unchecked.
---
Omg smiling Myers with shirtless Myers CHOKE ME HARDER DADDY MYERS
---
Maybe but it's still ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Thank you! Honestly I don't know a lot about skin tones and their different undertones, but it pissed me of that her face was so much more orange than her body and her lips lighter, so I'm glad to know it looks right!
---
Thank youuuuuuuuu
---
Thanks so muchhh
---
of course, only middle aged white males can be bald
---
I honestly don't get accused of tunneling or camping much. Only times I get yelled at are when people open the gates and I proxy camp a hook because what the hell else am I going to do? I don't run NoED so hitting healthy survivors is pointless.
---
Friday the 13th the Game. It was supposed to be a big thing that would kill Dead by Daylight but nobody plays it anymore.
---
Only thing you could do is get a VPN or try changing your IP address but it's a pain in the ass to change the IP. People who use MLGA to dodge killers are twats.
---
You don't need to be shroud to hit people as Nurse. The biggest difference is Huntress, who is legitimately difficult to use on a joystick because no aim assist on hatchet. But every M1 has aim assist, and hitboxes are broken as hell in this game.
---
It isn't the Nurse's aim that makes her OP, it's her ability to bust game mechanics. Decent tracking will get you there.
---
Ngl I hate this cosmetic
---
Micheal up their too he is legit kist walking evil feels nothing no remorse can change a family bloodline with a single day
---
YES PLEASE
---
Being chased isn't being tunelled.
---
Wait. Is that bill from left for dead lmao?
---
Rank 9 solo playing, I'm getting into rank 17-20 lobbies.
---
Let me do you one better,    Ner Lockers
---
I think just not showing the killers period unless it is a bloody party streamers is good enough. Let killer see survivors as it makes sense since the killer is “watching” them before the match
---
His legs broke as they landed on solid metal
---
&gt;I realize it's more realistic for him to get hurt by his traps, but he is currently the only killer who is hurt by his own power. 
---
Leatherface's Tantrum and his power just existing in general.
---
Your public IP addressed is assigned to your router/modem by your ISP. It shouldn’t be hard for them to change it (if they offer the ability), but if your justification is “to get past an IP ban” they likely won’t do it.
---
With dedicated servers, dc'ing will hopefully come with harsh penalties. So people dc'ing coz of mori wont really be an option.
---
As with suiciding, thats kinda how it be. Moris should really be used unless the chances of winning without one seem to be very low in the lobby (4 man swf, really good survivor etc.) or you just hate the person(s) in your lobby.
---
Idk, bringing a mori pretty much guarantees a win for the killer.
---
I think Michael would fit in the most messed up. But it's still your opinion.
---
Chasing someone is the only objective for killers. Just like doing gens for survivors. I can't understand "gen rush" and "oh he is after me for so long" complaints.
---
It's really not that much extra work to snipe someone, especially if you're used to doing it. TTVs get tunneled constantly, I don't know what you're talking about. Tunneling is whatever. Sniping is cheating. It happens all the time.
---
Sooo uhh I got hag but added 1000 auric cells to get a skin for her but I didn’t realise the sale ended :(
---
It takes 1 survivor (without a toolbox) 80 seconds to repair a generator this is also assuming they never hit a great skill check.
---
If that 1 survivor is using an Engineers Toolbox with Socket Swivels that goes down to 57 seconds (again without great skill checks).
---
(X) Doubt
---
WTF Ace's cosmetics are the best!
---
I think the big problem is that the reportsystem doesn't even seem to do anything. Noo feedback and people still seem to be toxic in postgame
---
That shit happened to me once when I was playing against legion and the Dwight was teaming up with him. It was so annoying :/
---
Saboteur is a perk that, along with the sabotaging without toolbox at 50% speed effect, the hook/trap becomes unusable for an extra 10s/20s/30s (I, II &amp; III).
---
A trap takes 3 minutes to respawn which gets increased to 3m 30s with sabotuer. A hook is exactly the same.
---
Make your decision if its worth picking.
---
Not really. More like. Yay 15sec longer to live!!!
---

Someone with a mori isnt a troll
---
I like it. And she’s kinda cute when bald. BHVR, make it real, plea!
---
Aye chicken nugget your special go want a movie with the set 8 kids
---
he also proxy camped to make sure he got the mori off ASAP (to the detriment of his own bloodpoints) moried the entire survivor squad that way and was a rank 1 killer (according to achievements) in a rank 15 match. Plus the thousands of screenshots of the same exact thing was still pretty weird...
---
My face wanting to know how you knew it was SWF
---
The game is awesome for survivor, what?
---
Tons of safe pallets.
---
theres a section for fan creations on the forums.
---
Poor red rank survivors getting a yellow rank ;)
---
remove his slowdown when he charges his chainsaw and instantly op
---
I can stand gen rushers, they’re doing their objectives fair and square.
---
What really ticks me is people with fully kitted out perks and consumables that are clearly out of my league, but decides to not do gens and just taunt me with endless loops and flashlights.
---
I once survived a match as a rank 13 with a lobby full of purple ranks, I was the only one to escape and one of the purple ranked survivors sent me a message that I didn't deserve to escape
---
When it came out, I played it first over this but then remember getting this when it went on sale or went free on PS+. In F13, the atmosphere of the game was amazing. It truly felt like you were in a Friday the 13th movie kind of like how you have here where the killer and map match. There were a couple more ways to finish a match as a survivor (or camp counselor), one being able to kill Jason. It was also RNG, too, so items for certain things would show up in different areas of the map.
---
Metas and strats were established as there were perks or skills in F13, too, but not as descriptive as DBD’s. For Jason, there would be different versions of him from each of his movies that would have strengths and weaknesses that lined up to those movies so that different Jasons wouldn’t simply just be skins (besides 8bit Jason). Voice chat was key as the map was probably bigger and more communication was needed for certain plans like “You guys take the boat, we’ll take the car, you’ll call the police, etc”.
---
Some of the gameplay was similar like doing skill checks. When you put the gas in to the car, gas in to the boat, the car battery in to the car, the fuse in to the phone box, etc., there would be a similar skill window that popped up. Each time you failed, it would alert Jason. Just like in DBD and with the right communication, you just trick Jason in to going to a certain location so that someone could finish a task quickly knowing that his teleport is now on cooldown.
---
Where the similarity ended was how chases were handled. You could kite Jason, but you could also fight him with certain weapons or items on the ground that would only stun him. If he was stunned for a couple of times, he would then enter a rage state where all of his abilities would then be increased, so stunning was simply something you wanted to do as least as possible. Everyone would essentially be Mori’d as hooking wasn’t a thing, but some environmental kills allowed you to hook people (there was even a glitch where people that Jason picked up and choked would stay dead in the air). If a couple people died, a unique character named Tommy could come in as one of the dead players spectating only if someone called for Tommy. He was a key character in a way to kill Jason.
---
It was definitely a fun game to play and probably would still be a good competitor to this one if the lawsuit tied to the franchise would not have affected the game. [This is why the devs say there will be no new content.](http://f13game.com/news/end-of-content/) Everyone was so hyped for Jason X after the community as a whole did the little trivia mini-game called “Virtual Cabin” that was like a museum mode going through all of the franchise. [Just watch this to see how hype it was.](https://youtu.be/aRlH5mhbiao) It all went away when the devs announced no more new content.
---
The tiebreaker is cause of death imo. Adiiris died of plague, which sucks but is a fate that befell many of her compatriots and she was able to prepare for death. 
---
Rin saw her mother cut apart and then experienced getting dissected by her father in her own home with the family sword. Lisa was kidnapped and tortured/eaten by cannibals over the course of weeks. Those are both just worse ways to go out imo (and while it's only heavily implied in Rin's story re: her father, I suspect the entity also pushed those cannibals to target Lisa) .
---
Oh I see what you mean. Interesting.
---
That rooftop bug was so bad and I remember being more pissed off by it than people immediately leaving the match when they died or hosts leaving and ending the match.
---
because totems are so difficult to destroy.............
---
tunneling is the fact of focusing your chase on one particular survivor until he dies.
---
There are some perks that help fighting that "strategy" : borrowed time, decisive strike, insta heal
---
Since EGC is a thing you can‘t get hatch-grabbed anymore :p
---
First off sabotaging hooks and insta healing isn't toxic and second you just admitted to camping two survivors so you're in no position to judge how other people play
---
That's some quality roleplaying from the ghostface person
---
The killer is the host of a normal game. But in a kyf, whoever started it is the host.
---
The reason dailies exist is to encourage people to play a certain side and help balance the player pool.
---
Cuz the killer is the host and it hosts you SWF and when he dc's you lose your connection to the server,when dedicated servers will be out this will not be an issue
---
As a Huntress enthusiast, i gotta say that was a helluva decent attempt
---
Wiki page says Trappers symbolizes Jason but it also says Billy symbolizes Leatherface too so there is a hope (I wander what would it’s nickname be tho)
---
Lmao you suck
---
How did you end up on this subreddit
---
Blood Warden
---
Should have been obvious when the entity was blocking the exit before you even got close.
---
You should really try him. He's in my personal opinion easily one of the most fun killers to play. He's also not bad at all, he pretty much as an at will insta kill that can last for another minute at minimum. His add-ons are also cool and varied and can lead to a lot of interesting and fun builds like 0 terror radius, Burger King Myers, or in this case, tombstone Myers.
---
If he was intangible he could kinda work a bit similar to the nurse being able to go through objects but he could only do it if he's invisible.
---
And...?
---
bro totally how relatable
---
Well after 3 years I’m not encouraged to play killer when that day I want to play survivor. It’s just annoying.
---
You’re also at least 4-7 ranks higher than that trapper, your argument proves nothing except that you have no idea how balance works.
---
The BP :/
---
is this going to be the new "tfw you cleanse a totem but it's haunted grounds!!!!"
---
Honestly I wouldn't bother. 99% of survivors that still have mlga installed are the whiniest bitches this community has to offer. Consider it a blessing anytime one of them blocks you.
---
Had a game with a Bubba who facecamped everyone ‘til death, had an argument in the post-game chat where he said he was just doing dailies, and surprisingly one of the facecamped survivors completely supported him, because he was just ‘doing dailies’.
---
Proxy Camping isnt a thing and you can thank rank reset for him being in your Match
---
Nothing seems off about those numbers. If I were to guess, I would say that was not a farming game because none of the survivors are even close to 32k.
---
Why not make the dailies dual?
---
Perform cooperative actions for 180s or Trap 3 Survivors in bear traps.
---
well they all joined at the same time so I checked their profile and they were friends...
---
I had a spirit the other day that slugged me for the entirety of the end game collapse (about 2 or 3 minutes) even though all my teammates had left immediately and she closed hatch. She sat there and nodded. In end game chat I asked her why, and her response was “I annoyed her” I guess she didn’t like getting looped for 5 gens.
---
What exactly is a gen rusher and why do people think it’s bad? I’ve gotten messages that I was “gen rushing.” Like wtf am I supposed to do, play hide and seek for five minutes before I start?
---
The Game is full of pallets dude
---
Maybe it was, i was just saying that it’s nothing official
---
Just don't really think noed is a problem. But yeah, you're right about that. Something I didn't realize about that trapper.
---
They posted it on their twitter specifically, and this is hardly the first clue leaning towards that direction.
---
Nobody's "explaining anything away," people inexplicably like that steaming heap of shit and it will probably be the next chapter. That doesn't mean it suits the game, it doesn't mean we have to like it.
---
Just because something is annoying doesn’t make it toxic
---
As I said, maybe it was deliberate but they also clearly say it’s fan art so it’s hardly official confirmation
---
I hear you, Im. Only rank 11 started 2 weeks ago. I either stomp or get looped and bmd. Had a game last night where every hook was sabo as I walk to it. Frustrating isn't the word. Next game I out on an eboni mori and destroy some bby dwights. I almost felt bad
---
oooh Frank papi muy sexy muy sexy 😘
---
The only work around is playing what you like killer/survivor if your focused on ranking up or just not caring what your rank is
---
Just saying, its been pretty obviously trending in that direction, but a lot of y'all have still been adamantly insisting its not happening at every turn, including this one lol.
---
I've hit a skill cap though I'm not getting anybody better. I'm just trying to enjoy myself too
---
I've considered this one, but you can't progress/learn new stuff if you're stuck on low ranks right?
---
Shes pretty solid, with unique playstyle
---
These guys were calling me a fucking noob with shit perks and laughing at me. 
---
This guy was rank 4 survivor
---
Offerings always dissappear, add-ons always dissappear for the killer and to keep them as survivor you have to escape with them
---
Lmao sure
---
Bill is a character in this game
---
Yeah hit boxes are a mess for both sides xD the absolute worst for me is the doctor, everytime I try to swing with him he seems to miss 80% of the swing on his right and only seems to connect if the survivor is directly in front of him... sometimes xD
---
You can’t progress on rank I’m pretty sure you still get BP right? I don’t have it happen often to me. But yeah you’ll probably learn less stuff
---
https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1160521304656764929 They also posted that last week, so 100% confirmed jojo chapter too.
---
Oh trust me, this sub is pretty killer sided and seem to HATE survivors, saying they would facecamp and mori every claudette or nea players. Thats a LMAO
---
4 man swf is almost always miserable (in my experience) they all know who’s being chased, are 4x more likely to see your location, can co-ordinate perks, items, unhooks and gens. The game really needs to be rebalanced to account for that I think, I totally understand folk wanna play with friends and that’s the whole idea of working as a team to escape the killer.... but on the killer side you need to feel like a hunter, not a bully victim. Idk, maybe adding 20 seconds to gens per partied up surv or give the killer 5% extra move speed etc. 
---
It’s not fun :( likewise, killers who camp and tunnel ruin survivor experiences. The game takes a lot on faith that everyone will behave a certain way
---
BUBBA'S PRETTY DECENT IN LOW RANKS AS LONG AS YOU STACK CHARGE TIME OR MOVEMENT SPEED OR BOTH. EVERYTHING ELSE IS SHIT.
---
Ah ok thanks
---
The problem with The Game is that I lose just by thinking about it
---
This is an amazing idea. I never play killer and I hate getting killer rituals every time. How am I supposed to mori someone when all my killers are level 1-2.
---
Yes, likely. He just sounds mildly annoyed when he gets stunned, and the Clown may laugh, but he is also frowning, a lot. GF straight up is having a blast, and I have a blast playing him. Coincidence? I think not.
---
This is how to make a scary game scary again
---
I hear ya man, it’s almost like the game punishes you for playing. The higher your rank the less likely chance you get if having fun. I actually think Freddy gen teleport should be mandatory for all killers, you chase and hook a survivor and you know 2 gens are gonna pop at the other side of the map.... what can you do? Unless you are Nurse, Billy or Freddy, you’ll never make it to one in time never mind two. Faking a teleport with Fred gives survs a choice, continue and finish the gen, predicting a fakeout, or abandon the gen and risk regression? Way more exciting than: Oh, the clown is 120m away, these 2 gens are free.
---
Maybe I’m too killer focused, does anyone agree?
---
It’s good
---
&gt; when I first got ghostface
---
But you have bloody clothing?
---
&lt;3
---
Wait what?? Doesn’t it?
---
Ghostface can lean on walls to peak around corners, but if someone looks at him with the camera for too long, his current meter that activates upon a completed stalk will empty instantly, losing all it’s progress.
---
Nope. What it affects is how much the killer moves around from you wiggling.
---
Use a top tier killer with top tier perks and top tier add-ons. If you use a middle killer with random perks and add-ons, you'll probably have a bad time against good swf survs.
---
Yeah it's so stupid. Most streamers I come across aren't any more toxic than the average player, and I really enjoy the opportunity to watch the match back from another perspective. I always try to run jumpscare Hag for them to give the viewers some entertainment.
---
LOL I just die and move on.
---
Some survivors are pathetic. Just accept defeat.
---
Damn, I really am the only one that likes to play huntress on lerys or the game map, am I.
---
Just wait for the archives you will have a plenty of stuff to do either side
---
Swf is the cancer of dbd, if they would just get rid of it entirely the game would improve dramatically
---
its funny because every time someone plays on this map the hatch seems to spawn right there, but of course never when i play on it
---
Yes it is, its implying that there will be a stranger things chapter, when its just fan art. Thats the definition of clickbait.
---
I never rage at games usually. I play dark souls and do challenge runs on high difficulties and platinum hunt etc and not a drop of rage.... 2 hours playing killer on DbD gets me so pissed off I have to turn my machine off, I can’t believe anything gaming related could be so frustrating
---
gg ez
---
Tunneling-going after one survivor and not stopping 
---
Slugging-not hooking survivors, just leaving them on the ground
---
Imo removing ability of stabbing to death is a healthy decision. He was a braindead tunneler killer who would get anybody regardless of the skillgap.
---
I'm all for his new form, he just needs to get more benefits out of it.
---
Sadly just a softban
---
The Game tests the survivors ability to route plan. Good survivors will be able to spot or remember pallet spots, and since there is so much safe pallets, this makes the Game shifted in the survivors favor. On the other hand, *subpar* survivors will largely be running into dead space, making the Game shifted in the Killer's favor.
---
That’s basically trapper, uses a machete, has a hockey type mask. Uses bear traps similar to Friday the 13th, so I guess they could give him a unique power but Jason is already owned by whatever people made F13. Meaning behavior would have to either buy rights to the mask (similar to ghost face) or the whole character. But I think trapper is kind of DBD’s version of him anyway
---
Isnt this a repost?
---
It shouldnt be in the game. It looks ridiculous. Whether it works or not, or is easy to counter or not is beside the point. Its just cheesing shitty mechanics and makes the game look janky as fuck. If the devs want survivors to have more evasion options then they should get to work on that.
---
The survivor meta once was stealth. And wraith counters stealth as you cannot know where he comes from. Also, when released his movement speed was not affected that much while uncloaking. But then survivors said that it was too difficult to get a stun on the killer as the killer had to be under the pallet to be stunned, and devs added more pallets and vacuum effects. After that a lot of survivor perks to help in chases like dead hard and balanced landing made him very weak and the nerf to his kit was determining.
---
Nancy is a good choice too cause honestly Jonathan never did shit lmao.
---
Just don't respond, please. Giving toxic players the response only adds to the problem, let them burn themselves out.
---
So not for me. Stealth is the worst thing for me im more like everyone needs to hear it or it didnt happen. Hahahahaha
---
im a nea main because i dont support camping?
---
Or Nancy. Just recently M. Cote and his wife started following the actors who play Steve and Nancy on Twitter. Weird thing is the actress who plays Nancy hasn’t tweeted anything since like 2016.
---
If they just gave it 100% noise reduction it would be fine, plus it gives resilience a fun, niche use
---
I understand your pain, it's super frustrating, but its also super fun at the same time, it's a relationship i've never had with a game before
---
I’m pretty much guaranteed to be put with rank 16-20 survivors. You cant win, no matter how hard you try. They’ll be tunneled dead within 2 mins. God help you if you’re against Myers because they all like to cuddle up to him when he hits tier 3. They all get pulled out of lockers too.
---
Its only when I hit purple ranks I start getting out with decent survivors and thats if im playing solo. At that point I get the most tryhard killer loadouts and moris. Fun.
---
Used to be red ranks last year but at this point ive given up caring. Not sure whats changed but at some point this year you now either get complete noobs on your side or the most unfun killer loadouts. I only play casual swf now.
---
Of course when i play killer its different. Even after rank reset I get lobbies full of survivors with all the meta perks and anywhere from 2k-4.5k hours on the game. All on voice comms with the strongest meta perks that carry them through the game. Funny how these people arent there when im playing survivor.
---
This was/is me. It sucks playing a killer with no perks vs all rank 5+ survivors. I’m lucky if I get one. The skill and perk gap is just so huge.
---
Oh strange. On the level one and 2 version they both say gives 100% more blood points
---
Word on the street is that Remake Jason is up for grabs since it's a different license entirely.
---
I don't know though, I'm not a lia-Lawyer.
---
Claudette spotted
---
well, ye they could do better, but current Moris (except ebony), insta heals, maps (not sure whats broken), DCs will be bannable as soon as the Servers arrive, crashing became alot rarer, true perks like Left Behind need a rework.
---
But the game is pretty "okay" right now
---
That’s 1200 hours right there
---
The game and Lerys are the only two maps with decent totems spawns. The rest of the maps could really be looked at, even new Badham (besides that one bush spot) is super obvious.
---
Oh. Well then. What an awful perk😂  I’ve never used it as I don’t have it but now as killer I don’t have to worry as much when I see it😂
---
Oh shit that's a weird looking screencap. Gg
---
Also, people would confuse Jonathan with Quentin.
---
I'm having flashbacks to F13 the game from this video.
---
Oh yeah! I’ve met some nice Neas, but in my experience the majority seem to be. And for some reason they always seem to be carrying a flashlight...
---
Nowhere does it suggest a chapter though... that’s not clickbait, clickbait is fully it partially lying to an audience for views/ attention. The caption was true and suggested nothing. That’s ur interpretation of it
---
Honestly The Game is my favorite map just because I like Saw. The Pig is actually what got me into this game. I don’t ever really get it though
---
Could we make this image smaller? It's too easy to read.
---
45 seconds with add-on. That's a lot of time
---
I can't watch now but subscribed. Good luck on streaming! I just started myself on twitch and YT.
---
shes lower mid tier. Unless you like the aesthetic of vomiting on people shes surprisingly bad for a killer who puts people in a constant exposed state with a ranged AOE damage ability. But her slowness and los issues coupled with how tall she is and how easy she is to loop if you don't cleanse makes her a bit weaker than a couple of the other killers.
---
Her perks are pretty meh as well. The obession one is pretty garbage and the generator one isn't really as good as other gen slowing perks. And there are better aura reading perks out there.
---
It’s literally the only objective the survivor has, don’t worry about it. From what i can gather as a survivor main, “Gen Rushing” is when a killer focuses too hard on one chase and ignores the other 3 survivors, which in turn lets them bang out gens and wrap the game up quick. ESPECIALLY if the one being chased knows how to loop and stay alive, i can see why it’s something killers complain about. 
---
Not shit talking OP though, it’s an acquired skill as a killer to know when it’s time to give up on a chase and to go protect your gens. I say that because I’m awful as killer and can’t do that myself, hence why I stick to survivor.
---
I actually did a strat like this, I was exposed against a clown and I sat in a corner until my team unhooked a guy and opened the exit gates. I stuck around so if everybody got hooked I could at least try to save somebody.
---
Of course that'll be $1.50
---
the only really good Meg outfit atm is her hiker skin 'cause it makes her a bit more thick
---
It's coming very soon!

 [u/TheKazarka](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheKazarka/) : This is my meme  
---
r/deadbydaylight :  [u/TheKazarka](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheKazarka/) this is the second week in a row that you've shown us this meme in class.
---
I agree. Great escape!
---
Really I got hooked because I’m such a huge horror fan. What other game can you say has Pighead, Ghostface, Leatherface, Krueger and Myers potentially vs Detective Tapp, Laurie Strode, Ash Williams, Bill Overbeck and that irritance Quentin too I guess at Haddonfield, Springwood and The game? :0 it should be so much more fun than it is. Imagine movie Pighead slapping Adam with that blade and wiping it down whilst he teabags, whips out a medkit, revitalises himself, smashes a pallet on the pig and blinds it with his camera flash whilst jumping out his window and getting some crazy speedbost whilst taunting. Ridiculous! Pighead is meticulous in everything it does, from the ambush setup to the ruthlessness in its capture. Mark Hoffman particularly was extremely good at that. I’m so thankful he isn’t in the game to deal with that BS xD
---
I don't mean to come as toxic, but I have played swf and in my opinion it kills the purpose of the game, it takes away the element of horror and isolation, and as a killer it just makes it unfair
---
I don’t see Ash.
---
The artist : [https://twitter.com/DVillefort](https://twitter.com/DVillefort)
---
Why else would you play the killer if not for the power role
---
Not taking into account how fucken weak killers are ofc
---
Yeah, if you watch Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness, the damned book itself actually has a prediction about the coming of "He Who Fell From the Sky", aka the 'Chosen One' to combat the evil of the Necronomicon.
---
Ashley J. Williams happens to be that particular idiot.
---
I honestly had no idea. I'm gonna have to go into a KYF just to look that up.
---
That's fascinating! Thanks for the info.
---
I assume you're joking
---
oh yeah, I basically just run Self Care on every build for my Survivors soon as I get it...because you get THOSE teammates.
---
I'm trying to get the adept survivor achievments and the game keeps putting me (rank 17) in rank 9 - 12 matches and I can rarely escape/pip
---
Bubba = upvote
---
Send me your YT channel. I'll subscribe
---
I can't trust in things like that anymore.
---
Yeah then again anyone who you do respect would also tell you that making fun of someone for their "pizzaface" is childish and petty and makes you a shitter, go ask them.
---
I started reading Dr. Stone recently, love it
---
How you play is up to you, not up to anyone else.
---
If you want to go ahead and re-hook the survivor, go ahead! The survivors deserve the punishment for committing an unsafe hook save. Teach them not to unhook so soon as it will accomplish nothing.
---
On the other hand if you are feeling particularly sympathetic just slug the guy fresh off the hook and chase down the rescuer or ignore the unhooked guy entirely. 
---
It is up to you how you want to deal with it all.
---
You seem really bent out of shape for the pizzaface comment.
---
Object makes you a target. Imagine running it against nurse or spirit. People risk their lives. Killers also have a lot of anti stealth perks like BBQ, would you like to be needed too?
---
**Brain Blast!** (rare survivor perk)-  Any item that has more than 1 base charges may be used as a (worn out/standard/commodious) toolbox when repairing a generator or when sabotaging a hook.  When using a non-toolbox item as a toolbox, consume (0.5/0.35/0.2) charges per second of use.  Only add-ons that increase base charges apply when using non-toolbox items as toolboxes.  “C’mon, think... think!...”
---
Well, there's no excuse for not knowing now. I mean, it was already obvious that if there is a way of outranking someone, people will latch onto it for dear life and bind everyone's worth as a human being to it, but now it's obvious that that's explicitly excacerbating player toxicity here.
---
Yeah it just sways the killer left and right more, if they have iron grasp like most killers do then it almpst cancels out that perk, i wouldn't run it.
---
There is a perk that gives you half of your recovery bar as wiggle, paired with tenacity or maybe unbreakable it might be decent
---
Im not.
---
I love the power role in asymmetrical games and I play it because of the power I have over the other players.
---
The issue in dbd is that, unless you play the handfull of meta killers, you dont have any control. You don't have any power. And that sucks
---
A killers power should be stronger than a simple perk. Object is risky but a total win against stealth killers.
---
Things I cant unsee.
---
The Game is easily one of the best survivor maps unless you're facing Doc/Nurse (and even then it's still doable in many cases). There are tons of safe pallets (There are literally 4 on top of each other with the planning room/bathroom). Always at least 19 pallets total. Easy to find gens (find a closed door to find a gen). It can take the killer forever to get into a room if they are on the wrong floor giving tons of time to get away and the doors are spread far enough apart to get one open as the killer leaves to check the other. Once you learn Gideons it's easy to keep a killer in a chase forever without all too much stress.
---
Usually the survivors don’t want you to tunnel which is going after someone as soon as they get unhooked but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, play how you want, people might get mad at you for it but your objective is to kill the survivors, you can accomplish that however you want to. In high ranks you gotta do some tunneling and slugging which survivors will complain about but you gotta do it to not get bullied every 2 seconds
---
I dont think you should let them get away, even though I know that it sucks for the survivor. Survivors should not go for saves that are so unsafe. Now if you camp the hooked survivor, then its a different thing, because then they have to go for an unsafe unhook. But you wouldn't be asking here if you were camping.
---
I play survivor most of the time, and if I get unhooked directly and then hit again by the killer I dont get mad at the killer. If I get pissed, then its at the survivor, because he goes for an unsafe unhook without borrowed time.
---
Now in the rare occasion that I play killer, I will usually not go for the recently unhooked survivor, because he might have the borrowed time effect or DS, which will fuck me over. Also I like to punish people for doing obviously bad plays.
---
I'm sorry but you are in denial, this IS a teaser of DLC. Fanart by itself doesnt mean anything, but there have been a few teaser clues over the last couple days, coupled with the prior netflix teaser. Plus, today is also they day that they teased the spirit, last year.
---
I would prefer an Alien killer

&gt;loser like Dwight

The mouse shake of fear at 0:04
---
Nah you are allowed to be nice as long as the opponent is cool with it too. For example the killer is allowed to farm with survivors to all get max points if all survivors don’t mind it.
---
I tried OoO and no mither for a laugh once. Didn't last very long
---
Its not a teaser you cant say its a teaser its fan art. You cannot be serious. Its fan art that waa clickbaited on reddit. Calm down kid.
---
how did the endgame start? she didn't close the hatch and no one else was alive to open an exit gate...
---
Beautiful
---
You’re saying calm down but you literally just wrote me an essay to try and prove me wrong...
---
I'll probably take this approach in the future, thanks!
---
What do you play on?
---
Have that "unable to rank up" bug and I'm forever stuck with rank 20s
---
I just think that caring about people is more important than pips. In the end everyone wants to have fun and ruining that fun just for 'pips' seems like a pretty shitty thing to do.
---
Isn’t the whole point of the game is to kill people who cares if you mori a streamer. It doesn’t matter it’s what the game is about.
---
I cant write a calm response? You are wrong and you dont know what the definition of clickbait is.
---
And how do you expect them to fix player toxicity? Taking rank away isn’t going to change that because it’s the players doing it. People have been cultivating toxicity in this community since day 1, and it’s not because of rank. The thing exacerbating toxicity is the overall attitude of the community: the huge victim complex combined with the excessive entitlement. If there was no rank at all, everyone in this community would still act the same because the toxicity stems from playing against each other: survivors think they are entitled to an escape and if they don’t get that it’s because the killer is a toxic asshole; if the killer doesn’t get a 4K it’s the survivors fault because they were a toxic SWF and obviously it could never be either of their faults for the way they played the match. A lot of people in this community don’t seem to play the game for fun, they play it as a way to punish other people for playing, as a way to say they’re better than you, and they don’t do it because of the rank. There’s a mentality of “the other side is a toxic asshole so I have to do everything I can to be toxic back because they deserve it.”
---
It’s a stretch
---
I noticed that too. My friends who're new to the game say the game is their least favorite map
---
I'm assuming that you are new around here? Because this is always how the teasers for new chapters start, and again, this is not the first sign.
---
You think billy is hard? Try Nurse
---
It wouldn't even be a problem if SWFs weren't such horrible people. No, they can't go easy on someone obviously at a disadvantage, they need to WIN.
---
That part I can kind of understand, but then it's that they need to do everything they can to personally harm this person for...being...worse at the game than them? Being another person who exists? I'm not ACTUALLY sure where all of this hate comes from, but I think it's this hallucinated "threat," in that the Killer wants to lower their rank, and their rank is the foundation of their ego, so the Killer must be a personal enemy.
---
Why not get good, and stay away from the high ranks. Rather then boosting your way playing in a unjustifiable way like your rank actually matters for being a shitty player. Just some thoughts. Don't understand how you get pleasure playing shitty for a high rank you don't deserve.
---
You 'automatically win' by having the egc timer expire. Spirit played it wrong.
---
Yeah that'd be great and with a cooldown it could work wonders
---
don’t forget about killers using the strongest add ons and an ebony Mori.
---
Yeah it's almost like Ruin is mandatory and should be an implicit skill at its weakest level rather than consume a perk slot, especially since it's currently possible for there to be no reason to do bones.
---
You deserved the T-Bag. :D
---
Legion's killer instinct no longer works off terror radius since the rework.
---
Hahah...im done, im gonna save this post. If no Stranger thing chapter comes out im messaging you for my delight.
---
I mean, they posted JoJo related fanart recently so say what you will. However other sources of info do point in the direction of a stranger things chapter .
---
It's doing gens normally, but once you start speccing and team coordinating to do gens as quickly as possible, eschewing any other perks you might have, it's gen-rushing. This is usually coupled with having your best looper harass the Killer to avoid any repercussions for having few or no perks oriented towards anything but gen progress.
---
Her though process was "Endgame started = instant win", which screwed her over
---
If they unhook right in front of you hit the person that got off the hook. They get extra points if you don't and it enables the use of some potentially game saving perks. 
---
Fuck their rules,  fuck "being nice" if that's how they want to play theyre the ones screwing them over not you
---
Yeah but for some reason I suck at drawing crosses so I just left it out for now so I don't ruin the piece as it is.
---
I can relate 100
---
Freddy's gen teleport is implicit in Soul at Stake, but Killers...sorry, Devils are all slower than Survivors. Sorry, Gamblers.
---
It's also a skill that any Killer can take in Identity V, but it has a high cooldown.
---
That sucks. I rarely use him but like the idea of him. Hopefully Legion gets a rework like Freddy did, or at least some minor changes that will make him more viable; although, to be fair, I don't know how they could do that while also not making him annoying to play against.
---
Flashlights sucks.
---
That still won’t help him much around loops.
---
Lol if you pause the video at the right moment you can see the hatchet that is already outside of your screen (so you can't really see it) and you didn't even got the hit jet.
---
[ZA WARUDO](/intensifies)
---
I believe so, yes. That said, a friend of mine got Adept Huntress on Lerys, which was nice
---
Okay. For starters i didnt use the word 'play' - i used the word 'abuse'. And in the context of abusing the role of power to annihilate peoples games over shallow reasons (like promoting their channel in their name) dictates that the people doing this is using the role of power as a narrative for their fractured self-depiction. The majority of streamers are no more toxic than the average player, but if a person that isn't satisfied with their general progression in life, or just having a bad day without any outlet - they are prone to take this out on a person who's seemingly more successful - just because they are in the role of power. To disclaim, im not saying this is how killers in general are, but a common (subconsious) ideology for someone that wants everything bad in the world to happen to someone for reasons as arbitrary as trying to promote their own channel.
---
I totally get you, but people screeching at them for SWF is why they implemented it in the first place. There's no going back, and frankly, games should let you play with friends.
---
The problem is that they did nothing to ACCOUNT for the advantages SWFs have. They are just raw better than solos, and the game is still balanced for solos.
---
Yeah and then they are only like rank 18
---
I like original ideas, because BHVR is capable of coming up with beautiful concepts, like Plague. Also, it's painful to have an iconic killer like GhostFace thrown into the trash and forgotten because it's mediocre at best. At least no one cared about Plague when she dissapeared.
---
lmfao this should not be downvoted
---
I love how the detention power that is not even in game it's here
---
DC as in struggled to second phase &amp; instantly let go :)
---
Pretty good job so far...
---
Lobbies always take forever and its even worse at high ranks
---
Welcome to DBD
---
Best advice: Youtube is you're best friend
---
I PROMISE you the rank is a factor. When everyone get a giant number over their heads that says how "good" they are, it's a psychological factor. Just not the only one.
---
But yes, there is also a massive sense of entitlement, and that was a mistake to allow. There are a ton of unfun mechanics which make players feel like they're being punished, often by their opponents. Slugging is toxic because Dying state sucks to be in. Tunnelling is toxic because being eliminated feels awful. Looping is toxic because people don't play Killer to feel powerless over the mediocre movement, and gen-rushing is toxic because it's very easy and the only counter is a DLC character's perk hogging a slot and being destructible.
---
The entire game is a Jenga tower of unfun mechanics, and that makes people angry, and the only people to take out that anger on are the other players. Though I STILL cite the lack of an unranked Quickplay mode as the #1 and most easily fixed issue.
---
What is everyone expecting for an announcement? The PTB for the new chapter should be next week. Release on Sept. 3rd. New Killer, survivor, map, and Dedicated Servers. This is all on the roadmap
---
And that's why ochido gets 10000s of viewers and you can't even convince someone to talk to you for 10 minutes. Either stfu or admit that "yes indeed I'm an asshole but ochido is worse because muh pedo, muh ban evasion blablabla" you can't just brush it off my dude, by your standards you should also be banned from this game.
---
nice escape dude
---
As someone who will still try to work vs prayer beads after 3 DC, I appreciate it.  I just don't want to depip, that much is hugely thanked, and I'll message you after.
---
It sucks when 2 dc after 2 mins and the killer still gets mad thirsty at me, and I get messages back on it occasionally saying ez also.  We are trying to have fun here.  Both sides.
---
I usually just treat ttv players like normal survivors and if they aren't toxic i'll even hop into their stream after the game and say gg and if they're nice i'll give em a follow only time I will treat someone different because of their name is A i recognize them from a previous name and they're assholes or B there name is mori me daddy on something
---
Ah, thanks.  This is 100% the sort of answer I was looking for.  Thanks for clearing that up.
---
You forgot the 4th
---
-Being responsive dicks on Discord
---
Your argument would be strong if this was the main attitude at “good ranks” but it’s not. It’s the attitude at all ranks, and therefore, it isn’t the rank that causes the attitude. I guarantee you people would still act the same exact way if the game was unranked because it’s not about the rank it’s about beating the other person and “giving them what they deserve.”
---
And that’s why I always keep Kindred in my load out. My team mates don’t have to get off the gens if they can see it’s not worth it.
---
Just make his swings each lunge forward. A good player can dash around corners with them.
---
Watch the dichotomous language, we need to understand that this exists on both sides. When i know its a baby killer with my friends i always make sure they get one kill. Ill try to help them with strats as well. Not all swf are toxic, and not all killers are being bullied, etc. Etc. 
---
The reason this is because there are humans behind the game, 4 humans are going to exclude the killer out of the group most of the time. Its a tribe mentality and its just a product of feeling apart of something. Also why most killers complain on forums. Who else is going to listen to them? Anyways youre gonba get mad but dont think everyone is out to get you. There are just way too many variables.
---
If only it wasn't so useless as to be implausible.
---
Depends on if they worked anything out before the lawsuit became what it did
---
Like what?
---
Oh god I didn't think about that. I already have a moral dilemma when I see Kates joining my lobbies.
---
I've had dbd for a few weeks now and I've only played killer, (I played some survivor games but I didn't have fun) as soon as I got to rank 13 every survivor I've found has been way better than before. I haven't got a clue on what to do against borrowed time, ds etc and everyone runs them. I've started playing some more survivor but I cant hit skill checks and I die every game.
---
That means thank you in American... right?
---
Now who's being childish? 10 minutes? You've been at this for an entire day.
---
Ok
---
This isn't correct. Stalk progress remains on survivors until you hit them. You can 99% stalk a survivor and leave them until your power recharges.
---
My issue with the Franklin's solution is that when they are good enough at the game to run at me and taunt and not get downed, I'll smack them with Franklin's and I've had them literally run back at me, pick their item back up and run away again, all before my weapon wiping animation has finished.
---
The Uber Jason still pisses me off, as he was IN the game and they took him out, instead of releasing and fixing later.
---
Plus, they HAD to know about the lawsuit but stayed mum on the topic until it was too late
---
How about you just play the game normally? Is that too much to ask?
---
Or when they literally facecamp and are somehow surprised that 3 gens got done while they were waiting for the hooked person to die
---
No I didn’t. She had franklins and the person who brought the key into the game got hit there and dropped it. I knew where it was because I know where he was hit and where he dropped it
---
I can bet that there is going to be that one killer that complains this is the reason keys are op
---
And if you burn a White Ward (survivor) or Black Ward (killer) offering you keep your item/addons. Assuming you don’t DC.
---
It is real and can be done. I don't do it. I need my bloodpoints
---
I find once you get rid of a few pallets around the stairs its pretty easy to kill everyone on that map.
---
Netflix announced that they were working with bhvr, certain files found that (I can’t remember exactly) were named something related to stranger things,
---
I’ll try and find the post that nicely condensed all the info.
---
When they start saboing hooks, I just start slugging them and leaving them on the ground.
---
pc nurse with noed.. interesting..
---
As Bubba if i see YT...im facecamping with the saw revved
---
Can you tell me a stealth build what perks to use?
---
This would work strange with hills and places like The Game’s stairs tho
---
I agree
---
That’d probably kill the game. I know many people who play SWF, including myself... me and my friends go to DBD for some fun if other games are being less than enjoyable. SWF teams can be strong, but solo survivor can be horrid with randoms or killers who face camp hook
---
Good for sniping
---
LMAO that was ez pz
---
First day of rank reset i got SWF groups who where 'rank 15', clearly rank 1, running loops around me. Gave the game a couple of days, now i (Rank 14 killer) have games with atleast 2 red ranks and 1-2 purples. But yes, tell me how the killer is supposed to have fun in this game when even the matchmaking gives you a hard time.
---
Youre making a meal out of a carrot.
---
Ps4
---
I DUNNO MAN, PLAYING AGAINST HER ISN'T THAT FUN, BUT I'LL TAKE A PLAG GAME OVER A SPIRIT OR NURSE ONE ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. I'VE ALSO FOUND A RITUAL TO GUARANTEE YOUR NEXT MATCH WILL BE AGAINST ONE. ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE YOU BRING AN INSTAHEAL MEDKIT, AND POOF, YOU CAN BET YOUR ASS YOU ARE GONNA BE MATCHED WITH ONE.
---
It could be like for pallets and the random debris or if someone wanted to gen camp.
---
Wow this is the most views I've gotten on any post (granted I've never had anywhere to share it to)
---
If we die in the game, we should did in real life.
---
Survivors are entitled lol. He really thinks he "escaped" when he was let out. I hope this is a shit post. If not then Entity fed off a little more hope.
---
My most wanted feature is a training mode. Not offline bots just like a target range with a few ai maybe doing some basic loops or something so I  could practice a power just a little before diving in.
---
Everybody has suggested Jason in the game lmao, doesn't mean I gotta go in-depth on a moveset for him lol. And like I said he's got a ton of movies, I'm sure there's some shit in there to make him unique.
---
how are you supposed to get 4 new hooks when like 2-3 gens are completed? most are dead on hook at that point
---
Mark this nudity as NSFW
---
People actually getting eeling hurt by randoms on the internet smh
---
Yesbecause then I could throw myself at the killer.
---
Ah I forgot about the 10% thing
---
Nice JoJo reference, take my upvote.
---
damn, you outplayed him like a true Epic Gamer.
---
Bet he cried himself to sleep that night
---
Perhaps. I did play a Hag Queen match, where I'm running all Hexes, and they went around looking for my ruin immediately. I lost Third Seal, and Devour Hope one right after the other, but the Ruin stayed. I ended up taking all of them to basement. NoEd never popped. If I have a bunch of there active hexes, something like HG, it may survive, but purple/red ranks usually start looking for my Ruin as soon as the first skill check confirms it's presence. Then again, anyone who thinks they need a hex to win as Trapper is obviously no Trapper main. Anyone who thinks they need perks period is no Trapper main.
---
he was clearly trolling to get a kill with EGC and trying to be funny, noticed he escaped and immediatly DC'ed
---
YOU PICKED A BAD TIME TO START THE GAME FAM, RANK RESET JUST HIT A FEW DAYS AGO AND YOU AS A RANK 20 WILL OFTEN END UP MATCHED AGAINST AND WITH OTHERS WHO WERE NORMALLY IN THE GREEN RANKS AND GOT RESET BACK INTO THE YELLOW ONES (OR OUTRIGHT STILL ARE IN THE GREEN RANKS, MM IS FUCKING BROKEN AND HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME NOW).
---
NEEDLESS TO SAY, THERE ARE MANY TOXIC FUCKS TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RESET WHO LOAD UP WITH THEIR P3 KILLERS WITH THE MOST OP PERKS PLUS A MORI TO BULLY LOW RANK SURVIVORS SO THEY CAN FEEL BETTER ABOUT THEIR PATHETIC LIVES.
---
ALL IN ALL, AFTER A WEEK OR SO, AS PEOPLE RECLAIM THEIR PREVIOUS RANKS, THE MM IS GONNA BE SOMEWHAT BETTER, AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO AT THE VERY LEAST HAVE A BALANCED MATCH AND PROPERLY SEE WHAT THIS GAME IS ABOUT. WAIT A BIT AND TRY GIVING THE GAME A SHOT THEN BEFORE DECIDING IF YOU WANNA CONTINUE PLAYING OR NOT.
---
Not always the case, months ago they changed the load in to where if your solo random or SWF ifs suppose to lump everyone together first and then load everyone in and it normally does this since I play allot of solo random on PS4 and every now and then you will get 2-3 people that load in then a 4th comes along, but you can go back and check the devs notes on this. They implemented this new loading system when they were ducking around with the match making, it was okay for a little bit but I’m a rank 9 survivor after the reset and kept getting put in rank 18-20 killer lobby’s and the survivors were all rank 15-20 as well
---
Use No Mither with self care and solidarity for real no mither experience.
---
100% nurse
---
iirc dbd only does humanoid killers, cant really do a stranger things chapter
---
I'm so used to sitting low as a hag man an pig minor I started huntress last week and felt the same way
---
Thanks Jaden, very cool!
---
Right, only one killer, so if you divider their attention, they spend more time moving around than in chase. On small maps good patrolling killers could be op vs non swf. If you know where 3 gens are that are in close proximity, you can progress them by small amounts, eventually edging out killers to finish one, even if they are coming around and kicking them. It would work better for killers with average terror or bigger.
---
Entering the game with Bubba kills you instantly, as soon as it loads you just drop dead.
---
I thought you were lesbian?
---
I now want a JoJo's chapter.
---
Id definitely say Huntress
---
god i hope not, hopefully they have original content planned for chapter 13

Taste the salt. Git gud. Stop complaining about game dynamics. It’s called ‘altruism.’ I play both and that’s hardly a problem. You just have low game IQ. 🕺🏻

Ban evasion, sexual conduct with underage girls, witch hunting, glitching, holding games hostage, modding....like, he deserves to be hated and he brought it upon himself. People like you just can't see it and refuse to be nothing more than a simple sheep.

I'm gonna move along though. I can only take so much stupid in one day. Goodluck.
---
They've been sharing fan art like this on their twitter for a bit now so this could just be another example of that. However, [Netflix DID tag BHVR in their "upcoming projects" twitter thread back during E3](https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1138903234356006912) so.... we'll see.
---
The demogorgon is humanoid but not human. They couldn't definitely do it. People seem to not understand that difference between human and humanoid.
---
Popular?  FT13 really?
---
a very good and very **powerful** video
---
like I said if they were to put stranger things into the game I can see a few characters but that's just maybe I just think the creator like the show and that's it nothing else really
---
I had a toxic huntress one match I ran her 3 mins escaped her multiple  times. Saved a few people and noone did gens so I started those as she killed and camped everyone I was left she downed me and chucked hatchets  at my slug. Went got more and picked me up. I had flip flop and broke free went gate but she got me . As I accepted my fate she put me down let me open the gates, just to down me and walk back and forth between hook and gate till she hooked me.
---
I didnt send a message so in like 30 mins I got a message saying. Get owned scrub, and I replied who is this? They went into detail about being. High level huntress.  I didn't reply again lol. They saw I played apex, and sent me a friend request.  Legend has it, its still in my pendings to this day.
---
Most of the time I forget to check ping and that definitely doesn't work out for me lol
---
Iri head huntress
---
And Jason is in a special spot where the devs likely won't implement him to avoid getting involved with that lawsuit that's happening. People that suggest things without giving some kind of explanation on how or why it would work don't really help things get done. Sort of like suggesting that doctors find a cure to cancer without giving some kind of explanation on how they should go about it. Yeah we already know it'd be nice, what we want to know is how. Like you said, a lot of people have already suggested it so not really interested in hearing another person suggest it without explaining how they'd be implemented. And it sounds like you haven't even seen the movies so are you genuinely sure there is something in there? While commercially successful, many of the movies have been received negatively from the critics which suggests there might not be anything interesting to pull from the movies that goes beyond "hit things till it dies".
---
those dedicated servers should help

EVERYTHINGS DECENT IN LOW RANKS, THATS WHY ITS LOW RANKS
---
"Nea, get him out of here"
---
buddy, is it possible that you are mistaking sucking ass at the game with killers being underpowered? Thought so :/ feelsbadman
---
Maybe it’s time to git gud :D
---
Nowhere in the rules does it say to chase the harasser. If you gen patrol with that harasser not doing a gen and get someone off a gen into a chase, that’s 2 people confirmed not doing gens.
---
Definitely nurse imo. Most people playing on console have decent aim already, so huntress probably doesn't suffer too much. Nurse is the same thing but harder so naturally I feel like it'd be harder for nurse.
---
I see no difference
---
The Tombstone he has on doesn't take you out of EW3 after the kill, that's the purple Tombstone Piece. Also, Tombstone slows you down the whole game, not just in EW3, so there's not any reason to delay popping it except for maybe survivors playing a bit riskier without it being popped. Fragrant Tuft keeps EW3 up all game once you get it.
---
Just ungratefull survivor mains here... moving on
---
Chancletas are literally the exact same
---
Stalking erection probing you with his extremely long lunge
---
I hate to be that guy but NOED on nurse... Maybe it would be a different story if it was console but on PC I just don’t understand.
---
That’s me
---
Well I didnt create this picture. I found it on google. But your right on that.
---
Get nae nae’d
---
Why is this every game I play
---
Leary’s is a terrible map in general. Hands down
---
This need for condescencion is what is ruid
---
Typical.
---
Ghost Face's the best mori, followed by the Hag's.
---
Its just fan art will you people chill out
---
oh yeah I saw that..
---
but still dont see much I just wait until the devs say something but I never get my hopes up with BHVR
---
I run these two with DS and bond/adrenaline nearly every game. The versatility you get with virtually every map is great and you don’t have to worry about using one over the other because the other existing at all can catch killers off guard. Like if you use BL in one chase then DH in the other they will be very confused on what you’re going to try to use next. Plus BL is passively good while exhausted so it just works. And imo there’s not enough super good surv perks you’re missing out on so you may as well just build to be super good in chases.
---
Ghostface and Myers do kind of disagree; or redhead pinky Clown
---
I, a rank 17, bing bong main got a rank 7 Bill. At least I killed him, tho (and a random Laurie trying to use OoO)
---
I stand behind what I said.
---
I play Survivor and Killer equally, both at rank 1 (if that matters at all)
---
Survivor is literally easy mode. If you are an M1 Killer, the game is in complete control of the Survivors. Most hits/kills you get are due to their mistake rather than your skill. You really can't do much.
---
Sure there are mindgames and all that, but a good Survivor with good perks and game sense will always be 2 steps ahead
---
Claudette = Will, 
---
(You know why)
---
I'm mostly just surprised Ojomo decided to keep killing.
---
Also I'm sad we don't get Quentin in a lot of fan art.
---
The faded dc symbol had me rolling but for me personally whenever I see lerys I groan because it’s a bad map for both sides (unless you play ghost face ig)
---
Remove Pig too because it kills me a little bit everytime I drop a pallet on her and she squeals.
---
Umm sweaty... let me tell you buddy... maybe get good? Haha fella you silly goose :)
---
For real how long are we gonna pretend this game is balanced?
---
It's really fun and all that, but it's really an unbalanced mess
---
Yes, many times can a survivor win. 
---
If they were looking for the hatch, they will likely die. If they were hiding by a gate waiting for the killer to close the hatch, they can get out. At that point, it is a 70% chance they get out. If the killer checks the other gate first, they can likely get out. If they check your gate, it will be close and depends on the killer’s speed.
---
All these killer mains out here getting butt hurt lmao. The killer obviously dced after messing up the endgame collapse kill
---
I even got these moonshine Offerings, so würde ja my Discount?
---
No. Absolutely do not let them go. The only way they’ll learn from their mistakes is if you punish them. The one and only rule as a killer: don’t let the bullshit survivor handbook get in the way of your kills, if Captain HookBomber wants to farm the absolute shit out of his teammates and expects you to respect the “boohoo no tunneling” rule, show him how wrong he really is
---
That's not how that meme template works...
---
I like the idea and visually the power sounds cool but mechanically it’s just a better version of Trapper. With BHVR already recycling powers with Ghostface and the Freddy rework I think we need something new.
---
Also, the last two survivor perks don’t make sense. You can only gain four tokens at tier three but you need four for the perks to have any use. So as of now they’re useless at tiers one and two.
---
I can see you put a lot of work into this. Just needs some tweaks but good job overall.
---
This is the 3rd post about this I have seen within the past hour, specifically for ps4. I play on ps4 but I'm at work right now. I HOPE it all works well when I get home haha
---
Jason has a tragic backstory as is so bhvr could easily slip him in to the lore. In the movies he’s known for teleporting (never actually confirmed in the movies but heavily implied) , bear traps, spears, throwing knives, strangling, and many other things. I’m sure it wouldn’t be that hard to come up with an ability for him. They could even implement his mother into his ability somehow by her whispering to Jason, thus revealing a survivors aurora that’s far away ( I have no idea if this will be balanced I just think it sounds cool). Really the only thing to worry about is bhvr convincing the F13 copy right holders
---
Happens to me all the time. It didn't use to be this god awful before. 
---
I convinced my friends to buy it and we barely play cause we have to wait way too fucking long.
---
To be fair it was clown. Everyone else got out so he was trying to be a little cheeky which ended up with him ripping his ethernet cord out of his wall.
---
It was kind of a Hag/Trapper combo except that he can't teleport to the Flower Beds.
---
I've been in the situation of being the last living survivor plenty of times, and it depends on how you play it imo. Once I was the last one left and already injured, so I was not chancing looking for the hatch. I sat and waited next to a door and as soon as the killer shut the hatch I rushed the door and got out. I wasn't proud of the move but I was the only one of a 4 person swf to escape
---
((map was the meat plant if that makes any difference))
---
Hold up, it's been awhile since I played but isn't your number higher than the others? I mean higher levels is good right? Or is the leveling system weird

yeah its actually not that hard to get out with a little trick that not alot of people know about. you wait for the killer to check your door, then go out and power the door until right before the first light turns on, then hide again. then when the killer leaves after checking again and not seeing a light, you go for the full open. I've used this alot and it works 9/10 times, even if the gates are open
---
It could just be some cosmetics.
---
Lol he tried to hit me all game with them and missed. I play huntress alot so soon as I hear her load up. I get to the trees lol
---
Found the toxic survivor
---
He got tunneled and camped
---
This is incredible! You should do Meg and Nea too!
---
I second this but instead because the pig is scary. She creeps me out.
---
I tend to get like rank 10s when I have a level 1 rank 20 killer
---
you're lucky. I'm rank 12 and I get queued with rank 20s every game. At least you get good survivors
---
good idea
---
I mean, they always do teasers for the upcoming chapters, and the ptb should be hitting in 10 days... So have you seen any other indications of the upcoming chapter?
---
She was actually buffed in the most recent patch. The only real nerf I've heard about is her RBTs not working if they are placed on a survivor after the last gen is finished.
---
Is it? I've never seen this before, but I guess great minds think alike /s
---
Yea, if you have three to work on though, he can't efficiently cover all of them and you are likely get one done while entirely tying him up in the process with the work of just one or 2 survivors. It would require good placement and be tougher against the stealth/trap killers but when it does work it could work great and win the game if other survivors aren't hiding in the mean time. Conditional, sure but all perks are.
---
If this happens then we need to get a free topless david king although tbf I would probably be too distracted to play looking at them both.
---
It depends on the door spawns. If they're on intersecting walls that can allow the killer to stand between them you're dead. If they're opposite from each other then your only hope is to either already be at a door when they close the hatch and hope they guess wrong, or partially open a door without turning the first red light on and wait for them to come check and then finish it when they leave.
---
Ahh yes killer sided memes are soo much funnier.
---
I find it hard to earn points with iri heads as I either get a full team of dc’s or a 4K with minimal bp.
---
I’m obviously doing something wrong because I’ve seen streamers knock out 27-32k point games using iri but I just don’t have the hours.
---
Sounds like you're being a baby.  
---
You're getting oddly defensive over someone else being honest and saying, "Guys, this put me down."  
---
That kind of abuse is on the extreme end and honestly it would bother me too. But why are you bothered that other people are bothered? Are you one of the toxic survivors?
---
He meant the quality of this video
---
That scared tf out of me. My cat jumped mostly cause I yelled but that still counts.
---
Lmao wut
---
They're even on this subreddit :/
---
Dont know what you re trying to say but YES not fair AT ALL :)
---
Nah they’re toxic dude, your fine. Even if you did camp, it’s still part of the game.
---
All running self care and no mither. Best build in the game my friend
---
yeah i de ranked after that shit though and they didn’t attempt to save me off hook at all, just t-bagged in a corner
---
And with Monitor and Abuse.
---
A good survivor team can survive against a bad Jason for a long time and most will escape, bad survivor team will get wiped by a bad Jason in like 8 minutes. And bad survivor team will get wiped by a good Jason in 3 minutes. A good Jason and a good survivor team will still be wipe in about 5 minutes. Apparently Jason is balanced tho, so said the devs.
---
No. You didn't read. I said very clearly:
---
&gt; Have a killer perk where you can break a fully repaired gen.
---
Please learn to read before you comment.
---
It's Cracked Mirror (I think that's what it's called), it causes Myers to be unable to leave tier 1, but it allows you to see survivors' auras within a certain distance when stalking.
---
I will never understand why people call LF bad.
---
He is a 4.6 speed killer with insta-down, at worst he is a better Doctor/Pig/Wraith/Trapper during chase and at best he can get you just like Billy.
---
He is a below average killer but by no means bad, just so happens that people who play LF over Billy tend to be bad which reinforces the notion that LF himself is bad.
---
\&gt;PewDiePie played it once
---
# WHAT?
---
Scratched Mirror. It makes it so Myers can’t level up past Evil Within 1- however, when he holds M2, he sees the auras of survivors within a 32 meter range.
---
Too scared to not use an alt account though huh?
---
There's definitely a lot of toxic players in this game, it's not just you
---
Survivors can be real shitbags. Even when I play fair as the killer they blast my inbox saying I camp tunnel etc. Had one dude struggle on the hook and kill himself in the first 2 minutes of the game then called me a camper even though I moved away from him because I saw another survivor nearby and started chasing them.
---
o rly hue hue hue...
---
That’s my favorite thing when playing as the trapper
---
I’ve been killed by so many good Billies on Lery’s.
---
No way with the Insta-open. That is way too powerful and would be abused easily. 
---
It is still possible to escape against spirit. She has a cool down on her power and is a 110 killer. It is 40/60 chance with her is she checks your gate first. 
---
Billy is a bit harder depending on the map. If it is an open map, you are likely dead. If it has obstructions, you can get out. That is more of a 30/70 to get out
---
Nurse is nurse and breaks the game anyway. If you made it as the last one against Nurse and she didn’t slug, you are lucky to have a small chance of getting out. You need to be AT the gate switch as soon as she closes the gate and hope that she checks the other gate first. And the gates need to be far enough away from each other. You got about a 10/90 chance of escaping. 
---
With any other killer, it can be either 60/40 with you getting out or 50/50 depending on what gate they check first. That depends on the map itself and how far the gates spawned from the hatch.
---
monster in DBD ok ima try to imagine this
---
The rank 7 is definitely the Nea.
---
https://i.imgur.com/utugNoT.jpg
---
Yeah lol, he played killer
---
Gotta agree with you on this one. Teabag in this game and people will wish eternal damnation on you. Everyday see the same posts about people complaining about the same things, gets really boring.
---
Not free. They would have to add an animation where you see the money raining down when you buy them.
---
Yeah, I was basically done with F13 when they made it so Jason can't even get stunned after the first few minutes of the game
---
After two minutes Dwight finally come out of the locker.
---
you know I would downvote for the sideways photo but I think it kinda grows on me
---
yeah I’m pretty sure the next chapter is Stranger Things
---
This has to do nothing with rank reset.
---
Not really. Purpose of the killer is to, well kill. It would just be the equivalent of playing mortal kombat and telling someone to uninstall it cause they performed a fatality. Tunneling generally refers to a survivor getting focused by the killer, so I generally separate tunneling into two sections like I would a try hard. Much like a good try hard who's just trying to win and will do so by being a team player, a good tunneler will make good calls by focusing on either, 1) the wounded player that will go down in one hit as opposed to a healthy one that will take two to go down, or 2) the ones that can't loop as well as the one that's trying to get you to tunnel him, since normally the ones that can't loop you as well will try to focus on gens, and this will either force them to try to save the teammate, or work as a 3 man team. Then much like there being bad tryhards, who rage at teammates in chat and belittle them, the bad tunneler would be the guy that does it just to troll, face camping them, even though this means that gens are getting done, tbagging if they are pig and calling new players slurs after the match is over, generally scaring them off.
---
Here are a few videos with tips.

Some people like Arditha review gameplay videos his viewers sent him.

You're a bad killer then. 80% of killers can't stop looping. Either mindgame pallets that allow for it and/or disrespect pallets. Survivors won't drop pallets against Bubba, so just charge or use M1 depending on the pallet. You have to be in the right spot to charge and so has to be the survivor.
---
imo 5 blink is actually really bad.
---
Amanda is far too short to be peppa pig
---
Those other guys aren't any better
---
Even though it's a body I still feel Feng is really cute.
---
Does plague have a 1 hit add on or you mean with the corrupt purge? I don't have her yet and it seems she's not that popular, I think I have only played her twice in a couple hundred matches so not too familiar. And there is no splinter for her ☹
---
I camp when i feel like it's the best option. 
---
If gens are going so fast i don't think i can get a down before end game i'll camp.
---
If its end game i'll camp because i have no other objective to defend going from door to door allowing saves isn't a good tactic.
---
If survivors instantly rush for saves i'll camp because they're obviously not going to be at the gens they run to unhook every time. Farmers basically 
---
I don't just get a down and camp for no reason i assess the situation and try to predict the right move to make based on the survivors i'm up against.
---
Notice how at rank reset you'll tend to get camped a lot more? Its because of farmers/rushing hooks without thinking. Survivors fall for it constantly on reset so its usually an easy bait tactic.
---
She's WHAT
---
I put it sideways to show my MADNESS
---
if your looping around a certain object stick close to it as possible you dont wanna just run in circles and be out in the open giving the killer a easy lunge plus some killer respect pallets and you dont have to drop as fast to test this it can kinda be difficult because if the killer doesnt respect them they will usually hit u no matter how close the are to it beacuse there not scared to get stunned and one other thing if you drop the pallet and the killer doesnt break it and you guy going around it be prepared to shoot to a completely different direction the moment you see them breaking it in order to loop again but it's best to look at videos and acourse practice this
---
lol. Why does anyone need to stop being human? I'd be pretty annoyed if a bunch of toxic gamers were excessively insulting me both in the game and on steam.
---
He wrote in the endgame screen, that he likes camping toxic pieces of shit.
---
I'll finish it totally in 3 or 4 days
---
I don't get it :(
---
Thats how she got 19,000 points right? 
---
I feel like you lying dude.
---
r/madlads
---
Paulie is the youtuber he was talking about right? What's his channel name?
---
Its taking long as killer on ps4? Thats odd.
---
No not pass 100 so they falten out the bp part then and tr part scales
---
20 seconds is a HUGE amount of time in this game. People complain about 5 seconds from the DS stun. They changed Enduring because a 2 second difference mattered. 
---
You are basically asking for a perk that 99% gates.  This would guarantee escapes against killers at endgame. No perk should guarantee a win, for killers or survivors. 
---
If this were ever implemented, it would need to be an new item like a Key or an ultra rare key addon. It is way too powerful for every match use.
---
THE BREATHING INTENSIFIES!!
---
I actually can belive people are saying this is the beat option like what in my opinion there should only be one reason to camp and that's when the gates unlock and and theres a person on the hook your not trying to beat time anymore at that points tour just trying to reel In a last minute kill as well as trying to secure it
---
Her puke fills a gauge on the survivors, either by continuous puke or a it fills automatically once touching/interacting with something infected. Once its filled, they are wounded and broken so they are always one hit til they cleanse. If they cleanse you basically get Huntress hatchets from fountain. She isnt popular because you wont pip, she gets less scoresince survivors will only need 1 hit.
---
gotcha lol
---
Because the 20 made the lobby and invited their friends.
---
It goes by the first person to send an invites rank.
---
nice, more oversaturated content.
---
It's definitely not a solid perk. If everyone brings a toolbox and 1-2 people use prove thyself, gates should be open within 4 minutes. Self care is a massive waste of time.
---
This build is op AF,
---
Then you chase that survivor, that's it...
---
Ffs having emotions doesn't make you a "total pussy".
---
Something like this happened to me, I was on that map and I was running the killer around since two teammates were dead and one was in struggle, and I was looking for hatch so I 360’d, got in the school, threw the pallet to make time and went downstairs, I assumed it was there but it wasn’t, I got hit and then ran back upstairs, when I got out of the school on that map I saw the hatch next to the car, but the guy was still struggling and I got hit again, I got knocked but she was just gonna watch me die, she assumed since I was a meg that I didn’t have unbreakable, I 99’d the recover until the hatch opened and didn’t go near it cause if I did he would just close it, when the hatch spawned I recovered and went yeet with sprint burst, got double peep :)
---
In long distance chase yes but short distance loops cant be used against it
---
While the one on the hook isn't dying because you're chasing the second survivor in a proximity.
---
Basically this. 
---
Camping can be a good strategy if the killers sees survivors as overly altruistic. Also, is they see a really skilled survivor, they may “soft” camp  in the area at least to get them down an additional hook into struggle. 
---
The issue is that it is not fun for the survivor on the hook or the other survivors who are just holding M1 on a gen. It’s boring. 
---
That is the reason I usually run Make Your Choice. It makes me not camp or want to go after the unhooked survivor.
---
Thankfully there are 700 of them. Just do gens and as long as someone on the team is sort of okay at looping it's an easy game.
---
since your other comment disappeared i’m gonna comment on this one again. if meg was malnourished why wouldn’t they also be? they’re all in the same realm which is the entity so it would be obvious that not only one person would be starving. calling me names because you made a shit argument won’t do you any good
---
And here we have the problem with survivor expectations. How often do you see a horror movie where most of the characters survive? Never. Unheard of. No one wants that movie. It would defeat it's purpose. Yet the moment playing survivors is hard, the players consider the game bad, never mind that it's a horror sim. 
---
Granted I don't play F13 fire other reasons, but this is the mentality that hurts DbD and results in most killers being crap.
---
If you are "looking around" right next to the hook for a full 2 minutes that's what i call camping.
---
never used it I find it pointless it's just instant kill for the obsession which I have no use for
---
Where??!
---
It's real bad. There are tons of open areas and you'll almost never get a second hit.
---
Most other killers at least get a power that can’t backfire as badly as tantrumcsn if you hit a wall or something. Hillbilly is also an m1 killer in a lot of circumstances but at least his power lets you traverse the map. 
---
Survivors drop pallets on bubba all the time? Even if he’s revving his chainsaw trading a instant down for a pallet is still not a terrible deal. You may as well play myers if you want to m1 at least he gets that extra lunge range to help.
---
So because its possible people just shouldn't play the way they want? Killers should just allow free saves?

If you make that change, it is even moreso stacked vs the killer
---
I think they could make his ability one that'd cause loops to be affected, something like the ability to destroy walls on tile loops by walking through them? It'd factor in Jason's sheer strength and it'd certainly shake up the use of infinites and looping while still making windows and palettes fairly useful.
---
The bottom floor is dark enough to lose her in the middle of the screen.
---
I’m 99% sure the rank 20 wasn’t premade with them because he joined later then other 3
---
even thoe I'm a killer main I agree with this only beacuse I became a killer main due to these problem as well as lag switching and bad teammates I just deal with so much less a skillet but being a survivor in this game is pain in the ass
---
No artard. 4 FRESH hooks I.E. they weren't hooked before. Meaning that, to break this down as simple as possible for your lizard brain, if you hook each of the 4 (count them, FOUR) survivors ONE time a piece then you get access to this ONE-TIME-USE ability. Is that clear enough for you? Did I break it down simply enough for your lizard brain? Because if you still don't understand then we're either speaking two different languages or you need a helper to explain to you.
---
because people don't know the difference between camping hooks and monitoring hooks. camping is when you don't go farther than like 20 feet during the hook. I've literally hooked someone, turned around to leave, seen someone run out of a closet to go unhook RIGHT INFRONT OF ME, knocked and hooked him, and then got accused of camping because this moron decided to run out of closet right infront of me...like am I supposed to just sit there and let him unhook?
---
I’ll be coming back as piggie today towards the days end. I’ll be around in normal clothes before but thats not as cool
---
Valid criticism and good, well-thought-out suggestions for fixes. Hope the devs listen.
---
It literally only one survivor gets instant down and mori
---
I understand that totally! And I agree that the end chat can be great sometimes\^\^
---
ok then  in this case it might just been the matchmaking going crazy as always but still that is a large gap In ranks regardless
---
Those are all reasonable. But if someone has borrowed time and rescues someone right off the hook while you are still there would you still do it?
---
And that makes it fair? And it isnt just one person. You can kill multiple if you use GF's new perk.
---
it would be easy to fix but ppl say it can be abused when really it cant if they make it so if a survivor is close the timer starts as normal and after the final gen is done the timer will go down as normal even if the killer is camping
---
Because trashtalk is actually fun to me believe it or not. Ever seen a rapbattle and how they talk shit about each other? It's entertaining, The saltier and angrier people are the more entertaining it is. But we can't do it anymore because people like OP are pretending that "kys" actually hurt them while the painful truth usually is that what hurt them was getting shit on in a videogame nothing more nothing less.
---
It's just this shitty new generation of people wanting to control which words everyone is allowed to use while themselves being totally shitty people who are just as mean and cunty but they won't say the no-no words so it's okay.
---
Uhh, every single horror movie usually has survivors? It’s been a while since I’ve seen an A-List horror movie not have people that survive and banish/kill/otherwise expunge the monster or killer. And wanting the game it be balanced and not have the killers totally ridiculously OP just because they’re “the killer.” Is like wanting to play cops and robber except the robbers have literally no ways to defend themselves, and the cops are all robo cop. It’s a competitive game that was splashed with horror aspects for flavor and as inspiration, it isn’t a true horror game, not in play or strength, or everyone would just queue as killer and we’d never get survivors unless it’s the truly masochistic. I think your mentality is the flawed one tbh.
---
easy fix if the survivor is close timer goes down as normal
---
GF?
---
agreed
---
I used to do that, but most of the time they aren't worth it and its a waste of a mori. But it is still funny when I get a mori daily and load one up before I start match making and they assume I brought it for them anyway. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
EVERY SINGLE TIME. It drives me *so* crazy.
---
Enduring is such a nice perk to throw as a 4th wild card perk. Once i had a looping injured adhd Nea jump to my lap after she slammed a pallet at me. She thought that i was down for the count :D slap -&gt; hook
---
Where’s ash when you need em
---
Yes it does.
---
Prove it
---
Dudes gotta grow up and stop whining someday. Yeah, it sucks to get stomped by a good survivor team, just like it sucks to get stomped by a good killer, the massive rift between the two sides of the fan base, despite their issues being pretty much identical, has always confused me, why can’t we all get along and bitch about things that matter together?
---
Almost had them
---
What do you mean "more so"?
---
I go into games at rank 9 with ONE PERK and 4 man. This game is embarassingly easy for killers.
---
Faster base speed, blood lust, one shot abilities, moris, survivors have limited resources, BBQ, NOED, ruin, shitty hit boxes, lag that favors the killer because of how connections run, survivors make hella noise unless you run perks to counter that.
---
What do survivors get? Flashlights and evasion perks that may get countered by LAG. Which comes FROM THE KILLER.
---
If you camp you're literally begging the other 3 survivors for be on gens and rush you to oblivion.  Campers bring that on themselves by camping instead of applying map pressure.

Nope, because BHVR handled the transition poorly. They explicitly stated the ban system won't do anything to them until dedicated servers come out.
---
A more competent developer would atleast lie about banning people without actually doing it to scare people off d/cing. No reason not to lie. They've basically admitted the game is a lawless every-man-for-himself land.
---
I’m pretty sure temp bans are coming with dedicated servers
---
Disappointing? A girl that has muscles AS BIG AS MY FACE is disgusting
---
If the survivor is being an asshole and it does hurt you as a killer I do understand killers camping but your opinion as well. They won't be able to get at least one person if they leave the hook.
---
I.... Said unless he's in chase....?
---
Imagine thinking killers have the power role in the game
---
Pgtw works on all hooks not just fresh ones
---
Something about getting better at the game.
---
“Helps to have a map!”
---
I think they said once the dedicated servers come out they'll have penalties for people who DC because it'll be easier to determine that it was a rage quit and not a connection issue
---
Look at the names here. Im not the guy saying killers are weak. Im the guy saying people that tunneler streamers because they are streamers should find something better to do.

Also, this:

What are these survivor dailies you speak of?  As a survivor main I only get like one...once every 2-3 weeks.
---
At endgame with furtive chase you will kill your obsession so that’s why it doesn’t make sense the only thing that rancor can work is like you said DS.
---
He pulled a quick one on you
---
It’s a hex perk, that’s like saying third seal is OP because you’re blind for the rest of the game.
---
I'm a 50/50 killer/surv player btw amd IM JUST MAKING JOKES. I'm not agry or frustrated, and I totally agree with you: it's stupid to get mad at a game, but this community seems full of people like this ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Nice find. Don’t think that can be a coincidence.
---
Then it greatly increases the odds that survivors would be away from the hook
---
The only question at this point is if PTB is this Tuesday or next.
---
Lery's a bad map for survivors? Wot
---
Ok so enough puke touching and they're one hit. I hope whenever they do bloodpoints/scoring events rework they make more killers viable in that sense. I wanna get her cuz she seems fun but I already got legion, cannibal Spirit clown, pig and Michael in que for their teachable perks plus Freddy for the gameplay
---
You see that now though. I doubt it would increase more for that
---
Nah you can combine any two exhaustion perks other than Sprint Burst.  I've used Balanced DH, Balanced Lithe, Lithe DH, DH Head On, etc....
---
Noice.
---
Thing is, the only power he's ever had was regeneration, making him invincible. But that's moot because all killers are invincible here. But maybe ice could great his mother's voice encouraging him, building his rage and letting him Insta grab survivors eventually.
---
I'm so excited!
---
Amen. And the neanderthal face she's still got. All of the survivors should get a tiny model update. Start with the first ones, especially Meg. Her running animation, good point, and then her god damn face.
---
I know that can be frustrating, but you kinda just have to deal with it. I don't know about PC with a keyboard, but with a gamepad those actions (self-caring/healing others/pallet interaction) will always share the same mapping. You can mitigate the issue by being aware of where your camera is pointing. If you're looking away from the pallet then in most cases the game will prioritize self-caring over pallet interaction. Also just take a second to look at the button prompt as it'll tell you exactly what you're going to do if you press your action key.
---
It’s def good for hiding but not the greatest for looping/finding pallets, with the exception of a few disgusting loops (basically infinites) that can spawn and ruin the killers day if the survivors can use them correctly
---
I understand why people get mad, it’s just something that comes with the competitive nature of the game, but some people take the salt so personally, that it fuses with them on a molecular level, causing shit like our friend here, who throws a toaster in his bathtub Everytime he sees a meme about a killer. If everyone came together, acknowledged the actual issues we need to deal with, and worked help the devs find solutions, this could easily be one of the best games out there, but “boo hoo meme bad” is more important
---
You must have a huge face then. Because that is mostly toned arms, not HUGE muscles. But hey, what would a PC sitting whimp know about that, right? Go out for once and exercise a little. But first grow up.
---
Nurse is actually a lot easier than Billy. The hard part is mindgames and immersion, but the walls and windows that dominate Lery's are...well...nothing at all to the Nurse. It's just the player that controls the odds there.
---
&gt; survivors can just hit Great skillchecks to make it completely useless
---
This is a common mistake people make which is completely wrong.
---
* No survivors hit great skill checks 100% of the time, even the best survivors make mistakes. On average a team will miss probably 50%+ of the great ones.
---
* Even in a fantasy world where every survivors never miss anything, a great skill check is normally a 2% progression. So that's still not "nothing".
---
&gt; they can just brute force it by having 2 or more survivors on a gen.
---
Actually ruins's effect is increased the more survivors there is on the gen. More survivors = more progression paused more often. With 4 survivors on it i'd say its almost impossible to get any progress going.
---
&gt; For example: survivors 9 times out of 10 find the totem in under a minute in the match
---
If you play it right, it usually can last at least 2 minutes. And keep in mind "2 minutes" is more significant than you think. The first 2 minutes is the main part of the game where every survivors are hard working on a gen with full concentration. Once the game gets going, there is usually 1 survivor on a hook/healing, 1 survivor getting chased, 1 survivor hiding, etc. Ruins slows down the progression massively at the most crucial time of the game.
---
&gt; Personally, I feel Corrupt Intervention + Pop does more.
---
I mean, what does more, those 2 combined or ruins... its close. But 2 perks vs 1...
---
if you dont know the source then why you posting it?
---
One game I just sat in the corner by the exit gate when one gen was left to get out asap, but the killer got me when the gate was halfway open.
---
The menu theme better be a synthwave remix

You should consider the following:

2. Look at real female athletes outside.

Yeah, it reads like it's a better perk than it really is.  I'd say it's easily Kate's worst perk.

*Gets let go by killer and crawls out.  What an INSANE PLAY THAT SURVIVOR MADE!  HOLY SHIT THE OUTPLAYS......
---
I don't know what you're talking about. Between this and the Stranger Things influenced art posted by Behavior. All of this is just clickbait and in no way shape or form means Stranger Things characters are coming to DBD. 
---
(By the way, I'm making fun of the people in denial about all these OBVIOUS clues)
---
New Perk:  Occupado:  Begin the trial with 3/5/7 tokens.  Whenever you are hiding in a locker and the Killer opens your locker, lose a token and close the locker without being grabbed.
---
ive done this method but whenever I go try to turn it in, I stay there in hopes to get it all done but killer always comes back in time
---
great work but they shoulda swap jimmies mom with cindy, since she has pig tails and so does meg
---
Not anymore: Furtive chase only changes the obsession if they're rescued from a hook. Once you Mori someone with Rancor, they can't be rescued from the hook anymore, so you can't get any more than one kill with it.
---
Looool this cute, I love it when guys/girls are athletic but being a bodybuilder for girls is a big turnoff. 
---
PS: I luv u ur so cute
---
You. Husband. Now.
---
yikers, the game was so fucking hard for me back then
---
Wait, they launched it on Discord? There are games on Discord? So that's why it's not on Steam.
---
I mean wasn't the Nazi one of the good guys?
---
I wonder if Hide Or Die will share similar fate.
---
Yeah sure, but it’s very likely that the survivors end up 3 gen-ing themselves. Happens to me all of the god damn time.
---
This is quite the breathtaking meme.
---
Then its up to the killer to weigh their options. If they want to take that risk it should be allowed 🤷‍♀️
---
I love when people attempt to make others feel bad online but fail miserably because they don’t know anything about the person but hey... it’s just fun isn’t it
---
This is the funniest post on this subreddit I’m actually crying
---
Tbh I find that people use ruin, pop, NOED and haunted grounds and they down you take you to the closest hook you next to ruin and defend gens until HG is finished then camp. 2 gens max are done and then they start playing or they do this again and lose ruin but get a kill with another 2 gens done. They defend last 3 gens and get in a chase comit to chase hook them use pop and keep going until a generator is almost done then camp when the generator is done push. The only way they lose is if you get ruin early or you pop ruin instead of HG. It’s hell to go against.
---
When you have Hex: No One Escapes Death and they aren't close enough to escape. haha.
---
I robot
---
I think something is up on PS4 today. I waited 20 mins and couldn’t get a killer lobby then switched to survivor and still took around 15 to find a match.
---
You have to do what you think is best and try to have fun. Over time you will learn strategies and naturally camp less as you gain skill. Leaving the hook is hard when you are new to the game because you are not sure how you will find another survivor. That will come in time. 
---
My advice, leave the hook to look for another person if you can. Use BBQ, Rancor, or Bitter Murmur as a perk as they will show you survivor locations and give you a place to look. However, don’t be afraid to go after people rushing the hook.
---
I wonder what Jason's ability could be?
---
Just put /s bruh
---
lmao throws me back to 2017 where everyone was playing fucking trapper
---
Lol it's perfectly allowed to camp. Do it if you want but it's a losing strategy if you can even refer to it as the layer.  It's performed by either brand new players or players that haven't learned the mechanics of the game yet and it will cost you a loss against even a half decent team because they will gen rush you while you mindlessly camp your 1K.  In the best interest of your personal killer games if you want to win consistently you won't be able to do that mindlessly camping survivors.  You will lose hard.
---
holy shit, that's like 100% not a coincidence, awesome
---
Oh yea
---
People think we've had too many licenced chapters lately which i kind of get. That being said though, i would be ok with this being another licenced chapter, provided its an *actual* chapter. My frustration is that we have gotten  2 paragraphs in a row. They called ghostface a chapter, but lets be real *its not, there's no map or survivor*. If licenced chapters mean smaller amounts of content for similar amounts of money, I don't want a new licenced chapter. If we get a full on stranger things dlc with a survivor, killer, and new map though i would be more than happy to see another licenced chapter.
---
Yes Yes Yes

#YES

[https://youtu.be/6sCBJ-14K2Q](https://youtu.be/6sCBJ-14K2Q)
---
It wasn't intentional, the survivor just happened to sneak away by the time I had a chance to hit 100%.
---
27th is the assumption
---
yeah, and then maybe like 100,000 bp or something
---
You got me at "when you have Hex: No One Escapes Death" yeah those killers are hilariously bad.
---
Yeah I didn't mean to edge it, the survivor just escaped as I was stalking them and just happened to be at 99.9%
---
fuck. that literally gives it up.
---
i can think of a few reasons, surv has OoO and ur a stealth killer, they are hooked when both exit gates are open, you wanna kill as many survs as you can and are just a dick, those are the reasons i can think of.
---
Let the hype begin
---
legion is probably why
---
Except your tip falls apart when SWF do this (or just insanely skilled survivors who work together). 
---
You can't go for others, because there are no others. Where is your "weakest link" when literally all of them does it? Why would they even care about points when they're literally not caring about actually doing their objectives or finishing the match?
---
And before you say this is just some hypothetical scenario I've thought up, it's not. Because that's exactly what I've encountered myself, because the game thought it acceptable to throw a killer and survivors who are almost 10 rank apart into a match for some reason.
---
i dont understand whats wrong w/ t-bagging, i find it kinda funny
---
This or something like it would be perfect for a stranger things chapter
---
Wow. You really need to relax and stop taking criticism so personally. You are taking what I say as an attack directly against you. Hopefully you can calm down later and look at the points I was trying to make. 
---
See you in the fog.
---
1) Fix Meg's neanderthal looking face. 
---
u/MiksteR_Rdy
---
2) Give Meg a proper runners animation. u/Afgkid
---
3) Pit some meat on that poor girls bones, she's an athlete for crying out loud.
---
That is the best scenario, I’d happily go against it, so much fun!
---
I ran this post through Google Translate under "mental gymnastics" and it's boiled down "I reject your reality and substitute my own." I guarantee that this guy runs around with his SWF buddies with mics with Dead Hard, Adrenaline, DS and whatever else along with his Instant Heal syringe and dozens of Haddonfield offerings and he's obsessed with controlling the narrative.
---
It’s hell to go against jumpscare myers but goddamn is it fun to play jumpscare Myers
---
Why are you so fragile?
---
This is perfect as a Huntress &amp; Dwight main.
---
I dont understand what's wrong w/ face camping, I find it kinda funny
---
I did bring an instaheal
---
But why they seem so damn bad
---
WHAT!
---
You claiming Proxy camping isn't a thing doesn't make it not a thing lol.  It exists and is common af among new and/or weak players.
---
He has no mind game potential or map pressure abilities, just an insta down which can be avoided and good perks. His ability just isn’t that useful. 
---
You may be right about the chase thing, even if doctor and trapper can stop loops with shocks / pre set traps but LF’s ability isn’t even useful outside of chases unless he camps.
---
Even cooler: not tunneling or camping for no reason
---
Look asshole, your criticism is dog shit because YOU. DID. NOT. READ. You failed at comprehending my post you fucking dipshit. It's as simple as that.
---
Oof. Not true, if survivors have ds you can still get multiple kills
---
Well there it is
---
I don't know what killers you face but this doesn't happen to me, only rarely do I get camped. (Rank 8 survivor). When I play killer I don't even pursue chase's long. It is really just a waste of time. I would rather be pressuring the gens.
---
His powers succ
---
I disagree with your idea rewarding camping. Allow me to explain why. The idea about camping may sound like a nice idea on paper, but would be to the detriment of the game. Heres why, when a killer face camps you, it's sucks, but face camping leaves the killer completely fucked as well as you. He seals his own fate as well as yours. If your teammates aren't potatoes, they'll either get a borrowed time rescue, or just do the gens and leave. The reason this mechanic would be silly is because it would heavily restrict the killer in a way that wouldn't make sense. Say a killer hooks a dude and bbq doesn't proc at all. That means everyone is nearby. Now it wouldn't make sense for the killer to go anywhere else. But your idea would force him to leave even though there's no reason to. Additionally It would also allow people to take the game hostage with ease. Imagine this mechanic was added so that you couldn't die as long as the killer was next to you on the hook. You obviously can't get yourself out of there but your team can get you out either for whatever reason. The killer could just sit there and hold the game hostage by never leaving. That sounds a lot worse than just dying after a while.
---
I played about ten matches as killer yesterday and got toxic messages from almost every single one. Most were accusing me of tunneling or camping, and a couple just said I was terrible even though I 3/4-ed the match. I was rank 10 in killer before rank reset, and I never got anything toxic, so its been fun.
---
I mean they could implement he throws knives and has the abilities of the trapper with an extra stun, they could figure out a counter perk for a survivor as they did with the trapper, I’m thinking the knife could be a mechanic like the huntress’s hatchets or a knife that has a cooldown and eventually gets back to u when throwing it, I would like to see something like that, although I wouldn’t like them putting perks to counter the looping abilities, an example would be teleporting, as if that were to happen it would be like the nurse and the trapper combining and it would make a combination of a very OP killer and I wouldn’t agree with the ppl that say this is a good idea, whatsoever it would be a great idea to have a new fresh character like him and especially if they were to make him free, that way there is not gonna be as many nurse mains, they could also add a boomerang mechanic for the knife, they would figure something out.
---
[Here's the link to the tweet.](https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1162786265537761280)
---
This basically confirms the speculation though. Now the question is who will be the Survivor?
---
Why are salty survivors going out of their way to take down posts that they don't like? A lot of questions go unanswered.
---
No warning at all would be gamebreaking.  If a killer has the ability to immediately end your game by proxycamping your hook and mori'ing you off it in seconds this is something the survivors need to know for it to be remotely fair.  Moris change the way you have to approach various situations in game which is why the devs give the earning pregame.
---
Well many survivors have different thresholds for what is considered camping/tunneling. I can tell because I always get salty bois after a 4K game posting on my profile letting me know all I did was camp/tunnel no matter if I did or not. 
---
1st. If I know three people are around the guy I hooked, I’m not going to leave the hook unattended just so survivors can have fun. I’m a killer, I want to kill. If survivors are dumb enough to all go for the unhook instead of doing gens I’m going to punish them. Makes no sense for me to walk 50 meters away just so I don’t hurt their feelings. 
---
2nd. If I know somebody has been hooked twice and is a good player, I’m going to eliminate them from the game. I don’t care if they’re using their special flashlight and offering. I don’t care if they’re going to be mad. That’s usually the smartest play and I’m not going to play like a dummy just so they can have fun. 
---
3rd. Survivors complain about camping/tunneling 7/10 times in games they lose.  If I cared every time I got accused of it I would be sitting in the corner of the map letting everybody do their thing as to not ruin their game. However, I’m a killer and my job is to kill everybody. That means the kids that don’t know how to use a flashlight, but stand in front of me all the time. The idiots that go for the insta unhook when I’m 5 meters away. You bet I’ll probably tunnel the guy on his death hook to get him out of the game. The only time I lose is when I try to be nice and don’t take advantage of the 2 people trying to body block for their friend that’s on death hook. 
---
“Tunneling and camping” is part of the game and if killers cared what survivors said no killers would have an enjoyable game and the survivors would always win. Especially with how loosely everybody in this game applies these complaints. It’s different if someone facecamps or just chases one person the whole game and this usually leads to a survivor victory if they aren’t stupid.
---
I think it is alright survivor t-bag survivor (what usually means thank you, follow me, let me help you ect) if you do that to a killer it comes of as rude and toxic. It just seems like you wanna show him you are better and it seems like you have a big ego. I heard that some people did not know that t-bagging was toxic and did it as a way of thank you when they got the hatch thanks to the killer. I agree that it may seem funny to the survivor but the killers usually don't like it (I do know some who don't care about t-bagging and take it as fun as well but most of us are kinda emotional and may not see it as what you see it. So I always think that you should be aware of what you do and that you know it may not hurt the other person.
---
Why are you?
---
Alien would fit Deathgarden more.
---
I really hope Steve is the survivor.
---
I'm a Killer mains that always run ruins. I don't see how anything you said is an argument about anything.
---
Who am I?
---
hopefully steve, nancy, or hopper and maybe an upside down map
---
I get more hate mail from survivors. If I'm not playing to kill but just get daily's and have fun I get "Hahaha you suck" and if I play to kill I get called a tunneler or camper. Regardless of my 0% proximity to hooked survivor. They spam you with the hate mail and when you block them they report your profile. Imho survivors are the bigger whiners and I'm a survivor main, I just play killer casually. Like omg you 11s (and one 19) with purple toolboxes and brand new parts destroyed a level 18 killer, who just wanted her bing bong boi slug daily... whhoo hooo!!! (I was gonna let them all live for protecting the baby Dwight anyway.)
---
All right so the survivor is Steve the badass mom
---
The killer is probably going to be demogordon 
---
And the map will be star court mall
---
I dont disagree, pisses me off when i would randomly be the target despite never running old DS.
---
However its still easy to avoid.
---
I mean just because it's reportable didn't mean people won't do it. I think most people would prefer if it wasn t possible at all.
---
What?
---
I like that idea a lot. Almost like building the ability up like Michael Myers
---
That's the point
---
For context: She had BBQ, Sloppy Butcher, Ruin and NoED. I knew exactly that she had NoED because she only had three Active perks all game.  
---
I 99% two gens and got to work on Totems. She only had three remaining on the map as far as i could tell, as i broke one at the beginning of the match and one was Ruin. I scout out two broken ones, then find the last one and break it, in the that time she sadly caught a very good looping Nea that saved my ass multiple times.  
---
I pop the first gen and immediately go to work on the regressed gen. I notice Nea isn't getting saved, and look to find Spirit's circling the Jungle Gym up front with all her 110% Killer Speed. Nea dies after i pop the last gen, and i walk towards one Exit gate.  
---
Seeing the Spirit hurry to the gate, i hide in the nearby locker and the Meg comes walking around the corner after the Spirit wastes her Phase Walk to get to the other Gate. Meg starts working on the gate and i get right up behind her, knowing exactly well that the Spirit is going to try to pull some dumb shit and secure her 4k.   
---
This is where the Video starts. 
---
The Spirit ended up disconnecting before getting her Blood Points, but the Meg and I got ours, meaning this Spirit disconnected in Vein.
---
Tombstone myers fucking sucks
---
Yeah having a 2 killer mode would bw a bit bro imagine a nurse and doctor combo since doc can track everyone letting nurse deal with them after.
---
Only killer this could work out is legion
---
yep, get this all the time, i also get it when im about to get off a gen, and also when i get forced off gens
---
Imo, her default bridal saw and her phantom of the opera saw look good
---
Well thats it in a nutshell. The ranking system is shit and easily abusable.
---
Noob killers get frustrated facing people with more experience, so they either have a shit time, or get lucky hits in then just camp and hit on hook out of frustration.
---
The ranks need fixing and rank reset needs to die.
---
We already have a cop survivor though
---
Truueee..
---
One sentence too much for you?
---
Imagine thinking clown requires no skill. That's like saying nurse is easy to pla-
---
Oh wait
---
yea but t-bagging doesn’t affect gameplay at all, when ur facecamping ur preventing a survivor from playing the game.
---
Ignore him lol
---
Steve for sure, now I would like billy as a killer cause he demonstrated his strength in season 3
---
Who says there only has to be one cop survivor?
---
Or big brain Sheen
---
The entity just thinks David is sexy
---
Well, your teammates escaped if they aren’t dumb so maybe you’ll feel better because you took the hit for the whole team
---
who doesn’t?
---
Here is a guide made by one of the better killers in DBD, ScottJund: [How to Run All Generic Tiles as Killer - Dead by Daylight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ)
---
You can't prevent looping, but what you can do, is chase survivors in a smart way instead of just holding W. 
---
Try to get the pallet down ASAP, if the loop has high walls, change directions to shorten the gap even faster. Once the pallet is down, don't mindlessly break it, force the survivor to the side that will either push him to a deadzone (an area where you previously broke other pallets) or he will have to run past you, reducing the distance gained.
---
I mean, if the killer wants you to have a bad time, you are gonna have it. He can facecamp you, he can bring in a bunch of perks to suck out the fun from the game and make playing a miserable experience, he can tunnel you off hook and immediately mori you if he decided to bring one, he can generally make life for a specific survivor ridiculously frustrating and guarantee he depips should he decide to, even if that means the rest of them will escape. 
---
In high ranks, experienced SWFs will be able to lessen the amount of control the killer has, but generally, if the killer decides someone shouldn't be having any fun playing, and is somewhat competant or abuses a broken addon/killer, that someone won't be having fun for sure.
---

---
Thanks for the tips
---
Moris are in the game though, and easy to get. I personally never use them because I hate getting noticed but then there are some games where o think "man I wish I had put on a mori so I could kill these fuckers" because of the way they're playing.  It doesn't happen often enough though to waste the offering space.
---
Babykillers need to be represented too I guess lol.
---
It's basically confirmed now
---
Yes he is toxic
---
But the survivor was so good that he let the killer know he couldn't catch him??? But he got caught :((( nah, he experienced as much as he wanted! I'm a survivor main btw, I literally have 0 empathy for these people.
---
Mobile? Horrorfield is the closest thing I've played to DBD but it's not the same people by any means so they probably won't follow 100% of what BHVR did
---
No, they need to make the entire band complete!
---
https://youtu.be/oliCVn7Ic68
---
Haha damn right 🤣
---
I don't think ruin is that bad. The more hours you have in, the better you get with hitting great skill checks and it only gives ya few seconds more time to avoid gen rushing. I don't have such a high rank so I don't know how much of a hell it is. But I met twice hag that really loved her Hex:Ruin very much xD
---
Well, the only way I can see Jason happening is if somehow there was a deal already in place before the lawsuit went as far along as it did; and I really don't understand how it's getting out on the Switch either.
---
or why they'd WANT to; I can't imagine there's a lot of people clamoring for it on there.
---
That's a tough question. The easiest and hardest solution at the same time is to just play nurse. She can't be looped when you learn her. Plus, starting early is good because it gives you the most time to learn her kit. If you don't want to play the exact same killer with the exact same build every single game like most survivors assume we want to, then you can always run pallet eater (Spirit Fury / Enduring) to punish greedy looping. You could also play killers like clown, trapper, or pig (first to can deny loops or stop them early, second is mind game potential)
---
After that, nothing. Looping is something that survivors are going to keep in the game for all eternity, and will fight any nerfs or changes. There's nothing we can do besides playing the same killers or the same builds. If you get bored, then you're forced to deal with the fact that you're going to be looped into oblivion and there's nothing you can do.
---
Okay I'm convinced XD
---
You can get pallets down quicker if you just walk straight through them and don’t respect them at all. You can also play billy or lf to get them broken a lot quicker. Mind gaming at unsafe pallets is also a must when you get to better ranks or just play nurse to teleport through them. The more you play the better you’ll understand it
---
Definetely nurse
---
*Laughs in Iron Maiden.*
---
Is this a work or a shoot??
---
Leatherface
---
It's all a misdirect to hide the upcoming Bojack Horseman chapter with character actress Margot Martindale as the killer.
---
how is that related to what i said, that’s literally why i find it funny, they’ve given their karma, they t-bagged, they got caught, theres no reason to camp them.
---
I'm actually a happily married woman, but thank you for your input!
---
Freddy definitely has the coolest power image.
---
Killer: Demogorgon
---
Survivor: Either Hopper or Steve, maybe Nancy or even both Steve and Nancy
---
Map: Starcourt Mall (or maybe Hawkins Lab, but that sounds kinda boring)
---
I did! I’m hoping it actually does something.
---
If you think trashtalking is fun then you are just one of the toxic people. End of story.
---
I can't imagine being this upset over Rancor.  That perk is such a non-factor it isn't even on my radar of things to complain about let alone taking it to the point where I need to post about it on Reddit.
---
Depends on your rank. For console, possibly Plague or Huntress.
---
by making you take a break and quit the game, they win lmao
---
Yeah, it is. But they never cared about our feelings so why care about theirs?
---
Subtle teaser?
---
Yea I get that every so often too. It’s like they are trying to prove to themselves that the only reason they lost is because someone used an easy killer? What makes a killer easy anyways lol
---
I see. As a pig OoO can really be annoying so I get why you'd camp that person but I myself wouldn't do it but if I would do that the stealthy play style as a stealth killer wouldn't be ruined anymore.
---
Nah that's all the reason to, I think you're missing the point. The survivor disrespected the killer, the killer caught the survivor. Now it's time for the survivor to get the tasty downpip and realize disrespecting your opponent is a dick move.
---
I was playing as him with a bone splinter and I thought I would be great if after the first few swings of his frenzy, you could cancel with a primary attack.
---
You didn't say stop reacting, you said stop being sensitive. Some people are naturally more sensitive than others and I don't see what the problem is with it. If your suggestion is to block or report them, you're admitting there's a problem with their behavior, which is the core of what the OP's saying.
---
If camping or even general play style were grounds to prevent being a fog whisperer, all of them would be survivor mains. Tru3 is a good example. He has a very sweaty play style that often involves soft / hard camping / patrolling followed by tunneling while also using the most boring / obnoxious builds there is.
---
I’ve been max skeptical until now but.. yeah, this is it chief.
---
Also. You assume people would just sit there instead of leaving and going to generators if hes just gonna camp. Like they already do.
---
Slug
---
If your getting ds-ed multiple times after the egc has begun someone is doing something wrong. Whether that be the survivors or the killer.
---
Thanks\^\^ I kind of was worried about getting called a camper when this situation occurs :
---
\- guy on hook. - you leave to not camp - obviously a survivor near waiting to unhook. - doesn't want to seem as a camper and leaves hook and pretty much waits for the rescue to go after the rescuer if I haven't found a survivor till then.
---
We get windows like every 20 feet dude lol
---
Oh for sure, definitely happens. Was just clearing up what the add-ons do!
---
Happened once, didn't tried to recreate, but when I got grabbed by killer after trying to unhook a person, hitted my DS, but killer didn't got the stun and I died.
---
Few times DS conditions where met and skill check didn't even triggered.
---
Hills on spirits map have some blockers when you run up the stairs you get stuck and die.
---
Yea like the "Ghostface is not comming to the game" lol
---
That build is op.
---
I really hope the map is Starcourt! It would be such an interesting change of scenery.
---
Typically a red rank survivor here  and I apologize for those who come into our lobbies looking for a good time but end up getting wrecked in a sweaty mess.
---
I'd buy those Ace and Dwight skins if they were real tbh
---
Use /s
---
I get watch you mean Elfriede69 I really do. But some people take that to heart and see that as an insult and that gets them emotional and that effects them - effecting the rest of the game.
---
It’s funny that you say that, because while it doesn’t increase wiggle speed, it’s tripped up a good amount of killers enough for me to wiggle out and get away while they run into walls.
---
Oh I dont camp. I only stick around if i can actively see the survivor who's trying to unhook. I like being able to prove I dont camp or tunnel. Not my fault if you're the only person I can find bc you're the worst player out of your friends tho. I dont care if people escape, I just hate getting the whole "Haha you suck dick at killer" messages.... I could have hung up the baby Dwight, but no I admit I only could land lucky hits on the 11s but i actually enjoyed the game bc i like seeing how other people play, and they were very altruistic. I just dont get the whole spamming me and then reporting my profile just because I block them bc I dont want the spam. 
---
I agree that the rank needs fixing, and I dont like the rank reset at all. And I do agree that it makes noob killers camp, what else are they supposed to do when a 20 is against a bunch of level 10s? They cant do anything else. I dont camp bc I dont like it when I'm a survivor, but me against a bunch of lower ranks I just get obliterated. When I see I'm about to obliterate a bunch of survivors I at least try and make the game last longer, or give one of them the hatch. How often do you see these higher rank survivors sacrifice themselves? Lol.
---
ew what? 🤔
---
It's not really camping if the dude hooks you and then goes to the generators.
---
I can relate to that. At first I mainly played as a survivor and dabbled here and there with the hag and doctor until the spirit and legion came out in where I started playing the killer more often. There wasn't any issues when I was the doctor or hag but when I play as legion or spirit I get all sorts of hate messages.
---
I really liked the rage mechanic from F13. I saw someone make a template for him. Basically his power was rage as a type of super bloodlust.
---
As he chased people, he built rage, and at max tier he could just instantly break through pallets until hitting the person.
---
I didn't spectate them until the end, but they went to work on the gens while I was camped, so I sure hope they made it out!
---
I'm not gonna lie. I was one who didn't care much to have Ghostface in DBD, but he ended up being one of my favorite killers.
---
t-bagging is barely even offensive, ur just butthurt abt it, imo im not being ‘disrespected’ and face camping is a tactical mistake, and ur sucking the fun out of the entire game by not letting that player play, ‘ooh no i got t-bagged my whole game is ruined!’
---
Everything you wrote was absolute nonsense and you're too fucking stupid to realize this. I know at rank 20 this is some high level shit to you but in reality, once you get to red ranks, that's not how the game is played. 
---
It's impossible to have any kind of constructive discussion because of mongoloids like YOU, sir that add absolutely nothing and keep propagating nonsense either out of maliciousness or ignorance. I will tear apart your absolutely insanely stupid little theories:
---
1: a lot of them do hit Great skillchecks. It's not that hard. You make it seem like this is super rare when it isn't when you get to red ranks. If you actually played at red ranks you would understand this because your entire argument would get thrown right out the window.
---
2: again, nonsense. All it takes is one guy with a toolbox, a perk that increases repair speed or occasionally hit Great skillchecks and that gen is getting done. End of story. Again, at red ranks you would understand this. 
---
3: This actually made me laugh:
---
&gt;If you play it right, it usually can last at least 2 minutes.
---
Dude, there is no "playing it right." The totem and spawns are RANDOM. How can you "play it right" when something is determined RANDOMLY? Did you even read what you wrote? You do realize that survivors right on top of Ruin is still an issue, right? You do realize that survivors just knowing totem locations will still find the totem in under a minute, right? I don't think you do. You have no control as to where that totem spawns or where survivors spawn so what in god's balls are you talking about by suggesting you can "play it right?" You are a goddamn idiot. 
---
4: the one point I agree with. It sucks being forced to use 2 perks to slow the game down but this is what you have to do because Ruin is so fucking garbage.
---
I'm very interested in that chapter.
---
LOL, there's the salt. I think you're the one being butthurt chief. 
---
Its called sending a message, one could say I'm cleaning the community out... one toxic survivor at a time :)

Son of a bitch. It doesn't work with Devour Hope anymore? Goddamnit. That was so much fun.
---
Fun=yes good=no, well as good as clown.
---
Steve (Hopefully!) or Hopper which is alright but not as "cool" and would have less than imaginative perks.
---
Demogorgon as the killer with the ability to place portals on walls and teleport between them as if exiting the Upside-Down
---
Myers Estate as the map with Will's Tent and the House
---
Weird.
---
Wow would be crazy if we didn’t get something stranger things related with a tweet like that
---
I was confused as shit but then everyone's gangster till they hit spirit collision
---
You don't know me. I don't care about winning and losing because I'm not that competitive. I can laugh about my own loses because I really don't care. What I care about is having fun and the fun's taken away when you find yourself with people who are just out to be dicks for the sake of it, and proceed to harass you after the game's over and not just in any small way but to actually group on you and conjure up the nastiest things they can think of, and I'm talking death threats and wishing cancer. That's just disgusting.
---
Is ST worth watching? I’ve never seen it
---
Upvoting becausw more people need to see this amazing art, not because of the title
---
There is nothing survivor biased about ripping on 5 blink NOED Nurse.  Any killer main with self respect would also clown on that shit.
---
The streamers name is literally "Camper"!
---
I'm not just calling him that lol (even though he lives up to his name)

Open exit gate 2 times as Jane
---
How is it a reach?
---
i dont know anything about stranger things i just wanna play as winona ryder
---
I think i know what could be Demogorgon’s power. That is in the form of two powers kinda like Freddy, Amanda and Danny Ray William Johnson. Maybe it can attack from the ceiling aswell as pounce at survivors. And once it downs a survivor, it has the option to pull them into the Upside-Down where the Demogorgon’s stats are amped. In the Upside-Down, the Demogorgon has the option to enter or exit it by pressing the toggle button. During the Upside-Down, the survivor will need to find a way out while trying to not be tricked by random Fake Palettes that are placed randomly.
---
Rats have been associated with Stranger Things a lot due to Season 3's use of them, Roblox even used them in marketing for it's Stranger Things tie-in.
---
It could also be a reference to how DBD is sometimes described as a cat-and-mouse game, with the skull representing the killer/cat and the rat representing a Survivor.
---
Those are my guesses, anyway.
---
It's three images of quotes of the show "If this is a prank, you're dead", "By 5-1-5?" and "Don't put that thing away. I'm going to blow some daylight" alongside a skull and rat emoji.
---
It’s pictures of different quotes and it has the words DEAD, BY, and DAYLIGHT in them.
---
You don't have to be a survivor / killer main too look at things objectively. I didn't say his strategy was right or wrong, just pointed out. Do you not agree that he plays like that?
---
Probably one of the least likely
---
Are you sure that you hitted it?
---
*sigh*
---
When clock is hungry it goes back 4 seconds
---
actually what's the song in this video?
---
There's plenty of evidence that supports this theory
---
Inb4 it's just a pack of Survivors
---
Who needs windows? You have a ton of pallets that can't be mindgamed and there are so many that you don't even need to loop most of them.
---
By the time all of them are broken the game is long over and you are free to go.
---
It’s vice versa with blood warden and noed
---
It isnt.
---
huntress the game lags when you throw a hatchet, nurse lags when you teleport but since huntress lags after throwing the hatchet defo nurse
---
I just tested it and it does, in fact, work with Devour Hope. What are you talking about?
---
Is Stranger Things supposed to be horror, honest question because I watched one episode and was bored to tears.
---
Its inspired by DbD, the devs said that. Literally.
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
Probably because you're brutish.
---
No it’s a scratch mirror so 0 terror radius
---
&gt;Don't worry I really meant camping. Stood like a creepy guy right next to a tree and watched me (was funny the way how he was positioned) I do take a good look if it really is camping/tunneling or just a mistake of mine overthinking.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;To your 1st: That's obviously logical. I won't see that as camping. If you know they are there why leave.  
---
&gt;To 2nd: Makes sense taking the more skilled survivor out when you have the chance. Since they are the biggest threat. As long as you don't tunnel them since the start of the game.  
---
&gt;3rd: I really don't care if I lose or win. Most important is that u enjoy the game. Unhooking when killer is near is not bad when the other one has borrowed time, well as long as the person is not getting grabbed before u finish unhooking. But I get were you are coming from. When killer is near, and you don't have borrowed time it's a stupid move to unhook and it comes of as farming.  
---
&gt;Yeah it is part of the game and it is an option to tunnel or camp but it isn't always the best or the nicest option. I get that you need to kill. That's obvious since you are a killer after all. But it comes often off as rude and  toxic (I mean the moments when new guys are being camped right at the start as an example).  Now I guess the killer doesn't have to be nice but having a explanation why he was camping is at least better then none. I don't have to win even tho it's what I have to do in game - survive or kill it depends who I play.  Same as Killer I really dont care about winning or losing. That's why I probably don't enjoy watching campers well camp. It just seems like they just often really wanna win and don't care if they may come off as rude. I really get where you are coming from and it is interesting seeing a different opinion on this. I guess you are a higher rank since you seem like you have seen so much more then I have.
---
I think tunneling is ok. If your going to blind me and taunt I should kill you first
---
It’s the intro of Only by Nicki Minaj!
---
Its not a horror show. Its a.. you know idek what its supposed to be
---
Anywhere like this.
---
/s bruh
---
Don't play Hearthstone but I get ya
---
Mom said it was my turn.
---
Same! But I don't know if the graphics team can handle the rendering of such a glorious head of hair.
---
Paragraphs? No.
---
Prison time? Yes.
---
I'd class it more as science fiction, but the monster (demogorgon) would be pretty legit as a killer, I'd say.
---
I like seeing I’m a big buff guy :)
---
Yes I got the ding sound.
---
As a killer main I think exhaustion perks are ok. The only perk I really care about is decisive strike
---
That one daily: As the Cannibal, be a shit stain for a total of 300 seconds
---
You’d have to run it with the locker stun perk
---
i mean that sucks for you i get that, but honestly, if i were in your position, i would have laughed my balls off
---
No offense but what's the point of face camping survivors who are toxic? Someone else being toxic doesn't give you any right to be toxic. What do you gain from that? All that happens is you just prove you're a toxic player...
---
you stall the killer for like 20 seconds. Thats like 25% of a gen, fucking top tier shit my guy
---
Not always. Wouldn't you be pissed at a really rude survivor? T-bagging, flashlight clicks all the time like that person really wants to kill you inside. (luckily never had that...yet) And yeah it does work well at low ranks.
---
i saw everyone thinking its either her or david harbour's character, assuming there even is a survivor
---
I don't have any exact times or anything. you kinda just have to feel it. it comes with time, it took me more than a couple attempts before I got the timing right. give it a few tries and you'll get it down. sorry I don't have any exacts
---
Yea if I got a euro for every time I got someone with MYC and Hag I would be a millionaire.
---
Yea but the point is all those people saying that he has not comming even when we had leaks because there are people that just wanna feel the attention
---
Sometimes I switch to killer and make it really clear I'm just there to farm and goof around.  It can be pretty therapeutic after stressful games
---
^this the "ez" part is petty and unnecessary
---
Boxe
---
I hate to break it to you but survivors have and use op perks on the basic.
---
Lol virgin
---
&gt;Maybe a switch for killer that let's you pick if you want to prioritize a fair mmr experience or faster queue times, I guess that's the only way
---
Matchmaking is a two way road. Survivors could also be looking for a killer to play against, after a while, they would go against any rank (higher or lower than theirs) just to be able to play. If there isn't say, any rank 20 or rank 1 killer available, survivors at rank 1 / 20 wouldn't mind going against a killer rank 10. If the killers at rank 10 have this feature you suggested enabled, it would be bad for survivors and ultimately, bad for the game. 
---
Matchmaking is a sketchy system but thankfully for us, DBD is a casual game. People just need to stop bitching about it 24/7 and let devs try their best to improve queue times while maintaining a stricter matchmaking.
---
Kill your friends tends to freeze once a game finishes
---
Maybe not but as far as I know nothing has been confirmed yet.
---
Him coming to the game made me wanna watch Scream, and it's probably my favorite horror series now, y'know except for the third one. The rest though oh yeah. I would recommend getting into them if you haven't!
---
It pretty much has
---
Since its strongest part is the stagger reduction, Balanced Landing can reasonably and viably be paired up with any other Exhaustion perk, including Sprint Burst. Pairing it up with Dead Hard is usually the way to go, as that way you can pick and choose between the two more freely, making use of BL's sprint if so needed. It's especially nice because as you mentioned, while BL is invaluable against M1 killers and on select maps, it's lacking on a variety of other maps and against a number of other killers (Nurse and Spirit primarily), and so pairing it with an Exhaustion perk that is more versatile and reliable, and at least more effective against those latter killers, is worth it.
---
Xenos would not be far fetched at all. Those things are fucking terrifying on paper
---
can I just, you know what ill just do this.
---
# aaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa
---
That's because the average match is two solo players and a duo. How can BHVR balance the game around 4mans when they're like less than 5% of matches?
---
If your looping them on a wall that blocks your vision and they disappear for a while there probably mind gaming
---
100%, especially the first season
---
Define what you call camping. There are many things people consider camping. Are you saying face camping or just staying in the general vicinity?
---
If anyone needs a facelift its Quentin. He looks like a melted wax statue.
---
...you could just play some games to de-rank
---
Perfectly Balanced As All Things Should be
---
If you stay within area to get back to me before I even have the chance to move away from hook, that's camping.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/crqric/if_you_spawn_next_to_a_hex_totem_do_you_cleanse/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

I believe this was originally posted here as an original creation by u/spartaren, so that is probably the reason for the "repost" comment.
---
If you buff it to BBQ level, you need to add one million ways to counterplay it
---
To be honest, I doubt Netflix would do a full DLC. I am expecting a Cosmetic DLC
---
I didn't even realize that that hit lol, Claudette has got freaking wraith's hitboxes apparently.
---
It’s a shitpost
---
Maybe it's gonna be both Steve and Nancy  **👀**
---
I have plenty of respect for everyone else lol, it's only the ones ruining the experience for others? It's not like I'm tunneling some random dwight who didnt do anything.
---
Scratched mirror doesn't change his TR. He has permanent 6m TR
---
Reported for teabag
---
With monitor and abuse
---
 over hyped show that's not even scary for an over hyped crossover. good thing i've been done playing this game lmao.
---
it just does feel empty without jason, like yeah he has his own game and its very extensive and great fanservice, but playing jason in f13 is really frustrating a lot of the time
---
in a world where he could be in dead by daylight I don't know what his power would be besides just walking through pallets? which could be kinda broken, but he needs something related to his brute and unrelenting strength. It's almost like the more source material there is to pull from, the harder it gets to come up with a good loadout for him.
---
There are a few issues there though.
---
Every killer has a weapon/is deformed in some way or has a mask.
---
Billy doesn't have a signature weapon, looks like a normal human and has no mask. He was just a normal looking dude with superhuman strength.
---
If he is the killer though we better get a lifeguard skin.
---
And a door is a foot away from each of them.
---
Since there’s most likely going to be a stranger things chapter, I’m thinking Freddy’s rework is going to influence the new killer/demagorgen power. 
---
Also the most likely survivors are to be people that have died in the show, for example &gt;!Bob, Alexie, hopper!&lt; , because it’s seems unlikely they would take a character that still alive in the show since most of the time the entity takes people they have died or are fixing to die.
---
Can anyone re-upload the offerings download? The full pack doesn't seem to have it and the link is dead.
---
So then your interpretation of camping would also include someone who goes back to the hook as well?
---
Dwight's not ready to come outta the closet just yet.
---
I think it’s fine to tunnel. Don’t camp though instead place traps in the grass nearby. Also if you have the pig there is a perk called make your choice
---
Didn’t you hear? You’re not allowed to make perks that help survivors cuz then they’re broken
---
Yeah but when we're talking about camo survivors your only options are Claud, dark jacket Adam, and dark outfit jake. 
---
Soooo why even say this?
---
Give us Pamela since Jason got an entire game to himself and make her abilities nothing like the the ft13th game.
---
Stroheim technically aided the Joestars against the Pillar Men, yes. But he was still a Nazi.
---
Watch season 1 then pretend it ended there
---
The roadmap says this DLC will have a Killer and a Map. I assume it'll have a Survivor too.
---
I never used the electrodes with it yet but I love interview tape and honestly 20 meters is already ridiculous. Usually run it with iri king because my rng apparently loves that add on.  Freaking brutal.
---
Have you even watched stranger things, it’s so good
---
Okay, but you don't suddenly gain the right of toxicity when others are toxic. There is 0 excuse for being toxic.
---
yes, i watched one episode, and i thought it was boring as all hell
---
I think we're in the same FB group aayyy
---
Also, we also have the (Hill)Billy as a Killer and a Survivor called Bill. Adding another Killer called Billy would be confusing af
---
He couldn't go through windows though.
---
kind of. I guess I am, at least. Playing for 1 or 2 weeks now.
---
Doctor, I don't think that is part of the autopsy procedure.
---
That's very... idealistic of you. I can respect it, I just dont agree.
---
Got to get them tasty bloodpoints
---
You say that as you browse the Subreddit by New.
---
I see this as an absolute win
---
That's funny, the exploiters who derail the match for everyone else are gonna complain that you try to salvage it. Fucking poor sports is all. And props for making it somewhat worthwhile, that's what good killers do. With the way you can lose addons/items and offerings being one time use bad matches can really suck the life out of you especially if you're running bloody party streamers/ gateau which should be a nice bolster for everyone or any other consumable you only have one of etc.
---
english is difficlut
---
If they aren't bloody I'd rather they keep their flashlights, I can't even count the amount of times I managed to get a hit/down just because they started dicking around with a flashlight instead of running away.
---
Maybe it’s because it was only one episode
---
That's how it works, except that you got up with Adrenaline so it should have resetted the wiggle bar. And also, last time I saw, the part that is increased by being dropped should be white, not empty. So I think it's a glitch
---
On sight boy👀💪👊👊
---
Game still has a decent player base on PS4.  In it's prime it was more fun than DBD but in it's current state DBD has completely overtaken it.
---
It gets pretty weird when the cast is around 18 and their playing characters that act 14
---
Surprisingly it’s ok after that episode but that was the worst one that season.
---
I just want his Scoops Ahoy! outfit
---
the dwight is looping her perfectly
---
Not to mention meg's pants/skirts sagging so low from behind
---
Stop being such a crybaby. If someone insults you on Post game. Just take it, say something Back of you want and move on.
---
Someone catch me up, I want to know whats going on, I dont want to be a normie in denial
---
I saw similar posts yesterday but I was hella frustrated last night because It was an absolute shit show. What's worse is that I'm not even that bad but I can't get anywhere if my team isn't willing to cooperate with me
---
Very disappointing cosmetic as a whole :(
---
It did reset the bar when I had adrenaline though? I got up and when I went back down it got reset.
---
Clown, doctor, or leatherface.
---
Not the right situation, but the point still stands:
---

---
\*t bags, gets hit once, disconnects\* Tunneler &gt;.&gt;
---
Found the cunt
---
Sarah Linn as survivor? Sign me up.
---
They really need to add an unranked mode or something different
---
I hope to god its the mall that would be so cool
---
Can you post a link to the art?
---
Part of the beauty of running kindred is it tells other survivors whom you aren't communicating with that you are there as part of the team. I have never played with someone who has kindred who is not a team player.
---
Then why did you escape at 90%? That's what I'm asking
---
alot of perks make you change how you respond as well but the devs dont show that
---
"GODLY" IS A STRONG WORD, THERE IS ONLY ONE KILLER THAT HAS THAT KIND OF MAP PRESSURE, I DON'T EVEN NEED TO SAY HIS NAME.
---
they literally can't go wrong with survivor. Except Jonathon. Nobody wants him. 
---
Robin, Steve, Hopper, Joyce, Nancy, they can't go wrong with any of these.
---
A few do but the majority don't.
---
Kind of rather not have Hopper, I feel like Steve is something more fresh.
---
As a killer main, if you’re ultra super toxic post game, you’re getting added to the mori list 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
You have to look at the Demogorgon from a Gameplay concept and from what Netflix can do with it. It is the flagship of Stranger Things but without a sense of what it can do entirely. If you have a clearcut sense of what a Killer can do, you can easily turn it into a game character. With the Demogorgon, you don't exactly have that. Myers is a Stalker, not entirely superhuman (depending on the Canon used), Leatherface is a Cannibal with a Chainsaw, Ghostface is a stalker, with varying things that he or she does depending on Canon - The Demogorgon has very little concrete that can be used. However, this is from what I remember so take it with a grain of salt.
---
Its called mao mao. Its a really good show
---
Yes it would.
---
Given that he moves faster than normal when sawing, and even faster with speed and (fixed) acceleration add-ons, he can circle around the loop a lot faster than normal and survs will have no choice but to drop the pallet. Good survivors may wait to drop in order to get the stun, but LF can anticipate that and respect the pallet, then break it
---
DC’ing to give hatch?! No it isn’t.
---
Devs have stated no non-human Killers.
---
While I'm not for or against having a Xenomorph, I think they're just animalistic enough that they wouldn't even be considered.
---
Predator is flat out due to them getting their own game.
---
You should at least finish season 2, I think the finale of season 2 is great. The chicago episode is almost never brought up again.
---
You’re pretty tilted for no reason.
---
We're getting a Blair Witch chapter?
---
Suck a dick dumb shits perk! Hell yeah!
---
It could possibly be Flayed Billy.
---
\*looks around for witnesses before disconnecting\*
---
That‘s a fanart my dude
---
Nah, he's right about you.
---
Oh frickin heckles! I was talking to my bf about how cool it would be if they did this!
---
You never watched Scream until ghostface came to dbd!?!?!? 😱 Better late than never, I suppose lol Scream 1 is a CLASSIC. My personal favorite is Scream 4 tho. Don't @ me. 👊🏽 lol
---
thanks, I quit the game a while back but im trying to get back into it
---
Link?
---
Decisive strike isn’t fair
---
Contrary to popular belief, play style doesn’t make you toxic. The only way you can be toxic is to cheat or be a huge dick in post-game chat. So to answer your question the way you play isn’t toxic, but your attitude towards swf and people with a better rank than you definitely is and you should work on that.
---
Wouldn't it spoil &gt;!that Billy gets mind flayed!&lt; though?
---
He was cool though.
---
All I’m saying is if you don’t run TV in your name, who’s gonna know 🤷🏽‍♀️
---
I usually bring an ebony/green mori if I see TV, then lurk their stream and see if they’re toxic or not.
---
If they are, moris inc
---
If not, 3 hooks gl/ggwp
---
If you’re advertising, be prepared to be judged 🦀
---
Damn, players using items in the game to play the game! Curse them!
---
This is what it feels to ay against swf who abuse the bad matchmaking system
---
I really want Nancy, especially since we didn't get Nancy from A Nightmare on Elm Street.
---
Maybe those dog-like monsters will be the killer. It'd be cool if we got a four-legged killer for once.
---
Gimme a female survivor *pls*
---
at least now we know she sport.
---
Ooh i would love a predator 4v1 game
---
I think our focus should shift from... "It's a stranger things chapter!" To... "Who is the killer and/or survivor from stranger things?!"
---
Yeah unfortunately I wasn't too into horror movies until dbd. But now I'm obsessed with 80s and 90s horror. I love all the scream movies except 3, 3 can eat a fat dick. Scream 1 is still best tho imo
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
Another indoor map sounds boring in a secret lab setting? How is that boring?
---
The build doesn't work well outside of Lery's, there isn't enough closed space on The Game. 
---
As long as the survivors stick to upstairs, you won't be able to sneak on people with any awareness.
---
Have a template for this?
---
Interesting perks that are actually useable? Did you SEE ghostfaces perks? Dont get your Hope's up
---
Honestly though just dont put the ttv in your name I like to call it “streamer privilege” when they get tunneled etc
---
I would imagine it being very similar to Lery's or even The Game. I can't really imagine the Lab being a fun map gameplay wise. The mall sounds much more interesting and unique imo
---
Wouldn't played flayed billy just look like a normal survivor?  I nean i guess they can add black veins and stuff but idk.demogorgon would be better imo
---
wdym?
---
I love survivors who get heavily salted over tunnelers. Like yeah im gonna let you go get healed foh silly survivy boi
---
Noed is not that op
---
Its been a month. If tou havent seen the first epidode of season 3 you obviously don't care about ST
---
Every light is 25% progress and the doors take 20 seconds to open without any buffs/debuffs to opening speed or time so 5 seconds for first light if I’m correct.
---
Youre not just wrong, youre stupid.
---
Yeah that's what I've been thinking. The 20th lines up with the new chapter/mid chapter patch update-every-6-weeks pattern, presuming that the PTB comes out 2 weeks before the chapter itself comes out.
---
No, it used to be considered gen rushing when a brand new part wasn’t nerfed into the ground and it allowed multiple gens to pop super quickly. 
---
With things now I don’t consider anything to exactly be gen rushing, that’s just survivors playing the game. If a killer focuses on the looper the entire time, then that’s on the killer.
---
Foreshadowing that they are adding bikes to the game
---
Throw her inside wit yu
---
If you get the white top with angel wings her arms get warped and twisted when struggling on the hook
---
We all needed jacked Meg, but we did not get jacked Meg
---
When its about some guy online telling you to die through a screen yea it is.
---
Dwight likes Meg so much he merged with her.
---
Does anyone else suck at hitting great skill checks with someone else working on the gen?
---
I doubt it. The devs don’t just ban for mass reports I don’t believe
---
*Laughs in useful perk option*
---
I've been stuck on rank 16 as killer because I'm keep on getting survivors with thousands of hours. How the fuck am I supposed to compete.
---
Gamescom will be having a livestream show on the 19th filled with new reveals from many companies. I'm certain DbD is one of them.
---
https://imgur.com/t/maomao/8uHbuC1
---
idk then
---
I think you’re missing the point of my post. I’m just ranting jabroni. I don’t have a problem with the key. I’m just agitated that they’re all getting busted out today when I am trying for Adept. Don’t usually see any keys ever.
---
Either you DC *a lot*, or you use a lagswitch. Those are the only two unsportsmanlike conducts they issue bans for, as far as I know.  
---
Lucky for you it's only temporary the first two times. Take the L, and don't repeat your mistake.
---
Well based on Netflix’s recent tweet it’s basically confirmed. In really hoping we get hopper or Steve as the survivor.
---
Dmogorgon crossover
---
Ya the devs looked into the case and decided he was bad idk why or how but I doubt we will ever get the full story on what happened
---
Who hurt you?
---
Best advice wait for it to end
---
No disrespect but what rank are you playing at if killers are dc’ing when they lose their totem right away?
---
I don’t dc, and I’m on console so can’t lagswitch
---
that would be the logical assumption, although i would love to hear the full story and why the devs decided to ban
---
Dwight hands her the hatchets and slams the door
---
That's fine. I have noticed that Save the Best for Last does not stack from ambush hits. It also does not lost stacks from ambush hits.
---
I’m not sure I understand why you want such a huge terror radius on Myers though.
---
Me as well
---
"you're bad because you acknowledge that a killers power is worthless and detrimental in a chase and you have to be an m1 killer instead" - 🤡
---
Nah, if its gonna be anyone who's dead it better be Alexei
---
I do it right away if the killer wants to be a baby and leave chances are I don’t wanna be in that match anyway
---
You shot yourself in the foot in the first 2 paragraphs of this argument. He did add something constructive, you put forth your idea and he put forth his, then you freaked out because it wasn’t the same.
---
All your arguments here are acting like gens get blown through with ruin. Sometimes that’s correct, the perk won’t slow survivors down by much 100% of the time. But your build won’t stop survivors from burning through gens either. Corrupt Intervention only effects 3 gens for 2 minutes and Pop Goes the Weasel is only active after you hook a survivor. If someone loops you well enough, the survivors can easily go through a generator or two with 0 impediments to their progress.
---
She’s athletic?
---
My point was still that if in some weird universe JJBA were to end up in DBD, Strohiem wouldn't be close to being one of the killers seeing as he was on the protagonist's side.
---
I mean, usually when a new show comes out on Crunchyroll or VRV I wait until the entire season comes out to watch it instead of catching it as it comes out.
---
It allows me to hopefully get a better idea of what the show is about, makes Cliffhangers less annoying, and I can binge watch it.
---
My team always just hides when it happens lol
---
Not op, honestly he deserves an ability that can more easily down survivors than Billy's saw, because he has no sprint. But no, bubbas chainsaw is actually harder to get hits off with, AND he has no mobility
---
Meg
---
&gt; Perks could be something about how the smell of blood attracts them so bloodtrails from hurt survivors are easier to see,
---
This is already a wraith perk, but thanks for the write up :D
---
I’d say that rat (mouse) is a reference to the endless cat and mouse game.
---
If they say they do it to make the game unfun then it is toxic.
---
What do you guys think the dead mouse has to do with? I'm thinking a collab with Deadmau5 maybe?
---
You just like 2nd chances cause you got clapped the first time rofl
---
I've only watched 7 episodes before I got bored of it
---
I'm going to throw out a third option;
---
Kate.

Or Jane. Are you down with the Thiccness?

That face is me while being looped forever xD

But it's true
---
It's a bit overrated, but if it's coming to dbd then give it a watch.
---
I'd love to see either him, Robin or alexei in the game
---
Anything leathface does billy does better, and even if billy didnt exist. Bubba would still be shit. You say hes better than x in a chase but THOSE killers have abilities that help them in other ways, leatherface has literally nothing except a shitty chainsaw that is soooooooo easy to avoid.
---
Other people want to play and have fun too. It’s going to happen. Just keep trying. It’s just a trophy in a video game. You’ll get it eventually.
---
&gt; the next *season* is stranger things
---
yes, season 4 to be exact
---
ST comes out all at once. I woke up at 3am on July 4th to watch it. 8 hours later i was sleeping on a couch at a relative's house lmao
---
Don’t break unsafe pallets all the time, sometimes it’s better to just go around and continue the chase. If the survivor uses the pallet, mind game them to get a hit or down.
---
Stream sniping is where you watch a streamer play a game live with the intention of getting in the game and ruining it for them.
---
I know it is, thats why i also added in the aromas only the creature can see.
---
PLEASE GIVE US A JOJO CHAPTER
---
I mean, I never watched any Slasher film before I started playing DBD.
---
DBD and Dead Meat/Kill Count are what got me to sit down and pop in F13, My Bloody Valentine (thankfully the original one), and Scream, and I'm waiting on October to pick up one of those Walmart Movie Bundles for Halloween.
---
Killer queen has already touched the exit gate
---
If there was enough players in DBD there would be a casual mode. There would also need to be something to actually make it a casual mode so that you can't go into casual mode and tryhard.
---
They honestly should change left behind into the ability to see the hatches aura when they're the last one alive. Or something like that.
---
Tantrum is literally never an issue except if you're bumping into invisible walls or a rather small prop was in your way and you couldn't see it. Both can be avoided by knowing where those spots are + using your eyes.
---
"Survivors drop pallets on bubba all the time?"
---
Yes, if they're dogshit at the game. No survivor knowing what he's doing will drop pallets as soon as he reached a pallet. Any good survivor will get 2-4 extra loops out of a Bubba because barely any killer playing him disrespects pallets. They begin charging their chainsaw, but the survivor won't drop the pallet. In 90% of all cases the loop is big enough for the survivor to get 2 more loops in before the killer, most likely, attempts M1 but fails. That's another 2 loops then and on the third attempt they'll usually drop it. If someone's smart they'll never respect pallets as Bubba unless you're playing against obvious rank 20s.
---
I think that if BHVR added actual seasonal rank rewards and maybe just general rank bonuses, people who wanted to play seriously would just go play Ranked. No matter what game it is, you'll prob see some people trying to try hard in a Casual mode, but I think the real issue would be people just generally being toxic because it's a casual mode.
---
Oh, don't get me wrong.. Scream 1 is the best.. I don't know how to explain it.. I can achknowledge that the first is obviously a much better movie all around but for my own person viewing pleasures, tho I love Scream 1, something about Scream 4 would prefer me to rewatch that over the 1st, ya know what I mean? Lol probably not cause that was a mess. 
---
Ahh, so you're freshly on the horror movie bandwagon now? Welcome aboard, buddy. 😊 What are some of your favorites currently?
---
Then they don’t know how to counter it by pushing against the wiggle
---
They should combine sole survivor with object of obsession Into one perk and make the other do something else
---
This DVillefort person has a very nice art style.
---
FALSE. SURVIVORS. DON'T. WORK.
---
For one, the moment you realize that you're in a game with this kind of killer, every Survivor is just going to have an understood agreement to avoid the shit out of eachother. This means that any survivor running straight at you is a Killer, so run away.
---
For two, As a Killer you have to run slower than normal, have no power, would have to sit on generators to convince Survivors that you're the real deal, and so on. And what happens when you're sitting on a generator applying no pressure to four survivors? four generators get popped at once.
---
Lastly, a Survive with Friends team would absolutely dominate this kind of Killer since they know where everyone is at at all times.
---
A killer of this nature would get one good hit in and then not have a power for the rest of the game.
---
Female bodybuilders dont give a shit about what you think lmao
---
Shouldn’t it have been Kate’s face photoshopped onto iron man since she’s the one who DC’d and “sacrificed herself” so that David could leave
---
Heck yeah you can still have preferences and also acknowledge that one movie might just be better as a movie.
---
I haven't explored too much so I don't have too much experience but Hellraiser has seemed very interesting and I might try that next.
---
Even if we don’t get any stranger things characters I would honestly like a demogorgon skin for the hag or something
---
But were they in the same episode?
---
It's all by chance.
---
It's a pity though as it could've been so much more! Especially with great people like Paulie being part of this!
---
I love it when people try to shrug off arguments by acting smart
---
I mean, the trapper is basically the doctor thunder to Jason voorhees' dr. Pepper.
---
Hard counter? Nah fam. I hear your footsteps boi
---
I think it doesn't matter for licensed characters as to whether they're dead or not. Laurie and Ash are alive.
---
absolute MLG Mad lad
---
The mall would be SO COOL and unique!
---
You’re still missing the point. I’m just ranting. I don’t give a shit if they are using the key. Lol what’s it take to get through that thick skull of yours.
---
If Stranger Things is going to have a chapter then we will get a bunch of newbies trying to play the game. Yay another server crash.
---
I found it campy and overrated but to each their own
---
Because it’s stupid to make a post crying about people using an item in a game lmao
---
Barb was a meme, not an actual fan favourite.
---
If you watch the whole thing for an hour you actually get to see Dwight disappear from the locker.
---
Im 100% sure new players dont know what Proxy Camping is and just cause you Call it that way, doesnt mean it exists
---
I have the same issue on ps4 too
---
Hopper in game perhaps?! YES   
---
(Steve is also acceptable)  
---
What killer though? Demogorgan?
---
Or I’m just a regular player trying to have fun?
---
I don't think anyone has DC'd on me running that. Majority of the time they are gushing in post game about how scared they were, and having a laugh about it.
---
Though I don't camp with it, and make it a point to focus on jump scares over kills.
---
To me, it's really clear what the killer could do from a stranger things perspective:  possess survivors.
---
When it finds someone, it can use its ability to possess them and attack other survivors, sending the possessed person into the upside-down where they have to do stuff to escape.
---
I'd recommend to get her. She has a playstyle similar to pre-rework Freddy, where you can infect a survivor and focus on someone else, wasting both of their time.
---
Key is not going out of your way to collect corrupt purge and knowing when to let an infected survivor go to pursue another target. Ruin and thanatophobia slows the game to a crawl with her.
---
Are you that dense? I am not crying about them using the key I am just ranting. Like I said. I’m T3 level 50 Myers and haven’t seen so many use a key before today. OPEN YOUR MIND LITTLE MAN.
---
Truth
---
There are plenty of cheats on ps4. If you want to know why you got banned send DBD support a ticket. Reddit won’t solve it.
---
[Here](https://archiemcw.github.io/roulette.html) you go.
---
If it's a solo giving it to another solo, sure because you aren't in a chase. If it's a SWFmate giving it to their SWFmate then it is toxic.
---
can we get an original killer instead?
---
If they are streaming I might run jumpscare myers. I don't mori.
---
False its not gonna be its only power bro. That's just like how people say hag is easy to beat just crouch, yet I get  3 to 4k red ranks. It's all about mind games.... 1st if that keeps survivors  away from each other that's a win in my book. No double teaming gens. Also if your a good killer you wouldn't be running directly  at them, you would act as if you were a survivor. 2nd if you read its lore it says it has abilities  of other monsters. I say each press of m2 could give it a different  power and let who ever gets hit by it he can shift into said survivor  and the survivor  looks like the killer  for 30s to 1 min
---
We are in he same region but in sure you could change the Settings to have a different region
---
well a perk like Left Behind is literally designed to only work when 3 other survivors are dead. I think they can get away with making it stronger than the usual perk keeping in mind the conditions for it to even activate.
---
I wouldn't mind if it just gave you significant boosts during the EGC while being the last survivor in the match still that helped you have a better time escaping, Bill's other 2 perks already rely on surviving harsh situations, i.e. getting slugged and unhooking while the killer is present.
---
*vigoriously smacks generator with flashlight*
---
*jabs key into hook and watches it fall apart*
---
As long as they dont add the damn demi wtf it is as the killer I'm fine with it. That shit would be the most rarded shit killer or lore wise in the game to date. Survivors I dont care because I dont know anybody in this show.
---
Bruh how could you have only met one ttv. There are so many of them on DBD, it's insane.
---
I just want 100% silence and to turn off the damn injury music, drives me nuts!
---
While people here may not say it, this will be incredibly stupid and forced
---
Aleci is just Russian Dwight i fuckin want Steve
---
This picture made me laugh more than it should've
---
I don’t think swf is that op though because most of the time they are overly altruistic. Plus, if they are really good, they would have about the same coordination if they weren’t on coms. I don’t think it would be a good idea to not allow people to have fun with their friends. Also, there are many other ridiculously unfair things in this game for both sides.
---
Dead by Disconnect!
---
Well they sure didn't make it similar. Are you sure they didn't mean they just wanted to make an entry into the same genre?
---
Sure, that won't lead to any problems whatsoever.
---
Give the killer some incentive here! Make the survivor that blonde dude from the newpaper company.
---
Idk maybe bc I didnt know to look for it until recently? I didn't grow up with any type of gaming equipment at all. We got to play with sticks outside.
---
When I started the game I played killer main first lol, but to be fair i had a lot of psuedo experience watching YouTubers play, so it didnt go too bad
---
Damn there goes my hope/dream that the Netflix collaboration was going to be the Slasher show and that season 4 of slasher would be a season long backstory for a new DBD killer
---
This subreddit doesnt like Selfie advertisement. Save yours and our time
---
Honestly its completely skippable, as of the end of season 3 nothing that happened in that episode has been relevant again except for in one 10 second flashback.
---
As much as I would hate playing that guy, watching him get morid by the demogorgon would be pretty amazing.
---
There's still a drastic difference between randoms' gen time and SWFs, though. That's not for no reason. People bringing well-stocked toolboxes and gen progress perks they know they can count on because they're voice-chatting shows a specific plan.
---
Ignoring bones is also a common symptom of gen-rushing, to the point where BHVR used it to justify NOED being a hex.
---
^**L O O P S ?**
---
For me personally, I just don't care for the concept. I'm not a fan of Stranger Things personally, but I also don't care for the way people seem to think a demogorgon could work as a killer in this game.
---
And as for a "chapter" that only introduces survivors, well the Ash chapter was and is a hot mess perkwise, and Bill still has the most useless perk in existence. 
---
So I don't see a Stranger Things chapter ending in anything but frustration in a balance sense, and I don't think pandering to popular content equals good content.
---
Got bullied like that yesterday as R20 killer by a R8 survivor lol never been so humiliated in a game
---
If they did add something from stranger things to DBD it would be the first dlc I’d buy and if only play that killer
---
Well, the worst thing about reveal in 2nd one was that it made me go 
---
&gt;!"wait, who are you?" because both characters were in the background for majority of the movie.!&lt;
---
If he is, I don’t think if I’ll ever be able to sacrifice him
---
Damn how many times have you been banned?
---
Yes, but although it was supposedly coming to Steam after a period that has already passed, the devs are suspiciously silent. Apparently they're afraid of being review-bombed.
---
You can actually still buy it by joining their Discord channel, and get games ONLY through the matchmaking channels there because nobody's playing anymore.
---
Oh you’ve gotta be shitting me. These teases are getting out of hand.
---
Write a Ticket yourself
---
He was getting bullied, but the solution definitely wasn't godlike invulnerability. Maybe just super armor.
---
Wait, PewDiePie played this game?
---
  
---
That's it, it's tainted, I'm done
---
/s
---
Usually it’s a humanoid thing like hag is the farthest thing from a human and I feel like a demogorgon is too tall maybe it would be someone who’s flayed as the killer and they have powers
---
Watch it go to Death Garden
---
The devs also said the roof bug is their main priority. I'm starting to side with the guy suing the producers. Apparently he's a legit guy.
---
You made me mad at first so thank god you clarified lol
---
BHVR posting Stranger Things stuff kinda seems like it might break NDA... but then Netflix posts stuff relating to DbD? No way that isn't a hint. This is exciting
---
Ive only done that one time as killer. I was chasing this feng around, then another survivor joined up. And I thought they were trying to take agro off the feng. But they body blocked her and got away with dropping a pallet. Letting me get her down. I thought it was just a bad attempt to help. 
---
But then they unhooked right infront of me. I smacked the feng thinking she must have borrowed time. When she didn't I left her on the ground and chased after the jerk. I brought them right to the downed feng. Let her get up and unhook/hook team, till they died. Then left her alone.
---
Post game she told me that the guy had been purposefully breaking gens she was on, and bodyblocking to trap her before I came along. So she appericated getting that person out asap. 
---
Otherwise I dont team. I find it insulting as a killer. Like, you think I need you to get kills. Nah mate.
---
Ripley as survivor would be perfect. But yeah, as mentioned, all killers in this game have once been human. All the rest might go into Deathgarden, as Terminator has
---
I'd even be happy with Bob or Alexei to be honest.
---
it's mostly girls like Feng, Meg and in a lesser measure Claudette (some head skin improve her face a lot)
---
Do you reckon it could maybe be a legion-esque deal where we get one survivor but can switch it between Steve and Nancy, as these two both seem kinda likely seeing as they were both followed by Mathieu on twitter? 
---
May just be either or, but I'd be surprised if we got two individual survivors, although they are making a pretty big deal out of the reveal.
---
I mean I think it could be both Steve and Nancy since BHVR followed both the actors on twitter very recently (and none of the other actors were followed)
---
The fact we didn’t get Sydney (sp?) is a slap in the face
---
The game can barely handle Steve's luxurious head of hair, you think it could take Billy's on top of that?
---
This aged well.
---
or Kate cry AAAAAAAAAAAOWDY ! when she gets hooked
---
I’m down for a demogorgan killer
---
To be fair its supposed to be 80's campy.
---
At this point they would have to do something big to make the new release on Steam not hated. At the very least it would have to happen with addition of a new killer.
---
People are butthurt about timed exclusivity on Epic Store that is an actual store that works, launching your game on what is mainly viewed as chat platform is a *bad* idea.
---
I think Hopper would make a good survivor. Plus using the demigorgon (sorry for spelling) would be interesting as a killer, maybe similar to how Freddy works?
---
It's a tricky balance, though. ID-V has much more powerful abilities in general. And DbD has a much more toxic community, from what I've seen. Cowboy would be a disaster.
---
If a killer wants a specific guy dead then eventually they will die
---
I was honestly hoping stranger things wasn’t coming to dbd, but apparently there’s a trailer now so that’s tough
---
I proxy camp if I know for certain someone is near or regular camp if the little toxic ball of sludge decided to teabag.
---
Killer (Cat) and Mouse.
---
Whenever I get face camped for t bagging I see it as a win for me. Killer got so tilted that he decided to throw the game to ensure that I die. Always makes me laugh
---
But I guess chapter 13 right so that’s cool
---
Okay, but everyone downvoting me doesn't seem to notice that I never said there was a mandate in place. I just said this was the strategy gen-rushers use as a means of differentiating them from regular players.
---
Oh god oh fuck watch out lil poss Michael is around
---
Big tr=big balls
---
Funnily enough, i get downvoted every time i point this out.
---
Even funnier, had some survivors yesterday say that it's "part of the game" and completely acceptable use for the disconnect button :D
---
I’m not a fanatic fan of the series but I think it’s good, I reckon the Chapter could have some potential. All I care about really are the new survivor perks tbh.
---
I’m not a fan of the show but I’m excited for those who do enjoy it to be getting this chapter!
---
Lifeguard Billy skin in the future too.
---
If all survivors are dead but one.... who is still fixing gens?
---
Season 1 is good, takes a bit to get going but ends great.  Season 2 isn't good.  They obviously didn't expect a 2nd season and hurried up making a meandering winding stories that did fan service to the first season while not doing anything to really advance the story.
---
Season 3 is quite good.
---
They could you know, change their mind. I think they specifically meant no non humanoid. No spiders, animals, etc.
---
Should be able to clip through walls too
---
I used to have the same issue. I was using a i7 3770k stock and a 680 (just about 15% faster than a 1050ti) my card was throttling from high thermals. I installed msi afterburner and set a pretty aggressive fan curve so my card would stay below or at 70 degrees. That fixed everything. (I now play on a 2080 and still use a custom fan curve)
---
I only have like 100h at the game so my perk choice is limited
---
I'd like to see OP report them, there's video proof on both sides which shows the DC was intentional and solely to give an advantage to the other survivor by abusing a game mechanic in an unintended way.
---
Sounds bannable to me.
---
Fair point. I didn’t think of Ash or Laurie
---
anything a survivor does to survive is toxic... playing with your friends, that is also toxic.. how dare anyone play swf
---
Didn't they also say that they wouldn't do a clown killer? I might be pulling that outta my ass, but idk
---
True, but it just wasn’t to my tastes. I’m still excited for the chapter though!
---
Sometimes when people really don't get it I do this
---
#/s
---
&gt;Except you bloody well can. It's the only form of cheating you can do on the current generation of consoles
---
That still use a P2P network connection. You can't with dedicated servers. You'll rubberband yourself.
---
Fixed it for you. In case you didn't know or needed more clarification on the issue.
---
I don’t want to buy more chapters atm, broke headass. I hope that there are good perks, I’ve had no update to my loadout forever
---
But every match is to improve one's rank. It doesn't matter how high it is (although I almost never see toxicity at ranks 20-16), the point is that people want more, and the other side is percieved as trying to deny them that. Of course, some people would just keep score in their heads and have that exact same spitefulness, but ranks and pips create a constant illustration and reminder of this bias system. They're exacerbators.
---
Yea your right, i just remember them saying that it would be hard for them to do non humanoid characters, ya never know!
---
bro leaving the game isn't abusing a mechanic its leaving the game.
---
Idk about your games, but the tbagging survivor is normally down in 30 seconds so if that's viewed as a win when you get face camped... then lol idk what to tell you.
---
I think the best way to deal with rage quitters without punishing people whose game crashes is to do what rust does, have your character still be in the game even if you quit, and you cant join any other game until that game ends. Oh and punish people who use the "leave game" button, bhvr CAN tell the difference.
---
Id love to have a Demi gorgan themed character but idk ab having one of the characters, I just don’t see it fitting the stranger things theme of one of the characters getting brutally murdered
---
Lmao
---
Spirit was behind a toxic cunt truly if this was played for the win I would have definitely not picked you up until the struggle meter was gone and the sacrifice  music was playing.
---
and all we get on shrine is shitty perks, then ppl say the game isn't p2w lmao
---
Normally red ranks, but at the moment it happened at rank 7. In my experience killers dc a lot more frequently at higher ranks.
---
I'd actually like if it was just a Survivor version of Fire Up, granting bonus to actions as more of the Survivors died.
---
I could see how that would cause some toxicity due to sandbagging though.
---
[Sweats in survivor main]
---
Because it only opens once the "death" is complete, when the skull icon appears on the player sprite. For regular sacrifice this doesn't trigger until the full animation is completed which is a fucking eternity. If you kill someone through mori the hatch also insta-opens
---
That’s not my experience at all so idk man.  Played in red ranks for a full season before I stopped playing for awhile and I don’t think I had any dc’s.  Meanwhile when I play survive with friends it happens pretty often at lower ranks
---
eww what if he had a flesh weapon.
---
I could also see an iron pipe or some blunt object working fine too, but he mostly used his hands
---
Lol @he doesn't know... more like he knew all along
---
Corrupt is better for killers who need to set up like Hag Trapper and maybe Freddy. 
---
Also another good combo for trappy killers is ruin and haunted grounds.
---
Ruin can be shut down at the start of the game or it can last just enough to give you a boost in the game it's really a big gamble.
---
Pop seems to work really well only on some maps for me, since some maps have long distances between gens so if you would want to get the most out of it you would need walk all the way to the high priority gen which kinda wastes time.
---
Pop works well on Freddy since he can just teleport to the gens.
---
Playing with a friend who's pretty new to the game yesterday and he burned a Lery's offering because he hadn't seen the map yet. The killer was a Pig running Amanda's Letter.
---
That’s all you can. I choose to try and revel in it for enjoyment. Mmmmmmm tasty salt.
---
There's more to it than just the appearance, though. Survivors are always slumped in the same, indistinguishable way that only really the Pig or GF can be confused for (when they're crouching). Billy'd for sure be standing upright and tall, but the veins would definitely help distinguish him.
---
It's most likely a demogorgon, though
---
No one *can* loop you if there's no one *to* loop you.
---
I would love if the killer is either the Demigorgon or “The Flayed”, and if it’s the flayed, you can basically pick a random survivor out of all the ones in the game, and you can run around as them but you have a set of unique powers. You can hide in lockers and teleport to other lockers, you can hit surviors and send them to the Upside Down (similar to Freddy’s dream world), and you can touch a generator (more with addons) and completely disable it until another gen is worked on, forcing survivors to pick different areas.
---
I understood all of the words you said individually
---
Ha the pictures like, When you're trying to figure out what made you think that bringing detective's hunch is a good idea.

Ghostface can only really get a stalk angle on you from the doorway, or from behind. There's only two points of entry, and he can only stalk from one of them. Redeye pinky clown is about as rare as clown. I see one clown and a hundred billies, spirits and nurses. If you know it's a myers(And you will, since you know when he's tiered up once), you'll be cautious
---
They're very situational and also situations you can play around(Excluding clown, but the dude's nonexistant)
---
 Im ok with any killer they release licensed or original. All I want is my cashier Carl.
---
That's a meme, he ain't comin
---
&gt;acter actress Margot Martindale as the
---
I'll be right back!
---
Joyce would be cool! We could get an older woman as a survivor.
---
Billy or the Demogorgon. It can't be the little punk ass dogs or the big guy. 
---
I just want Jim Hopper. That's it. I will pay for that the second it's on the store.
---
Theres proof here he left to abuse the hatch mechanic, not because his grandma had a heart attack. What u on about?
---
My gf said "what if its alexi" and all I could react with was a loud sobbing "NOOOOOOOOOOOOO........."
---
A crutch is an item that helps you walk better than otherwise. Nobody uses a crutch with two healthy legs. That's literally what an actual crutch is. It's intended to help you with a handicap. That handicap, in regards to selfcare, is playing solo and not being able to trust your teammates. 
---
Whenever I go without selfcare, I'm abandoned by my teammates, froced to sit on generators wounded and I end up dying way too often because my teammates cannot loop for shit, won't heal me when someone else is in a chase, and too often hide away somewhere, meaning they're a huge pain in the ass to find. Even when I stumble across one of them, there's a very real chance they'll just run away because my clumsy-ass other teammate in a chase went down in a grand total of 20 seconds.
---
No, I consider selfcare to still be useful, and as long as you're playing solo, it will until it's increased to a minute of healing. As-is, I would never recommend to anyone to drop it 'because you're wasting time' - Me not running it means YOU might get a better chance at escaping, but it does not help ME.
---
As cool as this is, I'm kinda butthurt that they're going for the obvious cash grab instead of a horror movie icon. Making a Stranger Things chapter will definitely give this game more attention and I guess that's what they're going for, I just hope they can use all that revenue to keep improving the game.
---
Her playstyle? She dominates the map. The killer gets scolded and slapped about with a slipper, even the entity is scared of gran gran
---
We didn't need another goddamn feng skin, ngl.
---
Dude doesn't care about the penalty. And even if he did, there's a 16 meter radius penalty. You have to go pretty far(Outside of the building of the basement) to avoid the penalty. You cannot safely guard the basement if you go outside of the radius, and you're more likely to get one down than two at that point because they'll be up the stairs by the time you get to them
---
LOL
---
What do you think her favorite perks are?
---
Camping is a viable strategy if you understand you cannot afford chasing survivors. 
---
As for that streamer, he rarely camps despite his nickname and he never camps without a reason or a challenge he is trying to beat.
---
I cant wait for full teams of Hopper going in lol
---
I got tired of the randoms so I main killer. I'm a new player on xbox and some people straight sacrifice your ass with a pallet and shit its dirty lol
---
Your experiences at those ranks are not universal. 
---
If they implemented a system like Overwatch did that rewards good behavior and playstyle, maybe the community could change slightly, but at this point, the community is bad and nothing will change that. The overall design of the game itself cultivates toxicity differently than other PVP games, and that’s the problem.
---
If the rumours of an upcoming change making DC'd players leave behind a "husk" are true, this will become a thing of the past.
---
You do a quick attack while they are doing an action. A lunge attack can never grab. I think they have to be injured to grab them while vaulting
---
Its crazy but it just might work
---
Hopper or Steve are the most likely
---
She picks nurse and instantly Teleports behind a Exit Gate with noed and insidious. And there she waits for her pray.. which will come .. eventually..
---
If the killer were able to down me in 30 seconds, continue to play the game and end up with a 4K, then I would feel embarrassed for t bagging. But it is very amusing when they decide to face camp. So my answer is yes I do see it as a win
---
Read what i wrote again please.
---
That isn't abusing the hatch mechanic. The mechanic is working directly as intended. The disconnecter risks a ban if they keep doing it. No one is ever getting banned for a one-off situation like this, ever.
---
Disconnecting is, quite literally, NOT playing the game. And, as it tends to do, makes the game worse for others.
---
Depends but im gunna say self care
---
She probably sippin on her coffee hust waiting
---
Nobody likes Barb, it was just a meme. I would hate if Barb was the representative for ST in DBD.
---
removed someone else has already posted this https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/crpnge/netflix_posts_three_random_pictures_of_stranger/
---
Sounds about right. It always feels like you picked the wrong day to go for a trophy
---
Just get rid of the 18 safe pallets 4Head
---
The Demogorgon is pretty humanoid though, so I think it would be fine. Demodog would be more difficult for sure though
---
I'm not sure how familiar you are with how this game works, but 4% extra speed for the killer is a LOT. If the 4man in question is just a group of casual friends playing together, that type of punishment would b ridiculous. Even worse would be a solo player being affected by such effects bc the other are a 3man.
---
Since hatch spawns regardless of amount of gens done now, no one. Maybe it was usefull in some way when you needed at least 2/5 gens done for the hatch to even spawn but now this perk literally has no use
---
Wdym we don't know what happened to Hopper? (spoilers) He died at the end of S3.
---
Countering is flat out negating something. Dealing with it *in a less painful way* does not mean countering, it simply means doing that would be less painful than if you hooked them, not negating Adrenaline at all.
---
Unless it's Alexei
---
I mean, it would have to be balanced somehow, but I'm just saying that's exactly what the creatures from the show do.
---
Everyone is thinking Billy might be the killer, but he doesn't actually have any powers.  In fact, he was just possessed.
---
plz nerf clown he got thicc fat ass that body shame Jane
---
How is it not abusing the mechanic? He's DCing in order to instantly open the hatch for his teammate.
---
So basically the killer is a shitty clown?
---
and through space
---
Could do without the huge unmarked spoilers for the movie I was planning to watch later tonight.
---
No regerts
---
Have we considered The Mind Flayer? Its ability could have something to do with taking over the mind of a survivor or morphs into a survivor and blends in then surprising them.
---
No-mither
---
Yeah I mean that’s pretty true but there’s a way to get money on PS4 pretty damn quick so ya don’t need to make micro transactions coz you getting all the money quickly
---
Everyone's saying steve, nancy, hopper, but I think it's more likely to be Sean Astin's character.
---
Many of the high ranked killers on console know that they can dc in a way where everyone loses their bps and items. So they take advantage of it when they realize they are getting no kills. Only had this happen the last months, to be fair. Assuming none of the survivors are bming the high/low rank killer, it just feels like the higher rank ones are A LOT more sour about not winning.
---
Well, I don't know what his challenge was with 4 gens left and all other survivors running away from the hook right in front of his eyes.
---
Maybe he had a bad day.
---
But then I'm wondering about all the comments on his profile calling him out for camping.
---
Cease-
---
It comes in handy most games for me since I often get killers that like to have a picnic around the hooked survivor.
---
Lmao, comments on his steam profile? That's not exactly a reputable source my guy.
---
I can see it now. They changed Freddy right. So now here's comes demigorgon. He has Freddy's old power. Instead of putting you to sleep he puts you in the upside down. Functions exactly like Freddy's old power. Behaviour couldn't let the Freddy memes die so they are going to ressurect him .
---
God I need hop or Steve as survs
---
we cant help. Tell him to send a support ticket and maybe consider not being friends with someone who is probably blatantly lying. It's really hard to get banned from this game unless you cheat.
---
Due to the the head of partnerships following the voice actors for Nancy and Johnathon on Twitter people are assuming it could be either or both :)
---
You can only run 4 perks.
---
Bbq, NOED, ruin, and nurses. Stop trying to make the already strong killers stronger. And this is a killer main saying that.
---
Repost from like...3 days ago?
---
Maybe not.
---
But I doubt EVERY comment calling him out is just a lie or written by someone who can't take a loss.
---
When fucking Hexy can be a fog whisperer I dont think there's any reason to question any of them
---
Who is that?
---
I kinda wanted it to be from Slasher too. Season 2 was the best.
---
Its confirmed by the devs they dont balance for swf, which is why theres emotes and no ingame chat, you obviously have no clue, and no he wouldnt, lol. No1 sacrifices his BP for some1 he isnt in voice with, idk what kinda friends you have who automatically DC as soon as you're the only one who's not on the ground.
---
HP and all the lovely little sausages.
---
Please, not a slenderman killer, slenderman was great when we were all 8 years old but let him die
---
That is why I main nurse. Trying to learn others though right now. I also cannot end chases for my life, Blinking ends them within seconds.
---
I heard the name before but never watched them, so I can judge.
---
Nice.
---
Then you have a bad match, feel bad, and move on. Matchmaking isn’t going to be perfect, and yeah it does suck, but you keep playing and attempting to do better each time.
---
If for some reason every single survivor that match is a god tier survivor and you’re a low-ranked killer, then it was GG from the start. But from my experience, you’ll always find a weak link amongst the team. 
---
You also just have you accept you won’t get a 4K every game, it’s not feasible. Some matches you won’t even get a kill and it happens like that. Just dust yourself off and jump into another match.
---
No I guess you're right. You know more about the rules than the developers who make the rules.
---
Wait, isn't this usually when BHVR starts teasing? What if they got Netflix to do it for them?
---
Their trollin at this point 😂😄😄, It better be Nanny Steve with the bat
---
&gt; someone always mocks me at the shack
---
T-T *sad violin music*
---
I fucking love jojo memes
---
So that's how freddy keeps hitting me over windows...
---
exactly. A lose/win situation. Imagine how good the perks would be!
---
Hierarchy - Command your ~~fellow~~ underling survivors to stop working on a gen they don't know anything about and to go get you coffee.
---
Trickster - Place killer figurines in lockers that scare your ~~bitches~~ co-workers when opened. 
---
Micromanage - If you and another ~~borderline slave~~ survivor are working on a generator you will kick them off the generator at 99%. You will gain all of the points.
---
Theres already a perk for this. It's called thanatophobia
---
... why save somebody off hook when killer is right there just to hit the rescuer and down them then hook them?
---
And if you got found first that’s just bad luck/ bad awareness (maybe use spine chill to help tel when killer is looking at you + if it’s lit up a long time, they are still facing you, probably walking in your direction).
---
I have about 15 pages combined -rep (most deleted) from this game and I almost never go out of my way to be a dick, DBD just has a lot of players that should be in therapy instead of their computer so you cant really judge someone based off profile-comments.
---
Doesn't mean you can't have perks that are at least similar to The Meta power wise to create some variation.
---
I never said it was did I? What I was saying is that it is sad that you have to use the most crutch perk in the game and literally the best killer in the game.
---
Just keep running, never wait for the killer at a pallet.
---
I even said they confirmed it, what else do you want? A direct dev response? They said multiple times on stream and forums they DO NOT balance for swf, and I'm done discussing with a peanut.
---
No0b3
---
Funny thing is, it might even help killers more than work against them. The moving around can be turned into faster movement speed while carrying a survivor.
---
Yes, I'm aware. Still, your clarification is helpful for anyone reading this thread who might not have already known, so I do appreciate the correction.
---
speak for yourself. i loved Barb and would probably main her if she were the survivor.

You're only defending this because it's some shit Jen would do lmaoooo.
---
To everyone that’s like “why kill someone with t.tv in name.” 
---
It’s because literally every game their is someone with it in their name, and they have this dream of getting big playing video games doing what everyone else does. Except they are about as entertaining as all the other streamers (not very) and also aren’t really good at the game lol. 
---
Honestly tunneling then is doing them a favor because maybe they’ll give up on their pipe dream
---
Putting t.tv in your name is a lazy way to grow your audience and it also won’t work, they have to put in actual work if they want to grow.

---
when u pull out borrowed time and its ghostface
---
I'm guessing maybe we get survivors? Will they really do one of the monsters? Or maybe Billy? Idk.
---
Same here.  A lot of them immediately check on it and tunnel you if they know you found it.
---
It's been on blu ray for 4 days. Not everyone has a theater anywhere near them. It's not hard to write "*movie* spoiler" in a title.
---
there's a reason OP blocked identifying info. posting names is considered shaming other players and is against subreddit rules.
---
Being able to potentially see the killer forever without them being able to track you at the same time is powerful and deserves to take up more than one perk slot. Powerful perk synergies take up more than one perk slot.
---
So... Billy or Billy?
---
Yeah it said “Killer stun” and still hit him
---
Outplayed
---
Ohhh. If it is a repost then I’m terribly sorry. I just saw it on google and thought it would be good to reupload.
---
when u take spine chill off for one game and its a ghost face
---
Boxers &amp; MMA fighters of all races/ethnicities are known for wearing corn-rows/braids during training and combat. I agree that it would be odd to see Meg wearing that hairstyle for a street-wear or casual outfit, but it makes sense in the context of the cosmetic. Looks terrible, but makes sense.
---
I don't have friends though
---
Bröther may I have some
---
I mean yeah it's boring but it's part of the game. Doesn't justify DCing.
---
Personally i try to play "fair" in survivors' perspective so i rarely slug and idc about kills or getting 4k, i just want BP and fun for all :P
---
watch the survivor be someone insignificant like Barb lmao
---
I mean I think they have gotten the best of the movie killers. I'd like to see them do something classic like a werewolf or vampire or something. Even a video game cross over like Resident Evil or Silent Hill would be cool too.
---
Is not use this because as soon as the Survivor run she could shift back and get them. Also survive with friends who use communication wasn't meant to be from the start so almost any of it takes power from the Killer. Because in what survivor horror-thriller do you get to look 360 Degrees around you and look around corners before you actually walk them.
---
I've been playing maybe 2months yes it's repetitive. They need to add something else for us to grind or lvl up. Bp alone ain't that much fun.
---
Amazing edit
---
Poggers
---
wouldnt be super hard to tell there fake tho
---
Amusingly, that's exactly how Ghostface plays in game, too.
---
Either it's a huge surprise or you saw him a mile away and it does nothing.
---
That's some real meta right there.
---
I pull this build on steamers and tune in to hear their reactions, Myers mains rise up!
---
The simple fact that it takes her red staying away and makes her as small as a Survivor would play Mad mind games with the survivors.
---
Platform: Ps4
---
Bug: Just spectated a game, I had gotten Moried,  a surv was darting around the map, sprinting constantly for half the game.  whilst exhausted.  Said it happened after they vaulted a pallet.  The Killer was The Legion.
---
When the Halloween DLC came out, we were in a different film continuity where Laurie had died.
---
If I stumble upon someone fixing a gen, am I supposed to just go work on another one? 
---
BVHR just recently [released statistics](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/)  in May showing that a larger party size doesn’t have show a significant increase in individual survival rate so it’s not like SWF’s make that big of a difference.
---
Object of Obsession, Adrenaline, DS, and Balanced. She's hardcore and wants the killer to know it.
---
Hell when I'm Huntress and I get bloodlust one with beasts of prey on and lose my red stain most survivors can't even locate her get a loan someone shaped like themselves
---
I was sending it to the person i was playing with
---
Poeple holding the game hostage and cheaters and so on
---
I agree. Very cool
---
I really do and am hoping for this stranger things add I’d love to see what their thinking for killer/survivor if they’re actually doing Stranger Things. I say if but after that fan art they tweeted I’m starting to get real 7% haste while these exit gates are powered
---
Good survivors will remember fake pallets and come back to throw them down, it is especially beneficial to see where your dream pallets are going down when versing good survivors. I see the purpose in the aura reading.
---
Just close the game then
---
Whenever I’m feeling burnt out like this it helps me to play a couple games more stealthily/out for myself. Claudette with spine chill, deliverance, ds &amp; either adrenaline or iron will usually.
---
Another person doing no mither to rank 1?
---
 I tip my hat from 1 legend to another
---
Ikr the dude literally sacrificed all his blood points to deny someone else a few blood points its legit, i play killer and i aint trippin whem ppl do this their loss lol.
---
That’s like wanting an Ash vs the Evil Dead DLC but not adding Ash as a survivor, or a Halloween DLC without Laurie as the survivor. Why would you give an irrelevant character that barely lasted any time at all in the series all of the spotlight, rather than the main characters that everyone would love.
---
I always feel bad about it but at the same time it's just a game fuck it
---
That 4 minutes as the killer is right next to both. Not even a factor in this example.
---
It's pretty much confirmed, Netflix did a teaser post on their twitter too.
---
The thing that kills me is that my throws were legitimately some of the most basic throws I've ever done, these are throws that a rank 20 could probably land. Like the chat says half of them were literally point blank, the others were like 10-15 feet away with no obstacles. I'm so baffled as to how they thought i was hacking, my only guesses are trolling or lagging
---
The Netflix tweet confirms this, we good!
---
Yep I did it a few seasons back before the change to exhaustion and figured I’d do the whole experience again with the updates and balance changes to see if it’s any harder. It’s really a fun challenge. Really forces you to learn how to buy time.
---
Oh really I didn’t know Netflix did too
---
You just randomly started recording the whole match? Just curious.
---
No clue Netflix did it too :D
---
You must be a bad killer main then, any **real** killer main wants new usable perks to spice things up, not power creep.
---
i'm just saying that "nobody liked Barb" is incorrect.
---
No, the reveal in the 2nd one was complete trash. If the 3rd's reveal wasn't so OUT THERE, the 2nd would be the worst. My spoiler was for the 4th movie, sorry if that got mixed up and confusing lol but yeah, I agree. I think 2 is a great movie but the deaths of Randy and Sydney's best friend (I forgot her name) make it where I don't even wanna watch it. They both didn't even have a fighting chance either cause the got snuck 😢 (never really put that into perspective with ghostface's ability in dbd til just now).

Killer

3 images from stranger things, no context was given for these aside from a skull and a rat emoji. Each had a quote, and in order, the pictures had the words "dead" "by" and "daylight"

---
Right. Let's be a shitheel and start insulting. The comment made has "survivors are too strong" stink all over it.
---
She's quite literally the strongest killer in the game and it isn't even close.  This statement is delusional.
---
The same is true for the killer side too. This community is full of immature people.
---
Killers have to be originally human.
---
Currently waiting for Paulie to cover this.
---

---
Almost makes me hard
---
A game is not always fun, especially when you are facing other people.
---
Actually, being condescending and "apologizing" to someone because you think they don't know something is in fact, what being a dick is.
---
Sorry you're mentally handicapped, otherwise you would've understood that very obvious thing. If you would've been let outside as a child instead being beaten to a cripple, you might've learned how social interaction works.
---
New mechanic in the game. While playing against Jason when his rage is active, he can destroy windows. Making that loop broken.
---
I actually kinda like that... 🤝🏽 
---
Imagine just walking around looking for your next generator and seeing half the map destroyed from Jason getting rid of windows.
---
There are concrete stats tracked by steam as to how many players there are (on PC, the platform with the most players). I apologize for not providing a source, I just assumed the steam stats were kind of common knowledge with how often I see them referenced on here.
---
You're suggesting a mode which eliminates the motivation to "try hard", but that is already what we have. There are currently only punishments for ranking up, not rewards. The mode we have is nearly already the casual mode you envision (it just tries a little tiny bit to make the matches fairer), and it is terrible.
---
Presently, when people seem to be playing to rank up, they are actually playing to "win" (whatever that means to them as an individual) b/c it feels good to them when they "win". They then usually rank up, as what most people consider "winning" in this game necessarily fulfills the emblem requirements. This is why you see people deliberately de-ranking. Many players do not actually want to rank up, they just want to stomp every single game. In doing so, they often rank up, and then they are faced with more fair matches, which motivates them to de-rank.
---
There is nothing to take away from ranked to make it more casual. There are no in-game rewards already, just personal, human ones. You can't stop people from releasing endorphins when they stomp the other team. People will exclusively use Casual to stomp the suckers that thought they would have a relaxing game until no one but the toxic players themselves remain using that mode. With no easy players to stomp, they will return to ranked. Then maybe the cycle repeats a few times till they remove the mode. In the meantime, the queue times skyrocket in both modes, due to the playerbase being fractured.
---
This is a Bad Idea.
---
I mean. I run different perks.
---
I usually play GF with unrelenting/tremors/sloppy butcher/ nurses. I get at least 2 kills a game and I hover around rank 9.
---
I just don't understand how this community defends tunneling and camping when the killers have super strong perks and abilities. Do they just expect they're supposed to 40k EVERY game?
---
This just happened to me. I'm rank 13 and had a game against a few high rank survivors. I had ebony mori but I could barely hook anyone because everytime id try to they'd all crouch in front of it or sabo it. I would constantly be teabagged, pointed at, pallet looped. I get that you're good but why do you gotta be a dick about it? There was one massive troll that I was close to hooking but managed to fuck it up. But I managed to Mori one guy in the end at least. 
---
I think it's kinda fucked how a survivor can go up the ranks by just generally being a dick. But that's the game I guess.
---
Top 10 anime attacks
---
I’m an airhead and don’t understand the joke. Did the killer have a trap on the stairs? Someone explain it to me because this wooooshed over my head lol
---
Just figured I would throw in the extra bit because it's impossible to lag switch on dedicated servers without rubberbanding yourself back to the position that you initiated the lag switch at. It really only hurts the one trying to lag switch.
---
Even if they're not using a true lag switch and instead using up all their bandwidth to undermine the game and put everyone at a disadvantage, he's still exploiting the network to gain an advantage.
---
To make that easy for people to understand. TLDR: he's still cheating.
---
I fail to see the problem
---
Clown has a nice ass lmao
---
But when it easily could be, it should be.
---
According to my calculations about September 3rd if they stick to their current formula
---
Intentional.
---
it's a thing
---
There are theories that he might have survived but its only theories and nothing confirmed.
---
The Kill Count is soo good.
---
I didn’t defend tunneling or camping tho. If you don’t use the meta stuff you’re putting yourself at a disadvantage when it comes to higher ranked games. So it would be nice to use something else imo.
---
I can’t believe it’s only been 3 days. They need to refresh the shrine more often if they’re going to offer such lackluster perks every single week.
---
omg exactly, i feel so threatened, hes trying to steal my position as thiccest bitch around
---
alright, then how about a legion? Arguably the most hated killer in the game. Also, it isn’t difficult to mind-game a nurse
---
Real easy to reduce Bubba into a m1 killer. All he has going for him is the ability to down two survivors in one go, and the few times you get two together like that are at hooks and the basement. Anytime I see a survivor hooked in his basement, I can almost always expect him to never be too far from them, or just be straight up be sitting in there while using insidious.
---
As far as I know, there are very few situations where you LITERALLY cannot win.
---
Even if you lose, you can still just play the game for fun. Even with cripplingly low odds you'll win, you can still try and have fun...
---
TT is an amazing perk. The only good Ghostface perk.
---
Until his buff, freddy was the same way
---
This is me playing against a obviously high rank nurse after the rank reset, i felt like a burden to my team, she was reading me like a book lmao
---
You're a week late and a dollar short. Just sayin.

Ace thought Trapper didn’t see him in the locker. 
---
Trapper put a trap down away from stairs, ignoring the lockers.
---
Ace turns while going downstairs and sees Trapper watching him, knowing he was there all along.
---
I'm just pointing out that the attitude between the devs and players in this game heavily babify the killers
---
I suppose he could be in the Upside Down but those guys out there with him got vaporized. So I assumed.
---
I usually wait behind a rock for a sec for the killer to come check on it first.
---
Thank you! I didn’t notice the trapper at the end!!
---
You have little to no understanding or the game if you don't believe Nurse is the strongest killer in the game let alone the absurdity that is you even mentioning her with Basement Bubba in the same sentence.  You sincerely have to be trolling us because nobody disputes Nurse being hands down the best killer in game.
---
Console has an issue where the killer gets into the radius of a survivor and the survivor lags extremely frequently, I know its not a connection issue because I run 500 mbps as well as play with others of varying internet speeds and they all run into this issue. So this makes looping, dodging, and running from the killer damn near impossible. I get hit when on my screen I am at least 5 or more feet from any killer not just one or some, all the killers with the exception of clown because I do not own the DLC or just because no one uses him. Then after getting hit the killer appears next to me, I spend most games trying to completely avoid the killer just so I don't have to deal with this. 
---
Also not a bug but dwight is unnaturally slow compared to other survivors, when I try to use him escaping is difficult just because of his sheer slowness.
---
You had an entire theater run to watch it, my dude. I'm surprised you haven't seen spoilers sooner.
---
If we get any shirtless killer it better be Myers
---
Technically yes but at the end of the day, you get to play how you want. Being pissed off because of TBags is long gone in the past of my DBD experience. Personally in this situation I would camp him (all gens done) but giving a pseudo opportunity for survivors to try and unhook. Obviously I wouldn't chase someone who is within distance of making to the exit but if someone leads me away from the hooked guy and also the exit gates, I would chase him. As long as I can get more BBQ stacks I am happy. If you don't have BBQ, just try and see if you can get multiple people down.
---
There is a lot more to DBD than just defending generators, specially when survivors are Altruistic.

We saw them get vaporized but I don't think we saw him get the same treatment. I really can't remember but I don't think it was shown. And at the end the Russians had those prison cells and said something about an American. I feel like he could be who they were talking about.
---
Oh my god yes
---
Hated because he's boring not because he's strong. There's a reason you mostly see nurses at red ranks you know. Yes you can mind game nurses, I never said you couldn't. But she's still the strongest killer in the game. She has a steep learning curve though so if it ain't someone who is good at nurse then yeah they are easy but good nurses aren't easy at all. I'm interested in what rank you are talking about to be honest.
---
Why? Just because they have been in the past doesn't make it a hard rule.
---
It isn't me or my friends personal opinion lol.  It's the entirety of the dbd community and every leading streamer that plays this games unanimous opinion that she is the strongest and it isn't even debatable.  You may not be best playing her personally that doesn't mean she isn't the strongest killer in game.  She breaks every mechanic survivors have for chasing a killer.  A good nurse consistently wins their games.  Most viable killer at red ranks by a large margin.
---
If dbd is going to introduce Jason they can't do what the Friday the 13th game did.
---
Lol it is not amazing
---
I’d rather have Jason Vorhees for new killer :/
---

---
No, what we are experiencing is knowledge based on playing the game. Nothing to do will just following what everyone else says. Any killer can be strong in the right hands but every killer gets looped apart from nurse. A good nurse will have everyone dead faster than any other killer out there. In my opinion Billy is the 3rd strongest killer in the game but against survivors that are compitent and he still gets looped. Nurse doesn't.
---
Maaaan wouldn’t we all.
---
But the lore! /s
---
They can’t add that speedo Ace. I have enough trouble playing as killer with two hands.
---
As a baby hag, this is the most satisfying thing that has ever occurred in this game.
---
So Demogorgon? But I'm not sure having an interdimensional creature like that would fit the serial killer theme
---
You mean Thrilling Tremors, one of the best perks in the game, arguably even better than BBQ?
---
I'm all Ears can be used for locating P3 Claudettes who fast vault and disappear.
---
Also thanks for your username, I don't always feel supported by reddit and your support means a lot
---
Got it, thanks
---
Rarely does more than one person survive a slasher film, and if it's more than one, they're usually like less than 10 percent of a large cast, the others having been slaughtered helplessly.
---
So pretty much everybody
---
ok
---
Killer with pretty strong perks, survivor with one strong perk but it will get nerfed, or no strong perks at all and the update will simply contain additional survivor nerfs.
---
Hi ! , Here are some of the concept for killers that i been working on.
---
probably more to come .
---
let me know in the comments what skins for the killers would you like to see.
---
Thanks !.
---
Can legs be positioned in a more awkward stance? Possible glitch.
---
It's whatever, everyone has different opinions on what's toxic or not.
---
Yeah I'm aware but now DCers have to deal with reloading the game again instead of just getting to start searching again
---
If Steve doesn’t have his ahoy outfit as a costume you can buy I’m going to be disappointed.
---
Nurse can literally teleport through walls, negating the chase mechanic entirely. If you don’t understand how that makes her the strongest killer in the game, you don’t understand the game at all.

---
Speaking from experience there are more than enough Rank 20s in the world, though to be honest I don't disagree with your idea of perhaps adding a gen or two if the difference in ranks is too big.
---
I mean I think it'll be a good addition because they'll add variety to the roster
---
Too situational and specific to be a good all around perk.
---
They kept having him stare at the open breach, I'm pretty sure he chose to go there instead of dying.
---
Not in my opinion, I really use it alot, it helps with mindgaming too.
---
Thrilling tremors is better for info on map pressure killers these days than BBQ because everyone hops in lockers, and I'm all ears is stupid fuckin' strong on both nurse and huntress..... so?
---
I still quite vividly remember my first Killer experience with this game. It wasn't as extravagant as you but it was debatably just as bad. Went into a match as no perk Trapper (this was before Killers started with their 3 teachables) and got gen rushed to shit while I put traps in random patches of grass like a 4head. Match ended and there was a Rank 12, two Rank 10s, and a Rank 15 against my Rank 20 no-perk-having ass.
---
Pretty much didn't touch Killer after that until I got like 5 Survivors to Level 50.
---
I’m always on board for another Adam cosmetic! He’s already got some good ones, but the more the merrier!
---
Most likely Black Friday
---
Gens being done so quick is why it's gonna be hard to get any fun mechanics for killers put in.  By the time you getthe mechanics set up and going, gens are nearly done.  Hope they can find a way to improve this.
---
i feel naked without spinechill
---
Would've liked the skin way more if they actually made Meg buff.
---
Would've differentiated it from the 5893758917612978 other sporty Meg skins.
---
Yeah. It put me off of playing killer for such a long time. The worst part is when they are clearly higher ranks than you and exploiting the matchmaking to go against low rank killers. And then they decide it's fine to shit talk in the post game chat or send you purposefully hurtful messages. Honestly I don't see why they take so much pleasure in ruining the game for new players. The game will never grow if that is the case and eventually they'll run out of people to bully
---
What about the horror story narrator pizza?
---
Man I remember seeing this way back when. Still funny now though.
---
Problem #8358972357259807982037589237 with Head On
---
-Signed, a Jane ~~and Clown~~ main
---
The DLC was on the summer sale actually, but I assume there will be another one on Halloween
---
Just slide to the left, now slide to the right!
---
Ash and Ghostface were referred to as Chapters. Both of them arrived alone, with no map. I haven't seen anything official about the content that will be coming.
---
Almost all of Meg's pants are either leggings or garbage bags. She can't just get some nice looking jeans or shorts. Everything she wears has to be very brightly colored for the most part as well. **Haha get it it's red like her hair. Give us money.**
---
I don't know why they need to make her look like she's from South Jersey or the ghetto. Her hair has to either be a buzz cut or cornrows and dreadlocks. Things that look awful on a redhead. Plus meg gets like 90% of the female cosmetics despite having the most base cosmetics and free Cosmetics as well as the most purchasable ones.
---
The four main survivors all have variety and their default clothing meaning people are less likely to buy Cosmetics for them. Then you have people like Jeff or Jane who legit just have a slightly different undershirt and people like Feng or David who never get cosmetics
---
My ghost face is level 9
---
Its truly amazing how Redditors think they know more about the rules of the game than the fucking devs of the game.
---
How uncomfortable do you think it would be for someone like Joe Keery to play DbD and see himself get mori'd by the Hag?
---
&gt;blu ray for 4 days
---
Damn it's already out in some places of the world? I will still have to wait until 5th of September till the bluray comes out.
---
Owh
---
Maybe then I'll be able to get the "blood on your face" trophy. Someone always dcs on me.
---
😂😂😂
---
How sway, I’m ranked 12 survivor and the killer is never worse than rank 14.
---
I’m a bad killer and have a tough time tracking players but I did get some good use from all ears
---
Killer is literally playing a low tier killer on an extremely survivor favored map vs a 4 man swf. How dare he perform well
---
They said they want to stick to humanoids, not just humans, meaning the Demogorgon is very likely
---
makes a lot more sense
---
And if someone disconnects in the first 5 minutes of the match the Killer should T-Pose, Mori all other Survivors, and get 8 times the maximum amount of Bloodpoints and 500 Survivor Puddings.
---
No0b3, he started using a facecam recently so his fans can see his reactions while playing outlast.
---
And yet mysteriously still no proof

---
Yeah.
---
I would pay all of the dollars for a Wraith Funko Pop!
---
As a Trapper main you don't know how satisfying this is.
---
Also to this day probably one of the most satisfying things I've ever done is stand AFK in front of a trap while the gates were open. Jake Park slowly walks up to me while teabagging (this is before End Game Collapse was added) and then steps in my trap. Hook him and turn 0 kills into one kill.
---
Tirade of salt in post-game chat while the rest of his team just laughed and called him a toxic idiot.
---
The wrait should have the burning at his feet like when he apears/disappears
---
It's Natalia Dyer and Charlie Heaton dating. Not Joe Keery.
---
and some purp drank
---
I didn't insult anyone lmao! I said this was something she would do. That's a far cry from calling me a dumbass. It's just a video game ya dweeb.
---
And it's three minutes not four.
---
It's amazing how you think something they can't deal with yet is totally cool to do just because they can't stop it yet
---
Nobody is on your side, just stop
---
I think I heard of the devs get video proof of someone DCing for things like this then they will ban them
---
yeah, post chat is a blessing and a curse. There are plenty of nice people too, but the nasty ones can be pretty damned nasty too
---
HAHAHAHA. That was RIGHTEOUS!
---
Actually, the closest thing they have is follow the basic reddit rule of 10:1 main post to submitted post and he's been doing just fine on that. Even if he wasn't, the content he posts is really in depth and should be posted man
---
Bring Steve and give me an Aleci outfit for Dwight. And Eleven outfit for Nea.
---
Or, make my dreams come true and give me Barb as the suvirvor.
---
Licensed Survivors seem to be dead or near death though, yeah? So it'd  have to be bob, barb or alexei
---
It would be good if the cooldown wasn't so obscenely long.
---
Hes just kinda. A greasy slimy boy. We already have Quentin and he gives me the same vibes.
---
I liked season 2 better than season 3. 3 was SO painfully boring until halfway through it.
---
Haven't seen his stream yet today.  
---
Absolutely adore that dude tho
---
The "negative" thing I said didn't warrant being called a dumbass. You think because you're a streamer you can just say what you want but the truth is the world doesn't work that way. You need to learn to act your age instead of throwing tantrums like a 12 year old.
---
I keep getting messages like “gg baby Myers”, “EZ baby Myers” (when I play as the shape), why are they calling me a baby? I am just playing normally, not camping or doing anything antagonistic, I am definitely a casual player but I’m not *awful*. It’s off-putting getting messages, but the game is so much fun otherwise.
---
You just opened my eyes and I’ll never see Claudette without thinking she used way too light and way too much concealer
---
If you have it tier 3 it's less than a minute... 
---
How often do you get in a chase my boy?
---
What the fuck are you talking about
---
You're free to think athletic people are unattractive just like we're free to think you're probably a fat, disgusting slob :D
---
I ruin that
---
Yeah guys, let's get Nancy!
---
*I say sadly, as nobody else apparently wants Barb*

Does anyone have links any of the other hits to a stranger things dlc that people are mentioning
---
* Platform: PC
---
* Type of Bug: Ingame
---
* Description: As killer, tried to pick up the last survivor at the very end of the overtime and the game kinda bugged. I wasn't able to interact with anything and was only able to use melee. When meleeing the body of the survivor that should be on my shoulder did some glitchy movement and proceeded to lie on the ground, most likely not being able to move. The game didn't end at all - had to leave the game to end the match for everyone.

Yo is this for real?! Damn I wouldn't mind a dead by daylight show on Netflix. I don't care how bad the story and acting could be I just know it can't be worse than death note
---
No proof doesnt mean I'm wrong, you would have to find proof that it doesnt exist in all the hundreds of dev streams there to proof that I am actually wrong. It's a lawyers saying :) Something along the lines of "You're not guilty (wrong) until there's evidence you are. So you should provide proof to me that I am in the wrong. I'm definitely not looking through countless of streams to look for 15 seconds of chattering, for you.
---
That's some good points, perhaps itll just be a survivor then instead of a killer and survivor content.
---
I mean....survivor...Steve or Hopper!?
---
Killer....the Demogorgan? Billy? This would be a really interesting update.
---
What stream is that from? He hasn’t streamed in weeks lol.
---
It speeds up
---
“completely acceptable use for the disconnect button” 
---
Someone is going to be VERY disappointed when dedicated servers come and they start penalizing people for that.
---
Have to agree with you now that I think about it
---
That's not how it works at all. The burden of proof of on you. The claim being made is that DCing for hatch is bannable.
---
Finally a serious suggestion
---
*sad Barb noises*
---
Only if you combine it with Head On so you can Deliverance to a locker, DS the killer, then Head On the killer. Then blind him.
---
Kinda doubt predator since there was that reveal for the game at E3 this year
---
Hrrrgh Entity, I'm trying to head on but the clown is dummy thick and the clap of his ass cheeks is louder than mine😩
---
Stranger Things is as big, if not bigger, than Game of Thrones.
---
Everyone knows this show. So yea a Stranger Things chapter would be the best thing to ever happen to the game, popularity wise.
---
Pretty sure the "lore" takes the backseat in these scenarios.
---
Im all ears beats quick and quiet and dance with me
---
Tremors stops gen progress and lets you know where people are
---
Furtive chase is kinda meh but helps with mind games and combos with other perks nicely (remember me being my first thought) 
---
None of which I would say are unusable
---
Hope fully the maps indoors. I feel like we don't have many of them
---
&gt;hecking
---
   
---
YOU SWORE!!!
---
I've gotten every adept since they made it harder on my first try, except Plague which took 2 or 3 tries. If you're having trouble derank to 15 or w/e.
---
I'm at 97% trophy completion, most trophies are boostable with some patience and late night gaming sessions.
---
Report and send the pic, it’s an easy ban.
---
Was a joke anyhow. I agree he obviously should not be the character~
---
Everyone would go back to the game if they hear about so I hope ppl make a big deal of it, as to make memes in normal subreddits and maybe make it to hot, ima try when I get enough karma (I alredy have 457 karma and can’t post yet)
---
well should have hooked the dude.. sluggers get punished is todays lesson my dude
---
No, you even said yourself your friends would DC for this, so its not a one time thing, you're disagreeing with yourself, and now suddenly you agree dcing multiple times is bannable and you dont even need to report for it. Yes, you dont, reporting is for things such as verbal abuse, you can also report for dcing, but it wont matter. Unless you keep getting the same killer/swf team who dc, then it actually does. Its there for context, but whatever.
---
Please no.  We have too many tards playing this game as is.  People who like Stranger Things are braindead.
---
How do I upvote more then once?
---
I think (?) the devs have said something about once dedicated servers hit, survivors' bodies will become "husks" that will be hookable if they DC.
---
I blame Otz
---
mmMMMMMMMMMMMmrmrmrmrmrmmrrrrmmmm
---
Wait till you learn about mirrors
---
Nice alt scott

What trio even is this

This is my post though

---
Oh, so I was right. Thank God, this has been needed for quite a while now.
---
Oh my god, well done.
---
I'm sure that turned that Trapper's frown upside down.
---
well its pretty much fully confirmed at this point, so good luck with that.
---
Yeah, the survivors I play against loop. And maybe it helps with mind games, but it has a chance to help with 1 mind game every 40 seconds. Like I said, the perk concept is fine, the 40 second cooldown is ridiculous.
---
*X-Files theme intensifies*
---
Yea but Billy didn't kill anyone in the season so i don't know how it will fit
---
You are right, and the main reason for that is due to how much more current stranger things is than their other licenses.
---
Not to mention that (if the rumors are true) survivors' bodies will become "husks" and remain hookable, thus forcing them to accept that no, the DC button's purpose is *not* for stuff like this.
---
Again Wtf. This whole thread is about the person in this clip getting banned for DCing. It may be the only time hes ever done it. If he did it 50 times he would get banned. He wouldnt get banned for abusing the hatch, hed get banned he repeatedly disconnected, which is against the rules. The sole act of DCing for hatch is not. How are you not getting this
---
It would if they devs didn't give survivors a month and a half to make it to the exit gates during the collapse. The collapse is literally worthless unless you
---
A) spend the entire time taunting the killer far away from the gate 
---
B) open the gate when someone is getting hooked then mount an overzealous rescue operation that collapses because the killer just keeps hooking people
---
Honestly would it seriously harm the game if they actually put some real time pressure on survivors during the collapse?
---
As if the reason people have issues with SWF is because random ass strangers are playing with their friends.
---
I didn't say only for mind games.
---
It's more to get those fricking P3 Claudettes. 
---
Those motherfrickers.
---
Probably another teaser on 21st? Followed by PTB on 27th. Two weeks of PTB and release on 17th?
