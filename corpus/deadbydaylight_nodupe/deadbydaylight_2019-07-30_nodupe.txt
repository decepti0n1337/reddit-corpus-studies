Agreed.
---
stop plugging your shit here
---
I only see "Gen-Rushing" when you get something like four survivors all with purple toolboxes, socket swivels, clean rags, prove thyself, resilience, and No Mither flying through gens absurdly fast and 3 gens pop by the time the killer gets his first down.
---
If it would take you an hour to catch someone on Lery's, its not the map.
---
Entity Displeased.
---
Ah.
---
Gen Rushing isnt a thing.
---
Surprisingly I got this trophy (twice) on fractured cowshed
---
Again, what "condition" (now we're using this term to gaslight) is there for the best survivor perks?
---

---
Dead Hard: have to be injured which happens anyway during a chase NOT unless you're facing a one-shot killer. In which case you could just stay injured in order to use Dead Hard.
---
Self Care: infinite heals.
---
Sprint Burst: insane burst of speed when running. Can only walk BUT the vast majority of maps are small enough where it doesn't matter.
---
Lithe: vault and you get an insane burst of speed.
---
Balanced Landing: fall from a decent height (not even two stories mind you) and get another insane burst of speed. Not really "conditional" not unless the map is Lery's. 
---
Adrenaline: once all gens are completed, get healed, can pick yourself up when downed, and receive a massive burst of speed AND if you've been hooked and get un-hooked after gens are done you still get Adrenaline. 
---
Borrowed Time: guy on the hook gets away for free, can be difficult to down hook rusher not unless you use a one shot killer. 
---
Unbreakable: a little more situational, I give you that, but completely counters slugging as a strategy.
---
&gt; And I've been rank 1 killer
---
I don't believe you. What you're saying makes no sense at all and it just comes off as mental gymnastics. 
---
&gt;I hope you realize that you're just bad st the game soon
---
And now you go for this petty "Well, you say this because you're just bad!" Argument. Doesn't matter what I say, you'll just continue to gaslight and live in your own reality. Doesn't matter that I hit rank 1 with the revamped Freddy. You bring up this utter nonsense "It's called EXHAUSTION. do I need to spell it out for you?" And again, WHAT. IS. THE. DOWNSIDE? 
---
If a guy uses Dead Hard and that guaranteed he made it to a safe pallet that let him get away where it's now impossible to get this guy because now -because of Dead Hard- they made it to another loop or made it to the Hatch/Gate? Where is the downside? Do you get penalized in any possible way? 
---
Let me hit you up with this: imagine if BBQ could show me the aura of every player on the map no matter where they are, no matter how close they are to a hook, wherever they're hiding, and it counters any kind of perk that counters aura-reading perks. And ask me "Well, where's the downside to BBQ?" And I say "It's conditional. I have to hook someone first." 
---
That's what you're doing whether you realize it or not that is exactly what you're doing.
---
I had one DC because I found her just after the game started. So because she had a stroke of bad luck, none of us will get to enjoy the game
---
To the bubba bone
---
Something tells me OP wants R20 survivors in a red ranks environment.
---
God damn, son—putting in work!
---
Yes I do it’s @austinmesler on insta and Twitter I’m also on YouTube www.youtube.com/asseenbyaustin
---
Me today.
---
For some reason I've gotten more devour hope kills with Clown than anyone else
---
This is less the fault of OP or Survivors and more an issue with the game design. You're correct, doing secondary objectives draws out the game and earns you more BP, but because it contributes little to nothing to the primary objective, it becomes a low priority. When you're up against a Killer who's putting down serious pressure, there is no time to do secondary objectives without being a bad teammate. 
---
Bloodpoints alone aren't enough of an incentive if the action barely contributes to the game. If you're not on a gen, running the Killer, saving a teammate, or healing a teammate, you're making it that much less likely that you'll escape. This is what OP means by time efficiency, and why the point system does such a poor job reflecting skill. BHVR has always struggled to effectively measure and reward what it is that contributes to a successful match. Instead we have a point system that rewards you for completing a checklist of actions that may or may not be in the best interest of your team. Either secondary objectives need to have more of an impact, or things like keeping the Killer busy or being a reliable gen jockey need to be rewarded better. 
---
The point system and the actual game proper seem to be at odds with each other. I'd like to see dull totems worked in to more Killer perks as a way of making them relevant. Right now the biggest reason to cleanse them is the *chance* of NOED, and that simply isn't enough. If more Killer perks were powered by number of dulls, or procced similarly to NOED, then Survivors would have better reason to proactively cleanse them vs. re-actively.
---
I miss him ;( R.I.P
---
I have another one where I blinded him from like 50 feet away from running across the map. Been getting super lucky with clutch moments lately. ☺️
---
This is why my queue times take forever, POS like you who can’t stand the idea that my shroud of separation could possibly be a mori and quit.
---
i dont agree, ruin can be destroyed, each person can do thier own gen with discordance, tinkerer is almost usless cause 99% of the time the gen is done, suveillance is a good perk but is really limited
---
Flashlight spam and tea-bagging can be good psychological warfare tactics tho, exploiting one of the biggest advantage of survivors : They're 4 vs 1 killer. It can be intimidating to be facing 4 brains alone.
---
Even if the killer doesn't fall for the bait, one or more survivors acting very cocky can quickly attack his self-confidence, pushing him to make mistakes.
---
I'm not denying the fact that teabag is toxic btw, I hate it too, I'm just discussing its potential uses outside of just being an asshole.
---
You can get them from a sub-reddit called /r/PerkByDaylight
---
hmm, i don’t know, maybe because it’s written by 12 year olds with no game design knowledge?
---
Odd flex but ok
---
franklins doesnt do much cause they can go pick it back up and if i hit 1 survivor there are still 3 more
---
We got them.
---
Wierd flex but ok
---
Hi, I’d like to add you. PSN name is juicycherub and I’m rank 11!
---
no killer.......??
---
I am prepared to get Trapper fixed whether they want him to be or not.
---
ive legit never heard of insidious camping a box, that is a cancer on another level lol
---
Yeah, there's generally enough time to get away. If you're doing a gen you should always be aware of at least 2 escape options around you.
---
Fair enough!, lol any perks for Frank West ?
---
If you hate it so much bring NOED. I dislike using the perk and refuse to use it on Nurse (Who I am potato at) explicitly to avoid bad habits, (I only use it on Wraith and LF because they're weak as shit, or the classic NOED + Remember Me + Fire Up + Blood Warden endgame build) but it is technically a "Counter" to gens being done too quickly.
---
no idea
---
This sounds exactly like a game i played a few days ago, however I was the killer and ended up wiping them without noed. I did chase this one girl for what seemed forever and eventually caught up and during that time 0 gens were done. Post chat was funny.
---
Im debating what this comment was intending to convey...
---
I think this is more due to the killer being bad than anything else. There is no reason why that blind should have worked.
---
&gt;80 seconds per gen is long enough;
---
It really isn't. 
---
 if you’re struggling to find survivors or ending chases in a timely manner, you either need to re-evaluate your perk load-out or your chasing habits.
---
I like that there's an assumption made (really just a passive aggressive way of insulting me because you don't like what I'm saying) that if I make balance suggestions that I must be bad at the game. No mention whatsoever that the balance is a known issue. No acknowledgement whatsoever (that I made in the OP post) that killers need Ruin and Ruin is easily countered. No acknowledgement whatsoever of there being a problem, it must be, I have to be quiet and survivors are perfectly balanced and never do anything wrong ever and behave like perfect little angels.
---
I see what you mean, and again I’m not trying to defend either side really. I’m just saying you came saying survivors deny gen rushing but complain about NOED. Then you complain about gen rushing but deny any issues with NOED lol. Well complain isn’t really the word I’d use.....make a point rather. But I agree with you, there is not really anything that can be done about NOED. I play as a survivor and if we get hit by it, it’s out own fault for not doing totems. I always do totems when I see them
---
Him = Freddy
---
Fuzzy Lumpkins = Leatherface
---
Sedusa = Spirit
---
Rowdypuff Boys = Legion
---
I personally haven’t done it, but I hear it’s the best way to induce a salt deluge, next to basement Insidious LF.
---
If every time someone uses dead hard they reach a fake pallet  you ARE bad. And do you want a rank 1 certificate or something? And conditions are downfalls. A condition means something that needs to be done to make something useable. Self care doesnt have a condition, but it has a debuff. Where as spirit fury doesnt have a debuff, it just has a condition. 
---
Conditions dont change the value of a perk, they just make it viable. Debuffs are what weaken a perk. I've been studying game development for over 6 years and am designing my first game at the moment. I may not work in a company, but I feel like I know more about balancing and conditions than a salty killer main on dead by daylight
---
how the HECK am i being rude in this comment... it’s literally the least rude comment
---
Thay need afishul Lego
---
The thing is, you can literally just switch killer and survivor and the meme would be just as relevant lmao
---
If I didn’t stop shining it for that split second I would’ve been off timing. The killer was good actually he somehow killed two of them after that. They kinda scattered like cockroaches minus me and the other guy
---
1st. i never asjed if your a killer main
---
2nd. im not on a high horse im stating a problem i am having with the game, not saying im better
---
3rd. i never said its toxic i just believe it needs to be balanced
---
4th. i dont like bieng stuck to a couple killers cause that is no fun
---
5th. thats funny that you tell people to stop whining like a bitch, specially since you believe that the spirit needs to be nerfed vefore the nurse cause people know how to use her
---
I actually prefer corrupt intervention over ruin. I have EXTREMELY bad luck with totems and the only Hex's I run are Haunted Grounds by itself, or NOED.
---
He’s really well with Photojournalism and Is very broad. So maybe some perks that correlate with his skills.?
---
i dont believe killers should be forced to run a perk, i want a balance, not a solution thats "run this every game so it last longer than 5 mins"
---
Agreed. The primary reason I’m working on them is because my goal with customs is mainly to focus on works that have absolutely no chance of being adapted for sets. As other customizers have taught me, if they aren’t gonna do it, the fans will. Stranger Things is a surprise though, so maybe they’re slowly working on getting rid of that family image.
---
Damn you think you thanatophobia is worse than strider? Why is that? (Genuinely curious)
---
thays like saying camping doesnt ecist cause its just a term for killers confirming thier kill
---
Entity gonna tell them all about the Deadbydaylight Initiative at the end of each episode
---
He is on xbox too?
---
Level up another character to 50, and prestige when you hit you hit the 1,000,000 limit. you don't want to gimp yourself by losing your only lvl 50 character. pick up an exhaustion perk if you can for your secondary (David, Feng, Nea).
---
Killers should be looking for survivors and kill them not waiting for survivors to come to them
---
I get that getting kills is the killer's objective but camping is a no risk strategy that doesn't allow you to improve at the game at all
---
I lost a fucking splinter when someone DC’d because they thought it was a fucking mori. Fucking sucks when people can’t just grow up and play a game instead of quitting because it MIGHT be an item they don’t like. There’s no telling what it is, shroud, splinter, or mori. Even if it is a mori who cares? Most of the animations are cool, just enjoy the work the devs put into making them. Hell I take screenshots every time I get mori’d because some of them look amazing.
---
If all you do is self care all game, how are you doing a gen?
---
And Hag uses it to teleport to a trap.
---
Well let them whine. I remember last night I had 5 key escapes in a row, and tons of instaheals. Certain survivors will bitch about everything and I honestly stopped giving a fuck after being bullied the shit out of. Fuck it, run 5-blink Ebony Mori NOED Dying Light nurse every game if you want. Run Iri Heads and instasaw. 
---
My favorite way to stall for time is 3-gen doc. Survivors can get 4 gens done but the 5th one will never easily be completed 
---
Survivors do need a side objective though. I'm mostly going over ideas I heard over the course of browsing this sub but I've seen ideas like making NOED base-kit, turning Ruin base-kit, etc. 
---
Devs have stated they don't want to increase gen-time any more IIRC because it's tedious for the survivors. Maybe we need a proper side objective like looking for fuel or spare parts for the generators, etc.
---
I think it’s about equal
---
Myers and Ghostface: Can look at people
---
Lockers can be useful, just don’t make it obvious
---
1. Talking about Haddonfield
---
2. You don't seem to know the definition of "infinite"
---
Good for you. Enjoy unfair games that last like 2 minutes.
---
Im red ranks killer. Purple on survivor and do lean more towards killer so i am slightly biased
---
Wow ok😂😂😂😂
---
Same. I’m pretty sure when i try out Freddy with my Smoking Splinter i’m gonna lose it to some dumb fuck who thinks it’s a mori.
---
LMAO, don't run dumb ass shrouds then. You know what you're doing.
---
Isn't the whole purpose/point of obsession to "tunnel" the obsession?
---
I don't really play killers with the obsession thing, but I've played in games as the obsession. And it just sort of seems... logical? To chase the obsession?
---
At one point I brought old MoM and dead hard. Looped a Wraith for half the trial before using these. After that he gave up and started farming with us so that was fun!
---
How dare you make fun of such a cute Charac-
---
Oh....nevermind. The hook camping..is that why? I dont mind getting camped but it is harder to escape when a killer camps. 😂
---
But the main 2 things that gave the lowest BP was totem cleansing and healing. Afterall, isnt this what killers wanted? To stop gen rushing? So making an incentive to cleanse totems and heal others is smart now no?
---
i shouldnt matter cus he was 4feet down from the window by the time the killer swung. whatever tho i guess we have different ideas of the whats legit and whats bs.
---
I agree
---
Sick cheers
---
Yeah, that I was a fucking moron. :D
---
But at least I gave a good laugh to a more experienced friend of mine when I told him of my little tactic.
---
No? Im literally in red ranks and it happens all the time.
---
Nope. Remember if you are a decent looper and the killer follows you the whole game without finding someone else, it’s always a 95% I’ll be camped. No dead hard, no 360s, just trying to LIVE
---
Considering I’ve been a R1 killer several times (all without Ruin mind you—Sloppy Butcher is a helluva substitute), have been a R1 survivor 8 seasons in a row (also without SC), and would consider myself a casual player these days, I would like to think I know what I’m talking about (even though rank doesn’t matter all that much—if had potato R1 allies and **really** bad R1 killers, but I have been around since its release on console). Also, I don’t have the time or patience for passive aggressive—if I wanted to insult you, I would do it outright, but I figured I’d at least offer a nugget of advice there. 
---
Also, survivors have been getting nerfed in some for or facet damn near every single patch (they nerfed DS—which, to be fair, needed that—and the one perk that actually gave most survivors a fighting chance—MoM—got nerfed into dog shit), at this point all that’s left in terms of “giving killers a fair chance” is breaking bad chase habits and learning to properly pressure gens. An argument could be made for shit map design, but that’s a whole other conversion. 
---
Also, if you don’t already, try doing some survivor matches: you’ll see how things are on the other end, see how A) gens actually take a painfully long time to finish, B) their hiding habits, and C) how loops work and better learn to cut them short. 
---
Lastly, DBD is at its best balance it’s ever been since release. At this point, you need to nut up and admit maybe you need to re-evaluate your playstyle. Try recording a match or three, and self critique them—hell, if you posted a couple here, I have no doubt some of us would help you figure out where you’re deficient.
---
Thank you, an experienced survivor is aware of their surroundings, and will always expect BBQ and against Freddy should always be prepared to react to the gen starting to gush blood. To act like it's a free hit for Freddy is flawed logic
---
*player base vanishes*
---
Tysm
---
I saved 690,000 bloodpoints for this. I need my Borrowed Time.
---
Smh
---
Such a gratifying feeling, this.
---
I always hate when the scratch marks get weird. Like you lose sight of someone in a building, and the scratchmarks go fucking everywhere.
---
Providing a counter-argument is now considered an insult? 
---
And I sincerely doubt I'm the first to tell you this but you don't understand game logic. You think you do but you don't. I'm sure others have told you this and you've ignored them. If you keep shutting people off and live in an echo chamber where you only talk to people who agree then everything you say then you'll never achieve anything in life.
---
Nice.
---
You look amazing oml!
---
Right? Makes me feel good when I killed all 4 and they're still that salty
---
The gates were open in this situation, what other choice did he have?
---
It looks like cuphead, there should totally be fan-made dbd cuphead fights
---
In paper that sounds good but bubba has no way to stall the game to the point that no pallets will be left
---
Lmaoo
---
only about my loser teammates that still choose dive in for the save once they know he's camping instead of fucking off to go do free gens.
---
Yes the benefits (which are higher chances to get good items) do stack. So prestiging is pretty much only good if you are going to prestige to the max.
---
Bruh... Fucking SAME
---
Put me in the screenshot
---
Well again the killer does have multiple perks that combat generator work. I get that some have ways around it but survivors don’t always know what a killer has equipped, I’d say they’d be pretty useful.
---
I, Philip Ojomo, have a dream.
---
Infinites don’t exist anymore, so the definition of it doesn’t matter. The point is if you can’t catch a survivor, blaming the map is a cop out.
---
1. Yes if you’re being healed the button you use for sprinting which I think is LB on Xbox.  
---
2. The perk is called huntress lullaby it’s a hex totem that you have to cleanse hex totems are lit up with a candle.
---
3. Honestly you need to watch other streamers that’s how I learned how to loop and somewhat juke at least. 
---
4. Plunderers can be useful in some cases where you get a purple/pink key and you find the hatch but there’s better perks but if you like it use it.
---
5. Personally I think sabotaging hooks isn’t worth it unless you’re in a swf group or using empathy to follow the survivor being chased .
---
I swear it’s a holdover mentality from when instablinds we’re still a thing; seriously, if you’re still struggling against flashlights, you’re doing it wrong.
---
First game as hag... runs devour hipe instead of ruin...
---
Only one is using a purple and none are using 'brand new part', it's not OP
---
How are they supposed to know that you weren't doing something toxic?
---
The reason why this game doesnt have other modes is that if it did, then the queue times would be oonger, which prompts more people to complain about it. You gotta realize that DBD isnt the biggest community out there, especially with queue times nowadays for killers in red ranks being about 5-10 mins. This would double or even triple the queue times for both game modes, as some people won't play the other game mode or won't be on it all the time.
---
Obv everyone has their opinions so I’ll respect urs just adding to mine, it still rewards the killer when the survivors break the totems because that adds another 3-5 minutes to the game just because the survivors THINK you might have noed, this will be even harder with new badham, some of those totem spawns are crazy
---
*something something* **NOED CRUTCH** *something something* **ADRENALINE OP**
---
blah blah blah, all i hear from you now is low iq. Save your breath.
---
🦀🦀🦀
---
wow, amazing, you looked through my comments because of an argument about a video game. would you happen to have 4 sets of great grandparents?
---
Bruh you're never forced to run anything as a killer, the whole point of you being able to see what items survivors have is to choose if you want to counteract the shit they're doing, if you can't accept this. Then accept the fact that the perks you run won't always result in you having your way. Even with perks that slow down the game people don't get their way.
---
How are you guys so low ranked if you abuse map offerings and instaheals as a 4swf?
---
Prestiging is an accomplishment, everyone sees it differently, to me it shows my dedication to the game and my favourite survivors/killers, reducing the bp’s required to level is what they did to introduce legacy, fairs fair
---
Infinites do still exist when Haddonfield generates them. Your ignorance doesn't contradict facts.
---
lol more like they want the game to not suck before trying to roll it out on the Switch before letting it go back to hot garbage after getting those suckers money.
---
Finalllyyyy
---
Dbd YouTuber. He's a god at finding hatch. He's the unofficial hatch king.
---
Good work!
---
Now to simulate being 11 feet tall lol
---
So refreshing seeing someone post who actually knows wtf he is talking about. I've never said this before, but you deserve more than one upvote.
---
The fact it was a hag made it even better
---
i like how i saw this after playing a match with him
---
Whatever but my point still stands. LF's skill curve is nonexistent and when you learn his basics you basically master him but go off i guess
---
Latest dev stream.
---
Nurse and Doctor are getting light changes to their kits.
---
Nurse, Doctor, Pig, Billy, and Bubba are all getting their add-ons overhauled.
---
You claiming something is a fact doesn’t make it a fact.
---
Not that easy . Eac blocks it from dbd and you need special tools to bypass it.
---
you dont need to have the majority or even a third the pallets gone. You need to select the most optimal area to make a small deadzone and then hook someone there and begin a snowball and make the zone gradually bigger. The point isnt to stall with bubba, its to create one opportunity that will give you the 4k.
---
Mini films yeah, your at out of your mind tho if you think they have the time to make 16 or so films of full length xD
---
Artist is u/withaknife. Ciao~
---
Hes not hes a pc exclusive
---
Lovely.  Just...brilliant, mate.  This Spicy Donut fellow's style is a breath of fresh air!
---
HOOOOOOOOOOOLY SHIT THEY ARE ACTUALLY WORKING ON NURSE?! How is everyone not screaming this from the rooftops (or am I just super late to the party)?!
---
Finally someone understands!!!!!! Also KYF is techinically the unranked mode. But thank you.
---
They said it would mostly be add-ons being changed, so she's probably still gonna be busted.
---
No you are not cursed enough.
---
It depends on the perk. A perk like dying light encourages tunneling the obsession while a perk like STBFL discourages going after the obsession. The different obsession perks work in different ways
---
I wanna watch your youtube vids now if yoi have them, that was great
---
*(Softly) Don't*
---
Jokes aside Bubba is basically just a worse Hillbilly. Get addons to make his chainsaw take less time to charge and rev if the Survivor is getting close to a pallet or has no pallets / windows to go to. Of course you're welcome to face camp if you're ready for the hate mail.
---
Really just get him to level 40 and then stop playing him. Use up your offerings and then leave him to rot.
---
You seem fu at parties. I don’t have many moris but if i did i would run them more often.
---
There was a leak for some Summer-esque cosmetics for Jane, Claudette, Trapper, and Hillbilly.
---
You're welcome
---
&gt;Other (Minecraft)
---
You can also buy survivors and killers with 9000 shards each!
---
I saw Jane now I’m excited
---
Wtf does this mean lmao
---
Other (Shaggy)
---
[removed]
---
Will do.  Also, is it just me, or are there a lot of people who are smurfing/deranking?  I notice tons of like low level players with all purple rare perks.
---
Because it's just Freddy's Speed Limiter.
---
Yeah blizz spend an assload on them. They'd be awesome but I can't imagine it'd be affordable
---
True. It gets a little stale seeing the same trees and rocks all over the place.
---
Herobrine killer when?
---
Most likely
---
I like how you commissioned Bubba to acquire your canvas before making necessary alterations.
---
He came with the 3.1.0 update for Xbox, and coming to PS4 tomorrow
---
why has my body adapted to make tears come out when i get tea bagged by a survivor behind a pallet
---
dude, lets look at the "counters" 
---
ruin: unreliable, can be destroyed at any point, can still work through it
---
lulliby: beed 5 tokens to be usefull, even then nothing is promised and can be destroyed beforehand
---
disckrdance: people can just work on different gens
---
servelance: while good, if people work on gens while your in a chase or are far away you wont get much use out of it
---
franklins: people can go back and pick it up and even if it works there are 3 other people uneffected 90% of the time
---
overcharge: good perk one of my favs, doesnt do that much but it helps a small bit
---
pop goes the weasle: ok perk, need to hook someone then go to a gen that isnt done but has progress within a minute
---
for survivors its the toolboxes, not a perk, which can make gens get done with one person in less than a minute
---
No no, YOU'RE welcome. Ha gotcha on that one!
---
I would hope so but that’s news to me so I’m glad to hear it.
---
You get it when survivors fall asleep I think
---
Myers with Save the best for last will be best.
---
Haha exactly!
---
No summer update.
---
holy shit go back to the hellhole of r/dbdgonewild get this shit out of here you inbred mongrel
---
See you'd think so.
---
There are 7 total Obsession perks for Killers, but I mean 3 of those perks are Dark Devotion, Furtive Chase, and Play With Your Food so let's ignore those ones.
---
* Rancor basically lets you ignore your Obsession all game and then Mori them for free once the gates are open. There's a slight downside that the Obsession will see you when a gen is done but unless they're in a voice call with the other Survivors it'll rarely matter.
---
* Save the Best for Last is specifically built around *not* chasing your Obsession. (Hence the title.) It's also probably the most common Obsession perk for Killers.
---
* Remember Me and Dying Light are the only two Obsession perks based on tunnelling your Obsession, and they are also some of the weakest perks in the game. (Excluding the meme perks I listed before like Dark Devotion) They're both based on killing your Obsession as fast as possible but either don't give enough of an upside (Remember Me) or give too much of a downside (Dying Light) to be used.
---
Survivors meanwhile have really strong Obsession perks, most notably Decisive Strike. I really think the intent of the Obsession mechanic was to have the Killer focus on one very powerful Survivor but the end execution was really poor due to the difference in power between the Killer and Survivor perks.
---
Thanks for the tip. I'll try that a bit!
---
Just apart of the game I’m pretty sure, just highlighting the objective that was just complete and sometimes you can see survivors running in that highlighted area, and sometimes you can see the killer running in that area when they hook someone.
---
the last PS4 update gave away spoilers.or leaks..  like Ash
---
Ah yes, Julie is so very naked in this picture, very observant.
---
It drops tomarrow
---
With what u/crackimon said in mind: a lot of people have done studies on the supposed "better bloodwebs" and haven't found much difference. The only real change is a slight decrease in Brown (Common) items.
---
LeatherFace is just fat billy
---
they removed it because the hitboxes on pallets are ridiculously large. and people were stunned even without going through the pallet. also when they were stunned they also went through fatigue in addition to the pallet stun.
---
As someone who loves the Dead Rising series I haven't even touched the 4th but have read the story / gameplay changes. I too choose to pretend it didn't happen and the series ended at 3.
---
Lol dude you're a fucking tool
---
He’s been on Xbox same time as PC. I think it was just PS4 that was a bit late.
---
Damn that new sprint burst buff ain’t no joke
---
Doesn't need to be naked to be sexualized.
---
That didn't happen until Ash was pretty close to releasing tho. Next chapter isn't until September iirc.
---
I got this achievement on PC just over a week ago. It was a real pain and I was complaining on someone’s stream about it when a user on the stream recommended me to run Corrupt Intervention and a Gideon Meat Plant (The Game) Offering. It’s basically the smallest map so you have more map pressure with generators, as well as lockers spawning in certain areas of the map. I’m pretty sure the upstairs segment would be easier to chase a survivor around as I only see lockers in the room above the Wash Room while chasing someone.
---
Then again I got really lucky as after my second kill with the tombstone, the third survivor gave up and stood still, while the fourth almost escaped but I grabbed them off the door and dropped them into the downstairs of the map to give myself more time to get them with the tombstone.
---
But honestly it’s a gamble, I’d recommend doing it during Rank Reset like other people have said as you’ll have a better chance of finding survivors who have no clue on how to evade the Tombstone.
---
Love this game. After chat really fun as well. Whining just makes me laugh. Had 3 on cellar hooks. all gens were complete. came up and there are red scratches at the top of the stairs followed em and found last survivor. Hooked him then in post comments caused me of camping lol. If u are stupid enough to leave me a trail I'm not going to other side of the map I'm gonna follow the trail lol
---
By that logic, Shirtless Myers shouldn't be on this sub at all.
---
Legion is incredibly easy to beat. Pains me when everyone on the team is trying to heal to full health states like please for the love of god do gens. Lol
---
Not even joking but i had a survivor bitch at me and he actually escaped.
---
get good lmao. survivors are op, you can’t do anything
---
As much as hate having my Devour Hope to get cleansed instantly, you're right. It slows down the game, *just a little bit*. I just wish there were less totem spawns that are just totally out in the open
---
The Russian roulette build is an interesting one as if you manage to take out the Thrill then it suddenly becomes very easy to beat. Take out haunted grounds though and you're done for.
---
Would love to see a origin story of Nurse and how she straight went on a 50 patient kill streak
---
I was playing as trapper on iron works of misery and so I placed a trap at the pallet and feng steps on it! So I hook her and I decide I’ll replace the trap in the same spot but I was thinking no one will step in it and I hear a notification go off guess who steps in the trap? feng! So I look at her and shake my head side to side (while laughing) and hooked her again (she died) and she messaged me saying “Yo I died laughing because I stepped into the same trap and you shaking your head side to side had me dying even more”
---
You doing either of those things is beneficial to the killer lmao
---
iTs mAlE, It cAnT bE sExUaLizED
---
Got locked in the basement for ten hours. Back when it was free last year. I was almost at rank 1 and didn't want to depip. The killer messaged me saying the only way out was to dc. He stood on stairs. And didn't move. It was the last game of the night so I left my ps on. And went to bed. Woke up the next morning to find out he was still there. So I went to work. Got a message of the killer. Saying he left. When I got home. I found that I had gained two pips. Was well worth it 😂
---
To be fair though I was playing Michael Myers.
---
Killers dodge tool boxes so I can't argue with this
---
Once it’s 1 or 2 gens left I always run around the map looking for extra totems, I am not getting yeeted on a hook due to noed again.
---
How about you make me biggin.
---
New head canon: the entity is actually just Will Ferrell
---
actually that is what makes people realize they have noed so they shouldnt
---
Okay cool 🤷‍♂️
---
Nope
---
Oh no I forgot he died! Now I'm sad
---
same here, series peaked with 2 imo (although DR1 is a masterpiece and one of my favorite games of all time)
---
I’d love a fully fleshed out Legion story
---
That's a keeper
---
*Laughs in spine chill*
---
Used an Iridescent Axe head as huntress and whenever a survivor throws a pallet down and I instant down them, at the end of the match I get flooded with hate messages ( I play on console ) and get called sweaty and try hard and then reported for using the items given to me. 
---
I don’t have any belts so I can only carry one hatchet with me at a time but I don’t camp hooks or tunnel or any of that. Found out real quick, on both sides, that people like to throw tantrums if the game isn’t simply handed to them.
---
I see what you mean about it not being a free hit. Do you maybe think the downvotes might have something to do with the condescending language you've chosen to use? 
---
Freddy's gen teleport is an undeniably powerful attribute that can be used to secure very easy hits on even the best survivors. I'm not saying it's impossible to avoid the hit, I'm saying there aren't many killers that can capitalise on the information provided by BBQ quite as effectively as Freddy.
---
When are we gonna get shorts for David?
---
Totally, people really think that she wasn't meant to be like that and it was a complete fuck up on the designers' part and they just went with it.
---
Oh, I see. I thought the increase would get you higher level perks sooner. I didn’t realize it just gets you higher quality consumables. Higher-quality consumables cost more and you level up more slowly. Prestige sounds like it’s not a great deal.
---
Myers is immune to it in tier 1 and since Pig &amp; Ghost are stealth killers they shouldn’t be able to be detected by when in there power.
---
Wtf is wrong with Devour Hope? Hag, Myers and Freddy are all fine, learn how to play against them, Pig and Doctor both need looked at but not as much as other killers, survivors definitely do not need a buff.
---
Freddy is fine, learn how to play.
---
I didn’t ANYONE saw Spirit in trials 3 years ago
---
Checks out
---
No.
---
Deliverance in general isn't that great because things need to happen in a very specific order for you to even get to use it. If you get hooked before you can unhook or are the last survivor or you never get hooked its essentially a dead perk.
---
Deranking is common, but having purple perks doesn't make you good, some people have been playing for a while and aren't just that good and that's okay.
---
Really? I figured they would make us pay for him like everything else! Ty for the info!
---
I've always complained about this. I don't even use deliverance and as Survivor I want a chance to kobe and if not earn struggle points, and as Killer I want more time to spam my power or kick gens/shut hatch/break pallets for points.
---
Brainlet
---
Wraith being a very basic killer, you're going to need to outplay the survivor constantly in chase. You can still use his momentum when he's getting out of cloak to try and get a boost and a hit. But mostly it's all about learning structures, how to play them and predict your opponent. I have been playing him today without ruin too, and it's very, very hard, almost impossible at rank 1 if survivors aren't potatoes.
---
So why is it that I am so good with him by biggest problem is pipping? Any advice on how to get more pips? More slugging? I'm not sure what to do, but it pains me when I get 4k 5 times in a row and only pip up once. 
---
Genuinely wondering what I can do better? Rank 1 advice would be really appreciated here, what do you do?
---
Act as if men and women are sexualized in the same way.
---
Can someone tell me what bm means?
---
My friends refuse to play. The usual excuse is the toxicity of the killers tunneling and camping even if the hook was in the first minute or two constantly puking on them or hitting them while on the hook. 
---
It don't bother me because points are points however Devotion 6 solo playing most of it has been an experience.
---
wut, theres a mobile version!?
---
Tier 1 Myers has 105% movement speed and can't lunge. He's immune to all detection perks because he's pathetically weak in that state and needs to stalk to be a normal killer.
---
Ghostface moves at full speed when he's in his cloak and Pig can quickly stand up from the crouch/use a dash attack.
---
I mean, the point stands that there's about as much sexualised content in this image as in the numerous "shirtless Myers" pics in the sub.
---
I play against them whenever they use one.  33% of the time, it's a smart ass with a shroud.  Another 20% of the time, it's a dude with a splinter and no perks or add-ons.  The rest, it's a guy with a mori, which may or may not ever come to haunt me.  I do this because I am not a piece of shit like you.
---
Yeah 2 was a blast, I think I enjoyed it more than 1 just because of the co-op. I know 3 got a decent amount of hate but I enjoyed the characters and gameplay. I just hated the fact the map was split up the way it was and it took forever to get places at times. Apart from that I liked 3. At least in co-op.
---
Got our pic- CREEPER
---
it kinda is fun but alright
---
tbh as someone who plays both sides, theres a difference in flashlight saves and swf flashlight clicking. Ive seen multiple games from both sides where 2 or 3 man swf bully a killer and refuse them hooks. Not saying its bad bc they are trying to survive, but thats not fun gameplay for the killer. If the killer isnt getting points, bc hooking is the most points, then why stay in the game? 
---
I personally dont like to DC no matter how its going but ive seen killers dc bc they arent getting points or having fun. theres a difference between trying to survive and help players, and being annoying for the sole purpose of making someone else upset.
---
*No complaints about the rank 14 with 1 perk..*
---
the second best is plague, and billy with cooldown add-ons might be faster than myers.
---
Ruin, surveillance, Thrilling Tremors and Pop goes the weasel. Ik these are all teachable perks from different killers but its really good anti gen for all fronts. Beginning, middle and end
---
It was an unfair game all in all.
---
Game settings
---
Yeah like I disagree with your argument but I'm not going to start calling you slurs cause of it
---
Ruin/Spirt/Enduring/Brutal as Freddy is my mainstay build when I’m playing with the pallets. Fast breaks and fast setup.
---
All survivors has the same speed right??
---
If it's going too fast.......RUIN, OVERCHARGE, FUCKING PLAY DOCTOR, PLAY NURSE, PLAY FREDDY, OR GTFO AND PLAY ANOTHER GAME!!!?
---
I just wanna know why you used a Game offering playing Trapper lmao
---
Honestly all i see is just people complaining about annoying shit others do in the game. I don't think the point of any of these posts is to say that one aide is all bad or good, just meming the shit that either side does.
---
I've nevee seen anybody genuinely trying to make an overarching point that all killers or all survivors are bad
---
don't forget the huge grind, i really hope they add a data transfer, even if it is a one time use.
---
with that many people and just one killer, i think the Urban evasion Blendettes would end up killing more people by sandbagging then the killer tbh
---
Yup, my friend had it happen to him last night. Iirc it was also with ghostface and, not to call him out, he uses the SB exploit so that might have something to do with it
---
You'd be surprised
---
I know it's not a great perk, I'm just saying that it's frustrating that when the "very specific order for you to even get to use it" does occur, you're not even able to use it if you're the last person hooked.
---
I think deliverance could be viewed as a perk for when you don't have a really good team- they're getting hooked before you and not unhooking you. So if everyone dies before you even get hooked, this perk should still benefit you
---
what would be the point in that. So they can tell you the plot to the first few SAW movies?
---
Survivors: "The gameplay loop is boring"
---
Also survivors: "Wtf don't change the gameplay loop that's op"
---
I would prefer just getting Hannibal as a killer already.
---
Will you be making phone wallpapers? I’d love this ad my wallpaper!
---
big brain plays
---
in the same surv/killer 50/50 pool as you and honestly same. 
---
survs are pretty rude no matter how i do as killer but when i play surv i dont get any complaints. just the stray gg ez cocky stuff but thats typical. 
---
The only hate i ever got was for playing claudette bc shes been my main ever since the game came out and the only surv i have all the perks on. People call me an abuser for that every now and again and its like??? i didnt break the game fam. i also dont t bag, never saw a point in it. im here for fun and points and i assume the other side is too. so long as im having a fun time im not gonna shit on someone else.
---
If the gates are open and he’s been experiencing toxic survivors all game I’m fine with it. Give him one.
---
It is a thing. It’s just most people prefer to call it “trying to win”. That being said complaining about survivors doing it is pretty fucking ignorant
---
#F A C T S
---
*horror fiction literature
---
Horror fiction in cinema is grossly over saturated, but horror literature is much less explored and more difficult to achieve in my experience.
---
Stop saying we like you actually play killer. You say you do but your post history says otherwise.
---
pink = common
---
yellow = uncommon
---
green = rare
---
purple = very rare
---
red = ultra rare
---
orange = event items
---
Its not op you just dont do bones
---
Optimized and skilled survivors have it as easy as can be and cannot be beaten unless you play one of the 4 meta killers. Mediocre or dumb survivors will struggle. It's the dumb players that have the biggest voice, though, so they are catered to.
---
Case closed

the virgin filmless killers vs. the chad licensed killers
---
K cool I thought this because big Dwight be feeling extra slow sometimes when I play him lol
---
Make the revving up mechanic identical to Hillbilly’s
---
Increase default chainsaw movement speed
---
Make the last chainsaw swing count
---
Increase chainsaw reach
---
Add a built in ‘rusty chain’ function
---
Any of the above
---
Yeah and I do, No0b3 duh, and I try but I fail. I used to mind game but with high rank survivors I can't mind game them
---
ayy nice strawman there, adding in an "every game" in where there wasn't before. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Something can be a problem without happening every time, can even be a problem without happening most of the time, just has to happen frequently enough in comparison to it happening less with these 3 killers
---
Really?  Stop trolling people.
---
Keyboard and mouse&gt;&gt;&gt;controller
---
I hate people who try stuff like that. Had a similar experience with a Huntress who refused to pick me up, and my dying bar wasn't going down. I figured she'd just hook me, but after ten minutes I realized I was a fool to think that
---
Then don't mind game them, they're expecting you to and will probably predict them. So just dumb it down I guess? I basically resign myself to defeat vs a full squadette so I don't try too hard
---
sugar, spice, and *god damnit STOP TEABAGGING*
---
What'd daddy Myers do to you? :( The only thing about Freddy that needs a nerf is dream pallets. Snares are fine. The only thing I agree with is nerf Nurse. Hillbilly, Spirit, Hag,  daddy Myers, and snare freddy has a counter. Don't play pig or doctor then. Ruin and NOED are  hexes.
---
I won't devour your hows.
---
You do get the extra bloodpoints, but the game doesn't report them. It's purely a visual bug.
---
LMAO good shitpost mate
---
These dude want the game to be easy AF or what? Haha
---
Yes. That is slugging. Slugging one person because you see another one right around the corner is totally fine, but some people take it a bit far with slug builds that are designed for slugging. Many survivors  hate this type of build because 1, they always lose to it because it requires more than three brain cells to beat, and 2, sitting on the ground the whole game is boring.
---
Yeah, because the solution to pallets is to make a particular killer extra strong? Even a child could figure out that if pallets are the issue then you should fix pallets, now you’re just grasping for straws
---
I love you too fellow trapper
---
Nice u made me hate the doctor even more
---
Mint rag would like to have a word with you
---
With her mental issues and quarks, her backstory could be an amazing movie. Or criminal minds episode.
---
I get hit by this shit with someone without a chainsaw lol
---
This isn’t a soapbox moment, it’s attempted discussion. If you’re here to argue rather than discuss an issue then I’m happier you leave. Not sure what happened to make you such an angry person, have fun with that
---
What exactly is black mirror?
---
I hear it's super confusing. Like time travel confusing.
---
That shit is so annoying. People act like I have to run away if I see all three survivors surrounding a hooked one. If I don’t I’m apparently toxic and a camper
---
After 3 years, that information hasn’t been grasped yet.
---
Higher quality trees next time plz?
---
No it's a recommendation, I'm basically saying you can either deal with it and shut up, do something about it, OR just stop playing, gen rushing is a strategy, just like how facecamping, tunneling, camping or 3 gen-ing is a strat for killer. Jfc.
---
Ok
---
Hell, get crazy and story tell some stuff from the entity's viewpoint.
---
If you want variety you should encourage buffs to the weak-ass killers and nerfs to the god killers, with tweaks to survivors to match.
---
You.... I like you.
---
Hhmmm. Why change doctor add ons? I can understand the nurse but doctor?
---
 They seem fine to me. But I'm just a rank 12 killer so maybe I'm not quiet low enough to understand?
---
This looks awesome! Keep up the great work
---
Now that's just straight up untrue I pulled this on 3 people in one game at rank 3 last night and it worked all 3 times. Twice at a pallet and once in the open when a Kate thought I was going to use my power to close the gap. A lot of high rank survivors favor doubling back on Spirit during her power and that's what this mindgame is good for. You can't just spam it or it literally loses to Hold Shift + W
---
You never noticed that anti-surv posts skyrock to the frontpage?
---
People on this sub also overuse the term “genrush”. 
---
Just don’t get annoyed unless you’re playing billy, spirit, or nurse. 
---
This is the only game I’ve ever played where I could play as perfectly as possible, and lose incredibly hard. Once you realize that’s possible, you’ll take these games in stride.
---
Not when you can mach 5 across the map, no. I don't think you would ever camp as Billy.
---
Nah man I haven’t lol.
---
Ah, well I was literally gen rushed. First 5 minutes 4 and a half gens were done. I started face camping, and I hate face campers. I got that annoyed
---
So... get better? I'll say this about many games and it works for the best. Always balance around higher play, they produce more money for the company and play the game the most, therefore knowing what is op and whats not. Learn the totem placements for each map and actually look for them. Trust me itll make ruin pointless.
---
If you get someone to prestige 3 max level can you still buy new perks and offerings from the bloodweb.
---
I can play killer and not have only pro-killer opinions? 
---
&gt;Stop saying we 
---
Don't tell me what to do, thanks.
---
Ehh. I’ll take your word for it. 
---
How many people did you hook in that 5 minute window? Either you hooked almost nobody, or you don’t have ruin.
---
Each episode is one movie and has nothing to do with the other episodes. But every episode has the main topic technology(future/social media). Not confusing at all(S1E1 is not for everybody . So don‘t quit after one episode.)
---
I got messaged by a survivor yesterday after a game where I 4k'd with a list that included using expose perks, using nurse, using ruin, and exit gate guarding. I really don't know what some survivors think killers are supposed to do and still win.
---
Her ambush no longer acts as a basic attack, ironically rendering one of her base kit perks (Make your choice) unusable by her ambush attacks.
---
That's some nice work, man!
---
Yea obviously
---
I agree completely with that!
---
Oink
---
so true lmao
---
I’d rather survivors have a tougher time doing the gens if they decide to push through it or waste time looking for it because a 3 minute timer won’t really do much against good survivors and toolboxes.
---
I dont have ruin and I was chasing one guy. I couldn't catch him. It's just really frustrating. I'm gonna try and get bbq, fired up, and bamboozle for Myers. Then a fragrant tuft of hair and a William J. Myers memorial. Then go into a match.
---
I'd rather have 6 dailies per day, 3 for killer 3 for survivor
---
Gordon was the man too, i just didnt like hoffman as much except for the police station, hoffmaneitor
---
The bloodweb is infinite, the level just maxes at 50
---
The comments are kinda anti-this post, but personally I think this really captures the kinda “suburban girl rebel” or whatever, without her looking like a model but still also keeping the old model in mind, (with the hairstyle and a few other features) 
---
All in all, good post OP
---
You've never heard of vault master god myers? YouTube him. Then tell me why I need them
---
I’d easily say leatherface was worse than pre rework Freddy. 
---
You just needed a different (stressful) style of play with Freddy.
---
They should. For honor had the same problem for so long and now the game is being balanced around competitive play, which is great for top tier players and makes lower skilled players get better at the game if they really like it. Dead by daylight is a strategy game, you have to think a lot to play well, if you arent then you're here complaining that noed is op and dont do bones
---
Yeah but I also play with console survivors. But if anything a co.puter sounds more like a jet engine to me. My console is always quiet
---
I agree! But at the same time, it turns into a hunt and then the survivors are just wasting their own time and signing up for a loss. 
---
Its a hard thing to balance tbh.
---
Ah. One of those meme things. I don’t really meme around on killer, nor watch people who don
---
This isn't that accurate but I agree mostly
---
&lt;3
---
It's not a meme build. Myers meme build is Burger King myers. This is different. This will allow me to vault faster than survivors
---
Yeah, I have (possibly misplaced) faith in BHVR. I think they could balance it properly.
---
Pc games are cringey. They spend 2k on a console and use it to play average games with shit exclusives (except for horror games)
---
Yes! The yogurt one was really fun to see how it played out and the robots one was funny
---
&gt; the condescending language 
---
Fair enough, I hope that is the reason! And good on ya for calling me on that.
---
&gt; secure very easy hits on even the best survivors.
---
I still heavily disagree on that.
---
&gt; There aren't many killers that can capitalise on the information provided by BBQ quite as effectively as Freddy.
---
Yea that's definitely true. I personally like that half of Freddy's new power is very nicely oriented around gen protection, but it's definitely understandable to get frustrated playing against it. I wasn't ever saying you cant be frustrated by it, just the free hit characterization.
---
I've always loved Pop goes the weasel, was greatly excited to see it get the time buff, and pretty entertained by how nicely it clicks with Freddy's teleport. They pair so well, it's like Thana on legion or plague, or nurses calling on huntress or wraith. Some perks just fit with powers like puzzle pieces.
---
I honestly think spirit is fine. Hard to use but great reward
---
This. If I see a Nurse I know its 50/50 on whether they are actually good or not, but if I see a Billy I immediately assumed I'm gonna get fucked
---
I bet you feel like a real man right now
---
*Don't say I am a console peasant because I am a PC peasant lol*
---
We lost one of the biggest memes from DBD comunity...
---
You only thing that the Trapper can really do at high ranks is run Bloody Coil and Trapper Bag. Other than that, he is definitely one one
---
I don't know about Frank west but Hank East definitely should be
---
I was thinking more of a esoteric horror or existential horror like Jacob's Ladder for him.  Either from his perspective or those around him.
---
If you have teammates still alive and aren't on death hook, it can be a good idea to deny giving Myers an easy kill and to try and help yourself and your team.
---
Depending on the match, forcing Michael to either slug or hook you can be the difference between victory or death for you and your teammates.
---
That said; I wholeheartedly agree that if you're the last person alive with no chance of Escape you should just let Mikey kill you.
---

He deserves it after abandoning my beautiful boy, Doppio. RIP Doppio. You're "tururu"ing in heaven now.
---
But leatherface has a great defense potential. He's still shit thought, but not as bad as Amanda
---
I thought wiggling was supposed to award BP. I'm not getting points for that. What's going on?
---
Most of the time it means either you won too quickly or didn't get enough hooks per person. As in, you want to hook everybody at least twice and you have a better chance at pipping than hooking everyone once and getting a 4k. If you want actively pip with this broken emblem system you just want to read their objectives (gatekeeper is about keeping gens from being done and the gate being open, one is about winning chases, the other about interrupting altruism etc.) and focus on doing them rather than actually winning. Which sounds counter-intuitive but hey, we're all playing the same shitty game so we gotta play by their rules.
---
I’d rather play against hook destroyers and flashlights than a team full of insta-heals and BNP toolboxes.
---
2
---
Actually, they have a lower reach than the standard M1, and long bar makes it standard, IIRC.
---
This was just a latency issue
---
Exactly!!!
---
I’m talking like original Halloween low budget
---
I'm talking about those assholes who aren't even doing the generators because they are solely focused on just preventing you from getting hooks. It's a next level type of bm. Ever had 10 minutes with no one hooked and 5 gens left? Red rank swf shit right there, it happens.
---
is it weird that i thought the exact same thing a long time ago
---
[he ain’t lyin’](https://tenor.com/TOfp.gif)
---
sorry for late reply but thank you for this helpful tip kind sir
---
Same with Plauge water shrines or Freddys alarm clocks (haven't checked).
---
Agreed, though survivors shouldn't see the boxes either until their trap actually activates
---
Agreed
---
EXACTLY, all the salty killer mains came to this post but you're exactly right. Why would I waste 10 minutes with some Bs when I can quit and get a new game in like 3-4 minutes?
---
Exactly. Neither of them can and they're side effects are....less lethal we'll say.
---
Lol, stay salty.
---
Ya ever see the original, black and white, Twilight Zone?  If you haven't Twilight Zone was a TV show focusing on sometimes outlandish, weird, and often horrifying scenarios like "What if a child could have god like powers with control over who lives and who dies with a town bending to his will or else they die?" or "What if a man sees a monster on the wing of the plane but absolutely nobody sees the monster either?" or my favorite "What if a woman went in for plastic surgery and has her eyes covered so she can look more like everyone else, but what if everyone else looks like pigs?" with Black Mirror being a more modern, scifi twist like "What if our eyes were phone."
---
And yes, I'm kinda being facetious in that example of black mirror, but there is an episode where everyone has smart-implants in their eyes that act like a phone:  You can block people out entirely, you can call, text, etc, and it focuses on how blocking people can lead to disastrous results.  There are a couple of others I remember like how Smart AIs are just clones of someone's brain and habits as to best allow and fit for the real person's lifestyle as nobody knows how exactly well you like your toast than yourself.  Of course a lot of issues I have with the show extend from being entirely unable to "Buy" some of the concepts and how unlikely they are, with things like being able to visually and audibly block someone IRL is nowhere close to blocking someone's phonenumber or social media presence given that blocking someone in that way IRL would make it near impossible for people's lives to actually function properly or how an AI having equal free will and understanding of a person by being a clone of them is a bit too much effort when a giant cloud based Alexa could have done the exact same job without ever having any ability to mentally snap and kill the smart-home owner.
---
My 50 year old dad loves Black Mirror and Twilight Zone, but none of my pals nor me like Black Mirror in the iGen crowd but love Twilight Zone, but that's probably because the situations are more tech based in Black Mirror and not existential weirdness like Twilight Zone.
---
You don’t know how triggering that would be for survivors. I don’t have a problem with noed but not making it take up a perk spot 😨.
---
I like this. Tbh I'd like any idea about nerfing noed.
---
The perk is literally there as a counter to items, what the fuck are you on about
---
I don’t think noed is op. But I do think it “forces” people to just escape instead of rescue hooked survivors when gates opened
---
It’s a perk for Claudette when your injured hit the heal button.
---
&gt;doctor
---
&gt;buffs
---
Absolutely fucking not.
---
Yes please, nerf her even more, she's not F tier yet.
---
okay. your point?
---
A map addon.
---
I've been playing a lot of the Pig recently and I feel the Reverse Bear Traps are just a portable Hex: Ruin. It only slows down the game jusr a skosh for an outstanding survivor. If tunneled, the same survivor can run the Pig around and not lose any traction as the timer pauses. Before you know it, the generators are done, the gates are open, and the trapped survivor waves bye-bye as they hop into the open hatch.
---
Long story short, it's not feasible to chase a trapped survivor. I'll shoo them off a Jigsaw box if I see them but I won't chase. The 1 second they lose on the timer isn't worth a 60 second chase where three other generators have the potential to complete.
---
Suffer the sweaty Pigs out there for you eventually find out that if they have to tunnel a trapped survivor, they're not going to be effective in a chase. Loop for days, watch for the hatch, and you'll find victory is within your grasp.
---
I only hook Dwight because I want him to notice me...
---
I think thats the point really. But i did get my perks mixed up and said noed instead of ruin. I was jusy talking to someone about noed.
---
this might be a stupid question but what is the heal button? I unlocked it in the blood tree but when i need to be healed/when I get hurt I dont see an option to heal
---
Pig already sucks enough if they did that they would have to at least make a loud noice and indication to show when the survivor finished it.
---
DbD and CryptTV collab when?
---
Id pick 2,  no point in getting dbd mobile if ya got it on pc, and i could care less about balances since I only get annoyed by fking campers and tunnelers
---
It's a broken perk
---
Your side is worse then mine
---
I pretty much only play hag to use mint rag
---
How would they do some killers like wraith and plague?
---
He’s ability is simply and boring its only good for camping. I really wish the would rework him
---
I generally only get upset over Adrenaline, every other thing is rare or my own fault, but Adrenaline gets on my nerves like nothing else and is a very common perk.
---
Listen for it mostly. In terms of actual spawns, the only rule I can think of is that it spawns on the lower level for The Game. I'm sure there are other tricks to it though
---
Hag and Freddy are basically better trappers. You could try picking up either.
---
Even though I love one of the new legion add ons I agree that they need a rework a bit. Whether there's a way for them to put all 4 legion on the map or a feral frenzy rework that doesn't cancel after missing one hit. Not like preworked one but maybe miss 3 hits.
---
Yes, in a perfect world it wouldn't happen. A scummy player can really suck the fun out of the experience. But you just got to roll with the punches. People are tenacious enough to find other exploits if your proposed nerf were to happen. I say learn from the trial and soldier on. I think you can persevere enough to where the traps won't even be a concern. If the scummy Pig can't catch you, then s/he can't trap you.
---
I think Leatherface’s chainsaw should run right through pallets. A good killer for anti-looping but still has his biggest weakness of no map pressure.
---
The crouch power alone makes her better than either imo. You can argue Doc with his very best add ons is better than Pig with her very best but I think the best Pig build beats the best Doc build more often than not.
---
Now we have a new meme: whoever the DBD community decides is the worst killer next. I vote Wraith.
---
But that's Woll Smoth tho
---
I’ve had people say the same thing, but I’ve kept my messages clean after that incident, I tell them to get bent in which is a different way of saying Get Fucked! 
---
But I found out after the suspension that it was a kid and his parents seen the messages we sent back and forth and they reported it. Little shit was spawn sniping us from 700 meters, we had a hard time finding him and then getting to him, he was good and had guys watching his back. We got him eventually, then I sent the message after the game ended. We actually became friends after that lol go figure!
---
It would be completely fine if there was a totem counter, it becomes complete fair and it is to be expected if there are still totems on the map.
---
Also no mither and self care one lmao. Tfw 9000 iq
---
Bruh obviously it’s gonna be the new meta watch
---
I think there's still a couple infinites around. Like the main building on that one coldwind farm map, the one with all the blood on the ground and pigs hanging from the ceiling in one of the main building's rooms
---
Nah, run Left Behind and solidarity. Ez escape
---
I use both, I'm a pretty diverse killer, I'm just mad because Trapper went from being a very fun killer to feeling like a punching bag lol.
---
I used to be a hag main, and I'm enjoying the new freddy.
---
Trapper, just, ugh
---
Not favourite, just a good one. After getting one-hooked so much I got Adam and started using Deliverance only to realise it's very situational and usually a waste of a perk slot. I had one satisfying game. Rank 5 vs a pig. It was just me and a Nea alive, 1 gen left. Nea was getting chased, she goes down and I pop the gen just in time. She had Adrenaline but after a little she went down again and got hooked. I opened the door, pig was camping Nea, I took a hit, unhooked, took a hit, Nea ran to the door, I got hooked, used deliverance, also had ds and dh, we both escaped. It was the easiest play of my life and the most use out of deliverance I will ever get.
---
I always call em a twat
---
Says you!
---
If you ask me there's nothing wrong with Close Cut Nea.
---
Lol
---
I’m replying to this and wish to be above that guy that wants to be in the screenshot so to request that I don’t be put in, and, by extension, he isn’t put in either

It's kind of a joke, it is a meme but still doesn't excuse the us vs them mentality that is still abound.
---
Surprise the killer didn't dc
---
Fire up is a meme perk. So any build with fire up is a meme build.
---
pallets are a useful tool to survive a chase against a killer
---
I understand. I've just been playing Freddy against randoms and nurse against swfs. 
---
Freddy for fun nurse for wins haha.
---
Used to main trapper as well, but since I don't have ruin it's very difficult to play him.
---
I ran No mither, Unbreakable, Tenacity and Flip-Flop. Successfully lost 4 pips but one game I didn't de pip. Great build.
---
I honestly don’t see the problem in it, but it is kinda toxic if it’s like all brand new parts and perks to get gens done but still it’s all counter able. You say on how all the perks can be countered but it’s to balance it on both sides like DS countered by enduring or adrenaline basically countered by Noed unless it’s a good team and does totems with usually doesn’t happen. Dead hard basically just wait for them to use it, both sides perks counter the other side to make it fair so I think if they bring toolboxes it fair and is not over powered fast. Franklins if they pick it up they are just wasting more time to get there item. If your worried about ruin you can just bring thrill of the hunt.
---
I usually get at least one hate message every 3 games when I play killer.

Why not?

Don't worry only the cursed comment itself was posted.
---
Enduring is better if you're going to be swinging through pallets more often, Brutal is better if you think they're going to drop pallets early (or you're going to kicking Generators a whole lot as well)
---
ah, thank you good sir
---
New challenge system? Any info on this somewhere?
---
Yeah but survivors shouldn’t really complain about slug builds because you can run unbreakable or if the killer has knockout run empathy.
---
Welcome.
---
This made my day.
---
Goodbye
---
Her power is a 70/30 guess in her favour. There is no info feedback for the survivor. She can hear you breathe, she can hear your footsteps, she can see the grass you are walking through, she doesn't have a vaulting animation, passive phasing is rng bs, if you don't have iron will she can hear your pained moans, she can even bump into you in her power if she has trouble finding you.
---
She's not as bad as Nurse, but there is a lot you could improve on to make her not be like, the most boring killer to go against.
---
Have a great night
---
you know after a game that menu that shows your survivor/killer level, there’s these little diamondish shaped icons; when you “pip” the icon gets filled, and it’s one more point to increase your rank
---
Have an excellent morning
---
Ah so pip-Ed refers to which part specifically?
---
Well it's night for me so have a great day instead.
---
It means they pipped, which means they improved in rank. For example, if they were rank 14, they may now be rank 14 1/4 or if they were rank 10 3/4, they may now be rank 9.
---
It applies to all Skill Checks. Ruin isn't exempt.
---
who's tyde? I wanna see their account now lol
---
oh it’s night for me too. I was just being polite and hope you have a good morning tomorrow :)
---
I personally like her original, regular face. Not everyone is conventionally attractive, and even then, that is just subjective. She's a brash graffiti artist delinquent who rolls with the wrong crowd, and runs from the police frequently. Fits her perfectly, in my opinion.
---
Ah alright thanks
---
You too!
---
I think it's Pig because her surprise atack is useless (Wraith's not). It's better to stand up and atack than to ambush atack. Her RBT are useless and almost to slow the game, and you're never gonna kill someone with them
---
Thank you new friend
---
Myers even breaks the rules for all Killers having the same vaulting speeds as well. Myers is truly unique in a whole lot of aspects.
---
Welcome
---
include solidarity and it's even better
---
Today i faced a streamer in an hilarious game. I was billy and i think it literally took me 60 seconds to chainsaw his 3 teammates, worst players ever. Then this dude actually was kinda good and it took me like 2 minutes to catch him. Fastest 4K ever :P
---
And ironically, the game judged that i wasn't good enough and didn't let me pip up.
---
Result: i'm not able to climb up purple ranks because people die too fast to me hahaha
---
A-fucking-men
---
Oh boy, it’s you. I’m not interested in starting a conversation with you, but I will type a short response. Your hate is unmatched and you’d argue your point with emotion rather than logic. 
---
If you think having comms turns you into a god tier survivor, you’re mistaken. Four survivors on comms will still get dumped on if they’re bad at chases. Hate to be that guy, but that’s the truth. 
---
I’m not a huge fan of SWF either but it’s here to stay. Clearly people like you give a shit if someone is playing with their friends. You sound personally hurt. 
---
Bye now.
---
Search in youtube tydetyme tierlist. If the video has a lot of dislikes, that's the correct one.
---
***ANGRY ELEPHANT NOISES***
---
Eh I feel like Legion is ok. He could use some small adjustments like increasing his base power duration and making the pin add ons apply on first power hit. I think giving him 115% ms was the way to go with them.
---
What LF really really needs is not slowing down so much when he's revving his saw. When Billy charges his saw he slows down to survivor's running speed, LF slows down to way below that, so you can't saw someone unless you get straight in their butt cheeks.
---
It is quite annoying but I wouldn’t say toxic
---
Absolutely. If you couldn't, then you wouldn't be able to get items/offerings/addons after a certain point, and that would be a really bad thing.
---
Nice
---
I’d say yes tbf seeing as Myers was literally right behind you and you lagged into him l.
---
I'd love to see what a good screenwrio could do with the concept. A never ending game of cat and mouse. It'd be hard to show the licensed killers (most of which are my favorite killer) tho. Just give me a feature length movie of 4 p3 Claudettes against a 5-blink nurse with NOED
---
Freddy looking a bit weird.
---
yes but they don't work all the time. spirit, nurse, hag, huntress, and even doctor have means of denying pallets.
---
Leather doesn't need a rework he just needs some buffs
---
“pip-ed” is just pipped in assuming, but either way OP is referring to the points you get towards the next level after the mach. look up “dead by daylight pip” if you’re still confused
---
What does it sound like? I’ve never been able to hear it.
---
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
---
“Negative pip, safety pip, single pip, and double pip” these are the level, in order, that determine your rank.
---
No one should really need to bring in a certain perk to counter other perks. Unfortunately it is what tends to happen though, ruin to counter gens, insert more "crutch perks". But just saying bring in unbreakable is not really an answer to slug builds. Thats how people get into the *lul just do totems if you dont like NOED* arguments. In order to counter slug builds, all you really need to do is self care in the corner, as the killer is too busy chasing to mind you, find the thrid seal if there is one, try to pick up a fellow survivor, and rush gens. No unbreakable needed!
---
I do understand it being annoying, its happened to me as killer and ill get kinda salty lol, but i get just as salty as a survivor when i get mori’d, wouldnt call it toxic tho
---
*Last gen pops*
---
David: You are a baby killer gg I'm gonna loop you while the gates open
---
Wraith: You'll never reach the pallet.
---
David: Wha- 
---
*NOED + Mori*
---
Running away and trying to survive is considered toxic to some killers. They will face camp survivors because they were looped longer than they liked.
---
Also, crying about instant heals and other items, when they themselves have instant downs.
---
The only thing that's toxic are the little shit SWF who teabag and point at every opportunity. Otherwise, merely using what you can to survive is not.
---
Really didnt need to be said btw, nobody needed this in their lives
---
Escape portal
---
Swf most of the time I play is super toxic for no reason
---
U forgot ooo bro
---
Well, it comes with the territory so to speak
---
He speaks the language of gods...
---
&gt;Like I swear sometimes it actually hits me and yet I still get the stun.
---
I don't get what you mean, did you want to say that it hits you but it doesn't give you a stun?
---
I didn’t even notice that’s Adam n not Lucas
---
Portal to heaven.
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
I don’t think he’s great, he has no real way to counter looping, he’s just cancer to play against. I think he belongs in the rework category.
---
I’ve hit rank 1 multiple times on both killer and survivor so miss me with that. Also I’ve you’ve played this game for more than 5 minutes you know rank means nothing.
---
Dream pallets are easily counterable with a little cool perk called
---
*MAP KNOWLEDGE*
---
I mean I see the weapon touch me while I drop the pallet but I still pull it off without getting smacked
---
Is WGLF bugged, or do not all "protection" hits get stacks? I keep getting +100 BP that say "protection" but no stacks.
---
I dont belive so, im pretty sure the chase music just stops.
---
Good idea but they need to add a totem counter
---
As a killer it's not toxic at all, it's a good strat if done right. I think in general some people are quick to get mad and call something toxic just because its not what they "expect" and can cause annoyance/frustration. Part of the game and keeps it interesting imo just like having to think about if someone is running decisive strike or whatever.
---
Yeah they’ll find it, just like all the other posts everyday complaining about totem spots when we already know they’re terrible...
---
Thank you, kind stranger!
---
Imagine being hit by Gold Experience Requiem has a Killer.
---
Infinite pallet loops...
---
Lmao, I love the disconnect symbol!
---
Like zubat in his last video. Forgets he has deliverance, fucks up his head on then forgets he has ds and misses it.
---
Why must you be so petty to scour someone’s profile
---
I’d agree, not because billy is hard to play, by nurse is easy to play once you get used to her, which you have to because that’s the only way to play her. Not to mention billy is a m1 killer at some loops and can’t chainsaw around corners.
---
I don't get it what's the problem
---
I honestly believe that if they attempted such big rebalances they would just create new issues along with a batch of bugs. It could make the game worse as it took another months to attempt to tidy that shit up.
---
Oh! Yeah, I've noticed it's been harder to hit people through pallets since the mid-chapter patch dropped.
---
They must've made swinging through pallets less reliable.
---
Don’t see a lot of chess memes anywhere, take my upvote
---
Speed kills the toolbox faster, but also does the gen *Slightly* faster. 
---
Efficiently makes your toolbox last longer, so that you end up saving more time if you use the whole thing rather than the speed add-ons.
---
I think it looks great, it's just personal preference though I guess.
---
Main building at autoheaven has a loop that’s not infinite, but almost is. If you aren’t playing Trapper, Nurse, or Hag, it’s probably a 2 gen loop.
---
Ehh rank 10's are usually dumb as fuck. At least you got lucky being against a rank 20.
---
[This must have sucked for the killer](https://i.imgur.com/PFXhYBb.jpg). A rank 18 should never be in the same game as a rank 2 and a rank 4.
---
What rank are you. And if this is a handful, then something about the tutorial will be in this long ass list.
---
Survivor main here and I will say I don't care how a killer plays except facecamping. That one really is lame. And I don't mean guarding your hook when you have reason to believe someone else is nearby, I just mean straight up facecamping.
---
The rest of it I'm cool with. If I get slugged it's my fault for being caught. If I get hooked first it's my fault again. If it's NOED then I should be leaving.
---
Only thing that I've noticed as I climb ranks is that ruin is literally every other match. And I get it, it's a perk and it's valid.. it's just annoying. :P
---
On the plus side it has helped my get better at great skill checks, so there's that.
---
Princess is the Plauge
---
And then they get into the realm by being hunted and killed by the Punisher lol
---
Yeah and you know what changes that?
---
**Making the totem spawns not utter shit.**
---
with the trapper best killer in the game
---
To be honest, the best method of taking out a team like that is to find the weakest link and kill them off first. Just my experience.
---
Check survivors trophies to get an idea of who you are facing. Know your enemy- some chinese guy
---
Wow they even fit their personality LOL
---
#ASCEND
---
That's fair, but survivors really shouldn't be BMing killers that they know they can easily beat in the first place. Some killers are just so poorly balanced it would be like if a professional chess player beat a 5 year old that just learned what all the pieces did, then made fun of them because they lost.
---
  
---
Doesn't make sense to in the first place and is extra rude.   
---
But at least with DbD, if you just need to play a bad killer for a daily and don't want to deal with end game chat, you just leave the lobby, but the stuff that happens in game really shouldn't happen. It just shows really poor balancing when a survivor can take the time to make fun of the killer and still escape. I'll tell you, when I play nurse, ain't no one gonna T bag or BM and get away with it.
---
I’m a “toxic survivor main” but I stick up for killers when survivors try to bullshit them
---
I’m not too sure why people are complaining about that, although I do think it’d be nice if cleansing totems was a tad bit more difficult, as of now its pretty much just as easy as taking off a Reverse Bear Trap or waking yourself up.
---
Who is Miller?
---
Yeah ya know I just play Nurse tho. U know like the worst killer in the game. 
---
My perk build is pretty bad. It's just a bunch of low tier perks. Make your choice, Surveillance, Nurses Calling, and Barbeque are just all shit perks ya know?
---
I've gotten 4ks pre-NOED activating and I get insulted for it being a crutch perk, but I killed them all before it activated, thereby not even using it. The salt is real sometimes
---
Are you sure they weren’t a SWF? All it takes is for just one of the Purple Ranks to be teamed with just one of the Low Ranks for this to happen, sadly.
---
Eh, just try to ignore them. Play to have fun and if they are salty say gg and leave. Sometimes I’ll just keep responding with “:)” that makes em feel better, lol! But typically I’m the first to say gg and just immediately leave to avoid salt.
---
If people think flashlights are toxic,imagine of BHVR introduce the wrist rocket from Stranger things. Its gonna be a bloody shitshow
---
this dude understands me xd
---
Because it adds cleansing totems. If you do four totems and can’t find the other one you can either assume that the randoms took it but if they didn’t then it’s in a well hidden spot
---
Ngl. I do appreciate killers not camping hooks, but that chainsaw is bs..
---
*”It’s pretty ridiculous that the best killer perks always have a downside, but the best survivor perks offer no downside to being used whatsoever.”*
---
Is this real life? BBQ has no downside. Nurse’s has no downside. Enduring has no downside. Spirit Fury has no downside. Exhaustion perks’ downside is in their name: exhaustion. As of 2.1.0, exhaustion doesn’t recover while running. That means you can only use exhaustion perks once per chase. As for Self Care, it’s more of a hindrance than a help, especially if the killer’s running Sloppy Butcher, Thanatophobia, or Dying Light.
---
This has got to be a shitpost.
---
I don’t want licensed killers to be made into movies. We already have those. I want the killers created for DBD to have the spotlight
---
LMAO wtf. That was pretty funny though
---
They might be, they did a gen rush that conclude with the game being only 7 minutes.
---
Nah too short. We need at least an hour, like a Black Mirror episode
---
ok
---
*sprint burst*
---
I think they need to fix the spawns (as you said), not put them near generators, make them only show up as hex totems after they're active (like NOED, in most cases this would be pretty fast, but it would prevent cleansing within the first 30 seconds), and maybe increase the time to cleanse and/or add in skill checks (to hex totems only, as to incentivise cleansing dulls before a hex pops). Then they would feel like an actual second objective.
---
Do premonition and spine chill detect phased Spirit?
---
Assuming yes but just looking to verify.
---
At least the bear traps require skill checks.
---
&gt;Playing every match with 3 other brain dead people make me lose my fucking kind
---
Well if you play with 3 other brain dead people, wouldnt that mean there are 4?
---
What are you going on about? All I'm saying is that Freddy is potentially A-tier to me. I said nothing about any of the other killers.
---
Claudette DCed after being unsafely unhooked. I just found her DCed body really funny.
---
Where did her head go?
---
Honestly though--- there is nothing you can say. If you call them out they get defensive.
---
What a flex
---
He probably could have gotten a kill if he didnt dc
---
I would use it but I don't have money on me, I got two coupons thinking I could get it for free but I was wrong
---
Cool. Freddy next pls
---
Looks sick. I need it.
---
Could use some work with some more detail. Since she’s supposed to be more decay than flesh. 5/10
---
Myers too is great at it.
---
Except survivors should be incentivized to do the totems at base, and not need a counter to hold their hand. You're acting like the only way survivors could be assed to do the totems is if they had a number counter.
---
Anyway to keep track of the no. of totems as survivor?
---
Ouch. Feels bad. I’ve personally always thought that they should do what Overwatch does and set a Rank Range Limit. On Overwatch Competitive it’s made so that lower ranks cannot play with higher ranks. Not sure how they would but maybe at least make it within 1-2 brackets of each other. That would prevent Rank 1-4 from playing with Rank 13-20. And Ranks 5-8 from playing with 17-20. 
---
There’s a lot of things from Overwatch they could adopt that would greatly improve the game.
---
Is the game any good?
---
Of course, if the second killer glitch comes back he must find his brethren
---
I do it to secure a better tomorrow
---
Hates NOED because it's a "crutch" but will happily bring Insta-heals/Adrenaline every game
---
Maybe this could be a part of the netflix partnership?
---
As a killer *and* survivor player, I want them to do away with Ruin and make gens slower naturally. However, not by increasing how long you hold m1 and drift off, but by actually putting in a secondary objective, like finding parts. The system, naturally, would need to be made so that you can't camp parts. 
---
Furthermore, I want them to implement all intel perks on survivors by default. Kindred, Empathy, Bond, whatever. Show every solo the same info that swf's have. Show survivors the perk loadouts of their team, too. Then, when survivor strength is more homogenized, buff every killer except Nurse and Spirit (they're competitive as they are) to be able to deal with that level of survivor 
---
 gameplay. The only issue with this change would be, in my opinion, that low-tier play would be even more shifted in the killer's favor. However, I do think that's not too much of an issue. Killers are gonna stomp newbies anyways, and any game worth a lick of salt is balanced from the top down.
---
Bruh, it's easy as hell.
---
This isn't even a normal great skill check.
---
It's about the size of a "good" skill check zone, and you know exactly when it's happening.
---
Why nerf the god killers?   If they can bring every other killer to Nurse tier, it pretty much solves a lot of problems with this game on the killer side.
---
Thank goodness someone else says this. As survivor, the worst part of Rank Reset has to be going through those dreaded purple ranks. They are literally hell on Earth. You always have to do everything: loop the killer, rescue teammates, and do gens. Always. Aside from a few here and there, survivors at purple ranks are potatoes who don’t know what they’re doing. I’ve seen people make better plays at double digit ranks.
---
Same, and that actually a really nice idea!
---
Please no...
---
&gt; Or do most survivors really want games that last 3 minutes where all you do is ~~some generators and then leave~~ **get slugged and die**
---
Fixed it to describe Nurse games.
---
I don't say gg after Nurse matches anymore because well fuck, it wasn't a good game, you just kicked ass because you've mastered a broken killer. And half the time they bring a Mori. What the fuck happened to people that we so many Ebony Mori Nurses running around? Were people not hugged as kids?
---
Think it’s a waste of perk slot coz not all killers camp unless Ure in brown rank
---
Right now, rank 5. If you play the game long enough, you see some odd complaints.
---
How do I prevent other players from feeding me to the killer? I swear it feels like every other match there is that one asshole who runs the killer back to me every time they get hit. 
---
I deliberately punish these survivors when I play killer because it's so aggravating to me.
---
Im always confused when this happens. Is it lag?
---
Why do you keep nerfing the Pig?
---
It'd be terrif-
---
and that's why Legion is too OP. I mean...what?! Time just skipped forward! Stay on the lookout, gang!
---
Thanks !
---
Reeeya reeeya
---
When it happened to me I had Adrenaline kick in, I went and saved my friend(Adrenaline was gone and I was now exhausted), I started getting chased and the glitch happened. From my perspective I was kind of teleporting with every few steps almost like it was lag
---
If I see even one person doing something remotely useful I'll stay up there the full time.
---
Killer main here. TOXIC REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!11!!! 
---
I think this game is in a very good spot regarding balance. I see these comments you're talking about on Reddit as well and I think most of them are ridiculous. Apparently Bubba needs to have Carburator Tuning Guide and Scratch Marks part of his base kit? I think that's a bit overkill.
---
Anyways, as killer I understand that they're just trying to do their best to win and flashlights and instaheals are a great way to help and they can sort of be countered by perks or strategies. What I don't like survivors doing is teabagging at me. It just feels unneccesary and mean.
---
**Things i've had killers complain about.** Decisive Strike. Mettle of Man. Infinites &amp; Looping. Body Blocking. Borrowed Time. Gen Rushing. Flashlights. Sabotaging Hooks. Survive with Friends. When a survivor spawns near a hex totem. Immersive Clothing. *Please add since I know i'm missing things.*
---
I see people saying often that Eddie Gluskin would be a cool killer to bring to DBD, with Waylon being the survivor. Would be bad ass honestly.
---
Well when i play with my friends i actually will prefer them to bring the killer to me so they can heal and then it can be like a cycle of passing them off
---
0/10 not a brown medkit, No Solidarity and Slippery Meat.
---
Use a map to see nearby totems
---
Are there ever any community tournaments?
---
Aww man
---
Why thank you, can’t wait for spirit
---
If they pop traps, teleport and hit them. Don't trap in obvious spots, unless if it is something like a big loop - ironworks for example. Survivors popping traps = survivors not on generators and easy to hit.
---
If survivors can time it so well that they sabo a hook just before I reach it, props to them. even if they just 99 it
---
There is no killer rulebook and there is no survivor rule book. Only your morals.
---
This is why I run Kindred.
---
Same person who is doing the unhooking will cry about tunneling/camping after the game when killer was breaking a gen 10m away and goes back to re-down
---
NAAAAAAAAAAAAARNACIAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Good News! I never need to worry about Left Behinds clogging up my bloodweb.
---
As a survivor main I'mma tell you to fuck off yeah. Survivor queue times are shorter so there's no reason for you to puss out and not just take the L and move onto the next game. Moris suck but I'm not gonna waste a killer's time since their queues take like 8 minutes while mine take 2.
---
I got called a tunneling bitch just now, only reason I tunneled him was cause he tbagged at the first pallet and had zero chase game.
---
Dumbasses I swear.
---
I feel this man lol
---
Distracted spirit for 5 gens in the game bathroom by trading hooks, pallet saving and DS'ing her with a friend. Then I outmindgamed her in the door to escape.
---
I don't know, why must you be so petty as to remark on his pettiness?
---
I figured they changed something. My fps on rotten fields was chillin at 144.
---
Kindred is definitely one of the better perks man what are you talking about, the amount of times you get left first hook without it is insane.
---
Cant forget sprint burst and dead hard
---
Someone should make a Bubba or Myers movie. Hell I'd probably even watch a Freddy one
---
the horse takes the L
---
Trying to get 50 marked downs with ghostface for the achievment
---
Pipped is how it's said. Basically means ranking up and down. Pipped up / de-pipped. -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.
---
Or...just a thought...work on the bugs in their game and make it an overall better experience.
---
Adrenaline would still be helpful though
---
I see no problem with this being added tbh
---
He...he was just standing there a second ago! How...how could this hap-
---
*coughs up blood*
---
N-...nani?! Giorno...he's...he struck again *falls to the ground*...you must take the arrow...destroy the Hex totem...only one...last...gen...left... *dies on hook*
---
He should have just listened for the injured sounds in the locker
---
yeah, i’ll join up too
---
Cry
---
Its a swf, they try to balance killer ranks with the people in the swf, though sometimes it turns into 2 rank 3s and a rank 18 against a rank 18 killer
---
Unless Nurse
---
Nah I don't d/c I just don't really try or care either
---
Yes BHVR, this post right here.
---
he can already teabag so i'm taking that
---
Relevant username
---
I was on board until they somehow correlated video production with game programming? I have to laugh
---
I would do it more if you guys didn't crouch by the killer five meters away, hoping he's gonna leave.
---
I mean, unless they are going for a full feature film released in theaters, the budget is pretty much anything you like. They also have the possibility to lend their IP to netflix or w/e to make a movie or show about it.  
---
If they want to do it themselves, the problem is finding the right people for the jobs since will need writers, video editors, producers, directors, etc. I don't know much, but assuming they don't mind a lower quality, they could probably get sub par equipment and with some luck get some talented staff that doesn't cost too much.  
---
The problem would be if the cost is worth the benefit, unless they get netflix or something to make it, they would either have to go full quality with a huge budget and hope it does well at the boxoffice, or go low budget youtube series that probably won't get too much traction, but will still satisfy and attract fans.
---
Stridor is actually an excellent detection perk, superior to Whispers if you know how to use it. It does take some getting used to, but it does exactly what it says on the tin. Thanatophobia isn't currently doing its job, hence it's her worst.
---
Thx
---
It's an add on that replaces the snares with dream pallets
---
Maybe even ghostface could get a movie where he shares his kills online?
---
I run it. Sometimes
---
She’s definitely Top 3. Nurse will permanently be #1 despite her learning curve. Two and three are between Billy and Spirit hands down. Prayer Beads Spirit is almost always GG in my experience.
---
A witch puppet for ash. Halloween costumes for survivors in general. Would be sweet
---
Love prayer beads
---
Hear me out, but what if they used the 80s aesthetic on this killer? Give it some sort of 80s teen slasher horror feel.
---
Nurse on ps4 is rare to find though. On ps4 is day spirit is best.
---
This isn't true, you have to run object of obsession along with it
---
Guys, I loled at this.
---
Better than taking the D.
---
very very nice !!!
---
Freddy is the lord of mind games, with dream pallets, faking gen teleports to lure survivors to you, and to use gen teleport in chases ( along with the non directional lullaby)
---
I love how you're getting downvoted for speaking the truth. I swear to god this sub has the lowest collective IQ out of any other sub I visit.
---
How many are you wanting?
---
Mori &gt; death hook animation
---
True. Nurse is significantly more difficult on PS4. But when you do find those high rank P3 Nurses....you might as well lay down, try not to cry, and cry a lot. Agreed.
---
first off, before you go whining on reddit you should explain the details especially how badly you played that. we brought 3 syringes but only one of us used it and we didn’t even have to. you literally didn’t dedicate to any of us besides the random nea and you got probably 2 hooks the whole game. it’s just funny how you call it toxicity when we were just outplaying you. you were literally slugging with noed while both exit gates were open, you were too focused on your traps the entire game, ofc were gonna disarm them you’re a trapper buddy. also we barely even had to use balanced the entire game because you wouldn’t commit to anyone. don’t cry on reddit because of our load outs when we played that game like a regular one, not even relying on our syringes.
---
I never understood why when I 4K I get called shit and bad. Like I literally just showed you I’m obviously not shit.
---
There will be another person asking the same thing next week
---
LMFAOOOOO
---
You need to get an add on that replaces snares with dream pallets. Theres 3 add ons that let you get them, gardening rakes. Protype claws, amd paint thinner. Then you press LT at a pallet spawn
---
*laggy skillcheck intensifies*
---
I hate them, I have so many jumpscare clips of me sounding exactly like my Meg when she screams out after getting smacked by it. 💔😭
---
My heart man, it can’t take that shit.

Your own scratch marks can be used to make the Spirit move wrong. I've dodged tons of Spiris even without Iron Will by scratch marks alone.
---
Spine Chill and flashlights can be used to predict or reveal the Spirit's location and can give you concrete information against her or prevent mindgames by flashlighting her face to prevent her from entering phase walk.
---
I like facing Spirit because you gotta see the game from her viewpoint and adjust to it. Most people panic seeing her phase walk but the best thing to is remain calm and choose the best option against her phase walking.
---
Since when is spirit good? I thought she was like C or B tier.
---
All g, at least it seems like they aren't the most toxic I've seen. But still missing respek
---
Wasn't valve only the publisher? It was made by turtle rock studios, guys and garls who made evolve and now makes VR games.
---
That's a spectacularly stupid idea. Just have matchmaking set to the highest rank. Don't prevent people from playing with their friends.
---
Normally I'd agree but all gens are done so it makes sense
---
Once I said "I don't speak burrito." One survivor said "ROFL" and another said "UR A RACIST FUCK"
---
Just being considerate, my guy. Some people are anime only. And some may not have seen the final episode yet.
---
Clearly being outplayed here /s
---
Damn son sorr for the downvotes but these salty killer mains on reddit dont wanna see the truth.
---
how can i minimize chat before it even pops up? is there an option to permanently minimize it? i have not found that yet.
---
I hate these fucking devs honestly
---
Man sounds like you are playing an online game with pvp elements.
---
This is so sad, can we get an F in chat
---
I only watch a few pretty wholesome dbd streamers but it looks like most people don’t or actively fight against the toxicity. They all seem genuinely committed to building a healthy fun community, and that’ll usually be reflected in the chat and the way they interact with each other and the streamer. (If you are looking for some good streamers to watch, otzdarva and ohtofu are both great funny dudes with YouTube channels with daily uploads as well, highly recommend them)
---
Thanks for pointing out the issue for these 3, specially the nurse.
---
Yea but if you think nurse is healthy you don't understand any of the problems.
---
THIS IS GOLD
---
It should make it so that if there red ranks playing with lower ranks, they're more likely to get against red ranks the first few minutes of the q time. If the q is any longer it should put them against green ranks or purple ranks.
---
The only Nurse you can't loop is Omegablink Nurse. A killer that doesn't respect loops = broken, that's why Nurse and Spirit are the best killers.
---
Honestly I think the biggest problem with him is he's got no costume or mask or anything. He just is an old man. Don't get me wrong it could be very creepy, it just is almost too "human" if anything.
---
you can click on a small bar there in the right corner of a chat. works for a session as far as i know. if i close the chat, next time in the endgame screen it's still hidden for me.
---
Had no idea doctor saw his hallucinations
---
Kindred is really nice when playing duo or solo, but in a 4 man its completely useless as you can just use comms
---
Well, atleast they didn't say
---
"Allow us to introduce ourselves"
---
It honestly depends on how you play survivor. If you like playing more around objectives, such as generators, you can try bond, leader, prove thyself, technician, stake out, etc. These perks serve to boost your own and your teammates’ efficiency at completing the various objectives around the map, such as hex totems, saving other survivors, etc. 
---
If you like being the hero of your own horror movie, you could try borrowed time, botany, empathy, bond, we’ll make it, etc. These perks serve to heal teammates quickly and increase their chances of survival. 
---
If you like being a resilient, hardy soul you could try decisive strike, adrenaline, unbreakable, tenacity, deliverance, etc. These perks essentially give you extra lives and make you the bane of every killer’s existence. 
---
If you like slipping away unnoticed and enjoy juking, iron will, spine chill, dance with me, quick and quiet, etc. can aid in that. Though with this build and play style you might end up getting yelled at if you play too stealthy, so keep that in mind.
---
The uses for the tantrum really just boil down to survivor’s being stupid and cocky because they underestimate you as Leatherface, such as when they hide in a locker and jump out way too early because they forget it exists, or I had a down recently where I downed the third survivor and the last one tried to rush in to instaheal while tantrum was happening. It’s not really THAT useful lol.
---
Yeah, but I'm relatively new, so literally the only characters I've played were Dwight and Ash, neither are prestiged. And, come on, you can't have a bloody-less Ash!
---
Well, aside from the obvious that the longer you hold the lunge button the longer you lunge. It's all about timing. The more you play killer, the more you can feel exactly the farthest distance that you can lunge and hit someone.
---
Ghosty has the best mori
---
Troll account for attention, get a hobby you insecure fuck
---
Since I first bought the game I’ve wanted to make a movie about the hag I’m applying for film school and it’s the first thing I wanna try and make. So I second this post
---
Oh, sweet. Yeah Borrowed Time is an amazing perk man. Well worth the grind. I never take it off anymore.
---
The thing is this game isn't really competitive unlike Overwatch. There's no rewards so no reasons to try enough to get higher than green ranks. It would just make qs slower if you seperate ranks as players might derank to play with lower rank friends
---
Gorgeous
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WDj-zz-DMGw
---
Exact same thing happened to me to other night, apparently it happens when you hit a Survivor during a lag spike, at least that's what I was told
---
Actualizing by vocalizations. Making something happen by saying it. If they ........ Yeah..... no its just salty screaming.
---
Camping is a legit strategy. Sorry you don't like that but that's been in games since Doom in 1993. Behavior has already given survivors multiple perks to counter including repeatedly buffing Borrowed Time to now where a guy with Borrowed Time can mindlessly hook rush and get the save.
---
Survivor side annoyances: Idiotic teammates do nothing while killer is distracted for 10 minutes and always make the wrong choices when it comes to saving you 
---
Killer annoyances: Literally running in a circle for 4 minute intervals with a 20 second break in between
---
Amen
---
No I realize that. The ranking system is literally there for balance, not competition. It’s why they should have a casual que and a competitive que.
---
Hey, come on now.  Don't me like that.
---
*puts you on a hook instead*
---
There we go.
---
What a fucking sore loser. He deserves it.
---
I know. I thought I'd give it a shot but it's obvious that it's impossible to have meaningful discussion with survivor mains because they want the game to remain broken so they can remain as the power role and/or they enjoy trolling the killer.
---
thank you!!
---
Knowing my luck, I'll probably never see it on the bloodweb. :P
---
At least they got the blood points
---
Honestly it really is just because he waited so long to eat hits and missed his swings lol That was all just a misplay on his part
---
Don't bother trying to explain it. People who don't want to admit that SWF is broken are always going to try to pull out the "you just don't want people playing with their friends" strawman.
---
Pyramid head was the monster to a specific person. That's the deal with silent hill. Everyone gets a personal hell tailored to them. Doesn't really work with DbD, unless we wanna have another dream monster that slide walks around with a D tier power
---
Hag is pretty good too if the survivors are idiots, a lot of times they’ll set off a trap running to the hook and then continue to try to unhook the survivor as they think they have a few seconds but then you can usually just teleport back and grab them off
---
Forgive me,  but isn’t nurse technically a play on silent hill? 
---
Though pyramid head would be wicked.  A power to passively make the map get darker after each gen is completed. With the noise was it because dark and silent (my favorite sound)
---
I mean Freddy is a demon in the sheets and a killer on the streets
---
Just fucking loop him maybe? He’s on the same level as Wraith at a pallet.
---
Yep, but in other games I can turn that shit off which is good.
---
*leather noises*
---
noice
---
Yeah, he died in 2015, I think of brain cancer.
---
Was this wig randoms? How did you communicate that you wanted to set up a slug race?
---
Seems like a bug because I saw this yesterday
---
Duddeeee I had a guy when I first started this game insidious camp with Billy. He had Insidious, Whispers, Deerstalker, and knock out.  (He camped the people he slugged rather than hooks)
---
Yes but did they fix the hunters looking like a tuna can on deathgarden? Or get rid of the never catch up box........ That game was such a train wreck in beta.
---
Swf can be broken. I’ll agree to that. But having cons isn’t always an end all be all. It really just depends. There should be a game mode that allows multiple killers called Kill WITH Friends. There would obviously need to be more survivors for it to be fair, and they could limit the grouping to only “X” amount of survivors can join together and then they have to que with other random groups or solos.
---
Solidarity works really well on this build.
---
I wouldn’t wait there I would wait on the stairs xD
---
I legit saw someone run that medkit this month
---
Having a macro to spam the struggle button for you is great for these situations cos i can happily fuck around and get myself some snacks while the killer gets a kill and my teammates escape fine, takes nothing out of my day lmao.
---
Didn't appear when being chased by a killer with NOED, 7.8/10.
---
Guess you’ve never ran an infinite. Or a jungle gym. Or a T/L wall. Just...oof
---
Right, I hate camping but at the very least have the decency to not be in my line of sight. So rude
---
Seeing that middle-school aged kids play Dbd is the least surprising thing I've read today
---
It’s super difficult. Kinda feels like Dead Island with parkour
---
Okay really short notes here
---
Matchmaking take shorter time
---
Matchmaking with my rank level not sweaty rank 1’s
---
Totem spawns yes, but make sure survivors could get to them
---
Make some survivor perks better so my time as killer is more entertaining yet challenging (Sabotuer etc)
---
Make the exit gates a bit farther apart so I can’t just sit in one spot scouting both of them.
---
Fix hatch spawns in Freddy maps. Make it more random.
---
Maybe get notified where the basement is at the start of the match?
---
Dedicated servers should cone quicker.
---
Have killer made by the dev team not from movies (Well I just want more like that)
---
Survivors
---
Make DS timer go down when the killer stops chasing you and make it shorter, but stop the timer when he is chasing you.
---
Jakes Perks need more buffs.
---
Head On doesn’t do exhaustion only has a cooldown like quick and.quiet and make it work.
---
Again Dedicated servers.
---
Borrowed time should be a bit longer in my opinion.
---
Have a common Flashlight, Key, and map.
---
Have add ons for the firecrackers that work with all firecrackers.
---
Spirit shouldn’t have her noise thing go away. Maybe have it delayed?
---
More survivors that the dev team creates and not based off of other things.
---
Distortion should have 5 tokens
---
Killers shouldn’t get any bloodpoints for camping, but the survivors should get more for struggle. It’s boring when you get face camped and I feel like I wasted my time.
---
No Mither should get a buff for endgame. Maybe Adrenaline built in?
---
Anyways I’m done constructing this comment I want to get to some more DBD memes.
---
I want 90's style FMV's with college actors, bad effects, and so much ham that the release of each video will prompt PETA to protest.
---
If the survivor team played well, weren't toxic or bm-ing, and I have no kills by the time the exit gates are open, I'll probably let the survivor go if I have them downed. I don't deserve any kills that game if I did so poorly.
---
I think it's at base. Regardless of how well the SWF team does, they are privy to information and have a level of coordination/efficiency that they were simply not meant to have. But that's just my little nitpick with your comment. 
---
Yeah, I think something like that would do well. I've always thought that the devs could've just had SWF and KYF as one thing from the beginning in its own separate game mode, like a free-for-all.
---
Yeah nerf survivors again /s
---
For real tho,  why can't they do this? It gets so annoying getting tunneled by 80% of pigs because I have a hat on. :(
---
u/primadonnap
---
That's my tactic. I run Kindred, teabag hard killers and let them camp me, they Noddle and think I'm mad, actually I'm laughing loud while other mates gen rush.
---
Run bond or empathy and just run away when they get close if you want to play like that
---
Hmm maybe he was new as well haha

Well done, good job on the research feller :)
---
dang bro u are truly a hero and very brave!
---
With survivor, I tried not to blame my teammates for my own mistakes, but watching no one do gens while I struggled and died on my first hook was infuriating.
---
As killer, my main annoyances came from picking lower tier killers, getting looped forever, and then having the survivors BM me because I wasn't playing perfectly. Like.. yeah, cool, you beat me when I'm using Leatherface. Congrats, go fuck yourself.
---
Bröther he had the rank 1 killer achievement on steam. 🙃
---
You know I think there is a difference, but I can’t tell what it is...
---
I'll take an ugly but playable map over a pretty one where I can't see anything.
---
On the killers screen he was still a bit higher.
---
He wouldn’t get hit if he fastvaulted
---
Animations are misleading, this hit was legit.
---
&gt;The fact that you can put a healthy survivor into an injured state in Frenzy is good enough
---
So by the same logic, Trapper is also borderline OP because his traps both injure AND keep the survivors immobilized. That means that there's gotta be a ton of people using Trapper at high ran-oh wait, nobody uses him either.
---
Then you bring up mobility, which is indeed not that bad when in Frenzy, but when you consider that Billy/Nurse/Spirit have even better mobility, and on lower cooldown, how is Legion the broken one? Not to mention that these 3 can actually either down survivors outright or yank them off gens without warning while using their mobility. Legion will at best just get a hit in, which might do nothing but inflict a deep cut if the survivor is already injured. 
---
As for using Frenzy to chase people, just forget it. You can close the distance, but unless you are playing against potato survivors, they'll use the fact that you can't actually down them while in Frenzy and have a stun when you finish against you, and either hide or reach the next pallet while you are stunned.
---
I'm not complaining about the stun. It is definitely debilitating, and something i dont like when i play Legion, but i understand that the lack of it would make Legion broken. I merely pointed out that it is a much bigger hindrance when it comes to chasing survivors than you think, since you were so quick to dismiss it as nothing but a mild inconvenience.
---
What's aftercare?
---
Have you seen the new perk called “Dead”? It’s the new way to DC without Dcing
---
Switch your inversion button to something youll never hit like triangle

I've been having the idea where SWF and KYF is combined into its own game mode (separate from ranked play, which would be solo, obviously). No ranking, no BP, every loadout item is available to everyone, and it's basically a free-for-all.
---
Man this hurts me on a personal level
---
As somebody who has been face camped many times after dropping a hook in front of a killer, apparently yes.
---
I didn't read this and I posted a comment similar to yours.
---
Let's marry.
---
@ all who say Kindred sucks, free vision to everyone. Coordination is so important in this game. 
---
So many times when I'm on hook, 2 survivors come to rescue when you actually need one, with Kindred they can continue do gens and see if someone is going for the save and also if another is getting chased from killer, revealing his position.
---
Plus where the gens other surv were working are.
---
And it's amazing VS facecampers!
---
No? It's just super boring to run around in circles for ever, it's just not fun, it's tedious and repetitive, with little to no satisfaction when you actually hit them.  
---
Instead of playing the useless boring killers and get needlessly bullied, people decide to play one of the 2 killers with a skill cap higher than the survivor's, and they keep playing them until they are really good at them.  
---
Then, when they encounter those survivors that can only loop and nothing else, they easily kill them because they play in a way that isn't good against nurse.  
---
And because people cry that they shouldn't have to learn to play stealthy against nurse, that's like crying to the dark souls devs that you shouldn't have to learn how to beat different bosses, and that you should just be able to button mash your way through all bosses because that's what you can do in other games. It's ridiculous.  
---
I'm not saying nurse shouldn't be adjusted to make it more fun for everyone, including the killer, I'm saying that before they do that they need to make it so that the killers other than nurse and spirit aren't ALL forced to be in a cartoon, hoping the survivors mess up to have any kind of fun.  
---
I mean, playing as killer should give you the thrill of the hunt, chasing a puny survivors to kill them like in the horror movies, but it ends up as a joke. Could you imagine a thrilling horror movie based on DbD gameplay? It would be impossible, it would be a comedic children's cartoon like scooby-doo.
---
I know right? I saw it when the skin was in the store and the merit badge looked fermi liar. Once I realized what it was the biggest grin came on my face as I said “waaaiiiittttt...”
---
It’s almost never a lag switch. Just your/his bad internet
---
You probably need to be chased / loop more
---
I'd say Freddy's dream pallets need a nerf. Make it so that you get X tokens for free, but to get the rest you need to break pallets for it. His snares are fine where it's at tho.
---
Eyyyy, anybody want some pills?
---
Pills here
---
PILLS HERE, just so you know
---
It lets you see the auras of any teammates who you unhook or heal, or they unhook or heal you. The effect lasts until you are hooked. Personally I think it's extremely underrated.
---
This is (ironically enough) extremely beneficial to Freddy. He can trap the hex totem and then teleport back to said totem via the gen anytime the trap is triggered. I've even seen a video of a Freddy doing this very thing on one of the farm maps and he completely shut down an entire fourth of the map.
---
Thank yee, took about an hour but it was all for fun.
---
I mean, NOED *is* good.  If survivors choosing not to cleanse dulls because it is a secondary objective and not contributing to escaping then a perk punishing said behavior is fine.  Like how DS is fine because a killer should go for the unsafe hooker anyways.
---
I always tbag the illusions
---
really? 
---
I thought once all gens were completed you could either open a door or close the hatch to start EGC
---
Big oofs. Ya hate to see it happen.
---
Lmao i literally just watched Noob do this exact build
---
But what about your bloodpoints?
---
There used to be a juke you could do with the vacuum that would allow you to switch sides and stun at the same time. I’m guessing he’s an older player who didn’t realize it got patched out.
---
lost count of how many times this happened to me with insidious bubbas
---
But if it doesn't, the pawn will eventually promote to a queen. Turns out it was an powerful Ruin afterall
---
Ya i need to know pls
---
that's called a selfless act, friend
---
Why is this being downvoted?
---
If a hallucination stays spawned for more than just a couple of seconds, they give an aura that doctor can see, and can be used for tracking.
---
Not exactly. 
---
Forgive me for the long response, im really passionate about Silent Hill stuff.
---
It's true that silent hill does create a personal hell for those who are running away from their sins, refusing to rehabilitate themselves after doing something regrettable, or denying a horrible truth that they themselves cannot mentally handle, but the monsters seen in the town are from the persons cognition. 
---
Thats why nobody sees the same things as James.
---
Though it's never explained what monsters Angela and Eddy are seeing (except for the abstract daddy) it is confirmed that the monsters James sees, are his creations. 
---
The town of silent hill didn't create pyramid head, James did. The town only gave it a physical form and spread its image across the town as a way of saying to James "you cannot escape from what you have done, you will be punished. Unless you accept the truth and move on, only then will he go away". It's the same for all his monsters really.
---
It's kind of like how Angela always sees the town on fire. She needs to move on from what she did to her father and needs to start some kind of self rehabilitation, or else she'll be swallowed by the flames forever.
---
These monsters James sees, are walking symbols of repressed sexual frustration, anger, and a punishment to James for what he did to Mary ( i.e. pyramid head).
---
How I see it is that, if the entity is able to cherry-pick it's victims, couldn't it also probe the mind of the same victim for some kind of "inspiration"? 
---
I wont explain it here, thats what my project is for, but I hope I can somehow change your mind on this topic.

---
anime only puts that burden on their selves when the manga is available
---
&gt;Let’s marry. (Edit: nvm you like anime)
---
lol
---
I choose to focus on protecting the Laurie’s who don’t equip DS
---
I'd probably only keep the killer image, or made the screenshot more blended and with no frame so it's not that harsh. Good idea tho.
---
I’m more of a dweet protector but lauris without decisive rare really rare sadly
---
You're shit because in order to win you had to use perks, offerings, your ability, lunge and quick attacks, and WSAD. Only when you can 4K without these crutches are you a true skilled killer.
---
Meg has red hair to use
---
As a killer main I vibe with what you’re saying team of 4 looped me so fucking hard when I was playing Leatherface along with having 4 flashlights and then I say at the end “Gg but not much I could’ve done with such an easy killer to loop” and they responded with shit like “Leatherface is fine” and “You just didn’t play him right” dumbest shit ever. I hate toxic survivors who literally use like 4 flashlights and loop and then act like you were a noob because there was literally nothing you could do with the perks and killer you had. Plus these are the same people that get butt hurt when you camp their ass because camping them for 2 minutes is faster than spending 8 more minutes getting looped by them and their teammates are likely to come try to save them.
---
this made me hard
---
To each their own
---
Holy shit, this rocked my world
---
Lul I'm such a nerd for a 12 year old
---
I could see the argument that The Nurse is heavily inspired by the nurses from silent hill, but they're both very different conceptually.
---
It's kinda like how they took inspiration from friday the 13th and made the trapper. Though Jason and the trapper look very similar, they're very different conceptually.
---
I did make a killer concept for pyramid head a while back that is pretty similar to what you're describing. If you're interested, I could give you a link to it.
---
A fun type of evil at least
---
Of course it's not guaranteed to never work above rank 10, it's just predictable and not worth trying to fake out.
---
On the spine chill topic, most spirits are not going to look straight at a survivor while haunting, and if they try it at a dropped pallet they will most likely be looking around the object the loop is at and not at the other side of the pallet which will tell the survivor if they are still on the other side of the pallet or coming around.
---
EZ downvote.
---
This is so incredible! I gave your insta a look too and a follow. You are so insanely talented!!! I'm super impressed, keep up the amazing work!
---
Not to mention on every map the survivors can get lucky with pallet placements to the point where they can get 4-5 gen loops if they’re really lucky.
---
far too much time for them to make one about something you know a load about, to get people drawn in, etc... That’s a LOT of animation time aswell
---
I never understood body blocking hooks. Why have survivors tank 3 hits or so just to save 1 hook?
---
Essentially was my response. He said “no ability huh?” And I just said “I didn’t need it really”
---
Forgot Dead Hard and adrenaline
---
I don’t think so, because it technically doesn’t count as “Healing”, since you’re basically just fixing yourself from an Ailment.
---
Say how face camping them is scummy meanwhile they looped me for 6 minutes or saying how I face camped them because I put a trap down next to their hook and then chased after the survivor coming for the the unhook
---
I don't understand why so many survivors still run DS. It's garbage. Any good killer will just wait to pick you up and do other things first until the trigger-time is up. Sure there are moments where that is not an option but thats like 1 in 20 cases
---
Probably just shit survivors then, I’ve had survivors manage to go from being completely behind me to sprinting to my side and blinding just in the span of the pick up animation
---
The more noise/movement from the cylinders a generator does, that means it’s being progressed on.
---
Go perkless.
---
They hated Jesus because he told them the truth.
---
Kindred, dead hard, openhanded(or decisive if you can actually hit the skill check(which i cant)), bond is a disgusting build if you know how to loop/waste the killers time. Dead hard for obvious looping reasons, bond and open handed so you don’t lead the killer to anyone (and if he leaves you, open handed makes finding someone to heal you easier), kindred for the facecamp. You don’t even have to t-bag, you’ll get facecamped a good number of times, and then your team can get gens doje and leave, provided they aren’t all mouth breathers and try and unhook you in front of the face camper.
---
I call the build Red Skull, i guide others to a treasure that i cannot possess, like surviving.
---
Your not wrong
---
Thanks, and yeah I will do every killer and maybe survivor
---
I use Premonition and yes. Although Spinechill is much more useful, as you can tell if she is mindgaming you at Loops or not.
---
every week the same question...
---
It's been confirmed it matchmakes with the guy who STARTED the lobby. It USED to average ranks but when they changed matchmaking not anymore.
---
I've been the victim of 3 rank 1 Ochido Wannabes's capturing footage and bullying the shit out me for their juke montages with their rank 20 buddy all with instaheals and meta perks. Frustrating because if the rank 1 started the lobby the squad would have been put with rank 1 killers but nah, GOTTA EZ CLAP DA BABY KILLERINOS.
---
How do you do this?
---
for blend in with your background you should have put P3 Claudette lol
---
Avoid the DCs
---
Hey fuck you. I've had way too many games ruined by SWF.
---
😔😔

After you down the P3, flashlight spamming Claudette.

What's going on? Is your antivirus flagging something?
---
A lot of the game for Killers without movement Perks/Abilities should be about patrolling Gens, and breaking pallets.
---
Pick 3-4 Gens that are nearby and easy to monitor, and stick to those. Don’t be afraid to end chases after you break a Pallet, or if someone is particularly hard to catch.
---
This was pretty late but thanks for the effort
---
Do what you need to win.
---
Sounds cool. When do you take the skill check penalties? Are they always there or only when you see a killer?
---
Even if I was going to lose the match, I never camped a hook unless the survivor was being a particularly annoying teabagging asshole, and it was clear I was going to lose the match anyway; might as well drag someone else into a depip with me if they can't take their win graciously.
---
And I mean, I understand that survivors do what they have to do in order to win. I never had a problem with anyone using what was given to them in order to win; I was far more annoyed at BHVR for not finding ways to better balance the game so that people didn't have to rely on super anti-fun mechanics to squeak out wins.
---
Like, the last month I was playing, if I wasn't playing Nurse or Spirit with meta perks, I would just AFK on most of the Coldwind Farm maps. On most of those maps, if the survivors aren't complete potatoes, or the killer isn't a fucking god, the map was just about as fun as zipping your pants up on your dick.
---
Seriously, jungle gyms you can't mindgame on because they are see through, some of the worst loops killers have to deal with (cow tree), and most of the maps being fucking enormous with corn that is a nightmare for someone who is red-green colorblind, and it was just... no, not gonna do it. I'll just wait in the basement.
---
There's no way to copy their save data. It's stored on BHVR's end and there's nothing on users' PS4's.
---
I follow 2 simple rules as killer.
---
Don't face camp.
---
Don't tunnel when given equal choice.
---
Exceptions apply.
---
Tunnel the guy with a literal target on the back of his jacket. Flashlight clickers and teabaggers as well.
---
I will not hesitate to investigate any sign of survivors near a hook. Scratch marks, footsteps, groans of pain etc. If you can't bother to hide your presence or just so happen to get unlucky, oh well.
---
Imo they're absolute snooze fests
---
Thanks
---
I love when I get dueling messages from survivors, one calling me a good killer and respect for not camping/tunneling. The other calling me tunneling camping trash.
---
I’m unsure of a general guide so you’d probably have to look one up but most gaming keyboards have the ability to make macro keys, and you can set it up to press the struggle (ie space bar) button every 0.15 seconds or something like that, and all you have to do is click it when you get hooked and remember to click it again to turn it off when you die/get rescued. Sorry I’m not very specific it’s been a while since I’ve done it. Additionally your mouse should have a similar setup if your keyboard doesn’t.
---
Nah.
---
Traps aren't supposed to be delayed Moris, but game slowers.
---
All she really needs is for traps to activate on unhook, rather than on gen-completion.
---
I may be out of my league here at rank 9 survivor but I feel bully is just fine on lery.
---
Have had several kick my ass and teamates asses with that chainsaw on that map.
---
You forgot left behind and vigil
---
If you aren’t playing the game with Headphones/Earbuds, do it immediately. And make sure to enable the “Headphones” option in settings.
---
I know lots of friends who just play using Speakers or whatever was built in, and you’re at a huge disadvantage playing without it.
---
You can hear the Hatch from a moderate distance away, so the best option is just to Run/Walk around the Map, swiveling your camera around until you start to hear it.
---
I had 2 people instant dc against me as Freddy. Guess they can't handle a rank 12 Freddy?
---
survivors mains: spamming Ctrl. 
---
killer mains::)? you know what will happen! they post it here on Reddit obviously.
---
Exactly. I don't struggle for my Teammates. I struggle out of disrespect.
---
What's the deal with body blocking hooks?
---
Seems like a *really* bad idea. Tank 3 hits amongst the team to save one hook? *Why?*

---
85% of survivors are backwards as hell. If you "camp", you're a trash ass killer. If you let them unhook and get some bloodpoints in, you're a trash ass killer. They all do that tea bag shit then want to disconnect when they're dying.
---
I play mostly killer and think SWF is fine. 
---
I also think people who cry about SWF are just whiny bitches who need to get good.
---
Jane ... she is enjoying it.
---
This is an awesome concept I really hope they do something like this in the future. Only thing I’d change is the logo placement, I’m not a big fan of it not being centered like it normally is but I’m not quite sure if there’d be a better place to put it.
---
I love defensive strike
---
Not that I know of. However, many survivors will be injured against thus increasing your chances of catching one with nurses calling.
---
Maybe bring thanatophobia as well?
---
- rank 12 killer
---
this is such a huge improvement
---
Not from my experience, I've got some crazy far hits through windows with chainsaws. I'd love to be corrected if you have source
---
Grabbin’ Bills!
---
Once all the gens are completed you can open the door. However, if you trigger it before all gens are completed by closing the hatch, you cannot open doors.
---
Experiencing issues where the game freezes for 1-3 seconds when breaking pallets or swinging. Happens 90% of the time for pallets and maybe 5-10% for swings. Is there an easy solution or do I need to fix/upgrade a certain part of my computer
---
Wow I can't believe he got mori'd that many times by ghostface as different survivors. Really impressive.
---
Imma keep it 100 with you, chief;
---
Going into any match without a full set of good perks is a terrible idea.
---
The art team does not have the same job as the people who write the characters. Skins are basically something for the art team to do for the game
---
Hotfixes for what exactly?
---
I hope the devs do something to counter killers waiting for DS to run out of time
---
They need to make the crawling hatch escapes animation better srsly
---
Ohhhhhh I was pressing LT at pallets without the add on thinking I did it and walking away like an idiot xD
---
Since it is 4v1 there can be 4 times the toxicity from survivor side. If only 1/4 of players were toxic you would likely have one toxic survivor every match.
---
Perhaps tinkerer?
---
Get a notification when a gen reaches 85 percent.
---
Like a train deep inside a cave
---
Why is gas heaven the map for Bill?
---
lmfao
---
It came out on the same patch as Bill.
---
Same reason Grim Pantry is the map for Bubba.
---
The knowledge isn't relevant at all, it's only the instances where you have to guess that are the problems.
---
The killer controls where I can go half the time.
---
r/BoneAppleTea
---
Lmao no when you do it youll get a noise and they appear ghost like up close and highlighted in yellow from afar
---
Or just crouch around me watching as I die, occasionally walking towards the hook and changing your mind. The killer proceeds to get a 3-4k because nobody rushed gens and played a 3v1
---
(Gold) always believe in your souuuuuul
---
Enduring also cuts down decisive strike stun
---
I always do this but there is nothing worse when you see all 3 survivors hiding around your hook not doing gens. Just leave me to die yo and go do gens. Rather than I die while he camps me and is rewarded because none of you did gens.
---
New Freddy doesn't see survivor auras like your talking about anymore. Imagine how broken it would be with his gen teleport.
---
I main P3 Kate and run Kindred too.
---
When you say 'bs op add-ons' do you mean you DC if a killer uses a Black Ward too? Or are you just confusing an offering with an add-on?
---
Aaawww
---
Iri+Belt is straight up unfair and I'd bitch too as a survivor but if you don't have the belt I can't help but feel that it's easier just not to use any addons. With just Iri you pretty much have to save the hatchet for a melee range throw. If you take the risk and throw them at a longer distance and the survivor dodges it your chase is over.
---
Points being rewarded acting as alerts is the equivalent to the sun shining through storm clouds for me.
---
they require a different play style than other killers to counter. it's just something you have to learn to be able to hang around red ranks.
---
This a very intricate meme, I like it, my dude
---
I think that Mike is definitely one of the best killers to play as and against. Haddonfield is absolute shit for killers though. (Trapper is actually pretty decent on it but again, you’d be playing trapper.)
---
Im fine with struggling on the hook just move your lazy claudette havin ass to the next gen instead of staring in my direction
---
Bit of a difference because the killer will lobby dodge before a game begins whereas you dodge the mori 4 people are sat watching a loading screen then getting booted back. Also often survivors will DC a game if they work out a killer is bringing the best add-ons. Seems both sides do wrong but neither is justified in their actions just because the other does it.
---
They said it couldn't be done. You take trapper with Iridescent Stone + Honing Stone. All 4 step in traps, then go down when they free themselves. Wait 4 minutes. 4k without even touching the controls.  
---
... Still get called tunneler + camper.
---
Good anime isn’t considered anime. It’s just a good watch
---
That doesn't make any sense. Every top killer streamer says legion is one of he worst killers in the game and they are right. Everything he can do, mist other killers can do better
---
If you get upset over someone camping, find a new game to play.
---
Thats a opinion. I guess.
---
Yes that is true, but freddy is the clown essentially with a teleport ability and much better add ons.
---
Funny enough I gave badham II and V cinematic names.
---
Badham II: The Good, the Badham, and the Ugly.
---
Badham V: Badham to the Bone.
---
I'm a rank 60 killer... and this is legitimately the first time I've ever seen a survivor perspective in this game. Very interesting.
---
Jane enjoys getting hooked too. I guess pain is her kink
---
The killer can haunt objects after a 3 second charge, if a Survivor interacts with it the killer will be able to hold all survivors for 10 seconds until he attacks one, then he releases the rest and leaves the object. If haunting a generator/hook and survivors perform a successful skill check, you will instead be able to grab a Survivor off the generator.
---
If a Survivor fails a skill check you will be stunned and fall out of the object. If the survivor fast actions the object, you will also be stunned. You can only haunt unused hooks. 
---
Hard counters : spine chill, premonition
---
You know I really disliked these posts until I switched to pc
---
Ghostface has no terror radius so him sneaking up to that wall is only countered by premonition and spine chill. Ghostface peeking around a wall cannot be revealed. Ghostface with iridescent add on can expose a survivor very fast. This situation without spine chill is pretty much guaranteed loss for survivor everytime.
---
Could you link me to where I complained about camping? Merci, I’ll wait.
---
If you want to play killer regularly, you have to get used to teabags. They will do it at every rank against any killer you play. And it doesn't matter if they're really higher skilled than you or not.
---
Yea killers hate it but it is the same as slugging. Survivors hate slugging but do what ya gotta do to win.
---
Facts. Fuckers tea bag and run towards you when the exit game is open then wanna throw a bitch fit and PM you when they get hit.
---
Hey there Delilah what’s it like in New York City...
---
Then this would be a true horror game
---
It's kind of a problem with the community itself, don't you think?
---
They do that to draw a negative emotional reaction in order to make you not think clearly. Remember to focus on the objective and remain calm. Your emotional health is more important...and don’t feel humiliated not every killer is getting 4Ks every match, I’m certainly not.
---
Have anyone got banned for using custom perk/addons images? I’m thinking on using this but don’t want to take the risk
---
Maybe not but the visual of a killer literally juggling survivors is an amusing image.
---
I mean the DC is weak just accept the L as he played that end sequence badly but I wouldn't be saying this is karma to a face camper, unless he did this throughout the match. Once the last gen is done I see it as all bets are off. Realistically if a killer leaves that last hook they are going to end up with 0 kills so it makes sense to guard your 1 kill and maybe down a few altruistic saviours in the process.
---
It's the same mentality as negatively reacting to a good jungler in LoL. The jungler counter jungles, camps top and wins the game.
---
Literally using ingame tactics and mechanics to win.
---
My personal nemesis is LF. He isn‘t very good but out of a hundred I meet, maybe 1 doesn‘t play like a douchebag.
---
I have encountered many swf teams that are not very good so it doesn't make survivors good by default nice try tho. Just cause you can communicate doesn't mean you can loop the killer etc. No matter what you add to this game, players will always have voice chat. No matter what type of game, there is chat options. I think making gens take longer and giving survivors no additional survival chance is a huge nerf to anybody that doesn't play swf and it will make it even more difficult to play without party chat. The in game chat options you suggested can not mitigate a generator that takes twice as long, period.
---
I usually jump into a locker if I screw myself over after getting unhooked with the killer up my arse and ones nearby. Killers seem to forget DS is a thing for locker grabs also.
---
Nah, not just killer mains.  Plenty of survivors think you're both total pussies for doing it too.
---
Don’t forget luck offering, mettle of man and streetwise!
---
Fucking top tier meme right here. Good shit.
---
No that is false dialogue. 
---
Survivors: working on gens is boring.
---
Killers: what if we add extra objectives that you have to do, on top of gens.
---
Survivors: wouldn't that buff every killer and be a bit unfair.
---
Killers: i thought you wanted more, quit complaining then.
---
See the problem here. If survivirs have more objectives, killers need more objectives too to balance. That or add extra hooks or hook time.
---
Finally, sweet sweet death
---
There is 4 times as many survivors and you know that. You also know there are way more rules Miller's have to follow that survivors make up. Also infinites long gone? Have you played ironworks or cowshed recently? If you aren't a 115 killer you will lose the chase constantly.
---
Whoa that’s cool!
---
I can play against it easily if I know which pallets are dropped down but when I'm soloing and don't know all the pallets  the randos dropped down, it's annoying to play against ESPECIALLY if someone wasted a bunch of pallets (MEGAN IM TALKING ABOUT YOU)
---
That's why you jump into a locker or run Unbreakable with DS.
---
Uh it should be nerfed again? It's already been heavily nerfed.
---
Sweet revenge after being tbagged while playing every other killer for 3 years.
---
Rekt him
---
Ghostface is fun, or spirit
---
yeah. also when she gets hit the sound she makes:)?
---
I have a little over 20k and I just keep holding onto them until something “better” comes along
---
BDSM?
---
I feel like Billy needs to be changed to Spirit now.
---
I like how he has same perks all the time
---
The nurse says they are on pc.
---
Nobody's gonna stop doing it just like your allways gonna find killers who tunnel and camp unfortunately not everyone plays the game in a way that's gonna produce the maximum fun for everyone, Im sure everyone's experienced both.
---
Was in a game against a Ghost face with three disconnects he slugged me and proceeded to teabag for 2 minutes straight some people are just really sad. Try to pay them no mind.
---
That's the community. Survivor teabag. Killer brings noed. Survivor saying the killer is toxic. Survivor become toxic. Restart.
---
&gt;  it's the attitude behind it
---
It's not universal, though. Not every teabag is mocking you.
---
Yes, and the rank 20's are actual planks
---
As a survivor, whenever the exit gate is open and everyone is safe I immediately leave. At that point the match is over.
---
Then I go back to spectate and people are just siting there until the very last moment before. Even people that played terribly throughout the whole match and got hard carried by me or someone else. I don't leave back to the main menu immediately because I like to take a look at the killer's perk / add-on. 
---
I struggle to understand what is the point of doing that and people that do this, they never answer when I ask. You are wasting not only the killer's time but also yours.
---
As survivor I don’t mind NOED it is perk in the game. But T baging is being mean intently &amp; wants to annoy the other player and give him bad game experience. 
---
NOED shouldn’t be a perk it should be implemented in the game as default skill with all the killers in addition to 4 perks to their own to choose from. as the survivors have an escape hatch the killers should have NOED with them all the time not as perk but as an entity gift for them, because entity gift survivors the hatch it should gift killers NOED.
---
Hahaha brilliant
---
Me: “Who says I’m bold?” 
---
Game: “You are bold”
---
Adris when she was walking around before getting infected
---
found the bad killer main who got bullied one too many times :(
---
Billy is probably one of worst killers to camp with
---
These Killers tend to want the depip as it gives them easier games. 
---
Also red/purple rank ques are brutal on Killer.
---
DeAd hARd
---
Its too op i dont think its fair so i dont use it
---
Say it with me boys, BUFF M1 KILLERS AND GIVE LOVE TO OUR BOYS WHO SUCK.
---
Every killer should be viable at red rank with enough skill, it’s embarrassing that the game has been out so long and you can only play 3 killers at high rank.
---
Messaged back saying watch out for unbreakable if your gonna do that his response was "You mad, no need to rage" diddnt reply to that if he can't see that's not rage its advice clearly a bit brain dead but it highlights what he wanted to happen glad I diddnt give it to him I enjoyed my coffee though.
---
F
---
&gt; Even people that played terribly throughout the whole match and got hard carried by me or someone else.
---
It's actually funny for me to watch them at the exit gates. Especially if the one who carried them doesn't teabag.
---
I think you should read a message through properly before you reply At no point did I accuse you of doing anything. I commented back on something you said just pointing out that it goes both ways and that your comparison wasn't a very good one.
---
This explains a lot. 
---
But this is still creepy af lol
---
Works for me. Both offerings and BBQ
---
Even with NOED you aren't catching them. They don't stay and teabag there until you're right on top of them. Besides, by the point they're trying to taunt you, you probably already hit another survivor, letting them all know you have NOED. Take it from me, I fast vault lockers and pallets at the exit all the time and always get away.
---
“Hitting a survivor will take away one health state from them”
---
Don’t play blendette at baby ranks and then to try 360
---
I only stay at gates if I'm unsure of where my team is. I don't wanna leave and then they get hooked.
---
As a killer main, I do the same thing
---
Rank 20 killer
---
Well then don't expect to win a match when 2 of your teammates suicided.
---
Most legions bring a mori because of how bad the killer is.
---
Is the spirit really good? I thought she was pretty garbage cuz I never see anyone play her whenever I'm a survivor
---
 (I'm not saying she is garbage tho, I just thought she was since nobody is playing her)
---
TBF we forget it because like 95% of survivors don't go into lockers in that situation.
---
Fun story: Had a Laurie, which was the Obsession (i didn't run an obsession perk), run straight up at me after being unhookep to distract me from their downed friend. I assumed she wanted me to down her, pick her up and get stunned so she could heal her mate and save them both.  
---
Well...I downed her, LET HER LIE THERE, hooked her friend, kicked a gen, smashed a pallet and THEN I picked her up and hooked her too. She suicided instantly and waited the whole rest of the game to insult me in post-game chat.
---
It's only a visual bug.
---
I pointed out how killers dodge because it goes both ways. In your reply you said "when you dodge" while speaking to me as in saying I am doing it. I am not doing it however I did express that I understand because killers dodge boxes and flashlights. I didn't say before or after the match started. Killers dodge before and after it starts. 
---
So please tell me the point you are trying to make because if all it is, is that it goes both ways then my original response already says that
---
 So what are you here for exactly?
---
9. You have to use default clothes (unless you're Claudette)
---
10. You can NOT blind the killer at pallets. If you take a flashlight out of the chest you must waste all of it.
---
11. don't play survivor play killer
---
Yeah i think Myers could be 5 or 6/10 he is ranked a bit too low
---
If you are a nurse main and constantly play nurse and you can't get more than 2 kills you have serious problems lol
---
I need all the bloodpoints I can get lmao
---
Distressing, Unnerving Presence, Huntress' Lullaby, Ruin. Try to get 5 stacks ASAP and get as many people passively shocked as you can. Distressing is mandatory to shock faster, the other three can be changed for PGTW, Infectious Fright, Play With Your Food, STBFL, etc.

TO BE CONTINUED
---
While i love rule 11 whe do still need survivors to kill
---
Just buy the one you like the most
---
Simply dc
---
That’s awesome.. hey now that we mention it, can there be a fix to “Left Behind”?
---
nurse is too much. i’d say bringing every killer to around billy tier
---
I just want the cosmetics that turn meg into zoey. Bill is just a bonus. (Im a feng main lol).
---
12) Don't use self heal that's cheating
---
13) Don't use decisive strike that's cheating 
---
14) Don't use borrowed time...still cheating
---
15) Don't use any survivor items...again...cheating
---
Gotta love it when you have to choose between Left Behind and No one left behind
---
CampFace ofc
---
So basically dont use any perks or items
---
Remember sound that Huntress makes when throwing a hatchet? Imagine how would that sound
---
Have you been experiencing a similar issue?
---
Pretty much, I hear a lot of complaints about self heal. Not just killers but survivors aswell. Especially about people self healing instead of unhooking or doing gens
---
Spirit
---
Everyone I know cleanses it anyway, but they do it one of two ways.
---
Bad Survivors: Cleanses the totem immediately, not caring whether it's Devour vs. Haunted.
---
Good Survivors: Waits until the Killer hits someone in a chase so that it doesn't matter either way.
---
The poor totem spawns kind of make it inevitable.
---
Makes me wish they'd make all of them as good as GF.  Itd be so sick if wraith ripped out the survivors spine.  Definitely would love for them to update some of the old characters, too bad itll never happen.
---
*^(facebook)*
---
Alright I might get her...any tips on how to play her?
---
I *hate* seeing neas as killer. They always teabag.
---
Would also be cool if clown forces the survivor to drink his bottle then cut off their finger
---
Try find a killer that is not retarted
---
Lol what?  Anti tunnel perk where all you gotta do is leave them slugged for 60 seconds. It's not it's old broken self anymore dude.
---
“When you get downed at the exit..”
---
“..and see the killer coming towards you”

Grabbed some peels
---
As a survivor and killer main.
---
Survivors simply don't like to get hooked and you'll get trashed for it if they do.
---
and then theres the doctor with iridescent king
---
Nah nicks meh
---
I’m rank 16 but i keep getting rank 7 people
---
If you use Fragrant Tuft and Judith Tombstone in the same time is it even possible to get to Tier III ever?
---
Usually it's a good idea to let them go regardless what with the multiple Borrowed Times and Decisive Strikes that are in most games.
---
Against a competent Spirit your input is near non-existant. Sure if they are less experienced they are fine to go vs, that's a situation simmilar to the one Nurse has.
---
&gt;I've dodged tons of Spiris even without Iron Will by scratch marks alone.
---
Then they weren't using headphones/didn't have ears.
---
&gt;prevent mindgames by flashlighting her face to prevent her from entering phase walk.
---
I mean she can just look in a different direction when phasing? You play around Spine chill and flashlights that way.
---
Didnt he have a cell phone instead of a camera?
---
Probably because he can hit people often and find more people while doing, leading to good Chaser and Brutality scores
---
You should've specified that you're talking about the perk skin
---
I get down-voted most of the times I say this, but the skill difference between doing generators and ending chases quickly enough to stop three from popping at once really breaks the flow of the game.
---
Most of the killer roster simply don't have the type of map pressure to overcome four survivors on separate generators holding M1 for 80 seconds; even the ones that do can still screwed by loops and windows unless they're Nurse.
---
I am dying at how much the spirit is lookin like double D
---
Use this against prayer beads spirit
---
Use spine chill, completely destroys GF’s power
---
Mine don't anymore because the best killer in our group did the same shit he always complained to us about in kill your friends
---
At least you didn't get insulted, when I play as legion survivors always DC or if they don't and I get a 3 to 4 k I get trashtalked.
---
Can't blame em thought, it's hella boring for me too.
---
Each cylinder is a 25% progress made afaik
---
PELLS HERE!
---
DO USE SELF HEAL
---
it makes it easier for the killer
---
Rank 9 Freddy sweetheart, also I tried to bodyblock as I unhooked the guy but Freddy got him. Also, didn’t actually realise that gate was open, as it had t been when I originally went for the guy.
---
Here’s an idea; shut the fuck up
---
Useful agaisn't legion
---
Face a wall or run Franklin's
---
Almost everyone's a dipshit tbh, i got a lot of insults playing as ghostface 'cuz i didn' t know how to play as ghostface properly, i'm a new player with a killer that has only 1 perk, while i'm facing a swf with good perks and are gen rushers.
---
40€ spent very very badly, i regret playin' this game.
---
*Rank 9, but okay
---
Well its pretty straight forward. You activate your ability and you move faster. While in that mode you cant see the survivor and the survivor cant see you. Also you cant see their scratch marks. So you have to hear and guess where the survivor is. You can use this pretty much everywhere. In Loops, or just for traveling.
---
most killers don't complain about most of those things lol
---
BHVR wouldn’t have so many complaints about totem spawns if ruin wasnt absolutely required on every killer, the gameplay needs to be adjusted or new perks need to be added.
---
Although in this specific case, the Knight can also move to threaten the Rook before the Pawn becomes a Queen, and the other player will have to start trying for checkmate with a Knight constantly jumping out of threat range. :P
---
Prolly a rank 10 killer who tunnels. I think those are the only killers that complain about ds
---
He’s just using sprint burst duh
---
Mori=DC
---
Arent they going to do something like that with the archive things?
---
I run unbreakable, if the killer sits on you and waits for ds or unbreakable, then youre fucked eitherway.
---
I have spent 700 hours in the game, I am not a beginner.
---
Show it in game to prove thyself
---
When are killers not going to have to use ruin every match?
---
When is survivor gameplay getting changes? It’s stale
---
When will you increase BP gain, there’s far too many things in the game to level up for it to be the way it is, make x2 the new default.
---
When will killers other than Nurse, billy, and spirit actually be viable at higher ranks?
---
&gt;The Pig (not finished)
---
ok)
---
Ah ok seems easy enough
---
Might get her soon, who knows lol
---
I'll do it just to postpone the end of the match just as a way to be petty in my last moments. "HAH! I made you wait an extra 10 seconds"
---
And you're trying to say that *wasn't* a troll match to you?
---
I get that NOED is bullshit, but Ruin is easily counterable and easy to deal with. All it does is prevent all the survivors from jumping on one gen and having it done before you get half way across the map, and then another one by the time you get all the way across. Ruin and Discordance essentially do the same thing in practice, Ruin just spreads it out over larger area. The point is, I don't think that Ruin punishes survivors in a way that isn't fair.
---
I don't think so, because the scratchmarks should still point in the proper direction at the end of it (despite being far wider than the running survivor).
---
I think it's some kind of rendering bug, I've had scratchmarks appearing in front of me for the first time when there is no survivor visible, pointing out into huge open areas where they couldn't hide even when crouching.
---
Other times they're all over a large building like Ormond when I know the survivor was only out of sight for two seconds, and they're the last alive, they couldn't have run out the far door and up the stairs at the same time.
---
It really does feel like they activate a cloaking mode when scratchmarks spaz out.
---
I'm sorry but him?
---
It's a **it**
---
She's definitely top 5, most people say top 3.
---
+300% movement speed but only when moving away from any survivors 
---
“Look at his legs Smokey...”
---
-joseph joestar
---
To be fair, I almost always leave a survivor on a hook even if I suspect someone else is near. I might search for them quickly before leaving but I won't hang around. 
---
Then again, I don't play to get pips or rank up, I play for blood points. The way I see it is the more chases, hits and hooks I get, the better.
---
Oh wow, I did not know that
---
Reading comments like this makes me happy to be a killer player that doesn't do this shit.
---
Can't get Ghostface with shards can you?
---
Inb4 the first survivor is the obsession, because the entity just works that way
---
Unlucky
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
What if trapper grabbed the survivor by the leg and lowered their head into a beartrap
---
Is exploit time!
---
Don't 360 killers who are standing still
---
Do 360s as a last resort
---
Do two rotations not one 
---
Don't do what you were doing in this video
---
When running, slightly turn to the left, then rotate right
---
I've recently started only playing a survivor or killer games twice in a row, max. Then switch to the other side. It's much more fun and it's always nice to see things from the other perspective. I find you learn more too
---
I lost it when bill grabbed wraith like they were fucking
---
We need more of these
---
I guess troll isn't the right word. More so like they were trying to win and so was I.
---
There's also a difference between flashlight saving and intentionally getting downed just to be saved.
---
This was more of a problem when flashlights could instantly blind a killer and survivors would chain 4 or 5 together for no reason (since they're not running, just staying there to blind again), but it's still a thing.
---
10 minute killer Qs

---
so fun no one wants to play shitty solo survivor
---
wiggle = hook
---
anyone who doesnt know that will juat shit talk
---
Noted.
---
Let's talk about his strength first.
---
He's the only one killer you cannot hide from. If he's a doctor, you're not gonna hide for long before he finds you. His stall ability is one of the strongest and 3 gen strat works insanely good with him. His power can somehow help in chases, only on specific loops. A doctor's skill is based on the shock timing and m1 killer mindgames. Denying a vault or a pallet drop (when necessary) will result a guaranteed hit. Work on your timing and you'll greatly improve. Also, prioritize shocking people if you know they like to take the aggro. They usually are great at making you lose time and they know how to counter each killer. Just shock them to tier 3 madness and leave. When you manage to spot a survivor in a weak area of the map, chase them and use your power to help. The 3 gen strat need you to patrol only 3 gens close to each other so your route become very short. Shock everyone in tier 3 madness and go kick gens. Works better if there are 3/2 survivors. 
---
His weaknesses tho, is that he lacks map pressure and  chase potential in strong loops (infinites, shack, jungle jim, etc...), as experienced survivor won't camp the pallet but they just keep running. 
---
But those are not a problem, perks exist for a reason. 
---
Normally running brutal strength is good choice, as your shock makes them drop pallet more often than you think. Otherwise, enduring, spirit fury, save the best for the last are all good choices. Tracking perks, absolutely avoid them. You're the doc and they cannot hide from you.  What I really like to run are skillcheck related perks. Ruin, Huntress lullaby, overcharge and unnerving presence are godly good on the doctor because the skillcheck will appear in random location of the screen making skillchecks even more difficuly. Extending your terror radius is another very good choice. If you run distressing and the 2 calm addons, you can literally stand in the middle of a map and apply the effect of perks like coulrophobia, unnerving and overwhelming presence to the entire map. 
---
My personal build as doctor would be:
---
-Hex: Huntress Lullaby. This works better than ruin if you get 3 or more tokens. Even better with the doctor. 
---
-Brutal Strength. Forcing a pallet drop is the order of the day so this can help you reduce chasing time. (OR) Overcharge. If i feel like they're playing swf and they plan to genrush, this perk is a lifesaver. Imagine hex lullaby, unnerving presence, overcharge and doctor's madness; 11% of regress plus basic regress each time you break a gen. 
---
-Distressing. More terror radius is great on doctor for the static field. 
---
-Unnerving presence. Skillchecks become very difficult and paired with hex lullaby, it becomes very very strong.
---
I was close to one too but he wiggled off.
---
Frickin Dwight.
---
there was so much aids in this post I don't even know what to think. both sides are at fault here for being toxic asf. and saying that one side is more toxic than the other will always be wrong. both sides are equally toxic in the way the play unfortunately
---
You can minimise the post-game chat window, and it stays minimised even when you quit the game and launch it again (until you maximise the chat window again). I've found that SUPER helpful because I am no longer getting tilted by hateful and unnecessary comments post-game now.
---
What most survivors are you talking about? From my experience salty players indeed exist, but they are a minority
---
When Wraith kicked the gen was pretty funny too lmao
---
It's not about "fair" perks. All I was saying is that I don't change my gameplay in order to "punish" survivors after I had a bad game. 
---
It's not 100% survivors' "fault", if you bring NOED and/or Mori into the next game. It's your decision.
---
Just because it's out in the open next to a generator in plain sight doesn't mean they won't find it.
---
After all, totem spawns have been improved and are no longer placed in easy-to-find places...
---
At least that's the official BHVR line.
---
&gt;People need to lose the notion that they must 4k/escape every match.
---
But in order to stay at red ranks, do you not basically need to do this every game? 
---
Genuine question by the way. I don't play the game enough to have ever come close to red ranks.
---
Big budget =/= Indie
---
I had a game of playing Freddy before EGC was a thing. Two people DC'd at the start, and there was no way they were going to survive since there was still five gens left to do and the hatch didn't spawn until three gens left. So me and the other two survivors just farmed blood points and I let them finish the gens to escape.
---
It was an ambigious 'you', probably I should of used 'someone' so apologises if that caused confusion. Your original response however was still an unfair comparison as killers will dodge lobbies because of toolboxes etc, very few if any accept a game with them only to DC unless someone quick switched.   
---
My point is that 2 wrongs do not make a right so justifying dcing constantly because of a mori by referencing reasons some killers DC is not a validiction and theirfore you can argue against someone doing something wrong.

Are you sure this animation doesn’t have sound? Cause I can hear it so well haha
---
Camping once gates are powered is perfectly logical, defending gates instead of a sacrifice is incredibly difficult unless they’re right next to each other 
---
As for the slugging, I’d also say he was in the right there, he has no reason to pick you up if he knows your friend is there. If he picked you up his choices would be defend the hooked survivor (while carrying you) and make your chance of escaping better, or go hook you giving your friend a free unhook of David 
---
I’m sure the more *vocal* elements of this community are gonna try and tear me apart for defending both slugging and camping but screw it
---
the best part of maining Legion is that nobody likes us. that, and running Frosty Eyes so that people think they can do gens right next to me

Haha its definitely shitty when it fucking happens.  But thankfully it's not too awesome. And if its gonna happen at least let it be a cool animation. 
---
I've never been morid by a wraith or trapper and been like omg I gotta watch this is so cool.  I like leatherface's mori, but like...he should skin their face or something.  That's kind of his thing 😥
---
And maybe get insulted by my own teammates if i'm a bad survivor? No thanks, i prefer not playing with childish people. I've been around in this community for about 8 months, bought the game 4 months ago, stopped played after 2 weeks. What the fuckvs wrong with survivor mains?
---
I wish Freddy had a movie :(
---
You’re not going to get any interaction posting stuff that everyone agrees with lol
---
I think that ghost, spirit and doctor have the best moris
---
They look nothing like those you picked
---
No Mither OP plz nerf.
---
Survivors must start already hooked.
---
\+
---
Actually the most cancer i experienced was in the purple 8 ranks. Just pure assholes bodyblocking and farming you
---
My wait times for killer aren't that bad, but they do suck. When I queue as survivor I find a match very fast. When I queue as killer I immediately alt+tab and browse reddit until I find a lobby.
---
Ghostface, legion, spirit, doctor, and nurse's are perfect imo. 
---
Michael's is decent, I mean it makes sense. But just for some added flair, have them standing already, sort of like freddy's, have him stab the surv with the knife and lift them up in the air.  He does something like that in his second movie.
---
Well I mean instead of Pyramid Head, it could be The Butcher from Origins. Or just have James be a stand-alone character.
---
Requiem
---
I don't understand why people DC. I tried playing Nurse for the first time yesterday and did ABYSMALLY bad. Was chasing one survivor for at least a couple of minutes because I couldn't work out the teleport distances.   
---
I didn't DC. I knew I lost because I was playing badly. We all had a good laugh about it in post game chat. I think the survivors were just happy they got a free win tbh
---
Literally me with the last survivor
---
To save someone from progressing to another hook stage, and for them to possibly wiggle out. If the killer doesn’t realize it’s happening it can buy some good time.
---
I wish the camera actually took a picture and saved it though
---
Isn't it obvious? This game is the perfect game for trolling. I'm not saying I agree with it, because as a killer main I find that it's the biggest dick measuring contest I have ever seen, but a game the gives players the materials to be dicks to each other is going to have people being dicks to each other for no other reason than for the sake of it.
---
Can someone explain me why killers facecamp?
---
Didnt he do that in the first movie too except that he actually held the person in the air and pinned him to the wall with his knife
---
The thing is at no point in this thread has he even looked at a Survivor viewpoint, just Killer. Which makes you believe that he hasn't played enough Survivor to make a really valid point about how perks are unbalanced. There are perks on both sides that have conditions and specific usability, and reasons that things have to be changed on one side and another for the other to reasonably balance the game.
---
Yeah nothing is truly bonkers broken anymore, the ones I said were my opinion on some of the strongest perks for survs.  Also said I personally don't care, I just like turning toxic complaints back onto the survs when they get especially salty.
---
And yeah, every perk I named substitutes for an aspect of game skill or outright undoes mistakes, and thus can be considered crutches.
---
at the end of the game it adds your points and wont shown up and there may even be times where tokens dont count for certain survivor but everything counts in the end
---
Swiss Cheese is the one with holes, you can say 'memory like swiss cheese', Cheddar doesnt have holes.  
---
\*The More You Know
---
I agree with most of the things here except for:
---
1. MoM was a little too strong and maybe needed even more hits or just nerf it to unhooks only.
---
2. Launch was the most unbalanced unfun piece of shit to exist once survivors knew that infinites existed before window blockers and medium vaults, i know because i played as and against it.
---
I do agree that playing both sides gives you a much better view and idea of where survs will spawn and run to. This game is all about time management as killer, to make the gens even longer would drive even more people to not play Surv and help killers in ways that they shouldn't need (camping, playing horribly, etc.) Games could afford to be longer sure, but an even longer boring M1 Sim with Ruin could fuck right off lol.
---
Please do Mikey too &lt;3
---
Not if they jump into a locker. They can also be picked up right away after you down them. I say DS should deactivate if you touch a gen, unhook a person or jump into a locker
---
Lmao
---
Actually Deathgarden is doing alright this time around. It still has a decent amount of players both new and old and it's getting good, consistent updates.
---
Before the EGC I had a couple killer games against toxic SWFs that I got bodied by due to being new, so once all the gens were done in 5-7 minutes I just sat on my phone to wait for them to leave...only to be waiting 5-10 minutes. Some people literally want nothing more than to make some random person online feel even mildly annoyed.
---
Why don't we just make hex perks become regular perks. Then they can't be cleansed. Problem solved.
---
If you already have it you keep it, otherwise it's now his teachable and works like one.
---
Just get rid of the chat. What's it for?
---
Now, can somebody explain that thing:
---
\- it's fine, and even very good if you stall the killer for 5 minutes by running from him in one long chase, doing nothing else;
---
\- it's bad if killer stays near you for 5 minutes while you're drying on the hook.
---
Both do the same purpose, so what gives?
---
Thank you at least some recognition xD
---
Also helps tremendously vs spirit!
---
Honestly spine chill is really in need of a rework, it’s way too good right now, thankfully it’s more of a sleeper perk and not a ton of people know.
---
&gt;   If they can bring every other killer to Nurse tier, it pretty much solves a lot of problems with this game on the killer side.
---
yeah, and killers can play with themself by then.
---
"rules" are more just a courtesy than anything, just imagine being facecamped or tunneled yourself, and yeah fuck BMers I fully understand that myself and don't do it unless the killer decides to just tunnel or camp me anyways.
---
It was made during closed beta, when I was 16 years old. I was going to "gimnazjum" in Poland which translator translated to middle school. I wasnt THAT MUCH Young when I discovered The game but yeah, I wouldn't be suprised about younger players also.
---
*Blink* Time to die bitches! Also original Surv animations and all, god it was like watching Alpha Access.
---
That's what I mean. Survivors hard looking for the totem, that's great news! More time for me to kill your asses &lt;3
---
Buuuut that's how I'd think. I tried Ruin out Once. Killed all 4 because I was constantly protecting the totem with chainsaw in hand, one of those memorable easy matches. But the reason why I don't play with hex perks in general, is simply because there is always that bad totem spawn chance and seeing my little baby go in the first 30 seconds, triggers me and affects my mood for the entire game. I've played against killers with like 3 hex perks, we found them all. Playing perkless against a bunch of experienced survivors must be horrible, I don't want to go through that.
---
I sincerely don't understand those whining entitled players who suicide on hook if being facecamped.  
---
I find a great pleasure watching stupid killers lose precious time just to secure the only kill of their match.  
---
Actually many of them hope survivors just give up on the hook.**
---
Oh god the nightmare fuel their faces induced...
---
I think most killers would appreciate someone throwing down every pallet they see. I love it when some potato survivor just leap frogs from pallet to pallet then throws it down when i walk up to them (outside of stun range) and I get a free destroy. Then their teammates have a giant path of no pallet deadzones. Bonus points for when they do it against doctor or Freddy and the entire map just becomes filled with fake pallets.
---
I think OP knows they're going to get criticism lmao. It's the internet, if you don't want criticism on something you post, don't post.
---
Some people are just way too petty, glad she got what was coming though!
---
How come flashlight counters Hag more than other killers?
---
The killer stands in front of you whilst on the hook, giving an almost impossible unhook.
---
Ehm...you know we are just joking? Like a parody book?
---
Nah man, there’s something different in Bills cigarette. My guy is on a massive hallucinogenic trip right now
---
started running corrupt instead of ruin
---
now they can waste their time cleansing all 5 totems thinking i have noed :)
---
If every killer was as strong as Nurse I would stop playing BOTH sides. I like a fucking challenge as killer and I like enjoying the game as survivor.
---
Legion and Doctor being as good as current Nurse would make me quit survivor altogether considering both require half a brain cell to utilize to their full strength.
---
Believe me, I don’t like doing nothing but nerfs, but fuck me is Nurse a horrible standard to balance towards.
---
Nah, has nothing to do with that. Bubba is his real name. Ghostface was always the name of the killer, even in the movies. It’s just the movies that were called Scream. And Michael was credited as The Shape in the original movie. They just wanted to stick to the same naming scheme for all the killers. “The ___”
---
Wow... Did he need to put a "/s" too for you? Maybe include "*This is a joke." at the bottom of his comment?
---
when it's a nurse with a slug build it gets old fast.
---
A pip in real life is the smallest unit of something, so a penny is the smallest unit because you can’t have half a penny. And each rank is divided into 5 pips, since these ranks don’t have a xp scale like other game’s ranks. Interesting.
---
Myers spends too much time looking at his knife. While he's doing that the horde will be picking the bodies off the floor.
---
I play killer but mostly cause I get scared as survivor, really anxious at times. But the horrible team mates make it fun to me, like instead of 4vs1 it becomes 1vs3vs1, hatch game, which I find quite interesting. As killer main I seem to be more biased towards killers, so changing mindset to 1vs3vs1 is enjoyable for me :D
---
This could go on a t-shirt with a pissed off looking meg standing in the background lol
---
Unbreakable is among the most rare perks. I see it maybe once in 30 games
---
I hate when people wont just leave!! I'm standing at the gate to make sure everyone is out. Stop messing with the killer and go! Holy cow the amount of times I've seen people die because they wanted to tea bag the gate!
---
But if you got downed the killer is already close to you
---
What if you’re using the machete as Wraith?
---
&gt;Yes, you did!
---
hatch or no hatch. the location depends on if the hatch is there to yeet away in.
---
People get triggered by it because its the survivor pretty much telling you fuck you or you suck you cant even catch me. People dont like being taunted.
---
E᙭ᑕᑌᔕE ᗰE ᗩᔕ ᗩ ᒪEᗩTᕼEᖇᖴᗩᑕE ᗰᗩIᑎ
---
Oh right im dumb
---
it happens to everyone.
---
Just idiots being idiots. Using a core mechanic of the game is in no way toxic. Either a troll or a person having a bad day. Ignore them if you ask me.
---
I agree. Too much going on in that screen.
---
Since you want to flame people who care about tbagging, what does “priorities” have anything to do with it? 
---
People get mad because it’s the gesture that’s seen as disrespectful. Anybody who played halo or cod knows the tbag is more of a disrespect factor. Nobody tbags because it’s fun. 
---
It’s also incredible that you’re comparing the action of getting mad at a tbag and a real life confrontation. Bad comparison.
---
It's gonna have BUGS.
---
It's bad because looping the killer for five minutes means you can usually escape, getting facecamped is literally sitting there until you die. Yeah they both waste their time, but like you also fucking die without being to do anything about it. It's not a good thing to be facecamped.
---
Hmhm, grabbin' bills.
---
What I want to see is a cinematic paralleled movie about Jane and Adris. Both of them in their overcoming adversity timelines, struggles with their worlds view of them and both ending with each of them being “lost” as they find their way into the fog.
---
Some people suck.
---
But first let me take a selfie
---
Why you all booing/downvoting me, I'm right you know.
---
also a lot of killers who Ive called out for facecamping genuinely dont know how the ranking system works
---
they think facecamping has no drawbacks
---
I think they are thinking about making new moris and selling them as cosmetics.
---
You reckon?
---
This looks to be on console. Was it?
---
I didn’t know about this song. It fits well to the GIF.
---
i see Stranger things, i upvote
---
The music video to footage is just a bunch of photos going by fast
---
Yes we all speak this language, very interesting concept, I would just change one thing: make it Envlish
---
I'd much rather have a guy tap the gen than to fail the skillcheck and then immediately go full "NIGERUNDAYOOOOO" after he tipped the killer to our location. Embarassing or not, if it gets the job done, its way better than failing a skill check.
---
* submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to scam bots.

---
*Loud af micheal myres theme starys playing*
---
Yeah until y'all both are trapped in basement and the person wont take the free hit
---
Pigs is garbage too but nobody talos about it.
---
My friend and I always do. We know it allows us to get gens and such
---
This hitbox right here, officer
---
I was laughing my ass off like a little kid when he kicked the gen, but then it got awkward around 0:45.
---
Me: I can hear GIFs. Teacher: no you can't. Me:
---
the killers dont have to respect the 4%
---
Fredi too op
---
Will there ever be cross progression so can I put my DBD PS4 account on my PC?
---
I need my struggle points.
---
It's way better than any of the original killers' Moris. It's just unfortunate that it looks weird on any survivor with a beatrap on.
---
I feel like a guy in a POW torture scene who spits in his captors face
---
Maybe it wasn’t a dream
---
 Very fitting for current dead hard
---
1. If you run the healing process stops.
---
2. It's called 'Hex: Huntress lullaby' to stop it you need to find a totem that is light on.
---
3. In a chase try looping the killer on pallets that are 'safe' (Next to an object that isn't small) and use windows when to make a some extra distance between the killer and you. You don't need to win chases, when being chase the best thing you can do is consume the most time as possible from the killer while your teammates work on generators.
---
4. Using perks to find items isn't optimal but it won't make you lose games if you make sure to not waste too much time looking for chests.
---
5. No, most of the time you want to be on gens, if you break the hooks around gens you are losing time that could be used to progress on gens and even if the killer comes to that gen you will need to leave the area so if you eventually go down you won't be around that hooks you broke.
---
Now it makes sense as to why a good meme was in facebook
---
I think out of all the DLC survivors Feng and Nea are the easiest outside of Dwight and Claudette. I'm not too sure on how useful Jane's perks are. Adam's perks are usually just a meme. Jeff's perks are pretty interesting and distortion especially can be really good.
---
Its just boring and not that good for a kill that could jave had really cool moris
---
Literally had someone message me “GG I hope you had fun” at rank 1 lol. It’s just luck if you are solo with what type of group you will get.
---
Insert eye twitch gif
---
Do all of the above and name yourself camp=do gens and they still won't lmao
---
You say yourself it's your second game... you're rank 16 and there are 2 people in that lobby at your rank. Is it possible that you didn't pressure gens at all? Chased a god around who wasted your time before you realised? 
---
Nah must be toxic gen rushing survivors ;D
---
Can't swf if you have no friends
---
r/woooosh
---
Everytime it happens I'm like "Yup, now you really got to die."
---
😢
---
Leatherface is 2nd underneath ghostface
---
That‘s like the unholy trifecta of DbD
---
Yeah I'm lonely
---
Noed doesn't relit.
---
Also, if you use 3 normal hex perks + haunted grounds, all 5 totems will be lit.
---
And hex perks are fine the way they are right now. The only problem is totem spawns.
---
Why do you think Legion needs nerfed? All they can do is get a free first hit, and then they becomes a worse Wraith.
---
Usually they're bad. It gaurentees a kill, even if it's "fun" do basically no one.
---
Facts
---
Hey man, Frank is cool. Susie is autist
---
Nah, it's only true if you can finish chases fast or at all. You depip and lose BP if you don't sacrifice as well. So if you can't chase for shit might as well just chill near a hook.
---
By the way facecamping is safe only with little portion of killers. So even this isn't a panacea. Facecamping as a strategy only viable if you're a baby killer. Let little baby killers be.
---
&gt;Start the game without the broken status effect visible so the Killer isnt aware the survivor Is using no mither.
---
Survivor: Starts injured but not broken
---
Killer: Hmmm, I think he has self care
---
And can't they patrol it as if it was a generator?
---
You need three golds and a silver at minimum to pip. 
---
Hard to tell you exactly what you need to do because the emblems and how they are calculated.
---
Because in the chase situation, that's on the killer. If they were being looped hard, they should have peeled off to check their gens or find another survivor. In a face camp situation, the survivor doesn't have the option of *not* being face camped
---
Its mildly annoying, but I am fine with it, survivors will just have to deal with being slugged if I know there is an aggressive flashlight saver in the game though.
---
Probably means level
---
Even Ivory Memento Mori is enough. *LAUGHS IN LEGION*
---
Jake and Meg are also really good too, What's so good about Jeff's perks though?
---
I know deliverance for Adam is really good for getting off a hook right?
---
Are you kidding or...
---
I think they said it a long time ago on the devs stream, not sure where to find it though.
---
I didnt mean as injuried I mean they appear "healthy" in the bottom left  like all other survivors, so the killer cant focus on tunneling that player
---
&gt;That means that there's gotta be a ton of people using Trapper at high ran-oh wait, nobody uses him either.
---
The left hand of the entity would like a word with you.
---
No, 12am is typically makes a new day. So where the update?
---
Distortion counters aura reading perks which killers love. Like bbq.
---
I'm not very toxic, but holy fuck. You're a moron.
---
Mines insidious bubba but I main plague
---
Not on PS4 but my killer has been almost instant on Xbox.
---
Seeing how the totem is in a corner and traps are round, survivors can walk right against the wall on either side and won't trigger the trap. And that's assuming Freddy gets here first.
---
That lame attempt of a insult isn't affecting anyone mommy. Where the update bitch?
---
well it has it's uses
---
No I'm not going to let baby killers "be" because them being is dumb not only to them but for survivors too. You aren't going to pip at all if you get 1 hook all game. If you can't chase for shit, get better at chasing by chasing.
---
Was Xbox affected by the previous matchmaking issues?
---
We could use his infamous mask from the second film. There are a lot of ways to go about it, but I do understand your point.
---
You're an entitled Dipshit 😂
---
What is Dead may never sacrifced
---
She's not that far off from A-Tier. If I had to make a tier list, I'd put Nurse and Spirit into the S-Tier, then Billy and Hag in A, and then it's kinda interesting.
---
So, a few killers *could* arguably be A-Tier. Huntress, new Freddy for example. But they're also kind of really map dependent. Like Huntress is AMAZING on some maps, and then you have maps like Haddonfield with loops that safely dodge smart Hathets, too. So if you're that inconsistent but still potent, I'd say you're B-Tier.
---
But who would go into the B-Tier? Well, in my opinion it'd be Pig, and quite high there, actually. 
---
Pig is better than A LOT of killers in the game because she has a solid way of slowing down gens. Yes, it's RNG. But she has it. Bear traps and a bit of luck slow the game down dramatically. She has built-in Insidious, which can be nice for a stealthier approach, and Ambush allows you to get some hits other m1 killers wouldn't. I think she's quite underrated. She is, regardless of her add-ons, able to do different things somewhat consistently. And that's more than a lot of killers can say.
---
Is she *amazing*? No. But she's far better, conceptually, than, say, Wraith, who has absolutely nothing.
---
I mean certain loops are literally unfair to the killer lol they can never catch you. *Myers house with balanced landing*
---
How are you supposed to outplay being facecamped? Because I can run them for 3 gens and eventually I'm gonna have to go down. After that, what it's my fault they facecamp me? So that then we both get shit for points since all I've been doing is getting chased? How is that at all my fault?
---
You moron, obviously you should be running solidarity, left behind and a broken key. Get it together.
---
u/Skeemo might have. If not, this skin would be nice to see in 4k to see the badges better
---
Looks nice but I just feel like there is too many things on the screen
---
Playing killer will help your survivors skills. 
---
But yeah, if you have 1 or 2 awful teammates anchoring your team theres not much you can do. It can be pretty infuriating.
---
u/Skemooo might have a 4k render of it.
---
it costed you $0.00 to NOT make that title what it is
---
Don't prolong chases and escape. If you can't escape, that's on you. What's that, you can't escape from a bad killer? Well, guess you die.
---
No. Only to baby killers.
---
Boosted swf's. Then they play solo and get stomped because they don't have friends and comms to carry them.
---
It costed you $0.00 to scroll past 🌚
---
I’d want a series of that.
---
Where it always is? Duhhh. Mah bathtub.
---
As a spirit main who loved surprising people i feel bad for you bro :/
---
Okay so your solution is: don't get caught. You're saying every time someone gets facecamped, that's their fault? Because they got caught? If you can run a killer for every gen, and get caught at the end, clearly you need to just git gud.  And it's not the killers fault for being bad? Why are you victim blaming here, the survivor shouldnt get punished for simply getting caught, that's why there're multiple hooks.
---
Slightly upset you used the reboot style instead of OG
---
I’ve been thinking about that🤔 I mean why do a cosplay if you’re not ready to commit, right? I was thinking of going back in time and rub my face against someone who had the plague. Do you think that sounds like a solid idea? Need feedback. Okthx♥️
---
Thank you!🖤
---
Thank you so much! :D♥️
---
It does kind of force you to be altruistic to use it though, plus it can be hard to find injured teammates unless you run empathy and then empathy becomes useless once you activate aftercare
---
Don't hate yourself, you are friend!
---
I laugh so hard every time I see this face and I never know what to reply back with lmao!
---
[deleted]
---
You have a 4% base chance of saving yourself off of hook.
---
You know that the day encompasses an entire 24 hour period, right? And they just said that the update is “today”, not at any specific time? They’re entitled to release the update at 11:59 PM if they want to.
---
Have never thought of that. Nice suggestion
---
The one I answered was saying it gets better once you get out of green and purple ranks. I was just saying it doesn't get better. You still see those killers very often in red ranks.
---
Buying Jane can never be a mistake. An *actual* thick girl in a game? Embrace her and her loud ass grunts. She is also one of the quieter ones when not injured so there's that.
---
[\*Mr blue sky starts playing\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVIxDpvjJr0)
---
I'll try this build out, sounds like a lot of fun!
---
You see. Som survs think that killers hook them so they can be rescued. When they're actually hooked to be killed.
---
Being caught brings the risk of getting killed. If bad killer manages to catch you, he have very limited choice on how to ensure a kill. You have to play around things like this. You can try to bet on him being a nice person and not want to kill you, of course, but that's also on you.
---
Basically yes, if you see that your game goes too well, killer can be mean to you in the end.
---
Call me old fashioned, but I would have talked so much shit in that post game.
---
Re-arranging the frames could actually make it look like he's pressing the button over and over.
---
Killer: Bluffs a mori
---
Survivor: DC's
---
Killer: *surprised pikachu*
---
What I want
---
Aren't macros punishable by ban?
---
THERE IS NO WAY TO PLAY AROUND FACECAMPING. DONT GET CAUGHT IS NOT A SOLUTION. Stop trying to act like facecamping is a good thing to do, its something unhealthy for the killer and survivor and should always be discouraged. You don't get points, you don't get pips, and you just get an asshole for a killer.
---
That's how you see it. Killer just wants a kill. Even a bad one. Especially a bad one. He doesn't actually want you to sit there for 5 mins, that's you do yourself. Killer doesn't try to be a dick, he wants you dead.
---
Am I the only one who hates seeing my favorite survivor get mori'd? :(
---
Uhm you just can’t just say that and not attach a reference photo my good sir I WANNA SEE YOU! OWO
---
Do some research and look up what time updates usally come out for dbd
---
Why does the killer want you dead? Because he either a) thinks this is how you do it, hence my comment about them being ignorant and stupid or 2) wants to ruin your time specifically because he doesn't like you. If he gave a shit about winning, he wouldn't facecamp, but instead he's either a dumbass or wants to ruin your time. Just getting a kill doesnt mean shit for anyone, not even the killer, and if you think that's wrong you're delusional. 1 kill doesnt mean you win.
---
I miss being able to struggle for the full amount of time as the last survivor hooked.
---
Not sure but the Dwight was rank 2
---
what were you doing for the other 2 hour and 58 minutes?
---
I'd argue that it really gets better in higher ranks. But it's just it, it "gets better". It won't get perfect.
---
Would infect her asap
---
No it MeKhAL
---
You see, I play dbd before bed every night but the only issues I have if it’s a Huntress on my last game and I can’t get her lullaby out of my head all stinking night!!!  Literally, I can hear it after I shut my tv off and laying in bed in the dark.
---
Why would he waste 10 hours in the first place?
---
Shoot, I meant add-ons! Like Franks Mix tape just doesn't do anything now.
---
It's much harder at the beginning of the game when your parkour skills suck. Once they get levelled up a bit I found the game becoming much easier.
---
2 guys behind the hay bale and 1 guy behind a rock while I scream to myself "GO DO GENS!"
---
"WHY AREN'T THESE PEOPLE AWAKE AT DARK O'CLOCK FOR MY NEEDS"

---
This physically hurts!
---
Great suggestions, especially getting rid of must-have perks like Hex: Ruin. Love the suggestion of survivors having to find spare parts too. Fixing gens needs more interactivity. I like all of your suggestions basically &lt;3
---
Legion is more fun to play as but be prepared for toxic survivors
---
What I would love is a removal of ruin and just a general slowdown on generators to balance it. Things like ruin and noed work great against gen rushers and swf for a little bit but tend to make the game unfun for normal players.
---
Imo the fact that nearly every killer runs either of both of those perks shows the balance in the game is a bit off. Some killers need them just to be able to compete a little bit.
---
My idea would be make ruin affect healing skill checks and self heal etc. Make nooed trigger at 3 gens left and have it add 1 stage to hook progression or speed up hook progression.
---
Plague to have more variety of killer matches
---
People who dont run kindred are usually a SWF only player so they get the effect of the perk free anyway really
---
Somebody needs to add the Mr. Bluesky audio over this, I can hear it now lmao

Your argument doesn't have much steam, to be honest.  I'm a baby killer.  I've only played something like 4-5 rounds as the killer (Trapper), and I find myself able to 4k on a whim if I so choose.  In fact the other day I just went around hitting people, leaving them crawling, while I patrolled gens.  Their teammates would get them up eventually, and I'd find them again at some point, and slug em.  My intention in the end was to let all 4 of them escape after I tortured them a bit.  I accidentally hooked two of them 3 times (forgotten how many times it had been) and they died.  The other two got downed like 5 times, and died from bleeding out.  I was searching for the hatch for the last person to carry them over to it, but they died on the ground.  Anyhow, I am baby killer, and I still find it incredibly easy (at lower skill ranks that is) to 4k without trying very hard, and without EVER face camping.  Face camping results in gen rushing, always.
---
The quietest ia Ace I believe or it's Feng I don't remember what someone told me.
---
That or it's Ace being the easiest to be spot by the killer.
---
It isn't your fault.  The person you're arguing with is an asshat who can't admit when he's wrong.  Best to leave it be so he can annoy someone else with his bullshit.
---
Happy to help ;)
---
very cool.can you do it with  transparent background?
---
11/10 would laugh again
---
It’s pretty easy to get killers and survivors to level 15 too, and the killers you start with are decent so he could get  bp from them and pour it into the pig
---
I take it you aren't very intelligent.  Just from what I gather in this thread, anyhow.
---
I got to show up like the next day I played after buying it a from the shrine two weeks ago. Only my David and Jane though. And I bought Jane pretty recently too and it showed up early in her web. Don't think I seen it in my Dwight and Claudette web. 
---
Haven't invested in the other survivors yet.
---
HERE ARE MY RULES... U NO FOLLOW RULES... BAD U.
---
If this annoys you so much to bring a Mori just bring one every game. You're playing as the Terminator being annoyed by ants who can't hurt you. 
---
Grow up :P
---
The updates almost never come out until sometime between 11 and 2pm EST
---
I think OP is the killer and that's the joke.
---
I'd watch that. They could get a contract with Netflix or even Shudder.
---
Not even in a swf group most of the time. I kinda yell at my mates if they do totems and not join me on a fuckin' gen. Especially if they do it while the killer has a sh\*t amound of map pressure. "ruin is still up, everyone on death hook, still 3 gens to do, better do a fuckin' dull" GRRRAAAH
---
Dude I wouldn't mind a nightmare about DBD
---
Ace is the most quiet. Jeff is the loudest overall but Bill's coughs get up there too.
---
Very inaccurate, they will now proceed to talk shit about no dedicated servers, hitboxes, lags and op killers.
---
Hmm I thought 3.0 patch made it so it only effected pallet stuns and didn't effect any stun from an ability
---
I used to ALWAYS hear it. It got mildly creept after awhile
---
Will the game have crossplay?
---
I always wanted to play with some friends of xbox and ps4, even those who wants the nintendo switch version.
---
Right after escaping a hook******
---
I know! I was so surprised!
---
At least 10
---
Don't let them get at you like that. This game is definitely worth the time and money. I've been playing since launch back in 2016. It can definitely get frustrating and players sometimes will be shitheads towards you. But this is a unique game with a large player base and continuous improvement. It's very fun.
---
Or if they do cleanse to avoid being broken and super loud, they can force you to get Corrupt Purge by using the last cleansing well when you have no idea where they are, and wait it out.
---
It's not like Myer's who gets to pop his limited ability whenever he wants, and the Plague running around from well to well to keep Corrupt Purge up is free time on generators between charges.
---
I though it was funny. Glad it could make someone else laugh. 😊
---
&gt; the killer follows you the whole game without finding someone else
---
Like they said, 
---
&gt;when you get out of the bad ranks and into green or purple
---
R13 is the killer
---
Leatherface,pig,huntress, freddy,
---
That is fair it just annoying if it's something like people throwing themselves at you to use it.
---
Yeah, freddy isn't annoying enough to bitch about it on here.
---
rank 10*****
---
Is it just me or are the bots getting smarter.
---
A lot of these are just too op but aren’t bad ideas, for example if you got rid of the exposed part of your trapper idea and added a time limit for the movement speed I think it would be pretty balanced
---
I shouldn’t have even queued with the r10.
---
yeah but matchmaking is really shit atm. you take what you can get ig
---
Did you see a little red icon to the lower left of your perks? I have seen the progress bar change color when effected by a perk that might be it.
---
Typically the updates will drop around 11AM-2PM EST. I also wish they could drop updates at 12 AM but it pretty much is easier for them to drop at 11-2. Don’t worry its coming!!
---
I wish for Pink Freddy immediately after seeing this. He's *FABULOUS*!
---
EAC said they wont ban anyone if they change something that dont give any type of competitive advantage.
---
If EAC bans you BHVR wont do anything to remove the ban (EAC wont ban you).
---
If BHVR bans you EAC wont do anything to remove the ban (BHVR wont ban you).
---
I mean, I am not saying this is representative of a majority, just that there is a genuinely nutty, loud minority of survivors.
---
The trapper one sounds like the Warlords new execution in For Honor.
---
whoops.  I didn’t see “via a hatch close”😂
---
If Spine Chill activates while you are being healed it definitely lights up. I dont know if your teammate is actually getting the 6% buff tho. It might be a visual bug. Theres an icon for action speed increase that appears of the progress bar, thats what determines if your actually getting the speed buff. 
---
Needs to be tested in SWF or KYF.
---
holy shit chill the fuck out
---
Your example is clearly not tunneling.  
---
I don't think tunneling should even be a complaint.  Going after an injured survivor that has already been hooked is just the optimal choice in most situations.  
---
Ignoring the rest of their team to solo target someone is shitty, but simply chasing someone that is already injured and in your view just makes sense unless you suspect borrowed time.
---
I realize most survivors want you to be the good guy and hook each of them three times a piece non-consecutively, but get real.
---
dont... go to red ranks
---
They always need the insta heal and purple flashlight, don’t they?
---
absolutely not. now i'll bitch about the absolute shit hit boxes fight me
---
Cant you just download it from [here?](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=17431)
---
This happens when no one else is available to play at your own rank.
---
Those are some nice downvotes, I think this man has yee'd his last haw.
---
it still shocks me that ppl play this game on xbox and idek why
---
Welcome to red ranks. 
---
Not that flashlights are a huge problem but the insta heals definitely aren’t fun to play against.
---
How so?
---
Lmao he has like 10
---
it’s not about the text even. it’s literally the same thing as in english, it’s about the icons
---
Dont buy any of them
---
The wait times for killer feel dramatically better, I’ll find a match within 30 seconds to a minute most of the time
---
It's from running
---
Even if it didn't block the window, in most cases, it's not a smart idea. It's pretty rare that you vault the same window enough to block it before getting hit. If you get hit, just run somewhere else and repeat. The only time a slow vault is good is when you're trying to trick the killer. Otherwise, you lose too much distance.
---
A man of culture I see.
---
damn that's pretty cool that they're allowing a character from a different game in here then. dope.
---
don’t activate your shock immediately, use it to find survivors when you need to
---
You don't get into a situation where you can use it too often, yes. 
---
But it is good in a situation where you get slugged for DS by the killer, so it is perfect for this situation.
---
Lesion seems to be in a different game so I guess you should get leatherface. On a more serious note, if legion seems more fun to you, a perk can appear on the shrine, a character won't.
---
He said /s
---
Me at the hatch with key in endgame, after killer gets overzealous and does this while I'm in dying state and then closes hatch triggering adrenaline.
---
I might be a clown main but you are the entire circus my dude
---
Why? What should I do with the shards? Shove them up my ass?
---
Yes there have been times ive used and and istead of dash i just fucking run like nothing happened and i still get the exhausted so it knows ive used it but it doesnt let me dash
---
Your solution is not working.
---
Someone needs to animate this shit
---
Leatherface for BBQ. It's that good. Legion also doesn't go through the game fast because you spend a lot of time applying deep wounds to survivors to *slow* the game down.
---
change it for like 5% every 5 seconds instead. 1 percent would only start to affect after like 10-20% that’s already almost 3 minutes of chance hahaha
---
I’d say DS lasts too long currently it’s to counter tunneling but even if I chase other survivors and happen to stumble into the one I unhooked why should I get DSed when I wasn’t tunneling
---
&gt; No? It's just super boring to run around in circles for ever, it's just not fun, it's tedious and repetitive, with little to no satisfaction when you actually hit them. 
---
This is all subjective, but I can tell you from experience that's how I feel with Nurse matches because they never go well unless it's a baby Nurse in training. 
---
Skill cap is irrelevant. I don't care how much time you spend learning to use a killer. If they're OP they're OP and learning curve has nothing to do with it.
---
I'm not against buffing other killers. Obviously they gave Fred a mega-buff with a rework and it worked out for everyone. My contention is they should do the same with Nurse to bring her back down to the pack so we're not forced to see Ebony Mori nurses end matches in a few minutes so frequently in red ranks. That's an indication she's horribly imbalanced.
---
Look, I understand bringing a stealth build works best against Nurse. But that requires a different build than what is meta at red ranks and leaves survivors liable to getting stomped by any other killer.
---
Brought DS so you don't get tunneled? Too bad, Nurse is gonna blink back immediately and slug you.
---
Brought Adrenaline for an endgame boost? Not getting there against Nurse anyway.
---
Brought an exhaustion perk so you can extend chases? Too bad, Nurse can blink and be up your ass in 2 seconds.
---
In short, I don't think one characters should require their own specific build to give a chance at counterplay.
---
Love it.
---
Bubba 
---
He’s licensed so you need real world money. 
---
Legion can be earned with iridescent shards.
---
Knock out good for slug builds.
---
Bbq = meta/ free bloodpoints
---
Franklins demis = no insta heal, blinding at pallets or hatch escapes for you. 
---
Also the devs plan on buffing him in the future so there’s that.
---
Legion: 
---
Discordance: pretty good 
---
Mad grit: to situational 
---
Iron Maiden: best on doc or huntress or when combined with bbq.
---
Well that's not my fault
---
Just imagine the killer slugged for a lil bit
---
I would get leatherface personally. His perks are just so good. And sure Legion is “fast” but it doesn’t really amount to much. I like playing fast killers too and if I’m feeling speedy I just go with Spirit, Billy, or Myers (I know he’s not too fast but tier 3 lunge sniping is fun). You may feel differently if you just like smacking people, because Legion is good at that.
---
Its a good dilemma because you are right BBQ is a BIG DEAL. Its not so much that its an OP perk, but the 100% BP gain is a big deal in the long run. But at the same time, legion is both better and more fun and generally generates more BP than leatherface.
---
But Leatherface is a liscenced killer, while Legion can be obtained whitout purchasing him. So maybe get both (LF first due to BBQ)
---
If you want to, sure you can but you can buy cosmetics or get the next chapter basically for free if it isnt licensed
---
Feel bad for the killer for having to deal with metagaming by SWF (advantageously using voice chat to communicate information that the actual survivors wouldn't know about in-game). For example, at 0:36, there is no way Meg can know someone is at the exit gate.
---
I do hope that at some point in the game's life there will be a bonus for the killer if they play against SWF as it makes the game very unfair.
---
And here we were talking about 5 minute chases that end with nobody being hit or hooked.
---
for some reason when i installed other windows version, it worked for me, try that
---
Try [this link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) which would give you a file named dxwebsetup.exe then.
---
They aren't broken
---
That shocks you?
---
myers being4/10 Hahahahahahahhaha
---
earlier today, i was running lithe and got chainsawed through a window after my exhaustion already went off. 
---
but sure. they're perf.
---
It's so over the top. They might as well be using walkie-talkies.
---
That sounds like connection issues
---
You forgot about miss piggy:
---
Not strong but still gets nerfed at every chance.
---
Rainbow maps track it by default. Theres also a green add on that you can equip to Green maps to track it once it spawns. 
---
It will usually spawn near some form of environmental architecture. It can spawn on hills, in the middle of the map or near rocks/trees etc. It rarely spawns completey in the open by itself.
---
When the hatch is *OPEN* it will make a 'whoosing' sound like air being sucked through a window/tunnel. The hatch will only open if there is one survivor left, but it will spawn closed before then, if the right parameters are met.
---
fuckin shocks me, man. thought y'all were the land of cod and nba
---
Back in the day when dbd used to be scary..
---
I actually prefer to use lightborn. Watching them waste their flashlight juice and also waste time trying to blind me often affords me a kill
---
Or maybe you could just cleanse totems anyway?
---
Not all of these perks needed a big buff, I was thinking a smaller one for some of these. Like Autodidact, make it so we can use medkit skillchecks to count towards Autodidact. For PWF, I was thinking of adding another token, but making the movement speed go down to 3 or 4%. For IAE, I was just wanting a shorter cool down.
---
Also, I didn't mention Tapp's perks, because they are good enough. Like Stake Out, no need to change it, because it lets you store up to 4 tokens and works on every type of skillcheck. Tenacity is fine where it is. Detective's Hunch is fine as well, because you only use it when you have a map. Plus it spans out by 64 meters, so imagine doing a gen in the middle of the game map, bam, you have the whole map tracked.
---
COD has gone worse and NBA games are terrible
---
It says that i have for some reason the newer or equivalent version of DirectX already isntalled, that is a funcking lie because the game is still not working.
---
Epic.
---
The Entity starts counting down the 3 vaults as long as you are in a chase no matter what kind of vault you do. Anyway, it can be smart if the killer lost sight of you and you can turn around multiple structures.
---
hag is god tier tho
---
I play better than average due to hundreds of hours I wasted in this game, so I am at rank 7, what is wrong here? Do you think it’s either R1 or R20?
---
i find it more toxic at lower ranks
---
Detective hunch? But I agree. They should be another perk to find totems.
---
don't get mad at me for being naïve
---
Got reported for camping yesterday when three of the survivors would try to rescue as soon as I put one on the hook and then body block, sometimes before I’d even turn to leave. The other survivor got two gens done and I felt sorry for the poor sod as I mori’d him.
---
Oh no I’m not getting mad, just strange how you chose those games tbh. A decade ago COD for sure, but nowadays it’s just bad.
---
The update comes out 11am EST
---
STOP GETTING MAD
---
Or survivors could just leave the match when their whole(or remaining) team is safe rather than all camping and Tbagging
---
Ok...
---
O yeah but then all 4 survivors getting instantly healed up a health state and sprinting away, ruining all your chances of getting a kill do to adrenaline after the last gen is done is totally fine
---
Hmm, see my edit; do you have Dxdiag still on the machine? (Just hit the windows key on your keyboard and type dxdiag in the search bar).
---
Do you have a system restore point from before he worked on the machine, what was he trying to do?
---
Really this is the kind of thing that is easier to handle over something like Discord with chat/easy screenshots, you can add me at Discothèque Juliet#0393 if you want.
---
i downvoted this bc you have a pic of these two and not prue and grams from charmed
---
You actually linked him to a presentation, Felting, not installation media.
---
i love my fermi li
---
One moment.
---
I think as long as killer have their noed and survivors their adrenaline its okay one counters the other but when you want to change noed change adrenaline aswell. Isn't like its super goof and everyone is running it or anything
---
There is, its called small game.
---
Still miss First Person moris tho. I enjoyed how it was different depending on if you were the killer or survivor.
---
spirit&gt;billy imo. of course billy has the instadowns but the mind games are insane
---
if your argument is time management then you should know self care isn't the best. It's not a bad perk, but it definitely is not a must have perk and super high tier either. Self caring once or twice isn't bad, it becomes apparent how bad it is if you use it every chance you get and multiple survivors are spending time self caring.
---
While doing separate gens is always the better option, NEVER being together isn't a good idea either, spending time delaying hooks or saving each other is important too you know to delay the killer even more or just outright deny hooks.
---
If a survivor is throwing themselves at you, ask yourself why. Are you chasing their injured teammate who is on death hook? If not, chances are they’re trying to bait you into their DS. Same way that a survivor who tea bags and clicks their flashlight at you is trying to bait you into chasing them. It doesn’t mean you have to take their bait. 
---
There are enough ways to play around DS, rather than getting annoyed at the perk use it as a learning opportunity and change up your tactics.
---
chaotic evil
---
That would explain the word presentation
---
This is pretty sick
---
I was reported for placing Hag traps across the map, near hooked survivors and near my totems... what *am* I supposed to do then?
---
I haven't been in red ranks (only been to purple) but I'd imagine the pip conditions are the same, regardless of rank. You just have to do enough each game to pip. 
---
Rule of thumb is to do a gen, save someone from the hook and heal, run the killer around a bit and that'll pretty much guarantee at least a pip. For killer, I'd you'd need to kill at least 2-3 people while doing killer things. 
---
I've had 4ks and not pipped because I didn't score enough in the other categories.
---
i literally started using Spine Chill in most of my builds because of the incredible amount of Spirit players i´ve been facing. Fortunately i´ve not vs nurses so much lately.
---
The perks REALLY need work
---
No, because 1 out of 5 has noed. You can't lose all that time only to prevent it, when in most cases it isn't used by the killer. But that 1 match is really annoying, and very often the killer gets free kills thanks to that stupid perk. In my reworked noed you would equally lost time, but you would be sure that the time you lost has been useful. Nobody cleanses totems at red ranks, because good players know that is a big waste of time, especially if you are not sure that the killer has noed.
---
no, now I have to level up an entirely new survivor just to finish getting perks I already have on other survivors.
---
give 5 traps on default. instead of 75 seconds maybe 100? 75 is WAY to little. i don’t get the part about the locker, can you elaborate?
---
I bet they T bagged and talked shit too
---
give 5 traps on default, and decrease timer.
---
NOED is fine. 
---
IF anything, they could do a small QOL change to Small Game and add a totem counter to it but even this is open for debate. 
---
Personally I think it would be a decent change because survivors would be dropping a possible meta perk in exchange of better totem tracking. They could also add faster cleansing in addition to the totem counter.
---
NOED needs to be strong. If it werent strong, there would be no reason to cleanse dull totems. The threat of it is more important then its actual stenght. 
---
Yes its annoying. Yes it can reward playing poorly. But it also makes end game builds possible.
---
My bad, thought it was the same link I used when I had to install something like this
---
It’s never going to happen, as a programmer I would know
---
Sometimes you aren't tunneling but the survivor will purposely get downed by you to use his DS. The counter is simply to slug that survivor and continue your initial chase.
---
Grabbin Bills!
---
Yeah, after insulting she didn't turn back as well. I mean I would have accepted an apology and even our killer said it was too much. Later I found out she was 17 and I decided to blame puberty and to put her on my bitch list. The nerve of some people 🤷
---
I always played this game consistently for the past two years as a survivor without really knowing how huge and how seriously people play this game - so wild how big this community is
---
Thanks, that is what I'm thinking as well
---
*happy Pig noises*
---
Now I haven't played in awhile, but one of my proud moments was getting rank 1 with wraith
---
True I just think a full minute of safety is a bit much, 45 seconds or make it so if you hit/down another survivor their DS ends
---
swf
---
Yes, i have Dxdiag, but what do i do with it?
---
Right. Nobody cleanses totems. And that's literally the only thing y'all can complain about for noed. "I don't want to have to do a secondary objective so change this perk!"
---
I once had a game where I mori’d all 4 ppl with devour hope, got called a camping c*nt at the end...how even???
---
But first, let me take a selfie!
---
He said the N-Word get him!
---
Dude trust me i have over 1000 hours on dbd and i can tell you that noed is way more annoying than adrenaline. If you don't believe me go ask good players, and they will give my same answer.
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that caused some fences to be missing in front or in the back of various houses in the Lampkin Lane map. 
---
Its bad enough as is ffs
---
thank you &lt;3
---
I don't think you know how the killer point system works. Chasing a survivor still gets you points regardless of whether its successful or not.
---
Yeah exactly, is that not obvious?
---
Did you escape?
---
Sorry. you're right.
---
Sigh.  Another few weeks at least until we see that fixed now.
---
Gates are open, then it's just a free for all and all is allowed
---
But you're rank 10. It's not that much of a difference.
---
look through new here. i haven’t experienced much since i’m rank 6. but yeah, a lot of people here were complaining and to be honest they’ve got a point
---
That's related not to Dead Hard itself but to how lag compensation works. Killer have hit you on his side, but your side still doesn't know about it because of the lag. Then you try to deadhard, but the server calculates all the odds and decides that you wasn't able to use it in time.
---
That's why you can't really use it on the tip by reaction. But it's still good to cut the distance to the window/pallet or against the Nurse.
---
Load it, let it finish checking your system (it'll be a green bar filling to completion, probably in the lower left).
---
Which version of DirectX does it say you have under system information? Save all the information to a file on your desktop, you might need it later.
---
Check System32 and make sure you still have files labeled d3dx# (9 through 11 usually), but don't do anything.
---
If it's still not working, try a third party uninstaller ([https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/96/](https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/96/)) after scanning it, use CCleaner to clear registry errors, install using the link from earlier.
---
Make a restore point before doing all of the above.
---
If the above doesn't work, restore backwards, get in touch with Microsoft support.
---
Poor Wraith D'Ced after chasing me for 9 minutes
---
no dead hard fix on consoles :/
---
I believe there is already plans to fix it. Currently let's say 3 rank 1s queue with a rank 20 who is host, they will likely face rank 15 or something, which is totally unfair. Instead i think they plan to average it.
---
Dc became so famous they turned it to a perk
---
He's doing his best ;^;
---
Survivor's Rulebook for killers rule #245: Killer's can't make rules for survivors.
---
A difference in skill of the players or?
---
So does hooking a person and sacrificing him.
---
I see now got higher rank everyone just says I’m camping them even when I’m doing quite the opposite
---
Rank.
---
No it's more like "I want to have an advice, and i want to have the possibility to choose and to counter it, so slightly nerf it". But seems like rank 20 are crying here. If you want the detailed explanation go check other comments, i explained more accurately my idea there.
---
stay at purple/green

I can't even think of a reply thats just genius hahaha

Matchmaking is fucked. I had one like this recently, except I was rank 6 and my teammates were all literally rank 19/20 with a rank 10 killer.

It would've been amazing if they missed you.
---
Wow good job! You hook one person all game when you could have got more points doing other things! Amazing!

It didnt happen

Normaly if you're in purple ranks, youre MOST likely to go against a green rank, not a new player

Unnecessary "NOED is strong and i dont wanna cleanse totems, so change it" Post #9846.

Devourer of pallets LMAO

Hex: Regress - It's just Ruin with more effort involved
---
Scream of Anger - You'll either get completely BS hits with no effort, or it'll be worthless
---
Illusions - Survivors will remember generator locations, and having your aura revealed for 3 seconds isn't much
---
Hex Cleanse: It's just not well made. It's either worthless if the killer doesn't have a hex, or it makes a killer's perk choice, a hex, which is already a risky choice, worthless.

Yeah but the images you used.

I gave you my thoughts in another comment
---
Circle
---
Traps are a timer waster first, killing tool second and they are good as is.
---
Except after chasing one person for 5 minutes you can chase other only to the exit gate.
---
idk man, matchmaking is fucked and he wasnt very hard to go against. he got so stressed he DCed
---
&gt;How can you turn off toxic behaviour? 
---
You can usually just disable chat, such as in Overwatch it's a simple click, and in some source games there's technical bullshittery you can do to get rid of it.
---
If I can't SEE it then it can't fuck me.
---
This is how I counter killers "tunneling", I looked up YouTube Videos on how to Juke / Loop properly, then in game  I execute what I had studied. Sometimes it doesn't work and that's OK, but I like to improve my game-play by hard work instead of telling the Devs to alter the coding and making the game work around what is more convenient for my play style. I think DS is perfectly fine. People just need to learn how to play better aside from complaining their way to obtain more Blood-points. You can Tunnel all you want, but its not going to matter if you are going against a juke master.
---
Ok I'm gonna just reply you with 1 question. What percentage of your killer match do you win?
---
You can already decide if you're going to let the killer have it or not.... That's already a thing. Cleanse totems. It's not hard. It takes 10 seconds, and gives you 1,000 points. The nerf you're proposing takes away the best part of NOED. The surprise factor. Just because the totems turn black doesn't mean the survivors will waste time cleansing them, it just means they'll leave quicker once the last gen pops. If you don't want to get hit with NOED, then cleanse totems (50 seconds total to cleanse all 5, barely any time lost) or leave immediately. It's fine how it is, devs have said it's fine how it is, no matter how much whiny survivor mains cry about it, it's not going to change.
---
Hoes Mad 😂😂😂😂😂
---
Coven is the best witch thing in the world. Charmed can’t compete
---
They definitely need to change it in a way that matchmaking works off of the highest ranked group member.
---
What percentage of your killer games do you win?
---
Hes not wrong
---
mostly from discord, do you want them or something?
---
Well, the screenshot shows mid-match, it‘s not over.
---
Actually, I don't think any of these players are new. I think they are just mediocre at the game and/or play casually. The rank difference between you and them is hardly a difference. Really.
---
You mean blessed?
---
who tf is this heathen 
---
ashes to ashes, ho
---
What exactly are people complaining about SWF?
---
Unnecessary "I'm rank 20 i wanna get free kills with noed" comment
---
Just a pet peeve I have, had to express it. Good idea with the totems though I like the idea of knowing NOED is inbound and you can decide to cleanse or run.
---
MLGA is a thing
---
Id lick the Huntress' asshole.
---
I agree for somethings but when it comes to useless perks we are in a certain meta tbh. There are so many perks useless. All perks besides few are situational and at times will be strong vs a character and at times won’t.
---
that a rank 20, should not face 3 fucking rank 1s
---
Huh, so it wouldnt be such a problem like so many players make it out to be. To be a rank 10 killer and to versus a rank 4.
---
First of all if you're chasing a survivor for 5 minutes then its your own fault that you lose. Second of all facecamping gets you a small amount of points in one category. Chasing, breaking palletes/gens, finding survivors literally gets you points in the other three categories.
---
If you wanna facecamp because you cant get kills as killer and it hurts your ego than fine, you do that.
---
How about console?
---
I think that they should just reduce the DS strike period of activation to 20/25/30 seconds respectively.
---
Ok, thought it was coming with Freddy. Thanks!
---
I win about 80% of my games without the need of a crutch perk like noed or adrenaline. But it also kinda depends on the daytime
---
A heathen with taste
---
Couldn't agree more. You went against someone who was clearly not playing his best and rage quit. How in your mind does that equate to broken matchmaking? You could easily play against him or some other 14 and loose.
---
Yes. That's killers fault that he wasted his time on fruitless chase. It clearly says that you're bad killer. Breaking pallets is included in the chase (good surv will ensure that killer have to break the pallet before moving on). We talk exactly bad killers and why they chose to facecamp. And answer is they conclude that they not gonna scrap any more points from the game, unless they'll secure at least a kill. At this point your saying "you get more points from other things" becomes not useful since killer thinks that there nothing else left to do.
---
Again, you're trying for some reason explain me, that what killer doing is wrong, when I'm trying to explain, "why" they do it. As a surv, you shouldn't think, what killer "should do". To play around things, you need to think, what killer might do and why. It's also less frustrating to face some behaviors when you understand, why they occur. Otherwise it's complaining about "killer doesn't do what I think he should do!".
---
But there IS a way to counter it... It's there... That exists already... What you want is a giant warning sign. You say "minutes" but it takes 10 seconds to cleanse a totem. That's less than 1 minute, split between 4 people. If everyone cleansed totems when they saw them, NOED would never proc.
---
Still waiting for swimsuits for Kate and Feng :'(
---
Ahahah killers like you can only talk about rank 1 and 4 insta heal. Have you ever played at low rank? I don't have time every month to play so sometimes when I come back to the game I'm like rank 18/17 and untill rank 10 you get a 75% of match that really last something like 5 minutes. Can you stop crying for a moment and think about what a game developer can do? He can't balance a game around only rank 1 players and he can't balance a game like if in every single match there are 4 insta heal. If you want to talk about a game with 4 insta-heal you have to compare it to a 5 blink nurse, an insta-down huntress or an insta-chainsaw billy all with ebony Mori. Have you ever played against a 5 blink nurse with ebony Mori? As I already said i play both sides and I get red rank with killer when I have time, sometimes I get easy match and sometimes I get hard match, it depends on the offerings, add-ons, map, build etc. Have you ever lost a game on rotten fields with billy? Like with a chainsaw sprint you can check almost every gen. Watch out I'm not complaining about anything, I'm just saying if you want to compare an optimal game for survivors like you said with all top tier perks, 4 insta-heal etc you have to compare with an optimal game for killer like 5 blink nurse with ebony Mori. And as I said before if you can get at least 2 kills with a 5 blink nurse ebony Mori, you should change game. Anyways I will stop answering there because apparently the only think you can agree about is "survivor op please nerf". Peace!

I CANNOT UPVOTE THIS HARD ENOUGH
---
I literally did 4 gens yesterday and never saw the killer off of sheer luck, I wasn't even being stealthy.
---
The guy who was looping him the whole time got more points than me
---
First perk makes you unable to heal ever, second perk lets you heal yourself (which would be impossible), each addon allows you to instantly heal someone, but destroys the medkit, so only one would be used. 
---
Basically, the build is completely useless, and that's the joke.
---
Looking at this gave me anxiety.
---
It’s a handicap I give myself because if I ran the belt and had three hatchets I’d hate that as a survivor, so if I ever use it, I just use the head and nothing else, plus it helps me get better at aiming with it too since I have to make sure I can make the throw.
---
It’s helped me judge throwing distance and figure out the juking and fake outs survivors do. Now if I have the purple head and belt, it’s free game but, I usually let the last survivor live anyways or pick them up and take them to the hatch.
---
Probably the best first person zombie shooter. You can play the campaign solo or in coop
---
Can you please explain to me how red ranks are any different from any other rank please?
---
q times are fine.
---
They just were so terribly long cause everyone played Freddy
---
They're... LEARNING!
---
Freddy has more than one trap, so he can make it very difficult to try to edge past them.
---
Indeed i never said to not cleanse totems, but to have an advice for noed (281, the times i said that in the comments). And at rank 1 if the killer isn't noob you dont have time to cleanse totems, and that's a fact. If you are that surv who goes around cleansing all totems, i fell sorry for your team
---
/r/perkbydaylight
---
No missing skill check fix and no ded hard fix. Good job.
---
Then Freddy can slap them and put them to sleep.
---
That one literally says in the title that they weren’t SWF.
---
Are they not the result of a colourblind mode? I might be wrong but some games give those options for people who have limited vision of certain colours
---
*Insert Delilah here*
---
this helps a bunch thank you so much!! :)
---
Okay but the first picture should be leatherface's next cosmetic.
---
I got super pissed at a random survivor who literally crossed my path whike i was looping a Ghost Face hard through the jungle gym. I had to deviate my loop to avoid running in to him and that opened me up long enough to get hit and then again because I couldn't get my gap back. 
---
I have no idea if he thought he was doing me a favor and trying to "take the killer" from me. While waiting to be unhooked I sent him a VERY angry but clean message how you NEVER do that. 
---
He then blamed me for getting him down because my message popped up. SMH
---
BuT aT rEd RaNkS tHeReS nO tImE tO cLeAnSe ToTeMz!
---
Wait we have no dedicated servers? In all honesty I just play the game...
---
"Avoid getting hit to increase your chances of escaping"
---
&gt;Are they out or are they still WIP?
---
They are on schedule, as showed on the 3rd year anniversary.
---
Due to noed basically never maybe 10-30 times in my entire time playing and adrenaline about 50 times
---
If we break this down. You need 13-15 points to pip in red ranks. So you'd need: 
---
Three red emblems and a bronze/silver/gold
---
OR two red and two gold
---
OR two red, a gold and a silver
---
That leaves a little wiggle room for your performance as survivor.
---
But for killer. Yeah, you'd need to kill all survivors before they complete more than 3 gens. Killers have it much tougher than survivors with the emblem system, it seems.
---
Right. When you see a killer using mass slugging you clearly can tell it's a baby killer (especially by the fact that he's able to hit twice more then one survivor). I usually tell "it's a baby killer" when killer plays inefficiently and does stupid things while also a low rank.
---
Being separate is probably the most important aspect to beating a killer and self care accentuates that. 
---
It's indisputably one of the best team perks in the game.
---
I disagree. As you said they may be useful at times others not so much. Like balanced landing. It’s really good at times but other times hardcore fails.
---
The problem is that nobody cleanses, because it's a waste of time if you are unsure if the killer has or hasn't noed. Majority of survs don't cleanse, and they are right, you can't lose time like this at rank 1. If you think that's wrong then sorry, 95% of red rank survs are playing bad. If people cleansed your idea would have been right, but it doesn't fit the reality.
---
No, no, is definitively what /u/SirBaronVonBoozle posted it, that sub has lots of examples of what I meant to explain.
---
tryhard you have to use other killer's add-ons to get kills smhtbqh
---
No add-ons or perks are used when you run a splinter offering. The survivor is an idiot.
---
All fun and shit, but they confirmed to fix the impossible cleanse toten?
---
And speaking of arguing with passion rather than logic, every single comment on your profile reeks of this exact same shit from you. Coincidence? I think not.
---
is there a ETA somewhere or is it all just soon tm?
---
Only one crying is the little bitch that made this post.
---
He same thing happened to me yesterday lol
---
If I'm running Calm Spirit and trigger a Dream Snare, what happens? I don't scream, but does Freddy still see my aura/gets notified?
---
That as much of a fix as me giving someone a cough drop to help their broken leg.
---
You don't see skill checks entire match. You pretty much have to guess when to press the button for skill check. And 95% chance you will blow up a gen. It's pretty much unplayable and I ran into this bug since Freddie redo a lot of times, few friends I play with too. It's a game breaking bug and should be marked bright red.
---
Lesion is a pretty solid main. I mean he has intel, area and shield denial, makes them unable to sprint or plant the defuser a little bit of damage from his traps.
---
Wait shit, this isn't /r/rainbow6 .....
---
Yeah just take whatever you feel is more fun to play, though having BBQ and Chili is realllllll good at making you able to unlock perks on other Killers since the extra BP is fantastic.
---
No there isn't. Excuse the reality for being different from your immagination
---
The L4D chapter (paragraph) is coming to Ps4 to day i believe
---
“Hold me daddy”
---
I like Doctor's the best
---
Sometimes it's works, sometimes it doesn't.
---
No, because they don't exist. If you're talking about the map with the tree in the middle, you can BL off of the tree, and the basement stairs.
---
can people stop reposting this its not even funny.....
---
Billy is the one talking, as he takes the place of Ron. Billy has been in the game since 2016
---
How it feels to chew 5 gum
---
same on PC, depending on the time
---
But you've not really explained the difference between ranks. You're just pretending that rank actually matters, like a killer with 3000+ hours into the game can't be green or purple ranks.
---
Thanks!
---
Sorry to bother you guys, especially since you probably get plenty of these.
---
With the newest update (haven't had a chance to read the patch notes due to work), what would be a good solo Survivor build? I tend to play more with randoms than SWF. If it helps, I'm absolutely awful at loops/jungle gyms.
---
boy do i love die at deathlight
---
Except the post you replied to, the guy literally says that he cleanses totems in red ranks, which means he has time to do it? So you should too. If everyone did it, there wouldn't be a problem. What do you not understand about this?
---
I have no idea how splinters work so i dont understand
---
Why does it feel like it's been getting worse lately? I feel like it hasn't gotten much better since the last event
---
It like doesn’t work when the killer swings, yesterday i didn’t even get a distance boost or speed boost etc it’s just really buggy, if he downs you you spaz out on the ground
---
I personally have the most fun as a killer when I hook someone, I immediately do one full patrol on all the generators. Find the one that is making a noise and hunt around said zone till I find another person for a rinse and repeat. Basically that helps me keep a healthy rotation of hooking between each survivor so I gain the most bloodpoints. Also I will run Blood point gaining perks like BBQ and Distressing as well. I've also walked out of matches gaining an easy 80k blood points if you have the right offerings equipped as well. 7/10 times Ill kill all 4 doing this method, but aside from that I feel this method makes the game fun for everyone. I noticed I get the most out of every match if I allow the survivors to feel like they can freely pull another survivor off the hook. This method allows me to kick the generator they have been working on while running (pop goes the weasel). This method is TOO fun running new Freddy. Aside from all of that, you should absolutely play this game exactly how you wish to gain the most fun out of it. Let people complain as they always will if they dont like your play-style.
---
It's not mandatory at all, and in fact a number of maps basically counter M&amp;A. You could have zero terror radius but if you're on Coldwind Farm they'll see you coming a mile away.
---
Enduring/Spirit Fury's the default M1 build, but if you want to look for a little more variety then look to detection perks. Whispers is good because it'll help you find those first survivors ASAP so you can get into Tier 2. A Nurse's Calling is good due to Myer's low terror radius in T2.
---
If you want to use M&amp;A you can pair it with Infectious Fright to give yourself an enormous terror radius in T3 to get a big slugfest started. Then at least it's always useful even if you get a big open map.
---
Other than that, M&amp;A is only necessary for one very specific build - Jumpscare Myers - which also requires a specific addon (Scratched Mirror) and a specific map offering (Lery's).
---
Ok then. Convince everybody to cleanse totems then come back to me.
---
Found the dev. Also if you buy a game there is nothing wrong with expecting it to work. lol
---
Today I played as killer and the chase music started but I did not see a single survivor ir scratchmarks
---
Thanks for the advice. It just seems like I’m not getting any better, but I want to try
---
Sometimes when you use DH you will just stutter for a sec and get exhausted. No lunge and it kinda slows you down too. Feels like it happens to me about 50% of the time.
---
Did we get bill yet?
---
Ah ok. You are green ranks. That explains a lot. I am rank 1 surv btw and i have way more experience than you. So i will tell you one last time. Nobody. Does. Totems. In. Red. Ranks. Please don't answer me random things. Get to rank 1 and see with your eyes, then answer me. Don't imagine things please
---
I only play with a SWF. Everyone I play with DOES cleanse totems. Because NOED is always a threat. Huge risk, huge reward. You're asking for an even bigger risk, for the same reward. I'm okay with you turning totems black if there's NOED, but only if all survivor's auras are revealed when there's only 1 gen left if they're running adrenaline. That's fair, right?
---
She needs some love.
---
Is this a Jojo reference?
---
Thanks!!   I've gotten at least 3K the few matches I've played with him. I'm definitely going to try what you suggest.
---
Just got the update also and no trophies on PS4. Maybe Sony got to update them in a little while.
---
You wish haha
---
Good! Now what am I supposed to do with these 100+ Moris with ghosface!? :(
---
Something I threw together in about 11 seconds. My photoshop skills are off the charts
---
Honestly I hope not. The Left Behind trophy is essentially impossible to get ever since the endgame collapse update.
---
What’s archives? People keep commenting that
---
&gt; Is it sexy and I've just never been with anybody who was down for the button play?
---
Actually yes, for both dudettes and dudes (that said, all people are different: and the below aren't exactly golden rules AFAIK).
---
Without wanting to get too graphic, the belly button works as kind of a starting line down to a dude's *ahem* and playing with him at the belly button and in the area immediately below can usually help get him feeling extra... perky.
---
For dudettes the belly button is a good place to keep track of, since her lower abdominal muscles are connected to the muscles in her *ahem*. The belly button marks the upper edge of those lower abdominal muscles and putting pressure on her belly button or the area below will usually tighten *both* sets of muscles; which can feel pleasant or make already pleasant feelings even more pleasant.
---
Facecamping was fixed a long time ago
---
Yes. I play less than an hour a day most days. And I don't play every day. It's not hard to hit rank 1. I can pip almost every game I play, and I only de-pip if the killer hard tunnels, or camps me to death. Ranking up is not hard. Rank means nothing. You're just making yourself look like an idiot thinking that rank 1 is hard or something. Lmfao
---
You don't have many women visit your place if you didn't mind 24 of em :D
---
I may need to try more but it look like Delivrance is bugged. (PS4) I had the perk active and was not able to leave the hook.
---
I'm all ears is what you should worry about, and I don't remember well, but I think lithe doesn't activates until it's a fast vault.
---
I imagine that most of those who don't agree are inexperienced who talk only because they have a mouth, like you. And some people only said that also adrenaline is annoying, not that noed is fine.
---
And you think 5+ mins is fine? You're way more patient than me.
---
You got the kills, that's all that mattered
---
Hit them twice while in Feral Frenzy to apply the status effect
---
Ahhh ok, I was kind of thinking that was the case. Thank you!
---
that is hillary us
---
Thank you guys but I already found it
---
Hitting Surviviors on hooks is intended. It's kind of a way to help against camping killers. 
---
Also facecamping is a pretty toxic strategy but it's also a pretty weak one. If you don't like facecamping I suggest you run my patented "fuck you" build. 
---
Sprint burst, Deliverance, Decisive strike, and Dance with me. 
---
Unhook urself but let the killer down you again, decisive off of them and then Sprint burst away to a window and use the blocked scratch marks from dance with me to get to safety.
---
Doubt
---
I mean you used to be able to sit right in front of the person on hook and prevent them from being unhooked altogether (had to unhook from the front) so...yeah. They are.
---
Welcome to the fog. Don't act like you know anything until you've learned the game properly, else you'll fall to bad habits and blame the game for all your faults. And more importantly: have fun.
---
Made up shit.
---
What’s wrong with it?
---
It's been a awhile since I played tbh, but I appreciate the downvotes anyway :) 
---
It was one of those perks that had no real counter play besides get lucky or go for someone who didn't have the perk and was one of the reasons I trailed off the game
---
I want to spread them out on my mattress and roll over them, feeling the squooshy softness all over my body. 24 is not enough. I clearly need hundreds of these.
---
The irony is that when they teabag they are wasting their own time, not yours. 
---
Teabagging and clicking flashlights and stuff like that honestly just doesn't bother me when I play killer. The only thing that does is all the post-game chat abuse, which is why I just have that window permanently minimised.
---
Just remember that when they teabag you or whatever it is they do to annoy you, when you eventually hit and down them it will be even sweeter.
---
So far in my short time with this game I've only teabagged a player once - A survivor on my team tried to escape with a reverse bear trap still on their head and died, so naturally I started teabagging his lifeless corpse.
---
The down votes every one of your posts has gotten says otherwise.
---
Is to be very close to the hook pretending that you are doing something but just camping.
---
yea cause i actually went into a swf and voice proximity chatted the killer asking to do it 
---
/s
---
These are AWESOME!
---
If you dont want to cleanse totems just deal with it. I mean you probally have to leave your friend behind that got hit by noed but at the end of the day he will only get one kill and thats shit enough.  Also you can just cleanse it then and rescue him with bt, then your friend prob also has ds so they even then with that so strong perk you can still get the escape
---
I'm rank 15 killer, (just joined a month ago). And I queued with a rank 19, 2- 20s and a rank 2. Needless to say I was pissed by the end of the match
---
Updates on PS4 only comes out at tuesdays, around 1-2pm.
---
I have the trophies listed.
---
Taking One For The Team - Take a Protection Hit 250 times near a recently unhooked survivor.
---
Left For Dead - As the last person alive, finish the last generator escape through the exit gate
---
And of course Adapt Bill
---
You know why you pip so easily? Because you are in greed ranks. And you know what you, instead, look like? Like an idiot who talks shit, based on his imagination of reality, and not on solid experience.
---
Thank you so much!
---
i've been hit by,   
---
i've been struck by  
---
truck
---
Now this is what I joined the DBD subreddit for, that and shitposts
---
No its bugged, I've been using it forever and I can tell you it does not work as it should.
---
but this reads like a buff
---
Nah NOED was supposed to be reworked alongside it's true equivalents on survivor side in Decisive and Mettle of Man but somehow you guys got both of those for free without having to cede anything on your babycrutch.  You're not getting a 3 for 1.
---
But i wouldn't recommend Lesion if you are more into something like roaming, in which case, Vigil is your man. But might be a little complicated to use if you don't have good map knowledge, and if you don't use your gadget as you should, you screwed yourself. Imo he is already worth because of his K1A, it's a fookin' beast.
---
I agree, i prefer Legion but BBQ and Chili helps a lot, a must have in almost every killer.
---
Did you buy the killer with cells?
---
Throw some polka at this it will be wonderful
---
I've got plenty of experience with the game. I've played against red rank killers. I've played against yellow rank killers that were better than some red rank killers I've played against. Your argument makes absolutely no sense. If the killer has enough pressure that you don't have time to cleanse totems, he's probably not using NOED anyway. Get over yourself. Devs have said the perk is fine. It has a valid and VERY EASY counter. The problem is that people like you want to whine about it instead of countering it.
---
I didn't know this actually. The only thing I did know was that buying one of 2 presented perks would spawn the entity immediately, meaning I wouldn't have to spend as much bloodpoints reaching the next level
---
Although I'm not personally a fan of the gratuitous cleavage, the art looks amazing and the mouse pads themselves are very professionally made.
---
Awesome work as always!
---
Tru
---
They shouldn't be appearing on the Bloodweb if you own the DLC. However, I do believe there's a bug where if you bought them from the shop instead of the full DLC the splinters will continue appearing.
---
I've seen people say that if you bought the killer with shards and not by the dlc pack that you'll still get the splinters in bloodwebs.
---
Die.
---
They’re there for me
---
I'm not sure he seemed pretty intent on staying in that one spot..
---
Anyone that believes that false equivalency has never compared the two perks side by side with objectivity.  Look at the effects and trigger event for both.  NOED comes out the clear winner in each metric.
---
&gt;Text heavy posts
---
this post is about the icons not the text
---
seems like the truth
---
I can't wait. 
---
I saw a post about the new crash bandicoot game on the PS4 subreddit and how it took them like 2 minutes to find a game and THAT was unconceivable for them...
---
And then the camera enters third person....
---
game breaking bugs such as invisible skillchecks should be their priority
---
Winter 2017
---
You're right, never bother rank 20s. Sorry. Anyway, if you think you are right only because rank 20s agree with you, go to a big dbd streamer chat, like truetalent, and ask what he thinks of noed. He has way more experience than me, and i have more experience than you, so if you don't wanna listen to me at least listen to him. If you want to win the debate then ok, you won, because apes together strong, but go ask experienced people. If a 2000+ hours streamer says that noed is fine you win, but i have serious doubt about this.
---
Thank you very much!
---
What do you mean “consumes the ultra rare slot”?
---
HOLY those are strong, like two times Mettle-of-Man pre-nerf
---
Aww man. But it IS a bug?
---
That’s unfortunate. Okay.
---
Yes I paid money and want the product to work, I'm so entitled.
---
When you see that pyt right in front of your tree...
---
You mean Blood Warden?
---
1. All the pistons will be moving and moving fast at that. So if you look at a gen not worked on it will have no movement.
---
2. The basement is the best play to put a survivor its not required but its very useful. The reason is because the basement is a choke point its a narrow stair case that the killer can block and typically the killer can hit or get another person while at the basement.
---
3. Perks and addons can be very strong together. Utilizing and comboing them can lead to near unstoppable killers. Some addons dont stack so be sure to read them.
---
4. You will never know what hex is what. You can assume if thats the only hex totem and ruin is active. But be very wary of haunted grounds its a trap hex that exposes everyone.
---
5. So this can be solved by using a shroud of binding to spawn with other survivors or using perks like bond to locate other ones. I dont recomend it because finding other survivors isnt that important.
---
6. Do gens, learn how to loop, dont throw down pallets all the time, now I'm not talking shit on all streamers but some arent very good and afvice shouldnt be taken that serious. For example if someone has played since launch and I've never seen them in red or purple ranks i might not listen to them.
---
Nope. Got that lovely bug in my 3rd game with this patch. After ~3 months with this annoying bug I am ready for a fix, havent played much since a while and it looks like I should give "Hide or Die" a shot.
---
Ash next please :)

To many over 4000 ingame hours and i still dont got all perks on every killer and survivor
---
These are awesome! Great job!
---
I am not 100% sure. If it is it's one of the bugs that the devs are either unaware of or can't be bothered to fix since it's been a thing since the introduction of the shop. I can't see a reason why it'd be an intended feature though.
---
Kate wants nothing to do with this.
---
Just realized that a few of you didn't know that the mouse pads are 3D. The chest area is a wrist rest.

I think Dwight might be next on the docket, but I hear your request for weird Ash fan art. :P
---
Flashlights aren't threatening at all but the insta heals are a problem for sure.  Still could have been worse.  No one brought a key.
---
I can tell you're trying to be a smartass but you clearly dont know that its bugged and it worked just fine before the update
---
90% of the time in my experience, it's either bait or toxic, but it does make good bait
---
Yeah it's still somehow dragging it's mangled corpse forward on both PC and console last I checked.
---
But unless the devs resolve the numerous bugs that are still plaguing the game it will bleed out soon.
---
Sorry no battery left in my brain. I'm sick trying convince noobs. Go ask a big dbd streamer.
---
I dunno, that look in her eye says otherwise, at least to me...
---
Thank you so much! I appreciate that. &lt;3
---
4k can be tricky with some Bubba setups as he just can't effectively patrol both gates and a hatch unless he's had an exceptionally lucky map roll.
---
For me, so long as I got the 4 stacks of BBQ then the last player is free to go. If you desperately want that final kill then you're very likely going to have to slug number three in order to buy time to locate number four - although it's in your best interest to avoid that problem by "letting" the last two survivors "team up" on one of your 3-gen gens so that you can down both at once (aggressively patrol only two of the three and they'll be obliged to work on the last one, which is hopefully where you corner and down them both).
---
Good luck!
---
Yeah a lot of these are way too strong, but some of them are kind of useless. Needs some more balance or an in-between.
---
Pyt?
---
The survivor equivalent of NOED is Adrenaline. Which has not been changed. DS and MoM were just busted in general. You couldn't counter MoM, and DS could only be countered by being lucky enough to down the person near a hook. They needed to be reworked. NOED has a counter.
---
Since the splinters are an ultra rare, getting them from Boxes is such shit. They also are an item that I literally do not need to use, so my bloodwebs are taxing me for an item that is dead.
---
IT iS a CoMpUtEr GaMe...
---
Getting emotionally invested because you lost is hilarious and I know you lost because otherwise you wouldn't care. How many times as killer have you killed 3 and gotten annoyed because the last guy tbagged? If answer exceeds 0 you need therapy.
---
I'm not saying you're bad, but I sure as shit know you're more pissed about losing than you are them tbagging. Take a look at yourself and find the real cause of your frustration before assuming it's due to the actions of others.
---
Sadly this is true
---
It different than bodyblocking bro. Bodyblocking is a mechanic otherwise there would be no collision. Spamming sound its fucking pussy shit. If you play killer and have that happen all the time you'd realize how annoying having constant pussy noises in your ear.
---
I’ve had this happen to many people trying to teabag me on the exit gate. Karma.
---
Indeed! Corrected above, thanks
---
That is a bold comment and I respect it. I see what you mean even though every survivor here is mad at you.
---
Camera to him. Yes, you keep your % exposed if you knock him out it. It resets after you are hit/downed. Group play breaks ghostface so much. Remember each set of eyes in the group is a set of eyes that can knock him out. Yes he could potentially mark more people this way but that is not his strong suit. It doesn't take long to knock him out and if two or more people are watching it is much more likely you  will see him coming and knock him out of his power. Most experience ghostface players will target individual survivors over groups but don't take for granted as they won't pass up the opportunity to mark multiple survivors if they can. Maps with high points with open windows and doors, like the Asylum maps are a favorite for  ghostface players in that they can often get easy multiple marks off fairly safely. Once got a quad mark on a group that way
---
NOED : can be countered very easily, in 50 seconds. Gives the ability to down survivors in a healthy state with one hit.
---
Adrenaline : has absolutely no counter whatsoever. Immediately heals up to 4 people by one health state. Gives 150% speed boost, so if adrenaline pops while the killer is chasing, the survivor gets free distance in the chase.
---
Looks like Adrenaline wins out here, friend.
---
\*sigh\*  
---
Didn't think that was necessary tbh
---
My P0 bloodwebs, at mid-high ranks always have one ultra-rare, and rarely two.
---
If you end up getting a DLC splinter for a killer you already own, that means you didn't get an Ebony Mori or Ultra-Rare addon.
---
For example I own all DLC's and my Billy bloodwebs ALWAYS have an Ebony every bloodweb. If I had this bug going on, some bloodwebs would have a useless splinter instead of the ebony mori. 
---
I still have a ton of pig splinters saved up after I bought the SAW DLC. I use them when I want to spook survivors since it's a secret offering and makes it look like I have a Mori.
---
What's that DS icon from?
---
if it is to a team mate its a way to say hi, if it is at the gates to the killer althought u never tbaged at the whole game, ur a coward, and if it is all game to the killer, they are toxic bitches
---
You're describing the lag issue with Dead Hard that's been around for a while. There's a new bug in 3.1.0 that's not tied to lag.
---
You can activate dead hard without getting any dash, even when the killer isn't anywhere near you.
---
Not good != awful. Just not good enough to reach red ranks.
---
I... uh... you okay buddy? You want to talk? :D
---
These trophies will take forever! 250 hits? I hope it is changed
---
Fuck that 250 protector hits... I mean seriously BHVR...?
---
Haha, I'm glad I could make you happy. Thank you!

Which one?
---
I think they took all the memes about them over-nerfing Pig personally and are looking to make amends.
---
No they’re okay and virtually impossible to detect anyway.
---
Dance with me is hard for a new player to use properly. I'd recommend something like Boil Over. It won't *usually* save you, but it will always annoy the killer which makes it good for a fuck you build
---
No, there's a bug right now where go through the Exit doesn't cause the game to end for you, forcing you to either find the Hatch or die to the EGC.
---
The devs also have no clue how to fix it and are still trying to understand what causes it, so it'll probably stay here for quite while.
---
Is rather see him just get the brown bag as part of his base kit.  One trap Trapper is such a slog to play.
---
I completely agree. Furthermore, I think that you're making some really good points here, and I commend you on really taking your time to compose such eloquence. Elegance is really a dying art.
---
Hit twice but Devs said they will change that. It's stupid right now lol
---
No worries, thanks for showing interest! &lt;3
---
Theres literally a sub dedicated to dbd porn that mostly focuses on females. Not that I visit or know anything.
---
If you genuinely think BL is useful all the time then yikes. Or any perk. Hell adrenaline can be useless if you don’t make it to all 5 gens being done.
---
nah cause your never gonna get hooked with primed adrenaline and dead hard, the mom is just in case you get hit
---
people are really weird about teabagging in this game. Like, it sucks to be on teabagged, it doesnt feel great but teabagging has happened in every single online game ever created.
---
Thanks for the support. And if it makes people happy, they should know that the next batch (if I end up making another batch) is going to have a very lovely Dwight booty on display. I'm all for gender equality. :P

NOED does not give two extra health states, NOED gives one extra health state. Just like adrenaline. If 4 people are running adrenaline, then it would take all 4 people getting downed with NOED to make that an even trade (which never happens, btw, unless all 4 people are idiots.) And the fact that NOED can be countered, but the only counter for Adrenaline IS NOED, makes Adrenaline the clear winner. I use Adrenaline as survivor 100% of the time. As killer, I only use NOED if I don't have Ruin.
---
\&gt; Had to order 24
---
DOUBT.
---
Software macros are - hence why i said to use your keyboard or mouse technology.
---
I didn't made any equivalency, I made fun of this guy thinking his hours somehow made everything he said as a fact. Noed and Adrenaline are different and fulfill different roles, you can't really compare them. Objectively, NOED is stronger because it's the point, killer is supposed to be the power role, on the other side, survivors can have up to 4 adrenaline as they are the numerous role. Even if the perks were similar, 4 lesser perks against 1 stronger perks are pretty balanced, specially knowing NOED can just be removed by survivors.
---
I cant just list every kink subreddit. People will start to talk.
---
The joke is pretty funny, but on a serious note do people really get annoyed facing Wraith? 
---
Maybe it's just me, but he's so adorable I can't even get mad at him if he facecamps while cloaked.
---
I took a photo everyday for 100 days
---
Been playing since launch on console been rank 1 multiple times as survivor and killer noed isn’t a problem just break the totem and get your head out your ass rank doesn’t matter.
---
Guess it wasn't a... Nea miss.
---
Thank you
---
I feel the opposite, I can’t go two seconds on this sub without seeing this stupid shirtless Myers bullshit
---
Am I better off using Billy instead of Bubba? Bbq and chili is the main reason why I want him but I have over 12,000 shards and can wait for it to be on the shrine ( If it ever comes ) I just don’t wanna waste money on a killer I probably won’t like. I’ve been watching videos and it seems like Billy is better in certain ways.
---
Thoughts?
---
Thanks for the help!

You're actually defending iri head.

Splinters are for the DLC Killers and will only stop spawning in your Killer's bloodwebs when you have bought the relevant DLC.
---
You burn them as an Offering before a match and you spawn in-game as whatever Killer is linked to that splinter.
---
When in-game as the splinter's Killer, you will have no Perks or Add-Ons, regardless of what you chose in setup. The splinter overrides all of that.
---
The entire concept is a way of making an in-game 'demo' of DLC Killers to tempt people into buying them.
---
Hope that helped.
---
Tbh I just do it for the blood points.
---
It used to give 250,000 if i’m not mistaken
---
"Host disconnected" Should be big enough of a clue to understand that, just like in CoD's.
---
Oh yeah thanks for the reminder.
---
We're you pressing the run button? It doesn't work otherwise
---
I was thinking like maybe on the last gen, Survivors who are running *Premonition* or even *Spine Chill* will be notified of the Killer's NOED by the perk icon turning red, then back to its appropriate color once all totems are cleansed.
---
As is custom.
---
Usually takes me less than a minute.
---
He’s an update.  Along with all the cosmetics shown. All free and all already part of the game. Only an update needed.
---
What? Sound is an element of the game that killers use to their advantage. Taking that away hurts them. It's not effective cause it's annoying, its effective cause it hurts the killers ability to track. Play killer above rank 15 and understand that there is more to the game then being a bitch boy survivor. I bet you disconnect all the time or when you're first down too. What a pussy.
---
For Freddy they could force different parts of the body into the dream world
---
Thats exactly how i would use it too, to do some EXTRA toxic shit 😂
---
I see this message format a bit, is this PS4?
---
No his mori should stay the same but the body actually splits
---
This is awesome. Just realized these would be sick stencils too
---
Most of them are alright, its really just the older original killers (Hillbilly, Trapper, Wratih) that have terrible moris. Personally I love the Hag's just for how savage and animal like it is.
---
What is a rainbow map? 😳
---
I agree, if the killers toxic you get a free pass
---
This is what would make me leave a game as killer, I don't leave many games, but when I do, it's because a survivor is being as asshole.
---
Snares make a noise when triggered in the same way traps do. There's no "loud noise notification" explosion sound, so pretty sure it's just the scream notification and the weird omnidirectional ghost noise.
---

I played a bubba yesterday on Leary’s who had blood warden, insidious, iron grasp, and agitation. That was the scariest ending to a game I’ve ever played. Simple thing is, is that basement was right next to exit, he walks out, kills me and then drops me in basement, waits till door is opened, and then proceeded to hook me. Friend got trapped at exit, Dwight saved me, and I DS’d out of his grasp. 😂

**Rule #103**: Don't leave your teammates to die. 
---
- Take a break from the generators, even if there's only one left and even if the Killer is camping, to save your teammate from the hook before struggle state/they get sacrificed.
---
- I mean how else will the Killer max out their Sacrifice points?
---
**Rule #104**: If every chest isn't searched before the EGC the Survivors are toxic genrushing tryhards.
---
**Rule #105**: After you search a chest you're not allowed to take the item inside. It belongs to the Killer, not you.
---
Nice idea. It would also evaluate these perks. But i think that every survivor must know tht the killer has a perk like noed(very strong and very annoying). Note that survs would also need to go check totems to see if they are white or black(losing precious seconds). 1 more thing. I think your idea would help too much swf groups, where only 1 needs to have the perk required to make all the team know the perk. Swf are already strong enough, and i think they don't need another boost. Anyway i was also thinking about a surv perk that in some way reveals you killer perks. But it remains a problem with swf groups. The perk would be cool if you need to do specific actions to reveal killer perks.
---
It won’t
---
It worked cause that Plague was playing that wrong
---
Well for the record, a shirtless Myers skin in and of itself isn't sexual, but the memes around it are
---
I tried to make a counter argument but I couldn't
---
It’s just that outfit. You’ll have to wear something else. I don’t think they textured his legs so they’re just invisible lol
---
Ah, my bad! I've never seen it. Is it console only?
---
Swap Mettle with Decisive
---
Then you miss it and get hooked. But you have deliverence, you unhook yourself and run for the exit, but the killer has blood Warden and you die before you can escape. But then, you call the killer toxic for winning so he kills himself and you win. But then out of no where your PC explodes and kills you in a horrible death...
---
You're wrong with your first statement.  NOED does remove TWO health states while Adrenaline only heals one.  Adrenaline will heal you from dying to injured or injured to healthy while NOED will drop you from Healthy to Dying in 1 hit.  That is indeed two health states.  
---
Again if you look at my points they're hard to dispute.  NOED is the clear winner in effect and trigger event and I even went on to acknowledge that it's only argument for not being better is the fact that it can potentially be cleansed which funnily enough is what you lead with here as your main point.
---
dont be salty if the killer camps and tunnels off-hook, its a legitimate strategy and if you dc because youre unable to play the game or the match is incredibly unfun, youre a pussy. 
---
do dull totems, unless the killer has noed, then dont do totems, but dont do gens either
---
dont use keys
---
dont hide
---
i will slug until the downed person is on their last drop of blood to ensure my 4k, dont bitch about being stuck on the ground for 3 minutes because I'm so sweaty and want those 4 kills
---
no balanced landing on haddonfield
---
no infinites
---
i will do everything in my power to ensure the game is over as fast as possible and the survivors have no chance at a safety pip or bloodpoints. Only i get pip/points and only i get to have fun
---
"Now, you must die!"
---
Yesterday was the first time I interacted with the store and saw this shrine tab, now I learned you can convert to bloodpoints on already owned perks. Thanks for the tip lol
---
"Mindgames"
---
The only way in which Bubba is better is that he theoretically can down multiple survivors in one go. This rarely happens. In exchange Billy has crazy good map pressure and he doesn't slow down to a crawl when revving his chainsaw. Plus Bubba's chainsaw starts slow despite needing to make up more distance, so even if you get the saw going they might still get to a vault before you catch back up.
---
why's that? High volume as spirit is how you find people in phase and get waluigi'd
---
I agree with pretty much everything you just said.  And for the record I don't want to be confused with that guy.  Me and him aren't on the same side lol.  I try to make logical counterpoints for why I think so little of NOED while his come from a place of being absurdly salty and immature about it.
---
I don't get the point of this post. Is the OP survivor or killer?
---
it's basically a DC active
---
It removes two health states, but getting hit normally takes one health state. So getting hit with NOED takes one extra health state on top of the one health state you already lose when getting hit. So NOED does ONE extra damage, not two.
---
The new meta is last second item switching to keys lol.  I swear toxic twats pull that against me in 2/5 games or so.  Lots of keys in red ranks.
---
I should give this a try, but I suck without my scaredy cat
---
I slug survivors on their last hook so that way they still have a chance
---
Bill got added and his perks were moved around from bloodwebs and shiz
---
Really? I get tons of trash talk to Xbox. I counted over 100 messages a few weeks ago, and I go out of my way to play nice.

They called him a madman

Eh.  I don’t get that much. Surprisingly, I get more positive DbD messages than negative. If I get negative messages, I just report them. 8/10 times they get suspended
---
Of all things it was an ambulance too..

Oh i got bill the other day ive done adept for him
---
A legion Movie would be so cool
---
Better version of this was posted years ago.
---
Thank you! It works! Now I can shitpost again!
---
Currently playing, it take about 50 seconds to 2-3 minutes to get in a lobby.
---
I can't wait for the project they're working on together. everybody wants the demagorgon as the killer, but i don't think they'll do that since it's not human and never was (as far as we know), i think billy will be the killer, he even did the over the shoulder carry thing. I'm psyched
---
I see how you're rationalizing it and I think you understand how I am.  My point was Adrenaline cannot proc and heal you from dying to healthy but NOED can proc and drop you from healthy to dying.  Only difference is you're including the hit itself for free essentially.
---
Must just be that I'm always at rank 1 or something...
---
Thinking about it, reminds me of GTA
---
That would actually be a useful perk since you can heal others faster
---
I understand that some of them might be too OP as I said in my post. Do you have exemple of some that are OP and why they are ?
---
Just a hotfix for bugs and some other things for why it's 8gb I have no clue
---
I actually agree with this. Right up until I killer rank 14, I might run into a toxic person once every four or five games. But the higher I climb the more toxic players I run into.
---
Dead Hard is very usefull on No Mither and even Adrenaline has a use
---
Oh then I dunno PlayStation has the same update rn. Maybe it’s bug fixes or something
---
It really is connection, that's why we are getting dedicated servers
---
Okay thanks!
---
well, it will give you the speed boost but since you are broken, it won't heal you
---
This is actually a useful build believe it or not. It's the build where you lead other people to a treasure you cannot posses (you can't get healed, but you heal other people quicky)
---
For clarity, I will agree that there is no time for totems if you are literally just running around searching for totems and nothing else. 1 Guy doing that might be ok, questionable but ok, 2 will be a loss guaranteed.
---
Thats not what i'm doing
---
I just don't ignore them when I see them. Basically when i see one on my way to a gen i cleanse it. 
---
Having watched a bunch of streamers playing dbd, ive seen it many times people seeing them, pointing them out with a "not lit" and carry on, then complain about NOED once it hits. Mind you in games where they would have had the time doing them.
---
Gratz
---
Leatherface or Billy? Billy ain't too hard as long as you're right up against their butt when you chainsaw, but Leatherface is a pain in the ass to land chainsaws with, I always whiff at the last second.
---
I haven't seen them myself, but go check them. I guarantee if they do exist, that the position of the docs face is different because there is 0 chance that I put it in the exact same spot as somebody else.
---
Why do you do this
---
I'd say mettle of man instead of left behined. Left behined is useless just because left behined is useless, while mettle of man is made weaker when running no mither
---
Rank 1 is a pretty meaningless and easy accomplishment. That's the problem. If getting to rank 1 isn't hard and you're stuck at rank 7, there's just so much wrong with the ranking system.
---
Either my wifi cut out, or the killers did for just a second, and this happened
---
Getting stalked while making direct eye contact with Ghost face :(
---
That comes easily with time
---
Might want to show this to r/dbdgonewild
---
That's all I'm saying to do. Most totems are right next to gens. People see them, then ignore them and move on. If you see a totem, cleanse it. It takes 10 seconds of your time, to completely wipe out one of the killers four perks. It's a fair balance. I don't actively seek out totems, unless I'm fairly sure the killer has NOED. I just cleanse them when I see them.
---
Great!  Hope you enjoyed it both times 👍
---
It's even worse when depression uses a mori on me and I'm just useless for the rest of the week
---
Pretty sure the word you were looking for was "Warning" not advice.
---
Which would kinda be against how anything is this game is meant.
---
What I mean is you don't get a warning that either the Killer or a Survivor is using a specific Perk, except No Mither, and honestly that is fine that way.
---
The thing about NOED is that if you are a bad Killer it will most likely only give you about 1 Kill unless the survivors are complete idios. 
---
In Higher Rank i basically see it as a "I just wanna relax a bit Lategame" Perk, which honestly is fine.
---
Yeah I've had games like that before. I've had games where the very second I down someone I've got the rest of their team jumping out of trees and shit with flashlights. Like dude, the game JUST started. This ain't a kyf match I'm gonna fuck you up y'all better find something to do before you all become my sluggy little pets for the next 5 minutes. They're the ones that talk the most shit. They play like jackasses then get mad when you smash them.
---
Dear lord.
---
So bill came to consoles as a wraith weapon. Wow.
---
It's comin' down the pipeline!
---
Some people I play with said it's still possible to stun the Wraith while he's uncloaking. I thought that got buffed out?
---
Yeah, it should be changed to “in a chase.” Doesn’t really solve the camping issue if survivors are trying to save a hooked survivor but the killer is just standing there.
---
Genuinely curious: how is the survivor being an asshole here?
---
Poor Jane!
---
I think this is the first thing I've made that belongs on there, yeah.
---
I was once reported because someone accused me of tunneling them when they got off the hook.... the other survivor literally unhooked them as I was chasing them and used lithe to get away. What am I supposed to do? 
---
“Let me keep chasing the guy who’s already on the other side of the map and completely ignore the survivor who just got unhooked so he doesn’t think I’m tunneling and gets triggered.”
---
Du du du du du du du du, tu du du du, tu du du du tu du

Lol the reason killer queues suck is because survivor is boring, not because they are at a disadvantage. BHVR can't seem to get this whole "lobbying system" thing down

Hilarious lmao

I think it would be fun to do a Feng Min one at some point, but I don't know which cosmetic I'd use! What would you suggest?

Wait so how does his left behind trophy work, and even his perk left behind, if end game collapse is a thing??? Does anyone have an answer lol

Lmao made my day :)
---
I always send a screenshot of the proximity to hook whenever someone accuses me of camping lol. They usually don’t reply back
---
Might want to get more these, the people there would want tons of them.
---
Noed costs a perk slot, so thats not really what I mean. But yes its free in the sense you dont have to do anything to activate it, like say "Bond" for survivors. 
---
But the idea isnt to bait the killer to get me out of the locker, its to obfuscate their sounds and barrage them with noise notifications to hopefully assist your teammate in escaping.
---
I'm sorry that you don't like the mouse pads, and that you're offended. Thanks for sharing your opinion!
---
Can we get a Dwight version? It'd be like:  
---
Locker  
---
Unlocks potential in one's shitting-self ability.  
---
\- Press the active ability button to enter a random locker.  
---
\- You cannot exit the locker.  
---
\- Causes Blindness, Deafness, Getting Out At The Worst Possible Time and Leaving Allies To Die.  
---
\- Applies the Bad Practices debuff until Dwight Fairfield is switched out of.  
---
"Its a legitimate strategy! I didn't lose did I!?" - Dwight Fairfield.
---
I get them more frequently from fellow survivors than killers. Killers just say "gg", whether its sarcastic or not, I appreciate it lol.
---
Other survivors will either try to blame me for them dying or occasionally I'll get positive messages.
---
I'm 10 and I'm sure the killer was 10 or 11.
---
Spine Chill

You know me too well. &gt;\_&gt;

Before my PC broke I used to play casually this game on Steam and it was in portuguese. So I went to console to play, that was the same feeling xD

I told 'em the translation is coming but some ppl act like I'm a bhvr employee xD Thanks for sharing man

Found it somewhere on reddit a few weeks ago, dunno where :/ i could send it to you probably if you want
---
Oh yeah. Hella derp for me

---
Her... her name is Marina
---
I hope so man, I really do. So no more 'repeating the same stuff again' xD
---
thanks for the reply tho
---
Xbox gottem. Adept Bill is okay. Left Behind is unlikely to happen without an afk killer and swf DC teammates. 250 protection hits is already a chore, but the game chooses not to register progress. Theres a small window of time and you must be a certain distance from your teammate when you take the hit. The distance and time required is more strict than the in game scoring.
---
Freddy's mori is taken directly from the 2010 movie, unless I'm mistaken. I watched it on Hulu a couple weeks ago and when I saw the kill I yelled, "He just got mori'd!"
---
Oh he’s finally in?
---
Thank you for showing me this piece of art
---
"No flashlights allowed" ...
---
Guess, he got nerfed.
---
Wait 2017.....what.
---
Were dedicated servers promised back then??
---
About 50% of the time it simply doesn’t work. You’ll be exhausted but won’t move or be immune to hits.
---
Sadly i didnt expose myself too much to new freddy yeah.
---
But it'd be something about either wasting pallets in fear of dream ones or how he can fuck you up by teleport cancelling...
---
Some people don't believe me that I actually got complimented on my skill at red ranks without camping or tunneling but with a 4k.
---
Dead hard, sprint burst, borrowed time, balanced landing, iron will, quick and quiet, decisive strike
---
She would never get to the fountain with the amount of bodies in the way, and that's just the ones body blocking her. There would also be a giant wall of them blocking the fountains.
---
In the 3 year live stream they showed an example, it was a picture of claudette in her youth. Its all focused on the history of every character. Maybe they will add videos.
---
I like your suggestions. :P As it is, about 40% of them have sold. If I can sell them all, I can afford to pay for another order, but I'd probably do different art for those. We'll see. Thanks. &lt;3
---
Lol.add sprint burst and dead hard
---
So thats how everything started. We are witnessing the lore of Nea becoming killer right here.
---
Noed is an exception. It needs to give you a warning because is the most annoying and abused killer perk. Anyway you are wrong, because the killer gets a warning when a surv has ds, because that surv becomes the obsession.
---
Same here I keep getting tearable match making.
---
The several times I’ve used kindred i consistently got left on the hook until my second phase. Idk why it happens but it does.
---
A: The owners of the property rights will not likely be interested in another game so soon after the previous one tanked
---
and
---
B: We literally have a copy cat of him in the game. That's what the trapper is. He even has a mask that is similar.
---
Am I living in the bizarro Berenstien universe?  It takes me upwards of 10 minutes to find a survivor game, yet searching for a killer game tops off at around 3 minutes.  I’ve basically stopped playing survivor altogether because the queue times are so ridiculously unreasonable.
---
I'd gladly wait longer for a fair match.
---
i did it! it activated!
---
hmm... thats actually good
---
Good lord
---
"Man up"
---
Same could be said about you, get good and unless you're so trash you need a mori to win.
---
Maybe if his ability was to cut pallets that weren’t thrown down.
---
Lmfao
---
No. You have to get the bill teachable for it to appear in any new webs again.
---
The ambulance arrived promptly at the scene of the accident so I don't know what you're complaining about...
---
As a killer main, I’ll tell you right now that if a survivor is hiding behind a tree, they’re starting the next chase injured.
---
The main reason killer queuetimes suck now is due to the ptb update they added to how the matchmaking finds players while working on ghost face, it sucked on ptb and they still decided to ship it live. so its not due to the amount of players on each side of the coin its literally the matchmaking taking time to look
---
You really don't need to apologise, your thing doesn't effect me, but I just had to say my peice with this myers comparison.
---
"Breathing is effective"
---
Differently from those other in the comments i totally agree with you. Leatherface needs a REWORK not a buff, he his Billy 2.0, less fun and less strong. Even a buff wouldn't change that, people would anyway prefer billy. So he needs a rework. And another killer that in my opinion needs a rework is the doctor.
---
i am so sorry
---
i swear i will watch it im planning to
---
dont hurt me
---
We just had one not long ago with Ghostface so I’m guessing it will be at least a couple months if not longer. They don’t like to do them too often to ‘protect the bloodpoint economy’
---
Getting "mindgamed" by rng passive phasing when she's just walking around is peak skill tbh. Very fair.
---
Dude Freddy with Father-Daughter glasses is busted as shit. Played against 30 of them last night.
---
I was shaking at the knees
---
Could I come again please
---
Yeah them ladies were too kind
---
You’ve been... Thunders*TRUCK*
---
The most recent update buffed survivor bloodpoint earnings and nerfed an already underwhelming killer, and the last two updates were put in to rework a completely awful killer and fix a bugged one. Yes, Killers get more updates, but its because there is more variety to that side of the game and the killers need more changes because they all interact with the meta in different ways. Survivor doesnt have that, and is overall solid, outside of a few balancing issues.
---
This is where we all have to be mindful of how others may perceive us. In a thread a few days ago I read that some survivors thought that teabagging at the exit gates was just a way of saying bye bye to the killer, they had no idea it was seen as toxic.
---
Well, I don't like anyone feeling uncomfortable. That doesn't mean I wouldn't make something like this--lots of things like this (and way worse) exist in the world. But I still feel bad that you were bothered by the objectification and the comparison. No worries.
---
YOU ARE OUT OF MY LEAGUE GOT MY HEARTBRAT RACING
---
Yeah, pretty much.
---
I love this. This is so cool.
---
Killer. The offering burnt is the "Smoking Splinter" which lets you play as Freddy in the next game, but with no perks or addons. The power icon and addons are for the spirit, meaning OP selected spirit, but burned the Splinter to play the next game as Freddy.
---
The survivor is complaining, saying that OP is a tryhard for using very good addons at rank 16, even though you can't use addons with a splinter.
---
TLDR: Killer, the survivor is being salty
---
EDIT: [Here's the splinters in the game](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Offerings#Splinters)
---
Idk if we're playing the same game but no one ranks up if the game goes to fast. The most you'll get is a black pip. It's really done. Escaping and 4king should confirm a pip.
---
Red ranks has a decent chunk of SWF - if one person anywhere on the map sees you place that trap then they all know where it is and it will be disarmed when convenient.
---
Trapper gets curb stomped by good players. If you decide to play him know this going into it and feel good if you win anyway because you probably did pretty well or they played like potatoes.
---
This is awesome!
---
Haha these are awesome! I’d like to see one for my girl Feng, though.
---
Damn I guess I missed that one. Thanks!
---
Let my boy cut through pallets and keep on trucking with his chainsaw.

Tbh there not so bad... I just wanted to debate over the myers thing, I wouldn't mind an Ash with a big ol butt to rest my wrist on so I can't really say these are bad.. I guess I take that part back.
---
I agree. Yesterday i had one of those Billy games where i won in like 2 minutes because 3 of the survivors were really bad.... i only got black pip.
---
But personally i don't care, getting to red ranks isn't that fun. Its just silly that the game force me to keep facing the people i dominate, not very fun for them.
---
Sounds like he’s being sarcastic. Sadly there are people out there that are really like this.
---
it is. 
---
You would need to have exactly 1/4 play Killer to have Minimum q times and because thats not always the case, the q takes quite long with only 15k People.
---
truck-kun strikes again
---
The last replies were actually kinda heated, I only got the pic before the match started, it wasn’t really sarcasm I don’t think
---
I don’t think surviving should guarantee a pip. I’ve seen too many people escape with 12k total points (after the escape bonus)
---
In most cases you don’t deserve to pip then
---
For new players, I suggest having fun with your loadouts as you learn the game. You won't be playing against the best survivors/killers, and remember, you don't need to kill everyone or survive to "win". Winning is honestly what you make it in this game. There's no reward for ranking up beyond facing better survivors and having better teammates so I like to focus on bloodpoints personally.
---
Most of your questions have been answered so I'll add onto finding survivors as a killer. Low ranks tend to be obvious, but it gets harder as they learn to hide. A good headset is great for hearing the occasional breath, and you'll learn the common places and strategies for hiding. There are perks and killer powers that make this easier, but most of the game is about the chase. You'll rarely get survivors who focus on always hiding, but when you do, it can be a strong strategy.
---
Thanks! :)
---
Was she Mori'd by a legion?
---
Criticise the devs in this game for their spaghetti code and balancing issues all you like, those are valid complaints, but the devs are not lazy. They don't always prioritise the right stuff, but the only reason the game is still alive is because the devs have put a lot of work into bringing regular new content to the game. We get 8 new characters each year with 3 perks each, usually a new map associated with each killer, events, reworks and sometimes we get completely new stuff like the cosmetics store, tutorials with BP rewards, and the upcoming archives system which will be really cool.
---
Lol this is actually gold, great job once again Rory.😍I might have to get myself one of these👌
---
No, you were right the first time. You can check the patch notes, 3.0 made enduring only work on pallets and 3.1 corrected a stun time issues.
---
The more you know.
---
I'm not exactly sure that that's a real excuse anyone is using (possibly though, knowing this game). Can the number of popped hex totems really have gone up that much just because of a simple BP buff?
---
It's definitely a concern, but there are a lot of people who sell DBD fan art, and as far as I know, there haven't been any issues. If I were given a directive to stop selling, I would immediately. Also, I don't normally sell stuff--I give it away for free--but the cost of these mouse pads was just too high for me to eat, which is why I made a shop.
---
Lol The Pig looking down like ‘wait that actually worked?’

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cjvi48/new_skillcheck_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
well she is in luck the truck that hit her can take her back to the hosiptal
---
You only gain MoM stacks for protection hits, if you unhook in front of the killer then DS is gonna help you a lot more
---
I mean if the survivors escape that would be silly to give the win to the killer and depip the survivors...? At the core the point of this game is for survivors to escape and for the Killer to kill them.
---
even so you he was quite a distance away from the window and it should have 100% not hit him, i’ll try to get my friend in later tonight and record it if needed, but the hit boxes do need some work done to them, the amount of times i’ve been hit after vaulting a window and being well out is insane, and even when i play killer i call out the bs hits i get and question if it should have hit. but i get what you mean
---
This happens when a file is corrupted while updating the game. Right click on Dead by Daylight on Steam, go to properties, local files, and then verify integrity. This'll find any files that are corrupted and replace them.
---
If you're on console, you can do more or less the same thing, although it'll be in a different place of course. I don't know the steps off the top of my head.
---
Does anyone know a good survivor build for meg, I'm fairly new to the game and don't really know what to use? (I mainly play solo but sometimes SWF)
---
I want a Meg one (Meg main)
---
The pig also looking had me dying lol
---
"What we're not allowed to play with our low rank friends?" and also "It wouldn't be fair if the game matched killers based on the best rank in the SWF!"
---
incoming to be sure.
---
Curse these 115 induced delusions
---
Oh yea this is a new ban wave. They implemented new advanced detection methods. It means you probably hacked at some point and they banned you.
---
I really love when people unhook others right in front of me and then use their Exhaustion perk to run away while the other one starts crouch walking away without Urban Evasion. I always say that if you don't want me to "tunnel" give me a reason to. I'm not an "asshole" for "tunneling" - I just hit whoever's closest to me because it's easier.
---
Oh cool she got isekaid
---
Nice to see Pig getting some buffs - still waiting for Plague's existence to be acknowledged by BHVR's balancing department, though. As she stands right now, she's the least fun and least played killer in the game.
---
You can escape with a trap if it's not activated.
---
Just realized I never answered the first part of this question lol. I make them by taking a cool picture of said killer with a defined outline and then bring them into my photo editing software (I use paint.net but you can use whatever you want) then I cut them out of the background and copy them onto the blank background with a layer above them for the logo. then I turn them completely black, smooth out all the edges (this is important because they will look extremely blocky and unappealing after you turn them into a black silhouette so you have to smooth them out) then I add detail lines and blood
---
Facts. At least make the aspect of getting traps out efficiently viable without having to rely on a Ruin carry to start the game
---
They look nice. Let me know if David's butt is one, I may have to order one...
---
Read the achievement description, it's pretty clear.

---
I mean thatd totally make it better. I swear a year or so ago they said they've tried to do something like that but that it caused problems
---
As long as you realise that if they did decide to have at you, you'd probably have to declare everything you've earned and pass it over. But it seems BHVR is busy making games, not suing fans. You should be fine, but you're exposed.
---
don't forget closing hatch is a bannable offense
---
So because of your assumption that shouldn’t of hit then you must be right? That’s not how observing works duder. Lol we didn’t even get to see the actual hit in that video so how can you say it shouldn’t hit? I think your understanding of the lunge and how it hits through the window is what you’re confused about.
---
I don’t mind seeing survivors bring keys into the match or even last second switch because I know they have it but a lot of my killer matches end up with survivors finding a key in a chest (no loot perks) and then 2 or 3 escape when they 3 gen themselves
---
I am also a Meg main. &lt;3 I would love to do a Meg one! But I love the mask, and not sure that would be great for this. :P
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
Thank you so much! Kind of you. :P
---
Theyre under your belly
---
People can't take sarcasm even with the "/s" yikes. Kind of embarrassing to be a part of this community.
---
Agreed. Literally all of his addons are copy-pasted from Hillbilly. The only changed ones were the steering addons (Spiked Boots and Thompson's Moonshine) to "Acceleration" addons (Chili and Award Winning Chili) both of which are either broken or have a barely noticeable effect. Speed addons (Death Engravings and Doom Engravings) were renamed. (Knife Scratches, The Beast's Marks) The best cooldown addon was renamed for lore reasons (The Thompson's Mix was changed out for The Grease) and that's it.
---
Maybe Nea was a stand user? She dresses like one half the time.
---
Idk if on your back but a laminated perk on your person would be pretty cool imo
---
Take a little look at the /s, are you a bit slow?
---
&gt; Its just silly that the game force me to keep facing the people i dominate, not very fun for them.
---
Yeah that's the most confusing thing, they are obviously going to have a bad time if they keep facing that same killer that cannot even rank up.
---
Hah, sounds good. :P
---
Last survivor
---
When did Buttercup get a sex-change?
---
That takes talent and hard work, have you ever seen Mcote?
---
i’m a killer main and half the hits i get shouldn’t hit, maybe lunge does go through windows like that and it’s actually part of the game. but if i play doctor and hit someone that’s not directly near the window where it shouldn’t hit, i get confused because they should have been safe. you can tell from the video how far he was. but i won’t argue
---
17+, rated M.  Ripping a spine out wouldn't be anything crazier than what we've seen from mortal kombat or other games do
---
Ahh, the Tokyo Subway outfit might work! I don't know if I can sully the Lunar outfit with a boobalicious mouse pad. I think I love it too much.
---
It’s not really camping if they know someone is there and they’re patrolling for the person.
---
99% the last gen and hope your last teammate dies. Pop it after they're dead escape by door
---
The thing is that that's what *you* see it as. Killers could see you teabagging in the open and think you're trying to distract or annoy them or a friend doing a funny dance. I try not to read into it either way because there are a lot of different people, but most are gonna latch onto one or the other. You can't control how they see it, unfortunately.
---
Any perk suggestions? I’m having difficulty choosing.
---
Legion, check. Spirit, check:  [https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Spirit-Wallpaper-807711338](https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Spirit-Wallpaper-807711338)

---
Oh yeah dude it’s not like survivors just had the wake up bug or sprint burst exploit. Like tf, survivors are still super powerful with all their insane perks. Killers are getting some minor buffs which is kinda nice,
---
That explains a lot, I thought I was going insane,.
---
Thank you! Kind of surprised it took this long for someone to request some David butt. I thought it would be higher up in the queue. xD
---
&gt;You: I have encountered many swf teams that are not very good so it doesn't make survivors good by default nice try tho  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Me: Being in SWF =/= good by default.
---
Did you even read my comment?? Fuck off with the snarkiness.
---
&gt;Just cause you can communicate doesn't mean you can loop the killer etc.
---
I'm just going to repost what I said because I don't think you even read it: 
---
&gt;***Being in SWF =/= good by default. Again, my issue is with the plethora of information that SWF can share amongst itself, which this game simply wasn't designed for.***
---
I addressed that exact point before.
---
&gt;No matter what you add to this game, players will always have voice chat. No matter what type of game, there is chat options.
---
Sigh.
---
&gt;And you're completely disregarding ***how this is a particular type of game***, regardless of "online gaming", and the information SWF is privy to. This is meant to be a sort of hide-and-seek/tag hybrid, where survivors are meant to try to survive without being able to communicate. SWF have access to: where the killer is, where the other survivors are, where a health kit/toolbox/hex totem/door/trap/pallet/camper/etc. is, and all they have to do is ask and tell each other. This can happen at any time. In a game like this, **where half the game is the uncertainty of what's going on around you**, that's broken as fuck.
---
Please actually read my comment before replying to it. I hate having to repeat myself.
---
Mind you the old hatch spawn rules might be ok too.
---
I understand. Thank you for the warning, and the concern.
---
Did it with the spirit too, and went even more minimalist:  [https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Spirit-Wallpaper-807711338](https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Spirit-Wallpaper-807711338)
---
You’re killing me smalls. If that is true then your connection is either bad/choppy or you really don’t understand how hits work. If no one else see’s this like you do maybe everyone else isn’t the problem.
---
Yeah haha, it is but I didn't bring up the other ones I had problems with because I thought i was writing too much and it was like 3am 🤣
---
That's a magnitude 10 bruh moment
---
The Pig was like “Come’ere ya bast... hold up, my man died further from the gate?”
---
I normally wait at least 5 minutes
---
Die, die, die, die, die, die
---
No mither does get you the trophy. I almost exclusively used no mither and some other perks and got it no problem
---
They are COMPLETE idiots and I'm gonna explain you why.
---
Things the game needs:
---
Hitboxes fix
---
Dedicated servers
---
Nurse addon rework
---
Spirit nerf
---
Noed rework or nerf
---
Leatherface rework
---
Doctor rework
---
And many many other balance issues.
---
Things they focused on:
---
Adding new killers
---
Skins.
---
RIDICULOUS
---
And in a way that's something an ill intentionned person could do. Purposely "dominate" low level games by getting quick 4K at low ranks but never actually rank up lol (for example, slug them all and let them bleed).
---
The only mindgame the Spirit does is standing still to pretend you are phasing. Other than that all you have to do is just phase walk through scratch marks until you bump on the survivor's hitbox
---
To be clear, though, I'm totally fine with the bait type. it keeps killers from having too much map pressure or switching targets unpredictably
---
should do like 4 small patches and attach then to one of the shoulders so to speak. I would do his 3 + NOED
---
Dead hard doesn't counter exposed because they'll still heal. If you're chasing an already injured person while you're in tier 3/they're marked (why you would mark an already injured person I don't know) then yes, dead hard can work against you, however, they need to be INJURED to use dead hard, and so exposed will usually trump dead hard because it's purpose is putting a healthy survivor down in one hit (do your research). 
---
What else does plague have? The ability to find survivors slightly easier? If they don't cleanse, you don't have your ranged attack, all you can do is infect them and your ability is nonexistent, broken doesn't stall, it just keeps them injured. And dead hard at red ranks is EXTREMELY common, most people are running it at those ranks. A killer will eventually catch a survivor, but it's a time trial. If you're being ran around, gens are getting progressed, you're losing more and more the longer it takes for you to down someone. "Eventually youll get them", yeah, after 3 gens because the survivor is actually good.
---
THEN YOURE WRONG! 😜
---
You could say she... bit the dust.
---
I've had no less than three traps go off like this in the past week. I think people read how inactive traps don't go off anymore and think all traps don't go off.
---
my entire friend group complains about it and i’ve seen some other people in this sub complain about it, and my connection isn’t the issue. it’s not so much i have a major issue with it but it’s hella annoying to get hit through a window when you shouldn’t have and makes the game not fun
---
Good idea
---
&gt;Hitboxes fix Dedicated servers
---
Dedicated servers are coming. That will resolve most hitbox issues
---
&gt;Nurse addon rework
---
I don't think nurse *needs* an add on rework, but I wouldn't complain. 
---
&gt;Spirit nerf
---
Haha, no. Killers are supposed to be able to kill survivors, that's how the game is supposed to work. Maybe there's an argument against prayer beads but most killers have one really strong add on. 
---
&gt;Noed rework or nerf
---
Would be good but isn't *needed.* NOED is really cheap and annoying but fairly easily countered. 
---
&gt;Leatherface rework Doctor rework
---
Both fair, although Doctor is more in need of a buff than rework. 
---
&gt;Things they focused on: Adding new killers Skins.
---
Things they actually focused on: Freddy rework, Badham rework, Legion rework, fixing Decisive Strike, breaking the game with Mettle of Man, fixing Mettle of Man. New skins are an easy way to generate money without needing to produce genuine content. They're not something I buy but it's good for the game to have more income and if it makes some players happy to customise their character more then good for them.
---
Also I like how you spelled against like it was a contraction
---
Well, it's not about players count, it's about ratio. And that's exactly what OP implied - when it's becoming less and less fun to play survivor, you get progressively longer queues.
---
I did it! I activated Bites za Dusto!!!!!
---
Personally am not a fan of the whole Killers having a near perfect game and then get unlucky because hatch spawn next to last survivor, which cause depipping.
---
What else could left behind do then?
---
Can't i say the bad things of a game i enjoy playing? Or i only have to shut up and be a good dog because i play it? I play a game with a lot of lacks, and i have no problems to list those. That game could be a lot better if smarter devs were responsible for it. Anyway, I'm not only talking. I'm not buying a single skin till this game becomes good, and i find ridicoulus that people do. Why in the world would you reward devs for making skin instead of fixing their game?
---
Absolutely. At 1000 bps a totem, bye bye noed
---
As an Eagle Scout myself, very cool to see all this.
---
Nice to see a fellow scout :)  
---
I think the skull, bow and arrows, and hook represent the killer objectives brutality, hunter, and sacrifice respectively. The pint in the bottom left is probably a nod to Thompson's moonshine, cooking because Thompson farm is a cattle farm, and I'm not too sure about the bottom right, but it kinda looks like the entity's tendrils.
---
I need some representation of ma boi
---
Well when they tell you to find the hatch cause killer is camping what am I supposed to do?
---
yeah i had a look at ohtofu’s ‘how to carry the team’ type video and even though ive been playing for a over year, i still picked some stuff up so i’ll definitely have a look at more of those! this is way more than i could have hoped for my dude, and its very much appreciated!
---
So this is why I just got 8.6gb update?
---
Are the skins free?
---
The Pimp rank error, duh
---
The Doctors pimp rank is far too high considering The Hag has the literal ability to perform the pimp slap. This needs to be fixed.
---
Thank you so much! I played against Freddy for the first time last night and had so many questions this post just answered.
---
Sea of Thieves community: We see your salt and raise you double.....
---
I remember trashing my “hit four surv with hatchets daily” to get “mori a surv with the huntress”
---
Do you have any of the teachables?
---
Its literally 60 seconds, this will almost never happen
---
Lol I'm surprised your teammates didn't just assume you were sandbagging and start sandbagging you.
---
I’d actually find bikini survivors hilarious. The only time I hate sexualizing female characters is when it’s spirit... cause she’s literally underage. And ya know, dead. 
---
I’ve also just noticed for the most part l, sexualizing male characters is like, omg shirtless Meyers, omg shirtless David. And then you have spirit and it’s like goddamn look at her ass I’d totally fuck her. It usually just gets taken further with female characters. (Ignoring DBDgonewild, we don’t talk about that place)
---
Ur teammates are trash
---
I was not wrong.
---
The Obsession is not really an indicator for DS, there are more Obsession perks in the game than just DS. People will just always assume its DS no matter wether it was a Killer Perk or Survivor Perk that caused it. 
---
Though to be fair, none of the other Survivor perks that cause Obsession are any good.
---
John Cena skin pants
---
But what about the pips
---
The person probably got a brutal killer or a low ruthless
---
If I lost the match I don't like to receive a GG either. It sounds passive aggressive.
---
To me it's baiting them so you can take a hit to relieve pressure from teammates
---
So we back in the baby
---
Just one of many Diavolo deaths
---
You must be a very large advocate agaisnt NOED then
---
I can totally see some people thinking that but sadly with teabaggings track record it's not exactly friendly to do, that's what the end game lobby is for
---
fuck dude, i havent been running this at all. i gotta go uninstall brb
---
When is wraith gonnabe done (asking for a friend)
---
It looks great, though Kate is missing a half moon tattoo on her chest
---
Darn, was hoping for boobalicious Clown and Bubba
---
Nope, the person will be healed or use unbreakable way before 1 mimute has passed, and he will go out of the locker when you leave him. If you only see scratchmarkd after the unhook and it turns out the be the unhooked then you've lost the unhooker if they're even remotely smart.
---
Patch notes.
---
I want one with David's muscly tits please
---
Do you already have 4 stacks?
---
I'm with you! I have to down 3 survivors for my daily, but I'm total ass with Leatherface. I killed 3, but couldn't connect with my chainsaw. Any pointers??????
---
Thanks. I left it doing that, just wondered if it was a thing or I just got lucky.
---
Yes. I see people complain about the glitch on every dbd livestream I watch too
---
Oh, yeah that makes more sense.
---
Bug fixes and adding Bill to PS4
---
When did I say I use moris lol
---
Omg it soooooo randem!!!1
---
The original Left 4 Dead was but Valve took it over
---
We aren't asking for naked, we need SHIRTLESS
---
They are adding lasers so u can stop killers more easily
---
Ok I guess it's something new then and I was lucky enough to avoid it yet
---
well, I havent Seen any changes that would make Survivor any harder, less fun, in fact they made gaining BP and pips as Survivor much easier and changes like the DS Change made sure that you dont accidentily waste it before your first hook.
---
I actually became somewhat of a Survivor Main, after Mailing Killers for around 2 years
---
I think that's due to the emblem system which, must say, i find ridicoulus. When the game reward different action up to a max, and you must do it all for pipping, it creates a new gamestyle:playing for the pip. It is different from playing for the escape, because people focus on doing everything they need to get points, and not everything they need to escape. like running in mass to save the hooked person, and other stupid things like that. I think that the original pip system was the best, they only needed to increase the minimum bp to pip. Something like that: 16k safety; 20k pip; 26k double pip. And maybe to add some pepper a new rule: if you get less than 8k you lose 2 pips.
---
Myers being second best? Id disagree. Corrupt plague would take two vomits to knock down a lot of survs since it pierces
---
this is what I use all my shards on, speed that grind up a little bit if possible.

You're getting mad at not being able to tunnel someone?  Sigh, no winning. Cant even imagine what you would have said about the old DS. Which was actually broken. Compared to this new one which is balanced.
---
darn, i wanted to throw some gu mines
---
Damn! I love it without the text! I do think that it suits the wallpaper format better when it's less minimalistic. I actually dug the style around the edges. With all the branches and stuff. Made it extra atmospheric.
---
Awww how fab is my hubby!!! 😍

If you're standing there watching your teammate get camped, you're actively harming your entire team.

Are you really telling me I have to actually explain the joke behind this???

Being the killer is hard

Salty Killer: DO US A FAVOR AND KILL YOURSELF
---
Survivor: Well that was your job and you failed =/
---
Ok that was funny  lol
---
Thank you so much for your awesome work!
---
That's a perk, not a penalty.
---
Feels bad man
---
Welcome to the internet
---
It happened to me before and I solved it by running back through the gate. However, this week this happened and I was the killer and the Bill tried to come back and leave but it didn't work and he got sacrificed when the timer ended... It's a pretty weird bug.
---
nice! been waiting for a really nice looking icon pack to come along, and i think this is the one
---
This madlad just asked for a 1v1 in dead by daylight
---
E
---
Where are the patch notes?
---
Yea i'm so hyped. I heard his lasers stuns the killer for 5 seconds.
---
Nope. For the hatch to spawn the amount of gens completed has to be one more than the amount of survivors left. To open it you need a key or to be the last survivor.
---
No one cares about BNP anymore. No one cares about flashlights anymore unless you just spam click to be annoying. No one cares about DS anymore. No one cares about BT anymore. No one says not to loop, no one says not to emote unless you're spamming them to be annoying, no one says not to crouch unless you're teabagging to be annoying. No one cares about exhaustion perks. Again no one says not to loop. The only annoyance are SWF, insta heals and being toxic.
---
Regular Myers: *runs away*

and free apparently

**BAOW**
---
Wraith is the general easy killer. He is really good at finding people and you can always get that first hit with him. He’s not a great killer compared to the rest, but he’s straight forward and makes you learn how to get better at shutting down loops.
---
Hillbilly is also good. Even if you are scared of missing chainsaws, just playing him as an M1 killer that also gets to speed around the map puts him better than half the cast and keeps his gameplay basic.
---
That’s what happens when you miss decisive strike.
---
Its for the locker.... its dark inside.
---
"As the last person alive, activate the last generator and escape through the exit gate."
---
It's pretty clear that you can't work on a generator when you're the last survivor alive because once that happens end game collapse starts and the entity closes off all the generators. 
---
So does it just mean exit thru the gates ? And ignore the part about activating the last gen?

if it makes you feel better in my first game ever as a newbaby killer, i got matched up against similar people. Mind you i was rank 20
---
Secretly it's a feature bhvr added in. If you crouch more than 20 times while endgame is active, you are denied the escape.
---
Lol I was just thinking this. You can technically react to head on with M1 but it's pretty difficult
---
Tomorrow
---
1 hook event with no gatekeeper medal? That's a clean depip now.
---
Is the "so they can balance their game out" part that i didn't understand
---
You know you the entity has a sense of humor when you're ran over by a ambulance.
---
Amanda: "Get back he... holy fuck it works?!"
---
They gotta nerf his generator fixing skills though. He does it in like 5 seconds
---
Ah I see another big boi pants dwight. Such culture you have
---
Honestly, it changes for me.  Sometimes it's a long wait for one and I'll switch to the other only to immediately find a lobby.
---
I answer the same usually but it's clearly sarcasm when I do it.
---
I’m just curious, when is shirtless mike coming??
---
yay im stuck in rank 14 since the plaaag
---
If you don’t have any other teachables, all 3 of her perks are great (although Q&amp;Q is more predictable when you’re playing Meg). The good non teachable perks include We’ll Make It, Kindred, Spine Chill, and Dark Sense. Not only are these perks good, but they all have their strongest part of their effect already at level 1
---
I would agree with that, the current system actually encourages farming other people for points from the survivor's side, and just playing inefficiently from the killer's side.
---
This seems way off. It costs around 1.2-1.5 million BP to get to Lv 50 if you spend smartly. So 4-5 million is what it would be.
---
(Unless by all perks you mean literally every single perk for one character)
---
Fuckin amazing
---
That could be cool. Doubt PlayStation would want to do that but nice reminder of fitting characters
---
Fix what's wrong with it, it's not balanced right now. Every killer should be viable at every rank not just three. Hitboxes are jank and every single good thing in this game has an equal or worse debuff to "balance" but that's not what we need in the field of balance
---
Not technically useless as it helps do the achievement that involves doing the last generator by yourself(everyone dead) and leave through the exit gates
---
Pumped for our Oinkness
---
&gt; Also red/purple rank ques are brutal on Killer.
---
[Christmas](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cetufe/santa_clown_is_my_favorite_killer_cosmetic_so_i/).
---
On the brightside its no longer available in my bloodweb bc Bill came to consoles and we have to to unlock them, and you can bet Im leaving that one out.
---
Horoscopes are quite actually bs.
---
People like you make Xbox live suck now.
---
&gt; but wouldn't you get more bp just walking around and slapping everyone while they finish gens, and letting them escape?
---
Like tremendously more bp
---
Playing to get 3 hooks on all survivors for some reason has made playing killer a lot easier- inadvertedly playing the "point gathering way" happens to lay on tremendous pressure
---
Cus i play killer
---
I know what I’m asking Santa for now 😏
---
But if the killer closes the hatch (which they most likely will do instead of allowing you to repair every gen) you can't do it
---
Maybe see a therapist?
---
As you guys might have been able to predict, i believe Killer A is the better Killer by far, which is just further proof the Nurse is OP and Trapper needs a buff :P
---
Oh piggy? 🐷 I got you :) https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Pig-Wallpaper-761521329
---
Oh yeah, It used to first spear you through the abdomen, the twist the bodies in half basically then drive a spike straight through the head. It's more watered down now though
---
Imagine having a beachside map? That'd be cool
---
Trappown or...Clapper
---
Lagswitch
---
But how often are you gonna be able to complete a gen before the killer closes the hatch
---
You don't have to hide it, I like wraith too, and I already did him :) https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Wraith-Wallpaper-761379236
---
Didn't you hear? Survivors have to stand in a straight line while the Killers uses their powers
---
Had a dying survivor taunting me at the edge of the gate.  They fucked up and didn't exit in time. They got sacrificed
---
Worth the $60??
---
Shit. In that case how do you ever even hook a survivor with this?
---
Whaaaaaaat you rock man
---
I just had the worst match ever. 4 man SWF, 3/4 has an insta heal (one had syptic agent) and on the new Badham map. Pure gen rushed and the match lasted about 4-7 minutes. Wasn’t even fun to chase let alone hook one of them which got off and as I downed another they got insta healed.
---
What the fuck.
---
MOVE BITCH GET OUT THE WAY
---
You whine that much and get angry so quick and easy?
---
They have never discussed and every new platform they release the game on does not have cross progression, so I would say no.
---
It takes 2 mins its not bad at all
---
A teammate just got one hit killed/executed by Michael Meyers. 15 seconds later he grabbed me as I vaulted and did the same. Is this a new feature from the update?
---
That's acceptable if it's an actual camper or tunneler. These other clowns in this thread just do it to be a cunt.
---
I'm scared
---
Yes, this is definitely not supposed to happen
---
unfortunately you are gonna get downvoted by all of the survivor mains just because you said something that's true.
---
Nurse, still, by far. The having the tools of both the Trapper and the Clown would be cool, but the killer would still have the weaknesses of both, that being setup time and lack of map control. They would still need to participate in normal chases like most other killers. The Nurse would still have better mobility, better map pressure, *and* would still be better in a chase.
---
The 1st Wrong Turn was decent....then it really just goes down hill from there.
---
She's second best if the survivors aren't well organised and let themselves get downed. Myers should be able to down a small group and guard them. 
---
They'll be no hooks on the map because the toolbox survivors will devour them like termites. All the generators will be completed at once, except the ones that only 2 or 3 can work on.
---
r/saltyboys
---
Faking window vaults should also count imo
---
no so perk is rarely used by solos in term of statistic. In Higher rank you don't necessarily need it anyway to understand that the killer is camping. It helps but it's not awesome.
---
Thats the tombstone addon. I believe when youre in tier 3 you can kill people like a mori
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Judith%27s_Tombstone
---
Ebony mori, noed, rancor, devour hope, and make your choice camping is effective. You want that to happen to you? I bet your pussy ass would disconnect. Again, play killer and get out of your bubble its pathetic.
---
Neas must be exterminated zubMAD
---

---
Clapper is nice lol
---
I would like to know as well. There's so little info here.
---
mystery box
---
Yea I agree with you.
---
One small thing in addition to what the other guy said, Michael Myers has a shorter lunge in tier 1, normal lunge in tier 2, and longer lunge in tier 3. Besides that, every killer has the exact same lunge distance
---
hope you dont get the teddy bear bro good luck
---
Duuuuuude!
---
so you wrote all this just to describe how lazy you are? Look, you could have just said so and we would have understood.
---
I know but it's still not completely worthleds it as it helps with that one achievement
---
Sony likes this post
---
I probably play killer more then you do kid. I I also love the superiority complex that you have, that somehow playing killer makes you better than the rest of the community. As if you're special or unique. You're just another generic entitled killer.
---
I guess
---
Look, the game has only been out for 3 years. You need to keep your expectations reasonable here, averaging 4 numbers is *hard* for such a small indie company!
---
I have rarely seen this tactic being used, I don't even understand why you're acting as if its sooo hard to get hits and kills in this game. It literally isn't you have to loop survivors correctly so you don't give them extra vaults.
---
No there are no tools to save someone from being facecamped so I don't even know where you have got this idea from. Also everyone can facecamp.
---
I know but I'm just saying it's not completely useless if you're a achievement hunter
---
More attentive players will actually start throwing pallets earlier without intending to stun to waste Spirit Fury. What I run into a lot is getting more mileage out of Brutal Strength and just using Enduring for the safe pallets.
---
Unlimited. Ain’t that a bit OP???
---
I  was talking more along the lines of the first chase you get into at the very start of the match there's always that 1 dude who gets found first, wastes every pallet then screams to his friends about how the killer is "tunneling" him. Like nah homie.  Gimme those pallets in the first 20 seconds of a match, lemme get them chase points too. After all the safe pallets and shack pallet is gone down the noob then out of no where his while team is on you with flashlights. Meanwhile they were also looking for ruin instead of doing gens and more than half the pallets in the map is gone already. Sometimes I don't understand survivors or what their thought process is in situations like that. 
---
But yeah I get what you're saying too. I main pig when I play killer and I get dumb cry babies all the time. I crouch immediately after I hook someone on small maps and start gen patrolling. They go jump the hook like some flies found a fresh pile of shit then say you're camping. Um, I literally just turned around to go towards a gen but here we are not even a full second later. I just play the game idgaf what people say and haven't for the past year. Every week there's a new "rule" to follow and I ain't got time to keep up with that shit.
---
Are you old enough to play this game ?
---
I turned off my messages. Only friends can bc of dbd and Smite too.
---
Yeah it is, but thats how they get your money. Another way to get it is to wait until it's available on the marketplace, where it will instantly become purchasable and teachable. However this is pretty much luck of the draw.
---
How good is ghostboi as a killer? Where does he rank among the other DLC killers?
---
I really want Nathan Drake. He'd be my new favorite, that or Lara Croft
---
Protection hits in general are pretty buggy, but you have to get hit, basically by being right on their ass, and only while they are injured. If you take a hit and the other person is at full health, it won’t count.
---
The best way to guarantee a protection hit is taking a hit while the killer is carrying them on their shoulder, this gives a stack 100% of the time.
---
As coool as he'd be we don't need another adaptational wimp. DBD has too many. Joel doesn't deserve this.
---
New Killer: Ambulance
---
Killer Passive: Move Bitch Get Out The Way
---
- Can literally drive around the map at —% movement speed.
---
Killer Perks:
---
- To the Rescue!
---
The ambulance has the ability to Mori at least one survivor per match. Activation is instantaneous, just have to run over survivor.
---
- WEEWOO
---
The noise of the siren sends all survivors into a running state trying to get away. Scratch marks are visible. Does not work if they are standing still/working on a generator. —/—/— second cooldown.
---
- Get in the Back
---
Survivors who are captured by the ambulance will lose an automatic 5000 BP in hospital bills to pay for transportation.
---
I imagine we'll get those, plus the Trapper &amp; Hillbilly skins, tomorrow.
---
1. What are these add ons?
---
2. The dude is using a splinter. There is nothing to cry over here. I’m a Killer main and this just shows skill.
---
I don’t rate him that high, against a good team you will struggle to get survivors exposed because of how way it is to detect him and once they are exposed you need to catch them but will probably get looped to death. He’s probably good at low ranks tho like every killer
---
Lol. Its a shitpost
---
The only thing I ever care about in DBD is having fun and getting that sweet, sweet BP.
---
You fool, MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!
---
Lmao and I thought 3 protection hits with MoM was ridiculous
---
If you miss your decisive that means you were hooked already so he cant deliverance
---
Pig buff?
---
I did it! It activated!
---
Mines pretty spot on weirdly enough
---
Simple, you dont
---
So Evil Dead Ash Williams is a wimp?
---
Fuck yeah I would
---
Why? Because I report people for sending offensive messages?
---
What about Mommy Huntress, tho?
---
Amanda is adorable with those stun sounds.
---
It did need the nerf honestly
---
Understandable
---
They’re really just always pretty vague any description can fit anyone else really. 
---
Also horoscopes are usually told from signs in the sky now it has nothing to do with that and it’s just months.
---
This deserves more upvotes
---
Clowns is just Lightborn on steroids
---
Its hard to even injure them
---
Yeah, it'd be fucked but I honest to god thought that it is like that. Spent the whole time waking up in a match against him because I thought that he can see me lol
---
I want the perk meta to be more diverse.
---
You have ruin, NOED and BBQ plus whatever else depending in the killer. I want it where most if not all perks can be meta.
---
Bill mains are notorious for hiding in lockers. Main someone else LOL
---
hes ei beksing rul 7 , uo stoopi ked
---
Why is it disgusting? That’s the way the game is played. It’s not always tunneling. BTW, I play both survivor and killer. Not really good at either though, but I have fun playing and don’t take it personal. If tunneling wasn’t allowed they would make a rule about it. They released an update where you lose points if you camp, so I’m sure there is a penalty for tunneling though. Maybe not.
---
Finally someone said it. I find the whole idea of shirtless Myers annoying now.
---
Console players didn’t get anything for free, we only have access to the special edition which has a higher base price than the PC’s standard edition.

The amount of gens scales with the amount of survs so there's a lot more gens on the map (which also limits the amount of space they have to move) and will make it harder for them to complete it, especially without the killer interrupting.

niiiice
---
I’m a survivor and killer main as well and I never go after the same person I just hooked it’s unfun to go against like yes I just got off the hook now let me instantly run away from the killer again it’s really annoying tbh
---
One time a Claudette messaged me like that and I replied nicely as well (playing as survivor). They were in my next match and I played normal, still saved her from hooks, etc; she then messaged me talking shit about the killer and tried to add me as a friend and play more matches together. Hard pass- I dont get why some players get so emotional over a game lol
---
Isn’t it a bit weird that Quentin is the only boy?
---
what I meant by that isnt that survivors lag switch, its that microsoft litterally designed their servers to be laggier than playing overwatch on a calculator.
---
Mid - upper mid tier. Definitely worth playing if you like the play style
---
Endgame Threat &gt; Endgame Meme
---
This is pretty fucking sad.
---
I’ve been tunneled so many times, it’s not funny. I hear you though. I’ve tunneled too, but that usually only happens when I’m right by them if someone is stupid enough to take them off the hook right by me. Do you play with a team?
---
The Elm Streets.
---
End game collapse does not automatically trigger when only one survivor is left, it will however trigger if the killer finds and closes the hatch. This trophy will probably be very tricky to get, but not impossible if we are lucky.
---
I guess I can agree
---
He'll yeah. I would lick shirtless myers
---
You say that, and yet I get complaints about that every other game and every other thread. It's almost as if you're biased!
---
Yeah I'm a cartoonist so I'll work on that
---
That's the point. If a spirit is so unsure about his abilities, how am I supposed to know, as a survivor, that he has noed? I faced a spiri who did 4/4 instead of 1/4 because of noed. Was that my fault? Because didn't cleanse totems against a frickin SPIRIT? I don't think so.
---
Just start when youre closer. Dont chainsaw by jungle gyms, run bamboozle so they cant get back through the window (even if they run through the window just walk right up to it and your chainsaw can literally stick through it to down them. Dont face camp but dont go far from the hook.
---
Amulet
---
When there's an injured survivor who just got unhooked and a healthy survivor, I'm going to go for the injured survivor... why make my game purposely harder?
---
Its a nice perk but if you or the guy goes down (or hooked, cant remember) then you lose the effect.
---
She gonna be even more busted now
---
Complaining about how scumbags like buying the game is why the game is shit. I’m not gonna lie i only bought freddy for fire up, leatherface for bbq, ash cause why not and the rest of my auric cells went into getting a cosmetic for jake
---
This is very impressive! But do you think you capfuls do one of The Wraith?
---
thank you &lt;3333
---
Thank you. My followup question for people is, what add-ons do you suggest to pair with a pallet add-on? The primary effect of them don't stack (as funny as it would be to have 20 dream pallets) so they're not worth stacking.
---
ITS TIME FOR YOUR TREATMENT, BITCH!
---
So evil it gets you downvoted
---
Really? I see many "both sides" streamers do it when they play a killer, because they're not that good as killer main streamers to let clutch saves happen.
---
Where did I say it's hard? Only thing I said it's easy to say things like that. What I WAS saying that there is a reason behind why people facecamp. And sometimes it's because killer gave up on everything else already. Funny that people talk a lot about "what killer should hae done" when he resorted to bad tactic because everything else've failed already. Yes, they probably know that's it's a shit tactic, but they still resort to it. Maybe they're mad, maybe they're desperate, and often they're just meming/can't be bothered to try too hard (if they facecamp the first person they find with a lot of gens still down).
---
Right, get in to a facecamped surv with BT, give him BT. Here, now he have to facecamp another person for another 2.5 minutes, or initiate a chase after unhooked person for at least 15 seconds or give him a boost. Be sure to not get grabbed. Doesn't work with one shot killers. If you're against insidious play, there you can't do anything, and you're not supposed to. That's the purpose of the build, you just have suck it up, but it's not about facecamping at this point. If there is stealth killers, reveal them or force unreveal before giving BT. If it's not a first hook, be sure to get a DS charge in case you gonna be facecamped. Teamwork also works. "My teammates are potatoes" isn't an explanation. Sounds hard? Well, it's easy to say, isn't it?

Its wrong to design a character around there add-ons the nurse is good without add ons same without billy the problem is with is ability its for downing multiple people at once and when ever dose that happen? Plus as its boring to play

Wait, survivors had first person moris and they removed it?
---
Haha well it's awesome at any rate. I like it
---
I got reported for face camping but here’s contest:
---
Only two survivors left, already one dude is hooked (Claudette). David goes in to save her but is smart enough to know that killers can interrupt unhooking. This goes on for a bit until he tries taunting me with emotes. 
---
I hit him once and he managed to unhook  her but I downed Claud again and went after him and hooked them both.
---
But no I’m the bad guy for trying to play smart and interrupt hook saves.
---
What do tokens do again in save the best for last
---
This is adorable! I'd love to see more killers
---
You can actually upload multiple pictures in a text post! At least I’ve done that before on my MacBook.
---
My favorite is that he let you know he is done with the game atm, and “going to watch Netflix”
---
Yeah...no
---
How about different color....?
---
You ain't wrong
---
Good stuff!
---
eep!
---
yeah just upload to imgur as an album
---
Thanks for your input
---
No prob
---
lol as if that really makes a difference when most can agree Billy and Nurse are top 5? this is the worst excuse ive seen get thrown at a killer
---
What are the best/most fun DLC killers to play as?
---
My buddies are getting back into this game and I was thinking of starting the game with a beautiful DLC purchase.
---
Just Curious .
---
Yeah as I said he only good for camping. I don’t think removing the stun when bumping is a good idea because you have to have a penalty for missing
---
dude your amazing. this makes me so uncomfortable. like a flesh spider
---
And I’ve gotten easy double pips with him in the past pre-rework
---
Good luck grinding the blood webs after unlocking...
---
I've spent over 20 hours recently trying to get Nea's perks on my claudette, and I haven't seen a single one.  The majority of all the other perks are mac rank now.  I've reached the point that I expect disappointment when I see a new web now.
---
I mean you have to compensate for his lack of mobility when compared to Billy. On paper, its supposed to be "easier to hit his chainsaw", but i feel like its the opposite. A good survivor can essentially juke you with a simple tree. Can't do that to my Billy.
---
Im sorry for salt OP. I did die laughing at the Pay to win comment.
---
Dead hard is a survivor perk, not a killer perk.
---
top 3 lmao. nurse is top tier
---
Wait are you that survivor?
---
No we need an interactive ability that what makes a game fun like Fredy for example with his new snares and fake pallets
---
Welp rip
---
That's what I thought but I didn't want to say anything
---
No. Not at all im at work right now. I just hate seeing freddy hate. Im a freddy main

I think they understood the sarcasm, but then the comment in question literally boils down to “I understood the post”, you know?

You called them idiots. As if they’re incompetent, even though you don’t realise the amount of effort they’ve put in as well as the time and money it takes to do these changes. But no, you’re correct of course. Idm complaints, they’re inevitable, but being an ass about it doesn’t help anyone. You can criticise them but don’t be a dick
---
we may not get shirtless myers but you are getting a downvote from me
---
And Smite
---
I thought about writing "porn" on the tape but that would be too on the nose - I figured real clown players would get it.
---
I used to run Unnerving, Overcharge, Distressing, and BBQ on my Doc. 
---
Granted Doc isn't the strongest killer but at higher ranks you can 3-gen to stall for time if worst comes to worst. I don't know if it's worth doing a hour long match and get max BP vs quick match and getting half points as you can do multiple matches in the timespan it'd take to get a 3-gen doc game ended.
---
1v1 in dbd. Bruhhh
---
You should make a hex totem
---
I kinda hate that
---
I'm rank 3/4 and I've played against rank 18/19 killers.. but that's only because my friends are horrible and can't get past rank 18..
---
Repost
---
Agreed. A buff to his chainsaw startup time and a buff to his add-ons would definitely make him more relevant. I don't even know how you'd rework someone like Leatherface, tbh
---
Only BBQ helps you with BP (it multiplies what you have at the end of the game), the rest only increase the speed at which you gain BP but the cap will be 8000BP. The best killers for farming are doctor and legion.
---
I’ve considered it, but I have no idea how to yet.
---
Honestly this answer. He's got way more cool mental shit going for him than ANY of the others.
---
There are only 65(195 bloodwebs worth of) survivor perks in the entire game, so to miss deliverance for 140 bloodwebs without all teachables unlocked is impressively unlucky, but possible.
---
No it doesn't. Being chased and hooked are parts of the game. Being hooked is a less interactive part, but it's definitely part. Being stuck on the hook without rescue is a real possibility that people need to just accept. Sure, it sucks being the person stuck on the hook, but that's the price you pay for getting downed. Sometimes it's gonna just happen, and you can either be better in chases and get your teammates enough time to do gens, or you can whine and complain about it.
---
Tbh I never found Doctor to be that annoying. I always hated fighting characters like Nurse, Spirit, Leatherface, and Ghostface more than Doctor. I don't know why
---
I thought those were dicks
---
Haha I'll try it, thank you.
---
It's even better when you aren't the Obsession so the Killer assumes he can pick you up without issues because the Obsession icon is bugged.
---
😂
---
Just an FYI, Call of Duty always had dedicated servers on PC since BO2 and shortly after that used them for consoles too.
---
Michael: "Everybooooody!"
---
Freddy, Leatherface, Doctor, and Billy: "Yeeeeeeeee-ah!"
---
They aren't new lol
---
Doesn't she have a mindset of a child? I heard someone say so anyway
---
You don't know that
---
There really bugged. You pretty much have to be hugging the other survivors ass cheeks for it to work.
---
Nah I'm happy as heck. I love Bill lol.
---
When two of the top three killers are unlocked for everyone right off the bat.
---
I thought the corn already did move when characters were in it? I distinctly remember it bending. 
---
Did they remove that or something?
---
This is sad
---
What parameters make it spawn?
---
Leatherface is just all kinds of wrong. Hes a terrible killer but his kit is basically designed to encourage face camping with insidious which is a toxic (and bad) way to play the game. 9/10 times I run into Leatherface he pulls this. I don't even bother trying to save if I hear a chainsaw and find its not Hillbilly. I just rush gens and leave. Sometimes the leatherface ends up getting 2nd least amount of bloodpoints when the team agrees and just leaves. Sucks for the hook victim but literally nothing you can do if a leatherface is hellbent on camping.
---
I'll just assume this is a joke
---
Thank you we have seen this before for years
---
If it hadn't been for Sharp Hand Joe,
---
I'd been alive a long time ago.
---
No Mither is literally better.
---
Poor bill.
---
I don’t know if i told y’all this but the survivors especially mr/ms complainsalot here put no effort in surviving
---
I like the shinyness of it. Nice!
---
Yeah, they added it with the endgame collapse update. You can still open it back up with a key though
---
Funny, her name was angel lol
---
They are to console players.
---
The hillbilly picked me up and I was able to get the wiggle bar to full but I could jump off him for some reason. He literally held me for the entire game.
---
He just has his shirt off and is completely ripped. But that's not sexualizing
---
Your trap will go of if you try to go thru a exit gate
---
Insidious is like leatherface in a way, its an awful perk that just promotes toxic camping. Like I get it, its supposed to be a horror game and a killer jump scaring you with an ambush without a terror radius sounds like it fits. But given how the game is generally played and how killers need to patrol to be effective its just a tool for facecamp trolling.
---
Thanks for linking it to me 👌
---
I hope you said you bought him when he was trash.

I gotchu

No that’s the whole text he never answered after i told i got freddy pre-rowork

Is this a isekai?
---
"There can be no *fun*in this hell, no *fun*at all."
---
Hag is very good, but her power has a ton of counterplay for coordinated teams.
---
Not 10/10, since that's Nurse tier.
---
Not 9/10, since that's Billy and Spirit.
---
8/10 is Huntress/Hag level.
---
Oh, what about -
---
# lost count of how many rules....but don't leave the game if your teammates are hanging on the hook and the gates have opened....sure I want the points but be a good sport...especially if the hook is beside a literal gate.
---
How
---
Nice!
---
Cool a Pewdiepie skin
---
The other perks help you, but they only give bonuses in game. Meaning that after 8000 points, you can no longer gain more. So distressing would help you reach the maximum, but you will never go over. Bbq, on the other hand, increase your bp gain, out of game. So that is why it is so beneficial for grinding. A perfect game can net you 32000 + 32000 + 32000 for the game + bbq + survicor pudding. Hope this clears it up for you.
---
Sadly the majority of people just assume it's malicious which is quite annoying really
---
Woohoo!! Goddamn it tho I got no bloodpoints haha. Either way excited to finally play as that smoking chimney!!
---
At my rank I just seek it out and cleanse it because no one else even tries to do gens until its dead. Like I've fought through ruin before to get a gen done so I know its possible, its just my teammates don't even try if its up.
---
BBQ is the obvious must have perk, but I think people make a common mistake when farming bloodpoints: slowing the game down. If you just want bloodpoints and don't mind letting a lot of survivors escape, focus on a fast build that makes the most of quick matches. After all, I'd rather make 20k in 5 mins than 30k in 10 because I can get into the next match faster. That's why I've stopped running Ruin and started using Discordance a bit. Discordance slows the game by helping me find survivors who I get points from. Balancing the speed of the match and your points is vital to maximizing your bloodpoints over time. Focus on perks that help your power, end the chase faster, and help you pressure the speed of the match when you want. An example is Legion with Sloppy Butcher and Save the Best for Last. Excellent power synergy that slows the game a *bit* and helps with the chase. Slap on BBQ and you have one of the best bloodpoint killers and fast matches.
---
Maybe because with the killers that came out it hasn’t fit the theme of them at all.

I've never liked the shirtless Myers meme it just seemed spammed way to much making it feel unfunny and I gurantee the devs get annoyed by it getting requested alot.even though I kinda want shirtless Myers(and bikini/thong clown) it just won't happen because it doesn't fit the characters at all.

Breakdown breakdown

Bruh, im sure theres a decent amount of people in this sub that would want any contact with dem Huntress thighs
---
This is so sad can we rework springwood?
---
More like you'd rather just win chases amirite?
---
Because seriously, Feral Frenzy is just worthless past first hits.
---
Not a really good one, from what I can see, but at this point I’ll take it.
---
I’ve been waiting for a Killer lobby for 20 minutes now, I just want to test and see how it feels.
---
Even without insidious, had a leatherface yesterday that got me first and stood right in front of me me with chainsaw revved until I died. Made me question why I play survivor, survivors can be little shits as killer but they can't actually stop me playing.
---
I only wrote this because I saw that someone wrote: survivors think they should always escape or some shit. Had to make it equal 😂 
---
I don't really care either which way.
---
That’s a widely used misconception. She’s a lot closer to an animal than a child.
---
Did you hit by triple Adrenaline?
---
Aside from the technical aspect others have said, I would add that lore wise I think the Entity, with its control over the killer, wants the survivors to suffer and lose their hope before being sacrificed opposed to just killing them. 
---
Fun to think about.
---
I have no idea but I got selected too but do you know how many people got selected? I think it said 1000 but I forgot.
---
Fair point; I play on PS4 and haven't had much trouble filling lobbies lately. You should still try it if the wait isn't longer than 5 mins and see if it works out, but I've heard how long those PC lobbies take.

That looks great man thanks so much
---
&gt; wouldn't put 100% of the blame on BHVR, though. Players are responsible too.
---
absolutely. But I honestly dont know, why would Survivors be less fun?
---
KIRRAH QUEEEN
---
Feelsbadman
---
I also did it months ago, a classic meme !
---
I've got friends that play dbd once every few months and when I remind them most killers run an addon that allows them to see distant survivors on hook then think it's insanely cheap.
---
Rousing exists
---
Rip Yoshikage
---
I would like to see such stuff in loading screens with all killers. :)
---
I think it was in the patch notes that they just fixed a bug which didn't show postgame bloodpoints.
---
This \^ EAC said they dont care about it and BHVR doesnt care either. Just if for some reason you do get banned it wont be lifted
---
no, please
---
In my opinion this whole emblem system is bullshit. If you did a 4K you deserve a 2 pip imo.
---
I had a decent laugh when I saw this. I noticed the art style and thought to myself, "That looks like Rawrsaysrory". I scrolled past it though and started to think about it. When back and of course you had enough motivation to make one of these lol. Keep up the creative process \^\^
---
If you look at every other scoring to get pips, tunneling is the way to go.
---
I think it'd be cool to have bedrooms and u can hide under beds or behind something
---
The Hillbily. He was tortured by his own parents and fed through a hole in the wall. His parents were ashamed of him because he was ugly. Suddenly he escapes the "prison" and takes revenge by killing his parents. After that he remains as a serial killer and kills everyone he finds. The perfect plot for a horror movie.
---
Some killers gain more bloodpoints than others. I don't play much Legion, but Hag and Freddy get a lot of bloodpoints for their traps.
---
You should do a Doctor one! I mean, all of those look fantastic and Doctor could use one too!
---
You know it
---
Not today clown
---
Had this a while back, try closing and opening again, if after several tries without success, the only other option I did that worked was deleting the game and re-downloading it. Do not worry about your save data it is all on the cloud.
---
'Hex: Ruin' is what I've named it
---
Exactly. If you can catch them together and waste their time with it, that’s great but besides that, not worth much.
---
more dcs? I havent any DCs the last 3 weeks lol.
---
I think its mostly subjective reasons
---
I'm by no means fluent in Japanese, although I've studied the language for four years, but [jisho.org](https://jisho.org) shows  厄除け    
---
**(Yakuyoke) as meaning "warding off evil".  So I suppose it's an amulet that wards off evil.**   
---
However, Google does interpret the same kanji as meaning amulet. lol  
---
I understand this is a shitpost, and I appreciate the meme, I just wanted to share this with anyone who may be interested. I assume Jisho is right as it's an actual Japanese-English dictionary, but I can't say for certain.
---
the plan is to do all the killers, the doctor is on the shortlist actually
---
Funny how you insult someone's grammar, but you said "your the one whos slow"
---
I mean, hell yeah. But I think he’s cute in those white crew socks, too.
---
Yeah I know but mainly saying if I cant find the ruin still in atleast a minute then I'm getting on generator but my teammates just keep looking for it then when it doesn't matter anymore they fucking find it, it's just infuriating for someone that is pretty competitive that my teammates just dick around doing nothing.  Wish there was a competitive mode so I could get other sweaty teammates and killers and not casuals or new players.
---
* Having DS active doesn't allow you to act toxic.
---
* Don't farm your teammates right infront if me.
---
* You're not talented for using super long loops, you're just a dick.
---
* Flashlight saves are ok once or twice in a game, just not every fucking time. 
---
* Following me to sabo *every* hook while I'm carrying a survivor is just toxic. You will be slugged for that.
---
* The phrases "GG EZ", "baby killer" and the like are forbidden from end game chat.
---
* Don't accuse the killer of camping and tunneling when they clearly aren't.
---
Inb4 there's a Dad survivor and they yell that the survivor holding the flashlight is doing it wrong.
---
[Reference.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThGJXTucxY)
---
The blood looks almost authentic
---
Unless they have changed the timing recently, the killer can close the hatch while the survivor is jumping in. They did this because they took away the ability to grab the survivor during the jump to prevent hatch stand offs. Now, you either make it, or the killer closes the hatch and you run.
---
Amazing idea for "visuals" and I love it, but I can't help but feel this is a bit out-of-place in the slasher-movie theming of the game.
---
It was explained to me as BHVR visually rounds numbers, but internally uses exact numbers.  In other words, it says you got 100% because it’s rounded, when in reality you got 99.6%. It isn’t quite 100%, so you didn’t get bumped up. It’s dumb.
---
Which is why I edited my original comment.
---
I thought they removed lots of the fences for balance lmao
---
Yay bill finally  !! Left 4 dead was my fav back in the day
---
Why is every David King a bad player?
---
Every goddamn time its David King going down first in 10 seconds to 2 basic attacks.
---
I needed this daily recently, I ended up tunneling a toxic Jane who waited at the pallet, Everytime I tried ambushing her, a random survivor ran into me to stop me. I got my daily there.
---
Thanks, i always welcome extra bits of info, even on shitposts \^\^
---
Hold down the attack button instead of clicking it once, you will do a lunge attack instead of a quick short swipe
---
Legit question: if you don't camp, but you hook someone and you know for a fact that another survivor is right there but you can't tell where exactly, what do you do instead?
---
za warudo
---
Let’s not, or none of us will ever load Into a game for a year.
---
Except if they camped.
---
You know the girl who was stabbed 19 times by her two best friends in the name of Slenderman that was able to get herself help and survived. She also possesses unbreakable.
---
Nope you need to wait 3 seconds so you can't just pop in and out and stun them. It's a pretty bad perk
---
you have to be in the locker for 3 seconds for it to activate and they need to be in range so its hit or miss most of the time
---
Ahh I just hope that the dbd community enjoys it!
---
Ikr

Lame, that’s extremely situational

Truck-kun to the rescue by isekai'ing survivors back to Earth

Very sad

So, The Pig’s add-on, *Tampered Timer* says that it reduces the Reverse Bear Trap Timer, and underneath it, says that it can “Stack”.
---
But as far as I know, that’s the only add-on which will actually reduce the Timer on the Traps. So......?
---
Ahh thank you! I like to think Frames make the piece. I've got a creepy one ready for the spirit painting i'm working on.
---
I don't understand this community's obsession with making cute killer drawings.
---
Awe thank you so much!
---
It's a shame when perks get nerfed into oblivion though; MoM is dead.
---
Imago me actually getting no mother to proc.
---
New killer confirmed
---
Looks like this is console and I think cheating is impossible
---
True, but what would you suggest to have balanced it differently?
---
replace that ghostface perk with Lullaby.
---
Those 16 seconds are completly worthless
---
Careful, BHVR might ban you.
---
I love when survivors run Head On. It's so considerate of them to give me free locker grabs!
---
If that's ps4 I feel like they are a swf group. Had a game earlier on ps4 with similar levels.
---
All of these perks have no synergy with each other. Adrenaline will heal you and cause exhaustion so you cannot use dead hard. Adrenaline will not heal you if you are broken from deliverance. And MoM is garbage.
---
They fixed the visual issue. You WERE getting the bonus bloodpoints, even if they weren't being shown on screen.

She doesn't, she's just stunted socially and is more feral than human at this point. Nowhere in her lore is she said to have the mind of a child.

Hey remember the the first time this was posted? Yea it was only kinda funny back then.
---
Yes, I am having problems too
---
yes this shit is annoying as fuck. The devs seriously destroyed the connection this update. The game is unplayable every day I keep getting disconnected. No wonder these incompetent devs keep getting denied with their patches. Pathetic.
---
Yes, just happened to me also.
---
Yeah I keep getting no internet detected on dbd must be down or something
---
Is it Dead By Daylight servers or PlayStation servers, cause I keep getting kicked from my party and my connection is fine apparently
---
Yes, but there are 99 other non Obsession survivors.
---
Always make sure you wait until your friend gets into a chase before cleansing haunted grounds.
---
Was the Doc game a 3-gen game?
---
And I already use 3 perks to deal with not so fun killers.... Getting a bit tired of this...
---
Put still I hear the whispers from the fog to play this game
---
I pretty much one trick Amanda and last will worked the last time I used it
---
You cant slug if they jump into a locker. Another example: Lets say endgame has begun and 2 people are dead or have escaped. You've got one guy on hook. You can either facecamp the dude and secure the kill or stay close but look for the last person. If you look for the person then they can get the unhook. If they're healthy they will body block, so you avoid them and hit the unhooked survivor because you want the kill. Now they're om the ground and the healthy person is forced to leave. You are left with 2 options. Pick the survivor up and get ds'ed or let them crawl out. Also here's a question for you, if you dont wanna tunnel, what do you do if the unhooked survivor with ds goes for an unhook right after they were rescued? Do you leave them both alone? Do you slug them both? They can have borrowed time and unbreakable which wastes you a ton of time and if the other 2 survivors spend that time wisely, they can get 1-2 gens done while you did nothing to progress the game.
---
Or just use BBQ for that.
---
The only one of those perks that is any good at slowing the game down is pop.
---
God stop flexing on us doc, u make me uncomfortable
---
Jokes aside, I think he means the error thing at the end of a match. My friend is unable to rank up for weeks now thanks to that
---
I play LoL, and this community is the Dead Sea compared to LoL.
---
Maybe put tokens on the BOOMS like in Distortion. Instead of counting down aura visibility, count down muted BOOMS
---
If it doesn't give you iridescent you can obviously assume that it was somewhere between 99.5-100%. The devs have better things to do than give you numbers that are that specific.
---
It’s back up for me guys :) go enjoy the game
---
I don't think it will happen, but he'd make for a really interesting character.
---
I wonder if he could work as a Killer? 
---
I know he could have some interesting Survivor perks if BHVR put effort into it, but I could also see him working just as well as a new Stealth Killer. Maybe with a power based around locating Survivors with sound in order to surprise and ambush them.
---
At least they didn't perform this hot fix at 3AM.
---
Hatch*
---
That was kinda hawt
---
He mean he ain't lying.
---
Western "art" style. Not even once.
---
So why is the obsession going to stay away from myers then? They'd cling to myers like a siamese twin. 
---
Leatherface has no competition here.
---
For killers, all you need to do is level leatherface first to get barbeque. Its basically double bp for killers. For survivors I recommend Claudette for self care and then Meg for Sprint Burst. After that, go with whatever.
---
No one listens when an explanation is that simple, they need to understand WHY.
---
Whenever i play killer and someone teabags a lot it just makes me think they have hemorrhoids and they're trying to itch it.  So i put them out of their misery.
---
Imagine how absolutely terrible freddy would be if he only had dream projection, he basically just be an m1 killer like before without the manual sleeping
---
Youre a better man than me then, if I want out of this mess of a game I just beg for a hook.
---
But its hard to take this game seriously when MYC ebony mori nurses exist.
---
Trapper used to be a God on that map but then they removed all the tall grass from the sides of the houses.
---
The end game collapse only happens when the killer closes the hatch,opens the gate,or the exit gates are open so if you are bill and are the only one alive finish the gen open the gate and escape
---
I find that event very rare now, just making sure
---
Post this on r/dbdgonewild as well. I'd buy one to use as a meme but I share my pc with others.
---
Most of that is the killer’s fault, I’ll admit I’ve been a victim of the exit gate borrowed time and it fucking stings
---
Just 100% for everyone, so I’m guessing 300% max
---
Only two ppl can heal one injured
---
It'd be really cool if you repainted a set of those lego Woody legs to give Myers that extra head of height!
---
What event?
---
can 3 ppl not heal?
---
4k 5 gens up 6 minute game with 12 hooks and every chase ended in 2 seconds
---
BHVR: here's ur safety pip, do better next time $\^)
---
wait... so nothing stacks on well make it?? not even medkits??
---
The fingers are an amazing touch that makes this picture very unsettling. True to the lore and very artistic.
---
Nope, it says it on the description
---
The event that the killer doesn’t close the hatch or open the gate and the gens don’t get cut off.
---
no medkits?
---
Well the killer has to find the hatch before they can close it and its hard to find and doesn’t have an aura for the killer
---
Doesn’t matter, the speed will be capped to 100% if we’ll make it is active, if not I don’t think you would even be able to reach it
---
Overcharge is just a bad perk. If you aren't doctor who puts the skill check in odd places it's usually just a free great skill check for the survivor.
---
[It's one of his addons](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/VHS_Porn)
---
is it just that? or is there more to it
---
yeah all the reports for hooking people
---
it is a useless perk
---
An honest answer might be that some guides recommend new players to start as David to unlock We're Going to Live Forever so that they can grind for Bloodpoints faster. If these David's are at low ranks, this could be why.
---
Its only illegal if they cant can prove it. Cant prove if they cant see it
---
tldr: close the coffin before doing it
---
Should be 10 seconds or less, probably 5 or 7 seconds. I cant remember such overpowered healing during this one match.
---
In pretty sure We’ll Make It stacks with Botany. I think the description means you can’t stack We’ll Make It with itself. If you get 2 unhooks in the span of 10 seconds you’ll still only have +100% healing speed.
---
honestly, I would have just changed it to 4 hits instead of 3 that way in order for you to even be able to use it you would need to escape the killer at least 1 time after being hit
---
Play anyway you want.  
---
And if you think about it, pretty much everyone has an impalement fetish
---
Don't worry about it. Turn off chat and play how you want.
---
I get notifications for every new comment and it makes me want to die.
---
You can down the Obsession then go to town on all the survivors trying to heal them, have 8 tokens in no time. Cause the max amount of people that can heal someone is 2. 
---
Then again, tombstone Myers could just grab and kill everyone if combined with the Fragrant Tuft of Hair. No need to worry about stalk time. There are 100 people to stalk.
---
that is so fucking cool
---
it is not possible honestly. no way you will complete a gen then leave before the killer finds the hatch unless you 99 last gen and wait for the others to die
---
if they did that, more people would just DC if they got downed first
---
I'm not sure there needs to be more? It's an item that is unsettling given the implication and what we know about the character, and it's relevant to the character - not sure how much more you need.
---
I think the VHS porn is an artifact that is part of painting the creepy picture of the clown without explicitly stating it (good horror leaves room for interpretation, I'd argue) - just like the bottle of chloroform, the key ring of fingers, or the flask of bleach.
---
No no, iron will and unbreakable obv. For the synergies with no mither.
---
No i just mean if killers dc and the whole game ends not just a survivor
---
a lot of time the gates a super close to each other so there is another long shot of getting it as well
---
Oh 
---
My 
---
God 
---
😧
---
This was basically like my game except the killer was trying to help the worthless claud and kill me.
---
Tbh that should just be full game you get your stuff back.
---
I mean "Libra's tend to be extremely lazy, but excellent at making plans"
---
Me
---
And "Virgo's tend to be shy around people, and extremely organised"
---
Also me
---
I think unbreakable is required at high ranks where slugging is usually meta

I'm sorry you and your friends have had only negative experiences with legacy players but...
---
&gt; agreed upon by the community
---
That's just not true. 
---
Personally, most legacies i see are too bad to be assholes :P And i keep post game chat closed most of the time since there's not many reasons to keep it open (unless you want to watch your IQ drop with every sentence read), so maybe i'm missing out on the asshole part a bit but still... Nah.
---
*unzip*
---
Probably meant idiota, which is Spanish for idiot.  Makes sense, since Otz lives in Spain and is probably playing people in that region.
---
The thing that sucks is sometimes you can't tell if it's a lag switch or not. I was in a game yesterday playing as survivor and a Feng on my team looped the killer for nearly the whole game. Eventually he downs her and we pop the final gen and she had adrenaline. She runs and the killer stops moving, then she teleports back and is down again. Camp and tunnel me all day but lag switching is too far. Especially when you use it because you got outplayed.
---
These are red and purple rank survivors doing this shit lmao. My favorite is when people try to body block me when I'm playing nurse. Sometimes I fully believe that console players don't have a fully functioning brain.

The shape, do it. So much fun to play as him
---
Consider that many people may be playing right now.
---
You won’t get these messages much. I’ve only gotten two messages, and one of them was positive.
---
getting the overcharge skill check does not count as a great and does not progress the gen
---
There's a broken toten spot on one of the Badham maps. Literally impossible to cleanse.
---
Well, you didn't need to use just one perk per panel.
---
I feel this. Checking out streams after a good ol' round of Pigging is my life blood.
---
If you combo it with quick and quiet and you break LoS before you jump in locker should give enough time for the stun
---
Beat me too it
---
Felt it was best for consistency as I wouldn't have enough perks for something like two per panel. Overcharge would just kinda be thrown in with some other perk that's a real stretch.
---
It's not.
---
" Succeeding the Skill Check grants no progress but prevents the Generator explosion. "
---
This is what i do everytime
---
Pffft Myers is just SO OP that insta down after sitting and looking at survivors for a minute?!? Ridiculous. Don’t even get me started on leatherface, that chainsaw should just be taken away
---
Yes. Well, more so quicker imo. I see more people looking for totems right at the start instead of working on gens. Even when ruin isnt on.
---
As said above i would suggest wraith, wraith is entirely overpowered imo I never dont come out with a 4k with him. Being able to sneak right up on peeps doing gens, or trying to unhook friends is super easy to hit with his speed boost after uncloaking.
---

Try playing survivor without looping.  Also stop acting like killer mains are any better.  Youre doing the same thing survivor mains do by complaining about core gameplay mechanics.  Learn how to get better, or stop complaining.  
---
~~Brought to you by your local 50/50 main~~
---
#NANI??!
---
I mean, if I were trying to compare Thrilling Tremors to Ruin I really wouldn't worry about stretching.
---
Absolutely none at the moment
---
I can't say that's accurate. Because I literally get news posts once or more a week saying that survivors are trying to get something nerfed on the killers side. 
---
And my point is, the survivors pallet loop then complain about some other tactic used by the killers, like tunneling. 
---
If you want to say "what are we suppose to do" then why also complain about tunneling? Because the killer can come back with "what am I suppose to do? Let the survivors get away after 1 minute of pallet looping because I don't want o be that guy that tunnels"? 
---
Honestly, I get that complaining is annoying. But I want a actual reason why survivors complain SO much and have to disconnect or send a salty message when they lose.
---
*"Laugh" sign flickers before breaking.*
---
My point is they still certainty aren’t killing survivors, survivors overreact to the smallest things
---
thrilling tremors pretty good. Regardless there's a reason ruin is the biggest one, it's notoriously regarded as the best even if I'd disagree. I'd at least say it's better than tremors but eh not by much.
---
In situations like this where I’m paired against a team that’s lower rank than me (whether killer or survivor) and I do better than them all I feel I can really do is apologise and wish them better luck for next time :/ this matchmaking sucks
---
Bill is giving Wraith a hug :)
---
(Also teammates be like "I'm helping!" Or could they not unhook you?)
---
Enduring
---
I'm not saying Tremors is bad. I'm saying comparing it to Ruin is downright silly. It's not a time-waster perk like Ruin is; it's a tracking perk like BBQ.  
---
Tremors is a basket of apples. Ruin is a basket of oranges.
---
I think she’s lots of fun.
---
Well you could've been up to 1.5% off from getting that extra pip if all three were rounded up. But still an oof
---
Happened to me today too, the killer dc’d as soon as the match started and I lost my escape cake and I messaged them why and they said they wanted to derank
---
So as a 50/50 main, who sends you the bitchiest/ most messages after losing. Killers or survivors?
---
 Because from my experience, ive only received salty messages from survivors and have never experienced a killer DC just because their not winning.
---
That's pretty fucking neat
---
Ghost face sounds annoyed at most.
---
*sigh*
---
Thank you! 👌
---
You do realize that is not what tunneling is correct? And seeing something a lot on Reddit does not mean much of anything. I have seen killers complain a lot about different perks and etc until they got nerfed or changed it’s nothing new both sides bitch and cry about anything and if they don’t win then it’s the game not them. It’s nothing new and the toxicity is not even that bad compared to some games like say overwatch a lot of PVP games are toxic it’s just how it is it’s sad but it’s the truth. This post is doing exactly what you complaining about
---
I wanna make one like this
---
It's been bugged for quite a while unless they fixed it recently.
---
It's in the same place as the shitpost flair
---
Uhhh, whats puppyguarding for those of us who don’t know.
---
Very angry *sighhhhhhh* honestly sounds like he’s about to rip your spine from your body
---
I will be happy when they sort out the dedicated servers or the hit boxes.
---
Both as a killer and survivor they are wack. I've landed hits that I shouldn't Have, missed hits that should have connected and been hit by things that should have missed.
---
Also would love a ability to pick a preference in the bloodweb for items. Maybe make it a perk for prestige, I don't use flash lights or need the add-ons 😑
---
Dbd one hand gameplay
---
You're right except horrendous spawn is the norm, most games I have now as survivor or killer a survivor spawns near it and whether it's destroyed immediately or 30 seconds later depends on whether or not the killer can charge over there in time. Discordance feels more reliable to me for preventing the first gen getting done before you can get there. I run ruin on some of my killers but I usually end up wishing I'd brought something that would've been more useful.
---
Honestly I want them to just change the corn into wheat like they said they were going to do a long time ago. Like, make it tall enough to crouch in (it would move and bend so you could still see the survivor) but short enough where if a survivor was walking around in it they were able to be seen quite obviously.
---
I don't know if they ever stated anything more about changing it, and I doubt they will at this point. I still think it would be interesting to see.
---
I don't think you've played Overwatch
---
Ive definitely seen killers DC.  That said Ive probably seen more killers complain here, but more survivors ingame.  ~~probably bc theres 4x more survivors ingame tho~~  
---
It's also a lot easier to hold the game captive as a killer.  Camping/tunneling leaves 1 person to just completely not play the game. Period. They sit on a hook for 3 minutes, the end.  At least with killer if youre getting pummeled there's things to do, and more survivors to deal with.  
---
Also if youve never seen a killer DC youve never played survivor the fun way c;
---
Never forget the man who brings NoEd on an instadown killer with a red Mori.
---
Killers DC all the time,
---
Also keep in mind you're being exposed to 4x more survivors than are you killers, so even if you "receive 4x as much salt" from survivors  technically it evens out
---
Really I never noticed that. I may have to pay more attention
---
Meh-nacing
---
Can I get one for hag?
---
Nasty but respectable.
---
I've also been affected
---
This is like saying that the Hillbilly has a low skill ceiling because all you have to do is learn how to hit people with his chainsaw. While that's a large part of it, there is a lot more that goes into playing the killer than just that. The skill cap that goes into the Spirit involves more prediction of survivor movement and learning to get ahead of and cut off a retreat rather than just following them.
---
Just wanted to point out that PS4 matchmaking is broken AGAIN. It's doing the exact same problem with the errors when the pig cosmetics were released.
---
But I play legion.
---
Have you done ghost face?
---
There’s also the “Can’t hit me while I’m unhooking”
---
People consider that camping when you play Billy. 
---
There’s other character specific camp rules but I only play Freddy and Billy and Freddy can’t camp anyways.
---
Yup... AGAIN. This happened when the pig cosmetics were released a week or two ago. Hope they fix it.
---
Except it does because all the other gens are blocked for a little bit and you obviously will go chase after the gen being worked on.  Works great with pop because you know that gen in specific was being worked on.
---
Yup. Made a post about this as well. Upvote so devs might read it.
---
In my situation about 20 seconds into the game someone got their ruin totem and they rage quit right after :(
---
Overwatch isn't as bad as Dead by daylight.
---
 Depends on how loose that garment was at the beginning of Halloween
---
I have a ton of pig splinters I use sometimes.
---
It's funny to pretend you have a Mori.
---
spelling exists too
---
We'll Make It doesn't stack with anything. The highest a single survivor can ever get is +100% healing speed. The only time We'll Make It would stack with Botany Knowledge is if the killer is running something like Sloppy Butcher or Coulrophobia.

Overwatch is worse lol. I have almost the same time played in both game (3,000 hours each) and overwatch is far worse.
---
Does this newer player understand abbreviations like stbfl

What rank are you?

This will be my pc wallpaper cuz im a toxic legion main
---
Thrilling tremors is low key good its lowkey a bbq and forces them off gens for saves if they leave it

Are you on console or pc? Maybe it's a platform specific bug?

NoED and ebony mori on leatherface? You have ascended humanity
---
What is this does the description not say there's no missed attack cooldown?

Bill uses science as his weapon
---
make the explosion happen to the nearest gen instead of the one you're working on

How'd this happen.
---
It works for me
---
UUUUAAUUUGH
---
i havent played yet this new patch. kinda don't want to anymore. that being said i'm definitely going to be giving "Hide or Die" a chance.
---
Not gonna repost, but I am gonna share Lmoa, great job!
---
The doctor probably has the most potential tbh 
---
I’d love a wraith and nurse movie though.
---
Standard healing is 16 seconds, We'll make it is 8 secs
---
Change your location to Sweden in the AppStore and you can download it, that’s how I got it
---
10, I mostly play against rank 7+ killers
---
The issue is that the exit gate was litteraly a few meters away- he didnt really have a choice... you just got lucky with a half-decent team
---
Faxxxxx people on overwatch try to dictate other peoples play style on a waaayyy worse scale than DBD.
---
They should rework her add-ons not just fixing a bug lol
---
I use my own rules most of the time as a killer. Sometimes I will be in a good mood or actually respect the effort a survivor has put in and let them live and escape (I have carried people to the hatch/exit out of respect a fair few times). Othertimes I will hunt people down with no remorse. 
---
Play how you want and how you feel like. You might get hate mail from salty players but don't let it bother you.
---
I still want a chef skin for wraith with a dinner bell 😂.
---
and with 2 people 4 seconds? so is 3 ppl literally an isnta heal or by “does not stalk” does it mean AT ALL like even several people
---
What made you think I wanted to see this?

he’s obviously joking around you snowflake
---
Does it matter, rank is a joke in this game.
---
You must be a great looper and make them mad that you are wasting so much of their time.
---
First, only two people can heal at the same time. Second, there is a penalty for multiple people healing or repairing. Third, the max you can reach is 100% speed.
---
I think you meant to post this at r/dbdgonewild
---
Cleanse &gt; Gens &gt; Friends
---
I don’t think my heart would be able to take being jump scared by a shark lol
---
That was the best he could do without losing, the gates were open so i don't think you should've bm'ed at the end because he's just doing his best
---
You didn’t really bait it, you just straight teleported.  Nice teleport, btw!
---
This, sometimes it just isn't worth it to have a perk that in general is easy to counter and can be removed from the game before it does literally anything. It is better on setup killers, but on others, I prefer having a perk that's either a Hex with an actually strong effect or has good gen patrolling/slowing power without being tied to some bones.
---
Best DLC are Nurse and Spirit
---
Most fun imo are Myers, Clown, and Ghostface
---
*Entity Displeased*
---
I don’t like Corrupt Intervention because it’s useless after the first 2 minutes. I think it should block off the 3 closest gens to a completed gen for 20 seconds.
---
Ruin,bbq classic

Hah, that would be fun, but I think this is the furthest I'll go. You'll have to use your imagination. xD And thanks for the compliment!
---
Yoshikage Kira as next Killer, please. 
---
Shigechi will be the Survivor.
---
People are speculating anywhere from 3 to 5 years.
---
Pretty sure Hag's would be inverted. xD But sure, I can work on some fun Hag stuff.
---
I completely understand! Thanks for admiring from afar. :P
---
Wouldn’t look right, if I’m gonna be honest. Plus, since they only used them for TS3 Woody and Jessie, so the color selection is very limited. Not only that, but I also can’t paint legs entirely. I can paint the shoes and lower area, but the upper area often gets the paint scraped off if I try moving the legs.
---
However, I did experiment with a recent custom, and found I just need to paint enough layers and test it enough times to prevent the paint from scraping off.
---
Looks like someone already posted it there. I didn't even know this was a thing.
---
Real talk, Discordance, Surveillance, and PGTW are a great triple combo build for Freddy. Add in BBQ+C, and they won't be able to touch the gens without Freddy knowing about it.
---
Leatherface was put on heels to look more imposing, taller.
---
Whats DH and BT? Is there a shortcut for every perk???
---
“Allow is to introduce ourselves” in

“Devourer of pallets” 
---
Damn that hurt...
---
You could restart your Xbox
---
That’s happened to me before and they let me die in the basement first hook :,(
---
Idk if people even use that term in this game, it's basically camping the perimeter of the hooked person in a certain radius so you can respond quickly if they are saved. So basically still camping, just not facecamping so that if something else starts happening with survs that you could take advantage of, you'll be ready because you're not sitting there staring at the already hooked survivor.
---
Try this too, make sure to try this before deleting and re downloading
---
Poor Bubba
---
Cannon cosmetics dont matter anymore since tapps new cosmetics arent cannon at all.
---
Not fixed. Aslo couldn't taunt earlier or heal myself or escape the gates
---
Oh no you misunderstand me, I enjoy playing as my P3 Billy with either an insane slug build or red Mori to punish swf, even using NoEd sometimes. They won’t forget you, because you have all you could to punish the swf. I motors an entire swf once, and they told me that “ People like me ruin the game”. My response? “Naughty survivors get the *chainsaw massage*”
---
Not fixed
---
Or LoL.
---
Obligatory Was that a JoJo's reference
---
Dude, DbD isn‘t scary.... Just sayin‘
---
I feel like I've [seen this before](https://youtu.be/taSy3O8Pd_I?t=224). Now I kinda want to see a killer that can pick up survivors and throw them at others or something.
---
She's not handicapped. Being remarkably socially inept is not a disability. I'm not massively into the whole "UwU fuck the killer time" thing, but she's not handicapped.
---
So what your saying is, there's a chance
---
Default is 4, can be increased to 5 with a Pig addon
---
Well it actually does take some skill same with killers. 
---
Like Looping Correctly
---
Lol thank you and keep stabbing 😎
---
Guess that's how you get the (aptly named) Dream Master score event.
---
Sure thing. I already have a few parts set aside for Trapper, Doctor, Ghostface, Bill, Ash, and Quentin.
---
No but i plan to tomorrow
---
Hit or miss, I guess they Nea miss, huh?
---
Me run until killer close then throw down pallet. Qtes show so much skill.
---
Wraith you utter fool! With my ability: 「Balanced Landing」I can loop you around this coal tower forever! You cannot threaten my everlasting clikax!
---
Ah, so Amanda’s letter leaves 2 Boxes? That’s pretty weird.
---
One day i was getting tons of ebony's in my bloodweb &amp; i managed to four man 3 separate matches with them
---
Literally one pixel away from escaping
---
Where is the Wraith?
---
Hmm i mean now that you put it that way i guess it takes a miniscule amount of skill.
---
Facts.
---
Yep! Also see: completely useless
---
Bing Bong Boi regrettably makes too much noise
---
We just need Jason in the game and then The Slash Street Boys will be complete!
---
O W
---
Don't lose hope my brethren. We need to set up a chain of events leading to the creation of a new film with a shirtless Myers scene. This will give an excuse to create a shirtless skin for him in DBD. Nothing is impossible.
---
It will be fixed in the next patch per their post earlier today
---
Hence why I have literally 27 of them. Just thinking of different Pig Builds to try, and uhhh, haven’t found a good use for it.
---
Yeah it takes some skill not as much as it takes playing Killer. 
---
That’s why some people can’t get past other ranks because it takes skill. Others also get carried. 
---
I play both roles so I see from both perspectives. 
---
I personally hate any main that tries to debate about the opposite side because usually they have no knowledge.
---
"Such a shame" *readies hatchet*
---
Bs i play survivor just as much and its boring how little effort i have to put in. Btw with killer and surv i usually float around 8/9 ish ranks.
---
Every multiplayer game ever made has people complaining about it. That's just the nature of it. If you think this is salty you haven't heard the ingame chat of peak Call of Duty

they downloaded a custom icon pack
---
It would be a new feature. I'm not keen on the idea either myself, but hiding behind and in things is already part of the game, so hiding under something isn't some out of this world idea.
---
BTW he mentioned hiding under a bed and behind things in the room.
---
I literally use Ruin, Surveillance, and Pop and gens still pop ridiculously fast.
---
“Skill”
---
I've been seeing people run past the gate and into the part past it, but it's not counting them escaping.
---
I'm a r 4 killer and 6 survivor dummy. Still doesn't matter you're a shitty killer that got outplayed and now you're whining about it on reddit. Awwww man.
---
Yes but I’m obviously talking about the bed part. 
---
And so if they added a bed in that map they would have to add a bed in every map then. 
---
In some maps it won’t make sense. 
---
And it gives more hiding options which generally you shouldn’t have to use. Because your main goal is to escape as fast as you can. 
---
I don’t see the idea being implemented.

This is wonderful! Love how creepy it is, it's just unsettling to look at. Great work!

When in the world would you run discordance or surveillance over ruin?? Those both slow down only one generator at a time max, and it requires you to go deal with it. Ruins automatic, stalls everyone, and sets out survivors on what could be a long search for the totem.
---
Ruin is by far the number one reason I run stake out.
---
This just gave me an eyegasm. Nice job.
---
Maybe just over thinking it. "Press space to hide" could appear on various objects and wouldn't be so far removed from lockers. 
---
All in saying is it isn't a crazy idea. But I wouldn't care to see it in game either
---
Survivors that I valued their perks:
---
Nea: urban evasion and balanced landing
---
Meg: sprint burst, quick and quiet, adrenaline are all useful
---
Claudette: self care
---
David king: dead hard
---
I haven’t had much use for the other survivors reachable perks and look for the ones locked behind the moneyrealm in the shrine
---
Look at his name though. He's just role-playing. I bet he would go great with a hot turkey sub, mmhhhhh.
---
I’m a fellow Ghostface main, and I approve this message.
---
I would like Joyce Byers or hopper
---
How? Is there a problem with a perk that only activated when you fail a gen skill check? I believe it’d be a perfect change for the perk
---
It sure takes skill to just stare at someone lol, you have to mindgame and time your vaults as survivor dumbass, this game isn’t about skill
---
You just need some distance and out of line of site. I usually use it once or twice every game, especially with quick and quiet
